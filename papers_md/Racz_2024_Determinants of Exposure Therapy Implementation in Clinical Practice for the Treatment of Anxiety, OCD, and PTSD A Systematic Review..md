Abstract
Exposure therapy (ET) forms a vital part of effective psychotherapy for anxiety-related presentations including anxiety 
disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and is often underutilised in 
clinical practice. Using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), this systematic review synthesised existing literature 
on the determinants of ET implementation for anxiety-related presentations and examined differences across presentations 
and developmental subgroups. Fifty-two eligible studies were assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, with 389 
results (99%) mapped onto the TDF. Results suggested that clinicians’ negative beliefs about the consequences of ET were 
commonly associated with reduced implementation. It also appeared that whilst broad unspecified ET training may be 
related to improved implementation for anxiety disorders; greater implementation for complex presentations (i.e., PTSD) 
likely requires more specialised training involving practical components. A subset of domains (e.g., social/professional role 
and identity) accounted for most results, whilst some remain unexplored (i.e., optimism; reinforcement; memory, attention, 
and decision processes) or underexplored (i.e., behavioural regulation). Likewise, specific presentations and developmental 
subgroups (i.e., PTSD and adults) represented a greater proportion of results in the literature than others (i.e., OCD and 
youth). Future research exploring ET implementation, across specific presentations and developmental subgroups, would 
benefit from integrating implementation science frameworks to guide the development of targeted, comprehensive strategies 
to close the research-practice gap of ET for the treatment of anxiety-related presentations.

Anxiety disorders (i.e., separation anxiety disorder, selec-
tive mutism, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic 
disorder, agoraphobia, generalised anxiety disorder) are 
characterised by excessive anxiety, fear, and avoidance, 
often onset in childhood, and persist if untreated (Ameri-
can Psychiatric Association, 2022). Obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
previously defined as anxiety disorders in earlier taxonomic 
tools (e.g., American Psychiatric Association, 2000), are 
characterised by similar underlying mechanisms to anxiety 
disorders and share similar patterns of symptom expression.

For instance, maladaptive threat appraisals and dysfunc-
tional belief biases (e.g., intolerance of uncertainty) are 
common and accompanied by a fear response, avoidance, 
and other safety seeking behaviours (Farrell et al., 2019). 
These disorders are common with a combined 12-month 
prevalence of 17%, and disorder specific figures ranging 
from 4% for OCD, 6% for PTSD, and up to 7% for some 
anxiety disorders (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2023). 
These anxiety-related presentations (i.e., anxiety disorders, 
OCD, and PTSD) commonly co-occur and are highly comor-
bid with mood disorders, resulting in a significant burden for 
clients (Bandelow & Michaelis, 2015). Alongside impairing 
symptoms, the long-term consequences of these disorders 
include educational underachievement in youth (Woodward 
& Fergusson, 2001), reduced quality of life, and increased 
suicidality (Angst et al., 2004; McFarlane, 2000; Wittchen & 
Hoyer, 2001), highlighting the critical importance of effec-
tive and early intervention.

Empirically supported treatment is effective for anxiety-
related presentations, namely cognitive-behavioural therapy 
(CBT), of which exposure therapy (ET) is arguably the most 
important therapeutic component (Carpenter et al., 2018; 
Muris,  2019;  Whiteside  et  al., 2020).  Yet  ET  is  widely 
underutilised in community mental health settings (e.g., 
Becker-Haimes et al., 2017). Whilst there have been sev-
eral barriers to the implementation of ET explored in the 
literature (e.g., clinician attitudes; Blakey et al., 2018), to 
date there has not been a theoretically driven approach to 
synthesising the existing literature within an implementa-
tion science framework. Moreover, little is known about 
the determinants of implementation across different client 
groups, such as disorder presentations or development sub-
groups. Using implementation science to identify, prioritise, 
and synthesise determinants of ET use in practice will likely 
drive the development of targeted, integrated, and multi-
level interventions to increase ET utilisation in practice. This 
systematic review aims to synthesise the existing evidence 
on the determinants of ET implementation in treating anx-
iety-related presentations, using the Theoretical Domains 
Framework (TDF; Cane et al., 2012; Michie et al., 2005), 
to identify gaps in knowledge, guide future research, and 
inform future implementation strategies.

Evidence‑Based Treatments 
for Anxiety‑Related Presentations

Evidence-based treatments for anxiety-related presentations 
include pharmacotherapies (e.g., serotonin-noradrenaline 
reuptake  inhibitors)  and  various  psychotherapies,  most 
notably CBT, the gold-standard psychotherapy for anxiety-
related presentations (Bandelow et al., 2015). Combining 
cognitive and behavioural therapies, CBT modifies mala-
daptive cognitions and consequently addresses problematic 
behaviours that perpetuate emotional disturbances (Tolin, 
2016). CBT for the treatment of anxiety-related presenta-
tions  is  a  multi-component  therapy,  typically  involving 
psychoeducation, anxiety management, cognitive therapy, 
ET, problem-solving, and relapse prevention (Tolin, 2016). 
Whilst limited research has examined the efficacy of indi-
vidual components of CBT, ET is an exception (Creswell 
et al., 2020), with evidence suggesting that ET uniquely 
reduces symptom severity and improves functioning when 
accounting for relaxation training and cognitive restructur-
ing (Peris et al., 2015). ET is consistently identified as an 
essential component of CBT for the treatment of anxiety 
disorders (e.g., Bandelow et al., 2022), OCD (e.g., National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2005), and PTSD 
(e.g., American Psychological Association, 2017) in clients 
from across the lifespan (Katzman et al., 2014).

ET is predicated on the CBT model conceptualising 
anxiety as originating in aversive situations, which elicit 
an adaptive threat response (Albano & Kendall, 2002). 
However, when generalised to safe contexts, these auto-
matic threat cognitions become maladaptive, eliciting dis-
tress and behavioural avoidance in the absence of actual 
danger. Behavioural avoidance is proposed to maintain 
maladaptive threat appraisals and perceived coping by 
limiting opportunities for maladaptive appraisals to be 
challenged, perpetuating a cycle of behavioural avoid-
ance  (Moghaddam  et  al., 2015).  ET  targets  this  cycle 
using therapist-guided, within and between session, sys-
tematic, gradual, and repeated exposure to aversive stim-
uli, intended to disconfirm maladaptive threat cognitions, 
violate threat expectancies, and facilitate habituation of 
the feared response (i.e., steady decline in arousal and fear 
over time; Abramowitz et al., 2019). ET has been adapted 
from this common premise into distinct variations for dif-
ferent presentations, such as exposure and response pre-
vention (ERP) for OCD, which involves refraining from 
engaging in neutralising responses during ET (Hezel & 
Simpson, 2019). ERP aims to break the cycle of OCD 
distress and avoidance by reducing compulsive rituals with 
the goal of assisting clients to learn new (non-threatening) 
information about feared stimuli and to develop distress 
tolerance (Foa et al., 2012). ET has also been adapted into 
prolonged  exposure  for  PTSD,  entailing  imaginal  and 
in vivo exposure delivered over prolonged periods with 
the goal of processing trauma responses (Foa, 2011). Spe-
cifically, by exposing clients to the traumatic memory, pro-
longed exposure aims to allow them to challenge maladap-
tive beliefs they may have been formed around the trauma, 
about the world and themselves (Foa, 2011). In addition to 
the different forms ET can take for various presentations, 
it can also be delivered via different modalities. For exam-
ple, it may be delivered in vivo (i.e., exposure to actual 
stimuli), as imaginal exposure, via virtual reality, or inter-
oceptively (i.e., eliciting aversive physical sensations). 
These variations mean that, as a therapeutic technique, 
ET is flexibly delivered, requiring clinicians to understand 
how to implement it appropriately and effectively for the 
needs of the client and their presentation (Abramowitz 
et  al.,  2019).  Amongst  anxiety-related  presentations, 
ET’s status as the gold-standard treatment is supported 
by several meta-analyses. For example, a meta-analysis 
of results from 10 randomised placebo-controlled trials 
found that the use of ET resulted in a large reduction in 
symptom outcomes relative to placebo treatment in clients 
with anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD in adults (Car-
penter et al., 2018). Similar findings have been reported 
amongst youth, with meta-analyses reporting larger effects 
for ET relative to pharmacotherapy for OCD (Abramowitz 
et al., 2005), and relative to waitlist conditions for anxiety

disorders (Ale et al., 2015) and PTSD (Huang et al., 2022). 
Moreover, despite clients experiencing temporary distress 
during ET, it is frequently reported as useful (Cox et al., 
1994) and is well tolerated (Carpenter et al., 2018; Tuerk 
et al., 2011).

The Underutilisation of ET

Despite half-a-century of clinical trials and reviews estab-
lishing the effectiveness of ET (e.g., Carpenter et al., 2018) 
and solidifying its place as the treatment of choice for anx-
iety-related presentations (e.g., Katzman et al., 2014), ET 
remains underutilised in the routine care of anxiety-related 
presentations. For instance, only 37% of clinicians in com-
munity mental health settings endorse routinely using ET 
with  clients  with  anxiety-related  presentations  (Becker-
Haimes et al., 2017). This means that in routine practice ET 
is implemented at a rate comparable to that of non-evidence-
based techniques including art therapy for the treatment of 
anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD (i.e., 17% to 28%; Hipol 
& Deacon, 2013). This underuse occurs across the lifespan 
with Whiteside, Sattler et al. (2016a, 2016b) finding 76% 
of youth with anxiety-related presentations treated outside 
specialty anxiety clinics are never introduced to ET. Beyond 
its underuse, even when ET is implemented, it is often done 
sub-optimally. For example, it is more frequently deliv-
ered as therapist-instructed homework instead of the gold-
standard, therapist-assisted, within-sessions exposure (Sars 
& van Minnen, 2015). This underutilisation of ET is com-
plex and may occur for many reasons, including clinicians’ 
perceptions of ET’s safety, tolerability, and applicability 
(Blakey et al., 2018). In the context of treating clients from 
different developmental subgroups, unique barriers to ET 
implementation may exist. Indeed, Becker and colleagues 
(2018) in their study of 209 CBT trainees and psychothera-
pists in Germany found that clinicians treating youth hold 
more negative ET attitudes than those treating adults. Given 
the prevalence of negative perceptions towards ET (Blakey 
et al., 2018) and reflecting broader psychotherapy imple-
mentation literature (Waller & Turner, 2016), research to 
date has primarily focused on clinician-level determinants 
(Deacon  &  Farrell, 2013).  Whilst  client  and  contextual 
determinants have been examined (Harned et al., 2013), they 
constitute few studies by comparison, and explorations are 
often limited to relatively few possible determinants. Over-
all, this underutilisation of ET represents a significant bar-
rier for clients to access effective evidence-based treatment 
(Abramowitz et al., 2018) and has emerged as an important 
area of research in the last decade. However, there have 
been few efforts (e.g., Becker-Haimes et al., 2019; Ringle 
et al., 2015) to integrate evidence on known implementation 

determinants addressing clinician, client, and system predic-
tors of ET underutilisation.

The Contribution of Implementation Science

Implementation science refers to the use of the scientific 
method to promote the systematic uptake of research into 
evidence-based practice (Eccles & Mittman, 2006). Apply-
ing such an approach to identifying the most important pre-
dictors of ET use across client subgroups may support the 
development of innovative and more effective intervention 
strategies to improve its implementation. Several theoretical 
frameworks have been developed to understand the determi-
nants of knowledge implementation (Birken et al., 2017b). 
One such framework, the Theoretical Domains Frameowrk 
(TDF) comprehensively integrates 128 explanatory con-
structs from 33 distinct theories (e.g., Theory of Planned 
Behaviour) to identify14 domains related to healthcare pro-
vider behaviour change (Cane et al., 2012; Michie et al., 
2005). These include knowledge; skills; social/professional 
role  and  identity;  beliefs  about  capabilities;  optimism; 
beliefs  about  consequences;  reinforcement;  intentions; 
goals; memory, attention, and decision processes; environ-
mental context and resources; social influences; emotion; 
and behavioural regulation. Importantly, these domains can 
be translated via the Capability Opportunity and Motivation 
model of behaviour (COM-B; Michie et al., 2011) to iden-
tify targeted interventions on the Behaviour Change Wheel 
(BCW; Michie et al., 2014) to improve implementation. It 
has been used in a range of settings to identify determinants 
of evidence implementation for acute lower back pain, hand 
hygiene, blood transfusion, tobacco use prevention (Cane 
et al., 2012), remote psychological practice (Faija et al., 
2020), and shared decision-making (Hayes et al., 2019). This 
theoretical breadth and relationship to the BCW make the 
TDF particularly suited to the goal of informing strategies 
for improving the implementation of ET in practice.

The previous absence of such a theoretical foundation in 
the exploration of ET implementation, like in the broader 
psychotherapy implementation literature (Williams & Bei-
das, 2019), has created a body of evidence with competing 
ideas, hindering the translation of evidence into improved 
practice.  For  example,  whilst  training  in  ET  appears  a 
promising method of improving knowledge, attitudes, and 
self-efficacy (Trivasse et al., 2020), training alone does not 
translate directly to behaviour change (Cucciare et al., 2008; 
Kemp, 2019), due to the influence of several other factors 
(Godin et al., 2008). As such, the use of implementation 
science, and the TDF specifically, to identify, prioritise, 
and synthesise implementation determinants, will assist to 
close the research-practice gap by identifying clear targets 
for intervention (Ogden & Fixsen, 2014).

The Current Review

To date, explorations of the determinants of ET implemen-
tation in routine practice have been largely atheoretical and 
rarely examined if determinants differ across client presenta-
tions (i.e., anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD) and develop-
mental subgroups (i.e., youth and adults). To address these 
limitations, this systematic review aimed to synthesise the 
existing evidence on the determinants of ET implementation 
for treating anxiety-related presentations across the lifespan 
guided by the TDF, including identifying theoretical gaps 
for future research.

Objectives of the Review

One primary review question was explored with three sec-
ondary questions. Specifically, which domains of the Theo-
retical Domains Framework are related to the implementa-
tion of exposure therapy by mental health clinicians in the 
treatment of anxiety-related presentations?

1.  How do these domains differ between anxiety disorders 
(i.e.,  separation  anxiety  disorder,  selective  mutism, 
specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, 
agoraphobia, generalised anxiety disorder), obsessive-
compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder?
2.  How do these domains differ between youth (i.e., ≤ 17 
years old) and adults (i.e., ≥ 18 years old) with anxiety-
related presentations?

3.  Which domains remain unexplored or underexplored as 
possible determinants of exposure therapy implementa-
tion in the current literature?

Methods

The protocol for this review was prospectively registered 
(CRD42022308100) on PROSPERO (Centre for Reviews 
and Dissemination, 2023). The search and reporting were 
conducted in accordance the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) state-
ment (Page et al., 2021).

Search Strategy

Search terms and their synonyms addressing implementa-
tion, ET, and client presentations were combined into a sin-
gle search query, alongside appropriate subject headings. 
The search strategy was then piloted in APA PsycInfo and 
then refined. Relevant databases (APA PsycInfo [Ovid], 

CINAHL  Complete  [EBSCO],  Embase,  ProQuest,  Pub-
Med, Scopus, and Web of Science) and a search engine 
(Google Scholar) were searched in May 2023. Where possi-
ble, searches were limited to results that were peer-reviewed 
and  in  the  English  language.  All  results  were  recorded 
from scholarly databases, whilst Google Scholar results 
were recorded until saturation (i.e., 800 results; Haddaway 
et al., 2015a). A detailed search translation summary for 
each database and search engine can be found in Online 
Resource 1. Record duplicates were automatically removed 
using EndNote, before been imported into the systematic 
review data management tool, Covidence (2023), which 
automatically removed further duplicates. To identify other 
relevant studies, prior and derivative works for eligible stud-
ies were searched using Connected Papers (2023) which uses 
machine learning based on co-citation and bibliographic 
coupling.

Eligibility Criteria

Studies were included if they: (a) operationalised ET within 
a CBT theoretical orientation; (b) assessed the implementa-
tion of any form of ET (i.e., as a therapeutic approach; not 
solely a resource or workbook) as a distinct modality by 
mental health clinicians (including student clinicians com-
pleting relevant practical clinical training) for anxiety, OCD, 
or PTSD; (c) reported primary quantitative data on how a 
variable related to the actual implementation of ET (i.e., 
utilisation; not adherence, efficacy, or effectiveness) using 
inferential statistics; (d) were published in a peer-reviewed 
journal; and, (e) were written in the English language. Stud-
ies were excluded if they: (a) constituted grey literature 
(i.e., abstracts, books or book chapters, commentaries, dis-
sertations, editorials, letters, and presentations); (b) were a 
secondary review of one or more primary studies; (c) were 
a case study, case series, or N of 1 design; or (d) had an 
unavailable full-text. No date restrictions were applied. For 
all inclusions, Ulrich’s Periodicals Directory was used to 
confirm publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Selection Process

Eligibility criteria were independently piloted by two review-
ers on subsets of relevant records (Büchter et al., 2020). Ini-
tially, the eligibility criteria were piloted by the reviewers 
on the first 5% of records in the titles and abstract screening 
phase. These criteria were then piloted by the reviewers on 
10% of the records screened in the full-text phase. Following 
each step, discrepancies were discussed, resolved, and the 
criteria refined to maximise accuracy. Additional rounds of 
full-text screening of 10% of the records were completed 
until 100% agreement was attained signifying the primary 
reviewer had consistent interpretation and application of the 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2024) 27:317–341 

321

selection criteria. The primary reviewer then independently 
engaged in a two-stage eligibility screening of the remain-
ing (a) titles and abstracts and (b) full-texts, with ineligible 
records excluded at each stage.

Data Extraction and Quality Appraisal

The data extraction form and quality appraisal tool were 
independently piloted in the same manner as the eligibility 
criteria. No discrepancies were identified between the two 
reviewers. The data items extracted from the included papers 
were the study’s citation information, focus (e.g., aim, ther-
apy), research design, sample (including presentation and 
developmental subgroup), and results on ET implementa-
tion (i.e., measures, analyses, and results). Each result was 
coded to a client presentation (i.e., anxiety disorders, OCD, 
or PTSD), developmental subgroup (i.e., youth or adults), 
and TDF domain. Results that could not be coded to a sin-
gle presentation, developmental subgroup, or TDF domain 
either because they covered multiple groups or were unspec-
ified were coded as anxiety-related presentations, lifespan, 
or unclassified, respectively. These codes were defined in a 
coding manual, with TDF domains guided by their original 
conceptualisation, definitions, and constructs (Cane et al., 
2012). Some constructs (e.g., negative beliefs about ET) 
overlapped with several domains but were allocated to a 
single, dominant domain (e.g., beliefs about consequences).
Given  the  wide  array  of  designs  deemed  relevant  to 
the review questions, the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool 
(MMAT; Hong et al., 2018) was used by the two reviewers 
to independently appraise the quality of each study across 
two universal screening questions and five core criteria that 
are specific to each design (i.e., quantitative randomised 
controlled trials, quantitative non-randomised, quantitative 
descriptive, and mixed-methods; Hong et al., 2018). The 
number of the five core design-specific criteria met on the 
MMAT were used to calculate a percentage indicative of 
overall quality, which was categorised as very low (i.e., ≤ 
20%), low (i.e., 40%), moderate (i.e., 60%), high (i.e., 80%), 
and very high (i.e., 100%).

Individual Results and Synthesis

The quantity and characteristics of included studies were 
summarised alongside the quality appraisal, using descrip-
tive statistics. Informed by a pragmatic research philosophy 
and the heterogeneity of the results identified, as well as 
to assist the identification of theoretical gaps in the litera-
ture, the quantity of studies and results exploring each TDF 
domain per presentation and developmental subgroups were 
narratively synthesised. Using established guidelines (Rodg-
ers et al., 2009) the quality appraisal of the included studies 
was summarised. The extracted results were then tabulated 

and grouped using the TDF domains. Under each presen-
tation (i.e., anxiety disorders, OCD, PTSD, and anxiety-
related presentations) and developmental subgroup (i.e., 
youth and adults), the body of results were organised from 
the most to least explored domains, with constructs under 
each described with reference to the consistency of results 
of statistical significance regarding their relationship with 
ET use. When a single study presented multiple results (e.g., 
for different ET variants) relevant to the same construct, 
presentation, and developmental subgroup, these were tabu-
lated together, and the construct was recorded as related if 
any of the relationships were significant. Additionally, uni-
variate and multivariate analyses of the same relationship 
were collapsed and only the multivariate result was used. No 
arbitrary cut-offs were used for the classification of results 
based on the percentage of significant results to avoid over-
simplifying the literature by underemphasising important 
variations (Haddaway et al., 2015a, 2015b) including het-
erogeneity in the constructs explored.

Results

Included Studies

The search retrieved 22,430 records, of which 12,565 were 
duplicates. After title and abstract screening, a further 9,685 
records were excluded. The remaining 180 full-texts were 
screened, of which 133 were excluded, leaving 47 included 
studies. These studies were entered into Connected Papers 
(2023) producing 936 related records, of which 647 were 
duplicates  and  26  were  already  included  in  the  review. 
Screening the remaining 263 resulted in five additional rel-
evant studies. Thus, 52 studies were included in this review 
(see Fig. 1).

Study Characteristics and Quality Appraisal

The characteristics of the included studies are summarised 
in Table 1 (see Online Resource 2 for detailed character-
istics). Over half of the studies (n = 28) were quantitative 
descriptive designs (e.g., surveys), 12 used a quantitative 
non-randomised design (e.g., cohort studies), seven were 
quantitative randomized controlled trials, and five utilised 
mixed-methods (e.g., convergent designs). All studies were 
conducted in high-income Westernised countries, i.e., the 
United States (n = 33), Europe (n = 11), Australia and New 
Zealand (n = 7), and the United States and United Kingdom 
(n = 1). Half of the studies examined determinants in spe-
cific diagnostic presentations (i.e., PTSD [n = 20], anxiety 
disorders [n = 3], OCD [n = 3]), while the remainder used 
mixed anxiety-related disorder samples (n = 26) and only 
six of these stratified their results into specific presentations.

Over half examined determinants in either adult (n = 19; all 
unspecified age ranges) or youth clients (n = 11; ages ranged 
from 7 to 17 years), with the remaining related to clients 
across the lifespan (n = 22). Studies included samples of 
clinicians (n = 42; samples sizes ranged from 24 to 1,034), 
clients (n = 3; samples sizes ranged from 554 to 265,566), 
or  clinicians  and  clients  (n  =  7;  clinician  sample  sizes 
ranged from 4 to 103; client sample sizes ranged from 25 to 
242). The samples of clinicians tended to be mostly female 
(frequencies ranged from 60% to 100%) and psychologists 
(frequencies ranged from 14% to 100%). Only ten samples 
were reported where another profession (e.g., social workers, 
counsellors, therapists) had greater representation than psy-
chologists. Most studies (77%) utilised self-report to assess 
ET use; the remainder (21%) reviewed client records or ses-
sion recordings, while one quantified interview responses.

The  quality  appraisal  of  included  studies  is  found  in 
Online Resource 3. The quality of the studies varied greatly, 
although two-thirds possessed at least moderate quality (60% 
of criteria met). Specifically, seven studies possessed very 
low, 11 low, 17 moderate, 15 high, and two very high meth-
odological quality. The most frequently identified quality 
issues for each design included assessors not being blind to 
the condition (71% of quantitative randomised controlled 
designs), that samples were unrepresentative of the target 
population (58% of quantitative non-randomised designs), 

a  high  likelihood  of  response  bias  (89%  of  quantitative 
descriptive designs), and that either the quantitative or quali-
tative methodological component of mixed-method studies 
were of poor quality (all mixed-method designs).

Results Synthesised by Theoretical Domains 
Framework Domains

The original TDF domains are presented in Table 2, with 
the operationalisation of each domain for this review and 
the coded constructs. The frequency of results per TDF 
domain, by presentation and developmental subgroup are 
presented and described below and are presented in Online 
Resource 4. For further detail, the domains explored in each 
study are presented in Online Resource 5 and the individual 
results are summarised in Online Resource 6. Most results 
(n = 389) were mapped to the TDF. All domains were rep-
resented except for optimism, reinforcement, and memory, 
attention, and decision processes. Four domains (knowl-
edge, social/professional role and identity, beliefs about 
consequences, and environmental context and resources) 
accounted for 70% of the mapped results, whilst the least 
represented domain was behavioural regulation. Social/pro-
fessional role and identity and environmental context and 
resources appear to be particular focuses of the existing liter-
ature, with each contributing over one-fifth of results. Most

Note.  Lifespan  is  defined  as  unspecified  developmental  subgroups  or  a  combination  of  youth  and  adult  developmental  subgroups.  Anxiety-
related presentations are defined as an unspecified or specified combination of anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD.
a  These studies were defined as relevant to youth, not lifespan, due to the predominant age-range of the sample.
b  This article reported on three separate but related studies. Only the results of the third study were relevant to this review and were extracted and 
appraised.

other domains (skills, beliefs about capabilities, intentions, 
goals, social influences, and emotion) attracted at most 8% 
of results from the existing literature. Within each domain, 
there was considerable variability in the operationalisation 
and measurement of constructs, as seen in Table 2. Five 
results (e.g., positive attitudes towards multiple components 
of evidence-based practice) could not be classified to the 
TDF as they assessed a range of domains. This uneven rep-
resentation also affected how presentations and developmen-
tal subgroups were explored with PTSD (46%) representing 
over three times more results than anxiety disorders (14%) 
and OCD (11%), and adult samples (44%) contributing over 
two times more results than youth (20%).

Presentations

The spread of results across domains of the TDF, per pres-
entation, is presented in Figure 2.

Anxiety Disorders

Fifty-five results from 10 studies explored the use of ET 
for anxiety disorders. All of these studies used low qual-
ity, descriptive or non-randomised designs, with only one 
study rated as good quality. Overall, this subset of literature 
only met 54% MMAT criteria, which approximates moderate 
quality. Over half of the results (58%) pertained to clients 
from across the lifespan, with the remainder using samples 
of youth (18%) and adults (24%). Emotion was the most fre-
quently explored domain. Five results exploring client’s anx-
ious symptoms and suggested they were unrelated to ET use, 
whilst results examining other client emotions (e.g., depres-
sive symptoms) and clinician emotions (e.g., anxiety) were 
too few to draw meaningful conclusions. In contrast, ten 
results examined the domain of knowledge (i.e., unspecified 
ET training, knowledge of ET) and widely found positive 
relationships with ET use. Likewise, ten results examined 
clinicians’ beliefs about consequences of ET (including both 
perceived risks and credibility) and were frequently associ-
ated with ET implementation, in particular, more negative 
beliefs about ET were associated with less use in five results.
Both the domains of social/professional role and identity, 
and environmental context and resources were investigated, 
but examined a broad range of constructs were examined. 
This resulted in the inability to draw meaningful conclu-
sions. Trends suggested that most results categorised under 
both social/professional role and identity and environmen-
tal context and resources were unrelated or inconsistently 
related to ET use. The exceptions, however, were clinician 
age and perceived practical barriers to ET use, which tended 
to be negatively related to implementation, whereas current 
frequency of exposure to anxiety presentations appeared to 
be positively related.

skills, social influences, beliefs about capabilities, inten-
tions, or goals, with limited results. Trends suggested that 
clinicians’ self-efficacy and willingness to use ET, personal 
preference for ET, and experience treating anxiety presenta-
tions tended to be positively related to ET use. A result that 
was unable to be classified to one theoretical domain found 
that more barriers (ranging in focus from resources to con-
sequences) perceived by clinicians to ET use was negatively 
related to use (Reid et al., 2017).

OCD

Forty-four results from eight studies related to ET use for 
the treatment of OCD. On average these studies met 60% 
of MMAT criteria which is indicative of moderate quality. 
However, six studies used descriptive designs, including 
surveys, thus a high proportion of results came from low 
quality studies with significant risk of bias. Like with anxi-
ety disorders, most results (57%) came from clients from 
across the lifespan, with the rest pertaining to youth (32%) 

or adults (11%). The largest proportion of results related to 
social/professional role and identity and a broad range of 
constructs were examined (e.g., client and clinician demo-
graphics, clinician therapeutic theoretical orientation). This 
resulted in a low volume of results examining similar con-
structs and a lack of meaningful trends. Whilst most demo-
graphics appeared unrelated to ET use, client age tended to 
be negatively related to ET use, whilst being a psychologist 
or specialising in anxiety was seemingly positively related to 
ET use. Under the domain of knowledge, there were incon-
sistent results related to unspecified ET training, whilst a 
single result suggested knowledge of ET was positively 
related to its use.

The less frequently explored domains (i.e., skills, beliefs 
about consequences, emotion, environmental context and 
resources,  social  influences,  beliefs  about  capabilities, 
intentions, and goals) were characterised by constructs that 
were only examined in one or two results, therefore lim-
iting the conclusions that can be drawn from each. These 
trends indicated that general clinical experience, experience 

330 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2024) 27:317–341

treating  OCD,  amount  of  supervision,  and  supervisor’s 
recommendations to use ET may be unrelated to ET use. 
Negative beliefs about ET tended to be negatively related 
to use in three results, as was clinicians’ avoidance of ET in 
one result. Self-efficacy, willingness, and a personal prefer-
ence to use ET trended toward positively related to ET use. 
Current frequency of exposure to anxiety presentations was 
inconsistently related to ET use. An unclassified result found 
that more barriers (ranging in focus from resources to con-
sequences) perceived by clinicians to ET use is negatively 
related to use (Reid et al., 2017).

PTSD

Twenty-five studies reported 181 results related to ET use for 
PTSD. On average these studies met 50% of MMAT criteria 
which approximated moderate quality. However, several of 
these studies analysed clinical notes documenting ET use, 
reducing the biases of self-report. Most of the results (78%) 
examined ET use in adults who were military personnel or 
veterans, which significantly reduces the generalisability of 
findings to the general community. Only a small subset of 
results pertained to youth (4%) and clients from across the 
lifespan (17%).

Social/professional role and identity was the most fre-
quently examined domain and included constructs such as 
client and clinician demographics, client military service, 
and clinician profession or therapeutic theoretical orienta-
tion. Key results indicated that clinicians’ gender as male 
was positively related to ET use, their therapeutic theoretical 
orientation was unrelated, and results for clinician profes-
sion and client demographics (i.e., relationship status and 
race) were inconsistent. Other constructs were examined in 
too few results to draw conclusions. Studies also frequently 
examined environmental context and resources, measuring 
different constructs including organisational characteristics, 
exposure to presentations, client comorbidities, and avail-
ability of exposure resources. Whilst most constructs were 
only explored in a limited number of results, key trends 
emerged including that current frequency of exposure to 
anxiety and PTSD presentations was seemingly positively 
related to ET use, whilst demands on residential treatment 
programmes was unrelated, and results examining clinician 
workload and clients’ residence relative to urban centres 
were inconsistent.

A substantial twenty-five results also explored the domain 
of beliefs about consequences. Whilst clinicians’ perceptions 
of the utility of prolonged exposure was positively related to 
ET use, negative beliefs on ET were negatively related. Sev-
eral other constructs were examined in two or less results, 
with one suggesting that the perceived effectiveness of cog-
nitive processing therapy was negatively related to ET use. 
Under the domain of knowledge, unspecified imaginal and 

prolonged exposure training was positively related to ET 
use whilst unspecified ET training had inconsistent results. 
The remaining domains of beliefs about capabilities, social 
influences,  skills,  goals,  emotion, and intentions and the 
constructs within them were only examined to a minimal 
extent, preventing conclusions from being drawn. Trends 
suggested that self-efficacy using ET, leadership articulating 
goals to implement prolonged exposure, weekly telephone 
consultations with prolonged exposure experts, experience 
treating PTSD, practical training for prolonged exposure, 
and intention to implement prolonged exposure appear posi-
tively related to ET use. Whilst clinical experience, experi-
ence with ET, and clinician anxiety tended to be unrelated 
to ET use, results examining self-efficacy using prolonged 
exposure were inconsistent. Three unclassified results that 
could not be classified to one theoretical domain reported 
that clinicians making more adaptations to prolonged expo-
sure, holding more positive attitudes towards evidence-based 
practice, and perceiving more barriers (ranging in focus 
from resources to consequences) to ET use were all unre-
lated to ET use.

Anxiety‑Related Presentations

Twenty-one studies presented 114 results exploring the use 
of ET for anxiety-related presentations. Whilst the overall 
quality of this literature was moderate (i.e., 60% of MMAT 
criteria met), one-third of the studies utilised a higher qual-
ity design (i.e., quantitative non-randomised [e.g., repeated 
measures] or randomised design), thus improving the ability 
to examine relationships between variables. Nevertheless, 
this body of evidence failed to stratify the results based on 
client presentations which significantly limits their general-
isability. Most results came from clients across the lifespan 
(49%), with a subset from youth (39%) and adults (11%). 
The domain of environmental context and resources was 
the most frequently examined with results reporting that cli-
ent’s possessing an anxiety or OCD diagnosis was positively 
related to ET use, whilst a broad anxiety-related presentation 
was unrelated, and results on a PTSD diagnosis were incon-
sistent. Organisational climate or culture was unrelated to 
ET use, whilst clinician workload was inconsistent. Beliefs 
about consequences was also frequently examined; negative 
beliefs about ET were negatively related to ET use. Other 
constructs were infrequently examined and thus conclusions 
were unable to be drawn.

Under  the  domain  of  knowledge,  many  constructs 
were investigated (e.g., knowledge of mechanisms of ET, 
knowledge of ET). Six results explored the relationship 
of unspecified ET training to ET use, reporting no rela-
tionship. Likewise, results under the social/professional 
role and identity (e.g., client and clinician demographics, 
clinician profession) and emotion domains (e.g., clinician 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2024) 27:317–341 

331

stress, client anxiety) were inconsistent (e.g., for clinician 
therapeutic theoretical orientation and anxiety). Similar 
issues hindered conclusions being drawn from the results 
categorised under the social influences (e.g., organisational 
culture, supervision) and skills domains (e.g., self-report 
expertise in parent-coached ET, online practical training 
in ET) although clinicians’ attachment styles and general 
clinical experience were unrelated to ET use based on four 
results. The remaining domains (i.e., goals, beliefs about 
capabilities, intentions, and behavioural regulation) were 
less frequently examined and most results could not be 
sensibly grouped thus limiting the generalisability of the 
trends. However, trends suggested that self-efficacy using 
ET appeared to be positively related to its use. Clinicians 
who endorsed a higher willingness to use evidence-based 
practice if required to tended to use ET less. Interventions 
aimed at improving motivation to use ET (e.g., motiva-
tional interviewing calls) and the self-reported divergence 
between evidence-based and current practices appeared to 
be unrelated to ET use. The results on the use of relaxation 
techniques were inconsistent.

Developmental Subgroups

The  spread  of  results  across  domains  of  the  TDF,  per 
developmental subgroup, is presented in Figure 3.

Youth

Eleven studies reported 77 results that focused on ET use in 
the treatment of youth. Nearly half of these studies utilised 
a higher quality non-randomised (e.g., repeated measures) 
or randomised study design, whilst the remaining two-thirds 
(which produced most of the results) utilised a descriptive 
design. On average 62% of MMAT criteria were met sug-
gesting high quality. However, sampling bias and the use 
of self-reported ET use dominated this body of evidence. 
Most of the results pertained to anxiety-related presentation 
(58%) with the remainder relatively evenly split between 
exploring OCD (18%), anxiety disorders (13%), and PTSD 
(10%). Social/professional role and identity was the most 
frequently  explored  domain  and  whilst  some  constructs 
(e.g., clinician age and profession) were only explored in 
one result, other constructs were examined more frequently. 
Clinician gender was unrelated to ET use, whilst results for 
other constructs (e.g., therapeutic theoretical orientation, 
specialisation in anxiety, education) were inconsistent. The 
domain of environmental context and resources was also 
frequently examined, but a wide range of constructs were 
investigated (e.g., workforce size, working in an integrated 
health setting, workload). This prevented the formation of 
meaningful conclusions. Trends suggested that an anxiety or 
OCD diagnosis and working in an anxiety speciality clinic 
may be associated with greater ET use, whilst organisational

culture, workforce size, and the client’s initial impairment 
due to anxiety may be unrelated.

In comparison, results in the beliefs about consequences 
domain did provide some insights, including that negative 
beliefs about ET and perceived risks of ET for youth are 
related to less ET use. Likewise, results exploring emotion 
(e.g., clinician anxiety, depression, and stress; anxiety and 
disgust sensitivity) were frequently unrelated to ET use. 
Results exploring the knowledge domain which explored 
unspecified ET training were inconsistent, whilst in the skills 
domain, general clinical experience was unrelated to ET 
use. The remaining domains (i.e., goals, social influences, 
behavioural regulation, beliefs about capabilities, and inten-
tions) were infrequently examined, thus limiting the ability 
to draw any meaningful inferences. Trends suggested that 
an organisational culture of implementation, the perceived 
resilience of children with anxiety, and openness to innova-
tion appeared to be positively related to ET use, whilst those 
clinicians who used more anxiety management strategies or 
who endorsed a higher willingness to use evidence-based 
practice if required to were also less likely to use ET. Three 
results that could not be classified to one theoretical domain 
indicated that more barriers (ranging in focus from resources 
to consequences) perceived by clinicians to ET use produced 
inconsistent results (Reid et al., 2017).

Adults

Nineteen studies reported 173 results that related to the 
use of ET for the treatment of adults. Overall, the litera-
ture was of moderate quality with an average of 55% of the 
MMAT criteria met. However, the vast majority of these 
studies (82%) explored this within the treatment of clients 
with  PTSD,  relative  to  anxiety  disorders  (8%),  anxiety-
related presentations (8%), and OCD (3%). The social/pro-
fessional role and identity and environmental context and 
resources domains accounted for over half of the results. A 
large number of variable constructs were classified to the 
former domain, including clinician demographics and cli-
ent military service. Most of these could not be aggregated. 
However, the clinicians’ profession and therapeutic theo-
retical orientation, and client demographics had inconsist-
ent results pertaining to ET use. This pattern was observed 
for the environmental context and resources domain where 
constructs investigated included organisational character-
istics, exposure to presentation, client comorbidities, and 
availability of exposure resources. Findings indicated that 
current frequency of exposure to anxiety and PTSD pres-
entations and working within a PTSD speciality clinic were 
positively related to ET use, whilst demands on residential 
treatment programmes was unrelated, and clinician work-
load and the geographic location of the clients’ residence 
relative to urban centres were inconsistent.

Findings classified under the beliefs about consequences 
domain  were  more  homogeneous,  particularly  explor-
ing the utility of prolonged exposure and negative beliefs 
about ET, which were positively and negatively related to 
ET use, respectively. Insufficient evidence existed on other 
constructs (e.g., outcome expectancies, perceived effective-
ness of other techniques, perceived risks) thus conclusions 
could not be made. Other constructs across several other 
domains were also limited by little evidence. In the social 
influences domain (e.g., leadership articulating implemen-
tation goals, weekly telephone consultation with prolonged 
exposure  experts,  social  network,  therapeutic  alliance), 
suggested the clinician’s attachment style was unrelated to 
ET use. In the knowledge domain (e.g., knowledge of ET 
mechanisms, unspecified CBT training) unspecified pro-
longed exposure training was positively related to ET use, 
whilst two unspecified ET training results were inconsistent. 
Within the emotion domain (e.g., clients’ depressive symp-
toms and distress), clients’ anxious symptoms were unre-
lated to ET use. Constructs across the remaining domains 
(i.e., beliefs about capabilities, goals, skills, and intentions) 
were rarely explored. Trends indicated that self-efficacy 
using prolonged exposure, general clinical experience, and 
openness and drive to adopt prolonged exposure appeared to 
be unrelated to ET use, whilst greater self-efficacy receiving 
referrals for prolonged exposure and intentions to implement 
prolonged exposure tended to be associated with more ET 
use. Two results, which could not be classified to one theo-
retical domain indicated that clinicians’ adaptations made 
to prolonged exposure and their positive attitudes towards 
evidence-based practices appeared to be unrelated to ET use.

Discussion

This review addressed the paucity of synthesised evidence 
on the determinants of ET use, by systematically identify-
ing evidence on ET use across anxiety-related presentations 
and developmental subgroups using an implementation sci-
ence framework - the TDF. This review aimed to determine 
whether differences existed between these anxiety-related 
presentations (i.e., anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD) and 
developmental subgroups (i.e., youth and adults), whilst 
identifying potential determinants of ET use that remain 
unexplored.  These  findings  may  provide  a  theoretically 
cohesive guide for future explorations of this research-prac-
tice gap and the development of interventions to address it.

Characteristics and Quality of the Existing Literature

Whilst the body of evidence spanned 52 studies across 19 
years, it was dominated by studies with important limita-
tions. Notably, descriptive study designs were prolific in 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2024) 27:317–341 

333

the literature and were conducted entirely in high-income 
Western countries, severely limiting the ability to generalise 
findings to jurisdictions with alternate training and health-
care systems. Additionally, over half of the studies did not 
explore ET implementation in specific client presentations 
and/or developmental subgroups, limiting the generalisabil-
ity of the results to specific treatment contexts. Overall, most 
included studies were of moderate quality or better, but had 
unrepresentative samples and a high risk of response bias. 
For example, several studies recruited participants from pop-
ulations who likely possessed an increased underlying inter-
est in ET, such as those interested in training, psychologists 
who received specialty therapeutic training, members of 
cognitive-behavioural associations, and clinicians working 
in specialty anxiety clinics. Whilst these samples are easily 
accessible, recruitment of individuals with a potential bias 
for ET has limited the understanding of the determinants 
of ET implementation to those most likely to implement it. 
These characteristics have limited the quality of the conclu-
sions that can be drawn from the literature and generalised 
to routine clinical care.

The Determinants of ET Implementation Across 
the TDF

Although a multitude of implementation science frame-
works exist and are utilised for various reasons (Birken et al., 
2017b), the TDF was selected to synthesise the evidence 
as its focuses on understanding provider behaviour and can 
inform the development of targeted interventions that align 
to each domain (Birken et al., 2017b). The TDF fulfilled 
this purpose as a useful framework for collating the existing 
evidence and illuminating the spread of evidence across the 
theoretical domains. Whilst the TDF aligned with the aim 
of the current review, future applications of implementation 
science frameworks to explorations of ET implementation 
in both primary and secondary research should carefully 
consider the purpose, conceptual level, theoretical heritage, 
and operationalisability of the framework chosen to ensure 
appropriate frameworks are selected (Birken et al., 2017a).
Overall, nearly 400 results were identified that evalu-
ated clinician, client, and system variables on the imple-
mentation of ET. Evidence was classified into most of the 
TDF domains, however a subset of domains (i.e., knowl-
edge, social/professional role and identity, beliefs about 
consequences, and environmental context and resources) 
accounted for the majority of research to date. Targeting 
domains relating to knowledge and beliefs makes intuitive 
sense, and interventions that have addressed these domains 
have produced results indicating moderate improvements in 
ET use (Trivasse et al., 2020). Most notably, through the 
provision of training (Frank et al., 2020). However, knowl-
edge and beliefs about consequences are only two of the 14 

TDF domains. The domains of optimism, reinforcement, and 
memory, attention, and decision processes are unexplored 
in relation to ET use and warrant consideration given their 
theoretical relevance to healthcare providers implementa-
tion behaviours (Cane et al., 2012; Michie et al., 2005). In 
addition, within domains there were typically a range of 
variables explored. This meant that most constructs were 
examined by one or two findings. Due to this low volume 
of evidence, there was limited ability to draw meaningful 
conclusions across many constructs. These small bodies of 
evidence could be attributed to an unintuitive relationship 
between the constructs (e.g., clients’ relationship status) 
and ET use, or the under exploration of seemingly relevant 
variables (e.g., primary diagnosis, session length). It is vital 
future research equally dedicate resources to examining all 
relevant  variables  across  the  full  spectrum  of  domains, 
including capturing practical issues identified by clinicians 
delivering or attempting to implement ET in routine care. 
Nevertheless, there were some domains and constructs that 
were examined across several results that allowed conclu-
sions to be drawn across client presentations and develop-
mental subgroups, and are discussed, as relevant, below.

The Determinants of ET Implementation Across 
Presentations and Developmental Subgroups

Some domains and constructs demonstrated consistent find-
ings across presentations, whilst others varied. An example 
of the former was clinician beliefs about ET which consist-
ently related to its use in treating clients across all presenta-
tions. Specifically, clinicians who held positive beliefs about 
the consequences of ET, including its benefits and risks, 
were more likely to use it in their practice. These relation-
ships have been suggested in primary studies and in com-
mentaries on the issue (Blakey et al., 2018; Olatunji et al., 
2009) which has likely resulted in the disproportionately 
high focus on this domain. In contrast, whilst knowledge, 
in the form of unspecified ET training, related to ET use for 
anxiety disorders, this was not apparent for OCD or PTSD. 
However, unspecified training in imaginal and prolonged 
exposure was positively related to ET use for PTSD. This 
suggests  that  whilst  general  ET  training  can  encourage 
uptake for clients with anxiety disorders that are treated 
using foundational ET techniques, for more complex pres-
entations like OCD and PTSD, additional specialised train-
ing covering disorder-specific techniques may be required 
to promote the use of ET. Furthermore, contextual factors 
including the clinician’s exposure to specific anxiety presen-
tations and practical (e.g., role-plays, simulated cases) dis-
order-specific training, particularly in the context of PTSD, 
were positively associated with the use of ET. Whilst a small 
number of findings suggested that clinician age, as well as 
client age and female gender are negatively related to ET 

334 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2024) 27:317–341

use in specific presentations or developmental subgroups, 
more exploration is required to determine if these relation-
ships are direct or are products of extraneous variables like 
the therapeutic drift throughout a career (Waller & Turner, 
2016) or the level of risk clinician’s perceive when using ET 
for certain demographics based on their assumptions around 
that demographics’ resiliency (e.g., Whiteside et al., 2016a, 
2016b). The presence of such differences in the consistency 
of determinants of ET implementation across client presen-
tations only emphasises the need for future research to treat 
these as truly distinct implementation contexts.

When  considering  developmental  subgroups,  similar 
trends emerged with a few key nuanced differences. For 
instance, unique negative beliefs about the impact of ET on 
youth appeared to be related to less use of ET for the treat-
ment of this demographic. Findings suggested this may be 
compounded by concerns on the resiliency of anxious chil-
dren. In contrast, for adults, especially in military or veteran 
populations, factors such as working within PTSD specialty 
clinics and experience with anxiety or PTSD presentations 
were positively related to ET use. Apart from these differ-
ences, the scarcity of research exploring specific develop-
mental subgroups, especially youth has hampered the ability 
to distinguish important trends between these groups. Across 
the lifespan, beliefs about ET and its consequences, as well 
as specific training in ET were key factors that support its 
application. These patterns suggest that targeted interven-
tions (e.g., practical disorder-specific training) to improve 
clinician knowledge, beliefs, and skills could increase the 
adoption of ET across presentations and developmental sub-
groups. Overall, it is vital the literature more evenly dedicate 
resources to exploring ET implementation across develop-
mental subgroups, whilst respecting their uniqueness.

Underexplored Determinants of ET Implementation Across 
the TDF

The results of this review have highlighted several areas for 
future research. Foremost, it has identified several domains 
on the TDF where future research should focus to improve 
our understanding of the determinants of ET implementa-
tion. Such research should consider focusing on the deter-
minants where there is conflicting evidence or a paucity of 
evidence to clarify relationships, and explore determinants 
theoretically linked to utilisation in implementation theories. 
For instance, the role of reinforcement (including incentives 
and other contingencies) has not been explored in relation 
to ET implementation, where doing so may maximise the 
benefits  of  this  interventions.  For  example,  understand-
ing the relationship between making access to government 
rebates contingent upon providing evidence-based practices, 
including potential moderators (e.g., clinicians’ sentiments; 
Rieckmann et al., 2011), will ultimately help maximise any 

improvements in uptake. Whilst the relationship between ET 
use and reinforcement seems relatively intuitive, the roles of 
other underexplored determinants such as optimism, behav-
ioural regulation, and memory, attention, and decision pro-
cesses are equally important. For example, the proliferation 
of findings linking beliefs about ET as an important determi-
nant of its implementation throughout the literature suggests 
that a clinician’s attitudes are central to their implementa-
tion behaviour. This suggests that their general disposition 
toward viewing the anticipated outcome of events either 
positively or negatively (i.e., optimism; Cane et al., 2012) 
likely has important implications for their implementation 
behaviour. Exploring the potential role of such determinants 
is important, not only because it may help identify areas 
for direct intervention, for example by improving optimism 
(Malouff  &  Schutte, 2017),  but  may  encourage  indirect 
intervention in other areas like clinician burnout (Bell et al., 
2024). Such examples, highlight the need for thorough and 
considered investigations into factors that influence clini-
cians’ ET implementation behaviour.

Implications for Improving the Implementation 
of ET in Practice

Given the patterns and differences across presentations and 
developmental subgroups outlined above, there are broad 
practical implications for improving ET uptake. Indeed, 
implementation determinants identified using the TDF 
can inform targeted interventions (Atkins et al., 2017) 
using the BCW, through their shared foundation (Michie 
et al., 2014)—the underlying COM-B model of behav-
iour (Michie et al., 2011). The COM-B model conceptu-
alises volitional behaviour as generated by an interaction 
between an individual’s capability, opportunity, and moti-
vation, which are in turn influenced by behaviour. Along-
side the BCW, the TDF provides an empirically supported 
framework  to  assess  determinants  of  ET  use,  that  will 
enable future researchers to select, tailor, and implement 
interventions to improve it—important steps in translating 
knowledge into action (Graham et al., 2006) and improving 
the uptake of ET in the treatment of anxiety-related pres-
entations. Given the prevalence of anxiety-related presen-
tations (Kessler et al., 2012), clinicians’ opportunities to 
use ET are high, and the results from this review suggest 
that those clinicians more frequently exposed to relevant 
presentations in practice are indeed more likely to use ET. 
Additional steps can be taken, for example the reduction of 
practical barriers to ET may be warranted by structuring 
the social and physical environment within mental health 
services to facilitate the opportunity to practice ET in rou-
tine care, such as ensuring appropriate spaces and time are 
provided to conduct ET and clinicians have ready access to 
the necessary resources and support. Furthermore, service 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2024) 27:317–341 

335

provision changes, such as incorporating ET as a standard 
component of care for anxiety-related presentations, can 
ensure that clinicians have the opportunity within their 
organisation to apply ET.

As suggested above, improving clinicians’ capabilities 
and motivation to use ET is perhaps the more pressing issue. 
Our results demonstrate that providing specific and practi-
cal education (e.g., simulation-based learning experiences), 
that is tailored to different presentations of anxiety disor-
ders, OCD, PTSD, and other anxiety-related presentations 
(Harned et al., 2014; Sherrill et al., 2021) is necessary. This 
is vital as unspecified ET training dominates the literature 
and is associated with only medium-sized improvements in 
the use of ET (Trivasse et al., 2020). Additionally, training 
must target more than knowledge and skills, for example by 
targeting clinician’s confidence in applying ET or addressing 
misinformation on the benefits and, especially, the risks of 
ET. Such approaches should be integrated within university 
training programmes and as part of continuing professional 
development for mental health clinicians, including within 
large mental health systems, where clinicians commonly 
receive training (Sars & van Minnen, 2015). It is also likely 
that combining interventions, such as training and supervi-
sion, could produce additional gains in ET use, over a sin-
gle intervention. For example, a systematic review of the 
impact of training on clinicians’ knowledge, beliefs, and 
behaviours by Frank and colleagues (2020) indicated that 
although training is helpful for improving knowledge and 
beliefs toward evidence-based practices, they rarely lead 
to increase implementation alone, but are more likely to if 
accompanied by consultation. Combining the benefits of 
interventions is important given that many single interven-
tions, such as those aimed at improving motivation to use 
ET (e.g., motivational interviewing calls), may not influence 
ET use on their own. Addressing motivation is important 
because improving clinicians’ capabilities and opportuni-
ties to implement ET may not be sufficient if motivation is 
low. Additionally, evidence suggests that self-monitoring of 
current practices relative to evidence-based guidelines does 
not predict greater ET use (Becker-Haimes et al., 2017); 
thus the role of clinician motivation, both directly and indi-
rectly, warrants further investigation. To address motivation 
considering interventions such as regulation and legislation 
may be warranted given that clinicians who are less likely 
to use ET contradictorily report a higher willingness to use 
evidence-based practices if they were required to (Becker-
Haimes et al., 2017). Overall, by translating determinants of 
ET use from the literature into theoretically informed behav-
iour change interventions within healthcare systems, govern-
ments, and training providers can, through implementation 
science, create targeted, comprehensive, and evidence-based 
strategies that are more likely to drive sustained behaviour 
change in clinicians. This will ultimately encourage better 

treatment outcomes for clients in need of evidence-based 
treatment, in the form of ET.

Limitations and Directions for Future Research

The current review possesses several limitations common 
in reviews. There is a possibility that relevant studies were 
missed (Gartlehner et al., 2020) but this was minimised by 
undertaking a comprehensive search of seven databases and 
Google Scholar, alongside using Connected Papers to search 
for related records. We limited the search to studies pub-
lished in the English language, as is common (Jackson & 
Kuriyama, 2019), which likely limited research from differ-
ent cultural settings. As recommended by systematic review 
guidelines (Page et al., 2021), the methodological quality 
of the included studies was evaluated, and the MMAT was 
selected to account for a range of study designs. Some study 
designs did not neatly fit those prescribed in the MMAT 
(e.g., Whiteside et al., 2023) and were categorised based 
on their dominant features. This may have resulted in the 
quality appraisal missing important aspects of the designs of 
some included studies. MMAT scores were arbitrarily clas-
sified into very poor, poor, moderate, good, and excellent, 
to concisely describe the methodological quality of a single 
and a group of studies. This approach, of tallying scores for 
individual items to provide a summary score, is variably 
described in the literature (Tod et al., 2022). Other quality 
appraisal tools could have been used and these may have 
provided a different overview of methodological quality or 
risk of bias of the included studies (Katrak et al., 2004). 
Additionally, limitations associated with the evidence must 
also be considered. For example, some studies explored a 
multitude of ET variants which were consolidated for the 
purposes of addressing our review questions. Whilst this 
assisted to gain an understanding of the relationship of the 
extracted determinants with overall ET implementation, 
future research should distinguish the determinants for spe-
cific ET delivery forms (e.g., in vivo, imaginal, in-session, 
homework). Finally, throughout the literature the use of self-
reported ET implementation measures was also problematic, 
as was the self-report measure of other constructs, specifi-
cally under skills where role-plays or clinical observation 
would significantly improve the validity of findings. The use 
of self-reported ET implementation measures also meant 
the relationships identified may not adequately account for 
the influence of shared decision-making, a critical compo-
nent of best-practice psychological intervention (Patel et al., 
2008). Whilst it is widely accepted that clinicians drive the 
underutilisation of ET (Jaeger et al., 2010), it is nevertheless 
important to further understand the contribution of client 
influences, perhaps using qualitative or mixed-methods.

Beyond improving the coverage of theoretical implemen-
tation  determinants  in  the  literature,  this  review  has  also 

336 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2024) 27:317–341

elucidated several other areas for future research. One of the 
primary issues in the literature is that the construct of interest 
being explored as a potential determinant of implementation 
behaviour must be clearly defined using established behav-
iour change taxonomies from implementation science (e.g., the 
Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy; Michie et al., 2013). 
This may require the development of new, psychometrically 
sound measures to identify and differentiate a range of deter-
minants. In addition to this, we also found that many studies 
do not specify the client presentations and age ranges that were 
sampled nor were subgroup analyses conducted. Exploring 
and analysing ET use in a range of specific presentations and 
developmental subgroups will assist to determine how ET use 
can be maximised in the different contexts where the research-
practice gap is present.

Conclusions

Based on existing evidence from 52 studies and nearly 400 
results, it appears clinicians’ negative beliefs about the conse-
quences of ET, including its benefits and risks, are related to 
reduced ET use. This is especially problematic in youth, where 
unique beliefs about its risks, or the capabilities of youth to 
tolerate ET were associated with less use. Whilst knowledge, 
including via unspecified ET training, is positively related to 
ET use for some presentations (i.e., anxiety disorders), this is 
inconsistent between presentations and suggests that training 
specific to complex presentations (i.e., PTSD) and involving 
practical components (e.g., observational learning, supervi-
sion, and competency-based assessment of skills) is more 
likely to improve ET use. Overall, the research undertaken to 
date was able to be classified into the TDF domains and the 
extent to which each domain was investigated varied signifi-
cantly. Optimism, reinforcement, and memory, attention, and 
decision processes are currently unexplored in the context of 
ET implementation, and there is a paucity of research for con-
structs aligned to behavioural regulation. Research has focused 
on specific presentations and developmental subgroups (i.e., 
PTSD and adults) whilst others were under-researched (i.e., 
OCD and youth). Future research should utilise established 
scientific methods for evaluating and improving implemen-
tation to explore a range of determinants, clarify differences 
between presentations and developmental subgroups, and effi-
ciently translate knowledge of the drivers of ET underuse into 
integrative multi-level interventions.

Other Information

Registration and Protocol

Minor amendments were made to the protocol prospectively 
registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022308100) throughout 

the study to maximise the quality of the synthesis produced. 
Given the breadth of available literature, eligibility crite-
ria were refined to exclude lower quality designs (e.g., case 
studies, N of 1), qualitative designs, descriptive results (Daly 
et al., 2007; OCEBM Levels of Evidence Working Group & 
OCEBM Levels of Evidence Working Group, 2011), less 
relevant samples (e.g., students not completing practical 
clinical training), ET variants not operationalised within 
CBT, and studies that solely explored the use of ET work-
books or resources. Given the dominance of cross-sectional 
studies the review questions were altered from identifying 
domains as barriers and facilitators to only determining 
whether domains were related to ET use. Given a lack of 
literature exploring ET implementation in preschoolers, chil-
dren, and adolescents, these developmental subgroups were 
collapsed into youth.
