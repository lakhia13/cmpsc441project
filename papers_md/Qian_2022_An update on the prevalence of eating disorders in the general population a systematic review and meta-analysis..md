Abstract
Objective  To update the prevalence of eating disorders in the general population before 2021 and to analyze the distribution 
characteristics at different times and in different regions and sexes, as well as the diagnostic criteria.
Methods  Based on the method from a previous report by the authors, studies were identified from the following databases: 
PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Knowledge, Ovid and the 4 most important Chinese databases. Articles in English 
and Chinese before 2021 were retrieved. The data retrieved at this time were pooled with the data from a previous report 
for analyses.
Results  Thirty-three studies were identified, which included 18 studies supplemented in this retrieval. The pooled lifetime 
and 12-month prevalence of eating disorders were 0.91% (95% CI, 0.48–1.71) and 0.43% (95% CI, 0.18–0.78), respectively. 
The pooled lifetime and 12-month prevalence of the subgroup EDs (any), which covers all types of eating disorders, were 
1.69% and 0.72%, respectively. The lifetime prevalence of AN, BN and BED was 0.16% (95% CI, 0.06–0.31), 0.63% (95% 
CI, 0.33–1.02) and 1.53% (95% CI, 1.00–2.17), respectively. The lifetime prevalence of EDs in Western countries was 1.89%, 
and was high at 2.58% in females. Prevalence studies using DSM-5 criteria were scarce.
Conclusions  The prevalence of eating disorders might be underestimated thus far. Not all types of EDs were included in 
a majority of epidemiological surveys, and the prevalence rates of the new types of EDs were significantly higher. Eating 
disorders were especially common in Western countries and in females. New diagnostic criteria should be used to compre-
hensively assess all types of eating disorders.
Level of evidence  1, systematic review and meta-analysis.

Introduction

Eating disorders (EDs) are a group of syndromes character-
ized by eating behaviors and psychological disorders accom-
panied by weight changes and/or social disorders that have a 
significant influence on quality of life and social function [1, 
2]. Moreover, individuals with eating disorders may develop 
severe somatic complications that can cause a higher risk of 
suicide [3] and increased mortality rates, especially anorexia 
nervosa (AN) [4], one of the main types, with a fatality rate 
as high as 5–20% [5].

The criteria of eating disorders evolved over time. In the 
Diagnostic and statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th 
edition (DSM-IV) [6], eating disorders include anorexia ner-
vosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and eating disorder not

otherwise specified (EDNOS). EDNOS is a complex diag-
nosis recognized as all eating disorders that do not meet the 
diagnostic criteria of AN or BN or cannot be categorized 
into either of the two. Binge eating disorder (BED) is also 
classified into EDNOS and is listed in appendix. However, 
recent studies found that the impact of physical and psy-
chological damage caused by EDNOS is no less than that 
caused by the classic eating disorder types AN or BN [7]. 
In the DSM-5 issued in 2013 [8], the diagnostic categories 
of eating disorders were expanded to “feeding and eating 
disorders”, in which feeding and eating disorders first seen 
in infants and early childhood were included. Binge eating 
disorder (BED) was listed individually in the diagnostic cri-
teria. Exclusive of AN, BN and BED, the rest are classified 
as other specified feeding and eating disorder (OSFED) and 
unspecified feeding and eating disorder (UFED). OSFED 
refers to eating disorders that can lead to patients’ clinical 
suffering or damage to social function, such as atypical AN, 
atypical BN, atypical BED, purging disorder, and night eat-
ing syndrome, which do not meet the criteria for AN, BN 
or BED. Other eating disorders that cause clinical suffering 
or impaired social function in patients but do not meet the 
diagnostic conditions listed above are classified as UFED. 
Apart from the changes in classification, the diagnostic cri-
teria of all types of eating disorders were relaxed in DSM-
5. The weight loss requirement has been relaxed, and the 
requirement of “amenorrhea” has been removed in AN. In 
the diagnosis of BN, the frequency of binge eating or unduly 
compensational behavior was lowered from twice a week 
to once a week. Similarly, the frequency of binge eating 
in BED diagnostic criteria has also been lowered to once a 
week (Table 1).

Eating  disorders  had  been  claimed  to  be  represented 
predominantly  in  Western  countries  and  women  in  the 
past, which may be due to cultural beliefs and attitudes in 
some aspect [9]. With industrialization and globalization, 
many regions reported increasing incidence rates of eating 

disorders [10, 11]. What’s more, the reported prevalence 
of eating disorders in the general population varied widely 
all along, which ranges from 0.1% [12] to 3.8% [13]. To 
address these issues, a systematic review on the prevalence 
of eating disorders in the general population was performed 
in 2013 by the author [14]. It showed that there were serious 
limitations in the available epidemiological data, especially 
from low- and middle-income countries, including China. 
Only 15 studies were included during the past 30 years since 
2013. The pooled lifetime prevalence of eating disorders 
was 1.01%, but the specific types of eating disorders var-
ied among the studies included. The prevalence of eating 
disorders was higher in women, and in Western than Asian 
countries, but South Korea was the only Asian country. The 
prevalence tended to increase over time but may also be 
caused by changes in the diagnostic criteria.

With the increasing attention to eating disorders in recent 
years, more and more related studies have emerged. Epi-
demiological studies have also increased, with many from 
the Asia countries and some even reporting high preva-
lence rates [15, 16]. More researches in men have also been 
reported, and the view that women are dominant seems to 
have wavered [4, 17]. In the meantime, some studies have 
indicated that the resulting prevalence by using DSM-5 is 
different from that by using DSM-IV [17–20]. In order to 
better understand the prevalence and the distribution char-
acteristics of eating disorders, this study updated the sys-
tematic review on the prevalence of eating disorders in the 
general population. Thus, the main objectives of this study 
are (1) to update the prevalence of eating disorders and vari-
ous types in the general population before 2021; (2) to ana-
lyze the distribution characteristics at different times and in 
different regions and sexes, as well as the diagnostic criteria 
between DSM-IV and DSM-5.

Method

Evaluation of study quality

Literature retrieval strategies

Previous research methods were followed in this study. The 
retrieved databases included PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, 
ISI Web of Knowledge, Ovid and the Chinese Databases 
Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chongqing VIP 
database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, WANFANG 
DATA, and China BioMedical Literature Services System 
(SinoMed). The dates of retrieval were from 1 May 2013 
to 31 January 2021. Only English and Chinese articles are 
included.

Other than the key words ‘eating disorders’, ‘anorexia 
nervosa’, ‘bulimia nervosa’, ‘prevalence’, and ‘epidemiol-
ogy’ in both English and Chinese used in our previous study, 
we added a new key word ‘mental’ in Chinese in this study. 
Furthermore, articles before May 2013 were additionally 
retrieved by using the key words ’mental’ and ‘prevalence/
epidemiology’. All references in the included literature were 
then retrieved manually.

After all duplicated studies retrieved from the databases 
were removed automatically by EndnoteX7, preliminary 
screening based on the title and abstract was carried out by 
two authors (Jie Qian & Ying Wu) independently. The full 
texts of the literature above were downloaded and reviewed, 
followed by screening on the basis of the pre-established 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. For those studies for which 
consensus was not reached, even after discussion by both 
authors, a third member (Wan Yumei) decided whether to 
include the study or not.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria: (1) the epidemiological survey of the eat-
ing disorder evaluated a general population; (2) the diag-
nostic criteria of the eating disorder conformed to that of 
DSM or the ICD or the CCMD; (3) tools for screening were 
admitted; and (4) information such as prevalence and sample 
size in literatures could be extracted.

Exclusion criteria: (1) nonhuman studies, reviews, case 
reports and redundant published studies; and (2) studies on 
special populations, such as women, students, juveniles, hos-
pitals and armies.

Data extraction

For the included literature, data were extracted by Jie Qian 
and Ying Wu. The extracted items included first author; 
study year; study region; sampling method; diagnostic cri-
teria; overall sample size; the number of cases; lifetime, 
12-month, 3-month and 4-week prevalence rates; and sex.

Similar to a previous study, the evaluation of the included 
literature followed the standards of the necessary items listed 
in Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology (STROBE). Every item counted as a score of 
1, with the total score ranging from 0 to 22.

Statistical analysis

The  Metaprop  package  in  R  version  3.6.2  software  was 
applied, and Logit was used to perform rate conversion for 
consolidation computation. A heterogeneity test was per-
formed. If I2 (statistics of effect value variation caused by 
heterogeneity) was less than 50% and the heterogeneity test 
p > 0.10, the fixed-effects model was adopted for rate consol-
idation; otherwise, the random-effects model was adopted. 
When there was significant heterogeneity among studies, 
sensitivity analysis was conducted. The funnel chart method 
was used to evaluate the publication bias of the included 
studies.

Results

A total of 29,201 unduplicated articles were retrieved at 
this time, 18,713 of which were in Chinese. After second-
ary screening, 18 studies were included according to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria (Fig. 1).

Characteristics of the included studies

Thirty-three studies were identified, which included 15 stud-
ies reported in the systematic review in 2013 [14]. Among 
the 18 included studies in this retrieval, 3 studies offered 2 
or 3 groups of data: Hay 2017’s study [1] was performed 
in  2014  and  2015,  respectively;  Choi  2015’s  study  [21] 
was divided into KECR-R (performed in 2006–2007) and 
KECA-2011 (performed in 2011); and Shi 2015’s study [12] 
showed three groups of data from Shanxi Province, Gansu 
Province and Henan Province in China. Hence, there were 
22 groups of data in total. The publication times of all stud-
ies ranged from 2002 to 2021, and the study times ranged 
from 2001 to 2017; however, the study time of one article 
published in 2014 was not specified [22]. There were 6 Chi-
nese articles (including 3 dissertations [12, 23, 24]) and 13 
separate English articles. Three studies were conducted in 
America [13, 18, 25]; 3 in Australia [1, 26]; 1 each in Italy 
[22], Switzerland [17], Korea [21] and Saudi Arabia [15, 
16]; and 8 in China [12, 23, 24, 27–31], in which only 1 was 
national research [31], while the remaining 7 were regional 
studies limited to provinces or cities. DSM-IV and DSM-5 
were used as newer diagnostic criteria than DSM-III and

ICD. DSM-5 alone was applied in 4 studies, DSM-IV alone 
was applied in 11 studies, and DSM-IV and DSM-5 were 
both applied in the remaining 3 studies [22]. The cumulative 
total sample size of all studies was 242,917, with no subjects 
under the age of 15 years. There were only three studies 
involving EDs, of which one encompassed all types of eating 
disorders [13]; one included AN, BN and BED [17]; and the 
other did not specify the details of the eating disorders [12]. 
There were 15 studies referring to AN, 13 to BN and 10 to 
BED; other than that, there were two involving UFED, a new 
type in DSM-5, and one involving OSFED (Fig. 2).

The 33 studies included 315,877 participants. The studies 
were conducted from 1984 to 2017, with diagnostic criteria 
including DSM-III, DSM-IV, DSM-5 and ICD. The studies 
were conducted in the United States; European countries, 
including Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Italy, Switzer-
land, Belgium, France, and Spain; Asian countries, including 
South Korea, China and Saudi Arabia; Oceanic countries,

including Australia and New Zealand; and Latin countries, 
including Mexico [32] and Brazil [33]. In addition, there 
was an included study organized by the WHO involving 14 
countries [34]. The specific percentages of study year, region 
and diagnostic criteria are shown in Table 2.

Evaluation of study quality and the assessment 
of publication bias

The mean (sd) quality score for the reports of the 19 stud-
ies based on the STROBE items was 17.97 (1.71), and the 
range in this score varied from 15.5 to 22.0. Ten studies 
scored over 18.0, accounting for 52.6%, indicating high gen-
eral quality of the literature. The most common problems 
in the reports of these studies were inadequate descriptions 
of the numbers of individuals in every phase, the reason 
for nonparticipation, and the numbers of individuals with 
missing data.

The assessment of publication bias on the prevalence 
of eating disorders and the three main types of EDs was 
conducted using the funnel chart method. The publication 
bias levels of eating disorders (t = − 1.97, p = 0.077), AN 
(t = − 0.21,  p = 0.839), BN (t = 1.12,  p = 0.278) and BED 
(t = 0.1, p = 0.921) were not statistically significant.

Prevalence rates of eating disorders and the various 
types

The lifetime, 12-month and 4-week prevalence rates of eat-
ing disorders were 0.91% (95% CI, 0.48–1.71), 0.43% (95% 
CI, 0.18–0.78), and 0.2% (95% CI, 0.09–0.36), respectively. 
As described above, the specific types of eating disorders 
in the 11 studies involving eating disorders were not com-
pletely the same. Hence, the 11 studies were categorized into 
4 groups: ED (any), ED (AN + BN + BED), ED (AN + BN), 
and ED (unknown), representing the 4 studies including 
all types of eating disorders [13,  35–37]; 1 study includ-
ing AN, BN and BED [17]; 4 studies [38– 41] including 
only AN and BN; and 2 others without specific content [12, 
42]. A lifetime prevalence of 3.60% and a 12-month preva-
lence of 1.1% were reported in the only study from the ED 
(AN + BN + BED) group. The lifetime prevalence rates of 
the remaining groups were 1.69% (95% CI, 0.75–3.76) for 
ED (any), 0.83% (95% CI, 0.35–1.93) for ED (AN + BN), 
and 0.25% (95% CI, 0.13–0.48) for ED (unknown). The life-
time and 12-month prevalence rates of ED (any) were over 
twice those of ED (AN + BN), and over 1.5 times those of 
eating disorders (shown in Table 3 and Fig. 3).

The lifetime prevalence rates of AN, BN and BED were 
0.16% (95% CI, 0.06–0.31), 0.63% (95% CI, 0.33–1.02) and 
1.53% (95% CI, 1.00–2.17), respectively. The lifetime preva-
lence of BN was nearly 4 times that of AN, and that of BED 
was nearly 10 times that of AN, with a ratio of approximately 

1:4:10. The 12-month prevalence rates were also with great 
disparity, with a ratio of approximately 1:16:46. BED preva-
lence was markedly higher than the prevalence of the other 
two classic types, whereas AN prevalence was the lowest 
(Tables 4, 5 and 6).

Three studies involved the 3-month prevalence of AN, 
BN and BED, all conducted in Australia by Hay et al., with 
DSM-5 as the diagnostic criteria used. The 3-month preva-
lence rates of AN were 0.46% during 2008–2009 and 0 in 
both 2014 and 2015. The 3-month prevalence of BN was 
0.99% based on pooled data of 4 groups from the 3 studies. 
The 3-month prevalence of BED was 1.71% based on pooled 
data from 3 studies.

The 3-month prevalence of OSFED and UFED was seen 
only in the report conducted by Hay et al. The 3-month prev-
alence rates of OSFED were 0 in 2014 and 3.2% in 2015. 
The 3-month prevalence of UFED was 2.2% based on the 
pooled data from the 2 studies.

Sensitivity analysis of the main results was conducted, 
and no study with a significant change in heterogeneity was 
found.

Subgroup analysis

Diagnostic criteria

Subgroup analysis using the diagnostic criteria of DSM-5 
and DSM-IV was added in this report. No study involving 
EDs used DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. The pooled lifetime 
prevalence of AN using DSM-5 was 0.89%, which was 8.9 
times that using DSM-IV (p < 0.001); the pooled 12-month 
prevalence was 2 times that using DSM-5 than that using 
DSM-IV.  For  BN,  the  pooled  lifetime  prevalence  using 
DSM-5 was 1.41%, which was 2.5 times that using DSM-
IV. However, for BED, the lifetime and 12-month prevalence 
rates diagnosed by DSM-5 were slightly lower than those 
diagnosed by DSM-IV, but the differences were not statisti-
cally significant.

Years of study

The lifetime prevalence rates of EDs in the 1990s, 2000s and 
2010s were 0.91%, 2.0% and 0.71%, respectively, while the 
12-month prevalence rates were 0.36%, 0.68% and 0.26%, 
respectively. The highest prevalence was in the 2000s for 
both conditions, with a lower prevalence in the 2010s. The 
lifetime prevalence rates of AN in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s 
and 2010s were 0.01%, 0.06%, 0.13% and 0.42%, respec-
tively, with an upward trend. The lifetime prevalence rates 
of BN in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s were 0.53%, 0.41% and 
1.08%, respectively, and the 12-month prevalence rates were 
0.29%, 0.28% and 0.41%, respectively. The lifetime preva-
lence rates of BED in the 2000s and the 2010s were 1.58%

and 1.48%, respectively, and the 12-month prevalence rates 
were 0.95% and 0.90%; the prevalence rates in the 2010s 
were both lower than those in the 2000s for both conditions 
(shown in Fig. 4).

Geographic region

We used the same method for comparing Western and Asian 
countries as in a previous report. The lifetime and 12-month 
prevalence rates of EDs in Western countries were 1.89% 
and 0.68%, respectively, both over 8.5 times those in Asian 
countries (p < 0.01). The lifetime prevalence of AN in West-
ern countries was 21 times that in Asian countries, 7.3-fold 
for BN and 2-fold for BED. The 12-month prevalence rates 
were 2-fold and 1.2-fold higher in Western countries than 
in Asian countries for AN and BN, respectively. The preva-
lence in Western countries was significantly higher than that 
in Asia for any type of eating disorder. Furthermore, the 
pooled lifetime prevalence rates of AN were subdivided by 
region of South Korea, China, Western Europe and America, 

with results of 0.01%, 0.02%, 0.47% and 0.52%, respectively 
(shown in Fig. 5).

Sex

The lifetime prevalence rates of eating disorders in females 
reached 2.58% (95% CI, 1.06–4.74) and 0.74% (95% CI, 
0.24–1.52) in males. Regardless of overall eating disorders 
or various types, the prevalence in females was evidently 
several times that in males. The lifetime eating disorder 
prevalence rates at 12 months and 4 weeks in females were 
3.5, 4.2 and 3.1 times those in males, respectively. The ratios 
of females to males in the lifetime prevalence of AN, BN and 
BED were 15.5, 3.2 and 2.1, respectively, and 3, 3.2 and 1.8 
in the 12-month prevalence. Compared with the classic types 
AN and BN, the ratio was lower for BED.

Discussion

Main finding

This study updated the prevalence of eating disorders in the 
general population before 2021, and analyzed the different 
conditions included among eating disorders to obtain closer-
to-real-level prevalence data. The differences in sex, region, 
decades and diagnostic criteria were analyzed.

After  this  update,  the  pooled  lifetime  and  12-month 
prevalence rates of eating disorders were 0.9% and 0.43%, 
respectively. However, the pooled lifetime and 12-month 
prevalence rates of ED (any), the subgroup of which cov-
ers all types of eating disorders, were 1.69% and 0.72%, 
respectively, both over 1.5 times those of the eating disorders 
among all 12 groups of data. Many studies on the prevalence 
of eating disorders included only the 2 classic types, AN 
and BN, whereas their prevalence rates were comparatively 
lower among various types. This reflected the situation in 
which the prevalence of eating disorders in the general popu-
lation was underestimated. Another factor that needs to be 
considered is that the 4 studies of EDs (any) all come from 

Western high-income countries (Germany, the United States 
and six other European countries).

The lifetime prevalence rates of AN, BN and BED were 
0.16%, 0.63% and 1.53%, respectively, which were all lower 
than the results in a previous report from 2013. This may be 
related to the fact that only three studies were from South 
Korea,  the  only  Asian  country  included  in  the  previous 
report, whereas a large number of Asian country studies, 
especially China, were included in this report.

To date, few studies have used DSM-5 to study the preva-
lence of eating disorders. Thus, studies that use DSM-5 diag-
nostic criteria to conduct comprehensive investigations of all 
types of eating disorders are still lacking. The prevalence of 
AN using the diagnostic criteria of DSM-5 was much higher 
than that using DSM-IV, in accord with other study results 
[19, 20, 43]. This was also in line with the fact that the stand-
ards of AN experienced the greatest alteration in DSM-5 
diagnostic criteria. For BN, the lifetime prevalence using 
DSM-5 was higher than that using DSM-IV, in accord with 
others studied by Lindvall Dahlgren [43] and Flament [19], 
which could be because the frequency of the diagnosis was 
reduced. However, Mancuso [20] showed that the prevalence 
of BN was not different using the two diagnostic criteria and

were in discordance. Lindvall Dahlgren [43] reported that 
there had been early evidence indicating a higher prevalence 
of BED using DSM-5. Flament [19] found that the preva-
lence of BED had no change in juveniles. More research 
using DSM-5 is needed for comparison in the future.

Except for AN, the prevalence of other types of EDs did 
not significantly increase with time until the 2010s. The 
prevalence of EDs in the 2000s showed an increase com-
pared with that in the 1990s, which was in accordance with 
Mitchison’s [44] and Hay’s [11] studies on the prevalence 
trends of eating disorders. However, the prevalence declined 
instead of growing in the 2010s. Nevertheless, more stud-
ies need to be included, as only 2 studies were included 
after 2010 [12, 17]. The upward trend in AN and the slight 
downward trend in BN were in line with most other studies 
[4, 45, 46], but studies of new types of eating disorders are 
still lacking.

In terms of the distributions of geographic region and 
sex, the results in this report were consistent with those of a 
previous study by the authors and others, in which the preva-
lence rates in Western countries and in females were higher. 
The lifetime prevalence rates were up to 2.58% in females 
and  1.89%  in  Western  countries,  higher  than  the  preva-
lence rates of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. The 
real prevalence rates in Western countries and in females 
might be even higher due to underestimation, as mentioned 
above. Although the prevalence was higher in females, male 
patients showed a slightly higher proportion of BED than of

the classic types AN and BN, consistent with the results of 
Smink’s study [4].

have been some epidemiological studies of EDs in recent 
years with mixed results.

Strengths and limitations

What this study adds?

There have been few reviews about the prevalence rates of 
eating disorders in the general population. Of the 15 studies 
included in our former meta-analysis, only 3 studies of one 
country (South Korea) were from Asia. However, 8 Chinese 
studies, accounting for 50% of all newly included studies, 
were included in this report. As the specific contents of eat-
ing disorders varied greatly in different studies, subgroup 
analysis was conducted based on the specific contents, which 
might provide more authentic data. The number of studies 
was more than double, and most of the main results were 
calculated based on more than 10 studies, with publication 
bias assessed by the funnel chart method, which essentially 
resolved the limitations of previous reports.

However, the number of studies on the prevalence of eat-
ing disorders is still small, concentrated in Europe, America, 
Australia, New Zealand and a few Asian countries, such as 
China and South Korea. Studies from other countries were 
not retrieved, probably due to language limitations, and the 
distribution of geographic regions cannot be analyzed in a 
larger scope. The number of studies using DSM-5 was small, 
with no study covering all types of eating disorders found 
in DMS-5. Likewise, those of AN, BN and other types were 
also very small; thus, it is impossible to conduct a compre-
hensive analysis on the impact of the new diagnostic criteria 
on the prevalence of eating disorders.

Conclusion

The prevalence of eating disorders may be underestimated 
thus far. A large number of previous epidemic studies did not 
include all types of eating disorders, whereas the prevalence 
in new types was apparently higher. The prevalence of eating 
disorders was high, especially in Western countries and in 
females. In addition, we should pay more attention to new 
types of eating disorders in males. In future epidemic inves-
tigations, new diagnostic criteria should be used more often 
to comprehensively evaluate all types of eating disorders.

The prevalence of eating disorders might be underestimated. 
Not all types of EDs were included in epidemiological sur-
veys. New diagnostic criteria shall be used more to access 
EDs comprehensively.
