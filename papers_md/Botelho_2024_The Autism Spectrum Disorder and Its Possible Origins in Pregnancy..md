Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) belongs to the group of neurodevelopmental disorders,
and has a high prevalence, affecting 1 in 100 children according to data from the World Health Orga-
nization (WHO). To be diagnosed with ASD, the child must have persistent deficits in communication
and social interactions, and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. De-
spite its prevalence, the etiology of ASD is still uncertain, with multifactorial characteristics, including
those associated with the gestational period, where maternal exposure to biological, chemical, or
physical hazards occurs, some of which have already been proposed as causes of ASD outcomes.
Since pregnancy requires a balance between the maternal–fetal binomial, the breakdown of this
balance caused by such environmental hazards can lead to altered fetal neurodevelopment, including
ASD. With this firmly in mind, this review aims to compile the most recent data on the gestational
causes that may be associated with the development of ASD to help health professionals identify risk
factors and act for the prevention and management of ASD.

1. Introduction

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that
begins to manifest from early childhood [1]. The global average estimate shows that ASD
has a prevalence of 1 in 100 children [2]. It is also known that the incidence of ASD is four
times higher in males [3]. The exact cause of the predominance of ASD in boys has not
yet been fully elucidated, but it is believed to be correlated with sex chromosomes and
hormones [4].On the contrary, some studies justify this higher incidence of ASD in boys
by the criteria currently adopted for diagnosis, which do not fully take into account the
symptoms presented by females [5–9]. Such differences have been observed in the clinical,
cognitive, and biological presentation of ASD in females, in addition to the fact that females
are more socially motivated and tend to mask social difficulties [5–9]. Over the years, there
has been an increase in the average prevalence of ASD cases worldwide, which may be due
to a better understanding of the disorder and consequent diagnosis and notification, as well
as shedding light on the changes surrounding exposure to environmental risk factors [10].
The diagnosis of ASD can be difficult, as there are no clinical or laboratory tests and
it is necessary to evaluate the history of development and behavior [11]. It requires the
presence of two main groups of symptoms related to deficits in communication and social
interaction and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities [12].
The diagnosis can be made in the first few years of a child’s life. This helps to differentiate
the characteristic signs of ASD from development within the expected range for their age
group or other conditions that may affect child development [10]. Access to a fast and
accurate diagnosis could make a difference to their lives, as it can enable the family to find
specialized help and reduce the chances of possible limitations that may last into adulthood.
Despite advances in diagnostic criteria for ASD, its etiology is still debated, although it
is widely accepted that it is multifactorial [13]. It is commonly accepted that abnormalities

in the development of the central nervous system (CNS) contribute to the onset of ASD,
such as reduced fiber density in the white matter of the brain, and atypical activation in the
prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, and middle and superior temporal gyrus [14,15].
In addition to the aforementioned malformations, genetic factors have been identified as
highly significant in the etiology of ASD, due to the high heritability of the disease and
the association with fragile X syndrome (FXS), Down syndrome, Prader–Willi syndrome
(PWS), genetic microdeletions, and single nucleotide polimorphisms and mutations [16–20].
This information reveals the heterogeneity of the causes that can trigger ASD and, in this
context, it is necessary to shed light on the impacts of exposure to environmental factors
and complications during pregnancy as possible determinants for the development of
ASD [21,22].

Therefore, primary prevention involves making health professionals aware of the
stressors that increase the risk of ASD, with a particular focus on counseling pregnant
women, as pregnancy is a critical time for fetal development.

Clinical practice has a fundamental role in the early identification of ASD character-
istics by health professionals, allowing them to assist parents in observing symptoms. In
addition, understanding the etiology of ASD is essential for improving clinical care and
positively impacting prenatal and childcare consultations. Therefore, this review aims to
compile the most recent data on environmental exposure to certain substances in pregnancy
that have been associated with the development of ASD, also helping health professionals
to identify risk factors and act for the primary prevention and management of ASD.

2. The Influence of Environmental Hazards

The fetal period is essential for the proper development of the human brain, as it is a
time when the production, migration, and differentiation of neurons and the specialization
of different brain regions occur [23]. The nervous system formation events can be heavily
influenced by the environment, either by biological signals from the mother or by hazardous
external factors, which can contribute to behavioral dysfunction throughout life [23,24].
It is already known that the use of substances such as alcohol and other drugs, maternal
stressors, and environmental factors can be detrimental to fetal neurodevelopment [25]).
Therefore, it is necessary to understand how these factors can affect the development of
ASD in children exposed in the prenatal period and how to avoid such exposure.

2.1. Air Pollution

Air pollution is a complex phenomenon characterized by a heterogeneous combination
of particles, gases (such as ozone and nitrous oxide), metals, and organic contaminants,
varying in size [26]. Numerous studies emphasize the significant contribution of pollution
to various health issues [26–28]. While it is established that air pollution significantly
impacts the airways and cardiovascular system, evidence indicates its negative effects
on the brain due to inflammatory processes and the development of oxidative stress,
contributing to the onset of central nervous system diseases [26,29].

It has been demonstrated that children exposed to pollution during the pre- and/or
postnatal periods exhibit biochemical and behavioral alterations, neuroinflammatory mark-
ers, and delays in psychomotor development [29]. In utero exposure to pollutants is identi-
fied as a trigger for motor alterations and impulsive behavior, particularly in males [29].
Magen-molho and colleagues conducted a case-control study involving children born
between 2007 and 2012 in Israel, who were diagnosed with ASD [30]. The results re-
vealed a positive association between ASD and gestational exposure to air pollutants,
specifically PM2.5 (particulate matter < 2.5 µm) and PM10 [30]. Statistical analysis demon-
strated an increased likelihood of the development of ASD in relation to exposure to
atmospheric pollutants [OR (odds ratio) per interquartile range of 1.08 (95% confidence
interval: 1.01–1.15)] [30]. These findings suggest that prenatal exposure to fine particles and
coarser particulate matter in the air may be associated with an elevated risk of ASD [30].
Similarly, Rahman and colleagues conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 244

3 of 22

involving 294,937 mother–child pairs with singleton births at Kaiser Permanent Southern
California (KPSC) hospitals in the USA [31]. The findings revealed a positive association
between exposure to environmental pollutants and ASD. Exposure to PM2.5 in the first
two trimesters showed a significant association with ASD, with a cumulative HR = 1.14
(95% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.23) [31]. Additionally, it was noted that early exposure to
PM2.5 during pregnancy had a stronger association with male gender, with an HR = 1.16
(95% CI: 1.08, 1.26) [31]. These findings underscore the relevance of air quality during
pregnancy as a potential risk factor for ASD development, particularly concerning the
timing and gender of the fetus [31]. This concept is further corroborated by a population
cohort study conducted by Yu and colleagues in Southern California, USA [32]. Over
this period, 318,751 mother–child pairs were meticulously monitored through electronic
medical records, leading to the diagnosis of ASD in 4559 children before the age of 5 [32].
Within this context, the researchers established a noteworthy association between exposure
to air pollutants PM2.5, but not PM10, and an elevated risk of ASD development [HR = 1.07
(95% CI 1.03–1.12) per IQR = 3.73 µg/m3] [32].

To elucidate the mechanism by which pollutants increase the risk for ASD, Block and
colleagues conducted a study using an animal model in which pregnant mothers were
co-exposed to environmental pollution and stressors such as inadequate housing [33]. The
results revealed an overactivation of the immune system in response to this exposure.
Interestingly, lasting behavioral changes and social interaction alterations were observed
exclusively in male offspring [33]. Furthermore, the study highlighted a significant decrease
in microglial function and phagocytic capacity within the anterior cingulate cortex of these
males [33]. These findings suggest that environmental stressors impact the formation
of neural circuits in males, impairing microglial function during development [33]. The
identified evidence supports the hypothesis that inflammatory processes triggered by air
pollutants during the fetal developmental phase significantly contribute to the onset of
ASD [26].

2.2. Organophosphate and Organochlorine Insecticides/Pesticides

Organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides belong to the class of toxic substances
that are capable of altering neurodevelopment during the gestational period, as they
can cross the placental barrier and cause alterations in fetal development [34]. Perinatal
exposure to these agents causes alterations in neurotransmission and is considered a risk
factor for the development of ASD [35,36]. Because of their lipophilic properties, these
agents have a potent neurotoxic effect, being able to allow the sustained opening of sodium
channels and interaction with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, among other
changes in the central nervous system [37,38].

De Felice and colleagues, using an animal model, showed that exposure during preg-
nancy to non-toxic levels of organophosphate insecticides, at a dose of 6 mg/kg/bw,
increased oxidative stress and generated alterations in prostaglandin E2 production, which
is associated with alterations in neurodevelopment and behavioral deficits [39]. These
results corroborate the findings of Morales-Navas and colleagues, who also associated
prenatal exposure to organophosphates and the development of ASD-like symptoms in
an animal model (one subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg of CPF [O,O-dietil O-(3,5,6-
trichloropyridin-2-yl) phosphorothioate] dissolved in DMSO [dimethyl sulfoxide], for four
days) [40]. Biosca-Brull and collaborators showed in a pre-clinical model that prenatal
exposure to organophosphate compounds (1 mg/kg/day dose of CPF), but not postnatal
exposure, caused impairment in their social interaction, where males were the most af-
fected [41]. In this way, they demonstrated that the moment of contact can be crucial for the
development of ASD [41]. Human studies using a cohort of more than 200 pairs of mothers
and children showed an association between the concentration of dimethylthiophosphate
(DMTP) (1.8 µg/L in mother’s urine), a metabolite of organophosphates, and a higher risk
of ASD diagnosis in girls only [OR = 1.64 (95%CI, 0.95; 2.82)] [42]. It is worth noting that the
study by Philippat and collaborators was carried out with a cohort of children who were al-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 244

4 of 22

ready known to have first-degree relatives diagnosed with ASD [42]. Another cohort study
of more than 700 French children found that the presence of organophosphate insecticide
metabolites in the urine of pregnant women, specifically chlorpyrifos, is associated with an
increase in autistic traits in 11-year-old children (OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.32, 3.69) [36].

Exposure to organochlorine pesticides during pregnancy is associated with a reduction
in cognitive development and changes in motor functions, characteristics of ASD [38]. Stud-
ies found that exposure to organochlorine compounds doubles the chance of developing
ASD with intellectual disability [37,43]. Biosca-Brull and colleagues also showed that, in
humans, prenatal exposure to organochlorine and organophosphate compounds increases
the chance of cognitive and behavioral alterations related to ASD symptoms [35]. A study
evaluating the presence of organochlorine pesticides in breast milk and their association
with ASD in Norwegian children, through a prospective evaluation of a birth cohort, was
able to identify that β-Hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH) is associated with a significantly
higher risk of developing ASD in children (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.77) [44]. In this same
study, the authors observed the toxicity of β-HCH in a zebrafish model and confirmed the
neurotoxicity of this substance, suggesting the disruption of dopaminergic neurons as a
possible mechanism underlying the onset of ASD [44]. In addition, the inhibition of acetyl-
cholinesterase (AChE), voltage-gated sodium channels, and GABA are also mechanisms
that may be acting for the development of ASD in children exposed to pesticides [45].

The mechanisms by which pesticides cause neurotoxicity and the subsequent develop-
ment of psychiatric disorders are not yet fully understood. Nonetheless, López-Merino and
colleagues observed in animal models that exposure to organochlorine and organophos-
phate pesticides in the perinatal period induces chronic alterations in the MAPK/ERK
signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating synaptic plasticity [46]. Furthermore,
they demonstrated that metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depres-
sion (mGluR-LTD) in the hippocampus was impaired after exposure to these pesticides,
potentially causing the cognitive and behavioral deficits observed in ASD [46].

On the contrary, a recent systematic review demonstrated the absence of an association
between prenatal exposure to endocrine disruptors, such as pesticides, and the development
of ASD [47]. However, this emphasizes that it may be due to methodological differences
in the selected studies, and that the risk of pesticide exposure in the development of ASD
cannot be ruled out [47].

2.3. Microplastics and Additives

Global plastic production has increased exponentially since the 1950s [48]. Although
necessary in modern lives, only 9% of all plastic waste is recycled, while 22% pollutes the
environment as macro- and microplastic waste [48]. Macroplastic pollution is degraded by
physical elements (e.g., sun, heat, wind) and chemical agents (e.g., acid, salt, chlorine) into
microplastics (MP, 1 µm to 5 mm) [49]. These microplastics accumulate in the environment
over time [27]. Recently, there have been reports of MP accumulation in several organs
and fluids, including placentas and breast milk [50,51]. Nonetheless, the impact of MP
accumulation in human tissues and the effect on population health are still unclear [51].

MPs differ in terms of size, color, type, and polymer composition [52]. A study carried
out by Chen and collaborators showed that polystyrene (PS) microplastics, using a zebrafish
model, did not cause apparent toxicity in embryonic development but was able to generate
accumulations in the head and nervous tube of zebrafish embryos, and concluded that PS
found in the oceans can possibly generate toxicity for neurodevelopment; however, it did
not aim to evaluate behavior similar to ASD [52]. A study evaluating the polyethylene
(PE) polymer, on the other hand, proposes that MPs trigger ASD-like symptoms in mice
offspring when their mothers were fed with PE and it was observed that MPs showed
bio-accumulation in the brain after the digestion process [53]. In addition, the offspring
showed a reduction in social interactions and in spatial memory, hesitation, decreased
interest in exploring new environments, and an increase in repetitive and compulsive
behaviors [53].

Additionally, MPs are usually not alone, carrying additives such as plasticizers, heavy
metals, dyes, and others, which are known to be endocrine disruptors, some being asso-
ciated with ASD [54]. Plasticizers such as phthalates are highly used in the industry to
manufacture plastics, hospital products, cosmetics, and toys, and can cross the placenta
and reach fetal tissues, in addition to impacting brain development [28,55,56]. Moreover,
exposure to phthalates in various forms and concentrations can lead to hyperactivity, im-
pulsivity, and inattention in children diagnosed with ASD [57]. In a study conducted
by Kardas and collaborators, phthalate levels were elevated in children with ASD [56].
Interestingly, Oulhote and colleagues, when evaluating the urine of pregnant women in the
first trimester, identified that higher concentrations of phthalate metabolites in urine during
the gestational period were correlated with high scores of autistic traits in their children,
specifically in boys aged between 3 and 4 years old [58]. It is interesting to note that
another similar study, performing analyses of the urine phthalate levels of pregnant women
(11–18 weeks of pregnancy), showed an increased concentration of phthalate metabolites,
not only in pregnant women but also in the urine of male neonates, although not in female
neonates [59]. These male neonates had increased difficulty with social skills, such as emo-
tional response, anxiety, depression, somatic complaints, social isolation, and behavioral
problems as they were growing and being followed by the study [59].

To understand how phthalates can be responsible for the development of ASD, Li and
colleagues, using an animal model, observed an increase in the expression of components
related to the mTOR pathway and the inhibition of autophagy in the brains of offspring
exposed to phthalates during the perinatal period [60]. These alterations may be responsible
for the development of symptoms resembling the autistic spectrum in these animals [60].
Another plasticizer, bisphenol A (BPA), is widely used in the manufacture of plastic
and epoxy resins and is known to be an endocrine-disrupting chemical [4]. Animal studies
have shown that the presence of BPA during pregnancy has a significant impact on the
nervous system [61]. It was observed that, after exposure to this plasticizer during the
pregnancy of rats and up to three days after birth, the offspring showed a reduction in
the number of neurons, as well as a decrease in the astrocytic population with reduced
dendritic spines [61]. In the same study, behavioral changes similar to anxiety could be
identified in offspring exposed to BPA [61]. Another study with fetal exposure to BPA
showed increased expression of transcription factors related to the development of ASD,
such as the androgen receptor (AR), and against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) in
male, but not in female, offspring [4]. The exact cause and mechanisms underlying the male
bias of ASD are still unclear, but there is evidence that sex chromosomes and hormones are
also involved in ASD susceptibility [4].

Furthermore, Hansen and collaborators carried out a prospective study to assess how
intrauterine exposure to BPA could be associated with ASD symptoms, quantifying BPA in
the urine of women at 28 weeks’ gestation [62]. As a result, they found that the children
of mothers with higher levels of BPA had a potentially higher risk of developing ASD in
children at the age of five [62].

The presence of MPs in the placenta was only recently discovered, and we do not know
for sure how they impact placental and embryonic development. It is essential to assess the
behavior of these MPs in the placenta since they could promote neurodevelopmental changes.

2.4. Heavy Metals

It has been known for some time that the exposure to heavy metals during pregnancy
can negatively impact fetal development, with changes in neurodevelopment and behav-
ior [63]. Toxic metals, such as arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg)
have been associated with the onset of ASD due to dysregulation in the neurotransmissions
and changes in the frontal and subcortical regions of the brain [64–67].

In search of understanding how exposure to metals could affect the neurodevelopment
of children, Freire and collaborators used the placenta as a biological exposure matrix [68].
Metal levels were measured in randomly selected placental tissues. Their levels were

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 244

associated with decreases in global and verbal executive functions and quantitative skills
(limit of detection was 0.0038 ng/g for As, 0.23494 ng/g for Cd, 0.016 ng/g for Hg, 0.94 ng/g
for Mn [manganese] e 6.50 ng/g for Pb) [68]. Elevated placental Hg was associated with
lower verbal function scores of the children, for example (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.07, 5.52) [68].
These results suggest that prenatal exposure to these metals may be risk factors for cognitive
and motor impairments in children—signs that may be present in ASD [68].

Exposure to heavy metals during critical stages of fetal development increases not
only the risk but also the severity of ASD [65]. A systematic review with a meta-analysis
carried out by Ding and collaborators identified higher levels of Cd (SMD = 0.17, 95%CI
(−0.18, 0.51), p > 0.05], Pb [SMD = 1.16, 95%CI (0.76, 1.55), p < 0.001], Hg [SMD = 0.74,
95%CI (0.44, 1.03), p < 0.001], and As [SMD = 1.40, 95%CI (0.75, 2.05), p < 0.001] in children
with ASD, potentially coming from maternal exposure in pregnancy [69]. Corroborating
these findings, Wegmann and collaborators measured metal levels in the umbilical cords
of newborns and in the plasma of these same children 5 years later [70]. Higher levels of
aluminum (Al) were found in umbilical cord blood in children with ASD compared to the
control group [70]. Al is associated with the severity of behavioral symptoms of ASD, being
an important neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory agent [70]. In 5-year-old children with
ASD, Hg levels were elevated when compared to the control group, which has already
been demonstrated by previous studies [70]. It was also found that Zinc (Zn) levels in
the umbilical cord blood of the control group were higher than in children with ASD,
which may suggest that the population with ASD is exposed to fewer nutritional options
containing this microelement [70]. Decreased Zn levels have already been associated with
ASD as a risk factor [71].

2.5. Medications

Various drugs used during pregnancy have been associated with the development of
ASD [28]. These include valproic acid, thalidomide, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs), and acetaminophen (paracetamol) [28].

Valproic acid (VPA), used as an anticonvulsant agent and mood stabilizer, presents
a significant risk when used during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester [72]. This
drug increases the probability of fetal malformations, neural tube defects, delayed neurode-
velopment, and cognitive changes, which are linked with the development of ASD [72,73].
An experimental study carried out by Zhao and collaborators evaluated molecular, cellular,
and behavioral changes in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) exposed to VPA
(200 or 300 mg/kg) in utero. This concentration is equivalent to about 10 times the human
therapeutic dose of 20–30 mg/kg/day [74]. The study observed behavioral changes, includ-
ing pronounced stereotypies and defects in social interaction, in animals exposed to the
drug in utero; additionally, defects in neurogenesis and altered levels of gene expression in
the brain were identified [74]. According to a study conducted by Rasalam and colleagues,
children exposed to valproic acid had a prevalence of ASD of 8.9% [75].

Currently, in vitro and in vivo studies have strengthened the association between the
use of valproic acid and the development of ASD [76,77]. A study conducted by Meng
and colleagues, using experiments with human forebrain organoids exposed to valproate
(1 mM, clinically relevant concentration), demonstrated an overexpression of several genes
associated with the development of autism, such as CAMK4, CLCN4, DPP10, GABRB3,
KCNB1, PRKCB, SCN1A, and SLC24A2 [76]. In addition, valproate affected genes related to
neural development, synaptic transmission, oxytocin signaling, and calcium and potassium
signaling pathways, all of which are implicated in ASD [76]. An in vivo study evaluating
the intrauterine exposure of mice to 0.4% of valproic acid identified alterations in social
interaction and cognitive functions, hypersensitivity to heat and pain stimuli in offspring
exposed during gestation, behaviors characteristic of ASD [77]. In this context, several
studies have used the animal model of autism induced by valproic acid to study changes
related to ASD, with the administration of VPA ranging from 500/600 mg/kg [78–80].

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 244

Moreover, Fereshetyan and collaborators, employing an animal model of prenatal and
postnatal exposure to valproate, revealed distinct cellular alterations in the prefrontal cortex,
amygdala, and cerebellum when exposed prenatally [81]. Interestingly, these changes
were not observed when the exposure occurred after delivery [81]. Nonetheless, both
prenatal and postnatal exposures led to behavioral and social interaction alterations [81].
Ishihara and colleagues, also employing an animal model, demonstrated that valproate
induces microglial activation and neural circuit dysfunction in the hippocampus [82].
This effect is accompanied by the overexpression of the chemokine CCL3, contributing
to neurocognitive alterations believed to be stimulated by these modifications [82]. This
shows the strong involvement of the use of this drug during pregnancy with the appearance
of ASD-like phenotypes.

Thalidomide, used to treat hanseniasis and multiple myeloma, has well-established
teratogenic effects when used during pregnancy, including limb reduction (phocomelia) and
cardiovascular and ocular abnormalities, and its use is prohibited in pregnant women [28,83].
Experiments conducted by Narita and colleagues on rats showed that exposure to 500 mg/kg,
especially in early pregnancy, led to the development of ASD characteristics [84]. Thalido-
mide may increase the risk of autism by altering the expression of genes associated with
neurotransmission, as indicated by Zieminska and collaborators [85].

The SSRIs, often prescribed to treat depression, have been associated with obstetric and
neonatal changes, with a potential impact on children’s neurobehavioral development [86].
These drugs cross the placental barrier, representing a significant risk factor for ASD [86,87].
Using an animal model of prenatal SSRI exposure, Bhat and colleagues identified that
this medication induces biochemical changes in the brains of rats [88]. This includes
lipid peroxidation, an increase in inflammatory cytokines, and apoptotic proteins such as
Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and caspase-3, respectively [88]. Additionally, the use of SSRI
during pregnancy resulted in a reduction of antioxidant molecules in the brain, such as
glutathione (GSH), glutathione S-transferases (GST), and catalase [88]. These alterations
may represent potential mechanisms through which SSRI use during pregnancy increases
the risk of ASD.

Studies conducted by Bérard and colleagues, with mothers exposed to SSRIs during
the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, showed an increased risk of developing ASD,
ranging from 1.87 to 8.36 among the study participants [89]. However, the exact gestational
period of exposure related to the onset of ASD is not yet fully understood [28]. An an-
tagonistic result was obtained from a case-control study carried out in the United States
with children born between 2003 and 2011, in which it was found that, among mothers
with psychiatric disorders, the use of SSRIs was not related to the presence of ASD in their
children [90]. Corroborating this finding, a study by Brennan and collaborators showed
that no association was found between exposure to antidepressants during pregnancy and
the appearance of traits or a diagnosis of ASD, based on a retrospective study with multiple
cohorts [91].

Acetaminophen (paracetamol), widely used by pregnant women as an antipyretic
and analgesic, is also associated with alterations in neurodevelopment [92]. In order to
assess the possible effects of using paracetamol during pregnancy, Klein and colleagues
carried out an experimental study using rats exposed to this medication (350 mg/kg/day)
during pregnancy and were able to observe that the female pups developed stereotyped
behavior, in addition to inducing signs of hyperactivity in both sexes, these signs being
similar to those presented during ASD [93]. Looking at studies with humans, a Danish
study that followed more than 64,000 children and mothers for 12 years revealed that 1.6%
of the children involved were diagnosed with ASD [94]. In addition, research conducted
by Avella-Garcia and colleagues showed that prenatal exposure to this drug increases
ASD symptoms in male children, affecting attention and generating hyperactive behav-
iors [92]. More recently, a prospective cohort study of more than 900 mother–child pairs
used umbilical cord blood to verify the relationship between acetaminophen metabolites
and the development of ASD [95]. The study found that biomarkers of acetaminophen

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 244

metabolism are dose-dependently correlated with an increased risk of developing ASD in
childhood (ORs: 1.6 to 4.1) [95]. Baker and colleagues, using an animal model, observed
that acetaminophen treatment during the prenatal period induced changes in behavior and
gene expression in the prefrontal cortex related to glutathione and cytochrome P450, DNA
damage, and immune and endocrine systems in the puppies [96]. These alterations were
primarily present in males [96].

2.6. Alcohol Consumption

Maternal consumption of alcoholic drinks during pregnancy has a significant impact
on children’s neurodevelopment, intellectual capacity, and learning ability [97,98]. Of-
ten, this consumption can lead to the development of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder
(FASD), which is characterized by dysmorphic facial features, fetal growth restriction, and
restricted brain growth, resulting in neurobehavioral impairment throughout life [97–100].
Although they share similarities, FASD and ASD are distinct entities. FASD is a group
of conditions associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol, characterized by somatic and
neuropsychological alterations, while ASD is a neurobehavioral syndrome [101].

Gallagher and colleagues, through a retrospective study, classified alcohol consump-
tion based on the number of units of beverages consumed, including half a liter of beer, a
glass of wine, or a single measure of alcoholic beverage [99]. Consumption is considered
light when one to two units are consumed per week or at any time during pregnancy,
moderate when three to tsix units are consumed per week, or three to five units at any time
during pregnancy, and heavy when seven or more units are consumed per week or six or
more units are consumed at any time during pregnancy [99]. In this context, the authors
found no association between alcohol consumption in pregnancy and the development
of ASD [99]. Similarly, Eliasen and colleagues found no positive relationship between
alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the development of ASD in children born to
mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy [102]. However, a study conducted by
Stevens and colleagues that evaluated children with FASD identified notable similarities
in social and communicative behavior between these children and those with ASD [97].
Sowel and collaborators demonstrated that alcohol use during pregnancy can trigger an
imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in pregnant women, which in
turn can result in alterations in fetal neurodevelopment [103]. In this study, a significant
increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-6, was observed in relation
to IL-10 levels, and this discrepancy correlated negatively with the children’s psychomotor
and mental development at 12 months of age [103].

The divergent correlations between ASD and alcohol exposure during pregnancy

highlight the need for more research and in-depth studies on this subject.

2.7. Hyperglycemia—Diabetes Mellitus

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a term used to designate metabolic disorders that present
with chronic hyperglycemia [104]. It can be classified as type I, when there is destruction of
pancreatic β cells, leading to insufficient insulin production; type II, when there is resistance
to insulin produced by the body, which may be at insufficient levels; and gestational
diabetes, when this metabolic disorder appears for the first time during pregnancy [104].

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is a chronic condition prevalent during preg-
nancy and which affects a large number of pregnant women worldwide [104]. In addition
to elevated glucose levels, this disease is accompanied by an imbalance in the mother’s
inflammatory response, with an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
to the detriment of anti-inflammatory ones [105,106]. The underlying pathophysiology
of GDM involves modifications in the β-cells of the pancreas, caused by excess human
placental lactogen hormone (hPL) [107]. This leads to the development of insulin resistance,
resulting in hyperglycemia and excessive glucose supply to the fetus [107]. The high ma-
ternal glycemic index negatively impacts fetal brain development, and is associated with

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 244

9 of 22

the emergence of disorders in growth and fine and gross motor development, as well as
learning difficulties, all factors present in ASD [83,108].

A retrospective cohort study carried out in Taiwan, with 877,233 children born between
2004 and 2008, showed a correlation between GDM and a higher risk of ASD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, and developmental delay [109]. In addition, they investigated
the relationship between DM types I and II and the development of ASD, concluding
that DM II was associated with a higher risk of ASD, among other neurodevelopmental
disorders [109]. Liu and his colleagues, through a case study, also confirmed this positive
link between GDM and the risk of developing ASD, highlighting that male children of
mothers with GDM were more likely to develop ASD [110]. Persson and colleagues, in
a cohort study involving 1.4 million Swedish children, also identified that a previous
diagnosis of type I DM before pregnancy is a risk factor for ASD, increasing the chance of
developing ASD by approximately 1.4 times [111].

In an attempt to understand the mechanism by which gestational hyperglycemia
may induce ASD, Yu and colleagues, using a maternal diabetes animal model, concluded
that the presence of hyperglycemia during pregnancy led to the suppression of Retinoic
Acid-Related Orphan Receptor Alpha (RORA) in offspring, which is associated with autism
development [112]. Furthermore, gestational hyperglycemia may result in the suppression
of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and persistent oxidative stress in the nervous system of
the offspring, leading to behaviors resembling the autism spectrum [113].

2.8. Maternal Obesity

Maternal obesity has become an increasingly evident issue worldwide, often associated
with an increase in maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity [114]. Given the high
prevalence of obesity, it is important to understand its impact during pregnancy, as this
condition involves alterations in lipid metabolism and the presence of chronic inflammation,
situations that can affect the intrauterine fetal development programming [114,115].

It is worth noting the significant involvement of cholesterol and essential fatty acids
in fetal neurodevelopment and how inflammatory conditions are linked to disruptions
in children’s neurological development [115,116]. It is interesting to assess the impacts
of maternal obesity on the etiology of ASD. A meta-analysis by Zhang and colleagues
observed the impact of maternal overweight/obesity on the mental health of children [117].
They highlighted that maternal obesity before pregnancy increased the risk of ASD [OR 1.37
(95% CI 1.22, 1.55)], as well as other neurodevelopmental alterations [117]. In this scenario,
Matias and colleagues, through a case-control study across various locations in the USA,
observed that maternal obesity before pregnancy (BMI 35.0 to ≥40 kg/m2) was associated
with approximately twice the probability of ASD development (Adjusted OR [AOR] = 1.87,
95% CI: 1.40–2.51) [118]. Additionally, when looking at weight gain during pregnancy,
they found a greater association with the development of ASD in males (AOR = 1.47, 95%
CI: 1.15–1.88) [118]. Supporting this finding, another case-control study conducted with
children born in California, USA, utilizing multivariate logistic regression, identified that
maternal obesity was also associated with the diagnosis of childhood ASD (OR = 1.51,
95% CI: 1.07–2.13) [116]. Similar results were also found by Carter and colleagues in
their retrospective, population-based cohort study, which included 308,536 mother–child
pairs [119]. It revealed that maternal obesity had a higher association with the probability
of ASD onset with gastrointestinal disorders (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.22–1.54) [119].

As previously mentioned, obesity induces a dyslipidemic state. In order to determine
the association between maternal postpartum lipid profile and the risk of ASD in children,
Park and colleagues conducted a case-control study involving a total of 7939 mother–child
pairs [115]. A higher association was observed between mothers with elevated BMI (Body
Mass Index) and children diagnosed with ASD [115]. Interestingly, postpartum maternal
levels of total cholesterol (p = 0.03) and LDL (p = 0.01) were significantly lower in mothers
with children with ASD than in neurotypical controls [115].

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 244

10 of 22

In a prospective birth cohort study analyzing data from 756 mother–baby pairs (86 with
ASD) from the Boston Birth Cohort, Panjwani and colleagues identified that low maternal
postpartum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was associated with an increased
risk of ASD [120]. Affirming the previously demonstrated results, Lin and colleagues,
through the analysis of data collected from medical records of over 300 children diagnosed
with ASD, found that obesity, accompanied by reduced cholesterol levels, are significant
factors associated with an ASD diagnosis [121].

Hasegawa and colleagues conducted a longitudinal investigation in obese and healthy
non-human primates, as well as their offspring, aiming to better comprehend the mech-
anisms that correlate maternal obesity with the metabolism and cognitive processes in
the offspring [122]. The results revealed that maternal obesity was associated with ele-
vated levels of inflammation and significant alterations in the metabolites linked to energy
metabolism in both maternal plasma and urine samples, as well as in the placental tis-
sue [122]. Furthermore, the offspring born from obese mothers exhibited behavioral and
emotional changes, along with differences in the phosphorylation of enzymes in the mecha-
nistic target of mTOR signaling pathway in the brain, which is critical for its structural and
functional development [122]. These findings underscore the complexity of interactions
between maternal obesity and neurological development, providing valuable insights into
understanding the risks associated with ASD.

Moreover, it is crucial to highlight the adverse impact of the inflammatory process
during gestational obesity, as well as to recognize the significant role played by lipids in
the etiology of ASD. It is relevant to emphasize that both maternal lipid levels and obesity
are potentially modifiable factors, and interventions targeted at these aspects can play a
crucial role in preventing alterations such as ASD.

2.9. Vitamin D Deficiency

In addition to the great influence of vitamin D on the skeletal system, its impact on the
development of brain functions is also well established, being fundamental for neurotrophic
actions, maturation, differentiation, and neuronal growth [123]. Deficiency of this vitamin
during pregnancy can cause comorbidities such as premature birth, preeclampsia, and
gestational diabetes [124,125]. In addition, studies have associated vitamin D deficiency
during pregnancy with neurobehavioral disorders such as schizophrenia and ASD [124,125].
Epidemiological data suggest that the development of ASD is common in areas where there
is a reduction in the incidence of UVB light, which is responsible for causing the production
of vitamin D by the skin, corroborating the theory that vitamin D deficiency is associated
with ASD [124,125].

A case-control study carried out in Southern California between 2000 and 2003 found
no association between the increased probability of ASD with maternal vitamin D deficiency,
nor a protective effect of increased vitamin D levels in general [126]. Furthermore, Madley-
Dowd and colleagues, using data from a UK-based cohort study involving 62 patients
diagnosed with ASD between 1991 and 1992, where the pregnant woman’s vitamin D levels
were recorded during prenatal care, found no evidence linking maternal vitamin D levels
to a risk of developing ASD [127]. However, the study population is a limitation that may
have interfered with the results of the analysis [127].

On the other hand, a prospective study was carried out using vitamin D supplemen-
tation in pregnant women who already had children diagnosed with ASD in previous
pregnancies, prescribing 5000 IU of D3 per day during pregnancy [128]. As a result, they
obtained a reduction in the rate of ASD recurrence among siblings, which may be due to
supplementation during pregnancy [128]. However, it is important to note that this is a pre-
liminary study [128]. Moreover, a case-control study in Finland, with vitamin D evaluation
in first and second trimesters of pregnancies from 1987 and 2004, and children diagnosed
with ASD and followed until 2015 showed that vitamin D insufficiency (<49.9 nmol/L)
during pregnancy increased the risk of ASD [129]. Lee and colleagues, through a cohort
study in Stockholm, showed that maternal vitamin D insufficiency (25–<50 nmol/L) at

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 244

11 of 22

approximately the 11th week of gestation was correlated with a 1.58 increased risk of
ASD [130].

One possible mechanism by which vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of ASD is by
endocrine disruption. Using an animal model of vitamin D deficiency, Ali and collaborators
demonstrated an increase in testosterone levels in both mothers and male embryos, the
latter being a risk factor for ASD [131]. Additionally, they observed a significant rise in
testosterone in the brains of male embryos, while the enzyme responsible for its elimination,
aromatase, was reduced [131]. These findings suggest a potential association between
vitamin D deficiency, hormonal changes, and the risk of ASD development [131].

Altogether, these studies suggest that lower concentrations of vitamin D in early
pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders,
including ASD.

2.10. Maternal Microbiota Dysfunction

The relationship between the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system has at-
tracted attention, particularly the impact of the gut microbiota on the pathophysiology
of various neurological and psychiatric disorders [132]. Metabolites derived from the gut
microbiota have been shown to have a direct relationship with the enteric nervous system,
as well as being capable of indirect activation [133]. When the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is
intact, its main effect is protection during the critical period of fetal brain development [132].
However, several different metabolites are able to cross the BBB, such as certain amino
acids, carnitine, phenolic derivatives, and products of carbohydrate metabolism [133].

Given the possible involvement of the microbiota in the development of nervous
system disorders, some authors have shed light on the relationship between the maternal
microbiota and the emergence of neurobehavioral alterations [134,135]. A meta-analysis
of experimental studies emphasized the possible effects of the maternal microbiota on the
neurological and behavioral development of the fetus, observing that the disruption of
the maternal microbiota negatively affects behavioral parameters in the offspring, such
as sociability and obsessive-compulsive behavior [134]. In this context, knowing that the
intestinal microbiota can be modulated by diet, Afroz and collaborators performed an
experimental study using a mouse model of parental high salt diet (HSD), where it was
observed that the dietary pattern adopted altered the maternal intestinal microbiota, which
was shared with the offspring, demonstrating that maternal dysbiosis directly influences
the composition of the fetal microbiota [135]. Interestingly, it was found that the offspring
developed behaviors similar to ASD due to changes in the microbiota [135].

In addition to diet, another factor associated with alteration of the gut microbiota is
the use of antibiotics [136]. In this scenario, Morel and collaborators conducted a study
to evaluate the disruption of the maternal intestinal microbiota in mice during a critical
perinatal window by the use of ampicillin and the possible neurobehavioral effects associ-
ated with ASD in the offspring [136]. As in the previous study, they identified changes in
several species of gut bacteria, such as Lactobacillus murinus and Parabacteroides goldsteinii,
in the offspring [136]. They observed that the offspring, especially the males, showed an
altered pattern of ultrasonic communication, reduced social motivation and social inter-
action, as well as anxiety-like behavior [136]. In this context, a population-based study
in Sweden examined the association between antibiotic use during pregnancy and ASD
diagnosis and found that maternal antibiotic use was associated with a higher risk of
childhood ASD [(OR) = 1.16, (95% CI) 1.09–1.23] [137]. It is suggested that changes in the
maternal microbiota caused by antibiotic use may play a role in the development of this
disorder [136,137].

To better understand the impact of maternal microbiota, Cristiano and collaborators
evaluated the effect of maternal treatment of BTBR mice with the intestinal microbial
metabolite butyrate (BUT), a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced in the colon by bacterial
fermentation of dietary fiber and resistant starch [138]. In this study, the authors found that
BUT attenuated ASD-like behaviors in offspring and reduced morphological and functional

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 244

12 of 22

alterations of the cerebellar cortex in offspring [138]. This demonstrates how modulation of
the maternal gut microbiota can have beneficial effects in preventing ASD-like behaviors.
Experimental studies using a preclinical mouse model highlight that maternal intesti-
nal commensal bacteria can induce Th17 cells and interleukin 17 (IL-17A), which could
potentially increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in the children of pregnant
mothers exposed to immune system activation due to infection or autoinflammatory syn-
dromes [139,140]. In addition, Morel and colleagues found that the behavioral phenotype
found in male offspring of mice with disturbed gut microbiota was associated with de-
creased gene expression of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) and identified a reduction in
several tight junction proteins in the prefrontal cortex, a region associated with the process
of regulating social and emotional behaviors [136].

It should be emphasized that the evaluation of maternal microbiota and the etiology
of ASD is still an emerging topic and more human studies are needed to better define the
relationship between the two factors.

3. The Influence of Gestational Diseases
3.1. Preeclampsia

Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder that affects 3–5% of all pregnancies and is
related to high rates of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, accounting for around
63,000 maternal deaths per year [141–143]. The main symptoms related to this syndrome
are hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, and it can be associated with proteinuria and
organ damage, such as liver, kidney, brain, and placenta [143,144]. The pathophysiology
of preeclampsia is complex, but it is known that abnormal placentation is a key factor
in its development [145,146]. The defective invasion of the uterine spiral arteries by
extravillous cytotrophoblast cells is the main cause of the development of the most severe
forms [145,146]. Due to this defect in arterial remodeling, there is an increase in vascular
resistance, which can result in placental ischemia due to hypoperfusion and oxidative
stress, as well as a reduction in the nutritional supply to the fetus [145,146]. Placental
ischemia and insufficiency are related to various fetal alterations, such as reduced fetal
oxygenation, intrauterine growth restriction, and abnormal neurodevelopment, among
other complications [144–146].

A retrospective population study carried out in Sweden, with 1,645,455 neonates
born between 2000 and 2016, compared the rate of ASD between children exposed and
not exposed to preeclampsia [147]. The results indicated higher rates of ASD in children
exposed to preeclampsia, suggesting the importance of defects in placental formation in the
etiology of ASD [147]. Moreover, previous studies have already established a link between
preeclampsia and the development of ASD [144,148–150]. In order to understand the
mechanism underlying the relationship between preeclampsia and ASD, Liu and colleagues
carried out a preclinical study using an animal model of preeclampsia [151]. The results
showed that the offspring exhibited behavioral and neurodevelopmental symptoms related
to ASD, with an unbalance of inflammatory markers produced by TNFα/NFκB signaling
axis [151]. These findings suggest that the imbalance in the production of pro-inflammatory
factors during the preeclamptic pregnancy may play a role in the development of ASD [151].

3.2. Viral Infections

The occurrence of viral infections during pregnancy can lead to various complica-
tions, such as miscarriage, congenital viral syndromes, and impaired fetal neurodevelop-
ment [152,153]. These situations result from the breakdown of the immune balance that is
essential for the correct development of a pregnancy [152,153]. In a population-based study
involving Danish children, Atladóttir and colleagues identified a significant association
between viral infections in the first trimester of pregnancy and an increased risk of ASD in
their children, suggesting that early viral infection may be a risk factor for ASD [152].

Among the viruses that cause damage to the fetus is the rubella virus, responsible for
Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) [154]. Children with CRS have characteristics similar

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 244

13 of 22

to ASD, such as hyperactivity, reduced cerebral perfusion in comparable areas, increased
muscle tone, and a predisposition to developing type 1 diabetes [154]. These similarities
support the hypothesis that the rubella virus is involved in ASD [154]. In addition to
rubella, the relationship between cytomegalovirus (CMV) and ASD has been studied
since the 1980s [155]. Maeyama and collaborators, in a literature review, observed a high
prevalence of congenital CMV infection in children with ASD [155]. Moreover, Slawinski
and colleagues found an association between CMV infection and ASD [156]. Another viral
infection that is known to cross the placental barrier is the ZIKA viral infection [157]. The
ZIKA virus is also linked to the development of neonatal syndromes, with microcephaly
being the main alteration identified [157]. In addition to microcephaly, children affected
by the ZIKA virus congenital syndrome can present alterations in neurodevelopment,
and language difficulties [158]. The relationship between maternal ZIKA virus infection
and the development of ASD was first investigated by Santi and collaborators in a case
study [159]. The only disturbance during pregnancy was the mother’s infection with the
ZIKA virus [159]. The neonate was born without microcephaly and was diagnosed with
ASD at the age of 3, according to clinical tests and confirmed by DSM-V [159].

3.3. Bacterial Infections

During pregnancy, bacterial infections can trigger inflammation of the placenta and
fetal membranes, resulting in placentitis, deciduitis, and chorioamnionitis [160]. The in-
flammation of these membranes is largely associated with the rise of bacteria through the
vaginal canal into the uterus [160]. Common pathological microorganisms in intrauter-
ine infections include Ureaplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoea,
Mycoplasma hominis, group B streptococcus, and Trichomonas vaginalis [161]. In chorioam-
nionitis, in addition to these, there is the possible presence of anaerobic Gram-negative or-
ganisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycoplasma
ssp. [161]. Viruses and fungi are also associated with the development of chorioamnionitis,
such as CMV, enterovirus, human papillomavirus (HPV), Zika virus and other arboviruses,
and Candida spp. [162].

The exacerbated inflammatory response triggered by the bacterial infection has the
potential to cause brain damage in the developing fetus, resulting in changes in cogni-
tive and psychological functions in children, such as cerebral palsy, schizophrenia, and
ASD [160,163,164]. A population-based case-control study involving 4184 children diag-
nosed with ASD highlighted the potential impact of bacterial infections in the prenatal
period, especially during the third trimester, by establishing an association between the
presence of infection and the development of ASD [165]. Similar research conducted
by Zerbo and colleagues concluded that multiple infections, especially those caused by
bacteria, are related to an increased risk of ASD (ORadj = 1.36, 95% CI 1.05–1.78) [166].

In a preclinical model of maternal immune activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
Dutra and collaborators found that the offspring showed behaviors characteristic of ASD,
such as changes in social interaction and stereotyped movements [167]. Additionally, in an
animal model of GBS-induced chorioamnionitis, Bergeron and colleagues observed that
only male pups developed deficits in motor behavior and social alterations [168]. Elevated
levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and polymorphonuclear cell infiltrates were predominantly present
in males, correlating with the higher incidence of ASD in males [169]. Considering that
IL-1β is a characteristic of the inflammatory response induced by GBS, Ayash and collabo-
rators demonstrated in vivo that blocking IL-1β in GBS-induced chorioamnionitis at the
end of gestation can result in a reduction in GBS-induced placental and fetal inflammation
without aggravating the infection, indicating a possible prevention of neurobehavioral
complications related to this cytokine [170].

4. Conclusions/Future Directions

ASD stands out as one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders, revealing
a significant increase in its incidence over the years. Understanding its causes is crucial

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 244

to directing future prevention and mitigation measures, a challenge that involves health
professionals and others. Faced with a scenario in which the causes of ASD are widely
debated, there is a consensus that the phenomenon may be multifactorial (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Multifactorial elements involved in risk for ASD development during pregnancy.

Although the role of genetics is undeniable in many ASD cases, herein the close link
between external factors and pregnancy were compiled, highlighting their significant influ-
ence on fetal development, especially on the nervous system. It is essential to understand
the main risk factors associated with the environment and pregnancy, as they are modifi-
able and can therefore be effective targets for preventing ASD. The intersection between
environment, pregnancy, and risk factors has become a fertile field for research, promising
not only in-depth understanding but also effective strategies to mitigate the incidence
of ASD.
