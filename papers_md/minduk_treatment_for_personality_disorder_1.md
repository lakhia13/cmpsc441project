- Treatment for personality disorder

If you're diagnosed with personality disorder, there are treatments that can help with how you feel.

You might have to try a few things to work out what helps you most. And you might find that different things work better at different times.

This page covers:

- Talking therapies

- How do I get treatment?

- Will I have to go to hospital?

- How can I have a say in my treatment?

This page is part of our guide to:

Personality disorder

All my life I have felt different, alienated and completely alone. It is only since my diagnosis of BPD that I began to understand why and, with help, to realise that I could actually do something to change those feelings and feel that I can achieve a life worth living.


## Talking therapies


Current evidence shows that talking therapies are the most helpful treatment for those of us with a diagnosis of personality disorder.

These types of talking therapies may help. But we need more research to know which is the most effective.


### Dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT)


DBT helps you learn skills to manage your emotions and behaviour. You might be on your own with a therapist, or part of a group. See our pages onDBTfor more information.


### Mentalisation-based therapy (MBT)


MBT can help you recognise what you think and feel. And understand how other people may think or feel. It also helps to understand how these thoughts and feelings can affect how someone behaves.

It's a long-term therapy. And it can take place on your own with a therapist, or as a group.

Mentalisation is best summed up as 'thinking about thinking'. It is being able to understand our own mental state and that of other people, and how this effects our behaviour. I identified with it immediately, as I really struggle with identifying what my emotions are and where they come from.


### Structured clinical management (SCM)


SCM can help you address things you find difficult. And to develop and meet goals.

You might focus on areas such as problem solving and managing your emotions and behaviour. It involves individual and group therapies.


### Cognitive analytic therapy (CAT)


CAT is similar tocognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). It can help you identify patterns that are causing problems in your life. And look at where you may have learnt these from your early life experiences.

You then look at which patterns are helpful or unhelpful. And find different ways to prevent negative feelings or experiences.


### Talking about borderline personality disorder (BPD)


Watch Lechelle and Debbie talk about having borderline personality disorder. They discuss how a combination of medication and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) helps them manage it.

Some doctors may prescribe medication for people diagnosed with personality disorder. This might includeantidepressants,antipsychoticsormood stabilisers.

These medications aren't licensed to treat personality disorder specifically. But you may be prescribed them to manage certain feelings or behaviour. You may also be prescribed them for other mental health problems. For example,depressionoranxiety.

Your doctor should give you information about any medications you take. This information should be in a format that you can access and understand.

They should also give you regular check-ups to review your medication. So, if this isn't happening and you'd like to talk about your medication, make an appointment to discuss it with your doctor.

Medication really helps some of us but isn't right for others. Before deciding to take any drug, it's important to make sure you have all the facts you need to make an informed choice.

See our pages onthings to consider before taking medicationandyour right to refuse medicationfor more information. Our pages oncoming off medicationgive guidance on how to come off medication safely.

If you're diagnosed with personality disorder, art therapy could help. This includes if you find it hard to express how you're feeling.

It can also help if you struggle to control your emotions. This is because it offers a structured way to express yourself.

See our page aboutarts and creative therapiesfor more information.

Drawing is my therapy. I have a short period of calm inside my very busy brain thanks to my art.


## How do I get treatment?


Whether a specific treatment is available in your area will depend on where you live. To get treatment through the NHS, you should contact your GP.

They can refer you to your local community mental health team (CMHT) for an assessment. Visit our page onsupport servicesto learn more about CMHTs.

Or they might refer you to another specialist service. The names for these services may differ depending on where you live. For example, you might also hear them called:

- Complex emotional needs (CEN) services

- Community mental health hubs

- Personality disorder services

In some areas, you may be able to contact your local service yourself. This is called self-referral. You can talk to your GP for advice on self-referral.

Some NHS trusts also run programmes where you can learn about personality disorder. And the different therapies that might help. They can support you if you're not sure what treatment might help.

Stand up for yourself and what living with this means. We are wonderfully emotionally vibrant individuals that need real help, and do not be disheartened. It can take a lot of door knocking to arrive at a destination.


## Will I have to go to hospital?


Many people diagnosed with personality disorder are treated outside hospital.

In rare cases, your doctors may suggest treatment in hospital. This is more likely if you're in crisis and may risk harming yourself or others. But this should only be a last resort.

We have more information aboutgetting hospital treatment for your mental health.


## How can I have a say in my treatment?


An important factor in your treatment is the relationship you have with the professionals who are helping you.

You should be able to discuss your treatment with your GP or psychiatrist. Your views and preferences should always be considered when making decisions about your treatment.

You're also likely to get a care plan if you're under the care of a CMHT or other specialist team. A care plan is an agreement between you and the professionals you're working with.

Your care plan should include the problems you want help with, any treatments you may need and what you want to get out of your treatment. It should also cover planning for a crisis.

Our pages onseeking help for a mental health problemhave more information on having your say. And what you can do if you're unhappy with your treatment.
