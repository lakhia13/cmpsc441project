Abstract There are contemporary indicators that parent
proxy-ratings and child self-ratings of a child’s quality of
life (QoL) are not interchangeable. This review examines
dual informant studies to assess parent–child agreement on
the QoL of children with attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity
disorder. A systematic search of four major databases
(PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane data-
bases) was completed, and related peer-reviewed journals
were hand-searched. Studies which reported quantitative
QoL ratings for matched parent and child dyads were
screened in accordance with relevant inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria. Key ﬁndings were extracted from thirteen
relevant studies, which were rated for conformity to the
recommendations of an adapted version of the STROBE
statement guidelines for observational studies.
In the
majority of studies reviewed, children rated their QoL more
highly than their parents. There was some evidence for
greater agreement on the physical health domain than
psychosocial domains.

Introduction

Quality of life in children with ADHD

Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is, cur-
rently, the name given to describe a group of symptoms
that broadly encompass
inattentive, hyperactive and
impulsive behaviours (with inattentive, hyperactive/im-
pulsive and combined subtypes). There remains strong
professional incongruity regarding what exactly ADHD is,
and how it should be managed. It has consequentially
received signiﬁcant attention in the media. Controversies
exist in relation to a number of factors, including variances
in international diagnostic rates, variances in diagnostic
rates within local services or between individual clinicians,
anxieties about the use of stimulant medication with chil-
dren, the role of pharmaceutical companies, and whether
ADHD is a ‘real disorder’ or a social construct.

What exactly causes ADHD remains an unknown. It is
categorised as a neuro-developmental disorder in the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5TM
(5th ed.) (American Psychiatric Association 2013). MRI and
PET scans show that changes in brain structure in the frontal
regions are consistently found in children with ADHD (Krain
and Castellanos 2006). However, some argue that it is not
possible to assess whether brain differences are caused by
(rather than being the cause of) different ways of thinking.
Some also argue that stimulant medications, which are
undeniably effective in reducing ADHD symptoms, would
improve concentration in us all. Others are concerned that we
may be unnecessarily medicalising children, and refer to
ADHD as a ‘cultural construct’, where increasing rates of
diagnosis are seen as a result of society’s growing intolerance
to behaviour that does not conform. For a more in-depth
analysis of this debate, see Timmi and Taylor (2003).

Regardless of the controversies surrounding ADHD, it
remains one of the most highly prevalent health diagnoses
among children and adolescents, affecting an estimated
3–7% of school-aged children (Daviss 2008), with preva-
lence tending to be higher among males than females
(Willcutt 2012). Symptoms usually continue into adulthood
and are associated with impairments in academic, social
and emotional functioning (Cantwell 1996). Co-morbidity
next
to ADHD is the norm rather than the exception
(Thompson et al. 2004) with oppositional deﬁant disorder
(ODD), conduct disorder (CD), learning disability (LD),
anxiety disorders and depression most commonly co-oc-
curring (Biederman et al. 1991). Children who receive a
diagnosis of ADHD tend to have poorer outcomes than
control group children. They have an increased risk of low
self-esteem, poor academic achievement, family and peer
relationships problems, anti-social behaviour and criminal
activity (Biederman et al. 1991). Leading neuroscientist,
Dr. Bruce Perry, described the emotional dysregulation that
often occurs between parents and their children when
children with ADHD are struggling (Boffey 2014). He
highlights the importance of implementing a combination
of therapeutic approaches that aim to support parents to
regulate themselves and break the cycle of negative
feedback.

Available studies largely and consistently indicate that
children with a diagnosis of ADHD experience impaired
quality of life (QoL) (Danckaerts et al. 2010). The World
Health Organisation (1995, p. 1450) deﬁned QoL as ‘The
in the
individual’s perception of their position in life,
context of culture and value systems in which they live,
and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and
concerns’. However, until very recently, the majority of
studies in this area have reported only parent proxy-mea-
sures of a child’s QoL. Therefore, the child’s subjective
experience of
relatively
undisclosed.

living with ADHD remains

In their major review of paediatric ADHD QoL studies,
Danckaerts et al. (2010) reported that of the 36 studies they
reviewed, 29 included parent only ratings, three studies
used only child-rated measures, while only four studies
utilised both parent and child ratings. The authors reported
that the child self-report data were much less robust in
establishing correlations between QoL and ADHD than the
parent-reported data. In two of the seven studies which
utilised child-reported measures, children did not consider
their QoL to be more impaired than healthy controls
(Klassen et al. 2006; Landgfuf and Abetz 1997). Further,
some of the data from the four dual informant studies
indicated that there may be some discrepancies between
parent and child perceptions of the child’s QoL. One study
found that children rated their QoL more positively than
physical

functioning (Klassen et al. 2006). Another reported dis-
crepancies between child and parent ratings on the domains
of physical health and home life (children rated higher),
and bodily functions and positive moods (parents rated
higher) (Flapper and Schoemaker 2008).

The review authors suggested that the child-reported
data could in some way have been affected by the measures
used. They highlight that the two studies where children
did not rate their QoL differently from controls both used
the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ), while the four
others (which used other QoL measures) reported reduced
QoL. They also suggest that less robust ratings may be a
result of children minimising their difﬁculties or an
impulsive response style. Further, the authors proposed that
parent ratings may be affected by the encumbrance of
caring for a child with ADHD symptoms, i.e. their own
QoL is affected. Indeed, some QoL studies for other con-
ditions have reported a link between parental emotional
distress and more negative perceptions of their child’s QoL
(Janicke et al. 2007; Kobayashi and Kamibeppu 2011).

Measuring paediatric quality of life

In relation to health conditions, the many available deﬁ-
nitions of QoL emphasise the desired condition as one of
general well-being, in which a person encounters a range of
daily experiences, unconstrained by the potentially
unpleasant and debilitating effects of a disorder. Studying
QoL is particularly important in chronic conditions, where
the focus of treatment is often on the management of
symptoms, as opposed to being curative (Ingerski et al.
2010; Varni et al. 2007). When measuring the effectiveness
of paediatric treatment interventions, there is an evolving
realisation that it is not simply a reduction of symptoms
that is important, but also children’s longitudinal capacity
to enjoy and participate in the multi-dimensional aspects of
their daily lives. Consideration must be given to whether
any illness intervention can be said to be effective if it does
not improve the child’s lived experience.

Generic QoL instruments are fundamentally multi-di-
mensional and usually contain, as a minimum, the core
domains of physical, psychological, social and cognitive
functioning (Eiser and Varni 2013). However, although the
core domains are usually present, they are often deﬁned
differently, and instruments commonly break them down
further into different sub-domains (Danckaerts et al. 2010).
As a consequence, it is reasonable to assume that different
QoL instruments may not always measure the same things
or indeed cover the necessary ground to ascertain a full
understanding of QoL. In this sense, it can be challenging
to compare studies which have employed differing QoL
outcome measures. Some condition-speciﬁc measures have
been developed, such as the Paediatric Quality of Life

Inventory (Peds-QL) cancer module (Varni et al. 2002).
While these will no doubt provide detailed insight and
sensitivity to the impact of a speciﬁc set of symptoms, they
do not allow for comparisons with other health conditions
or with normative samples.

Parent proxy-report in paediatric QoL research

The very nature of the concept of QoL as a ‘lived experi-
ence’ should predict that the key informant would be the
individual whose QoL is in question. However, studies
investigating paediatric QoL have generally utilised only
parent proxy-reports to provide a measure of a child’s QoL.
This may be problematic, as some research has shown that
parent and child reports on this concept are not inter-
changeable (Eiser and Morse 2001; Klassen et al. 2006).
Parent proxy-measures provide, at best, an informed esti-
mate of how a parent expects their child to feel in many
(often unobserved) contexts and, at worst, a poor and
misleading judgement of the internal world of a child into
whom they have little, or misconstrued, insight. This pat-
tern has in the past been justiﬁed by the belief that children
had not yet achieved a sufﬁcient level of cognitive and
linguistic development to enable self-completion of QoL
measures (Upton et al. 2008). However, several instru-
ments designed to measure self-rated QoL in children as
young as ﬁve have been developed in recent years [e.g.
Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Peds-QL)] (Varni
et al. 1999);
the CHQ (Landgraf et al. 1996); and
KIDSCREEN (Ravens-Sieberer et al. 2007), and research
has demonstrated that children are able to reliably assess
their own QoL (Cremeens et al. 2006; Varni et al. 2007).
The use of child-rated measures does not render parent
perceptions redundant, however. When a child is too
impaired to express her views, or is unwilling, parent rat-
ings may be the only available option. Additionally, parent
accessing of healthcare and support services for their child
is, in the main, predicted by their perceptions of their
child’s QoL (Varni et al. 2001). Further, the level of con-
cordance between parents and their children in assessing
the child’s QoL could potentially have signiﬁcant clinical
relevance to chronic conditions. A comparison of both
perspectives could offer clinicians valuable insight into
how features of the condition might affect
the child’s
internal perceptions relative to others’ external perceptions.
Simply put, there may be no ‘true representation’ of the
child’s QoL, rather than both perspectives are likely to
relay important
information regarding the nature and
impact of the condition. Assessing both perspectives may
also provide insight into the nature of the relationship
between parent and child and the expectations they indi-
vidually possess regarding the condition and available
treatments. Investigating the sources of any discrepancies

which arise between them may in turn inﬂuence clinical
decision-making regarding key areas for intervention.

Parent–child concordance on QoL measures

Previous reviews have investigated parent–child agreement
on QoL measures, featuring study samples of children with
a range of chronic health diagnoses and healthy control
groups (Eiser and Morse 2001; Eiser and Varni 2013;
Upton et al. 2008). These reviews report consistent dis-
crepancies between parent proxy-reports and child self-
reports. It is possible that these discrepancies reﬂect a
wider perceptual issue between self and proxy-raters in
general. However, studies have suggested that parents of
healthy children generally rate them as having better QoL
than the children rate themselves (Jozeﬁak et al. 2008),
while this trend is reversed in children with health condi-
tions (Eiser and Morse 2001; Upton et al. 2008). This
would suggest there is a relationship between the child’s
health status and how children and their parents perceive
the child’s experiences.
Inter-rater agreement

is often highest for objective,
externalising domains like walking, running, aggression,
school refusal and hyperactive behaviour, while there is
generally less concordance for internalising, emotion-based
domains such as fatigue, pain, sadness and worry (Eiser
and Morse 2001). This suggests that parents are better at
interpreting their child’s observable behaviour than their
internal state of mind. However, this trend can be found to
be reversed in the literature both within and between dif-
ferent health conditions (e.g. van Gent et al. 2007; Czy-
zewski et al. 1994).

The ﬁndings described offer valuable insights into pat-
terns of concordance between child and parent reports
across QoL studies for children with a range of health
conditions. However, comparing samples across conditions
can be problematic given that deﬁnitions of a diagnosis can
be broad (e.g. cancer) and that each condition will have its
own symptoms, treatments and prognosis. Thus, the indi-
vidual domains of QoL measures may be affected, to a
greater or lesser degree, by each condition. Potentially, this
will lead to differing levels and patterns of concordance
between children and their parents on QoL measures. This
issue highlights a need for condition-speciﬁc research
which utilises parent and child ratings of the child’s QoL,
so that the unique contributing factors of the associated
symptomatology can be explored.

Due to the small number of studies incorporating chil-
dren’s views, any existing inconsistencies between parent
and child perceptions of child QoL are not well studied in
the context of ADHD. A focussed review of further studies
is necessary to explore the patterns of concordance
between child and parent perceptions in detail and to

deduce what factors might underlie any discrepancies.
Since Danckaerts et al.’s (2010) review, a number of
additional studies have been published which have reported
both child- and parent-rated measures of child QoL. A
systematic review of this material is now warranted.

data, only studies which featured instruments that mea-
sured the same content and constructs for self and proxy-
reports, using parallel questions and rating scales, were
included. QoL measures which utilised a single item
measure were not included.

Aim of the review

The aim of this review was to systematically examine the
existing empirical data regarding the level of agreement
between parent proxy- and child self-report ratings of the
QoL of children with a diagnosis of ADHD, as measured
by quantitative QoL instruments.

Method

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Language

Studies that were not published in the English language
were excluded from the review due to a lack of translation
resources available to the reviewer.

Literature search strategy and study selection

Study selection was achieved by completing literature
searches of electronic databases and hand searching of
speciﬁc relevant electronic journals. Reference lists from
studies selected for inclusion were also reviewed (see
Fig. 1).

Population

Electronic database searches

Studies were included where the target population was
children with a diagnosis of ADHD aged 0–18 years.
Samples were included regardless of whether co-morbidi-
ties were present or had been purposely excluded.

Study design

In the light of the nature of the research question, it was
anticipated that observational studies would be most
prevalent, of cross-sectional, case–control and cohort study
design. However, randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
were not excluded from the review. Studies were included
if they used a quantitative design and either compared or
reported data (sample size, means and standard deviations)
from QoL measures for matched parent and child dyads.
Where treatment outcome studies were included, baseline
QoL measures were used. Studies which provided only
child self-reports or parent/carer proxy-reports were
excluded. Studies where someone other than the par-
ent/carer was the proxy-rater (e.g. teachers or clinicians)
were excluded. Studies which utilised control groups or a
single group sample were included. Due to issues of gen-
eralisability and increased bias, single case studies were
excluded.

Outcome measures

Studies were included if they aimed to measure the QoL of
children with a diagnosis of ADHD, using a standardised
QoL instrument with established psychometric properties.
To enable a meaningful inter-rater comparison of QoL

123

The databases searched were PsycINFO (1806–January
2015), EMBASE (1974–January 2015), MEDLINE (1946–
January 2015) and Cochrane Library database (1999–Jan-
uary 2015). The databases were searched by entering the
terms (ADHD OR attention deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder)
AND (QoL) within the domains of title, abstract and key-
word/subject heading. A total of 153 items were returned
using this search strategy after duplicates were removed.

Hand searching of selected journals

Three journals were hand-searched based on their rele-
vance to the research area or their frequency as publishers
of the studies that met
the inclusion criteria from the
database searches. These were: ADHD: attention deﬁcit
and hyperactivity disorders; European Journal of Child &
Adolescent Psychiatry; and Journal of Attention Disorders.
These journals were searched from the year 2004–2015
(January). This search returned two potentially relevant
studies for further screening.

Reference list searches

One further study was obtained using the snowball tech-
nique (i.e. reviewing the reference lists of studies which
met the inclusion criteria) (Schei et al. 2013).

meta-analyses and interpreting results. Formal quality
assessment tools are increasingly well developed in the
context of clinical trials and RCTs (Deeks et al. 2003).
However, less consideration has been given to the use of
similar instruments for appraising observational studies.
Recent reviews have concluded that there is no one distinct
tool advocated for this task (Jarde et al. 2012; Sanderson
et al. 2007). For the current review, the STROBE (von Elm
et al. 2007) statement guidelines for observational studies

have been utilised to evaluate the quality of the included
studies. Although the intended purpose of STROBE was to
act as a reporting guide to authors of observational studies,
it has been endorsed by researchers as a starting point for
the methodological appraisal of non-experimental studies
(Sanderson et al. 2007). Its popularity may be attributed to
the comprehensive method of its development and the
presence of criteria that appear to evaluate bias (Sanderson
et al. 2007).

The quality review does not provide a comparative
measure across included studies, given that each of the
recommendations is not equally weighted. It does, how-
ever, provide an indication as to whether the recommended
methodological and reporting aspects of the research pro-
cess were present for each study. Issues relating to research
methodology allow readers to assess how well a study has
been designed and conducted and therefore consider how
valid and generalisable the results can be assumed to be.
Issues relating to reporting of research allow readers to
consider how well authors have detailed, explained and/or
interpreted their methods and ﬁndings. For the purpose of
this review, methodological conformity to the recommen-
dations took precedence over reporting conformity, given
that it is the results of each study, rather than their inter-
pretation by the authors, which are most relevant to the
research question.

Some adaptations were made to the criteria in order to
increase their relevance to the research question. The main
adaptations reduced the number of unnecessary criteria or
reworded given criteria to reﬂect methodological quality
rather than reporting quality. The adaptations are presented
in Table 1. Conformity to the items of the adapted STROBE
statement guidelines was rated for each of the included
studies using a binary judgement (Yes/No). A further rating
of N/A (not applicable) was applied where appropriate. The
recommendations comprise of six main areas (Title/Ab-
stract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion and Other
Information), some of which incorporate sub-items (for the
full guidelines, see ‘Appendix’). A comprehensive deﬁnition
of each recommendation is detailed in Vandenbroucke
(2007). All thirteen papers were independently coded by the
ﬁrst author, and a randomly generated sample of six papers
(46.2%) was cross-rated by the second author. The inter-rater
reliability was found to be 0.79 (p \ .001), indicating ‘sub-
stantial’ reliability (Landis and Koch 1977).

Results

Thirteen studies that met the inclusion criteria were iden-
tiﬁed (Table 2). The studies were published across nine
different countries: USA (3); the Netherlands (2); Norway
(2); Iran (1); Thailand (1); Canada (1); Australia (1); Brazil
(1); and Turkey (1).

Characteristics of included studies

Table 2 lists the included studies and provides an overview
of the main ﬁndings of each study as relevant
to the
research question. Seven were cross-sectional in design,
four were case–control studies, one was an open-label trial,
and one was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
trial.

Sample characteristics

In total, 13 studies included 967 matched parent–child
dyads, where the child had a diagnosis of ADHD. The
number of dyads in each study ranged from 17 to 194.
Children ranged in age from 5 to 18 years. In general, boys
represented a higher proportion of the samples, ranging
from 55.2 to 95.7%.

Four of the studies in the review excluded participants
with conditions co-occurring with ADHD (Bastiaansen
et al. 2004; Flapper and Schoemaker 2008; Schei et al.
2013; Varni and Burwinkle 2006), six did not exclude
participants with co-morbidities at all (Klassen et al. 2006;
Thaulow and Jozeﬁak 2012; Sciberras et al. 2011; Limbers
et al. 2011a, b; Gu¨rkan et al. 2010), one study limited co-
morbidities to ODD (Marques et al. 2013), and two studies
did not provide information about whether or not co-mor-
bidities were excluded (Jafari et al. 2011; Pongwilairat
et al. 2005).

Is there a difference between child self-ratings and parent proxy-ratings of the quality of life…

Quality of life measures

Quality ratings of included studies

Five unique QoL measures were utilised by the studies
included in the review:
the Paediatric Quality of Life
Inventory (Peds-QL) (Varni et al. 1999); the Inventory of
Life Quality in Children and Adolescents (ILC) (Mattejat
and Remschmidt 2006); the CHQ (Landgraf et al. 1996);
the Dutch-Child-AZL-TNO-Quality-of-Life
(DUX-25)
(Kolsteren et al. 2001); and the TNO-AZL-Child-Quality-
of-Life (TACQOL) (Vogels et al. 1998). All of these
instruments have been demonstrated to have accept-
able psychometric properties. Nine (69.2%) of the studies
used the Peds-QL (Bastiaansen et al. 2004; Gu¨rkan et al.
2010; Jafari et al. 2011; Limbers et al. 2011a, b; Marques
et al. 2013; Pongwilairat et al. 2005; Sciberras et al. 2011),
2 (15.4%) used the ILC (Schei et al. 2013; Thaulow and
Jozeﬁak 2012), 1 (7.7%) used the CHQ (Klassen et al.
2006), and 1 (7.7%) used both the DUX-25 and the
TACQOL (Flapper and Schoemaker 2008). Despite the
popularity of the Child Health Illness Proﬁle (CHIP) in
ADHD studies, the authors did not ﬁnd any studies which
utilised this measure in a way that met criteria for inclusion
in this review.

Statistical analyses

A range of different statistical analyses were utilised
among the included studies in order to compare parent and
child ratings. Six studies used t tests (Thaulow and Jozeﬁak
2012; Sciberras et al. 2011; Limbers et al. 2011a; Flapper
and Schoemaker 2008; Klassen et al. 2006; Schei et al.
2013), and one study used the Bland–Altman method
(Marques et al. 2013). Three studies utilised Cronbach’s
alpha coefﬁcients and Pearson intra-class correlations to
compare levels of concordance between parent- and child-
rated measures (Bastiaansen et al. 2004; Klassen et al.
2006; Varni and Burwinkle 2006).

For ﬁve studies, it was necessary for the author to
carry out additional statistical analysis to directly com-
pare the QoL data reported for the purpose of the review
(Jafari et al. 2011; Pongwilairat et al. 2005; Limbers
et al. 2011b; Gu¨ rkan et al. 2010; Bastiaansen et al. 2004).
These studies all reported the number of participants in
each comparison group, means for the total and domain
QoL scores for parents and children, as well as the rel-
the
evant standard deviations. With this information,
author was able to estimate whether there were statisti-
cally signiﬁcant differences between the two groups of
data using an online t test calculator, GraphPad data
analysis software (http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/
ttest1/?Format=SD).

Table 3 presents an overview of how closely the thirteen
reviewed studies’ conformed to the recommendations from
the adapted STROBE guidance statement.

The included studies varied signiﬁcantly in terms of
their conformity to the applied quality criteria. Two of the
papers in particular did not meet a large number of the
criteria (Jafari et al. 2011; Pongwilairat et al. 2005). There
is some doubt therefore, as to whether these studies in
particular applied the necessary methodological rigour to
achieve a valid or representative result. They are included
in the review; however, results are discussed with their
methodological issues in mind.

In addition, across the range of studies, there were a
number of criteria which authors commonly failed to report
or address, as exempliﬁed in the STROBE elaboration
paper (Vandenbroucke 2007). The most commonly unre-
ported methodological issues were not providing a ratio-
nale for how study size was calculated (item 10; 12 studies
did not address), not addressing how missing data were
handled in the statistical analysis of results (item 12c; nine
studies did not address), not giving reasons for non-par-
ticipation (item 13b; eight studies did not address), and not
providing the number of participants with missing data at
each stage of the study (item 14b; eight studies did not
report). The most commonly unaddressed reporting issues
were: not reporting the relevant dates/time period within
which data were collected (item 5b; six studies did not
report) and failing to discuss the direction and magnitude
of the limitations reported (item 19b; 11 studies did not
report). These issues, although important, are less likely to
directly impact results. Given these issues, the ﬁndings
presented in this review should therefore be interpreted
cautiously.

Summary of results

Parent–child agreement on total QoL scores

Total QoL scores were available for twelve of the thirteen
included studies. Eight of the twelve studies (66.6%)
reported signiﬁcantly higher child self-reported total QoL
scores when compared with parent proxy-reported QoL
scores (Sciberras et al. 2011; Limbers et al. 2011a; Jafari
et al. 2011; Pongwilairat et al. 2005; Bastiaansen et al.
2004; Gu¨rkan et al. 2010; Thaulow and Jozeﬁak 2012;
Schei et al. 2013). Four of the studies (33.3%) reported no
statistically signiﬁcant differences in total QoL scores
(Marques et al. 2013; Varni and Burwinkle 2006; Limbers
et al. 2011b; Flapper and Schoemaker 2008). One study did

not report a total QoL score, only domains (Klassen et al.
2006).

Parent–child agreement across outcome measures

In six of the nine studies which utilised the Peds-QL
(66.6%), children rated their overall QoL signiﬁcantly
higher than their parents rated their QoL (Sciberras et al.
2011; Limbers et al. 2011a; Jafari et al. 2011; Pongwilairat
et al. 2005; Bastiaansen et al. 2004; Gu¨rkan et al. 2010). In
the three remaining studies which used the Peds-QL, no
signiﬁcant differences were found between overall parent
and child ratings of QoL (Marques et al. 2013; Varni and
Burwinkle 2006; Limbers et al. 2011a). One of these three
studies utilised a relatively small sample size compared to
the others in the review (n = 17) (Limbers 2011). Both of
the two studies which utilised the ILC reported that chil-
dren rated their overall QoL signiﬁcantly higher than their
parents rated them (Schei et al. 2013; Thaulow and Joze-
ﬁak 2012). The study which utilised the TACQOL and the
DUX-25 reported no signiﬁcant differences in total QoL
scores (Flapper and Schoemaker 2008). The study which
utilised the CHQ did not report total QoL scores but did
report signiﬁcant discrepancies across domains in the
direction of children rating QoL higher than their parents
(Klassen et al. 2006).

Parent–child agreement on QoL domains

Across the whole sample of studies, 11 (84.6%) reported
data for QoL domains. Individual domain scores were not
reported by either of the ILC studies (Schei et al. 2013;
Thaulow and Jozeﬁak 2012). One study reported discrep-
ancies across all domains (Bastiaansen et al. 2004). Four of
the eleven studies (36.4%), all using the Peds-QL, reported
higher parent–child agreement on physical health than on
psychosocial domains (social, school and emotional expe-
rience) (Sciberras et al. 2011; Marques et al. 2013; Limbers
et al. 2011a; Jafari et al. 2011). In one study, also using the
Peds-QL, this trend was reversed, with greater agreement
on psychosocial domains than physical domains (Pong-
wilairat et al. 2005).

Klassen et al. (2006) using the CHQ reported that the
direction of the observed discrepancies between child and
parent ratings was different for physical (children rated
(children rated
lower) versus psychosocial domains
higher), suggesting signiﬁcant directional differences in
parent and child perceptions according to the type of
domain in question. Flapper and Schoemaker
(2008)
reported discrepancies across both observable and subjec-
tive domains. Children rated themselves as having better

QoL in the ‘physical’ and ‘home’ domains (using the
DUX-25), while they rated poorer QoL on ‘bodily func-
tioning’ and ‘positive moods’ domains than the parent-
rated QoL (using the TACQOL). Varni and Burwinkle
(2006); Limbers et al. (2011b); and Gu¨rkan et al. (2010)
reported no discrepancies between parents and children
across all individual domains.

Parent–child agreement in comparison to normative QoL
data

Nine of the thirteen studies compared data from the ADHD
group with normative data; however, one of these did not
compare total QoL scores, only domain scores (Klassen
et al. 2006). In all of the eight studies which did compare
total QoL scores, both parents and children rated the
overall QoL of the child with ADHD as poorer than the
QoL of a designated healthy control group (Thaulow and
Jozeﬁak 2012; Marques et al. 2013; Limbers et al.
2011a, b; Varni and Burwinkle 2006; Jafari et al. 2011;
Pongwilairat et al. 2005; Flapper and Schoemaker 2008).
There were some exceptions to this on individual domains.
Limbers et al. (2011b) found that children did not rate their
QoL as being signiﬁcantly different from controls on the
‘social’ domain, while parents did not rate their children’s
physical health as being signiﬁcantly poorer. Similarly,
Varni and Burwinkle (2006) reported that parents did not
rate their child as having impaired physical health, while
Pongwilairat et al. (2005) reported that children did not
perceive their physical health as comparatively lacking.
Klassen et al. (2006) found that children self-rated their
QoL similarly to a normative sample across most domains,
while their parents perceived deﬁcits in psychosocial and
family domains.

Direction of differences

Overwhelmingly, the directional trend across the range of
included studies was that children reported better QoL than
their parents’ proxy-ratings of QoL. All eight of the studies
where there was signiﬁcant parent/child discrepancies in
total QoL reported higher scores for self-rated QoL. The
vast majority of discrepancies across individual domains
followed the same directional trend as the overall scores.
Children rated higher self-rated QoL than parent-rated QoL
on nineteen individual domains across eight studies. Par-
ents rated higher QoL than children on only three indi-
vidual domains across two studies. These were ‘positive
moods’ and ‘bodily functioning’ using the TACQOL
(Flapper and Schoemaker 2008) and the ‘physical’ domain
using the CHQ (Klassen et al. 2006).

Co-morbidities

Discussion

Two of the four studies which excluded participants with
co-morbid conditions (ADHD only) found that children
rated their QoL higher than their parents (Bastiaansen
et al. 2004; Schei et al. 2013). Both of these studies uti-
lised comparison groups of children with either ADHD
and other conditions (e.g. emotional/CDs) (Schei et al.
2013) or other conditions without ADHD (Bastiaansen
et al. 2004). Parent/child disagreement was not observed
for either of these conditions as it had been in the ADHD
only conditions. Four of the six studies which did not
exclude co-morbid conditions reported that children rated
their total QoL as being higher than their parents rated
them (Thaulow and Jozeﬁak 2012; Limbers et al. 2011b;
Sciberras et al. 2011; Gu¨rkan et al. 2010). The ﬁfth study
(Klassen et al. 2006) did not report overall QoL scores,
but did report that children with ODD/CD were more
likely to rate their QoL on ‘mental health’ and ‘behaviour’
domains more favourably than their parents. Only one of
the studies where co-morbidities were present found no
signiﬁcant differences between self- and parent-reported
QoL (Limbers et al. 2011b). The study which limited co-
morbidities to ODD reported good concordance between
parents and children for overall QoL ratings (Marques
et al. 2013). Both of the studies which did not provide
information about whether or not co-morbidities were
excluded reported that child ratings of QoL were higher
than parent ratings (Jafari et al. 2011; Pongwilairat et al.
2005).

regarding associated variables such as parent mental and
physical health status, the child’s age and gender would
also have been potentially valuable. However, few of
the papers reported the impact of these variables on
parent/child agreement in their analysis (some citing
small sample sizes), so meaningful comparisons were
not possible. Medication status was also of interest in
this review; however, its purpose was not to assess QoL
of children with ADHD according to medication status
or type. As most children were recruited from paediatric
clinics, the rates of pharmacological intervention were
high, and few studies exclusively compared parent and
child QoL ratings between medicated and non-medi-
cated children.

Reviews comparing child self-report with parent proxy-
reports of the QoL of children with chronic health condi-
tions have found that inter-rater discrepancies are common
and that one cannot simply be substituted for the other
(Eiser and Morse 2001; Upton et al. 2008). The aim of this
review was to examine the existing published data on QoL
in childhood ADHD, as rated by matched parent/child
dyads, in order to determine the degree and nature of any
differences which occurred between them.

Agreement on total quality of life scores

In the majority of studies, there was disagreement between
parents and children on the evaluation of the child’s life
quality. In all of the studies where discrepancies in overall
QoL scores existed, children perceived their QoL as being
more favourable than parents. These ﬁndings indicate that
children with ADHD have a more positive view of their
lives than their parents expect them to. These ﬁndings are
in accordance with previous reviews which found that
children with chronic conditions tend to rate their QoL
more highly than their parents (Eiser and Morse 2001;
Upton et al. 2008). In the majority of cases, both parents
and children agreed that QoL is impaired for children with
ADHD compared with healthy children. This evidence
expands on Danckaerts et al.’s (2010) ﬁnding that QoL is
impaired in children with ADHD according to parental
report. Therefore, rather than informants disagreeing on
whether or not impairment in QoL exists for children with
ADHD, it appears that it is the level and/or the nature of the

on which

are

Several explanations have been offered for the propen-
sity for children with ADHD to self-rate their QoL more
favourably than their parents rate them. A positive illusory
bias, which proposes that children with ADHD have overly
optimistic self-perceptions, has been reported in studies
exploring self-concept in ADHD (Hoza et al. 2002; Owens
and Hoza 2003). It has been hypothesised that children
with this diagnosis cope with negative experiences and
protect their self-image by constructing a more favourable
internal representation of their competences (Ohan and
Johnston 2010). Clearly if this is the case, they do not
extend this representation to equality of experience with
their non-ADHD-affected peers, as evidenced by their
acknowledgement of comparative deﬁcits. Sciberras et al.
(2011) reported that in their sample, self-worth was higher
in children who reported higher QoL scores than their
parents, compared with children who rated their QoL as

123

worse than their parents, which may account for some of
their apparent resilience.

Children’s self-reports may also be biased by their
ADHD symptomatology. Children with this diagnosis are
typically impulsive and have attentional difﬁculties, which
may cause them to record responses in haste with little
deliberation. In this sense, ADHD may limit their capacity
to reﬂect on the ‘bigger picture’ of their life experiences,
instead answering questions based on their immediate
feelings. Thaulow and Jozeﬁak (2012) theorise that chil-
dren with ADHD are more likely to focus on aspects of the
present moment, while their parents are likely to focus on
the child’s future, concerned by problems related to school
and peer relationships. However, in this case, one might in
fact expect a reversed trend to the one observed. That is,
immediate events may make it more likely that children
will rate their QoL less positively than their parents.

Parental perceptions are also open to bias. Some
researchers have noticed a higher presence of psy-
chopathology in parents of children with ADHD (Barkley
et al. 1990; Biederman 1992). Parents of children with
ADHD also experience more parenting stress than parents
of healthy controls, similar to parents of other clinically
referred children (Theule et al. 2010). Children with
ADHD may have overly optimistic views. However, the
views of their highly stressed parents may be inﬂuenced by
negative thinking patterns that often underlie highly
prevalent psychological problems. This hypothesis would
ﬁt with studies that have reported a link between parental
emotional distress and more negative perceptions of their
child’s QoL for other conditions (Janicke et al. 2007;
Kobayashi and Kamibeppu 2011). Klassen et al. (2006)
reported that when a psychosocial stressor was present,
children rated their behaviour higher and their physical
function lower compared with their parents’ ratings. It is
likely that both stressful life events and parental mental
health issues could inhibit communication between parents
and children and thus affect the degree to which they are
attuned. Further, parents who are already emotionally
burdened may experience more distress related to their
child’s ADHD behaviours and therefore perceive them as
more severe and disruptive than the child experiences them
to be.

Agreement on speciﬁc domains

Just over one-third of the studies which reported domain
scores found greater parent–child agreement on physical
health domains as opposed to psychosocial domains (e.g.
social, emotional and school experience). However, this
trend should be interpreted cautiously as there were also
studies where discrepancies were present across all
domains or no domains. Authors of related reviews have

123

suggested that the level of agreement on speciﬁc domains
may depend on their clinical relevance to a particular
disease group (Upton et al. 2008; Varni et al. 2003). They
suggest that agreement is likely to be stronger on relevant
domains because parents would be more involved in this
aspect of the child’s health care. If this were the case, one
might predict that in the case of ADHD, there would be
greater agreement between parent and child ratings of child
QoL for psychosocial rather than physical domains, since
physical health is relatively unchanged by ADHD symp-
tomatology. However, this review has found no evidence to
support this theory in the context of ADHD. It may be that
psychosocial domains which incorporate emotional, social
and school experiences are more subjective and therefore
open to parental interpretation, while physical health is
easier for parents to objectively assess.

Agreement and co-morbidities

It is difﬁcult to make inferences regarding the impact of co-
morbidities on parent–child agreement as few studies
reported direct comparisons between ADHD only groups
and co-morbid groups. Half of the studies which used
ADHD only samples reported signiﬁcant discrepancies
between scores, while agreement across samples where co-
morbidities had not been excluded was also variable, and
samples were not homogenous in this regard. However,
two potentially important ﬁndings with regard to co-mor-
bidities were highlighted in the review. Klassen et al.
(2006) found that children with co-morbid ODD/CD rate
their mental health and behaviour more highly than their
parents. It would thus be easy to imagine that the additional
stress of co-morbidities further reduces communication and
therefore agreement between parent and child. However,
Thaulow and Jozeﬁak (2012) found that children with
ADHD without co-morbidities self-rated their QoL higher
than children with anxiety or depression, while there was
no difference between these groups according to parent-
reported ratings. This latter ﬁnding gives additional support
to the theory that children with ADHD, unencumbered by
co-morbid psychiatric problems, have a more positive
outlook on their lives than their parents expect. In contrast,
children with emotional problems such as anxiety or
depression are more likely to view their lives more nega-
tively and more in line with their parents’ expectations.

The two ﬁndings appear at ﬁrst to sound contradictory,
as surely if optimism is highest when ADHD is ‘pure’,
parent–child agreement would be predicted to improve as
co-morbidity increases. Yet the symptoms of ODD and CD
are also externalising, and rather than affecting the coping
style of the young person (as an internalising emotional
disorder might), they may simply be adding to the stress of
the parent and/or serving to reinforce the positive illusory

coping mechanism within the child, creating further dis-
crepancy. Perhaps then, the nature of ADHD symptoma-
tology, e.g. externalising symptoms (hyperactivity) versus
internalising symptoms (negative cognitions) could, rela-
tive to other mental health problems, be a protective factor
for a child’s perception of their QoL. Reservedly, this
hypothesis is based on the ﬁndings of only two studies.
More research is needed to examine the impact of co-
morbidities on parent–child agreement levels. In particular,
studies that utilise comparative data across different con-
ditions and that consider their impact on both parents and
children, are of interest.

Agreement across QoL measures

Over two-thirds of the included studies used the Peds-QL
as the QoL measure. A potential explanatory factor for
some of the preference for this measure is that the author of
the Peds-QL is also an author on three of the included
studies. A clear beneﬁt of having such a high proportion of
studies utilise the same measure, was that
it allowed
comparisons to be made both within and between QoL
measures. Upton et al. (2008) suggested that the Peds-QL
has a relatively high number of items which measure
observable behaviours and that this may result in greater
agreement between parents and children on this measure.
The ﬁndings of this review contradict this premise, evi-
denced in the fact that two-thirds of the Peds-QL studies
reported signiﬁcant disagreement in overall QoL ratings of
parents and children. Both of the ILC studies and the CHQ
study reported poor concordance between raters, and the
TACQOL and DUX-25 reported discrepancies on a num-
ber of domains. Therefore, it appears that the trend of
discrepancies observed across studies cannot readily be
attributed to the QoL measure speciﬁed.

Of interest, in Danckaerts et al.’s (2010) review, in the
two studies which utilised the CHQ, children did not rate
their QoL differently from controls, while the four others
(which used other QoL measures) reported reduced QoL.
In the current review, a similar pattern was observed. Only
one study utilised the CHQ, and it was the only one (of
those who reported comparisons with normative data)
which did not observe reduced QoL in children with
ADHD. The eight studies which reported impaired QoL
utilised other QoL measures (Peds-QL, ILC, TACQOL and
DUX-25). However, the CHQ study utilised population
norms from a different country, meaning issues such as
dissimilar healthcare systems and socio-economic status
could result in key differences between the QoL of the
children in the samples. However, it should also be made
explicit that the (Klassen et al. 2006) study was reviewed
as part of both Danckaerts et al.’s (2010) review and the
therefore, more comparisons featuring
current

123

studies which utilise CHQ self-report measures are neces-
sary before conclusions can be drawn.

Strengths and limitations of the review

a

second rater

The search strategy utilised was comprehensive, and
studies were screened and included from a variety of
sources. Additionally,
independently
appraised the conformity of a proportion of the included
studies, and inter-rater reliability checks were performed,
limiting appraisal bias. However, the authors acknowledge
that only one individual was responsible for selecting
studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and that
ideally this would be cross-checked. All of the included
studies utilised standardised QoL instruments with estab-
lished psychometric properties, thus reﬁning the validity
and reliability of the available data.

A limitation of all survey-based research is responder
bias and the lack of available comparison data regarding
why some and not others partake in the research. Incon-
sistencies between parent and child ratings may reﬂect
sample differences. Samples had variable inclusion and
exclusion criteria, age and gender distributions, and
response rates. The reviewed research studies include
samples which are internationally diverse, and participants
are often treated within dissimilar healthcare systems.
Diagnostic inconsistencies including the use of ICD-10 or
DSM-IV criteria, the level of clinician experience and the
use of research-speciﬁc criteria in some cases, will inevi-
tably have led to some incongruence between samples. The
authors acknowledge that it would have been useful to
include a section in the quality criteria relating to how
ADHD diagnosis was assigned in each sample. Further,
diagnostic criteria have changed over time, and the search
terms may have missed studies that utilised previous ter-
minology for ADHD.

Participants were generally recruited by convenience
sampling methods with little randomisation. In addition,
some samples will have a referral bias for more complex/
co-morbid cases depending on the recruitment method, the
stage of their treatment and when they received a diagno-
sis. Some children completed questionnaires unaided or
online, while researchers provided assistance to others or
utilised an interview format. The method was usually based
on the age of the child. Given the attentional problems
associated with this population, the method of completion
may have impacted on the child’s QoL ratings, with chil-
dren potentially being inhibited by the presence of a
researcher or by improving their attention. However, the
directional impact and magnitude of each of these sce-
narios on the child’s QoL ratings are unknown. Notably,
due the high proportions of boys within the samples,
ﬁndings may not be generalisable to girls with ADHD. In

addition, due to lack of information and comparison, the
authors are unable to comment on the differences between
child and adolescent data in comparison with parental
reports. This would be of interest given that parents are
likely to have less awareness of the QoL of adolescents
than children.

Implications for clinical practice

In addition to their application in research, QoL measures
can be of value to clinicians working with families with a
child with ADHD. They might highlight speciﬁc areas
where a child is having difﬁculty and thus where appro-
priate support can be sought out and targeted. Although
ADHD symptoms are often reduced by medication and
other psychosocial treatment interventions, it is equally
important to investigate and consider areas of a child’s life
where there may be associated distress that might be
reduced. Further, given the apparent discrepancies between
parent and child perceptions of the QoL of children with
ADHD found in published research, it may be helpful for
clinicians to explore these differences on an individual
level. Such investigations may illicit a clearer under-
standing of the impact of ADHD on the perceptions of the
individual members of the family. If the child indicates that
they experience life more positively than parents predict,
this may in itself alleviate some distress in parents. It may
also allow clinicians and parents to challenge or modify
their own expectations in the light of the child’s own
views.

their child’s

Parents will vary in terms of their sensitivity and
understanding of
subjective well-being.
However, substantial discrepancies across a range of
domains could signpost relational issues between a parent
and child that could be further examined and potentially
addressed. We recommend that dual informants are always
utilised when possible and that measures are interpreted
with caution, given the potential sources of reporting bias
on both parts. Further, given that the child’s accessing of
services is usually predicted by parental concerns regarding
the child’s QoL, it may be helpful for clinicians to reﬂect
that there is perhaps no ‘true’ depiction of the child’s QoL,
rather than both views should be valued and validated as
integral contributions to clinical assessment and treatment
planning.

Implications for future research

Studies and reviews comparing parent/child agreement
across different health conditions have mostly considered
children with physical health conditions. Further studies
which directly compare agreement between parents and
children on QoL measures across samples of children with

a range of psychiatric diagnoses may aid understanding of
the potential impact of each set of symptoms. For example,
if levels of agreement between parents and children vary
between samples of children with depression (internalising
symptoms), conduct disorders (externalising symptoms)
and OCD (internalising and externalising symptoms), we
could learn a great deal about how children’s perceptions
(relative to their parents) are impacted by their condition
and perhaps learn more about how each condition affects
the parent/child relationship. Further attention should be
given to the potential sources of bias for both informants.
Large quantitative studies investigating the speciﬁc impact
of parental stress on parent and child ratings of child QoL
would be of interest.

Previous

research found little differences between
mothers and fathers’ ratings of QoL in population samples
(Jozeﬁak et al. 2008). However, this trend may be different
when a child has a health condition given that one parent
may be more involved with the child’s health care.
Therefore, studies which compare proxy-raters in terms of
their relationship with the child may be of interest, along
with studies which explore agreement associated with child
gender and age. Given the highly co-morbid nature of
ADHD, more studies directly comparing agreement
between ADHD only samples and samples according to
type and number of co-morbidities may also be of value.
Since symptom severity is generally rated by parents in
research (Danckaerts et al. 2010), such ratings may be open
to the same potential sources of bias QoL ratings and may
result in erroneous correlations between ADHD symptoms
and QoL. Teacher- or clinician-based ratings would be
preferable if investigating the impact of symptom severity
on agreement levels. Finally, qualitative studies consider-
ing the basis on which both sets of informants assess the
child’s QoL would be highly advantageous in helping to
establish the cognitive processes behind parent and child
perceptions.

Conclusions

describing

proxy-reports when

Previous related reviews have focussed on agreement
across multiple diagnoses (where only one ADHD study
was included) (Eiser and Morse 2001) or have utilised
mainly
child QoL
(Danckaerts et al. 2010). Thus, it had formerly been dif-
ﬁcult to establish a clear picture of children’s views of
their QoL, both in relation to their non-ADHD affected
peers and to their parents. This review adds to the current
evidence base by bringing together the existing published
research speciﬁc to the QoL of children with a diagnosis
of ADHD and by representing and comparing the views
of both parents and children. In summary, this review

123

26

H. Galloway, E. Newman

found that there is consistent uni-directional evidence that
children with ADHD perceive their QoL more favourably
than their parents do, but less favourably than healthy
controls. Thus, parent and child ratings of QoL should not
be considered interchangeable when assessing the QoL of
children with ADHD. Rather both should be considered as
unique and valuable perspectives for clinical and research
purposes.
