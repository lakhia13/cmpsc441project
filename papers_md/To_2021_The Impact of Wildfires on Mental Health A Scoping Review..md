Abstract: One of the many consequences of climate change is an increase in the frequency, severity,
and, thus, impact of wildﬁres across the globe. The destruction and loss of one’s home, belongings,
and surrounding community, and the threat to personal safety and the safety of loved ones can have
signiﬁcant consequences on survivors’ mental health, which persist for years after. The objective of
this scoping review was to identify primary studies examining the impact of wildﬁres on mental
health and to summarize ﬁndings for PTSD, depression, anxiety, and substance use. Literature
searches on Pubmed and Embase were conducted in February and April of 2021, respectively, with
no date restrictions. A total of 254 studies were found in the two database searches, with 60 studies
meeting the inclusion criteria. Three other studies were identiﬁed and included based on relevant
in-text citations during data abstraction. The results show an increased rate of PTSD, depression,
and generalized anxiety at several times of follow-up post-wildﬁre, from the subacute phase, to
years after. An increased rate of mental health disorders post-wildﬁre has been found in both the
adult and pediatric population, with a number of associated risk factors, the most signiﬁcant being
characteristics of the wildﬁre trauma itself. Several new terms have arisen in the literature secondary
to an increased awareness and understanding of the impact of natural disasters on mental health,
including ecological grief, solastalgia, and eco-anxiety. There are a number of patient factors and
systemic changes that have been identiﬁed post-wildﬁre that can contribute to resilience and recovery.

Warmer temperatures, longer summers, and blistering heat waves are all consequences
of climate change and contributing factors to an increasing awareness and incidence of
wildﬁres [1]. The three key ingredients necessary to start a ﬁre are heat, oxygen, and fuel [2].
Consequences of climate change include warmer temperatures and changes in wind speed
and rainfall patterns, the very factors necessary for wildﬁre ignition and propagation [3].
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that wildﬁres and volcanic activities
impacted 6.2 million people globally from 1998 to 2017 [4]. Current statistics reveal an
ongoing signiﬁcant impact of wildﬁres across the globe. For example, in 2020, the United
States reported that by October 2020 8 million acres of land had been burned by wildﬁres [5].
On average, Canada has spent 800 million dollars annually on wildﬁre related costs in
recent years [6]. Similarly, Australia has reported an increase of 30.6 days in the annual
number of average days with high-extreme ﬁre danger from 2016 to 2019 [7]. Additionally,
contributing to the greater human experience of and impact from wildﬁres are changes in
human migration and expansion. The pattern of human expansion into areas previously
dominated by wildlife and nature means more people now live close to, or in, wooded
areas, which serve as the fuel and setting for wildﬁres [8]. Researchers calculate that global
wildﬁres can produce between 1.75 and 13.5 billion metric tons of carbon annually which
circulate in our atmosphere for months [9]. Thus, wildﬁres themselves contribute to the
greenhouse effect, propagating further development of wildﬁres.

Wildﬁres exert various impacts and risks to public health including an acute risk of
mortality and injury, and by wreaking havoc on the community and the ensuing response
team. Wildﬁres destroy homes and workplaces, displace victims, and impact numerous
medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and
mental health [10–12]. Studies have found higher rates post-wildﬁre of hypertension,
gastrointestinal disorders, diabetes, and COPD and asthma exacerbation, along with vari-
ous psychiatric conditions, including mood and anxiety disorders [11–15]. The impact of
wildﬁres on the survivors’ mental health has been found in both the adult and pediatric
population, with children and adolescents also experiencing higher rates of mood and anxi-
ety disorders post-wildﬁre [16,17]. Researchers studying the impact of wildﬁres on children
and adolescents have utilized survey and scale measures administered to study partici-
pants in this demographic, as well as their parents and/or teachers, to gain an appreciation
of mental health outcomes within a study population that may struggle with personally
communicating mood symptoms secondary to their developmental level [16,18,19]. Be-
havioral changes post-wildﬁre in children can include increased irritability and changes
in concentration, sleep, and academic performance [18,20]. The impact of wildﬁres on
mental health cannot be ignored and should not be, as the World Health Organization
(WHO) identiﬁed neuropsychiatric disorders as the leading cause of disability-adjusted
life years in the U.S. in 2010 with mental and behavioural disorders contributing to 13.6%
of the total [21]. The repercussions from wildﬁres can be widespread due to the ability of
wildﬁre-created smoke to dissipate and persist, with the majority of follow-up studies being
conducted within 1 to 2 years post-wildﬁre. However, there is evidence of ongoing mental
health effects in more longitudinal studies made 10–20 years post-wildﬁre [22,23]. There
are novel terms to describe emotional and mental health responses to natural disasters such
as solastalgia, eco-anxiety, and ecological grief, which will likely become more prominent
as such tragedies continue to occur [24–26].

This paper is a scoping review of the existing literature, investigating the research
question of how wildﬁres impact mental health; speciﬁcally, post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), major depressive disorder/depression (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),
and substance use at various times of follow-up. Our objective was to summarize the
existing information on the impact of wildﬁres on mental health, and contribute to the
understanding of factors that contribute to and protect against psychopathology post-
wildﬁre. This information may be utilized to determine evidence-based public health
responses to mitigate adverse outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst scoping review
to speciﬁcally examine the mental health effects of wildﬁres.

Through our review, we hope to summarize speciﬁcally and comprehensively how
wildﬁres impact mental health and discuss how this information may be utilized for future
research, wildﬁre disaster response, and ultimately improving population health.

2. Materials and Methods

A literature search on 16 February 2021, was ﬁrst conducted in Pubmed, with no date
restrictions or language ﬁlters. Search terms included “post traumatic stress disorder”)
OR PTSD OR psychosis OR schizophreni* OR depressi* OR anxiety OR “mental illness*”
OR “psychiatric disorder*” OR “psychiatric illness*” OR “mental disorder*” OR “mental
health” AND wildﬁre* or forestﬁre* or bushﬁre* OR wild n6 ﬁre* OR bush n6 ﬁre* OR
forest n6 ﬁre* OR vegetation n6 ﬁre* OR landscape n6 ﬁre*.

Then a literature search on 7 April 2021, was conducted on Embase/OVID in their 1974
to present database, with no language ﬁlters. Search terms included exp mental disease/,
exp wildﬁre/, (post traumatic stress disorder or PTSD or psychosis or schizophreni* or de-
pressi* or anxiety or mental illness* or psychiatric disorder* or psychiatric illness* or mental

2.1. Inclusion Criteria

This review contains primary articles and includes randomized controlled trials and
observational studies, such as case-control or cross-sectional studies, which reported on
PTSD, anxiety, depression, substance use, or resiliency measures as outcomes of interest
following wildﬁre exposure. Participants in the studies came from a wide breadth of age
categories, from primary school children to elderly adults in their 90(cid:48)s.

4.

Reviews and subjective reports without any new objective primary data were ex-
cluded from this review.
Studies focusing primarily on ﬁreﬁghters, emergency responders, or burn victims
were excluded.
Studies were excluded if the exposure was non-wildﬁre based or the primary outcome
was not related to mental health.
Studies with a primary outcome of schizophrenia and psychosis were excluded due
to the limited number of total studies available.

2.3. Data Extraction

The primary author reviewed the articles to determine which studies met the inclusion

criteria and then performed the data extraction based on outcome measures of interest.

3. Results

Our review appraised and synthesized evidence from the literature about the impact
of wildﬁres on mental health, speciﬁcally with respect to PTSD, depression, anxiety, and
substance use. We present the ﬁndings of our search strategy and then ﬁndings on our
primary aim under the various clinical outcomes.

Outcome of Literature Search

Figure 1 is a flowchart summarizing our search process and outcomes. This review found
60 articles that met the inclusion criteria [13,14,16,17,19,20,22,23,26–77]. Three other articles were
obtained from review of relevant in-text citations during data abstraction [18,78,79].

Table 1 details study characteristics. The earliest study was published in 1985 by
Clayer et al. [13]. The vast majority (n = 57, 90%) were published from the year 2000 and
onward. The results of the included studies are summarized in Table 2.

Cohort Study

Outcome measures included self
report of environmental
attachment, the K6, the PCL, the
PHQ-9, the CD-RISC, and the
short-form for post-traumatic
growth inventory.

Outcome measures included the
CPSS, PQH-A, the HADS, the
CRAFFT, Tobacco Use
Questionnaire, the RSE, the
Kidscreen Questionnaire, and the
Child and Youth Resilience
Measure.

Outcome measures included the
PHQ-A, the HADS, the CRAFFT
Questionnaire, the Tobacco Use
Questionnaire, the RSE, the
Kidscreen Questionnaire, and the
CPSS.

Outcome measures included the
PCL-5, PHQ-9, K6, and the
AUDIT-C.

Those with a weak attachment to the environment
had higher scores of psychological distress,
ﬁre-related PTSD, and MDD symptoms, and
lower levels of resiliency.

A total of 37% of the students met criteria for
probable PTSD, 31% for probable depression, and
27% for probable anxiety. Students classiﬁed as
high resilience had lower scores on all the mental
health disorder screens and higher self-esteem
and quality of life scores.

In the wildﬁre exposure group, adolescents had
higher depression and anxiety scores and rates of
probable depression. While, 37% of the students
met criteria for probable PTSD.

In the high-impact group, the rate of probable
PTSD was 16.8% and MDE was 9.8%. The
likelihood of developing any disorder was higher
in the heavy drinking category than those who
did not meet criteria, 29.2% versus 17.3%.

Outcome measures included the
abbreviated version of PCL-5,
PHQ-9, K6 scale, and an
abbreviated AUDIT.

Among the high impact group, 15.6% had
probable wildﬁre related PTSD, 12.9% had
probable MDD, and 24.7% had rates of heavy
drinking.

Outcome measures included
parental presence during the
wildﬁre, Experiences in Close
Relationships scale, and the
PCL-5.

Children exposed to bushﬁres and children
separated from their parents during that time had
higher scores on the avoidant attachment scale as
adults. An avoidant attachment style was
positively associated with PTSD symptoms.

Outcome measures included
social support questions, the
PCL-5, and the PHQ-9.

Analyses found that identifying social support
was associated with less depression, and being
nominated by others as a support was associated
with less PTSD.

Outcome measures included the
abbreviated PCL-5, PHQ-9, the
K6, and the AUDIT-C.

In the high-impact group, the rate of probable
ﬁre-related PTSD was 10.9%, general PTSD was
18.7%, MDE was 10.9%, and heavy alcohol use
was 23.2%.

Cross-Sectional Study

Outcomes included IES, Vicarious
Traumatization Questionnaire,
and Coping Strategies Indicator.

Demographic factors were not found to be
signiﬁcant risk factors for vicarious
traumatization.

Outcome of interest was the drug
dispensing rates for
anxiolytics/hypnotics and drugs
for obstructive airway disease 12
months before and after the
wildﬁres.

Outcome measures included K10
and a survey on perceived
wellbeing

Outcome measures included a
scale to assess ﬁre-related stress,
the PTGI-SF, the MHI-5, the PFS,
and the CERQ-Short Form.

Male non-pensioners saw a relative increase of
12.2% and male pensioners of 15.88% in the
deﬁned daily doses for anxiolytics and hypnotics.

A total of 39% reported their lives were more
difﬁcult after the bushﬁre. While, 19.5% were
found to have high to very high rates of
psychological distress.

It was reported that 16.7% of those evacuated had
scores indicative of moderate to severe anxiety or
depression

Rates of alcoholism and drug problems
approximately tripled pre-bushﬁre to post. Mental
illness increased from 0.79% pre-bushﬁre to 3.01%
post-bushﬁre.

Among those with anger problems, 58.6% had
probable PTSD, 43.2% had probable depression,
and 34.5% had K6 scores indicative of severe
mental illness.

Use of positive reappraisal coping techniques was
associated with greater post-traumatic growth in
youth and approached signiﬁcance in parents.

Cross-Sectional Study

Outcome measures included
personal views on what is
considered to be a dangerous PSI
value, physical symptoms, and
the IES-R.

Outcome measures included the
IES-R, the Brief COPE Inventory,
and the PTGI.

Outcome measures were obtained
from the DICA-R. Self-report
measures included the IES, the
STAI-C, and the FQ-C. Parents
received the PTSD component of
the DIS and the IES.

Respondents who perceived lower PSI values as
dangerous were more likely to be experiencing
more physical symptoms or have higher IES-R
scores.

Greater post-traumatic symptoms and
post-traumatic growth were associated with the
utilization of avoidant, problem-focused, and
emotion-focused coping strategies.

There was an average of 5 PTSD symptoms
reported by children in the high loss (HL) group,

To assess the relationship between
an external locus of control and
levels of psychopathology.

Comparative Cross-Sectional
Study

Outcome measures were the
Brown Locus of Control scale and
the SCL-90-R.

A reported 12% of students were experiencing
moderate-severe emotional distress symptoms,
4.7% had symptoms of depressive illness, and
14.1% had symptoms of high-trait anxiety.

A reported 12.1% had moderate PTSD, and 9.0%
had severe–very severe PTSD. There were
signiﬁcantly higher scores in the primary grades
(4–6), then junior or senior grades (7–12).

Multivariate analyses suggested that the IES score,
the RMA score, grade at school, and experiencing
evacuation signiﬁcantly predicted the BDS index.
BDS scores were lowest in middle grades.
Adjusted emotional distress scores were lowest in
the lower and high grades.

From teacher questionnaires, the caseness rate at 2,
8, and 26 months was 1.8%, 6.5%, and 12%,
respectively. There were variable results in
comparison to the control group.

A total of 36.7% of the bush-ﬁre exposed
participants and 31.7% of the controls met criteria
for DSM-IV disorder in their lifetime. When DSM
diagnoses were analyzed, the only one more
signiﬁcantly prevalent in the exposed group was
lifetime history of speciﬁc phobia.

From the ﬁrst follow-up, the mean GHQ score was
5.6, and 42% met criteria as possible psychiatric
cases.
At the second point of follow-up, 23% of the
surveyed victims met criteria for psychiatric
caseness.

The post-traumatic phenomena did not decrease
in children from 8 to 26 months post-bushﬁre.
There was signiﬁcant correlation between the 2
month teacher symptom score and the 26 month
scores.
There was no 1:1 relationship between
post-traumatic phenomena and psychological
disorder.

Participants who resided in the wildﬁre impacted
area had a higher external locus of control views
and higher global levels of psychopathology (GSI).
There was a statistically signiﬁcant correlation
between levels of external locus of control and
psychopathology in those with greater trauma.

Cross-Sectional Study

Outcome measures included the
PTSD-RI-R and bushﬁre

The one month prevalence rate for likely MDD,
GAD, and PTSD was 23.4%, 18.7%, and 11.0%,
respectively. It was found that 15.5%, 13.5%, and
4.4% of participants screened positive for high risk
drinking, problematic drug use, and moderate to
high nicotine dependence.

At the ﬁrst point of follow-up, analyses found that
female gender and negative ﬁre-related cognitions
were associated with increased anxiety symptoms.
Increased negative ﬁre-relation cognitions were
associated with increased depression symptoms.

PCL-5 scores were signiﬁcantly higher for those
directly exposed. PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were
higher in those directly or indirectly exposed vs.
not exposed.

A reported 18.1% of evacuees sought additional
mental health services, compared to 8% of
individuals who did not evacuate the area despite
living in an evacuation zone, and 2.1% of those
who lived in non-evacuation areas. Analyses
revealed that the act of evacuation was signiﬁcant
for all 8 ﬁre impact questions.

A total of 26% qualiﬁed for probable PTSD. Both
peritraumatic distress and dissociative experience
scores were positively associated with
post-traumatic symptoms. Analyses found only
social support satisfaction had a moderating effect
on the relationship between peritraumatic distress
(when it was not signiﬁcantly high) and
post-traumatic symptom scores.

Average PTSD symptom score was 18.41; 17% had
symptoms in the moderate range and 10% in the
severe–very severe range. In analysis, relevant
risk factors were perceived threat to life, ongoing
loss or disruption in life, and younger age.

4. Discussion

This scoping review is speciﬁc to the impact of wildﬁres on mental health in both
the adult and pediatric population. There are a number of narrative reports and letters
discussing the impact of wildﬁre by experts in the ﬁeld [5,80]. Our literature search
identiﬁed one review speciﬁc to the impact of wildﬁre smoke exposure, which included
a number of health outcomes including mental health [81]. In addition, there are several
reviews that discussed the impact of wildﬁres on mental health within the broader context
of natural disasters or climate change [12,25,82].

4.1. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

A post-natural disaster acute stress reaction is common and expected, but the rate at
which an individual’s acute stress reaction may persist and develop into psychopathology
is a common research objective [12]. Researchers have attempted to quantify the rates and
severity of PTSD at various times post-wildﬁre in children, adolescents, and adults. This
review suggests there are statistically and clinically signiﬁcant increases in rates of PTSD in
communities ravaged by wildﬁres. Among adults, higher rates of PTSD and associated
symptoms were present shortly after a wildﬁre and up to 10 years post-wildﬁre [22,36].
In the adult population, the rate of probable PTSD based on a survey screening 3 months
post-wildﬁre was found to be 24% and 60% in two separate studies [36,57]. At 6 months
after a wildﬁre, the one month prevalence rate of PTSD in adults was 12.8%–26% [34,75].
At 18 months after the Fort McMurray wildﬁre, rates of likely PTSD continued to be higher
than prior to the trauma, with studies ﬁnding similar rates, within 10.2%–13.6% [32,64,71].
Bryant et al. provided unique longitudinal information about the impact and prevalence
of psychopathology post-wildﬁre [22,26,42]. From 3 to 10 years post-wildﬁre, the rate of
ﬁre-related PTSD in the high-impact group decreased from 15.6% to 7.6% [22,26,42].

Studies have looked at other outcomes or symptoms associated with PTSD post-
wildﬁre including sleep disturbance and insomnia, anger, attachment style, interpersonal
violence, and a term known as vicarious traumatization which is the development of PTSD
symptoms from indirect trauma exposure [43,46,48,50,51,62,70,73].

A unique and recurring wildﬁre experience in South Asian countries is the seasonal
haze created by bushﬁres from the intentional slash-and-burn technique used for clearing
land for agricultural purposes [55]. Respondents who perceived lower Pollutants Standard
Index values as dangerous were associated with higher IES-R scores [55]. In comparison, a
study in British Columbia, Canada, on the impact of increased particulate matter (PM) and
worsening air quality related to wildﬁres did not ﬁnd an association with an increase in
mental health related physician visits [63].

Rates of psychopathology post-wildﬁre exposure have also been studied in the pe-
diatric population. In the sub-acute phase post-wildﬁre, the number of children with
signiﬁcant PTSD symptoms can be as high as 92% [16]. Studies that have assessed the rate
of likely PTSD 6 months post-ﬁre have found similar results with 9–12% of children and
adolescents experiencing moderate to severe PTSD and as high as 29.4% in a study involv-
ing adolescents in Greece [19,58,65]. A year post-wildﬁre, the rate of PTSD in children and
adolescents has been found to be between 27 and 37% [17,76]. The impact of a childhood
exposure to a bushﬁre on one’s mental health as an adult was evaluated with a 20 year
follow-up study conducted by Mcfarlane and Van Hooff [23]. They found no difference in
the rate of lifetime or recent 1-month prevalence of PTSD in the wildﬁre exposed group
versus controls [23].

Our literature search did not reveal a review speciﬁc to risk factors for developing
PTSD post-bushﬁre, but such factors have been investigated by several primary studies. In
adults, demographic factors such as female gender, widowed status, or fewer years of edu-
cation, lower socioeconomic status, and non-caucasian ethnicity are associated risk factors,
although gender was not always been found to be signiﬁcant [26,32,69,73,78]. Trauma-
related factors signiﬁcant to increasing one’s risk of post-wildﬁre PTSD include personal
witnessing of burning homes, having fear for one’s life or lives of loved ones, losing a loved

Behav. Sci. 2021, 11, 126

10 of 18

one, signiﬁcant property damage, or feeling a lack of support from family, friends, and/or
the government [22,26,32,34,42,57,62,69]. The trauma related factors, including perceived
threat to one’s life and subsequent reaction to the trauma, were found to be more contribu-
tory to the degree of PTSD symptoms than demographic or pre-trauma factors [69]. Finally,
a contributing factor to the risk of developing PTSD post-bushﬁre is ongoing trauma and
life stressors [22,23,26,42]. The risk factors for PTSD in children and adolescents were
overall quite similar to adults, including demographic factors like female gender, younger
age, and middle grades 7–9 [19,58,59,65,76]. For children, a greater predictor of increased
emotional distress post-wildﬁre was the fear for their parents’ lives, even more than fear
for their own life [19]. Combined with the identiﬁed risk factor in adults of a perceived
lack of support from loved ones or the government, there is signiﬁcant evidence to support
the critical role a government and public health response has in mitigating mental health
consequences after experiencing a bushﬁre [71]. A tangible government response may
serve as validation that a traumatic experience has occurred, whilst providing avenues
for recovery and moving forward. The impact and contribution ongoing adverse life
events have on the risk of developing psychopathology post-wildﬁre is indicative of how
cumulative stressors may deteriorate human resilience. As such, government aid should
not be time sensitive post-wildﬁre, but rather be sustained in order to mitigate ongoing life
stressors that can occur after a community is disrupted.

4.2. Depression

Second to PTSD, major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psy-
chiatric illnesses studied and screened-for post-natural disasters [83]. Similar to rates of
PTSD, there has also been shown to be higher rates of depression and associated symptoms
post-wildﬁre in adults, which can persist up to 10 years [22,57]. In the adult population,
studies have found rates of depression approximately 3 months post-bushﬁre, between
25.5 and 33% [36,57]. At 6 months post-wildﬁre, the estimated rates of MDD are between
10.4% and 17.1%, and between 18.3 and 24.8% at 18 months post-wildﬁre [32,33,64,71].
Finally, Bryant et al. studied a range of psychological outcomes over 10 years following
the devastation of the Victorian Black Saturday bushﬁre including depression [22,26,42].
The rate of depression in the high-impact group was consistently around 10% at the three
periods of follow-up [22,26,42].

Rates of depression post-wildﬁre have also been studied in children and adolescent
populations. Mcdermott et al. were some of the ﬁrst researchers to look at depression in
children 6 months post-ﬁre and found a rate of 4.7% [19]. However, a more recent study
found a higher rate of depression 6 months post-wildﬁre at 20% [65]. Even at 18 months
post-wildﬁre, one third of grade 7–12 students were found to meet criteria for depression
compared to 17% in an age-matched control group [17,39].

The emotional response of solastalgia, which describes the mourning of changes
in one’s natural environment, has been linked to levels of psychological distress post-
wildﬁre [84]. Approximately one year after a wildﬁre, 35% of the participants had scores
indicative of moderate-high risk for depression or anxiety on the Kessler Psychological
Distress scale, and increased solastalgia was associated with greater odds of psychological
distress [84].

There were fewer studies in the literature search investigating risk factors for depres-
sion post-bushﬁre in comparison to PTSD. However, some patient factors that have been
identiﬁed in adults include female gender, age greater than 40 years old, a greater number
of adverse experiences in childhood, a prior history of depressive disorder or anxiety disor-
der, and prior treatment with an antidepressant [14,33,64,71,73]. Other researchers did not
ﬁnd an association between demographic factors or gender and depression [57,78]. Trauma
factors that increase risk of depression post-ﬁre in adults are similar to PTSD: witnessing or
experiencing property loss and fear for safety of loved ones [22,26,32,57,64]. Identiﬁed post-
trauma risk factors include perceived lack of support from family, friends, or the govern-
ment, ongoing life stressors, and having received counselling post-ﬁre [22,26,32,33,42,64].

Behav. Sci. 2021, 11, 126

11 of 18

Similar risk factors for depression post-wildﬁre have also been identiﬁed in the pedi-
atric population; although female gender has not been a consistent statistically signiﬁcant
risk factor, the trend is for higher symptom scores [58,59,65]. Finally, studies have com-
mented on the association between PTSD and depression in children and adults, with a
co-occurrence rate of 0.74 in adults [19,57].

Future research may utilize screening measures that combine speciﬁc depression
related questions with associated behavioral changes that impact children’s functioning at
home and school. Involving not only children and adolescent participants, but their parents,
caregivers, and teachers in assessments would likely result in a more comprehensive
screening for psychopathology post-wildﬁre.

4.3. Anxiety

There have been a number of studies investigating rates of anxiety disorders post-
wildﬁre, although the quantity of evidence is smaller than that for PTSD and depression.
Studies performed post-wildﬁre have shown higher rates of anxiety in both adult and
the pediatric populations [17,19,31,36]. In adults surveyed 3 months post-wildﬁre, 27.0%
met criteria for an anxiety disorder other than panic disorder and 17.4% had symptoms
signiﬁcant for panic disorder [36]. The one-month prevalence rate for generalized anxiety
disorder symptoms 6 months post-wildﬁre was 19.8% [31]. At 18 months post-wildﬁre,
the authors found similar rates of generalized anxiety disorder, between 15.7 and 18.7%,
with self-reported pre-wildﬁre rates of anxiety estimated at 8.6–14.5% [32,64,71]. Finally,
Bryant et al. followed a population of adults for up to 10 years after the Victorian Black
Saturday bushﬁre, and over that time the rate of severe distress, as measured on the Kessler
Psychological Distress Scale, decreased from 7.5% to 4.4% [22,26,42].

Anxiety in children and adolescents’ post-wildﬁre has also been studied, although to a
lesser extent than adults. At 6 months post-wildﬁre, 14.1% of children had symptoms signif-
icant for high anxiety [19]. Looking later on, at 18 months after the Fort McMurray wildﬁre,
27% of grade 7–12 students had suspected anxiety, with another study ﬁnding no difference
in the rate of anxiety disorders between wildﬁre exposed and control groups [17,39]. One
unique study looked at childhood exposure to the Ash Wednesday wildﬁres of 1983 and
followed up with participants 20 years later in adulthood [23]. Only the lifetime rate of any
anxiety disorder other than PTSD was found to be signiﬁcant, speciﬁcally with regards to
environmental phobia [23].

A limitation in studies exploring anxiety is the reliance on scales to objectively mea-
sure anxiety such as the Global Health Questionnaire or the Kessler Psychological Distress
Scale [22,60]. This may limit the ability to make speciﬁc mental health diagnoses, such
as generalized anxiety disorder, without understanding the key criterion and degree of
functional impact within each participant. One mechanism by which wildﬁres increase
victims’ anxiety is the resulting emotion and mental turmoil of uncertainty after experi-
encing such devastating losses and damage to oneself, loved ones, property, belongings,
and livelihood. The sensation of anxiety is not necessarily maladaptive, rather it may serve
a functional purpose of helping create emotional motivation to respond and prepare for
a perceived future threat [85,86]. Therefore, researchers and clinicians must distinguish
between anxiety that serves as a normal and healthy response to a life stressor versus a
debilitating anxiety disorder. Anxiety post-wildﬁre may help provide fuel for appropriate
reactions, such as pursuing ﬁnancial support, rebuilding one’s home, identifying available
community resources, and cumulatively helping a victim heal from such trauma. However,
functionally impairing anxiety describes an emotional response that no longer serves the
individual, and therefore the distinction between the two is critical.

Similarly to the risk factors identiﬁed for PTSD and depression post-wildﬁre, the
risk factors for anxiety can also be separated into patient factors, trauma factors, and
post-trauma factors [31]. Patient factors include younger age or age ≤25 years old, lower
socioeconomic status, a history of anxiety or depressive disorder, being on an antidepres-
sant before the ﬁre or prior adverse experiences in childhood [31,32,64,71,73]. Trauma

related factors increasing the risk of anxiety include witnessing or experiencing property
loss and experiencing or fearing the loss of loved ones [14,26,31,32,42,64]. Finally, fac-
tors that occur post-ﬁre that may increase the risk of developing anxiety were similar to
depression, including perceived lack of support and ongoing life stressors [14,26,31,32,42].

4.4. Substance Use

There is a paucity of evidence speciﬁc to substance use rates and disorders post-
wildﬁre. In the resulting studies identiﬁed from the search terms, substance use post-
wildﬁre was not explored as a primary independent outcome measure but always in
combination with other psychological disorders [26,31,32,68]. It is estimated that at least
50% of individuals with a psychiatric illness will also have a comorbid substance use
disorder at some point in their lives, and this number is signiﬁcantly higher in certain
populations or settings such as in-patient or treatment programs [87–90].

The existing studies indicate that there is an association between increased alcohol
or drug use post-ﬁre and psychiatric disorders [22,26,32,34,42,64]. For example, in adults
6 months post-wildﬁre, those with likely generalized anxiety disorder were three-times
more likely to present with a drug related problem [31]. Studies have found the rate of
alcohol use disorder or heavy alcohol use post-wildﬁre was 17% at 3 months post, 22% at
3 years post, and 18.6% at 10 years post, within the highly impacted community [22,36]. One
study that evaluated substance use in college students 18 months after the Fort McMurray
wildﬁre found a rate of 15.5% for high risk drinking, 13% for problematic drug use, and 4.4%
for moderate-high nicotine dependence, with some gender differences in each category [71].
Some studies have found an association between drug related problems post-wildﬁre and
mental illness but have not found the same relationship with high-risk drinking [32,34,64].
Other studies have found no difference in rates of substance or alcohol use in adults and
adolescents exposed to a wildﬁre [14,23,39]. Thus, the exact relationship between mental
illness and substance use and misuse is still unknown, but is likely reciprocal in nature due
to a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors mutual to both; in addition, each
disease may contribute to the development and persistence of the other through various
factors such as the utilization of a substance as a coping mechanism for symptoms and the
impact of substances on mood [87].

4.5. Resilience

Resilience is a common term found in the primary studies of this review as they
investigated mental health outcomes such as PTSD, MDD, and GAD. It is a difﬁcult concept
to quantify objectively, as it represents such a complex sum of dynamic parts. Broadly,
and within a psychological context, it refers to experiencing stressors and consequently
negative emotional responses but adapting to such adversity with an absence of psychiatric
conditions that by deﬁnition are functionally impairing [91,92]. Researchers have attempted
to quantify resilience post-wildﬁre in patients or participants as the opposite of measures
of psychopathology, i.e., low scores on psychological symptom scales or based on speciﬁc
resiliency scales [22,26,42]. Although survey scales may be the best tool researchers have
to quantify resiliency, they underestimate the ﬂuidity and complexity of its constantly
adapting components including patient characteristics and family and community supports.
Individuals with high resilience scores after experiencing a wildﬁre had lower scores on
screening measures for mental health disorders including PTSD, depression, and anxiety,
and increased self-esteem and quality of life scores [17,73]. There is existing research on the
relationship between resiliency factors such as coping strategies, group involvement, and
psychotherapy with mental health outcomes post-wildﬁre [35,47,49,54]. Another focus of
future research may be on appropriate tools and interventions from a broader public health
perspective, to optimize patient resilience post-wildﬁre and prevent the development of
psychopathology.

4.6. Environmentally Related Distress

Destructive natural disasters such as wildﬁres damage man-made structures but also
the surrounding natural environment. The ensuing mourning and emotional response from
the loss of nature has been termed ecological grief [24,93]. Closely related to ecological
grief, and even called a sub-concept, is the term solastalgia; which is described as the
feeling of homesickness whilst still at home [24]. The Aboriginal population residing in
the Northwest Territories have been studied qualitatively in regards to their response
to experiencing a wildﬁre, and a common theme was mourning their natural home and
way of life [94]. The emotions linked to solastalgia also include anxiety, as it describes an
emotional response that can include worry about potential environmental changes [24].
Eco-anxiety is worry or distress regarding the negative consequences of environmental
changes [24,85,95,96]. The terms ecological grief, solastalgia, and eco-anxiety embody
the psychological distress and reactions that can occur after a natural disaster or from
climate change, and have started to appear in the literature on how wildﬁres impact mental
health. Such terms reﬂect the role by which coping strategies that utilize the connection to
one’s surrounding ecosystem may mitigate feelings of loss, mourning, and stress [97,98].
Qualitative evidence indicates that individuals may ﬁnd a beneﬁt in personal recovery
through interactions and participation in environmental recovery [98]. This may reﬂect the
protective factor a strong environmental connection provides by motivating the individual
to participate in rebuilding processes that help their personal recovery.

4.7. Future Research

The existing studies show that wildﬁres do increase the rates of both medical and
mental illness post-exposure; therefore, another area for future research may be a focus
on the connection between the two, as well as the impact on less-studied outcomes such
as psychosis [13]. McFarlane and Van Hooff identiﬁed limitations within the current
disaster research, describing how the majority of studies are focused on follow-up within
1–2 years rather than greater longitudinal monitoring [99]. More long-term follow-up can
provide key information on risk factors for persistence of psychiatric complications and
information for interventions. Finally, with social media the dissemination of information
is more rapid and uncontrollable than ever before. The public perception of facts and news
is as important as the facts themselves, and future research could be into effective post-
disaster communication, dissemination of information, and the impact on the individual.
A novel method of population mental health support, which has been explored most
recently throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, has been the utilization of supportive text
messages [100]. Studies have found a signiﬁcant reduction in anxiety, depression, and
stress symptoms based on survey scores, as well as in prior randomized controlled clinical
trials [100–106]. High user satisfaction has also been reported with supportive text message
interventions [107–110]. From our literature search, text messaging as an intervention and
public health response has not yet been explored in a wildﬁre impacted population and
could serve as a novel area for research.

4.8. Limitations of the Study

Several of the limitations of this review were due to the constraints of time. Pubmed
and Embase/OVID were chosen as the databases for the literature search, due to their
accessibility and the availability of primary studies. However, including more databases
in our literature search would add to the breadth of results and available data. Another
limitation was that substance use was not one of our core search terms, and it was not
until after the database search that we realized the volume of evidence available on rates of
substance use post-wildﬁre and decided to include information from the included studies
in this review. Other limitations included a single author performing the data extraction, an
additional author would have added to the consistency of result data extracted. Moreover,
not all included articles were peer reviewed, which may inﬂuence the quality of these
studies.

5. Conclusions

With populations continuing to live closer to nature or once forested areas, wildﬁres
will continue to exist and pose a threat to individual wellbeing and public health. In
understanding the consequences of wildﬁres on both medical conditions and mental
disorders, there is a need for a public health response that is comprehensive, sustained, and
as adaptive as the people it serves. There is a strong body of literature to support the impact
of wildﬁres on mental health, but more information is needed on the effective public health
measures and rebuilding strategies that can optimize patient resilience post-wildﬁre.
