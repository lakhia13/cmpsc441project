Abstract

Posttraumatic stress disorder is caused by traumatic events such as death, serious injury,
and sexual violence. Military personnel and veterans are at high risk for posttraumatic stress
disorder. Conventional posttraumatic stress disorder treatments have certain limitations.
Complementary and integrative medicine treatments, especially acupuncture, are potential
novel first-line treatments that may overcome these limitations. We aim to investigate the
current status of the available clinical evidence related to acupuncture treatment for post-
traumatic stress disorder in war veterans. We will follow the scoping review process as pre-
viously described. The study question is as follows: "Which types of clinical research
designs, study types, study durations, adverse events, and clinical outcomes have been
reported regarding acupuncture therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in military veter-
ans?" We will perform a comprehensive search of Medline, Excerpta Medica dataBASE,
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Scopus databases, Allied
and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Lit-
erature, and PsycArticles databases, as well as Chinese, Korean, and Japanese databases,
from inception to June 2022. Data from the included studies will be collected and descrip-
tively analyzed in relation to our research question. The extracted data will be collated, syn-
thesized, and summarized according to the analytical framework of a scoping review. The
protocol of this study adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews to ensure the clarity and completeness of
our reporting in all phases of this scoping review (Protocol registration: https://osf.io/t723f/).
The findings of this scoping review will provide fundamental data that will help researchers
identify appropriate research questions and design further studies on the use of

Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in individuals who have been exposed to one or
more traumatic events such as death, serious injury, or sexual violence [1]. The clinical presen-
tation of PTSD includes fear-based reexperiencing, emotional and behavioral symptoms,
anhedonic or dysphoric mood states, and dissociative symptoms [1]. Active-duty military per-
sonnel and veterans often experience or witness terrorist attacks, violent crimes and abuse,
natural disasters, serious accidents, or violent personal assaults [2], making them extremely
vulnerable to PTSD [3]. Lifetime prevalence of PTSD has been estimated from 1.3%–8.8% [4].
Among Vietnam War veterans, 30.9% were diagnosed with PTSD [5]. In addition, 12.9% of
Iraq veterans and 7.1% of Afghanistan veterans reportedly have PTSD [6]. PTSD is usually
associated with comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders [7]. In
veterans with PTSD, suicidal ideation was reportedly 23.8% and suicide attempts were 6.8%
owing to military combat trauma [8]. Furthermore, PTSD is related to chronic pain [9], car-
diovascular disease [10], metabolic syndrome, and elevated C-reactive protein levels [11].
Many military personnel from around the world have been on the battlefield in civil and local
wars and counterterrorism [12]. The conflict in Ukraine started in Donbas in 2014 when Rus-
sia annexed Crimea and has recently escalated to an all-out war. A study has already been pub-
lished examining PTSD caused by the war in Donbas [13]. Furthermore, enormous mental
health consequences are expected for the people of Ukraine [14].

Most clinical guidelines recommend cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective sero-

tonin reuptake inhibitors as first-line psychological and pharmacological therapies, respec-
tively, for patients with PTSD [15]. However, CBT has a limitation in that it is time consuming
and costly, requires training to perform treatments [16], and is difficult to use owing to low
accessibility [17]. Although internet-based CBT may be an option to increase access to treat-
ment, it may not be suitable for patients who are uncomfortable with technology [18]. Only
two medications have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment
of PTSD in adults (sertraline and paroxetine) [19]. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver and may cause several adverse effects such as
extrapyramidal symptoms, serotonin syndrome, QT prolongation, congenital malformations,
and hyponatremia [20]. Stigma exists in military culture, along with treatment barriers such as
costs and low accessibility to mental health care [21]. PTSD tends to be more prominent
among personnel who meet the criteria for a mental health problem [22].

Recently, complementary and integrative medicine treatments for patients with PTSD have

gained increased attention [23]. Acupuncture is a nonpharmacological therapy involving the
insertion of needles into specific points on the body or ear, known as acupuncture points. The
use of acupuncture in veterans is a promising complementary and integrative medicine
approach [24]. Specific forms of auricular acupuncture, such as the National Acupuncture
Detoxification Association (NADA) protocol and battlefield acupuncture (BFA), are used in
the health management of military personnel. The NADA protocol, which consists of five stan-
dard auricular acupuncture points, was originally designed to help acute heroin addiction,
although it is also used for a broad range of mental health problems [25]. The NADA protocol
was effective in improving PTSD-induced insomnia in combat veterans [26]. BFA, which is a
safe, fast, and easily applied acupuncture treatment, has been proven effective for treating a

variety of pain conditions [27]. Evidence suggests that BFA can help with chronic pain and
sleep disturbances in veterans [28]. Sleep disturbances are a core feature of PTSD and can
affect its progression [29]. Furthermore, chronic pain in veterans with PTSD is associated with
many negative health-related outcomes, such as disability, depression, sleep disturbance, cata-
strophizing beliefs, and lower function [30]. Therefore, although BFA has mainly been used
for pain, it has the potential to alleviate PTSD symptoms in veterans through pain control and
improved sleep.

A scoping review is more appropriate than a systematic review when the research explores
a broad range of questions, such as which research design was adopted in the topic of interest,
and can help to identify major concepts and characteristics in the existing literature as well as
knowledge gaps [31]. As studies on acupuncture for PTSD in veterans have not been actively
conducted, our research team determined that a scoping review method with a wider view of
the relevant field may be more appropriate for this study than a systematic review of random-
ized controlled studies.

We aim to explore the clinical research designs used in studies conducted on acupuncture
treatment for war veterans with PTSD. We will also focus on detailed methodological charac-
teristics, such as treatment regimens, participant characteristics, and frequently used out-
comes. This study will enable us to identify any research gaps between clinical studies and the
needs of physicians regarding clinical evidence. The results of our scoping review can be used
as fundamental data for identifying the appropriate research questions in research planning of
future clinical studies and systematic reviews.

Materials and methods
Study design and registration

We follow the scoping review process described by Arksey and O’Malley [32], Levac et al., and
Tricco et al. [33,34] as well as the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews criteria. This review protocol was registered with the
Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/t723f/) on July 23, 2022.

Stage 1: Identifying the study questions

This stage is based on a preliminary literature search of published clinical evidence. Agreement
among the research team members was required to obtain better scoping review research ques-
tions. The research team comprises three specialists in neuropsychiatry (SHK, CYK, and
HYK), a specialist in clinical research on traditional East Asian medicine (JL), and an under-
graduate researcher (HBS). All members of the research team agreed on the concepts and revi-
sions of the research questions. In our scoping review, we will attempt to answer the following
questions:

1. What are the characteristics (e.g., research design and target population) of studies on the

use of acupuncture for PTSD management in military veterans?

2. Which clinical outcomes were adopted in previous studies on PTSD management in mili-

tary veterans?

3. What is the regimen of acupuncture therapy for PTSD management in military veterans?

4. What have previous studies reported on with respect to the effectiveness and safety of using

acupuncture for treating PTSD in military veterans?

Stage 2: Identifying relevant studies

Information sources. We will restrict this review to peer-reviewed studies on acupunc-
ture for PTSD. A literature search will be conducted from inception to June 2022. The follow-
ing databases will be searched: Medline (via PubMed), Excerpta Medica dataBASE, Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Scopus, Allied and Complementary
Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycArticles,
China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, Oriental Medicine Advanced
Searching Integrated System, Korea Citation Index, and Citation Information by NII. We will
also consider gray literature searches such as conference proceedings and doctoral disserta-
tions using Google Scholar. The reference lists of the relevant reviews and retrieved articles
will be manually searched. Attempts will be made to contact the authors of published papers
for which electronic files cannot be accessed. This search strategy was developed through con-
sultation with a clinical researcher, an expert on literature review, and a specialist on psychiat-
ric diseases. Search terms will comprise disease (PTSD due to war exposure) and intervention
terms (acupuncture). A combination of various synonyms and related medical subject head-
ings will be used in the search strategy. The search terms and strategies are detailed in
S1 Table.

Eligibility criteria: Study types. Clinical research studies examining the effects of acu-
puncture in patients with PTSD (military veterans) will be included. The following types of
clinical research studies will be included in this review: randomized controlled clinical trials,
quasi-randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, single-arm trials, case
series, cross-sectional studies, and feasibility studies

We will exclude case reports with less than three patients [35], literature reviews, and pre-

clinical studies. Moreover, we will review the reference articles of each systematic review.

Eligibility criteria: Types of participants. Military veterans with PTSD and related symp-

toms after combat exposure will be included. We will include studies that used standardized
diagnostic criteria for PTSD (such as those presented in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders and the International Classification of Diseases). We will also include
studies that used cut-off values from validated PTSD evaluation tools (such as the PTSD
Checklist, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale) as the
inclusion criteria for participants. Furthermore, we will include PTSD with comorbid medical
illnesses such as tinnitus or traumatic brain injury.

Eligibility criteria: Intervention types. Various acupuncture therapies include manual
acupuncture, electroacupuncture, bee-venom acupuncture, pharmacopuncture, warm-needle
acupuncture, fire needle acupuncture, and acupotomy. However, we will not include acupres-
sure therapy in this study, and we will not restrict the concomitant treatment. With the excep-
tion of East Asian traditional medicine interventions, such as herbal medicine, moxibustion,
cupping, and tui-na, any type of control group intervention will be included. The treatment
period, dosage, and acupuncture treatment frequency will not be restricted.

Eligibility criteria: Outcome measurements. We will also consider various symptoms
after the diagnosis of PTSD. We will not restrict the types of outcome variables. The outcomes
will be categorized according to a previous study [36] as follows: 1) outcomes related to psy-
chological aspects (anxiety, fear, anger, irritability, guilt, shame, apathy, distrust, sadness, frus-
tration, alienation, loss of confidence, and mourning); 2) outcomes related to somatic aspects
(insomnia, palpitation, pain, anorexia, and fatigue); and 3) outcomes related to cognitive
aspects (decreased memory, difficulty making decisions, repeated recall of traumatic events,
and difficulty concentrating). In terms of safety, we will also investigate the incidence of
adverse events and dropout rates.

Stage 3: Study selection

The inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed with the consensus of the research team.
Two reviewers (HBS and HYK) will independently conduct the article selection process. After
eliminating duplicate publications in the first phase, the titles and abstracts of the screened
articles will be reviewed for inclusion. For potential articles in the second screening phase, the
full text will be reviewed to determine whether the article meets the inclusion criteria. The rea-
sons for inclusion and exclusion will be recorded for each article according to the predeter-
mined criteria. In cases of discrepancies, an agreement will be achieved through mediation by
the independent researcher. Details of the study selection process are shown in Fig 1.

Stage 4: Charting the data

A data extraction sheet was prepared by the study team after the pilot test. After multiple itera-
tions, a standard data extraction form was created. The following items will be collected from
the included studies: 1) general information, such as the first author’s name, country, publica-
tion year, and research design; 2) participants’ demographic data, such as age, sex, number of
participants (initial and final), diagnostic criteria, and disease duration and severity; 3) detailed
information on interventions such as type of acupuncture, acupuncture points, treatment dos-
age (number, frequency), treatment period, and details of control/concomitant interventions;
and 4) outcome variables. Data regarding effects, safety, and research findings will also be
extracted.

Two reviewers (HBS and HYK) will separately undertake the data extraction using the
described method and will crosscheck the data from all included articles. Any disagreement
will be resolved through discussion until consensus with a third researcher (SHK).

Stage 5: Collating, summarizing, and reporting the results

The extracted data will be collated, synthesized, and summarized according to the analytical
framework of the scoping review.

In the qualitative analysis stage, we will provide information on the included studies,
including the author’s name, country, publication year, combat details, number of partici-
pants, sex, age, research design, and type of treatment/control group interventions. In a second
table titled “Detailed information of acupuncture treatment,” we will provide detailed informa-
tion regarding interventions such as type of acupuncture, location of acupuncture points,
number of treatments, treatment frequency, treatment period, and details of control/concomi-
tant interventions. In a third table titled “Effects and safety of acupuncture treatment for PTSD
and related symptoms,” the results of every outcome from the included studies will be pre-
sented along with the conclusion of each study. The number of adverse events will also be pre-
sented. In addition, we will provide a table titled “Research map” to visualize the status of
current research and frequently used outcomes to assist with future research planning. The
findings of our study may help researchers and practitioners identify knowledge gaps in the lit-
erature regarding acupuncture for PTSD.

Ethics and dissemination

This study does not require ethical approval because we will retrieve and analyze data from
previously published studies, in which informed consent was obtained by the primary investi-
gators. This scoping review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Discussion

PTSD due to active military combat trauma is very common among military personnel and
veterans [2–6]. However, PTSD treatments have many limitations [15–22]. As an alternative,
complementary and integrative medicine, including acupuncture, may be considered for the
treatment of PTSD [23]. Acupuncture, such as BFA, is widely used for soldiers [27,28]. To
date, there have been no comprehensive reviews of acupuncture therapy for PTSD in military
personnel and veterans. Therefore, we will perform the first scoping review. Our review will
summarize the treatment regimens, participant characteristics, and frequently used outcomes,
and will also identify knowledge gaps to assist in the planning of future studies. Because acu-
puncture is a non-psychological and non-pharmacological intervention, it may help overcome
barriers to PTSD treatment, such as stigma in the military culture, high costs, and low

accessibility to mental health care [37]. The fundamental data obtained in this scoping review
will contribute to the designing of future studies that aim to collect evidence on the effective-
ness and safety of acupuncture-based treatments for PTSD in military veterans. Furthermore,
the findings from this review will also be helpful to clinicians who want to use acupuncture to
manage PTSD in this population. Nevertheless, this study has some limitations. First, consulta-
tion, which is both the last step of scoping registration and an optional sixth step, cannot be
planned. This is because it is difficult and unethical to verify the results of this review by creat-
ing an artificial war environment for patients with PTSD. Second, although we will perform a
comprehensive search, related studies published in languages other than English, Korean, Chi-
nese, and Japanese may be excluded.

For further dissemination, the research findings will be submitted to an appropriate scien-

tific journal. This study will also be presented at a neuropsychiatric academic conference.
Moreover, we will develop an e-leaflet to provide the key findings of our review to the research
community via social network services.

Conclusions

The findings of this scoping review will provide fundamental data that will help researchers
identify appropriate research questions and design further studies on the use of acupuncture
for PTSD management in military veterans. These results will be helpful for developing disas-
ter site-specific research protocols for future clinical trials on this topic.
