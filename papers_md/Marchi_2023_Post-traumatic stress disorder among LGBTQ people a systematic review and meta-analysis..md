Abstract
Aims. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people (LGBTQ) are at increased risk of
traumatization. This systematic review aimed to summarize data regarding the risk of post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for LGBTQ people and their subgroups.
Methods. Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO and EMBASE were searched until September 2022.
Studies reporting a comparative estimation of PTSD among LGBTQ population and the gen-
eral population (i.e., heterosexual/cisgender), without restrictions on participants’ age and
setting for the enrolment, were identified. Meta-analyses were based on odds ratio (OR and 95%
confidence intervals [CI]), estimated through inverse variance models with random effects.
Results. The review process led to the selection of 27 studies, involving a total of 31,903
LGBTQ people and 273,842 controls, which were included in the quantitative synthesis.
Overall, LGBTQ people showed an increased risk of PTSD (OR: 2.20 [95% CI: 1.85; 2.60]),
although there was evidence of marked heterogeneity in the estimate (I2 = 91%). Among
LGBTQ subgroups, transgender people showed the highest risk of PTSD (OR: 2.52 [95% CI:
2.22; 2.87]) followed by bisexual people (OR: 2.44 [95% CI: 1.05; 5.66]), although these com-
parisons are limited by the lack of data for other sexual and gender minorities, such as intersex
people. Interestingly, the risk of PTSD for bisexual people was confirmed also considering les-
bian and gay as control group (OR: 1.44 [95% CI: 1.07; 1.93]). The quality of the evidence was
low.
Conclusions. LGBTQ people are at higher risk of PTSD compared with their cisgender/het-
erosexual peers. This evidence may contribute to the public awareness on LGBTQ mental
health needs and suggest supportive strategies as well as preventive interventions (e.g., sup-
portive programs, counselling, and destigmatizing efforts) as parts of a tailored health-care
planning aimed to reduce psychiatric morbidity in this at-risk population.

Introduction

Despite continuing actions put to achieve social recognition and legal rights, in many areas of
the world, sexual minorities are still highly exposed to traumatization (International Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, 2015). A growing body of evidence underlined
that the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people (LGBTQ) are more exposed to
traumatic events in life, including hate crimes, intimate partner violence and sexual assaults
(Mongelli et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2010; Seelman et al., 2017; Trombetta and Rollè, 2022;
Walters et al., 2013). Also, a higher prevalence of childhood abuse was found among sexual
minority children, which accounted for up to half of mental health disparities by sexual orien-
tation, especially for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Roberts et al., 2012). According to
the diagnostic criteria, PTSD is developed in response to events that overpower the adaptative
ability of the person, and the listed traumatic experiences entail being directly exposed to death,
threatened death or severe personal damage, including physical or sexual assault (Long et al.,
2008). The core clinical features of PTSD are that people tend to re-experience the traumatic
event intrusively, with detrimental consequences on personal functioning and high psycholog-
ical suffering (Pai et al., 2017; Sareen, 2014). In addition, PTSD revealed as a multidimensional
disorder, with different neurobiological underpinnings, including alterations of the sympathetic
nervous system (De Berardis et al., 2015, 2020). Over the years, the literature identified as trau-
matic also less intense situations, but for which the traumatic potential consists in the systematic
repetition of the experience, such as being persecuted and discriminated against, especially for
invariable personal characteristics such as race, religious beliefs, gender and sexual orientation

(Alessi et al., 2013; Auxéméry, 2018; Keating and Muller, 2020;
Livingston et al., 2022; Solomon et al., 2021). The Minority Stress
Model proposed by Meyer (2003), provides a theoretical frame-
work for understanding the ways in which repeated traumas can
lead to an increased prevalence of mental disorders among sexual
minorities. Research showed that sexual minorities’ minority stress
can lead to emotional dysregulation, social and interpersonal con-
flicts and negative cognition that can mediate the association with
poor mental health outcomes (Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Marchi et al.,
2022a; Mongelli et al., 2019). Moreover, internalized homopho-
bia has been shown to predict PTSD symptom severity in sexual
minorities with a history of trauma (Gold et al., 2011). LGBTQ
groups are also at increased risk of suicidal behaviours, and that
has been hypothesized to be a consequence of the experience of
repeated discrimination (Livingston et al., 2022; Marchi et al.,
2022a). Therefore, recognizing and addressing PTSD may have an
impact on psychopathology translationally.

Our study aimed to explore the risk of PTSD in the LGBTQ
population compared with non-LGBTQ individuals, independent
of the type or intensity of the trauma to which individuals may have
been exposed. The secondary goal was to detail the risk of PTSD
among different subgroups such as gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans-
gender, intersex and queer individuals, compared with cisgender
heterosexual ones.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according
to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Page et al., 2021). The protocol of
this study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022354616).

Data sources and search strategy

We searched the PubMed (Medline), Scopus, PsycINFO and
EMBASE databases until September 30, 2022, using the strategy
outlined in the Supplementary Table S1 of the Appendix. With the
aim to maximize the number of studies included, no restrictions
regarding the language of publication or publication date were set.

Eligibility criteria

We included observational studies reporting a comparative estima-
tion of rate of PTSD among the LGBTQ population vs. the general
population (i.e., heterosexual cisgender—controls), without any
restriction on participants’ age or setting of the enrolment.

We excluded reviews, case reports, case series and studies that
did not report data for the measurements of the outcome in the
targeted population. We only included studies published in peer-
reviewed journals, excluding conference abstracts and disserta-
tions. If data from the same sample were published in multiple
works, we considered only that study reporting more exhaustive
information. Sample overlap was ruled out through a careful check
of the registration codes as well as the place and year(s) of sampling.

Terms and definitions

LGBTQ status was defined as self-reported. PTSD diagnosis had
to be defined according to standard operational diagnostic criteria
(i.e., according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders [DSM] (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) or

the International Classification of Diseases [ICD] (World Health
Organization, 2018)). We also included studies where PTSD diag-
nosis was made according to the score on validated psychometric
tools, operationalized to ICD or DSM definition.

Data collection and extraction

Four authors (MM, DU, EDM and AT) preliminarily reviewed
titles and abstracts of retrieved articles. The initial screening was
followed by the analysis of full texts to check compliance with
inclusion/exclusion criteria. A standardized form was used for
data extraction. Information concerning the year of publication,
country, setting, name of the study/cohort, characteristics of study
participants (sample size, age, percentages of men and women),
LGBTQ status and PTSD rates among the LGBTQ groups and
the controls were collected by two authors (MM and PG) inde-
pendently. Extraction sheets for each study were cross-checked
for consistency, and any disagreement was resolved by discussion
within the research group.

Statistical analyses

The meta-analysis was performed by comparing PTSD rates
between controls vs. overall LGBTQ people and controls vs. each
LGBTQ subgroup. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confi-
dence intervals (95% CIs) were generated using inverse variance
models with random effects (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986). The
results were summarized using forest plots. Standard Q tests
and the I2 statistic (i.e., the percentage of variability in preva-
lence estimates attributable to heterogeneity rather than sam-
pling error or chance, with values of I2 ≥ 75% indicating high
heterogeneity) were used to assess between-study heterogeneity
(Higgins and Thompson, 2002). Leave-one-out analysis and meta-
regression were performed to examine sources of between-study
heterogeneity.

If the meta-analysis included more than 10 studies (Sterne et al.,
2011), funnel plot analysis and the Egger test were performed
to test for publication bias. The Egger test quantifies bias cap-
tured in the funnel plot analysis using the value of effect sizes
and their precision (i.e., the standard errors) and assumes that
the quality of study conduct is independent of study size. If anal-
yses showed a significant risk of publication bias, the ‘trim and
fill’ method was employed to estimate the number of missing
studies and the adjusted effect size (Duval and Tweedie, 2000;
Sterne et al., 2008; Sutton, 2000; Terrin et al., 2003). All the
analyses were performed in R (RStudio Team, 2021) using meta
and metafor packages (Balduzzi et al., 2019; Viechtbauer, 2010).
Statistical tests were two-sided and used a significance threshold of
p-value < 0.05.

Risk of bias assessment and the GRADE

Bias risk in the included studies was independently assessed by five
reviewers (AT, DU, EDM, PG and EA), using the Cochrane risk
of bias tool (Higgins et al., 2011). Each item on the risk of bias
assessment was scored as high, low or unclear, and the GRADE tool
was used to assess the overall certainty of evidence (Schünemann
et al., 2013). Further information is available in the Supplementary
Appendix.

Results

Study characteristics

Figure 1 summarizes the paper selection process: from 654 records
screened on title and abstract, 126 full texts were analysed. The
review process led to the selection of 27 studies (Alba et al., 2022;
Bettis et al., 2020; Brewerton et al., 2022; Brown and Jones, 2016;
Burns et al., 2015; Caceres et al., 2019; Carey et al., 2022; Evans-
Polce et al., 2020; Flentje et al., 2016; Hao et al., 2021; Harper et al.,
2021; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2009; Holloway et al., 2021; Jeffery et al.,
2021; Lehavot and Simpson, 2014; Livingston et al., 2022; Lucas
et al., 2018; McDonald et al., 2020; Mustanski et al., 2010; Roberts
et al., 2012; Rodriguez-Seijas et al., 2019; Schefter et al., 2022; Terra
et al., 2022; Walukevich-Dienst et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021; Weiss
et al., 2015; Whitbeck et al., 2004), referring to 27 different sam-
ples, leading to a total of 273,842 controls (i.e., heterosexual or
cisgender) and 31,903 LGBTQ people, which were included in the
quantitative synthesis.

On average across the studies, the assigned sex at birth was
female for 53.5% of participants (range: from 0% to 100%).

The mean age of participants across the studies ranged from 14.7 to
60 years old (median age across the studies was 26.4). The selected
studies were conducted in four countries: US (n = 24; 88.9%),
Australia, Brazil and Kenya (n = 1 each; 3.7%). All the studies
included were published in the last 20 years. Data collection begun
after 2000 for most of the studies (n = 20; 74.1%), before 2000 for
three studies (11.1%), and not reported in four studies (14.8%).
PTSD was defined according to DSM (n = 16; 59.3%), ICD (n = 3;
11.1%), self-reported (n = 3; 11.1%) and validated psychometric
scales (n = 5; 18.5%). Sample weights ranged from 6.3% to 1.3%.

All study characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Narrative synthesis of the type of trauma reported across the
studies

Besides PTSD diagnosis, 16 (59.3%) studies also collected infor-
mation about the type of trauma experienced by participants.
However, it is worth noting that the studies investigated trau-
matic experiences without necessarily establishing a temporal or

etiological association with the current PTSD status; rather they
often reported that information seemingly for descriptive pur-
poses. The reported type of trauma consisted of childhood mal-
treatment or adverse childhood experiences in three studies, sexual
abuse in five studies, interpersonal violence and sexual and vio-
lence related to gender minorities in three studies and a cancer
diagnosis in one study. Two studies examined violence experienced
during both childhood and adulthood, while two veteran studies
did not specify the type of traumatic experience, although it is rea-
sonable to assume exposure to military and war-related trauma in
these cases. For a more comprehensive overview of the exposure
to traumatic experiences across the studies, see Supplementary
Table S2.

Analysis of PTSD rate among LGBTQ and controls

Twenty-two studies (81.5%) reported outcome data about PTSD
among LGBTQ and controls. As displayed in Fig. 2, LGBTQ
people showed an increased risk of PTSD compared with
matched non-LGBTQ controls, though with significant evidence of
between-study heterogeneity (pooled OR: 2.20 [95%CI: 1.85; 2.60];
I2 = 91%; p < 0.001).

Analysis of PTSD rate among lesbian and gay and controls

Four (14.8%) studies detailed data on PTSD for the lesbian and
gay subgroups. Meta-analyses indicated that lesbian and gay people
displayed increased risk of PTSD (pooled OR: 1.96 [95% CI: 1.13;
3.39]), though the estimate was affected by significant between-
study heterogeneity (I2 = 93%; p < 0.001). The results are displayed
in Fig. 3.

Furthermore, two studies (7.4%) compared the risk of PTSD
among lesbian and gay: one study detected significant increased

risk for lesbian, the other did not find significant differences
between the two groups. The pooled estimate was indicating
increased risk for lesbian than gay, but the CIs crossed zero (pooled
OR: 1.79 [95% CI: 0.74; 4.33]), and there was evidence of high
between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 89%; p < 0.001). The results
are displayed in the Supplementary Figure S1.

Analysis of PTSD rate among bisexual and controls

Four studies (14.8%) detailed data on PTSD for the bisexual
subgroup. Meta-analyses showed that bisexual people displayed
increased risk of PTSD (pooled OR: 2.44 [95% CI: 1.05; 5.66]),
with significant between-study heterogeneity affecting the estimate
(I2 = 95%; p < 0.001). The results are displayed in Fig. 4.

Analysis of PTSD rate among lesbian and gay and bisexual

Seven studies (25.9%) provided data on PTSD rate among les-
bian, gay and bisexual. Meta-analysis of the comparison of the
PTSD risk among the two groups showed increased risk for bisex-
ual than lesbian and gay (pooled OR: 1.44 [95% CI: 1.07; 1.93]).
The between-study heterogeneity was moderate, though statisti-
cally significant (I2 = 61%; p = 0.02). The results are displayed in
Supplementary Figure S2.

Analysis of PTSD rate among transgender and controls

Seven studies (25.9%) reported outcome data about PTSD among
transgender and cisgender controls. As displayed in Fig. 5, trans-
gender people showed an increased risk of PTSD compared with
matched cisgender controls, though with significant evidence of
between-study heterogeneity (pooled OR: 2.52 [95% CI: 2.22;
2.87]; I2 = 79%; p < 0.001).

Analysis of PTSD rate among queer and controls

Since only one study (3.7%) provided outcome data about queer
and controls, meta-analysis was not performed on that outcome,
even though the study reported an increased risk for the queer
group (OR: 1.84 [95% CI: 1.04; 3.25]).

Publication bias and meta-regression

There was no evidence of publication bias in the primary estimate
as shown by Egger’s test p-value > 0.05 and by the funnel plots
displayed in the Supplementary Figure S3.

Leave-one-out analysis, in which the meta-analysis of PTSD
among LGBTQ and controls was serially repeated after the exclu-
sion of each study, showed that irrelevant changes in the pooled
estimate were obtained by excluding each one study. When the
study from Flentje et al. (Flentje et al., 2016) was excluded from
the analysis, there was a decrease in the amount of heterogene-
ity, which, however, was not statistically significant because the
value of I2 = 76% still indicated high between-study heterogeneity.
Therefore, there was no evidence of significant outlier effect played

by any of the study (leave-one-out data available in Supplementary
Table S3).

Meta-regression analyses were performed on the following vari-
ables, potentially associated with heterogeneity: (1) the percentage
of females in the total sample; (2) the mean age of participants;
(3) the country where the study was conducted; (4) assessment
of PTSD applied; and (5) the year of publication. In the univari-
able meta-regression model the variables that resulted significantly
correlated with the variance in the risk of PTSD were the coun-
try where the study was performed (USA, B: 0.786 [95% CI: 0.611;
0.960]) and the PTSD assessment applied (DSM or ICD, B: 0.996
[95% CI: 0.779; 1.21]; validated psychometric scale, B: −0.402
[95% CI: −0.721; −0.084]). Univariable meta-regression results are
displayed in Supplementary Table S4.

GRADE of the evidence

A summary on the risk of bias in all 27 trials is reported in the
Supplementary Figures S4 and S5, along with an assessment of the
quality of the evidence (Supplementary Table S5). In the GRADE
system, the evidence from observational studies is initially set to

low, there are then criteria that can be used either to downgrade or
upgrade (see further information in the Supplementary Material).
The quality of the evidence was rated low for the main analysis of
LGBTQ vs. controls. For the secondary analyses, the evidence was
rated from low to very low.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to describe the risk
of PTSD among LGBTQ people. Our results indicate that LGBTQ
people are at increased risk of PTSD compared to matched non-
LGBTQ controls. These findings confirm the relationship between
sexual variant status and exposure to trauma (International
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, 2015;
Livingston et al., 2022; Marchi et al., 2022a; Walters et al., 2013).
For example, violence provoked by the same partner and sexual
assault in adulthood are disproportionately more prevalent among
minorities of sexual orientation (Trombetta and Rollè, 2022), and
individuals with minority sexual orientation reported a high fre-
quency, severity and persistence of physical and sexual abuses
during childhood (Roberts et al., 2012). Interestingly, research
evidence on the psychological consequences of the exposure to
trauma, including adverse childhood experience, are not limited
to PTSD (Elkrief et al., 2021; Marchi et al., 2022b, 2020). In this
perspective, the association between the sexual variant status and
experiences of traumatization may be relevant also for other forms
of psychopathology. Intersectionality may be another appropri-
ate model for understanding the different impact of trauma on
LGBTQ people. In our review, we included six studies conducted
on samples of veterans (Brown and Jones, 2016; Carey et al., 2022;
Holloway et al., 2021; Jeffery et al., 2021; Livingston et al., 2022;
McDonald et al., 2020), all showing that LGBTQ veterans are at
increased risk of PTSD compared to their non-LGBTQ peers, inde-
pendent of the experience of traumatization to which they may
have been exposed. Such higher risk of PTSD has been observed
also in other LGBTQ people belonging to vulnerable populations,
such as with HIV or part of racial and ethnic minorities (Glynn
et al., 2021). For these populations, treatment seeking and adher-
ence are still a challenge, and suffering from mental health prob-
lems, such as PTSD, may be playing as a mediator (Marchi et al.,
2022c; Oni et al., 2019).

Although the comparison of the PTSD risk between the sex-
ual and gender minority groups was limited by the lack of data
from some less studied populations, such as intersex, our data sug-
gest that among LGBTQ groups, the highest risk of PTSD was
found for transgender people, followed by bisexuals. This is con-
sistent with previous evidence estimating increased risk of inter-
personal violence for transgender people, as well as higher risk of
depression, anxiety, substance use and suicidality (Valentine and
Shipherd, 2018). Research on bisexual individuals, instead, sug-
gested that they may be potentially excluded from LGBTQ com-
munity initiatives, due to the stereotypes according to which bisex-
uals are promiscuous or that bisexuality is ‘just a phase’. Indeed,
from a social perspective, bisexuality—and to some extent also
intersexuality—challenges binary thinking and normative assump-
tions. Invisibility and lack of community support could explain
the higher incidence of mental health problems, including PTSD
(Baams et al., 2015). Embracing an ethical perspective able to
account for fluidity and multiplicity, such as queer ethics, might
create a more inclusive framework that accounts for the expe-
riences of all members of the LGBTQ communities (Däumer,
1992).

By looking at the contribution of each study in the analyses, it
is possible to observe that the studies from Flentje et al. (Flentje
et al., 2016) and Mustanski et al. (Mustanski et al., 2010) provided
estimates that were less coherent with the others. This can be due
to the sampling strategies implemented: Mustanski et al. enrolled
a sample made only of sexual minority individuals and observed a
small number of cases of PTSD; Flentje et al. made comparison of
PTSD rates by sexual orientation or by gender identity; therefore,
the comparison of PTSD risk by sexual orientation could include
also transgender individuals. This intuition is supported by the fact
that the comparison between transgender and cisgender provided
by Flentje et al. was coherent with the others. In addition, the sam-
ple by Flentje et al. was made of homeless people, which is already
a population with relevant vulnerabilities for mental health. This
is supported also by the results of another study included in this
review and conducted on a sample of homeless people (Hao et al.,
2021) providing estimates with CI crossing 1. Consequently, the
estimate of higher risk of PTSD for transgender homeless com-
pared to cisgender homeless people provided by Flentje et al. is
consistent with the intersectionality model proposed above in this
section. The analysis of the forest plot of the primary compari-
son showed substantial between-study heterogeneity. Despite this,
leave-one-out analysis did not detect significant outlier effects.
Univariable meta-regression found that the pooled estimate of
PTSD risk was affected by the country, although with much imbal-
ance in the distribution of the classes (i.e., 21 out of 22 studies
were conducted in USA) and the assessment of PTSD applied.
Specifically, studies assessing PTSD by applying diagnostic man-
uals criteria (i.e., DSM or ICD) could provide lower effect size for
the pooled odds of PTSD among LGBTQ. This is consistent with
previous evidence of only moderate diagnostic agreement between
the systems used, with likely stricter definition of PTSD applied
in the diagnostic manuals (Elmose Andersen et al., 2022; Murphy
et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the high heterogeneity detected would
not seem to be a limitation but a possible indicator of the trend of
PTSD in LGBTQ people through time and in its possible declina-
tion across different samples. The low detection of publication bias
seems to support this interpretation.

Limitations

The present study yielded robust findings; however, it should be
interpreted considering some limitations. First, the heterogene-
ity on the PTSD assessment used in the studies. Most of the
studies considered DSM and ICD definitions of PTSD, which con-
sisted, respectively, in the presence of a traumatic event involving
exposure to real or threatened death, serious injury or sexual vio-
lence (criterion A of DSM) or a protracted response to a stressful
event or situation of an exceptionally threatening or catastrophic
nature, which is likely to cause distress to almost anybody (ICD).
Evaluations tailored on specific stress experienced by LGBTQ peo-
ple (e.g., consistent with the Minority Stress Model) are lacking.
These could lead to more accurate understanding of the risk of
post-traumatic stress to which this population is exposed. Second,
some studies included in the final selection did not provide all
information about the sample composition (i.e., four studies did
not report participants age and two studies did not report the sex
assigned at birth of participants). This lack of information might
have affected the results of meta-regression. Third, although the
Egger test did not detect publication bias in any of the analyses, the
funnel plot of the primary comparison seems to suggest that publi-
cation bias might be present. That may be due to between-study

8

heterogeneity, which can give that plotting especially for those
studies with large standard error. In addition, the number of the
studies included in the subgroups meta-analyses was <10, which
was not enough to inform about publication bias (Sterne et al.,
2011). Finally, we could not achieve our initial aim to detail PTSD
risk for each LGBTQ group (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender
and queer) because many studies did not consider these separated
groups. In addition, there is limited research with enough par-
ticipants that could be used to validate these findings for other
sexual and gender minority groups, such as intersex people. There
is an important need for international research to explore this area
further.

Implications for research and practice

Traumatization and post-traumatic stress among sexual minorities
are unaddressed issues. Critically, the concept of trauma should be
investigated also beyond that considered by the diagnostic systems,
especially for minority populations, such as LGBTQ. For instance,
the literature is highlighting the negative effect of repeated inter-
personal microaggressions. These are verbal expressions, attitudes
and behaviours, which, intentionally or unintentionally, commu-
nicate hostile, derogatory, negative, prejudicial and offensive mes-
sages towards members of minority groups (Johnston and Nadal,
2010; Nadal et al., 2016). The prefix micro does not describe the
quality or the impact of these aggressions but rather the subtle way
in which this type of discrimination occurs, making microaggres-
sions very difficult to recognize, study and demonstrate, eluding
the available diagnostic criteria. Microaggression may be consid-
ered benign or harmless by the perpetrator, with the risk to become
pervasive and automatic in daily interactions. Research has shown
that experiencing microaggressions can damage people’s mental
health and lead to chronic stress, depression, anxiety and low
self-esteem (Flentje et al., 2020; Nicholson et al., 2022).

On a primary prevention level, programs and guidelines should
be developed and employed in violence prevention to strengthen
protective factors and foster resilience. Such efforts should be
intensified for LGBTQ people with the aim of reducing minority
stress and the barriers to disclosure and seeking help among the
victims. For example, psychoeducation campaigns aimed at reduc-
ing victim-blaming and promoting intervening behaviours by
bystanders has shown to be an effective mean of preventing inter-
personal violence in societal settings (Fischer et al., 2011; Wijaya
et al., 2022). Also, awareness and education campaigns, associated
with severe sentences for sexual minority-related crimes, could
be valid responses to reduce the risk of violence and increase the
security of LGBTQ people. Arguably, intersectional analysis would
make it possible to give a modern reading of social discrimination
phenomena. Embracing this would allow better understanding of
systemic, institutional and social disparities contributing to the
experiences of discrimination of the LGBTQ communities (Bendl
et al., 2015).
