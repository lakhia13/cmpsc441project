Editorial on the Research Topic

Immigration and Mental Health in Modern Societies

The papers in this collection break new ground in the study of migration and mental health through
a focus on speciﬁc populations of interest in transnational context. The studies examine new
migrant populations, e.g., refugees from the Syrian civil war, and new trends within well-established
migrant ﬂows, e.g., return migration in Mexico. Two of the papers examine mental health
intervention strategies. Lakkis et al. present results of a preliminary study of a parenting skills
training intervention conducted under what must be extremely challenging circumstances for
service delivery, not to mention research, in refugee camps located in Lebanon and Jordan for
families recently dislocated from Syria. The promising ﬁndings, the careful description of the
program, and the thoughtful discussion of the ﬁndings will beneﬁt future program development
and research. Falas-Bague et al. also study an intervention provided to a migrant group in two
diﬀerent national settings. The targets of this intervention are migrants from Latin America, and
the intervention was provided in the U.S. and in Spain. The intervention is tailored to the needs
of a speciﬁc group and implemented within standard health care settings. The positive evidence
regarding feasibility and uptake suggest that this strategy can address some causes of disparities in
treatment use. Evidence that people who had previously avoided care due to distrust of the health
care system responded positively to this intervention is particularly compelling. In both papers,
clinical knowledge and expertise follows the population, not the provider. Tailored clinical services
do not need to be reinvented from scratch in each country to which a group moves.

from periods of residence in the United States. Ojeda et al. is
a mixed-methods study of a group that normally only surfaces
anonymously in policy discussions, individuals who migrated
from Mexico to the U.S. and were subsequently deported back
to Mexico by the U.S. government. The study gives voice
to the perspective of deportees living in the border region,
separated from their families that remain in the U.S. Together
these studies demonstrate the vibrant new paths of studies of
migration and mental health,
increasing the breadth of the
ﬁeld by including new populations moving within and across
national borders and increasing in depth through sustained
attention to uniquely vulnerable subgroups and the consequences
of migration policies.
