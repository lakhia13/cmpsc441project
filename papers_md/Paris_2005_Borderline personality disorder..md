Borderline personality disorder

Abstract

BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER is a chronic psychiatric disorder
characterized by marked impulsivity, instability of mood and in-
terpersonal relationships, and suicidal behaviour that can compli-
cate medical care. Identifying this diagnosis is important for treat-
ment  planning.  Although  the  cause  of  borderline  personality
disorder  is  uncertain,  most  patients  improve  with  time.  There  is
an  evidence  base  for  treatment  using  both  psychotherapy  and
psychopharmacology.  The  clinical  challenge  centres  on  manag-
ing chronic suicidality.

Case
Colleen, a 22-year old student, is seen for a psychiatric assess-
ment after presenting to the emergency department because of
taking  an  overdose  of  acetaminophen  pills.  Although  the  im-
mediate precipitant to her suicide attempt was a break-up with
her  boyfriend,  she  has  a  history  of  multiple  suicide  attempts
since  the  age  of  14.  Colleen  reports  that  she  has  daily  mood
swings,  from  depression  to  intense  anger,  and  that  she  often
cuts herself on the wrists and arms to relieve dysphoria. When
stressed, she experiences feelings of unreality, sometimes hear-
ing  a  voice  telling  her  to  kill  herself.  Colleen  has  had  highly
problematic relationships with men, falling quickly in and out
of  love  and  feeling  that  her  life  depends  on  them,  even  when
they have behaved abusively toward her. What is the appropri-
ate diagnosis and management of this patient?

P ersonality disorders constitute a major group in the

classification  of  mental  disorders.  According  to  the
Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,
fourth  edition,  text  revision  (DSM-IV-TR),1 these  condi-
tions are defined by maladaptive personality characteristics
beginning early in life that have consistent and serious ef-
fects on functioning. Borderline personality disorder (BPD)
is  frequently  seen  in  clinical  practice.2 Characterized  by
emotional turmoil and chronic suicidality (suicide ideation
and  attempts),  this  type  of  personality  disorder  presents
some of the most difficult and troubling problems in all of
psychiatry.

Epidemiology

Epidemiologic studies of personality disorders are at an
early  stage  of  development.  Community  surveys  of  adults
have  indicated  that  the  prevalence  of  BPD  is  close  to  1%

(similar to that of schizophrenia).3,4 About 80% of patients
receiving therapy for BPD are women,2 but sex differences
are  less  striking  in  community  samples.4 As  is  the  case  for
personality  disorders  in  general,  BPD  is  associated  with
lower social class and lower levels of education.3,4

Causes: biological, psychological and social

We  are  only  beginning  to  understand  the  causes  of
BPD.  As  with  most  mental  disorders,  no  single  factor  ex-
plains  its  development,  and  multiple  factors  (biological,
psychological and social) all play a role.

The  biological  factors  in  personality  disorders  consist  of
temperamental (inborn or heritable) characteristics that pre-
sent  in  adulthood  as  stable  personality  traits:  patterns  of
thought,  affect  and  behaviour  that  characterize  individuals
and are stable over time.5 Heritable factors account for about
half  of  the  variability  in  virtually  all  traits  that  have  been
studied.6 Specifically, both affective instability6 and impulsiv-
ity7 have a heritable component of this magnitude, and stud-
ies involving twins have demonstrated that BPD itself shows
a similar genetic influence.8 Also, family history studies have
found that impulsive disorders such as antisocial personality
and  substance  abuse  are  particularly  common  among  first-
degree  relatives  of  patients  with  BPD.9 Studies  of  central
neurotransmitter activity have shown that impulsive traits, a
major  component  of  BPD,  are  associated  with  deficits  in
central serotonergic functioning.10,11 However, the biological
correlates of affective instability are unknown, and no mark-
ers specific to the overall disorder have been identified.10

The  psychological  factors  in  BPD  can  be  striking  but
are  not  consistent.  BPD  first  presents  clinically  in  adoles-
cence, at a mean age of 18 years.12 Although many patients
describe  adversities  such  as  family  dysfunction  as  well  as
mood and impulsive symptoms that go back to childhood,
longitudinal data are needed to determine the precise influ-
ence of early risk factors.13 Reports of a high frequency of
traumatic events during childhood in this population need
to take into account community studies, which show exten-
sive resilience following trauma, particularly for less severe
adversities.13 The  most  careful  studies  have  shown  that  a
quarter of patients with BPD describe sexual abuse from a
caretaker14 and  that  about  a  third  report  severe  forms  of
abuse.15 However,  although  child  abuse  is  clearly  a  risk
factor,  it  is  not  specific  to  BPD.13 In  general,  adverse  life
events  are  not  consistently  pathogenic  by  themselves  but,
rather, produce sequelae in vulnerable populations.16

Social  factors  in  BPD  are  suggested  by  indirect  evi-
dence.  Thus  far,  there  have  been  no  cross-cultural  studies
of  BPD,  although  characteristic  symptoms  such  as  recur-
rent  suicide  attempts  are  less  common  in  traditional  soci-
eties, in which there is little change from one generation to
the next, but are on the increase in modern societies and in
societies undergoing rapid change.17

Clinical presentation and diagnosis

The  term  “borderline”  is  a  misnomer,  based  on  an  old
theory that this form of pathology lies on a border between
psychosis  and  neurosis.  Actually,  BPD  is  a  complex  syn-
drome  whose  central  features  are  instability  of  mood,  im-
pulse  control  and  interpersonal  relationships.2 Box  1 pre-
sents the DSM-IV-TR1 criteria, reorganized in relation to
these  basic  dimensions,  as  well  as  cognitive  symptoms.
Since  the  DSM-IV-TR  requires  only  5  of  9  criteria  to  be
present,  making  a  diagnosis  on  this  basis  leads  to  hetero-
geneity; more precise research definitions have been devel-
oped that require high scores for all 3 dimensions.18

Box 1: Diagnostic criteria of borderline personality
disorder*

Borderline personality disorder is defined as a pervasive pattern
of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image and
affects, and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood
and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by 5 or more
of the following symptoms:

Affective symptoms

(cid:127) Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood

(e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability or anxiety usually
lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days)

(cid:127) Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger
(e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent
physical fights)

(cid:127) Chronic feelings of emptiness

Impulsive symptoms

(cid:127) Recurrent suicidal behaviour, gestures or threats, or

self-mutilating behaviour

(cid:127) Impulsivity in at least 2 areas that are potentially

self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse,
reckless driving, binge eating)

(cid:127) A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships

characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization
and devaluation

Interpersonal symptoms

(cid:127) Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment

(cid:127) Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable

self-image or sense of self

Cognitive symptoms

(cid:127) Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe

dissociative symptoms

*Based on DSM-IV-TR criteria1 and reorganized in relation to basic trait dimensions.

The  affective  symptoms  in  BPD  involve  rapid  mood
shifts,  in  which  emotional  states  tend  to  last  only  a  few
hours.19 When  affective  instability  is  monitored  with  stan-
dardized  instruments,20 emotions  are  found  to  be  intense
but  reactive  to  external  circumstances,  with  a  strong  ten-
dency toward angry outbursts. Levels of affective instability
are  most  predictive  of  suicide  attempts.21 Impulsive  symp-
toms include a wide range of behaviours and are central to
diagnosis.22 The  combination  of  affective  instability  with
impulsivity  in  BPD23 helps  account  for  a  clinical  pres-
entation marked by chronic suicidality and by instability of
interpersonal  relationships.23 Finally,  cognitive  symptoms
are also frequent. In one case series,24 about 40% of 50 pa-
tients  with  BPD  had  quasi-psychotic  thoughts.  In  another
series,25 27% of 92 patients experienced psychotic episodes.
In a third series,26 psychotic symptoms were found to pre-
dict self-harm in patients with personality disorders.

BPD  is  common  in  practice.  A  recent  study  involving
patients  in  an  emergency  department  who  had  attempted
suicide showed that 41% of those with a history of multiple
suicide  attempts  met  the  criteria  for  BPD  this  disorder.27
However, many cases are also seen in primary care settings.
Data from a survey conducted in a US urban primary care
practice indicated that BPD was present in 6.4% of a sam-
ple of 218 patients.28

Because  of  the  wide  range  of  symptoms  seen  in  BPD
that  are  also  typical  of  other  disorders  (Table  1),  such  as
mood  and  anxiety  disorders,  substance  abuse  and  eating
disorders,29 patients may be felt to have one of these condi-
tions  while  their  BPD  goes  undetected.  The  most  com-
mon  disorder  associated  with  BPD  is  depression,  but  in
BPD, symptoms are usually associated with mood instabil-
ity  rather  than  with  the  extended  and  continuous  periods
of  lower  mood  seen  in  classic  mood  disorders.19 Also,  be-
cause  of  characteristic  mood  swings,  BPD  is  often  mis-
taken  for  bipolar  disorder.30 However,  patients  with  BPD
do  not  show  continuously  elevated  mood  but  instead  ex-
hibit a pattern of rapid shifts in affect related to environ-
mental  events,  with  “high”  periods  that  last  for  hours
rather than for days or weeks.30 BPD may be mistaken for
schizophrenia;  however,  instead  of  long-term  psychotic
symptoms,  patients  with  BPD  experience  “micropsy-
chotic”  phenomena  of  short  duration  (lasting  hours  or  at
most  a  few  days),  auditory  hallucinations  without  loss  of
insight (patients with schizophrenia do not recognize that
a  hallucination  is  imaginary,  whereas  patients  with  BPD
do), paranoid trends and depersonalization states in which
patients experience themselves or their environment as un-
real.24 Finally,  patients  with  BPD  are  at  increased  risk  of
substance abuse, which forms part of the clinical picture of
widespread impulsivity.2

To diagnose BPD in practice, clinicians must first estab-
lish  whether  a  patient  has  the  overall  characteristics  of  a
personality disorder described in the DSM-IV-TR;1 that is,
long-term  problems  affecting  cognition,  mood,  interper-
sonal  functioning  and  impulse  control  that  begin  early  in

Borderline personality disorder

life  and  are  associated  with  maladaptive  personality  traits,
such  as  neuroticism  (being  easily  prone  to  anxiety  or  de-
pression, or both) or impulsivity. Personality disorders can
often  account  better  for  the  multiplicity  and  chronicity  of
symptoms than can alternative diagnoses such as mood or
anxiety disorders.

The next step is a personality assessment, which requires
a  good  history.  Although  practitioners  will  be  able  to  ob-
tain needed information from most patients during a rou-
tine visit, they may also, with the patient’s consent, wish to
speak to family members or friends. 

The final step is to determine the category that best fits
the  clinical  picture.  To  diagnose  BPD,  clinicians  need  to
establish  that  patterns  of  affective  instability,  impulsivity
and unstable relationships have been consistent over time.

Natural course and prognosis

Managing  patients  with  BPD  can  be  burdensome  for
clinicians because they may have to deal with repeated sui-
cide  threats  and  attempts  over  years.  Also,  patients  with
BPD  do  not  easily  respect  boundaries  and  may  become
overly attached to their therapists.31 When practitioners fail
to  diagnose  BPD,  they  may  be  at  risk  of  becoming  over-
involved  with  patients  who  suffer  greatly  but  can  be  per-
sonally appealing to the physicians.

Fortunately,  most  patients  with  BPD  improve  with
time.32–34 About  75%  will  regain  close  to  normal  function-
ing by the age of 35 to 40 years, and 90% will recover by
the age of 50.32 Unfortunately, about 1 in 10 patients even-
tually succeeds in committing suicide.35 However, this out-
come  is  difficult  to  predict,  and  90%  of  patients  improve
despite having threatened to end their lives on multiple oc-
casions.  The  mechanism  of  recovery  in  BPD  is  not  fully
understood,  but  impulsivity  generally  decreases  with  age,
and  patients  learn  over  time  how  to  avoid  the  situations
that give them the most trouble (e.g., intense love affairs),
finding stable niches that provide the structure they need.35

Management

BPD is a therapeutic challenge. A series of randomized
controlled  trials  of  pharmacotherapy  and  psychother-
apy36–47,50,52–54 have been published; however, the trials had a
number  of  defects,  most  particularly  small  samples,  attri-
tion and durations that were too short (usually 8–12 weeks)
for a chronic disorder that can last for years (a summary of
the trial results is available in an online table at www.cmaj
.ca/cgi/content/full/172/12/1579/DC1).  Finally,  outcomes
in these studies were generally measured by self-report and
did  not  indicate  whether  the  clinical  picture  had  actually
shown full remission. 

The pharmacologic treatment of BPD remains limited
in  scope.  By  and  large,  the  result  can  be  described  as  a
mild  degree  of  symptom  relief.  A  number  of  agents,  in-
cluding low-dose atypical neuroleptics,38 specific serotonin
reuptake inhibitors39,41–43 and mood stabilizers,44,45 all allevi-
ate  impulsive  symptoms.  However,  antidepressants  are
much  less  effective  for  mood  symptoms  in  BPD  patients
than in patients without a personality disorder.48 Benzodi-
azepines are not very useful in BPD and carry some dan-
ger of abuse.49

Thus,  although  several  drugs  “take  the  edge  off”  symp-
toms, they do not produce remission of BPD. Failure to un-
derstand  this  point  has  led  to  polypharmacy  regimens,  on
the assumption that multiple drugs are needed to target all
aspects of the disorder. The result is that many patients re-
ceive 4–5 agents — with all their attendant side effects12 —
in the absence of evidence from clinical trials supporting the
efficacy of such combinations. Future research may lead to
the  development  of  agents  more  specific  to  the  symptoms
seen in BPD.

The mainstay of treatment for BPD is still psychother-
apy.  Dialectical  behaviour  therapy  is  a  form  of  cognitive
behavioural therapy that targets affective instability and im-
pulsivity,  using  group  and  individual  sessions  to  teach  pa-
tients how to regulate their emotions. This form of behav-

iour therapy has been shown to be effective in bringing sui-
cidal behaviours under control within a year.50–53 However,
whether  this  method  is  effective  in  the  long  term  is  un-
known.  There  is  evidence  from  a  randomized  controlled
trial  supporting  the  use  of  a  modified  form  of  psychoana-
lytic therapy in a day-treatment setting that also makes us
of cognitive techniques.54

Unfortunately,  these  forms  of  psychotherapy  for  BPD
are  expensive  in  terms  of  resources  and  are  not  generally
available. In practice, therapy tends to be practical and sup-
portive. Practitioners who manage these cases can also use
educational materials for patients and their families.31

Managing suicidality

The  main  problem  that  practitioners  face  in  managing
cases  of  BPD  is  chronic  suicidality.  Physicians  in  primary
care  settings  are  prepared  to  care  for  many  patients  with
psychotic  disorders  but  are  likely  to  ask  psychiatrists  to
manage patients who make repeated suicide threats and at-
tempts,  or  to  suggest  hospital  admission.  However,  there
has been little research on the effectiveness of hospitaliza-
tion for the treatment of BPD and no evidence that it pre-
vents completion of suicide.55

Suicidality in BPD peaks when patients are in their early
20s, but completed suicide is most common after 3035 and
usually occurs in patients who fail to recover after many at-
tempts  at  treatment.  In  contrast,  suicidal  actions  such  as
impulsive  overdoses,  most  often  seen  in  younger  patients,
do not usually carry a high short-term risk and function to
communicate  distress.56 Self-mutilating  behaviours  such  as
chronic  cutting,  often  referred  to  as  “suicidal,”  are  prob-
lematic  but  are  not  associated  with  suicidal  intent  and  in-
stead serve to regulate dysphoric emotional states.56 Practi-
tioners  should  move  beyond  their  concerns  about  these
patients  and  instead  concentrate  on  managing  symptoms
and  the  life  problems  that  exacerbate  suicidal  thoughts  or
behaviours.

Conclusions

The  majority  of  patients  with  BPD  are  seen  in  psychi-
atric clinics or in primary care. The keys to successful man-
agement include making an accurate diagnosis, maintaining
a  supportive  relationship  with  the  patient  and  establishing
limited goals. Although BPD may persist for years, it does
not last forever, and one can be reasonably optimistic that
most  patients  will  recover  with  time.  Psychotherapy  can
help  speed  up  this  process.  The  most  effective  forms  of
treatment  have  been  developed  by  psychologists,  and
therefore  when  making  a  referral,  physicians  should  con-
sider a patient’s ability to pay for such therapy.

More  research  into  the  causes  of  BPD  is  needed,  the
results  of  which  may  help  to  develop  evidence-based  ap-
proaches  to  treatment  that  are  practical  and  specifically
designed for this challenging disorder.

The case revisited

Colleen’s symptoms clearly meet the diagnostic criteria
for BPD (mood swings, impulsivity, suicidality, unstable re-
lationships and micropsychotic phenomena), a clinical pic-
ture that could not readily be accounted for by a diagnosis
of depression alone. Her family physician talks to her about
the disorder and refers her to a psychiatrist to confirm the
diagnosis.  Colleen  is  seen  for  weekly  psychotherapy  ses-
sions over the next 6 months by a psychologist at her uni-
versity student health service, who applies established prin-
ciples of management for this condition.31 In addition, her
family  physician  prescribes  a  selective  serotonin  reuptake
inhibitor  to  help  control  her  impulsivity  to  a  point  where
she stops cutting herself.
