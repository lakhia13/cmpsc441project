Reﬂecting this complicated history, there has been con-

trajectories. Diagnosis remains based on observation of
atypical behaviors, with criteria of persistent deﬁcits in
social communication and restricted and repetitive patterns
of behavior. This review provides a broad overview of the

that evaluate therapeutic efﬁcacy in ASD populations.
Finally, we discuss the potential of a new wave of research
examining objective biomarkers to facilitate the evaluation
of sub-typing, diagnosis, and treatment response in ASD.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are complex, pervasive,
and multifactorial neurodevelopmental conditions. Obser-
vation of aberrant behavior forms the basis of diagnosis,
with criteria focused on impairments in social communi-
cation and interaction, and restricted, repetitive patterns of
behavior, interests, or activities [1]. Heterogeneity of pre-
sentation is a hallmark [2–4] with comorbid psychiatric and
medical morbidities frequently reported. Commonly iden-
tiﬁed psychiatric and cognitive comorbidities with ASD
include social anxiety disorder, oppositional deﬁant disor-
der, attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder, and intellec-
tual disability [5–7]. Medical
frequently
reported include immune system abnormalities, gastroin-
testinal disorder, mitochondrial dysfunction, sleep disor-
ders, and epilepsy [8–10].

conditions

The substantial direct and indirect effects of ASDs extend
across many different sectors including health, education,
social care, housing, employment, welfare beneﬁts, and
labor markets, with a high economic burden extending to
adulthood and often carried by families [11, 12]. With
forecasts of annual direct medical, non-medical, and pro-
ductivity costs projected to reach close to $US 500 billion by
2025 in the United States alone [13], the importance of
adequate care, support structures for affected individuals and
their families, and efﬁcacious treatments to improve func-
tioning and outcomes cannot be underestimated.

In 1943, Leo Kanner published a report entitled ‘‘Autistic
disturbances of affective contact’’, detailing eleven case
studies of children (eight males and three females) aged

123

from 2 years and 4 months to 11 years who had presented
to his clinics [14]. Kanner described observations of these
children as having an extreme inability to relate to others
that appeared to be present throughout infancy. Kanner
drew a distinction between this syndrome and that of
‘‘childhood schizophrenia’’ based on the time of onset, as
childhood schizophrenia was explained as withdrawal fol-
lowing typical development. Along with this desire for
aloneness, Kanner also observed unusual language devel-
opment, with an aptitude for nouns and learning nursery
rhymes, a failure to develop the communicative aspects of
speech, a tendency to show echolalia, and a tendency to
interpret things literally, along with sensory sensitivities
and repetitive behaviors.

In 1944, Hans Asperger published a paper describing
what he termed ‘‘autistic psychopathy’’. This paper
described children who primarily had difﬁculties with non-
verbal communication and related social skills. This paper
would eventually be considered as important as Kanner’s
work in the development of the concept of autism, since the
core symptoms were the same as those identiﬁed by Kan-
ner but in higher-functioning individuals [15, 16]. As it was
published in Germany,
in German, during the Second
World War, it was not widely read and did not enter the
English-speaking medical community until the 1970s [17].
In 1981, Lorna Wing provided a history of the syndrome
proposed by Asperger, though she renamed it ‘‘Asperger
syndrome’’ to remove the connotations of ‘‘psychopathy’’
[17]. She acknowledges in her introduction the similarities
between the criteria proposed by Kanner and Asperger,
noting ‘‘the argument continues as to whether they are
varieties of
the same underlying abnormality’’. Wing
described and reﬁned Asperger’s initial diagnostic criteria,
and highlighted the continuum in criteria ranging from the
lower functioning ‘‘Kanner’s autism’’ to ‘‘Asperger’s syn-
drome’’ to typically-developing individuals, who display
some of the criteria of Asperger’s syndrome [17].

Infantile autism as an endorsed medical diagnosis ﬁrst
appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, third edition (DSM-III) [18], and described a
subgroup of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) [19].
The criteria outlined for Infantile Autism required an onset
prior to the age of 30 months, a failure of responsiveness to
others, gross deﬁcits in language development, and bizarre
responses to environmental stimuli, with an absence of
schizophrenic symptoms. The criteria were broadened in
the DSM-III-R to recognize the pervasive nature of the
disorder and that it was not limited to infants, as the criteria
for Infantile Autism excluded a subgroup of higher-func-
tioning individuals who displayed the deﬁcits described but
did not evidence the symptoms early enough in life to
receive the diagnosis. The revision of Infantile Autism to
Autistic Disorder in the DSM-III-R recognized the broader

123

spectrum of functioning with 8 out of 16 possible criteria
required for diagnosis. The age of onset was speciﬁed as
either during infancy or early childhood, with a childhood
onset speciﬁer (after 36 months). These criteria allowed for
the identiﬁcation of potentially less-impaired individuals to
receive a diagnosis [20].

The DSM-IV was released in 1994 with criteria similar
to the DSM-III-R for the diagnosis of Autistic Disorder,
though the childhood onset speciﬁer was removed as onset
before 36 months of age was required. The DSM-IV
introduced a formal set of criteria for Asperger’s Syndrome
using some of the criteria outlined by Wing [17]. The
criteria for Asperger’s Syndrome described a condition
with impairments in social interaction, communication, and
imagination, similar to that described by the Autistic
Disorder criteria, but without the impairments in language
or cognition [21].

The move to the DSM-5 was marked by broadening of
the deﬁnition and reduction in the speciﬁcity of autism-
related symptoms [1], heralding substantial changes to the
diagnostic criteria. Diagnoses of Autistic Disorder, Asper-
ger’s Syndrome and Pervasive Developmental Disorder—
Not Otherwise Speciﬁed (PDD-NOS), were removed as
diagnostic classiﬁcations and collapsed into two diagnoses,
Autism Spectrum Disorder and Social Communication
Disorder. This latest modiﬁcation reﬂected growing con-
cerns about the validity of the Asperger’s diagnosis, given
evidence that it was frequently interchanged across time
with Autistic Disorder [22]. Individuals who would have
previously received a diagnosis of Asperger’s Syndrome
were generally thought to receive a diagnosis of ‘‘Autism
Spectrum Disorder without language or cognitive impair-
ment’’ (DSM-5). The current DSM-5 criteria for Autism
Spectrum Disorder are listed in Table 1, with speciﬁers for
current severity summarized in Table 2 [1]. For DSM-5,
Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SCD) was
introduced and required persistent difﬁculties in the social
use of verbal and nonverbal communication, without
impairments relating to restricted, repetitive behavior. It is
expected that those who were previously diagnosed as
PDD-NOS, and do not meet the DSM-5 Autism Spectrum
Disorder criteria, would be more frequently diagnosed with
SCD [23]. The new criteria were expected to enable greater
standardization of diagnosis. Previously, a multisite obser-
vational study revealed signiﬁcant variation in clinical
diagnoses of speciﬁc ASDs, despite similar distributions of
scores on standardized measures across sites, supporting the
transition from the subgroupings used in DSM-IV to the
current dimensional descriptors of the core features of
social communication and interaction, and restricted,
repetitive behaviors [24]. With the release of DSM-5, it is
clear that many of the debates initiated by Kanner’s,
Asperger’s, and Lorna Wing’s work remain. There

continues to be great debate about the number of different
diagnoses with the term Autism Spectrum Disorder, the lack
of clarity over the relationship between functioning levels
of autism and impaired cognitive function, and the diag-
nostic relevance and need for treatment for those individ-
uals who appear to show higher levels of occupational and
intellectual functions.

The diagnostic criteria discussed above have been
developed primarily with Western participants. Even
though it is regarded as heavily inﬂuenced by biological

factors and a developmental condition,
recently highlighted that social and cultural factors inﬂu-
ence diagnostic rates and the cultural acceptability of the
tools used to make the diagnoses [25]. For instance, in the
United States, general developmental delays or impaired
language skills are common symptoms that result in a
diagnosis [25]. Given that the diagnosis is based on social
and contextual observations, it is not surprising that phe-
notypes and tools do not transfer as easily to other cultures.
For example,
language may not be typically
incorporated in the diagnostic criteria as boys acquire
language skills later than girls [26]. In many Asian cul-
tures, direct eye contact with elders is viewed as a sign of
disrespect, thus the reduced eye-contact as a diagnostic
feature may be seen a less atypical in these cultures [25].

in India,

There is an important need for a growing body of research
addressing these cross-cultural factors in the diagnosis of
ASD [25, 27]. Perhaps this research will highlight the
universal features of autism that reduce the inﬂuence of
contextual factors in the diagnostic criteria.

The prevalence of ASDs has, however, been increasing.
In Asia, the average prevalence before 1980 was *1.9
cases per 10,000, rising to 14.8 between 1980 and 2010
[28]. A review of epidemiological studies published
between 1996 and 2001, and conducted in the United
Kingdom, United States and in Scandinavia and Japan,
indicated that the prevalence was likely to be within the
range of 30–60 cases per 10,000 [29]. More recent esti-
mates are as high as 1 in 68, based on 8-year old children in
the United States [30]. However, a combination of the
broadening of diagnostic criteria previously discussed, and
the methodology employed in epidemiologic surveys,
including changes in the assessment process, response
rates, and differences in sample size, publication year, and
geographic location, suggests that it may not be informa-
tive to estimate trends over time [31]. Increases in preva-
lence estimates may represent changes in the concepts,
deﬁnitions, service availability, and awareness of ASDs in
both the lay and professional public [32]. While a recent

differences in prevalence across geographic regions or
variability based on ethnicity or socioeconomic factors, the
paucity of comprehensive datasets
from low-income
countries impacts the ability to detect these effects [33].
Consequently,
any disproportionate
impact of environmental factors on prevalence relating to
speciﬁc regions are difﬁcult to characterize and the global
burden of ASD is difﬁcult to quantify.

investigations of

The etiology of ASD is commonly described as a
genetic predisposition combined with an environmental
impact [34]. The body of research identifying genetic
deletions and duplications, inherited and de novo, and rare
and common variants in ASD is expansive. Evidence for
genetic variants in the etiology of ASD includes genes
involved in intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric
disorder, common pathway genes and ASD-risk genes,
multigenic contributions from rare or common variations,
DNA mutations, and environmental effects on gene
expression and/or protein function [35]. Rare genetic risk
factors,
including those resulting in ASD-related syn-
dromes (e.g. Fragile X), chromosomal abnormalities, and
penetrant genes are estimated to contribute to *20% of
ASDs [35]. At least 5% of non-syndromic, idiopathic, and
primarily simplex ASD are caused by de novo copy-num-
ber variants [36]. It is estimated that 400–1000 genes are
likely to lead to a susceptibility to autism [37, 38]. Genetic
inﬂuences are thought to converge on a smaller number of
key pathways and developmental stages of the brain [39].
Despite the extensive research in this ﬁeld, the genetic
least 70% of cases of ASD remains
etiology for at
unknown [36]. Pre-, neo-, and post-natal environmental
risk factors have also been implicated [40, 41]. For
example, deﬁcits in social interaction and language and the
presence of restricted and stereotyped patterns of behavior
have all been demonstrated in a mouse model of maternal

infection, considered a prenatal environmental risk factor
for autism [42]. Decreased levels of neurotrophic factors,
which support the growth, survival, and differentiation of
developing and mature neurons, have been identiﬁed as an
environment risk in the neonatal period [43]. In addition,
during the postnatal period, it has been proposed that a
vulnerable physiology may be particularly susceptible to
environmental
inﬂuences [44], such as the burden of
organic pollutants which has been found to be associated
with the severity of autism-related symptoms [45]. It is also
thought
interactions may be
involved in the etiology of ASD, although the evidence to
date is derived predominantly from animal models [46].

Symptomatology, Clinical Presentation,
and Severity

The symptomatology of ASD is extensive and pervasive
with a variable onset that could be considered a dimen-
sional process [47]. While ASD is considered a lifelong
condition [48], there are a range of prognoses with the
recent identiﬁcation of an optimal outcome whereby chil-
dren previously diagnosed with an ASD were no longer
considered to meet the diagnostic criteria [49]. The iden-
tiﬁcation of this outcome challenges the concept that ASD
phenotypes are stable and insensitive to treatment and
suggests that developmental trajectories can diverge sig-
niﬁcantly [50]. The classiﬁcation of ASD severity is based
on the required levels of support to assist with impairments

in social communication and social
restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior,

concerns that conceptualizations of severity based on
required levels of support could result in inconsistencies

when there are mixed levels of impairment across cogni-
tive, adaptive, and autism-related symptoms and result in
site-speciﬁc applications of ASD categories [51]. Symp-
toms associated with ASD range from slight to profound
impairment where deﬁcits can impair all daily living
functions. The severity of symptoms increases when
demands in certain environments exceed the individual’s
capacity to function at a required level. The spectrum of
need in terms of supports and services can be vast, with the
ability to function across skill areas required for daily
living and across the lifespan often independent of the
severity of autistic symptoms. The difﬁculties associated
with the accurate assessment of functioning, an important
factor in understanding the impact of severity on outcomes,
is currently being addressed with the development of the
International Classiﬁcation of Functioning, Disability and
Health core sets for ASD [52]. The core set is a shortlist of
categories selected to encompass aspects of functioning
most relevant when describing a person with ASD.

Interestingly, the onset of ASD symptoms has been a
focus of research that has identiﬁed an early onset pattern
and a regressive onset pattern in which children appear to
develop typically before losing skills and developing aut-
ism-like symptoms [53]. However, in-depth review of these
conceptualizations concludes that the onset of ASD, or
symptom emergence, is better considered a dimensional
process and a continuum in which the early onset and
regression patterns describe two extremes [47].

Heterogeneity

Heterogeneity in etiology, phenotype, and outcome are hall-
marks of ASD. These factors contribute to a clinical hetero-
geneity which manifest as diverse deﬁcits or impairments in
behavioral features and communicative functioning. The
marked heterogeneity of ASDs has led to suggestions that
rather than a single disorder, it could be constructive to
reframe ASDs as ‘the autisms’, thereby giving consideration
to multiple etiologies and distinct clinical entities [54]. The
heterogeneity of clinical entities is in part a function of the
multiple genes involved, the myriad of environmental factors
impacting the developmental course of symptom expression,
and the co-occurrence of medical and mental health dys-
functions in ASDs. Heterogeneity complicates the quest for
personalized medicine in ASD. Three factors contributing to
the heterogeneity of ASD, genetic variability, comorbidity,
and gender, are now considered.

Genetic Variation in ASD

Genetic variability is considered a major contributor to the
heterogeneity of ASD. High-throughput genomic methods

are rapidly increasing the pool of ASD genes and in doing
so expanding the genetic variability associated with ASD
heterogeneity [55]. Large datasets have not identiﬁed sig-
niﬁcant genome-wide associations with speciﬁc common
variants, and associated analyses suggest
that common
variants exert weak effects on the risk for ASD [56]. The
genetic architecture in ASD varies substantially, from a
single penetrant mutation being enough to cause ASD, to
an accumulation of over one thousand low-risk alleles [57].
Rare variants affecting ASD risk collectively encompass
hundreds of genes [58], while copy-number variant data
and de novo protein-altering mutations suggest extreme
locus heterogeneity [59]. Furthermore, the combined effect
of common low-impact genetic variants has also been
associated with ASD [60]. Large numbers of genes impli-
cated in ASD are thought to converge on common path-
ways affecting neuronal and synaptic homeostasis [61], and
play critical roles in fundamental developmental pathways
[39, 59]. For example, mutation of a single copy of
SHANK3, a synaptic scaffolding protein, has been asso-
ciated with language and social communication impair-
ment in individuals with ASD [62]. In contrast, pleiotropic
effects have been identiﬁed whereby the same deleterious
genetic variant increases the risk for ASD and other neu-
ropsychiatric syndromes [63, 64]. Finally, ﬁndings from
pathway network analyses of gene ontologies suggest that,
in addition to contributing to the core features of ASD,
associated genes may contribute to vulnerabilities in
important molecular mechanisms leading to multiple sys-
temic comorbidities that also overlap with other conditions
[65].

Comorbidity in ASD

Characterizing the heterogeneity of ASD is further com-
plicated by the occurrence of comorbidities. A recent study
described comorbidities of [ 14,000 participants with an
ASD and highlighted the burden of comorbidity across
multiple health care
[66]. Comorbid psy-
systems
chopathologies
signiﬁcantly over-represented in ASD
include anxiety [67], depression [68], ADHD [69], and
intellectual disability [5, 7]; and medical comorbidities
include seizures [70], sleep difﬁculties [71], gastrointesti-
nal disorders [72], mitochondrial dysfunction [73], and
immune system abnormalities [74].

The presence of one or more of these comorbidities is
likely to be associated with more severe autism-related
symptoms. For example, 11%–39% of individuals with
ASD also have epilepsy and these individuals are more
likely to have severe social impairments than those diag-
nosed with ASD only [75]. Comorbid sleep disturbance is
indicated in 50%–80% of children with ASD and is cor-
[76, 77].
related with daytime problem behaviors

123

188

Neurosci. Bull. April, 2017, 33(2):183–193

Furthermore, sleep problems exacerbate the severity of
core ASD symptoms [78, 79] and sleep disturbance is
associated with behavioral dysregulation in children with
ASD [80]. Aberrant behaviors are correlated with gas-
trointestinal problems in young children with ASD [81],
and markers of mitochondrial dysfunction are signiﬁcantly
correlated with autism severity [73]. The role of immune
system abnormalities in ASD is a signiﬁcant focus of
ongoing research. Altered immunity involving cytokines,
inﬂammation, cellular activation, and
immunoglobulins,
autoimmunity have all been implicated in ASD [82]. Fur-
thermore, altered levels of cytokines have been associated
with the severity of behavioral impairments [83–85]. There
is limited characterization of these associations between
comorbidities in general and the severity of autism-related
symptoms due to the complex nature of these relationships.
For example, it has been proposed that precise characteri-
zation of the immune system’s role in the biology of autism
requires an understanding of whether these relationships
underlie the pathophysiology of ASD in a causative way,
whether they create vulnerabilities to other causative fac-
tors such as pathogens, or whether a third factor underlies
the pathology of ASD and the aberrant immune response in
ASD [86]. Improved characterization of comorbidities is
imperative for
the development of a comprehensive
understanding of ASD heterogeneity and may lead to the
identiﬁcation of distinct subgroups of ASD and subgroup-
speciﬁc treatments [87].

Gender

identiﬁed and there may be a gender bias in the diagnostic
criteria [93]. A large-scale study has found that females
had greater impairments than males, presenting with more
social communication and interaction symptoms,
lower
cognitive and language abilities, poorer adaptive function,
and increased externalizing behavior and irritability, sug-
gesting that females require more severe symptoms to be
diagnosed as ASD [94]. However, females with ASD have
been identiﬁed as having fewer repetitive behaviors than
impairments in social and
males [95], but equivalent
communication skills [96].

There is an increased risk of ASD for a child with an
older sibling who has been diagnosed with the condition.
Previous investigations have estimated the recurrence risk
to be between 3% and 18.7% [97]. Predictors of an ASD
diagnosis in a younger sibling include male gender of the
infant and the number of affected older siblings. In a large
sample using a prospective design, the recurrence rate for
multiplex families has been reported at 32.2% [97]. In a
more recent and larger retrospective study, a 14-fold
increase in ASD risk in younger siblings was found to be
comparable across gestational age at birth and the child’s
ethnicity, with the risk higher for younger boys regardless
of the gender of the older sibling with ASD [98]. A higher
recurrence risk has been identiﬁed in families with at least
one affected female proband compared to families with
only male probands, suggesting female protective mecha-
nisms may be operating in families with high genetic
recurrence risk rates [99].

The male bias in ASD prevalence is most frequently
reported as 4 males diagnosed to every 1 female [32, 88].
Intellectual functioning and sex-differential genetic and
hormonal factors may modify this ratio [88]. Many theories
have been proposed to explain the gender distribution,
including the ‘‘extreme male brain’’ theory [89, 90]. The
basis of this theory is that a normal male cognitive proﬁle
encompasses individuals who are better at systemizing (the
drive to analyze or construct systems) than empathizing,
and that autism can be considered an extreme of the normal
male proﬁle. A potential mechanism for this theory is an
elevation of fetal sex steroids, which is supported by a
recent study reporting that amniotic ﬂuid steroid hormones
were elevated in males who later were diagnosed with ASD
[91]. However, in recent times a ‘female protective model’
has been proposed based on genetic studies. For example, a
recent DNA study showed that girls display resilience to
genetic insults in that they are more likely to have more
extreme neurodevelopmentally related genetic mutations,
including both copy-number variants and single-nucleotide
variants, than males presenting with the same symptoms
[92]. An alternative perspective is that females are under-

Treatment Options in ASD

Despite signiﬁcant economic and societal costs, there are
limited treatment options to ameliorate the symptoms
associated with ASDs, including both symptoms related to
diagnostic criteria and those that are considered to be a
function of comorbid mental and medical conditions
known to exacerbate the severity of presentation. While
there are promising indications for new medical treatments
for autism [100], a recent systematic review found that
while many children with ASDs are treated with medical
interventions, there is minimal evidence to support the
beneﬁt of most
treatments [101]. There are numerous
challenges for the identiﬁcation of effective treatments for

tural differences, including what may be considered devi-
ations from typical behavior in a particular culture but not
in another culture, further complicate the quest for treat-
ment options across the ASD population [103]. In addition,
up to 30% of child ASD participants may respond to pla-
cebo treatments [104], which could contribute to reduced
active intervention effect sizes.

for

risperidone and aripiprazole,

Behavioral interventions undertaken early in life, using
an intensive delivery format, are considered the current
gold-standard treatment for behavioral symptoms associ-
ated with ASDs [105]. However, methodologically weak
studies with few participants and short-term follow-ups are
common in this ﬁeld [106, 107]. Furthermore, early
intensive behavioral interventions are expensive to imple-
ment and require extensive resources to execute effec-
tively, making them inaccessible for many children with
ASD and their families. Alternatively, only two pharma-
ceuticals are approved by the US Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA),
the
treatment of symptoms associated with ASD. Risperidone,
an adult antipsychotic, was approved in 2006 for the
symptomatic treatment of irritability, including aggression,
deliberate self-injury, and tantrums, in autistic children and
adolescents. Risperidone, which acts by blocking the
brain’s receptors for dopamine and serotonin, was found to
be safe and effective for short-term treatment, with
improvements observed in stereotypic behavior and
hyperactivity [108]. However, signiﬁcant side-effects are
associated with risperidone use, including weight gain from
increased appetite, drowsiness, and increased levels of the
hormone prolactin, which is produced by the pituitary
gland and which can have a feminizing effect on both
females and males [109]. The frequency of side-effects
appears to be dose-related [110], and while weight gain is
common, somnolence more signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the
discontinuation of treatment [111]. In 2009, following
evaluation of short-term efﬁcacy and safety, the FDA also
approved aripiprazole, a third-generation atypical antipsy-
chotic, for the treatment of irritability associated with ASD
in children and adolescents [112, 113]. Adverse events
increased appetite,
include sedation, fatigue, vomiting,
somnolence, and tremor [114], with discontinuation com-
monly due to aggression and weight gain [112]. Aripipra-
zole is known as a dopamine system stabilizer and is less
likely to elevate serum prolactin levels and induce
extrapyramidal symptoms than risperidone [115].

inherent heterogeneity in ASD is crucial in order to facil-
itate the identiﬁcation of well-characterized subgroups.

cal comorbidities associated with ASD such as immune

The treatment response in randomized controlled trials
for ASDs continues to be primarily based on the observa-
tion of clinically relevant behaviors. Focusing entirely on
behaviorally-deﬁned diagnostic criteria and response to
two-dimensional phenomenological
treatment
approach to ASDs. The multi-dimensional aspects of pre-
sentation are increasingly recognized as aberrations in the
biological pathways at the molecular and cellular levels,
with alterations in circuitry linked to behavior [121, 122].
Furthermore, the limitations of the clinician paradigm as a
standard for the diagnosis of ASD [24] support a move
beyond this historical model to one increasingly guided by
there has
biological measurement [123]. Concurrently,
been a greater focus on the importance of objective rather
than subjective indicators of response, such as biomarkers,
and the possibility of biological signatures contributing to
the deﬁnition of ASD subgroups [123, 124]. Genomics,
neuroimaging, and pathophysiological markers relating to
mitochondrial
function, oxidative stress, and immune
function all offer potential as biomarkers to reduce the
diagnostic heterogeneity and improve the prediction of
treatment response [125].

The initiation of the Research Domain Criteria project
by the National Institute of Mental Health also supports
this paradigm-shift towards a diagnostic system founded on
a deeper understanding of the biological and psychosocial
bases of psychiatric disorders, and the requirement for
research across multiple units of analysis including genes,
neural circuits, and behavior [126]. Whilst this objective is
still in the development phase it represents a shift towards
precision or personalized medicine based on etiology and
pathophysiology, which will hopefully ultimately parse out
the issues contributing to heterogeneity. A precision or
personalized medicine approach recognizes the importance
of aligning treatment and support, care, and services to
individual needs and outcomes. Individual outcomes drive
community outcomes which drive societal outcomes.

The heterogeneity of ASD has implications for the
assessment of treatment efﬁcacy [116]. The design of
treatment trials would beneﬁt from the selection of treat-
ment subgroups that maximize homogeneity in ways that
improve the detection of efﬁcacious interventions [87]. An
improved understanding of the biological basis of the

Conclusions

A concerning issue in ASD research, particularly for peo-
ple with ASD and their carers requiring support, is the
paucity of approved evidence-based treatment options

available to ameliorate the core and associated symptoms
of ASD. While the hallmark heterogeneity of ASDs may be
a major contributing factor,
impede an
understanding of ASD subgroups, associated markers of
pathological states, and cross-cultural
factors that are
imperative to advancing this ﬁeld of research. The diag-
nosis of ASDs continues to be entirely based on the
observation of behaviors, or what is externally visible.
However, there is now a greater recognition of complex
symptomatology including medical and mental health
comorbidities, due to the recent identiﬁcation of relation-
ships between comorbidities and the severity of autism-
related symptoms. The identiﬁcation of objective rather
than subjective measures of response, such as biomarkers,
and the possibility of biological signatures contributing to
the deﬁnition of subgroups of ASDs will advance the quest
for personalized medicine and treatment models in this
highly heterogeneous population.
