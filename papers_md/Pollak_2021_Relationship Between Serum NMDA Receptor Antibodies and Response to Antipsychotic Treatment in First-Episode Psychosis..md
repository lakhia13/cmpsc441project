ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: When psychosis develops in NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antibody encephalitis, it usually has an acute
or subacute onset, and antipsychotic treatment may be ineffective and associated with adverse effects. Serum
NMDAR antibodies have been reported in a minority of patients with ﬁrst-episode psychosis (FEP), but their role in
psychosis onset and response to antipsychotic treatment is unclear.
METHODS: Sera from 387 patients with FEP (duration of psychosis ,2 years, minimally or never treated with anti-
psychotics) undergoing initial treatment with amisulpride as part of the OPTiMiSE (Optimization of Treatment and
Management of Schizophrenia in Europe) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01248195) were tested for NMDAR IgG
antibodies using a live cell–based assay. Symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome
Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions Scale at baseline and again after 4 weeks of treatment with amisulpride.
RESULTS: At baseline, 15 patients were seropositive for NMDAR antibodies and 372 were seronegative. The
seropositive patients had similar symptom proﬁles and demographic features to seronegative patients but a shorter
duration of psychosis (median 1.5 vs. 4.0 months; p = .031). Eleven seropositive and 284 seronegative patients
completed 4 weeks of amisulpride treatment: after
there was no between-groups difference in
improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores or in the frequency of adverse medication effects.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that in FEP, NMDAR antibody seropositivity alone is not an indication for using
immunotherapy instead of antipsychotic medications. Further studies are required to establish what proportion of
patients with FEP who are NMDAR antibody seropositive have coexisting cerebrospinal ﬂuid inﬂammatory changes or
other paraclinical evidence suggestive of a likely beneﬁt from immunotherapy.

Serum NMDA receptor
(NMDAR) antibodies have been
inconsistently detected in a subgroup of patients with psy-
chosis, with the proportion varying (between 0% and 20%)
with the type of assay used and the nature of the patient
sample (1–4). The clinical signiﬁcance of NMDAR antibodies in
patients with psychotic disorders remains unclear. It has been
suggested that they may demarcate an autoimmune enceph-
alitis caught early or a forme fruste of autoimmune encephalitis
that has been misdiagnosed as a primary psychotic disorder.
However, NMDAR antibodies are also detectable in healthy
individuals, with some studies reporting similar rates to those
observed in patient populations (5).

If, in a subset of patients, psychosis is caused by NMDAR
antibodies, treatment with antipsychotic medication might not
be effective. Case reports and series of patients with NMDAR
antibody encephalitis have described a poor response to

encephalitis may be particularly sensitive to the adverse
effects of antipsychotic medication, such as pronounced
rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome
(6,7). However, the effectiveness and safety of antipsychotic
medication has yet to be examined in patients who have
NMDAR antibodies and present with psychosis in the absence
of encephalitis.

Typically, NMDAR antibody encephalitis has a subacute
onset, deﬁned as a rapid progression of symptoms of less than
3 months in duration (8). If NMDAR antibodies underlie the
onset of some cases of psychosis, one might therefore expect
a similarly rapid progression and, thus, shorter duration of
untreated psychosis before presentation to clinical services.
This hypothesis remains to be tested.

It has been suggested that immunotherapy may be indi-
cated as an alternative to antipsychotic medication in patients
with psychosis who are seropositive for NMDAR antibodies (9)
(and anecdotally, we have heard of such patients being offered

The main aims of this study were to examine the relationship
between serum NMDAR antibodies and 1) symptom proﬁle at
presentation and 2) response to antipsychotic treatment in a
large cohort of patients with ﬁrst-episode psychosis (FEP). We
tested the hypothesis that, compared with seronegative pa-
tients, seropositive patients would have 1) a shorter duration of
psychosis and 2) a poor therapeutic response but a greater
frequency of adverse effects.

METHODS AND MATERIALS

Subjects

We studied patients in OPTiMiSE (Optimization of Treatment and
Management of Schizophrenia in Europe; www.optimisetrial.eu),
a European Union–funded study of the management of FEP that
recruited patients between May 26, 2011, and May 15, 2016. Full
details of the trial have been reported elsewhere (13). Brieﬂy,
inclusion required that patients had a diagnosis of ﬁrst-episode
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform
psychosis and were either naïve to antipsychotic medication or
had received no more than 2 weeks of medication in the previ-
ous year or no more than 6 weeks in their lifetime. Inclusion also
required that the time between psychosis onset and study entry
was less than 2 years. Patients were excluded if there was any
suspicion of an organic etiology; they had a known intolerance to
one of the study drugs; they met any of the contraindications for
any of the study drugs as mentioned in the (local) package insert
texts; they were coercively treated or represented by a legal
guardian, or both, or under legal custody; or they were pregnant
or breastfeeding. Recruitment involved centers in the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Austria, Czech
Republic, Germany,
Italy, Poland, Spain, Australia,
Bulgaria, and Romania (Table S1).

This study was restricted to patients in whom serum had
been collected at presentation (n = 387 of 446). At baseline,
subjects completed a sociodemographic schedule, and
symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and
(14) and the Calgary
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) (15). Patients were
then treated with amisulpride following a standardized protocol
for 4 weeks (13). The duration of untreated psychosis was
estimated at baseline, using information from the patient, rel-
atives and caregivers, and clinical records. It was deﬁned as
the time (in months) between the onset of frank psychotic
symptoms to the baseline assessment. At 4 weeks, clinical
response to amisulpride was assessed using the PANSS,
CDSS, and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scale (16).
Adverse effects of treatment were assessed using the Udvalg
for Kliniske Undersogelser side effect
rating scale (17).
Remission was deﬁned according to the criteria by Andreasen
et al. (18), according to which 8 speciﬁc symptoms (PANSS

Immunoassays

Serum samples were tested for NMDAR IgG antibodies using a
live cell–based assay as described above (4). A live cell–based
assay was used because we found that this had greater
sensitivity than a ﬁxed cell–based assay, detecting sevenfold
more positive samples, which all nonetheless showed on sin-
gle nanoparticle imaging a signature strongly indicative of
binding to the NMDAR (4).

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 23;
IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Demographic variables were
compared between seropositive and seronegative patients
using independent samples t tests and Mann-Whitney U tests
for continuous variables and c2 and Fisher’s exact tests for
categorical data. For clinical scales (PANSS, CDSS, and CGI),
multiple linear regressions were carried out within the general
linear model with NMDAR antibody status (positive or nega-
tive), sex, and race as factors and with age as covariate. Sig-
niﬁcance threshold was set to p , .05; mean 6 SD are
presented unless otherwise stated. Owing to the exploratory
nature of the analyses, signiﬁcance values are given for two-
tailed tests where applicable and uncorrected for multiple
comparisons.

RESULTS

Participants and Prevalence of NMDAR Antibodies

A total of 387 subjects had a baseline assessment and blood
sample analyzed. Fifteen of 387 (3.9%) subjects had NMDAR
IgG antibodies detectable in serum, and 372 were seronega-
tive. These subjects were included in the analyses of de-
mographic data, duration of untreated psychosis, and baseline
symptoms. Demographic and baseline clinical data are pre-
sented in Table 1.

In total, 92 subjects were excluded from the follow-up
analysis. Two subjects dropped out of
the study before
receiving amisulpride (one because of returning to their home
country to be with family, another because of moving to a
different region of the same country); both were NMDAR
antibody seronegative. A further 90 subjects received ami-
sulpride but were excluded (either dropped out/excluded
before ﬁnishing 4 weeks of treatment or excluded from ana-
lyses after completion of treatment) because of the following
reasons: adverse events (n = 8), protocol violation (n = 42),
subject did not wish to continue (n = 27), subject died (n = 1), at
the discretion of the investigator (n = 4; includes violence [n =
1], prolonged hospitalization [n = 1], clinical inefﬁcacy [n = 1],

reasons (n = 8). Of these 90 excluded subjects, 4 were sero-
positive for NMDAR antibodies. Reasons for exclusion of these
4 patients were protocol violation (n = 1), death (died by sui-
cide) (n = 1), withdrew because of weight gain and fatigue (n =
1), and other (lost to follow-up: n = 1).

Table S1 summarizes demographic and clinical differences
between subjects who were included and excluded (dropped
out or excluded after treatment as described above) for follow-
up. The frequency of NMDAR antibodies was 3.7% in the
subjects who were included in the follow-up study and 4.3% in
subjects excluded from the follow-up study (p = .761).
Excluded subjects were less frequently white than included
subjects. The duration of psychosis was shorter for excluded
(median, 3 months) than for included (median, 4 months)
subjects (p = .041). In total, 295 (11 seropositive and 284
seronegative) subjects completed 4 weeks of amisulpride
treatment; these subjects were included in analyses of treat-
ment response.

The remaining seropositive subjects did not differ from
those who were seronegative with respect to age, gender,
body mass index, smoking status, or recreational drug use
(Table 1). However, the duration of untreated psychosis was

signiﬁcantly shorter in the seropositive subjects: the median
duration was 1.5 months (interquartile range, 1–3.5), compared
with 4.0 months (interquartile range, 2–8) in the seronegative
subjects (p = .031) (Figure 1B).

Clinical Associations of NMDAR Antibody
Seropositivity

At baseline, subjects who were NMDAR antibody seropositive
did not differ from seronegative subjects on any measure of
symptom severity (Table 2 and Figure 1).

Response to Antipsychotic Treatment

The mean reduction in PANSS total score over the treatment
period was not greater in subjects who were seropositive than
in those who were seronegative (p = .098) (Figure 1C), nor was
the CGI score at 4 weeks different between groups (p = .075).
CGI improvement scores at 4 weeks indicated a greater degree
of observed clinical improvement relative to baseline in sero-
positive patients (2.64 6 0.67) than in seronegative patients
(3.34 6 1.04; p = .044) (Table 3).

There was no association between frequency of remission
and serostatus, with remission occurring in 196 (69.3%)
seronegative patients and 9 (81.8%) seropositive patients (p =
.394). There was no difference between seronegative and
seropositive subjects in the frequency of adverse effects after
4 weeks of treatment (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
Our ﬁrst hypothesis was that seropositive patients with FEP
would have a relatively short duration of untreated psychosis
on the basis that the presentation of NMDAR antibody en-
cephalitis is typically subacute. This hypothesis was sup-
ported: seropositive subjects had a signiﬁcantly shorter
duration of psychosis before the baseline assessment than
seronegative subjects. This difference was not attributable to
serostatus-associated differences in variables that have been
(inconsistently) associated with a shorter duration of untreated
psychosis, such as male sex, younger age at diagnosis, or
substance use (19,20). Because the assessment of untreated
psychosis duration was retrospective, it was difﬁcult to pre-
cisely measure when frank psychotic symptoms ﬁrst emerged.
This issue could be addressed by conducting a prospective
study, with ascertainment of subjects in the clinical high risk
phase. However, this would require a large number of samples,
as the prevalence of NMDAR antibodies in this population is

similarly low [approximately 5% (21)], and only a minority of
subjects with clinical high risk will later develop psychosis (22).
Our second hypothesis, partly based on data from patients
with psychosis in the context of NMDAR antibody encephalitis,
was that seropositive patients with FEP would show a rela-
tively poor symptomatic response to antipsychotic medication.
However, seropositive patients showed a similar improvement
in symptoms to seronegative patients after 4 weeks of treat-
ment with amisulpride, with 82% of seropositive patients
achieving remission within this short time frame. This relatively
good response was evident both in the investigator-rated
change in the PANSS total score and in the evaluations
made using the CGI, in which the mean scores of seropositive
patients indicated that they were much improved, whereas
mean scores of seronegative patients indicated minimal
improvement in this group. Both sets of ratings were made
before determining patient antibody status. Whereas the CGI
improvement scale suggests a more positive response to an-
tipsychotics in seropositive patient, the more detailed and
objective PANSS failed to show such between-group differ-
ences (although the size of the seropositive group may not
have been large enough to clearly demonstrate that seropos-
itive patients do not respond better to amisulpride than sero-
negative patients).

We also predicted that seropositive patients would be
more likely to experience adverse effects of antipsychotic

medication than seronegative patients. While there was no
difference in the frequency of adverse effects between the
groups, this lack of difference should perhaps be interpreted
with caution because of the relatively low number of sero-
positive patients and low frequency of adverse events. The
absence of the predicted increased frequency of adverse
effects in the seropositive patients was not attributable to
their receiving antipsychotic drugs that are rarely associated
with adverse effects or that were prescribed at low doses, as
both groups were treated with the same medication in similar
doses. Moreover, compared with other antipsychotics, ami-
sulpride is relatively frequently associated with extrapyra-
midal side effects, which are the type that have been
associated with antipsychotic treatment in NMDAR antibody
encephalitis (6,7).

One patient who was seropositive for NMDAR antibodies
committed suicide 7 days after discontinuing amisulpride; this
was the only suicide reported. Suicidality and completed sui-
cide have been reported in NMDAR antibody encephalitis (23)
but to our knowledge have not been reported as a feature of
patients without encephalitis who are seropositive for NMDAR
antibodies. Post hoc analyses (not reported here) showed no
difference between seropositive and seronegative FEP on the
the CDSS. This ﬁnding and the
suicidality subscale of
observed overall lack of association between serostatus and
symptom severity across domains suggest that the seroposi-
tive status in this patient was coincidental.

the most

Our results suggest that serum NMDAR antibodies may
have limited disease relevance in FEP, insofar as they were
associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis but
not with a differential response to initial antipsychotic treat-
ment. Contrary to our hypothesis, the data suggest that
NMDAR antibodies may be associated with a good response
to antipsychotic treatment. We consider
likely
reason for this ﬁnding to be that NMDAR antibodies were not
causative of these patients’ psychosis and indeed that they
may be unrelated to their illness altogether. However, since
we included no explicit measurement of central nervous
system (CNS) inﬂammation, except by magnetic resonance
imaging, which is known not to be sensitive to autoimmune
encephalopathies, the possibility of some causal pathogenic

toms may have been driven by factors other than antipsy-
chotic medication in the seropositive group. In some patients

antipsychotic medication (24). It is also possible that psy-
chosis associated with NMDAR antibodies is more likely to
spontaneously remit (independent of treatment) than a psy-
chotic disorder that is not associated with autoantibodies
[possibly akin to other transient autoimmune phenomena
such as self-limiting arthritis with evidence of autoimmune
involvement (25)]. The clinical course of FEP is heteroge-
neous, with some patients experiencing only one episode
and others exhibiting a multiepisode course or a relapsing-
remitting course with accumulation of disability and comor-
bidity. Future work is planned to establish whether patients
with FEP who are NMDAR antibody seropositive demon-
strate a particular illness trajectory.

It will also be of interest to explore the longitudinal course of
NMDAR antibody serostatus in patients who were seropositive
(and indeed seronegative) at baseline, with a view to assessing
if serostatus changes in association with symptomatic
response to treatment, functional status, or relapse. There is
recent evidence from humans and animals that serostatus
ﬂuctuates over time and that NMDAR antibody production may
occur as a response to chronic stress (although this effect was
more marked with non-IgG isotypes)
(26). Furthermore, the
presence of functional unmutated IgG antibodies (27) suggests
the possibility that these antibodies may constitute part of the
natural antibody repertoire, potentially serving an adaptive
physiological function. One hypothesis might be that NMDAR
antibodies in patients with psychosis are a secondary immune
response to whichever nonautoimmune NMDAR dysfunction is
the primary driver of the illness.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study of
NMDAR antibodies in FEP. However, the prevalence and,
therefore, sample size of patients who are seropositive are low.
Our study excluded patients with organic psychoses and
required patients to be well enough to consent to and com-
plete a clinical trial. This suggests the possibility that our
sample may be biased toward patients who are more likely to
show a good response to antipsychotic medication than the
general clinical population. A recent study including acutely
unwell patients with FEP, of whom many were incapacitous
(i.e., lacked capacity to consent at the time of enrollment and
blood sampling), found a somewhat higher rate of NMDAR
antibody seropositivity, along with considerable evidence that
the antibodies were clinically relevant in these patients (con-
inﬂammation, and good
current CNS NMDAR antibodies,
response to immunotherapy) (10).

Owing to limited serum availability, only IgG NMDAR anti-
bodies were measured. Although IgA and IgM antibodies are

NMDAR Antibodies and Antipsychotic Response

not always thought to be pathogenic and indeed are not
considered to be causal in NMDAR antibody encephalitis, it is
conceivable that they could still have a useful role as bio-
markers of antipsychotic response. Another limitation was that
cerebrospinal ﬂuid was not available for analysis, which can
provide evidence of CNS inﬂammation by means of white
blood cell count, protein count, and the presence of oligoclonal
bands. A goal for future studies is to combine the measure-
ment of serum antibodies with the collection of cerebrospinal
ﬂuid so that the prevalence of CNS inﬂammation in seroposi-
tive patients and its impact on clinical outcomes can be
examined.

Conclusions

This study suggests that in a patient with psychosis, a positive
serum NMDAR antibody result does not indicate that treatment
with antipsychotic medication will be ineffective or associated
with increased adverse effects. This supports recent guidelines
for the investigation and management of suspected autoim-
mune psychosis (28) that propose that patients who are psy-
chotic and are identiﬁed as NMDAR antibody seropositive
should undergo further electroencephalogram, magnetic
resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid analysis to clarify
the clinical signiﬁcance of the positive antibody result. Only in
the presence of abnormalities conﬁrmed in these modalities is
it considered likely that NMDAR antibody seropositivity is truly
indicative of active CNS inﬂammation and that immunotherapy
might be indicated (28).

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND DISCLOSURES

This study was supported by a clinical research training fellowship grant
from the Wellcome Trust (Grant No. 105758/Z/14/Z [to TAP]) and a public
grant, BETPSY project, overseen by the French National Research Agency,
as part of the second “Investissements d’Avenir” program (Grant No. ANR-
18-RHUS-0012 [to JH]).
