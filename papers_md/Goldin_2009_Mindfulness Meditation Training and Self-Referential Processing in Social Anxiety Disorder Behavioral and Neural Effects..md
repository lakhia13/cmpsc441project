This study examined the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on the brain-
behavior mechanisms of self-referential processing in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). 
Sixteen patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while encoding self-
referential, valence, and orthographic features of social trait adjectives. Post-MBSR, 14 patients 
completed neuroimaging. Compared to baseline, MBSR completers showed (a) increased self-
esteem and decreased anxiety, (b) increased positive and decreased negative self-endorsement, (c) 
increased activity in a brain network related to attention regulation, and (d) reduced activity in 
brain systems implicated in conceptual-linguistic self-view. MBSR-related changes in maladaptive 
or distorted social self-view in adults diagnosed with SAD may be related to modulation of 
conceptual self-processing and attention regulation. Self-referential processing may serve as a 
functional biobehavioral target to measure the effects of mindfulness training.

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common and frequently debilitating condition 
characterized by intense fear of evaluation in social or performance situations (Jefferys, 
1997; Kessler et al., 1994). SAD has an early onset (Otto et al., 2001) and regularly precedes 
other anxiety, mood, and substance abuse/dependence disorders (Lampe, Salde, Issakidis, & 
Andrews, 2003; Matza, Revicki, Davidson, & Stewart, 2003).

SAD is associated with significant distress and functional impairment in both work and 
social domains (Lochner et al., 2003; Rapee, 1995; Schneier et al., 1994) and typically 
persists unless treated (Clark & Wells, 1995). The early onset of SAD magnifies its impact, 
including increased school dropout (Van Ameringen, Mancini, & Farvolden, 2003), poor 
social integration, and increased comorbid psychopathology (Lampe et al., 2003; Matza et 
al., 2003; Randall, Thomas, & Thevos, 2001).

Self-Referential Processing in SAD

Cognitive models of social anxiety (Clark & McManus, 2002; Clark & Wells, 1995; Rapee 
& Heimberg, 1997) suggest that during social situations several psychological processes 
characterize SAD, including fear of negative evaluation, maladaptive cognitions regarding 
self (e.g., as socially incompetent) and others (e.g., as critical judges), and an exaggerated 
self-focus. Self-referential processing (SRP) is heightened during social and performance 
situations in patients with SAD (Spurr & Stopa, 2002). Exaggerated SRP in patients with 
SAD distorts interpretations of social cues and maintains social fears (Bogels & Mansell, 
2004). SRP is thought to contribute to (a) negative emotional reactivity, (b) deficits in 
cognitive regulation of emotion, and (c) interference with interpersonal functioning. Thus, 
clinical interventions that influence SRP may modulate a core mechanism related to SAD.

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Self-Referential Processing

Mindfulness meditation, as taught in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), involves 
the cultivation of present moment focus without distorted evaluation (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). 
Mindfulness practice is conceptualized as directly reducing the habitual tendency to 
automatically engage in and react to evaluative mental states (Teasdale et al., 2000).

MBSR has been shown to be an effective intervention for reducing the symptoms of stress, 
depression, and anxiety across a wide range of clinical populations (Bishop, 2002). One 
mechanism by which MBSR may produce these reductions in clinical symptoms is through 
its effect on SRP, including reduction in negative self-rumination (Ramel, Goldin, Carmona, 
& McQuaid, 2004) and enhancement of experiential and visceral modes of SRP (Farb et al., 
2007).

MBSR and SAD

It is hypothesized that mindfulness training may diminish SRP in patients with SAD, 
specifically reducing habitual tendencies to engage in hypercritical social self-view (self-
evaluation) and to react in an exaggerated manner to beliefs about how others might view 
oneself (other evaluation). Thus, for patients with SAD, mindfulness training may lead to a 
shift from cognitive distortions of the social self toward a more adaptive (i.e., less distorted) 
mode of SRP.

Although the proposed mechanisms of MBSR appear to match the self–other evaluative 
distortions at the core of SAD, to date there have been only three studies that have examined 
the effect of mindfulness training as a clinical intervention for SAD. Patients with 
generalized SAD treated with either 8-week MBSR or 12-week cognitive-behavioral group 
therapy (CBGT) showed equivalent improvement on mood, functionality, and quality of life; 
however, clinician- and patient-rated measures of social anxiety indicated greater 
effectiveness of CBGT compared to MBSR (Koszycki, Benger, Shlik, & Bradwejn, 2007). 
Online delivery of MBSR was found to reduce shyness, anxiety, and social anxiety (Arana, 
2006). An intervention that combined mindfulness and task concentration training reduced 
fear of negative evaluation and self-ideal discrepancy (Bogels, Sijbers, & Voncken, 2006).

Thus, there is preliminary evidence that mindfulness training may impact self-processing 
and reduce social anxiety. An important gap in the literature, however, is the lack of an 
understanding of how MBSR impacts the neural bases of self-referential processes.

SRP, Neural Circuitry, and MBSR

Neuroimaging investigations using different stimulus presentations, including judgments of 
visually presented trait adjectives (Kelley et al., 2002), aurally presented statements 
(Johnson et al., 2002), or mental reflection on self-traits (Kjaer, Nowak, & Lou, 2002), have 
identified a brain network associated with SRP. A recent meta-analysis of neuroimaging 
investigations has identified three cortical midline brain regions that are reliably activated as 
a network during SRP: ventral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), dorsal MPFC, and a region 
spanning posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus (Northoff et al., 2006).

The selective engagement of this SRP-related brain network has been demonstrated for self 
versus situational focus (Ochsner et al., 2004) and for self versus perspective taking 
(D’Argembeau et al., 2007). The SRP-related brain network has been shown to vary with 
ratings of self-relatedness of stimuli recorded post–functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) (Phan et al., 2004) and may be valence independent (Fossati et al., 2003).

An investigation of the effect of MBSR on the neural substrates of SRP (Farb et al., 2007) 
found that a narrative self-focus, characterized as a language-mediated conceptual-analytic 
mode of evaluation, resulted in activation of midline cortical regions implicated in 
conceptual self-representation (ventral and dorsal MPFC, PCC) and language processing 
(left inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus). When cued to engage in an experiential 
self-focus, characterized as non–goal oriented, present-moment engagement with the 
contents of one’s thoughts, feelings, and body state, MBSR-trained participants had 
decreased brain responses implicated in conceptual self-representation and emotional 
reactivity (left dorsal amygdala) and increased right-lateralized brain responses linked to 
cognitive control (dorsal and ventrolateral PFC), visceral responses (posterior insular cortex, 
somatosensory cortex), and attention (inferior parietal lobule) (Gusnard, Akbudak, Shulman, 
& Raichle, 2001). This study, however, did not examine changes in neural responses from 
pre- to post-MBSR training, behavioral ratings of self-endorsement of traits, and differential 
positive and negative valence-related neural responses.

The Present Study

To investigate the effect of mindfulness training on the neural basis of self-processing in 
patients with SAD, the present study used fMRI to examine MBSR-related changes in 
clinical symptoms as well as behavioral and neural measures of self-processing. Clinically, 
we expected that MBSR would reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. On the SRP 
task, we expected that mindfulness training would increase positive and decrease negative 
self-view as indexed by changes from pre- to post-MBSR in self-endorsement of social 
traits. Neurally, our analyses focused on a SRP-related network of cortical midline structures 
(ventral and dorsal MPFC, PCC). We expected that MBSR would result in reduced 
narrative/conceptual self-focus (i.e., midline cortical neural responses) and increased

positive and negative SRP.

Methods

Participants

Participants included 16 (nine females) right-handed patients with SAD who met criteria of 
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) based on the 
Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule—IV (ADIS-IV; DiNardo, Brown, & Barlow, 1994) 
for current primary generalized SAD. Participants had an average age of 35.2 (SD = 11.9) 
and 16.3 (SD = 3.5) years of education and included eight Anglo-Americans, five Asian 
Americans, two Latino Americans, and one Native American. Comorbid current diagnoses 
included three patients with generalized anxiety disorder, three with specific phobia, and one 
with panic disorder without agoraphobia. Comorbid past diagnoses included two with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, three with dysthymia, and four with past major depressive 
disorder. All participants provided informed consent in accordance with Stanford 
University’s Human Subjects Committee guidelines for ethical research. Post-MBSR, two 
patients chose not to participate because of discomfort with MR scanning.

Exclusion Criteria

All participants passed a magnetic resonance scanning safety eligibility screen. Participants 
were excluded if they reported current use of any psychotropic medication, prior meditation 
training, or any history of neurological or cardiovascular disorders or met criteria for any 
current DSM-IV axis I psychiatric disorders other than social anxiety, generalized anxiety, 
agoraphobia, or specific phobia disorders.

Clinical Assessment

Clinical diagnostic assessments were conducted using the ADIS-IV (DiNardo et al., 1994) to 
diagnose psychiatric disorders. This structured clinical interview is based on the DSM-IV but 
has been extended to be more sensitive in differential diagnosis of anxiety disorders. We 
measured symptoms of social anxiety (Liebowitz, 1987), depression (Beck Depression 
Inventory—II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996), rumination (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991), state 
anxiety (Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970), and self-esteem (Rosenberg, 1965).

Procedure

Participants were recruited through Web-based community listings and referrals from local 
mental health clinics. Following a phone screen to determine MR eligibility, potential 
participants were administered a structured clinical diagnostic interview. Eligible patients 
were administered a battery of questionnaires and, in a separate session, the fMRI SRP task. 
Prior to MR scanning, patients were instructed on the SRP task with six practice trials for 
each of the three trial types using word stimuli not presented during the fMRI task. Stimuli 
were presented visually with E-Prime software on a PC. Patients with SAD were scanned 
again after completion of a standard MBSR course.

SRP Task

Goldin et al.

MBSR

Page 5

MBSR was delivered in an academic setting in a standard format based on the treatment 
protocol developed by Kabat-Zinn (1990). Participation included eight weekly 2.5-hour 
sessions, a half-day meditation retreat after session 6, daily home practice based on 
audiotapes produced by Kabat-Zinn, and daily monitoring of both formal and informal 
meditation practices. The course was led by a member of the team (P. G.) who was trained 
in Buddhist monastic settings in India and in the San Diego Veterans Hospital by a 
psychiatric nurse trained by Kabat-Zinn.

The SRP task is based on the self-referential encoding task (Derry & Kuiper, 1981), which is 
considered an information-processing measure of self-endorsement of self-schema. Stimuli 
consisted of 25 positive and 25 negative social trait adjectives from the Affective Norms of 
Emotion Words database (Bradley & Lang, 1999), balanced (all ps > .51) on word frequency 
(positive adjectives = 40.5, negative adjectives = 33.6), arousal (positive adjectives = 5.54, 
negative adjectives = 5.43), valence (deviation from neutral: positive adjectives = 2.66, 
negative adjectives = 2.58), and number of letters (positive adjectives = 6.9, negative 
adjectives = 7.2).

In a single functional run (9 minutes, 54 seconds), each of the 25 positive and 25 negative 
adjectives was presented three times, once in each of three conditions—self-referential (self-
descriptive or not)—and two control conditions—valence identification (positive or negative 
affective meaning) and case identification (upper- or lowercase). Each of the six conditions 
(three instructions by two valences) included five blocks of five adjective stimuli. Each 
block was comprised of a fixation, question (one of three questions: “Describes ME?,” 
“POSITIVE valence?,” or “UPPERcase?”), and five adjectives of the same valence 
presented one at a time for 3 seconds each (Figure 1).

Stimulus order was determined by a pseudorandom block sequence with no more than two 
blocks of the same condition in a row and a random sequence of words and upper-/
lowercase within each block. Participants pressed one of two buttons to indicate whether a 
word was or was not self-descriptive (i.e., self-endorsement), positively valenced, or in 
uppercase letters. Behavioral responses were made using a custom button box and recorded 
using E-Prime software during the scan.

Image Acquisition

Imaging was performed on a General Electric 3 Tesla Signa magnet using a custom-built 
quadrature “dome” elliptical birdcage head coil and a T2*-weighted gradient echo spiral-
in/out pulse sequence that used blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. The 
spiral-in/out sequence results in increased signal-to-noise (Glover & Law, 2001) and has 
been shown to be effective in recovering BOLD signal in frontal cortex and temporal lobes 
(Preston, Thomason, Ochsner, Cooper, & Glover, 2004). Head movement was minimized 
using a bite bar, padding, and plungers. During a single run, 368 volumes (each consisting of 
22 sequential axial slices) were obtained (TR = 1500 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 60, FOV 
= 22 cm, frequency encoding = 64, single shot, voxel resolution = 3.438 mm2 × 5 mm). A

high-resolution anatomical scan was acquired using a fast spin echo spoiled grass pulse 
sequence (voxel resolution = .85942 × 1.2 mm; FOV = 22 cm, frequency encoding = 256).

fMRI Data Preprocessing

Analysis of functional neuroimages (Cox, 1996) was used for preprocessing and statistical 
analysis. Every volume was examined visually and computationally for MR signal artifacts 
and outliers related to head movement and magnetic field disturbances. The first four time 
points in each functional scan were eliminated to account for stabilization of the magnetic 
field. The optimal base image for realignment and calculation of six motion parameters 
(three translations and three rotations) was identified empirically based on an automated 
recursive analysis of the root mean square adjustment for motion correction at each time 
point. No brain volumes required greater than ±1.0 mm motion correction in the x, y, or z 
directions, and there was no evidence of stimulus-correlated motion for any of the six task 
conditions. MR signal in each voxel was subjected to a high-pass temporal filter (.011 Hz) to 
remove low-frequency oscillations and was converted to percent signal change based on the 
mean MR signal per voxel.

fMRI Statistical Analysis

A multiple regression model was implemented using the AFNI 3dDeconvolve program. The 
baseline model included parameters to remove variance in each voxel’s time series related to 
mean, linear and quadratic drifts, and the six motion correction parameters. Six reference 
vectors for each of the six conditions (positive and negative versions of self, valence, and 
case) were convolved with a gamma variate model (Cohen, 1997) of the hemodynamic 
response function to account for the hemodynamic delay to peak BOLD responses. 
Resultant statistical maps were spatially smoothed with a 4-mm3 isotropic Gaussian kernel, 
resampled to 3.438 mm3, and converted to Talairach (Talairach & Tournoux, 1988) atlas 
space. Second-level paired t tests were conducted according to a random-effects model. 
Neural results are reported for the contrast of self-processing versus case processing only in 
this article to reduce complexity.

To correct quantitatively for the multiple comparisons, AlphaSim, a Monte Carlo simulation 
bootstrapping program in the AFNI library, was employed to identify a joint-probability 
threshold consisting of a voxelwise threshold of p < .005 and minimum cluster-volume 
threshold ≥163 mm3 (4 voxels × 3.438 mm3) that resulted in protection against false-
positive cluster detection at p < .01 in the whole-brain analyses.

Baseline Neural Results

At baseline, a one-sample t test of the contrast of positive SRP versus positive case yielded 
greater BOLD responses for positive SRP in brain regions implicated in self-processing 
(medial and dorsomedial PFC, medial precuneus), language processing (left ventrolateral 
PFC, posterior superior temporal gyrus), memory (parahippocampal gyrus), and visual 
processing (fusiform, cuneus, lingual gyri) (Table 2 and Figure 3).

For the baseline contrast of negative SRP versus negative case, a one-sample t test yielded 
greater BOLD responses for negative SRP in brain regions implicated in self-processing 
(medial and dorsomedial PFC, posterior cingulate), language processing (left ventrolateral 
PFC), affective processing (subgenual ACC), and visual processing (fusiform gyrus, lingual 
gyrus) (Table 3 and Figure 3C and D).

Post-MBSR Neural Results

We conducted paired t tests to examine changes from pre- to post-MBSR for the contrast of 
positive SRP versus positive case and of negative SRP versus negative case. For positive 
SRP, there was evidence of decreased BOLD responses in brain regions related to self-
processing (dorsomedial and medial PFC) and language processing (left inferior frontal 
gyrus) (Table 4 and Figure 4A). Negative SRP versus negative case processing resulted in 
increased brain responses in visual attention (left inferior parietal lobule and medial 
precuneus) (Table 4 and Figure 4B).

Discussion

The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of MBSR training on behavioral and 
neural bases of self-referential processing in patients with SAD. Mindfulness training was 
hypothesized to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, distorted social self-views, and 
activity in midline brain activations linked to a narrative/conceptual mode of self-referential 
processing.

Clinical Symptoms

MBSR resulted in moderate reduction of symptoms of social anxiety, depression, 
rumination, and state anxiety and increased self-esteem. These findings replicate previous 
findings in both healthy adults and clinical samples (Bishop, 2002) and preliminary evidence 
of clinical improvement in patients with SAD (Arana, 2006; Koszycki et al., 2007). While 
MBSR reduced social anxiety symptoms (Cohen, 1992), it did not match the effect of 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (cognitive restructuring plus exposure; d = 1.8) and 
pharmacological interventions (d = 1.5) on social anxiety symptoms (Fedoroff & Taylor, 
2001). However, a direct comparison of the longer-term impact of these three clinical 
interventions for SAD has not been conducted.

SRP

Page 8

MBSR resulted in decreased negative and increased positive self-views on the SRP task. 
This suggests that training in the mindfulness meditation skills may influence habitual 
distorted social self-views that are deeply entrenched in SAD. MBSR emphasizes cultivating 
an equanimous perspective toward mental and visceral experience. This perspective is 
described as a nonevaluative moment-to-moment awareness and a nonjudgmental 
metacognitive orientation.

Being able to shift from evaluative to nonevaluative awareness is a psychological skill that 
may be related to reductions in negative self-focused rumination. Decreased self-focused 
attention may account for the adaptive shift in social self-view in patients with SAD during 
MBSR. Changes in negative self-focused attention have been shown to vary as a function of 
social anxiety symptom reduction during from pre- to postexposure therapy (Hofmann, 
2000). This pattern of results indicates that a modulation of both cognitive content (i.e., self-
focused thoughts) and cognitive processes (i.e., attention and interpretative biases) may be 
core mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for SAD.

Neural Bases of SRP

Baseline neural results demonstrate that both positive and negative SRP in patients with 
SAD yielded robust activation of self-processing midline cortical brain regions (Northoff et 
al., 2006) and language processing areas (Iacoboni & Wilson, 2006). The apparent greater 
BOLD response for positive SRP compared to negative SRP may be due to either greater 
arousal for the positive SRP and/or reactivity to the negative social traits during the case 
condition, thereby resulting in a smaller difference in BOLD response in the contrast of 
negative SRP versus case. The similar pattern during positive and negative SRP at baseline 
in patients with SAD indicates that they automatically rely on a specific form of self-focus 
that recruits brain systems related to a language-mediated conceptual-analytic mode of 
evaluation (Farb et al., 2007).

Mindfulness Effects on Neural Bases of SRP

Behavioral ratings (i.e., self-endorsement) and neural responses during negative and positive 
SRP changed in opposite directions from pre- to post-MBSR. Thus, patients with SAD 
endorsed fewer negative social traits yet showed increased neural responses during negative 
SRP in brain regions implicated in attentional allocation (left inferior parietal lobule and 
medial precuneus) (Fan, McCandliss, Fossella, Flombaum, & Posner, 2005). This overlaps 
with findings from Farb and colleagues, who found evidence of increased sensory and 
attentional brain systems in adults with mixed anxiety and depression symptoms after 
MBSR for experiential versus narrative/conceptual self-focus (Farb et al., 2007). Enhanced 
activation of attentional networks during negative self-processing may be related to greater 
attentional engagement toward negative social traits, as habitual automatic avoidance 
diminishes with mindfulness training (Allen, Chambers, & Knight, 2006).

For positive SRP, MBSR resulted in increased self-endorsement of positive social traits and 
decreased neural responses linked to self-referential and language processing. Similar to the 
Farb et al. (2007) study, the observed changes in neural patterns indicate that MBSR

resulted in a shift away from the narrative/conceptual self-focus observed robustly at 
baseline. This suggests that mindfulness training reduces the prepotent conceptual-linguistic 
mode of self-processing and thus generates the possibility of utilizing other modes of self-
processing. There was not, however, evidence of increased viscerosomatic activation 
indicative of embodied experiential self-focus. This may be due to specific features of social 
anxiety, including an exaggerated habitual tendency to experience interoceptive somatic 
indicators of anxiety (Edelmann & Baker, 2002) that trigger negative self-perception and 
self-beliefs (Wells & Papageorgiou, 2001). Thus, unlike the increase in embodied 
experiential self-focus observed in healthy adults who completed MBSR in the Farb et al. 
study, decreased emphasis on viscerosomatic interoceptive processes may be clinically 
beneficial in patients with SAD.

One of the potential effects of MBSR is a reduction in the habitual tendency to engage in a 
narrative/conceptual mode of self-processing. In terms of neural processes, this suggests that 
the default narrative/conceptual mode may be reduced (ventromedial PFC, dorsomedial 
PFC, posterior cingulate/precuneus), while other types of self-processing that rely less on 
conceptual-linguistic-narrative modalities are more easily accessed. If the prepotent 
response in adults with SAD is enhanced negative self-view with concomitant diminished 
positive self-view, then a training that reduces the habit of distorted conceptual self-view 
could very well result in increased positive self-endorsement together with decreased neural 
activity in brain systems that support conceptual self-view.

Clinical Implications

These results provide initial support for a specific neural mechanism of change related to 
mindfulness training for social anxiety. Furthermore, this study provides brain–behavior 
evidence for the cognitive model of social anxiety, specifically, abnormal behavioral and 
neural patterns of self-processing in SAD. Importantly, MBSR resulted in changes in both 
positive and negative self-view, both of which have been shown to be aberrant in patients 
with SAD (Weeks, Heimberg, Rodebaugh, & Norton, 2007). Future clinical intervention 
studies might consider how baseline SRP may moderate treatment adherence and how 
changes in SRP may predict treatment outcome status or mediate changes in social anxiety 
symptom severity, emotional reactivity, and affective dysregulation.

Limitations and Directions for Future Research

This study is limited by the lack of a control group or active comparison clinical intervention 
that would help delineate more clearly how SRP is modified by MBSR. Future research with 
control groups will be necessary in order to address potential factors that might be 
contributing to changes in self-view, such as practice effects and habituation to the scanner 
environment. It may be instructive to compare the effects of different clinical interventions 
with different mechanisms of change (e.g., cognitive disputation, acceptance, attention 
training) on the neural bases of SRP.

There is a need for better behavioral and neural assessment of different modes of SRP, 
including narrative/conceptual, experiential, and other forms. This study examined only 
experimenter-selected positive and negative social trait adjectives. Patient-generated stimuli

may result in more robust brain–behavior responses in patients with SAD. This would 
provide a more ecologically valid test of the effects of clinical interventions on SRP.

In the present study, it was not possible to examine temporal dynamics of participants’ 
responses because word stimuli were presented for only 3 seconds each. Use of longer 
stimulus durations may allow for examination of sustained cognitive processes (e.g., 
negative rumination) and differential temporal features of BOLD responses in SRP midline 
structures.

Finally, the MBSR course was offered by the primary investigator of this study, and thus the 
course instructor was not blind to the study outcome measures. Future studies will benefit 
from having different individuals serve as the research investigator and the course instructor.
