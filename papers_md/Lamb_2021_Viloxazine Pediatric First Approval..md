Abstract
Viloxazine  (QELBREE™), a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is being developed by Supernus Pharmaceuticals 
as a non-stimulant for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in pediatric and adult patients. This 
is a novel formulation of a pharmacological agent formerly marketed in Europe for the treatment of depression in adults. 
Viloxazine received its first pediatric approval in April 2021 in the USA for the treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients aged 
6–17 years. Approval was based on positive results from a series of short-term phase III clinical trials in which viloxazine 
improved the severity of ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents with diagnosed ADHD. Viloxazine is available as 
extended-release capsules for once-daily oral administration. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of 
viloxazine leading to this first pediatric approval for ADHD.

Viloxazine (QELBREE™), a norepinephrine reuptake inhibi-
tor, is being developed by Supernus Pharmaceuticals for the 
treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
This is a novel, extended-release (ER) formulation of an older 
pharmacological agent for which extensive safety data are 
available [1]. The original, immediate-release formulation of 
viloxazine was first marketed in the United Kingdom and sev-
eral other European countries in the 1970s, as an antidepres-
sant for adults [2, 3]. It was withdrawn from market in the early 
2000s for business reasons that were unrelated to the efficacy 
or safety of the drug [3]. Recent development of viloxazine 
in ADHD, a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder that often 
emerges during childhood, was driven by the involvement of 
norepinephrine transmission in ADHD pathophysiology [2, 4]. 
As a non-stimulant with low apparent substance abuse liability, 
viloxazine represents an alternative to classical Schedule II 
stimulants for the treatment of ADHD [2, 5].

Viloxazine ER capsules were approved in the USA on 2 
April 2021 for the treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients 
aged 6–17 years [6, 7]. Viloxazine is available as 100 mg, 
150 mg and 200 mg ER capsules which are intended to be 
orally administered with or without food [6]. The capsules 
should be swallowed whole or, alternatively, they may be 
opened and their entire contents sprinkled over a teaspoon-
ful of applesauce. The applesauce with sprinkled capsule 
contents should be consumed in its entirety (without chew-
ing) within 2 h and should not be stored for future use [6].

The recommended dosage of viloxazine varies based on 
age. In children aged 6–11 years, the recommended start-
ing dosage is 100 mg once daily [6]. Depending on clini-
cal response and tolerability, the dosage may be titrated 
each week by a 100 mg increment to the maximum recom-
mended dosage of 400 mg once daily. In adolescents aged 
12–17 years, the recommended starting dosage is 200 mg 
once daily and, depending on clinical response and toler-
ability, the dosage may be titrated by a 200 mg increment to 
the maximum recommended dosage of 400 mg once daily. 
Treatment of ADHD with viloxazine may be required over 
an extended period. The long-term use of viloxazine should 
be re-evaluated periodically and dosage adjustments made 
if necessary. The US prescribing information for viloxazine 
carries a boxed warning of suicidal thoughts and behaviours; 
patients must be closely monitored for the emergence or 
worsening of suicidal thoughts and behaviours whilst receiv-
ing viloxazine (Sect. 2.4) [6].

The concomitant administration of viloxazine and mono-
amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), or the administration of 
viloxazine within 14 days of discontinuing an MAOI, is con-
traindicated due to an increased risk of hypertensive crisis 
[6]. Also contraindicated is the concomitant administration 
of viloxazine and sensitive CYP1A2 substrates or CYP1A2 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (Sect. 2.2) [6].

While viloxazine is also currently under phase III evalu-
ation in adults with ADHD in the USA [a recently com-
pleted double-blind trial (NCT04016779) demonstrated sta-
tistical significance versus placebo [8]; an open-label trial 
(NCT04143217) is ongoing], this article focuses on its use 

in pediatric patients. Clinical development of viloxazine in 
depressive disorders has been discontinued.

1.1   Company Agreements

Supernus Pharmaceuticals entered into a purchase and sale 
agreement with Rune Healthcare Limited (hereafter referred 
to as Rune) in June 2006 [9]. Under the terms of this agree-
ment, Supernus Pharmaceuticals obtained from Rune the 
exclusive worldwide rights to the product concept for viloxa-
zine hydrochloride (SPN-809). Supernus Pharmaceuticals 
paid Rune an upfront fee. Following the approval to market 
and sell any product based on this product concept, Supernus 
Pharmaceuticals is obligated to pay Rune royalties based 
on net sales worldwide. Unless terminated by either party, 
Supernus Pharmaceuticals will be obligated to pay Rune 
royalties on a country-by-country basis until either 10 years 
from the date of the first commercial sale of a product uti-
lizing the Rune product concept, or the market entry of any 
product utilizing the Rune product by any entity aside from 
Supernus Pharmaceuticals or its affiliates or licensees in the 
given country (whichever is earlier) [9].

Supernus Pharmaceuticals announced in January 2014 
the issuance of a European patent (no. 2341912) and a Cana-
dian patent (no. 2,735,934) covering the use of SPN-812 as a 
non-stimulant for the treatment of ADHD [1]. These patents 
will expire no earlier than 2029. At this time, Supernus Phar-
maceuticals had additional patent applications for SPN-812 
pending in regions such as the USA [1]. US patent protection 
has since been granted [10].

2   Scientific Summary

2.1   Pharmacodynamics

Viloxazine selectively binds to the norepinephrine transporter 
[inhibition constant (Ki) = 0.63 µM [6]] and has moderate 
inhibitory effects on norepinephrine reuptake [half-maximal 
inhibitory concentration  (IC50) = 0.2 µM [6]] [2, 6]. While the 
mechanism of action through which viloxazine treats ADHD is 
yet to be fully ascertained [6], targeting norepinephrine trans-
mission has been established to provide a therapeutic benefit in 
this treatment setting [2]. Viloxazine also modulates serotonin, 
demonstrating agonistic and antagonist effects on certain sero-
tonin receptor subtypes (5-HT2C and 5-HT2B, respectively) [2]. 
Results from preclinical studies suggest that viloxazine enhances 
serotonergic transmission without inhibiting the serotonin trans-
porter [2, 5]. In rats, viloxazine increased extracellular serotonin, 
norepinephrine and dopamine levels > 5-fold in the prefrontal 
cortex (an area implicated in ADHD pathophysiology) [2].

Although viloxazine may have the potential to inhibit car-
diac sodium channels, a supratherapeutic dose (4.5 times the 
maximum recommended dose) had no clinically meaningful 
impact on the QT interval, PR interval or QRS duration in 
healthy volunteers [6]. Viloxazine can, however, increase heart 
rate and diastolic blood pressure. In clinical trials of once-daily 
viloxazine in children aged 6–11 years, a heart rate increase of 
≥ 20 beats per minute (bpm) at any time point was experienced 
by 22% of viloxazine 100 mg recipients (vs 9% of placebo 
recipients), 31% of viloxazine 200 mg recipients (vs 15%) 
and 28% of viloxazine 400 mg recipients (vs 23%). In trials 
in adolescents aged 12–17 years, a heart rate increase of ≥ 20 
bpm occurred in 22% of once-daily viloxazine 200 mg recipi-
ents (vs 14% of placebo recipients) and 34% of once-daily 
viloxazine 400 mg recipients (vs 17%). In the latter age group, 
25% of once-daily viloxazine 400 mg recipients experienced 
an increase in diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 15 mmHg at any 
time during the trial (vs 13% of placebo recipients). Heart rate 
and blood pressure should be assessed before viloxazine is

initiated, and at appropriate intervals during treatment (includ-
ing following dosage increases) [6].

2.2   Pharmacokinetics

Viloxazine ER capsules exhibit dose-proportional phar-
macokinetics over the dosage range of 100–400 mg once 
daily  [6].  With  once-daily  administration,  steady  state 
was achieved after 2 days and there was no accumulation 
observed. Relative to an immediate-release formulation, the 
bioavailability of the ER formulation was ≈ 88%. After a 
single dose of viloxazine 200 mg, the peak plasma concen-
tration  (Cmax) was reached in median time of ≈ 5 h (range 
3–9  h).  When  viloxazine  ER  200  mg  was  administered 
with a high-fat meal, viloxazine  Cmax and area under the 
concentration-time curve (AUC) decreased by ≈ 9% and 
8%, respectively, while time to  Cmax was extended by ≈  
2 h; when the contents of a capsule were sprinkled on apple-
sauce,  Cmax and AUC decreased by ≈ 10% and 5%, respec-
tively. The human plasma protein binding of viloxazine is 
76–82% over a blood concentration range of 0.5–10 µg/mL 
[6].

Viloxazine  metabolism  is  primarily  mediated  by 
CYP2D6, UGT1A9 and UGT2B15 [6, 11]. In human plasma 
analyses,  the  major  metabolite  is  5-hydroxy-viloxazine 
glucuronide. Viloxazine and its metabolites are primarily 
excreted via renal elimination. Following administration of 
a single radiolabeled dose of viloxazine, most of the dose 
(90% [6]) was recovered in urine within the initial 24 h after 
administration [6, 11]. A negligible proportion of the total 
dose (< 1%) was recovered in feces [6, 11]. Viloxazine has 
a mean half-life of 7.02 h [6].

The pharmacokinetics of viloxazine do not meaningfully 
differ based on race or sex [6]. In children aged 6–11 years, 
the estimated steady-state  Cmax and AUC 0–t of viloxazine 
(at doses of 100–400 mg) and its major metabolite were 
≈ 40–50% higher than those in adolescents aged 12–17 years 
[6]. Abnormal kidney function is associated with increased 
viloxazine exposure  (Cmax and AUC); a dosage reduction 
is recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular 
filtration rate of < 30 mL/min/1.73  m2 (starting dosage of  
100 mg once daily, with titration in weekly increments of 
50–100 mg once daily to a maximum dosage of 200 mg 
once daily). In patients with hepatic impairment, the phar-
macokinetics of viloxazine have not been evaluated and use 
of viloxazine is not recommended [6].

Certain pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions are possible 
with viloxazine. Viloxazine is a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 
[6, 11]. As such, the co-administration of viloxazine and sensi-
tive CYP1A2 substrates or CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow 
therapeutic range is contraindicated [6]. The co-administration 
of viloxazine with moderate sensitive CYP1A2 substrates is not 
recommended and, if commenced, may warrant dose reduction.

Viloxazine is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and 
may therefore increase the exposure of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 
substrates when used concomitantly; patients co-administered 
these drugs should be monitored for adverse reactions and dos-
ages of the CYP2D6/3A4 substrates should be adjusted as clini-
cally indicated [6].

2.3   Therapeutic Trials

Viloxazine improved the severity of ADHD symptoms in chil-
dren aged 6–11 years with ADHD when orally administered 
at lower doses in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, multicenter, phase III trial (NCT03247530; 812P301) 
[12]. Patients with a confirmed primary diagnosis of ADHD, 
an ADHD Rating Scale-5 (ADHD-RS-5) score of ≥ 28 and 
a Clinical Global Impression—Severity (CGI-S) score of 
≥ 4 were randomized to receive once-daily viloxazine ER  
100 mg (n = 147 in the intent-to-treat population), viloxazine

ER  200  mg  (n = 158)  or  placebo  (n = 155)  for  6  weeks. 
Patients were required to refrain from taking any other ADHD 
medication for ≥ 1 week prior to randomization and through-
out the study. Least-squares mean (LSM) changes from base-
line in ADHD-RS-5 total score were significantly greater (i.e. 
improved) in the viloxazine 100 mg and 200 mg groups than 
in the placebo group at the end of the study (− 16.6 and − 17.7 
vs − 10.9; p = 0.0004 and p < 0.0001, respectively) [primary 
endpoint]. Viloxazine had a fast onset of action; significant 
(p ≤ 0.0244) improvements in ADHD-RS-5 total score were 
seen with each viloxazine dose versus placebo after the first 
week of treatment. At the end of the study, viloxazine 100 mg 
and 200 mg recipients demonstrated significant (p ≤ 0.002) 
improvements in Clinical Global Impression-Improvement 
(CGI-I) score, Conners 3-Parent Short Form (Conners 3-PS) 
Composite T-score and Weiss Functional Impairment Rating 
Scale-Parent (WFIRS-P) total average score relative to placebo 
recipients [12].

Viloxazine was similarly effective in improving ADHD 
symptoms in children aged 6–11 years with ADHD when 
orally administered at higher doses in a randomized, dou-
ble-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase III trial 
(NCT03247543; 812P303) [13]. Patients with a confirmed 
primary diagnosis of ADHD, an ADHD-RS-5 score of ≥ 28, 
a CGI-S score of ≥ 4 and a body weight of ≥ 20 kg were 
randomized to receive once-daily viloxazine ER 200 mg 
(n = 107 in the intent-to-treat population), viloxazine ER 
400 mg (n = 97) or placebo (n = 97) for 8 weeks (includ-
ing a ≤ 3-week titration period). At the end of the study, 
LSM changes from baseline in ADHD-RS-5 total score 
were significantly greater in the viloxazine 200 mg and 
400 mg groups than in the placebo group (−17.6 and −17.5 
vs −11.7; p = 0.0038 and  p = 0.0063, respectively) [pri-
mary endpoint]. For both viloxazine doses, improvements 
in ADHD-RS-5 total score reached statistical significance 
(p < 0.05 vs placebo) by week five of treatment. At the end 
of the study, CGI-I scores were significantly (p ≤ 0.0099) 
improved with both viloxazine doses versus placebo and 
change from baseline in Conners 3-PS Composite T-score 
was significantly (p = 0.0064) improved with viloxazine 200 
mg (but not viloxazine 400 mg) versus placebo. Treatment 
groups did not significantly differ with respect to change 
from baseline in WFIRS-P total average score [13].

Viloxazine was shown to effectively treat ADHD symp-
toms  in  adolescents  aged  12–17  years  with  ADHD  in  a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 
phase III trial (NCT03247517; 812P302) [14]. In this mono-
therapy trial, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD, 
an ADHD-RS-5 score of ≥ 28 and a CGI-S score of ≥ 4 
were randomized to receive once-daily viloxazine ER 200 
mg (n = 94 in the intent-to-treat population), viloxazine 
ER 400 mg (n = 103) or placebo (n = 104) for 6 weeks 
(including a ≤ 1-week titration period). At the end of the 
study, viloxazine 200 mg and 400 mg recipients demon-
strated significantly greater LSM changes from baseline in 
ADHD-RS-5 total score than placebo recipients (−16.0 and 
−16.5 vs −11.4; p = 0.0232 and p = 0.0091, respectively) 
[primary endpoint]. The improvement in ADHD-RS-5 total 
score was significantly (p = 0.0085) greater with viloxazine 
400 mg than with placebo as early as week one [14]. Both 
viloxazine groups showed significant (p ≤ 0.0042) improve-
ments in CGI-I score relative to the placebo group, while 
changes in Conners 3-PS Composite T-score or WFIRS-P 
total average score did not significantly differ between treat-
ment groups [15].

When administered orally at a high dose, viloxazine did 
not offer a significant benefit over placebo for the treatment 
of ADHD symptoms in adolescents aged 12–17 years in 
a  randomized,  double-blind,  multicenter,  phase  III  trial 
(NCT03247556; 812P304) [16]. Patients with a confirmed 
primary diagnosis of ADHD, an ADHD-RS-5 score of ≥ 28, 

407

a CGI-S score of ≥ 4 and a body weight of ≥ 35 kg were 
randomized to receive once-daily viloxazine ER 400 mg 
(n = 99 in the intent-to-treat population), viloxazine ER 600 
mg (n = 97) or placebo (n = 96) for 7 weeks (including a 
≤ 3-week titration period). Patients were required to refrain 
from taking any other ADHD medication for ≥ 1 week prior 
to randomization and throughout the study. At the end of 
the study, LSM changes from baseline in ADHD-RS-5 total 
score were −18.3 and −16.7 with viloxazine 400 mg and 
600 mg, respectively, compared with −13.2 with placebo 
(p = 0.0082 and p > 0.05 vs placebo) [primary endpoint]; 
due to a sequential gatekeeping testing procedure (in which 
viloxazine 600 mg was compared with placebo first), nei-
ther viloxazine dose could be considered superior to placebo 
[16].

Viloxazine was first demonstrated to reduce the sever-
ity of ADHD symptoms in children aged 6–12 years with 
ADHD in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter, phase II trial (NCT02633527; 812P202) [17]. 
Patients with a diagnosis of ADHD, an ADHD-RS-IV score 
of ≥ 26, a CGI-S score of ≥ 4 and a body weight of ≥ 20 kg 
were randomized to receive once-daily viloxazine ER 100 
mg (n = 45 in the intent-to-treat population), viloxazine ER 
200 mg (n = 46), viloxazine ER 300 mg (n = 47), viloxazine 
ER 400 mg (n = 44) or placebo (n = 24) for 8 weeks (includ-
ing a ≤ 3-week titration period). At the end of the study, 
LSM changes from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV total score 
were significantly greater in the viloxazine 200 mg, 300 
mg and 400 mg groups versus the placebo group (− 18.4, 
− 18.6 and − 19.0, respectively, vs − 10.5; p < 0.05 for each 
comparison). With viloxazine 100 mg, the improvement in 
ADHD-RS-IV total score did not reach statistical signifi-
cance relative to that with placebo (− 16.7 vs − 10.5) [17].

2.4   Adverse Events

Viloxazine was generally well tolerated in pediatric patients 
with ADHD in clinical trials [12–14, 16, 17]. In a pooled 
analysis of safety data from children aged 6–17 years with 
ADHD participating in randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trials (n = 826 and 463 treated with viloxazine 
100–400 mg and placebo, respectively), the most common 
adverse reactions in viloxazine recipients (occurring in ≥ 2% 
and at a rate greater than in placebo recipients) were somno-
lence (including lethargy and sedation; 16% with viloxazine 
vs 4% with placebo), headache (11% vs 7%), upper respira-
tory tract infection (7% vs 6%), decreased appetite (7% vs 
0.4%), fatigue (6% vs 2%), abdominal pain (5% vs 4%), 
nausea (5% vs 3%), vomiting (4% vs 2%), insomnia (4% vs 
1%), irritability (3% vs 1%) and pyrexia (2% vs 0.2%) [6]. 
Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of viloxazine in few 
patients (≈ 3%), with somnolence, nausea, headache, irrita-
bility, tachycardia, fatigue and decreased appetite being the 

Viloxazine: Pediatric First Approval408 

Y. N. Lamb 

adverse reactions most often associated with discontinuation 
[6]. Given that viloxazine has been associated with somno-
lence and fatigue, patients receiving viloxazine should not 
perform activities that require mental alertness (e.g. driving) 
until they know how viloxazine affects them [6].

With respect to the potential effects of viloxazine on body 
weight, viloxazine recipients aged 6–11 years gained an 
average of 0.2 kg of body weight (vs 1 kg in placebo recipi-
ents of the same age) during the short-term controlled trials 
(6–8 weeks) [6]. Viloxazine recipients aged 12–17 years lost 
an average of 0.2 kg (vs a gain of 1.5 kg in placebo recipients 
of the same age). During an open-label, long-term extension 
safety study, the mean change from baseline in weight-for-
age z-score was − 0.2 in viloxazine recipients evaluated at 
12 months (n = 338); it is uncertain whether this weight 
change can be attributed to treatment with viloxazine [6].

All patients treated with viloxazine should be closely 
monitored for the emergence or clinical worsening of sui-
cidal thoughts and behaviors (particularly during the first 
few months of receiving viloxazine and at times of dosage 
adjustment) [6]. They should also be observed for the emer-
gence of insomnia, irritability or other symptoms that may 
represent precursors to suicidal ideation or behavior [6]. In 
the short-term pediatric trials (n = 1019 exposed to viloxa-
zine 100–400 mg), suicidal ideation (n = 6), behavior (n = 
1) or both (n = 2) were reported in nine (0.9%) viloxazine 
recipients. Eight of these recipients reported suicidal idea-
tion or behavior on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C-SSRS). An additional viloxazine recipient reported 
suicidal behavior but not whilst completing the C-SSRS. 
Two placebo recipients (0.4%) reported suicidal ideation on 
the C-SSRS; none reported suicidal behavior. There were no 
completed suicides during the trials [6].

Viloxazine, as a noradrenergic drug, may induce manic 
or mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Patients 
should be screened for bipolar disorder risk before treatment 
with viloxazine is initiated [6].

2.5   Ongoing Clinical Trials

The open-label extension study of the blinded phase II and 
III pediatric trials in ADHD (NCT02736656) is ongoing. 
With an estimated completion date of June 2024, this study 
is evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of viloxa-
zine. Currently, two additional pediatric trials are planned 
but are yet to begin recruiting. These include an open-label 
phase IV safety study of viloxazine co-administered with 
psychostimulants in children aged 6–17 years with ADHD 
(NCT04786990; 812P412) and a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter phase IV trial evaluating 
the efficacy and safety/tolerability of viloxazine ER 100 mg 
in children aged 4–5 years with ADHD (NCT04781140; 
812P401).

3   Current Status

Viloxazine received its pediatric first approval on 2 April 
2021 for ADHD in pediatric patients in the USA.
