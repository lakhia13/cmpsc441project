Abstract

Manual motor deficits are common in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD); however, it is unclear whether these impairments persist into adulthood. The aim of 
this study was to examine manual dexterity and strength in young adults with ADHD aged 18–25 
years. Sixty-one individuals with confirmed ADHD and 56 adults without ADHD completed 
Purdue Pegboard tasks for manual dexterity and maximal hand- and pinch-grip tests for strength. 
In the Purdue Pegboard task, participants placed pins using the right, left, and both-hands, 
respectively. In addition, participants built assemblies using pins, washers, and collars with 
alternating hand movements. The results demonstrated that women without ADHD out-performed 
the other three groups in the right-hand, bimanual, and assembly PPB tasks. Both maximal hand 
strength tests demonstrated that men were stronger than women, but no differences were observed 
between adults with and without ADHD. The current findings suggest that adults with ADHD may 
have deficits in manual dexterity and tasks requiring bimanual coordination.

INTRODUCTION

Page 2

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental 
disorder affecting nearly 10% of American children ages 4 – 17 years [1, 2]. Children with 
ADHD experience difficulties in fine and gross motor control that negatively impact their 
academics [3], social life [4], handwriting [5, 6], and tool use [7]. In contrast, typically 
developing children (TDC) establish fundamental motor skills of gait and balance at 6–7 
years [8, 9]. Specifically, by age of 10, motor skills have become efficient and unnecessary 
concomitant movements (i.e., overflow) usually dissipate [2, 9]. Conversely, children with 
ADHD continue to experience deficits in coordination, balance, speed, and rhythm [2, 
9–11] and overflow movements do not diminish [11, 12]. Further, compared to TDC, 
children with ADHD present increased motor variability in temporal [13] and spatial [14, 
15] domains of assessment. Children with ADHD also demonstrate difficulties in tasks 
demanding manual dexterity and bimanual coordination [16]. For example, children with 
ADHD exhibit difficulty setting movement parameters, such as the size of letters [17, 18] 
and spacing between words [5] during handwriting activities. Further, children with ADHD 
also obtain lower scores during dominant, non-dominant, and bimanual Purdue pegboard 
(PPB) tasks compared to non-ADHD controls [19].

Although less frequently studied, ADHD in adulthood is also associated with motor control 
impairments, including inconsistent finger tapping frequency [20, 21], reduced visuomotor 
adaptation during reaching [22], deficits in oculomotor control [23, 24], and reduced 
postural stability [25]. Recent work from our group reported that, compared to adults 
without ADHD, adults with ADHD produced more force than required in visually and 
memory-guided isometric grip force tasks [26]. Similarly, in a force-variant of the classic 
Go/No-Go paradigm, adults with ADHD produced more force than non-ADHD controls on 
both Go and No-Go trials [27]. In other words, in both studies, adults with ADHD were 
able to scale their force output to the target force amplitude, but they produced more force 
than necessary to achieve the target [26, 27]. Importantly, no differences were observed for 
maximal force production in adults with ADHD compared to adults without ADHD in either 
study [26, 27]. Taken together, these studies suggest that adults with ADHD have difficulty 
controlling force output, and/or making error corrections during force control tasks. To 
our knowledge, no previous work has examined maximal force production in adults with 
ADHD.

Much of the previous work examining motor control in people with ADHD has studied boys 
and men and thus few have examined sex differences. Examining sex differences increases 
the sample size, complexity, and expense of the work. However, considering sex differences 
in ADHD is important as the male to female ratio changes as a function of age and ADHD 
subtype [28]. In children, adolescent, and adults, the M:F ratio, across all subtypes 2.28:1, 
2.56:1, and 2.15:1, respectively [28]. Therefore, we sought to determine if sex differences 
exist for manual dexterity in adults with and without ADHD. We anticipated that males 
would be stronger than females, but did not anticipate sex differences in manual dexterity.

The goal of the current work was twofold. First, we aimed to determine whether differences 
exist in manual dexterity and maximal hand strength for adults with ADHD, compared to

age- and sex- matched non-ADHD controls. Second, we evaluated whether sex differences 
exist within each of these groups. Maximal hand- and pinch- grip strength was examined 
as well as manual dexterity via the Purdue Pegboard (PPB) task [29]. The PPB requires 
multisensory integration, as well as control of fingertip forces. Based on our previous work 
describing perceived sensory differences [30] and differences in force output [26, 27], we 
anticipated that adults with ADHD would have difficulty with the PPB task as evidenced 
by fewer completions compared to adults without ADHD. Moreover, based on our previous 
work [26, 27], we did not anticipate group differences in maximal hand strength. Although 
we did not expect differences, we included this task to eliminate strength as a possible 
explanation for abnormal dexterity.

METHODS

Participants

Participants, aged 18–25 years, were recruited from print, radio, and television 
advertisements in State College, Pennsylvania and the surrounding area. Exclusion criteria 
included a history of seizures, epilepsy, meningitis, encephalitis, autism spectrum disorder, 
concussion that resulted in loss of consciousness for more than 10 minutes, or previous 
diagnosis of a disorder involving psychosis. An explanation of the study was provided to 
all participants before they completed a written informed consent. The Institutional Review 
Board at the Pennsylvania State University approved all procedures, which were consistent 
with the Declaration of Helsinki. The data reported here are a subset of a larger dataset. All 
participants received monetary compensation.

Diagnostic Groups

Procedures

Diagnosis was confirmed using Conners’ Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview (CAADID; 
Multi-Health Systems Inc.). Individuals with ADHD (n= 61, 40 female) showed five or 
more symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity, and these symptoms impaired everyday life 
in at least two settings, such as family and work. Individuals without ADHD (n= 56, 39 
female) reported less than three total symptoms and less-than or equal-to two symptoms of 
inattention or hyperactivity.

Adults taking a psychostimulant completed the laboratory session after a 24-hour washout 
period. No participants were taking medications known to affect motor control at the time of 
testing, including antipsychotics, stimulants, or anticonvulsants [31].

Prior to the laboratory session, using a Qualtrics web interface, all participants completed a 
brief medical history and long form of the Connors Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS) 
[32]. Handedness was assessed using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [33]. The 10-
item inventory asks participants to indicate which hand they would use to complete common 
tasks, such as striking a match, throwing, or using scissors. Handedness is determined using 
a laterality quotient (LQ = (R-L)/(R+L) * 100), where a score of 100 reflected complete 
right-hand dominance, and a score of −100 reflected complete left-hand dominance. Only 
individuals who were right-hand-dominant were included in the current study.

During the laboratory session, participants completed the CAADID semi-structured 
interview (Multi-Health Systems Inc.), which was updated in accordance with the DSM-5 
criteria [34]. IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition 
(WAIS-IV). Full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) score was derived for each participant 
[35]. Participants then completed grip and pinch strength testing and the PPB tasks [36].

Purdue Pegboard Tasks

Participants completed the PPB [36] to quantify manual dexterity. The right hand, left hand, 
and bimanual trials were 30 s in duration, while assembly trials were 60 s. In the first three 
conditions, participants were instructed to place as many pins as possible in a row of small 
holes in three conditions. In the right hand trials, pins were retrieved from the right-most 
well and placed in the right column of holes. In the left hand trials, pins were retrieved from 
the left-most well and placed in the left column of holes. In the bimanual trials, the right 
and left hands worked in tandem, retrieving pins from the right and left wells, respectively, 
and placing them in corresponding right and left columns. The last set of trials required 
coordination of the hands to complete “assemblies.” In these trials, participants placed a pin 
with their right hand, then a washer with their left, followed by a collar with their right, 
and a final washer with their left. This series of placements constituted one “assembly.” In 
all four conditions (i.e., right hand, left hand, bimanual, and assemblies), participants were 
instructed not to retrieve a pin if it was dropped, but instead to get another pin and continue 
with the task. The task was recorded by counting the number of pins successfully placed 
or assemblies completed. A total of four scores were obtained: pins placed with the right 
hand, pins placed with the left hand, pins placed with both hands (bimanual condition), 
and completed assemblies. In addition, the number of dropped pins were recorded for 
each condition. Participants completed three trials in each condition, and an average was 
calculated for number of pins placed and number of pin drops for each condition.

Maximum Hand and Pinch Strength Tests

Participants’ maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was obtained with pinch-grip 
(Lafayette Hydraulic Pinch Gauge, Model J00111, Lafayette, IN) and a hand-grip 
dynamometers (Lafayette Hydraulic Pinch Gauge, Model J00105 Lafayette, IN). In the 
pinch-grip trials, participants completed the task with the elbow bent to approximately 90° 
while seated and with the forearm supported by the arm rests of the chair. The thumb 
was placed on the bottom of the grip while the index finger was placed on the top. In the 
hand-grip trials, participants completed the task with the arm fully extended while seated. 
Participants squeezed as hard as possible with each hand to produce MVC of a hand for 
each grip maneuver. Three 3-second trials were administered for each hand during each grip 
maneuver. Participants alternated between left and right hands, providing at least a minute 
break between each trial. MVC was derived by taking the average of peak force of three 
trials.

Statistical Analysis

The groups were age- and sex- matched, leading to the following final sample sizes: non-
ADHD men (n = 17), men with ADHD (n = 21), non-ADHD women (n = 39), women with 
ADHD (n = 40). Differences in group demographics were tested using multivariate analysis

of variance (MANOVA). The Shapiro-Wilk’s test for normality was significant for nine of 
the 12 dependent variables associated with the PPB, maximal hand-strength, and maximal 
pinch-strength tasks. Therefore, group differences were examined using the Kruskal-Wallis 
H-test, followed by pairwise comparisons in which the significance values were adjusted by 
the Bonferroni correction for multiple tests.

RESULTS

Participants

Table 1 reports the results of a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for age, FSIQ, 
and three symptom-rating scores from the CAADID. As anticipated, no group differences 
were observed for age or FSIQ, all p-values > .05. However, adults with ADHD reported 
more symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, and more total symptoms than 
adults without ADHD, all p-values < .001.

Manual dexterity

A Kruskal-Wallace H-test was performed to examine the number of completions and the 
number of pin drops on the PPB. The results demonstrated a difference between groups 
for the number of completions in the right-hand, H(3) = 16.49, p = .001, left-hand, 
H(3) = 8.42, p = .038, both-hands, H(3) = 17.23, p = .001, and assembly, H(3) = 
22.62, p < .001, conditions. As shown in Figure 1, pairwise comparisons adjusted by the 
Bonferroni correction for multiple tests revealed that women without ADHD achieved more 
completions in the right-hand, both-hands, and assembly conditions, compared to men and 
women with ADHD, and men without ADHD. Pairwise comparisons for the number of 
completions in the left-hand condition were not significant when adjusted by the Bonferroni 
correction. The Kruskal-Wallace H-test demonstrated no differences between groups for the 
number of pin drops, all p-values > .098.

Manual strength

A Kruskal-Wallace H-test was performed to examine maximum hand- and pinch- grip 
strength between groups. The results demonstrated a difference between groups for the right 
hand-grip, H(3) 60.25, p < .001, left hand-grip, H(3) = 58.57, p < .001, right pinch-grip, 
H(3) = 20.89, p < .001, and left pinch-grip, H(3) = 26.67, p < .001. As shown in Figure 2, 
pairwise comparisons adjusted by the Bonferroni correction for multiple tests revealed sex 
differences, such that men were generally stronger than women. Specifically, for the right 
hand-grip, men with ADHD (99.7 + 20.2 N) and men without ADHD (94.3 + 21.9 N) were 
stronger than women with ADHD (55.2 + 11.6 N) and women without ADHD (64.6 + 14.1 
N). Similarly, for the left hand-grip, men with ADHD (93.4 + 23.4 N) and men without 
ADHD (90.2 + 18.7 N) were stronger than women with ADHD (52.3 + 11.6 N) and women 
without ADHD (61.0 + 15.8 N). For the right pinch-grip, men with ADHD (10.8 + 3.3 N) 
and men without ADHD (10.5 + 2.9 N) were stronger than women with ADHD (7.5 + 2.7 
N), but not women without ADHD (9.0 + 2.2 N). Last, for the left pinch-grip, men with 
ADHD (10.2 + 3.0 N) and men without ADHD (10.2 + 2.1 N) were stronger than women 
with ADHD (7.1 + 2.3 N) and women without ADHD (7.9 + 2.0 N).

DISCUSSION

Page 6

The current work examined whether manual dexterity and maximal hand strength differed 
for adults with ADHD compared to non-ADHD controls, and within these groups, for 
women compared to men. We report two findings. First, in terms of manual dexterity, 
women without ADHD achieved more completions in the right-hand, both-hands, and 
assembly conditions, compared to men and women with ADHD, and men without ADHD. 
Second, men (with and without ADHD) were generally stronger than women in both the 
hand-grip and pinch-grip tests.

Successful performance on the PPB task requires the performer to precisely control fingertip 
forces, filter out unnecessary sensory input, and correctly integrate sensory feedback in 
order to quickly and accurately place pins, washers, and collars. In the current study, 
women without ADHD performed better than women with ADHD, and both men with and 
without ADHD. These findings suggest that adults with ADHD may have difficulty with 
manual dexterity tasks. Three possible explanations to this finding include poor regulation 
of fingertip forces, inappropriate sensory filtering, and/or difficulties with sensorimotor 
integration in adults with ADHD. The pins used in the PPB task are small (one inch 
in length) and necessitate finely graded forces at the fingertips in order to meticulously 
pick up, manipulate, and place. Control over fingertip forces depends on the participant’s 
ability to store a memory representation about the object’s physical properties, which 
were obtained during early lifting and handling of the object [37–39]. Previous research 
indicates that children with ADHD have difficulties with parametric control of fingertip 
forces during precision grift and lift tasks [40]. Further, studies have demonstrated that 
individuals with ADHD exhibit an inability to filter sensory input [41] and increased 
moment-to-moment neural variability on cognitive tasks [42] compared to non-ADHD 
controls. Particularly, several studies have reported that neural activity is not appropriately 
suppressed in individuals with ADHD, resulting in more variable task performance due 
to neural interference [43–45]. As the PPB task does not isolate motor and sensory 
components, the current study cannot determine if the findings are due to motor deficits, 
sensory deficits, or difficulties with sensorimotor integration. Further, sex differences were 
revealed such that women outperformed men, which is consistent with a plethora of work 
[29, 46–53]. For example, Schmidt et al. (2000) report that when tasked with placing 25 
pins in the PPB, women completed the task faster than men with both their preferred and 
non-preferred hand [54]. These differences in manual dexterity suggests that future work 
examining fine motor control should account for sex in experimental design.

Grip strength is correlated with overall strength [55] and body composition [56] and 
may provide insight to functional ability [57, 58]. Indeed, accurate and predictable force 
is necessary for the successful completion of many activities of daily living, including 
eating, handwriting, self-care, and other functional fine motor tasks. The current results 
demonstrated that adults with ADHD do not have deficits in maximal hand strength and 
that men were stronger than women. Therefore, force production deficits in adults with 
ADHD are not likely due to strength deficits, but rather difficulty with force regulation or 
sensorimotor integration. Further, the finding that men are stronger than women, regardless 
of diagnostic group, is consistent with normative data [59–61] and is a reminder that studies

that examine maximal force production should include sex as a factor in the experimental 
design.

Conclusions

The results demonstrated that young adults with ADHD may have deficits in manual 
dexterity, but not manual strength. Women without ADHD outperformed men and women 
with ADHD in the right-hand, both-hands, and assembly conditions of the PPB. This 
finding suggests a deficit in fine motor control, manual/bimanual dexterity, and/or bimanual 
coordination. The PPB is a functional task that relies on multiple mechanisms, such 
as visuospatial skill, sensory integration, force regulation, and movement speed. Future 
studies might aim to parse these components to elucidate the neural mechanisms driving 
performance differences. Such work may determine that tasks of manual dexterity can be 
objective and quantitative measures for diagnosis, prognosis, or response to treatment.

The present work also demonstrates a need to examine sex differences between categorical 
groups. This poses a challenge for study recruitment and highlights the need for larger 
sample sizes and more complex statistical models that allow for the relaxation of 
assumptions such as equal group size and equal group variances. This is particularly 
important in the study of clinical populations with variability in behavior.

Women without ADHD (W-CTRL) achieved more completions than women with ADHD 
(W-ADHD), and men with (M-ADHD) and without (M-CTRL) ADHD for the right-hand, 
both-hands, and assembly conditions. Significance values for all pairwise comparisons were 
adjusted by the Bonferroni correction. Error bars represent standard deviation.
