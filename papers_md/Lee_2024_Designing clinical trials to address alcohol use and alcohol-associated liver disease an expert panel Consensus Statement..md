Abstract

Most patients with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) engage in heavy drinking defined as 4 
or more drinks per day (56 g) or 8 (112 g) or more drinks per week for women and 5 or more 
drinks per day (70 g) or 15 (210 g) or more drinks per week for men. Although abstinence from 
alcohol after diagnosis of ALD improves life expectancy and reduces the risk of decompensation 
of liver disease, few studies have evaluated whether treatment of alcohol use disorders will reduce 
progression of liver disease and improve liver-related outcomes. In November 2021, the National 
Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism commissioned a task force that included hepatologists, 
addiction medicine specialists, statisticians, clinical trialists and members of regulatory agencies 
to develop recommendations for the design and conduct of clinical trials to evaluate the effect 
of alcohol use, particularly treatment to reduce or eliminate alcohol use in patients with ALD. 
The task force conducted extensive reviews of relevant literature on alcohol use disorders and 
ALD. Findings were presented at one in-person meeting and discussed over the next 16 months 
to develop the final recommendations. As few clinical trials directly address this topic, the 28 
recommendations approved by all members of the task force represent a consensus of expert 
opinions.

Introduction

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is the main cause of liver-related morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. Globally, 47% of liver-related deaths in 2016 were estimated to 
be attributable to alcohol1. In the USA, a report from the National Institute on Alcohol 
Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) showed that 52% of cirrhosis-related deaths in 2019 were 
attributable to alcohol2. Most patients with ALD engage in heavy drinking defined by the 
NIAAA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as 4 or more drinks 
(56 g) on any given day or 8 drinks (112 g) or more per week for women and 5 or more 
drinks (70 g) on any given day or 15 drinks (210 g) or more per week for men over an 
extended period3. The WHO defines low-risk drinking as <40 g per day for men and <20 
g per day for women equivalent to <280 g per week for men and <140 g per week for 
women4. The WHO drinking levels and the NIAAA/CDC definition of heavy drinking were 
created in 2000 and 2005, respectively. The reference to men and women was based on sex 
at birth — preferred gender was not accounted for in these definitions. Approximately 75–
80% of patients with ALD also meet criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD)5-7. Continued 
consumption of alcohol ≥280 g per week after a diagnosis of advanced liver disease

increased all-cause mortality (HR 1.98; 95% CI (1.21–3.24)) and the risk of decompensated 
liver disease (HR 1.62; 95% CI (1.02–2.56))8. Conversely, abstinence is associated with 
improved life expectancy and in some cases recompensation5,9,10. Although these findings 
are widely acknowledged, and might be incorporated into clinical care, relatively few studies 
have incorporated active treatment of AUD or other interventions to reduce or eliminate 
heavy alcohol consumption in this population as a strategy to prevent or reduce progression 
of ALD.

Studies designed to address heavy drinking and AUD in patients with ALD should 
incorporate methods, measures and outcomes from both research arenas to achieve the 
highest quality studies11,12. Likewise, ALD clinical trials should integrate AUD research 
methods, because alcohol use strongly influences biomedical, psychosocial and quality-
of-life outcomes for patients with ALD. In this Consensus Statement, an international 
multidisciplinary group of experts, commissioned by the NIAAA, developed consensus 
statements and recommendations on how to define and combine best investigative and 
clinical practices for both AUD and ALD in single clinical trials in which the intervention 
targets reduction or elimination of alcohol use in patients with ALD or in which the 
intervention directly targets liver function in ALD without an intended direct effect on 
alcohol use. Evidence from observational studies suggests that reducing alcohol use should 
improve both liver-related and alcohol-related outcomes in patients with ALD, but this 
hypothesis requires empirical confirmation and clinical trials are urgently needed9,10.

Methods

In November 2021, the NIAAA commissioned a task force to develop guidance for studying 
treatment of AUD in patients with ALD. Members of the task force were selected by 
the organizing committee (L.E.N., M.C.M. and S.R.) appointed by the NIAAA, based on 
having expertise in design and conduct of clinical trials for the treatment of AUD or ALD 
or experience in randomized clinical trial (RCT) methodology. Selection of members and 
subsequent recommendations were not intended to represent the views of any professional 
societies, specific geographical representation, drug regulatory agencies, the NIAAA or 
other funding organizations. The task force included hepatologists, addiction medicine 
specialists, statisticians, clinical trialists and members of regulatory agencies. The task force 
was organized, met virtually on four occasions during the winter and spring of 2022 before 
an in-person meeting in July 2022 at which individual task force members presented a 
review of the published literature in their area of expertise along with recommendations 
for how to incorporate these findings into the design of trials to treat AUD in patients 
with ALD emphasizing how to evaluate the effect of treatment on the progression of liver 
disease. Following the meeting, the task force divided into subgroups to develop specific 
recommendations and guidelines (AUD: K.W. (Chair) with B.C., S.D., N.D., A.F.D., D.E.F., 
A.C.F., M.N.G., L.L., R.L., M.R.L., M.E.M., A.J.S., N.L.S. and K.W.; ALD: B.P.L. (Chair) 
with M.N.G., A.J.S., M.R.T., S.D., A.L., M.R.L., T.G.C., N.A.T., N.L.S., R.B., A.K.S., 
E.C.V., P.S.K. and F.A.A.; RCT methodology: J.M. (Chair) with A.C.F., R.B., S.D., K.S.D., 
L.E.N., M.C.M. and S.R. (organizers) met with all subgroups). Each of the subgroups met 
virtually on two or more occasions during 2022 to prepare consensus recommendations, 
which were then endorsed by all members of the subgroups. The proposed recommendations

were integrated by the subgroup chairs (B.P.L., K.W. and J.M.) for review by the entire 
task force at virtual meetings in March and June of 2023. Preliminary recommendations 
were submitted in written form to each member to provide edits and suggestions that were 
incorporated into the final recommendations that were sent to each member of the task 
force for approval. Each member of the task force contributed suggested changes to the 
concepts, the recommendations and the specific wording of the text that were circulated to 
all members of the task force for review and approval, seeking universal consensus. This 
iterative process was guided by the National Institutes of Health consensus development 
programme as revised by the Institute of Medicine (now National Academy of Medicine 
USA)13. However, the process did not employ the Delphi method or other formal methods 
for anonymous voting. The final recommendations including clarifications and edits during 
the review process are reported in this manuscript (Table 1).

Definitions

Heavy drinking and alcohol use disorder

• Recommendation numbers 1–2—Alcohol use should be quantified based on the 
number of standard drinks, frequency and duration of drinking. Given that the quantity of 
ethanol in a standard drink varies by country, standard drinks should be converted to grams 
of ethanol in research studies to provide global uniformity and comparability. Quantification 
of alcohol use, including past use and changes over time, is important because alcohol 
exposure is the central factor in the aetiology and diagnosis of ALD14, as well as treatment 
responses and clinical outcomes. For those trials in which interventions primarily target liver 
function, accurate measurement of alcohol use is essential to account for a major driver of 
liver-related outcomes: alcohol use. The WHO defines four sex-specific levels of drinking, 
based on average grams of alcohol consumed per day, that correspond to low (1–40 g per 
day male individuals; 1–20 g per day female individuals), medium (41–60 g per day male 
individuals; 21–40 g per day female individuals), high (61–100 g per day male individuals; 
41–60 g per day female individuals) or very high risk (>100 g per day male individuals; >60 
g per day for female individuals)4. NIAAA-defined and CDC-defined heavy drinking levels 
correspond approximately to the WHO levels of drinking above low risk (Fig. 1). Reducing 
drinking by at least one or two WHO risk drinking levels is associated with considerable 
improvement in how patients feel and function, including reductions in risk of ALD15 and 
improvements in liver tests16. Recommendations for quantifying alcohol consumption are 
outlined in Table 2.

Importantly, not all patients who engage in heavy drinking have AUD, which requires 
substantiation through application of diagnostic criteria from either the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders 5th (DSM-5) edition17 or the International 
Classification of Diseases 11th (ICD-11) edition18. The DSM-5 criteria for AUD are based 
on physiological, psychological and behavioural criteria19, which can be further categorized 
into four domains. The severity of AUD is defined by the number of criteria met: 2–3 
for mild, 4–5 for moderate and 6 or more for severe. The ICD-11 diagnosis of alcohol 
dependence requires the presence of two or more of three possible symptoms representing 
impaired control over alcohol use, alcohol use interfering with other aspects of life and

physiological features including tolerance or withdrawal and is consistent with the DSM-5 
diagnosis of AUD20,21. Both DSM-5 and ICD-11 include disease course specifiers to 
characterize whether the disorder is active, whether some criteria are no longer present 
(partial remission) and whether the individual is in early or stable remission. Correct 
categorization of a study population in clinical trial design is essential to interpret study 
outcomes. For example, a meta-analysis published in 2021 found the magnitude and 
variability of the placebo effect in RCTs depend on the severity of AUD and course 
specifiers of the study population22.

Steatotic liver disease

• Recommendations 3–4—Hepatic steatosis is influenced by obesity, cardiometabolic 
factors and alcohol consumption23-25. A multisociety Delphi consensus statement proposed 
in 2023, now endorsed by more than 80 professional societies, changed the nomenclature of 
‘non-alcoholic fatty liver disease’ to ‘metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease 
(MASLD)’ both to emphasize metabolic dysfunction as a primary driver of hepatic steatosis 
and to reduce stigma26. Heretofore, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease had been defined as a 
‘diagnosis of exclusion’ in patients with steatotic liver disease (SLD) who did not consume 
‘significant amounts of alcohol’ defined as >21 standard drinks per week (294 g) for men 
and >14 standard drinks per week (196 g) for women27,28. However, the risk of advanced 
liver disease increases with alcohol consumption above 1 drink per day for women and 2 
drinks per day for men29.

The diagnosis of MASLD requires hepatic steatosis and the presence of at least one 
cardiometabolic risk factor (CMRF) such as BMI ≥ 25, increased waist circumference, 
diabetes, hypertension, elevated triglyceride levels or low levels of HDL and non-heavy 
amounts of alcohol consumption. The multisociety Delphi consensus statement noted that 
alcohol is a primary driver of steatosis along with CMRF. A new category of steatotic liver 
disease called MetALD was defined as female individuals with MASLD who drink 140–350 
g of ethanol per week and male individuals with MASLD who drink 210–420 g ethanol per 
week26 (Fig. 1). On the basis of the expert opinion using the Delphi method, the threshold 
for alcohol consumption defining MetALD is the same as the WHO medium risk level of 
drinking for females and the NIAAA level of heavy drinking for male individuals26. The 
relative contribution to SLD of metabolic risk factors versus alcohol intake might vary from 
individual to individual. More research on this newly defined entity, MetALD, is needed.

Alcohol-associated liver disease

• Recommendations 3–4—Previous studies have shown that insulin resistance, low LDL 
cholesterol level, active drinking and genetic risk factors were most predictive of advanced 
fibrosis and inflammation in a cohort of 79 female individuals drinking >24 g per day and 
246 male individuals drinking >36 g per day with biopsy-proven ALD25. The multisociety 
Delphi consensus statement defined ALD with or without CMRF as alcohol consumption 
exceeding 420 g per week for men and 350 g per week for women. The analysis of the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2017 to 2020 (N 
= 7,367) found that fewer than 0.1% of participants were classified as ALD without any 
reported CMRF, whereas 0.7% of participants were classified as ALD with CMRF, 2.2%

were classified as MetALD and 31% were classified as MASLD defined as <140 g of 
ethanol per week for female participants and <210 g ethanol per week for male participants 
in the previous 12 months30. A number of participants with advanced fibrosis, defined as 
a liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥11.7 kPa, but without steatosis reported high alcohol 
consumption suggesting a need for careful evaluation of remote as well as recent alcohol 
consumption30. Considering the high prevalence of CMRF in patients with ALD, for the 
purposes of clinical trials, populations with ALD should include both patients with and 
without these known CMRFs, which should be stratified in trials.

We propose that clinical trials that focus primarily on the effect of alcohol use on the 
progression of SLD use a threshold of more than 140 g per week in women and 210 g 
per week in men, consistent with the NIAAA or CDC definition of heavy drinking and 
in alignment with the recently proposed multisociety Delphi consensus nomenclature for 
defining MetALD and ALD26 (Fig. 1).

Subpopulations of ALD

• Recommendation numbers 5–6—ALD represents a broad spectrum of disease 
severity, which for clinical trial design must be classified into distinct subpopulations 
that can be linked to indications for regulatory approval of drugs. Classification must be 
objective, reproducible and specific with respect to factors that influence disease progression 
and outcomes, as signs and symptoms of liver disease are nonspecific. Although liver biopsy 
has historically been considered a gold standard for diagnosis, it is invasive and costly 
and typically not necessary for classification into appropriate subpopulations31. Vibration-
controlled transient elastography correlates well with stage of fibrosis in patients with 
ALD32-34. Liver stiffness decreases in some actively drinking patients after as little as 1 
week of abstinence, but usually not to a degree sufficient to alter the category of fibrosis, 
particularly in those with stages F3–F4 (ref. 35). For the purposes of clinical trial design, 
we recommend utilizing the term ‘advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD)’ for the following 
reasons: cirrhosis is defined histologically; to align with Baveno Consensus36,37; patients 
with stage 3–4 fibrosis based on non-invasive methods such as vibration-controlled transient 
elastography or magnetic resonance elastography are at high risk of developing liver-related 
complications; and cut-offs for non-invasive tests to assess liver fibrosis in ALD have mostly 
been studied to identify advanced (stage ≥3 of 4) fibrosis rather than cirrhosis (stage 4 
fibrosis)32-34,38,39.

Thus, we propose the following subpopulations for clinical trials among patients who 
regularly drink heavy amounts of alcohol as defined earlier. ‘Early-stage ALD without 
advanced fibrosis’ is defined as a subpopulation with steatosis and with minimal-to-
moderate (stage 0–2 of 4) fibrosis based on liver histology or non-invasive tests38. This 
subpopulation is at lowest risk of liver-related events, but might progress to more advanced 
stages (stage ≥3 fibrosis) of ALD33. Patients are typically asymptomatic and lack signs of 
portal hypertension. Although Baveno VI recommended an LSM < 10 kPa cut-off to select 
patients without stage ≥3 fibrosis and cirrhosis, a large study from 10 European centres 
found using the receiver operating characteristic curve that LSM < 8 kPa was a more optimal 
cut-off in patients with ALD37,39.

‘Compensated ACLD (cACLD)’ is defined as a subpopulation with liver histology or non-
invasive testing showing advanced (stage ≥3 of 4) fibrosis. Baveno VI and VII suggested a 
cut-off of LSM >15 kPa to identify asymptomatic patients with cACLD36,37. However, in 
ALD, LSM >12 kPa is a better cut-off to select patients with cACLD as defined33,39, but as 
non-invasive tests can overestimate the degree of fibrosis36, a combination of non-invasive 
tests might be necessary in patients with LSM >12 kPa for inclusion in clinical trials33,38. 
Patients in this subpopulation are often asymptomatic and diagnosed with non-invasive 
tests (Box 1). They might have mild portal hypertension without liver decompensation 
(for example, non-bleeding varices or hepatic venous pressure gradient ≥5 mmHg without 
ascites).

‘Decompensated ALD’ is defined, according to Baveno VII, by the presence of any form 
of liver decompensation: ascites; hepatic encephalopathy; variceal bleeding occurring in 
patients with ALD36. As decompensated ALD can recompensate by reducing alcohol 
use, we recommend that clinical trials for decompensated ALD should standardize the 
time frame of the most recent liver decompensation (for example, within 1 year of study 
enrolment) necessary for study inclusion36.

‘Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH)’ is a severe, sub-acute clinical manifestation of ALD 
with recent onset of jaundice, liver-related complications and high short-term mortality40. 
Most patients with AH have concomitant underlying ACLD. Only patients who meet criteria 
for ‘definite’ (biopsy-confirmed) or ‘probable’ (compatible clinical history and laboratory 
results, and in whom confounding factors can be excluded), as previously published40, 
should be considered for studies for AH.

• Recommendation number 7—Stigma refers to negative beliefs about individuals or 
groups based on characteristics that might set them apart from others. Stigma is commonly 
experienced by individuals who have AUD, including those with ALD41,42. Diseases related 
to alcohol use are among the most stigmatized diseases43. International data suggest that 
‘persistent barriers related to stigma’ are some of the main contributors to the low prevalence 
of treatment44. Barriers related to stigma exist at the level of the patient, the clinician, the 
health-care system or organization and society45. Stigma operates under the conditions of a 
label (for example, ‘alcoholic’) and an associated stereotype (for example, ‘irresponsible’) 
to produce a negative response (that is, systematic discrimination)43,46. Stigma manifests 
itself in many forms including public, self and structural. Public stigma occurs when the 
lay public holds negative attitudes and beliefs towards specific groups. Although difficult 
to measure, public stigma can contribute to the slow development of new treatments for 
alcohol use and ALD. Self-stigma occurs when these negative attitudes and beliefs are 
held about oneself47. Structural stigma refers to the systematic and institutional barriers 
that prevent individuals with ALD from accessing the resources and services they need 
to manage their condition (for example, ineligibility for liver transplantation because of 
active AUD). When conducting clinical trials in AUD and ALD, we recommend measuring 
stigma and discussing ways to reduce stigma with all team members (for example, an 
unbiased approach, using person-first language, recognizing that both AUD and ALD are

treatable conditions, ensuring equal access to health care)42,48,49. When possible, patient 
representatives and other stakeholders should participate in the design of clinical trials. The 
NIAAA Core Resource on Alcohol includes a section with suggestions for overcoming 
barriers related to stigma50.

Minimum data set

Demographics

• Recommendation numbers 8–9—Selecting a study population for which treatment 
is expected to have clinically meaningful benefits is critical for the success of a clinical 
trial51. Demographic data including age, biological sex, gender identity, race, family history 
of AUD and ALD and ethnicity should be included52. Differences between male and female 
individuals exist across rates of alcohol consumption, diagnosis and treatment response53. 
Racial and ethnic subgroups have different prevalence rates and might have differences 
in physiological effects of alcohol54. Additional variables include weight, height, body 
mass index, waist–hip ratio and metabolic comorbidities including levels of systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, 
HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and HbA1c levels.

Previous diagnosis of liver disease (including the method of diagnosis) and liver-related 
complications including AH, history of substance use disorder, alcohol use by spouse or 
partner, smoking and/or tobacco history, presence and stage of kidney disease, history of 
pancreatitis, history of sleep apnoea and WHO risk drinking levels and sociodemographic 
variables including employment status (occupation), income level, foreign birth, health-care 
insurance status and type, highest educational attainment, preferred language and marital 
status are of interest in some clinical trials.

Liver disease clinical parameters and biochemical tests

• Recommendation number 10—Biomarkers that can be used for identifying stage 
of disease, safety and response considerations for therapeutic interventions and trial end 
points in terms of liver function trajectory in response to treatment (Box 1) will be crucial 
components for any clinical trial. Ideal biomarkers would be non-invasive, accurate and 
reproducible, specific to the stage of disease and reflect dynamic changes in disease status 
and be associated with clinically important outcomes. The ideal biomarkers can include a 
combination of static and dynamic models of liver function, especially at the more severe 
end of the spectrum of AUD or ALD. Major advances in imaging-based assessment of 
liver steatosis and liver stiffness might be of value when available. Imaging techniques, 
including ultrasonography, CT and MRI, can be useful for detecting steatosis, staging 
fibrosis, detecting signs of portal hypertension and for hepatocellular carcinoma screening 
and diagnosis55.

Alcohol use history

Measurements of alcohol use are typically obtained by interviewing a patient along with 
collateral reports (for example, interviews with family or friends, assessment of previous 
medical records, criminal record, etc., when indicated) to develop an in-depth assessment

of recent and lifetime use (such as heaviest period of drinking), as well as periods of 
abstinence or reduced drinking56-59. Table 2 provides a summary of the measures that 
should be used to assess alcohol use and the advantages and disadvantages of each measure. 
At a minimum for all trials in patients with ALD, participants should be asked to report 
their alcohol use through validated measures (such as Alcohol Use Disorders Identification 
Test-concise (AUDIT-C)) as well as problems related to alcohol use through validated 
measures such as the full Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) questionnaire. 
For trials in which alcohol use is the intervention target, more granular detail about 
alcohol consumption patterns should be obtained using Timeline Follow-back, daily diary or 
ecological momentary assessments (Table 2).

Biological markers (Table 3 notes measures commonly collected in AUD clinical trials) are 
often used in research and/or clinical practice to supplement self-report alcohol use data60. 
The performance of a biomarker depends on sensitivity and specificity of the measure and 
alcohol consumption (that is, amount consumed, duration of consumption, peak alcohol 
level achieved and time between last use and testing). Although the direct measurement of 
ethanol in blood or breath, or its metabolites ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate in urine, 
is simple, only relatively recent alcohol use will be identified, owing to the rapid rate 
of metabolism of ethanol (on average, 0.0179 ± 0.0030 g ethanol per decilitre per hour 
in women and 0.0159 ± 0.0028 g ethanol per decilitre per hour in men)61,62. Measuring 
phosphatidylethanol (PEth) concentration requires whole blood and is costly but has higher 
sensitivity and specificity for detecting past alcohol exposure up to 4 weeks63,64 than other 
biomarkers such as carbohydrate-deficient transferrin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and mean 
corpuscular volume. Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin has lower specificity in advanced 
liver disease65, whereas agreement between laboratories for PEth values is excellent and can 
be used to validate self-reported consumption64. We recommend using PEth to corroborate 
self-reported alcohol consumption, particularly if doubt about veracity exists.

As noted, heavy alcohol use is not synonymous with AUD, and validated measures of AUD 
are also important for assessing how alcohol use is affecting the quality of life of a patient, 
particularly for trials targeting alcohol use directly.

Individual susceptibility and genetics

• Recommendation number 11—Patients with heavy alcohol consumption have 
variable individual susceptibility to develop severe forms of ALD66. These predisposing 
factors include environmental, genetic and epigenetic determinants that might affect 
anticipated event rates in clinical trials as they could represent different phenotypes of 
disease. Whether excessive drinking continues after the identification of ALD as well as 
the quantity of alcohol consumed are key risk factors that influence progression of ALD31. 
Female sex, ethnicity, obesity, cigarette smoking and coexistence of other causes of liver 
injury have been shown to negatively influence the disease development and outcomes67. 
Several genetic loci have been associated with the risk of developing severe ALD. Although 
risk loci in PNPLA3, TM6SF2, MBOAT7 and HNRNPUL1 increase the risk of ALD 
progression, risk variants in HSD17B13, MARC1 and FAF2 confer protection towards 
progressive ACLD68. Many people of Hispanic ethnicity are predisposed to develop AH,

possibly owing to mutations in PNPLA3 that influence disease development and severity69. 
Epigenetic factors that modulate gene expression in the absence of changes in DNA 
sequence might also influence susceptibility70. MicroRNA-regulated gene expression and 
changes in methylation and histone acetylation are implicated in both progression of ACLD 
and the development of AH70. Given the influence of genetic factors that modify risk of 
fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis in patients with ALD25, future clinical trials in patients 
with early-stage ALD and cACLD should consider stratifying patients or use other methods 
to balance the study populations according to known genetic risk factors.

Trial components

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

• Recommendation number 12—Inclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical trials are 
listed in Box 2. Participants or their representatives should have adequate cognitive function 
to provide written informed consent. Trials should include men and women above age 
18 years. Providing all assessment, recruitment and treatment materials in the language 
(languages) that are represented in the population is desirable.

Early-stage ALD or cACLD.: As patients with ongoing heavy alcohol use have substantial 
competing risk of non-liver-related mortality, presence of extrahepatic diseases (such as 
cancer, cardiovascular, pulmonary or kidney conditions) must be considered during clinical 
trial design71,72. Threshold criteria to exclude patients who are more likely to experience 
outcomes related to extrahepatic disease rather than liver disease should depend on the goals 
of the clinical trial. For example, trials in early-stage ALD or cACLD, which have lower 
liver-related event rates, might need to exclude patients with mild–moderate extrahepatic 
diseases, whereas only severe extrahepatic disease might need to be excluded in trials 
enrolling decompensated ACLD or severe AH. The goal for trials in early-stage ALD is 
to prevent progression to ACLD, whereas the goal for cACLD is to reduce the risk of 
decompensation and death. Excluding too many patients with extrahepatic diseases could 
make the study less feasible and affect generalizability of the findings owing to the high 
prevalence of medical comorbidities in ALD. Calculation of the sample size could be 
affected if patients with extrahepatic comorbidities are not excluded.

Patients with early-stage ALD and cACLD have a minimal risk of decompensation (<25% 
at 3 years in ACLD) if they are abstinent or consume low amounts of alcohol8. In clinical 
trials assessing interventions for AUD in patients with early-stage ALD or cACLD, the 
target population should include patients with continuing alcohol use or those who are at 
high risk of resuming alcohol use. Development of tools to objectively predict future alcohol 
use could improve clinical trial design. Feasibility limits prospective studies in patients with 
AUD focusing on long-term end points (for example, incidence of cirrhosis at 10 years). 
Thus, any strategy aiming to reduce liver-related risks should focus on patients with cACLD 
as defined earlier. Finally, metabolic dysfunction-associated liver disease progresses less 
rapidly than ALD and acts as a cofactor in the progression of fibrosis73. Hence, patients with 
metabolic risk factors should not be excluded from trials dedicated to alcohol, but metabolic

risk factors should be recorded in the data set and methods should be used to balance the 
study populations at inclusion24,74.

Decompensated ALD and AH.: In the clinical course of decompensated ALD, the broad 
usage of the term ‘acute-on-chronic liver failure’ is problematic because many factors 
(gastrointestinal bleeding, AH, infection, etc.) can precipitate decompensation and liver 
failure, and each has a specific prognosis75-78. In clinical trials of AH, recent onset of 
jaundice is considered fundamental to clinically diagnose AH40, but there is no consensus 
regarding the maximal duration of jaundice to make a diagnosis of AH. Indeed, the 
published criterion requiring jaundice onset within the past 8 weeks is arbitrary40. Between 
18% and 32% of patients with severe AH develop infection after the onset of jaundice77-80. 
Because the outcome is similar to non-infected patients, they might be included in trials 
after infection is controlled with appropriate antibiotics. All patients presenting with AH and 
many who present with new onset decompensation of ACLD have a history of recent alcohol 
consumption. It follows that these patients are at risk of alcohol-withdrawal syndrome81. 
Eligibility for entry into clinical trials should be delayed until the risk of withdrawal has 
passed or alcohol-withdrawal syndrome has been successfully managed.

End points

• Recommendation number 13

ALD-related end points.: Outcomes or events (end points) in clinical trials need to be 
defined to determine whether the treatment has been beneficial. However, as regulatory 
agencies have not defined specific end points for clinical trials for ALD, the clinical research 
community will need to define acceptable end points by consensus but currently there is 
a lack of consensus (Supplementary Table 1). End points should be clinically meaningful 
in the context of the stage of clinical development and the overall intended goal of the 
trial (reduction in consumption of alcohol versus improvement in liver-related outcomes 
independently of changes in alcohol use). In phase II studies, in which the objective 
is to demonstrate evidence of a clinical effect, the study size might limit the ability to 
demonstrate statistically significant differences in relatively uncommon clinical events, for 
example, mortality. In this case, surrogate end points (Table 4) can be used to demonstrate a 
clinical effect that can then be formally tested in a phase III study.

In early-stage ALD, clinical outcomes, such as hepatic decompensation or death, are rare 
and prognosis is generally good in patients who achieve alcohol abstinence8. Thus, the most 
appropriate clinical outcome might be the percentage of participants who achieve abstinence 
and duration of abstinence. In early-stage ALD, progression of fibrosis to ACLD, monitored 
by non-invasive testing, might not be a clinical outcome, but this disease landmark is an 
important indicator of future risk of complications82.

In cACLD, the most important clinical outcome is to prevent hepatic decompensation, 
defined by jaundice, ascites, encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage or progression of portal 
hypertension as defined by Baveno criteria36. Prevention of decompensation has a major 
influence on quality of life and health-care expenditure83,84. Decompensation events are, 
therefore, an appropriate trial end point in both phase II and phase III trials. Patient-related

outcomes, including reduction in WHO risk levels4 and quality of life, are reasonable 
secondary end points.

In decompensated ACLD, the primary purpose of treatment is to reduce mortality, but there 
are multiple threats to life in this setting. Any solo intervention targeting a given threat might 
not improve mortality while still providing clinical benefit. Both liver-related mortality and 
all-cause mortality are important end points. Thus, there is room for innovative trial designs 
that use hierarchical end points such as the ‘win ratio’85 used in heart failure trials or the 
Desirability of Outcome Ranking and Response (DOOR) approach used in sepsis trials86. 
These complex outcomes could be used as alternatives to mortality or hospital admission 
rates in both phase II and III trials to avoid losing promising therapeutic candidates during 
development. In phase II studies, improvement in scoring systems such as model for end-
stage liver disease (MELD) score could be acceptable. In phase III studies, these scoring 
systems could be used to stratify patients. However, in phase III studies, irrespective of 
the specific end point, there is no consensus on the crucial time point at which to measure 
outcome rates (Supplementary Table 1). Thus, we recommend using a minimum of 6 
months.

In non-severe AH, the best prognostic indicator is recovery of liver function, best assessed 
as improvement in traditional MELD score71. In severe AH, the consensus primary end 
point is mortality at 90–180 days. Although this end point is appropriate for phase 
III trials, surrogate outcomes could be used in phase II studies31. Both the Lille score 
and improvement in MELD score are good prognostic indicators and can be used to 
demonstrate therapeutic improvement when treatment is compared against standard of 
care40,79,87. The Lille score predicted 6-month survival in patients treated with anakinra, 
zinc and pentoxyfiline as well as those treated with methylprednisolone in the DASH trial79. 
Mortality beyond 180 days is also important and can be influenced substantially by drinking 
≥30 g per day, 6 months after a diagnosis of severe AH (hazard ratio for mortality 3.90; 95% 
CI 2.61–5.82)87.

In decompensated ALD and AH, patients might receive liver transplantation during the 
study follow-up. Given that liver transplantation is intended for medically refractory 
ALD, we recommend that transplant-free survival rather than overall survival be used 
as the primary end point. In clinical trials assessing MELD improvement, the MELD 
score before transplantation can be imputed and subtracted from baseline MELD among 
patients who receive transplant before the study end point time. Because the application 
of early transplantation for AH (that is, without mandated period of abstinence) varies 
by country and centre, heterogeneity in transplant practice might introduce confounding 
results in clinical trials, particularly if a substantial proportion of individuals will be 
eligible for early transplantation88-91. For example, a therapy that decreases early mortality 
could paradoxically increase the number of patients surviving long enough to be eligible 
for transplantation. In this instance, overall survival, rather than transplant-free survival, 
would be a more appropriate primary outcome. Transplant-related data should be analysed 
by centre (for example, early transplant policies and/or criteria and median MELD at 
transplant) and by individual (time from diagnosis to transplant and trajectory of MELD

score before transplant) to determine whether overall or transplant-free survival better 
reflects an improvement in outcome.

AUD-related end points.: The most common end points in clinical trials for AUD are 
derived from calendar-based methods for assessing daily alcohol consumption (for example, 
the Timeline Follow-Back methodology92), quantity–frequency questionnaires (for example, 
the Daily Drinking Questionnaire93) that capture frequency and intensity of drinking over 
a period of time or that define alcohol risk levels based on the AUDIT94 and AUDIT-C 
(Table 2). Craving was shown to correlate with mood obtained from ecological momentary 
assessments in patients with ALD95. Biological markers (Table 3) are often used in clinical 
trials to supplement self-report alcohol use data60. Understanding which outcomes related 
to drinking (for example, abstinent and heavy drinking days, reduction in WHO risk score, 
AUD symptom severity, AUDIT scores and biomarker level) are most closely associated 
with optimal ALD outcomes is critical to optimizing care for patients with ALD.

Treatment considerations

The type and duration of treatment must be clear. Treatments that are aimed solely at 
improving liver function or treating complications of liver disease should be evaluated 
separately from treatments aimed at reducing alcohol consumption or managing AUD.

Pharmacotherapy

• Recommendation number 14—Drugs studied under an Investigational New Drug 
application require existing preclinical toxicology and in vitro drug interaction testing, 
but data on the effects of severe organ dysfunction and interactions with alcohol may 
be incomplete. Any drug trial that involves subjects with ALD, irrespective of the drug 
target, should account for potential alterations in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics 
owing to both alcohol consumption and ACLD96-98. Any pharmacotherapy study for 
patients with AUD and ALD should also consider potential drug–alcohol interactions that 
may limit efficacy or introduce safety concerns. The protocol should include a robust 
safety component for both adverse events (AEs) and suspected unexpected severe adverse 
reactions.

Behavioural or cognitive therapies

• Recommendation numbers 15–17—Many behavioural treatments for AUD can 
be delivered in residential (for example, inpatient), intensive outpatient and outpatient 
settings, but relatively few randomized clinical trials have been conducted with patients 
with comorbid AUD and ALD99. A recent systematic review of 10 studies conducted with 
patients with ALD who engaged in heavy drinking (AUDIT score >16 or at least 80% of the 
sample met criteria for an AUD using valid assessment tools) concluded that behavioural 
therapies can reduce drinking or promote abstinence among individuals with ALD100. 
Results indicated that motivation enhancement therapy and motivational interviewing, 
which can be delivered in four treatment sessions or fewer, showed benefit over minimal 
intervention. Mobile health treatments are gaining in popularity, have demonstrated 
effectiveness for AUD and may be feasible for those with AUD and ALD101,102.

All trials for ALD should acknowledge explicitly the benefits of reduced drinking and 
the potential need for AUD treatment. Brief motivational interviewing for reducing heavy 
drinking should be offered with few exceptions99. Questions about alcohol use should be 
open-ended using a non-judgmental and collaborative style. In clinical practice, asking 
open-ended questions using a non-judgmental stance can be therapeutic for patients and 
can be considered a minimum intervention103-106. If patients are interested in further 
treatment and/or meet diagnostic criteria for AUD, a plan for management of AUD may 
be incorporated into clinical protocols and motivation enhancement therapy that can be 
delivered in as few as four sessions is recommended for first-line treatment107.

For clinical trials studying ALD, testing distinct AUD treatment (treatments) including 
pharmacological, behavioural or cognitive should be pre-specified in the protocol 
with stratified results if more than one treatment modality for AUD is pre-specified. 
Evidencebased therapies for heavy alcohol use and AUD that leverage motivational, 
behavioural and cognitive strategies to support abstinence and reduced alcohol use should 
be considered. Effect sizes for many of these therapies are moderate to large when 
compared with no treatment or minimal treatment108. Combining behavioural therapies with 
medications for AUD may increase overall treatment effects including reduction in alcohol 
use and AUD symptoms109. Specific therapies with demonstrated efficacy for AUD through 
randomized controlled trials include brief interventions, motivational enhancement therapy, 
cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness-based treatments, behavioural couples therapy, 
community reinforcement approach, contingency management and 12-step facilitation110. 
When manualized, theory-based therapies are compared in head-to-head trials, no 
single approach demonstrates superiority. However, brief interventions and motivational 
enhancement approaches are generally best for those with at-risk drinking or mild AUD, 
whereas more intensive approaches are best for those with moderate-to-severe AUD111. 
Harm reduction therapy approaches also lead to reduction in alcohol use and AUD 
symptoms in randomized controlled trials112,113. Supporting patients in their treatment goals 
is most important for maintaining a collaboration as those patients who initially express an 
interest in drinking reductions tend to transition to abstinence goals.

Time frame for AUD interventions

• Recommendation numbers 14–17—Behavioural treatment approaches can be 
initiated once at-risk drinking or AUD is detected and when a subject is medically stable 
enough to engage in treatment. Although there is no optimal start time for behavioural 
treatment, early intervention is better for prevention of and escalation of use or symptoms. 
In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol-withdrawal syndrome or those who are 
seriously ill requiring intensive medical care, treatment might need to be delayed until the 
medical complications have stabilized. Duration of therapy depends on protocol and type of 
therapy but generally more severe AUD needs more intensive treatment with continuing care 
for long-term recovery. Relapses may require repeated therapy or adaptive interventions that 
increase or decrease intensity based on treatment response.

Statistical considerations

• Recommendation number 18

For all trials, we recommend that investigators obtain accurate and complete data from all 
participants. Before conducting any inferential analyses, the distribution of trial outcomes 
and any covariates should be examined for non-normality and outliers. Non-normal data, 
such as zero inflation, if many people are not drinking and the tendency for skewed 
or bimodal distributions are common in AUD and ALD clinical trials, and appropriate 
transformations or non-parametric approaches should be applied. Outliers can be retained 
or recoded to the next highest or lowest value in the data set. Linear mixed models (for 
normally distributed outcomes) and generalized linear mixed models (for count or binary 
outcomes) are robust methods for examining change in outcomes over time56. Missing data 
are common in AUD and ALD clinical trials. Regulatory agencies currently recommend 
worst-case imputation for missing outcome data (for example, imputing death if mortality 
is the missing outcome; imputing heavy drinking if no heavy drinking days is the missing 
outcome); however, this approach is highly biased, and sensitivity analyses using modern 
missing data methods (for example, maximum likelihood or multiple imputations) are 
recommended as alternatives to single imputation methods114.

Innovative trial and statistical designs

• Recommendation 19—Some features of ALD and AUD make studies challenging 
when considering clinical trial design, implementation and analysis. Heterogeneity in 
disease severity, complex intervention delivery, measurement of both short-term and long-
term outcomes and differences in treatment timing based on disease severity can all 
complicate clinical trial designs.

Adaptive trial designs might address some issues in AUD and ALD research. Adaptive 
design is an umbrella term for designs that allow pre-planned changes based on 
accumulating data115-117. That is, some aspects (aspect) about the trial might change for 
future patients based on data from previous patients. Examples include group sequential 
designs, sample size re-estimation, outcome adaptive randomization and enrichment designs. 
Specifically in AUD and ALD research, group sequential designs include predetermined 
interim analyses that allow the trial to stop early for efficacy, futility or safety, and 
enrichment designs might start with broad eligibility criteria, but modify eligibility criteria 
to enrich the sample for the group whereby the intervention seems most promising. Adaptive 
designs tend to favour interventions with immediate benefit, so other designs, such as the 
sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART)118 designs (described in Box 
3), or more standard designs might be more appropriate if interventions could have a more 
delayed or long-term benefit. In planning phase III trials for marketing, the sponsor should 
submit its statistical analysis plan to regulatory authorities.

Trial safety and regulatory considerations

• Recommendation number 20

In general, the design and conduct of early-phase (phase IIa or proof-of-concept studies) 
clinical trials for drug development in ALD should exclude people with AH and 
decompensated ACLD. Individuals with such decompensation at baseline will likely have 
clinical events that would otherwise be components of clinical efficacy end points40,119. 
However, if investigators want to expand enrolment criteria to also include individuals with 
severe AH or decompensated ACLD, then current advice from regulatory agencies would be 
to conduct hepatic impairment studies before embarking on a phase II or phase III clinical 
study120. If an investigational product (IP) is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, then 
renal impairment studies might be advisable. Hepatic and renal impairment studies should 
be conducted during phase II development or at least before large-scale phase III trials. 
Details for early-phase populations who meet criteria for AUD or heavy drinking (NIAAA 
or CDC) and ALD and clinical end points for early-stage and late-stage drug development 
can be discussed with regulators.

Adverse events

• Recommendation numbers 21–22—AEs are of special concern in individuals with 
conditions that are associated with a high complication rate — the investigator must 
distinguish between events that are most likely caused by the underlying condition (for 
example, ALD), and those that are related to the IP. We recommend standardized reporting 
that includes seriousness, expectedness and relatedness and recommend careful attention to 
AE reporting during site initiation visits. A commonly misunderstood term is ‘possibly 
related’. The timing of an AE in relationship to an IP is important, but not the sole 
determinant in assigning causality. In patients with ACLD and/or AH, the clinical condition 
can worsen owing to infection or other complications. Assigning causality categorically as 
possibly related without direct evidence can be misleading. In therapeutic trials, possibly 
related should be reserved for cases for which no other cause including events commonly 
related to the underlying disease is likely. For example, a patient might have a variceal 
haemorrhage during an infusion; although the temporal relationship is obvious, the event 
could be related to underlying cirrhosis.

Common liver-related AEs.: Three broad categories of liver-related AEs might occur in 
trials of ALD: worsening liver injury and function; development of or worsening of a portal 
hypertension-related hepatic decompensation event or complication thereof; and cascade of 
liver failure leading to multiorgan dysfunction75,121,122.

The degree of elevation of aminotransferase levels in the ALD spectrum is modest and 
generally below 250 IU/l (refs. 40,123). In any of the phenotypes of ALD, a substantial 
worsening of either (aspartate aminotransferase) AST or alanine transaminase (ALT, also 
known as alanine aminotransferase) should raise concern for an additional cause of liver 
injury such as drug-induced liver injury (DILI), ischaemic liver injury or sepsis. An increase 
in the alkaline phosphatase level might also reflect DILI or biliary tract disease such as 
choledocholithiasis or acalculous cholecystitis. Worsening bilirubin and INR (international

normalized ratio) are reflected in the MELD score and can indicate worsening AH or 
acute on chronic liver injury. Underlying sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) can worsen 
hyperbilirubinaemia124-126. Generally, a 5-point127 increase in MELD above baseline is 
considered to reflect worsening AH. Patients with severe AH could have rapid increase in 
MELD related to the development acute kidney injury (AKI-HRS) independent of changes 
in bilirubin or INR. For stable patients with ACLD, an increase in MELD from values 
<12 to >15 might reflect progression of the disease or superimposed injury from alcohol 
or other causes. Given the multiple factors influencing liver enzymes (AST, ALT and 
alkaline phosphatase) and liver function (INR and bilirubin), frequent laboratory monitoring 
is required.

In patients with cACLD, liver decompensation events (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy or 
variceal haemorrhage) are used to assess efficacy of therapy as the incidence of these events 
is expected to be lower than that in control arms. Liver decompensation might be further 
complicated by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome in individuals 
with infections. In decompensated ACLD, further worsening of the severity of the event 
(for example, development of refractory ascites or development of a complication such as 
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) is often noted as part of the natural course of the disease 
and the benefits of therapy can be measured in terms of a reduced incidence in the treatment 
arm.

Liver decompensation can be present at the time of diagnosis of AH or can develop 
during hospitalization40,128. In the absence of a clear imbalance between study arms and 
a biological explanation (such as sepsis) in those receiving immunosuppressive therapy 
for AH, it might be challenging to attribute decompensatory events, or the lack thereof to 
study intervention. Because there is no reliable diagnostic test for DILI, expert opinion is 
needed to evaluate available data to distinguish DILI from worsening of underlying ALD. 
The cascade of progressive liver decompensation leading to multiorgan dysfunction is well 
recognized75,122,129. Worsening multiorgan dysfunction often leads to need for intensive 
care, renal replacement therapy, pressor and ventilatory support. Such interventions indicate 
a marked deterioration of clinical status and should be reported. They are particularly 
relevant for ACLD and AH trials and could be considered as ‘events of special interest’.

Common alcohol-related AEs.: AUD is a complex illness with multiple organ effects. 
The study team needs to monitor alcohol use and be ready to manage alcohol-withdrawal 
syndrome81. Relatedness of AEs (that is, possibly, probably and definitely related) to study 
medication and study interventions is needed for both pharmacotherapy and behavioural 
treatment trials. In practice, separating alcohol-related AEs from liver-related AEs can be 
difficult. Safety monitoring can alert investigators to complications from alcohol use and 
the evaluation should include physical examinations including weight and body composition 
given the frequency and rate of muscle loss or sarcopenia in these individuals130. Monitoring 
for pregnancy in people of childbearing age must be in place and advice regarding avoidance 
of pregnancy must be pre-specified before initiating any clinical intervention. Follow-up 
monitoring can be tailored to the study but needs to account for frequent AEs in patients 
with AUD. Immunological complications can include a chronic pro-inflammatory response 
with bone marrow suppression (granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia)131,132 that makes

patients with AUD vulnerable to infections133. Folate deficiency was reported in 23% of 
men drinking an average of 160 g per day (ref. 134). Other micronutrient deficiencies and 
zinc and their complications are also common135. The relative risk of atrial fibrillation 
is increased (1.36; 95% CI (127–146)) in individuals drinking ≥48 g per day136, and 
the relative risk of hypertension is also increased 2.64 (95% CI 2.14–3.26) in Asian 
individuals and 1.81 (95% CI 1.14–2.86) in non-Asian individuals drinking ≥100 g per 
day (ref. 137). Alcohol-related cardiomyopathy was reported to account for 6.3% of all 
cardiomyopathies in 2015, but the issue of whether alcohol causes cardiomyopathy is a 
subject of controversy138-141. Gastrointestinal complications separate from liver damage 
can include gastritis, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding (of many aetiologies) and 
gastrointestinal cancers142,143. Finally, central nervous system complications include risk 
of head trauma and bleeding, brain atrophy and cognitive impairments including Wernicke–
Korsakoff syndrome, neuropathies, mood, anxiety and sleep disturbances144.

Assessment of hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.: Alcohol use is a potential risk 
factor and pre-existing liver disease is associated with worse outcomes in patients with 
idiosyncratic DILI145,146. The diagnosis of DILI or drug-induced kidney injury can be 
particularly challenging in the presence of severe AH or decompensated ALD when baseline 
elevations in liver tests and serum creatinine are present. The MELD score147 stratifies 
severity of AH and ACLD, but is also a predictor of mortality in patients with DILI148-150.

In trials that exclude participants with ACLD, unexplained elevation in the levels of AST or 
ALT ≥3 times baseline or ≥3 times higher than in the control group; or AST >500 U/l; or 
stage ≥ 1 AKI (increase in the serum creatinine level >0.3 mg/dl (22.88 μmol) within 48 h) 
is an indication to hold the drug even in the absence of an increase in bilirubin or INR until 
further adjudication151. The degree of renal dysfunction (stages of AKI) is defined: stage 1, 
increase in serum creatinine by greater than 0.3 mg/dl within 48 h or to 1.5 times baseline 
or urine volume <0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 h; stage 2 (2.0–2.9 times serum creatinine increase from 
baseline or urine output <0.5 ml/kg/h for ≥12 h); and stage 3 (serum creatinine ≥3 times 
baseline or urine output <0.3 ml/kg/h for ≥24 h or anuria for >12 h)152.

Given unanticipated changes and potential decompensation events, clinical trials should 
incorporate pre-specified safety parameters to guide site investigators including, but 
not limited to, enhanced laboratory testing, imaging modalities, dose-reduction and 
drugdiscontinuation parameters. These pre-specified guidelines are important components 
to the development of individual stopping rules. Large-scale trials should include an 
independent, blinded hepatic safety adjudication committee that meets frequently to 
adjudicate AEs of special interest and potential signals of DILI and report their findings 
to an unblinded data monitoring committee and the sponsor (sponsors) of the trial153.

Stopping rules and data safety monitoring board

• Recommendation numbers 23–25—Two types of stopping rules should be 
incorporated into the study protocol: trial stopping rules (for the entire cohort based on 
unexpected harm or clear demonstration of benefit) and individual stopping rules (because 
of serious AEs in the individual). Inclusion of study stopping rules could enhance study

safety and efficacy by allowing early termination for either positive (primary end point 
reached) or negative (likely futility or excessive harm) outcomes. Adaptive study designs 
that use interim analyses to drop inferior treatment arms or stop a trial early might benefit 
both study sponsors (reduced study time and costs) and participants (reduced harm including 
eliminating an inferior therapeutic agent or placebo if treatment is effective). However, 
interim analyses have statistical implications that must be considered at the start of the trial.

Oversight by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) whose members are knowledgeable 
about the natural history of ALD is essential. In trials involving ALD and/or AUD, trial 
stopping rules based on excessive harm indicated by a statistically significant imbalance 
between study arms in the following: death, liver transplantation or palliative care measured 
over a finite period of time (for example, 1–12 months) depending on the acuity of the 
condition (acute versus chronic), duration of study drug administration and potential for 
delayed consequences of drug exposure; evidence of serious organ damage (hepatotoxicity, 
nephrotoxicity, cardiopulmonary and haematological toxicity); mechanism-based adverse 
effects (for example, infections in the case of immunomodulatory drugs); and excessive 
suicidality and neurocognitive events. Participant heterogeneity and potential concurrent 
alcohol use can influence study outcomes and therefore necessitate robust consideration 
of confounders in any stopping decision. This aspect is particularly relevant in stopping 
rules for futility in which early termination of the study based on interim results might 
limit identification of benefits with longer-term follow-up or within specific subgroups of 
individuals with ALD and AUD. Hence, although serial measures of alcohol and/or illicit 
drug use are integral to the assessment of treatment of AUD in therapeutic studies for ALD, 
these data should be closed to the study personnel but made available to the DSMB. Any 
decision to halt a study based on stopping rules should include review by this committee.

In most clinical studies, one grade 5 serious AEs (SAEs), two grade 4 SAEs or three 
grade 3 SAEs mandate pausing a study until the DSMB adjudicates the event (events) 
and determines causality154,155. However, the high mortality of decompensated ACLD or 
AH that makes survival a good study end point can also hinder trial execution. Stopping 
for any death would likely lead to frequent enrolment delays, treatment interruptions 
and hindrance of DSMB causality assessments. Thus, the sponsor might need to rely on 
site investigator assessments to avoid repeated pauses awaiting DSMB adjudication. For 
example, the clinical trial could be paused for DSMB assessment only if the site investigator 
concludes that the death is not related to decompensated ACLD with ACLF, or severe 
AH. To facilitate accurate death attribution, site investigators and the DSMB should be 
well versed in disease course, the mechanism of action of the study drug and results of 
hepatic and renal impairment studies before embarking on a phase II or III clinical study. 
Alternatively, a sponsor could choose to use a suspected unexpected severe adverse reaction 
to reframe the typical trial stopping rules as listed previously.

In most instances, a trial will benefit from the creation of a separate hepatic safety 
adjudication committee that conducts adjudication in a blinded manner and reports to the 
unblinded DSMB. By contrast, the DSMB is unblinded to data and might find that an 
event occurred in the placebo arm and not the treatment arm. The hepatic safety committee

should adjudicate AEs of special interest and potential signals of DILI. For these situations, 
independent hepatologists with expertise in DILI adjudication are necessary.

Individual stopping rules

• Recommendation number 26—Individual stopping rules should be in place to hold 
and/or discontinue investigational drug treatment in patients with evidence of infections 
refractory to treatment, an increase in levels of AST >500 or ALT >400 without alternative 
explanation, development of liver failure characterized by rising bilirubin levels, worsening 
coagulopathy or the development of AKI (greater than stage 2 with increase in the 
serum creatinine level 2.0–2.9 times baseline) with hepatorenal physiology (HRS-AKI) 
during further evaluation and adjudication. In 2021, an expert consensus panel (IQ-DILI) 
recommended that an investigational drug should be held and the possibility of DILI should 
be investigated in participants with an increase in MELD >5 over baseline if baseline MELD 
is ≤12 and an increase >3 if baseline MELD is >12 (ref. 153). These recommendations were 
made for patients with ACLD owing to hepatitis C virus infection, hepatitis B virus infection 
and MASLD, but not specifically alcohol153. In patients with decompensated ACLD or 
severe AH, challenges arise in discerning causality and how to apply individual stopping 
rules. Individual stopping rules should consider that HRS-AKI develops as a consequence 
of infection, overuse of diuretics, iodinated contrast dye, exposure to known nephrotoxic 
drugs and as part of the natural history of advanced liver disease. For these reasons, the 
expertise of an independent blinded safety assessment committee is critical to review data 
and adjudicate causality.

Challenges and future directions

Recruitment and retention

• Recommendation number 27—Recruitment and retention present some of the most 
notable challenges in the success of clinical trials. By some estimates, over half of all 
clinical trials failed to meet their recruitment targets within the allocated time, whereas 
others fell short of retention goals156-162. This issue has been of particular concern for 
ALD clinical trials, in which low recruitment and retention rates have been problematic, 
resulting in prolonged study timelines, biased study samples, questionable conclusions and, 
ultimately, a failed investigation157,163,164.

ALD investigators are also confronted with challenges unique to the ALD population. 
Especially among those with advanced ALD, advanced illness with acute symptoms, feeling 
too ill to participate in or lacking motivation to participate in clinical studies and being 
physically and emotionally vulnerable are patient-related factors that contribute to poor 
recruitment and retention rates. Recognized logistical barriers to recruitment in populations 
with alcohol and substance use disorders include a lack of one or more of the following: 
transportation, medical insurance, social support and a stable living environment165.

An analysis, published in 2024 of recruitment and retention by the Alcoholic Hepatitis 
Network (AlcHepNet) using an observational cohort that enrolled 465 patients with AH, 
168 individuals with heavy drinking without liver disease and 119 healthy volunteers and

a randomized clinical trial that enrolled 147 patients with severe AH, provides strategies to 
improve patient recruitment and retention in populations with ALD by reducing modifiable 
barriers while providing objective criteria to measure site performance in clinical trials, as 
detailed166 (Table 5).

Future studies

• Recommendation number 28—Integrated care in the clinical setting is an 
interdisciplinary process that relies heavily on the performance of key coordinated care 
tasks within teams; the relationships in these teams are built on a foundation of good 
communication, mutual respect, shared goals and shared knowledge167-169. Integrated care, 
sometimes referred to as coordinated care, is beneficial and necessary at the intersection of 
both medical and mental health disorders that are often comorbid with ALD (for example, 
obesity) and AUD (for example, substance use disorder, depression, anxiety disorders and 
post-traumatic stress disorder), respectively.

Potential limitations

Many of the recommendations in this manuscript are based on a consensus of expert 
opinions drawn both from interpretation of the literature and from personal experience. In 
some instances, the empirical evidence to support these recommendations is incomplete. 
For example, definitions of heavy drinking (NIAAA/CDC) and WHO risk categories of 
drinking were developed between 2000 and 2005 for men and women without attention 
to the possibility of gender identification or sex reassignment, both of which often involve 
hormonal treatment that could affect metabolism of ethanol and/or patterns of consumption. 
Future studies will need to clarify gender and sex at birth to provide a more complete 
view of how these parameters may affect outcomes. These recommendations are based on 
literature and experiences that are limited in the diversity of patient demographics, practice 
settings (most often academic medical centres), pharmacotherapy options for reducing 
alcohol consumption in patients with ACLD, input from patient representatives and other 
stakeholders and geographic distribution of the experts who participated in the task force. 
The members of the task force were mostly from North America with a few from Europe 
and the UK; there were no members from Asia, South America, Australia or Africa. 
The task force did not use the Delphi method or other formal processes for anonymous 
voting on the recommendations. The process was based on the NIH consensus development 
programme as revised by the Institute of Medicine (now National Academy of Medicine 
USA)13. Ongoing discussion among experts in ALD and AUD, patient representatives and 
members of the pharmaceutical industry as well as regulatory agencies such as FDA and 
European Medicines Agency will enhance the development of new and more effective 
treatments for alcohol-associated liver disease.

Conclusions

Observational studies show that heavy drinking after a diagnosis of ALD increases all-cause 
mortality8 and that abstinence improves survival and liver-related outcomes5,9,10. Despite 
this evidence, few clinical trials have been conducted to confirm these observations. The 
28 recommendations approved by the task force organized by the NIAAA represent a

consensus of expert opinions to guide the design of clinical trials to study the effects of 
alcohol use and AUD on clinical outcomes in patients with ALD. We recommend integrating 
research experts from hepatology and addiction medicine to ensure multidisciplinary 
representation on the research team. Inclusion of addiction medicine experts to ALD 
research teams enables accurate selection of key measures for alcohol use and AUD 
symptoms and for accurate reporting of key alcohol and AUD-related outcomes. Careful 
measurement of alcohol consumption before and during clinical trials in all patients with 
steatotic liver disease is necessary given the deleterious and potentially confounding effects 
of alcohol on liver-related outcomes5,9,10. The recommendations also include assessing 
cardiometabolic risk factors for SLD and tailoring inclusion and exclusion criteria according 
to the stage of liver disease. During the trial, careful monitoring and adjudication of AEs 
by a separate hepatic safety committee with well-defined individual and study stopping 
rules are strongly encouraged. Finally, addressing stigma and developing other strategies are 
necessary to improve recruitment and retention to ensure validity and generalizability of the 
findings.

Trials should include male, female and transgender or gender-diverse people 
aged 18 years or above. Gender identity should also be noted.

Trials in which the intervention targets reduction or elimination of alcohol use 
should enrol patients with ALD who have been drinking alcohol regularly at 
levels above 140 g per week or more for female participants and 210 g per 
week or more for male participants.

Trials in which the intervention targets the liver without intended effects on 
alcohol consumption should stratify participants based on levels of alcohol 
consumption to avoid confounding.

non-melanoma skin cancer, cardiovascular, lung, kidney diseases, acute 
pancreatitis, haemodynamic instability requiring pressors) with thresholds for 
exclusion dependent on the specific trial.

Presence of severe mental illness and/or suicidal ideation that requires a 
higher level of care or is unstable at the time of enrolment. Patients with 
major depressive disorder can be considered depending on the stability and 
duration of their current treatment regimen.

Some studies may require toxicology that is negative for opioids, 
cocaine, amphetamines, propoxyphenes and barbiturates, depending 
on the study design, type of intervention and balancing of internal 
versus external validity

Tobacco and/or cannabis use is common and should be recorded but 
not excluded to improve generalizability of findings

Current use of certain psychotropic medications that could significantly 
interact or interfere with behavioural and/or cognitive therapies and/or 
pharmacotherapies being tested.

Depending on the trial goals and end points, it might also be important to 
exclude individuals with recent alcohol-use disorder treatment who might 
have already stopped or substantially reduced their drinking.

Patients with model for end-stage liver disease score (MELD) >30 have very 
poor prognosis and should be excluded from early-phase studies40.

Recent previous exposure to experimental therapies (for example, in the past 
3 months or other time frame decided in the specific trial).

a Non-invasive tests with cut-offs listed all have >50% positive predictive value, >85% 
negative predictive value and >85% specificity to determine stage ≥3 fibrosis among 
patients with ALD using liver biopsy as the gold standard32,33,38,39. bLiver biopsy should 
be performed as standard of care in patients with possible AH or AH with confounding 
factors such as possible ischaemic hepatitis, possible DILI, uncertain history of alcohol 
use (that is, patient denies hazardous alcohol use) and atypical/abnormal laboratory tests 
(for example, AST <50 IU/l or >400 IU/l, AST/ALT ratio < 1.5), antinuclear antibody 
>1:160 or smooth muscle antibody >1:80, to confirm AH and to exclude competing 
aetiologies.

Opportunities and challenges in the use of SMART design for alcohol use 
disorder or alcohol-related liver disease trials

Opportunities

•

•

•

•

•

•

Assess treatment interactions (for example, synergies).

Address multidisciplinary, integrated treatment approaches.

Follow-up interventions can be given for non-responders.

Address short-term and long-term outcomes.

Answer questions regarding timing of treatment.

Tailor treatment based on baseline or time-varying patient and/or disease 
characteristics.

Challenges

•

•

•

•

•

Death or drop out from one or both stages can cause missing data issues and 
require appropriate end point definition.

Sample size depends on primary aim, which may or may not be larger than a 
standard one stage trial.

Highly suggested to have those with sequential, multiple assignment, 
randomized trial (SMART) design experience to be on the team.

Does not include placebo-inactive treatment (looks at effectiveness, not 
efficacy).

Greater complexity of design might require more pre-trial planning, pilot 
study data.

The level of alcohol consumption in gram per week is shown for male (blue) and female 
(pink) individuals according to the multisociety Delphi consensus statement by Rinella 
et al. (2023)26 for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), 
MASLD and increased alcohol intake (MetALD) and alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) 
in comparison to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) heavy

Alcohol use should be quantified based on the number of standard drinks and converted to grams of ethanol to provide global 
uniformity and comparability of research studies. Frequency and duration of drinking should be assessed, including change over 
time to capture remote and recent use (Table 2)

For clinical trial design, we recommend using DSM-5 criteria to diagnose AUD17 or ICD-11 criteria for alcohol dependence18

Considering the high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with ALD, for the purposes of clinical trials, populations 
with ALD should include both patients with and without these known cardiometabolic risk factors, recognizing that the relative 
contribution of metabolic risk factors versus alcohol intake to SLD might vary from individual to individual. These cardiometabolic 
risk factors should be carefully assessed in clinical trials

For clinical trial design focusing on the effect of alcohol use on progression of SLD, we recommend a threshold of drinking for 
women as 140 g or more per week and for men as 210 g or more per week over an extended period. These amounts are above the 
WHO low-risk level of drinking for female individuals and above the NIAAA level of heavy drinking for male individuals23 and 
correspond to the threshold for MetALD. MetALD refers to individuals with SLD who have cardiometabolic risk factor (factors) 
and consume greater amounts of alcohol per week (threshold of drinking for women as 140–350 g per week and for men as 
210–420 g per week)26 (Fig. 1)

For the purposes of clinical trial design, we recommend utilizing the term ‘advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD)’ to include 
patients with MetALD and ALD with stage 3–4 fibrosis

For clinical trial design, patients with MetALD and ALD must be classified into distinct subpopulations that can be linked to 
indications for regulatory approval of drugs: early-stage ALD without advanced fibrosis; compensated advanced chronic liver 
disease (cACLD); decompensated ALD and alcohol-associated hepatitis

When conducting clinical trials in AUD and/or ALD, we recommend measuring stigma and discussing ways to reduce stigma with 
all team members (e.g., using person first language, recognizing that both AUD and ALD are treatable conditions)44,45

Minimum data set

8

9

10

11

Demographic data such as age, biological sex, gender identity, race, family history of AUD and ALD and ethnicity should be 
included

Metabolic comorbidities such as weight, height, body mass index, waist–hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, 
waist circumference, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and HbA1c should be included

Biomarkers as noted in Box 1 should be used for identifying stage of disease, safety and response considerations for therapeutic 
interventions, and trial end points in terms of liver function trajectory in response to treatment, as these are crucial components for a 
clinical trial

Given the influence of genetic factors that modify risk of fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis in patients with ALD, future clinical 
trials in patients with early-stage ALD and cACLD should consider stratifying patients to balance the study populations according 
to known genetic risk factors

Trial components

12

13

Inclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical trials should be tailored to the subpopulation of ALD as detailed in Box 2

End points for clinical trials should be clinically meaningful in the context of the stage of disease and the phase of clinical 
development (as detailed in Table 4)

Treatment considerations

14

15

16

17

Any drug trial that involves participants with ALD, irrespective of the drug target, should account for potential alterations in 
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics owing to the potential effects of both alcohol consumption and ACLD

Trials for ALD should acknowledge explicitly the benefits of abstinence and reduction in drinking and the potential need for alcohol 
treatment. Brief motivational interviewing for reducing heavy drinking should be offered with few exceptions

AUD treatment strategies should be tailored to the severity of AUD: brief interventions and motivational enhancement are generally 
best for those with at-risk drinking or mild AUD, whereas more intensive treatments are best for those with moderate-to-severe 
AUD

For clinical trials in ALD, particularly those testing distinct AUD treatment (treatments) or those that will provide standardized 
intervention for alcohol use as part of the protocol, any such treatments including pharmacological, behavioural or cognitive 
therapies should be pre-specified in the protocol with stratified results if more than one treatment modality for AUD is pre-specified

Number Recommendation

18

19

Non-normal data are common in AUD and ALD clinical trials, and appropriate transformations or non-parametric approaches 
should be applied. Robust statistical models should be used to assess outcomes over time. Modern missing data methods are 
recommended for sensitivity analyses

In AUD and ALD research, innovative trial designs should be considered, including group sequential designs include predetermined 
interim analyses that allow the trial to stop early for efficacy, futility or safety, and enrichment designs may start with broad 
eligibility criteria, but modify eligibility criteria to enrich the sample for the group in which the intervention seems most promising

Trial safety and regulatory considerations

20

21

22

Early-phase clinical trials for new drug development should exclude individuals with alcohol-associated hepatitis and 
decompensated ACLD

Standardized reporting of adverse events that include seriousness, expectedness and relatedness should be required while avoiding 
the conclusion that ‘any event is possibly related’ when determining whether an event is related to the investigational product or 
intervention

Adverse events are of special concern in individuals with conditions that are associated with a high complication rate — the 
investigator must distinguish between events that are most likely caused by the underlying condition (e.g., ALD), and those that are 
related to the investigational product

Trial safety and regulatory considerations (continued)

23

24

25

26

Oversight by a DSMB whose members are knowledgeable about the natural history of ALD is essential

A separate hepatic safety adjudication committee that conducts adjudication in a blinded manner and reports to the DSMB should 
be utilized in adjudicating the diagnosis of DILI or drug-induced kidney injury in the presence of severe alcohol-associated hepatitis 
or decompensated ACLD when there is baseline elevation in the liver tests and serum creatinine concentrations

Inclusion of study stopping rules might enhance study safety and efficacy by allowing early termination for either positive (primary 
end point reached) or negative (likely futility or excessive harm) outcomes

Individual stopping rules should be in place to hold and/or discontinue investigational drug treatment in patients with evidence of 
infections refractory to treatment, an increase in level of AST >500 or ALT >400 without alternative explanation, development 
of liver failure characterized by rising bilirubin, worsening coagulopathy or the development of AKI with hepatorenal physiology 
during further evaluation and adjudication

Challenges and future directions

27

28

Strategies should be developed for both recruitment and retention (Table 5) to improve the validity, reproducibility and applicability 
of clinical trials for AUD and ALD

Future studies designed to address heavy drinking and AUD in patients with ALD should include addiction medicine experts as well 
as hepatologists to assist in selecting key measures for alcohol use and incorporating methods and outcomes from both AUD and 
ALD research arenas to achieve the highest quality studies

Urinary EtG and 
EtS

PEth

Advantages

Limitations

Outcome measures

Can corroborate self-report over past 
2–4 days
Longer detection window than 
measurement of ethanol
Readily available through most 
laboratories
Good sensitivity and specificity: 
detects very small amounts

High sensitivity and specificity
Allows detection of drinking after 3–
4 weeks after alcohol cessation in 
daily users
Minimal and/or unintentional 
exposure does not result in positive 
value
Liver disease does not impair 
formation of PEth
Can detect under-reporting or 
inaccurately self-reported alcohol use

Semi-quantitative, which limits measuring 
reduction in drinking
Detection window varies by amount consumed 
and timing of sample
Urine sample is subject to tampering
Incidental exposure can cause positive EtS 
levels
Affected by renal function so might be less 
accurate in those with renal failure

Expensive
Not available at many medical centre 
laboratories, might need to be sent out to 
specialty laboratory for processing
Liver disease can prolong PEth elimination, 
causing a longer detection window after 
cessation of use
Single high ethanol intake (binge) will not 
create detectable PEth

Positive values indicate recent 
use (past 2–4 days) but 
quantification is difficult 
without knowing timing of 
consumption

Interpretive guidelines for 
PEth levels allow categorizing 
levels of regular consumption 
corresponding to WHO low, 
medium and high risk 
drinkinga

Hair sampling to 
measure 
EtG170-172

Long period of detection (up to 90 
days)
Can be used if window of detection 
missed for blood or urine samples
Can be used as a quantitative 
indicator of alcohol use and 
interpretive guidelines exist for 
chronic excessive consumption
Has potential to support self-reported 
abstinence up to 90 days

Better for chronic use, days to months
Might miss low levels of consumption
Costly and requires special laboratory for 
processing
Special sample collection technique at 
scalp, some participants might worry about 
appearance of hair removal
Can be contaminated by hair products
Sample processing can markedly influence 
results

Positive result indicates some 
alcohol consumption. Heavy 
drinkers are differentiated 
from non-drinkers and light 
drinkers with a cut-off for 
EtG in hair (30 pg/mg 
scalp hair) to suggest chronic 
consumption (>60 g per day 
ethanol per day for several 
months)

Real-time assessments: breathalyser monitoring system and biosensors

Breathalysers for 
repeated real-
time use

Wearable 
alcohol 
biosensors

High sensitivity and specificity
Breathalysers can be set for random 
or scheduled testing
Can take pictures or voice 
recognition, video of person while 
testing
Can link to a secured internet portal 
for real-time data collection
Monitoring systems provide wireless, 
real-time blood alcohol content 
monitoring system with internet 
connectivity

High sensitivity and specificity
Can provide detailed virtually 
continuous data on alcohol use over 
period device is worn
Security features provide information 
on whether device was worn (e.g., 
proximity sensors)
Extensive data for analysis

Real-time blood alcohol 
content monitoring systems 
are capable of detecting 
alcohol for several hours after 
a drinking event
Several tests per day cover 
more than half a 24 h period

Virtually continuous values 
of estimated blood alcohol 
concentration allow creation 
of unlimited alcohol use 
outcomes along parameters 
of quantity, frequency and 
duration of use

As a single-use point-of-care measure, a 
breathalyser will only capture recent use
Some devices require the use of a personal 
smartphone
Participants might find use of breathalyser 
embarrassing if privacy cannot be maintained
More complex data for management and 
analysis
Requires high level of compliance by 
participant, poor compliance causes data loss
Costly and resource-intensive
Requires maintenance and device calibration

Requires high level of compliance by 
participant, poor compliance causes data loss
Costly and resource-intensive
Some devices might be uncomfortable to wear 
or cause embarrassment
Requires maintenance and might be easily 
damaged in real-world settings causing data loss
Some sensors require participants to be 
responsible for charging devices and uploading 
data
Some devices require WiFi access
Some devices made for law enforcement 
are locked on and cannot be removed by

Recruitment and retention

Challenge

Approach

Table 5 ∣

Screening: time consuming 
for research coordinators/
study personnel

Research team turnover

Patient motivation

Passive: electronic medical record algorithms, mailings, advertisements
Active: engagement of clinical groups, minimize practicing clinician burden; effect of first contact is critical

Active engagement by Principal Investigator and Co-investigator (reduce burden on research coordinators)
Data entry is burdensome — simplify, data entry operators (locally or central)
Regular scheduled meetings with research teams, daily scheduled early morning meeting
Funding consistency
Research coordinator fatigue and/or turnover translates into patient disengagement

Simplify or modify study design to decrease patient and Research Coordinator burden
Transportation (rideshare or taxi)
Research visits to be coordinated with clinical standard of care visits
Provide care beyond only research
Study compensation — more than only financial (e.g., transportation, childcare responsibilities, care of other 
family members)

Increase patient catchment 
pool

Community practices
Area hospitals
Other clinical research groups
Substance use disorder clinic engagement

Research education of 
families

Critical component is to ensure families are engaged
