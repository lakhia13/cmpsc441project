Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has become a critical public health issue that affects
more than 78 million people. In many recent studies, the authors have demonstrated that equine-
assisted activities and therapies (EAATs) can substantially improve the social and behavioral skills of
children with ASD. However, the qualities of the studies differ, and some authors reached opposite
conclusions. In this review, we systematically and objectively examined the effectiveness of EAATs for
people with ASD, combining both qualitative and quantitative methods. We searched ﬁve databases
(PubMed, Scopus, ERIC, ProQuest, and MEDLINE) and added relevant references, and we identiﬁed
25 articles for data extraction and analysis. According to our results, EAAT programs can substantially
improve the social and behavioral functioning and language abilities of children with ASD. However,
among the subdomains, the results were inconsistent. According to the meta-analyses, there were
considerable improvements in the social cognition, communication, irritability, and hyperactivity
domains, but not in the domains of social awareness, mannerisms, motivation, lethargy, stereotypy,
or inappropriate speech. Moreover, there was a lack of sufﬁcient comparative data to conclude that
EAAT programs lead to substantial improvements in motor and sensory functioning. In addition,
among the included studies, we noted the indicator of whether EAAT programs decreased parental
stress and improved family functioning, and although there were four articles in which the researchers
considered this aspect, we were unable to draw any conclusions because of the insufﬁcient data and
conﬂicting descriptive evidence. However, we need to consider the improvement in parental mental
health as a factor in the effectiveness of this complementary intervention. We hope that in future
studies, researchers will focus on family functioning and conduct more randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) with blinded assessments using different scales and measures.

1. Introduction
1.1. ASD

Over the past half-century, the prevalence of ASD has dramatically increased [1].
Currently, ASD affects more than 78 million people worldwide, and it has become a critical
public health issue [2]. ASD is a restricted, lifelong, innate, and complex neurodevelopmen-
tal disorder that hampers social interactions, cognitive functioning, and perceptual abilities,
and it has a high incidence of associated mental retardation issues that can even cause
individuals to die by suicide [3,4]. Individuals with ASD frequently exhibit a clinically
heterogeneous and considerable proportion of uncontrollable repetitive patterns, emotional

dysfunction, and reduced verbal and nonverbal communication during interactions, in-
cluding less eye contact and body language [5]. Thus, people with ASD are more likely
to struggle with multiple communicative and cognitive comorbidities that prevent them
from strengthening relationships with others, which results in detrimental social relation-
ships when compared with those of their typically developing peers or people with other
psychopathologies [6,7].

Meanwhile, due to the difﬁculty of self-managing emotions, impaired self-regulation
is a predisposition that is inherent in ASD [8] and that can lead to individuals with ASD
experiencing more emotion-related problems in daily life than their non-autistic peers
(e.g., symptoms of anxiety, depression, aggression, irritability, hyperactivity, rule-breaking,
elopement, sensory processing, and sleep) [9–11]. Furthermore, individuals with ASD tend
to be less adept at employing emotional strategies to self-manage emotion due to their
difﬁculties forming and maintaining friendships, poor academic performances, and partici-
pation in social activities, which include experiences such as bullying and exclusion [12–14].
These core symptoms frequently persist after childhood and co-occur in adolescence and
adulthood [15]. In particular, in a recent study, the authors revealed that there is an in-
creased probability of additional co-occurring symptoms in children with autism, most
typically attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional deﬁant disorder
(ODD), and anxiety [16].

The difﬁculties that autistic people present also impact family members, particularly
parents. According to a 2012 study, the parents of autistic children face more mental health
difﬁculties than other parents [17]. Although parent perspectives are critical in understand-
ing the impacts and processes of ASD interventions [18], parents struggle to choose from
the many treatment options [19], which complicates the care for people with ASD.

1.2. Therapies for ASD

Therefore, the development of an effective treatment has been given priority in this area
for individuals with ASD. In recent years, some researchers have shown that the genetic,
immunological, environmental, and epigenetic factors are the most important factors in
the development and progression of ASD [20]. Researchers try to look for effective and
efﬁcient approaches to treating ASD based on pathophysiology and syndromes, typically
focusing on six primary areas: (1) sensory integration and sensory-based interventions;
(2) relationship-based interactive interventions; (3) skill-based developmental programs;
(4) social cognitive skills training; (5) parent-directed or parent-mediated approaches;
(6) intensive behavioral interventions [2,21]. Following decades of research, conventional
interventions have increasingly become concerned with fostering a positive environment for
social engagement and self-regulation in people with ASD, attenuating the negative effects
of autistic traits, and enhancing the quality of life and wellbeing in the ASD population [22].
Meanwhile, since ASD is a multifactorial disease, numerous treatment options have become
available, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) may increasingly be used
alongside classical medical practices to treat ASD [23–25]. Among the most popular and
successful forms of CAM were swimming, music therapy, art therapy, and animal-assisted
interventions (AAIs) [25].

1.3. Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAIs) for ASD

Under the inﬂuence of these studies, AAIs have entered the ﬁeld of vision of re-
searchers, and it is one of the most promising areas for remediating the core impairments
of people with ASD [26,27]. AAIs include a variety of animals, such as dogs, horses,
rabbits, dolphins, guinea pigs, and llamas, and incorporating animals into therapeutic
treatments appears to effectively decrease the problematic behaviors and improve social
communication for ASD populations [28]. In numerous emerging studies in recent years,
researchers have laid the groundwork for the use of AAIs to assist individuals with ASD in
regulating their emotions, improving their cognitive domains and social communication

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2630

functioning, engaging in prosocial actions, and reducing maladaptive repetitive behaviors
that are associated with stress [28–33].

1.4. EAATs for ASD

EAATs can help people with autism, cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, multiple
sclerosis (MS), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), among other conditions [34,35].
Of all the animal-assisted therapies for ASD, the EAAT program is the most widely uti-
lized [36]. In a 2018 study [37], the authors found that 10% of the parents of children with
ASD have used therapies or interventions that include horses, which could be because
EAATs have beneﬁts that are different from those of other animal-assisted therapies. In
three studies [38–40], the authors noted that the rhythmic movements of horseback riding
can especially activate the vestibular systems of children with ASD, which can enhance
their speech production and improve their learning outcomes. Riders have to actively
manage their own body behaviors, which promotes their capacities for voluntary control
and nonverbal communication. Another analysis revealed that the hippotherapy (HIP)
exercises had a beneﬁcial effect on postural control, interpersonal relationships, and adap-
tive behaviors [41]. Therefore, horses can offer people with ASD a special way of fostering
positive social engagement [32]. Other researchers [28,40,42,43] have offered another in-
sight: that the effects of horseback riding interventions might be optimally shaped by the
relationship that forms over time between all humans and horses in groups, including a
series of training steps and an accumulation of stimuli to elicit social interaction. From
the same perspective, occupational therapists frequently employ “catalyst techniques” to
increase arousal emotions, which contributes to behavioral and multisensory perception
improvements [28,44,45]. In summary, because these interventions created upbeat and
happy environments and provided multisensory stimulation, the beneﬁts of horseback
riding for people with ASD were enhanced. Equine-assisted interventions (EAIs) for ASD
are rapidly increasing as a complementary therapy for ASD [32,36].

EAIs are programs that incorporate horses to provide rehabilitative and educational
beneﬁts to the participants [46]. EAIs are typically referred to as EAATs, and they include
two main types of interventions: (1) equine-assisted therapies (EATs), which include hip-
potherapy (HIP) and equine-assisted psychotherapy (EAP), and equine-assisted activities
(EAAs), which include therapeutic horseback riding (THR) [42]. Each method has a dif-
ferent speciﬁc therapeutic focus [47]. The fundamental and core idea behind THR is to
engage people with ASD in horseback riding and nonriding activities (Barn activities, such
as cleaning the barn, feeding horses, and watching the horses’ motions) with licensed
instructors, counselors, or equestrians who teach them horsemanship skills that target
improving their physical, behavioral, and prosocial health [38]. Hippotherapy utilizes
occupational or physical therapy exercises by using the horse’s movements to improve the
engagement of the sensory, neuromotor, and cognitive systems to improve the functional
outcomes. Equine-assisted occupational therapy (EAOT), therapeutic riding (TR), and
equine-facilitated learning (EFL) are a few of the other common terms. Notably, as opposed
to EATs and HIP, equine-facilitated learning (EFL) is a distinct experiential learning tech-
nique that blends learning abilities and interaction with horses (ponies, miniature horses,
donkeys, and mules) with individual therapy and emotional regulation to strengthen
children’s awareness and control of their emotions, cognition, and behavior [48].

1.5. Relevance

In numerous studies, researchers have demonstrated that the participation of autistic
people in therapeutic horseback riding programs improves their social interaction, so-
cialization, and stereotyping behaviors. However, these therapies and interventions still
need to be improved [29,49], and the extent to which these improvements occur, as well as
whether the involvement duration and type of treatment have an impact on the treatment
outcome, have not been thoroughly investigated [49]. Thus, in this review, we attempted to
evaluate a number of aspects that inﬂuence how well the treatments work. Our primary

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2630

objective was to use Sackett’s level of evidence, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database
(PEDro) scale, and forest plots to evaluate the viability of the conclusions of all the included
studies to better understand how EAATs affect the individual domains, such as the social,
communicative, and behavioral abilities, as well as more the general functional outcomes,
such as family functioning and quality of life. Our second objective was to assess whether
the adjuvant therapy had a lasting effect after the horse intervention ended.

2. Methods
2.1. Search Protocol and Procedure
2.1.1. Eligibility Criteria

To build upon the detailed, exact, and comprehensive reviews, our methodology for
this systematic literature review followed the meta-analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines [50]
and PROSPERO registration requirements (CRD42022363685). We screened the studies
based on the following search terms and their variants and synonyms: autism spectrum
disorder and equine-assisted activities and therapies (see Appendix A.1 for details). More-
over, to ensure the inclusion of all apt and precise articles that fulﬁlled the requirements,
two authors simultaneously independently screened the publications based on the same
eligibility criteria (see Table 1 for details). After screening all the included articles, a third
author independently compared the studies screened by the ﬁrst two authors. If the two
authors had different opinions, then the three authors simultaneously reviewed the full
texts of the articles to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria. Although we did
not include systematic reviews as one of the criteria for this review, we still evaluated the
relevant systematic studies so as not to exclude any relevant studies from this review.

Table 1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Inclusion Criteria

(1) Article published in a journal with peer review;
(2) Publication in English language;
(3) Investigates the use of experimental or quasi-experimental designs in the reporting of the
outcome data for the “EAATs” of “ASD”.

Exclusion Criteria

(1) Publication in languages other than English;
(2) Literature reviews (including systematic reviews), commentaries, etc.;
(3) Animal-assisted or pet-assisted therapies for ASD that used animals other than horses;
(4) No clear outcomes.

In addition, the participants in the eligible studies must have had a diagnosis of ASD
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or have
previously been diagnosed with autism in a qualiﬁed hospital or medical center. If the
study included patients other than those with ASD (such as those with ADHD or ID), then
it met the inclusion criteria; if no autistic patients were included, then the study was not
eligible. Under the same criteria, in the included studies, we allowed trials without control
groups; however, these trials needed to include the participation of live horses and not
virtual or robot horses (simulated horseback riding), which we excluded.

2.1.2. Information Sources

In the research domains, we searched all the articles from ﬁve electronic databases
(PubMed, Scopus, ERIC, ProQuest, MEDLINE) that were related to psychology, health,
education, physical training, clinical therapy, and neuroscience on 10 October 2022. We
obtained the additional detailed supplementary information by utilizing the websites “con-
nected papers” and “Google Scholar”. To ﬁnd more speciﬁc articles, we also looked at the
appropriate reference sections for any other relevant articles. Furthermore, we employed
Review Manager 5 and Endnote X9 to archive and evaluate all the associated articles.

2.1.3. Study Selection

In the database searches that corresponded to the search terms, we identified 365 publications
between 2009 and 2022 (see Figure 1 for details). After we ﬁltered the title and abstract
screenings, 70 articles met the inclusion criteria, and 295 articles did not. In the screening
process, we included 11 additional relevant articles from the references. Then, we selected a
total of 81 articles to meet the inclusion criteria. Of the 81 articles that were initially eligible,
39 were duplicates that we needed to eliminate, while we reviewed the remaining 42 in
their entireties. A total of 17 articles did not meet the criteria, and so we excluded them
from the analysis. We included the other 25 articles. Notably, 6 articles provided sufﬁcient
and reasonable raw data for this meta-analysis, while we used the remaining 19 articles
for the qualitative synthesis, as they did not provide raw data or lacked sufﬁcient data
(Appendix A.2, Table A1).

3. Data Extraction and Evaluation
3.1. Data Items

Two members of the research team used Excel-2212 (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington
State, United States of America) and Review Manager 5.4.1 software (Cochrane, London,
United Kingdom) to collect the following data: article data (ﬁrst author, publication year,
journal name, and country); participant data (sample demographics: age, gender, geograph-
ical information); sample features (diagnosis severity, diagnostic measure, other therapies,
horseback riding experience); interventional and controlled characteristic data (handler ac-
creditation, duration and session of program, terminology, comparison condition); outcome
data (scales and subscales, scale validity, statistics including mean, standard deviation (SD),
p-value, effect size) (see Tables 2 and 3 for details).

3.2. Risk of Bias for Evaluation

We evaluated the internal validity and applicability of the RCTs and controlled clinical
trials (CCTs) for the systematic review using the PEDro scale [51,52], which has 11 items.
As usual, we considered PEDro scores from 6 to 10 to be high quality, scores from 4 to 5 to
be fair quality, and scores of equal to or less than 3 to be low quality (see Table 4 for details).
In addition, we used Sackett’s level of evidence [49], which can be used to sort individual
studies into ﬁve levels of evidence, from Level I to Level V, for more accurate and reliable
evaluations. RCTs are the best kind of evidence (Level 1), indicating clear relationships or
conclusions. The lowest degree of evidence (Level 5) contains some single-case reports,
narrative statements, or studies that do not indicate clear relationships or results (see Table 5
for details). We also looked at the “Risk of Bias Table” from Cochrane to evaluate the bias
risk in these studies by looking up the criteria for each study and giving them a rating of
low, high, or unclear in terms of risk (see Figure 2 for details).

4. Results
4.1. Description of Study

After careful screening and analysis, we gathered 25 eligible articles between 2009
and 2022: 2009 (n = 2); 2021 (n = 1); 2012 (n = 2); 2013 (n = 3); 2014 (n = 2); 2015 (n = 2);
2016 (n = 2); 2017 (n = 1); 2018 (n = 3); 2019 (n = 1); 2020 (n = 3); 2021 (n = 2); 2022 (n = 1).
Researchers have conducted 25 studies in 10 countries, performing most of them in the
United States (n = 14) [28,38,42,43,53,56,57,62–64,66,68–70]. They performed the others in
the following countries: the United Kingdom (n = 2) [59,60]; Italy (n = 2) [25,61]; China
(n = 1) [40]; Iran (n = 1) [65]; Australia (n = 1) [58]; Spain (n = 1) [67]; Hungary (n = 1) [62];
Turkey (n = 1) [54]; Korea (n = 1) [55].

4.2. Sample Characteristics
Individuals with ASD

Of all the included studies, the range of participants with ASD was 3–116, producing
a total ﬁnal sample size of 623, with an average sample size of 25. The largest sample
included 115 participants [30], while the smallest sample included only three people [63,70].
The median sample size was 21, and 12 studies (48%) had sample intervals that focused on
15–29 participants. Meanwhile, the researchers reported the age of the demographic factors
in 25 studies. The age range was 3–16 years old, and in four studies, the authors did not
note the gender factor [25,47,56,60]. In almost all the studies (84%, n = 21), there were more
male participants than female participants, which is consistent with the age and gender
differences in the pathology of autism. In addition, in two trials, the ratios of male-to-female
patients were approximately equal [55,62], and in two studies, the number of females was
higher than the number of males [58,65]. Other than age and gender, researchers reported
the nonverbal intelligence quotient in nine studies [25,27,37,49,52,53,56,60,69]. Additionally,
in eight studies, the authors reported that all patients diagnosed with autism had also been
diagnosed with other disorders or conditions, such as ADHD, ID, hypersensitivity and
sensory integration disorder (HSID), learning disability (LD), seizure disorder (SD), etc.
(see Table 2 for details).

4.3. Intervention Characteristics
4.3.1. Screening Criteria and Instrument

In a total of 19 of 25 articles (76%), the authors reported the participant eligibility
criteria; however, in six articles, they did not specify the criteria in detail for the population
inclusion in the trials. Among the inclusion criteria, in 18 studies (72%), the authors speciﬁ-
cally indicate whether the participants had previously participated in EAAT programs or
had horseback riding experience. Although in no studies do the authors clearly point out
whether the riding experience affected the experimental treatment effect, it is a key factor
that can be explored to determine whether EAATs have lasting therapeutic effects, and we
hope that researchers will test this hypothesis in future trials.

The researchers most frequently used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule
(ADOS) (n = 6), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) (n = 5), Leiter International
Performance Scale (Leiter) (n = 5), and DSM (n = 5) during the participant screening phase.
In the remaining studies, the authors used screening scales such as the Aberrant Behavior
Checklist—Community (ABC-C), Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS), Clinical
Assessment Battery Teacher Rating Form (CAB-T), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale
(VABS), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), and Stone’s Social Skills Scale (SSSS). (See
Table 2 for details).

4.3.2. Intervention Dose

In addition to the abovementioned factors, the trial session, frequency, and total time
were also paramount. Of the twenty-ﬁve included studies, eight studies lacked data on the
total length of the trials, while the authors reported the durations in the remaining 17 (68%)
trials. The total durations of the programs ranged from 240 to 1920 min. The average length

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2630

22 of 47

of the trials was approximately 756 min, with a median time of 600 min, and 11 studies
had trials from 450 to 900 min. Whereas the shortest trial was 4 weeks and the longest was
25 weeks, with a mean of 11 weeks and median of 10 weeks, seven of the twenty-two trials
(32%) in which the authors reported the program weeks had set-up times of 10 weeks (see
Table 3 for details).

4.3.3. Terminology

In these studies, the authors use different intervention terminologies, and the most
used is THR (n = 13, 52%), while the remaining authors use terms such as occupational
therapy in an equine environment (OTEE) (n = 3), EAA (n = 3), HIP (n = 2), EAT (n = 1), EAI
(n = 1), TR (n = 1), and EAAT (n = 1). Although the names of the terminologies are different,
the treatments that they describe primarily include the same training stages: warming up
(health and safety brieﬁngs, stretching exercises, and so on), riding and horsemanship skills
(mounting, halting, steering, running, trotting, brushing, feeding, and putting stickers on
their horses), and cool-down and reward activities (thanking instructors and horses) (see
Table 3 for details).

4.4. Study Methods and Trial Quality

Eight of the included articles were RCTs, and all but one of them (of fair quality)
were of high quality. Notwithstanding, we noticed that in all eight RCTs, the authors did
not report the allocation concealment or participant blinding because it was difﬁcult to
conceal the trial groupings from the participants in such trials. Additionally, the authors
of 10 of the 25 studies that were included in this review randomly allocated the control
groups to the experimental groups, whereas in the remaining nine studies, the authors
did not have control groups and generally used within-group pre and post designs. A
total of ﬁve of these nine trials were designed for individuals as opposed to groups. A
total of 11 studies (44%) scored at Level II or higher when we assessed all 25 studies
using Sackett’s level of evidence, which further indicated the high dependability of the
studies used in this review (see Tables 4 and 5 for details). To thoroughly analyze the
trustworthiness of this systematic review, we also utilized the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool
to evaluate three different types of risk (low risk, unclear risk, and high risk) for the six
subdomains: (1) random sequence generation; (2) allocation concealment; (3) blinding of
participants and personnel; (4) blinding of outcome assessment; (5) incomplete outcome
data; (6) selective reporting. None of the 25 studies were low risk, and performance and
detection biases were the most common (see Figure 2 for details), which is consistent with
the nature of such trials, and which made it challenging to double-blind the participants
and assessors, revealing an improvement direction for future trials, in which researchers
should aim to blind the assessors.

5. Outcome Measures and Effects
5.1. Outcome Measures

In only ﬁve of the twenty-ﬁve research studies do the authors report the intragroup
effects. Authors report both the inter- and intragroup effects in a total of thirteen studies,
and seven studies lack sufﬁcient data to identify the effects. In numerous studies in this
review, the authors evaluated the EAAT impact on multiple ability categories using a
collection of subjective and objective measurements, including standardized tests graded
by experts or parents, qualitative observational measures, physiological indicators, etc.
Speciﬁcally, in 15 of the 25 studies, the authors employed caregiver-rated measures, such as
the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), ABC-C, Sensory Proﬁle (SP), Assessment of Basic
Language and Learning Skills—Revised (ABLLS-R), Pediatric Volitional Questionnaire
(PVQ), Triad Social Skills Assessment (TSSA), VABS, and ABAS. In six studies, the au-
thors utilized standardized tests administered by trained clinicians or experts, such as
the CARS, Sensory Integration and Praxis Test (SIPT), and Bruininks–Oseretsky Test of
Motor Proﬁciency (BOT). In three studies, the authors used semi-structured interviews

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2630

23 of 47

and observational measures to analyze the performance improvements during the training
sessions. In three studies, the authors incorporated physiological parameters, such as
the salivary hormone levels, and in one study, they evaluated the EAAT effects using a
computer-assisted methodology (see Tables 3, 6 and 7 for details).

5.2. Severity of ASD

The key criterion that we utilized to assess the effectiveness of the intervention was
the improvement in the ASD severity. In this comprehensive review, in three studies
that reported the ASD severity effects, the authors used the following four distinctive
standardized measures: (1) the CARS; (2) the autism spectrum quotient (ASQ); (3) the
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); (4) the Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). They
also used an additional qualitative observational scale: interpretive phenomenological
analysis (IPA).

In a 2011 study [68] in which the authors used the CARS, they discovered that the
EAAT program reduced the ASD severity in the participants. The ﬁndings are consis-
tent with those of studies conducted in 2013 and 2017 in which the authors used the
CARS [38,59], as well as with those of studies [54] in which the authors used the CGAS.
Using IPA observed by parents, in a 2018 study, the authors illustrated the EAI impact on
autism from a qualitative perspective, revealing that the EAI improved the broad aspects
of overall psychosocial functioning [58] and for which the psychological and emotional
satisfactions were consistent with those of the previous 2011 and 2014 studies [42,71] but
slightly different from those of another previous study [64]. Overall, there is only limited
evidence that EAAT programs are successful at reducing the autism severity in patients
given the paucity of adequate primary data (see Table 6 for details).

5.3. Social Functioning

The social communication domain was the most crucial aspect of the generally re-
ported autism impairment, with a total of 13 studies (52%) in which the authors describe the
social and communication abilities following EAAT programs, using seven different stan-
dardized measures rated by parents or caregivers. In all the reported testing in the social
domains, in ﬁve studies, the authors found considerable improvements in the overall SRS
scores; however, the ﬁndings differed among the SRS subscales. More speciﬁcally, we ana-
lyzed the effects of EAAT programs on the social communication symptoms connected to
ASD from four studies in which the authors provide exact data using the SRS [27,37,50,53].
According to the meta-analysis results, the EAATs more signiﬁcantly improved the social
functioning of the children with ASD than that of those in the control group (SMD = −0.33,
95% CI [−0.47, −0.19], p < 0.00001) (see Figure 3 for details). Among the ﬁve subdomains,
social cognition (SMD = −0.47, 95% CI [−0.77, −0.18], p = 0.002) and social communication
(SMD = −0.58, 95% CI [−0.91, −0.26], p = 0.0004) had signiﬁcant improvements after the
participants experienced EAAT programs; however, social awareness (SMD = −0.20, 95%
CI [−0.49, 0.09], p = 0.17), social mannerisms (SMD = −0.14, 95% CI [−0.48, 0.21], p = 0.44),
and social motivation (SMD = −0.26, 95% CI [−0.55, 0.03], p = 0.08) had no statistically
signiﬁcant differences. The ﬁndings of the meta-analysis are in line with those of earlier
studies in which the authors found that the parents believed that their children were more
driven to complete daily tasks and got along better with others after participating in the
EAATs [47,63,69]. However, the outcomes of the subdomain improvements reported across
the trials were not totally uniform in all the research. For instance, in a 2018 study with
14 samples [56], the authors found that EAAT substantially enhanced the social aware-
ness domain in autistic children; however, based on the forest plot and according to the
outcomes of the other three trials, it was not effective at enhancing the social awareness
domain. In the studies on subdomains such as social cognition, the authors also report
different results, which constitutes heterogeneity in the subdomains and overall.

The remaining six scales used to assess the social communication domain level include
the SCQ, ABLLS-R, PVQ, CARS, TSSA, and Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS) rating
scales. In a 2020 study [54] in which the authors utilized the SCQ, they demonstrated that
the experimental group exhibited a considerable improvement in the social domain, while
the control group had no substantial changes after 8 weeks of EAA. This was followed by
a study in 2021 [40] in which the authors utilized the ABLLS-R and SSIS. They revealed
substantial improvements in the social communication domain in the experimental group
compared with the conventional group over 16 weeks. These ﬁndings, presented using
multiple scales, were also largely compatible with the results displayed in the forest
plot, which indicates that, in general, EAAT programs improve the social communication
domains of individuals with ASD; however, the aspect and improvement degrees of the
EAAT on the participants differed based on numerous parameters.

5.4. Language Ability

As another area of high impairment for individuals with autism, in four studies, the
authors made use of four different standard assessments and reported improvements in
the language skills of individuals with autism after trials. These four measures included
the following: the Receptive and Expressive Vocabulary Test (REVT) (n = 1) [55]; the
Preschool Receptive–Expressive Language Scale (PRES) (n = 1) [55]; the Systematic Analysis
of Language Transcripts (SALT) (n = 3) [27,53,56]; the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test,
Fourth Edition (PPVT-4) (n = 1) [30].

Following the extraction of the raw data from a meta-analysis of two trials using the
SALT, the experimental group’s language abilities had significantly improved compared with
those of the comparison group following EAAT programs (SMD = 0.52, 95% CI [0.27, 0.77],
p < 0.0001) (see Figure 4 for details). Although the 2018 trial [56] did not reveal signiﬁcant
gains in the two subdomains, the number of different words domain and number of words
domain, according to another follow-up experiment performed in 2018 [57], there were

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2630

35 of 47

substantial improvements in the two subdomains, and the authors also offer some evidence
of the lasting effects of EAAT programs on enhancing the language abilities of people with
autism, as they again measured the results with the SALT six months later and revealed
non-substantial declines in the two subdomains. In another 2019 study in which the
authors employed the REVT [55], they found considerable gains in the receptive linguistic
knowledge. Overall, there is limited evidence to suggest that EAAT programs improve the

5.5. Behavioral Regulation

In a 2014 study, the authors found that self-regulation in children was linked to
improvements in the executive function, sensory processing, and emotion regulation, all of
which led to behavior problems [71]. Therefore, measuring and assessing the self-regulation
and behavior of individuals with autism is one of the universal criteria for measuring ASD
severity. In this review, we used seven different measurement tests to determine the
behavioral regulation scores. The most common measurement standards for measuring
the intervention effects on people with ASD are the ABC-C (n = 9) and VABS (n = 5).
The ﬁve remaining scales and instruments that researchers used to measure behavioral
competence are as follows: the ABAS-3 (n = 1) [28]; the Autism Spectrum Disorder Module
(PEDI-CAT ASD) (n = 1) [43]; the Interaction Emotions and Motor Skills observational
scale (IEMS) (n = 1) [25]; the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) (n = 1) [42]; the Child
Behavior Checklist (CBC) (n = 1) [64]; physiological measures using salivary or hair cortisol
(n = 3) [37,53,58]. These tools have high interverbal consistencies, good reliabilities, and
well-established validities.

Speciﬁcally, ﬁve studies in which the authors used the ABC-C [27,37,53,56,59] pro-
vided us with sufﬁcient and reliable data to conclude that the behavioral competence of
individuals with ASD signiﬁcantly improved after EAAT programs compared with the
control group (SMD = −0.30, 95% CI [−0.42, −0.17], p < 0.00001) (see Figure 5 for details).
Based on the subdomain analyses, the irritability (SMD = −0.44, 95% CI [−0.70, −0.19],
p = 0.0007) and hyperactivity (SMD = −0.43, 95% CI [−0.69, −0.17], p = 0.001) had sta-
tistically signiﬁcant improvements; however, there were no signiﬁcant improvements in
terms of lethargy (SMD = −0.21, 95% CI [−0.53, 0.11], p = 0.19), stereotypy (SMD = −0.04,
95% CI [−0.36, 0.27], p = 0.79), or inappropriate speech (SMD = −0.20, 95% CI [−0.52, 0.12],
p = 0.21).

The remaining four studies [27,49,61,62] in which the authors used the VABS lacked
controlled trials; however, they do report pre- and post-trial data. We also used the ﬁxed-
effects model with 95% conﬁdence intervals that the participants’ behavioral competency
would substantially increase following the EAAT programs (SMD = 0.22, 95% CI [0.09, 0.35],
p = 0.0008) (see Figure 6 for details). Participants also demonstrated appreciable improve-
ments in the socialization subdomain following EAATs (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI [0.03, 0.52],
p = 0.03). However, the data do not indicate any appreciable improvement for the other
three domains: communication (SMD = 0.18, 95% CI [−0.06, 0.43], p = 0.15); daily liv-
ing skills (SMD = 0.20, 95% CI [−0.06, 0.46], p = 0.13); adaptive behavior (SMD = 0.24,
95% CI [−0.06, 0.54], p = 0.11).

The results of the meta-analysis are basically consistent with the conclusions reported
in previous studies. In ﬁve previous studies [25,36,49,52,55], the authors found that EAATs
led to considerable improvements in self-control and decreases in negative behaviors
in the experimental groups. However, in a 2013 [64] study in which the authors used
direct observation to measure the effects, they found that a 9-week THR program did not
substantially improve the mood, behavior, or communication abilities. Overall, there were
enough data to conclude that EAAT programs enhance the behavioral abilities of ASD
populations, despite the varied reports among the subﬁelds.

5.6. Motor and Sensory Functions

In recent evidence-based investigations, the authors reveal that individuals with ASD
exhibit motor and sensory deﬁcits throughout their lifespans [49,72]. In nine studies, the
authors implemented six different standard measures to assess the impacts of the EAAT
programs on the motor and sensory functions of individuals with autism. Of these standard
measures, researchers most frequently use the SP (n = 4) [25,50,51,55], BOT-2 (n = 2) [30,66],
and SIPT (n = 2) [30,66]. The remaining scales include the CGAS (n = 1) [54], Developmental
Coordination Disorder Questionnaire’07 (DCDQ’07) (n = 1) [25], and Sensory Proﬁle School
Companion (SPSC) (n = 1) [38]. In two studies [30,66], the authors employed the SIPT
and BOT-2, which indicated changes in the motor and sensory functioning of children
with ASD following their participation in EAATs; however, there was only one study in
which the authors used a control group [30]. Thus, we compared the pre- and post-changes,
revealing that the patients with autism who participated in EAAT programs appeared to

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2630

39 of 47

have experienced signiﬁcant improvements in their motor (SMD = 0.29, 95% CI [0.01, 0.58],
p = 0.04) (see Figure 7 for details) and sensory (SMD = 0.29, 95% CI [0.10, 0.48], p = 0.003)
abilities (see Figure 8 for details). Nevertheless, among the subcomponents, the verbal
function did not signiﬁcantly improve (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI [−0.07, 0.50], p = 0.14). Only
the postural subdomain improved (SMD = 0.36, 95% CI [0.10, 0.62], p = 0.007). In three
previous investigations [33,62,64], the authors conﬁrmed the ﬁndings of the meta-analysis
and demonstrated that the motor and sensory functioning domains substantially improved
from the pre- to post-test in the experimental groups. However, according to another two
studies [63,69], the EAAT programs had no clinical effects for ASD in this area. Overall, be-
cause only two articles provided enough data for the meta-analysis, there was only limited
evidence that patients with autism who participate in EAAT programs have substantially
improved outcomes in their motor and sensory functioning.

Figure 8. Forest plot of sensory function (pre-post comparison) using SIPT [30,66].

5.7. Cognitive and Executive Functions

Although social cognition and executive functioning are not regularly examined
features of ASD, in two articles in this review, the authors employed three different scales to
evaluate the effects of the EAAT program on individuals with autism in these two domains:
(1) the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children II (K-ABC-II) (n = 1) [55]; (2) the Bayley
Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II) (n = 1) [55]; (3) the Tower of London (TOL)
(n = 1) [61]. In a 2019 study [55], the authors indicated that the cognitive domains of the
THR group substantially improved following an 8-week intervention compared with those
preintervention; however, there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between the
THR group and control group receiving conventional therapy. In a 2016 study [61], the
authors found that the planning time for the problem-solving test decreased following the
intervention, which likely indicated that EAT can improve the executive function in ASD

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2630

40 of 47

patients. However, there was insufﬁcient evidence from the two studies to conclude that
EAAT training can substantially enhance the social cognitive and executive domains.

5.8. Family Functioning

In the previous literature, the authors highlight the importance of parental engagement
and improved caregiver–child connections to enhancing the intervention outcomes [73],
and consequently, family functioning is an essential indicator for assessing ASD [74]. In this
review, in four out of twenty-ﬁve studies, the authors reported the family function outcomes
using two different standardized assessments: (1) the Parenting Stress Index—Short Form
(PSI-SF) (n = 1) [25] and (2) the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD) (n = 1) [54].
In two previous qualitative studies, the authors demonstrated that the EAAT programs
were beneﬁcial to family activities for children with autism, resulting in reduced parental
stress [53,58]. In a 2020 study [54], the authors conﬁrm the prior ﬁnding and offer prelim-
inary evidence that EAAT with children with ASD has considerable beneﬁts for family
functioning; however, in a 2021 study [25], the authors suggest that EAAT did not reduce
the parent distress after the intervention. Reports on the effects of EAAT programs on the
families or parents of people with autism are still rare. While in three articles the authors
preliminarily suggest that parental stress may be reduced by EAAT programs due to their
therapeutic efﬁcacy, in another article, the authors suggest the opposite. As a result, this
evidence was limited, and we hope that researchers will quantitatively examine this crucial
factor in future studies.

5.9. Other Skills

In addition to the above indicators, in eight studies, the authors report other helpful
metrics that were hard to attribute to the above subdomains but nevertheless provided
reliable qualitative or quantitative results. In four studies [37,53,58,59], the authors used
laboratory methods that assessed the participant interaction and physiological state, as
well as saliva or hair collection to measure the amount of cortisol present, with three out of
the four studies providing data from baseline and after the intervention. According to the
analysis, the data from the existing studies support that EAAT programs can signiﬁcantly
reduce the cortisol levels in participants (SMD = 0.53, 95% CI [0.02, 1.05], p = 0.04) (see
Figure 9 for details). However, in a 2017 study [59], the authors report that there was no
evidence to indicate a substantial improvement after the intervention. In conclusion, due to
a lack of additional experimental and compared evidence, the veracity and reliability of the
conclusion that EAAT programs can substantially reduce the cortisol levels in participants
with ASD need to be questioned.

Figure 9. Forest plot of cortisol levels [43,56,67].

The other assessment methods included semi structured interviews, such as the
Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) (n = 1) [28] and Goal Attainment
Scaling (GAS) (n = 1) [43], which revealed that, after receiving EAATs, the participants
were more effective at achieving their stated performance goals. The result was similar
to that of a previous 2015 study [62], in which the authors used the Pedagogical Analysis
and Curriculum (PAC) test. Additionally, the authors used the empathizing–systemizing
quotients (EQ/SQ) (n = 1) [60], Ariel Performance Analysis System (APAS) (n = 1) [62],

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2630

41 of 47

and Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) 4.0 generic score scales (n = 1) [42] to evaluate the
different aspects of the effects after the EAAT programs. In a 2018 study, the authors noted
the advantages of ecopsychology following EAI for both the parents and children [58].

5.10. Persistence of Intervention Effect

Although in many studies, the authors report the considerable intervention effects
of EAAT in many areas for individuals with autism, in only a few trials have the authors
examined whether these effects were sustained. The sustainability of the intervention effects
is a key factor in assessing the overall effectiveness of the intervention. In one study [38],
the authors reveal that EAATs led to short-term improvements; however, the children’s
behavior returned to baseline once the intervention ended. However, in another study [75],
the authors discovered sustained behavioral gains even after the equine intervention was
completed. Overall, the inconsistent information on the long-term beneﬁts of EAATs makes
it difﬁcult to draw solid conclusions about the persistence of the therapeutic effects after
interventions in ASD.

6. Discussion
Summary of Results

The purpose of conducting this review was to use systematic review and meta-analysis
techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of EAAT as a supplementary treatment for individu-
als with ASD. In our review, we combined qualitative and quantitative methodologies to as-
sess two main aspects: (1) the social and communication functioning and (2) self-regulation
functioning, and we objectively assessed the effectiveness of EAAT as an adjunctive therapy
for ASD.

We selected 25 articles from 382, and of the 25 included studies, sixteen trials included
control groups, and nine trials did not. For the study quality, we used the Sackett level of
evidence, PEDro, and Cochrane’s “Risk of Bias Table”. According to the results, 11 of the
25 studies had qualities of I and , only one study had a quality of V, and the remaining
13 studies had qualities of Ш and
. Seven of the eight RCTs included in this study had
scores of 6 or above, and one study had a score of 5. However, of all the included trials,
we only assessed ten studies that were blinded or partially blinded, and in future trials,
researchers should be blinded to ensure the accuracy of the measurements.

For most of the trials in all 25 included articles, the authors report the EAAT effects on
multiple subsystems in ASD. As shown in Table 7, the social and behavioral domains were
the most assessed for ASD, and while it appeared from the review that the EAAT programs
substantially improved the social and behavioral skills of the participants with autism, some
researchers reached the opposite conclusion, especially in terms of the subdomains, such as
social awareness, social mannerisms, and social motivation, for which the meta-analysis
revealed no substantial improvements. Moreover, there were no substantial improvements
in the lethargy and stereotypes subdomains. The possible reasons for this were bias due to
the length of the treatment, differences in the sites, or small samples. Although we did not
have sufﬁcient evidence on the program duration that provides the best treatment outcome
for participants, according to a 2020 study [28], adolescents need weeks or months to learn
new skills and change their behaviors, which suggests that interventions should be longer
than 5 weeks. Similarly, according to the meta-analyses, EAAT programs substantially
improve the skills in individuals with autism; however, in only two studies do the authors
provide enough raw data that researchers should consider the EAAT program effects on
language skills in individuals with autism in subsequent studies whenever possible. In
the remaining four meta-analyses, because the authors did not set up control groups or
obtain data from control groups in the original experiments, although their results indicate
that EAAT programs substantially improve the motor and perceptual function and reduce
the cortisol levels in patients with autism, this conclusion needs to be supported by future
trials in which the researchers include control group data.

Ultrasonic Pulse Evolution over Curing Time The effect of cement content on the frequency distribution of the cemented silica tail-ings backfill sample and the cemented iron tailings backfill sample is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively. As shown in Figure 4, the frequency distribution is similar for different cement contents. It shows that the main frequency domain is first from around 20 Hz to 40 Hz with a brief spike appearing in amplitude, and then, the amplitude reduces to 0, and lastly, the amplitude increases again and the main frequency domain is increased to around 80 Hz. A similar result is observed with the cemented iron tailings backfill in Figure 5. However, the first peak of low frequency is unobservable due to the fine particles in the tailing producing large scattering and energy attenuation to the ultrasonic pulse [27,28]. Combined with the above results, the consolidation process of fresh CTB can be di-vided into three stages according to the propagation characteristics of ultrasonic waves, as shown in Figure 4. In the liquid propagation stage (stage Ⅰ), the amplitude of the ultra-sonic wave rises first and then decreases, as shown in Figure 4a. Within the first 200 min, due to an increasing number of contacts between particles [29] and entrapped air bubbles migrating to the surface of the material [30,31], the amplitude of the ultrasonic wave slightly rises. However, due to the viscous absorption of liquid inside the fresh CTB, high-frequency signals cannot be transmitted through tailings particles, only low-frequency signals, so the main frequency domain is from around 20 Hz to 40 Hz. In the transitional stage (stage Ⅱ), the amount of hydration product is continuously accumulated on the sur-face of tailings particles.

7. Conclusions

In this review, we utilized systematic review and meta-analysis methodologies to
explore the ﬁndings of 25 studies on the impact of EAAT programs on individuals with
ASD. The included studies provided us with sufﬁcient data to draw the conclusion that
EAAT programs substantially improve the social and behavioral functions in people with
ASD, which is broadly in line with other research ﬁndings. The results also indicate
substantial improvements in the language abilities and motor and sensory functioning.
However, in only 11 studies did the authors achieve a quality rating of or higher, while
the qualities of the remaining 14 studies still need to be improved, especially in terms of the
following: the lack of control conditions; small sample sizes; unknown inclusion criteria;
inability to randomly assign experimental and control groups; inability to set up control
groups; dependence on parental assessment, single-assessment methods, etc. In addition,
the effect assessment of the study should be stretched over a longer period, considering
whether various aspects of the participants’ functioning are maintained after a considerable
period. We hope that researchers will provide more evidence in the future.
