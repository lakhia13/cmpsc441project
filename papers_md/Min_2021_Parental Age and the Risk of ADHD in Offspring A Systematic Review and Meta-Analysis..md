Abstract: Evidence has suggested that parental age at birth is a risk factor of offspring attention
deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies
investigating the association between parental age and offspring ADHD. We conducted a systematic
search that followed the recommended guidelines for performing meta-analyses on PUBMED,
EMBASE, and Web of Science up to 8 April 2021. We calculated pooled risk estimates from individual
age with and without adjusting for possible confounding factors. Dose–response analysis for parental
age and ADHD risk was performed. Eleven studies were selected in this meta-analysis, which
included 111,101 cases and 4,417,148 participants. Compared with the reference points, the lowest
parental age category was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring, with adjusted
odds ratios (ORs) of 1.49 (95% conﬁdence intervals (95%CI) 1.19–1.87) and 1.75 (95%CI 1.31–2.36)
for the mother and father, respectively. The highest parental age was statistically insigniﬁcant, with
adjusted ORs of 1.11 (95%CI 0.79–1.55) and 0.93 (95%CI 0.70–1.23) for mother and father separately.
Dose–response analysis indicated a non-linear relationship of parental age with offspring ADHD,
with the lowest ADHD risk at 31–35 years old. The results of this meta-analysis support an association
between young parental age and the risk of ADHD. More high-quality studies are needed to establish
whether the association with parental age is causal.

1. Introduction

Attention deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental
disorder of childhood and adolescence, with a worldwide epidemiological prevalence of
5.3% (5.01–5.56%). The core symptoms of ADHD are inattentiveness, impulsivity, and
motor unrest [1,2]. ADHD symptoms affect social and learning ability and may last to
adulthood [3]. Additionally, ADHD can impose a ﬁnancial burden on society. The analysis
revealed that estimates of ADHD-associated costs ranged from USD 831.38 to 20,538 per
person, and from USD 356 million to 20.27 billion for every high-income country [4].

The etiology of ADHD is poorly understood. ADHD is a multifactorial disease, and
both genetic and environmental risk factors can lead to child ADHD. Twin studies have
revealed heritability estimates of about 70% [5]. However, gene–environment interactions
exaggerated estimates of heritability [6]. In addition to heritability, 10–40% of the associ-
ation with ADHD was accounted for by environmental factors [7]. Some perinatal risk
factors such as maternal substance use and stress, parental age, and low birth weight are
reported to contribute to child ADHD [8]. Recently, parental age at childbirth has been
suggested as a possible risk factor for ADHD.

The fertility trends have changed in some countries. On the one hand, the average
age of parents at childbirth has increased in high–income countries, and the proportion
of women delivering in their thirties and forties has risen correspondingly [9–11]. On the
other hand, adolescent childbearing still is a public health problem, and the rate of ado-
lescent marriage and childbearing in the past decade rebounded [12]. Extensive evidence

suggests that parental age at delivery is associated with outcomes in the offspring [13]. Ad-
vanced parental age may lead to a mental disorder such as autism spectrum disorder and
schizophrenia [14,15]. Similarly, very young parents’ age increases rates of neurobehavioral
outcomes in offspring, including behavioral disorders and intellectual disability [16].

A large number of studies have explored the association between parental age and
ADHD in offspring. However, previous research regarding the association between
parental age at childbirth and the rate of ADHD in offspring is inconsistent [17–27]. Al-
though several studies have reported an insigniﬁcant association between ADHD in chil-
dren and parental age at birth [17,26] most previous studies have reported younger age
at birth as a risk factor of offspring ADHD [20–22,28]. Most studies support that lower
parental age is a risk factor for offspring ADHD [16,18,20,21], but a few studies have found
that advanced parental age increases risk for offspring ADHD [19,23]. It is essential to
verify whether parental age is a risk factor of child ADHD, with the in-creasing trend of
advanced parental age and adolescent childbirth.

Establishing whether parental age at childbirth and ADHD in offspring are associated
could have important public health implications. Although the pathogenesis of ADHD
has not been clearly elucidated, the interaction between genes and environ-mental factors
involves causal pathways [29]. The relationship between parental age and ADHD may
provide clues to the etiologic factors leading to ADHD. Based on previous ﬁndings in
autism and bipolar disorders regarding a dose–response association [30,31], we hypoth-
esized ﬁnding a similar association in this analysis. Few meta-analyses have discussed
the association between parental age and the risk of ADHD. Thus, this study aimed to
systematically explore the association between pa-rental age at delivery and ADHD risk
in offspring, and we also conducted a dose–response meta-analysis to quantitatively eval-
uate the association. The ﬁnding of a signiﬁcant association would provide evidence for
reducing the risk of offspring ADHD by intervening in reproductive age.

2. Methods
2.1. Systematic Literature Search

This study followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) [32]. Two independent reviewers conducted a
systematic literature search on PUBMED, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to 8 April 2021,
for relevant studies which have been published. The search strategy was combined with
the following keywords: (“attention deﬁcit disorder with hyperactivity” OR “ADHD” OR
“attention–deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder”) AND (“maternal age” OR “paternal age” OR “parents
age”). The search was limited to studies published in the English language and conducted
on human beings. Irrelevant studies were excluded by scanning the titles and abstracts.
Additionally, referenced lists of the retrieved studies were checked manually for potentially
relevant reports.

2.2. Study Selection

The meta-analysis included observational studies examining the relationship between
parental age at birth and the risk of ADHD in offspring. Studies were included if they:
(1) measured the outcome in individuals aged 3–17 years; (2) examined maternal or pater-
nal age as the variable; and (3) reported data on rates of ADHD stratiﬁed by at least two
levels of parental age at childbirth or a summary estimate (i.e., relative risk, hazard ratio,
or odds ratio) with its corresponding 95% conﬁdence interval (CI).

Studies were excluded from the ﬁnal analysis if they were: (1) letters, reviews, confer-
ence abstracts, case reports, or protocols; (2) studies containing overlapping participants;
or (3) studies without raw data.

2.3. Data Extraction

Two authors (Min and Li) independently reviewed the literature and extracted the
information and data from the selected studies. To resolve discrepancies in the data

collection process, the third author participated in the discussion. The corresponding
authors were contacted for the full text and raw data that may not have been presented
in the published articles. The following information and data were extracted from each
article: author, year of publication, country, study design, sample size, number with ADHD,
outcome, diagnostic assessment, and adjusted factors. If studies reported the risk estimates
from several adjustment models, the estimates from the maximum adjustment ranges for
potentially confounding variables were extracted.

Besides the number of each age group, the crude and adjusted effect size with cor-
responding 95% CI was extracted. ADHD was a rare outcome; therefore, the differences
between RR, OR, and HR were ignored. OR was reserved to refer to all of them. In most
included studies, the authors used the midpoint parental age category as the reference to
calculate the odds ratio of ADHD based on the lower age categories versus the referenced
group and the higher age categories versus the referenced group. Other studies only
reported the risks of ADHD according to either higher age categories versus the lowest age
category, or lower age categories versus the highest age category.

2.4. Quality Assessment

As the Cochrane Collaboration recommended, the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) [33]
was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. The scale consists of
9 items. Studies scoring 0–3, 4–6, and 7–9 were regarded as low quality, moderate quality,
and high quality, respectively. The two independent reviewers assessed the quality of each
included study.

2.5. Data Synthesis and Statistical Analysis

Four pooled estimates of ADHD risk in children were evaluated from the meta-
analysis: (1) the lower age categories vs. the referenced age categories of maternal age;
(2) the lower age categories vs. the referenced age categories of paternal age; (3) the highest
age categories vs. the referenced age categories of maternal age; and (4) the highest age
categories vs. the referenced age categories of paternal age. Both crude and adjusted
ORs were analyzed separately. The studies included in the analysis were conducted in
different settings; therefore, I2 statistics and Q-statistics were used to explore the extent
of heterogeneity among studies. If statistical heterogeneity was signiﬁcant (I2 > 50% and
p < 0.10), a random-effects model was used to estimate the overall OR and 95% CI. If
considerable heterogeneity existed, subgroup analyses were stratiﬁed by study design,
geographical area, and diagnostic method. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by omitting
one study at a time. Publication bias was not performed because fewer than ten studies
were included in the meta-analysis [34].

A two-stage random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to examine the dose–response
relationship between maternal age and the risk of child ADHD. The lowest category was
set as a reference group. When the average maternal age was not reported in the study, the
midpoint of the upper and lower boundaries of each category was taken. When the lowest
category and highest category were open intervals, the interval width was consistent with
the adjacent one [35]. Generalized least squares (GLS) was used to construct linear and non-
linear dose–response relationship models [36]. Non-linear dose–response meta-analysis of
maternal age and the risk of child ADHD was performed using the restricted cubic splines
with three knots (10%, 50% and 90%) [37]. The coefﬁcient of the second regression spline
was tested by chi-squared to judge whether there was a linear relationship. Regression
parameters were assessed with a test level of α = 0.05. The dose–response relationships
were shown graphically. All analyses were performed with STATA version 14.0 software
(Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA).

3. Result
3.1. Summary of Literature

The initial database search yielded 9078 records, with 7043 remaining after the removal
of duplicates. Overall, 43 studies were retrieved for full-text assessment by screening titles
and abstracts. Furthermore, 32 studies were excluded due to the reasons as follows: reviews
or meta-analysis (n = 5), not related to exposure (n = 8), not associated with outcome (n = 9),
not usable results (n = 10).

Ten studies were removed from the meta-analysis mainly because they lacked data
stratiﬁed by at least two levels of parental age. There were 4953 participants in ten excluded
studies. Five studies were performed in Asia and Oceania [38–42]; three were conducted
in America [43–45]; two were performed in Europe [46,47]. All of them only provided the
average age of parents and calculated the effect size according to the average age. Even though
the studies showed that parental age is associated with offspring ADHD [38,41,42,44–47], they
were not included in this meta–analysis.

Finally, 11 studies, including six case-control studies and ﬁve cohort studies, were se-
lected in this meta-analysis (Figure 1). There were 111,101 cases and 4,417,148 participants
in total. Five studies were performed in Europe; three were conducted in North America;
two were performed in Australia; and one was completed in Korea. According to the diag-
nosis of ADHD, six studies adopted The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition (DSM–IV); meanwhile, four studies used The International Classiﬁcation of
Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD–10). Each study adjusted for possible confounding factors.
Nine studies adjusted for prenatal situation (Apgar score, birth weight, gestational age).
Eight studies were adjusted for gender. Seven studies adjusted for substance exposure.
Five studies adjusted for social–economic status. Only four studies adjusted for psychiatric
history, and four studies adjusted for parental age. Characteristics of these included studies
are summarized in Table 1. The detailed categories of parental age and odds ratios in each
included study are listed in Table S1. According to the NOS, overall, the quality scores of
the included studies were from 6 to 9, with an average score of 7.8 (Tables S2 and S3).

3.2. Risk of Child ADHD According to the Lowest Parental Age Category vs. Reference Points

According to the pooled effect of crude ORs in nine studies, maternal lowest age at
delivery was signiﬁcantly associated with the increased risk of offspring ADHD (OR: 2.04;
95%CI 1.53–2.54). The association became weaker but persisted signiﬁcantly after adjusting
for potential confounding factors (OR: 1.49, 95%CI: 1.19–1.87) (Figure 2). Heterogeneity
was signiﬁcant for the crude estimate (I2 = 98.3%; p < 0.001) and the adjusted estimate
(I2 = 97.1%; p < 0.001).

Six studies provided information about the lowest paternal age at delivery and the
risk of ADHD in offspring. Similar to the results for maternal lowest age, the pooled
estimates comparing lowest paternal age to reference age showed crude ORs of 2.16 (95%CI
1.53–3.04) and adjusted ORs of 1.75 (95%CI 1.31–2.36) (Figure 3), indicating an increased
risk of ADHD in offspring. Statistically signiﬁcant heterogeneity was found both in crude
(I2 = 97.6%; p < 0.001) and adjusted (I2 = 95.1%; p < 0.001) estimate.

The association between young parents and risk of ADHD in offspring remained
signiﬁcant after adjusting for gender, prenatal condition, and substance exposure, with
a 49% and 75% increased risk for offspring of mothers or fathers younger than 20 years,
respectively. To explore heterogeneity, the results varied in some subgroup analyses
stratiﬁed by study design, geographical area, and diagnostic method (Table 2). The results
varied in some subgroup analyses. No statistically signiﬁcant correlation between offspring
ADHD and the lowest maternal age was found among studies conducted in America.
Among case-control studies, studies in America, and studies with the DSM–IV diagnostic
method, the adjusted estimated ORs showed no signiﬁcant correlation between offspring

ADHD and paternal lowest age. In the sensitivity analysis, the summary ORs did not
change substantially by omitting one study in each turn, indicating that the results were
reliable and stable.

3.3. Risk of Child ADHD According to the Highest Parental Age Category vs. Reference Points

The relationship between highest maternal age and ADHD in offspring was revealed
in seven studies with crude ORs and ﬁve studies with adjusted ORs. The association was
statistically non-signiﬁcant either on crude ORs of 1.01(95%CI 0.89–1.16) or adjusted ORs
of 1.11(95%CI 0.79–1.55) (Figure.S1). Heterogeneity was signiﬁcant for the crude estimate
(I2 = 71.3%; p = 0.002) and the adjusted estimate (I2 = 91.7%; p < 0.001).

Pooled effects of crude ORs suggested that no statistically signiﬁcant correlation was
observed between paternal highest age during pregnancy and the risk of offspring in ﬁve
included studies (OR: 1.03, 95%CI: 0.85–1.24). After adjusting for confounding factors,
the association was slightly changed but still non-signiﬁcant (OR: 0.93, 95%CI: 0.70–1.23)
(Figure S2). The heterogeneity was high for the crude (I2 = 91.9%; p < 0.001) and adjusted
estimate (I2 = 94.7%; p < 0.001).

Subgroup analysis was conducted, and the results are presented in Table 2. No
signiﬁcant result was found, and the results were consistent in subgroup analyses. The
results of sensitivity analysis indicated that pooled OR was not signiﬁcantly changed by
removing a single study per iteration.

3.4. Dose–Response Meta-Analysis

Five studies were suitable for dose–response meta-analysis on maternal age and the
risk of offspring ADHD. Due to the results of heterogeneity (I2 = 98%, p = 0.04), a random-
effects model was selected to merge the data. Non-linear relationships were found on
maternal age and offspring ADHD, corresponding to p for nonlinearity (p = 0.032). The
ORs for ADHD risk presented a U-shape. Compared with maternal age younger than 20 at
pregnancy, the risk of offspring ADHD was the lowest when maternal age was 31–35 (OR:
0.48, 95%CI: 0.08–2.79). Children of mothers younger than 20 showed the highest OR for
ADHD. However, a mother older than 40 did not signiﬁcantly increase the risk of ADHD in
her offspring. The dose–response relationship between maternal age and offspring ADHD
is displayed in Figure 4A.

Similarly, the association between paternal age and the risk of offspring ADHD was
non-linear (p = 0.007) in four studies eligible for dose–response meta-analysis. The results
were similar to maternal age and are set out in Figure 4B. The lowest risk was found when
fathers were 31–35 years old. A father who was younger than 20 or older than 45 was likely
to increase the risk of ADHD in offspring in different degrees comparing with fathers at
31–35 years. Children of oldest fathers presented the second-highest rate for ADHD after
children with younger fathers.

4. Discussion

The main results of the current meta-analysis were the following: (1) lower parental
age was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring; (2) there was no
signiﬁcant association between advanced parental age and the increased risk of ADHD
in the offspring; and (3) dose–response analysis revealed that parental age younger than
20 years had the highest risk of having an offspring with ADHD. The risk of ADHD in the
offspring reduced as the parental age increased up to 31–35 years, while the risk of ADHD
increased with the increase in parental age after 31–35 years old.

Meanwhile, there was high heterogeneity in this meta-analysis. Although subgroup
analysis was conducted to detect the heterogeneity of the study, we are unlikely to explain
heterogeneity adequately. Heterogeneity was decreased among the subset of geographic
regions and diagnostic methods in the lowest parental age category. The sources of
heterogeneity included the study design and diagnostic method in the highest maternal age
category. In the paternal highest age category, the heterogeneity was reduced in the subset
of study design. However, moderate heterogeneity still existed in subgroup analysis, and
the heterogeneity of our study could not be totally attributed to study design, geographic
regions, and diagnostic method. Additionally, the high heterogeneity may be related to
the small number of studies included in the analysis. In the previous analysis between
maternal age and offspring autism, the author suggested that the percentage of male
offspring and year of diagnosis could be a source of heterogeneity [48]. We speculated that
the sources of heterogeneity in our analysis may be similar to those in the previous analysis,
because both ADHD and autism are neurodevelopmental disorders. Further studies are
needed to explain the heterogeneity adequately.

When discussing the role of certain environmental factors in the development of
ADHD, we must take into consideration that genetics and other environmental factors
may be confounders. In our study, the adjusted ORs were consistent with the crude
ORs, but both were lower than the crude ORs. The adjustment factors were different in
each study, but most studies adjusted for child gender, prenatal condition, and substance
exposure. This may indicate that these confounders have an impact on the ﬁnal results,
and these factors need to be controlled in future studies. ADHD is highly heritable;
therefore, investigation of the association between parental age at childbirth and ADHD in
offspring should consider parental psychiatric history [49]. In the study including sibling
comparisons, the risk between parental age and offspring ADHD was attenuated but still
existed [22]. Therefore, parental age might be a risk factor for offspring ADHD. In our
study, the lowest risk was found when parents were 31–35 years old. This age is lower than
the current average childbearing age [9]. In most studies included in this meta–analysis,
26–30 was set as a reference group, which may lead to bias in the risk of ADHD according
to the lowest parental age category vs. reference category and highest parental age category
vs. reference category.

In this study, parents younger than 20 years old had the highest risk of having off-
spring with ADHD. There are several plausible mechanisms by which parental age might
affect ADHD in offspring. Some common characteristics of young parents may increase
the risk of ADHD in offspring. Firstly, compared with children of older parents, those
born to young parents are more often exposed to a disadvantageous family environment
and parenting behavior, such as marital conﬂict, family disruption, parental smoking, and
substance abuse [50–53]. Many types of research have shown that exposure to these adver-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4939

11 of 14

sities in early life subsequently leads to a risk of psychiatric disorders later in life [54,55].
Secondly, young mothers are more likely to have inadequate prenatal care and adverse
birth outcomes such as low birth weight and prematurity [56,57]. Adverse birth outcomes
are associated with ADHD in offspring [58,59]. Thirdly, young parents tend to have a
history of hyperactivity problems, and the genetic susceptibility to ADHD in young parents
may be transmitted to their offspring [60,61]. Moreover, the impulsivity associated with
ADHD might lead to an increased rate of unplanned pregnancy, making young people
become parents at an earlier age [62,63]. Thus, the risk of offspring ADHD with young
parental age results from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.

Advanced maternal age was not signiﬁcantly associated with offspring ADHD, but
offspring of fathers older than 45 years had an increased risk of ADHD in the dose–response
analysis. In several previous studies, the results showed that advanced paternal age is a
risk factor of autism, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia [14,64,65], but the association between
advanced parental age and offspring ADHD is inconsistent. The increased occurrence of de
novo mutations and epigenetic alternations with age increase is one possible explanation
for the links between advanced paternal age and autism, BD, and schizophrenia [66–69].
Similar mechanisms may play a role in increasing ADHD risk in the offspring of older
fathers. For older mothers, high reproductive age may lead to obstetric and perinatal
complications, which have been proven to increase the risk of offspring ADHD [70,71].
However, advanced maternal age often means better maternal education and a more
supportive home environment, which may improve children’s health and development [72].
There is no clear mechanism for the association between advanced parental age and ADHD
symptoms in offspring. Further studies should focus on the explicit mechanism of how
parental age at childbirth causes the risk of ADHD in offspring.

To the best our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst meta-analysis providing comprehensive
insights into the effects of parental age on offspring risk of ADHD based on current
observational studies. Additionally, all the ADHD diagnoses were based on the clinical
record in the included studies. However, we should be cautious in explaining the results
with several limitations of this study. Firstly, some important confounders were not
fully adjusted in the included studies, which may affect the accuracy of the conclusions.
Generally, maternal age was related to paternal age, and vice versa. However, some studies
did not take the other parent’s age into account as a confounding factor. It seems necessary
to adjust the effects between the two effects and note the potential collinearity. Secondly,
the small number of studies and sample size in some subgroups reduced the statistical
power and led to inaccuracy in some of the pooled risk estimates. Thirdly, in most of the
included studies, the authors used a midpoint of parental age categories as the reference
group. We could only assess the risk of ADHD based on the lowest or highest parental age
category versus the reference group. According to the current literature, the risk of ADHD
based on the highest vs. lowest parental age was unable to be assessed. It seems desirable
that future studies should proceed to meticulous analyses with appropriate categorical
approaches. Moreover, extreme age subgroups should be considered if possible.

5. Conclusions

This meta-analysis showed the link between parental age and the risk of offspring
ADHD. However, the association should be interpreted with caution because the available
evidence consists of observational studies and it may be confounded by potential factors.
Recognition of this risk is of great importance in both clinical psychiatric practice and as a
public health issue. Parental age is one of the preventable risk factors of adverse outcomes
in the offspring. Future public health policies should pay more attention to the children of
old parents or young parents and provide appropriate parenting guidance. Further studies
are needed to explicitly demonstrate the casual relationship and mechanisms between
parental age and risk of ADHD in the offspring.
