Abstract Dissociation involves disruptions of usually inte-
grated functions of consciousness, perception, memory, iden-
tity, and affect (e.g., depersonalization, derealization, numb-
ing, amnesia, and analgesia). While the precise neurobiologi-
cal underpinnings of dissociation remain elusive, neuroimag-
ing studies in disorders, characterized by high dissociation
(e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder (DDD), disso-
ciative identity disorder (DID), dissociative subtype of post-
traumatic stress disorder (D-PTSD)), have provided valuable
insight into brain alterations possibly underlying dissociation.
Neuroimaging studies in borderline personality disorder
(BPD), investigating links between altered brain function/
structure and dissociation, are still relatively rare. In this arti-
cle, we provide an overview of neurobiological models of
dissociation, primarily based on research in DDD, DID, and
D-PTSD. Based on this background, we review recent neuro-
imaging studies on associations between dissociation and al-
tered brain function and structure in BPD. These studies are

Introduction

Dissociation is a complex heterogeneous phenomenon. It has
been defined as a “disruption of and/or discontinuity in the
normal, subjective integration of one or more aspects of psy-
chological functioning, including – but not limited to – mem-
ory, identity, consciousness, perception, and motor control”
[1, p. 826]. This definition implicates a wide range of psycho-
logical symptoms (e.g., depersonalization, derealization, emo-
tional numbing, and memory fragmentations) and
somatoform symptoms (e.g., analgesia) [2–4]. Aside from
the inability to access normally amenable information and
control motor processes (negative symptoms), dissociation
includes involuntary intrusions of sensory, affective, and cog-
nitive information into conscious awareness or behavior, e.g.,
dissociative flashbacks (positive symptoms) [3]. Dissociation
can be conceptualized both as a general tendency (trait disso-
ciation) and transient state (state dissociation) and can also be
observed in nonclinical populations, albeit at a much lesser
extent than in clinical populations [2, 4].

Pathological dissociation is a trans-diagnostic phenome-
non, highly prevalent in dissociative disorders and in
trauma-related disorders, including depersonalization/
derealization disorder (DDD), dissociative identity disorder
(DID), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and borderline

personality disorder (BPD) [1, 5]. With respect to PTSD, the
most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) includes a dissociative subtype
(dissociative subtype of posttraumatic stress disorder, D-
PTSD), characterized by predominately dissociative re-
sponses to traumatic reminders and other stressors in the form
of depersonalization and/or derealization [5]. In BPD, disso-
ciation is primarily stress-related and appears to have substan-
tial impact on affective–cognitive functioning [6–8].

The precise neural underpinnings of dissociation are still
unclear. Yet, neuroimaging research in clinical samples char-
acterized by high dissociation (e.g., DDD, DID, and D-PTSD)
have already provided valuable insight into structural and
functional networks of brain regions possibly involved in dis-
sociation [9, 10, 11(cid:129)]. Compared to this relatively large body
of literature, neuroimaging studies on dissociation in BPD are
still relatively rare.

The present article gives an overview of recent neuroimag-
ing studies in BPD examining associations between state/trait
dissociation and altered brain structure and function.
Disentangling disorder-specific effects is complicated, as dis-
orders characterized by high dissociation (e.g., BPD, D-
PTSD, and dissociative disorders) are highly comorbid and
may share etiological factors, such as psychological trauma.
Therefore, our present article has two objectives: first, we aim
to provide an overview of etiological and neurobiological
models of dissociation, primarily based on previous findings
in DDD, DID, and D-PTSD. A complete review of this liter-
ature is beyond the scope of this article; therefore, for more
extensive reviews, see, e.g., [1, 9, 10, 11(cid:129)]. Our second aim is
to discuss recent neuroimaging studies (including measures of
state/trait dissociation) in BPD, with respect to key findings
related to dissociation, methodological differences and limita-
tions, and possible implications for future research and the
clinical setting.

Etiological Models: Trauma and Dissociation

Psychological trauma, stress such as severe and chronic
childhood abuse/neglect, has been critically implicated in
the development of dissociation [1, 10, 11(cid:129), 12–17], sug-
gesting a complex interaction of (genetic, neurobiological,
and cognitive) predispositions/vulnerabilities and stressful
life events [18–20].

Dissociation during traumatic events (also referred to as
peritraumatic dissociation [18]) can be considered an adaptive
defense mechanism to cope with overwhelming threat that
cannot be prevented or escaped [3, 11(cid:129)]. States of subjective
detachment (e.g., depersonalization, derealization, and numb-
ing) may help to create an inner distance to the overwhelming
experience by dampening unbearable emotions and reducing
conscious awareness of the event. The traumatic situation may
be perceived as an unreal film-like scene that is not happening

to oneself but observed from a wider distance. Somatoform
symptoms such as analgesia and out of body experiences (e.g.,
the sense of floating above one’s body) may reduce awareness
of physical injury [16].

While direct translations between animal and human stud-
ies are difficult [21], some models have conceptualized
peritraumatic dissociation analogous to the freezing response
observed in animals (see, e.g., [16]). The proximity of threat
may at first elicit an orienting response, preparing the organ-
ism for an active defense mechanism (fight or flight reaction
[22]), associated with increased sympathetic nervous system
activation (e.g., in heart rate, blood pressure, and release of
stress hormones). In situations that cannot be controlled or
escaped, the threatened organism may more likely engage in
a passive defense mode, accompanied by tonic immobility,
increased parasympathic activity, and a “shut-down” of the
arousal system [14, 16, 21, 23]. Passive reactions (i.e, tonic
immobility) in the face of unescapable threat may enhance
survival when the chance of escaping or winning a fight is
low or impossible, e.g., by reducing the risk of being detected
[23, 24]. As pointed out before, however, translations from
animal to human research are complicated by conceptual
and methodological differences (see, e.g., [21]).

There is evidence that peritraumatic dissociation increases
the risk of subsequent PTSD [18, 25–30]. Although the pre-
cise mechanisms remain elusive [18, 28], disturbed informa-
tion processing, most prominently memory alterations, may
play an important role in this relationship [31 –34].
Dissociation is thought to interfere with a coherent encoding
of salient events [35–37], leading to a fragmentation
(compartmentalization) of memory: sensory, affective, and
cognitive aspects of the traumatic event are encoded and
stored as separate elements, which may later reoccur as im-
plicit intrusive flashback memories, accompanied by strong
sensory impressions as if the traumatic event was happening
again in the present [29, 38–42].

Moreover, individuals who are highly vulnerable to ex-
perience peritraumatic dissociation are more likely to re-
spond in a similar way to traumatic reminders later on in
life [43, 44(cid:129), 45]. Dissociation can also develop in the
aftermath of trauma and generalize across situations, i.e.,
individuals who learned to dissociate in response to
traumatic/stressful situations may be more likely to do so
in the presence of even relatively “minor” stressors [10].
Such trauma-related states of consciousness may comprise
distortions in time (e.g., flashback memories), thought
(e.g., voice hearing in second-person perspective), body
(e.g., depersonalization and out of body experiences), and
emotional numbing [43, 44(cid:129)]. Thereby, dissociation can
become maladaptive [10] and possibly interfere with treat-
ment [46–50]. Furthermore, it is assumed that dissociation
has an impact on brain function, as discussed in more detail
below.

Models on Brain Structure and Function Associated With
Dissociation

Up to now, the precise neural/neurobiological underpinnings
of dissociation remain elusive. Yet, a growing number of neu-
roimaging studies in DDD, DID, and D-PTSD have implicat-
ed dissociative symptoms in altered brain structure and
function.

Over the past decades, neuroimaging has become one of
the most important tools in clinical neurobiology. Techniques
such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR spectroscopy
(MRS), positron emission tomography (PET), and diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI) are used to study abnormalities in the
brain. By detecting changes in blood-oxygen-level-dependent
(BOLD) signal (hemodynamic response), functional MRI
(fMRI) provides a measure of brain activity and coactivity
(functional connectivity) during experimental tasks or resting
state, i.e., in the absence of experimental stimulation. PET
(e.g., in combination with pharmacologic challenge) can be
used to detect changes in glucose metabolism and neurotrans-
mitter systems. MRS assesses concentrations of neurochemi-
cal metabolites like glutamate, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), lac-
tate, or choline in the brain. Structural MRI and DTI measure
anatomical abnormalities, e.g., in gray or white matter
volume.

Several neuroimaging studies have related their findings to
higher scores on psychometric scales like the dissociative ex-
periences scale (DES), measuring trait dissociation with the
subscales depersonalization/derealization, amnesia, and ab-
sorption [51], or the dissociation stress scale (DSS), a measure
of state dissociation, including items on psychological and
somatic dissociation and one item on aversive inner tension
[52–54]. As an attempt to mimic dissociative experiences in
everyday-life situations, some studies used script-driven im-
agery to experimentally induce dissociation [55–59, 60(cid:129)]: a
narrative of an autobiographical situation involving dissocia-
tive experiences (“dissociation script,” as compared to an
emotionally neutral script) is created together with each par-
ticipant and presented in an experimental setting (e.g., during
fMRI). Participants are instructed to recall the specific situa-
tion as vividly as possible. Other studies used pharmacologi-
cal challenge (e.g., NMDA antagonists and cannabinoids) to
induce dissociative symptoms (see [61]). In the following sec-
tion, neurobiological models of dissociation, primarily based
on research in DDD, DID, and D-PTSD, are discussed.

Cortico-Limbic Disconnection Model and Neuroimaging
Research in Depersonalization Disorder

Already in 1998, Sierra and Berrios proposed that symptoms
of depersonalization may be associated with a “disconnec-
tion” of a cortico-limbic brain system, involving the amygda-
la, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and prefrontal structures.

In this model, depersonalization is more broadly conceptual-
ized as a state of subjective detachment, involving emotional
numbing, emptiness of thoughts, analgesia, and hypervigi-
lance [62]. It is assumed that these symptoms are associated
with increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and ACC
[63], brain areas implicated in attention, cognitive control,
and arousal modulation. Increased recruitment of the PFC
may (both directly and indirectly via the ACC) lead to damp-
ened activity in the amygdala and a marked attenuation of
automatic responses, comparable to“ shutting down the affec-
tive system” [62, 64–66]. The amygdala is fundamentally in-
volved in salience detection and emotion processing such as
the initiation of stress and fear responses [63, 67–69]. States of
detachment (e.g., numbing) may thus be associated with re-
duced reactivity in this area [70].

Using fMRI, Phillips and colleagues (2001) investigated
brain activity during the presentation of aversive versus neu-
tral images in patients with chronic depersonalization disor-
der, patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and
healthy controls (HC) [69]. In response to aversive images,
depersonalization disorder patients reported less arousal and
showed diminished activity in the occipito-temporal cortex,
ACC, and insula compared to OCD and HCs [69]. The insula
plays an important role in attention modulation, encoding of
negative emotions, interoceptive awareness, and pain percep-
tion [71–75]. Diminished activity in this area may therefore
reflect reduced interoceptive/emotional awareness [69, 76(cid:129)]—
an assumption that is supported by a more recent study in
chronic depersonalization patients [77(cid:129)]. In this study by
Lemche and colleagues, altered anterior insula and dorsal
ACC reactivity to sad emotional expressions was associated
with traits of alexithymia, i.e., difficulties in identifying and
describing feelings. In another study of this group [78(cid:129)], a
stronger coupling of the dorsomedial PFC (Brodmann area
(BA) 9) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; BA31) was
found in depersonalization disorder patients [78(cid:129)]. The PCC
is a critical node of the default mode network (DMN), a brain
network that has been implicated in “inward-directed” (self-
referential) processes, such as episodic memory encoding/re-
trieval, self-monitoring, daydreaming, planning, rumination,
and pain processing [79–81]. Further evidence for altered
self-referential processing in depersonalization disorder pa-
tients stems from an fMRI study in which DDD patients were
exposed to either their own photographs or a stranger’s face
[82(cid:129)]. While viewing their own photographs, patients showed
stronger activity in areas implicated in self-referential process-
ing, e.g., mPFC, which was positively correlated with deper-
sonalization severity [82(cid:129)].

Brain function in depersonalization disorder may also be
altered in the absence of experimental stimulation: in a PET
study by Simeon and colleagues (2000), patients with chronic
depersonalization disorder demonstrated significantly lower

6 Page 4 of 22

metabolic activity in the right middle/superior temporal gyrus
(BA21/22) and higher metabolism in the parietal and occipital
areas (BA7, 39, and 19)—metabolic activity in area 7B was
positively correlated with clinical depersonalization scores
[83]. Altered glucose metabolism in tempo-parietal regions
may play a role in “feeling unreal” [83], e.g., altered con-
sciousness, sensory integration, body schema, and memory,
as suggested by observations in patients with temporal lobe
epilepsy [84] and research on the role of the temporal lobe in
memory processing [32].

In sum, there is evidence for altered activity in brain re-
gions associated with emotional and self-referential process-
ing in patients with chronic depersonalization disorder.

Models on Emotion Modulation and Research
in the Dissociative Subtype of PTSD (D-PTSD)

Based on an earlier research in PTSD, Krystal and colleagues
(1995) proposed that the thalamus plays an important role in
dissociative-like states of altered consciousness. One of the
functions of the thalamus is that of a sensory gate or filter,
receiving direct and indirect input from sub-cortical areas
(e.g., raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus), limbic regions (e.g.,
amygdala), and frontal areas (e.g., ACC and prefrontal corti-
ces) [85]. Within this network, the thalamus may both directly
and indirectly modulate responses to environmental stimuli,
facilitating or impeding the flow of information [34, 61, 85].
Furthermore, the hippocampus and parahippocampal re-
gions may be critical to the understanding of altered memory
processing during dissociative states [31–33, 61].

Based on more recent neuroimaging findings in PTSD
[10], Lanius and colleagues (2010) proposed a neurobiologi-
cal model that distinguishes between two types of responses to
traumatic reminders or other stressors: patients with a disso-
ciative response type (D-PTSD) are thought to “over-modu-
late” their emotions, as opposed to patients who primarily
suffer from re-experiencing symptoms, including (affective)
hyperarousal, intense feelings of shame and guilt, and diffi-
culties in emotion downregulation (re-experiencing response
type). Emotion over-modulation (dissociative response type)
is thought to primarily activate frontal regions implicated in
cognitive control and emotion downregulation (e.g., dorsal/
rostral ACC and mPFC), associated with dampened activity
in amygdala and insula. The reversed pattern—diminished
frontal recruitment (ACC and mPFC) and hyperactivity in
amygdala and insula—is assumed to underlie emotion
under-modulation (re-experience response type) [10].

Central to the development of this model [10] was a script-
driven imagery fMRI study [57], in which PTSD patients were
exposed to autobiographical narratives of traumatic events.
The majority of patients (∼70%) reported marked re-
experiencing symptoms and showed a substantial increase in
heart rate during the script. In a smaller patient group (∼30%),

however, this heart rate increase was not observed—instead,
these patients showed stronger activity in the medial frontal
gyrus, anterior and medial cingulate, middle temporal gyri
(BA38), precuneus, occipital areas, and inferior frontal gyrus
(IFG), compared to a control group of traumatized persons
who had not developed PTSD [57].

In another fMRI study [86], patients with D-PTSD showed
increased activity in the amygdala, insula, and thalamus while
fearful versus neutral facial expressions were presented
nonconsciously. Interestingly, these limbic(-related) areas
were not significantly activated when images were presented
consciously. In the latter case, dissociative patients showed
increased activity in ventral PFC and diminished activity in
the dorsomedial PFC, suggesting a conscious over-
modulation of emotions and suppression of self-referential
processing [86].

For PTSD patients who showed dissociative responses to
autobiographical trauma scripts (compared to patients with a
flashback response and healthy controls), there is also evi-
dence for altered functional connectivity (FC), i.e.,
coactivation in areas implicated in sensory processing, con-
sciousness, memory, and emotion regulation [56]: compared
to controls, dissociative patients showed stronger FC of the
left ventrolateral thalamus (VLT) with right insula, middle
frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, cuneus, and with left
parietal lobe, but reduced VLT-FC with the left superior fron-
tal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, and right superior oc-
cipital gyrus. Compared to patients with a flashback response,
dissociative patients showed increased FC between right cin-
gulate gyrus and left IFG [56].

In the absence of experimental tasks, altered resting-state
functional connectivity (RSFC) in the DMN was found in
patients with D-PTSD [87(cid:129)], including altered synchrony be-
tween the DMN (which is usually activated during rest) and
the “central executive network” (commonly activated during
cognitive tasks, as reflected in strong anticorrelations [75,
88]). Findings of altered intra-network resting-state connectiv-
ity (in DMN) and altered inter-network connectivity were sig-
nificantly associated with depersonalization and derealization
severity [87(cid:129)].

In another RS-fMRI study [89(cid:129)], patients with D-PTSD
(compared to PTSD patients without the dissociative subtype
and HC) demonstrated increased FC of the amygdala with
prefrontal and parietal regions, including dorsal PCC and
precuneus, which may further support the assumption of a
distinct “neurobiological profile” of D-PTSD [89(cid:129)].

Research in Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)

There is some evidence that the aforementioned neurobiolog-
ical alterations may not be specific to a specific disorder but
rather represent a trans-diagnostic phenomenon related to dis-
sociation. Recent findings in DID [90(cid:129), 91(cid:129)] resemble findings

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2017) 19: 6

Page 5 of 22 6

for D-PTSD, albeit intra-individual differences (instead of
inter-individual differences) were observed: neurobiological
responses significantly differed depending on whether DID
patients were in a “hyper-aroused traumatic identity state”
(with voluntary access to traumatic memories) or in their “nor-
mal dissociative identity state” (characterized by dissociative
amnesia) [90(cid:129), 91(cid:129)]. In the two studies by Reinders and col-
leagues (2006, 2014), DID patients showed elevated cardio-
vascular responses (heart rate and blood pressure) and stron-
ger amygdala and insula activity, along with lower activity in
cingulate gyrus, parietal cortex, and parahippocampus when
exposed to a trauma script (versus neutral script) while being
in their “hyper-aroused traumatic identity state” than in their
neutral “hypo-aroused identity state” [90(cid:129), 91(cid:129)]. In another
study, DID patients exhibited increased perfusion in bilateral
thalamus while being in their (apparently) “normal” state of
identity compared to an (apparently) “emotional” identity
state [92(cid:129)]. More research is needed to clarify whether brain
activity patterns may differ dependent on states (in the same
individuals) or represent stable inter-individual differences,
which may allow for a discrimination between diagnostic
subgroups/categories [10].

Research on Structural Alterations

Aside from functional alterations, several studies reported
structural abnormalities in clinical samples with high trait dis-
sociation, although these structural findings are still quite
heterogeneous.

In depersonalization disorder, reduced gray matter volumes
(GMV) in right thalamus, caudate, and cuneus, and increased
GMV in the left dorsomedial PFC and the right somato-sensoric
regions were observed [93(cid:129)]. As abovementioned, these areas
have been implicated in dissociation [10, 61, 62, 85].

In DID, reduced volumes in the amygdala and hippocam-
pus [94, 95] and parahippocampus [95] were found, although
discrepant findings of normal amygdala and hippocampal vol-
umes compared to healthy controls were also reported [96].
Smaller hippocampal volumes may be related to early life
trauma: the hippocampus has a high density of glucocorticoid
receptors and is highly sensitive to a heightened release of the
stress hormone cortisol—therefore, chronic traumatic stress
may lead to cell damage in this area [31–34]. Smaller hippo-
campal volumes were also found in healthy individuals with
childhood trauma, who did not develop a disorder [97].
Reduced hippocampal volumes in PTSD [98(cid:129), 99] may there-
fore stem from a history of trauma rather than specific to the
diagnosis [100]. In a recent study [98(cid:129)], comparing PTSD
patients with versus without dissociative subtype, no signifi-
cant group differences in amygdala, hippocampus, and
parahippocampus volumes were observed. Yet, patients with
D-PTSD showed increased GMV in right precentral and fusi-
form gyri and reduced GMV in right inferior temporal gyrus.

Severity of depersonalization and derealization was positively
correlated with GMV in the right middle frontal gyrus [98(cid:129)].
Another study in PTSD [101(cid:129)] found positive associations
between trait dissociation and GMVs in medial/lateral PFC,
orbitofrontal, temporal polar, parahippocampal, and inferior
parietal cortices—brain regions associated with emotion
regulation.

Extending findings on GMV alterations, a recent study in
dissociative disorders [102(cid:129)] found significantly lower frac-
tional anisotropy in white matter of the right anterior corona
radiate (which receives projections from the basal ganglia)
compared to healthy controls. More research is needed to un-
derstand how these alterations may be related to specific clin-
ical symptoms of dissociation.

As already pointed out in the context of functional neuro-
imaging studies, interpretation of structural studies may be
complicated by the presence of comorbidities. Patients with
comorbid PTSD+DID showed significantly larger volumes of
the putamen and pallidum than PTSD patients without DID
[103]. Volumes of these regions (implicated in motor control
[103–105]) were negatively correlated with severity of
derealization/depersonalization [103]. Patients with PTSD+
DID (but not PTSD patients without DID) further showed
smaller hippocampal volumes than healthy controls [103].

Further studies with clinical control groups are needed to
gain more insight into this relationship. Of note, structural
alterations do not necessarily reflect functional alterations,
i.e., more frequent engagement of specific brain areas does
not have to be reflected in larger volume of this region and
vice versa. Studies including both functional and structural
measures may give additional insight into this relationship
[106].

Interim Summary

In sum, theoretical assumptions and research in depersonali-
zation/DDD, DID, and D-PTSD suggest a link between dis-
sociative symptoms and alterations in brain regions associated
with emotion processing and memory (amygdala, hippocam-
pus, parahippocampal gyrus, and middle/superior temporal
gyrus), attention and interoceptive awareness (insula), filter-
ing of sensory input (thalamus), self-referential processes
(PCC, precuneus, and mPFC), cognitive control, and arousal
modulation (IFG, ACC, and lateral prefrontal cortices). As
many studies did not include clinical control groups or groups
of traumatized individuals who did not develop a disorder, it
remains unclear whether the aforementioned results are relat-
ed to a specific disorder or a trans-diagnostic feature, possibly
associated with high dissociation. Findings that are based on
correlations (e.g., between brain structure/function and psy-
chometric scores) do not allow causal conclusions, i.e., wheth-
er they represent a predisposition for or a result of frequent
dissociative experiences (see below).

The second aim of our article is to review neuroimaging
studies in BPD that investigated links to dissociative symp-
toms. We searched databases (PubMed, PsychInfo, Web of
Science, and Science Direct) for different combinations of
“Borderline Personality Disorder,” “Dissociation,” and the
following keywords: brain, brain alterations, functional mag-
netic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, neuro-
biological, neuroimaging, neurophysiological, positron emis-
sion tomography, and structural magnetic resonance imaging.
In the next section, we first describe clinical expressions of
dissociation in BPD, providing a background for the subse-
quent discussion of neuroimaging research.

Dissociation in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)

Transient stress-related dissociation is a hallmark of BPD [6,
11(cid:129), 107]. It has been defined as one of the nine diagnostic
criteria for the disorder in DSM-IV [108]. In DSM-V [5],
“dissociative states under stress” are still listed among other
BPD key features such as emotion dysregulation, instable
cognition, impulsivity, and interpersonal disturbances.

Emotion dysregulation in BPD (i.e., heightened sensitivity
to emotional stimuli, intense emotions, rapid mood swings, and
lack of functional emotion regulation strategies) can have det-
rimental effects on goal-directed behaviors in every-day life [6,
11(cid:129), 13, 109(cid:129)]. Numerous studies suggest that a dysfunctional
network of fronto-limbic brain regions, including a hyperreac-
tivity of the amygdala and insula, and diminished recruitment
of frontal regions (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), mPFC, and
dlPFC) during emotional challenge may underlie emotion dys-
regulation in BPD (e.g., see [110(cid:129), 111(cid:129), 112(cid:129)]).

Stress-related dissociation occurs in about 75–80% of BPD
patients [6, 113–118], typically lasting between minutes and
hours, or days [119, 120]. The strength, frequency, and inten-
sity of dissociative experiences are positively correlated to
self-reported arousal/stress levels [6].

Research in BPD has found reasonably strong relationships
between dissociation and childhood trauma, especially sexual
abuse [118, 121–124], physical abuse, attachment difficulties,
and parental neglect [118, 125, 126] (for an overview, see
[11(cid:129)]).

It has been proposed that stress-related dissociation in BPD
may be a form of emotion modulation (e.g., increased at-
tempts to inhibit emotions), comparable to observations in
D-PTSD, especially in patients with severe childhood trauma
[11(cid:129), 127]. By interfering with mental resources that are cru-
cial to cognitive functioning [55, 60(cid:129)], stress-related dissocia-
tion may hinder recovery [128]. BPD patients with high trait
dissociation showed significant impairments across multiple
neuropsychological domains (including memory, attention,
and interference inhibition) [8] [129(cid:129)]. Recent neuroimaging
studies further suggest a substantial impact of experimentally

induced dissociation on affective–cognitive functioning in
BPD [55, 60(cid:129)], as discussed in more detail below.

Neuroimaging Research on Dissociation in BPD

To our knowledge, so far, only relatively few neuroimaging
studies in BPD examined links between trait/state dissociation
and brain function during resting state (RS) [130(cid:129), 131–134]
or experimental tasks [135–140, 141(cid:129)], and even fewer studies
have directly investigated the impact of experimentally in-
duced dissociation on neural processing [55, 59, 60(cid:129)]. In the
following section, we provide an overview of neuroimaging
studies, revealed by our literature search, and recent unpub-
lished research from our group. Table 1 gives an overview of
these studies (n = 20), summarizing key results related to dis-
sociation and methodological characteristics (sample charac-
teristics, medication status, trauma history, comorbidity, and
measures). In all studies, BPD was assessed according to
DSM-IV [108].

Brain Function During Rest: PET, SPECT, and RS-fMRI
Studies

Lange and colleagues used 18fluoro-2-deoxyglucose
(FDG-)PET to investigate glucose metabolism in 17 BPD
patients (with a history of childhood sexual/physical abuse,
mixed gender, partly medicated; see Table 1) and 9 healthy
controls (HCs) [131]. BPD patients displayed reduced FDG
uptake in the right temporal pole, anterior fusiform gyrus, and
left precuneus and PCC. Impaired memory performance
among patients was correlated with metabolic activity in ven-
tromedial and lateral temporal cortices (implicated in episodic
memory consolidation and retrieval), while no correlations
with trait dissociation (DES) were reported. The finding of
decreased temporo-parietal metabolism was discussed as pos-
sible neural underpinning of altered memory processes that
may also play a role in the context of dissociation [131].
However, sample sizes were relatively small, and findings
may not be specific to BPD due to comorbidities (deperson-
alization disorder, DID, and PTSD).

Sar et al. [132] used single-photon emission computed to-
mography (SPECT) with Tc99m-hexamethylpropylenamine
(HMPAO) as a tracer to investigate regional cerebral blood
flow (rCBF) in an unmedicated sample of DID patients
(n = 21), 15 of whom met criteria for comorbid BPD, and 9
HCs. Compared to HCs, patients showed decreased rCBF
ratio in bilateral medial OFC and increased rCBF in medial/
superior frontal regions and occipital regions bilaterally [63].
No significant correlation with dissociation was reported.

Wolf and colleagues (2012) used continuous arterial spin
labeling MRI to measure alterations in blood flow in 16 fe-
male BPD patients without comorbid PTSD (partly medicated
but on a stable medication) and 16 HCs [133]. Compared to

HCs, patients exhibited decreased blow flow in the medial
OFC, while increased blood flow was found in the lateral
OFC bilaterally. Like in the study by Sar and colleagues
[132], no significant correlation with self-reported dissocia-
tion (DSS) was observed. Instead, medial and lateral OFC
blood flow was positively correlated with impulsivity, as mea-
sured with the Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS; [142])—sug-
gesting an association with impulsivity rather than with
dissociation.

In 17 female BPD patients without PTSD and 17 HCs
(same sample as in [133]), Wolf and colleagues (2011) inves-
tigated changes in RSFC using RS-fMRI [134]. Within the
DMN, patients showed increased RSFC in the left frontopolar
cortex and insula, while showing decreased RSFC in the left
cuneus. Within a fronto-parietal network, patients exhibited
decreased RSFC in the left inferior parietal lobule and the right
middle temporal cortex compared to HCs. No significant
group differences were observed in two other networks com-
prising lateral prefrontal and cingulate regions. In the BPD
group, state dissociation (DSS) positively predicted RSFC in
the insula and precuneus [134]—as previously mentioned,
these regions play a role in interoceptive awareness and self-
referential processes [74].

In another RS-fMRI study, Krause-Utz et al. (2014) inves-
tigated the changes in RSFC of the three fronto-limbic core
regions that are of specific relevance to BPD: bilateral amyg-
dala (medial temporal lobe network), bilateral dorsal ACC
(salience network), and bilateral ventral ACC (default mode
network) [130(cid:129)]. The DES was used to predict RSFC with
these seed regions. The sample comprised 20 unmedicated
female BPD patients (all with a history of interpersonal trau-
ma) and 17 HCs. There was a trend for increased amygdala
RSFC with right dorsal insula, lateral OFC, and putamen in
patients compared to HCs. BPD patients further exhibited
diminished negative RSFC between the dorsal ACC and the
left PCC and increased negative RSFC of the left ventral ACC
with occipital cortex, lingual gyrus, and cuneus. In the patient
group, DES scores positively predicted amygdala RSFC with
the right dlPFC. Furthermore, patients, who reported higher
trait dissociation showed a reduced coupling of the amygdala
with right fusiform gyrus. A subgroup comparison of BPD
patients with (n = 9) versus without comorbid PTSD (n = 11)
yielded similar findings.

The two RS-fMRI studies described above [130(cid:129), 134]
provide primary evidence for a possible role of dissociation
in altered RSFC in BPD. As pointed out before, no causal
conclusions can be drawn from correlational findings. In order
to gain more insight into the impact of dissociation on RSFC
of large-scale brain networks in BPD, future studies may ac-
quire resting-state scans before and after experimentally in-
ducing dissociation (e.g., via script-driven imagery) and be-
fore and after therapeutic interventions aimed at a reduction of
dissociative symptoms.

Again, interpretation of findings, summarized so far, is
complicated by methodical differences (e.g., comorbidities
with depersonalization disorder [131], DID [131, 132], and
PTSD [130(cid:129)]), trauma history [130(cid:129), 131], psychotropic med-
ication [131, 133, 134], and relatively small sample sizes.

Neurochemical Alterations: MRS Studies

To our knowledge, one MRS study in BPD investigated links
between trait dissociation (DES) and glutamate levels in the
ACC within a sample of unmedicated female BPD patients
(n = 30) and HCs (n = 3 0) [143]. Significantly higher levels of
glutamate in the ACC were found in BPD as compared with
HCs. In BPD, glutamate concentrations in the ACC were pos-
itively correlated not only to DES scores, but also to BIS
scores. Associations between ACC glutamate levels and im-
pulsivity (BIS scores) could be replicated in a more recent
study [144], suggesting a link with impulsivity rather than
with dissociation.

Task-Related fMRI Studies

A couple of fMRI studies in BPD examined links between
changes in BOLD response during experimental tasks (e.g.,
viewing aversive images, pain stimulation, and cognitive
tasks) and self-reported dissociation (e.g., DSS and DES).

Kraus and colleagues (2009) investigated amygdala activ-
ity in relation to pain processing (heat stimulation) and state
dissociation (DSS) in an unmedicated sample of female BPD
patients with (n = 12) and without comorbid PTSD (n = 17)
[137]. No significant group differences in pain sensitivity
were observed. A deactivation of the amygdala during pain
processing was found to be more pronounced in BPD patients
with comorbid PTSD than in those without PTSD, while this
was not significantly correlated with DSS scores.

In a more recent study, pain processing and dissociation
(DES and DSS before/after scanning) were investigated in
relation to FC changes in an unmedicated female sample of
BPD patients (n = 25, all with a history of self-harm) and 23
HCs [136]. Kluetsch and colleagues [136] used psychophys-
iological interaction (PPI) analysis [136] and independent
component analysis to analyze changes in FC. Compared to
controls, patients showed a reduced integration of the left
retrosplenial cortex and left superior frontal gyrus into the
DMN. During pain versus neutral temperature stimulation,
patients further exhibited less FC between the PCC (seed re-
gion) and left dlPFC. Higher trait dissociation (DES) was
associated with an attenuated signal decrease of the DMN in
response to painful stimulation. Since only patients with a
history of self-harm and no clinical control group were includ-
ed, future studies should clarify whether these findings can be
replicated in BPD patients without self-injurious behavior and

6 Page 14 of 22

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2017) 19: 6

whether they may underlie altered pain processing (e.g., anal-
gesia) during dissociation.

Wingenfeld and colleagues (2009) applied an individual-
ized emotional stroop task (EST, with neutral, general nega-
tive, and individual negative words) to investigate changes in
BOLD signal during emotional interference in 20 BPD pa-
tients (partly medicated, mixed gender; see Table 1) and 20
HCs [140]. State dissociation (DSS) was assessed before and
after scanning. Patients displayed overall slower reaction
times than HCs, while no increase of reaction times after emo-
tional interference was observed. Controls, but not BPD pa-
tients, showed a significant recruitment of the ACC and fron-
tal areas for generally negative versus neutral and for individ-
ual negative versus neutral words, respectively. No significant
correlations between DSS and behavioral measures or neural
activity were reported.

Hazlett and colleagues (2012) investigated potentiated
amygdala responses to repeatedly presented emotional pic-
tures in an unmedicated sample of BPD patients (n = 33),
schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) patients (n = 28), and
32 HCs (mixed gender; see Table 1) [135]. Participants
underwent event-related fMRI scanning while viewing repeat-
ed (versus novel) neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant pictures.
BPD patients demonstrated increased amygdala reactivity to
repeated emotional, but not neutral pictures, and a prolonged
return to baseline of amygdala activity across all conditions.
Despite amygdala overactivation, BPD patients showed
blunted arousal ratings of emotional, but not neutral pictures.
A significant negative correlation between self-reported dis-
sociation and amygdala activity was found in BPD and also in
the SPD group: higher self-reported dissociation (DES) was
associated with lower emotion-challenged amygdala reactivi-
ty. This latter finding is in line with the assumption that dis-
sociation may serve as a defensive mechanism for unpleasant
stimuli (see above).

The influence of dissociation on brain activity and FC dur-
ing emotional distraction in the context of a working memory
task was investigated in two fMRI studies by Krause-Utz and
colleagues [139, 145(cid:129)]. Twenty-two unmedicated female BPD
patients (all with a history of interpersonal trauma) and 22
HCs performed a modified Sternberg item-recognition task
(emotional working memory task, EWMT, with neutral versus
negative interpersonal pictures versus no distractors presented
during the delay interval between encoding and retrieval).
Immediately before and after the EWMT, state dissociation
(DSS) was measured. Patients showed significantly increased
amygdala activation and impaired task performance during
distraction by negative and neutral interpersonal pictures but
not in the control condition without distractors, suggesting
increased susceptibility to social cues in BPD [139]. Patients
who reported a stronger increase of state dissociation (DSS)
showed significantly lower amygdala reactivity to negative
distractors [139], in line with aforementioned findings by

Hazlett and colleagues [135] and theoretical models [10]. No
significant differences were observed between BPD patients
with (n = 9) versus without comorbid PTSD.

In a reanalysis of this data set, Krause-Utz, Elzinga, and
colleagues (2014) further examined how activity in the bilat-
eral amygdala (seed region) was correlated to activity in other
regions across the brain [145(cid:129)] using PPI [146]. In the BPD
group, a stronger coupling of the amygdala with hippocampus
and dorsomedial PFC was observed for negative versus no
distractors, suggesting an increased coactivation (information
exchange) of regions involved in emotional and self-
referential processing, e.g., retrieval of autobiographical mem-
ories [145(cid:129)]. During negative distractors, patients with higher
state dissociation (DSS4) showed stronger bilateral amygdala
FC with right thalamus, right ACC, left insula, and left
precentral gyrus—regions implicated in arousal modulation,
body movements, attention, and filtering of sensory informa-
tion [145(cid:129)].

In another fMRI study, Krause-Utz, Mauchnik, and col-
leagues [138] investigated the neural correlates of classical
fear conditioning (using a differential delay aversive condi-
tioning paradigm with an electric shock as unconditioned
stimulus and two neutral pictures as CS− and CS+) in 27
unmedicated female BPD patients and 26 HCs. Controls but
not BPD patients showed amygdala habituation during acqui-
sition of CS+paired (CS+ in temporal contingency with the
aversive event). No significant effect of trait or state dissocia-
tion (DSS) was observed, neither on skin conductance re-
sponse (SCR) nor on brain activity. In contrast to this, an
earlier study by Ebner-Priemer and colleagues (2009) found
diminished fear conditioning in terms of SCR and subjective
ratings in BPD patients with high (compared to those with
low) pre-experimental dissociation [7]. These discrepancies
may be related to methodological differences (e.g., assessment
of skin conductance during fMRI versus in the laboratory and
different sample characteristics: patients in the study by
Krause-Utz et al. [106] reported relatively low naturally oc-
curring state dissociation).

Script-Driven Imagery Studies

To our knowledge, three fMRI studies in BPD so far have
used script-driven imagery to experimentally induce dissocia-
tive states [55, 59, 60(cid:129)].

In a pilot fMRI study, Ludascher and colleagues [120] in-
vestigated dissociation and pain sensitivity in unmedicated fe-
male BPD patients with (n = 10) and without comorbid PTSD
(n = 5) [59]. During fMRI, patients were exposed to an
autographical dissociation script versus a neutral script. After
the dissociation script, DSS scores were significantly increased,
indicating a successful experimental manipulation, and pain
sensitivity was lower than after the neutral script. During the
dissociation script, patients further showed increased activation

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2017) 19: 6

Page 15 of 22 6

in the left IFG (BA9). Scores on the DSS positively predicted
activation in the left superior frontal gyrus (BA6) and negative-
ly predicted activation in the right middle temporal gyrus
(BA21) and inferior temporal gyrus (BA20). In the subgroup
of patients with BPD+PTSD (n = 10), increased activity in the
left cingulate gyrus (BA32) was observed during the dissocia-
tion script. Further, DSS scores were positively correlated to the
bilateral insula activity (BA13) and negatively correlated with
the right parahippocampal gyrus (BA35) activity. However, the
sample size was relatively small and no control group was
included.

In a subsequent study, Winter and colleagues (2015) inves-
tigated the impact of dissociation on cognitive control of emo-
tional material, by combining script-driven imagery with an
EST (with negative, neutral, and positive words), a free word
recall task, and a recognition task for EST words [60(cid:129)].
Dissociation was induced in 19 unmediated female BPD pa-
tients (BPDd), while 18 BPD patients (BPDn) and 19 HCs
were exposed to a neutral script. Script-driven imagery again
successfully increased dissociation (DSS) in the BPDd group.
During the EST, BPDd patients showed overall cognitive im-
pairments (more errors and slower reaction times) and
prolonged reaction times in response to negative versus neu-
tral words compared with the other groups. In the subsequent
memory task, the BPDd group recalled fewer EST words and
needed more time to recognize words than BPDn. Further,
BPDd demonstrated increased activity in left IFG and dlPFC
during negative versus neutral words, possibly reflecting in-
creased attempts to inhibit (emotional) material during
dissociation.

Recently, Krause-Utz and colleagues (submitted) com-
bined script-driven imagery with the EWMT to study the ef-
fect of dissociation on amygdala activity and FC during emo-
tional distraction [55]. Within an unmedicated female sample
of 29 BPD patients, dissociation was induced in 17 patients
(BPDd), while 12 patients (BPDn) and 18 HC were exposed
to a neutral script. Script-driven imagery again successfully
increased dissociation (DSS) and aversive pictures within the
EWMT evoked significant changes in amygdala activity.
Overall, the BPDd patients showed significantly more work-
ing memory impairments (incorrect responses and misses,
suggesting disturbed memory encoding/retrieval), and re-
duced activity in bilateral amygdala. Amygdala hyperactivity
to emotional pictures (relative to HCs) could only be observed
in BPDn. During negative distractors (versus no distractors),
BPDd patients further showed lower activity in left cuneus,
lingual gyrus, and PCC than BPDn and increased left IFG
activity than HC. Increased left IFG activity in BPDd resem-
bles findings of previous studies [59, 60(cid:129)], albeit it was also
found in the BPDn group [55]. The PPI revealed a significant-
ly stronger coupling of amygdala with the left inferior parietal
lobule, right superior/middle temporal gyrus, right middle oc-
cipital gyrus, and left claustrum during negative distractors in

the BPDd group compared to the other groups [55]. More
studies, including clinical control groups and larger samples,
are needed to gain a deeper insight into the impact of dissoci-
ation on neural processes during affective–cognitive
processing.

Possible Effects of fMRI Neurofeedback

Paret and colleagues [141(cid:129)] used real-time fMRI to investigate
the effects of a neurofeedback training task on amygdala ac-
tivity and amygdala-PFC FC. In four training sessions, female
BPD patients (n = 8) were instructed to downregulate emo-
tional responses to aversive images based on feedback from
a thermometer display, showing amygdala BOLD signals
[141(cid:129)]. The DSS was applied at the end of each training run.
Amygdala-PFC FC was altered across the four sessions, with
increased amygdala-vlPFC FC for regulating versus passively
viewing aversive pictures. Interestingly, self-reported “lack of
emotional awareness” (difficulties in emotion regulation
scale [147]) and also state dissociation (DSS) decreased
with training [148].

Structural Neuroimaging Studies in BPD

A large number of neuroimaging studies in BPD used tech-
niques like structural MRI or DTI to investigate volumetric
alterations in comparison to HCs (e.g., see [110(cid:129), 112(cid:129)]). Some
of these studies included psychometric scales like the DES or
DSS to link their findings to dissociation [149, 150(cid:129), 151].

Irle et al. [149] used structural MRI to investigate volumes
of the superior (precuneus and postcentral gyrus) and inferior
parietal cortices in 30 female BPD patients (all with a history
of severe sexual and physical abuse, partly medicated; see
Table 1), and 25 HCs. Comorbid dissociative disorders were
determined using the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV
dissociative disorders (SCID-D) [152]. BPD patients with co-
morbid dissociative amnesia (DA) or DID had significantly
increased left postcentral gyrus volumes compared to HCs
(+13%) and BPD patients without these disorders (+11%).
In the entire BPD sample, smaller right-sided precuneus vol-
umes (−9%) were observed (compared to HCs) and stronger
depersonalization was related to larger right precuneus size,
suggesting a possible relationship between dissociative symp-
toms and volumetric alterations in this region.

Niedtfeld and colleagues (2013) used voxel-based mor-
phometry to investigate structural alterations across the entire
brain in a female sample of 60 unmedicated BPD patients with
(n = 21) and without comorbid PTSD (n = 31; mainly follow-
ing severe childhood trauma such as physical/sexual abuse),
and HCs (n = 60) [150(cid:129)]. In BPD, smaller GMVof right amyg-
dala, hippocampus, ACC, fusiform, and inferior temporal gy-
rus were found. In patients with comorbid BPD+PTSD, in-
creased GMV in the dlPFC and superior temporal gyrus were

6 Page 16 of 22

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2017) 19: 6

observed. For a smaller subsample of 42 BPD patients, scores
on the DES could be included, which predicted larger GMV in
the middle temporal gyrus [150(cid:129)]—a region previously impli-
cated in dissociation [83, 84].

Extending the abovementioned findings on GMV alter-
ations, Rusch and colleagues (2007) used DTI to study white
matter alterations in 20 female unmedicated BPD patients and
20 HCs [151]. Mean diffusivity in inferior frontal white matter
was associated with higher trait dissociation (DES), but also
with measures of general psychopathology. As all BPD pa-
tients had comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), it also remains unclear whether these alterations
are specific for BPD.

Interim Summary

To sum up at this point, structural studies on dissociation in
BPD are still relatively rare and heterogeneous. Task-related
fMRI studies suggest a role of dissociation in brain regions
that play an important role in emotion processing/regulation,
pain processing, and impulse control, including the amygdala,
medial temporal lobe, insula, fusiform gyrus, precuneus, IFG,
ACC, and cortical structures (e,g., dlPFC) [110(cid:129), 111(cid:129), 112(cid:129)].
These brain regions and (part of) their functions are summa-
rized in Fig. 1.

As previously mentioned, the amygdala is fundamentally
involved in emotion processing and the initiation of stress and
fear responses [63, 67–69] and activity in this area might be
dampened during dissociation [10, 62]. Three studies in BPD
[55, 135, 139] found lower activity in this region in patients
reporting higher dissociation, while other studies did not [60(cid:129),
137, 138]. These discrepancies may partly be related to differ-
ences in study design: studies observing negative correlations
studied amygdala reactivity to highly aversive (trauma-
related) pictures [55, 135, 139], while Kraus and colleagues
[137] studied amygdala activation during pain stimulation and
Winter et al. [60(cid:129)] used emotional words, which might have
been less distressing than aversive pictures (not evoking sig-
nificant changes in amygdala activity). Naturally occurring
dissociative states (DSS4 ratings: mean ± standard deviation
(M ± SD)) were relatively low ([137]: BPD 1.16 ± 0.28;
[138] 2.14 ± 1.67) as compared to script-driven imagery stud-
ies inducing dissociation (e.g., [55]: BPDd 6.85 ± 2.03; 9-
point Likert scale, 9 indicating extreme symptoms). More re-
search is needed to examine whether effects of dissociation on
“affective brain regions” (e.g., amygdala) may become partic-
ularly evident in highly stressful situations and during high
state dissociation in BPD. This may have implications for
neurobiological conceptualizations of the disorder, as amyg-
dala hyperreactivity to emotional stimuli is assumed to be a
key feature of BPD [110(cid:129), 111(cid:129)]. Assuming that dissociation
dampens amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli, the pres-
ence of dissociative symptoms may partly (aside from other

factors such as medication status [111(cid:129)]) explain why some
previous studies did not replicate amygdala hyperreactivity in
BPD [110(cid:129)].

Apart from the amygdala, the left IFG, which has been
implicated in interference inhibition and suppression of im-
pulses [104], may be implicated in dissociative states in BPD.
Three script-driven imagery studies consistently found in-
creased activity in this area in patients listening to a dissocia-
tion script [59] and performing affective–cognitive tasks after
dissociation induction [55, 60(cid:129)]. As no clinical control groups
were included in these studies and a high percentage of pa-
tients [59, 60(cid:129)] or all patients [55] respectively reported a
history of trauma, it remains unclear whether these findings
are specific to BPD. Increased activity in the IFG [10] and
stronger IFG FC with right cingulate gyrus [131] was also
observed in D-PTSD exposed to autobiographical trauma
scripts [57].

In addition, there is primary evidence for an association
between trait dissociation and alterations in regions of the
DMN (subsystems) such as the PCC, precuneus, hippocam-
pus, and dorsal PFC in BPD. As previously mentioned, the
DMN has been associated with “inward-directed” (self-
referential) processes [79–81]. Again, it remains unclear
whether these alterations in FC are specific to BPD or rather
a trans-diagnostic phenomenon, as alterations in DMN
(regions) were also found in depersonalization disorder [78(cid:129)]
and D-PTSD [87(cid:129)].

Overall Discussion and Conclusion

In this article, we aimed to (1) provide an overview of neuro-
biological models of dissociation and neuroimaging research
in depersonalization disorder, DID, and D-PTSD and (2) to
give an overview of recent neuroimaging studies in BPD that
examined links between dissociation and altered brain func-
tion/structure.

Pathological dissociation is a complex and heterogeneous
phenomenon [2–4, 153], which has been closely linked to
traumatic stress [1, 10]. Dissociation may be a protective strat-
egy to cope with overwhelming emotions in traumatic/
stressful situations [1, 3, 10]. The cost of this subjective de-
tachment appears to be a disruption of mental functions that
are crucial to the development of identity, self-control, and
emotion regulation [1, 16, 36, 37, 116].

The precise neurobiological underpinnings of dissociation
remain elusive, but there is evidence for a link between disso-
ciative states/traits and altered (co)activity in brain regions
involved in emotion processing and memory (e.g., amygdala,
hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and middle/superior
temporal gyrus), interoception and attention regulation
(insula), self-referential processes (e.g., PCC and precuneus),
cognitive control, and arousal modulation (e.g., mPFC, IFC,

Fig. 1 A schematic overview of
brain regions and functions
(among others) associated with
dissociation in borderline
personality disorder. The precise
neurobiological underpinnings of
dissociation remain elusive, but
there is evidence for a link
between dissociative states/traits
and altered (co)activity in brain
networks involved in emotion
processing and memory (e.g.,
amygdala and hippocampus/
medial temporal lobe memory
system), interoception and
attention regulation (insula), self-
referential processes (e.g.,
posterior cingulate cortex and
precuneus), cognitive control, and
arousal modulation (e.g.,
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(dlPFC), inferior frontal gyrus,
and anterior cingulate cortex)—
functions which may be altered
during dissociation

and ACC)—functions which may be altered during dissociation
[1, 9, 10, 11(cid:129)].

Future studies may address how changes in brain activity
during dissociation are related to altered neuropsychological/
cognitive functioning, e.g., encoding and subsequent recall of
emotional information [110(cid:129), 111(cid:129)]. It has been proposed that
dissociation is associated with diminished recollection of
trauma-related emotional information, although heteroge-
neous findings were reported [154–156]. The combination
of dissociation induction and affective–cognitive neuropsy-
chological tasks in neuroimaging research may contribute to
a better understanding of this relationship.

As pointed out before, interpretations of the abovementioned
research are complicated by methodological aspects (e.g., comor-
bidities, shared etiological factors, psychotropic medication, and
differences in gender distribution) but also by conceptual differ-
ences: Dissociation involves a broad range of psychological and
somatoform symptoms [2–4, 153]. A more precise differentia-
tion between dissociative symptoms in future neuroimaging re-
search may help to identify more specific associations [44(cid:129)].

Most studies, summarized in this article, used well-
established psychometric scales of dissociation (e.g., DES or
DSS), showing excellent internal consistency, reliability, and
high specificity and sensitivity to change in symptomatology
[53]. As mentioned above, correlations (e.g., between neuro-
imaging findings and scores on these scales) give an estimate

of the strength of a relationship (e.g., between brain structure/
function and dissociative symptoms) but do not allow causal
conclusions: it remains unclear whether alterations are a pre-
disposition for or the result of frequent dissociation and prob-
ably stem from an interplay of multiple factors. Longitudinal
studies and/or studies applying approaches like dynamic caus-
al modeling are needed to gain more insight into possible
causal relationships. Moreover, other variables that were not
assessed in these studies might have moderated (strengthened/
weakened) or mediated (explained) the relationship. To fur-
ther clarify this, additional longitudinal studies, addressing
possible moderating or mediating factors (e.g., trauma), are
needed. Further limitations include small sample sizes and
sole inclusion of female samples. To gain clearer insight into
the role of dissociation in brain structure and function, studies
with larger data sets in both female and male patients and
meta-analyses are needed to replicate/extend existing
findings.

Possible Clinical Implications

Neuroimaging research on dissociation in BPD can have im-
portant clinical implications. Dissociative symptoms were
found to hinder treatment outcome, possibly by interfering
with habituation processes and new learning: such a negative
effect of dissociative symptoms on treatment outcome has

6 Page 18 of 22

been shown for several disorders [46–50, 129(cid:129)]. While disso-
ciation can be adaptive in certain situations (e.g., in threaten-
ing situations that cannot be escaped or controlled), general-
ized and involuntary dissociative responses can have detri-
mental effects across multiple life domains [9]. Tailored inter-
ventions may help individuals to reduce/control dissociation
at moments when such processes are disruptive and therefore
maladaptive.

So far, neuroimaging studies have mainly focused on iden-
tifying the neural processes possibly underlying dissociation.
As a next step, neuroimaging research may help to identify
neural changes associated with a dissociative-symptom
reduction after tailored interventions [148] and psycho-
therapy outcome [157–159].

Neuroimaging tools such as real-time fMRI may be used to
translate knowledge on possible neural pathways involved in
dissociation into experimental interventions. Real-time fMRI
neurofeedback might be a promising add-on tool in combina-
tion with pharmaco- and psychotherapeutic treatment [148].
As a first step, more pilot studies are needed to identify which
brain regions or functional processes/signals may be suitable
targets for such interventions, as so far very little is known
about the neural mechanisms of change that are key modula-
tors in this relationship.
