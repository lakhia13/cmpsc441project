Abstract

Background:  Menopause presents a period of heightened vulnerability for mental health issues. Despite this, mental health
screening is not consistently integrated into menopausal health care, and access to psychological interventions is limited. Digital
technologies, such as web and smartphone apps, may offer a way to facilitate and improve mental health care provision throughout
menopause. However, little is known about potential users’ intention to use such technologies during this critical phase of life.

Objective:  To examine the factors that impact the intention of potential users to use a mental health app during menopause, we
used the Health Belief Model (HBM), a psychological framework widely used to understand and predict individuals’ health-related
behaviors.

Methods:  An online survey was generated. Convenience sampling was used, with participants recruited via social media and
email, through relevant foundations and support groups, and by word of mouth. Structural equation modeling with maximum
likelihood estimation was conducted to explore whether the factor structure of the HBM is a good fit for predicting the intention
to use a mental health app for menopause. A Cronbach α value of .05 was used for determining statistical significance.
Results:  A total of 1154 participants commenced the survey, of which 82.49% (n=952) completed at least 97% of the survey.
Of these, 86.76% (n=826) expressed that their menopausal symptoms had negatively affected their mental health, and went on
to answer questions regarding their experiences and interest in using a web or smartphone app for mental health symptoms related
to menopause. Data from this subgroup (N=826) were analyzed. In total, 74.09% (n=612) of respondents sought online help for
mental health symptoms related to menopause. The most common topics searched for were symptom characteristics (n=435,
52.66%) and treatment or therapy options (n=210, 25.42%). Psychoeducation (n=514, 62.23%) was the most desired mental
health app feature, followed by symptom tracking (n=499, 60.41%) and self-help tips (n=469, 56.78%). In terms of the intention
to use a mental health app, the Satorra-Bentler–scaled fit statistics indicated a good fit for the model (χ2278=790.44, P<.001;
comparative fit index=0.933, root mean square error of approximation=0.047, standardized root mean square residual=0.056),
with cues to action emerging as the most significant predictor of intention (β=.48, P<.001). This was followed by perceived
barriers (β=–.25, P<.001), perceived susceptibility (β=.15, P<.001), and perceived benefits (β=.13, P<.001). Perceived severity
(β=.01, P=.869) and self-efficacy (β=.03, P=.286) were not significantly associated with behavioral intention.
Conclusions:  This study reveals important factors that influence the intention to use a mental health app during menopause. It
emphasizes the need to address barriers to app usage, while highlighting the impact of credible endorsements and psychoeducation.
Furthermore, the study underscores the significance of improving accessibility for users with lower digital literacy or limited
resources.

Introduction

Menopause represents a significant milestone in a woman’s life
(throughout the study, we refer to a woman as anyone assigned
female at birth). It tends to occur naturally between the ages of
44 and 55 years [1], marking the cessation of menstruation due
to the decline in ovarian follicular function [2]. Perimenopause,
also  known  as  the  menopause  transition,  refers  to  the  phase
leading  up  to  menopause  and  is  characterized  by  a  gradual
decrease in ovarian function, resulting in less frequent menstrual
cycles. This transitional period is estimated to last a median of
4 years [3], signifying an important and transformative stage in
a woman’s reproductive journey.

Every woman’s journey through menopause is unique, but the
associated symptoms and the transitional phase can be incredibly
challenging. Indeed, the menopause and perimenopause phases
are typically associated with physical symptoms (eg, hot flushes,
bone and joint pain, loss of libido) that can have a significant
impact  on  an  individual’s  quality  of  life  [4].  In  addition,
menopause,  and  particularly  the  menopause  transition,  can
increase vulnerability to mental health issues [5], particularly
depression and anxiety [6-8], as well as suicidal ideation [9].
Critically,  despite  several  professional  bodies  recommending
psychological interventions as a primary treatment option for
menopause-related mental health concerns [10-12], access to
these  treatments  is  often  limited  [13],  even  in  high-income
countries, such as the United Kingdom. There is also evidence
to  suggest  that  mental  health  screening  is  not  consistently
integrated into menopausal health care in the United Kingdom
[14], indicating a missed opportunity to identify and address
potential  mental  health  concerns  that  may  arise  during  this
challenging phase of life.

In this regard, digital technologies, such as web and smartphone
apps,  may  offer  a  cost-effective  and  highly  scalable  way  to
facilitate and improve mental health care provision in the United
Kingdom throughout menopause and the menopause transition.
There  is  evidence  to  suggest  that  digital  platforms  have  the
potential  to  enhance  the  reach,  quality,  and  effectiveness  of
mental health care services [15], with the use of digital apps for
screening and monitoring of mental health symptoms showing
promising results across various mental health conditions [16].
Additionally,  evidence  suggests  that  individuals  are  more
inclined to disclose severe symptoms on technology platforms
than  to  a  health  care  professional  (HCP)  [17],  and  patients
appear to value the autonomy and empowerment gained through
the use of digital platforms [18]. Recent evidence also suggests
that  virtual  interventions  have  the  potential  to  improve  both
physical  and  psychosocial  outcomes  of  menopausal  women
[19], but little is known about UK-based perimenopausal and
menopausal women’s intention to use digital technologies for
mental health concerns that may arise during this critical phase
of life.

To  this  end,  we  set  out  to  explore  (1)  experiences  with  and
preferences  toward  mental  health  apps  for  mental  health
concerns related to menopause in the United Kingdom and (2)
factors  that  may  influence  potential  users’ intention  to  use  a
mental health app throughout menopause and the menopause
transition.  To  achieve  the  latter,  we  used  the  Health  Belief
Model (HBM [20]), a psychological framework that seeks to
explain and predict individuals’ health-related behaviors. The
HBM  consists  of  several  key  components,  namely  perceived
susceptibility (an individual’s perception of their vulnerability
or  likelihood  of  experiencing  a  particular  health  condition),
perceived severity (an individuals’ belief about the seriousness
and  potential  consequences  of  a  health  condition),  perceived
benefits (an individuals’ beliefs in the effectiveness and positive
outcomes  of  adopting  a  health-related  behavior),  perceived
barriers  (an  individual’s  assessment  of  obstacles,  costs,  or
negative  aspects  associated  with  adopting  a  health-related
behavior), cues to action (triggers that prompt an individual to
take  action  toward  a  particular  health-related  behavior),  and
self-efficacy  (an 
to
successfully perform a specific health-related behavior).

individual’s  belief 

their  ability 

in 

he HBM has been widely used to understand and promote health
behaviors in various contexts, including disease prevention [21],
health promotion [22], adherence to medical treatments [23],
and  health  behaviors  during  menopause  [24,25].  The  key
objective  of  this  study  was  to  understand  the  health  belief
constructs  that  may  influence  United  Kingdom  women’s
intention to use a mental health app throughout menopause and
the menopause transition. The secondary objective of this study
was to explore online help-seeking behaviors and preferences
in app features in women with experience of menopause-related
mental  health  concerns  in  the  United  Kingdom  (UK).  The
findings  from  this  study  have  important  implications  for  the
development of effective ways to provide digital mental health
care solutions throughout this complex time.

Methods

Overview
This study used data from a UK-wide anonymous online survey
study conducted by the Cambridge Centre for Neuropsychiatric
Research  between  January  and  March  2023  [14].  The  key
objectives of the study were to (1) understand the current state
of care provision offered via health care services in the United
Kingdom throughout menopause and the menopause transition
and (2) explore the use of and interest in digital technologies
for  mental  health  throughout  menopause  and  the  menopause
transition. To this end, an anonymous online survey was created
using Qualtrics XM. The survey could be completed in 15-20
minutes  and  comprised  5  sections:  (1)  sociodemographic
information, (2) health care provision throughout menopause,
(3)  mental  health  symptoms  and  care  provision  throughout
menopause, (4) menopause-specific quality-of-life symptoms,

and (5) experiences and interest in using a web or smartphone
app for mental health symptoms related to menopause.

The latter section also included 26 items pertaining to HBM
constructs (see Table 1 for a description of the constructs and
list  of  items  in  the  study).  Items  were  developed  based  on
previous research [26,27] and in consultation with a practicing

psychiatrist (author SB) and a patient and public involvement
(PPI) panel of members with lived experience of mental health
concerns. Items were rated on a 6-point  Likert-scale, from 1
(strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). For the purpose of this
study, only data from sections 1 and 5 were included. The survey
was  adaptive  in  nature,  meaning  that  only  relevant  questions
were asked based on responses to previous questions.

Participants
Convenience  sampling  was  used,  with  participants  recruited
between January and March 2023 via email, paid Facebook and
Instagram  advertisements,  organic  posts  on  the  Cambridge
Centre for Neuropsychiatric Research Facebook and X (formerly

known  as  Twitter)  pages,  and  Reddit.  Recruitment  messages
were also disseminated by word of mouth and through relevant
foundations and support groups. Inclusion criteria for the study
were as follows: (1) age≥18 years, (2) UK residence, and (3)
must be currently experiencing symptoms of menopause or the
menopause  transition  (eg,  hot  flushes,  mood  changes,  night

sweats,  irregular  or  absent  periods,  decreased  sex  drive).
Participants were also required to not be currently pregnant or
breastfeeding and not have been diagnosed with a mental health
condition in order to take part in the study. Participants of any
gender (ie, female, male, nonbinary, other, those preferring not
to answer) could take part in the study, provided that they met
the inclusion criteria (note that we used the term “women” to
refer to all participants in the study).

Menopause status was based on the definitions put forth by the
Study  of  Women’s  Health  Across  the  Nation  (SWAN  [28]).
Those  in  the  menopause  transition  included  individuals  who
self-reported  being  in  the  early  or  late  perimenopause  stages
(ie, those experiencing significant changes in their menstrual
cycles not due to pregnancy, breastfeeding, stress, or a medical
condition  or  who  had  not  had  menstrual  bleeding  for  3-11
months not due to pregnancy, breastfeeding, stress, or a medical
condition).  Those  in  menopause  had  undergone  12  months
without menstrual bleeding not due to pregnancy, breastfeeding,
or stress, as well as those who had undergone medically induced
menopause.

Participants were invited to enter their email for the chance to
win 1 of 3 GB £50 (US $67) Highstreet vouchers. Participants
were able to withdraw from the study at any point.

Data Analysis
Descriptive  statistics  were  conducted  in  IBM  SPSS  version
28.0.1.1. Figures were created using Microsoft Excel version
2206 and Microsoft PowerPoint version 2206 (Microsoft Office
365). HBM data were analyzed in Stata version 17.0 (StataCorp)
[29].  Mean  scores  per  HMB  construct  were  obtained  by
summing the corresponding HBM constructs and dividing the
sum  by  the  number  of  items.  Structural  equation  modeling
(SEM) with maximum likelihood estimation was conducted to
explore whether the factor structure of the HBM is a good fit
for predicting the intention to use a digital mental health app
for mental health–related symptoms that can arise as a result of
menopause or the menopause transition. All exogenous latent

commonly reported to evaluate fit, and a good model should
present  with  a  P value  above  the  0.05  threshold  [30],  it  is
sensitive to sample size. As such, it is not necessarily a reliable
basis for the acceptance or rejection of a model [31-33]. For
this  reason,  we  also  evaluated  the  model  fit  using  the
comparative  fit  index  (CFI),  the  root  mean  square  error  of
approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square
residual (SRMR), as is the recommendation [34]. A good model
fit for the purposes of the study satisfied a CFI value of 0.90,
an RMSEA below 0.60, and an SRMS of less than 0.08 [35].
A Cronbach α value of 0.05 was used for determining statistical
significance.

Ethical Considerations
The study was approved by the University of Cambridge Human
Psychology  Research  Ethics  Committee  (approval  number
PRE.2022.110).  All  participants  provided  informed  consent
electronically to participate in the study.

Results

Sociodemographic Characteristics
Participants’ sociodemographic  information  across  the  entire
sample can be found in Table 2. A total of 1154 participants
commenced the survey, of which 82.49% (n=952) completed
at  least  97%  of  the  survey  (this  completion  rate  ensured  no
missing  data  for  the  analysis  of  interest).  Of  these,  86.76%
(n=826)  expressed  that  their  menopausal  symptoms  had
negatively affected their mental health, and went on to answer
questions in section 5 (ie, experiences and interest in using a
web or smartphone app for mental health symptoms related to
menopause). Data from this subgroup (N=826) were analyzed.
The average age was 50.28 (SD 5.08) years, with the majority
of  respondents  self-identifying  as  female  (n=811,  98.18%),
being White (n=803, 97.22%), having at least an undergraduate
degree  (n=501,  60.65%),  and  being  married  or  in  a  civil
partnership  (n=518,  62.71%).  Regarding  accommodation
characteristics,  living  with  a  partner  and  children  (n=375,
45.39%) and living with a partner (n=281, 34.02%) were the
most common arrangements. In addition, 85.47% (n=706) were
employed, and 61.14% (n=505) had a household income of at
least GB £35,001 (US $46,787) before tax.

Experiences and Interest in Using Digital Technology
for Mental Health Symptoms Related to Menopause
A summary of respondents’ experiences and interest in using
digital technology for mental health symptoms related to the
menopause can be found in Figure 1. In total, 74.09% (n=612)
of respondents had sought help online regarding mental health
symptoms related to menopause (Figure 1A), with the help most
commonly searched for including looking for information about
symptom  characteristics  (n=435,  52.66%)  and  treatment  or
therapy options (n=210, 25.42%), as shown in Figure 1B. When

respondents were asked to select features for their ideal mental
health app, the most sought for feature was psychoeducation
(ie, gaining a better understanding of one’s mental health state;
n=514,  62.23%),  as  shown  in  Figure  1C.  This  was  closely
followed by the capability to track symptoms over time (n=499,
60.41%) and self-help tips (n=469, 56.78%), as shown in Figure
1C. When asked about willingness to pay for a mental health
assessment app, 63.80% (n=527) of respondents said they would
not be willing to pay, while 21.19% (n=175) said they would
pay  as  a  one-off  service  and  15.01%  (n=124)  as  a
subscription-based service (Figure 1D).

Structural Equation Modeling
Descriptive statistics for the HBM constructs, including internal
consistency scores (overall Cronbach α=.74) can be found in
Table 3, with a correlation matrix of the constructs presented
in Table 4. The mean behavioral intention score was 4.51 (SD

1.14), indicating an interest in using an app for mental health
symptoms related to menopause, and behavioral intention was
seen to be significantly correlated to all HBM constructs (all
r=0.20-0.66,  all  P<.01).  Perceived  barriers  were  negatively
correlated with behavioral intention (r=–0.40, P<.01).

Our analyses revealed that the constructs of perceived severity,
perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, perceived barriers,
cues  to  action,  and  self-efficacy  explained  58.59%  of  the
variance in behavioral intention. The most important predictor
of intention was cues to action (β=.48, P<.001; eg, the app being
developed by psychiatrists or a reputable academic institution,
the app being recommended by an HCP or the National Health
Service  [NHS]).  This  was  followed  by  perceived  barriers
(β=–.25, P<.001; eg, not feeling comfortable having symptoms
assessed  by  a  mental  health  app,  the  app  not  being  able  to
understand  mental  health  symptoms  related  to  menopause),
which  was  negatively  associated  with  behavioral  intention.

behavioral  intention.  However,  perceived  severity  (β=.01,

having negative consequences on one’s life) and self-efficacy
(β=.03,  P=.286;  eg,  having  the  necessary  resources  to  use  a

behavioral intention.

Discussion

Principal Findings
The  key  objective  of  this  study  was  to  explore  women’s
intention to use a mental health app throughout menopause and
the menopause transition. The secondary objective of this study

was  to  explore  previous  online  help-seeking  behaviors  and
preferences  in  features  for  apps  designed  for  women  with
experience  of  menopause-related  mental  health  concerns.
Overall,  the  vast  majority  of  women  had  turned  to  online
resources for assistance with mental health concerns associated
with menopause. The type of help most frequently searched for
online 
symptom
characteristics and exploring treatment or therapy options. When
asked  about  their  preferred  features  in  a  mental  health  app,
psychoeducation, which involves gaining a better understanding
of  one’s  mental  health  condition,  was  the  most  frequently
selected  feature.  This  was  closely  followed  by  the  ability  to
track symptoms over time and access self-help tips. In regard
to the intention to use an app based on the HBM, we found that
cues to action was the strongest predictor of women’s intention
to  adopt  the  app.  This  was  followed  by  perceived  barriers,
perceived susceptibility, and perceived benefits. On the other
hand, perceived severity and self-efficacy were not significantly
associated with intention to use the app.

Regarding cues to action, the importance of a mental health app
being  developed  by  psychiatrists  or  a  reputable  academic
institution were recognized as key factors driving cues to action
and, in turn, the intention to use the app, supporting previous
research [36]. Additionally, receiving active recommendations
for an app from HCPs was identified as an excellent strategy
to  encourage  adoption,  aligning  with  previous  studies  [37].
These findings emphasize the significance of establishing strong
collaborations between app developers, reputable organizations
(eg, the NHS and academic institutions), and HCPs. Actively
involving  these  partners  in  the  development,  promotion,  and
endorsement  of  a  mental  health  app  is  likely  to  significantly
enhance positive attitudes and intentions toward its adoption.
Moreover, leveraging the authority and influence of HCPs and
health  care  systems  can  help  address  concerns  or  skepticism
regarding the app’s effectiveness, reliability, and suitability for
managing mental health symptoms related to menopause.

Perceived  barriers,  such  as  discomfort  with  an  app  assessing
one’s mental health symptoms and doubts about the app’s ability
to  understand  the  complexity  of  mental  health  issues,  were
identified  as  significant  barriers  for  app  usage.  Interestingly,
evidence  indicates  that  individuals  tend  to  feel  more  at  ease
disclosing sensitive health information digitally than to an HCP
[17].  However,  app  developers  must  be  mindful  of  fostering
trust by providing clear and transparent app descriptions and
privacy  policies  to  users  [38,39],  as  not  doing  so  can
inadvertently create a sense of mistrust. Research also suggests
that users feel more comfortable with certain app features, such
as appointment reminders, compared to passive data-tracking
features,  such  as  GPS  and  call/text  log  monitoring  [40].
Therefore,  app  developers  need  to  investigate  perceptions  of
trust  of  specific  app  features  in  their  population  of  interest.
Regarding concerns about an app’s ability to understand mental
health  symptoms,  developers  should  thoroughly  assess  its
effectiveness  and  feasibility  in  the  intended  population  [41].
the  creation  of  a  high-quality
This  approach  ensures 
evidence-based  assessment  and  fosters  trust  among  users.
Consequently, HCPs can rely on this evidence to confidently
suggest or refer to clinically safe and effective technologies.

Regarding perceived susceptibility, women who believed they
were more susceptible to mental health symptoms were more
likely  to  express  an  intention  to  use  a  mental  health  app.  In
particular, women who viewed their lifestyle and life stressors
as key drivers of poor mental health were more likely to state
an interest in using an app. Indeed, there is a well-established
correlation between modifiable lifestyle factors and poor mental
health during menopause. For instance, having a high BMI and
leading a sedentary lifestyle are both linked to increased odds
of  experiencing  mental  health  issues  [42,43].  Additionally,  a
recent  systematic  review  revealed  that  stressful  life  events
occurring during menopause, including illness, marital discord,
and situations where children leave home or face difficulties in
pursuing higher education or finding employment, are linked
with  increased  rates  of  depression  and  anxiety  during  this
transitional  phase  [44].  Considering  these  findings,  app
developers may find it beneficial to adopt a holistic approach
to  mental  health  care  by  providing  women  with  tips  on
maintaining a healthy lifestyle and reducing stress during this
challenging phase of life, as the inclusion of such features is
likely to be attractive to those most willing to use a mental health
app.

When  considering  the  perceived  benefits  of  using  a  mental
health app, an improved understanding of menopause-related
mental  health  symptoms  was  found  to  have  the  potential  to
alleviate  the  burden  of  mental  health  symptoms,  as  well  as
encourage  formal  help-seeking  behavior.  In  this  regard,
increased awareness and discussions about menopause and its
associated mental health implications in public health campaigns
and  the  media  can  facilitate  women’s  understanding  of  their
vulnerability to these symptoms and, in turn, motivate them to
adopt a mental health app as a proactive measure for self-care
and  mental  health  symptom  management.  Notably,  research
has highlighted that a better understanding and awareness of
menopause  and  its  transition  allow  women  to  feel  more
empowered  to  make  better  health  care  decisions  during  this
phase  of  life  [45].  Similarly,  providing  individuals  with
information about mental health symptoms and conditions via
the  means  of  psychoeducation,  for  instance,  can  increase
symptom  knowledge  and  has  been  demonstrated  to  boost
intention to seek help, as well as improve patient engagement
and  adherence  to  HCPs’ recommendations  [39,46,47].  It  is
crucial,  therefore,  for  app  developers  to  explore  potential
collaborations with public health bodies or the media who are
delivering  menopause  education,  as  well  as  identify  any
opportunities

to  empower 

In this study, both perceived severity and self-efficacy were not
significant  drivers  of  app  usage.  Regarding  the  former,  it  is
often  assumed  that  individuals  who  perceive  their  symptoms
as more severe would be more motivated to use a mental health
app as a means of managing and addressing their symptoms.
However, contrary to this expectation, the study findings did
not support a significant relationship between perceived severity
and the intention to use a mental health app. Notably, previous
studies have reported similar findings, indicating that perceived

JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH

Martin-Key et al

severity does not significantly predict health-related behaviors
in  various  contexts.  For  instance,  research  has  shown  that
perceived  severity  is  not  a  significant  factor  in  determining
behaviors such as facemask use [48], vaccine uptake [49], and
adoption of contact-tracing apps [26]. In addition, a qualitative
study investigating methods of optimizing smartphone apps for
cardiovascular disease did not find perceived severity to be a
key driver of app usage [50].

In terms of self-efficacy, the majority of women in this study
expressed confidence in their ability to use a mental health app
and had the necessary resources for its use. This confidence can
be attributed to the widespread prevalence of smartphones in
the  United  Kingdom,  and  it  is  likely  that  the  study  sample
consisted  of  individuals  with  a  high  level  of  digital  literacy.
Although  perceived  self-efficacy  had  no  influence  on  the
intention  to  use  a  mental  health  app,  app  developers  should
focus  on  strategies  that  promote  sustained  app  engagement.
Improving  ease  of  use  and  providing  in-app  guidance  have
proven effective in increasing app usage [51]. Furthermore, to
ensure inclusivity and reach individuals who may benefit from
an  app  but  lack  the  necessary  resources,  developers  should
consider incorporating features such as offline functionality or
the  option  to  complete  a  mental  health  assessment  via  text
messaging.  These  measures  have  the  potential  to  enhance
accessibility, particularly for hard-to-reach women.

Limitations
The  participants  in  this  study  exhibited  characteristics  that
differed from the general UK population in several ways. They
had higher levels of education, a higher household income, and
a  higher  proportion  of  White  individuals.  As  a  result,  it  is
important to acknowledge that the views expressed in this study
may not provide a comprehensive representation of the broader
UK  population.  Specifically,  the  perspectives  of  ethnic
minorities  and  disadvantaged  populations  in  the  United
Kingdom, who may face additional barriers or have different
attitudes toward using digital solutions for menopause-related
concerns,  may  be  underrepresented.  Furthermore,  it  is  worth
noting that the primary method of participant recruitment for
this study was through social media channels. This means that
the respondents in this study are more likely to possess high
levels of digital literacy skills and may have a greater inclination

to use digital tools for health care purposes. Considering these
factors is crucial when interpreting the findings of this study
and extending them to the wider UK population.

Of  note,  although  the  HBM  constructs  included  in  the  study
were codesigned with a psychiatrist and reviewed by individuals
with  lived  experience  of  mental  health  concerns,  there  is  a
possibility that some items may not fully capture the experiences
of  individuals  with  mental  health  symptoms  related  to
menopause  or  that  certain  important  aspects  may  have  been
missed. Additionally, since the HBM constructs were developed
specifically  for  this  study  and  have  not  undergone  prior
validation,  there  is  a  potential  for  measurement  inaccuracies
and biases in the findings. As a result, the study’s conclusions
should be interpreted with this limitation in mind.

In addition, it is worth noting that the data were nonnormally
distributed, with a high proportion of respondents selecting the
lowest  and  highest  response  options.  Although  our  analyses
accounted for this, this nonnormality may still have implications
for the interpretability of our model. For instance, the presence
of ceiling and floor effects may have reduced the variability in
our data, potentially obscuring more subtle relationships between
variables.  This  could  limit  the  ability  of  the  model  to  fully
capture the complexity of the constructs under investigation.

Conclusion
This  study  sheds  light  on  behavioral  drivers  influencing  the
intention to use a mental health app during menopause and the
menopause  transition.  Notably,  credible  endorsements  from
reputable  sources,  addressing  perceived  barriers,  such  as
concerns  about  the  efficacy  of  a  mental  health  app,  and
enhancing  mental  health  literacy  through  psychoeducation,
emerged as significant factors in encouraging app usage. App
developers should consider these insights during development
and promotion to create apps that can positively impact mental
health  during  this  challenging  life  phase.  Additionally,
considering features that enhance accessibility for users with
lower digital literacy or limited resources will ensure inclusivity
and reach a broader audience. By integrating these strategies,
app  developers  can  offer  valuable  support  and  care  to  those
facing  mental  health  challenges  related  to  menopause  and
contribute to their overall well-being.
