Plain language summary 

This study helps capture aspects of 
caregiver burden for parents caring for 
children with hemophilia A (HA). We 
used medical and pharmacy claims to 
compare the amount of mental and 
nonmental health care use between 
parents of children with and without 
HA. There was a trend toward higher 
health care costs for parents of children 
with HA. This was significant with 
mental health care use when parents 
with HA themselves were excluded, 
which strongly suggests a link between 
mental health burden and caregiving 
in HA.

Implications for  
managed care pharmacy 

Caregiving for children with HA can 
be burdensome and may translate 
to higher utilization of health care 
resources at a family level that should be 
considered in payers’ value assessment 
frameworks. Differentiation of therapies 
by nontraditional value elements, such as 
caregiver burden, helps payers prioritize 
patient access to high-value therapies 
and inform policies that not only support 
pediatric patients with HA but also 
support parent caregivers, especially if 
newer therapies have the potential to 
decrease their health care costs.

ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND: Caring for children with 
hemophilia A (HA) impacts many aspects of 
parents’ lives. How this translates to caregiv-
ers’ utilization of health services is unknown, 
and its elicitation can inform future evalua-
tions of interventions that address caregiver 
burden for HA. 

OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of 
caring for children with HA on parents’ 
utilization of nonmental and mental health 
services by comparing 1-year costs and 
number of claims with parents of children 
without HA. 

METHODS: Retrospective matched cohort 
study using MarketScan commercial medi-
cal and pharmacy claims from 2011 to 2019. 
Children with HA were male sex, aged young-
er than 18 years, dependent policyholders, 
and had at least 1 HA-related medical claim 

from 2011 to 2018 and either an HA-related 

procedure or drug claim. Parents of children 

with HA (PCH) were primary or secondary 

policyholders, shared the same family ID 

as children with HA, and were continu-

ously enrolled for 1-year post-index. PCH 

were matched (1:2) with parents of children 

without HA on age, sex, beneficiary type, 

child’s age, number of children, index month 

and year, health plan type, employment 

status, and region. Primary outcomes were 

nonmental and mental health care costs 

(2020 US dollars). Secondary outcomes were 

number of nonmental health outpatient 

claims and utilization of mental health out-

patient or drug claim. Subgroup analyses 

excluding parents with HA were also con-

ducted. Productivity loss was also explored. 

Outcomes were compared using 2-sided, 

paired t-tests, and McNemar test.

RESULTS: 1,068 PCH met inclusion criteria 
and were matched to 2,122 control parents. 
Mean 1-year cost for PCH was higher for 
nonmental health (mean difference $1,826 
[95% CI = −1,000 to 4,652; P = 0.20]) and similar 
for mental health services (mean difference 
$14 [95% CI = −77 to 105; P = 0.76]). When par-
ents with HA were excluded in the subgroup 
analyses, mental health cost was significantly 
higher for PCH (mean difference $676 [95% 
CI = 399 to 953; P < 0.001]). PCH had more non-
mental health outpatient claims compared 
with parents of children without HA (mean 
difference 1.9 [95% CI = −1.1 to 4.9; P = 0.21]) 
and were 1.2 times (95% CI = 0.99 to 1.45; 
P = 0.07) more likely to have a mental health 
outpatient or drug claim. 

CONCLUSIONS: PCH had moderately higher 
health care costs and utilization compared 
with parents of children without HA; however, 
these results were not statistically significant.

Future studies to better characterize HA disease severity and assess 
its impact on caregiver burden or to expand caregivers to spouses of 
adult patients with HA may be warranted. Limitations include inabil-
ity to ascertain severity of HA in children and the use of claims data 
to capture complex effects on health care utilization. 

Hemophilia  A  (HA)  is  a  rare,  genetic  bleeding  disorder 
caused by a deficiency in factor VIII (FVIII) and occurs pre-
dominantly  in  male  individuals.1  Disease  severity  depends 
on  FVIII  levels  and  is  associated  with  frequency  of  bleeds, 
which can occur at muscles and joints, and are sometimes 
fatal.1,2  Complications  can  be  long  term  and  include  pain, 
arthropathy,  and  a  negative  impact  on  physical  function-
ing and quality of life.2 Current prophylaxis and treatment 
options include infusions of FVIII or injections with a bispe-
cific antibody designed to mimic the function of FVIII. Gene 
therapies are currently in development.3,4 

Diagnosis typically occurs in the first 3 years of life, and 
thus parents are often the primary caregivers.5,6 A body of 
qualitative evidence informs our current understanding of 
the experience of parent caregivers. Caregivers have dem-
onstrated  substantial  burden,  reporting  most  frequently 
emotional  stress,  financial  burden,  and  time  required.7 
Additional  focus  group  interviews  highlighted  stress  and 
difficulty  as  caregivers  cope  with  their  child’s  disease.8 
Studies  in  hemophilia  caregivers  have  used  various  vali-
dated  instruments,  including  the  CarerQol,  Hemophilia 
Quality  of  Life  Questionnaire  for  Adults,  and  Parental 
Needs  Scale  for  Rare  Diseases,  that  have  also  captured 
the previously mentioned experiences, as well as depres-
sion, anxiety, and economic impact due to lost days from 
work.6,8,9-13 No studies have yet compared productivity loss 
(ie, work time lost) between parent caregivers of children 
with and without HA in the United States.6,11 However, how 
these  emotional,  mental,  and  financial  effects  translate 
to  parents’  utilization  of  health  care  is  unknown.  We 
hypothesized  that  we  would  observe  lower  costs  and 
utilization  of  nonmental  health  services  for  parents  of 
children  with  HA,  potentially  driven  by  these  parents 
seeking  less  health  care,  such  as  preventative  services, 
because of financial burden and personal sacrifice of time. 
In  addition,  we  hypothesized  higher  costs  and  utilization 
for mental health services for parents of children with HA, 
potentially driven by the negative impact on emotional and 
mental health for these parents. 

Attention  to  measuring  and  communicating  the  value 
of  health  technologies  has  increased  in  the  United  States, 
especially  for  those  that  are  priced  high  and  indicated  for 

rare diseases such as HA. However, the need for a broader 
value  framework  continues  to  be  debated.14,15  Quantifying 
caregiver  impact  and  productivity  loss  is  increasingly 
important  to  help  inform  these  broader  value  frameworks 
and debate on their use.14 

Accordingly,  the  aim  of  this  analysis  is  to  capture  the 
health care burden of a pediatric HA diagnosis on parents 
of  children  with  HA  through  a  retrospective  claims  and 
productivity  database  analysis.  More  specifically,  the  fol-
lowing  research  question  will  be  addressed:  is  a  pediatric 
HA  diagnosis  associated  with  parents’  utilization  of  non-
mental  health  and  mental  health–related  services  as  well 
as  productivity  loss?  This  information  can  be  used  to  aid 
decision  makers  under  budgetary  constraints  to  evaluate 
and compare new technologies for HA. The primary objec-
tives  were  to  compare  mean  1-year  health  care  costs  for 
parents of children with and without HA for (1) nonmental 
health and (2) mental health services. The secondary objec-
tives were to compare (1) mean number of nonmental health 
outpatient  services  and  (2)  utilization  of  mental  health 
outpatient services or drugs. An exploratory objective was 
to  compare  work  hours  lost  between  parents  of  children 
with and without HA.

Methods 

STUDY DESIGN AND DATA SOURCE 
This  was  a  retrospective,  cross-sectional  matched  cohort 
study using medical and drug claims to compare nonmen-
tal and mental health care costs, as well as utilization and 
absenteeism, between parents who have children with and 
without HA.

The IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters 
(CCAE)  and  Health  Productivity  Management  (HPM) 
databases,  consisting  of  data  collected  from  employers, 
were  used  to  capture  health  care  costs,  utilization,  and 
work  hours  lost  because  of  absenteeism.  The  CCAE  data-
base  includes  deidentified  medical  and  drug  claims  for 
a  nationally  representative  sample  of  individuals  with 
employer-sponsored private health insurance in the United 
States.16  The  HPM  database  includes  data  on  workplace 
absence, short-term and long-term disability, and workers’ 
compensation  for  a  subset  of  the  population  in  the  CCAE 
database.16  Data  from  the  HPM  database  can  be  linked  to 
medical  and  pharmacy  claims  for  included  employees.16  A 
Family Identifier field, which links family members enrolled 
together under a single health insurance policy, was added 
to the MarketScan CCAE database in 2011.17 Thus, the study 
period was from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2019, when 
latest  data  were  available.  Both  databases  adhered  to  the

Washington  was  not  required,  as  no  risk  to  study  partici-

SAMPLE 
Children With HA. Patients with HA were identified with 
the following criteria: (1) younger than age 18 years, (2) male 
sex, (3) child or dependent status on the insurance policy, 
(4)  no  more  than  1  inpatient  or  outpatient  medical  claim 
with  an  HA  diagnosis  code  (International  Classification 
of  Diseases,  Ninth  Revision  [ICD-9],  or  International 
Classification  of  Diseases,  Tenth  Revision  [ICD-10],  code: 
ICD-9  286.0  or  1CD-10  D66),  and  (5)  either  an  HA-related 
medical procedure or drug claim (Supplementary Table 1, 
available  in  online  article).  These  criteria  were  informed 
by previous MarketScan claims studies.18-21 Only male par-
ticipants were included in the children with HA population 
because  hemophilia  is  rare  in  female  individuals,  and  the 
optimal  approach  to  identify  them  is  unknown.22  Female 
participants  with  an  HA-related  claim  are  likely  carriers, 
have  another  coagulation  disorder,  or  were  miscoded.18,22 
One of the child’s HA-related medical claims between 2011 
and 2018 was randomly chosen as the parent’s index date 
to address calendar year and within year biases. 

Parents of Children With HA. Parents of children with HA 
were identified who met the following criteria: (1) primary 
or secondary policyholder, (2) shared the same family ID as 
an HA child, (3) medical data available 1-year pre-index, and 
(3) continuous enrollment 1-year post-index. Primary and 
secondary  beneficiaries  under  the  same  insurance  policy 
as  children  with  HA  were  assumed  to  be  parents  as  well 
as  primary  caregivers.23  Both  parents,  if  available,  were 
included in analyses as individual parents to increase sam-
ple  size  and  because  both  may  be  involved  in  caregiving. 
If a parent was identified more than once (ie, a duplicate) 
because he or she was linked to more than 1 HA child, then 
the  parent  was  included  only  once  to  avoid  inflating  uti-
lization  and  costs.  Parents’  medical  claims  data  from  the 
1-year  period  before  the  index  date  were  used  to  calcu-
late  their  Charlson  Comorbidity  Index  (CCI),  which  is  the 
most extensively studied comorbidity index that takes into 
account the number and seriousness of comorbid diseases 
(Supplementary Table 2).24,25 

Parents Without Children With HA. Control parents were 
identified  who  met  the  following  criteria:  (1)  primary  or 
secondary  policyholder,  (2)  shared  the  same  family  ID  as 
a  child  aged  younger  than  18  years  and  at  least  1  non-HA 
medical  claim,  (3)  medical  data  available  1-year  pre-index, 

and  (4)  continuous  enrollment  1-year  post-index.  Control 
parents  were  excluded  if  their  child  had  an  HA-related 
medical  claim  during  the  same  year  as  the  child’s  non-HA 
medical claim and the 1-year post-index period. Index dates 
for  control  parents  were  randomly  assigned  in  the  year  of 
the non-HA child’s medical claim, which was also randomly 
selected from 2011 to 2018.

Matching. Parents of children with HA and control parents 
were matched 1:2 (to maximize sample size) by the following 
variables: (1) parent age (± 5 years), (2) parent sex, (3) parent 
beneficiary  type  (ie,  primary  or  secondary  policy  holder), 
(4) child’s age (± 3 years), (5) number of children within the 
family, (6) health insurance plan type (health maintenance 
organization  vs  preferred  provider  organization  vs  other), 
(7)  employment  status  (full-time  vs  not  full-time),  (8)  CCI, 
(9) region, (10) index month (± 3 months), and (11) index year. 
Once  parents  of  children  without  HA  were  identified,  the 
number of children dependents enrolled under the parents’ 
family  ID  was  counted  to  identify  the  number  of  children 
within the family. 

OUTCOMES 
Primary  Outcomes.  The  primary  outcomes  were  mean 
1-year cost for all (1) nonmental health services and (2) men-
tal health services. Services included inpatient, outpatient, 
and  drug  claims.  Mental  health  services  were  (1)  medical 
claims  coded  “mental”  in  the  major  diagnostic  category 
field, which indicates the body system– or disease-related 
groupings  of  clinical  conditions  based  on  diagnosis  codes, 
or (2) drug claims coded as “antidepressants” or “anxiolytic/
sedative/hypnotic”  in  the  therapeutic  class  field,  which 
indicates  the  therapeutic/pharmacologic  category  of  the 
drug product.26 Nonmental health services were all claims 
not coded for mental health services. Costs were reported 
in 2020 US dollars using the medical care component of the 
Consumer Price Index for urban consumers.27

Secondary Outcomes. Secondary outcomes were intended 
to capture the volume of nonmental health services sought 
by parents and utilization of mental health services. Thus, 
secondary  outcomes  were  (1)  mean  number  of  nonmental 
health  medical  outpatient  claims,  excluding  emergency 
department  (ED)  visits  and  (2)  utilization  of  mental  health 
medical  outpatient  services,  excluding  ED  visits  or  drug 
claims  coded  as  mental  health  related  during  the  1-year 
post-index period. 

Subgroup Analysis. In a subgroup analysis, parents with an 
HA-related claim were excluded. HA is an inherited disease 
not captured in the CCI, and some parents of children with 
HA  likely  have  HA  themselves.1  An  HA  diagnosis  in  adult

Exploratory  Outcome.  Workplace 
productivity loss, defined as hours lost 
due  to  absenteeism,  was  measured 
during  the  1-year  post-index  period 
for primary beneficiaries in the popu-
lation.  Reported  reasons  for  absence 
could 
include  sickness,  disability, 
leave,  recreational,  Family  Medical 
Leave Act, and other.28 

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Baseline  characteristics  were  sum-
marized using mean and SD or median 
and  IQR  for  continuous  variables  and 
count  and  percentage  for  categorical 
variables. Differences in mental health 
and  HA  diagnoses  between  the  2 
cohorts pre-index were assessed using 
a  2-sided  paired  t-test  with  a  signifi-
cance level of 5%. Means and SDs were 
reported  for  both  primary  outcomes, 
the  secondary  outcome  for  nonmen-
tal  health  outpatient  services,  and 
exploratory  outcome  for  hours  lost. 
These  outcomes  were  also  assessed 
using  a  2-sided  paired  t-test  with  a 
significance  level  of  5%.  McNemar 
test was used to report an odds ratio 
(OR) with a 95% CI and P value for the 
proportion of parents who used men-
tal health services. Mean costs for the 
primary outcomes were also stratified 
by parent beneficiary type and plotted 
on a histogram to better visualize cost 
differences between the overall popu-
lation and beneficiary types. Datasets 
were  constructed  in  SAS  version  9.4 
(SAS  Institute),  and  analyses  were 
performed  in  RStudio  version  1.4.1106 
(RStudio, PBC).

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
To  check  the  robustness  of  the 
results from the primary analysis, we 
adjusted  for  the  matching  variables 
in  an  unmatched  population.  These

variables  were  included  in  regression  models  for  1,068 

parents  of  children  with  HA  and  4,272  randomly  selected 

control  parents  (4  times  the  number  of  matched  parents 

of children with HA to maximize the sample size). A 2-part 

model was chosen to fit the data for mean health care costs. 

Results 

BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS

Of 305.8 million enrollees identified between 2011 and 2018, 

a total of 1,580 children with HA were identified. These chil-

dren shared the same family ID with 1,068 unique parents 

that met inclusion criteria (Supplementary Table 3). Nearly 

all  parents  were  matched  to  2  controls,  except  14  parents, 

for a total of 2,122 control parents. Parents had a median age 

of  41  years,  were  mostly  female  (59%),  were  primary  poli-

cyholders (55%), had no comorbidities captured by the CCI 

(85%),  and  worked  full-time  (67%;  Table  1).  For  unmatched 

baseline  characteristics,  parents  of  children  with  HA  had 

more  mental  health  diagnoses  (15%  vs  12%;  P = 0.053)  and 

HA diagnoses (4% vs 1%; P < 0.001) pre-index compared with 

controls (Table 1).

PRIMARY OUTCOMES: COSTS FOR MENTAL AND 
NONMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES
The  mean  cost  for  nonmental  health  services  was  higher 
for parents of children with HA compared with control par-
ents  ($8,154  vs  $6,328),  but  the  mean  difference  of  $1,826 
(95%  CI = −1,000  to  4,652)  was  not  statistically  significant 
(Figure  1).  The  mean  cost  for  mental  health  services  was 
similar for parents of children with HA compared with con-
trol parents ($255 vs $241); (mean difference $14 [95% CI = −77 
to  105;  P = 0.76];  Figure  1).  Costs  for  parents  who  were  pri-
mary  and  secondary  policyholders  were  also  stratified  by 
policyholder type (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2).

SECONDARY OUTCOMES: UTILIZATION OF MENTAL 
AND NONMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES 
The  mean  number  of  nonmental  health  outpatient  claims 
(excluding ED visits) was slightly higher for parents of chil-
dren with HA compared with control parents (28.3 vs 26.4), 
but the mean difference of 1.9 (95% CI = −1.1 to 4.9) was not 
statistically  significant  (P = 0.21;  Table  2).  Parents  of  chil-
dren with HA were 1.2 times more likely to have a mental 
health outpatient (excluding ED visits) or pharmacy claim 
as  compared  with  control  parents  (95%  CI = 0.99  to  1.45; 
P = 0.07; Table 2). 

SUBGROUP ANALYSIS OF PARENTS WITHOUT  
HISTORY OF HEMOPHILIA 
In  a  subgroup  analysis,  parents  with  HA  were  excluded 
(43 parents of children with HA and 1 control parent). Given 
the  low  attrition  (44  of  3,190),  baseline  characteristics  for 
the  subgroup  analysis  were  not  assessed,  as  they  were 
unlikely to be meaningful. Differences in 1-year mean cost 
for  nonmental  health  services  ($1,402  [95%  CI = −1,430  to 
4,236; P = 0.33]) and number of nonmental health outpatient 
claims (1.9 [95% CI = −1.6 to 3.9; P = 0.40]) were not significant 
between parents of children with HA and controls. However, 
parents of children with HA had a significantly higher 1-year 
mean  cost  for  mental  health  services,  with  a  mean  dif-
ference  of  $676  (95%  CI = 399  to  953;  P < 0.001).  Parents  of 
children with HA were also 1.2 times more likely to have a 
mental  health  outpatient  or  pharmacy  claim  (95%  CI = 1.01 
to 1.51; P = 0.04).

EXPLORATORY OUTCOME: PRODUCTIVITY
The  mean  number  of  hours  lost  was  lower  for  parents  of 
children with HA who were primary beneficiaries, as com-
pared with control parents who were primary beneficiaries 
(10.7 vs 16.9), but the mean difference of −6.4 (95% CI = −13 to 
0.4) was not statistically significant (Table 2).

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Parents  of  children  with  HA  were  significantly  more  likely 
to incur mental health costs (OR 1.20 [95% CI = 1.03 to 1.40; 
P = 0.02];  Supplementary  Table  4).  Among  parents  who  did 
have  mental  health  costs,  the  cost  difference  between 
parents  of  children  with  HA  and  control  parents  was  not 
significant. Likelihood of incurring nonmental health costs 
(OR 1.12 [95% CI = 0.82 to 1.56; P = 0.48]) and the cost differ-
ence  in  those  who  did  incur  costs  were  not  significantly 
different between parents of children with HA and control 
parents (Supplementary Table 4).

Discussion

In  this  retrospective,  cross-sectional  study  using  claims 
data, we compared 1-year mean health care costs and uti-
lization  of  nonmental  and  mental  health  services  between 
parents  of  children  with  and  without  HA.  As  previously 
mentioned, we hypothesized lower costs and utilization of 
nonmental health services and higher costs and utilization 
for mental health services for parents of children with HA. 
However,  moderately,  but  nonsignificantly,  higher  health 

care costs and utilization of both service types for parents 
of children with HA were observed. Moreover, when parents 
with HA themselves were excluded, significant differences 
were detected in mental health–related outcomes. The like-
lihood  of  incurring  mental  health  costs  was  significantly 
higher  in  parents  of  children  with  HA  in  the  sensitivity 
analysis  as  well.  This  suggests  mental  health  utilization  in 
parents may be attributable to a pediatric HA diagnosis in 
the  family.  However,  this  warrants  further  confirmatory 
analysis. In addition, parents of children with HA lost fewer 
work  hours  because  of  absenteeism  than  control  parents, 
but this difference was not statistically significant. In addi-
tion,  work  hours  lost  may  be  due  to  recreational  reasons 
(eg,  vacation  time)  or  reasons  separate  from  caregiving  in 
MarketScan.

The  lack  of  significant  differences  in  the  primary 
analysis may have been due to insufficient sample size and 
emphasizes the challenges of evaluating the effects of rare 
diseases  on  families  using  claims  data.  The  primary  out-
comes for 1,068 parent pairs had a power of 6% and 43% for 
mental and nonmental mean health care costs, respectively. 
However, when parents with a history of HA were excluded 
in the subgroup analysis, mental health cost and likelihood 
of  having  a  mental  health  claim  were  slightly  higher  and 
statistically  significant  for  parents  of  children  with  HA,  as 
compared with parents with children without HA. A hemo-
philia diagnosis is challenging for families; parents need to 
accept the child’s illness, as well as learn how to manage the 
disease and adjust family life.29-31 The result of the subgroup 
analysis  suggests  that  parents  with  HA  themselves  may 
have different ways of coping and managing a child with HA 
compared with parents who do not have HA. Determining 
causality  was  not  an  objective  of  this  study,  however, 
and  may  be  an  area  for  future  research.  Consideration  of 
other study designs (eg, different outcomes, using a larger 
dataset,  or  prospective  data  collection)  in  this  space  may 
be  warranted.  Assessing  impact  on  caregivers  for  patients 
with severe HA or expanding caregivers to spouses of adult 
patients with HA may yield more meaningful results.

To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  no  other  analyses  have 
assessed health care and productivity impacts of a pediatric 
HA  diagnosis  on  parents.  As  such,  there  is  a  paucity  of 
evidence on cost differences between caregivers and their 
controls.  However,  in  one  study  for  spouse  caregivers  of 
patients  with  Alzheimer  disease  (AD),  AD  spouses  had  a 
significantly  greater  cost  difference  between  pre-  and 
post-AD  diagnosis  than  control  spouses  for  AD/mental 
health drugs but not for total costs.32 Additional analyses of 
family/caregiver  impacts  have  been  conducted  in  cancer, 
pediatric  Crohn  disease  (CD),  and  pediatric  intensive  care 
unit  (ICU)  hospitalizations.  Lower  health  care  use  and

same  family.  Thus,  we  stratified  the 
primary  outcomes  by  parent  policy-
holder type.

Conclusions 

Parents  with  children  with  HA  were 
found  to  have  moderately,  but  non-
significantly,  higher  mean  costs 
and  utilization  of  both  nonmental 
and  mental  health  services.  Future 
research  exploring  other  approaches 
to  measure  health  care  use  and  pro-
in  parent  caregivers  of 
ductivity 
children with HA is warranted.

more health diagnoses were observed 
in  spouses  of  patients  with  cancer.33 
Higher productivity loss was observed 
for  parents  of  pediatric  patients  with 
CD.23  Fewer  mental  health  diagno-
ses  and  use  of  mental  health  care 
were  observed  for  parents  whose 
children  were  hospitalized  in  the 
ICU.34  However,  comparison  between 
results and those of other analyses is 
difficult,  as  different  health  care  uti-
lization  mechanisms  may  be  involved 
for spouse caregivers, across different 
patient  age  groups  and  conditions, 
and  across  acute  vs  chronic  disease 
management. For example, caregiving 
for a spouse with cancer may be more 
expensive,  and  caregiving  for  a  child 
hospitalized  in  the  ICU  is  less  of  a 
long-term  commitment.  Results  are 
not generalizable across disease states 
and  patient  populations;  thus,  future 
research  to  expand  the  literature  for 
caregiver burden in HA is warranted.
Limitations  of  claims  data  encour-
ages consideration of other measures 
that  can  help  quantify  the  health 
burden  experienced  by  parents  who 
provide  care  in  severe  pediatric  dis-
eases.  Further  validation  of  caregiver 
impact measurement tools, especially 
on caregivers’ health and in the hemo-
philia space (eg, Hemophilia Caregiver 
Impact),  needs  to  be  prioritized.35 
These  health-related  quality-of-life 
measurements  can  be  mapped  to 
preference-based utility measures for 
inclusion in economic evaluations.

LIMITATIONS
Several  limitations  must  be  consid-
ered  when  interpreting  the  results  of 
this  study.  First,  the  severity  of  HA 
for  diagnosed  children  whose  par-
ents were included in the analysis was 
unable  to  be  ascertained.  Inclusion 
criteria  of  at  least  1  HA-related  claim 
and either an HA-related drug or pro-
cedure for children with HA captured 
patients  interacting  more  with  the 

health  care  system  and  may  require 
more care. Future research is needed 
to  better  characterize  HA  disease 
severity in claims data, as well as assess 
impact on parents caring for very sick 
children with HA (eg, frequent bleeds 
or 
infusions).  Second,  employment 
information  regarding  parents  who 
were  secondary  policyholders  was 
unknown.  Thus,  secondary  benefi-
ciaries were unable to be matched on 
employment  status  and  rather  only 
primary  beneficiaries  were  matched 
on  employment  status.  Third,  the 
study  design  was  cross-sectional  and 
identified  prevalent  and  not  incident 
HA  cases.  Parents’  involvement  at  a 
specific point along a patient’s disease 
course  was  unable  to  be  ascertained. 
Consequently,  this  analysis  did  not 
control  for  time  since  HA  diagnosis, 
and thus we were unable to explicitly 
understand  how  duration  of  caregiv-
ing  impacted  caregivers’  health  care 
expenditures.  However,  the  age  of 
the child was controlled for in match-
ing.  This  can  approximate  time  since 
diagnosis  because  HA  is  a  genetic 
condition  and  most  children  with  HA 
are  diagnosed  within  the  first  cou-
ple  years  of  life.5  Fourth,  unobserved 
confounders,  such  as  family  income, 
race and ethnicity, and use of profes-
sional  caregiving,  were  not  adjusted 
for because these data were not avail-
able in MarketScan. These factors may 
impact parents’ willingness to seek out 
health services. However, employment 
status,  which  is  available  information 
and potentially indicative of a family’s 
socioeconomic  status,  was  included 
as a variable in matching. Lastly, both 
parents  from  the  same  family  were 
included for 70% of parents of children 
with  HA  and  1%  of  parents  of  chil-
dren  without  HA.  Both  parents  were 
included  to  increase  overall  sample 
size and because both may be involved 
in  caregiving.  However,  costs  may  be 
correlated  between  parents  from  the
