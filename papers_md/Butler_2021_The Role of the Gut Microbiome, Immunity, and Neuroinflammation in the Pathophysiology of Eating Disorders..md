Abstract: There is a growing recognition that both the gut microbiome and the immune system are
involved in a number of psychiatric illnesses, including eating disorders. This should come as no
surprise, given the important roles of diet composition, eating patterns, and daily caloric intake
in modulating both biological systems. Here, we review the evidence that alterations in the gut
microbiome and immune system may serve not only to maintain and exacerbate dysregulated eating
behavior, characterized by caloric restriction in anorexia nervosa and binge eating in bulimia nervosa
and binge eating disorder, but may also serve as biomarkers of increased risk for developing an
eating disorder. We focus on studies examining gut dysbiosis, peripheral inﬂammation, and neuroin-
ﬂammation in each of these eating disorders, and explore the available data from preclinical rodent
models of anorexia and binge-like eating that may be useful in providing a better understanding of
the biological mechanisms underlying eating disorders. Such knowledge is critical to developing
novel, highly effective treatments for these often intractable and unremitting eating disorders.

1. Introduction

Eating disorders are serious psychiatric conditions driven, in part, by non-homeostatic
eating, including chronic underconsumption of calories in anorexia nervosa (AN) and
intermittent binge eating in bulimic syndromes including binge eating disorder (BED)
and bulimia nervosa (BN). While AN is often deﬁned by chronic caloric restriction, other
core features include increased physical activity, an intense fear of weight gain, endocrine
alterations, disturbance of body image, and low body weight [1]. This eating disorder dis-
proportionately affects females with a 12-month prevalence of 0.4–1% among adolescents
and young adults [1]. In addition to environmental factors, such as the cultural pressure
for thinness in women, it is clear that genetic and hormonal factors also play an important
role in the development and maintenance of AN [2–4]. Consistent with its complex and
poorly understood etiology, the course of AN is highly variable, relapse is common, and
the mortality rate is the highest among psychiatric illnesses [5,6]. This highlights a pressing
need for research designed to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying AN
and to identify biological risk factors.

At the other end of the spectrum, bulimic syndromes are characterized by binge
eating, which involves the recurrent consumption of objectively large amounts of food
in a discrete period of time that is accompanied by a loss of control over eating [7]. In-
termittent binge eating is a core feature of multiple bulimic syndromes, including BED,
BN, and the binge–purge subtype of AN. As such, a greater understanding of the biolog-
ical mechanisms underlying binge eating in particular could advance the identiﬁcation,
prevention, and treatment of a range of eating disorders. While bulimic syndromes share

the core feature of binge eating, BED is unique in that recurrent episodes of binge eating
are not accompanied by purging behavior [7], and bingeing in the absence of purging
promotes weight gain resulting in an overweight or obese phenotype in individuals di-
agnosed with BED. In comparison, binge eating in individuals diagnosed with BN or
binge–purge AN are accompanied by compensatory behaviors, including self-induced
vomiting, excessive exercise, laxative and diuretic abuse, and prolonged fasting [8]. Collec-
tively, these compensatory behaviors often mitigate the excess calories consumed during a
binge and thus serve to constrain weight gain. Of course, these compensatory behaviors
can lead to other complications, including sialadenosis, acid-base and electrolyte changes,
hypokalemia, and disturbances in upper gastrointestinal function [9,10]. In studying the
biological mechanisms underlying binge eating, it is important to recognize that this form
of dysregulated eating behavior occurs along a body mass index (BMI) continuum ranging
from underweight to obese.

Similar to AN, highly effective treatments for bulimic syndromes, including BN and
BED, are lacking [11], and efforts to develop effective treatments are hampered by our
limited understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying these eating disorders. The
last few years have, however, led to a growing recognition that both the gut microbiome
and the immune system are involved in a number of psychiatric illnesses, including eating
disorders [11,12]. Moreover, the important roles that diet composition and caloric intake
play in terms of regulating microbiome and immune function has spurred further interest in
studying these biological systems in the context of dysregulated eating behavior. Here, we
review the evidence that alterations in the microbiome and immune function can promote
and maintain eating disorders characterized by caloric restriction in AN and intermittent
binge eating in bulimic syndromes including BN and BED.

2. Eating Disorders and the Gut Microbiome

The gut microbiome has become an emerging focus in a number of health disciplines,
including the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders [13]. This should come as
no surprise given that the human body contains at least as many prokaryotic bacterial cells
as total eukaryotic cells [14,15]. Moreover, the human microbiome contains 150 times more
bacterial genes, derived from thousands of gut microbial species, than what exists in the
human genome [14]. The collective genomes of all the microbes lining the full length of the
gastrointestinal tract comprise the “gut microbiome”.

A common metric of gut health is the diversity of microbial species that inhabit it.
Alpha diversity is represented by the variation of microbes within a sample, and is a good
indicator of species richness, which is determined by the number of different species of
microbes present in a given fecal/cecal sample [16]. In general, a more diverse population
of gut microbes is associated with better health outcomes. Conversely, low alpha diversity,
together with an increased Firmicutes: Bacteriodetes ratio, is associated with increased
gut permeability or a “leaky gut”, which has been causally linked to gastrointestinal
problems, inﬂammation, and various disease states [13]. This symbiotic relationship
between gut microbes and their host affects everything from host metabolism and body
weight regulation to endocrine, immune, and nervous system function [13].

Since the ecosystem of gut microbes is constantly interacting with ingested nutrients
and the eukaryotic cells that comprise the intestinal tissue and line the gut wall [13], both
short- and long-term dietary changes can affect the composition and abundance of gut
microbiota [17]. Recognition of the important reciprocal interplay between diet and gut
microbes, together with the well-deﬁned role of the microbiome in regulating metabolic
function and body weight [17], has spurred recent interest in studying the microbiome in
patients with eating disorders.

Several systematic reviews of the obesity and microbiome literature highlight substan-
tial differences in gut microbial composition between lean and obese individuals [17,18].
As mentioned above, diversity of gut microbes is a key indicator of gut health. As such,
several studies have reported a reduction in microbial alpha diversity in obese individuals

Nutrients 2021, 13, 500

compared to lean individuals. Speciﬁcally, a reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria has
been associated with obesity in humans [19]. Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid and a
bacterial byproduct that is a consequence of ﬁber-metabolizing bacteria in the colon [20].
Butyrate and other short chain fatty acids are important anti-inﬂammatory mediators in
both the gut and the brain, and their deﬁciency is associated with several chronic diseases,
including metabolic disorders, obesity, and type 2 diabetes [20].

Studies involving manipulation of the microbiome further highlight its important role
in regulating body weight. For example, the use of prebiotics and probiotics can reduce
body weight and fat mass in obese individuals [21], and fecal microbiome transplants
from healthy donors has been shown to improve glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity,
and liver function in overweight individuals [22,23]. It has also been shown that fecal
microbiome transplants from obese individuals promotes weight gain in germ-free, lean
rodents despite no change in caloric intake [24,25]. Taken together, these studies provide
compelling evidence that the gut microbiome plays a critical role in regulating body weight
and thus offers an important therapeutic target for slowing or reversing weight gain in
obese individuals.

2.1. The Microbiome and Anorexia Nervosa

While much is known about the role of the microbiome in the development and
maintenance of obesity, far fewer studies have been conducted in individuals with eating
disorders and, to the best of our knowledge, this emerging literature is restricted to AN. In
the ﬁrst comprehensive investigation, Kleiman et al. [16] characterized the fecal microbiome
of a small group of AN patients upon admission (n = 16) and again at discharge (n = 10)
from an inpatient treatment facility. At admission, acutely ill AN patients had signiﬁcantly
reduced alpha diversity, relative to healthy controls. Interestingly, alpha diversity was
associated with eating disorder psychopathology, with reduced bacterial species associated
with greater depression and concern about weight and shape [16]. While the health of the
fecal microbiome improved in weight-restored AN patients, alpha diversity continued to
be signiﬁcantly reduced in the AN group at discharge, and signiﬁcant difference in beta
diversity (a measure of how samples of the microbiome vary against each other) were
also observed in AN patients between admission and discharge [16]. This is particularly
interesting as it suggests that alterations in the gut microbiome may be trait related and
thus may play a causal role in AN, rather than simply being a consequence of malnutrition
or low body weight.

Most, but not all, studies investigating the fecal microbiome in AN have reported
some level of gut dysbiosis, deﬁned by bacterial colonies in the gastrointestinal tract that
are disrupted in a way that is detrimental to the host [26–30]. While some studies replicated
the ﬁrst report of decreased alpha diversity in acutely ill AN patients [31,32], others have
not [27,28,33]. In light of the strong association between alpha diversity and overall gut
health, these equivocal ﬁndings highlight the need for additional investigations of alpha
diversity in the gut microbiome of individuals diagnosed with, and recovered from, AN.
Further research is also needed to assess the speciﬁc changes in microbial composition in
AN, including changes in beta diversity and microbial metabolites that may perpetuate
AN symptoms.

2.2. The Microbiome in Animal Models of Anorexia Nervosa

Preclinical rodent models of AN have been valuable in terms of studying the biological
mechanisms underlying this eating disorder [34–36] and should be particularly useful in
elucidating how gut dysbiosis may serve as a biomarker for the development or main-
tenance of AN. Activity-based anorexia (ABA), one of the more common rodent models
of AN, combines food restriction (e.g., limiting food access to 1–2 h per day or providing
40% of baseline food intake) with the opportunity to exercise in a running wheel [37,38].
Under these conditions, rodents eat less than sedentary controls given the same restricted
access to food and engage in high levels of running wheel activity, resulting in rapid weight

Nutrients 2021, 13, 500

loss. In addition to the caloric restriction and hyperactivity, ABA-exposed rodents develop
other symptoms of AN, including low adiposity, hypothermia, and neuroendocrine disrup-
tions [37]. Given the complex social and psychiatric components of AN, it is clear that the
ABA paradigm can only model a subset of AN symptoms, but it is widely recognized as
the best preclinical model of this complex eating disorder [34,39].

A small but growing number of studies have examined the impact of ABA on the gut
microbiome. A proteomic analysis of fecal samples collected from male mice exposed to
the ABA paradigm revealed increases in multiple Clostridium species belonging to the order
Clostridiales, and an increase in phosphoglycerate kinase, a glycolytic ATP-producing
enzyme, relative to freely-fed and food restricted/sedentary control mice [40]. Despite
these adaptive changes to the negative energy balance seen in ABA mice, in vitro assays
revealed no reliable differences in the ATP-producing capacity of bacterial protein from
ABA mice, relative to control mice [40]. A gene sequencing and quantitative PCR analysis
of cecal samples collected from male mice with ABA revealed increases in the abundance
of Clostridium and Lactobacillus species and a decrease in the abundance of Burkholderiales
species, relative to freely-fed mice [41]. This group also showed that most of these changes
in the gut microbiome could be attributed to food restriction/starvation as opposed to the
increased activity levels observed in ABA mice [41]. Gut dysbiosis has also been reported in
male rats with ABA, but changes in their fecal microbiome included decreased abundance
of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Lactobacillus, and an increase in M. smithii, in comparison
to freely-fed rats [42]. These differing proﬁles of gut microbiota alterations in mice and
rats may reﬂect a species difference and/or methodological differences related to sample
collection, duration of food access, and length of the ABA paradigm [41]. In one of the few
studies to examine the impact of ABA on the microbiome of female rodents, Trinh et al. [43]
reported differences in beta diversity between rats with and without ABA, and an increase
in alpha diversity in ABA rats that was negatively correlated with global brain weight.
While an increase in alpha diversity typically signals better health, the authors speculated
that this increase in alpha diversity in ABA rats may be an adaption to starvation [43], but
this requires further testing.

While there is compelling evidence of gut dysbiosis in individuals diagnosed with
AN, rodents with ABA, and rodents subjected to chronic food restriction [44], much less
is known about the functional consequence or molecular underpinnings of the altered
microbiome. In a recent study by Dominique et al. [45], male mice with ABA were reported
to have elevated levels of a gut microbial protein that may mimic the effects of alpha-
melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), an anorexigenic neuropeptide that plays a
critical role in regulating appetite. Additional studies are needed to assess whether this
particular gut microbe, caseinolytic peptidase B, is also elevated in AN and whether it may
act to promote or maintain calorie restriction. In another recent study, the fecal microbiome
of four individuals with AN and four healthy controls was transferred to germ-free mice,
and alterations in weight gain and behavior were measured [46]. Mice receiving microbes
from AN patients displayed a reduction in food intake and impaired weight gain relative
to mice receiving microbes from healthy controls [46]. The mice receiving fecal microbiome
transplants from individuals with AN also displayed increased anxiety- and compulsive-
like behavior relative to controls [46]. This suggests that gut dysbiosis is a critical mediator
of AN pathology and thus could be targeted directly to improve AN symptoms.

In support of this view, fecal microbiome transplantation has been used in AN patients
with promising results. In one case study, an AN patient with signiﬁcant impairments
in the gut barrier function and low alpha diversity showed improvements in both mea-
sures following the fecal microbiome transplant from a healthy, ﬁrst-degree relative [47].
Short chain fatty acids were also increased following fecal microbiome transplant, as was
serotonin [47]. In another study, a patient with AN showed signiﬁcant improvement in
weight gain following fecal microbiome transplant from a non-related healthy female
donor [48]. This increase in weight gain was driven mostly by a 55% increase in body
fat despite a reported stable caloric intake [48]. The ability of fecal microbiome trans-

Nutrients 2021, 13, 500

5 of 19

plants to increase body weight/adiposity without a concomitant increase in food intake
has signiﬁcant treatment implications for those suffering from severe AN, as refeeding is
often difﬁcult in these populations. Given that these are case reports and no large-scale,
randomized controlled trials haven been used to assess the impact of fecal microbiome
transplant in AN, these ﬁndings should be interpreted with some caution. Nevertheless,
they provide a proof-of-concept that treating gut dysbiosis in AN may be a promising
therapeutic approach.

Decreased alpha diversity and other markers of an unhealthy microbiome have been
shown to increase gut permeability, which can promote gastrointestinal problems and
inﬂammation [13]. Consistent with these ﬁndings, histological analysis of the gut in under-
weight male mice with ABA revealed increased permeability of the colon, decreased gastric
wall thickness, and decreased expression of tight junction proteins [49]. While similar
direct measures of gut permeability cannot be conducted in humans, indirect assessments
involving non-invasive methodologies are possible but have yielded equivocal ﬁndings. In
one study, a reduction in gut permeability was reported in AN patients following assess-
ment of mannitol and lactulose absorption from the small intestine [50]. However, a more
recent pilot study by Mörkl at al. [32] reported no changes in gut permeability between
AN patients and healthy controls following assessment of plasma zonulin, a protein that
modulates the permeability of tight junctions between intestinal cells. While neither of
these studies provide evidence of increased gut permeability in AN, similar to that reported
in the preclinical ABA model [49,51], conclusions are limited by the small number of AN
patients examined to date.

In addition to altering colon permeability, the gut microbiome has been shown to
impact gut mucosal barrier function [13]. This raises the possibility that, in AN, the integrity
of the gut mucosal layer could be compromised by an increase in certain bacteria that
preferably digest proteins, including those of the intestinal mucus, leading to increased
colonic permeability in AN. In support of this notion, human studies have shown an
increase in the number of mucin-degrading bacteria in the gut of individuals diagnosed
with AN [16].

3. Anorexia Nervosa and Peripheral Inﬂammation

The immune system is comprised of two branches, the innate and the adaptive
immune system, which play a coordinated role in detecting and neutralizing invading
bloodborne and cellular pathogens [52]. The innate immune system is usually the ﬁrst
to respond to an invading pathogen and rapidly produces a generalized, non-speciﬁc
inﬂammatory response mediated by neutrophils and eosinophils, followed by macrophages.
The B and T lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system respond more slowly but
the response is speciﬁc to the pathogen and can be recalled upon re-exposure to the
pathogen [52].

As reviewed above, alterations in the gut microbiome in AN may increase gut perme-
ability via decreased intestinal mucins, thinning of the intestinal walls, and altered tight
junctions, all of which can facilitate the diffusion of bacterial byproducts and, often times,
whole bacteria across the intestinal wall barrier and into the bloodstream [13]. This rise in
bacteria and/or bacterial byproducts could activate immune cells and trigger peripheral
inﬂammation. This type of immune response elicited by gut dysbiosis is likely initiated
via activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) [53]. TLRs are cell surface receptors that can
directly bind bacterial pathogens and byproducts and are expressed on the membranes
of multiple immune cell subtypes, including macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic
cells of the innate immune system. The binding of TLRs, such as TLR4, by bacteria and
their metabolites activates the innate immune system, triggering canonical inﬂammatory
signaling pathways and transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), that
increase the transcription of proinﬂammatory cytokines.

Initial studies involving clinical populations of individuals diagnosed with AN pro-
vide evidence of peripheral immune system impairment. For example, a small study
involving 10 AN patients reported signiﬁcantly decreased neutrophil chemotaxis in com-
parison to a larger group of healthy controls [54]. Another study showed a reduction in
the ability of granulocytes, isolated from a small AN sample, to kill two different bacterial
species [55]. This same study also reported evidence of decreased neutrophil phagocytosis,
which is consistent with decreased chemotaxis [55]. In addition to these early studies, two
recent meta-analyses of cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical studies support the notion
that AN is associated with chronic, low-grade inﬂammation. This inﬂammatory phenotype
is most consistently characterized by increased serum/plasma levels of proinﬂammatory
cytokines such as interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-α) [56,57]. For example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), isolated
from patients with AN, were shown to have increased spontaneous production of TNF-α
in comparison to similarly isolated PBMCs from healthy controls [58]. This increased
production of TNF-α was normalized upon refeeding [58]. This ﬁnding was replicated in

Nutrients 2021, 13, 500

7 of 19

another study showing an increase in spontaneous proinﬂammatory cytokine release from
PBMCs isolated from AN patients that normalized upon weight gain [59]. The refeeding
reversal of immune activity reported in these studies suggests that nutritional/starvation
status plays a direct role in the peripheral immune response in AN.

Circulating levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines have also been studied in AN patients.
An exploratory cross-sectional study that examined serum concentrations of multiple
markers of inﬂammation in acutely ill AN patients revealed an increase in IL-6, IL-15, and
vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, relative to healthy controls [60]. More recently,
a longitudinal study reported an increase in plasma IL-6 in acutely ill AN patients that
normalized, along with AN symptoms, after 12 weeks of treatment [61]. Taken together,
these ﬁndings suggest that elevated proinﬂammatory cytokines, and IL-6 in particular, may
serve as state markers for AN. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis revealed that selective
inhibition of the IL-6 signaling pathway is associated with an increase in weight gain [62].
This suggests that the IL-6 signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of body weight
and could thus be targeted by available pharmacological IL-6 inhibitors to facilitate weight
gain in AN patients.

Adaptive immunity also appears to be impaired in AN. T cell subtypes are dysregu-
lated in AN patients when compared to healthy controls and to individuals with primary
malnutrition [63–66]. The CD4/CD8 T cell ratio is increased in AN patients and this is
likely due to a greater reduction in CD8 counts compared to CD4 counts. Multiple studies
have suggested this reduced CD8 cell count is driven by a reduction in memory CD8
cells as opposed to naïve CD8 cells [65,66]. Indeed, these studies suggest that with the
signiﬁcant decrease in body weight, lymphocyte production, speciﬁcally T helper cells
(CD4 cells), is favored over other lymphocytes in an effort to preserve the efﬁcacy of the
adaptive immune system [52].

Fewer studies have looked at B cell function in AN patients and the available data
are equivocal. One study found normal serum levels of immunoglobin A (IgA), IgM,
and IgG antibodies (produced by B cells) in 16 AN patients [52], while a smaller study
involving only ﬁve AN patients found lower levels of IgM and IgG antibodies in AN
patients compared to healthy controls [67]. Interestingly, detectable differences in B cell
function may only be present in the most severe cases of AN (BMI less than 17.5) as IgG
was reduced in these patients compared to healthy controls [59]. Moreover, in a larger
study of AN patients (n = 46), B cell count was negatively correlated with BMI, and T and
B cell interactions were also dysregulated [65]. Overall, while large-scale studies in this
area are lacking, it is clear that AN is associated with multiple abnormalities of the immune
system in addition to increased systemic inﬂammation and inﬂammation of peripheral
tissues.

Consistent with impairments in innate and adaptive immunity in AN patients, there
is some evidence that these changes in immune system function may exacerbate the
complications of infectious disease although, aside from a few studies and case reports,
data in this area are lacking. In one study, an attenuated fever response and delayed
immune reaction was associated with increased complications from bacterial infections in
AN patients compared to healthy controls [68]. Conversely, an examination of case studies
revealed that AN patients report fewer symptomatic viral infections than controls, and the
viral infection risk appears to increase as AN patients gain weight during recovery [69]. It
is unclear what immunological mechanisms may protect AN patients from viral infection.
One possibility is that AN patients may present with fewer viral symptoms but actually
have higher viral titers than healthy controls, as is the case with multiple sclerosis, but
studies testing this hypothesis in AN are lacking [69].

Data from rodent models of AN, speciﬁcally the ABA model described above, may
shed some light on the underlying mechanisms of impaired peripheral immune function
in AN. Increased levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines have been observed in ABA. For
example, ABA mice displayed early onset intestinal inﬂammation marked by increased
levels of TLR4 mRNA in the colon and an increase in the cell surface expression of TLR4 on

Nutrients 2021, 13, 500

8 of 19

colonic macrophages and epithelial cells [70]. ABA was also associated with elevated levels
of mucosal proinﬂammatory cytokine production, speciﬁcally TNF-α and IL-6 [70]. It is
important to note that these same inﬂammatory changes were observed in a limited food
access control group as well, suggesting chronic malnutrition/starvation alone is sufﬁcient
to alter immune function in the mouse gut. In the same study, TLR4 knockout mice had
higher rates of mortality due to ABA than wildtype controls, suggesting that while TLR4
may be integral to the proinﬂammatory response observed in ABA, it also appears to be
playing a protective role. However, the underlying mechanisms of TLR4(cid:48)s protective effects
in the context of ABA are unknown and require further investigation [70].

4. Anorexia Nervosa and Neuroinﬂammation

It is now widely accepted that peripheral inﬂammatory events can directly cause
inﬂammation in the central nervous system. Circulating proinﬂammatory cytokines have
been shown to cross the blood brain barrier and stimulate the release of proinﬂammatory
cytokines from microglia, which express TLRs and serve as the resident immune cells of
the brain [71]. Microglia are myeloid cells derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the
yolk sac and enter the nervous tissue early during embryonic development [72]. Central
changes in immune signaling can have signiﬁcant impacts on a variety of brain functions,
including feeding behavior and mood regulation [71,73], both of which are dysregulated
in AN. While the role of neuroinﬂammation in AN patients is unknown, evidence from a
number of preclinical rodent models suggest that central inﬂammation, and speciﬁcally
microglia, play an important role in the pathophysiology of AN.

Brain concentrations of proinﬂammatory eicosanoids derived from the omega-6
polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) arachidonic acid were increased in rats at the induc-
tion of, and recovery from, the ABA phenotype, relative to exercise and food-restricted
controls [74]. Eicosanoids are bioactive metabolites of PUFAs that serve a variety of physio-
logical and pathological functions in the nervous system, including regulating immune
function [75]. While inﬂammation (i.e., cytokine expression) was not directly assessed in
this study, the authors did show signiﬁcant increases in proinﬂammatory arachidonic acid
metabolites including 5(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5(S)-HETE), 8(S)-HETE, 12(S)-
HETE, 15(S)-HETE, and several prostaglandins in a brain-region speciﬁc manner [74].
These metabolites serve as natural ligands to receptors expressed on the surface of mi-
croglia and can directly modulate microglial activity [75]. It is likely that this ABA-induced
alteration of PUFA metabolism does, indeed, alter microglial activity and increase neu-
roinﬂammation, but this hypothesis remains to be tested in future studies. Furthermore,
it would be interesting to investigate whether or not ABA also alters omega–3 PUFA
metabolism, which competes for the same metabolic enzymes as arachidonic acid but
produces anti-inﬂammatory eicosanoids [75].

Microglia have been directly implicated in other rodent models of AN. In a dehydration-
induced anorexia (DIA) model, which recapitulates weight loss and food avoidance despite
its availability, microglial density and morphological indicators of activation were increased
in the prefrontal cortex, relative to controls [76]. This cellular response was accompanied
by an increase in proinﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, conﬁrming a
proinﬂammatory environment in the prefrontal cortex in DIA animals [76]. Interestingly, in
this same study, the authors included a forced food restriction control group without the de-
hydration component, and saw similar results in regards to microglial density, morphology,
and proinﬂammatory markers [76]. These data suggest that severe caloric restriction and
nutrient deprivation alone can lead to neuroimmune alterations in the prefrontal cortex. In
another study conducted by this same group, DIA led to similar results in the hippocampus
as it did in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting that multiple brain regions are affected. Given
the profound eating pathology in AN, it will be important to examine microglial expression
in additional brain areas that process feeding and reward in this and other animal models
of AN. While the role of microglia and other proinﬂammatory factors are unknown in AN
patients, rodent models of AN have shown that neuroinﬂammation can lead to neuronal

Nutrients 2021, 13, 500

loss [76]. Importantly, a decrease in hippocampal volume and structural alterations in the
prefrontal cortex have also been reported in patients diagnosed with AN [77–81]. These
rodent models suggest that this decrease in hippocampal volume in AN may be due to
sustained neuroinﬂammation.

Microglia and neuroinﬂammation have also been implicated in the anx/anx mouse
model of AN. This model arose over 40 years ago from a spontaneous mutation, though
the exact mapping of the mutation is still unknown [82]. These anx/anx mice display
the core features of AN-starvation and emaciation in the presence of food accompanied
by premature death. They appear normal at birth and are indistinguishable from their
wild-type littermates but, despite full access to their mother’s milk, eat signiﬁcantly less
than wild-type mice and die at 3–5 weeks of age [82]. The brains of these anx/anx mice
show signiﬁcant alterations in feeding-related neuropeptides in the arcuate nucleus of
the hypothalamus (ARC), including agouti gene-related protein (AgRP), neuropeptide Y
(NPY), and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) [82,83]. These alterations are accompanied by
increased microglial density and activation in the hypothalamus, and neurodegeneration
of hypothalamic neurons that control appetite [84]. While hypothalamic microglia do
mediate the neuronal response to satiety signals [73], it is unclear if they directly mediate
the alterations of ARC neuropeptides in anx/anx mice. Given that there is limited research
investigating microglial function in AN rodent models, such as ABA, future studies should
investigate the causal relationship between microglia and neuronal function in the hypotha-
lamus. Hypothalamic function also appears to be altered in AN patients, as several recent
studies have shown individuals with AN have hypothalamic structural alterations [81],
decreased hypothalamic connectivity to the striatum [85], and impaired hypothalamic
glucose reactivity compared to healthy-weight controls [78].

Taken together, the rodent literature indicates signiﬁcant neuroinﬂammation across
multiple brain regions that control food intake and regulate bodyweight and mood, all of
which are disrupted in AN. However, with limited availability of postmortem brains from
AN patients it makes it difﬁcult to illuminate the role of microglia and neuroinﬂammation
in the pathology of AN. Given what we know from multiple animal models, coupled
with our current understanding of nervous and immune system interactions, it is likely
that neuroinﬂammation is playing a role in AN pathology. Future studies could focus on
utilizing imaging methods of gliosis [86] or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
of microglia-speciﬁc markers [87] in AN clinical populations to better understand the role
of neuroinﬂammation in the development and maintenance of this eating disorder.

5. Bulimic Syndromes and Inﬂammation

A shared feature of bulimic syndromes is binge eating, a form of dysregulated eat-
ing behavior involving intermittent overconsumption of palatable foods that are high in
saturated fats and reﬁned sugar [88]. It is well-documented that chronic consumption
of a high fat diet is associated with peripheral and central inﬂammation, both of which
contribute to weight gain and obesity-related comorbidities including metabolic syndrome,
insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. While there is a robust literature examining immune
function in individuals diagnosed with AN, much less is known about the immune sys-
tem’s response to intermittent overconsumption of calories in individuals diagnosed with
bulimic syndromes, including BN and BED, or whether dysregulated immune function
may serve as a risk factor for either of these eating disorders.

Proinﬂammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, can act directly on the
neuronal circuits that control food intake in the hypothalamus [89]. In comparison to the
AN literature, far fewer studies have examined whether bulimic syndromes are associated
with elevated levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines. The ﬁrst exploratory study to examine
plasma cytokines in a small sample of 20 BN patients reported elevated levels of TNF-α
in comparison to healthy controls [90]. Similar results were reported in another study in
which plasma levels of IL-1β and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS; a marker
of systemic oxidative stress) were found to be elevated in a mixed sample of eating disorder
patients (60% were diagnosed with BN or BED), relative to healthy controls [91].

In contrast to these studies, a recent meta-analysis, which excluded the aforementioned
studies due to small sample size and the heterogeneous eating disorder group, examined
the ﬁndings of four studies that measured circulating proinﬂammatory cytokine concentra-
tions in BN patients. Their analysis revealed no difference in IL-6 or TNF-α in individuals
with BN compared to healthy controls [56]. The same meta-analysis, which searched for
studies dating back to the early 1980s, failed to identify any studies examining proinﬂam-
matory cytokine concentrations in individuals diagnosed with BED. These ﬁndings should
be interpreted with some caution, however, as most of the studies in the meta-analysis
failed to account for confounding factors that could affect cytokine production, comorbid
diagnoses related to physical and psychiatric health, differences in treatment regimens,
and differences in the duration or severity of BN illness [56]. Since the publication of this
meta-analysis, a recent study reported increased serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α
in a large group of BN patients (n = 76), compared to healthy controls [92]. It should be
noted, however, that all of the BN participants in this study were obese (average BMI >40)
and undergoing evaluation for bariatric surgery. As such, the increase in proinﬂammatory
cytokines may be entirely related to the excess adiposity in this sample of BN patients.

In addition to assessing the concentration of proinﬂammatory cytokines circulating
in the blood, in vitro assays can be used to assess the production and release of proin-
ﬂammatory cytokines in PBMCs. To the best of our knowledge, only a single study has
examined cytokine production in a bulimic syndrome and they reported no difference in
either unstimulated or stimulated production of IFN-gamma, IL-1β, IL-6, or TNF-α from
PBMCs in individuals diagnosed with BN, in comparison to healthy controls [93].

While the available (but scant) literature suggests proinﬂammatory cytokines do not
appear to be systematically altered in BN in a way that is observed in AN, it has been shown
that plasma concentration of IL-10, an anti-inﬂammatory cytokine [94], is signiﬁcantly
lower in obese individuals diagnosed with BED, in comparison to healthy controls [95]. In
this same study, it was reported that plasma IL-10 concentration was also decreased in obese
individuals without BED or any other eating pathology [95], so this alteration in circulating
levels of IL-10 may be driven solely by the elevated adiposity in obese individuals with and
without a diagnosis of BED. To better understand the functional signiﬁcance of this ﬁnding,
it will be important for future studies involving BED patients to examine circulating levels
of proinﬂammatory cytokines in general, and TNF-α in particular, as IL-10 has been shown
to regulate expression of the TNF-α converting enzyme [96]. Since IL-10 is involved in
regulating both the innate and adaptive immune response [94,97], additional studies are
needed to further clarify the role of IL-10 and other anti-inﬂammatory cytokines in bulimic
syndromes.

Beyond measuring circulating levels of proinﬂammatory or anti-inﬂammatory cy-
tokines, other biomarkers of inﬂammation and associated compromised metabolic health
have been examined in the context of bulimic syndromes. For example, one study found
that loss of control eating in adolescents was associated with increased concentrations of
high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), relative to healthy controls [98]. This ﬁnding
was replicated and extended by another group, which found that obese individuals with
BED had a poorer inﬂammatory proﬁle, as measured by elevated levels of hs-CRP and
white blood cells, in comparison to obese individuals without a diagnosis of BED [99].
Another study reported lower levels of adiponectin, an adipokine that promotes metabolic
health, in BED-obese individuals in comparison to obese individuals without BED [100].
The ﬁndings of the latter two studies are particularly interesting as they suggest a speciﬁc
link between inﬂammation and intermittent binge eating that is not simply the result of
being overweight and thus may be driven by dysregulated eating behavior. While the
mechanism underlying such a relationship is unclear, it has been shown that intermittent
binge eating and the rapid rate of eating in BED has greater adverse metabolic conse-
quences than the chronic overeating of smaller but more frequent meals in non-BED obese
individuals, and this may serve to compromise immune function [101–103].

Interestingly, a primary deﬁcit in T-cell levels has also been reported in BN patients.
In one study involving patients with AN, BN, and healthy controls, the CD4/CD8 T-cell
ratio was found to be signiﬁcantly lower in the BN group, relative to the AN group, with
both eating disorder groups having lower CD4/CD8 ratios than healthy controls [104].
Since the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio is a marker of immune system function, with lower ratios
associated with greater risk of immunodeﬁciency and autoimmune disease, these ﬁndings
suggest greater inﬂammation in the BN group, relative to the AN group. However, both
eating disorder groups displayed similar results on a cutaneous hypersensitivity assay
suggesting that their cell-mediated immune response was similarly compromised [104]. In
a follow-up study of BN patients with normal BMI and no signs of malnutrition, a decrease
in multiple T-cell types (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD57) was found in the BN group,
relative to healthy controls [105]. Consistent with their earlier study [104], these ﬁndings
conﬁrm depleted immunocompetence in the BN group.

A small but growing literature has begun to document an association between
inﬂammatory-based disease and subsequent risk for developing a bulimic syndrome.
Most notably, a large, nation-wide study of children and adolescents born in Denmark over
a period of 17 years reported that childhood diagnosis of an autoimmune or autoinﬂam-
matory disease increased the risk of developing AN by 36% and BN by 73% within this
cohort [106]. They also reported that familial autoimmune disease predicts eating disorder
risk in offspring [106]. Importantly, this study replicates and extends an earlier report
by the same group linking inﬂammatory disease and eating disorder risk in a Finnish
population [107]. Additional support for the notion that inﬂammation may play a causal
role in the development of bulimic syndromes comes from the Avon Longitudinal Study

Nutrients 2021, 13, 500

12 of 19

of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), which followed 1502 children from birth to 18 years
of age and used medical records to identify factors that predicted the onset of eating dis-
orders. Compared to healthy children, girls and boys who later developed BN or BED
had signiﬁcantly greater body mass index (BMI) percentiles by the age of 6 years, and
increased adiposity and a poorer inﬂammatory proﬁle nearly 8 years before eating disorder
diagnosis [108].

While multiple studies have reported that autoimmune and inﬂammatory diseases
are associated with increased risk for developing BN and BED, the mechanism underlying
this relationship is unknown. Since proinﬂammatory cytokines produced by autoimmune
diseases can suppress appetite and promote weight loss [109], it is possible that the resulting
energy deﬁcit may serve as a trigger for dysregulated eating behavior in general and binge
eating in particular. Another possible mechanism arises for human imaging studies,
which have shown that disease-related neuroinﬂammation may alter activity in reward
and feeding pathways [80,110], and this could serve to mediate the association between
inﬂammatory disease and eating disorder risk. Additional studies are needed to better
understand how immune system disturbance may promote eating disorders in general, and
bulimic syndromes in particular. Such information is a crucial ﬁrst step toward identifying
novel biological targets for treating these conditions. In this regard, rodent-based models
of binge eating may be particularly valuable as they permit prospective investigations of
individual differences in immune function that may alter vulnerability to binge eat, and the
ability to directly manipulate and target the immune system in treatment-focused studies.

What Can Animal Studies Tell Us?

While several well-validated preclinical animal models of binge eating exist, few have
been used to examine the role of the immune system in the development or maintenance
of binge eating in bulimic syndromes. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one
study that used a frustration stress paradigm [111,112] to promote binge-like eating in
female rats. In this paradigm, binge eating of a familiar, palatable food is evoked in rats
by exposure to three, 8-day cycles of food restriction (food is restricted to 66% of baseline
levels on days 1–4 followed by ad libitum feeding on days 5–8) during which they are
given access to the palatable food for 2 h/day on days 5–6 and 13–14 of the ﬁrst two
cycles. During the third cycle, the palatable food is presented only on day 24 under the
same conditions as in previous cycles (control condition) or after a 15 min “frustration
stressor” in which rats can see and smell the palatable food but are prevented from eating
it (binge condition). On this ﬁnal test day, rats subjected to the frustration stressor engage
in binge-like eating of the palatable food, relative to control rats [112]. Using this paradigm,
Alboni et al. [113] examined changes in gene transcription of inﬂammatory markers in the
hypothalamus of female rats following binge-like or normal consumption of palatable food.
While multiple markers were examined, only three were differentially expressed, with
lower mRNA levels of IL-18 and its receptor (IL-18R) and higher levels of inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA detected in the hypothalamus of binge-eating versus control
rats [113]. It is possible that this decreased transcription of IL-18/IL-18R may have played
a permissive role in the binge-like eating observed in this study, as a lack of IL-18 signaling
promotes hyperphagia, weight gain, and related comorbidities in rodents [114,115]. The
increased mRNA expression of iNOS in the hypothalamus of binge-eating rats is also of
interest, as iNOS production and release is stimulated by proinﬂammatory cytokines [116]
and thus provides some indirect evidence that binge-like eating in rats is associated with
hypothalamic inﬂammation. Additionally nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to regulate the
expression of neuropeptides that control food intake [117] and clinical studies have shown
that NO production is increased in individuals with BN [118]. While these preliminary
ﬁndings are interesting, it will be important to determine whether similar changes are
observed in other animal models of binge-like eating in which animals engage in repeated
episodes of binge-like eating. It will also be important to look at more direct measures of

Nutrients 2021, 13, 500

neuroinﬂammation including changes in the number and activation state of microglia in
multiple brain areas.

BED, and animal models of binge-like eating is provided in Table 3.

6. Conclusions

While it is clear that interactions between the gut microbiome, immune system, and
nervous system are involved in the pathophysiology of eating disorders, researchers
are only beginning to scratch the surface to uncover the intricate mechanisms through
which these systems are intertwined. Our summary of the alterations in proinﬂammatory
cytokines, and other markers of peripheral and central inﬂammation, strongly suggests
that the immune system is dysregulated in both anorexic and bulimic syndromes. While
AN appears to be associated with an increase in proinﬂammatory cytokines, immune
dysfunction in bulimic syndromes such as BN and BED appear to involve decreased activity
of anti-inﬂammatory cytokines. Additional evidence from longitudinal clinical studies
highlights an interesting association between autoimmune and inﬂammatory diseases and
the risk of developing bulimic syndromes. In many studies, the alterations in immune
function do not appear to be simply related to malnutrition in AN and BN or excess
adiposity in BED. Although the pathogenesis of the alterations in immune function and
responsivity in AN, BN, and BED remain unclear, the use of preclinical animal models, like
those described here, offer a valuable tool for dissecting the underlying mechanisms. While
these kinds of studies are just starting to emerge, with investigations of the microbiome
severely lagging in animal models of binge-like eating, they should prove particularly
useful in identifying possible biomarkers for early detection and treatment interventions.
While a pattern of dysbiosis and altered inﬂammatory proﬁle in eating disorders is
emerging, concerns regarding publication bias, together with some reports of inconsistent
or contradictory ﬁndings that may stem from small sample sizes, warrants some caution
when drawing conclusions. Within the clinical literature, some of the variable ﬁndings may
be accounted for by methodological differences in assessing the microbiome and immune
function, a failure to consider confounding factors in the measurement of cytokines and the
bacterial composition of the gut, and, many times, small or heterogeneous clinical samples.
A primary consideration of the preclinical animal-based studies reviewed here is that most
of this research has been conducted in male rodents. This is both problematic, as ovarian

Nutrients 2021, 13, 500

14 of 19

hormones can have direct effects on the gut microbiome and the immune system, and
troubling, as women are disproportionately affected by eating disorders.

Future clinical studies should continue to explore the changes in the gut microbiome
and peripheral immunity in eating disorders as these data are lacking, especially in BN and
BED. It will also be critical to make use of available human brain imaging technologies, such
as PET imaging, to investigate the role of neuroinﬂammation in eating disorders. Future
clinical research would also beneﬁt from a greater focus on longitudinal designs, including
acutely ill and recovered individuals, to determine whether alterations in the microbiome
or immune system are state or trait markers of eating disorders. Since preclinical rodent
models are able to utilize more invasive techniques to quantify gut, immune, and neural
changes in response to dysregulated eating, these studies should focus on mechanisms of
gut and immune interactions with the brain, with a particular focus on microglial function.
Understanding these cellular and molecular mechanisms will be imperative if we are to
improve treatment outcomes in patients diagnosed with eating disorders.
