Abstract: Social fears arise when fearing to be judged in social events. When these fears are intense,
persistent, and debilitating, the individual may suffer from social anxiety disorder (SAD), which has
its most frequent onset during adolescence and tends to be chronic. Still, evidence on the prevalence
of social fears and SAD in adolescence is scarce. This study analyzed the prevalence of social fears
and of SAD in Portuguese adolescents. Of the initial sample (n = 1495), 26% presented with intense
self-reported social fears. Of those, 53.9% accepted to be further assessed for diagnosis, resulting
in a point-estimate prevalence of adolescent SAD of 9.4%; this is slightly higher than previously
found. Social performance was the most feared social event. Of the adolescents with SAD, 12.9%
were receiving psychological intervention, 12.1% refused intervention, and 92 (65.7%) accepted
intervention. Findings conﬁrm SAD as a highly prevalent mental disorder among adolescents,
particularly girls, and additionally, that most of these adolescents did not seek treatment but are
willing to receive help if made available. Hence, schools should be invested not only in identifying
vulnerable adolescents but also in providing diverse intervention options, tailored to their needs, and
directing them to successful developmental trajectories.

1. Introduction

Social fears refer to anxiety or discomfort in social situations in which one may be
and/or anticipates being exposed to evaluation from others, which in turn may result
in embarrassment or humiliation. From an evolutionary perspective, social fears are an
adaptive experience—they provide a social barometer that contributes to the adjustment of
oneself to peers, to the improvement and preservation of social desirability, and to careful
awareness of one’s presentation and/or behaviors [1]. However, difﬁculties may arise
when normative social situations are perceived as posing disproportionate threats, and
that perception causes a myriad of other symptoms associated with signiﬁcant impairment.
That is the case with social anxiety disorder (SAD), which is at the extreme end of the social
anxiety continuum. SAD is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of everyday
social and/or performance situations [2]. Individuals with SAD often report concerns
such as fear of one’s anxiety symptoms (i.e., shaking, sweating, blushing, stuttering) being
visible to others and/or fear of seeming anxious, strange, incompetent, or uninteresting [3].
SAD has its most frequent onset during adolescence (i.e., before the age of 18) [4–6].
Most of the social situations reported to be difﬁcult by adolescents with SAD occur in school
contexts and include talking to peers, starting or joining a conversation, writing on the
board, and other social performances tasks (e.g., athletic, reading aloud in class) [7]. When
left untreated, difﬁculties associated with SAD seem to perpetuate into adulthood [8,9]
following a typically chronic and debilitating course [10]. SAD can lead to signiﬁcant
impairments and have impact in various domains of the life of adolescents (e.g., greater

risk for school dropout, poorer qualiﬁcations, increased likelihood to be a victim of bul-
lying, fewer friends, less gratifying interpersonal relationships) [11,12]. Over time, these
difﬁculties are associated with an overall reduction in quality of life [12]. Furthermore,
SAD has been linked to increased vulnerability to other anxiety and mood disorders [13,14],
behavioral disorders [14], and substance abuse [13,15].

Despite the growing body of research concerning the recognition of, evaluation of,
and intervention with SAD, the disorder still seems to be neglected. Speciﬁcally, SAD
presents one of the lowest rates of treatment seeking [16,17]. This may be associated with
several factors: on the one hand, social anxiety seems to be underrecognized and elicit less
concern and help-seeking recommendations by adolescents themselves [18]; additionally,
social anxiety is perceived to be embarrassing to have, which in turn predicts (alongside
other variables) how much others want to distance themselves from the socially anxious
person [19]; ﬁnally (and paradoxically), experiencing SAD symptoms and being aware
of the stigma associated with mental health in general has also been associated with less
intention to seek help, particularly from peers and informal adults [20]. This reluctance to
ask for support might indicate that the real impact of this disorder is not known, especially
in adolescents. Alongside this gap, evidence regarding the prevalence of SAD is scarce,
particularly in adolescent samples. Existing research on the prevalence estimates of SAD
can be found in Table 1.

It shows that only a minority of studies included referred to adolescent samples [15,21,27,32,38].
Prevalence rates greatly varied, with estimates ranging from 0.8% to 36%. Prevalence estimates may
present discrepancies due to geographical and cultural factors [47]. As such, studies conducted in
Eastern countries [48] and Western countries [37] showed disparate prevalence rates, concluding
that Eastern societies tend to report lower estimated rates of SAD. Additionally, age ranges (i.e.,
increasing age can lead to higher SAD prevalence; e.g., [42]), methodological differences and/or
gender seem relevant variables. Prevalence rates of SAD were systematically found to be higher in
females when compared to males, with women also reporting greater clinical severity and higher
levels and number of social fears. This gender-sensitive prevalence of SAD seems to be more
preponderant in adolescence and become more moderate along the course of life [49]. However,
some studies reported an equal gender distribution in adolescence (i.e., statistically non-significant
differences between females and males regarding the prevalence of SAD) [14,30].

Acknowledging the prevalence of impairing mental disorders such as SAD in a critical
developmental phase such as adolescence is an important epidemiological responsibility [50].
Advancing epidemiological understanding of SAD may help to promote preventive and
interventional approaches targeted at early ages, who are usually more reluctant to look
for specialized treatment [20]. Still, evidence on that prevalence has been scarce recently,
particularly so considering adolescent samples only and considering the continuity of social
anxiety, going from normative to high and then impacting intensity. As such, the current
work will explore the prevalence of heightened levels of social anxiety and of SAD; those
presenting with heightened levels of social anxiety may be at higher risk for SAD but are rarely
considered in the literature. Because SAD is proposed to be more prevalent in females [49], we
expect to replicate that finding in relation to adolescent SAD. Moreover, we expect to confirm
previous indications that SAD presents one of the lowest rates of treatment seeking [16,17],
but we are also interested in exploring the prevalence of who would be willing to receive
treatment if offered, which has not been considered before. Finally, we are interested in
exploring the intensity of different core social fears associated with SAD (i.e., observation,
social interaction, and social performance). The existence of such core fears is implicit in
the diagnostic criteria for SAD, but adolescent SAD has not been explored in relation to
those fears. Because these criteria consider a performance specifier for SAD [2], we would
expect those fears to be particularly noteworthy. Findings taken from this work may help

refine intervention guidelines for those presenting with SAD that are or not proactively
seeking treatment.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants

The initial sample consisted of 1495 participants aged between 15 and 18 years old
(M = 15.71; SD = 0.82), of which 62.3% were girls (n = 932) and 37.7% were boys (n = 563).

2.2. Instruments
2.2.1. Screening for Intense Social Fears

The Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A) [28,51] was used for screening
adolescents who might present with heightened social anxiety and could be further assessed
for SAD. It is a self-report questionnaire that assesses adolescents’ subjective experiences of
social anxiety. It consists of 22 items (e.g., “I worry that others don’t like me”) answered
on a 5-point Likert scale according to how much the item “is true for you” (1 = “not at
all” to 5 = “all the time”). Scores may range from 22 to 110 and higher scores reﬂect
higher levels of social anxiety. The scale comprises a total score and three subscales,
namely the Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE), the Social Avoidance and Distress of New
Situations (SAD-New), and the Generalized Social Avoidance and Distress (SAD-General).
In the original study, the FNE, SAD-New, and SAD-General subscales presented good
internal consistencies with Cronbach’s alpha values ranging from 0.76 to 0.91 [28]. In
the SAS-A Portuguese version, Cronbach’s alpha values reached 0.87 for FNE, 0.74 for
SAD-New, 0.71 for SAD-General, and 0.88 for the total score, also representing a good
internal consistency [51]. For the screening phase of the current work only the total score
was used, and it presented a good internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.89.

2.2.2. Diagnostic Assessment

The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents
(MINI-KID) [22,52] was used for deﬁning the presence/absence of a diagnosis of SAD.
It is a structured diagnostic interview for the assessment of DSM-V Axis I diagnoses in
children and adolescents. The MINI-KID utilizes a branching tree logic, wherein two to four
screening questions are presented for the evaluation of speciﬁc diagnostic criteria for each
clinical diagnosis. All questions are answered in a yes/no format. If the screening questions
are positively answered, additional symptom questions are presented. The MINI-KID
includes items that allow the exclusion of medical, organic, and/or drug causes for disor-
ders. Administration time ranges from 30 to 90 min. In its original version, the MINI-KID
presented excellent interrater reliability across diagnoses except for dysthymia [22]. The
Portuguese version of MINI-KID resulted from a careful translation and backtranslation
process and has been previously utilized as a method for diagnoses assessment [52]. Clin-
icians conducting the assessment phase of the present study received speciﬁc training,
engaged in role-play training exercises, and observed experienced evaluators applying the
interview before conducting individual evaluations.

2.2.3. Self-Reported Core Social Fears

The Social Anxiety and Avoidance Scale for Adolescents (SAASA) [29] was used to
characterize the core social fears of adolescents presenting with SAD. It comprises 30 items
in its adapted version for late adolescents [53]. It includes two scales assessing the intensity
of anxiety and the frequency of avoidance in social situations across the same six factors:
interaction with the opposite sex, assertive interaction, observation by others, interaction in
new social situations, performance in social situations, and eating and drinking in public.
The items are rated on a ﬁve-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 1 = “none” to 5 = “very
much” for anxiety, and from 1 = “never” to 5 = “almost always” for avoidance). Scores
may range from 30 to 150 for each scale and higher scores reﬂect higher levels of social
anxiety/avoidance. In its 30-item version tailored for late adolescents, the SAASA has

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12458

5 of 13

shown adequate internal consistency values with Cronbach’s alphas over 0.70 [53]. For the
present study, a version of the scale that groups the items into three factors related to the
main social fears reported by adolescents (i.e., being observed in public, performance, and
social interactions [54]) was used for comparing core social fears experienced by adolescents
with SAD. Using this sample and this version of the measurement model, good internal
consistency was found with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.81 to 0.89.

2.3. Procedures

The sample was collected from Portuguese high schools located in the north and center
regions of Portugal. The procedures and goals of the study were shared with thirty-eight
schools, following which consent for participating in this work was requested from their
executive boards. Twenty-six schools (4 from the north region and 22 from the center
region) accepted to collaborate in the implementation of the project. Written and informed
consent from the guardian or legal representative was requested for all students attending
the 10th and 11th grades. Potential participants were informed on the goals and procedures
of the research and the conﬁdentiality and anonymity of their responses were guaranteed.
Students were asked to voluntarily participate in the study and informed verbal assent
was requested.

The study then included three phases (i.e., screening for intense social fears, diagnostic
assessment, and intervention referral). The screening phase consisted of requesting assent-
ing students to ﬁll in the Portuguese version of the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents
(SAS-A; [51]). Adolescents who participated in this screening composed the initial sample
of this work (see above) that was used to analyze the prevalence of intense self-reported
social fears. The following diagnostic assessment phase of this work invited adolescents
scoring one standard deviation above the mean found for a large normative sample on
the SAS-A (i.e., M = 46.97, SD = 11.16; [51]) for an individual structured clinical inter-
view (i.e., the Portuguese version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview
for Children and Adolescents; [52]). This allowed us to analyze the prevalence of SAD.
Based on their diagnostic assessment using the MINI-KID, participants fulﬁlling inclusion
(i.e., primary diagnosis of SAD) and exclusion criteria (i.e., primary diagnosis other than
SAD, psychotic symptoms, suicidal risk, special education needs) segued to intervention
referral. At this stage, adolescents who were referred to intervention within the research
project from which these data were taken ﬁlled in a self-report protocol on social fears
and other related variables; their scores on social fears were used to characterize diverse
core social fears associated with adolescent SAD. Further information on the intervention
implementation phase of the project will not be detailed in the present study—for more in-
formation contact the principal investigator of the research project and/or ClinicalTrials.gov
Identiﬁer: NCT04979676.

3. Results

Figure 1 summarizes prevalence estimates found for the screening, diagnostic assess-

ment, and intervention referral phases of the current work.

3.1. Prevalence of Intense Self-Reported Social Fears

Of our initial sample (n = 1495), 26% (n = 388) presented with intense self-reported
social fears (i.e., scoring one standard deviation above the mean found for a large adolescent
normative sample; [20]). There were signiﬁcant differences between participants reporting
and not reporting intense self-reported fears concerning their scores on the complete
measure of the SAS-A (M = 66.38, SD = 7.68 and M = 41.69, SD = 9.07; t(1493) = 7.96,
p < 0.001, d = 2.94).

Of those presenting intense self-reported social fears (n = 388), 209 (53.9%) accepted to
participate in the diagnostic assessment phase of the study; 179 (46.1%) were not assessed.
Those who accepted being assessed reported signiﬁcantly higher levels of self-reported

social anxiety for the complete SAS-A (M = 67.47, SD = 7.50) than those who were not
assessed (M = 65.11, SD = 7.71; t(386) = 3.05, p = 0.002, d = 0.31).

intervention referral phases of the current work.

3.2. Prevalence of Social Anxiety Disorder

Of adolescents participating in the diagnostic assessment phase of the study (n = 209),
140 (67%) presented a diagnosis of SAD, of which 118 (56.5%) had SAD as their primary
diagnosis; alternatively, 33% (n = 69) did not fulﬁl diagnostic criteria for SAD. Those who
fulﬁlled (M = 67.64, SD = 7.59) and did not fulﬁl (M = 67.12, SD = 737) those diagnostic
criteria did not differ signiﬁcantly on self-reported social anxiety based on the complete
measure of the SAS-A (t(207) = 0.48, p = 0.63, d = 0.06). Relating to the initial sample
(n = 1495), 9.4% of the participants had a SAD diagnosis, of which 7.9% had SAD as their
primary diagnosis. Of the 140 adolescents diagnosed with SAD, 76.4% were girls (n = 107)
and 23.6% were boys (n = 33). In relation to the complete sample (n = 1495), this signiﬁes
a prevalence point-estimate of SAD of 11.16% in girls and 5.86% for boys. Signiﬁcant
differences were found between boys and girls regarding the presence/absence of a SAD
diagnosis (χ2(1) = 13.82, p < 0.001, d = 0.19). The standardized residual value (>|1.9|) shows
that there are more girls than boys than statistically expected to have a SAD diagnosis.
Alternatively, fewer boys than statistically expected had a SAD diagnosis. Still, though

Prevalence of Intense Self-Reported Social Fears Of our initial sample (n = 1495), 26% (n = 388) presented with intense self-reported social fears (i.e., scoring one standard deviation above the mean found for a large adoles-cent normative sample; [20]).

girls scored higher (M = 68.34, SD = 7.55) than boys (M = 65.39, SD = 7.39), the between-
gender difference on the complete measure of the SAS-A was not statistically signiﬁcant
(t(138) = 1.97, p = 0.05, d = 0.39); it was, however, statistically signiﬁcant for the fear of
negative evaluation subscale only (t(138) = 3.04, p = 0.003, d = 0.56), with girls presenting
signiﬁcantly higher scores (M = 25.39, SD = 3.33) than boys (M = 23.21, SD = 4.30).

3.3. Intervention Referral

Of the adolescents diagnosed with SAD (n = 140), 92 (65.7%) were available for segue-
ing to the intervention phase of the study. Alternatively, 17 (12.1%) refused intervention
and 13 (9.3%) adolescents did not segue into the intervention phase due to other motives
(e.g., special education needs, SAD not being the primary diagnosis). Only 18 (12.9%) were
already receiving psychological intervention for SAD. Self-reported social fears, based on
the complete SAS-A, did not differ signiﬁcantly across these groups (F(3139) = 1.81, p = 0.15,
f = 0.21).

The 92 participants who segued to the intervention phase of the study completed
the SAASA (along with other measures) at pre-intervention. Using those data, a mixed
ANOVA using gender as between-subject and measures as within-subject factors showed
that only the main effect of measure was statistically signiﬁcant (F(2, 180) = 42.11, p < 0.001,
η2 = 0.32); the main effect of gender (F(1, 90) = 2.57, p = 0.11, η2 = 0.028) and the interaction
effect (F(2, 180) = 1.99, p = 014, η2 = 0.022) were not statistically signiﬁcant (see Figure 2).
Post hoc pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni correction showed that all three factors
differ from each other, and this difference is statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.001). When the
three social fears are compared—being observed (M = 2.69; SD = 1.05), social interactions
(M = 3.19; SD = 0.82), and performance situations (M = 3.77; SD = 0.99)—performance
situations are highlighted as the most feared by adolescents.

4. Discussion

SAD is a debilitating and highly prevalent condition in adolescence and is related to
signiﬁcant impairments in multiple domains of life [12]. Because difﬁculties associated with
this disorder tend to persist throughout life, early detection and intervention are critical
research concerns [9]. However, epidemiological information regarding SAD prevalence
rates, particularly in adolescence, is still very limited. The present study aimed to bridge
this gap by estimating the current prevalence rates of intense self-reported social fears and
of SAD as per DSM-V diagnostic criteria, using a representative Portuguese sample.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 15    Figure 2. Core social fears by gender. 4. Discussion SAD is a debilitating and highly prevalent condition in adolescence and is related to significant impairments in multiple domains of life [12]. Because difficulties associated with this disorder tend to persist throughout life, early detection and intervention are crit-ical research concerns [9]. However, epidemiological information regarding SAD preva-lence rates, particularly in adolescence, is still very limited. The present study aimed to bridge this gap by estimating the current prevalence rates of intense self-reported social fears and of SAD as per DSM-V diagnostic criteria, using a representative Portuguese sample.  About a quarter of adolescents recruited from school contexts reported intense social fears (i.e., 26%), though only about half of them was available to better explore their social fears by participating in a diagnostic interview. This unavailability may reflect the mental health stigma associated with social anxiety in adolescence. Previous evidence has pointed to social anxiety being subjected to perceived/societal stigma [19] and that such perceived stigma had a demotivating effect in help-seeking behavior, even in the presence of SAD symptoms [20]. Because this subthreshold social anxiety has been linked with sig-nificant impairment [55], it seems important to be aware of and invest in prevention strat-egies towards participants that might present risk factors for SAD. For instance, following upon previous evidence on the efficacy of school-based intervention directed at improv-ing general knowledge about mental illness and at promoting help-seeking and help be-haviors (e.g., [56,57]), it would be important to specify these interventions to social anxiety in particular, which is particularly unrecognized by adolescents [18]. Of those participants who reported intense self-reported social fears and were willing to be assessed, 33% did not fulfil criteria for a SAD diagnosis based on the DSM-V criteria. Thus, though those participants experienced subjective social anxiety, their experience did not (yet) convey a psychological disturbance. According to previous findings, the trajec-tory of these participants’ social anxiety symptomatology may depend on several in-trapersonal (e.g., behavioral inhibition, [58]; biased interpretation of ambiguous social events, [59]) and interpersonal (e.g., less successful social interactions, [59]) variables. Hence, it would be relevant for school contexts to be aware of these vulnerability profiles, so that adolescents within them may be directed early on to appropriate interventions.  As for the presence of SAD, our results place the point-estimated prevalence of SAD in Portuguese adolescents at 9.4%; specifically, a ratio of approximately 1 to 3 was found regarding SAD prevalence. This value is slightly higher than data from previous studies that considered similar age groups (e.g., [15,37,38]) and it is much higher than a previous 2.763.893.222.453.373.1Social interactionsObservationSocial performanceFemaleMaleInt.

About a quarter of adolescents recruited from school contexts reported intense social
fears (i.e., 26%), though only about half of them was available to better explore their social
fears by participating in a diagnostic interview. This unavailability may reﬂect the mental
health stigma associated with social anxiety in adolescence. Previous evidence has pointed
to social anxiety being subjected to perceived/societal stigma [19] and that such perceived
stigma had a demotivating effect in help-seeking behavior, even in the presence of SAD
symptoms [20]. Because this subthreshold social anxiety has been linked with signiﬁcant
impairment [55], it seems important to be aware of and invest in prevention strategies
towards participants that might present risk factors for SAD. For instance, following
upon previous evidence on the efﬁcacy of school-based intervention directed at improving
general knowledge about mental illness and at promoting help-seeking and help behaviors
(e.g., [56,57]), it would be important to specify these interventions to social anxiety in
particular, which is particularly unrecognized by adolescents [18].

Of those participants who reported intense self-reported social fears and were willing
to be assessed, 33% did not fulﬁl criteria for a SAD diagnosis based on the DSM-V criteria.
Thus, though those participants experienced subjective social anxiety, their experience did
not (yet) convey a psychological disturbance. According to previous ﬁndings, the trajectory
of these participants’ social anxiety symptomatology may depend on several intrapersonal
(e.g., behavioral inhibition, [58]; biased interpretation of ambiguous social events, [59]) and
interpersonal (e.g., less successful social interactions, [59]) variables. Hence, it would be
relevant for school contexts to be aware of these vulnerability proﬁles, so that adolescents
within them may be directed early on to appropriate interventions.

As for the presence of SAD, our results place the point-estimated prevalence of SAD
in Portuguese adolescents at 9.4%; speciﬁcally, a ratio of approximately 1 to 3 was found
regarding SAD prevalence. This value is slightly higher than data from previous studies
that considered similar age groups (e.g., [15,37,38]) and it is much higher than a previous
work using a Portuguese adolescent sample [27]. This may reﬂect the post-conﬁnement
period the world is now facing. Speciﬁcally, while conﬁned, adolescents might have
temporarily felt comfortable and protected from demanding social situations [60]. However,
and because social isolation has been generally associated with increased social anxiety-
related symptomatology [61], these same adolescents may have felt more prominent social
fears upon returning to school contexts [62]. As such, SAD may be a more pressing
concern nowadays.

This point-estimated prevalence was much higher for girls then for boys. Additionally,
girls were signiﬁcantly more prone to experience pathological levels of social anxiety when
compared with boys. This gender difference may have been highlighted by the age group
under study, as some studies have shown that gender differences in the prevalence of SAD
are greatest among adolescents and seem to diminish along the course of life (see [49]
for a review). It is also worth noting that the presentation of self-reported social anxiety
was similar across boys and girls, except for fear of negative evaluation. The prospective
association between fear of negative evaluation and social anxiety over time has been found
for adolescence [63], and so may be one of the mechanisms through which girls are more
vulnerable to social anxiety than boys. It is also worth mentioning that adolescents with
SAD reported most fearing performance in formal events (such as school presentations),
followed by interaction with others and then being observed. On the one hand, this lends
support to some youth presenting with a more evident (and perhaps circumscribed) fear
of performance events, such as anticipated in the DSM-V speciﬁer for performance SAD
only [2]. On the other hand, the prominence of this fear may be related to the age range
we considered in this work, in which adolescents are likely starting to focus on school
achievement as a necessity to progress to higher education. Unfortunately, this fear (and
social anxiety in general) may be counterproductive to achieving desired academic goals
(e.g., [64]).

Of the 140 diagnosed adolescents, only 18 (12.9%) were already receiving treatment.
This is in accordance with previous literature stating that the prevalence of adolescents

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12458

9 of 13

with SAD diagnosed in school contexts that are not under treatment is very high [27,65],
perhaps because difﬁculties associated with social anxiety have less impact on the school
dynamics themselves (i.e., socially anxious students typically do not disturb classes) but
rather impact mostly on how the individual internalizes their difﬁculties (i.e., subjective
suffering) and achieves academic success.

Interestingly, when the possibility of receiving treatment was available, high rates of
acceptance were found. Speciﬁcally, 65.7% of those diagnosed with SAD were willing to be
provided with free psychological intervention for SAD. This result is, surprisingly, higher
than what was found in previous studies that have showcased reluctance of adolescents
with SAD in seeking treatment (e.g., only 24.1% of adolescents with SAD looked for special-
ized treatment; [16]). It has been stated that doubts about where to obtain treatment and
the fear of being negatively evaluated for seeking it are the main reasons why individuals
with SAD are reluctant to seek treatment [66]. In this case, however, adolescents did not
have to proactively seek treatment; rather, it was offered to them. This suggests that if
treatment is made available for adolescents to accept it (instead of waiting for them to
seek it), adherence results will improve and progress can be achieved in closing the gap
between the beginning of symptomatology and treatment seeking (previously stated to
be of 15 years; [67]). Hopefully—because there are empirically validated interventions
available to be implemented speciﬁcally in school contexts (e.g., [68])—the trajectories of
social fears and SAD of these adolescents can also be changed.

The ﬁndings of the present study further point to school settings as privileged contexts
for identifying and treating mental health issues in young ages. Offering school-based pre-
vention and/or intervention programs constitutes an important mental health responsibility
that may help bring efﬁcacious treatments to communities that have been systematically
found to be under-diagnosed and lacking access to treatment. It may additionally con-
tribute to increasing literacy in mental health (i.e., in school personnel, parents, caregivers)
leading to more accurate and earlier identiﬁcation and referral of mental health issues,
including SAD [18]. Considering the possible advantages that interventions in schools can
have, future studies may investigate this from a community-based perspective on schools
that foster parents, teachers, students and other school personnel as active ingredients of
change [69].

Despite the relevance of the present study, some limitations should be considered
when interpreting its ﬁndings. For example, prevalence results/estimates may greatly
vary due to different methodological aspects (e.g., age, period of reference). Following
this perspective, results should be compared carefully. Additionally, gender was the only
sociodemographic variable assessed in the current study. It might be relevant to explore
differences between adolescents within different age groups, different years of education
and/or different social economic status in future studies. Even though the school context
proved to be a privileged setting for the identiﬁcation of adolescents with SAD, this does
not invalidate that other contexts may be important for a broader detection of the disorder.
In addition, the present study considered only schools from the north and center regions of
the country. Future studies should aim for a broader recruitment. The selection method can
also be considered a limitation, since we did not evaluate the entire sample for diagnostic
criteria (i.e., only those who scored high on the SAS-A; [51]). As such, we may have lost
teenagers who did not self-report social fears.

5. Conclusions

The results of this study corroborate that SAD is a highly prevalent mental health
disorder among adolescents and that, though being particularly prevalent in girls, boys’
and girls’ social fears seem to present similarly. Though we were not able to explore other
demographic correlates and social backgrounds in relation to prevalence of intense social
fears or SAD, their potential impact should not be overlooked and that should be considered
in future research. Given the major impact SAD holds not only when difﬁculties emerge but
also throughout life when left untreated [10], current ﬁndings emphasize the importance of

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12458

early diagnosis, prevention, and intervention for adolescent social anxiety, which may be
particularly useful if adopting a broadened perspective. Speciﬁcally, on the one hand, it
may be useful to consider not only those adolescents presenting with SAD but also those
presenting with intense social fears, and how they may beneﬁt from similar or speciﬁc
intervention approaches. Cognitive therapy was found to be effective in adult SAD [70]
as well as promising in adolescent SAD, whether when delivered in person [71,72] or
remotely [73]. Other approaches are also showing potential and should be further explored
(e.g., acceptance and commitment therapy [74]). In addition to studying their therapeutic
efﬁcacy, it might be important to consider the optimal length of treatment for different
intensities of social anxiety symptoms and by that means have different preventive and
adequate cost–beneﬁt approaches to adolescent social anxiety. It may be the case that
adolescents with intense social fears, compared to those with SAD, are less reluctant to
seek help and/or may require less intervention sessions to achieve relevant therapeutic
gains; there is no previous evidence on this at this time. On the other hand, schools were an
evident context to identify and scrutinize social anxiety and thus should be seen as holistic
contexts to be made more aware of how they can help identify vulnerable students and
help them cope, in addition to directing them to available interventions. Previous ﬁndings
have shown that the most frequent recommendation made by adolescents to someone
experiencing social anxiety is to seek help from friends [20]. Friends may, then, have a
dual role towards their socially anxious peers: they can help their peers appropriately
cope with social events if they have sufﬁcient literacy about the difﬁculties associated with
social anxiety, and/or they can be an optimal (albeit indirect) route for socially anxious
adolescents seeking formal help. Moreover, because our ﬁndings indicate that adolescents
with SAD seem to be receptive to intervention being offered to them, school personnel
should also be made more aware of the symptoms and suffering associated with social
anxiety, so that they can make help-seeking options openly available to those who may
beneﬁt from them. Overall, the impact of schools’ mental health literacy on help-seeking,
helping and/or being open to treatment could be the focus of future work. Regardless,
this inclusive and community-based perspective may overall be the route to prompting
higher levels of social functioning, better interpersonal relationships, increased school
satisfaction and success on the part of vulnerable adolescents, and consequently, better
overall mental health.
