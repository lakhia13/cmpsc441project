Abstract

Objective—Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is a conjoint parent-child 
treatment developed by Cohen, Mannarino, and Deblinger that uses cognitive-behavioral 
principles and exposure techniques to prevent and treat posttraumatic stress, depression, and 
behavioral problems. This review defined TF-CBT, differentiated it from other models, and 
assessed the evidence base.

Methods—Authors reviewed meta-analyses, reviews, and individual studies (1995 to 2013). 
Databases surveyed were PubMed, PsycINFO, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, 
Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, PILOTS, the ERIC, and the CINAHL. They 
chose from three levels of research evidence (high, moderate, and low) on the basis of benchmarks 
for number of studies and quality of their methodology. They also described the evidence of 
effectiveness.

Results—The level of evidence for TF-CBT was rated as high on the basis of ten RCTs, three of 
which were conducted independently (not by TF-CBT developers). TF-CBT has demonstrated 
positive outcomes in reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, although it is less clear 
whether TF-CBT is effective in reducing behavior problems or symptoms of depression. 
Limitations of the studies include concerns about investigator bias and exclusion of vulnerable 
populations.

Conclusions—TF-CBT is a viable treatment for reducing trauma-related symptoms among 
some children who have experienced trauma and their nonoffending caregivers. Based on this 
evidence, TF-CBT should be available as a covered service in health plans. Ongoing research is 
needed to further identify best practices for TF-CBT in various settings and with individuals from 
various racial and ethnic backgrounds and with varied trauma histories, symptoms, and stages of 
intellectual, social, and emotional development.

This article reviews the literature on TF-CBT as part of the Assessing the Evidence Base 
Series (see box on next page). The objectives were to describe the components of TF-CBT, 
assess the level of evidence (that is, methodological quality) of existing studies, and provide 
a concise summary of its overall effectiveness. The review included studies that investigated 
the use of TF-CBT with children exposed to a range of traumatic events who had 
experienced trauma-related mental health problems. The review also examined the 
effectiveness of TF-CBT in addressing specific symptoms, such as those of PTSD and 
depression, and problem behaviors. Finally, the review highlighted the limitations and areas 
that need additional research. This information will help payers and policy makers as well as 
families of children exposed to trauma make informed decisions about treatment.

Description of Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy

TF-CBT is defined in the 2006 treatment manual Treating Trauma and Traumatic Grief in 
Children and Adolescents (1), although descriptions of the key cognitive-behavioral 
components developed by Deblinger, Cohen, and Mannarino were described in earlier 
literature (9). The primary goal of TF-CBT is to reduce PTSD symptoms among children 
and adolescents. TF-CBT provides structure for the use of cognitive-behavioral principles in 
the context of two paramount developmental considerations: the role of the caregiver and the 
developing nature of a child’s emotion regulation and coping capabilities. The model 
originally was designed to address PTSD symptoms associated with sexual abuse: 
depressive symptoms, behavior problems (including aggression and inappropriate sexual 
behaviors), and unhelpful thoughts and feelings regarding the abuse, such as cognitive 
distortions, guilt, and shame. Subsequently the model has been adapted to treat various types 
of abuse and other traumas, such as experiencing physical or emotional abuse or neglect and 
witnessing community or domestic violence, traumatic loss, war, or natural disasters. TF-

CBT was designed to be delivered in 12–16 sessions of outpatient treatment, depending on 
the needs and abilities of the child and caregivers.

The model also addresses the emotional reactions of nonoffending parents and caregivers. 
This population is defined as individuals who were not involved in perpetrating the abuse, 
although they may also be experiencing PTSD symptoms related to the abuse. Caregivers 
who may have been involved in causing the trauma (such as domestic violence or physical 
abuse) but who have subsequently received successful treatment or otherwise been found to 
be supportive of the child and able to ensure physical and emotional safety may also be 
involved in treatment, depending on the needs of the child.

Over time, TF-CBT has been applied to symptoms and behaviors associated with a broad 
range of traumas, such as other forms of child maltreatment, domestic violence, community 
violence, accidents, natural disasters, war, and other events involving traumatic loss (10–
15). Key elements of the intervention are summarized in Table 1. They include 
psychoeducation, gradual exposure, behavior modeling, coping strategies, and body safety 
skills training. Each of these elements may be adjusted according to the treatment needs of 
the child and family involved.

To help children and adolescents develop coping skills, treatment providers teach relaxation 
skills, affective modulation skills, and cognitive coping skills. In addition, TF-CBT uses 
exposure principles and cognitive-restructuring techniques that are specific to the traumatic 
experience. Exposure involves gradually introducing individuals to reminders of the trauma 
that may be tangible, such as places or people, or intangible, such as specific memories of 
traumatic events. The gradual exposure reduces distress associated with these reminders and 
decreases trauma-related reactions. Cognitive restructuring involves identifying inaccurate 
and unhelpful thoughts and beliefs (for example, self-blame) associated with traumatic 
events and developing more adaptive ways of understanding and drawing conclusions about 
the trauma and the victim’s reactions to it.

Early versions of TF-CBT tended to place different levels of emphasis on certain 
components, such as exposure (16), and various ways of naming the approach evolved. Two 
teams, one led by Deblinger and the other by Cohen and Mannarino, each created a 
structured manual for their approach. These two teams then collaborated, and in 1997 they 
integrated their similar approaches to treatment. They coauthored a manual on TF-CBT, 
which was published in 2006 (1). In that manual, TF-CBT treatment components were 
summarized by using the acronym PRACTICE (1), and this summary forms the basis of our 
definition for TF-CBT as it appears in the research literature. The eight components (the first 
of which has two pieces) of PRACTICE are an elaboration of the original models and 
include Psychoeducation and Parenting skills, Relaxation, Affect modulation, Cognitive 
coping and processing, Trauma narrative, In-vivo mastery of trauma reminders, Conjoint 
child-caregiver sessions, and Enhancing safety and development.

A central focus of TF-CBT is to ensure an approach that is developmentally appropriate for 
the needs of children and their caregivers. This includes a developmentally sensitive 
assessment and fostering of coping strategies to help children better manage trauma-related

distress and emotional reactions. After children learn coping skills, they participate in 
exposure-based components of treatment. An example is the creation of a trauma narrative
—a gradual exposure and cognitive-processing exercise that creates the individual’s story 
about the abuse. The narrative is intended to reduce distress and resolve maladaptive 
cognitions associated with trauma-related memories, which can be affected by 
developmental factors such as level of cognitive and emotional maturity.

A second developmental consideration of TF-CBT is incorporating a nonoffending caregiver 
into the child’s recovery process. In the TF-CBT model, parents and children participate in 
parallel treatment sessions; for each component of treatment, the therapist spends part of the 
session with the child and part with the caregiver. In addition, the child shares the trauma 
narrative with the caregiver in the session. This allows the caregiver to provide support and 
helps the child correct distortions in his or her understanding of the abuse, including those 
related to what happened and who is to blame. Caregivers often also participate in the 
session with the child to enhance the safety component, so that the child can receive adult 
support in regaining a sense of security and well-being (1).

Clearly, the implementation of this model as outlined depends on the presence of a 
competent, child-focused caregiver at the time of treatment, which cannot be presumed in all 
families affected by abuse and maltreatment. Many children are referred for TF-CBT via 
social services or other agencies that are involved with the child because of concerns about 
the caregiver’s capacity to provide care and safety, making full implementation of the 
caregiver components a challenge or impractical. For that reason, TF-CBT allows for a 
number of adaptations to the key components. The parallel-treatment components for 
caregivers can be provided to any available caregiver, such as a foster parent or another 
adult who can provide appropriate parenting support and is involved in the child’s daily life. 
During conjoint sessions, a child may choose to share the trauma narrative with an adult 
whom he or she identifies as supportive and trusted (for example, a grandparent, aunt, 
trusted teacher, or guidance counselor), regardless of whether this adult is involved in day-
to-day care. Sessions are also held between the caregiver and the therapist throughout 
treatment, including prior to conjoint sessions, to ensure the ability of the caregiver to 
respond in a caring and supportive manner and to help prepare the caregiver for the sharing 
of the narrative.

Five core elements of the TF-CBT model

Although other variations of CBT for traumatized children and adolescents have been 
reviewed in recent years (17,18), this review focused on what we identified as five core 
elements of the current TF-CBT model and the iterations that preceded it. These are 
psychoeducation; coping strategies, such as relaxation, identification of feelings, and 
cognitive coping; gradual exposure, for example, through imagining or in-vivo exposure; 
cognitive processing; and caregiver participation, such as parent training and conjoint 
sessions. Although studies that were conducted before publication of the most recent 
treatment manual used an earlier version of the manual, all the studies reviewed here 
adhered to the five key elements we have identified.

We evaluated TF-CBT for the treatment of a broad range of traumatic events, rather than 
focusing on a specific type of trauma, as was the case for two reviews published in 2013 by 
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (19,20). One of the AHRQ 
reviews provided a thorough comparative effectiveness study of cognitive-behavioral 
interventions for children and adolescents that address trauma other than maltreatment or 
family violence, but it did not cover the specific TF-CBT model defined here (19). The 
literature search for this AHRQ review merged individual and school group models (21,22) 
and included only one study of what was described as “cognitive-behavioral therapy” for 
trauma among children and adolescents (23). The second AHRQ review targeted 
maltreatment (20). The authors reviewed two studies by TF-CBT developers that are 
covered here (24,25) but no others. Thus, in this review, we provide a different perspective 
on the TF-CBT literature.

Methods

Search strategy

We conducted a search for meta-analyses, research reviews, and individual studies from 
1995 through July 2013. We searched major databases: PubMed (U.S. National Library of 
Medicine and National Institutes of Health), PsycINFO (American Psychological 
Association), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, Social 
Services Abstracts, Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress, the Educational 
Resources Information Center, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
Literature. We also examined publications that had citations pertaining to the development 
of the model (1,16,24,26). We used combinations of the following search terms: trauma-
focused cognitive behavioral therapy, trauma therapy, treatment of trauma, cognitive 
behavioral therapy for trauma, cognitive behavior therapy for sexual abuse, cognitive 
behavior therapy for physical abuse, treatment for PTSD, and trauma-focused cognitive 
behavioral therapy for child traumatic grief. We also used truncated forms of these terms 
(such as “trauma”) and alternative spellings and punctuation.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

This review was limited to U.S. and international studies in English and included the 
following types of articles: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, 
single-group time-series design studies, and review articles, such as meta-analyses and 
systematic reviews. We included only studies that investigated TF-CBT and its five key 
elements, as defined above in the description of the service. We also included review articles 
and meta-analyses that examined TF-CBT along with other cognitive-behavioral approaches 
(for example, articles that reviewed all cognitive-behavioral approaches, including TF-
CBT). We excluded studies of other cognitive-behavioral–based interventions for 
traumatized children, such as Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools, 
which involves school-based prevention and treatment groups with less caregiver 
involvement, and Narrative Exposure Therapy, which does not include other core 
components of TF-CBT.

Strength of the evidence

Page 6

The methodology used to rate the strength of the evidence is described in detail in the 
introduction to this series (27). The research designs of the studies that met the inclusion 
criteria were examined. Three levels of evidence (high, moderate, and low) were used to 
indicate the overall research quality of the collection of studies. Ratings were based on 
predefined benchmarks that considered the number and quality of the studies. If ratings were 
dissimilar, a consensus opinion was reached.

In general, high ratings indicate confidence in the reported outcomes and are based on three 
or more RCTs with adequate designs or two RCTs plus two quasi-experimental studies with 
adequate designs. Moderate ratings indicate that there is some adequate research to judge the 
service, although it is possible that future research could influence reported results. 
Moderate ratings are based on the following three options: two or more quasi-experimental 
studies with adequate design; one quasi-experimental study plus one RCT with adequate 
design; or at least two RCTs with some methodological weaknesses or at least three quasi-
experimental studies with some methodological weaknesses. Low ratings indicate that 
research for this service is not adequate to draw evidence-based conclusions. Low ratings 
indicate that studies have nonexperimental designs, there are no RCTs, or there is no more 
than one adequately designed quasi-experimental study.

We accounted for other design factors that could increase or decrease the evidence rating, 
such as how the service, populations, and interventions were defined; use of statistical 
methods to account for baseline differences between experimental and comparison groups; 
identification of moderating or confounding variables with appropriate statistical controls; 
examination of attrition and follow-up; use of psychometrically sound measures; and 
indications of potential research bias.

Effectiveness of the service

We described the effectiveness of the service—that is, how well the outcomes of the studies 
met the service goals. We compiled the findings for separate outcome measures and study 
populations, summarized the results, and noted differences across investigations. We 
considered the quality of the research design in our conclusions about the strength of the 
evidence and the effectiveness of the service. Based on the evidence, we also evaluated 
whether the practice should be considered for inclusion as a covered service in public and 
private health plans.

Results

Level of evidence

Our literature search resulted in 13 articles reporting on ten RCTs (11,13,14,24–26,28–34) 
and six review articles (10,12,18–20,35). On the basis of the criteria set forth in this review, 
the body of research on TF-CBT meets a high level of evidence. Three adequately designed 
RCTs were completed independently of the TF-CBT developers (11,28,29), and seven RCTs 
and three follow-up studies completed by or involving the developers were otherwise

determined to be of adequate design (13,14,24–26,30–34). We describe the findings of the 
publications by their type of research design.

RCTs—Our literature search yielded ten RCTs that evaluated TF-CBT with the five core 
components as defined, as well as a number of additional open trials and dismantling studies 
that clarified the evidence of its effectiveness. The brief summary here is complemented by 
additional study details summarized in Table 2. Of the ten RCTs we identified, seven 
compared TF-CBT with an active control group (13,14,24–26,29,33), and three compared 
TF-CBT with a wait-list control group (11,28,31). Three additional articles, also listed in 
Table 2, were follow-up studies to an original RCT; they included follow-up periods of one 
year or longer (30,32,34). Five RCTs evaluated TF-CBT exclusively with sexually abused 
children (24–26,29,33), one evaluated children who had been exposed to war and sexual 
exploitation (11), two evaluated a mixed-trauma sample of participants (29,31), one 
evaluated children exposed to intimate-partner violence (13), and one evaluated children 
exposed to a natural disaster (Hurricane Katrina) (14). Nine RCTs were administered in the 
individual or conjoint format (13,14,24–26,28,29,31,33); and one, an intervention with 
Congolese girls, was administered in a group format (11). Although we excluded group 
formats such as Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (which was 
specifically designed for school-based groups and did not fully adhere to the PRACTICE 
protocol), we included the study with Congolese girls because clinicians used the TF-CBT 
manual and adhered to the PRACTICE approach by involving parents in their group model.

Overall, the RCTs in our review included strong fidelity procedures coupled with very 
similar definitions of the service. In addition, most assessment tools were well validated, 
including structured clinical interviews (for example, the Kiddie Schedule for Affective 
Disorders and Schizophrenia) and self- and parent-report measures (for example, the 
University of California, Los Angeles, PTSD Reaction Index).

Nonetheless, some studies had methodological weaknesses (Table 2). The primary concern 
was investigator bias. Three RCTs with adequate designs were implemented by researchers 
who were independent of the developers of the treatment (11,28,29). However, the 
remaining seven RCTs were conducted by the developers of TF-CBT (13,24–26,33) or 
included one of the developers in some capacity (14,31). Only two of the seven RCTs 
conducted by the developers of the treatment met AHRQ’s strict guidelines for inclusion 
regarding risk of bias (24,25). Second, blinding procedures were not explicitly reported or 
were unclear or insufficient in six studies (14,24–26,28,33), and three studies had inactive 
control groups (11,28,31). Because these methodological concerns are common in the 
literature and in some cases may simply be due to omissions in reporting, we included 
studies that had no more than two perceived flaws. The only exception was one study that 
included multiple design flaws but that provided new information on treatment of very 
young children, a population rarely included in this research (35).

Review articles—The six review articles included in this review (10,12,18–20,35) are 
described in Table 3. Similarities and differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria must be 
considered when comparing these results with the results of our review, because none of the 
previous reviews assessed the level of evidence in exactly the same way as we have defined

our evidentiary assessment protocol. The reviews examined the status of evidence for 
similar and overlapping bodies of research, including TF-CBT with maltreated children only 
(20); TF-CBT for traumas that are not related to abuse, maltreatment, or family violence 
(19); and all cognitive-behaviorally oriented interventions applied to traumatized children 
(10,12,18,35).

In contrast to the generally high rating of evidence found in our review and the reviews 
described below, the two reviews conducted by AHRQ found low levels of evidence for 
cognitive-behavioral interventions for trauma. As we have noted, the first review focused on 
the treatment of children exposed to traumatic events that did not include maltreatment (that 
is, physical, sexual, emotional, or psychological abuse and neglect) or family violence (19). 
The authors identified only one study as TF-CBT—an evaluation of a cognitive-behavioral 
school-based intervention for trauma-exposed adolescents (23). This study had one major 
exception to our definition of TF-CBT: it was implemented primarily in school groups with 
little caregiver involvement, whereas our model is implemented in individual and conjoint 
child-caregiver sessions. The second AHRQ review compared parenting interventions, 
trauma-focused treatments, and enhanced foster care approaches that address child 
maltreatment (20). After excluding a number of RCTs on the basis of the likelihood of 
author bias and other stringent criteria, the authors included three RCTs of TF-CBT. Two of 
these three RCTs are included in our review (24,25), along with some RCTs that met our 
inclusion criteria but were excluded by AHRQ because they were of the “wrong population” 
(13,29,33) or “wrong intervention” (26). The third RCT reviewed by AHRQ compared 
group conditions for mothers of sexually abused children but did not assess TF-CBT for 
children because the children in both groups received TF-CBT (36); therefore, it is unclear 
why it was included in the AHRQ review (20), and we chose to exclude it from our review.

One review conducted by the Cochrane Collaboration determined that there was a moderate 
level of evidence for cognitive-behavioral approaches, including TF-CBT, for sexually 
abused children (18). The authors concluded that although there was relatively consistent 
overall evidence that CBT is effective for this population, the body of research was weaker 
than in some other reviews because of the high risk of bias (primarily due to lack of 
reporting on blinding procedures). In evaluating TF-CBT together with other cognitive-
behavioral approaches, this Cochrane review provided useful information on cognitive-
behavioral approaches in general, but it confounded the evidence in support of the 
effectiveness of TF-CBT as a distinct cognitive-behavioral approach.

The remaining three reviews we identified found that there was a high level of evidence for 
cognitive-behavioral approaches for traumatized children and adolescents, including TF-
CBT (10,20,35). In a review published in 2008, Silverman and colleagues (12) compared 
various psychosocial treatments for children exposed to trauma and included seven studies 
evaluating cognitive-behavioral therapies, including TF-CBT. This was the only treatment 
approach determined to meet the criteria of a “well-established treatment.” Another 
Cochrane Collaboration review that was most recently updated in 2012 examined 14 RCTs 
covering psychological therapies for the treatment of PTSD among children and adolescents. 
The authors concluded that compared with control conditions, the “only therapy for which 
there was evidence” was CBT (including TF-CBT) (35).

Cary and McMillen (10) reviewed ten RCTs published between 1990 and 2011 and 
concluded that the evidence for positive outcomes from cognitive-behavioral therapies for 
trauma (including TF-CBT) was consistently high. Six of the studies from this review met 
our inclusion criteria. The remaining four studies reviewed by Cary and McMillen focused 
on interventions for children and adolescents that were similar to TF-CBT (for example, 
Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools) but did not meet the criteria of all 
five key components for inclusion in our review. Furthermore, although those authors 
excluded studies that did not measure PTSD symptoms, our review included two additional 
studies that assessed symptoms other than those of PTSD (24,30).

Although Cary and McMillen (10) specifically addressed TF-CBT, the other reviews drew 
their conclusions on the basis of cognitive-behavioral therapies in general, making it 
difficult to discern what the conclusions would have been had they focused on TF-CBT 
alone. Thus the conclusions regarding the evidence for TF-CBT reached by reviews of the 
literature over the past two decades vary widely, not only because of differences in the 
definition of TF-CBT (that is, whether all cognitive-behavioral interventions for traumatized 
children and adolescents are considered to be TF-CBT) but also because of differences in 
the types of trauma that were targeted and the vulnerable populations that were excluded.

Populations—A number of issues regarding sample composition and inclusion or 
exclusion criteria are important to consider because they affect the generalizability of the 
findings. Eight of the ten RCTs in this review were conducted in the United States 
(13,14,24–26,28,31,33), and most of the children who participated were Caucasian, followed 
by African American. Less than 10% of child participants were Hispanic. As we have noted, 
one study was conducted with girls from the Democratic Republic of Congo (11). In 
addition, one study was conducted with children in Norway (73% Norwegian, 10% Asian) 
(29).

Table 2 notes the excluded populations for studies that reported this information. Eight 
studies excluded children with intellectual or developmental disabilities (11,13,24–
26,28,33), nine excluded children with psychotic symptoms (11,13,24–26,28,29,33), three 
excluded children on the basis of an impairing substance use disorder (25,29,33), and three 
excluded children who were suicidal or severely violent (11,26,28). All studies except one, 
which compared TF-CBT with a school-based intervention (12), required the participation 
of a broadly defined nonoffending caregiver. Several studies explicitly excluded parents 
with psychosis (13,24,25,33) or active substance abuse (24,25,33). Although exclusion 
criteria varied across studies, the criteria used indicate that the findings are limited in their 
ability to be generalized to children with intellectual or developmental disabilities or 
children and families affected by more serious forms of mental illness. Studies were also 
limited to outpatient clinics, thus limiting generalizability to other settings.

Effectiveness of the service—TF-CBT has been associated with improved outcomes 
over time and in comparison with control groups, although findings are somewhat 
inconsistent. As one might expect, larger effect sizes were reported when experimental 
groups were compared with inactive rather than active control groups (11,28). A majority of 
studies assessed posttraumatic stress symptoms and depressive symptoms, and some studies

assessed behavior problems, including sexual behavior problems (24,33) and aggression 
(11,25,26,28,31). A few studies assessed caregiver outcomes (25,26).

The sections below summarize results from the ten RCTs by targeted outcome. Effect sizes 
are based on comparison of the TF-CBT group with the comparison group, unless otherwise 
stated. Medium effects were defined as standardized mean differences of Cohen’s d ≥.40 
and large effects were defined as d ≥.75.

Posttraumatic stress—All studies that included an assessment of posttraumatic stress 
symptoms reported significant differences between TF-CBT and comparison treatments at 
various posttreatment time points, primarily in the medium range of effect sizes 
(13,25,26,29). Two studies that found large effect sizes compared TF-CBT with a wait-list 
control group (11,28). In the one study that compared TF-CBT with another cognitive-
behavioral school-based intervention, both treatments were effective in decreasing 
symptoms (14). In this study, symptoms were (on average) in the nonclinical range after TF-
CBT and in the low-clinical range after the school-based intervention. Two studies 
suggested that TF-CBT differentially affects specific symptoms of posttraumatic stress 
(13,28). Immediately after treatment, individuals receiving TF-CBT had greater reductions 
in hyperarousal and avoidance symptoms than in re-experiencing trauma-related symptoms, 
compared with a control group. One study also included an assessment of functional 
impairment as a result of trauma-related symptoms; TF-CBT outperformed therapy as usual 
with a medium effect size (29).

Depression—Nine studies included assessments of depression 
(11,13,14,25,26,28,29,31,33). Of five that reported statistically significant effects of TF-
CBT compared with comparison treatment, three had medium effect sizes (TF-CBT versus 
active comparison treatment) (26,29,33), one had a large effect size (TF-CBT versus wait-
list control group) (11), and one had a small effect size (TF-CBT versus child-centered 
therapy) (25). Four studies did not find TF-CBT to be significantly more effective than a 
comparison treatment in decreasing depressive symptoms, although significant pre-post 
decreases in depression were found in the experimental group (13,14,28,31). Finally, one 
study that compared TF-CBT with Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools 
found that the school intervention was effective in decreasing depression, whereas TF-CBT 
was not (14).

Behavior problems (sexual and other)—Seven studies examined co-occurring 
behavior problems, such as aggression and disruptive behavior (11,24–26,28,31,33); two of 
these studies included specific measures of sexual behavior problems (24,33). Regarding 
general behavior problems, two studies did not find significant main effects for pre-post 
treatment reductions in symptoms (24,28). Three studies found significantly greater 
symptom reduction for groups receiving TF-CBT than for comparison groups; comparison 
of TF-CBT with an active treatment group yielded medium effect sizes (25,26), whereas 
comparison with a wait-list control group yielded large effect sizes (11). Regarding sexual 
behavior problems, the two studies that included this measure found significant decreases in 
sexual behavior problems in the TF-CBT group over time (24,33). However, when the TF-
CBT group was compared with an active control group, no significant difference between

the conditions was found, although a medium effect emerged 12 months after treatment in 
one study (24).

Parenting practices—Two studies examined parenting behaviors and found significant 
improvements over time (25,26). TF-CBT was significantly more effective in increasing 
effective parenting practices (with medium effect sizes), compared with active control 
groups (that is, child-centered therapy and child-only treatment).

Individual treatment components—Several studies examined the effectiveness of 
specific treatment components (37,38). A study by the treatment developers investigated 
treatment length (eight versus 16 sessions) and the inclusion or exclusion of a trauma 
narrative (38). A second study assessed symptoms at six and 12 months after treatment (37). 
Longer treatment was associated with increased improvements in PTSD re-experiencing and 
avoidance symptoms, but it was not related to eight other outcomes (38). Compared with 
treatment without a narrative, inclusion of a narrative was associated with larger decreases 
in children’s abuse-related fear and parents’ abuse-specific distress; exclusion of a narrative 
was associated with larger decreases in behavior problems, possibly because of the increased 
amount of time focused on parent training rather than the narrative (38). Gains were 
sustained at the six- and 12-month follow-up, but the differences between conditions (longer 
or shorter treatment and inclusion or exclusion of a narrative) were no longer significant 
(37).

Retention—Several studies had a low retention rate in the TF-CBT group. For example, a 
study published in 2011 involving children exposed to interpersonal violence had a retention 
rate of 67% (13), which indicates a relatively high level of dropout. Other active treatments 
for PTSD showed similar findings (35). In a field trial in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina 
of clinic-based TF-CBT compared with school-based Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for 
Trauma in Schools, participants randomly assigned to TF-CBT were much less likely to 
attend their intake or complete treatment than those receiving the more easily accessible 
school-based treatment, suggesting that accessibility may be an important factor in treatment 
retention (14). Another study found significant individual differences between completers 
and noncompleters, with the attrition group being older and exposed to more traumas (29).

Conclusions

The treatment of trauma-related symptoms among children and adolescents is an important 
component of the service array in a modern mental health and addiction treatment system. 
TF-CBT, as developed by Cohen, Mannarino, and Deblinger (1), has received attention 
because of its applicability to various trauma types, growing evidence base, and active 
dissemination, which includes Web-based training. The purpose of this review was to 
examine the evidence associated with TF-CBT across trauma types, symptom presentation, 
and specific population characteristics. The results indicate a high level of evidence for TF-
CBT for many types of trauma and some symptoms. However, this body of evidence is not 
fully consistent across studies, and only three of the ten RCTs we found were fully 
independent from the developers of this treatment approach.

The level of evidence varied across four outcome measures: the primary outcome of 
reduction in PTSD symptoms and the secondary outcomes of improvement in depressive 
symptoms, general and sexual behavior problems, and parenting practices of the 
nonoffending parent (see Table 4). The evidence is also limited for highly vulnerable 
populations, such as for children at high risk of suicidal or violent behavior; those with 
developmental disability, psychosis, or substance use; and parents or caregivers with 
psychosis or substance use disorders.

Assessing the Evidence Base Series

The Assessing the Evidence Base series provides a systematic literature evaluation for a 
selection of commonly used mental health and substance use services. The target 
audience includes state mental health and substance use program directors and their 
senior staff, Medicaid staff, other purchasers of healthcare services (e.g., managed care 
organizations and commercial insurance), leaders in community health organizations, 
providers, consumers and family members, and others interested in the empirical 
evidence base for these services. The authors evaluated service-specific research articles 
and reviews that were published from 1995 through 2012. They provide ratings of the 
strength of the evidence, descriptions of service effectiveness, and recommendations for 
future implementation and research. Details about the research methodology and bases 
for the conclusions are contained in a separate introduction to this series.

Summary of Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy

Table 1

Service definition

Service goals

Service summary

Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is a direct service for children and adolescents and their 
nonoffending caregivers. The approach uses cognitive behavioral principles and exposure techniques to address 
symptoms of post-traumatic stress following trauma exposure as well as symptoms of depression, behavior problems, 
and caregiver difficulties. Key elements of the intervention include psychoeducation (e.g., common reactions to 
trauma exposure), coping skills (e.g., relaxation, feelings identification, cognitive coping), gradual exposure (e.g., 
imaginal, in-vivo), cognitive processing of trauma-related thoughts and beliefs, and caregiver involvement (e.g., parent 
training, conjoint child-parent sessions). To accommodate a variety of traumatic experiences, TF-CBT includes 
general psychoeducational materials with recommendations for tailoring treatment for individuals who have 
experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, interpersonal violence, or natural disasters.

develop strategies to reduce related stress and modulate and control associated feelings and thoughts

To provide structured opportunities for children and adolescents, with the support of their nonoffending 
caregiver(s), to process the trauma and learn to cope with stimuli that may lead to traumatic reactions

To support the child or adolescent in developing and maintaining a secure sense of safety as well as 
adaptive social skills

Populations

Children and adolescents who have experienced trauma and have trauma-related symptoms, including post-traumatic 
stress disorder

and
permanency)

TF-CBT met well-established criteria for 
methodological
rigor. CBT approaches, including TF-CBT, were 
associated
with greater improvements in all outcomes relative to 
non-
CBT approaches.

TF-CBT was associated with reducing symptoms of 
PTSD
(immediately and 12 months after treatment) as well as
reducing depression and problem behaviors 
(immediately but
not 12 months after treatment) compared with the 
attention
control group (a group that receives the same amount 
of
attention as the experimental group but with a placebo
approach not considered to be effective), standard
community care, and wait-list control conditions.

“Fair evidence” was cited that CBT (summarized 
together
with TF-CBT) was associated with reduced PTSD 
symptoms
compared with wait-list, usual care, and other therapies
(supportive therapy, nondirective counseling, 
psychodynamic
therapy, and hypnotherapy).

CBT, including TF-CBT, was associated with reducing
symptoms of PTSD and anxiety, although effects were
modest. CBT may have positive effects for children 
who
have been sexually abused, but more study is needed.

Evidence was low for CBT interventions targeting 
children
exposed to trauma, regardless of whether they were
experiencing symptoms. School-based treatments with
elements of TF-CBT showed promising effects for 
children
exposed to trauma.

Authors stated that a strong conclusion in support of 
any of
the therapies, including CBT, could not be drawn from 
the
studies examined in the review.

”CBT” was used to refer to all psychological treatments for children and adolescents that were based on cognitive-behavioral principles, whether 
or not it was cited as TF-CBT. “TF-CBT” was used to refer to treatments including all core components as outlined in the present review.

Summary of evidence for the effectiveness of Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)

Table 4

Evidence for the effectiveness of Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT): moderate to high

Compared with control conditions, TF-CBT demonstrates mixed but overall positive evidence for the following outcomes:

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms: high

•

Robust findings indicate that TF-CBT reduces PTSD symptoms over time, compared with control groups and other types of 
cognitive-behavioral interventions. This is the primary goal of the intervention.

Depressive symptoms: moderate

•

Most studies found that TF-CBT reduced symptoms of depression, compared with control groups. However, several studies found 
significant pre- to posttreatment reductions in depression in the experimental group but not in the control groups.

Behavior problems and sexual behavior problems: moderate

•

In most studies, TF-CBT reduced general and sexual behavior problems over time; however, TF-CBT did not consistently show 
greater reductions compared with control groups.

Parenting practices for a nonoffending parent: moderate

•

Two studies showed that TF-CBT increased effective parenting practices and improved the parent’s emotional reactions to the 
child’s abuse over time and, in one study, compared with the control group at 12-month follow-up. Although the number of 
supporting studies is small, no other studies showed negative findings.
