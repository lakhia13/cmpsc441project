Mindfulness is a technique you can learn to be fully present and engaged in the moment without judging anything. It can help you manage your thoughts, feelings and mental health.


### What is mindfulness?


Mindfulness exercises are ways of paying attention to the present moment using techniques like meditation, breathing, and yoga. Training helps people become more aware of their thoughts, feelings, and body sensations so that instead of being overwhelmed, they’re better able to manage them.

TheOxford Mindfulness Centrehas more information on how mindfulness works.

We have a guide on mindfulness that you can download or order


### What are the benefits of mindfulness?


Mindfulness can help you:

- understand your emotions better

- cope better with difficult thoughts

- boost your attention and concentration

- improve your relationships

Studiesshow that mindfulness-based approaches can significantly reduce the symptoms ofanxietyanddepression. They can also help people who have been depressed several times to stay well and avoid relapsing.


### Who can practice mindfulness?


Anyone who wants to improve their day-to-day well-being can practice mindfulness. While it has roots in Buddhism, you don’t have to be religious or spiritual to practice it.

However, you may not find mindfulness helpful if you’re very unwell and would find it too overwhelming to learn a new skill. You also need to be prepared to notice difficult thoughts, which could make you feel worse at first.

People withpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)should know that mindfulness could worsen their trauma symptoms. If you’ve experiencedtrauma, paying close attention to yourself in mindfulness exercises can trigger flashbacks, intense emotions or dissociation. Make sure your teacher is properly trained and able to adapt the exercises for you if necessary.

If you’re unsure,talk to your GPor a trained mindfulness practitioner before starting.


### How can I practice mindfulness?


There are some structured mindfulness programs aimed at helping people with specific problems.

- Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is designed to help people with recurring depression. It combines mindfulness withcognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)to help break negative thought patterns.NICE recommends MBCT for people with recurrent depression who are currently well

- Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) involves mindfulness meditation and yoga. It can help participants deal withstress,depression,anxietyand pain

In general, MBCT and MBSR are group-based and run over eight weeks by a qualified practitioner.

### Mindfulness in daily life


As well as setting aside time for more formal practice, you can practise mindfulness daily. For example:

- Notice everyday things like the air moving past you as you move, the feel of a bannister as you go upstairs, or the taste and textures of the food you eat

- Pick a regular time – such as your morning commute or evening walk – to be more aware of the sensations caused by the world around you

- Try something new, like a different route home from the station or a different seat on the bus. This can help you notice the world in a different way

- Watch your thoughts. If you sit quietly for a few moments, you will probably notice thoughts drifting through your mind. Instead of engaging with them, simply observe them and let them go
