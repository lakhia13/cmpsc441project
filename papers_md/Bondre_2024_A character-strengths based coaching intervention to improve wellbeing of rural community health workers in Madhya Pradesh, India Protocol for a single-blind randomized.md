Background: There is scarce knowledge on the use of structured positive psychology interventions for reducing
work-stress and improving wellbeing of rural community health workers in India, particularly the Accredited
Social Health Activists (ASHAs) who are village-level (resident women, incentivised) lay health workers. This
trial will test the effectiveness of a ‘character-strengths’ based coaching intervention compared to routine su-
pervision on wellbeing (‘authentic happiness’) of ASHAs.
Methods: This protocol is for a single-blind, parallel group randomized controlled trial comparing the effec-
tiveness of a five-day residential workshop focusing on the use of character-strengths and subsequent 8- to 10-
week remote telephonic coaching (weekly) to individually support ASHAs to improve their wellbeing, against
routine health system support. The arms are intervention added to routine ASHA supervision (weekly, by the
ASHA supervisor), and routine supervision alone (control arm). The target sample comprises 330 rural ASHAs in
Madhya Pradesh, India. The primary outcome of mean Authentic Happiness Inventory (AHI) scores will be
compared between arms at 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include an assessment of ASHA’s self-
reported affect, self-efficacy, flourishing, burnout, motivation, physical health symptoms, quality of life, and
routine work performance indicators, and the consequent patient-level outcomes [e.g., service satisfaction and
depression remission rates after receiving brief psychological treatment by trained ASHAs]. We will also evaluate
the costs of developing and delivering the intervention.
Discussion: This trial will determine whether a character-strengths based coaching intervention is an effective and
scalable approach for reducing work-stress and improving wellbeing of rural ASHAs in low-resource settings.

1. Introduction

Community Health Workers (CHWs) in low-resource settings expe-
rience high levels of work-stress [1,2], while serving the communities
they live in, and bridging their health needs [3–5] with formal health
system outlets such as primary care clinics. Accredited Social Health
Activists (ASHAs) in India are one such cadre and play a significant role
under the National Health Mission (NHM) to strengthen the delivery of

primary health services in rural communities [6]. In India, there is
typically one ASHA (woman, resident) per village (for a population of
~1000) who receives an initial 23-day training on linking community
members to basic health services, providing basic first aid and supplies,
and mobilizing the community around water, sanitation, nutrition, and
health issues [7]. There are more than a million ASHAs selected and
trained in India, making it one of the largest CHW programs in the world
[7].

ASHAs are vulnerable to work-related stress, contributed by unequal
workload distribution [8,9] and gender inequities within the health
system [10]. Prior studies have reported low compensation relative to
work demands, and dependence on incentives compared to other sala-
ried personnel with whom they work (such as Auxiliary Nurse Mid-
wives), in addition to delays in receiving performance-based incentives,
poor institutional support, inadequate respect from seniors and peers
[11], and limited voice to express their concerns being at the bottom of
health system hierarchy [12]. On the other hand, patriarchal values
embedded within households and the wider village community, family
expectations around gendered domestic responsibilities, low socioeco-
nomic
to
individual-level stress [8,10].

and limited education contribute

status, poverty,

While addressing these issues will need continued structural changes
at multiple levels of the health system and the society at large, the
potentially more immediate solutions aimed at promoting mental health
and well-being of ASHAs are worth examining. There is a scarcity of
studies addressing stress among CHWs in LMICs such as India [1], and
prior work has generally focused on improving the ‘external’ factors
such as monetary incentives, supervision strategies, task-allocation and
flexibility, public recognition, and rewards, with inadequate attention to
‘intrinsic’ factors such as mental health, coping abilities, and wellbeing
of ASHAs themselves [13].

In this respect, the personal attributes or strengths of an individual
may influence the negotiation with work-stress. Cross-sectional studies
indicate positive associations between specific ‘character-strengths’ (e.
g., inquisitiveness or gratitude) and psychological well-being among the
nursing cadres [14,15], who are similar to ASHAs in their job roles, with
the mediating effects of social support and self-efficacy [15], or
engagement in work [16]. Recent experimental evidence among nurses
has also shown that interventions, combining the use of character--
strengths with mindfulness-based practices, have reported higher ab-
‘hedonic’ (pleasure-attainment) and ‘eudaimonic’
solute scores of
(meaning
exclusively
self-realisation) well-being,
and
mindfulness-focused interventions [17].

than

Keeping rural ASHAs in mind, there is scarce knowledge of the use of
such intervention models through experimental designs for improving
wellbeing, and an absence of longitudinal studies and randomized
controlled trials [18]. Further, the typical approach of ‘identify and use’
the strengths in challenging situations, adopted by studies in other
global settings [19,20] (with more educated and privileged workplace
employees in high-income regions) would need substantial contextual
adaptation for CHWs such as ASHAs in India, as shown in our process of
development of the proposed intervention [13].

1.1. Study objectives and hypothesis

The objective of this two-arm randomized controlled trial is to
compare the effectiveness of a character-strengths based coaching
intervention on wellbeing of ASHAs relative to routine health system
supervision that ASHAs already receive.

The hypotheses include:

A) Primary hypothesis: ASHAs who receive the proposed coaching
intervention (in addition to routine supervision) will show
greater wellbeing than those who receive routine supervision
alone.

B) Secondary hypotheses:

a) ASHAs who receive the proposed coaching intervention (in
addition to routine supervision) will show greater reduction in
burnout and increase in motivation scores, than those who
receive routine supervision alone.

b) ASHAs who receive the proposed coaching intervention will
show greater improvement in service delivery indicators (e.g.,
daily service contacts for routine services such as prenatal
treatment
check-ups and conducting brief psychological

sessions for depression) than those who receive routine su-
pervision alone.

c) ASHAs who receive the proposed coaching intervention will
show greater patient satisfaction for depression care services,
and rates of remission in their patients’ depression severity at
endpoint, than ASHAs who receive routine supervision alone.
(Note: All ASHAs prior to baseline assessment will be trained
to deliver the brief psychological treatment for depression, see
Fig. 1)

2. Methods

2.1. Study design

This study will have a two-arm single-blind parallel randomized
controlled trial design with equal allocation of participants (ASHAs)
between arms (Fig. 1). ASHAs in the control arm will be supported by
their routine ‘ASHA facilitators or supervisors’ who typically supervise a
group of ~20 ASHAs on a weekly basis.

2.2. Study setting

This trial will be conducted in Sehore district in the state of Madhya
Pradesh (MP) in central India. Being one of the largest states of India, MP
has a population of over 72 million, nearly 73 % of whom live in rural
areas [21–27] and it lags other Indian states with respect to human
development and availability of resources [23,28]. About ~1300 rural
ASHAs work in Sehore district and as part of the study team’s earlier
trial, ~330 ASHAs were trained to deliver an evidence-based brief
psychological treatment for depression i.e., the Healthy Activity Pro-
gram (HAP) [29].

2.3. Study procedures

2.3.1. Participant recruitment

The trial will include Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs),
working at the intersection of primary care and community levels, and
currently not receiving any structured evidence-based coaching in
improving their wellbeing and/or coping with work-stress [Note: We use
the term ‘work-stress’ to indicate overall stress experienced by an ASHA,
contributed by workplace, domestic (home/family environments) and
village-level (her work in the community through house-to-house visits
and village-level healthcare activities) stressors.]

Recruitment will start with the research coordinator and study data
manager compiling a list of ASHAs from all blocks in Sehore district with
the support of the District Program Manager, National Health Mission,
and Block Medical Officers. This list will form the sampling frame for the
trial. From the sampling frame, we will exclude ASHAs who have
participated in mental health trainings, which could potentially equip
them with mental health knowledge and techniques to manage their
work-stress/burnout [30]. Finally, we will exclude ASHAs who have
been a part of formative focus group discussions to develop the inter-
vention for the present trial [31] and ASHAs who participated in the
content testing phase of the intervention [13].

We have defined the ASHA selection criteria as follows:
Inclusion criteria for ASHAs: All rural ASHAs residing and working in
Sehore district, Madhya Pradesh (verified in the health system records)
who have been trained on delivering the evidence-based brief psycho-
logical treatment for depression [29] will be included in the trial.
Exclusion criteria for ASHAs: a) ASHAs who plan to migrate within six
months of recruitment and b) ASHAs who do not plan to continue
working, or those who have resigned or planning to change jobs within
six months of recruitment.

We have also defined the selection criteria for patients who will
receive depression care by the ASHA, in the course of their routine work.
Inclusion criteria for patients: All persons identified by the ASHA in the

2

community with a score of 10 or above on the nine-item Patient Health
Questionnaire [32] who consent to participate in the trial. Exclusion
criteria for patients: a) children and adolescents (10–19 years of age as
defined by WHO), b) patients with significant speech, hearing, language
or cognitive impairment, c) patients needing urgent medical or psychi-
atric attention, d) patients not planning to stay in the trial location for at
least 3 months after initial screening, and e) patients not understanding
Hindi.

2.3.2. Participant training on the evidence-based brief psychological
treatment for depression

In the sampling frame, we will sample a target of 330 ASHAs for
orientation and training on the Healthy Activity Program (HAP), an
evidence-based brief psychological treatment for community-based care
for people identified with depression [29]. We will use simple random
sampling (SRS) without replacement for this purpose. SRS will offer
maximum sample diversity, equal chance of representation of all ASHAs,
high internal and external validity and ease of data analysis [33,34].
This is about 25 % higher than the required number of ASHAs (n = 244,
refer 2.6) to account for potential attrition/loss to follow-up and health
workers who may decline to participate in HAP training and/or further
study processes i.e., baseline assessments, intervention activities and
outcome assessments (Fig. 1). The sampled ASHAs will be assigned
unique participant IDs, which will be used to contact them regarding
trial recruitment. These IDs will stay with the ASHAs throughout the
trial period. The research team will call the sampled ASHAs from the list
to invite them to participate in the study, starting with an in person
orientation on the digital training platform [29] and training for deliv-
ering the HAP. After orientation and training completion, ASHAs will
start community screening for depression and delivery of 6–8 HAP ses-
sions (every ~8–15 days) for each patient. ASHAs will also receive
fortnightly peer group supervision for the delivery of HAP as docu-
mented in previous contextual studies [29,35]. A dedicated team of HAP
supervisors, through the MindScroll Learning Management System [36],
will supervise the ASHAs’ challenges in delivering HAP, and also
retrieve the data on delivery of HAP sessions.

2.3.3. Baseline assessment

ASHAs who have completed HAP training, delivered HAP sessions to
patients, and received peer group supervision for their delivered HAP
sessions, will be invited to come to their nearest community/primary
health center to participate in a group information session. A trained
research team member will explain the goals of the study to the group
and what their participation will involve, depending on the (subsequent)
arm allocation. We will provide an overview of the time required to
participate in either of the experimental conditions (intervention or
control arm) and the completion of study outcome assessments. ASHAs
who are interested and willing to participate will meet with a research
assistant, who will confirm eligibility and review a study information
sheet and consent form with them. The research assistant will ensure
that the ASHA has fully read and understood the participant information
sheet and consent form before obtaining written informed consent. We
will document the number of ASHAs who are eligible to participate, who
decline participation (with reported reasons) and who are lost to follow-
up.

After consenting, ASHAs will complete the baseline assessment. A
research assistant will collect demographic information (including, for
example, age, years of work experience, education level, and ownership
of assets), and participants will self-report the primary outcome of
wellbeing (i.e., authentic happiness), and additional measures (i.e.,
ASHA’s affect, self-efficacy, flourish, burnout, motivation, physical
health symptoms and quality of life). The baseline assessment will
require approximately 2–3 h to complete. ASHAs will take short breaks
at any time during the assessment and will be provided with snacks. The
research assistant will be present throughout the process to respond to
queries and ensure that ASHAs are able to complete the assessment
forms.

From the standpoint of patient recruitment, all patients (of both
arms) who score ≥10 on the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-9) and have agreed to receive the first HAP session by the ASHA
will be approached for participation in the study, and after obtaining
written informed consent, the research team member will administer the
baseline assessment (i.e., social and demographic information) to the

3 

A.P. Bondre et al.

Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications 42 (2024) 101377 

patient. We will use the PHQ-9 score as assessed by the ASHA prior to
starting HAP as the ‘baseline’, and the endline assessment including a
repeat PHQ-9 and assessment of patient satisfaction, conducted by the
research assistant after 3 months, will allow a comparison of pre- and
post-HAP PHQ-9 scores, in addition to between-arm comparison of
remission rates at follow-up.

2.3.4. Randomization

Following the baseline assessment, ASHAs will be randomly allo-
cated (1:1) to one of two study arms using Stata-17 [37]. Stata allows the
researcher to set the ‘seed’ used to start the random number generator
(RNG) process, so that it is reproducible; and it tracks the ‘state’ which
the RNG is in before each command is run. Therefore, with each com-
mand, the RNG ‘state’ within the seed changes, which maintains the
randomness of each subsequent command. Since we will train all ASHAs
on HAP prior to randomization, any potential effects of mental health
training on ASHAs’ own wellbeing will be balanced between the arms.
Prior to randomization, we will first stratify ASHAs who will complete
baseline assessments using age (in years) and education level (number of
total years of education), as these are some of the variables that may
affect an ASHA’s absorption of the intervention content and potentially
affect the wellbeing outcome. Stratification will ensure that age- and
education-distribution between the arms is balanced. Research team will
inform all ASHAs (regardless of arm allocation) of the scheduled dates of
their next (1-month) follow-up assessment, and so on for 3-month and
6-month follow-ups. Further, a separate research assistant will call the
ASHAs and confirm their availability to attend the intervention resi-
dential workshop (if allocated to the intervention arm). ASHAs allocated
to the intervention arm will receive the workshop within 7–10 days of
baseline assessment.

2.3.5.

Interventions

2.3.5.1. Routine health system support. As per National Health Mission
guidelines [38], supervisors (‘facilitators’) provide support to ASHAs
and ‘mentor’ them to improve their effectiveness, particularly for ASHAs
who function poorly on many of their tasks or remain absent in periodic
meetings/trainings. Possible reasons for poor functionality of these
ASHAs include their low skill or knowledge levels, delays in payments,
irregular medication supply for their services, inappropriate behaviours
of health system staff, lack of family support for working, illness in the
family, other social barriers, or no interest in working as ASHAs.
Therefore, routine supervision will be treated as the standard of care in
this trial. ASHAs in the intervention arm will receive the proposed
positive psychological coaching intervention in addition to routine su-
pervision. ASHA supervisors will not be involved in the coaching
intervention activities i.e., residential workshop and remote coaching,
due to hierarchical differences between supervisors and ASHAs, which
can potentially affect ASHAs’ reception/experiences of the intervention.

2.3.5.2. Positive psychological coaching intervention added on to routine
support. The proposed intervention will include a five days residential
‘coaching workshop’ for ASHAs, followed by ‘telephonic coaching sup-
port’ to enable ASHAs to use the learnings from the workshop to address
stressful situations arising in the field during their routine work. As part
of the design, we expect the residential workshop to be led by a facili-
tator (AK, also the intervention development lead) for batches of 15–20
ASHAs each, and the telephonic coaching to include phone calls
(~30–45 min in duration) between the assigned intervention coach and
the ASHA, every week/every 10 days, lasting for 8–10 weeks. The trial
team will include a dedicated group of eight intervention coaches for a
required sample of 122 ASHAs who will be allocated to the intervention
arm. The residential workshop will be conducted in the Sehore district
team office, with staying and food arrangements for ASHAs. A pre- and
post-workshop knowledge assessment will be conducted. A survey

capturing the cost of workshop delivery and including the cost incurred
by the ASHA due to the workshop will be administered to the workshop
batch on day-5. The detailed process of intervention development, from
a review of positive psychology and intervention development litera-
ture, to developing the intervention blueprint, and its contextual adap-
tation resulting into the modules of the workshop has been published
earlier [13]. The process of intervention development generated a
‘Content Manual’ including four modules for handover to the ASHAs (for
their reference throughout the trial, and beyond), and a detailed 5-day
comprehensive plan for content delivery using a workshop ‘Facilita-
tor’s Manual’, and other additional facilitation-related supporting ma-
terials (e.g., exercise sheets, charts, energizers, and PowerPoint slides)
[13].

Remote telephonic coaching will commence a week after the ASHAs
have completed the workshop, returned home and resumed their daily
work. Each weekly coaching call will be scheduled based on ASHA’s
convenient time/availability. The coach assigned to a batch of ASHAs
will be present during their 5-day workshop and have prior knowledge
of ASHAs (mutual rapport), which will help the coach-ASHA interaction
during the call. ASHAs are expected to discuss their weekly workplace
challenges with the coach during the call and receive support by the
coach to address work-stress resulting from these challenges, based on
the strategies learnt in the workshop.

Before starting each call, the coach will seek ASHA’s verbal consent
for call recording – this is to maintain fidelity using a self-rated checklist.
The team has self-developed a remote coaching supervision checklist
based on related therapist competence checklists [39] used in the South
Asian context. The items of the checklist reflect the coaching protocol
and the discussions during coach training. Eight coaches will be divided
into two groups and each week, randomly selected audio recorded
coaching call sessions (1–2 per week) will be distributed to each group of
four coaches, along with supervisors, for rating. These sessions will be
reviewed by the supervisors (AK, APB) and the checklists, self-rated by
the coaches delivering the calls, and peer-rated by other coaches will be
discussed with supportive feedback during weekly supervision sessions.
Self-, peer- and supervisor-rating, combined with weekly supervision
meetings with supportive feedback will enhance learning and up-skilling
of the coaches. This process will be followed for an expected eight
batches of intervention workshops.

During the 4th and 8th call, the coach will also administer a short
survey capturing the cost of remote coaching delivery and any expenses
incurred by the ASHA due to the remote coaching (refer 2.4.5). From a
participant compensation standpoint, each ASHA will receive INR 900
and INR 800 for a total of five days of workshop and eight coaching calls,
respectively (~ USD 20).

2.4. Study measures

All questionnaires will be self-administered using paper forms
overseen by research coordinators and research assistants blinded to
participants’ arm allocation. All assessments will be targeted for
completion within seven days of the due assessment date in each arm.
For each of the baseline, 1-month, 3-month and 6-month follow-up
visits, the ASHA will receive INR 300 (~ USD 3.5) as participant
compensation.

2.4.1. Primary outcome (ASHA-level)

Authentic Happiness Inventory (AHI) is a subjective measure for the
assessment of happiness [40]. We have used the term ‘wellbeing’ to
represent this specific measure of happiness (including hedonic (plea-
sure attainment) and eudaimonic (meaning and self-realisation) well-
being). AHI includes 24 sets of five statements [e.g., ranging from 1 (“I
feel like a failure”) to 5 (“I feel I am extraordinarily successful”)] from
which, the respondent chooses the statement that best describes her
feelings in the past one week. AHI has been designed for monitoring
upward changes in happiness [40] and has often been used in positive

Components of

support

As per National Health Mission guidelines [38], supervisors (‘facilitators’)
provide support to ASHAs and ‘mentor’ them to improve their effectiveness,
particularly for ASHAs who function poorly on many of their tasks or remain
absent in monthly meetings/trainings. Possible reasons for poor functionality
of these ASHAs include their low skill or knowledge levels, delays in
payments, irregular medication supply for their services, inappropriate
behaviours of health system staff, lack of family support for working, illness in
the family, other social barriers, or no interest in continuing as ASHAs.
Therefore, routine supervision will be treated as the standard of care.
Typically, supervisor meetings with ASHAs take place weekly, in person, in
groups of ~20 (1 supervisor for ~20 ASHAs).

1. ASHAs will continue to receive routine supervisory support as discussed

previously.

2. ASHAs will receive a five days residential ‘coaching workshop’ followed
by remote individual ‘telephonic coaching support’ to enable them to use
the learnings from the workshop to address stressful situations arising in
the field during their routine work. As part of the design, we expect the
residential workshop to be led by a facilitator (AK, also the intervention
development lead) for batches of 15–20 ASHAs each, and the telephonic
coaching to include phone calls (expected 30–45 min in duration)
between the assigned intervention coach and the ASHA, every week/
every 10 days, lasting for 8–10 weeks. The intervention team will include
a dedicated group of eight coaches for a required sample of 122 ASHAs
who will be allocated to the intervention arm. The residential workshop
will be conducted in the Sehore district team office, with staying and food
arrangements for ASHAs.

psychology intervention studies [41–44]. Internal consistency at pre-test
has been reported to be high (Cronbach’s α = 0.94). AHI has been
validated for construct validity, and linguistically/contextually adapted
for this trial. AHI will be administered at baseline, 3 months (primary
outcome assessment) and 6 months (potential long-term effects on
wellbeing).

2.4.2. Secondary outcomes (ASHA-level)

For assessing the possible explanatory variables, which could
contribute to the hypothesized between-arm difference in wellbeing/
authentic happiness scores at 3-month follow-up, the 20-item interna-
tional Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) Short Form (I-
PANAS-SF) will be used to assess ASHA affect [45]; the ‘Flourish index’
(by VanderWeele, T.J.) including two questions from each of the five
principal domains of happiness and life satisfaction, mental and physical
health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, and close social
relationships, will be used to assess flourishing [46]; and the Occupa-
tional Self Efficacy Scale (OSES) will be used to assess self-efficacy [47].
These measures will be administered at baseline, 1- and 3-months. For
assessing the levels of variables related to wellbeing/authentic happi-
ness, the emotional exhaustion sub-scale of the Maslach Burnout
Inventory–Human Service Survey [48], the motivation scale pretested
for Indian frontline health workers [49], the 14-item Physical Health
Questionnaire [50] to assess somatic symptoms (contributed by
life survey
work-stress/burnout) and the health-related quality of
(EQ-5D) validated for the Indian population [51] will be used at base-
line, 3- and 6-months.

service

Daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly

delivery measures
(depending on the type of service and as routinely monitored by the
health system) will represent a global measure of routine ASHA services
(non-mental health) in terms of their contact points with the commu-
nity, for example through home visits, facility contacts, and community
visits. We will categorize this outcome as per the type of services, such as
proportion of antenatal check-ups, vaccinations, or post-natal care visits
completed out of the expected for a defined period (e.g., month or
quarter, as gathered by the health system). We will collect the service
delivery data from the district team from the period starting from
baseline till 6-month follow-up for between arm comparisons. We will
gather data on the fidelity of the routine supervision activities from
ASHA supervisors of both arms as part of data collection for secondary
ASHA-level outcomes to monitor the ‘standard of care’ as discussed in
section 2.3.5.1 and Table-1. Besides this aspect, there is no involvement
of the health system appointed ASHA-supervisors in the study or the
intervention. Refer Table 2 for details on ASHA-related outcome

measures.

With respect to depression care delivery, we will calculate the
number of ASHAs’ HAP sessions, on a weekly basis. At 3-month and 6-
month follow-up, we will compare the numbers of these HAP sessions
between arms (Note: HAP treatment durations range from 6 weeks to 3
months), in addition to numbers of patients with closed (completed)
treatments and drop-outs.

2.4.3. Secondary patient outcomes

At baseline, we will administer the socio-demographic assessment
(section-2.3.3) and retrieve the PHQ-9 score assessed by the ASHA prior
to initiation of HAP. At 3-month follow-up, the PHQ-9 will be repeated
to determine if the patient remitted. In addition, patient’s satisfaction
with HAP will be assessed using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire
(CSQ-8), used earlier in India with psychiatric outpatients [52,53]).
Finally, we will administer the adverse event form to determine the
reporting of any adverse/severe adverse events in the intervening
3-month period and report the data to Sangath Institutional Review
Board (IRB). Refer Table 3 for patient-related outcome measures.

2.4.4.

Intervention process indicators

The intervention development team will monitor and document data
on the number of ASHAs attending the batches of residential workshops,
possible withdrawals during and after the workshop, and a pre- and
post-workshop knowledge assessment. The average number of days
between workshop closure and initiation of first remote coaching call
will be calculated to assess the engagement of the ASHA. The number of
coaching calls and average call duration will be recorded (minimum
calls: 8). Further, the patterns of ASHAs re-scheduling the calls, with
dropouts/losses to follow-up during the remote coaching phase will be
documented.

2.4.5. Cost of development and delivery of the intervention

From the point of view of development of the workshop and the
remote intervention (blueprint, content development and content
testing, as detailed elsewhere [13], and its pilot (October 2022 to May
2023), we will gather data from Sangath internal administrative team,
based on similar prior studies involving development of training pro-
grams for ASHAs [54] such as information related to involved personnel
(their roles, responsibilities, time spent, and salaries or payments), in-
formation technologies (e.g., smartphone data packs for remote coach-
ing), travel (e.g., fuel expenses for content testing and pilot workshops),
and infrastructure-related costs (e.g., vehicle, office space, workshop
space, utilities).

Efficacy Scale

Authentic Happiness Inventory
(AHI) is a subjective measure for
the assessment of happiness [40].
AHI includes 24 sets of five
statements [e.g., ranging from 1
(“I feel like a failure”) to 5 (“I feel
I am extraordinarily successful”)]
from which, the respondent
chooses the statement that best
describes her feelings in the past
one week. AHI has been designed
for monitoring upward changes in
happiness [40] and has often been
used in positive psychology
intervention studies [41–44].
Internal consistency of 0.94 at
pre-test has been reported.

The I-PANAS is developed as a
measure of the affective
component of subjective
wellbeing. The five positive affect
(PA) states include: active,
determined, attentive, inspired,
and alert. The five negative affect
(NA) states include: afraid,
nervous, upset, hostile, and
ashamed. Higher scores on both
PA and NA items indicate the
tendency to experience a positive
and negative mood. Respondents
are requested to rate the
statement on a 5-point scale (not
at all to extremely) by comparing
themselves during the past 2
weeks with their ‘usual selves’.
The “Flourish” index (FI) consists
of two questions or items from
each of the following five
principal domains: happiness and
life satisfaction, mental and
physical health, meaning and
purpose, character and virtue, and
close social relationships [46].
Each of the questions is assessed
on a scale of 0–10. The FI score is
obtained by adding the scores
from each of these ten questions
(total: 0–100). The “Secure
Flourish” index (SFI) is similar to
the FI, except for two additional
questions on financial and
material stability, which may
indicate the capacity to sustain
flourishing across the five
principal domains. For
interpretation, the FI and SFI
scores are reported as averages of
the questions (rather than sums),
therefore all scores are scaled
from 0 to 10.
The scale consists of 19 items and
uses a five-point Likert-scale with
the response range varying from
one for ‘strongly disagree’ and
five for ‘strongly agree.’ Some
sample items for this measure are
‘When confronted with a difficult
task, I am willing to spend
whatever it takes to accomplish
it,’ and ‘I adjust quickly to
challenges that come in my work.’

Baseline, 3- and 6-
month follow-up

We have used the term ‘wellbeing’
to represent this specific measure
of happiness – AHI items represent
both hedonic (pleasure
attainment) and eudaimonic
(meaning and self-realisation)
wellbeing.

Mean AHI scores will be
significantly greater in the
intervention arm or among
ASHAs receiving the
character-strengths based
coaching intervention in
addition to routine
supervision, compared to
ASHAs receiving routine
supervision alone (control
arm)

I-PANAS-SF has acceptable
psychometric properties such as
cross-cultural stability and
factorial invariance [70] and there
is prior evidence of this measure
being used to assess affect in other
workplace employees in India [71]

Total PA and NA scores will
be significantly greater and
lesser, respectively, in the
intervention arm relative to
the control arm

Baseline, 1- and 3-
month follow-up

Mean FI and SFI scores will
be significantly greater in
the intervention arm relative
to the control arm

Baseline, 1- and 3-
month follow-up

The questions in FI are based on
existing questions, which have
received empirical validation and
are widely used in studies on
wellbeing. Studies have put forth
the psychometric properties of
both these indices [72] -evidence
of validity and reliability
(Cronbach’s α = 0.89 for FI;
Cronbach’s α = 0.86 for SFI).

The scale’s psychometric
properties have been analysed in
the Indian context [47].

Mean OSES scores will be

The overall questionnaire
measures three burnout
components: emotional
exhaustion (8 items, Cronbach’s α
= 0.89), depersonalization (5
items, Cronbach’s α = 0.69) and
reduced personal accomplishment
(7 items, Cronbach’s α = 0.79).
Emotional exhaustion is seen as
the core component of this tool.
Items are scored on a seven-point
Likert’s style scale – ‘never’ to
‘daily’ [48,57].
The tool has 23 items, with
answers given on an agreement
scale of 1–4 (1 = strong
disagreement, 4 = strong
agreement). Reverse coding is
done for negative questions
before analysis. The scale for
negatively worded question is 1
(strong agreement) to 4 (strong
disagreement). The tool has eight
major constructs: general
motivation, burnout, job
satisfaction, intrinsic job
satisfaction, organizational
commitment, conscientiousness,
timeliness and personal issues
Respondents indicate how much
they have been bothered by each
of 14 symptoms in the past month.
Response options are “not at all”,
“bothered a little”, and “bothered
a lot.”
Somatic symptom categories
include gastrointestinal problems,
headaches, sleep disturbances,
and respiratory illness.
Average score is calculated for
each participant.

The EQ-5D includes five questions
on mobility, self-care, pain, usual
activities, and psychological
status with five possible answers
for each item. The maximum
score of 1 indicates the best health
state, by contrast with the scores
of individual questions, where
higher scores indicate more
severe or frequent problems. In
addition, there is a visual
analogue scale (VAS) to indicate
the general health status with 100
indicating the best health status.
A survey form will be generated
with a list of routine ASHA
performance indicators in
consultation with the district
health team. The form will
include indicators for various
services such as antenatal and
postnatal care, reproductive
health, and immunization.
Examples of specific indicators
include proportion of antenatal
checkups expected out of total
pregnant women in the ASHA’s
catchment area (for a fixed period
e.g., a reporting month) and
proportion of antenatal checkups
completed out of total expected
checkups.
With respect to depression care,

health providers in low- and
middle-income countries [1].

Mean MBI scores will be
significantly lesser in the
intervention arm relative to
the control arm

Baseline, 3- and 6-

The tool is adapted from a
motivation construct developed by
Mbindyo et al. which is adapted
from Bennet et al. [49,73,74]. The
tool has been used with
community health workers in
rural health facilities in India.

Mean motivation scores will
be significantly greater in
the intervention arm relative
to the control arm

Baseline, 3- and 6-
month follow-up

Prior validation results showed
that the PHQ is composed for four
factors representing
Gastrointestinal Problems,
Headaches, Sleep Disturbances,
and Respiratory Infections. The
factors contributed to substantial
amounts of item variance, and the
PHQ dimensions demonstrated
acceptable levels of internal
consistency, except somewhat low
for the Respiratory Infections
subscale (0.66) [50].
Norms for Indian population are
available [51] based on a survey of
3548 adults in five states of India.
The utility score was calculated
using the EQ-5D-5L value set and
norm scores were generated for
age, sex, and other
socio-demographic variables.

Mean PHQ-14 scores will be
significantly lesser in the
intervention arm relative to

Given the evidence-base,
improved wellbeing can
contribute to improved service

We will assess costs incurred by
ASHAs due to their participation
in their respective intervention
workshop and remote coaching
activities. A post-workshop
questionnaire (on day-5) and a
remote coaching questionnaire
(during the 4th and 8th coaching
call, covering data of the previous
calls) will be developed and
administered to capture
individual-level costs incurred by
ASHAs, such as items covering
their workshop/remote coaching
time, workshop travel time,
workshop travel costs,
smartphone data packs (remote
coaching) and food/refreshment
costs (residential workshop).

As indicated in 2.3.5.2, we will assess costs incurred by ASHAs due to
their participation in their respective intervention workshop and remote
coaching activities. A post-workshop questionnaire (on day-5) and a
remote coaching questionnaire (during the 4th and 8th coaching call,
covering data of the previous calls) will be developed and administered
to capture individual-level costs incurred by ASHAs, such as items
covering their workshop/remote coaching time, workshop travel and
travel costs, smartphone data packs (remote coaching) and food/
refreshment costs (residential workshop).

2.4.6. Post-trial focus group discussions

We will conduct focus group discussions (FGDs) with a purposive
sub-sample of ASHAs in the intervention arm after the completion of 3-
month follow-up assessments to understand their perspectives/experi-
ences of the workshop and remote coaching intervention, and a second
round of focus groups after 6-month follow-up assessments to explore
any sustained (longer-term) application of intervention learnings by
ASHAs to cope with work stress. FGDs will be moderated by a study team
member who is not involved in intervention development/delivery or

2.5. Blinding

Research coordinators and research assistants administering study
assessments to ASHAs and patients, will be blind to participant alloca-
tion, and study investigators (except data manager) will also be blind to
participants’ experimental condition. Participants will be told their arm
allocation only after consent and baseline assessment. There is complete
separation between the team members involved in developing or
delivering the intervention and assessing intervention fidelity and pro-
cess indicator data (2.3.5.2 and 2.4.4), and the team members involved
in administering the outcome assessments (2.4.1 to 2.4.3). Outcome
team members and investigators will be unblinded after the completion
of analysis of data of baseline, 1-, 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments.

aimed at improving wellbeing among community health workers in
India, we referred to methodologically similar designs for calculating
the sample size [55–57]. We will measure the change in wellbeing, pre-
and post-intervention,
in terms of mean happiness scores on the
Authentic Happiness Inventory (AHI). We initially assumed a significant
between-group difference of 0.19 points (effect size: 42 %) for the mean
happiness scores at 3-month follow-up for the intervention arm (mean:
3.35, SD: 0.43) and control arm (mean: 3.16, SD: 0.48). With 90 %
power and a two-sided α of 0.05, 122 ASHAs per arm are required to
measure this difference by the independent group t-test.

The patient-outcome of depression severity will be measured by the
nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [32]. We will assess the
proportion of patients who show ‘early remission’ or attain a
post-treatment score of <10 [58] and compare these remission rates
between the two arms at the patient’s 3-month follow-up assessment.
For the patient-outcome, we will refer the early remission rates in the
PRIME Cohort study [58] due to its contextual similarity to our trial and
assume rates of 40 % and 60 % in the control and intervention arm
respectively. With a two-sided α of 0.05, and 80 % power, we will need
97 patients with depression per arm. Therefore, each of the 122 ASHAs
per arm will be required to provide HAP sessions to at least 1 patient,
accounting for dropouts from treatment and loss to follow-up.

2.7. Data management

Participant data and study assessments will be stored in REDCap [59]
with date and timestamps for all data entry, and audit trail for subse-
quent changes. Data from paper/form assessments will be double
entered into REDCap by (at least) two separate research assistants. After
completion of data entry, the paper forms will be stored in a locked
cabinet in a secure research office. Data checks will be performed at
regular intervals throughout the trial period, and queries will be
resolved immediately, while maintaining the audit trail. Intervention
process indicators and fidelity data will be collected on paper and
exported to a spreadsheet. Cost data on expenses incurred by ASHAs
during the remote coaching phase will be collected through Google
survey forms with backend analysis. All quantitative data will be ano-
nymized and linked for analysis only by participants’ study ID. Audio
recordings of coaching calls (used for supervision meetings) will be
stored in a secure, password-protected folder, and a separate file linking
study IDs will be kept password-protected. All data will be maintained
on a secure server at Sangath, India, accessible only to the core research
team. The Sangath servers comply with the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act’s (HIPAA) data security rules, required to
operate the REDCap data management system. All study data will be
de-identified (removed of personal identifiers), including those desig-
nated by HIPAA.

2.8. Statistical analysis

All outcome analyses will be intention-to-treat using imputation of
missing outcome data by an appropriate method [60]. The primary
outcome analysis will estimate the difference in the mean happiness
score between ASHAs randomized to the coaching intervention versus
routine supervision at baseline, and 3 and 6 months thereafter. We will
assess moderation of coaching effect by a priori moderators (e.g., ASHA’s
age, education status and years of community experience) by fitting
appropriate interaction terms and testing for heterogeneity of coaching
effects in regression models. We will also assess the relationships be-
tween ASHA-level affect, self-efficacy and flourishing, and their more
extrinsic outcomes such as authentic happiness, burnout, motivation,
physical symptoms and quality of life, and the relationships between
these extrinsic outcomes and their service delivery measures, patient
satisfaction (of patients receiving depression care) and patient depres-
sion remission rates, by a combination of descriptive analyses, statistical
tests of significance, and mediation analysis using the MacKinnon’s

approach [61]. From a patient outcome standpoint, we will compare the
remission rates on PHQ-9 of patients between the arms at 3 month
follow-up using the test of difference between two independent
proportions.

During analysis of costing of intervention delivery, each item of
expense will be examined as it relates to specific details about costs
related to ASHA’s participation in the workshop/remote coaching. Costs
incurred by ASHAs over and above the monetary allowance provided by
the study team for participation in the intervention workshop will be
documented. Costs of participants’ time will be measured by their
average daily wage. The suite of measures will be based on those used
for economic evaluation of the contextual ‘MANAS’ and ‘PREMIUM’
trials [62,63]. System-level costs required to deliver the workshop and
remote coaching will be based on the World Health Organization (WHO)
framework [64], which describes a health system in terms of six
‘building blocks’ - service delivery, health workforce, health information
systems, essential medicines and technology, financing, and leadership
and governance. The research team will gather cost information ac-
cording to the relevant building blocks for the intervention arm. We will
produce tables to show the total costs of the intervention arm and cost
per participant in the arm (addition of system-level costs and average
participant costs). Individual-level costs will be further broken down
into direct costs (e.g., travel time and expenses) and indirect costs (e.g.,
extra working hours, or any pending health system activity [due to the
participation in the intervention activities] that could have provided an
incentive to the ASHA). System level costs will be broken down into the
relevant building blocks.

2.9. Ethical considerations

Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Sangath, India has approved all
study procedures. Written informed consent will be mandatory for
enrolling ASHAs in this trial. Participation in the study is completely
voluntary and ASHAs can decline participation or withdraw at any time
without any consequence to their current employment as health
workers. Health system officials will have no role in the consent process
to minimize possible influence. Trial research assistants will be given
periodic refresher training to observe their skills in administering con-
sent and providing supportive feedback. Confidentiality of participants
will be protected using unique study ID numbers, and by separating
study data from participant-identifiable data. The research team will
submit study progress reports, including serious adverse event (SAE)
reporting, flow charts, and baseline characteristics of enrolled ASHAs
and patients across the study arms to the IRB on a periodic basis. The
team will maintain a file of all required regulatory documents, study-
specific documents, IRB approval notices, IRB-approved consent docu-
ments, and all correspondence with the IRBs that will be available any
time for study audit.

With respect to the temporary absence of intervention arm ASHAs
from their village-level activities due to the 5-day residential workshop,
we have duly considered the same. We want to highlight that we will
provide 7–10 days for the ASHAs when telephonically inviting them in
advance of their participation in the workshop, which will give them
sufficient time to plan the activities in their village due to their absence.
In addition, we will coordinate with the ASHA supervisor for the same,
so her support is elicited in performing some of the health care duties in
the village as needed. Further, a permission letter from the district-level
Chief Medical and Health Officer (CMHO) will be obtained prior to
inviting ASHAs for the residential workshop.

2.10. Trial management

The Senior Management Team (SMT), consisting of the principal
investigator, co-investigators, and study collaborators, in addition to
research and intervention coordinators, outcome evaluators, and data
manager, will provide overall trial leadership and will meet at least

9 

A.P. Bondre et al.

Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications 42 (2024) 101377 

every 7–14 days to review trial progress, participant recruitment, data
collection, process indicators, and any safety concerns or other issues
that may arise. The team will submit annual reports to the Sangath IRB,
in addition to progress reports to the state health department.

3. Discussion

Our intended impact is to demonstrate improved wellbeing of
frontline health workers by the delivery of a character-strengths based
coaching intervention. The expected study results will position our team
to propose this intervention model to be adopted by wider stakeholders.
Importantly, these stakeholders include key cadres of frontline workers
in India including ASHAs in other districts and states, Auxiliary Nurse
Midwives who are health facility based, Aanganwadi Workers who work
towards improving child nutrition and growth, as well as community
health officers (CHOs) in sub-health centres. There are more than a
million ASHAs in India (one of the largest community health worker
programs in the world [7]) and this study would pave the way for
addressing one of their most pressing challenges i.e., poor mental
wellbeing and burnout. Given the evidence-base, improved wellbeing
can contribute to improved service delivery with a consequent benefit to
patients and communities [65–69]. Therefore, the trial is positioned to
strengthen the overall primary care system by first improving the
wellbeing and reducing burnout among ASHAs with the consequent
improvement in delivery of their frontline services.

From the perspective of challenges at a broader level, we want to
mention that post-pandemic, the government has also introduced
training modules for ASHAs to make them aware of mental health
conditions and coping with mental stress. While the ‘seeding’ of ASHAs
by knowledge of mental health will affect all trial ASHAs, across both
arms, we will consider gathering qualitative data on these aspects
through the course of the trial, particularly during the focus group dis-
cussions (section 2.4.6). Another challenge could be the aspect of so-
cially desirable response patterns
in the answers provided to
psychometric tools, especially given that ASHAs work at the bottom of
system hierarchies. This will be addressed by standardised procedures of
providing instructions to ASHAs during outcome assessment (e.g.,
emphasis on ‘no right and wrong answers’, standard operating proced-
ures for outcome assessors to clarify ASHAs’ queries, and providing a
comfortable environment for outcome assessment).

We will disseminate our trial findings through conference pre-
sentations at leading international scientific meetings, as well as na-
tional meetings in India. From a scalability perspective, towards the end
of the project, we will organize a 2-day Dissemination Workshop with
relevant health system stakeholders and policymakers to share our
findings and increase the uptake of evidence, particularly in the state
government programs focusing on capacity-building, mental health
and/or wellbeing of ASHAs.

4. Conclusion

Data availability

This trial will provide early evidence on the effectiveness of a
character-strengths based coaching intervention to reduce work stress
among rural frontline health workers in India, to inform similar in-
terventions globally, particularly for the rural women cadres. Our study
critically contributes to the broader positive psychology literature on the
use of character-strengths for building capacities among frontline
workers in low-resource settings to address/respond to work-stress.

Data will be made available on request.
