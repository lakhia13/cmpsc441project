Mental health related stigma in Romania: 
systematic review and narrative synthesis
Elena A. Manescu1*, Claire Henderson2,3, Ciprian R. Paroiu1 and Adriana Mihai1 

Abstract 
Background  Stigma related to mental illness is increasingly and more effectively addressed. Although more research 
is being conducted, there is relatively little from low and middle-income countries, with former Soviet bloc countries 
identified as a particular contributor to this evidence gap. Romania struggles with mental health stigma at many 
levels. The aim of this review was to bring together all relevant data regarding stigma and discrimination related 
to mental illness as well as actions to address these problems in Romania in order to prioritise further stigma research 
and identify priority targets for stigma reduction.

Methods  A systematic literature search was conducted in three online databases and grey literature. After the analy-
sis of full manuscripts, four were excluded based on lack of relevance or incomplete data reporting. Quality assess-
ment was performed for included studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) and the narrative was syn-
thesized based on the research questions.

Results  The review included fifteen studies, the majority having a cross-sectional design. Stigma related to mental 
illness in Romania, has an impact on help-seeking attitudes and behaviours, workplace environment and social rela-
tionships of people with mental health problems. Negative stereotypes are maintained and validated by mass media 
reports. Significant stigma in healthcare and mental care settings has also been observed. Self-stigma was less fre-
quently reported than public stigma. Despite a few stigma reduction actions, no rigorous evaluation of content, 
delivery and effectiveness has been conducted and no empirical evidence has been published.

Conclusions  Based on this review, three lines of action are recommended in Romania. Increase research concern-
ing stigma in healthcare and mental care settings and use behavioural outcomes. Develop and deliver evidence-
based tailored interventions to reduce stigma in identified priority subgroups of the population and ensure rigorous 
evaluation and scientific dissemination. Elaborate guidelines for working with community stigma and advocate 
for structural changes.

Background
Winkler et al. [1] drew attention to what they described 
as a blind spot on the global mental health map in 2017, 
referring to countries in central and Eastern Europe. One 
of their findings was that stigma appears to be higher than 
in other European countries. In general, greater recogni-
tion of stigma related to mental illness has been observed 
in  recent  years  along  with  more  effort  being  made  to 
reduce it [2]. Researchers have reported several negative 
effects of stigma such as reluctance to seek help, engage 
in and maintain treatment [3], and an overall increase in 
co-morbidity  and  mortality  [4,  5];  fewer  opportunities 
for school, work or social interactions or trouble obtain-
ing  accommodation  [6,  7].  In  response  to  these  con-
cerns,  the  World  Health  Organization  and  many  other 
international  alliances  have  highlighted  the  importance 
of  reducing  both  public  and  structural  stigma  through 
anti-stigma interventions and advocacy for policy change 
[2,  8].  National  anti-stigma  campaigns  or  smaller-scale 
interventions focused on several target groups have been 
conducted  mainly  in  developed  high-income  countries 
while  there  is  less  evidence  coming  from  low  and  mid-
dle  income  countries  (LMICs)  [2,  9,  10].  These  findings 
suggest  a  clear  and  strong  need  for  a  coordinated  effort 
to  conduct  more  high-quality  research,  particularly  in 
LMICs  in  order  to  provide  further  evidence  to  support 
policy  decisions  [2]  In  the  context  of  local  evidence  on 
stigma, it is important for central and eastern European 
countries, and in particular for Romania, to consider the 
recommendations of the experts’ commission on ending 
stigma and discrimination in mental health [2].

The  transition  from  the  communist  regime  that 
embraced  central  and  Eastern  Europe  at  the  begin-
ning  of  the  nineties  has  found  Romania  not  opti-
mally  adjusted  to  the  new  democracy.  This  fact  is  also 
reflected in the evolution and development of the men-
tal health system. Although constrained to adapt to the 
European  standards  since  2007,  the  legislation  regard-
ing mental health in Romania was in fact modified and 
updated  more  in  theory  and  less  in  practice.  Exam-
ples  are  numerous  but  some  deserve  special  attention 
being  related  to  the  problem  discussed  here.  Struc-
tural  stigma  in  the  Romanian  mental  healthcare  sys-
tem comes from many levels. For instance, the national 
mental  health  legislation  stipulates  a  general  deinsti-
tutionalization  of  the  psychiatric  service  and  a  greater 
focus on the community level [11]. The number of beds 
in  psychiatric  hospitals  has  been  cut  progressively  in 
the  last  years  but  without  an  accompanying  develop-
ment  of  community  services  [1,  10].  In  fact,  Romania 
has been criticized for the alarming underdevelopment 
in this area compared to other eastern European coun-
tries [1, 10]. Community services are currently available 

in a few regions of the country and even fewer centres 
are efficiently communicating with other mental health 
organizations,  resulting  in  discrimination  against  peo-
ple with mental illness in relation to access to care.

Another stigma-generating context is represented by 
the  low  level  of  implementation  of  liaison  psychiatry 
into the National Healthcare System. Despite being one 
of  the  first  countries  of  the  former  communist  block 
to  create  and  implement  such  a  department  in  a  gen-
eral  hospital  in  1995  [12],  the  further  development  of 
this subspecialty did not take place as expected due to 
poor  allocation  of  funds  and  a  general  lack  of  coordi-
nation  between  parties  involved  in  the  decision-mak-
ing.  The  Romanian  National  Mental  Health  Reform 
Act  [11]  provides  for  the  establishment  of  liaison  psy-
chiatry  departments  since  2002.  Still,  only  small  steps 
have  been  taken  to  include  psychiatric  beds  in  general 
hospitals especially in small towns, the initiative being 
progressively  abandoned.  Under  these  circumstances, 
the  quality  of  treatment  for  people  with  psychiatric 
related  problems  can  be  significantly  affected.  On  the 
other  hand,  psychiatric  patients  are  often  discrimi-
nated  against  by  other  health  specialists  who  neglect 
their medical responsibilities towards these patients by 
avoiding professional contact with them.All these reali-
ties of the Romanian health system suggest a significant 
level of both structural and public stigma insufficiently 
addressed by policy and executive changes.

There  have  been  a  few  uncoordinated  anti-stigma 
actions  mainly  supported  by  international  sources, 
with  reduced  activity  in  recent  years,  similar  to  other 
initiatives recommended by the national mental health 
reform [11].

Before  these  problems  can  be  tackled,  we  need  to 
have  a  clear  and  detailed  image  of  the  stigma-related 
background in Romania. To the best of our knowledge, 
there  has  been  published  no  review  work  that  com-
prehensively  summarizes  the  current  evidence  regard-
ing  stigma  related  to  mental  illness  in  Romania.  To 
address  this  gap,  we  conducted  a  systematic  review  of 
the  stigma  research  related  to  Romania  and  provide  a 
conceptual  overview  of  the  evidence  for  the  develop-
ment  of  a  future  intervention  targeting  mental  health 
professionals. The paper highlights the most important 
results  by  addressing  the  following  questions:  “How 
has  mental  illness  stigma  in  Romania  been  studied?”, 
“What  are  the  socio-demographic  factors  associated 
with  mental  health  stigma?”,  “What  differences  does 
comparative  research  on  stigma  including  Romania 
suggest??”  and  “What  interventions  have  been  used 
to  reduce  mental  health-related  stigma  in  Romania?”. 
Based  on  the  evidence,  we  draw  recommendations  for 
research, policy and practice.

Methods
The  review  was  conducted  according  to  the  Preferred 
Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta-
Analyses  (PRISMA)  checklist  recommended  for  sys-
tematic  reviews  [13],  as  outlined  in  Additional  file  1. 
The No ethical approval was sought for this study as it 
involved analysis of previously published report.

A  scoping  search  of  the  literature  was  performed 
to  get  on  overview  of  the  existing  research  on  mental 
health  related  stigma  in  Romania. Three  databases  were 
searched,  Web  of  Science,  Google  Scholar  and  MED-
LINE,  from  their  start  date  to  the  search  date  (March 
2021). The results were a small number of studies mostly 
covering  manifestations  of  stigma  in  specific  supgroups 
of the general population and some targeting anticipated 
or  perceived/experienced  stigma  and  discrimination. 
Beyond  the  overall  scarcity  of  data,  already  reported  in 
a recent scoping review [1], there was a gap of evidence 
regarding  stigma  reduction  interventions  and  stigma  in 
healthcare  and  mental  healthcare  settings.  No  review  of 
the literature was found on the searched topic.

Information sources

Three different scientific databases: Scopus, Web of Sci-
ence and MEDLINE, were searched from their start date 
to  the  search  date   (20th  October  2021  and  updated  in 
 12th  September  2022)  for  articles  in  English  and  Roma-
nian language. An additional Google Scholar search was 
made  to  identify  relevant  grey  literature.  Grey  literature 
was  also  searched  from  OpenGrey  database  and  via  the 
Entireweb metasearch engine for other potential sources, 
including  technical  or  research  reports  from  govern-
ment  agencies,  reports  from  scientific  research  groups, 
doctoral dissertations and conference abstracts. We also 
conducted searches of key authors’ article lists and used 
Google  Scholar  to  find  studies  listed  by  the  author  but 
not  identified  in  the  database  search.  References  in  rel-
evant  articles  were  screened  for  publications  that  might 
be acceptable for inclusion. We consulted mental health 
stigma experts in Romania for the potential inclusion of 
other  articles.  The  search  terms  were  kept  wide  and  no 
restrictions were applied for publication type.

Search strategy (Additional file 2)

A  search  strategy  was  created  based  on  the  preliminary 
exploration  and  after  consulting  a  specialist.  (for  full 
database  search  strategies,  please  check  the  Additional 
file 2).

Two  sets  of  terms  were  used  in  the  search:  stigma 
terms  (“stigma”,  “discriminat$”,  “stereotyp$”,  “attitud$”, 
“social behavio$”) and mental disorder terms (“mental ill-
ness$”, “mental disorder$”, “schizophrenia”, “depression”). 
In  addition,  Medical  Subject  Headings  (MeSH)  terms, 

keywords, and their synonyms were used to develop the 
search  strategy  for  PubMed  and  adapted  for  the  other 
databases  (Additional  file  2).  Following  the  literature 
search, the references were exported to an EndNote data-
base and the duplicates removed.

The following search strategy was used:
((‘Stigma  terms’  tw  AND  ‘mental  disorder  terms’  tw) 
OR  (stigma  MESH  terms  AND  mental  disorder  MESH 
terms) AND Romania).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Search  strategy  and  selection  of  articles  was  based  on 
the  SPIDER  (Sample,  Phenomenon  of  interest,  Design, 
Evaluation,  Research  type)  framework,  chosen  because 
of  its  suitable  application  to  qualitative  and  mixed 
methods  research  [14].  We  included  articles  targeting 
the  Romanian  general  population  or  subgroups,  men-
tal  health  service  users  and  mental  health  profession-
als.  Studies  that  included  a  broader  study  sample  (e.g. 
international  multicentre  studies)  were  included  if  the 
results  for  Romanian  sample  were  reported  separately 
or  can  be  distinguished  in  the  results.  Included  studies 
explored  any  form  of  anticipated,  perceived  or  experi-
enced stigma in relation to mental illness (e.g. knowledge, 
attitudes,  behaviours)  identified  as  a  research  question 
or  aim,  key  theme  or  major  finding  in  the  results.  Any 
study  design  was  allowed,  including  descriptive  reports 
and qualitative research based on focus groups and inter-
views. Outcomes relate to stigma in terms of knowledge, 
beliefs,  attitudes  and  behaviours  by  either  a  quantitative 
or a qualitative method and can include other associated 
factor  as  secondary  outcomes.  As  for  research  type,  the 
review  covered  peer-reviewed  studies  published  in  Eng-
lish  or  Romanian  language  prior  to  September  2022  as 
follows:  (i)  quantitative  studies,  (ii)  qualitative  studies 
that used appropriate methods of data collection and (iii) 
mixed  methods  –  studies  combining  both  methods  of 
data  collection.  Review  articles,  thesis  and  dissertations 
were also included, while articles not published in a peer 
reviewed  journal  or  English  and  Romanian  language, 
were  excluded.  Studies  with  outcome  measures  outside 
the  common  conceptualization  of  stigma  were  excluded 
as well as incomplete studies such as protocols.

Study selection

The  search  was  conducted  by  the  first  author  (EM) 
across  all  databases  and  an  initial  screening  was  inde-
pendently conducted by two authors (EM and CP) using 
the  PRISMA  Flowchart  (Fig.  1).  Each  of  the  reviewers 
removed  the  duplicates  in  the  initial  screening  process 
and  potentially  relevant  full-text  articles  were  obtained. 
The  authors  reviewed  all  studies  based  on  the  eligibil-
ity  criteria,  by  reading  all  titles,  followed  by  selected 

 Manescu et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:662

abstracts,  full  texts  and  references.  In  the  occurrence  of 
uncertainty whether an article met inclusion criteria, the 
first  author  consulted  the  senior  authors.  All  disagree-
ments  were  resolved  by  discussion  and  consensus  with 
the senior reviewers CH and AM.

Risk of bias and quality assessment

Assessment  of  bias  and  quality  was  done  indepen-
dently  by  two  authors  (EM  and  CP)  and  discussed  until 
agreement  was  reached.  We  used  the  Mixed  Methods 
Appraisal  Tool  (MMAT),  version  2018  [15].  MMAT 
assesses  the  methodological  quality  of  quantitative, 
qualitative and mixed methods studies, making it a suit-
able quality assessment tool for systematic mixed studies 
reviews as ours. The checklist covers seven quality crite-
ria for each methodological design. The authors advise on 
reporting a descriptive summary of quality ratings rather 
than a scoring and elimination based on low quality rat-
ing is discouraged. As our rationale was to cover all of the 
literature relevant to this review and because of the small 

number  of  studies  found,  those  relevant  studies  which 
did not meet all the seven criteria were not excluded.

Data extraction and narrative synthesis

Results of the full text selection were shared with all the 
authors to validate their eligibility, before data extraction. 
The framework for data extraction included the following 
study  characteristics:  general  information  (authors  and 
year of publication, study title and design), study popula-
tion (sample size, target population), outcome measures 
corresponding  to  knowledge,  attitudes,  inteded  behav-
iour components, anticipated, perceived and experienced 
stigma  and  discrimination,  structural  stigma  (narrative 
descriptions  or  any  other  form),  anti-stigma  interven-
tions (type, primary and secondary outcomes,duration of 
follow-up and evidence for effective interventions). Qual-
itative  narratives  and  recommendations  were  collected 
from both qualitative and quantitative studies. After data 
extraction,  the  narrative  synthesis  was  conducted  based 
on the research questions and adapted from the guideline 

Manescu et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:662

proposed by Popay et al. [16]. This guideline recommend 
four main elements: developing a theory on the concepts 
on  which  the  research  question  is  based;  developing  a 
preliminary  synthesis  of  findings  of  included  studies; 
exploring  relationships  in  the  data;  and  assessing  the 
robustness  of  the  synthesis.  Extracted  data  was  summa-
rized  using  the  tabular  form  of  the  Cochrane  review’s 
[17] ‘Characteristics of Included Studies’ table (methods, 
participants,  intervention,  outcomes,  notes).  Research 
papers were imported into NVIVO 12 for narrative syn-
thesis and coding was carried out of the included papers. 
Initial  codes  were  generated  by  inductive  reasoning 
from the material and these were then clustered to form 
themes.

Results
Characteristics of the studies

A  total  of  nineteen  papers  were  identified  in  the  search 
and after initial screening, four were excluded: one study 
was a proposed protocol for an anti-stigma intervention 
[18];  one  studied  public  beliefs  of  social  versus  medi-
cal  etiology  of  mental  illness  [19]  and  was  excluded  as 
although  etiological  beliefs  can  influence  stigma  it  was 
not a study of stigma as such; and the other two [20, 21] 
papers were part of a larger study included in the current 
review.

Most  of  the  included  studies  (86%)  were  cross-sec-
tional,  either  part  of  an  international  analysis  of  stigma 
associated  with  mental  illness  in  several  countries  or 
national initiatives. Data reported on stigma comes from 
the  general  population  and  from  mental  health  service 
users.  Seven  studies  evaluated  stigma  in  specific  sub-
groups of the general population such as teenagers [22], 
medical  and  other  college  students  [23–26]  and  health-
care professionals [27, 28]. Two studies used a represent-
ative sample of the general population aged 18 and over 
[29,  30].  The  national  research  study  [29]  was  based  on 
a  probabilistic,  stratified  national  sample  that  included 
1070  persons  from  67  Romanian  cities  and  communes, 
including  Bucharest.  The  sample  consisted  of  44% 
respondents  from  rural  areas  and  56%  urban  respond-
ents  (11%  from  small  towns,  12%  from  medium-sized 
towns and 32% from cities). The survey included in addi-
tion a group of 98 mental health experts. Qualitative data 
comes from interviews and focus groups carried out with 
mental health professionals, service users and the general 
population.

Four  other  studies  reported  the  experience  of  men-
tal  health  service  users  in  terms  of  anticipated  or  expe-
rienced  discrimination  and  self-stigma  [31–34]  and  one 
looked  at  factors  associated  with  delays  in  seeking  pro-
fessional  help  [35].  One  study  described  anti-stigma 

interventions  [36].  Most  of  the  included  studies  were 
published more than ten years ago.

Quality assessment

All  fifteen  studies  were  analysed  based  on  the  seven 
methodological  quality  criteria.  The  majority  of  the 
studies  (86%)  were  quantitative  descriptive  (e.g.  cross-
sectional  study,  survey)  in  nature  [22–28,  30–35].  One 
study  used  a  mixed  methods  design  and  one  study  was 
a  qualitative  research.  The  studies  met  the  seven  qual-
ity  criteria  in  general.  The  main  shortcoming  was  that 
of  non-reporting  the  response  rate;  60%  of  the  included 
studies  did  not  report  the  response  rate  of  the  partici-
pants. For more information, see Additional file 3.

How has mental illness stigma in Romania been studied?

Included studies evaluated stigma in its public and inter-
nalized  aspects.  Public  stigma  was  reported  in  terms  of 
attitudes towards people with mental illness and towards 
help-seeking.  As  stigma  can  be  considered  one  aspect 
of  mental  health  literacy  (MHL)  [37],  results  related 
to  MHL  will  be  presented  in  this  section  The  patients’ 
perspective  was  reported  as  perceived,  anticipated,  and 
experienced  stigma  and  discrimination  and  self-stigma. 
Structural  stigma  was  reported  as  mental  health  profes-
sionals’ opinion.

Mental health literacy

Three  studies  evaluated  mental  health  literacy  either  in 
specific  subgroups  of  the  population  such  as  students 
[22, 24] or in the general population as is the case with 
the  national  community  survey  [29].  All  the  studies 
used  a  case  vignette  model  with  comparable  accompa-
nying  questions  about  recognition,  etiology  and  man-
agement  of  mental  illness,  extracted  from  international 
referential research (see Table 1). Students in tenth grade 
[22]  scored  low  in  MHL;  only  a  few  correctly  identi-
fied  the  case  vignette  depicting  schizophrenia  (17.7%), 
while more than half considered it to be a psychological 
problem  (51.7%)  rather  than  a  medical  and  psychologi-
cal  problem  (39.2%).  College  students  were  compared 
based  on  their  nationality  as  either  Romanian  students 
or  other  nationality  students  [24].  The  majority  of  stu-
dents in both subgroups recognized the vignette depict-
ing  schizophrenia  as  being  a  mental  illness  but  almost 
half (46.6%) of the Romanian students did not recognize 
depression  as  such  and  almost  a  quarter  (23.3%)  of  all 
students  did  not  consider  alcohol  dependence  as  being 
a mental illness. Similar results are reported in the com-
munity: almost half of the participants did not consider 
depression  (49.8%)  and  alcohol  dependence  (49.6%)  as 
being  a  mental  illness  while  schizophrenia  was  recog-
nized as such by most of participants (74.6%) [29]. Lack

of knowledge regarding mental illness is greater however 
in  those  with  low  educational  level  and  elderly  people, 
especially in rural areas [29].

Public beliefs about people with mental illness

Most  of  the  studies  assessing  public  attitudes  towards 
people  with  mental  illness  in  Romania  are  limited  to 
specific  subgroups  of  the  population  and  small  samples. 
However,  there  are  two  reports  based  on  representative 
samples:  an  European  and  a  national  survey  of  commu-
nity attitudes towards people with mental illness [29, 30].
According to the European survey, the Romanian pop-
ulation  held  stigmatizing  attitudes  about  people  with 
mental  illness  at  a  slightly  higher  percentage  compared 
to  the  European  average  [30].  Unpredictability  and  dan-
gerousness  stereotypes  were  the  most  common,  being 
held by 65%, respectively 45% of the population, while a 
smaller  percentage  believed  people  with  mental  illness 
never  recover  (20%)  and  are  to  blame  for  their  illness 
(14%) [30].

The national community research showed that the per-
ceived  likelihood  of  violence  varied  with  the  disorder, 
being  highest  for  alcohol  addiction  followed  by  schizo-
phrenia  [29].  A  similar  pattern  is  observed  also  for  the 
desire  for  social  distance.  Whereas  the  person  present-
ing  depression  in  the  vignette  was  accepted,  as  being 
considered  in  need  of  help,  people  presenting  alcohol 
addiction and schizophrenia in the vignettes were rather 
rejected being considered dangerous [29]. Using the Per-
ceived  Devaluation-Discrimination  (PDD)  scale,  which 
asks about the general/community perception, the same 
study reports strong negative attitudes of discrimination 
towards people with mental illness in all life areas, espe-
cially in the labor and marital market. Almost two-thirds 
of the population share the view that most people do not 
respect,  take  seriously  or  trust  a  person  who  has  been 
admitted to a psychiatric hospital [29]. Half consider that 
most  people  view  admission  to  the  psychiatric  hospital 
as a personal failure; believe these persons are less intel-
ligent and would not accept such persons as their friends 
[29].  The  results  from  these  two  representative  studies 
described above are in part replicated in other four stud-
ies on specific samples such as teenagers [22] and college 
students [23–25]. Adolescents as well as students believe 
most  people  stigmatize  individuals  with  mental  illness. 
Furthermore,  they  marginally  endorsed  stereotypes  of 
dangerousness  and  responsibility.  Attitudes  of  preju-
dice  and  discrimination  towards  the  psychiatric  patient 
were  observed  also  in  healthcare  professionals  [27–29]. 
The  majority  of  medical  doctors  interviewed  in  a  study 
and  more  than  half  (52%)  in  another  study,  agreed  they 
feel  uncomfortable  with  the  psychiatric  patient  [27,  28]. 
Similar findings are reported by a qualitative research on 

a  representative  sample  of  98  mental  health  profession-
als  who  stated  that  healthcare  specialists  avoid  coming 
in contact with the psychiatric patient leading to neglect 
and discrimination [29].

Attitudes towards help‑seeking

Attitudes  toward  help-seeking  were  examined  in  three 
studies  including  a  representative  sample  of  the  gen-
eral population aged 18 and over [29], a sample of high-
school students [22], and a sample of university students 
[26].  The  general  population  is  inclined  towards  non-
professional  help,  especially  discussing  with  family  and 
friends,  when  dealing  with  a  mental  health  problem. 
Consulting  a  psychologist,  social  worker  or  priest  is 
preferred  over  medical  treatment  and  admission  into  a 
psychiatric facility. It is not preferred however, over con-
sulting  a  general  practitioner.  Consulting  a  psychiatrist, 
taking medication and admission into a psychiatric hos-
pital,  are  considered  more  appropriate  in  a  significantly 
greater  extent  for  the  vignette  describing  schizophrenia 
compared to those describing major depressive disorder 
and  alcohol  dependence  [29].  High-school  students  are 
willing to seek help in the form of family care, psycholog-
ical treatment and folk medicine. They are not willing to 
seek  professional  treatment.  Higher  rates  of  willingness 
to seek help in any form were associated with endorsing 
the responsibility stereotype (individuals are responsible 
for  their  mental  illnesses)  [22].  Public  and  self-stigma 
were  associated  with  more  negative  attitudes  towards 
help-seeking in a sample of Romanian university students 
[26]. The most important factors influencing the delay in 
accessing mental health services were public stigma and 
lack of knowledge regarding mental health and available 
treatments [35].

Perceived, anticipated and experienced stigma 
and discrimination, and self‑stigma

Four  studies  report  outcomes  on  patients’  perception 
of stigma and discrimination [31–34] Discrimination in 
the workplace was anticipated or experienced by more 
than  half  of  one  study  sample  with  major  depression 
[32]  and  almost  60%  of  them  had  stopped  themselves 
from  applying  for  work,  education  or  training  because 
of anticipated discrimination. A third of mental health 
service  users  reported  moderate  to  high  levels  of  self-
stigma and two-thirds perceived moderate to high lev-
els of public stigma towards patients with mental illness 
[34].  Patients  with  a  first  episode  of  major  depression 
reported discrimination to a greater extent and in more 
life areas than patients with a first episode of psychosis 
[33]. Patients with depression reported more discrimi-
nation  regarding  education,  marriage,  religious  activi-
ties,  neighbours  and  acting  as  a  parent  while  patients 

Manescu et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:662 

Page 15 of 21

with  psychosis  reported  more  discrimination  with 
regard to the police. Lower rates of self-stigma and per-
ceived discrimination were associated with less stigma-
tizing public attitudes, higher rates of help-seeking and 
better perceived access to information [31].

Structural stigma

No study explicitly assessed manifestations of structural 
stigma [55]. However, the opinion of mental health spe-
cialists about the stigma associated with the healthcare 
system in Romania clearly identified stigma at this level 
[29,  36].  They  described  lack  of  funds  and  poor  man-
agement  of  existing  resources,  inefficient  coordination 
between  institutions  of  the  mental  healthcare  system 
and underdevelopment of community services [29, 36]. 
According  to  the  majority  of  mental  health  specialists 
consulted in the study, there are a few weak spots in the 
healthcare system in Romania leading to stigmatization 
and discrimination of patients with mental illness. Pre-
vention is considered to be a major problem of the sys-
tem. This aspect is almost completely neglected on the 
path  to  care  followed  by  a  person  with  mental  health 
problems [29]. In consequence, patients usually present 
to the doctor when the disorder is severe and recovery 
is  difficult.  The  mental  health  community  network  is 
another weak spot mentioned. The community network 
is severely underdeveloped in Romania with an impact 
on the quality of care. Due to a lack or insufficiency of 
community  resources,  the  follow-up  of  patients  is  dif-
ficult, and not much is done for integrating them back 
into the community [29, 36].

Socio‑demographic and other factors associated 
with mental health related stigma in Romania

Stigma has been conceptualised as one aspect of men-
tal health literacy as defined by Kutcher et al. [37]. Low 
mental  health  literacy  was  associated  with  low  educa-
tional  level  and  age  group  50–59  years  [29].  Perceived 
risk  of  violence,  and  higher  perceived  devaluation  but 
not  discrimination  are  greater  in  people  with  high 
media consumption [29]. Perceived discrimination and 
devaluation are reported to be higher in low socio-cul-
tural  settings  and  higher  discrimination  was  reported 
in  Dobrogea,  Banat,  and  Oltenia  regions  and  lower  in 
Muntenia, Maramures and Moldova regions [29]. Expe-
rienced  workplace  discrimination  was  independently 
positively  associated  with  unemployment  [32].  Being 
employed and having a university educational degree as 
well as having proper social support were considered to 
be  protective  factors  because  of  their  association  with 
less self-stigma [32, 34].

What differences does comparative research on stigma 
including Romania suggest?

The  Romanian  population  has  comparable  knowledge 
about  mental  illness  to  the  American  population  [29, 
56]  and  a  similar  pattern  of  preferences  regarding  treat-
ment, with both countries opting rather for non-biolog-
ical,  non-specialized  treatment.  Perceived  public  stigma 
and  discrimination  against  people  with  mental  illness 
are significantly more severe and cover more life areas in 
Romania compared to other regions in Germany, Slova-
kia, and Russia [29, 57]. Results from a study conducted 
in six European countries showed that self-stigma is less 
frequent  in  Romanian  population  compared  to  Croa-
tia,  Malta,  and  Lithuania  but  more  frequent  than  in  the 
Swedish  population  [34].  Similarly,  perceived  public 
stigma was reported to be less frequent in Romania com-
pared to the other European countries in the study [34]. 
The  same  study  showed  an  inverse  association  between 
perceived public stigma and self-stigma in the Romanian 
population  compared  to  other  countries  in  the  study, 
which  showed  either  a  positive  correlation  or  no  cor-
relation.  Self-efficacy/self-esteem  was  not  a  predictor 
of  self-stigma  in  Romania  compared  to  Sweden,  Croa-
tia,  and  Lithuania  [34].  The  association  between  public 
stigma and self-stigma in Romania was weaker than the 
average  of  other  countries  such  as  the  USA,  Australia, 
Canada  and  the  United  Arab  Emirates  [26].  Romanian 
mental health service users diagnosed with a first episode 
of mental illness reported less perceived and experienced 
stigma compared to their correspondents in Poland and 
Sweden [33].

Interventions targeting mental health stigma conducted 
in Romania

One  national  campaign,  locally  coordinated,  was  con-
ducted  in  the  major  regions  of  the  country  immediately 
after  Romania  joined  the  EU  but  shortly  ceased  due  to 
a  lack  of  funds  and  personnel.  There  are  no  follow-up 
results published regarding the effectiveness of this cam-
paign, but a descriptive paper summarized the campaign 
using experts’ opinions [36].

The campaign took place between 2007 and 2008 in dif-
ferent regions of the country through local mental health 
centres and included four major projects: ‘Mental health 
caravan’,  ‘Schizophrenia  should  not  be  a  reason  for  dis-
crimination’,  ‘Trust  my  mind!  Stop  the  prejudice  against 
mental illness’ and ‘Confide in their mind’.

The  ‘Mental  health  caravan’  project  aimed  to  inform 
and  educate  the  general  population  through  presenta-
tions,  distribution  of  informative  educational  materials 
and  a  local  radio  campaign  targeting  stigma  associated 
with mental illness.

‘Schizophrenia  should  not  be  a  reason  for  discrimina-
tion’  project  was  carried  out  in  four  high  schools  in  the 
capital  city  with  the  direct  involvement  of  the  students. 
The project’s aim was to increase students’ awareness of 
mental health issues, allowing them to better understand 
the difficulties people with mental illness have to face.

The project ‘Trust my mind! Stop the prejudice against 
mental  illness’  focused  on  the  qualities  of  people  with 
mental illness and their right to work. Activities included 
poster  making,  organizing  opinion  polls  and  confer-
ences and launching a volume of poetry written by a per-
son  with  mental  illness.  The  campaign  was  popularized 
through mass media.

‘Confide  in  their  mind’  was  carried  out  in  six  major 
cities  of  Romania  and  involved  the  press  as  well  as  the 
general  population.  Presentations  focused  on  the  need 
to  form  a  correct  image  of  people  with  mental  health 
problems.

Discussion
This  work  provides  a  comprehensive  report  on  stigma 
related to mental illness in an eastern European context 
and discusses the most relevant evidence for future anti-
stigma  interventions.  We  identified  a  particularly  small 
number of studies (N = 15) relevant to the stigma depic-
tion in Romanian population, in line with the findings of 
Winkler et al.[1]. Moreover, most of them were published 
more than ten years ago, drawing attention to a pressing 
need  to  refresh  and  increase  the  current  evidence.  The 
lack  of  behavioural  outcomes  and  that  of  objective  evi-
dence  for  the  delivery  and  effectiveness  of  anti-stigma 
interventions are also critical findings to be addressed. A 
recent review of stigma in LMICs raised similar points as 
a priority for future research [58].

In  Romania,  stigma  is  present  to  a  significant  extent 
at  all  levels.  Structural  stigma  as  well  as  public  stigma 
affects  people  with  mental  illness  on  a  regular  basis 
leading  to  negative  attitudes  towards  help-seeking  and 
delayed  access  to  mental  health  services.  A  particularly 
harmful negative stereotype held frequently against peo-
ple with mental illness in Romania is that they are unpre-
dictable  and  dangerous  [29–31].  Moreover,  perceived 
likelihood  of  violence  was  associated  with  high  media 
consumption  [29]  suggesting  an  important  role  of  mass 
media  in  shaping  the  picture  of  the  mentally  ill  patient. 
Studies have consistently confirmed that both entertain-
ment  and  news  media  depict  remarkably  dramatic  and 
distorted images of mental illness that emphasize unpre-
dictability,  dangerousness,  and  criminality  [59–61].  The 
impact  on  individuals  with  mental  illness  is  detrimental 
contributing  to  low  self-esteem,  experienced  discrimi-
nation and unwillingness to seek help [62]. On the other 
hand, there is evidence that media can be used effectively 

in challenging public stereotypes and discrimination and 
advocating  for  a  positive  image  of  people  with  mental 
health problems [63]. Social media channels and tools are 
increasingly  used  in  anti-stigma  interventions  to  influ-
ence public attitudes towards people with mental illness 
[64].  Offering  a  space  to  share  a  personal  unheard  story 
with many people, beyond the limitations of face-to-face 
interactions,  can  create  a  sense  of  empowerment  and 
solidarity. Social media channels can also enhance com-
munication and learning between professionals as well as 
service users [64]. Results for effective anti-stigma inter-
ventions  focused  on  mass  media  include  contact-based 
educational  methods  targeted  to  journalists  and  imple-
mentation  of  mental  health  educational  modules  in  the 
training of media workers [65].

Interestingly,  perceived  public  stigma  was  present  in 
a  higher  proportion  than  self-stigma  in  persons  with 
mental  illness  [31–34].  However,  their  relationship  and 
the  impact  on  help-seeking  behaviour  generated  mixed 
results.  Help-seeking  attitudes  and  behaviours  in  the 
Romanian  population  seem  to  be  influenced  mainly  by 
public stigma [33] while its relationship with self-stigma 
was weaker compared to other cultural settings [26, 34]. 
The  internalization  of  public  stigma  into  self-stigma 
seems  to  be  less  pronounced  in  Romanians  suggesting 
that  other  factors  may  interact  in  the  development  of 
self-stigma. Compared to other European countries, self-
efficacy and self-esteem were not significant predictors of 
self-stigma in the Romanian population [34]. The hypoth-
esis that low self-efficacy and self-esteem are components 
or consequences of self-stigma [66, 67] is not supported 
by the evidence presented in the current review. Overall, 
the results suggest that self-stigma may be more context-
dependent  than  person-dependent.  The  sociocultural 
setting could affect differently how individuals apply the 
publicly held messages to themselves. Further research is 
needed to investigate in more detail what and how socio-
cultural factors influence mental health stigma in Roma-
nia and carefully addressed them in mental health policy 
formulation  and  anti-stigma  interventional  programs. 
Another important finding of current work is that proper 
social  support  may  play  a  protective  role  against  self-
stigma  [34].  Along  with  other  evidence  [68]  to  support 
our  findings,  these  results  highlight  the  important  role 
played by peer support in enhancing empowerment and 
decreasing self-stigma and underline its potential useful-
ness in interventional programmes.

While  self-stigma  was  less  present  in  the  Romanian 
psychiatric  population  than  perceived  stigma  and  dis-
crimination  [34],  its  impact  in  the  work  setting  has 
proved  to  be  important  [32].  Other  major  studies  [66, 
69]  had  similar  results,  implying  a  worldwide  con-
cern  and  a  clear  need  to  consider  work-related  stigma 

Manescu et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:662 

Page 17 of 21

and  discrimination  a  priority  for  future  research  and 
intervention.  Besides  targeting  public  stigma  particu-
larly  in  employers,  the  results  of  our  review  suggest  an 
intervention  should  also  focus  on  the  self-stigma  of  the 
employees.

Further, anticipated discrimination was not only more 
frequently  reported  than  experienced  discrimination  in 
the  workplace  but  other  studies  have  proved  that  they 
many  not  necessarily  be  associated  [70,  71].  Our  results 
indicated  other  factors  may  be  involved  as  anticipated 
discrimination  was  associated  with  self-stigma  and  led 
to  avoiding  behaviour  such  as  reluctance  to  apply  for 
work  or  education  [32].  Corrigan  explains  the  dynam-
ics  between  self-stigma,  anticipated  discrimination  and 
avoidance behaviour with a phenomenon called the “why 
try”  effect  [72].  The  phenomenon  describes  a  tendency 
that  appeared  in  those  with  self-stigma  and  anticipated 
discrimination to avoid high-risk situations. On the other 
hand, studies on employers have indicated that they dis-
play indeed a marked tendency to have negative attitudes 
towards  people  with  mental  health  problems  [73–75]. 
Although improvements in employers’ awareness, knowl-
edge,  and  attitudes  are  reported  in  places  where  coor-
dinated  anti-stigma  actions  were  conducted,  especially 
in  high-income  countries  [76–78],  workplace  stigma 
remains a present concern, significantly affecting people 
with mental illness, particularly in LMICs.

Our  findings  along  with  others  have  indicated  that  an 
alarming  level  of  stigma  is  also  present  in  healthcare  or 
mental  healthcare  professionals  [79–82].  Despite  of  evi-
dent  superior  knowledge  of  mental  illness  in  mental 
health  professionals  compared  to  other  health  special-
ist, they are nevertheless predisposed to negative cultural 
stereotypes. Studies have shown that up to 50% of mental 
health  service  users  reported  discriminatory  behaviours 
in  mental  health  specialists  [80–82].  The  overwhelm-
ing  evidence  highlights  the  imperative  need  to  consider 
mental  health  professionals  as  a  priority  target  for  anti-
stigma  interventions.  A  few  anti-stigma  actions  have 
been conducted in the last fifteen years in Romania with 
international  support  and  being  locally  coordinated  in 
the  absence  of  a  common  conceptual  framework.  The 
only  available  data  regarding  these  interventions  consist 
of  a  mental  health  expert’s  description  of  these  projects 
[36]. The findings underline two main problems: the lack 
of a conceptual framework for working with community 
stigma and a very low rate of publication. Both problems 
can  be  seen  as  consequences  of  structural  stigma  and 
may  be  attributed,  at  least  in  part,  to  poor  allocation  of 
funds  to  mental  health  compared  to  other  medical  spe-
cialities.  Implications  are  numerous,  leading  to  uncoor-
dinated,  uncommunicated  and  one-time  actions  with 
low potential long-term effectiveness. All these translate 

into more stigma and discrimination towards people with 
mental illness.

Strengths and limitations

An important limitation of the current study is the exclu-
sive focus on the local context of Romania thus the rec-
ommendations  may  be  less  generalizable  elsewhere. 
Another is the small amount of evidence to review with 
an  overall  qood  quality  of  reporting.  Important  aspects 
to  be  improved  in  order  to  increase  quality  in  future 
research concerns especially setting,sample and response 
rate  reports.  A  further  limitation  is  the  relative  small 
number  of  databases  searched.  We  cannot  rule  out  the 
possibility  that  some  potentially  relevant  papers  might 
have been missed. However, as there was a considerable 
overlap between the search results of the three databases, 
it  is  unlikely  that  this  is  a  significant  problem.  Moreo-
ver, our search results are in line with those reported by 
other seminal research, indicating a scarcity of empirical 
evidence  regarding  stigma  in  Romania  [1].  We  are  also 
aware  of  the  limitation  that  most  of  the  included  stud-
ies  are  more  than  ten  years  old,  potentially  limiting  the 
understanding of current state of affairs. Taken together, 
these  facts  emphasize  the  pressing  need  for  more  and 
recent  empirical  evidence  regarding  stigma  related  to 
mental illness in Romania in order to design and deliver 
targeted  and  effective  anti-stigma  actions.  Despite  the 
limitations,  this  review  meets  a  major  need  emphasized 
in recent research by contributing to the gap of evidence 
concerning  Eastern  European  countries.  To  the  best  of 
our knowledge, this is the first review of literature regard-
ing  stigma  related  to  mental  illness  in  Romania  and  the 
first  attempt  to  make  evidence-based  recommendations 
for future research and intervention.

Implications for research, policy and practice

In meeting the needs emphasized by the current review 
and  in  light  of  the  recommendations  of  global  stigma 
research [63, 66, 82, 83], interventions in Romania should 
target  three  main  dimensions  of  stigma  and  discrimina-
tion: public stigma as in knowledge, attitudes and behav-
iours;  self-stigma  as  the  internalization  of  public  beliefs 
followed  by  anticipated  discrimination;  and  structural 
stigma in the form of legal and policy frameworks.

Public and self‑stigma

As an evidence-based recommendation for the approach 
of public stigma, the intervention should consider several 
aspects. It should target priority groups of the Romanian 
population: healthcare and mental health personnel, fam-
ily members of people with mental illness, employers and 
journalists.  The  intervention  should  aim  to  change  the 
community’s attitudes towards people with mental illness 

 Manescu et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:662 

Page 18 of 21

through activities centred on forming an accurate image 
and  an  understanding  of  the  extent  of  the  stigma  they 
carry.  Regions  with  lower  socio-economic  status  should 
be  a  priority  focus  as  mental  illness  is  frequent  in  these 
groups  while  knowledge  is  poor  and  perceived  stigma 
and  discrimination  is  higher  compared  to  other  groups 
[29,  84].  They  may  benefit  especially  from  educational 
activities focused on enhancing mental health awareness 
and  communication.  Short  and  medium-term  interven-
tions  both  showed  an  improvement  in  public  attitudes 
towards people with mental illness [85, 86] although the 
scale and duration of such interventions are still debated. 
Involving people with mental health problems who expe-
rienced  stigma  and  discrimination  in  the  intervention, 
as ‘experts by experience’, represents a general evidence-
based recommendation being considered the most effec-
tive way in changing public attitudes and enhancing the 
effects  of  community  educational  measures  [87].  Using 
mass-media both as a target for stigma reduction and as 
an efficient means for improving attitudes towards men-
tal illness in the general population has already proved to 
be  beneficial  in  other  socio-cultural  settings  [64,  65,  88] 
and was also emphasized in this work. Anti-stigma inter-
ventions  can  benefit  from  targeting  media  workers  as 
potential social influencers in stigma advocacy and using 
social  media  channels  in  promoting  a  correct  image  of 
people with mental illness [89]. More promising lines of 
action  in  fighting  community  stigma  include  collabora-
tion  with  formal  and  informal  educational  institutions 
and  NGOs  and  targeting  other  potential  anti-stigma 
agents such as priests and other community leaders with 
greater cultural impact on the local communities.

Interventions should also consider help-seeking behav-
iours,  being  a  major  issue  in  the  Romanian  population. 
Public  stigma  proved  to  play  a  major  role  independent 
of  self-stigma,  suggesting  interventions  should  consider 
a  specific  approach  targeting  people’s  attitudes  towards 
those  admitted  to  a  psychiatric  hospital  in  particular. 
Further  research  should  answer  how  mental  health  ser-
vice users in Romania perceive the mental health system 
in terms of accessibility, efficiency,  and  stigma as it may 
also influence their help-seeking behaviour.

Stigma  related  to  the  work  environment  was  another 
hot topic for the Romanian population. Two main issues 
have  emerged  from  this  analysis:  employment  of  peo-
ple with mental illness and their rights in the workplace. 
Thus, interventions should aim to improve both sides of 
employers’  attitudes:  towards  hiring  people  with  men-
tal  health  problems  and  attitudes  towards  those  already 
hired.  As  a  particular  aspect,  self-stigma  seemed  to 
have  a  significant  impact  in  the  workplace,  contribut-
ing  to  anticipated  discrimination  and  avoidance  behav-
iour. Although low self-esteem and self-efficacy may not 

predict self-stigma in the general psychiatric population, 
when it comes to the workplace, interventions may ben-
efit  from  empowering  people  with  mental  illness  and 
increasing  their  self-esteem  and  self-efficiency  in  the 
workplace [66, 67, 69, 70].

Self-stigma associated with mental illness has not been 
sufficiently  assessed  in  Romanian  population.  There  are 
very  few  and  mixed  data  picturing  an  incomplete  view. 
Further  research  is  needed  to  explore  how  and  to  what 
extent self-stigma may interact with public beliefs in hin-
dering people’s access to mental care services. Self-stigma 
can  be  handled  by  training  mental  healthcare  profes-
sionals to educate and empower the person with mental 
health  problems  [67].  The  problem  addresses  structural 
changes  in  policies  regarding  medical  education  and  is 
discussed in more detail below.

Mental  health  professionals  have  been  identified  not 
only as a priority target for anti-stigma reduction but as 
anti-stigma  agents  as  well  [90,  91].  Studies  have  agreed 
that  health  specialists  can  represent  efficient  means 
of  reducing  discrimination  and  advancing  anti-stigma 
efforts  through  advocating  for  structural  and  legal 
changes  [92–95].  Anti-stigma  advocacy  training  is  not 
currently  part  of  the  general  training  of  mental  health 
professionals  or  medical  students.  Growing  evidence 
emphasizes  their  potential  effectiveness  in  promoting 
mental health and reducing self-stigma in patients as well 
as addressing public stigma in families, other health spe-
cialists or the general population. It is not yet clear how 
anti-stigma advocacy may be best included at the struc-
tural  level  in  the  education  of  mental  health  specialists 
and  more  evidence  coming  from  mental  health  settings 
is  needed  in  Romania.  A  recent  systematic  review  [95] 
assessing the effectiveness of training in health advocacy 
and  anti-stigma  competency  concluded  that  interven-
tion  in  mental  healthcare  professionals  should  check  a 
few important points: integrate advocacy in their profes-
sional roles; be developed based on a situational analysis; 
include people with experienced stigma and discrimina-
tion;  and  use  behavioural  outcomes.  Research  and  edu-
cational  fields  should  work  together  in  the  building  and 
delivery of evidence-based actions to secure both educa-
tional and legal frameworks.

Structural stigma

This work has drawn attention to several pressing needs 
of the mental health system in line with those addressed 
above. As concluded in this work, there are no integrated 
conceptual  frameworks  of  action  or  specific  practical 
guidelines in most fields of anti-stigma intervention. For 
instance,  there  are  no  evidence-based  tailored  interven-
tion  guidelines  in  working  with  community  stigma  and 
discrimination, or as stated above, no particular interest 

Manescu et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:662

in  integrating  anti-stigma  advocacy  training  in  medical 
education  and  psychiatric  training  curricula,  although 
there  are  many  benefits  already  proved  [93,  94,  96,  97]. 
Some efforts have been made by Romanian mental health 
experts [21] in proposing a biopsychosocial human rights 
conceptual framework that could meet some of the prob-
lems  faced  in  the  community  field.  The  most  effective 
Romanian  anti-stigma  actions  came  from  the  collabora-
tion  of  mental  health  professionals  with  human  rights 
NGOs as the Center of Legal Resources, covering multi-
ple approaches [29]. Another pressing need of the mental 
health  system  is  to  create  an  efficient  community  net-
work  of  specialists  ready  to  address  the  integration  and 
anti-stigmatization of people with mental illness. Actions 
to support this endeavour target policy change and train-
ing mental health specialists to fight for stigma reduction.

Conclusions
This  review  was  conducted  based  on  current  stigma 
research  recommendations  to  help  fill  the  evidence  gap 
concerning  post-soviet  European  countries.  The  level  of 
both  public  and  structural  stigma  is  high  in  Romania, 
leading  to  negative  attitudes  towards  help-seeking  and 
delayed  access  to  mental  health  services.  Stigma  is  pre-
sent at all levels affecting in particular work and marital 
life  areas  and  is  highest  towards  those  with  a  diagnosis 
of  schizophrenia  or  who  have  been  admitted  to  a  psy-
chiatric  institution.  A  few  anti-stigma  initiatives  target-
ing  the  general  population  were  conducted  in  Romania 
but  without  proper  evaluation,  follow-up  or  scientific 
dissemination.  Based  on  the  results  highlighted  in  this 
review, a few lines of action should be prioritize in Roma-
nia.  Increase  high-quality  research  in  order  to  develop 
evidence-based  tailored  interventions  targeting  priority 
subgroups  of  the  population.  Ensure  proper  evaluation 
and scientific dissemination. Elaborate and adopt guide-
lines for better addressing public stigma and advocate for 
policy changes. Training mental health personnel to take 
up more of these roles can be a good first step in fighting 
stigma associated with mental illness in Romania.
