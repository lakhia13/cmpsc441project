Abstract

Patients who suffer from alcohol use disorders (AUDs) usually go through various socio-
behavioral and pathophysiological changes that take place in the brain and other organs. Recently, 
consumption of unhealthy food and excess alcohol along with a sedentary lifestyle has become a 
norm in both developed and developing countries. Despite the beneficial effects of moderate 
alcohol consumption, chronic and/or excessive alcohol intake is reported to negatively affect the 
brain, liver and other organs, resulting in cell death, organ damage/failure and death. The most 
effective therapy for alcoholism and alcohol related comorbidities is alcohol abstinence, however, 
chronic alcoholic patients cannot stop drinking alcohol. Therefore, targeted therapies are urgently 
needed to treat such populations. Patients who suffer from alcoholism and/or alcohol abuse 
experience harmful effects and changes that occur in the brain and other organs. Upon stopping 
alcohol consumption, alcoholic patients experience acute withdrawal symptoms followed by a 
protracted abstinence syndrome resulting in the risk of relapse to heavy drinking. For the past few 
decades, several drugs have been available for the treatment of AUDs. These drugs include 
medications to reduce or stop severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms during alcohol detoxification 
as well as recovery medications to reduce alcohol craving and support abstinence. However, there 
is no drug that completely antagonizes the adverse effects of excessive amounts of alcohol. This 
review summarizes the drugs which are available and approved by the FDA and their mechanisms 
of action as well as the medications that are under various phases of preclinical and clinical trials. 
In addition, the repurposing of the FDA approved drugs, such as anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, 
antidepressants and other medications, to prevent alcoholism and treat AUDs and their potential 
target mechanisms are summarized.

1. Introduction

Page 2

Alcoholism is a chronic, relapsing disorder defined by compulsive alcohol seeking, loss of 
control over drinking and in a negative emotional state when not drinking. The major health 
issue that results from binge drinking is gut leakage and organ damage. For instance, chronic 
and excessive alcohol drinking negatively influences gut microbiota, stimulates gut leakage 
with elevated endotoxin, which can promote advanced liver disease, including inflammation, 
fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventually results in hepatocellular carcinoma (Schnabl & Brenner, 
2014). In addition to the liver, alcohol contributes to more than 200 diseases, including 
alcoholic dementia, injury-related health conditions and cancers, falls and automobile-
related accidental injuries (NIAAA, 2016a). Binge drinking, in the United States, is defined 
as a pattern of alcohol consumption that brings the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level 
to 0.08 g/dL or above within two hours (CDC, 2016). According to the national surveys, 
more than 90% of American adults who drink excessively reported binge drinking in the 
past 30 days (NIAAA, 2016b). Many binge drinkers may not be alcohol dependent, but their 
binge drinking habits make them susceptible to several health problems.

These problems related to AUD vary from individual to individual, based on genetic 
makeup, metabolism, age, gender, ethnicity, environment, lifestyle, etc. Since every 
individual responds differently to alcohol drinking, there is always a great concern for their 
susceptibility and outcome severity. For instance, having 2 or more drinks a day increases 
the risk of developing breast cancer by 25% (Smith-Warner et al., 1998). A meta-analysis of 
53 studies reported that, in women, 4 or more drinks per day increases the risk of breast 
cancer by 46% and this risk increases by 7% for each additional 10 grams of alcohol 
consumed (Hamajima et al., 2002). However, heavy alcohol consumption directly affects 
brain function and has been shown to induce mental disorders including mood, anxiety, 
psychotic, sleep and dementia disorders (Shivani et al., 2002). In addition to mood and 
behavior changes, alcohol can negatively influence thought, memory, and coordination. 
Excessive alcohol use can also affect other organs, such as the gut, liver, pancreas, and heart 
contributing to endotoxemia, advanced liver disease, pancreatitis, irregular heartbeat, stroke, 
high blood pressure and cardiomyopathy. In this article, we have focused on the effects of 
alcohol on the central nervous system (CNS) and medications for the treatment of AUDs. 
Covering other organs and organ systems as well as injuries mediated by AUD are beyond 
the scope of this review (for more details: Souza-Smith et al., 2016; Massey et al., 2015; 
Patel et al, 2015; Molina et al, 2014; Clemens et al., 2014). Despite the preclinical and 
clinical studies for the treatment of AUD during the past decades, only a few drugs have 
been approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These approved drugs 
were beneficial for some people, but not for others. Therefore, the highest priority for the 
NIAAA is to promote the development of less expensive, fast acting and more potent 
medications with less side effects. Additionally, to achieve these goals, there are several 
druggable medications coming on the market from time to time that are in different phases

of preclinical and clinical trials. Litten et al. have evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of 
the potential medications for AUD treatment (Litten et al., 2016).

Significant progress has been made during the past two decades in understanding the 
biological mechanisms underlying AUD, and there are more than 30 druggable targets on 
which preclinical and clinical trials are underway (Noronha et al., 2014; clinicaltrials.gov). 
Altogether there are 249 clinical trials that were completed around the world and among 
them 179 were conducted in the United States of America for the treatment of AUD. 
Currently, there are 105 ongoing clinical trials that are recruiting for the studies around the 
world and 75 of them are in the United States at the time of writing this review article 
(clinicaltrials.gov). The targets currently under investigation are important and are sensitive 
to stress, withdrawal and addiction. Other physiological systems, such as the immune 
system, have been shown to influence alcohol seeking and drinking behavior could be 
exploited for the development of AUD medications (Cui et al., 2011; Blednov et al., 2016). 
We have discussed most of the medications and their preclinical and clinical trials in other 
sections based on their categorization and the mechanisms of action. In this section, we will 
focus on some individual medications that are in various preclinical and clinical trials.

Chronic alcoholism has become a major health issue both in developed and developing 
countries with heavy social, medical and economic burdens. Despite the available 
pharmacotherapies for the treatment of AUDs, there are no such medication and treatment 
methods that give a hundred percent cure rate. Many of these drugs and medicines are 
known to exhibit some deleterious side effects or are only effective in some conditions. The 
currently used FDA approved drugs include Disulfiram, Naltrexone, and Acamprosate. 
These drugs were also approved by different regulatory agencies in many countries and have 
been used to treat AUDs for the past few decades with variable success rates. Improved 
medications for the treatment of binge, chronic alcohol drinking and alcohol related socio-
medical problems are greatly needed. Reviews of the current literature show that many drugs 
and medications such as anticonvulsants, antipsychotic and antidepressants are under 
preclinical and clinical trials for the treatment of AUDs. Previously we have reviewed on the 
status of FDA approved and some other medications for the treatment of AUDs (Heilig & 
Egli, 2006). In the present article, we have focused on the existing medications and the 
repurposing of the FDA approved medications for the prevention and treatment of AUDs 
with a list of potential medication candidates, as summarized in Figures -1 & -2, and Tables 
-1 & -2. In addition to this, the novel medications with potential therapeutic use and in 
various stages of development are discussed.

2. FDA Approved Medications for Alcohol Use Disorders

As mentioned previously, the medications that are approved by the FDA for the treatment of 
AUDs are Disulfiram, Acamprosate, Naltrexone and injectable extended-release Naltrexone 
(Revia or Vivitrol). Disulfiram, discovered in the year 1920 (Adams & Ludwig, 1930), and 
approved by the FDA in 1951, is still used for the treatment of chronic alcoholism 
conditions. It inhibits the enzyme mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase with a low Km 
(Michaelis Constant) for acetaldehyde. Disulfiram in the presence of alcohol, even in small 
amounts, produces flushing, throbbing headache, respiratory difficulty, nausea, copious

vomiting, sweating and thirst. Chest pain, palpitation, blurred vision, and confusion are other 
symptoms that are obvious. Severe side effects may include: respiratory depression, 
cardiovascular collapse, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, acute congestive heart failure, 
unconsciousness, convulsions, and death (NIH, 2016). The major metabolite of disulfiram 
(diethyldithiocarbamate) is an inhibitor of dopamine-β-hydroxylase, an enzyme that 
catalyzes the metabolism of dopamine to norepinephrine, resulting in psychosis, although 
this might be a rare effect depending on a family history of psychosis (Mohapatra & Rath, 
2017). Similarly, severe axonal polyneuropathy involving cranial nerves that developed 
within weeks after a regular dosage of 500 mg/day disulfiram was observed (Santos et al., 
2016). A recent meta-analysis on the efficacy of disulfiram for the treatment of alcohol 
dependence showed disulfiram as a controversial medication. The results of 22 included 
studies revealed that disulfiram was superior in comparison to control and in open-label 
RCTs. In contrast, disulfiram didn’t show any efficacy in blinded-RCTs in comparison to 
controls. However, disulfiram was more effective than the control in comparison to other 
medications (Skinner et al., 2014). Despite the controversial results, this was the only 
medication physicians could offer to their alcoholic patients to overcome alcoholism for 
more than four decades.

In 1994, FDA approved another oral medication Naltrexone for the treatment of alcoholism 
and opioid dependence. Naltrexone binds to the opioid receptors and attenuates the pleasant 
sensations associated with alcohol drinking. This medication is also reported to reduce 
alcohol craving. In 2006 the extended release formulation of naltrexone was approved by 
FDA and since then it has been in use. The closely related medications, which are used for 
the same purpose are Methylnaltrexone and Nalmefene. Naltrexone is marketed under the 
trade names Revia and Vivitrol and used for the treatment of alcoholism (Data. 
Medicaid.gov, 2016; Naltrexone: ATC/DDD Index – WHO, 2016). Naltrexone and its active 
metabolite 6β naltrexol are agonists at the μ-opioid (MOR), the  κ-opioid (KOR) and to a 
lesser extent, to the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) (Niciu et al., 2013). It has been shown to 
prevent heavy drinking, decreasing the volume and the number of alcohol drinking days 
(Rosner et al., 2010). Acute administration of a combination of naltrexone and Mesyl 
Salvinorin B (MSB, a long-acting deacetylated metabolite of a hallucinogenic recreational 
drug Salvinorin A) reduced alcohol intake profoundly after 3-week chronic escalation 
drinking (CED) at doses lower than those individual effective doses (Zhou et al., 2017). 
Even though it is effective in managing alcohol and opioid consumption, the overall benefits 
of naltrexone have been described as modest (Donoghue et al., 2015; Garbutt, 2010).

Another medication Acamprosate, was approved by the FDA in the year 2006 and has been 
used along with counselling in the treatment of alcohol dependence (Plosker, 2015). It is 
sold under the brand name Campral and is thought to stabilize the balance of 
neurotransmitters in the brain that would otherwise be disrupted by alcohol withdrawal 
(Williams, 2005). Reports indicate that acamprosate works to best advantage in combination 
with psychosocial support and can help facilitate reduced consumption as well as full 
abstinence (Mason, 2001; Nutt, 2014). Acamprosate, at high concentrations well above 
those that occur clinically (1–3 μM), has been reported to inhibit glutamate receptor-
activated responses (1 mM), enhance N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function (300 
μM), and exhibit weak antagonism of the NMDA receptor with partial agonism of the

polyamine site of the NMDA receptor. Thus, the use of acamprosate as an adjunct to 
psychosocial interventions in alcohol-dependent patients provide modest but potentially 
valuable improvements in alcohol-consumption outcomes (Plosker, 2015).

In addition to the FDA approved medications, there are many other medications available. 
These agents include Fluoxetine, Duloxetine, Tiagabine, Levitriacetam, Gabapentin, 
Pregabalin, Sertraline, Citalopram, Ritanserin, Aripiprazole, Ondansetron, Quetiapine, 
Nalmefene and Topiramate. Many supporting reports are available for the potential usage of 
these medications in the treatment of AUDs, although they are not approved by the FDA yet. 
Some of them are discussed in detail in the following section.

3. FDA Approved Medications with Potential to be Repurposed for Alcohol 

Use Disorders

3.a. Anticonvulsants

Gabapentin—[1-(aminomethyl) cyclohexaneacetic acid] was approved in 1993 to treat 
partial seizures in epilepsy (Gabapentin, ASHSP, 2015). It is also used for the treatment of 
neuropathic pain in diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia (Moore et al., 2014), central 
neuropathic pain, hot flashes and restless leg syndrome (Wijemanne & Jankovic, 2015: Attal 
et al., 2010). Sleepiness and dizziness are the common side effects and patients with kidney 
problems should use lower doses. It is unclear whether it is safe to use during pregnancy or 
breastfeeding (Gabapentin Pregnancy and Breastfeeding, 2016). Gabapentin resembles to 
the endogenous neurotransmitter GABA and does not bind GABA receptors at 
concentrations at or below 1 mM (Patel & Dickensen, 2016; Product Monograph, 2014). It 
modulates the enzymatic activities of glutamate decarboxylase and branched chain 
aminotransferase, both of which are known to be involved in GABA biosynthesis. 
Gabapentin has been reported to enhance the synthesis of GABA and increase non-synaptic 
GABA neurotransmission in vitro (Taylor, 1997). It has been shown to bind to the α2δ-1 
subunit of voltage gated calcium ion channels, which contribute to its pain attenuation 
effects on diabetic neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia. Other neurophysiological 
findings indicate that gabapentin also interacts with NMDA receptors, protein kinase C, and 
inflammatory cytokines (Kukkar et al., 2013).

Preclinical evaluation of gabapentin shows sensitivity to moderate alcohol doses and alcohol 
self-administration in rats with history of moderate alcohol drinking. Gabapentin (0, 10, 30, 
60mg/kg i.g) pretreatment potentiated the interoceptive effects of both experimenter-
administered and self-administered alcohol in discrimination-trained rats. Gabapentin doses 
(30 and 120mg/kg) showed partial alcohol-like discriminative stimulus when given alone. In 
the self-administration trained rats, gabapentin pretreatment (60mg/kg) resulted in escalation 
in alcohol self-administration suggesting that gabapentin may mediate the potentiation of 
alcohol effects by increasing alcohol self-administration in non-dependent populations 
(Besheer et al., 2016).

A randomized, double-blind study, involving US veterans meeting DSM-IV diagnostic 
criteria for alcohol dependence, showed that gabapentin reduced alcohol craving. Seventeen

out of the 26 patients received gabapentin (1200 mg orally for 3 days, followed by 900, 600, 
and 300 mg for 1 day each) and nine of them received chlordiazepoxide (100 mg orally for 3 
days, followed by 75, 50, and 25 mg for 1 day each). In ambulatory veterans with symptoms 
of alcohol withdrawal, gabapentin treatment resulted in significantly greater reduction in 
sedation on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and a trend to reduced alcohol craving on 
Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS) by the end of treatment compared to chlordiazepoxide 
treatment. Despite the limitation of the small sample size, this study showing a reduction in 
sleepiness and less alcohol craving warrants a replicate study with a larger sample group 
(Stock et al., 2013). A recent clinical study lasting for 12 weeks was conducted between 
2004 and 2010 at a single-site, outpatient clinical research facility adjoining a general 
medical hospital. Gabapentin (particularly the 1800-mg dosage) was used to evaluate 
gabapentin as a pharmacological treatment option for alcohol dependence in primary care. A 
12 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized dose-ranging trial of 150 men and 
women showed that it was effective in treating alcohol dependence and relapse-related 
symptoms of insomnia, dysphoria, and craving. There were linear gabapentin dose effects on 
increasing rates of complete abstinence. Compared with placebo, gabapentin, 1800 mg, 
increased the relative benefits of complete abstinence from heavy drinking (Mason et al., 
2014). The role of gabapentin to reduce alcohol craving and consumption was evaluated in a 
subacute human laboratory study by employing a double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment 
in 35 non-treatment seeking alcoholic subjects. Gabapentin (1200mg/day or 0mg/day) was 
given for 8 days. This study suggests that there was no overall effect of gabapentin on 
drinking or craving and that it was well tolerated (Myrick et al., 2007).

Topiramate—2,3:4,5-Bis-O-(1-methylethylidene)-β-D-fructopyranose sulfamate, marketed 
under the trade name Topamax, is an anticonvulsant, used for the treatment of epilepsy in 
adults as well as in children (Topamax, FDA, 2011) and used for treating migraines. Minor 
side effects include dizziness, weight loss or gain, paresthesia, anemia, nausea, dilated pupil, 
somnolence, dizziness, agitation and abnormally uncoordinated body moments, and may 
become fatal in combination with multi-drug exposure (Wills et al., 2014; Lofton & Slein-
Schwartz, 2005). Topiramate mediates its effects through multiple mechanisms, including 
activation of voltage-gated sodium channels, high voltage-activated calcium channels, 
GABA-A type receptor, AMPA/kainate receptors and carbonic anhydrase isozymes (Porter 
et al., 2012). However, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation of these 
proteins are also reported to exhibit their indirect effect (Meldrum & Rogawski, 2007). 
Among them, sodium channels are thought to be a major target due to the role they play in 
seizures.

In addition to its role as an anticonvulsant medication, topiramate has been used in AUD 
with moderate to good success rates. For instance, Junqueira-Ayres et. al. studied the effects 
of topiramate on anxiety and AWS. They reported that when topiramate (40 mg/kg, i.g) was 
given acutely and chronically to rats that showed anxiety like behavior after alcohol 
withdrawal, it significantly reduced anxiety indicating the anti-anxiolytic effect of 
topiramate (Junqueira-Ayres et al., 2017). They also reported that there were no signs of 
tolerance and dependence. Echeverry-Alzate et al, studied the effects of topiramate on 
operant ethanol self-administration along with cocaine in Wistar rats (N=128) by treating

with topiramate (2.5 – 40mg/kg, i.p). Topiramate inhibited cocaine-induced increased 
response to ethanol dose dependently without mediating any motor impairment by itself 
when topiramate administered before alcohol access, but not when topiramate was 
administered before cocaine and did not block cocaine-induced psychomotor stimulation. 
Topiramate reduced blood ethanol levels but has no effect on cocaine metabolism. Ethanol 
increased gene expressions of DNA and RNA methyltransferases, whereas histone 
aeacetylase-2 and glutamate receptor kainite-1 were increased by cocaine treatment. The 
upregulation of dopamine and opioid receptor genes were reported when topiramate and 
cocaine were co-administered, suggesting that topiramate regulates the expression of genes 
in response to alcohol and cocaine-induced behavior and inhibits the cocaine-induced 
increase in operant ethanol self -administration (Echeverry-Alzate et al., 2014).

In a clinical trial, the effects of low dose topiramate were studied for the treatment of alcohol 
dependence. In an open-label controlled study, thirty patients received 75 mg of topiramate 
per day in addition to psychotherapeutic treatment, in comparison to the control group. After 
4–6 weeks of monitoring for the symptoms of depression, anxiety and craving, they found 
that patients who received topiramate showed a marked improvement in depressive, anxiety 
and obsessive-compulsive drinking symptoms in comparison to controls. In addition, the 
relapse rate was shown to be lower in the patients receiving topiramate, suggesting that a 
low dose of topiramate was effective in reducing craving, symptoms of depression and 
anxiety (Paparrigopoulos et al., 2011).

Baltieri et al, conducted a comparative study of topiramate and naltrexone for the treatment 
of alcohol dependence. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients 
received either topiramate (300 mg/day), naltrexone (50 mg/day), or placebo. In comparison 
to those receiving naltrexone and placebo patients receiving topiramate showed reduced 
relapse time, cumulative abstinence duration and diminished drinking, suggesting that 
topiramate is more efficient than naltrexone in preventing of alcoholism relapse (Baltieri et 
al., 2008). Similarly, topiramate and naltrexone were evaluated for percent of subjects with 
no heavy drinking days (PSNHDDs) in two large alcohol clinical trials, namely COMBINE 
and a multi-site topiramate trial. In these trials, PSNHDDs and other traditional end points 
were drawn for topiramate, naltrexone, acamprosate and placebo groups. PSNHDD effect 
sizes were significant for both topiramate and naltrexone. A 2-month grace period for 
naltrexone and a 1-month grace period for topiramate have been shown to be greater than the 
majority of traditional outcome measures. Subjects with no HDDs during treatment fared 
better than those with some HDDs on drinking outcomes and alcohol-related consequences 
(Falk et al., 2010). Despite the beneficial effects of topiramate in reducing relapse, alcohol 
dependence, anxiety and craving, this medication has not been approved for the treatment of 
alcohol dependence in either Europe or USA and needs further investigations (Michalak & 
Biala, 2016). The recent studies from Anthenelli et al, showed that topiramate was not 
effective in the patients who were alcohol dependent male smokers. Topiramate was only 
effective in preventing and reducing alcohol consumption in current alcohol drinkers and 
prevents relapse in recently detoxified alcoholics, indicating that topiramate has some 
potential to treat non-alcohol dependent male smokers (Anthenelli et al, 2017).

Pregabalin—[(3S) -3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid], is a medication marketed 
under the brand name Lyrica, for the treatment of epilepsy, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, 
and generalized anxiety disorders (Frampton, 2014; Pregabalin, ASHSP, 2015; Patel & 
Dickenson, 2016). In addition, pregabalin can be used for treating restless leg syndrome 
(Kirsch, 2013), prevention of migraines, social anxiety disorders (Pregabalin Lyrica Part I, 
2015) and alcohol withdrawal (Mirijello et al., 2015). Common side effects include: 
sleepiness, confusion, memory, poor motor coordination, dry mouth, vision, weight gain and 
potentially serious side effects include angioedema and drug misuse. There is an increased 
risk of suicide and addiction, if taken in high doses over a longer period (Pregabalin, 
ASHSP, 2015). Pregabalin, a close analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and a 
gabapentinoid (Bryans & Wustrow, 1999; Lapin, 2001), is a GABAergic anticonvulsant and 
a depressant of the CNS. Although pregabalin is an analogue of GABA, it does not bind 
directly to GABAA, GABAB, benzodiazepine, or opioid receptors, and does not block 
sodium channels, instead it binds with high affinity to the α2δ–1 α2δ–2 subunit-containing 
voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) (Li et al., 2011). The α2δ-1 and α2δ-2 subunits are 
expressed throughout the brain regions such as; cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum 
including DRG neurons. Binding of pregabalin correlates partially with some excitatory 
GABAergic neurons and some with inhibitory interneurons (Dolphin, 2012) and exerts 
distinctive functions in the CNS (Cole et al., 2005). Pregabalin increases the density of 
GABA transporter proteins and increases the rate of functional GABA transport (DailyMed, 
2015).

Stopponi et al. used genetically selected alcohol-preferring Marchigian Sardinian (msP) rats, 
and evaluated the effect of pregabalin on alcohol drinking and relapse with alcohol seeking, 
induced by stress or environmental conditioning factors (Stopponi et al., 2012). The results 
showed that treatment with pregabalin (0, 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg) given orally selectively 
reduced home cage alcohol drinking in msP rats. In the alcohol reinstatement model, 
pregabalin (0, 10 and 30 mg/kg) abolished alcohol seeking behavior elicited by the 
pharmacological stressor yohimbine, suggesting its role in the treatment of alcohol 
addiction. The effects of pregabalin were evaluated on nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced 
hyperalgesia in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Pretreatment of rats with pregabalin (10 – 
30mg/kg, s.c) thirty minutes prior to NTG (10mg/kg, i.p) injection alleviated NTG-induced 
hyperalgesia and suppressed peripheral calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) (Di et al., 
2015). Previously, the anticonvulsant effects of pregabalin were evaluated in mice. Adult 
mice were chronically exposed to ethanol and upon withdrawal examined for the behavioral 
signs of seizure activity such as handling-induced convulsions (HIC) or abnormalities in 
EEG activity recorded from cortical and subcortical regions. Pregabalin (50–200mg/kg, i.p) 
administered after one and four hours of withdrawal dose dependently reduced HIV and 
EEG activity in comparison to vehicle-treated mice, suggesting that pregabalin might be a 
potential therapeutic agent for the management of alcohol detoxification (Becker et al., 
2006).

Martinotti et al, studied in a randomized double-blind comparison trial the effects of 
pregabalin and naltrexone by recruiting seventy-one patients and investigated the alcohol 
drinking indices (alcohol craving and relapse prevention) and psychiatric symptoms.

Detoxified patients were randomized into two groups that received either pregabalin (150–
450mg) and naltrexone (50mg) for 16 weeks. The results showed the pregabalin effects are 
similar to naltrexone in improving alcohol drinking indices, relapse rate and craving scores. 
In addition, pregabalin was more favorable in reducing the specific symptoms of anxiety, 
hostility and psychoticism and showed better outcome in patients reporting a comorbid 
psychiatric disorder (Martinotti et al., 2010). In another study, Addolorato & Leggio, 2010, 
has compared the effects of pregabalin with other medications for the treatment of AWS. In 
this study, 111 alcoholic patients suffering with AWS were randomized and given pregabalin 
(450mg/day), tiapride (800mg/day) and lorazepam (10mg/day) for 14 days. Among these 
medications, pregabalin showed significant reduction in AWS and many patients remained 
alcohol-free, suggesting that pregabalin has pharmacotherapeutic potential for AWS 
(Addolorato & Leggio, 2010). In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial during 
inpatient alcohol detoxification, alcohol dependent patients received pregabalin or placebo 
on a fixed dose schedule starting with 300 mg/day for 6 days. Both pregabalin and placebo 
showed similar efficacy according to alterations of scores of the AWS, clinical institute 
withdrawal assessment for alcohol revised (CIWA-Ar) scores and neuropsychological scales. 
The frequency of adverse events and dropouts did not differ between the treatment groups 
and demonstrated the relative safety of pregabalin in the treatment of AWS (Forg et al., 
2012).

3.b. Antipsychotics

Quetiapine, marketed under the trade name Seroquel, is an atypical antipsychotic 
medication approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major 
depressive disorder. It was approved by FDA in the year 1997. There are now several generic 
versions that are available and have been used for these disorders. Quetiapine exhibits 
antagonistic effects on serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptors, and shows a potent 
antihistamine effect with clinically negligible anticholinergic properties. Quetiapine binds 
strongly to the serotonin receptors and acts as partial agonist on 5-HT1A receptors (Guzman, 
2013). Some of the antagonized receptors (serotonin, norepinephrine) are actually auto-
receptors and blocking these receptors increases the release of neurotransmitters.

Celikyurt et al, evaluated the effects of quetiapine in adult male Wistar rats on AWS. 
Quetiapine was compared with other medications after giving ethanol (7.2% v/v for 21 
days). Quetiapine (8 & 16mg/kg, i.p) risperidone (1 & 2mg/kg, i.p) and ziprasidone (0.5 & 
1mg/kg, i.p) were given and measured ethanol withdrawal symptoms after 1, 2, 4 and 6 hrs. 
All three drugs showed significant reduction in AWS and reduced incidence of audiogenic 
seizures, suggesting that quetiapine and risperidone were more effective than ziprasidone in 
attenuating AWS in rats and might help in controlling AWS in ethanol-dependent patients 
(Celikyurt et al., 2011).

The efficacy of quetiapine was evaluated by Kurlawala & Vatsalya, for the treatment of 
akathisia (involuntary body movements) in a very heavy alcohol drinking patients. It has 
been shown to alleviate symptoms of akathisia in a clinical trial. Treatment with quetiapine 
progressively lowered the occurrence of akathisia in alcohol dependent patients with no 
symptoms of depression, and over time in heavy drinkers who had clinically significant

symptoms of depression (Kurlawala & Vatsalya, 2016). Several preliminary open-label and 
retrospective studies reported that quetiapine reduced alcohol intake in alcohol-dependent 
patients (Monnelly et al., 2004; Martinotti et al., 2008). In contrast, Kampman et al, reported 
that patients characterized by the late age onset of drinking problem and low severity of 
alcohol dependence did not benefit from quetiapine (Kampman et al., 2007). Litten et al, 
conducted a multisite RCT by enrolling 224 alcohol-dependent patients who reported very 
heavy drinking across five clinical sites. Two weeks after randomization, patients received a 
titrated target dose of quetiapine fumarate extended-release (Seroquel XR) 400mg/day 
during weeks 3 to 11 and a tapered dose in the final week. They found no difference 
between the quetiapine treated patients and placebo group in terms of percent heavy 
drinking days and other alcohol drinking outcomes. However, quetiapine significantly 
reduced depressive symptoms and improved sleep (Litten et al, 2012).

Quetiapine was evaluated in another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 
patients with bipolar disorder, depression and alcohol dependence. Ninety outpatients with 
bipolar disorder (I and II) with depression and mixed mood state and alcohol dependence 
patients who were randomized and given quetiapine (600mg/day) for 12 weeks did not show 
significance differences in reducing alcohol consumption in patients with bipolar disorders 
(Brown et al., 2014). These data suggest that, despite quetiapine showing promising results 
in preliminary human studies, it was not effective in a single site (Monnelly et al., 2004; 
Martinotti et al., 2008) and multisite RCT (Litten et al., 2012; Litten et al., 2016).

Aripiprazole, is an atypical antipsychotic medication sold under the brand name Abilify. It 
is a partial dopamine agonist used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Aripiprazole 
(ARI), is also used for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), tic disorders and 
autism. Side effects include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, high blood 
pressure in diabetics and dementia (Ramsberg et al., 2012). ARI functions as a D2 and 5-
HT1A receptor partial agonist and as an antagonist of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT7 receptor 
(Lawler et al., 1999; Burstein et al., 2005; Jordan et al., 2002). It has moderate affinities for 
histamine and α-adrenergic receptors and serotonin transporters. It is metabolized by the 
hepatic enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. The CNS dopamine system is implicated in both 
reward processing/memory and the inhibitory control mechanisms at the subcortical and 
cortical regions of the brain.

Alcohol dependence increases the risk of depression in patients, causing damage and 
deficiencies in brain function, resulting in cognitive function impairment. However, many 
studies have suggested the antidepressant effects of ARI in animal model and in humans. 
Burda-Malarz et al., assessed the antidepressant effect of ARI by employing Porsolt’s forced 
swimming test and Morris water maze test in alcohol-preferring rats (EtPRs). 
Administration of ARI (6 mg/kg i.p.), fluoxetine (FLX; 5 mg/kg p.o.) and combined 
administration of both drugs in these behavioral tests in alcohol-dependent rats showed no 
antidepressant and procognitive effects of either ARI or FLX in EtPRs after acute and 
chronic treatment. In fact, combined administration of both drugs leads to spatial memory 
deterioration in the animal study (Burda-Malarz et al., 2014a). In another study by using 
alcohol non-preferring rats (EtNPRs), both ARI and FLX either administered alone or in 
combination did not show any antidepressant and precognitive effects. Combined

administration of both drugs led to anxiogenic effect and spatial memory deterioration in 
EtNPRs (Burda-Malarz et. al., 2014b). The role of ARI as a potential medication for the 
treatment of alcohol-dependence with psychotic disorders was evaluated in a preclinical 
chronic alcohol self-administration (CASA) animal model. During oral administration of 
ARI at doses 1, and 3 mg/kg on 4% alcohol intake, ARI did not reduce alcohol intake 
substantially (13 and 28%, respectively). However, ARI at 10 mg/kg dose significantly 
reduced alcohol intake. Striatal D2R occupancy and brain exposure of ARI were 
considerably higher in CASA rats when compared to normal rats, suggesting that ARI could 
be a potential medication to treat the patients dually diagnosed with alcohol abuse and 
psychotic disorders (Nirogi et al., 2013).

Han et al, reported that the combination of Escitalopram (a selective SSRI) with ARI 
improved depressive symptoms and reduced craving for alcohol and cue-induced brain 
activity in patients with co-morbid alcohol dependence and major depressive disorder 
(MDD). Thirty five subjects with co-morbid alcohol dependence and MDD were recruited in 
this study and divided into two groups. One received AR I+ escitalopram (ARI 5–15mg + 
escitalopram 10–20mg/day for 6 weeks) and other escitalopram alone. Both escitalopram 
alone and ARI + escitalopram group were shown to reduce Beck Depression Inventory and 
clinical global index-severity (CGI-S) scores, however, reduced alcohol craving in ARI + 
escitalopram group. These findings suggest that the effects of ARI on anterior cingulate 
cortex might mediate the successful treatment of alcohol dependence in patients with MDD 
(Han et al., 2013). Myrick et al, evaluated the effects of aripiprazole on alcohol cue-induced 
brain activation and drinking in alcoholics. 30 subjects with no-treatment seeking alcoholics 
were URN randomized (biased-coin approach) into control and treatment groups and given 
15mg/day for 14 days. Brain activity analysis revealed increased activation in placebo-
treated subjects in the right ventral striatum, however activation in this area in aripiprazole-
treated subjects were attenuated resulting in significantly less heavy drinking sessions during 
the treatment period. These results suggest that aripiprazole attenuates heavy drinking 
mediated by cue-induced brain activation and voluntary drinking (Myrick et al., 2010).

The effects of ARI on the aspects of impulsivity were evaluated in non-treatment-seeking 
AUD individuals based on their level of impulsivity and self-control in a well-validated 
clinical trial. Ninety-nine subjects with heavy drinking and meeting DSM-IV criteria were 
randomized into two groups. The ARI group received 15mg/day for 8 days. There was no 
effect of ARI or interaction on a Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) score during the 
natural drinking period in both the groups, however, it was effective on bar-lab drinking. 
ARI also reduced the total number of drinks consumed among individuals with low self-
control and increased latency to consume more drinks among those with high impulsivity. 
This paradigm forced a choice between immediate drinking reward and delayed monetary 
reward, suggesting ARI-induced targeting of cortical dopamine/serotonin balance might 
show clinical benefits of reduced drinking among individuals with impulsivity/low self-
control (Anton et al., 2017).

3.c. Antidepressants

Page 12

Duloxetine, sold under the brand name Cymbalta (Drugs.com, 2016), a selective serotonin 
and norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor (SNRI), is mostly prescribed for major depression 
and generalized anxiety disorder, fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain (Duloxetine 
Monograph, ASHSP, 2015). According to a 2014 Cochrane review, duloxetine was reported 
beneficial for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia (Lunn et al., 2014). 
Nevertheless, the French medical journal Prescrire branded duloxetine as a good drug with 
considerable risk of side effects (Prescrire International, 2014). Duloxetine increases DA 
specifically in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where there are few DA reuptake pumps, through 
the inhibition of NE re-uptake pumps (Stahl, 2013). However, duloxetine has no significant 
affinity for dopaminergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA reuptake 
transporters and can therefore be a selective reuptake inhibitor of the 5-HT and NE 
transporters. Circulating metabolites of duloxetine do not contribute significantly to the 
pharmacologic activity (Stahl & Grady, 2005; Bymaster & Lee, 2005).

In a comparative study by using putative noradrenergic signaling inhibitors (prazosin, 
propranolol, and duloxetine) in adult male Long Evans rats, Skelly & Weiner have reported 
that prazosin (1.5 mg/kg/day) and duloxetine (1.5 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased 
ethanol self-administration by reducing anxiety-like behavior (Skelly & Weiner, 2014). They 
have also reported that exposure to stress, particularly during adolescence, may increase the 
risk of developing psychotic conditions, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), 
resulting in excessive alcohol intake in adulthood. By utilizing anxiolytic medications, these 
investigators confirmed that adolescent social isolation increases anxiety-like behavior and 
enhances ethanol intake. They suggested that disrupted noradrenergic signaling may 
contribute to escalating ethanol drinking following social isolation, associated with early life 
stress, making these noradrenergic drugs potential therapeutic agents (Skelly et al., 2015). 
Previously, Ji et al, has reported the effects of duloxetine and other medications in voluntary 
and self -administration of alcohol in male Wistar rats in daily limited access two-bottle 
choice and operant drinking sessions. Injections of duloxetine (0–8 mg/kg every 3 to 4 days, 
i.p.), naltrexone (0–450 mg/kg every 3 to 4 days, i.p.) and MPZP (0–20 mg/kg every 3 to 4 
days, i.p.). The results showed duloxetine dose dependently suppressed two-bottle choice 
alcohol binge drinking and operant alcohol responding as well as operant supersac drinking, 
but did not affect two-bottle choice supersac drinking. The other drugs showed moderate to 
no effects on alcohol or supersac consumption (Ji et al., 2008).

Recently, the effects of antidepressants including duloxetine and other SSRIs were evaluated 
in an observational study based on a multicenter drug surveillance (Arzneimittelsicherheit in 
der Psychiatrie) program in German speaking countries such as; Austria, Germany, and 
Switzerland. They recorded the severe drug reactions in psychiatric inpatients (n=184234) in 
80 psychiatric hospitals and found 149 cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Many 
antidepressants including fluoxetine, paroxetine and duloxetine are inhibitors of CYP2D6 
and induce DILI (Friedrich et al., 2016), especially in elderly patients (Voican et al., 2014). 
Similar observations were reported by Kang et al, in South Korea. Three patients, a 22 years 
old Korean male with depression, a 65 year old Korean female with MDD and a 37 year old 
Korean male with MDD were given duloxetine (30–60 mg/day) during the course of

treatment in the clinic. Duloxetine was administered to these patients along with the other 
medications for the treatment of depression showed higher levels of ALT, AST and ALP in 
liver function tests, suggesting that duloxetine administration can induce liver injury in 
patients with MDD and in patients with preexisting chronic liver disease or alcohol 
consumption (Kang et al., 2011).

Venlafaxine, marketed as Effexor, Effexor XR, Lanvexin, Viepax and Trevilor, is used as an 
antidepressant medication. This medicine belongs to an SNRI group of inhibitors (Muth et 
al., 1986; Yardley et al., 1990; Bymaster et al., 2001) that increase the concentrations of the 
neurotransmitters serotonin and NE in the body and the brain. Currently it is used for the 
treatment of MDD, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder and social phobia 
(Joint Formulary Committee, 2013; Rossi, 2013). Its metabolite (O-desmethylvenlafaxine) 
also acts as another antidepressant drug called desvenlafaxine and sold under the brand 
name Pristiq (Pae, 2011). Venlafaxine works on both serotoninergic and adrenergic systems, 
and reduces the cataplexy (a form of muscle weakness) episodes in patients with the sleep 
disorder narcolepsy (Grothe et al., 2004). It is also reported as a serotonin-norepinephrine-
dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI) based on its dose-dependent effects on various 
neurotransmitter systems (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; Goeringer et al., 2001; Wellington & 
Perry, 2001).

Cognitive impairments are associated with depression and decrease grey matter volume in 
brain that may affect cognitive function and brain structure (Droppa K et al 2017). In 
addition, venlafaxine indirectly affects the opioid receptors (mu-, kappa1- kappa3- and delta-
opioid receptor subtypes) as well as the alpha2-adrenergic receptor. Additionally, 
intraperitoneal injection of venlafaxine was shown to induce naloxone-reversible 
antinociceptive effect in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest venlafaxine’s 
seemingly superior efficacy in severe depression conditions (Schreiber et al., 2002). Trouvin 
et al, demonstrated in their eleven randomized clinical trials that, in nine out of eleven 
clinical trials venlafaxine was found to be effective against neuropathic pain with mild to 
moderate adverse events, suggesting that venlafaxine is associated with greater improvement 
in depression severity (Trouvin et al., 2017). In another clinical trial, Ciraulo et al, evaluated 
the efficacy of venlafaxine in comorbid AUD and anxiety disorders. A randomized 
controlled trial comprising of 81 patients divided into 4 groups such as cognitive behavioral 
treatment (CBT), progressive muscle relaxation therapy (PMR), placebo-CBT and placebo-
PMR with or without venlafaxine (225mg/day) was conducted. After 11 weeks of treatment 
on CBT and PMR conditions, venlafaxine did not modulate anxiety and drinking in three 
groups, however, there was significant decrease in heavy drinking in placebo-CBT group 
(Ciraulo et al., 2013). Some open-label and three double-blind studies have suggested the 
efficacy of venlafaxine in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
and PTSD (Ghanizadeh, et al., 2013; Pae et al., 2007). In contrast, there are several other 
reports that showed the toxicity of this medication to liver and other disease conditions such 
as cholestatic hepatitis (Stadlmann et al., 2012), jaundice and liver failure (Detry et al., 
2009), and hepatotoxicity in patient with ulcerative colitis (Yildirim et al., 2009).

Recent studies with guanfacine, an α-2-adrenoreceptor agonist and FDA-approved ADHD 
medication, reported to attenuate stress-induced relapse of several drugs of abuse including

alcohol. The effects of guanfacine (0.6 mg/kg injection once a week, 7 days apart) on 
voluntary alcohol intake, the alcohol deprivation effect, alcohol seeking behavior and cue 
priming-induced reinstatement was evaluated in Wistar rats that had voluntarily consumed 
alcohol around two months. Guanfacine decreased alcohol intake in high alcohol-consuming 
rats in comparison to naltrexone. Repeated guanfacine treatment induced a long-lasting 
decrease in alcohol intake and attenuated the alcohol deprivation effect, alcohol seeking and 
cue/priming-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. Even though higher doses (1.5, 
1mg/kg doses) guanfacine used by other groups (Opitz, 1990: Smith & Aston-Jones, 2011) 
and results from the same group that used 1mg/kg of guanfacine clearly decreased alcohol 
intake in a pilot study and in the open field test. But this effect was due to sedative and 
nonspecific effect due to higher doses. However, with 0.6mg/kg, the nonspecific effects of 
sedation decreased as guanfacine increased significant water intake, but not in alcohol-naïve 
rats, suggesting that guanfacine mediated effects are specific that improve prefrontal 
connectivity through modulation of glutamatergic neurons (Fredriksson et al., 2015).

In another study, Ivermectin (a semi-synthetic macrocyclic lactone; an anti-parasitic agent), 
that has been to shown to reduce alcohol intake in mice (Wyatt et al., 2014; Yardley et al., 
2012), was used in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial. Eleven patients 
with AUD participated in a cue exposure paradigm received 30 mg oral every day (QD) 
followed by 0.08 g/dl intravenous alcohol administration. When compared with placebo, 
Ivermectin did not reduce cue-induced craving and did not significantly affect the subjective 
response to alcohol (Roche et al., 2016). Furthermore, a previous study indicated that 
ivermectin does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier, minimizing its role in treating 
AUDs (Geyer et al., 2009). However, MacKillop et al. reported that D-cycloserine (D-4-
amino-3-isoxazolidone: an antibiotic compound that is also a partial agonist for NMDA 
receptor) enhanced extinction to cue-elicited craving for alcohol in individuals with AUDs 
(MacKillop et al., 2015). Although, D-cycloserine has been shown to attenuate reacquisition 
of CPP in mice (Groblewski et al, 2009) and reduce priming-based reinstatement in rats 
(Vengelience et al, 2008) and are consistent with other addictive drugs (Myers & Carlezon, 
2010). However, these effects on alcohol related extinction have not been reproduced in 
humans (MacKillop et al., 2015).

The role of the endocannabinoid system in the AUD has been evaluated by many 
laboratories. By using animal and cell culture models, it has been demonstrated that chronic 
ethanol exposure causes an increase in endocannabinoid levels and downregulate 
cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1) (Basavarajappa & Hungund, 2001). In rodents, treatment with 
a CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (Rimonabant), or genetic deletion of CB1 receptors 
was shown to reduce voluntary alcohol drinking (Hungund et al., 2003; Naassila et al., 2004; 
Vinod et al., 2008b), ethanol-stimulated dopamine release in the NAc, operant self-
administration of ethanol (Cippitelli et al., 2005; Economidou et al., 2006; Cippitelli et al., 
2007; Cippitelli et al., 2008), sensitization to the locomotor effects of ethanol (Marinho et 
al., 2015), and reinstatement/relapse of ethanol-motivated behavior. Similarly, down-
regulation of CB1 receptors has been reported in multiple regions of the human alcoholic 
brains as evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) (Normandin et al., 2015). 
Despite the beneficial effects in rodent studies, the clinical utility of the Rimonabant was 
limited due to neuropsychiatric side effects and is not in use for AUD research.

Baclofen—[β-(4-chlorophenyl)-γ-aminobutyric acid (β-(4-chlorophenyl)-GABA)]. 
Baclofen is an agonist of GABAB-receptors, and is used in alcohol-dependent patients at 
higher doses for the treatment of alcohol craving. A retrospective study of baclofen self-
poisoning was reported by the western France Poison Control Center (PCC), suggesting that 
baclofen, when prescribed in high doses, may lead to severe poisoning, particularly in 
patients with psychiatric illnesses (Boels et al., 2017).

Recent studies suggested the bidirectional effects of baclofen enantiomers where R(+)-
baclofen, suppressed alcohol intake and R(−)baclofen stimulated alcohol intake in mice. To 
further evaluate the enantioselectivity of baclofen on the reinforcing effects of alcohol in 
rats, Lorrai and his group used selectively bred Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) rats. In sP 
rats, 3 mg/kg (±)-baclofen reduced the number of lever responses for alcohol administration 
and estimated amount of self-administered alcohol by approximately 60% in comparison to 
vehicle treatment. Treatment with 1.5 mg/kg R(+)-baclofen decreased both outcome 
measures to an extent like that of the decreasing effect of 3 mg/kg (±)-baclofen. Conversely, 
treatment with all doses of S(−)-baclofen failed to modulate alcohol self-administration 
(Lorrai et al., 2016).

Morley et al, conducted a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial by 
enrolling sixty-nine patients randomized to receive placebo, 30 or 60 mg baclofen for 12 
weeks. Both doses of baclofen were beneficial in reducing alcohol-dependent comorbid 
anxiety and are well tolerated without any serious adverse events (Morley et al., 2014). In an 
another clinical trial, baclofen has been investigated to reduce craving, voluntary alcohol 
intake and withdrawal syndrome of alcoholic patients. Sixty-seven outpatients enrolled in 
this study were examined during 3 months after treatment initiation. Baclofen was 
administered by the oral route. Craving level was assessed by the Obsessive-Compulsive 
Drinking Scale (OCDS). A population pharmacokinetic (PK) pharmacodynamic analysis of 
the OCDS variation following baclofen administration was performed. Demographic data, 
biological data, and tobacco consumption were evaluated for their influence on the outcome 
parameter. Baclofen treatment decreased craving in all patients, however, there was a wide 
interindividual variability in response (Imbert et al., 2015). Previously randomized, placebo-
controlled trials with low-to-medium doses of baclofen (30–60 mg) showed inconsistent 
results, but case studies suggested a dose-response effect with positive outcomes in patients 
on high doses of baclofen (up to 270 mg). Its prescription was permitted temporarily for the 
treatment of alcohol dependence (AD), now it is widely prescribed in France. It has been 
reported that although adverse events were frequent, they were generally mild and transient. 
One medication-related serious adverse event occurred in the high-dose baclofen group, 
suggesting a large-scale prescription of baclofen for the treatment of AD seems premature 
and should be reconsidered (Beraha et al., 2016).

Similarly, limited clinical trials and case-reports yielded conflicting results regarding the 
efficacy of baclofen (a GABAB agonist) in the treatment of alcohol dependence. A double-
blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted in Israel comparing 50 
mg/day of baclofen or placebo over 12 weeks, in addition to a standard psychosocial

intervention program with 26-week and 52-week follow-up observations. No inter-group 
differences were found in the percentages of heavy drinking and abstinent days. A 
significant reduction in levels of distress, depression and craving with improved HRQL 
occurred for both arms, whereas self-efficacy and social support remained unchanged in 
both groups. Unlike previous positive trials in Italy and a negative trial in the USA, they 
found no evidence of superiority of baclofen over placebo (Ponizovsky et al., 2015). 
Furthermore, Reynaud et al, recently reported that baclofen (180 mg/day) did not 
significantly improve alcohol abstinence in a clinical study consisting of 320 alcohol-
dependent patients (i.e., 158 baclofen-treated patients and 162 placebo group) for 7-week 
titration followed by 17-weeks maintenance baclofen doses, although there was a tendency 
for reduced alcohol consumption and craving assess by Obsessive-Compulsory Drinking 
Scale in baclofen-treated patients. These reports with mixed outcome results suggest that 
more trials are needed to either verify or discard a possible clinical efficacy of baclofen for 
alcohol dependence (Reynaud et al., 2017).

Ondansetron—Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with low affinity to 
dopamine receptors, approved by FDA in the year 1991 and sold under the trade name 
Zofran. It is generally used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy 
and radiation therapy in many cancer patients. It is also used by the pregnant women for 
morning sickness.

The effects of ondansetron (0 – 0.01mg/kg) and topiramate (0 – 10mg/kg) were evaluated 
alone or in combination for the treatment of alcohol dependence in alcohol preferring (P) 
rats and Wistar rats (N=20 each) in a 24 hrs access free choice paradigm. Acute 
administration of topiramate alone or in combination reduced alcohol consumption in heavy 
drinking P rats but not in lighter-drinking P rats and Wistar rats, suggesting that combination 
of topiramate and ondansetron has a potential to treat relapse and alcohol drinking in heavy 
alcohol drinkers (Lynch et al., 2011). In another study, the mechanisms of ondansetron 
(0.001mg/kg) and topiramate (10mg/kg)-mediated beneficial effects through modulation of 
alcohol’s reinforcing effects in male alcohol preferring (P) rats (N=22) responding for 
alcohol under a progressive-ratio (PR), with acute treatment for one day and chronic 
administration for ten days, were examined. Low dose acute treatment with topiramate and 
ondansetron similarly reduced PR responding for alcohol following acute treatment and 
during initial phase of chronic treatment, however, repeated administration with the 
combination showed sustained reduction of alcohol suggesting that combination of 
topiramate and ondansetron produced a sustained reduction in alcohol’s reinforcing effects 
(Moore et al., 2014).

Recently, ondansetron has been shown to decrease alcohol consumption in patients with 
AUDs. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 217 patients who 
received ondansetron 1, 4 and 16 μg/kg twice a day for 11 weeks showed fewer drinks in 
comparison to placebo control (Johnson et al., 2000). They suggested that 4 μg/kg 
ondansetron twice a day was effective in patients with early onset alcoholism and craving 
(Johnson et al., 2002). In an open-label study, Kranzler et al. also reported that 4 μg/kg 
ondansetron twice a day was suitable for the treatment of alcohol dependence in early-onset 
alcoholics (Kranzler et al., 2003). A higher dosage of ondansetron (16 μg/kg twice a day)

combined with cognitive behavior therapy decreased depression, anxiety, and hostility 
(Johnson et al., 2003). In another randomized trial, men taking ondansetron (8 mg twice per 
day) had fewer heavy drinking days compared with those taking placebo, although they did 
not have increased abstinence rates. The combination of ondansetron (4 μg/kg twice a day) 
and naltrexone (25 mg twice a day) may be effective in treating early AUD (Correa-Filho et 
al., 2013).

Nalmefene—Is an opiate derivative similar to opioid antagonist naltrexone, sold under the 
trade name Selincro and Nalmetrene. It has numerous potential pharmacological advantages 
in comparison to naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Nalmefene has a 
longer half-life, greater oral bioavailability and no dose dependent liver toxicity compared to 
naltrexone.

Recently nalmefene was reported to prevent alcohol-induced neuroinflammation and 
preference alcohol drinking in PND35 (TLR4 knockout) female adolescent mice in 
comparison to wild type adolescent mice. Nalmefene (0.1mg/kg, i.p) was given following 
CIE ethanol exposure for two consecutive days and astroglial cells were used to study the 
TLR4 mediated pro-inflammatory immune signaling. Nalmefene treatment prevented the 
upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-β, IL-17A, TNFα) and chemokines 
(MCP-1, MIP-1, KC) and other mediators (iNOS, COX-2) inhibiting apoptotic events in 
PFC and NAc. In addition, nalmefene also inhibited the alcohol-induced escalation of 
alcohol preference and intake, suggesting that nalmefene reduces neuroinflammation by 
blocking pro-inflammatory TLR4 response in modulating alcohol drinking (Montesinos et 
a., 2017).

Previously the effects of nalmefene and other opioid agonist were evaluated in male Wistar 
rats that self-administer ethanol in standard operant conditioning method or exposed to 4-
week intermittent ethanol vapor exposure for 14 hours per day for 4 weeks. After confirming 
the alcohol dependence, nalmefene (0 – 0.1mg/kg, s.c) and naltrexone (0 – 1mg/kg, s.c) 
were administered to Wistar rats. The results revealed that nalmefene and naltrexone 
induced a significant dose-dependent decrease in the number of lever presses in both groups 
of animals, however, in alcohol-dependent animals, nalmefene was significantly effective in 
reducing alcohol intake suggesting that k-opioid receptors are involved in alcohol 
dependence-induced ethanol self-administration that dysregulate dynorphin/k-opioid 
receptors (Walker & Koob, 2008).

In an outpatient study, individuals suffering from AUD were given 18 mg of nalmefene per 
day for 24 weeks and the changes in heavy drinking days (HDDs), total alcohol 
consumption (TAC, grams/day) and the changes in drinking risk level and craving 
(obsessive-compulsive drinking scale and visual analogue scale for craving) were measured. 
Among them, 64% of individuals, who had one or more stabilized psychiatric comorbidity, 
showed significant reduction in HDDs, TAC and craving measures with no differences 
between subjects with and without psychiatric comorbidity (Di Nicola et al., 2017). 
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) symptoms in AUD patients have been reported to 
improve by using nalmefene. Eight-weeks of nalmefene treatment reduced alcohol 
consumption in individuals with BPD and comorbid AUD (Martin-Blanco et al., 2017).

Previously, Mason et al, have shown that treatment with nalmefene was effective in 
preventing relapse to heavy drinking in comparison to placebo. In a double-blind placebo-
controlled trial, patients were given two doses of oral nalmefene (20- or 80-mg/day for 12 
weeks) for alcohol dependence. Placebo treated patients showed significant relapse to heavy 
drinking (2.4 times greater) in comparison to nalmefene treated subjects (Mason et al., 
1999).

These preclinical animal models have shown promising results in evaluating other 
medications and cannot draw any negative conclusions on their efficacy. For example, the 
α-2 adrenoreceptor agonists such as clonidine and lofexidine were translated in human 
studies against stress-induced drug craving (Mantsch et al., 2016; Sinha et al., 2011). 
Similarly, gabapentin reduced both the anxiogenic-like behavior and the increased ethanol 
self-administration observed in withdrawn, ethanol-dependent rats, but not non-dependent 
rats (Roberto et al., 2008; Besheer et al., 2016). Recently, the glucocorticoid receptor 
antagonist mifepristone reduced ethanol intake in alcohol dependent rodents during 
abstinence but not in non-alcohol dependent rodents (Yang et al., 2008; Simms, et al., 2012; 
Vendruscolo et al., 2012). In addition, mifepristone was reported to reduce alcohol-cued 
craving in the laboratory-based study as well as in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
in alcohol-dependent human subjects. Individuals who received mifepristone (600 mg/day, 
orally for one week) exhibited a substantial decrease in alcohol-cued craving and alcohol 
consumption during the one week of treatment phase and one week post-treatment phase 
(NCT01548417 - Clinicaltrials.gov; Vendruscolo et al., 2015). Thus, all of these preclinical 
models and clinical trial do show predictive sensitivity to determine effective treatments. 
Recently, Palpacuer et al performed a meta-analysis of double-blind RCTs to assess the 
efficacy of AUD medications such as nalmefene, naltrexone, acamprosate, baclofen and 
topiramate in non-abstinent adults diagnosed with AUD. Thirty-two RCTs involving 6036 
patients data were analyzed for total alcohol consumption (TAC). Based on these analysis, 
they conclude that there is no reliable evidence of pharmacologically controlled drinking for 
the treatment of patients suffering from alcohol dependence or AUD. They showed low to 
medium efficacy in reducing alcohol drinking with variable and inconsistent results and 
sometimes with more adverse effects (Palpacuer et al., 2017).

4. Novel AUD Medications and their Signaling Pathways

We now focus on the novel medications and their signaling mechanisms by which they exert 
their effects on AUDs. These novel medications were developed to minimize the alcohol 
induced side effects and improve the quality of life. These groups of medications include 
novel as well as FDA-approved medications that are being repurposed for the prevention and 
treatment of AUDs. In some studies, the combination of these drugs was reported to exhibit 
potent effects than when they are used alone. The drug combination strategy appears 
promising for AUD treatment and other behavioral deficits. The following medications are 
in different phases of clinical trials and have a great potential for the treatment of the AUD 
(Figure -2). These candidate compounds are listed below.

4.a - Corticotropin-releasing factor-1

Corticotropin-releasing factor-1 (CRF1), is an endogenous peptide hormone, released in 
response to various chronic stressors and affect many physiological functions. The CRF1 
receptor antagonists have been developed and were tested in many preclinical studies 
showing strong signs of potential clinical efficacy. For instance, antalarmin (10 μm/L), 
NIH-3 (10 μm/L) and R121919 (1 μm/L) the three CRF1 receptor antagonists blocked 
ethanol-induced GABA release in both naïve and ethanol-dependent rats in central amygdala 
(CeA) GABAergic neurons. Intra-CeA administration of a CRF1 antagonist reversed 
dependence-related elevations in extracellular GABA and blocks ethanol-induced increases 
in GABA in both ethanol-dependent and naive rats. Chronic CRF1 antagonist treatment 
blocked withdrawal-induced increases in alcohol drinking by dependent rats and tempered 
moderate increases in alcohol consumption by nondependent rats in intermittent testings 
(Roberto et al., 2010). In another study, by using a two-bottle choice paradigm, the effect of 
the stressor and CRF on ethanol deprivation-induced ethanol intake and anxiety-like 
behavior in alcohol-preferring P rats was evaluated. Injection of SSR125543 (10 μg) into the 
NAc inhibited the restrain stress-induced voluntary alcohol intake without affecting anxiety-
like behavior, whereas injection into the amygdala or dorsal root neurons prevented the 
anxiety-like behavior and did not affect drinking (Knapp et al., 2011). In contrast, by using 
the 20% ethanol intermittent access model of Sardinian alcohol-preferring P rats, Sabino and 
her colleagues have shown that alcohol consumption was decreased by naltrexone and SCH 
39166 (a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist), but not by R121919, indicating that this 
reduction in alcohol consumption was due to opioid- and dopamine-receptor mediated, but 
not due to CRF1 system (Sabino et al., 2013). In agreement with this study, Giardino & 
Ryabinin also reported that CRF1 receptor antagonists did not exert specific effects on 
ethanol intake in the drinking-in-dark (DID) model of binge alcohol consumption. Treatment 
of C57BL/6J mice with CRF1-selective antagonists CP-376395 (10 to 20 mg/kg i.p.) or NBI 
27914 (10 to 30 mg/kg, i.p) have shown some nonspecific increase of sucrose (10%) intake 
and alcohol (15%) decrease in the presence of pharmacological and genetic disruption of 
CRF1 activity (Giardino & Ryabinin, 2013).

Despite the encouraging results that were obtained in preclinical animal studies, a series of 
disappointing clinical results have been reported in the past two decades where the number 
of CRF1 receptor antagonists failed to successfully complete the double-blind, placebo-
controlled trials of stress-related psychiatric disorders (Shaham & De Wit, 2016; Sanders & 
Nemeroff, 2016; Spierling & Zorilla, 2017). Pexacerfont (an oral, brain penetrant CRH 
antagonist), with positive results in animal models (Gehlert et al., 2007), did not show any 
significant effects in human clinical trials. Kwako et al, evaluated pexacerfont to suppress 
stress-induced alcohol craving and brain responses in treatment seeking alcohol-dependent 
patients in early abstinence. Alcohol-dependent patients enrolled in a double blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled study at the NIH Clinical Center were given pexacerfont 
300 mg/day for 7 days, followed by 100 mg/day for 23 days and assessed for alcohol craving 
in response to stressful and alcohol related cues. Pexacerfont treatment did not show any 
positive effects on alcohol craving, emotional responses and anxiety (Kwako et al., 2015). In 
a recent paper, Spierling & Zorilla reviewed possible reasons for the lack of effect in the 
human studies that include poor safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and physicochemical

properties of the initial drugs, specificity problems with preclinical screens, the acute nature 
of screens vs late presenting patients, and positive preclinical results limited to certain 
models (Spierling & Zorilla, 2017).

5.b. α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist

Prazosin—[4-(4-Amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl)-1-piperazinyl](2-
furyl)methanone], is an α-1 adrenoceptor antagonist and sold under the trade names 
Minipress, Vasoflex, Lentropes, and Hypovase. It has been used to treat high blood pressure 
and PTSD (FDA, 2015; Prazosin-IUPHAR, 2016). It is also used for treating urinary 
hesitancy associated with prostatic hyperplasia. The antihypertensive characteristics of 
prazosin makes it a second-line choice (Shen, 2008) after thiazide diuretics such as 
chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide (Medical Letter Inc, 2012), for the treatment of high 
blood pressure. The common side effects include dizziness, headache, drowsiness, 
weakness, palpitations and nausea. Another side effect could be orthostatic hypotension, 
especially after the first dose.

Previously it has been shown that blockade of α-1 adrenergic receptors suppresses excessive 
alcohol consumption after acute withdrawal in ethanol-dependent rats. In ethanol-dependent 
animals, prazosin (1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg) was effective in suppressing alcohol consumption, 
suggesting the involvement of noradrenergic receptors in the excessive alcohol drinking 
during acute withdrawal in ethanol-dependent rats (Walker et al., 2008). In nondependent 
rats, only 2.0 mg/kg dose was effective and at 0.25 mg/kg doze prazosin mediates anxiolytic 
effect on ethanol self-administration in nondependent rats. In general, stress-induced anxiety 
is a major risk factor for reinstatement to alcohol drinking. Medications such as SSRI and 
SNRI inhibitors, buspirone, benzodiazepines, diphenhydramine, propranolol, tamoxifen, 
prazosin, doxazosin, that help to block the stress-induced anxiety may also reduce alcohol 
consumption. Among them, prazosin and doxazosin are known medications for the 
treatment of high blood pressure. Prazosin (1.0 or 1.5 mg/kg, i.p) or vehicle was 
administered in alcohol preferring (P) rats and anxiety-like behavior was measured. 
Prazosin, given before stresses in the first two cycles of alcohol withdrawal, prevented 
increased anxiety-like behavior during the third alcohol deprivation, suggesting prior 
treatment of prazosin may prevent the increased anxiety during subsequent deprivation/
abstinence that is a risk factor for relapse to alcohol drinking (Rasmussen et al., 2017). 
Prazosin showed promising results in treating alcoholism by blocking α-1 adrenoreceptors 
in rats. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of prazosin (2 and 6 nmol) or 
systemically (1 mg/kg) on antagonist yohimbine (1.25 mg/kg)-induced reinstatement of 
alcohol craving in rats was assessed by using footshock stress. Yohimbine-induced 
reinstatement of alcohol seeking was reduced substantially by the ICV and systemic 
prazosin (50 and 69 % decreases) respectively. Similar results were obtained by employing a 
long-acting α-1 antagonist doxazosin that effectively block yohimbine-induced 
reinstatement of alcohol (Funk et al., 2016). In another study, long term treatment with a low 
dose of prazosin or duloxetine significantly decreased ethanol self-administration in adult 
male Long-Evans rats. Chronic infusion of prazosin (0.78 – 1.5mg/day for 8–10 weeks) and 
duloxetine (0.75 – 1.5mg/day for 8–10 weeks) decreased ethanol self-administration after 
three and four weeks of infusion indicating that chronic, but not acute treatment with low

doses of putative inhibitors of α-1 adrenoreceptor and SNR1 may attenuate alcohol intake 
and reduce anxiety-like behavior after stress (Skelly & Weiner, 2014).

Simpson et al. reported that in a six-week double-blind randomized controlled pilot clinical 
trial, patients receiving 4 – 8 mg of prazosin showed greater reduction in percent days of 
drinking per week, however it did not show beneficial effects on PTSD symptoms (Simpson 
et al., 2015). In contrast, in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, ninety-six veterans 
with PTSD and comorbid alcohol dependence received prazosin (16 mg) for 13 weeks. Even 
though symptoms of PTSD, sleep disturbances and alcohol consumption decreased over 
time, however, prazosin was not effective in treating either PTSD symptoms, improving 
sleep, or reducing alcohol consumption suggesting that comorbid condition affects the 
efficacy of prazosin (Petrakis et al., 2016).

Previously, a double-blind, placebo-controlled random trial consisting of seventeen alcohol 
dependent patients received prazosin (16 mg/day, over 4 weeks). All patients were exposed 
to 5-minute guided imagery, stress, alcohol cue, and neutral-relaxing/control conditions per 
day. When assessed, the prazosin group showed significantly lower alcohol craving, anxiety, 
and negative emotion following stress exposure, suggesting the beneficial effects of prazosin 
on decreasing stress- and cue-induced alcohol craving and normalizing the stress 
dysregulation associated with early recovery from alcoholism (Fox et al., 2012). Recently, 
Kenna et al. evaluated the α1-blocker doxazosin, which is similar to prazosin, in rodents and 
alcohol-dependent (AD) patients in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical 
trial by administering 16 mg/day (or maximum tolerable dose). Statistical analysis revealed 
that doxazosin considerably reduced alcohol drinking in AD patients with high family 
history density of alcoholism (FHDA) and by contrast increased drinking in those with low 
FHDA, indicating that doxazosin may be selectively effective in AD patients with high 
FHDA (Kenna et al., 2016). Similarly, the α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist idazoxan was 
evaluated for its role in managing AD patients. In a double-blind, single dose, placebo-
controlled, crossover, randomized human laboratory study, ten social drinkers given 40 mg 
idazoxan or placebo showed reduced the peak blood alcohol level and time to peak in 
comparison to placebo, suggesting that idazoxan may alter the biphasic effects of alcohol by 
decreasing stimulation and increasing sedation (Haass-Koffler et al., 2015)

5.c. Glycine Reuptake Inhibitors

Since glycine is known to elevate extracellular dopamine levels in the NAc and decrease 
alcohol consumption, a highly selective glycine reuptake inhibitor could be used to decrease 
alcohol consumption. Among these glycine reuptake inhibitors, Org-25935, initially 
developed for the treatment for schizophrenia, was studied in male Wistar rats, where it 
significantly decreased the alcohol consumption in a dose-dependent manner with its effects 
sustained for up to 40 days (Molander et al., 2007; Lido et al., 2009).

In another study, NAc glycine modulates basal and ethanol-induced dopamine levels in the 
NAc as well as voluntary ethanol consumption. Systemic administration of the glycine 
transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitor Org-25935 also elevates dopamine levels in the NAc, 
prevents further ethanol-induced dopamine elevation robustly and dose-dependently 
decreased ethanol consumption in rats, providing supporting evidence for the glycine

receptor as an important player in the dopamine reward circuitry and in ethanol’s effects 
within this system (Lido et al., 2011). The same group developed another inhibitor 
Org-24598 which also reduced ethanol intake when it was compared with acamprosate (Lido 
et al., 2012). Overall, both Org-25935 and Org-24598 promoted a robust and long-lasting 
reduction in voluntary alcohol consumption and reversed compulsive relapse-like alcohol 
drinking (Molander et al., 2007; Vengeliene et al., 2010). Org-25935 has demonstrated long-
lasting properties of suppressing alcohol intake in rodent models with effects superior to 
most drug candidates for AUD (Spanagel & Kiefer., 2008). The compound has a good safety 
profile and neither animal studies nor human investigations indicate a positive hedonic 
profile (Liem-Moolenaar et al., 2013).

However, the attempts thus far to translate these promising results to AUD patients failed 
and the proof of concept trial was aborted before completion due to its failure in clinical 
trials as reported in European Union Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT:2006-003080-31). In 
addition, Org-25935 also demonstrated different outcome in different strains of rat models. 
For instance, in Alko-Alcohol (AA) rats Org-25935 reduced both ethanol and water intake 
and induced strong depressive effects on CNS, whereas it reduced alcohol intake in Wistar 
rats. Despite the lack of a successful clinical outcome, there is some interest in further 
studies in the development of a new generation of Gly-1 inhibitors (Lido et al., 2017).

5.d. Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors

Neuroinflammatory signaling pathways in the CNS are of current interest as potential 
pharmacotherapy targets for alcohol dependence. Ibudilast is a neuroimmune modulator that 
inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE)-4 and PDE-10 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor 
(MIF). In a recent study, ibudilast reduced alcohol drinking and relapse in alcohol-preferring 
P rats, high-alcohol drinking HAD1 rats and a mouse model exposed to alcohol vapor. When 
administered twice daily, ibudilast reduced alcohol drinking in rats by approximately 50% 
and it also suppressed drinking in alcohol-dependent mice at doses which showed no effect 
in non-dependent mice. These findings support the usage of ibudilast as a potential treatment 
for alcohol dependent patients (Bell et al., 2016).

A randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled laboratory study was conducted 
to investigate the benefits of ibudilast in 24 nontreatment-seeking individuals with current 
mild-to-severe AUD by measuring the subjective response to alcohol as well as secondary 
measures of cue- and stress-induced changes in craving and mood. After completion of two 
separate 7-day intensive outpatient protocols, and upon reaching a stable target dose, 
ibudilast (50 mg b.i.d) was well tolerated; however, there were no beneficial effects on the 
primary measures of subjective response to alcohol. Ibudilast was associated with mood 
improvements on the secondary measures of stress exposure and alcohol-cue exposure, as 
well as reductions in tonic levels of craving. Exploratory analyses revealed that among 
individuals with higher depressive symptomatology, ibudilast attenuated the stimulant and 
mood-altering effects of alcohol as compared to placebo. Together, these findings extend 
preclinical demonstrations of the potential utility of ibudilast for the treatment of AUD and 
suggest that depressive symptomatology should be considered as a potential moderator of 
efficacy for pharmacotherapies with neuroimmune modulators (Ray et al., 2017).

5.e. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha agonist

In general, the fibrates are a class of medications used to treat hypercholesterolemia and 
dyslipidemia that target nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs. Studies 
have shown the PPARα agonist fenofibrate also decreases voluntary alcohol (ethanol) 
consumption in mice (Blednow et al, 2016a; Ferguson et al., 2014) and rats (Karahnian et 
al., 2014). Other agonists of PPARα are oleoylethanolamide (OEA), palmitoylethanolamide 
(PEA), clofibrate, gemfibrozil; WY14643, and MK886 as an antagonist reported to decrease 
voluntary ethanol consumption (Le Foll et al., 2014). On the other hand, PPARγ agonists 
such as pioglitazone, rosiglitazone and ciglitazone are known to reduce voluntary alcohol 
drinking (Le Foll et al., 2014). Reinforcing and motivational effects of ethanol were studied 
by using various doses of fenofibrate (Haile & Kosten, 2017). Fenofibrate (25, 50 and 100 
mg/kg) in rats showed fenofibrate dose-dependently decreased ethanol self-administration 
providing further evidence for fenofibrate as a potential treatment for AUD in humans. The 
PPARα and γ subunits seems to play an important role in reducing the ethanol self-
administration. By using the selective PPARα and α/γ agonists and antagonists, Blednov et 
al. examined the subunit dependence of this action in WT versus null mutant mice lacking 
PPARα. Fenofibrate (a PPARα agonist) and tesaglitazar (a PPARα/γ dual agonist) reduced 
ethanol consumption on continuous and intermittent 2-bottle choice drinking tests in male 
and female WT mice but not in male mice lacking PPARα, suggesting that PPARα plays an 
important role in decreased alcohol consumption (Blednov et al., 2016).

Blednov et al, also studied the roles of these PPAR agonists in ethanol-related behaviors and 
other actions such as preference for saccharin, ethanol-induced conditioned place preference 
(CPP), conditioned taste aversion (CTA), loss of righting reflex, and withdrawal, acoustic 
startle reflex, response to novelty, and ethanol clearance. Fenofibrate (150 mg/kg) and 
tesaglitazar (1.5 mg/kg) decreased the novelty response and increased acute ethanol 
withdrawal severity and ethanol-induced CTA. On the other hand, saccharin preference and 
ethanol-induced CPP were not altered, however, ethanol clearance was increased. Response 
to novelty seeking, acute withdrawal, and ethanol clearance showed sex-dependent 
differences and could explain the reduced ethanol consumption following fenofibrate 
administration. Thus, the complexities of ethanol-dependent and ethanol-independent 
behaviors that are altered by PPAR agonists provide evidence for novel behavioral actions of 
these drugs that may contribute to PPAR-mediated effects of alcohol drinking (Blednov et 
al., 2016b).

Previously, this group has demonstrated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of PPAR 
agonists in facilitating the reduced consumption of alcohol in rodents (Ferguson et al., 2014; 
Blednow et al, 2015). They used three PPAR agonists in a continuous access of two-bottle 
choice (2BC) drinking paradigm and found that tesaglitazar (PPARα/γ dual agonist: 1.5 
mg/kg) and fenofibrate (PPARα agonist, 150 mg/kg) decreased ethanol consumption in male 
C57BL/6J mice while bezafibrate (PPARα/γ/β agonist, 75 mg/kg) did not. Comparing the 
unbiased genomic profiles of fenofibrate and tesaglitazar treatment with bezafirate from the 
areas of brain regions known for alcohol dependence, PPAR agonists produced a strong 
neuronal signature in mouse brain. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
(WGCNA) revealed the co-expression of treatment-significant genes and the functional

annotation of these gene networks suggested that PPAR agonists might act via neuropeptide 
and dopaminergic signaling pathways in the amygdala (Ferguson et al., 2014). In another 
study, PPARγ agonists were shown to reduce ethanol drinking in alcohol-preferring rats 
(Stopponi et al., 2011). Based on these reports, the effect of peroxisome proliferator-
activating drugs acting on PPARα and PPARγ appears to be mediated by the potentiation 
effects of activated PPARγ in the brain and PPARα in the liver in reducing ethanol intake in 
animals (Karahanian et al., 2015).

A recently completed randomized, double-blind phase 2 clinical trial (Clinicaltrials.gov; 
NCT02158273) by Barbara et al, have used fenofibrate (TRICOR-145mg/day, oral pill, for 9 
days) in 50 subjects to measure alcohol craving. The four visual analog scale (VAS) 
questions; the intention to drink, loss of control, relief craving and urge intensity were 
measured. These studies did not show significant difference in fenofibrate treatment in 
comparison to control, indicating that despite the encouraging responses in animal studies, 
human studies didn’t reproduce the beneficial effects of fenofibrate (Barbara et al., 2016).

5.f. NMDA receptor antagonist

Memantine, a non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors, (25 mg/kg) abolished ethanol 
self-administration in non-dependent (ND) rats and reduced self-administration by half in 
post-dependent (PD) rats during acute withdrawal. While this effect was observed only 6 
hours after treatment in ND rats, it was long lasting in PD rats (at least 30 hours after 
injection). Furthermore, the results indicated that memantine did not modify the break-point 
for ethanol, suggesting that memantine acts by potentiating the pharmacological effect of 
ethanol but not by reducing the motivation for ethanol. Memantine was also ineffective in 
reducing relapse after protracted abstinence and may be used as a replacement therapy drug, 
but not as relapse-preventing drug (Alaux-Cantin et al., 2015).

Memantine induces expression of BDNF in several brain regions, including the striatum 
(Jeanblanc et al., 2014). Based on the hypothesis that memantine could decrease ethanol 
consumption via activation of the BNDF signaling pathway, memantine was evaluated for 
reduction of self-administering of moderate or high amounts of ethanol (12.5 and 25 mg/kg) 
in Long Evans rats. They reported that memantine decreased ethanol self-administration and 
motivation of alcohol consumption, while inhibition or blockade of the BDNF signaling 
pathway prevented earlier, but not the delayed decrease in ethanol consumption induced by 
memantine. BDNF expression was differentially regulated between the early and delayed 
time-points and an acute injection of memantine specifically reduced ethanol self-
administration and motivation to consume ethanol for at least 30 hours, proposing that the 
BDNF was responsible for the early effect, but the delayed effect was BDNF-independent 
(Jeanblanc et al., 2014).

Acute effects of memantine were evaluated in combination with alcohol in moderate alcohol 
drinkers on alcohol dependence and craving. In a double-blind three day long inpatient 
human study, 18 non-alcohol dependent volunteers were given memantine (0, 15, and 30mg) 
which was administered 4 hours before alcohol (1.5g/l body water) was given. The results 
showed that, memantine pretreatment attenuated the craving for alcohol before alcohol 
administration, but not after alcohol consumption. In addition, memantine did not affect

alcohol-induced performance impairment, physiological changes or pharmacokinetics, 
however it increased dissociative effects, confusion, subjective reports of dissociation and 
impaired motor coordination (Bisaga & Evans, 2004).

A placebo-controlled clinical trial completed by the same group (NCT00246415; 
Clinicaltrials.gov) has used memantine for alcohol dependence. 90 individuals who meet 
DSM-IV criteria for current alcohol dependence were enrolled in this study to evaluate the 
safety and effectiveness of oral memantine (40mg/day) in a 16 weeks with a 12 week 
treatment phase study. Another 16 week double-blind outpatient pilot clinical trial was 
conducted by taking 44 treatment seeking individuals. Among them 34 patients were 
stratified to receive memantine (40mg/day) or placebo and only 27 patients completed the 
entire 16 week trial. The results that emerged from longitudinal analysis showed significant 
reduction in drinks per day and drinks per drinking day, but no difference between the two 
groups. In addition, the percentage of heavy drinking days and rate of abstinent were 
observed in placebo group. Unfortunately, the memantine group had many side effects 
(26%) and had to either decrease the dose or drop out of the study indicating that there are 
negative effects of memantine for the treatment of alcohol dependent patients (Evans et al., 
2007).

5.g. Oxytocin

The effects of oxytocin (OT) have been reported by many laboratories in alcohol addiction 
as well as in some neuropsychiatric disorders and social behaviors (Baskerville & Douglas, 
2010; Lee & Weerts, 2016). OT, a nine amino-acid (AA) peptide, is known to be synthesized 
in the magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular, supraoptic nuclei and the accessory 
magnocellular nuclei of the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary into the 
peripheral circulation. Oxytocin receptor (OTR) is coupled to Gq types of G-protein coupled 
receptor (GPCR) in hypothalamus in the brain (e.g., cortical, limbic, and basal ganglia 
structures) where it exerts a variety of behavioral effects (Lee et al., 2016).

Recent studies have shown that OT influences a number of behavioral and physiological 
effects of alcohol, including tolerance, withdrawal, and motivational effects (Lee & Weerts, 
2016). Systemic administration of OT reduces alcohol preference and intake in a variety of 
drinking models in rats (MacFadyen et al., 2016) and mice (King et al., 2017). Bowen et al 
has demonstrated that OT specifically attenuates ethanol-induced motor impairment via 
GABAergic activity at δ-GABAA receptor (α4β1δ and α4β3δ) subunits without activating 
OTR. OT (1μg, i.c.v) given ahead of ethanol (1.5/kg, i.p) attenuated ethanol-induced 
sedation and ataxia in the open field locomotor test. The inhibitory effect of oxytocin on the 
δ subunit-containing receptors appeared specific for ethanol, because the potentiating effects 
of a GABAA agonist that binds a different site from ethanol on the δ receptor were 
unaffected by oxytocin either in animal behavior tests or in the Xenopus expression system. 
Because Xenopus oocytes do not have the oxytocin receptor, these data indicate that 
oxytocin exerted its effects independently from the oxytocin receptor and suggest that the δ 
subunit of GABAA may be a target of oxytocin action (Bowen et al., 2015).

Direct injection of OT into the brain ventricles reduced alcohol consumption and alcohol-
induced dopamine efflux in the NAc in rats (Peters et al., 2017). However, only few studies

have examined the role of OTRs in mediating the neuropeptide’s effects on motivational 
actions of alcohol. Recent studies involving viral-mediated overexpression of OTRs in the 
NAc core have implicated a role for these receptors in alcohol drinking and conditioned 
reward (Bahi, 2015; Bahi et al., 2016). McGregor and Bowen, found a long-lasting effect on 
the OT administration on ethanol preference in rats. Indeed, a single dose of OT (1 mg/kg) 
produced a progressive reduction in preference for the ethanol-containing beverage as 
compared to a non-ethanol-containing sweet solution and this effect lasted for up to 6 weeks. 
Additionally, treatment with OT at 1 mg/kg for 2 weeks before the start of a two-bottle free 
choice paradigm provided evidence that there was a significantly lower ethanol preference in 
OT-treated than in control rats (McGregor & Bover, 2012). Modulation of the OTR via 
administration of the OTR agonist carbetocin or gene over-expression of OTRs via a 
lentiviral vector in NAc resulted in reduced acquisition and ethanol-primed reinstatement of 
CPP as well as increased rates of extinction (Bahi, 2015). OT is known to exert stress-
buffering effects, and this may be of relevance to its role in influencing stress-alcohol 
interactions. For example, oxytocin decreases stress-induced HPA axis activation and 
behavioral (anxiety) responses (Neumann et al., 2000; Windle et al., 1997). Peters et al 
2013, carried out the chronic subordinate colony (CSC) housing study to evaluate social 
stress paradigms which is considered as the pre-clinically validated psychosocial stress 
paradigm relevant to human psychiatric disorders. CSC stressed male mice when given 
increasing doses (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8%) of alcohol for 14 days showed a significant increase in 
alcohol consumption. Systemic administration of OT (10mg/kg) or baclofen (2.5mg/kg) 
reduced alcohol consumption, indicating that OT and baclofen attenuated chronic 
psychosocial stress-induced alcohol intake (Peters et al., 2013).

Recent studies have demonstrated OTRs are associated with genetic polymorphisms and 
aggression in humans and animal models (Gerra et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017; Karpova et 
al., 2016). Previously, Pedersen and colleagues in a clinical study demonstrated that 
intranasal OT treatment attenuated alcohol withdrawal symptoms in treatment-seeking 
human subjects compared to placebo (Pedersen et al., 2013). Overall, studies to date suggest 
that OT plays a role in reversing tolerance and in reducing alcohol preference in a persistent 
manner, supporting OT as a potential treatment for AUD both in the short-term to manage 
AWS and in the long-term to reduce the rewarding effects of alcohol. Taken together, there is 
emerging evidence that OT may hold promise as a therapeutic candidate for treating AUDs 
and for stress-related alcohol drinking and relapse.

Ghrelin, the orexigenic peptide, is an appetite-regulating peptide hormone released from the 
gut. Ghrelin controls the homeostatic system balancing energy expenditure and appetite in 
the hypothalamus. It is mainly synthesized and secreted by the entero-endocrine cells of the 
stomach and intestine as a precursor protein, preproghrelin (Tschop et al., 2000). The 
peptide hormone is generated by proteolytic cleavage of preproghrelin and proghrelin to an 
active form with 28-amino acid residues. Only the acetylated form of ghrelin is functional, 
able to cross the blood-brain barrier and activate central growth hormone secretagogue 
receptors (ghrelin receptor- GHS-RIA) in the hypothalamus (Bednarek et al, 2000; 
Koopmann et al., 2012). Ghrelin receptors are highly expressed in hypothalamus and in the

VTA. Expression of GHS-RIA in the hippocampus and substantia nigra, can also act on 
reward circuitry and modulate addictive disorders such as alcohol and tobacco addiction 
(Al’Absi et al., 2014; Koopmann et al., 2015, 2016).

Recent studies have suggested that ghrelin modulates signaling of dopaminergic neurons. 
Preclinical studies also provided support for an important role of ghrelin in the neurobiology 
of addiction-related reward pathways, affecting the self-administration of alcohol and drugs. 
Intermittent access to a nutritionally complete high fat diet attenuates alcohol drinking in 
Long Evans rats (Sirohi et al., 2017). The impacts of binge-like feeding on alcohol intake 
and anxiety-like behavior were modulated by the plasma acyl-ghrelin level that was 
drastically increased in rats fed high fat diet intermittently, and it reduced alcohol intake in 
comparison to sucrose intake (Sirohi et al., 2017). In another study use of GHS-RIA 
antagonist JMV2959 suppressed the alcohol consumption and deprivation effects following 
long term voluntary alcohol consumption. After ten months of high alcohol consumption in 
rats, acute JMV2959 treatment significantly decreased alcohol intake without inducing 
tolerance and prevented the alcohol deprivation effects. In addition, there was a significant 
decrease in GHS-R1A receptor expression in the VTA, proposing that a negative correlation 
between GHS-R1A gene and alcohol intake exists (Suchankova et al., 2013). Kaur & 
Ryabinin have demonstrated similar effects of ghrelin antagonist in decreasing the alcohol 
intake (Kaur & Ryabinin, 2010). C57BL/6J mice, when injected with 400 nmol of [D-Lys3]-
Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide-6 (D-Lys3-GHRP-6, a selective ghrelin receptor 
antagonist) also called as DLS, showed reduced preference to alcohol with decreased 
alcohol intake in comparison to saline-treated control mice. They also showed the decreased 
blood alcohol levels in D-Lys3-GHRP-6 mice compared to control mice.

Animal and human studies have suggested that ghrelin modulates the neurobiology of 
alcohol dependence and alcohol craving (Leggio et al., 2012). In addition, Leggio et al. 
studied the role of ghrelin gene polymorphisms (Arg51Gln and Leu72Met) in alcohol-
dependent individuals and reported the highest frequency of Leu72Met gene polymorphism 
in the alcohol-dependent group, further supporting the role of ghrelin in alcohol seeking 
behavior. In a double-blind placebo-controlled human study, intravenous administration of 
ghrelin 1 μg/kg or 3 μg/kg increased alcohol craving in alcohol-dependent heavy drinking 
individuals (Leggio et al., 2014). In contrast, clinical data failed to support an association 
between ghrelin and alcohol craving, possibly due to the fact that these studies have 
analyzed the pharmacologically inactive, preprohormone ghrelin instead of ghrelin in its 
active, acetylated form (Koopmann et al., 2012).

5.i. Orexin/hypocretin-1 receptor antagonist

Orexins (ORX), which are also called as hypocretins, are neuropeptides produced in the 
lateral hypothalamus regions of the brain and are responsible for appetite, wakefulness and 
arousal (Davis et al., 2011). There are two isoforms of orexins-A and -B or hypocretin-1 and 
-2 with 33 and 28- amino acid residues, respectively, and bind to orexin receptors/hypocretin 
receptors (ORXR-1 and 2 or HCRT1 and 2), a family of G-protein coupled receptors (de 
Lecea et al., 1998: Sakurai et al., 1998). The ORX system plays an important role in sleep 
regulation. Inactive mutation or gene deletion of the ORXR1 results in sleep disorders such

as narcolepsy, or cataplexy (Lin et al., 1999; Chemilli et al., 1999). It is reported that the 
orexigenic neuropeptides secreted in the hypothalamus promote alcohol drinking and affect 
craving, withdrawal and relapse in relation to psychoactive substances. Animal models have 
shown that the expression of orexin mRNA levels increases after alcohol consumption and is 
decreased by using the ORXR1 antagonist SB-334867 (Cason et al., 2010; Merlo Pich & 
Melotto, 2014).

Recent studies have shown that the orexin system is associated with addiction and control 
motivational functions, making it a potential target for the treatment of alcohol and other 
drugs of abuse (Brown et al., 2013a; Mahler et al., 2012; Martin-Fardon & Weiss, 2014). 
ORXR antagonists, such as SB-334867, have shown great potential in reducing alcohol 
intake in laboratory animals (Bentzley & Aston-Jones, 2015; James et al., 2012). In alcohol 
preferring rats, decreased stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking (Richards et al., 
2008) and reduced relapse of alcohol-craving elicited by discriminative stimuli were 
observed (Martin-Fardon & Weiss, 2014). In another study, SB-334867 also decreased 
relapse to alcohol seeking/drinking after home cage deprivation in female alcohol-preferring 
rats when alcohol was available (Dhaher et al., 2010). These beneficial effects were in part 
mediated by the orexin receptor 1 (ORXR1) in the VTA and prelimbic cortex since the 
infusion of SB-334867 into these regions independently decreased cue-induced alcohol 
intake (Brown et al., 2016). Overall, ORXR1 antagonism decreased two-bottled choice 
preference selectively in high alcohol preferring rats (Moorman & Aston-Jones, 2009) and 
GSK1059865 decreased alcohol drinking preferentially in mice after chronic intermittent 
ethanol (CIE) (Lopez et al., 2016). In addition, OX1R antagonist suppressed compulsive-like 
alcohol consumption in C57BL/6 mice (Lei et al., 2016). In another study, VTA and CeA 
have been demonstrated as important regions that regulate ORX1R in binge-like alcohol 
drinking behavior without affecting binge-like sucrose intake, indicating that ORXR circuits 
are specific for alcohol consumption (Olney et al., 2017).

The brainstem nucleus incertus (NI) containing ORXR1 and ORXR2 are implicated in 
stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. However, yohimbine-induced reinstatement 
of alcohol seeking by activating orexinergic neurons in the hypothalamus was reported by 
Kastman et al, 2016. Orexigenic neurons directly innervate and excite NI relaxin-3 neurons 
(Blasiak et al 2015) and ascending relaxin-3 neurons are implicated in alcohol seeking 
(Ryan et al., 2013). In alcohol preferring rats, bilateral injections of the ORXR2 antagonist 
TCS-OX2-29 attenuated yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking via ORXR2 as 
evidenced by the presence of higher levels of ORXR2 protein and mRNA that was 
complemented by the whole cell patch-clamp recordings in coronal rat brain slices. Taken 
together these data suggest that yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking is 
predominantly mediated by ORXR2 receptor (Kastman et al., 2016).

Patients with alcohol dependence treated for relapse prevention showed significantly lower 
levels of ORX in their blood. 32 males suffering from alcohol dependence were enrolled in a 
pilot study. Upon measurement, the alcohol-dependent patients showed significantly higher 
levels of blood ORX than the control group. However, after 4 weeks of abstinence the levels 
of ORX decreased significantly similar to the levels of ORX in control subjects, suggesting 
that ORXR1 are potential target for the relapse prevention treatment and that ORX is a

biomarker of alcohol relapse (Ziotkowski et al., 2016). Previous studies from von der Goltz 
et al, showed the involvement of ORX in the regulation of stress, affectivity and addictive 
behavior. 34 alcohol dependent patients were enrolled in this study and the blood ORX 
levels were measured before and after the 2 weeks of abstinence period. Results showed a 
positive correlation between ORX and global distress indices of the brief symptom inventory 
(BSI). In addition, the ACTH and cortisol levels were detected in the plasma, signifying the 
involvement of ORX in the affective dysregulation seen in alcohol dependent patients during 
alcohol withdrawal (von der Goltz et al., 2011).

5.j. Nicotinic Acetylcholine receptor agonists

Varenicline (VAR), varenicline tartrate, marketed as Chantix and Champix, is a prescription 
medication for the treatment of nicotine addiction. It works as a partial agonist and 
stimulates the nicotine receptors weakly, similar to cytisine, but not like bupropion, an 
agonist of nicotinic receptor which has a strong affinity to the nicotine receptor. According 
to the 2013 Cochrane overview and network meta-analysis, VAR is the most effective 
medication for tobacco cessation and the smokers on VAR are three times more likely to quit 
smoking compared with placebo treatment. It has not been tested in people under 18 years 
old or pregnant women (Coleman et al., 2015), and is considered a class C pregnancy drug, 
with no increased risk of congenital anomalies and malformations (Cressman et al., 2012). 
VAR acts as a full agonist to the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and is a partial agonist 
to the α4β2, α3β4 and α6β2 subtypes (Mihalak et al., 2006; Mineur & Picciotto, 2010; 
Tanuja et al., 2012). In addition, it is a weak agonist to the α3β2 containing receptors and a 
partial agonist for the α4β2 receptors. This α4β2 competitive binding by VAR reduces the 
ability of nicotine to bind and stimulate the mesolimbic dopamine system, like the mode of 
action of buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid addiction (Elrashidi & Ebbert, 2014).

Recently, Froehlich et al, evaluated the effects of naltrexone (NTX) or VAR, alone or in 
combination, to reduce the genetic predisposition toward high alcohol drinking in P rats 
selectively bred for high alcohol intake. When P rats were pretreated with the drug for 2 
weeks prior to onset of alcohol access, only NTX (15.0 mg/kg BW) + VAR (1.0 mg/kg BW) 
in combination blocked the acquisition of alcohol drinking in alcohol-naïve P rats. 
Following termination of drug treatment, NTX + VAR and VAR alone continued to reduce 
alcohol drinking, suggesting that NTX + VAR may be effective in curtailing alcohol 
drinking in individuals with a high genetic risk of developing alcoholism (Froehlich et al., 
2017). Low doses of VAR and NTX, when combined with a single medication, reduced 
alcohol intake in a rodent model of alcoholism. This approach showed the advantage of 
reducing potential side effects associated with each drug. Lowering the dose of NTX and 
VAR in a combined treatment approach, which maintains the efficacy while reducing the 
incidence of negative side effects, may increase patient compliance and improve clinical 
outcomes for alcoholics and heavy drinkers who want to reduce their alcohol intake 
(Froehlich et al., 2016)

In another study, whether the relapse to alcohol-seeking was triggered by re-exposure to an 
alcohol-associated environmental context was examined. Male, Long-Evans rats received 
Pavlovian conditioning sessions in which one auditory conditioned stimulus (CS+) was

paired with 15% ethanol and a second group which did not receive conditioned stimulus (CS
−) was not paired. Ethanol was delivered into a port for oral consumption and port entries 
triggered by each CS were recorded. To stimulate relapse, both cues were subsequently 
presented without ethanol in the prior conditioning context. Systemic VAR (0, 0.5 or 2.5 
mg/kg, i.p) blocked context-induced relapse to alcohol-seeking without affecting the ability 
to make a port entry. Neuropharmacological studies showed that context-induced relapse to 
alcohol-seeking was attenuated by bilateral microinfusion of VAR (0.3 μl/0–3.5μg), in the 
NAc but not in the VTA, indicating that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the 
NAc are critical to this effect (Lacroix et al., 2017).

Thus, VAR has been found to decrease alcohol-motivated behaviors, however, recently the 
aversive events of the drugs have been reported. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled 
preliminary investigation, VAR (0, 1, or 2 mg/day) attenuated alcohol-related increases in 
subjective intoxication and decreases in executive cognitive function. VAR reduced alcohol 
craving and diastolic blood pressure, and increased associative learning, working memory, 
and perceptual motor function, suggesting the safe use of VAR with alcoholic individuals 
meeting the criteria for AUD (Verplaetse et al., 2016). Previously a double-blind placebo 
study examined the effect of VAR on alcohol self-administration in nineteen non-alcohol 
dependent heavy smokers. Results showed that VAR (2mg/kg/day vs placebo) for seven days 
significantly reduced the number of drinks and increased the likelihood of abstaining from 
drinking and attenuated alcohol craving (McKee et al., 2009). In another randomized, 
double-blind 16 week study with heavy drinking smokers (64 adults seeking treatment for 
smoking) were randomized to treatment. In agreement with the findings by other scientists 
(Fucito et al., 2011), VAR significantly decreased alcohol consumption in heavy drinking 
smokers (Mitchell et al., 2012). A multisite double-blind clinical trial (NCT03035708) with 
200 individuals (men and women) with alcohol dependence population of smokers and 
nonsmokers were recruited across five clinical sites and given varenicline 2mg/day for 13 
weeks. Computerized behavioral intervention revealed that the VAR group had significantly 
decreased weekly percent heavy drinking days, drinks per day and alcohol craving in 
comparison to placebo group (Litten et al., 2013).

Recently, Roberts et al. 2017, evaluated the efficacy of VAR in alcoholic subjects who 
reported symptoms of depression. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 60 
adults subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria were enrolled in this trial and given VAR (1–
2mg/kg/day for one week). The results showed that subjects with higher depressive 
symptoms revealed a decrease in alcohol craving and alcohol drinking whereas subjects with 
fewer depressive symptoms reported to drink more suggesting that the levels of depressive 
symptoms moderate the efficacy of VAR (Roberts et al., 2017). VAR also reported to reduce 
cravings and decreases the pleasurable effects of cigarettes and other tobacco products, thus 
helping many tobacco addicts to quit smoking. It is used for smoking cessation and 
suggested to be more effective than bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy as seen in 
meta-analysis (Mills et al., 2009; Cahil et al., 2013; Elrashidi & Ebbert, 2014).

shown that nAChR ligands that target different nAChR subtypes, have different role in 
alcohol and nicotine addiction. These medications include: lobeline and cytisine which are 
small molecule drugs that modulate the brain nicotinic cholinergic system and support 
nAChR-based ligands as promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of alcohol and drug 
dependence (Rahman et al., 2015). In a pre-clinical trial, lobeline, a natural alkaloid derived 
from Lobelia inflate, decreased the preference for alcohol intake through the modulation of 
the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. When assayed for its mutagenic and genotoxic effects (5 
or 10 mg/kg) and ethanol (2.5 g/kg), it was found safe and the biochemical parameters were 
not altered, indicating the safety of lobeline to treat alcohol dependence (da Costa et al., 
2014).

In another study, the effects of cytisine and lobeline, on the status of ethanol drinking by 
HAD-2 rats were investigated. Lobeline treatment (5.0 mg/kg dose) significantly reduced 
ethanol intake tested at all three time points, making the nAChR a promising target of 
pharmacotherapy development for the treatment of alcohol dependence and relapse (Bell et 
al., 2009). Farook et al, evaluated the effects of repeated (continuous and recurring) 
administration of lobeline on alcohol consumption (10% alcohol vs. water) in male 
C57BL/6J mice for alcohol preference using a 2-bottle choice procedure. In agreement with 
the previous report (Bell et al., 2009), lobeline substantially reduced alcohol intake and 
preference during the repeated administration phases, while total fluid intake remained 
unchanged (Farook et al., 2009). Pretreatment with lobeline (4 or 10 mg/kg) or cytisine (1.5 
or 3 mg/kg, s.c) on continuous access drinking, substantially reduced ethanol intake 
drinking-in-the-dark (g/kg) post 2-h and 4-h treatment, in comparison to controls. Neither 
lobeline nor cytisine considerably affected water or sucrose solution (10% w/v) intake 
during drinking-in-the-dark or continuous drinking procedures, in comparison to control 
(Sajja & Rahman, 2011). These two compounds have different pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic properties at the brain nAChRs and modulates ethanol drinking behaviors 
and ethanol-induced dopamine functions in different rodent models. Lobeline was shown to 
have longer-lasting effects on ethanol consumption and metabolized slower than cytisine 
(Tutka & Zatonski, 2006) although cytisine was more potent (1.5mg/kg) and faster acting 
(1–4hrs) in comparison to lobeline dose (5mg/kg) in 3 days (Bell et al., 2009).

In addition, Sajja & Rahman, have shown that cytisine inhibited chronic voluntary ethanol 
intake by inhibiting the levels of striatal ΔFosB up-regulation in C57BL/6J mice as 
demonstrated by behavioral and biochemical methods. Pretreatment with cytisine (0.5 or 1.5 
mg/kg) substantially reduced ethanol intake and preference in both paradigms at 2 hr and 24 
hr post-treatment. Furthermore, cytisine (0.5 mg/kg) significantly attenuated up-regulation 
of ΔFosB in the ventral and dorsal striatum following chronic ethanol consumption in 
intermittent access (IA) and chronic access (CA) paradigms (Sajja & Rahman, 2013). 
Despite the encouraging results in animal models, lobeline and cytisine, were not been used 
for the treatment of AUD in human studies.

mediated behavioral responses to stress. ABT-436, a potent and selective AVP type 1B 
receptor (V1B) antagonist, has been demonstrated to attenuate basal hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) axis activity in humans. It has also exerted favorable effects in rat models of 
alcohol dependence. To further study the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction 
in between ABT-436 and alcohol, Katz et al., (2016) conducted a single-dose clinical study 
in twenty moderate alcohol drinkers. Each individual received the 4 possible combinations 
of a single 1,000 mg ABT-436 dose (or matching placebo) and a single 0.5 g/kg alcohol dose 
(or placebo for alcohol) in a double-blind, randomized, 4-period crossover study. A 
computerized cognitive test battery (CDR System), Bond-Lader Visual Analog Scales scale, 
and a postural stability test were performed. The potential interaction of alcohol with 
ABT-436 and the pharmacological effect of ABT-436 was assessed by measuring serum 
cortisol. ABT-436 treatment reduced serum cortisol levels, however, no pharmacokinetic or 
pharmacodynamic interactions between ABT-436 and alcohol have been reported (Katz et 
al., 2016). Similarly, the effects of ABT-436 on the individuals with major depressive 
disorder (MDD) and its safety on the HPA-axis were evaluated in a one week randomized 
Phase 1b trial. MDD patients received 800mg QD of ABT-436 or placebo for 7 days showed 
improved symptoms suggesting that further clinical studies are required for ABT-436 
antidepressant activity (Katz et al., 2017).

The efficacy of ABT-436 was also evaluated in a 12 week clinical trial with alcohol-
dependent participants. Men and women (n=150) who met criteria for DSM-IV alcohol 
dependence were recruited across four sites. Participants received double-blind ABT-436 
(800 mg/day) or placebo during weeks 2–12. Although the primary outcome, percentage of 
heavy drinking days, was decreased in participants receiving ABT-436 compared with the 
placebo group, it was not statistically significant. Also, participants receiving ABT-436 had 
a substantially greater percentage of abstinent days than those receiving placebo. No 
significant differences were found between treatment groups on any other measures of 
drinking, alcohol craving, or alcohol-related consequences. Smokers receiving ABT-436 
burned significantly fewer cigarettes per week than those receiving placebo. In subgroup 
analyses, participants with relatively higher baseline stress levels responded better to 
ABT-436 than placebo on select drinking outcomes, indicating that there may be of some 
value in future testing medications targeting the vasopressin receptor in high stress, alcohol-
dependent patients (Ryan et al., 2017).

5. Conclusion and Future Directions

In this review, we have systematically reviewed the recent findings that described the 
properties of drugs that have been used, currently are in use and the new drug candidates that 
are repurposed for the treatment of AUDs. These include many FDA-approved drugs such as 
anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and other off-label medications. Some of 
these drugs have shown beneficial outcomes in various stages of clinical trials. Our current 
understanding of the alcohol and drug misuse has expanded during the last decade in terms 
of neural circuitry, behavior, and molecular pathways. Some of the medications showed 
significant potential in animal studies. However, the same medications in clinical trials had 
insignificant effects or sometimes even showed toxic effects resulting in organ injury. Based 
on the data that was reviewed and discussed in this article, newer and novel medications

(Figures -1 & 2) are available in the market for the treatment of AUDs with limited success 
rates and mild to severe side effects. The outcomes of these medications and hormones, both 
positive and negative in humans are summarized in Tables – 1& 2.

This has resulted from the advanced knowledge and experience of the fundamental 
mechanisms of action of alcohol and/or other drugs of misuse, across the diversified 
population. However, several gaps remain to be addressed on certain aspects of complex 
interactions between alcohol and other abused substances as well as genetic and 
environmental factors. For instance, genetic studies have identified several variants 
associated with altered activities of certain enzymes and receptors that are involved in AUDs 
interaction pathways. Based on the genetic and environmental factors, we should consider 
future studies with selectively enriched populations in testing the benefits of drug candidates 
for treating AUDs.

Since, AUDs continue to be a major socioeconomic and health concern all over the world, 
there is an urgent need for conducting more applied, translational research for better 
prevention and treatment strategies that will provide better options for the patients and have 
minimal side effects. Future directions should aim to continue basic and translational 
research to understand underlying mechanisms by which abused substances or misuses 
affect the brain at molecular, cellular and circuitry levels. The identification of common 
neurological mechanisms and their targets will lead to the development of new medications 
and other therapeutics for the targeted interventions in AUDs and other mental disorders.

Fig. 2. 
Schematic diagram showing drugs, hormones and their receptors in the brain inhibiting 
alcohol intake. The FDA-approved medications and others undergoing pre-clinical and 
clinical trials are shown. The inhibitory effects of alcohol intake are mediated through the 
hormone ghrelin, oxytocin and opioid receptors, that are expressed in VTA, NAc, 
hypothalamus and amygdala of the brain. In addition to the FDA-approved drugs, the new 
medications, that exert their effects through interactions with various receptors, including 
GABAA, Glycine and nACh receptors, have therapeutic potentials for the treatment of 
AUDs.
