Systematic 
Review 

Background: There has been much speculation about untoward effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on psychological 
symptoms. OCD may be expected to be especially impacted. Our aim was to distil the current evidence base on 
relationships  between the  pandemic and obsessive-compulsive  symptoms, in  patients, and general population 
samples. 
Methods:  We  conducted  a  rapid  scoping  review,  in  the  form  of  a  systematic  literature  search,  coupled  with 
narrative review. 32 relevant papers were identified. 
Results  and  interpretation:  (1)  A  sizable  proportion  of  people  with  OCD  (but  not  all)  experienced/reported 
symptom worsening during the pandemic, especially during initial restrictions (approximately 20–65 % of cases 
in longitudinal studies); (2) contamination/washing symptoms appeared particularly susceptible; and (3) OCD 
symptoms in general population samples were associated with trait compulsivity and pandemic-related-stress. 
The literature was heterogeneous with various methodological issues being commonplace. 
Future  directions:  The  review  identified  important  unaddressed  issues:  how  should  exposure  based  therapy  be 
adapted during pandemics?  How can  we minimise  harm  from exacerbation  of OCD  in vulnerable  individuals 
arising from public health messaging? Why do some but not all OCD patients experience worsening? And does 
Covid-19 infection affect (or lead to) OCD symptoms?   

1. Introduction 

The Covid-19 pandemic has led to profound changes in the way we 
live. This has included restrictions on movements and a pervasive media 
focus  on  potential  adverse  consequences  of  the  pandemic  on  health. 
Consequently, many organisations, clinicians, and research groups have 
raised  concerns  about  possible  untoward  effects  of  the  pandemic 
(including  restrictions)  on  people  who  have  mental  health  problems 
(Holmes et al., 2020). Concerns have also been raised about potentially 
increased  rates  of  emerging  disorders,  in  those  with  pre-existing  vul-
nerabilities  (Holmes  et  al.,  2020).  Data  from  previous  international 
crises (e.g. Blitz attacks during the 1939–1945 war) and other forms of 
traumatic  experience  (e.g.  childhood  trauma)  indicate  that  some 

individuals  exhibit  resilience  to  untoward  mental  health  effects  of  a 
stressor (or set of stressors), whereas other groups are likely to be more 
vulnerable (Ioannidis et al., 2020; Jones, 2021). Also, it should not be 
assumed that all mental disorders have been impacted by the pandemic 
to the same extent or in the same ways. Impact on people with mental 
health  disorders  is  likely  to  result  from  environmental  (e.g.  stress  or 
other  socioeconomic)  factors  of  the  pandemic  as  well  as  potentially 
direct ‘biological’ effects of the virus itself or via parainfectious mech-
anisms (e.g. inflammatory or other immune processes). 

At the level of mental disorders, there is a priori reason to expect that 
at least a sizable proportion of people with Obsessive-Compulsive Dis-
order (OCD) would experience a worsening of their symptoms due to the 
pandemic;  and  indeed  that  patients  with  this  disorder  may  be

particularly vulnerable (Fineberg et al., 2020b; Fontenelle and Miguel, 
2020). Specifically, the hallmark symptoms of OCD involve unwanted 
intrusive thoughts (obsessions); and/or repetitive habitual acts under-
taken  in  a  ritualistic  fashion  or  in  response  to  obsessions  (American 
Psychiatric Association, 2013). While OCD is heterogeneous, its symp-
toms can be distilled into a relatively small set of common, replicable 
‘symptom  domains’  that  exhibit  relative  stability  over  time:  con-
tamination/cleaning and obsessions/checking are two common types of 
symptomatology (Mataix-Cols et al., 2005). These domains are directly 
relevant to the pandemic, both in terms of Covid-19 being a virus-spread 
disease, and because of the high numbers of (population appropriate) 
health messages about washing hands, being careful with hygiene, and 
minimising contact with others to reduce risk of contamination. Such 
legitimate concerns may exacerbate OCD symptoms for some patients 

(Fontenelle and Miguel, 2020). In addition, there have been reports of 
high  levels  of  depression  during  the  pandemic  (Nochaiwong  et  al., 
2021). OCD and depression are frequently found in the same individual 
and it may be predicted that depression per se could have a worsening 
effect  on  OCD  symptomatology.  As  well  as  considering  how  the 
pandemic  may  have  impacted  OCD  at  the  level  of  disorder,  it  is  also 
highly  relevant  to  consider  subclinical  symptoms  at  the  level  of  the 
general population. It is also possible that direct neuropsychiatric effects 
of  Covid-19  could  contribute  to  symptoms  in  some  individuals.  For 
example, immune and infective processes have been implicated in some 
cases of OCD, if we consider historical cases of encephalitis lethargica; or 
paediatric  autoimmune  neuropsychiatric  disorder  associated  with 
streptococcal infections (Swedo and Grant, 2005; Lutters et al., 2018). 
There have already been a few recent reviews of the effects of Covid-

the  current  study  (e.g.,  Zaccari  et  al.,  2021  considered  only  clinical 
samples and Liu et al., 2021 reviewed a much smaller number of papers). 
The third recent review (Guzick et al., 2021) had a different emphasis 
from the current study. Our current study proposes to highlight the large 

scale  data  focusing  on  OCD  patients  and  their  relationship  to  usual 
sources  of  mental  health  care  during  the  pandemic,  the  role  of  trait 
compulsivity,  what  constitutes  clinically  significant  deterioration  in 
OCD, the public health importance of considering the impact of public 
health messaging on people with OCD, and key areas of focus for future

work.  Therefore,  the  aim  of  this  scoping  review  is  to  distil  the 
evidence-base in terms of relationships between OCD and the Covid-19 
pandemic, and – in contrast to previous literature – to amplify key issues 
that  may  help  inform  policy  makers,  guide  service-provision,  and 
enhance clinical decision-making. 

cross-sectional  relationships  within  the  pandemic  or  longitudinal 
changes  in  symptoms,  or  provided  useful  information  about  clinical 
presentations  of  OCD  patients  in  relation  to  the  pandemic.  We  also 
included papers if they examined direct effects of Covid-19 infection on 
OCD symptoms (new symptoms, or worsening of existing illness). 

2. Methods 

3. Search results 

We used a two-step approach to evaluate the evidence base relating 
the pandemic to OCD symptoms. First, we conducted a systematic re-
view  on  PubMed  in  June  2021  (PubMed  covers  literature  from  1966 
onwards).  Second,  having  identified  relevant  papers,  these  were 
described  in  a  narrative  review  focusing  on  the  most  salient  findings 
capable of addressing the study aim. 

A soft literature search was conducted using PubMed on 19/June/ 
2021, using the terms: (OCD OR compulsive OR obsessive-compulsive) 
AND (Covid OR Covid-19). We refer to the literature search as a ‘soft 
search’  as  although  it  used  a  pre-specified  search  string,  it  was  not 
designed to be exhaustive, nor did it involve pre-registration. Rather, it 
was designed to enable rapid scoping of the available literature. Papers 
were  included  if  they  examined  OCD  symptoms  in  OCD  patients  or 
general population samples during the pandemic, and either addressed 

The initial search yielded 231 results. On reading abstracts, 92 were 
excluded  as  not  being  relevant.  From  the  remaining  139  papers,  the 
following  were  excluded  after  inspection  of  written  content,  for  the 
specified reasons: 62 were deemed not relevant (e.g. OC symptoms were 
not  a  main  focus  of  the  paper,  involved  out-of-scope  samples,  or  the 
paper  could  not  directly  address  the  current  study  aim),  13  did  not 
quantify OCD reasonably appropriately (e.g. use of measures not specific 
or validated for OCD), 1 was purely descriptive, 21 were found to be 
review papers/editorials/letters, 10 did not provide significant insights, 
and 3 were excluded due to having very small samples (<10 subjects). 
Three additional directly relevant ‘in press’ papers were identified. This 
resulted in a total of 32 papers of particular interest, which are presented 
in Tables 1–4 below, categorised by methodological approach and focus.

4. Narrative overview 

symptoms (Matsunaga et al., 2020). 

4.1. Longitudinal studies in OCD patients 

Nine  studies  were  identified  that  examined  symptoms  in  OCD  pa-
tients during the pandemic with at least two time points, either using a 
within-subject  design  or  large  scale  design  in  potentially  different 
samples. 

Scale 

(YBOCS), 

In a study of treatment-seeking patients with a primary diagnosis of 
OCD, conducted in Iran, previously assessed patients were re-contacted 
during  the  pandemic  (during  the  first  Covid-19  ‘wave’)  (Khosravani 
et al., 2021). A total of 270 patients responded from 764 invited (35.3 
%) and who had previously been assessed. Self-report measures of OCD 
including  the  self-report  Yale-Brown 
symptoms  were  collected 
Obsessive-Compulsive 
Dimensional 
Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS). Paired t-tests indicated that total 
OCD severity scores (including DOCS sub-scores for contamination, re-
sponsibility  for  harm,  unacceptable  thoughts,  and  symmetry)  signifi-
cantly increased from pre-pandemic to during the pandemic. To give an 
example, average total YBOCS went from a mean of 19.6 (SD 9.1) to 28.7 
(SD 8.2), indicative of a substantial clinical worsening. These changes 
were associated, in regression modelling, with another measure quan-
tifying  stress  response  regarding  pandemic  impact  (Khosravani  et  al., 
2021)  –  suggesting  that  the  changes  were  related  (i.e.  a  substantial 
amount  of  change  was  related  to)  to  the  perceived  pandemic  stress 
response. 

and 

In OCD outpatients in Italy who had attended clinic in the six-months 
prior to quarantine, and who were already receiving stable pharmaco-
logical  treatment,  interviews  were  conducted  6-weeks  after  the  lock-
down began (Davide et al., 2020). The 30 OCD patients who participated 
showed a significant worsening of YBOCS scores from pre-pandemic to 
during the pandemic – this was significant for YBOCS obsessions, com-
pulsions,  and  total  scores.  For  example,  the  mean  total  YBOCS  score 
changed from average of 16.0 [SD 8.0] to 20.5 [SD 8.5], indicative of 
some  degree  of  clinical  worsening.  In  multivariate  modelling,  higher 
deterioration  in  symptom  severity  was  significantly  associated  with 
pre-quarantine  contamination symptoms, living with  a relative in the 
same house during quarantine, and remission status prior to the quar-
antine. The latter result suggests that OCD patients whose symptoms had 
previously remitted may have been more susceptible to re-developing 
clinically marked symptoms during the pandemic. 

In  a  longitudinal  study  using  pooled  data  from  three  case-control 
cohorts  in  The  Netherlands,  questionnaire  data  were  collected  from 
1517 responders around first lockdown, of whom 78 % had a lifetime 
OCD,  anxiety,  or  depressive  disorder  (Pan  et  al.,  2021).  The  study 
included  controls  (i.e.  those  without  those  disorders)  but  the  group 
differed  from  cases  on  a  number  of  variables  e.g.  age,  gender,  and 
educational level. OCD patients were recruited from mental health-care 
institutions, and had received historical assessments albeit some years 
previously. Number and chronicity of disorders were linked to higher 
self-perceived mental health impact of the pandemic. However, loneli-
ness and anxiety scores did not significantly change from pre-pandemic 
to during the pandemic in the OCD participants, nor generally in the 
other diagnostic groups, in statistical modelling (Pan et al., 2021). The 
anxiety  measure  was  not  OCD-specific.  Potential  changes  in  OCD 
symptom  severity  specifically  was  not  documented  using  a  suitable 
instrument. 

In a Japanese study, 60 patients who had experienced full or partial 
remission from OCD were recruited, and their symptoms were descrip-
tively compared from pre-pandemic to during the pandemic (Matsunaga 
et al., 2020). Mean total YBOCS scores changed from 12.2 (SD 2.2) to 
13.0 (2.3) in previously partially remitted individuals; and from 5.5 (SD 
1.4) to 5.7 (SD 1.5) in the previously fully remitted patients. However, 6 
patients were found to have experienced a marked deterioration during 
the pandemic, and all had notable contamination/washing symptoms, 
apart  from  1  patient  who  had  symmetry  /  repeating  /  ordering 

Sharma and colleagues conducted a relatively large study in India 
with  two  groups  of  participants  who  were  mostly  receiving  stable 
treatments:  240  OCD  patients  with  a  follow-up  during  the  pandemic 
(conducted approximately two months after the World Health Organi-
zation  confirmed  Covid-19  pandemic  status);  and  207  historical  OCD 
patients with a follow-up prior to the pandemic (Sharma et al., 2021). 
The clinical assessments were particularly rigorous, and the two groups 
were  well-matched  on  demographic  and  clinical  baseline  characteris-
tics.  Approximately  20  %  of  each  group  experienced  a  relapse  of 
symptoms between initial and follow-up assessment, and this rate did 
not  differ  significantly  between  the  groups.  Similarly,  linear  mixed 
modelling  did  not  find  evidence  that  the  pandemic  had  differentially 
impacted  symptom  severity  trajectories  versus  the  reference  group 
(Kaveladze et al., 2021). 

Schwartz-Lifshitz et al. recruited young people (aged 8(cid:0) 18y) with 
OCD referred to an outpatient department in Israel in the preceding year 
(Schwartz-Lifshitz  et  al.,  2021).  Follow-up  during  Covid-19  was  con-
ducted using telephone calls, with input from parents when appropriate. 
Fifty individuals were identified, of whom 29 participated in the study. 
The  authors  reported  no  significant  change  in  symptom  severity  as 
measured using CGI Severity and Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory Child 
Version  (OCI-CV)  total  scores;  there  was  some  evidence  on  CGI 
Improvement  and  functioning  scales  that  more  participants  reported 
improvement rather than deterioration, when analyses were conducted 
using a categorical approach (Schwartz-Lifshitz et al., 2021). 

In  research  conducted  at  an  academic  psychiatric  department  in 
Turkey,  young  people  (aged  6(cid:0) 18  years)  were  identified  from  their 
medical records who had previously been diagnosed with OCD and for 
whom  pre-Covid  measures  of  OCD  symptoms  were  available  (Tanir 
et al., 2020). Sixty-one individuals were included and 29 were excluded 
(due to lack of the necessary previous measures or other reasons). Par-
ticipants and/or their parents were interviewed via telephone or online, 
during the first period of the pandemic. The authors reported that 54.1 
%  of  OCD  patients  had  an  increase  in  symptom  severity  (Children’s 
YBOCS  [CY-BOCS]  and  Clinical  Global  Impression  Severity  [CGI-S]), 
34.4  %  reported  no  change,  and  11.4  %  reported  a  decrease  in 
severity. Comparing scores from pre-pandemic to during the pandemic, 
CY-BOCS obsessions, compulsions, and total scores were all significantly 
higher during the pandemic. When examining changes in specific OCD 
symptom domains, contamination obsessions increased significantly, as 
did  cleaning/washing  compulsions,  but  the  other  OCD  symptom  do-
mains did not (Tanir et al., 2020). In multivariate modelling, change in 
CY-BOCS total scores was significantly related to talking/searching in 
the  social  environment  about  Covid-19,  being  preoccupied  with 
Covid-19, longer duration of OCD diagnosis, and diagnosis of OCD in 
someone familiar. 

In a study from Israel, Carmi et al. (2021) followed 113 OCD patients 
treated with Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) and pharmaco-
therapy  for  6  months  during  the  pandemic  (Carmi  et  al.,  2021).  In-
dividuals were recruited around the first peak of the pandemic, and were 
evaluated at 2 months and again at 6 months. The majority of patients 
(84 % at 2 months and 96 % at 6 months) reported that the pandemic 
had  not  been  associated  with  worsening  of  their  therapeutic  course, 
based on retrospective recall. Note these figures do not relate to longi-
tudinal data but rather retrospective recall on a cross-sectional basis. 

Alonso  et  al.  (2021)  conducted  clinical  interviews  and  ratings 
(Y-BOCS) in 127 OCD patients contacted during the pandemic in Spain 
(around first peak) (Alonso et al., 2021). Patients were receiving treat-
ment  through  a  specialist  outpatient  clinic  (including  stable  medica-
tion),  and  the  response  rate  (i.e.  proportion  of  patients  entering  the 
analysis of those contacted) was excellent (127 out of 136). 65.3 % of 
patients had a worsening of OCD symptoms during the pandemic, with 
31.4 % experiencing an increase of >25 % from pre-pandemic Y-BOCS 
scores. The average change in Y-BOCS across the sample was 2.7 points, 
and around 7.0 points in those who did report a notable worsening. In 

NeuroscienceandBiobehavioralReviews132(2022)1086–10981091J.E. Grant et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

regression  modelling,  symptom  worsening  during  the  pandemic  was 
statistically  predicted  by  the  following  pre-pandemic  measures:  pres-
ence  of  contamination/washing  symptoms,  more  severe  OCD  and 
depression symptoms, and lower perceived social support (Alonso et al., 
2021). 

4.2. Longitudinal studies in general population samples 

Five  studies  were  identified  that  examined  obsessive-compulsive 
phenomena (diagnostic label and/or symptoms) in general population 
samples (i.e. samples not focusing deliberately on a clinical cohort). 

At  the  University  of  Padua,  Italy,  students  were  contacted  to  take 
part in ‘ECOS’ study (Eating, Compulsive, and Obsessive Symptoms in 
young adults) during the pandemic – they had provided self-report data 
six months previously, and the new data were collected during and after 
lockdown (Meda et al., 2021). OCD symptoms were assessed using the 
Obsessive Compulsive Inventory Revised (OCI-R) in a total of 358 stu-
dents. The authors reported that OC symptoms (as measured using the 
OCI-R)  were  not  significantly  different  between  pre-pandemic  and 
during the pandemic, but did reduce significantly after lifting of lock-
down; similar results were observed for anxiety symptoms (Meda et al., 
2021).  In  contrast,  depression  scores  did  show  a  significant  increase 
during lockdown. 

University students in China participated in a study in three waves: 
one wave conducted during the winter break at a time of a high quar-
antine  level;  a  second  wave  conducted  during  online  teaching  with 
moderate quarantine levels; and a third wave conducted when students 
continued to learn at home but with quarantine levels being relatively 
low  (Ji  et  al.,  2020).  OCD  symptoms  were  quantified  using  the 
self-report YBOCS. There were 4006 participants who provided data at 
all three time points. The average Y-BOCS score at each time point in the 
sample was 7.9 (SD 5.5), 4.7 (SD 4.9), and 4.3 (SD 4.9) –  these were 
significant changes overall, which appeared attributable to relative re-
ductions in symptoms as the pandemic eased. However, a limitation of 
the  study  was  the  use of  Y-BOCS,  which  is  not  generally  regarded  as 
suitable for measuring OCD symptoms in normative populations. 

In a large scale UK-based study using de-identified electronic health 
records  from  >9  million  people  aged  11y  and  older,  Mansfield  and 
colleagues calculated weekly primary care contacts with different con-
ditions (Mansfield et al., 2021). Overall, it was found that primary care 
contacts  from  patients  dropped  markedly  during  the  pandemic  re-
strictions, across different disorders. The odds ratio for presenting with 
OCD  was  0.69  versus  pre-pandemic  (95  %  confidence  interval 
0.64(cid:0) 0.74): by July 2020, presentations had still not generally returned 
to pre-Covid levels. These findings may indicate that people with OCD, 
as with other mental health conditions, experienced a detachment from 
usual clinical care in the wake of the emerging pandemic. Information 
about OCD related only to presence of absence of the diagnostic label, 
rather than gold-standard measures such as relating to symptom types or 
severity. 

At  a private US university, undergraduate  students were recruited 
around  the  time  of  January  2020,  to  complete  an  online  survey  that 
included  the  OCI-R  washing  subscale,  and  subsequently  around 
February-March 2020 (in the early stages of the pandemic), to complete 
a follow-up survey (Knowles and Olatunji, 2021). There were 108 par-
ticipants, who received study credit for taking part. It was found that 
OCI-R  washing  symptoms  increased  from  baseline  (mean  1.87  [SD 
2.19]) to during the pandemic (mean 2.86 [SD 2.76]), this being sig-
nificant and of medium effect size. 

In a longitudinal study conducted in Romania, with recruitment via 
social media, 159 people provided baseline data in March-April 2020 
(during the pandemic) (Meșterelu et al., 2021). Of these, 59 (35.2 %) 
provided  follow-up  data  in  late  2020.  Higher  symptoms  on  the 
Obsessive-Compulsive  Inventory  (OCI)  predicted  statistically  signifi-
cantly worse Covid-19 related anxieties and behaviours. 

4.3. Cross-sectional studies in OCD patients 

Ten studies were identified that collected cross-sectional data in OCD 
patients during the pandemic and examined associations with relevant 
measures. One major inherent limitation is the reliance in most studies 
on  retrospective  self-report  in  terms  of  assessing  changes  in  OCD 
symptoms. 

Nissen  et  al.  explored  the  immediate  impact  of  the  pandemic  in 
young people with OCD (aged 7(cid:0) 21 years), using a self-report survey 
(Nissen et al., 2020). This comprised two samples: 64 newly diagnosed 
young  people  from  a  specialist  OCD  clinic  in  The  Netherlands,  and 
another 37 young people from the Danish OCD association. The authors 
used  adapted  questions  from  the  Y-BOCS.  In  the  pooled  sample, 
approximately  65  %  were  receiving  psychotherapy  and  around  40  % 
were receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication (some 
were receiving other medication classes). In the clinic group, 44.6 % of 
patients reported a worsening of OCD during the pandemic (Average 3.2 
[SD  1.8]  on  adapted  Y-BOCS).  In  the  other  group,  73  %  reported  a 
worsening of OCD during the pandemic (Average 4.2 [SD 2.6]). 

In a study that recruited through a non-profit organisation (German 
Society  for  Obsessive  Compulsive  Disorders),  and  psychiatric  in-
stitutions in Germany, OCD patients completed an online survey during 
lockdown restrictions (Jelinek et al., 2021). A total of 1905 participants 
accessed the survey materials and the final sample comprised 394 par-
ticipants (exclusions were due to multiple reasons, including those who 
did not report they had a formal OCD diagnosis from an expert). OCD 
symptoms were quantified using the OCI-R, and changes relating to the 
pandemic  were  quantified  using  a  5-point  Likert  scale  approach. 
Average severity scores on the OCI-R  were in the moderate  to severe 
range in the sample overall. 71.8 % of the sample reported a worsening 
of OCD symptom severity from pre-pandemic to during the pandemic, 
which related statistically to reduced mobility and increased interper-
sonal conflict. 6.5 % of the sample reported a decrease in symptoms, and 
21.7 % reported no change. There were correlations between change in 
symptoms on the 5-point scales and OCI-R total scores, but of small ef-
fect size by correlation coefficients. Thus, the method used to quantify 
change in OCD symptoms provided some insight but may not have been 
ideal. 

In a study in Denmark, adult patients with OCD were recruited via 
the Danish OCD Association, and completed a self-report survey. Lock-
down  restrictions  differed  somewhat  over  the  sampling  period 
(Højgaard et al., 2021). The survey was sent to approximately 600 email 
accounts, and the final sample size comprised 201 participants. Based on 
adapted Y-BOCS questions, 61.2 % of patients reported worsened OCD 
symptoms since the pandemic outbreak, 10.4 % reported an improve-
ment, and 28.4 % reported no change. In multivariate modelling (final 
model),  female  gender,  contamination  symptoms,  and  psychiatric 
comorbidities were significantly associated with increased OCD wors-
ening during the pandemic, explaining 13.7 % of the variance. Opting to 
isolate at home also showed a link to symptom worsening, but did not 
retain statistical significance in the final model. 

Benatti  and  colleagues  collected  data  from  tertiary  OCD  specialist 
clinics  in Italy  using interviews conducted  by telephone  (94  %) or in 
person (6%) (Benatti et al., 2020). There were a total of 123 outpatients 
with OCD, and 35.8 % of patients experienced a worsening of symptoms 
during the pandemic based on clinical interviews. As compared to pa-
tients not experiencing clinical worsening, those patients who experi-
enced  a  worsening  had  significantly  higher  rates  of  new  obsessions, 
increase  in  new  and  past  compulsions,  and  increased  avoidance  be-
haviours.  Those  with  a  clinical  worsening  also  showed  more  global 
impairment  as  evidenced  by  higher  medication  adjustments,  higher 
suicidal  ideation,  more  internet  checking  for  reassurance,  family  ac-
commodation, and sleep disturbances. The groups did not differ signif-
icantly in terms of age, gender, other phenotypes, or comorbidity rates 
(Benatti et al., 2020). 

In  a  study  conducted  in  India  (one  month  after  initiation  of  a

Grant et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

lockdown), 84 OCD patients completed telephone and/or videocall in-
terviews (from 104 meeting eligibility criteria). Patients were screened 
based on previous contact with clinical services and having obsessions 
relating to contamination and compulsion related to washing of hands 
and cleaning household items, who also had good medication adherence 
and had visited outpatient clinics on-time previously (Chakraborty and 
Karmakar,  2020).  Age  was  not  available.  6%  of  patients  reported  an 
exacerbation of symptoms during the pandemic and those individuals 
were not taking medication at the time of assessment due to unavail-
ability  of  medication.  When  comparing  Y-BOCS  to  previous  scores 
however,  12  %  reported  at  least  a  5%  worsening,  39.3  %  reported  a 
slight worsening (less than 5% increase), and 48.8 % percent reported no 
change  or  a  decrease  in  severity.  As  such,  some  degree  of  worsening 
appeared relatively common based on Y-BOCS but uncommon according 
to the patients’ perspectives and the study authors’ interpretation of the 
data. 

An online US survey recruited people via three anonymous online 
OCD peer support communities and posts on social media pages. The 
participants were asked to rate to what extent their symptoms in four 
OCD relevant domains had changed since the pandemic began (Kave-
ladze et al., 2021), based on questions from the DOCS. The sample of 
196  respondents  included  people  who  reported  being  self-diagnosed, 
suspected  they  had  OCD,  or  had  been  professionally  diagnosed.  92.9 
% of those who took part reported worsening of their symptoms since 
the pandemic began (large effect size); the changes were less marked for 
symmetry  and  completeness  symptoms  compared  to  other  symptom 
dimensions. 

Tundo et al. recruited a sample of patients with OCD in Italy, via a 
private clinic for mood and anxiety disorders (Tundo et al., 2021). The 
sampling frame covered start of a lockdown through to 1.5 months after 
a  lockdown  had  ended,  and  most  interviews  (80  %)  were  conducted 
online with the remainder (20 %) being in-person. The study examined 
not only OCD but also other conditions. There were 29 OCD patients, 
and they reported a higher rate of symptom worsening due to pandemic 
stress (13.8 % of OCD patients) as compared to patients with depression 
(2.9 %). The authors reported that OCD was the only identified predictor 
of an increased risk of relapse/symptoms worsening. 

Storch  and  colleagues  conducted  an  online  survey  in  which  they 
contacted  595  clinicians  who  were  part  of  the  International  OCD 
Foundation  (IOCDF)  database,  who  regularly  provide  CBT  to  people 
with OCD and/or anxiety disorders (of any age) (Storch et al., 2021). 
Clinicians were asked to recall information regarding OCD patients they 
had  seen; as well as to complete rating scales  for patients’  symptoms 
relating  to  (retrospectively)  beginning  of  treatment  and  just  prior  to 
pandemic; as well as currently (i.e. during the pandemic). Adapted in-
struments for this purpose included the Y-BOCS and the National Insti-
tute of Mental Health-Global Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (NIMH-GOS). 
227 individuals opened the survey and began to complete it, of whom 
137  provided  complete  clinical  rating  scores  for  at  least  one  patient. 
Most clinicians provided information about one of their patients, though 
some provided data on more (maximum five patients from each indi-
vidual). The clinicians felt that 38 % of their patients had experienced 
symptom deterioration during the pandemic, 47 % had been unchanged, 
and 10 % had improved (Storch et al., 2021). The authors reported that 
OCD  symptoms  across  the  whole  sample  tended  to  improve  from 
pre-treatment to the point before the pandemic, then these gains levelled 
off and symptoms worsened for some. 

Wheaton  et  al.  recruited  presumably  largely  US  individuals  self- 
identifying  as  having  OCD  via  online  sources  (n = 252),  as  well  as  a 
community sample of adults recruited via Mechanical Turk (n = 305) 
(Wheaton  et  al.,  2021b).  OCD  symptoms  were  quantified  using  the 
DOCS.  OCD  was  defined  as  those  individuals  reporting  that they  had 
previously  received  a  diagnosis  from  a  healthcare  professional.  OCD 
patients and controls differed significantly on a number of demographic 
variables  such  as age  and gender. OCD individuals  had  elevated con-
cerns about Covid-19 compared to putative controls; and the majority of 

OCD  respondents  reported  worsening  after  the  outbreak  albeit  most 
frequently this was a slight worsening rather than substantial worsening. 
Self-reports indicated that pandemic-related worsening appeared more 
clearly related to contamination and harm responsibility symptoms than 
others. 

Cost et al. pooled several datasets from Canadian cohorts of young 
people  (aged  2(cid:0) 18y):  two  clinically-referred  mental  health  /  neuro-
developmental cohorts and two community cohorts (Cost et al., 2021). 
This paper is included in the current section as a subset of these par-
ticipants had OCD and a sizable proportion of the study was in clinical 
participants. Questionnaire data were collected from parents, as well as 
from  probands  where  appropriate  methodologically. Individuals  were 
asked  to  rate  obsessions/compulsions  (and  other  symptom  domains) 
compared to before the pandemic. 763 young people consented and 347 
completed  the  outcome  measures.  The  actual  sample  sizes  varied 
considerable depending on the source of given information and nature of 
the  variable  considered.  Overall,  worsening  of  young  people’s  obses-
sions/compulsions  were  reported  in  around  20(cid:0) 23%  of  responders, 
improvements  in  3–4  %  of  responders.  Worsening  of  obsession/com-
pulsions  was  significantly  associated  with  pre-Covid  psychiatric  diag-
nosis,  greater  economic  concerns,  and  greater  stress  from  social 
isolation. Note that these findings relate to the pooled sample, rather 
than comprising analyses specific to OCD patients. 

4.4. Cross-sectional studies in general population samples 

Eight studies were identified that had examined OCD symptoms (or 
tendencies) in general population samples cross-sectionally, during the 
pandemic. 

Fontenelle  et  al.  explored  correlates  of  obsessive-compulsive  (and 
related) symptoms and pandemic impact (Fontenelle et al., 2021), in a 
sample of 829 US-based adults recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. 
OCD  measured  includes  the  DOCS,  and  Vancouver  Obsessional 
Compulsive Inventory –  Mental Contamination (VOCI-MC); and other 
symptoms  quantified  included:  skin  picking,  hair-pulling,  hoarding, 
body dysmorphic disorder, as well as psychological distress, disability, 
and  quality  of  life.  Trans-diagnostic  measures  of  impulsivity  and 
compulsivity  were  recorded  using  the  Barratt  Impulsivity  Scale  (BIS) 
and Cambridge-Chicago Trait Compulsivity Scale (CHI-T) respectively. 
Scores for all obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms significantly 
increased between prior to pandemic (based on retrospective recall) and 
currently (i.e. during the pandemic). Worsening of OCD symptoms was 
statistically predicted by female gender, more stressful events related to 
the  pandemic,  and  higher  trans-diagnostic  compulsivity,  as  well  as 
worse baseline OCD severity scores. 

conducted  online.  An  adaptation  of 

In  Turkey,  a  sample  of  598  young  people  (aged  14(cid:0) 18y)  were 
enrolled  via  convenience  sampling  (Seçer  and  Ulas¸,  2020),  with  data 
collection  being 
the 
Obsessive-Compulsive  Inventory –  Child  Version  was  deployed, along 
with an emotional reactivity scale, fear of Covid-19, and measures of 
depression/anxiety,  plus  experiential  avoidance.  Structural  modelling 
was used to test various hypotheses. Cross-sectionally, the statistically 
predictive effect of Covid-19 fear on OCD symptoms was found to relate 
to a number of potential mechanisms. 

An online survey in Canada recruited people aged 12 or older via 
various sources (including media advertisements): people with chronic 
mental  or  physical  illnesses,  healthcare  providers,  and  the  general 
population  (Robillard  et  al.,  2020).  OCD  symptoms  were  quantified 
using the DOCS, though the main focus of the study was not OCD but 
rather stress occurring during the pandemic. 4920 of 6040 participants 
provided cross-sectional OCD scores, and the data were collected around 
the time of peak of the first wave in Canada. In multivariate modelling, 
higher  scores  on  the  DOCS  contamination  subscale  was  significantly 
related to reported worsening of perceived stress during the pandemic, 
as well as a number of other variables (e.g. presence of mental disorder, 
personality traits, alcohol consumption). 

NeuroscienceandBiobehavioralReviews132(2022)1086–10981093J.E. Grant et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

AlHusseini  and  colleagues  conducted  an  online  survey  in  Saudi 
Arabia  during  lockdowns,  using  the  OCI-R  (AlHusseini  et  al.,  2021). 
There were 2186 respondents and the study was conducted in adults, 
recruited using social media platforms. The authors reported that older 
age, being male, being married, higher income groups, and higher levels 
of  education  were  associated  with  OCD  symptoms  (using  a  binary 
threshold). The study reported extremely high rates of OCD, which may 
reflect recruitment bias and/or inappropriate use of probable diagnostic 
thresholds. 

Using a mix of recruitment through the Prolific platform, and social 
media advertisements, Albertella recruited an online sample comprising 
complete  data  from  878  adults  aged  18–84  years  (Albertella  et  al., 
2021).  The  study  found  that  self-reported  OCD  symptoms  (using  the 
OCI-R)  significantly  increased  from  pre-pandemic  to  during  the 
pandemic –  this was of large effect size. Problematic internet use also 
was reported to have increased with large effect size, and other repeti-
tive symptoms of small effect sizes. Regression modelling indicated that 
greater OCD problems during lockdown were associated with younger 
age,  more  Covid-related  stressful  events,  more  psychological  distress, 
and higher trans-diagnostic compulsivity (Albertella et al., 2021). 

In a US Mechanical Turk sample (n = 738), Wheaton et al. explored a 
potential  role  for  ‘intolerance  of  uncertainty’  in  accounting  for  cross- 
sectional  relationships  with  perceived  Covid-19  threat,  OCD,  and 
health  anxiety  (Wheaton  et  al.,  2021a).  OCD  was  assessed  using  the 
DOCS, with these scores appearing somewhat elevated versus reference 
data, but not as high as would be found in clinical samples (Wheaton 
et al., 2021a). Data were collected relatively early on in the course of the 
pandemic  outbreak.  Significant  moderate  positive  correlations  were 
found between fear of Covid-19 spread and other measures including of 
OCD symptoms; and regression modelling suggested that intolerance of 
uncertainty partly statistically accounted for the link between Covid-19 
concerns and OCD plus health anxiety symptoms. 

Fernandez and colleagues collected cross-sectional data in Argentina 
during Covid-19 quarantine, in 4408 adult participants, and then in 644 
adult  participants  for  a  smaller  replication  study  (Fern´andez  et  al., 
2020). Recruitment methods included through social media and insti-
tutional  announcements.  A  variety  of  data  analytic  approaches  were 
used  but  a  main  focus  was  on  using  Latent  Class  Analysis  (LCA)  to 
identity putative ‘psychological distress’  subtypes based on item-level 
scores  on  the  Brief  Symptoms  Inventory (BSI)  –  the  latter  is  a  classic 
scale measuring diverse psychiatric symptoms including those relevant 
for  OCD.  This  identified  three  classes,  essentially  reflecting  different 
levels  of  overall  severity  irrespective  of  specific  symptom  domain.  In 
follow-up analyses, it was found that Covid-19 related fear and coping 
skills  partially  statistically  mediated  the  link  between  psychological 
distress (BSI) and other variables such as gender, age, and personality 
traits (Fern´andez et al., 2020). 

Using the Qualtrics Platform (a method of recruitment from market 
research  panels),  a  study  conducted  by  Samuels  et  al.  in  the  USA 
collected  online  questionnaire  exploring  Covid-19  related  behaviours 
(such as hand wiping, or use of sanitisers…) and OCD symptoms (OCI-R 
and a subset of adapted items from the Dimensional Y-BOCS) in adults 
(Samuels et al., 2021). For the Dimensional Y-BOCS, participants were 
asked about their experiences at the earlier stage of the pandemic with 
lower  public  recognition  of  the  emerging  pandemic,  and  once  it  was 
more developed (i.e. a mix of retrospective recall of OCD experiences 
and  recording  of  ‘current’  experiences).  2117  individuals  took  part. 
Covid-19  related  behaviour  scores  were  significantly  related  to 
pre-pandemic  to  current  increases  in  OCD symptoms,  as  well  as  with 
(presumably  current)  contamination  obsessions  and  contamination 
phobias. Interestingly, these relationships were significant whether or 
not a person reported a prior diagnosis of OCD. 

5. Conclusions, implications, and future directions 

Overall, longitudinal studies suggested that a sizable proportion of 

(albeit,  on  average,  worsening),  noting 

people with OCD, both adults and children, experienced an exacerbation 
of  symptoms  during  the  pandemic.  Of  longitudinal  studies  in  people 
with OCD reporting absolute changes in severity using the Yale-Brown 
Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), typical average symptom wors-
ening  reported  in  the  studies  ranged  between  2.7–9.1  points  (Davide 
et al., 2020; Alonso et al., 2021; Khosravani et al., 2021). The reported 
proportion  of  people  with  OCD  experiencing  worsening  ranged  from 
20.0 %–65.3 % (Tanir et al., 2020; Alonso et al., 2021; Sharma et al., 
2021),  but  one  study  in  young  people  found  little/no  evidence  for 
deterioration overall (Schwartz-Lifshitz et al., 2021). In people whose 
OCD symptoms had remitted prior to the pandemic emerging, one study 
found  that  prior  remission  was  statistically  associated  with  higher 
deterioration (Davide et al., 2020); and another reported relatively small 
changes 
that  con-
tamination/washing symptoms were common in patients who individ-
ually did experience symptom exacerbation (Matsunaga et al., 2020). In 
a  particularly  high-quality  longitudinal  study,  several  pre-pandemic 
measures  were  statistically  predictive  of  OCD  symptom  worsening 
during  the  pandemic:  worse  baseline  OCD  and  depression  severities, 
presence  of  washing/checking  symptoms,  and  lower  perceived  social 
support  (Alonso  et  al.,  2021). The  average  proportion  of  people  with 
OCD reporting a worsening during the pandemic in cross-sectional data 
analyses ranged quite considerably, from 4.0 %–92.9 % across studies 
(Benatti et al., 2020; Chakraborty and Karmakar, 2020; Nissen et  al., 
2020; Carmi et al., 2021; Cost et al., 2021; Højgaard et al., 2021; Jelinek 
et al., 2021; Kaveladze et al., 2021; Storch et al., 2021; Tundo et al., 
2021). The large range for cross-sectional studies may be due to a variety 
of factors including different study designs, and quantification methods, 
and variation in retrospective recall bias. 

Clinical studies tended to report the percentage of patients reporting 
any OCD symptom worsening, or the average numerical or percentage 
change  in  symptoms.  This  is  valuable  to  information,  but  ideally  it 
would also be useful to determine the percentage/proportion of patients 
experiencing ‘clinically significant’ deterioration during the pandemic. 
The literature has largely not done so, likely due to a lack of consensus 
on what constitutes clinically significant deterioration per se. Potential 
definitions derived from non-pandemic contexts include 25 % or greater 
deterioration  in  the  total  Y-BOCS  score  (Fineberg  et  al.,  2020a);  or  a 
5-point  worsening  of  Y-BOCS  (Hollander  et  al.,  2010).  Future  work 
should  build  consensus  around  a  suitable  definition  that  can  then  be 
more consistently applied in OCD research. 

What are the likely reasons for the above-reported worsening of OCD 
symptoms in a sizable proportion of OCD patients during the pandemic? 
The pandemic in itself can be viewed as a general stressor (or series of 
stressors)  and  of  course  stress  can  worsen  psychiatric  symptoms, 
including through generalised increases in anxiety (which has a partly 
physiological role of preparing individuals to respond to threats). This is 
supported by a study that reported symptom changes were linked sta-
tistically to pandemic-related stress (Khosravani et al., 2021). However, 
the  pandemic  and  public  health  messages  (e.g.  through  the  media, 
governmental guidance/restrictions, or other) has a specific relevance to 
contamination and checking type OCD symptoms. Fear of contamina-
tion  and  encouragement  of  related  preventative  habits  may  be  legiti-
mate  public  health  messages  but  also,  for  those  who  already  are 
impaired  by  excess  concern  in  these  domains,  may  lead  to  clinically 
impairing symptoms being worsened. Large parts of the global popula-
tion have been urged to take precautions against potential contamina-
tion using steps that would be unusual in those cultures during normal 
circumstances –  e.g. decontamination of hands with alcohol (or other 
chemicals)  frequently  through  the  day;  washing  hands  for  sustained 
periods of time; avoiding close proximity to other people and hugging or 
shaking hands; and/or wearing masks. There was ample evidence in the 
literature (from both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies) indicating 
that  increases  in  contamination  and  washing/checking  symptoms  in 
people with OCD were especially evident during the pandemic, as con-
trasted to other symptom domains (Davide et al., 2020; Matsunaga et al., 

NeuroscienceandBiobehavioralReviews132(2022)1086–10981094J.E. Grant et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

2020; Tanir et al., 2020; Højgaard et al., 2021; Kaveladze et al., 2021; 
Wheaton et al., 2021b). 

A likely mechanism underpinning exacerbation of symptoms in some 
OCD patients during the pandemic is a reduced access to –  as well as 
changes in the implementation of – therapeutic support and treatments. 
In the UK, the pandemic in the early stages was associated with a lower 
likelihood of clinical presentations with OCD to family doctors (Mans-
field et al., 2021), suggesting a negative impact on ability of patients to 
be able to access professional support. Though under-studied, access to 
psychologists, psychiatrists, and other healthcare professionals will also 
have  been  reduced  for  patients  during  the  pandemic  due  to  shifts  in 
healthcare resourcing/priorities as well as physical changes in services 
such  that  many  face-to-face  appointments  were  cancelled  or  deferred 
(Bakolis et al., 2021). 

Another important consideration is that a core feature of first-line 
evidence-based  psychological  treatment  for  OCD  is  cognitive  behav-
ioural  therapy  with  exposure  and  response  prevention  (ERP)  (Drum-
mond  and  Fineberg,  2007;  Menchon  et  al.,  2016;  Reid  et  al.,  2021). 
Exposure  treatment  aims  to  provide  periods  of  contact  with  a  feared 
situation  until  anxiety  reduces  through  habituation  and  teaching  the 
patient that their anxiety can reduce without engaging in compulsions. 
The individual thus learns to accept that the discomfort induced by the 
obsessive thoughts will naturally wane if the compulsions are not per-
formed. Performing a compulsion gives short term relief which is usually 
followed by the desire to engage in more compulsive activity. Whereas 
many  OCD  symptoms  could  safely  be  tackled  with  ERP  during  the 
pandemic, there has been concern about applying this treatment for the 
substantial  proportion  of  patients  with  contamination-related  symp-
toms.  ERP  treatment  for  most  contamination  symptoms  involves 
encouraging  the  patient  to  face  up  in  a  graded  way  to  their  feared 
contaminant  e.g.  touching  feared  items,  without  performing  decon-
tamination  compulsions.  The  compulsions  generally  take  the  form  of 
excessive  and  meticulous  washing.  During  the  pandemic  the  risks  of 
encouraging  people  to  take  the  risk  of  touching  surfaces  touched  by 
others and then not washing excessively, as advocated in ERP treatment, 
became  problematic.  Governments  emphasised  the  need  for  frequent 
handwashing  and  this  together  with  the  regularly  publicised  and 
alarming death rates lead to increased anxiety in vulnerable patients. 
The risks of exposure had to be weighed against the risks of the OCD 
itself.  Pragmatic  recommendations  were  made  by  an  International 
Consortium  concerning  this  issue  which  suggested  that  most  ERP  for 
contamination-related  OCD  be  paused,  adapted  or  only  be  applied  in 
limited form at specialist centres during the pandemic (Fineberg et al., 
2020b). The paper by Fineberg et al. was written shortly after the onset 
of the pandemic and when there was still considerable global concern 
about fomite spread of the virus as well as acute fear and the effect of 
Lockdown in many countries. At this time, the pandemic was predicted 
to  last  months  and  not  years.  A later  paper  by  Storch  and  colleagues 
(Sheu et al., 2020) essentially proposed a similar approach to that rec-
ommended  by  Fineberg  et  al;  i.e.  that  ERP  should  be  adapted  within 
current public health guidance. 

The  pandemic  has  left  clinicians  and  patients  uncertain  about  the 
extent to which ERP can be continued during the pandemic: on the one 
hand, OCD can be extremely impairing and distressing and so there is an 
impetus to continue evidence-based treatment; on the other, some of this 
treatment  runs  counter  to  government  messages  about  exercising 
caution  and  avoiding  potentially  contamination-related  situations. 
Various therapeutic strategies for contamination related OCD including 
pausing or adapting exposure treatment to meet with safety guidance 
have been proposed by different groups of expert clinicians, while the 
potential  negative  consequences  of  moving  away  from  standard 
evidence-based  application  of  exposure  therapy  have  also  been  high-
lighted  (Fineberg  et  al.,  2020b,  Sheu  et  al.,  2020).  However,  in  the 
literature  identified  in  this  paper,  it  is  evident  that  there  is  a  lack  of 
evidence as to how treatment and clinical services should appropriately 
adapt during the pandemic and beyond it. 

Lastly, in terms what may have contributed to changes in OCD from 
pre-pandemic to during it, non-specific factors are also likely to have 
played a role (“unknown unknowns”). For example, findings from one 
study using serial measurement suggested that relapse rates before the 
pandemic were similar to during it (Sharma et al., 2021). While it seems 
unlikely that the pandemic has had no impact on OCD, due to its obvious 
relevance  to  common  OCD  symptoms  as  well  as  profound  impact  on 
access to services, as well as the bulk of the literature suggesting to the 
contrary,  non-specific  factors  will  of  course  also  have  contributed  in 
some cases of exacerbation. Relatedly, it is important to note that the 
impact of the pandemic is largely treated as a unitary ‘stressor’ whereas 
of  course it  comprises a  number  of different  stressors that may  differ 
across individuals. For this reason, it would be valuable for future OCD 
work to incorporate more widespread use of tools, such as COROTRAS, 
PanDemic  General  Impact  Scale  (PD-GIS-11),  and  natural  language 
processing  analysis  of  free  text,  in  order  to  fractionate  what  specific 
contextual aspects of the pandemic account for any worsening in OCD 
symptoms (Fontenelle et al., 2021; Hampshire et al., 2021). 

Whether  dimensional  measures  of  OC  symptoms  changed  longitu-
dinally in general population samples (i.e. people who for the most part 
did not have OCD) from pre-pandemic to during the pandemic is un-
clear: one study reported an increase (Tanir et al., 2020) but another did 
not (Meda et al., 2021). There was some evidence from two studies for a 
reduction in OC symptoms during the pandemic from one time point to 
another, possibly reflecting easing of restrictions (Ji et al., 2020; Meda 
et al., 2021). It seems logical to assume that changes in dimensional OC 
measures probably reflect a combination of: increases in rituals related 
to  avoiding  contamination  that  were  not  pathological,  but  rather  a 
logical response to the pandemic; AND/OR an increase in actual OCD 
symptoms in subsets of these samples particularly vulnerable to devel-
oping (or already having) clinically significant symptoms. Nonetheless, 
cross-sectional  studies  in  general  population  samples  (which  may 
include some people with OCD but most people would not have OCD) 
may provide insights into mechanisms through which the pandemic may 
have impacted particular aspects of OC-related symptom domains. We 
found that such studies captured a broader range of measures in some 
cases than patient work, such as other questionnaires relating to traits 
and  pandemic-related  fear/stress.  There  was  evidence  from  several 
studies that OC symptoms during the pandemic (and increases in these 
symptoms),  in  general  population  samples,  were  associated  with 
pandemic-related  stress/fear  (Robillard  et  al.,  2020;  Seçer  and  Ulas¸, 
2020; Albertella et al., 2021; Fontenelle et al., 2021), as well as with trait 
compulsivity (Albertella et al., 2021; Fontenelle et al., 2021). 

While  the  clinical  and  public  health  focus  should  primarily  be  on 
addressing any worsening of OCD symptoms during the pandemic, it is 
noteworthy that a sizable proportion of people did not experience such 
deterioration  –  and  indeed,  some  people  experienced  OCD  symptom 
improvement. Future work should address this variability in pandemic 
impact on OCD, not only focusing on deterioration. This is important 
because  understanding  contextual  variables  linked  to  resilience  in 
response to stressors could enable the development on new strategies to 
prevent deterioration; i.e. it may be possible to better understand why 
some  people  are  more  vulnerable  than  others,  and  therefore  inform 
clinical and public health strategies. 

Several limitations should be noted in terms of this review. First, this 
study was not a formal pre-registered systematic review, but rather a 
pragmatic scoping review; it does not claim to be a comprehensive re-
view of the literature. Nonetheless, we hope this will form a springboard 
for a future rigorous systematic review. Second, being a narrative re-
view,  the  paper  focused  on  findings  felt  to  be  particularly  pertinent. 
While conducted by experts in the field of OCD and related disorders, 
some findings may be important but not covered. Lastly,  because the 
pandemic is evolving and literature is expanding rapidly, readers should 
be mindful that important new findings to help address the focus of this 
review are likely to emerge subsequently. 

There are also limitations related to the literature itself, covered in

Grant et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

this review. Most studies focused on the initial pandemic lockdown and 
so we do not know if any changes persisted over time. Many studies were 
cross-sectional  in  nature.  The  identified  longitudinal  studies  –  while 
preferable  methodologically  to  address  impact  on  OCD  symptoms  as 
compared  to  cross-sectional  designs  –  often  lacked  rigorous  baseline 
data. There was also high heterogeneity, including in terms of variability 
of time points that were examined, geographical settings, sampling ap-
proaches,  instruments  used,  and  ways  of  presenting  data  regarding 
symptom  changes.  In  terms  of  time  points,  negative  impacts  of  the 
pandemic on other areas of mental health have appeared to lessen with 
time (Robinson et al., 2021). Another issue is that it is hard to know if 
clinical deterioration detected in some people with OCD relates to the 
impact of the pandemic itself, or other reasons; few studies had parallel 
serial control arms. Also, many individuals with OCD examined in the 
studies  were  receiving  treatments  (pharmacotherapy  and/or  psycho-
logical  therapy)  but  the  impact  of  treatments  (and  impacts  of  the 
pandemic on service provision and deployment of treatments) was not 
clear.  One  would  expect  a  higher  risk  of  symptom  deterioration  in 
people with OCD not receiving treatment and care during the pandemic, 
and  the  pandemic  did  reduce  the  likelihood  of  clinical  presentations 
with  OCD  to  family  doctors  according  to  UK  data,  at  least  initially 
(Mansfield  et  al.,  2021).  Other  limitations  in  some  of  the  literature 
include: use of instruments not necessarily extensively validated for the 
settings in which they were used, lack of control groups and more than 
1–2 sampling time frames, not considering the contribution of various 
comorbidities or differential diagnoses, and/or understandable lack of 
formal clinical interviews during the pandemic. 

Our literature search did not find studies attempting to specifically 
address  whether  Covid-19  infection  itself  could  lead  to  de  novo  OCD 
symptoms or exacerbation of symptoms in people with OCD unrelated to 
the more general effects of the pandemic. In a very recent study, diag-
nostic  information  and  psychiatric  symptom  measures  (including  for 
OCD) were collected from 226 Covid-19 pneumonia survivors (Mazza 
et al., 2021). Psychiatric symptoms, including OCD (quantified using the 
OCI) correlated negatively with duration of hospitalization. There was a 
significant  increase  in  OCD  symptoms  between  1-  and  3-month 
follow-up,  unrelated  to  gender  or  psychiatric  history,  whereas 
post-traumatic  stress  disorder  symptoms,  state  anxiety,  and  insomnia 
reduced between these time points; and depression did not change be-
tween  the  time  points.  Historically,  infective  and/or  inflammatory 
processes  have  been  implicated  in  some  cases  of  OCD-like  symptoms 
(Swedo, 2002; Lutters et al., 2018). Covid-19 infection commonly leads 
to  loss  of  taste  and/or  smell,  most  likely  via  disruption  of  olfactory 
neuroepithelium  but  also  potentially  via  olfactory  nerve  invasion 
(Whitcroft  and  Hummel,  2020).  It  should  be  noted  that  mechanisms 
underpinning  neuropsychiatric  consequences  of  Covid-19  remain  un-
clear  and  under  scientific  debate  (Solomon,  2021).  However,  the  ol-
factory nerves are extensively connected with the orbitofrontal cortices 
which  are  implicated  in  the  pathophysiology  of  OCD,  as  well  as  in 
vulnerability for OCD (Graybiel and Rauch, 2000; Chamberlain et al., 
2005;  Chamberlain  et  al.,  2008).  As  such  it  would  seem  crucial  to 
explore  potential  relationships  between  Covid-19  infection  and  emer-
gence of new or exacerbation of OCD symptoms (Pallanti et al., 2020), 
but we are aware of virtually no data being collected on this topic, and 
found a poverty of such work in this review. Indeed, a meta-analysis of 
data  on  the  neurological  and  psychiatric  manifestations  of  COVID-19 
from  the  first  phase  of  the  pandemic  found  no  evidence  that  studies 
were appropriately screening for OCD symptoms (Rogers et al., 2021). 
Validated  (including  very  brief  practical)  screening  tools  for  OCD  do 
exist, both categorically and dimensionally (Fineberg et al., 2008); as 
well as tools to quantify broad aspects of impulsivity and compulsivity 
(Hook et al., 2021). This is of interest given the link between such traits 
and impact of the pandemic (Albertella et al., 2021; Fontenelle et al., 
2021; Hampshire et al., 2021). Yet research tends not to include such 
measures. 

Overall,  the  key  findings  from  this  review  are  (1)  that  a  sizable 

proportion  of  people  with  OCD  experienced  or  reported  symptom 
worsening  during  the  pandemic,  especially  around  the  time  of  initial 
social restrictions (typically approximately 20–65 % of cases in longi-
tudinal  studies);  (2)  contamination/washing  symptoms  appeared 
particularly  susceptible  to  worsening;  and  (3)  OCD  symptom  scores 
during  the  pandemic,  in  general  population  samples,  were  associated 
with perceived stress/fear related to the pandemic, as well as with trait 
compulsivity.  The  studies  also  draw  attention  to  the  need  for  proper 
research funding to more rigorously address who was most vulnerable to 
the negative impact of the pandemic and how this might be mitigated 
during  pandemics;  how  well-intended  public  health  messages  might 
exacerbate  OCD  for  some  vulnerable  individuals;  as  well  as  how 
evidence-based treatments should be adapted to ensure optimal care for 
patients. Future work should also consider whether Covid-19 infection 
itself  might  contribute  to  worsening  of  OCD  in  some  people  (or  new 
onset symptoms as part of neuropsychiatric sequelae).
