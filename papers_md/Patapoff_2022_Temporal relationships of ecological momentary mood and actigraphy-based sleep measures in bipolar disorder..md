Abstract

Sleep disturbances are a key feature of bipolar disorder (BD), and poor sleep has been linked to 
mood symptoms. Recent use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has allowed for nuanced 
exploration of the sleep-mood link; though, the scale and directionality of this relationship is 
still unclear. Using EMA, actigraphy, and self-reported sleep measures, this study examines the 
concurrent and predictive relationships between sleep and mood. Participants with BD (n = 56) 
wore actigraphy devices for up to 14 days and completed validated scales and daily EMA surveys 
about mood and sleep quality. Linear mixed models were used to examine overall and time-
lagged relationships between sleep and mood variables. EMA mood ratings were correlated with 
validated rating scales for depression, mania, anxiety, and impulsivity. Poor self-reported sleep 
quality was associated with worse overall ratings of sadness and anger. Worse self-reported sleep

quality was associated with greater sadness the following day. Higher daytime impulsivity was 
associated with worse sleep quality the following night. Exploratory analyses found relationships 
between worse and more variable mood (sadness, anger, and impulsivity) with worse and more 
variable sleep that evening (efficiency, WASO, and sleep onset time). The sample size was modest, 
fairly homogenous, and included mainly euthymic persons with BD. EMA-based assessments 
of mood and sleep are correlated with validated scale scores and provide novel insight into 
intra-individual variability. Further work on the complex two-way interactions between sleep and 
mood is needed to better understand how to improve outcomes in BD.

Introduction

As the sixth leading cause of disability among young and middle-aged adults, bipolar 
disorder (BD) is associated with depressive and manic episodes that lead to hospitalizations, 
risky and suicidal behaviors, and impaired functioning (Cloutier et al., 2018). While 
mood-stabilizing pharmacotherapies are a key linchpin in the treatment of BD, these 
treatments are associated with major side effects and often have poor adherence (Bai et 
al., 2019; MacDonald et al., 2016; Velligan et al., 2017). Novel psychosocial approaches 
to improving mental health outcomes of BD are needed, especially in early identification 
of mood instability. Recent studies have shown that daily mood ratings through ecological 
momentary assessment (EMA) can provide longitudinal mood profiles that are linked to 
clinical outcomes (Faurholt-Jepsen et al., 2019; Faurholt-Jepsen et al., 2015; O’Donnell 
et al., 2018). Linking daily mood changes to other behavioral assessments, such as sleep 
and activity, may facilitate prediction of worsening mood symptoms and enable early-stage 
interventions, perhaps including those focused on regularizing sleep and circadian rhythms.

Sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality are key features of BD. Adults with BD report 
lower sleep efficiency and poorer overall sleep quality (i.e., higher total scores on the 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) than controls (Cretu et al., 2016; Geoffrey et al., 
2014; Ng et al., 2015). Actigraphy-based studies show that individuals with BD have longer 
total sleep time (TST) and wake after sleep onset (WASO or total duration of overnight 
awakenings) than controls (Geoffroy et al., 2015; Ng et al., 2015; Robillard et al., 2015).

Prior studies have supported a relationship between sleep and mood symptoms in BD. 
Higher PSQI scores have been associated with worse residual depression and earlier mood 
episode relapse in BD (Cretu et al., 2016) as well as more hypomanic symptoms among 
people vulnerable to BD (Hensch et al., 2019). Various objective sleep studies have reported 
relationships between mean sleep measures and mood symptoms, though consensus about 
the most influential aspects of sleep are lacking. One study found that longer TST was 
positively correlated with depressive symptom severity and negatively correlated with manic 
symptom severity (Mukherjee et al., 2018), and another reported that lower sleep efficiency 
predicted worse longitudinal manic symptoms (Robillard et al., 2016).

Furthermore, the intra-individual variability (IIV) of subjective and objective sleep features 
may be more sensitive measures of optimal sleep, compared to mean sleep measures. We 
and other researchers have previously reported that while persons with BD have similar 
mean TST and WASO, they have higher variability in TST, WASO, and sleep onset latency 
compared to non-psychiatric comparison cohorts when measured both by actigraphy-based 
and self-report (Lee et al., 2021; Ng et al., 2015). Hensch et al. (2019) reported that 
hypomanic symptoms were more related to night-by-night variability of sleep duration 
rather than mean measures from actigraphy and PSQI. Recent EMA research has allowed 
for more nuanced assessment of this phenomenon. One EMA study of self-reported sleep 
duration in adults with BD found that participants with more variable sleep duration had 
higher mean daily ratings of anger, anxiety, stress, and impulsivity as well as greater 
variability in daily ratings of energy, sadness, and impulsivity (Kaufmann et al., 2016). 
On a nightly basis, Kaufmann et al. (2016) found that sleep duration of less than 7–8 h 
was associated with higher same-day negative affect and lower positive affect. Additional 
EMA studies have found that mood may be more predictive of sleep than vice versa (Li 
et al., 2019; Merikangas et al., 2019). Passive tracking of sleep may have key clinical 
applications in monitoring early mood changes that reflect onset of manic or depressive 
episodes and provide just-in-time clinical interventions to prevent hospitalization, emergent 
care, or negative outcomes.

Moreover, recent studies have found that people with BD often inaccurately report their 
sleep (Kaufmann et al., 2019; Krishnamurthy et al., 2018). Krishnamurthy et al. (2018) 
found that greater inaccuracy between subjective and objectively assessed TST was 
associated with more severe depression in persons with BD. More refined exploration of 
the different relationships between mood and objective versus subjective sleep may provide 
useful insight for future behavioral interventions targeting sleep.

Using a combination of subjective and objective measures, our study aimed to examine 
the relationships between sleep variability and mood variability, to identify which mood 
states are most strongly associated with subjective and objective sleep measures, and to 
understand the intricacies of how sleep disturbances affect the next day’s mood (and vice 
versa). We focused on how subjective sleep quality and sleep duration is related to mood and 
mood changes. We hypothesized that poorer and more variable self-reported sleep quality 
and sleep duration would be concurrently associated with worse and more variable mood 
ratings among adults with BD. We also hypothesized that poorer quality and more variable 
sleep (TST) would predict worse and more variable mood the following day and vice versa. 
Additionally, we explored the relationships of other subjective sleep measures (efficiency, 
WASO, sleep onset time) to overall mood and day-to-day mood changes.

2.  Methods

2.1.  Subjects

As part of a longitudinal study of aging in BD, English-speaking participants were recruited 
from the greater San Diego area. Data collection was performed in batches from November 
2016 to October 2019. All participants had a BD diagnosis, as determined by Structured 
Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV-TR (SCID) (First et al., 2002). Participants were

excluded if they had: 1) another current DSM-IV-TR Axis I diagnoses; 2) acute illness 
or pregnancy; 3) recent vaccination; 4) history of neurodegenerative or a major neurological 
illness; 5) history of cancer treatment; and 6) uncontrolled medical illness affecting a 
subject’s ability to complete study procedures. DSM-IV-TR criteria were used due to 
harmonization of the study protocol with other accelerated aging studies in schizophrenia 
and post-traumatic stress disorder populations which started prior to 2013, the publication 
date of the DSM-5 criteria. The protocol was approved by the University of California, 
San Diego (UCSD) Human Research Protections Program, and prior to participation, all 
participants gave informed written consent.

The participants completed annual assessments that included wearing a wrist-worn 
actigraphy device for a fourteen-day period, completing three in-clinic assessments, and 
responding to short daily surveys on a mobile device. Some participants had data from 
multiple (2–4) years.

2.2.  Mood assessments

The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is a self-report assessment of manic symptoms 
over the last 48 h (Young et al., 1978). Of the 11-items, seven items are rated from 0 to 
4. The remaining four items (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive 
behavior) are rated on Likert scale from 0 to 8 to compensate for the poor cooperation of 
some patients. Higher scores indicate more manic symptoms.

The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is a 17-item clinician-administered 
assessment of depression over the past week (Hamilton, 1967). Nine of those items are 
scored from 0 (absent) to 4 (incapacitating). The remaining eight items are scored from 0 
(absent) to 2 (present) because they may be more difficult for the patient to classify. Higher 
scores overall indicate higher levels of depression.

The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is an 18-item clinicianrated assessment of 
current psychiatric symptoms (Ventura et al., 1993). Each item is scored on a Likert 
scale ranging from 0 (not assessed) to 7 (extremely severe). Higher scores indicate worse 
psychiatric symptoms.

The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) measures self-reported depression over 
the past 2 weeks (Kroenke et al., 2001). Each item is rated on a Likert scale of 0 (not at all) 
to 3 (nearly every day) with higher scores indicating higher levels of depression.

The Brief Symptom Inventory—Anxiety Subscale (BSIA) is a 6-item subscale of the 
original 53 item assessment (Derogatis and Melisaratos, 1983). Each item is rated on a 
Likert scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Higher scores suggest higher levels of anxiety.

The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) is 30-item self-reported questionnaire assessing 
the personality and behavioral construct of impulsivity (Patton et al., 1995). Each item 
is rated on a Likert scale of 1 (rarely/never) to 4 (almost always/always). Higher scores 
indicate higher levels of impulsivity.

The HAM-D, YMRS, and PHQ-9 scales contain questions about sleep disturbance and 
insomnia.

2.3.  EMA mood survey

During the two-week study burst, participants received ecological momentary assessments 
(EMA surveys) about mood via their mobile device three times each day. The assessments 
were sent sporadically within three intervals specified by the participant: one in the morning, 
one in the afternoon, and one in the evening. Each survey asked the participant to rate the 
intensity of different moods (sadness, anger, anxiety, and impulsivity) on a Likert scale of 1 
(not at all) to 7 (very much).

2.4.  Sleep assessments

Subjective sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (Buysse et 
al., 1989). The Total PSQI score is based on the sum of the seven components: subjective 
sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep 
medication, and daytime dysfunction. Possible scores range from 0 to 21 with higher scores 
indicating worse sleep quality. Subjective sleep quality was also measured daily as part of 
the EMA survey (“How would you rate the quality of your sleep last night?”). Participants 
rated their sleep quality on a 4-point Likert scale (−2 = very bad, −1 = fairly bad, 1 = fairly 
good, 2 = very good).

Objective sleep was measured using the wrist-worn actigraph device, the Actisleep-BT 
(Actigraph, Pensacola, FL), in combination with a sleep diary in which participants recorded 
the previous night’s “go to bed” and “get up” times. For more accurate measurement, 
Cole-Kripke algorithms were used to determine total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, 
wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep onset time (Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003; Cole et 
al., 1992). Sleep efficiency is the percent of total time in bed that is spent sleeping. Sleep 
efficiency was calculated using the ratio of total sleep time to time in bed. WASO is the total 
amount of time awake after the initial bout of sleep. Sleep onset time is the time at which 
sleep began.

2.5.  Variability

For the general analysis of sleep and mood over the two-week burst, we used root mean 
squared successive difference (RMSSD) as an assessment of intra-individual variability due 
to its ability to detect night-to-night changes (Kanady et al., 2017; Straus et al., 2015). 
RMSSD was calculated for both sleep (TST, sleep efficiency, WASO, sleep onset time, and 
EMA Sleep Quality) and mood (sadness, anger, anxiety, and impulsivity.

For the time-lagged analyses, we used atypicality, a measure of how different an individual’s 
sleep or mean mood rating on a given day is from that individual’s average sleep or 
mood over the entire burst period. This metric was calculated by squaring the difference 
between the individual’s mean value and their specific day’s value (Kaufmann et al., 2016). 
Atypicality was calculated for each of the sleep and mood measures. Higher atypicality 
values represent a more abnormal sleep or mood value for that day for that person.

2.6.  Statistical analysis

Page 6

For this study sample, we included individuals with both actigraphy and EMA data for 2–11 
days to maximize the sample and allow for comparable variability calculations. Variables 
were assessed for violation of distribution assumptions. Mann-Whitney U test, independent 
sample t-tests and chi-square tests were used to assess differences in sociodemographic, 
psychopathology, physical health, mood, and sleep variables between the BD groups with 
one vs. with two or more assessments.

Linear mixed models (LMMs) were constructed to examine the relationship between mean 
sleep variables and mean mood variables. To study the specific utility of examining 
variability in both sleep and mood, we used time-lagged analyses (LMMs) to study how 
poor sleep or changes in sleep are associated with mood the following day and vice versa. In 
models examining how sleep influenced the following day’s mood, the dependent variables 
were mood states and independent variables were sleep measurements from the previous 
night. Additional models examined the relationship between mood and the subsequent 
night’s sleep, with the dependent variables as sleep measures and independent variables as 
mean and atypicality of mood ratings.

Significance level (α) was set at .05 (two-tailed) for all analyses. False Discovery Rate 
(FDR) was used to account for multiple comparisons in the hypothesis-driven regression 
models (sleep quality and TST) to ensure overall Type 1 error at α 0.05. Exploratory 
analyses on additional sleep measures (efficiency, WASO, and sleep onset time) were not 
FDR-corrected. Because effect sizes cannot be obtained from LMM’s, mood and sleep 
variables were standardized before analyses to make them more comparable to one another 
and produce more meaningful B-estimates. Analyses were conducted in SPSS Statistics for 
Macintosh, Version 26 and 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA).

2.7.  Covariates

All LMMs controlled for age, gender, education, and race. Random mixed effects controlled 
for participant and year. The role, if any, of sleep medications as a proxy of hyperarousal 
or in confounding the sleep-mood relationships is not clear. Results were similar when 
conducting the analyses with and without adjusting for sleep medications, so we presented 
the analyses without sleep medications for simplicity. LMMs analyzing mean mood and 
sleep included the RMSSD of the sleep measure as a covariate. Time-lagged models 
included both the mean sleep measure and atypicality measure to examine the individual 
impact of both factors. Prior day’s mood was also a covariate in the time-lagged models 
to control for its influence on mood the following day. For models assessing relationships 
between mood atypicality and the following night’s sleep, average same-day mood was 
included as a covariate to ensure the association of atypicality was independent from mood 
overall.

3.  Results

The study sample included 56 individuals with BD, 22 with a single assessment and 34 
with two or more annual assessments (Table 1). On average, we analyzed 68 surveys

per participant, making up 78% of overall deployed surveys. Overall, the mean age of 
participants at their first visit was about 47 years old. Most participants were female 
and Caucasian. Participants had 15 years of education and most reported use of sleep 
medication. The two groups (one vs. two or more assessments) differed by years of 
education, such that participants with two or more assessments were significantly more 
educated.

Mean EMA ratings of anxiety were significantly correlated (rs = 0.29–0.56) with the scores 
on all validated mood rating scales (BPRS, YMRS, HAM-D, PHQ-9, BSIA, and BIS). EMA 
ratings of sadness were significantly correlated with all mood scales except the BIS (rs = 
0.26–0.48). Mean EMA ratings for anger were correlated with all mood scales except the 
PHQ-9 and BIS (rs = 0.31–0.49). Mean EMA ratings for impulsivity were correlated with 
YMRS, BPRS, and BSIA scores (rs = 0.23–0.34), but not with the BIS.

3.1.  Linear mixed models of concurrent mood and sleep measures

As summarized in Fig. 1, linear mixed models show that mean mood ratings are related 
to subjective sleep quality measures. After FDR correction, two relationships remained 
significant. Worse self-reported sleep quality (via EMA) was associated with greater overall 
sadness (B = −0.48, SE = 0.10, FDR-corrected p = <0.001) and anger (B = −0.38, SE = 0.11, 
FDR-corrected p = 0.01).

Exploratory analyses found that more variable sleep onset time was associated with worse 
mean mood ratings (anger, anxiety, impulsivity) and more variable ratings of anger. Greater 
WASO was associated with more variable ratings of anxiety, and more variable WASO was 
associated with greater mean impulsivity.

3.2.  Time-lagged analysis of sleep and mood

One relationship between sleep and the following day’s mood remained significant after 
FDR correction. Poorer EMA sleep quality was associated with greater sadness the next day 
(independent of average sadness the day prior) (B = −0.14, SE = 0.03, FDR-corrected p = 
<0.001). Models analyzing the relationship of mood to sleep the next night found higher 
daytime impulsivity predicted worse EMA sleep quality that evening (B = −0.14, SE = 
0.04, FDR-corrected p = 0.03). No other relationships between sleep and mood or mood 
atypicality the next day or vice versa remained significant.

Exploratory time-lagged models on additional objective sleep measures (efficiency, WASO, 
sleep onset) found several relationships between sleep and mood, independent of mean 
mood ratings the day prior (Supplemental Figs, 1a and 1b). These included relationships 
between atypicality of sleep efficiency and atypicality of anxiety, later sleep onset time with 
worse sadness the following day. Atypicality of mood was also associated with sleep the 
following day. Greater atypicality of sadness and anger predicted later sleep onset time and 
greater atypicality of sleep onset time that evening. Greater mean daytime impulsivity was 
associated with more atypical sleep efficiency that night. Greater atypicality of impulsivity 
predicted greater WASO the subsequent night

4.  Discussion

Page 8

These findings support the hypotheses of strong associations between mood and subjective 
sleep quality among adults with bipolar disorder. Mean ratings of sadness and anger were 
associated with mean self-reported sleep quality, but not with objective sleep measures. 
Time-lagged analyses found that worse EMA sleep quality was associated with greater 
sadness the next day. Further, greater daytime impulsivity predicted worse sleep quality that 
night. Exploratory analyses (not FDR-adjusted) on objective sleep measures revealed several 
associations of mood and mood atypicality with the previous and following night’s sleep.

The current study participants were similar by gender and race to previous studies, though 
the mean age was older (Kanady et al., 2017; Kaufmann et al., 2016; Ng et al., 2015; 
Robillard et al., 2015). Our study sample had worse mean subjective sleep quality assessed 
by PSQI than three studies (Gershon et al., 2012; Harvey et al., 2005; Kanady et al., 2017), 
and similar objective sleep measures to four studies (Kanady et al., 2017; Kaufmann et al., 
2016; Ng et al., 2015; Robillard et al., 2015).

The present study supports the utility of EMA ratings to assess unique mood states (i.e., 
anger and impulsivity) in BD, separate from commonly used clinical rating scales for 
psychopathology, depression, and mania. Mean EMA ratings were significantly correlated 
with most clinical mood scales, supporting the validity of EMA surveys as a measure 
of mood and mood symptoms. Moreover, our results suggest that EMA may provide 
additional insight into changing mood states that are not always captured via traditional 
clinical measurement. For example, EMA impulsivity was not associated with BIS scores, 
suggesting that moment-to-moment ratings of impulsivity may be distinct from trait-like 
impulsivity. EMA-based mood ratings capture a diversity of mood states that provide valid, 
unique, and non-overlapping information about the BD participants.

The current study found that mean mood ratings were associated with poor subjective 
sleep quality, but not worse objectively measured sleep averaged over the burst period. 
This is consistent with two previous studies that reported links between poor sleep quality, 
hypomania, mood volatility, and depression in high-risk for BD and BD samples (Cretu 
et al., 2016; Hensch et al., 2019). However, the current study’s findings differed from 
studies that reported links between sleep duration and mood ratings (Gruber et al., 2011; 
Kaufmann et al., 2016; Mukherjee et al., 2018), which could be attributable to our use of 
actigraphy-assessed TST or the longer 14-day monitoring period.

Our findings suggest that mood and mood changes may be more closely related to subjective 
sleep experiences rather than objective measurements. It is possible that inaccuracies in self-
reported sleep may have contributed to these findings. Krishnamurthy et al. (2018) found 
that individuals with BD report their sleep more inaccurately than their healthy counterparts. 
Further, the authors found depressive symptoms in people with BD to be associated with 
greater inaccuracy between self-reported and actigraphy-based TST rather than lower TST 
overall. Future sleep interventions should account for both subjective and objective sleep to 
personalize and better target health outcomes.

The current study found that higher mean impulsivity was associated with worse EMA 
sleep quality the subsequent night. Previous studies have demonstrated similar associations 
between poor/disturbed sleep and increased impulsivity in BD (Gershon et al., 2019; 
Russo et al., 2015), that may be mediated by brain connectivity (Tashjian et al., 2017) 
and the ability of certain brain areas (e.g., PFC) to inhibit and modulate emotional input 
(Anderson and Platten, 2011; McKenna and Eyler, 2012). The ability to inhibit impulsive 
responses may decrease as sleep quality deteriorates, resulting in a cycle of poorer sleep 
and gradually more impulsive behavior over time. Our impulsivity-related findings have 
important clinical implications, given that emotion-triggered impulsivity is associated with 
negative sequelae in BD, including risky behavior, suicidality, and self-harm (Johnson et al., 
2017). Consequently, reducing impulsivity is a critical clinical target, and improving sleep 
quality may provide an important means of intervention.

Exploratory time-lagged analyses found that worse and more variable mood predicted 
objective and subjective sleep measures the following night, while sleep did not predict 
subsequent mood as consistently. These findings were analogous to Li et al. (2019), 
which examined 14-day self-report sleep measures with positive/negative affect, energy, 
impulsivity, and speed of thoughts in 20 participants (10 BD and 10 controls). Among the 
BD group, positive affect, energy, impulsivity, and speed of thoughts predicted lower total 
sleep time. Alternatively, Merikangas et al. (2019) examined objective sleep measures and 
EMA ratings of sadness, energy, and activity among 242 participants (including participants 
with major depressive disorder and BD). Greater activity predicted shorter total sleep time 
in all participants. Among participants with bipolar disorder type I, increased activity was 
associated with changes in sad mood and vice versa. Thus, physical activity appears to 
mediate the links between mood and sleep. The complex interrelationships between mood, 
sleep, and physical activity warrant further investigation.

Future studies should consider sleep- and activity-focused interventions for BD. For 
example, Interpersonal and Social Rhythms Therapy (IPSRT) is a form of psychotherapy 
that aims to stabilize circadian rhythm through stabilizing daily social rhythms (Frank et al., 
2000). An important part of IPSRT is to regulate sleep and wake times. BD participants who 
undergo IPSRT have improved depressive and manic symptomatology as well as clinical 
psychological functioning in some (Crowe et al., 2020; Frank et al., 2000; Inder et al., 
2015; Steardo et al., 2020) but not all studies (Frank et al., 2000). Effective interventions 
for improving sleep quality (e.g., CBT for Insomnia) may also have a role in improving 
mood, preventing the cyclical pattern of worsening mood and sleep. Furthermore, measuring 
sleep disturbance could allow clinicians to track mood among patients with BD, assessing 
individual-level changes over time.

Our study has a few limitations. Our sample size is modest (n = 56) and has moderately 
heterogeneous sleep. Future studies should examine these relationships in larger and more 
diverse samples with longer follow-up and more variable sleep. Our sample of people with 
BD are community-dwelling outpatients with relatively stable symptoms, so results may not 
be generalizable to inpatients or those in acute manic or depressive episodes. The current 
sample is also demographically homogenous, so our findings may not be generalizable 
to persons with BD across age and cultural groups as they do not account for social

determinants of health (Dietch et al., 2017; Smagula et al., 2016). Additionally, the sample 
did not include a healthy comparison group, so it is unclear if these findings are unique to 
bipolar patients specifically. Although they are valuable research tools, actigraphy watches 
and EMA surveys are not infallible. Actigraphy watches may mis-categorize periods of 
inactivity as sleep and vice versa. Our study of the EMA survey data was limited to four 
mood states, which may not fully capture all possible relationships between mood and 
sleep. The analyses did not account for concurrent mood states (e.g., high anxiety plus high 
anger). Despite these limitations, this study sheds new light on links between subjective and 
objective sleep with mood in BD.

Future EMA studies of the sleep-mood relationship in BD should include subjective and 
objective sleep assessments for a more comprehensive understanding of this connection. 
Further, additional research is required to confirm which aspects of mood are associated 
with sleep the previous night and vice versa. A larger sample size and extended actigraphy 
monitoring period may reveal more robust relationships. The prediction of mood changes 
through sleep assessment may allow for novel preventative measures in bipolar disorder 
through sleep management as well as short term adjustments to improve quality of life in 
adults with BD.
