HIGHLIGHTS 
• GBTM models estimated 
trajectories of PTS and 
depression symptoms from 
2 weeks to 9 months post-
trauma. 

• PTSS trajectories were 
highly consistent with 
depression trajectories. 
• Cognitive appraisal was the 
shared risk factor to high 
symptom groups in PTSS 
and depression.

ABSTRACT
Objective: Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression have high comorbidity. Understanding 
their relationship is of clinical and theoretical importance. A comprehensive way to understand 
post-trauma  psychopathology  is  through  symptom  trajectories.  This  study  aims  to  look  at  the 
developmental  courses  of  PTSD  and  depression  symptoms  and  their  interrelationship  in  the 
initial months post-trauma in children and adolescents.
Methods: Two-hundred-and-seventeen children and adolescents aged between eight and 17 
exposed  to  single-event  trauma  were  included  in  the  study.  Post-traumatic  stress  symptoms 
(PTSS)  and  depression  symptoms  were  measured  at  2  weeks,  2  months  and  9  months,  with 
further  psychological  variables  measured  at  the  2-week  assessment.  Group-based  trajectory 
modelling  (GBTM)  was  applied  to  estimate  the  latent  developmental  clusters  of  the  two 
outcomes.  Logistic  regression  was  used  to  identify  predictors  associated  with  high  symptom 
groups.
Results:  The  GBTM  yielded  a  three-group  model  for  PTSS  and  a  three-group  model  for 
depression.  PTSS  trajectories  showed  symptoms  reduced  to  a  non-clinical  level  by  9  months 
for  all  participants  (if  they  were  not  already  in  the  non-clinical  range):  participants  were 
observed  to  be  resilient  (42.4%)  or  recovered  within  2  months  (35.6%),  while  21.9%  experi-
enced  high  level  PTSS  but  recovered  by  9  months  post-trauma.  The  depression  symptom 
trajectories  predicted  a  chronic  non-recovery  group  (20.1%)  and  two  mild  symptom  groups 
(45.9%,  34.0%).  Further  analysis  showed  high  synchronicity  between  PTSS  and  depression 
groups.  Peri-event  panic,  negative  appraisals,  rumination  and  thought  suppression  at 
2  weeks  predicted  slow  recovery  from  PTSS.  Pre-trauma  wellbeing,  post-trauma  anxiety  and 
negative appraisals predicted chronic depression.
Conclusions:  Post-trauma  depression  was  more  persistent  than  PTSS  at  9  months  in  the 
sampled  population.  Cognitive  appraisal  was  the  shared  risk  factor  to  high  symptom  groups 
of both PTSS and depression.

Trayectoria del Estrés Postraumático y la Depresión entre Niños 
y Adolescentes después de un Incidente único de Trauma
Objetivo:  El  trastorno  de  estrés  postraumático  y  la  depresión  tienen  una  alta  comorbilidad. 
Comprender su relación es de importancia clínica y teórica. Una forma integral de comprender 
la  psicopatología  postraumática  es  a  través  de  las  trayectorias  de  los  síntomas.  Este  estudio 
tiene como objetivo observar los cursos de desarrollo del TEPT y los síntomas de depresión y su 
interrelación en los primeros meses posteriores al trauma en niños/ñas y adolescentes.
Métodos: Se incluyeron en el estudio 217 niños/ñas y adolescentes de ocho a diecisiete años 
expuestos  a  un  evento  traumático  único.  Los  síntomas  de  estrés  postraumático  (SEPT)  y  los 
síntomas  de  depresión  se  midieron  a  las  2  semanas,  2  meses  y  9  meses,  con  otras  variables 
psicológicas  medidas  en  la  evaluación  de  2  semanas.  Se  aplicó  un  modelo  de  trayectoria 
basado en grupos (MTBG) para estimar los grupos de desarrollo latentes de los dos resultados. 
Se utilizó la regresión logística para identificar predictores asociados con grupos de síntomas 
elevados.
Resultados: El MTBG arrojó un modelo de tres grupos para SEPT y un modelo de tres grupos 
para depresión. Las trayectorias de SEPT mostraron síntomas reducidos a un nivel no clínico en 
9 meses para todos los participantes (si ellos aún no estaban en el rango no clínico): se observó

una recuperación lenta del SEPT. El bienestar pre-traumático, la ansiedad post-traumática y las 
valoraciones negativas predijeron la depresión crónica.
Conclusiones: La depresión post-traumática fue más persistente que el SEPT a los 9 meses en

1. Introduction

The  co-occurrence  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD)  and  depression  has  been  widely  observed. 
Rytwinski,  Scur,  Feeny,  and  Youngstrom  (2013) 
reported  that  the  prevalence  of  PTSD  and  major 
depression  disorder  comorbidity  was  52%  (95%  CI 
[48,  56])  in  adults.  Another  meta-analysis  estimated 
the  prevalence  of  depression  to  be  24.2%  (95%  CI 
[20.6–28.0])  in  trauma-exposed  children  and  adoles-
cents, and the odds ratio of having a depression diag-
nosis to be 2.6 (95% CI [2.0, 3.3]) for those exposed to 
trauma, compared with no or only mild trauma expo-
sure (Vibhakar, Allen, Gee, & Meiser-Stedman, 2019). 
The  high  rates  of  co-occurrence  across  age  groups 
suggest this is an issue of some clinical and theoretical 
importance.

PTSD-depression  comorbidity  is  known  for  being 
associated  with  more  severe  impairments  in  various 
domains (Cook et al., 2017) and the key question with 
regard  to  their  relationship  has  been  ‘is  depression 
part of the PTSD symptoms or are they two indepen-
dent trauma responses?’ Prior studies investigated the 
question  mainly  by  looking  into  hazard  ratio,  preva-
lence,  risk  factors  and  vulnerabilities  (Breslau,  Davis, 
Peterson,  &  Schultz,  2000;  Shalev  et  al.,  1998; 
Spinhoven,  Penninx,  van  Hemert,  de  Rooij,  & 
Elzinga,  2014).  The  consensus  is  that  while  the  two 
evidently  share  common  risk  factors  and  vulnerabil-
ities,  they  are  viewed  as  independent  diagnoses 
because  post-traumatic  depression  is  beyond  a  mere 

sharing of common symptoms (Jovanovic et al., 2010; 
Stander, Thomsen, & Highfill-Mcroy, 2014).

Although these early studies helped to understand 
how  PTSD  and  depression  may  relate,  Stander  et  al. 
(2014)  pointed  out  that  most  of  these  studies  were 
limited to examination of associations between PTSD 
and  depression  at  the  macro  level.  They  therefore 
suggested that future research should consider identi-
fying the time-sensitive mechanisms that facilitate and 
mediate  comorbidity.  This  point  of  view  echoed 
Bonanno’s  (2004)  argument  that  interpretation  of 
post-traumatic  responses  would  only  be  meaningful 
when  symptoms  were  considered  in  their  temporal 
context. This argument was based on the observations 
that there are a wide range of individual differences in 
responding to a potentially traumatic event over time. 
Bonanno further proposed four prototypical trajectory 
patterns (Bonanno, 2004), namely: resilient, recovery, 
delayed and chronic trajectories. In PTSD, these pat-
terns  are  frequently  observed  despite  diversity  in  the 
nature  of  the  traumas  (Galatzer-Levy,  Huang,  & 
Bonanno,  2018).  These  trajectories  are  also  found  in 
the  youth  population.  Several  children  studies  have 
reported  that  a  majority  of  trauma-exposed  children 
and teenagers may experience elevated distress during 
the  acute  phase,  but  many  recover  (recovery)  while 
some present persistently low (resilient) or high symp-
toms (chronic) over time (Hong et al., 2014; La Greca 
et  al.,  2013;  Lauterbach  &  Armour,  2016;  Punamäki, 

Palosaari, Diab, Peltonen, & Qouta, 2015). Late onset 
(delayed)  is  relatively  less  reported  (Bonde  et  al., 
2021),  however,  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  evi-
dence is only available for adult data.

The  implication  of  recognizing  individual  differ-
ences  in  trajectories  is  pivotal.  If  we  are  able  to 
describe  the  developmental  patterns  of  symptoms 
and  to  explain  what  causes  the  large  discrepancies 
between  trajectories  after  similar  trauma  exposure, 
we  will  have  a  better  understanding  of  post-trauma 
psychopathology.  With  the  application  of  trajectory 
modelling,  a  technique  specially  devised  to  identify 
latent  longitudinal  clusters,  more  studies  exploring 
PTSD  and  depression  trajectories  have  emerged.  For 
example,  deRoon-Cassini,  Mancini,  Rusch,  and 
Bonanno (2010) conducted a latent class growth ana-
lysis  (LCGA)  study  in  adult  traumatic  injury.  They 
reported four PTSD symptom trajectories (low symp-
tom  59%,  chronic  22%,  delayed  6%  and  recovering 
13%)  and  four  similar  depression  groups.  Overall, 
69.7%  of  participants  were  in  accordance  with  the 
assigned PTSD group (e.g. low PTSD and low depres-
sion).  Further,  they  found  that  individuals  in  the 
chronic PTSD and depression group were more likely 
to have been assaulted, had higher levels of anger and 
less coping self-efficacy.

Taking  the  same  approach,  the  present  study  first 
aimed  to  look  at  the  natural  trajectories  of  post- 
traumatic  stress  symptoms  (PTSS)  and  depression 
symptoms  in  children  and  adolescents  by  utilizing 
group-based  trajectory  modelling  (GBTM).  GBTM, 
equivalent to LCGA, has evinced reliable performance 
in identifying latent developmental clusters in clinical 
research  (Nagin  &  Odgers,  2010;  Twisk  &  Hoekstra, 
2012). The modelling algorithm analyses the overarch-
ing  symptom  changes  over  multiple  time  points  and 
classifies  each  participant  into  one  particular  profile 
group  according  to  probability.  Secondly,  we  were 
interested  to  know  whether  PTSS  and  depression 
symptoms  develop  in  synchrony.  The  examination 
was  carried  out  using  joint  trajectory  modelling  that 
returns  conditional  probabilities  linking  trajectory 
groups  across  two  respective  outcomes  (Jones  & 
Nagin,  2007).  The  results  report  the  probability  of 
being  assigned  to  a  group  in  PTSS  and  the  chance 
they  would  be  categorized 
(or 
the  same 
a different) group in their depression trajectory.

in 

Following Hong and colleagues’ study (Hong et al., 
2014),  which  also  comprised  children  and  adolescents 
who had been exposed to single incident (mainly non- 
interpersonal  injury),  we  hypothesized  that  the  trajec-
tory  modelling  for  both  PTSS  and  depression  would 
result in a majority falling into either the low symptoms 
or recovery groups, and only a small group who would 
be  chronically  distressed/depressed.  Importantly,  in 
addition to classifying trajectory profiles, we also sought

to identify the potential risk factors associated with the 
high symptom group in comparison to the low symp-
tom group. By evaluating the risks predicting PTSS with 
those predicting depression, we aimed to reveal shared 
processes involved in comorbidity.

The putative risk factors chosen in this study were 
based on the findings from a risk factor meta-analysis 
for  PTSS  in  children  and  adolescents  (Trickey, 
Siddaway,  Meiser-Stedman,  Serpell,  &  Field,  2012). 
Their  study  examined  25  types  of  risk  that  included 
demographic, trauma characteristics, and post-trauma 
environmental  and  psychological  factors.  They  con-
cluded  that  subjective  peri-trauma  factors  and  post- 
event  factors,  primarily  cognitive  processes  (e.g. 
thought  suppression,  blaming  others,  perceived 
threat) are likely to have a major role in the onset of 
PTSD.

Naturally,  the  following  question  would  be  how 
much  these  risks  are  involved  in  depression.  We 
hypothesized that the role of age and gender in PTSS 
might differ from depression. Gender and age are not 
significant  risks  for  PTSD  as  per  the  previous  study 
(Meiser-Stedman  et  al.,  2019),  whereas  depression 
tends to be more prevalent in older female adolescents 
among 
(Allgood-Merten, 
Lewinsohn, & Hops, 1990; Saluja et al., 2004; Thapar, 
Collishaw, Pine, & Thapar, 2012).

school-age  population 

We also predicted that cognitive processes could be 
the  common  risks  for  PTSD  and  depression  post- 
trauma.  Maladaptive  appraisal  and  cognitive  coping 
(e.g.  rumination,  thought  suppression)  have  been 
found  to  be  robust  in  maintaining  PTSD  symptoms 
(Ehlers & Clark, 2000; Lavi & Solomon, 2005; Meiser- 
Stedman, Dalgleish, Smith, Yule, & Glucksman, 2007; 
Stallard & Smith, 2007). Negative cognitive style (e.g. 
rumination, self- blaming) is also predictive of depres-
sion (Alloy et al., 2000, 2006).

In  summary,  we  hypothesized  that  PTSS  and  post- 
trauma  depression  are  two  reactions  to  trauma  which 
follow matching developmental courses and share cer-
tain risks. To examine the elements of the relationship, 
the study used a trajectory modelling approach, where 
the differences and similarities were compared in three 
ways: 1) symptom changes in time (trajectories); 2) the 
synchronicity of the trajectories: and 3) their predictors.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants

The  study  used  longitudinal  data  collected  by  the 
Acute Stress Programme for Children and Teenagers 
(ASPECTS),  a  project  set  up  to  study  acute  PTSD 
among children and adolescents. Two previous studies 
have focused on the acute time frame at 2 weeks and 
2  months  (Meiser-Stedman  et  al.,  2017,  2019);  these

studies used the extended data collected at 9 months. 
Participants  were  consenting  child  and  adolescent 
attendees (8–17 years) at four emergency departments 
(EDs)  in  the  East  of  England  following  single  event 
trauma between 3 September 2010 and 30 April 2013. 
The potentially traumatic events included assault, road 
traffic  accident 
injury. 
Participants who did not complete the questionnaires 
at 2 weeks were not included in the present study. Ten 
cases  with  high  PTSS  measurement  scores  were 
referred  for  treatment  after  T2,  and  were  therefore 
excluded from T3 data in the study.

(RTA)  and  accidental 

2.2. Symptom measures

All  symptom  and  predictors  measures  used  in  the 
study were child-report. The two key variables of the 
study were the severity of PTSS and depression symp-
toms  after  trauma.  These  were  measured  using  the 
Child  PTSD  Symptom  Scale  (CPSS;  Foa,  Johnson, 
Feeny,  &  Treadwell,  2001)  and  the  Short  Mood  and 
Feelings  Questionnaire  (SMFQ;  Angold,  Costello, 
Messer, & Pickles, 1995).

The  CPSS  is  a  self-report  questionnaire  developed 
to  assess  PTSS  for  school-aged  children.  It  is  com-
prised of 24 items that can be divided into two parts. 
The first 17 items measure the type and frequency of 
PTSS  (mapping  directly  on  to  DSM-IV  criteria  for 
PTSD),  while  the  other  seven  items  measure  the 
degree  of  impairment  in  functioning.  It  has  shown 
high  reliability  and  validity  across  various  types  of 
trauma  (Foa  et  al.,  2001;  Gillihan,  Aderka,  Conklin, 
Capaldi, & Foa, 2013; Nixon et al., 2013). A score of 16 
was considered a clinical cut-off (Nixon et al., 2013).

The  SMFQ  is  a  short  version  (13  items)  of  the 
Mood  and  Feelings  Questionnaire,  an  inventory  that 
measures  depressive  symptoms  in  children  and  ado-
lescents.  Each  item  is  rated  on  a  3-point  scale:  ‘true’, 
‘sometimes  true’,  and  ‘not  true’  with  respect  to  their 
mood  and  feelings  in  the  past  2  weeks.  It  has  been 
shown to be an efficient discriminative tool for school- 
age  children  (Cheng,  Cao,  &  Su,  2009;  Thabrew, 
Stasiak, Bavin, Frampton, & Merry, 2018) through to 
late  adolescents  (Turner,  Joinson,  Peters,  Wiles,  & 
Lewis, 2014). A total score of eight or higher signifies 
clinical levels of depression (Angold et al., 1995).

2.3. Predictor measures

We considered eight main factors comprised of three 
domains controlled at the baseline: demographic (age, 
gender),  peri-event  panic,  and  post-trauma  cognitive 
processes  (appraisal,  adaptive  processing,  thought 
suppression, rumination and self-blame). In addition, 
anxiety is believed to have a bidirectional relation with 
depression  (Jacobson  &  Newman,  2017),  therefore, 

post-trauma anxiety was added to our set of putative 
predictor  measures.  Last,  it  is  prudent  to  have  pre- 
trauma emotional wellbeing controlled as the baseline 
in the model to eliminate the chance of the observed 
PTSS  and  depression  symptoms  being  the  result  of 
pre-existing mental health difficulties.

The  scores  of  the  ten  independent  variables  were 
mostly  derived  from  measures  developed  in  previous 
studies (Meiser-Stedman et al., 2019). Pre-trauma emo-
tional  well-being  was  assessed  using  the  adapted  10 
items  from  the  Post-traumatic  Adjustment  Scale 
(CPAS) (O’Donnell et al., 2008; α = 0.81) that indexes 
anxiety,  low  mood  and  anger.  Peri-event  panic  (CPP) 
was assessed using a 10-item questionnaire addressing 
the symptoms associated with a panic disorder diagno-
sis (Meiser-Stedman et al., 2019; α = .72). Post-trauma 
anxiety  was  assessed  using  the  Spence  Children’s 
Anxiety  Scale  (SCAS;  Spence,  1998;  α  =  0.91). 
Negative 
trauma-related  appraisals  were  assessed 
using  the  Child  Post-Traumatic  Cognitions  Inventory 
(CPTCI; Meiser-Stedman et al., 2009; α = .92), a 25-item 
self-report  designed  to  assess  dysfunctional  trauma- 
related  cognitions.  Thought  suppression  (Children’s 
Thought Suppression Questionnaire, CTSQ) and rumi-
nation were assessed using five and three questionnaire 
items  from  a  previous  study  that  examined  thought 
control strategies and rumination in youths with acute 
stress  disorder  (Meiser-Stedman  et  al.,  2014;  α  =  .85). 
Adaptive  processing,  referring  to  deliberate  efforts  to 
mentally clarify what happened in the traumatic event, 
was  assessed  using  a  five-item  measure  (Children’s 
Adaptive  Processing  Questionnaire,  CAPQ;  Meiser- 
Stedman  et  al.,  2019;  α  =  .73).  Self-blame,  referring  to 
a  cognitive  process  in  which  a  person  attributes  the 
stress  event  to  oneself,  was  assessed  using  a  two-item 
measure (i.e. ‘I made the event happen’, ‘it was my fault

2.4. Procedure

The study was approved by the UK National Research 
Ethics  Service,  Cambridgeshire  1  Research  Ethics 
Committee (10/H0304/11). Parents provided informed 
consent  on  behalf  of  their  children,  and  the  child  or 
young person’s assent was also required for study entry.
ED research nurses reviewed and screened cases of 
children  attending  ED.  The  parents/caregivers  of  eli-
gible  children  were  initially  contacted  by  letter  2– 
4  days  post-ED  attendance.  The  nurses  excluded 
cases of chronic trauma exposure, intellectual disabil-
ity,  organic  brain  damage,  significant  self-harm  and 
not  being  a  fluent  English  speaker  based  on  clinical 
records and parents’ report at the initial contact. After 
T2  (the  screening  phase),  participants  with  elevated 
symptoms  were  referred  for  intervention.  At  T3  fol-
low-up,  those  who  sought/received  counselling  or 

treatment  were  documented while  the  data  were  col-
lected  as  usual.  As  the  current  study  focused  on  nat-
ural  trajectory,  we  decided  to  exclude  data  of 
participants  (n  =  10)  who  received  multiple  sessions 
of  an active psychological intervention for PTSD fol-
lowing T2. Children who had other forms of psycho-
logical  input,  such  as  one  session  counselling  or 
treatment for other reasons, were still included.

Consenting  participants  completed  self-report 
questionnaires  at  2  weeks  (T1),  2  months  (T2)  and 
9 months (T3) via the telephone or online survey. The 
survey at T1 and T2 comprised the PTSS and depres-
sion  measures  previously  described  and  the  10  risk 
variables.  The  9-month  follow-up  only  included  the 
PTSS  and  depression  measures.  Demographic  infor-
mation,  nature  of  the  incident,  injury  severity  and 
medical  treatment  were  obtained  from  the  ED.  PTSS 
and depression symptoms (assessed by the CPSS and 
SMFQ,  respectively)  at  T1,  T2  and  T3  were  used  for 
trajectory  modelling.  Predictive  variables  were  all 
from T1.

2.5. Statistical analysis

The  data  analysis  followed  several  steps.  First,  the 
distribution  of  CPSS  and  SMFQ  was  checked  in 
order  to determine the distribution choice for trajec-
tory  modelling.  We  then  used  the  GBTM  program 
‘Proc  Traj’  to  run  modelling  for  CPSS  and  SMFQ 
separately  to  estimate  their  candidate  models.  These 
candidate  models  were  assessed  by  their  Bayesian 
Information  Criterion  (BIC)  values  along  with  other 
interpretive criteria so that we could choose a best fit 
model  for  each  of  the  two  measures.  Next,  a  joint 
trajectory model was carried out based on the chosen 
individual models with a dropout option that compen-
sated  for  missing  data.  The  joint  trajectory  returned 
fine-tuned  trajectory  probability  groups  as  final 
results, together with the conditional probability that 
indexed the connection between the CPSS and SMFQ 
trajectory  groups.  Finally,  we  utilized  logistic  regres-
sion  analysis  to  investigate  the  link  between  the  pre-
dictors and the high symptom groups. Details of each 
step are as follows.

2.5.1. Data analysis software – Proc Traj
Proc  Traj  is  a  SAS/STATA  procedure  developed  by 
Jones, Nagin, and Roeder (2001). It uses a specialized 
application  of  finite  mixture  modelling  to  estimate 
trajectories  and  does  not  assume  a  one  size-fits-all 
model for characterizing symptom onset and progres-
sion. Beside the basic modelling function, the package 
has  been  extended  with  functions  such  as  dual- 
trajectory  modelling  (Jones  &  Nagin,  2007).  Detailed 
documentation of the Traj procedure can be found at 
https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/bjones/.

2.5.2. Distribution estimation
Estimating  the  distribution  of  CPSS  and  SMFQ  vari-
ables became necessary so that an appropriate model-
ling  option  (CNORM  vs.  ZIP)  could  be  chosen.  An 
R  package,  ‘fitdistrplus’  (https://cran.r-project.org/ 
web/packages/fitdistrplus/index.html)  was  employed 
to  ascertain  the  distribution  of  the  scores  of  CPSS 
and  SMFQ  at  T1.  Negative  exponential  distribution 
was  then  considered  the  best  fit  for  both  variables 
across  the  three  time  points  (see  Appendix  B). 
Therefore, ZIP distribution was chosen for the trajec-
tory modelling.

2.5.3. Single modelling
Given the exploratory nature of modelling, there was 
no guarantee the procedure would find a successful fit 
and  so  determining  starting  values  becomes  critical 
(Jones  et  al.,  2001).  Single  modelling  was  used  to 
approximate  the  parameters  of  the  CPSS  and  SMFQ 
trajectories  separately  before  embarking  on  the  joint 
modelling.  Based  on  previous  findings  in  the  litera-
ture, potential models with three and four groups were 
tested. A model of two groups was included as baseline 
for comparison.

where  λj
it  is  the  event  of  interest  i  at  time  t,  given

time point at time t lapsed since the event. The model’s 
coefficients  –  βj
4  –  determine  the 
shape  of  the  trajectory.  Since  Proc  Traj  allows  up  to 
four  degrees,  our  strategy  was  to  probe  the  possible 
combinations  of  a  group’s  polynomial  order  and  to 
find their highest significant (p < .05) degree.

2.5.4. Model selection
Once  the  single  modelling  was  completed,  a  best-fit 
model was selected for each of the outcome measures. 
Although  Jones  et  al.  (2001)  recommended  an  algo-
rithm using two times the change of the BIC values of 
the adjacent models as the criterion, we argued that it 
is equally important to realize that depending solely on 
a statistical figure might fail to identify a model that is 
clinically meaningful and succinct.

2.5.5. Joint modelling
This was the second step of the modelling analysis. It 
was undertaken to refine the trajectories and to calcu-
late the conditional probability of group membership 
based on Bayesian theorem, in order to make immedi-
ate linkage between the trajectory groups of PTSS and 
depression.  The  configurations  of  the  two  selected 
models  produced  by  the  previous  steps  were  entered 

6

J. ZHANG ET AL.

into  the  joint  modelling  function.  False  convergence 
warning  was  given  after  the  first  iteration,  therefore 
a fine-tuning was needed. We used the option ‘detail’ 
to obtain the parameters returned from the first itera-
tion.  We  removed  insignificant  parameters  (p  >  .05) 
and entered the rest into a second iteration as starting 
values (see complete STATA script in supplementary 
material Appendix C). The program adjusted well and 
the model was finalized.

2.5.6. Dropout analysis
Attrition has been a challenge for longitudinal studies 
and where data is missing careful handling is required 
or there will be a high risk of bias in the results yielded. 
Strategies  for  handling  missing  data  may  depend  on 
whether  the  data  are  missing  completely  at  random 
(MCAR), missing at random (MAR) or missing not at 
random (MNAR). In practice, the difference between 
MCAR, MAR and MNAR is often too elusive to ascer-
tain (Graham, 2009).

There  was  an  attrition  rate  of  approximately  one- 
third at nine months in our study and the randomness 
of the missing data was hard to estimate. Fortunately, 
Haviland, Jones, and Nagin (2011) have extended the 
Proc  Traj  package  with  a  dropout  option.  They 
demonstrated  that  non-random  attrition,  in  which 
the  dropout  rate  is  uneven  across  the  latent  groups, 
has  a  consequential  impact  on  modelling  the  group 
size.  In  an  extreme  case,  a  group  might  completely 
diminish.  They  further  illustrated  that  the  dropout 
extension  was  successfully  able  to  optimize  the 
model  by  taking  account  of  different  dropout  rates. 
Thus, we adopted the dropout option in modelling to 
estimate  a  better  model  and  offer  informative  judge-
ment on the missing data.

2.6. Predictive factor analysis

After  the  joint  modelling,  each  case  was  categorized 
into  one  PTSS  group  and  one  depression  group 
according  to  the  course  of  their  symptoms  over  the 
nine  months.  Membership  profiles  were  labelled  as 
low,  medium  or  high.  A  multinomial  logistic  regres-
sion analysis was then deployed to calculate the rela-
tive  risk  ratio  of  falling  into  the  high  symptom 
trajectory  group  compared  to  the  low  symptom  tra-
jectory  group  according  to  predictor  variables  of  age 
and  gender,  measures  of  pre-trauma  emotional  well-
being (CPAS), peri-trauma panic (CPP), post-trauma 
anxiety  (SCAS),  appraisal  (CPTCI),  rumination, 
thought suppression and adaptive-processing and self- 
blaming.

Trauma  severity,  a  common  factor  that  may  influ-
ence the post-trauma response, was not included in the 
modelling.  The  previous  study  using  the  same  sample 
revealed that objective indices of trauma severity (num-
ber  of  injuries,  sustaining  a  fracture,  being  seen  in 

resuscitation, sustaining an injury with permanent loss 
of  function)  were  not  significantly  related  to  PTSS 
(Meiser-Stedman  et  al.,  2019).  That  study  suggested, 
however,  that  the  cognitive  processes  (peritraumatic 
panic,  post-traumatic  rumination,  negative  appraisals 
and  adaptive  processing)  played  an  important  role  in 
the  onset  and  maintenance  of  PTSS;  thus,  the  present 
study focused on examining the impact of the cognitive 
elements.  Regression  analysis  also  confirmed  that 
trauma  severity  was  not  associated  with  depression 
(SMFQ) scores; model outputs are listed in supplemen-
tary material Table S3.

3. Results

3.1. Descriptive  statistics

The data analysis included 217 participants, of whom 
124 were males and 93 were females. Participants were 
aged  between  8.01  and  17.97  years  (M  =  14.09, 
SD  =  2.96).  The  traumatic  events  that  participants 
had  been  exposed  to  were  RTA  (n  =  98),  accidental 
injury (n = 71), assault (n = 35), dog attacks (n = 11) 
and  other  acute  medical  emergencies  (n  =  2).  At  T2, 
there were 13 participants missing CPSS scores and 14 
cases  missing  SMFQ  scores.  At  T3,  58  cases  missed 
both CPSS and SMFQ scores.

3.2. Model selection

As illustrated in supplementary Table S1, for the PTSS 
(CPSS) trajectories, the BIC criterion favoured models 
comprising  four  groups;  for  depression  symptoms 
(SMFQ)  there  was  no  significant  difference  between 
the three and  four  group options  (i.e. the BIC  differ-
ence  was  less  than  10).  Figure  1  presents  the  two 
proposed  models:  three  groups  vs  four  groups  (see 
Figure  1a  for  CPSS  and  Figure  1b  for  SMFQ).  The 
two models (3-group model vs. 4-group model) were 
similar in some key regards – they both encompassed 
a  consistently  low  score  group  and  high  score  group 
with  broadly  equivalent  group  size  (29.3%  vs.  26.1% 
for  the  low  score  group  and  21.1%  vs.  17.1%  for  the 
high score group in PTSS; 19.6% vs. 17.6% for the high 
score group in depression).

The  main  difference  between  the  three-  and  four- 
group  models  concerned  the  medium  groups.  The 
three-groups  model  recommended  one  medium- 
severity group, whereas two separate groups were pro-
posed  by  the  four-group  models.  We  favoured  the 
more succinct three-group model for several reasons. 
First, in those two groups, the starting point at T1 of 
one group is higher than the other and almost reaches 
the cut-offs for each outcome (16 for CPSS and eight 
for SMFQ). Although subthreshold symptoms can be 
of a potential concern, treatment usually will only be 
considered  when  symptoms  last  more  than  1  month

(NICE,  2018).  Since  both  symptoms  dropped  further 
at T2, it will make no material difference between the 
two  middle  groups  in  terms  of  clinical  management. 
Second,  the  four-group  models  also  had  larger  con-
fidence intervals (CI: areas between the dashed lines). 
Third, the more parsimonious models would be ben-
eficial when it came to joint modelling because, when 
linking the outcomes of the two trajectories, the pro-
liferation of probability matrices could easily become 
unmanageable.  Specifically,  the  four  PTSS  and  four 
depression  groups  produce  16  combinations  while 
the  three-group  option  only  produces  nine.  Those 
seven  extra  combinations  are  the  hybrids  from  the 
medium  groups,  which can  be  expected  to  be  almost 
identical.

3.4. PTSS trajectory

The final joint model (Figure 2) yielded three distinct 
PTSS  trajectory  probability  groups  including  a  low 
symptom  group  (42.4%  of  the  sample  size)  with 

persistently  low  CPSS  scores,  a  group  (35.6%)  with 
marginally  significant  CPSS  score  at  week  2  which 
dropped  below  the  clinical  cut-off  at  2  months,  and 
a  high  symptom  group  (21.9%)  presenting  marked 
distress  at  2  weeks  and  2  months  At  9  months,  the 
scores of the three groups were all in the non- clinical 
range.

3.5. Depression  trajectory

Similarly,  the  joint  model  produced  three  depression 
trajectory groups (low, medium and high) comprising 
45.9%,  34.0%  and  20.1%  of  the  participants,  respec-
tively.  In  contrast  to  the  low  and  medium  groups, 
whose depression level remained persistently low, the 
SMFQ  score  of  the  high  depression  group  at  nine 
months  (M  =  7.96,  95%  CI  [7.32,  11.17])  was  still 
around the clinical cut-off.

3.6. Conditional group membership

In  probability  theory,  conditional  probability 
is 
a  measure  of  the  probability  of  an  event  occurring 
given  that  another  event  has  occurred.  If  we  knew 
a  case  was  categorized  as  high  PTSS,  the  probability 
of its belonging to the low, medium and high depres-
sion symptom trajectory groups would be 1.6%, 8.3% 
and 74.4%, respectively. Conversely, the probability of 
belonging to the low, medium and high PTSS groups 
conditional  on  membership  of  a  high  depression 
group would be 2.5%, 13.1% and 81.8%, respectively.

Figure  3  lists  the  conditional  probabilities  of  all  the 
possible  combinations.  In  addition,  the  model  also 
reported  the  joint  probability  of  belonging  to  the 
PTSS group and the depression group (Table 1c).

For the record, the actual dropout rates at T2 were: 
3.16%, 3.47% and 6.77% for PTSS groups, and 3.93%, 
2.87%  and  15.7%  for  depression  groups.  At  T3,  the 
rates were: 14.9%, 16.2%, 36.7% for PTSS groups, and 
11.3%, 10.9% and 67.8% for depression groups.

3.7. Dropout model

Dropout  model  explains  the  heterogeneity  in  the 
dropout  pattern  within  each  trajectory  group.  It  also 
describes  the  change  of  attrition  rate  across  the  time 
using  the  sample  size  at  T1  as  baseline.  A  flat  linear 
model was proposed suggesting an equal rate of attri-
tion at T2 and T3. Estimated dropout rates for the low, 
medium  and  high  PTSS  groups  were  14.1%,  15.5%, 
30.2%,  respectively.  Likewise,  estimation  for  the 
depression  groups  were  16.3%,  11.9%  and  65.1%, 
respectively.  The  models  indicated  that  the  higher 
symptoms  a  child  had,  either  in  PTSS  or  depression, 
more likely they would dropout.

3.8. Predictive  factors

Using  low  symptom  groups  as  the  referent,  gender, 
age,  pre-trauma  emotional  wellbeing,  peri-event 
panic,  post-trauma  anxiety,  trauma-related  appraisal, 
rumination, thought suppression, adaptive processing 
and  self-blaming  were  entered  as  independent  vari-
ables  into  two  multinomial  logistic  regressions  (see 
STATA  scripts  in  supplementary  material  Appendix 
D) to predict the PTSS and depression trajectory out-
come,  in  particular  for  high  symptom  groups.  The 
relative risk ratio in the model estimates that for one 
unit  increase  in  each  of  the  predictive  factors  the

given  that  the  other  variables  in  the  model  are  held 
constant.

The  statistically  significant  predictors  (p  <  .05), 
ordered  from  strongest  to  weakest,  for  the  high  PTSS 
trajectory group were: peri-event panic (RR = 2.09, 95% 
CI [1.38, 3.19]), rumination (RR = 1.60, 95% CI [1.07, 
2.39]),  thought  suppression (RR = 1.27,  95% CI [1.04, 
1.56]) and negative appraisals (RR = 1.26, 95% CI [1.12, 
1.42]).  The  statistically  significant  predictors  for  the 
high  depression  trajectory  group  (also  from  strongest 
to  weakest)  were:  negative  appraisals  (RR  =  1.31,  95% 
CI  [1.15,  1.48]),  pre-trauma  emotional  wellbeing 
(RR = 1.24, 95%CI [1.03, 1.49]), and post-trauma anxi-
ety (RR = 1.20, 95% CI [1.09, 1.34]). Gender and age did 
not predict PTSS or depression (Table 2).

4. Discussion

The  study  investigated  the  natural  recovery  trajec-
tories  of  PTSS  and  depression  symptoms  for  the 
9  months  period  following  a  single  event  trauma. 
Overall,  our  model  suggested  that  PTSS  reduced  to 
non-clinical level for all participants by 9-months. The 
PTSS trajectories finding was consonant with the pro-
totypical  trauma  response  pattern  proposed  in  2004 
(Bonanno,  2004),  although  no  delayed  onset  cluster 
was detected in our sample. The majority (80%) were 
observed to be consistently displaying low symptoms 
or able to recover within two months. About one-fifth 

of  participants  experienced  high  levels  of  PTSS  but 
managed to reach the recovery range within 9 months. 
Unlike  the  other  non-interpersonal  one-time  trauma 
studies  in  youth  (Hong  et  al.,  2014;  La  Greca  et  al., 
2013;  Punamäki  et  al.,  2015),  there  was  no  chronic/ 
increase group.

Another  possible  reason  for  the  absent  chronic 
group could be that participants with elevated PTSS 
were referred to intervention and were excluded from 
the study. It is difficult to be certain how different the 
PTSS  trajectory  groups  would  be  if  the  data  of  chil-
dren who received treatment had been included into 
the  modelling.  Since  their  PTSD  symptoms  were 
expected to drop  at T2 and T3 after  treatment, they 
would  likely  be  merged  into  the  high  symptom  tra-
jectory  group.  Meanwhile,  we  also  postulate  that  in 
the  less  ethical  counterfactual  situation  where  no 
intervention  is  offered,  the  10  cases  would  form 
a  fourth  group  with  a  PTSS  level  higher  than  the 
current  high  symptom  group  at  T1  and  possibly 
with  symptoms  continuing  to  deteriorate  over  T2 
and T3. This hypothesis is based on the shared char-
acteristics of the chronic/increase group reported by 
two  similar  injury  studies  (Hong  et  al.,  2014; 
Punamäki  et  al.,  2015).  The  shared  characteristics 
were:  that  the  group  made  up  a  very  small  portion 
(1.8% and 12%); that the initial symptom level at the 
acute  phase  was  the  highest  among  all  groups;  and 
that there was no natural recovery even after periods 
as  long  as  30  (Hong  et  al.,  2014)  and  11  months 
(Punamäki  et  al.,  2015).  Alternatively,  these  cases

may have increased the predicted depression score of 
the high symptom group at the T3 assessment.

The depression trajectories were quite different. The 
three trajectories all described a steady decline but the 
divergence  between  the  high  depression  group  (20%) 
and the rest was such that the high depression trajectory 
group were more likely to have persistently high depres-
sion symptoms for nine months, during which time the 
other  two  groups  demonstrated  only  mild  symptoms. 
Such a dichotomous pattern has not been apparent in 
previous trajectory studies in paediatric populations.

In respect of the relationship between the PTSS and 
depression  trajectories,  the  conditional  membership 
analysis reported high synchronicity: low PTSS parti-
cipants  were  highly  likely  to  be  classified  in  the  low 
depression group, while a participant who experienced 
high  PTSS  was  anticipated  to  be  in  the  highly 
depressed group. Similarly, being in the high depres-
sion  group  predicted  being  in  the  more  severe  PTSS 
group. The finding is consistent with previous studies 
in  injured  adults  (deRoon-Cassini  et  al.,  2010)  and 
children  (Hong  et  al.,  2014).  Given  that  PTSD- 
depression comorbidity is well established, this finding 
is  not  surprising.  However,  trajectory  is  a  temporal 
concept  and  it  addresses  the  dynamic  of  symptom 

change.  The  synchrony  between  the  two  trajectories 
following the same stressor has more profound impli-
cations  than  a  simple  indication  of  symptoms  over-
lapping  at  some  time  point.  It  is  reasonable  to 
hypothesize  that  if  PTSS  and  depression  evolve  in 
similar  patterns,  there  should  be  either  a  common 
mechanism  underlying  their  development,  or  there 
is/are  shared  factor(s)  driving  the  mechanisms  that 
determine the symptoms.

The  high  PTSS  and  depression  trajectory  groups 
shared  few  predictive  factors.  Rumination  in  general 
is considered a transdiagnostic feature associated with 
depression  and  PTSD,  and  it  was  strongly  related  to 
PTSS in this study although it did not predict depres-
sion  in  our  model.  This  phenomenon  suggests  that 
a  certain  subtype(s)  of  rumination  may  maintain 
PTSD  but  not  depression.  Birrer  and  Michael  (2011) 
conducted  a  study  examining  the  characteristics  of 
rumination  such  as  duration  and  content  in  PTSD 
and depression; they found that rumination served as 
a  powerful  internal  trigger  for  intrusive  memories  in 
PTSD, but not in depression. Constructions of various 
types  of  rumination  (e.g.  depressive  rumination, 
stress-reactive  rumination)  have  been  suggested  and 
their clinical impact needs further investigation.

In line with the literature, peri-trauma panic (per-
ceived  threat),  thought  suppression  and  negative 
appraisal  were  linked  with  high  PTSS,  while  only 
negative  appraisal  was  a  factor  that  was  associated 
with  both  high  symptom  groups.  This  finding  con-
firms that negative appraisal plays a role in maintain-
ing  broader  post-trauma  psychopathology  (Hiller 
et al., 2019). Hamilton et al. (2012) integrated findings 
from a large body of neuroimaging research and pro-
posed  that  depression  is  sustained  by  the  increased 
salience  of  negative  information  leading  to  biased 
appraisal.  Combined  with  the  heightened  sense  of 
threat  (e.g.  intrusive  memory,  hypervigilance)  in 
PTSD, which serves as an ongoing source of negative 
information, appraisal may be central to understand-
ing  PTSD-depression  comorbidity.  The  negative 
appraisals  that  are  proposed  to  play  a  major  role  in 
the maintenance of PTSD (Ehlers & Clark, 2000) also 
help to maintain depression.

In  summarizing  the  PTSS-depression  relationship 
observed  in  the  study,  we  concluded  that  PTSS  and 
depression are two distinct, but overlapping, responses 
to  a  traumatic  stressor,  and  that  they  are  maintained 
by different processes. This conclusion is based on 1) 
the high synchronicity in their trajectories, and 2) few 
mutual  predictors.  Negative  appraisals  appeared  to 
play  a  critical  role  bridging  their  mechanisms. 
Anxiety manifested as the second strongest predictor 
of depression trajectories. This may be a byproduct of 
the overlapping presentations of physiological arousal 
and avoidance in both anxiety disorders and PTSD.

Lastly,  our  study  is  the  first  to  examine  trajectory 
and attrition rate in the field and found that the more 
severe  symptoms  a  participant  has,  the  more  likely 
they  will  drop  out  from  the  study.  We  hypothesize 
that this may hold universally in longitudinal research 
and  clinical  trials,  and  the  consequences  can  be  ser-
ious.  The  immediate  consequence  is  that,  without 
correction,  the  averages  of  the  examined  measures 
will  be  lower  than  their  real  means,  and  other  prime 
parameters of the sampled distribution, such as stan-
dard deviation, will be altered. This may make inferred 
statistical  interpretation  less  accurate.  Therefore,  this 
conclusion supports handling missing data with great 
caution and, if possible, applying appropriate statisti-
cal methods (e.g. dropout modelling or imputation) to 
minimize the impact.

4.1. Clinical implication

In  the  case  of  acute  post-traumatic  psychopathology, 
depression  may  be  a  more  lasting  condition  than 
PTSD  symptoms.  In  our  sample,  PTSS  tended  to 
diminish  over  time,  whereas  depression  often  per-
sisted. This supports the routine screening of trauma- 
exposed  children  and  adolescents  for  depression. 
Similarly,  depression  should  be  included  in  any

consideration of core post-traumatic symptoms when 
making clinical decisions such as active monitoring or 
offering an intervention.

There  was  a  clear  correlation  between  high  PTSS 
and  high  depression  symptoms.  Although  this  study 
was limited to the non-clinic-referred group (i.e. par-
ticipants receiving multiple-session interventions were 
excluded),  this  relationship  is  likely  to  hold  in  the 
clinical population given the findings from other stu-
dies.  This  means  that  patients  seeking  treatment  for 
PTSD are prone to high levels of depression. Effective 
intervention  should  incorporate  components  addres-
sing both PTSD and depression.

Most  importantly,  negative  appraisal  was  the  only 
predictor for both high PTSS as well as high depression 
symptom  trajectories;  this  suggests  a  possible  effective 
treatment  approach,  addressing  PTSS  and  depression 
holistically by focusing on negative appraisal.

4.2. Limitations

The study had several discernible limitations. First of all, 
the data were limited to children and adolescents, mainly 
following  a  one-off,  mostly  non-interpersonal  trauma. 
Thus, the interpretation of the results may not apply to 
interpersonal  or  multiple  traumas.  Second,  for  ethical 
reasons,  the  dataset  was  only  able  to  track  the  natural 
course  of  participants  with  relatively  mild  symptoms. 
Ten  cases  with  high  PTSS  measurement  scores  were 
referred  for  treatment  and  were  therefore  excluded 
from  the  study.  The  trajectories  that  emerged  in  this 
study  may,  therefore,  not  represent  the  clinical  popula-
tion. Third, the drop out model predicted equal dropout 
rates  at  T2  and  T3,  which  did  not  fit  the  actual  data 
perfectly (the missing rate at T2 was much lower (13/14 
cases) than at T3 (58 cases). Consequently, the estimated 
means at T2 could be higher than their true values as the 
joint  modelling  compensates  for  the  missing  data  by 
applying the high score, high dropout formulation.

5. Conclusion

Within  children  and  adolescents  exposed  to  single 
event  trauma  resulting  in  minor  physical  injury,  the 
majority  were  able  to  recover  without  intervention 
over  the  following  months,  although  about  one-fifth 
presented  with  symptoms  of  lasting  depression  at 
9-month  follow-up.  PTSS  trajectory  groups  are  in 
high  accordance  with  depression  trajectory  groups. 
By  examining  predictors  of  high  symptom  groups, 
negative appraisals appeared to be a shared risk factor 
to PTSS and depression.
