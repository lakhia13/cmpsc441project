Abstract
There has been a renewed interest in the use of various psychedelic agents as potential
therapies for multiple
psychiatric conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anx-
iety disorder (GAD), to name a few. This follows the recent accumulation of evidence for ketamine pharmacotherapy and
a rapid proliferation of clinics/programs offering a variety of ketamine based treatments. A quick glance at the existing evi-
dence, however, reveals a confusing scenario for patients, healthcare providers, and regulators. Overall, there are no standard
deﬁnitions of what constitutes a psychotherapeutic intervention within a psychedelic-based or a ketamine-based treatment.
More speciﬁcally, studies have not always distinguished between using a well-known, manualized psychotherapy, providing psy-
choeducation and psychological support, or providing a therapy speciﬁcally to integrate the drug experience in psychedelic
trials. Also, it is difﬁcult to determine the role of the psychedelic agent as a stand-alone treatment, and the relative importance
(if any) of the psychedelic experience for the desired therapeutic effect. In this perspective, we discuss the evolving landscape
of psychedelic-based and ketamine-based treatments, highlighting different therapeutic models, their methodologies, and the
need for clearer deﬁnitions and rigorous clinical trials. The document proposes three new deﬁnitions to improve clarity in
evaluating the effects of these agents and the role of psychotherapies. We suggest language that will distinguish: (1) when
the drug is used for its pharmacologic effects as a stand-alone treatment, without requiring the psychedelic experience or
combined psychotherapy; (2) when the treatment requires the acute psychological effects of the drug to assist psychotherapy
and (3) When ketamine or a psychedelic agent is used in combination with a structured, manualized psychotherapy that could
be implemented even in the absence of these agents. We hope that this new terminology and deﬁnitions will help distinguish
the various therapeutic roles of these agents (as stand-alone treatments or in combination with psychotherapies), and facil-
itate study designs, regulatory pathways, and more informed patient care.

Ketamine, Psychedelics, and Psychotherapy: Understanding treatment models to better inform practice

Plain Language Summary
The use of psychedelics to improve symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD),
and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD has gained signiﬁcant attention lately, following the rapid proliferation of clinics/pro-
grams offering ketamine-based therapies.
However, it can be confusing for patients, healthcare workers, and regulators to understand what all these treatments actually involve.
There are no standard deﬁnitions of what a psychotherapeutic intervention involving psychedelics or ketamine truly means.
More speciﬁcally, studies often haven’t clearly separated the use of well-established, manualized psychotherapies from simply offering
psychological support or psychoeducation during psychedelic trials. It can also be challenging to understand the role of the psychedelic

itself as a standalone treatment, as well as how much the psychedelic experience contributes to the positive therapeutic outcomes, if at
all.
Here, we explore the changing world of psychedelic- and ketamine-based treatments, highlighting various therapeutic approaches,
their methods, and the importance of clearer deﬁnitions and thorough clinical trials. The document introduces three new deﬁnitions
to help clarify how these agents are evaluated and their relationship with psychotherapies. We suggest language that clearly distin-
guishes: 1) when the drug is used for its pharmacologic effects alone, without needing the psychedelic experience or combined therapy;
2) when the drug’s immediate psychological effects are used to support therapy; and 3) when ketamine or another psychedelic is used
alongside a structured, manualized psychotherapy that can be offered even without these agents.
We hope that this new terminology and deﬁnitions will help distinguish the various therapeutic roles of these agents (as stand-alone
treatments or in combination with psychotherapies), and facilitate study designs, regulatory pathways, and more informed patient care.

Psychedelic Assisted Psychotherapy (PAP) has captured interest
not only in psychiatry, but also among the public and layperson
media. Much hype surrounded the application for 3, 4
Methylenedoixymethamphetamine (MDMA) to the United
States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) as a treatment
for post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD). MDMA was
studied in protocols using MDMA-assisted psychotherapy
(MDMA-AP), where the intervention was a psychotherapy
focused on integrating the psychedelic experience to facilitate
processing of previous trauma. The potential for a mystical
and transformative experience to alleviate suffering brought
widespread appeal, given that traditional treatments take time
and are not always effective. The positive outcomes of the
MDMA trials1 prompted interest in MDMA-AP for PTSD
and PAP with other psychedelic drugs, for other mental health
conditions.

The USFDA ultimately rejected MDMA-AP due to
various methodologic concerns with the studies, including
concern that study design made it impossible to determine
the effects of the drug itself and to distinguish it from the
potential role of the psychedelic ‘trip’, or the role of the psy-
chotherapy. A recent Editorial2 addressed this concern on a
broader level, pointing out that when using psychedelics
for mental health conditions, the potential pharmacologic
beneﬁts or harms of the drugs themselves are still unclear,
and their use is not without potential risks. The psychedelic
experience has not been established as necessary for the ther-
apeutic beneﬁts, and the potential psychological harms asso-
ciated with this process have also not been fully evaluated.
The authors2 called for improved rigour in clinical trials, sug-
gesting randomized groups undergoing psychotherapy alone,
psychedelic drug alone, and the combination of psychother-
apy and psychedelic drugs.

While an improved study design could support establishing
the role of the drug itself, the pathway to determine the role of
psychotherapy is less clear.2 Psychotherapy is a broad term,
with many interpretations and potential approaches. The combi-
nation of psychoeducation, support, and/or manualized thera-
pies with various traditional pharmacotherapies has been
demonstrated as superior to the use of pharmacotherapy alone

if

pharmacotherapy includes a psychedelic agent, there exists a
widespread assumption that psychotherapy would not be an
established manualized therapy, but a new process that centres
therapy around the ‘trip’ itself. This ‘psychedelic therapy
model’ is based mainly on the early work of a psychedelic
pioneer, Stanislav Grof, who worked on the premise that a psy-
chedelic (high) dose of the drug would induce a transformational
experience, thought to facilitate an opening of the unconscious
to otherwise inaccessible psychological material.3 This model
of therapy is typically structured with three components: prepa-
ration for the psychedelic experience, medication administration
(dosing session) and integration.4 Therapy may or may not take
place while the patient is under the acute effects of the drug.
Integration sessions are held after the dosing sessions to
process the psychedelic experience, and this may occur on the
same day or on a different day. Another model uses lower ‘psy-
cholytic doses’, which are thought
to relax psychological
defences to enhance the therapy process,5 without leading to a
full psychedelic experience. In this case, therapy is conducted
after the drug is ingested.

could enhance outcomes of other structured psychotherapies.
For example, in the Yale model of PAP using psilocybin for
depression, the therapy follows an acceptance and commitment
therapy (ACT) model, rather than an integration of the psyche-
delic experience itself.7 Similarly, in a systematic review of psi-
locybin for substance use disorders (SUD), most studies with a
psychotherapy intervention included established therapies such
as motivational enhancement (ME) or cognitive behavioural
therapy (CBT).8 These studies applied manualized therapies –
already known to improve outcomes when combined with
other appropriate pharmacotherapies.

In effect, three very different treatment models could be
delineated to accurately evaluate and describe the effects of
psychedelics, the psychedelic experience, and the role of psy-
chotherapy. A reframing of psychedelic models could con-
sider

where the drug is used for its pharmacologic or neuroplastic
effects as a stand-alone treatment. In this case, the non-

Distinguishing among treatment models becomes even
more important when considering ketamine-based treat-
ments, which, unlike psychedelics, have more established
evidence for their use as stand-alone agents, are more
widely available, and are increasingly used to support psy-
chotherapy through PAP and PCP models. Though not a
classic psychedelic agent, ketamine is used as an antidepres-
sant and may cause a dissociative experience, which is con-
sidered a treatment-emergent adverse event when ketamine is
used as pharmacotherapy. This dissociative experience is
often characterized by dizziness, sensory sensitivity, misper-
ceptions or illusions, derealization and depersonalization.
This premise is central to one model of Ketamine Assisted
Psychotherapy (KAP), where the dissociation and a separa-
tion of mind from body are considered therapeutic, support-
ing an ‘openness’ to new ways of thinking, while also
allowing a ‘time out’ from the usual mind and from negativ-
ity.9 It is a desired and necessary part of the psychotherapy.
this form
Consistent with the model adopted for PAP,
of KAP typically involves a preparatory session, the admin-
istration of medication (which may or may not
include
therapy during dissociation), and one or more integration ses-
sions afterwards to process the experience. Clinics offering
this form of treatment often promote (with varying degrees
of evidence) ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects and its
potential beneﬁt for PTSD and multiple other psychiatric
conditions, such as SUD, eating disorders, anxiety disorders,
and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). As with psyche-
delics, it is important to assess the therapeutic roles of both
the drug and the psychotherapy. For some indications, data
clearly support the beneﬁt of ketamine in the absence of psy-
chotherapy. Both the Canadian Network for Mood and
Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) 2023 Depression treatment
guidelines10 and CANMAT 2018 Bipolar treatment guide-
lines11 recognize the evidence for ketamine pharmacotherapy
for depression and bipolar depression.

treatment

This existing pharmacotherapy data provides a ground-
work for inquiry into the role of therapy and demonstrates
that not all patients need therapy to respond to ketamine.

However, beneﬁts from an acute course of KP are not typi-
cally sustained beyond a few weeks, and strategies such as
maintenance ketamine14–16 or combining the ketamine with
psychotherapy17 may extend the ketamine response. While
both models require further research to determine the most
the evaluation of psychotherapy
effective approaches,
methods has been hindered by unclear deﬁnitions and
terms for the so-called Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy.
This term has also been referred to as Ketamine-Assisted
Therapy or simply ‘ketamine therapy’, which may also some-
times be used in reference to intravenous ketamine adminis-
tered as a pharmacotherapy, confusing the ketamine
landscape even further.

Like with PAP/PCP, it is imperative to reframe treatment
terms. The redeﬁned
models and to develop consistent
models proposed earlier in this perspective may also be
applied to ketamine renaming models as: (1) Ketamine
Pharmacotherapy (KP) where ketamine is administered at
any dose via any route for its direct pharmacologic effect;
(2) Ketamine Combined with Psychotherapy (KCP) which
combines ketamine with a structured, manualized form of
psychotherapy; and (3) Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy
(KAP), which requires ketamine’s acute psychological
effects as a focus of therapy to assist the psychotherapy.

The adoption of these terms will facilitate a more accurate
evaluation of existing literature and future studies. Current liter-
ature has a broad deﬁnition, including any use of psychothera-
pies with ketamine. Failure to distinguish between approaches
risks inaccurate claims for the safety and efﬁcacy of various
interventions. For example, a 2022 systematic review17 of
‘KAP’ for psychiatric indications included three studies on
patients with depression, all of which suggested positive
results. Consequently, patients and clinicians may conclude
that the dissociative experience and its integration could be ben-
eﬁcial for treating depression. However, only one of the three
studies adopted this approach, and it was a case report involv-
ing only two patients with comorbid major depressive disorder
and an eating disorder. The more robust data came from the two
other studies, which, by our deﬁnitions, would not be catego-
rized as KAP but rather as KCP. An open-label trial and a ran-
domized controlled trial
included a course of CBT in
conjunction with IV ketamine. Those who received CBT expe-
rienced a longer duration of response compared to those
without CBT – in this case, the psychotherapy appeared to
enhance the response to pharmacotherapy.

Considering that both ketamine and CBT separately have
strong efﬁcacy data for depression, a positive outcome with
the combined intervention is unsurprising. Moreover, it is
known that for treatment-resistant or moderate to severe
depression, combining pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy
can lead to better outcomes.10 CBT is a proven therapy that
could be done alone or with any medication – in this case,
it just happens to be ketamine.

Further examples reinforce the need to distinguish
between the KAP and KCP approaches. In a systematic

Ketamine treatment models

Ketamine Pharmacotherapy (KP)
• Any dose

Administration of ketamine via any route, for the purpose of its pharmacologic

effects. Any dissociative experience is considered a treatment emergent adverse
event and not necessary for efﬁcacy.

As required, support is given during the experience to avoid or minimize patient

distress.

Ketamine Combined with Psychotherapy (KCP)
• Dissociative doses (higher doses likely to cause

acute dissociative side effects) or

• Microdoses (lower doses not expected to typically

cause dissociative effects)

Ketamine Pharmacotherapy, with a psychotherapy as usual in parallel. The therapy
could be done with or without any medication and is not speciﬁc to any qualities
of ketamine. Neuroplastic effects of the drug are thought to enhance the effects
of therapy.

Therapy is done before or after ketamine dosing, on same day or, more frequently,

on different days.

review13 of ketamine for SUD, several studies included psy-
chotherapies and were therefore categorized as KAP. But, on
closer look, most psychotherapies included in the studies
actually used a KCP approach with existing manualized ther-
apies – that is, motivational enhancement therapy (MET) for
alcohol use disorder,13 mindfulness-based relapse prevention
(MBRP) for cocaine use disorder,13 and both MET and
MBRP for cannabis use disorder.13 Considering our rede-
ﬁned terms, evidence to support a KAP approach would be
limited to two studies with in patients with opiate use
disorder.13 Similarly, in a recent systematic review of novel
PTSD treatments, reports of combining ketamine with psy-
chotherapy also generally used a manualized therapy such
as exposure therapy or cognitive processing,18 once again

consistent with a KCP model. So, is the dissociative experi-
ence and its integration necessary? Current terminology fails
to provide a clearly deﬁne this question and may cause con-
fusion for both patients and healthcare providers.

Other challenges arise in the consideration of interven-
tions or procedures described as ‘psychological support’, a
phrase commonly encountered in the psychedelic literature.
While this is an intervention, we suggest that this not be con-
sidered a form of psychotherapy, but a necessary procedure
when administering a drug that is likely to elicit a dissociative
or psychedelic effect. The KP/PP models should include psy-
choeducation about potential drug effects, an essential step
for informed consent, both in research and clinical care.
Additionally, if a patient or research participant becomes

La Revue Canadienne de Psychiatrie

distressed, reassurance and support must be provided. It is
essential, moving forward, to clarify whether ‘support’ is
limited to pre-education and safety assistance during the
dosing sessions or includes engagement in follow-up ses-
sions to discuss the experience. If the latter, this resembles
an integration session more aligned with a KAP/PAP model.
Terminology also becomes important from a regulatory
standpoint. As the practice of KAP and interest in PAP
have gained popularity, regulations surrounding these prac-
tices are evolving. In order to protect patients receiving psy-
chotherapy while in a vulnerable mental state, regulatory
bodies are starting to require facilities offering PAP to
undergo accreditation processes and meet their standards.
For example, under the Alberta Mental Health Services
Protection Act (AMHSPA),19 ketamine is listed as a psyche-
delic agent along with psilocybin, psilocin, MDMA, LSD,
mescaline (peyote), DMT, and 5-methoxy-DMT. As such,
KAP practices would fall under the umbrella of PAP. The
Act broadly deﬁnes PAP as ‘services to treat a psychiatric
disorder with psychotherapy and one or more designated psy-
chedelic drugs, whether or not the administration of the drug
and the psychotherapy are provided on the same day or on
different days’.

Without properly deﬁned terms, such regulations may
have unintended consequences and restrict access to care.
The Alberta legislation exempts ketamine when prescribed
as a pharmacotherapy – that is, our deﬁnition of KP. The leg-
islation aims to ensure that KAP/PAP is delivered with ade-
quate consideration for the physical and psychological safety
of patients. But, by current deﬁnitions, a patient doing CBT
the category of KAP.
alongside KP would fall under
Placing similar accreditation requirements for the use of
established manualized therapies in patients who are treated
with KP is unnecessary and may limit access. Using our
terms, this is a KCP model which does not carry the same
psychological vulnerability that may be associated with
KAP. Regulation and protection of patients are paramount
as this ﬁeld evolves rapidly. Still, we must employ the appro-
priate language to accurately distinguish what needs to be
regulated before addressing how it should be regulated.

The use of these new terms will also enhance the clarity of
clinical trial design, facilitate the evaluation of the literature,
and aid in educating patients. While KAP and KCP, as we
have deﬁned them,
this language will
remain broad,
support better evaluation and understanding of the role of
the dissociative or psychedelic experience in the treatment
of various indications. It should be noted that both KAP
and KCP practices may involve single versus multiple
doses of ketamine, variable dosing strengths or modes of
administration, and a variable number of therapy sessions,
which may be done individually or in a group. Further, the
timing of therapy sessions and medication administration is
heterogeneous. Both the ketamine itself and the therapy
may be considered in the acute treatment phase, or as main-
tenance treatments.

While this perspective was not a comprehensive evalua-
tion of the evidence, it clearly demonstrates that language
recently in use may, at times, be misleading to both patients
and healthcare providers. In particular, there is a risk of over-
stating the evidence base for KAP/PAP, which remains
largely experimental, and is currently recommended only
for individuals who have not responded to more evidence-
based treatments.20 Accurate reporting of not only risks but
also evidence-based information is necessary for clinicians
to obtain and for patients to provide informed consent for
treatment.

the heterogeneous nature of ketamine

As the ﬁeld moves forward, we encourage researchers, cli-
nicians, and regulatory bodies to adopt this terminology. This
will support more transparent reporting and trial design, pro-
viding a language for regulatory bodies to consider when
addressing patient safety. While these proposed models intro-
duce a novel and essential framework for categorizing inter-
and
ventions,
psychedelic practices also requires additional details con-
cerning both the drug and the therapy used. Future reporting
should include the classiﬁcation of treatment model, the dose
(range) and route of administration of drug used, and whether
it is expected to elicit psychedelic or psycholytic effects.
Once categorized as KAP or KCP, model used should be
more clearly desscribed used with consideration for timing,
number of sessions, and model.

As clinicians and researchers continue to pursue answers
to so many unanswered questions in this ﬁeld,21 we hope
the proposed framework and terminology will guide critical
thinking and review of the existing literature while informing
better design and implementation of future studies.

Table 1 provides a summary of our suggested reframing,

redeﬁning, and renaming of these treatment models.
