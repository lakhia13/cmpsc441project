Abstract
Objective: The article aims to assess the role of stress and anxiety in relation to the 
level of emotional control among cancer patients. Currently cancer ranks second, 

after cardiovascular disease, as the most common cause of death. Moreover, it is 

predicted that in the coming years, cancer will become the leading cause of death 

worldwide. This is due to the extended lifespan of the population and also to the 

presence of carcinogenic factors in the surrounding environment. The emergence 

of cancer is a significant stressor that affects individuals in diverse ways, leading 

to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional consequences. In line with the adopted 

aim, emotional issues are the chosen area of exploration in this article.
Methods: The study included 102 patients. The differences between the patients' 
results  according  to  various  scales  and  the  results  produced  by  the  validation 
group data were examined using one- sample t- tests. The relationships between 
the  quantitative  variables  were  determined  using  Spearman's  rho  coefficients, 

and  the  relationships  between  the  quantitative  and  qualitative  variables  were 

verified using Kruskal- Wallis tests.
Results: The participants exhibited higher anxiety suppression levels than individ-
uals in the normalization group. They sought emotional support more frequently 
than the average person in the population, turned to religion, engaged in other such 

activities, lived in denial more often, discontinued activities, and displayed a sense 

of humor less frequently. The more frequently they controlled their anger, the less 

they sought emotional and instrumental support, catharsis, and attempted to accept 

the situation and cease being active. Additionally, controlling anxiety, sadness, and 

depression coexisted with self- blame, denial, and compensatory actions.
Conclusions:  Cancer  patients  face  intense  anxiety.  Emotional  and  instru-
mental  support,  along  with  the  ability  to  express  and  manage  emotions,  are 

crucial for these patients, especially within the context of facing the challenge 
of cancer. Finding constructive ways to express strong and difficult emotions 

prevents their accumulation and reduces the need for emotional suppression.

|  INTRODU CT ION

Cancer  diseases  are  a  significant  and  multidimensional 
issue  worldwide.1–3  Moreover,  there  is  an  upward  trend 
in the incidence of such diseases. In Poland, cancer is the 
second  leading  cause  of  death  after  cardiovascular  dis-
ease4  and  may  become  the  leading  one.5  The  increasing 
occurrence  of  this  phenomenon  makes  it  worthwhile  to 
examine cancer not only from a medical perspective but 
also from a psychological one. It is normal for patients to 
experience intense emotional reactions in response to the 
challenging new situations which serious illness present 
(cf.6), hence, due to the prevalence of a multitude of un-
pleasant feelings associated with cancer, terms like “can-
cer distress,” and “cancer- related stress”7 have been used 
for years to describe the nature of the adverse experiences 
in patients. Certain aspects of emotion regulation are in-
dicated as the key to coping with emotional burdens, and 
particularly with emotion control as individuals attempt to 
manage the generation, experience, or expression of emo-
tions  and/or  their  emotional  reactions.8,9  Research  has 
confirmed the importance of this psychological feature in 
cancer  patients10  because  the  ways  in  which  individuals 
are  able  to  achieve  emotional  control  have  implications 
for their health and general well- being.11,12

Previous studies suggest that a high level of resilience 
and a low degree of emotional control appear to be protec-
tive  attributes,  while  a  high  degree  of  emotional  control 
has  been  identified  as  a  risk  factor  for  mental  health.13 
Moreover, current research demonstrates the existence of 
significant relationships between anxiety, depression, and 
patient  age  (such  issues  occur  more  frequently  in  older 
individuals)  among  cancer  patients.  Significant  associa-
tions  have  also  been  found  between  anxiety,  depression, 
the  type  of  cancer,  and  the  type  of  treatment.14  Nearly 
half of women with early- stage breast cancer experienced 
depression, anxiety, or both within a year after diagnosis, 
and the lack of intimate and confiding support was also 
a predictive factor for longer episodes of depression and 
anxiety.15,16

The direction and intensity of emotional processes are 
influenced by individual predispositions. Emotional states 
are highly complex phenomena, they involve physiologi-
cal processes, brain events (triggering cognitive- evaluative 

functions), feelings (subjective experiential components), 
and behavioral phenomena (cf.17). Emotions can also play 
a  significant  motivating  role  in  our  actions.18  According 
to the interactive concept of stress,19 it is the relationship 
between an individual and their environment, which the 
individual  interprets  as  burdensome,  surpassing  their 
resources,  and  threatening  their  well- being.  Therefore 
stressful situations have specific characteristics related to 
human functioning in the environment and concern var-
ious  responses  to  stimuli.19,20  Disease  is  a  potent  source 
of stress that can influence an individual's behavior, and 
experiencing stress can be a risk factor in falling ill.21

Cancer  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  most  stressful 
categories of disease,22 and the emergence of cancer is a 
potent  stressor  that  affects  individuals  in  diverse  ways, 
leading  to  cognitive,  behavioral,  and  emotional  conse-
quences (cf.23). Stress, as well as future- oriented anxiety, 
are related to the functioning of the immune, hormonal, 
and  nervous  systems.  The  disease  may  become  a  cause 
of  unfavorable  changes  across  all  aspects  of  human  life, 
significantly disrupting the daily lives of the patient and 
their  loved  ones,  and  resulting  in  significant  distress.24 
Additionally, it is known that cancer patients who experi-
ence anxiety and depression differ in the perceived inten-
sity of their symptoms (cf.25) Variables potentially linked 
to the level of anxiety reveal a complex picture of mutual 
relationships.  Various  socio- demographic  variables  are 
associated with anxiety and depression: gender—women 
undergoing  cancer  treatment  reported  higher  levels  of 
anxiety and depression; age—older individuals at the start 
of  their  cancer  treatment  are  more  prone  to  depression 
than  anxiety;  social  support—providing  support  to  pros-
tate cancer patients in the first month after diagnosis leads 
to a reduction in the intensity of their emotional difficul-
ties.26,27 These findings indicate the need for screening the 
intensity of stress and related anxiety in patients in order 
to adequately support them and enhance their quality of 
life.28

Taking  into  account  the  research  conducted  to  date, 
the aim of this research was to assess the intensity of the 
stress,  anxiety  and  the  resulting  stress- coping  strategies, 
as well as assessing the role of emotional control concern-
ing  the  perception  of  anxiety  and  stress  among  cancer 
patients.

|  MATERIALS A ND M ET HODS

The study included patients diagnosed with cancer, who 
were receiving treatment at the Clinic of Pneumonology, 
Oncology,  and  Allergology,  as  well  as  the  Oncology  and 
Chemotherapy  Department  at  the  Independent  Public 
Clinical Hospital No. 4 in Lublin. The research was con-
ducted from March 2021 to May 2021. A total of 102 pa-
tients who were provided with research tools participated 
in the study. The patients participating in the study gave 
their written consent for its execution and were informed 
about its purpose and their anonymity.

2.1 

|  Instruments

The following research tools were used in this research:

1.  A  self- constructed  questionnaire—consisting  of  16 
questions  concerning  demographic  and  medical 
variables;

2.  The  Emotional  Control  Scale  (CECS)  by  Maggie 
Watson  and  Seven  Greer  (Polish  adaptation:  Zygfryd 
Juczyński).29  CECS  comprises  21  statements  (three 
subscales consisting of seven questions each) that allow 
one to obtain a general score related to emotional con-
trol, as well as three subscales related to anger control, 
depression control, and anxiety control. The reliability 
of the scale for the Polish adaptation was assessed by es-
timating its internal consistency and absolute stability. 
The  Cronbach's  alpha  coefficient  for  internal  consist-
ency was 0.87 for the overall emotional control index 
(0.80 for anger control, 0.77 for depression control, 0.78 
for  anxiety  control).  The  stability  coefficients  of  the 
subscales ranged from 0.36 to 0.49 and were lower than 
those of the original version.

3.  The  Mini- COPE  Stress  Coping  Inventory  by  C.  S. 
Carver  (Polish  adaptation:  Z.  Juczyński,  N.  Ogińska- 
Bulik).30  The  inventory  is  used  to  study  adults  (both 
healthy  and  ill  individuals)  and  comprises  28  state-
ments  constituting  14  strategies  (two  statements  for 
each  strategy).  The  method  is  often  used  to  measure 
dispositional  coping,  that  is,  assessing  typical  ways  of 
reacting to and experiencing particularly stressful situ-
ations.  The  internal  consistency  of  the  Polish  version 
of Mini- COPE was established based on a study of 200 
individuals  aged  25–60 years.  The  split- half  reliability 
was 0.86. Diagnostic validity was assessed by correlat-
ing  the  Mini- COPE  results  with  the  Mini- MAC  scale, 
it  was  designed  to  study  coping  strategies  in  cancer 
patients,  as  well  as  predicting  the  intensity  of  post-
traumatic  stress  symptoms  in  a  group  of  mothers  of 
children being treated for leukemia.

4.  The  Perceived  Stress  Scale  (PSS- 10)  by  S.  Cohen, 
T.  Kamarck,  R.  Mermelstein  (Polish  adaptation:  Z. 
Juczyński  and  N.  Ogińska- Bulik),30  consisting  of  10 
questions relating to various subjective experiences as-
sociated  with  personal  problems  and  life  events.  The 
internal consistency of Cronbach's alpha was 0.86. The 
split- half reliability based on a study conducted twice 
within a 2- day interval was 0.90, while within a 4- week 
interval it was found to be 0.72.5 The State–Trait Anxiety 
Inventory (STAI) by C. D. Spielberger, R. L. Gorsuch, 
R. E. Lushene31 (Polish adaptation: C.D. Spielberger, J. 
Strelau,  M.  Tysarczyk,  K.  Wrześniewski).32  The  ques-
tionnaire has two subscales comprising 20 items each. 
The first subscale assesses anxiety as a state, while the 
second  assesses  anxiety  as  a  trait.  The  internal  con-
sistency of both subscales is high. The validity of both 
scales has been confirmed in many studies.

2.2 

|  Statistics

Differences  between  the  results  obtained  by  the  par-
ticipants  using  various  scales  and  also  the  results  of  the 
validation  group  data  were  examined  using  one- sample 
t- tests. Assumptions regarding the normality of distribu-
tion and the size of the potential differences between the 
obtained  distribution  and  the  normal  distribution  were 
verified beforehand. The relationships between the quan-
titative variables were examined using Spearman's rho co-
efficients. The nonparametric correlation coefficient was 
chosen due to the presence of outliers in two- dimensional 
distributions  of  variables  (examined  using  scatter  plots). 
The  relationships  between  the  quantitative  and  qualita-
tive variables were verified using the Kruskal- Wallis tests. 
This  nonparametric  method  had  the  advantage  of  the 
lack  of  a  normal  distribution  in  the  compared  variables 
with significant fluctuations in the sizes of the compared 
groups (sometimes very small n < 10). The effect size for 
the  observed  differences  was  expressed  using  the  eta- 
squared or Cohen's d measures.

2.3 

|  Studied group

A total of 102 individuals participated in the study. Table 1 
presents the demographic characteristics of the group. The 
largest group of participants belonged to the age range of 
61–70 years. The majority of participants had a secondary 
education, with approximately 20% having primary, voca-
tional, or higher education. The place of residence divided 
the  participants  into  nearly  equal  parts.  The  majority  of 
individuals were married (over 60%) and identified them-
selves as believers (98.0%).

In the majority of cases, the patients had a malignant 
tumor  (88.2%),  while  every  tenth  participant  was  bur-
dened with a benign tumor (Table 2). Most frequently, the 
respondents  suffered  from  lung  or  digestive  system  can-
cers. The majority of respondents had been ill for no more 
than  a  year.  They  accounted  for  over  60%  of  the  entire 
sample. The most common treatment methods among the 
participants  were  chemotherapy  and  surgical  treatment. 
Treatment- related  decisions  were  made  jointly  by  the 
respondents and the doctor for the most part (56.9%). In 
assessing their level of knowledge about the disease, the 
majority of the respondents considered themselves well- 
informed (88.2%) and family support was felt by 92.2% of 
respondents, while its absence was reported by 7.8%.

patients with cancer

group  of  cancer  patients  was  conducted.  The  average 
score obtained by the participants was 52.06 points with 
a standard deviation of 11.08. The lowest level of emo-
tional control was 30, while the highest was 83 points. 
The Shapiro–Wilk test did not indicate any statistically 
significant deviation of the distribution of results in the 
overall emotional control scale from a normal distribu-
tion (SW = 0.981; p = 0.151). Low skewness and kurtosis 
coefficients also suggest a lack of significant deviations 
(SKEW = 0.228; KURT = −0.082). In order to determine 
the level of emotional control in the studied group, the 
results obtained in the individual scales were compared 
with  those  of  the  normalization  group  for  CECS.  One- 
sample t- tests were applied for this purpose. The results 
are presented in Table  3. Since the distribution of par-
ticipants  based  on  gender  did  not  differ  between  the 
validation and the study groups χ2 = 0.344; p = 0.557, the 
entire  participant  group  was  simultaneously  compared 
to the validation group without gender division through 
the  calculation  of  weighted  means  for  the  validation 
group's results.

In the first stage of the analysis, an examination of the 
obtained  results  regarding  emotional  control  in  the 

The conducted analysis revealed only one statistically 
significant,  weak  relationship  between  anxiety  control

the  coping  strategies  they  used  to  deal  with  stress  were 
examined (Table 4).

The  Shapiro–Wilk  tests  conducted  revealed  statisti-
cally  significant  differences  between  the  distributions 
obtained  in  the  all  mini- COPE  scales  and  the  normal 
distribution. The  participants  coping  with  stress  rarely 
resorted  to  humor,  alcohol  consumption,  cessation  of 
activity,  denial,  self- blame,  while  frequently  utilizing 
positive  reframing,  engagement  in  other  activities,  ac-
ceptance,  discharge,  turning  to  religion,  seeking  emo-
tional  and  instrumental  support,  planning,  and  active 
coping strategies. In order to compare the frequency of 
using a given stress coping strategy between the average 
individuals in the population and the surveyed group, a 
series of one- sample t- tests were applied. The results are 
presented in Table 5.

The  conducted  analyses  revealed  several  statistically 
significant differences between the studied group and the 
validation  group  of  mini- COPE. The  participants  sought 
emotional  support,  turned  to  religion,  discharged  their 
emotions,  engaged  in  distracting  activities,  and  lived  in 
denial more frequently as compared to the average person 

in the population. They also ceased to be active and denied 
it more often than individuals in the normalization group. 
Additionally,  they  consumed  alcohol  more  frequently, 
while using humor less often than individuals in the nor-
malization  group.  Table  6  presents  the  relationships  be-
tween stress coping strategies and the level of emotional 
control. These were examined using the Spearman's rank 
correlation coefficient.

The conducted analyses revealed several statistically 
significant  relationships,  most  of  which  were  weak. 
Moderate  correlations  were  observed  between  seek-
ing  emotional  support  and  all  dimensions  of  emotion 
suppression  (negative  correlation),  as  well  as  seeking 
instrumental  support  and  the  control  of  depression  as 
well  as  general  emotion  control.  Blaming  oneself  and 
the control of anxiety also showed a moderate negative 
correlation.

With  regard  to  anger  control,  seeking  emotional  and 
instrumental  support  and  discharge,  they  all  showed 
negative  correlations,  while  acceptance  and  a  cessation 
of  activity  showed  positive  correlations.  Similarly,  nega-
tive  correlations  were  observed  between  depression  and

sadness control and seeking instrumental and emotional 
support  as  well  as  discharge.  A  positive  correlation  was 
observed with blaming oneself. Similarly, the more the pa-
tient controlled their anxiety, the less likely they were to 
seek  emotional  and  instrumental  support,  and  the  more 
likely they were to blame themselves, engage in denial, or 
other negative thought processes.

sense of stress in the group of individuals 
with cancer

The  aim  of  the  next  stage  of  the  analysis  was  to  verify 
the  relationship  between  the  level  of  emotional  control 
among the participants and their perceived level of stress.

The PSS- 10 questionnaire was used to measure this stress. 
The  average  score  obtained  by  the  participants  in  the 
stress  perception  scale  was  22.20  points  with  a  standard 
deviation of 5.41. The lowest level of stress intensity was 7, 
while the highest was 35. The Shapiro–Wilk test indicated 
statistically  significant  differences  between  the  distribu-
tion of the scores in the PSS- 10 stress perception scale and 
the normal distribution (SW = 0.970; p = 0.021). However, 
these differences were not substantial, as indicated by the 
low  skewness  and  kurtosis  coefficients  (SKEW = −0.449; 
KURT = −0.188).  In  order  to  relate  the  results  obtained 
by  the  participants  to  the  overall  population,  the  scores 
obtained by the participants were compared using a one- 
sample t- test with the mean scores obtained by the valida-
tion group for PSS- 10. The results obtained are presented 
in Table 7.

The conducted analyses revealed a significantly higher 
level of experienced stress among the participants as com-
pared to the average person in the population.

Table 8 presents the results of the correlation analysis 

of the perceived stress levels of the participants.

The  conducted  analysis  did  not  reveal  any  statisti-
cally significant correlations between the sense of stress 
experienced by the subjects and their level of emotional 
control.

|  Emotional control and the 
3.4 
occurrence of anxiety in a group of 
individuals with cancer

The  aim  of  the  next  stage  of  the  analysis  was  to  verify  the 
relationship  between  the  level  of  emotional  control  of  the 
participants and their experience of anxiety, as well as their 
overall tendency to experience anxiety: anxiety as a currently 
experienced emotion (state) and anxiety propensity (trait).

The average score obtained by the participants on the 
scale  of  currently  experienced  anxiety  was  51.88  points 
with  a  standard  deviation  of  10.33.  The  lowest  intensity 
was 20, while the highest was 73. The Shapiro–Wilk test 
indicated statistically significant differences between the 
distribution  of  scores  on  the  scale  of  current  state  anxi-
ety  and  a  normal  distribution  (SW = 0.972;  p = 0.027). 
However,  these  differences  were  not  substantial,  as  in-
dicated  by  the  low  skewness  and  kurtosis  coefficients 
(SKEW = −0.533; KURT = 0.105).

The average score obtained by the participants on the 
scale of anxiety propensity was 52.16 points with a stan-
dard deviation of 8.46. The lowest intensity was 26, while 
the highest was 68. The Shapiro–Wilk test indicated statis-
tically significant differences between the distribution of 
scores on the scale of current state anxiety and a normal 
distribution (SW = 0.958; p = 0.002). However, these differ-
ences were not substantial, as indicated by the skewness 
and kurtosis coefficients (SKEW = −0.771; KURT = 0.508), 
although some left- skewness of the results was evident (a 
relative prevalence of higher scores over lower ones).

The  participants'  results  were  converted  to  a  stanine 
scale (ranging from 1 to 10, with a mean of 5.5 for the pop-
ulation and a standard deviation of 2). The results of the 
participants in stanines were then compared with the re-
sults of an average individual in a population of a similar 
age and gender to the participants, using the Student's t- 
test. The results are presented in Table 9.

The conducted analyses showed a significantly higher 
experience  of  anxiety  in  the  examined  group  as  well  as 
a  significantly  higher  tendency  to  experience  anxiety 
as  compared  to  the  average  person  in  the  population. 
Table  10  presents  the  results  of  the  correlation  analysis 
between  the  subjects'  sense  of  anxiety  and  their  level  of 
emotional control.

The  conducted  analysis  revealed  statistically  signifi-
cant, yet weak correlations between the currently experi-
enced  state  of  anxiety  and  the  control  of  depression,  as 
well as overall emotional control. The higher the intensity 
of  the  anxiety  experienced  by  the  participants,  the  more 
difficult  it  was  for  them  to  control  their  depression  and 
also their emotions in general.

|   DISCUSSIO N

In  the  described  study  it  was  shown  that  the  cancer  pa-
tients  exhibited  higher  levels  of  anxiety  suppression  as 
compared  to  the  normalization  group.  The  research  did 
not  find  any  differences  between  the  cancer  patients 
and  the  normalization  group  in  the  remaining  emo-
tional  control  scales,  thereby  indicating  that  the  control 
of sadness and depression did not differ significantly. In 
other  Polish  studies  conducted  by  Glińska,  Krzemińska, 
Lewandowska,  Miller,  Dziki,  and  Dzik  in  2014,33  the 
level of emotional control and the need for social support

among women with breast cancer were assessed. The re-
search revealed that the majority of the examined patients 
exhibited relatively high levels of emotional control over-
all. In comparison with the current study, the research by 
Galińska et al. showed similar results in terms of the emo-
tional control level scale.

On  the  one  hand,  suppression  may  be  an  appropri-
ate  method  for  reducing  anxiety- related  distortions 
in  time  perception.34  On  the  other  hand,  research  has 
shown35 that suppression strategies for regulating anxi-
ety arousal are the least effective of the three established 
strategies (as compared to reappraisal, acceptance). It is 
disadvantageous  both  in  terms  of  the  cost  of  cognitive 
attention36 the course of the disease itself and the treat-
ment process.37–39

The  studies  also  show  that  in  coping  with  stress, 
patients sought emotional support, and used both con-
structive  methods  (they  turned  to  religion,  released 
their emotions by engaging in alternative activities) and 
destructive  methods  which  related  to  the  use  of  stim-
ulants.  The  strategies  used  by  the  group  of  oncology 
patients  have  also  been  confirmed  by  other  studies,40 
which  paid  special  attention  to  the  fact  that  strategies

aimed  at  improving  emotionality  may  be  particularly 
beneficial.41

By addressing socio- cultural factors, in the subsequent 
Polish  studies  conducted,42  the  emotional  control  of  pa-
tients being treated for cancer was also tested. These stud-
ies did not find a relationship between the duration of the 
illness,  demographic  variables,  and  the  degree  of  emo-
tional  control.42  Another  study  that  analyzed  emotional 
control  among  individuals  undergoing  oncological  treat-
ment  (for  breast  cancer)  was  conducted  by  Zdończyk.43 
Furthermore, some studies indicated that women exhib-
ited the greatest tendency to suppress emotions in the area 
of anxiety,43 with a higher level of perceived stress while 
better controlling emotions such as anger, depression, and 
anxiety,44  which  aligned  with  the  results  of  the  current 
study.

4.1 

|  Conclusions

The  research  conducted  led  to  the  tentative  conclusion 
that patients with cancer deal with higher levels of anxi-
ety and also tend to suppress this emotion more intensely. 
These  results  concern  the  studied  sample  and  may  pro-
vide  the  basis  for  further  verification  in  other  groups  of 
patients. The research group was found to utilize positive 
revaluation strategies, make plans, substitute their usual 
activities  for  alternatives,  practice  acceptance,  engage  in 
emotional release, turn to religion and seek emotional and 
instrumental  support,  they  also  used  active  coping  tech-
niques when dealing with challenges. They consumed al-
cohol more frequently, but used humor less often. Their 
anger  control  was  found  to  be  inversely  proportional 
to  their  tendency  to  seek  emotional  and  instrumental

support and emotional release, while it was positively cor-
related  with  acceptance  and  ceasing  previously  normal 
activities.

The  analyses  conducted  demonstrated  a  greater  ten-
dency  in  the  studied  cancer  patients  to  experience  anxi-
ety  as  compared  to  the  average  person  in  the  population. 
Furthermore,  the  higher  the  intensity  of  the  anxiety  ex-
perienced by the participants, the more difficult it was for 
them to control their depression and also to regulate their 
emotional  state  overall.  The  results  obtained  indicate  the 
presence of a significant psychological burden on the stud-
ied cancer patients. These preliminary results require more 
research to confirm this tendency in cancer patients but it 
may also be assumed that this group of patients is diverse 
in terms of coping strategies. This may suggest the need for 
diverse  communication  and  education  in  the  field  of  ef-
fective  and  efficient  forms  of  emotion  regulation  support 
and coping strategies. This strategy should include certain 
elements of competence which are supported by cognitive- 
behavioral strategies and intervention programs for group 
risks that can be developed and transferred into guidelines 
designed to support the quality of life of patients.

4.2 

|  Clinical implications

In  conclusion,  it's  important  to  note  that  anxiety  can  be 
paralyzing,  but  it  also  presents  an  opportunity  for  a  posi-
tive reaction – sufficient motivation to take action (includ-
ing adhering to medical recommendations and cooperating 
with medical staff). This type of anxiety can be harnessed 
as  a  means  of  coping  with  cancer.45  Actively  coping  with 
cancer is associated with both a personal struggle and the 
search for emotional and instrumental support by individu-
als who are ill. Research confirms (including46) that actively 
coping  with  cancer  has  an  impact  on  achieving  a  higher 
quality of life, extending survival time, it even has an im-
pact on the manifestation of milder symptoms. The specific 
schedule  for  adopting  coping  styles  with  cancer  depends 
on the time that has passed since diagnosis and treatment, 
and therefore it varies accordingly. Providing psychological 
care and conducting screening for the perceived intensities 
of stress, anxiety, and the resulting coping strategies in dif-
ficult situations can significantly enhance the mental and 
physical quality of life for oncology patients.

participants. It would be useful to classify the studied in-
dividuals  not  only  based  on  the  duration  of  their  cancer 
but also to take into account the degree of its advancement 
(cf.46). This is an important consideration, as the duration 
of  the  disease  does  not  determine  its  stage,  and  cancers 
are often diagnosed at an advanced stage of their develop-
ment. It's highly likely that a stronger relationship exists 
between this variable and emotional control.

Another area worthy of further exploration is the type 
of cancer that the patient is suffering from. It should be 
borne  in  mind  that  the  study  did  not  explore  the  rela-
tionship  between  anxiety,  the  progression  of  cancer  and 
the prognosis for recovery. Further analyses should con-
tinue to explore this area and should also be undertaken 
to verify whether treatment or intervention in the case of 
cancer has an impact on the anxiety and depression states 
of  patients,  as  well  as  exploring  whether  treatment  or 
intervention in the case of anxiety has an impact on the 
progression  of  cancer.  Controlling  the  relevant  variables 
or  designing  a  model  in  which  variables  have  sufficient 
influence  to  moderate  cancer  progression  could  signifi-
cantly increase the applied value of the research.
