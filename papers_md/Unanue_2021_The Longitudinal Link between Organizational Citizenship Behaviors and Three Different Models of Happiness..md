Abstract: A growing body of research conducted in general life settings has found positive associa-
tions between happiness and prosocial behavior. Unfortunately, equivalent studies in the workplace
are lacking. Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), the prosocial behaviors at work, have not
been properly studied in relation to happiness, despite the positive consequences of both constructs
for workers and companies. In response, our research aims to better understand this relationship
from several angles. First, using a three-wave longitudinal design, we explored how OCBs and
happiness are related to each other over time. Second, happiness was measured from a broad
perspective, and three conceptualizations were adopted: the hedonic (e.g., positive affect and life
satisfaction), the eudaimonic (e.g., relatedness and autonomy), and the ﬂourishing (e.g., meaning
and engagement) approaches. Thus, not only the prospective link between OCBs and happiness was
tested, but it was also explored using the three models of happiness previously mentioned. Third,
we conducted this longitudinal design in a less typical sample than previous research (i.e., Chile). We
found results that supported our main hypotheses: (1) OCBs are prospective positive predictors of
hedonic happiness, eudaimonic happiness, and ﬂourishing; (2) the three models of happiness also
prospectively predict OCBs. Our ﬁndings suggest that OCBs foster a broad range of happiness facets,
which in turn fosters back the emergence of more OCBs, leading to a virtuous circle of prosociality
and well-being in the workplace. This positive spiral beneﬁts not only workers’ quality of life, but
also organizations’ proﬁtability and sustainability. Theoretical and applied implications for the ﬁeld
of Positive Organizational Psychology are discussed.

1. Introduction

“The best way to ﬁnd your own happiness and the happiness of others, is to open
your heart . . . so be good, do good.”

Matthieu Ricard

A growing body of research conducted in general life settings has found positive
associations between happiness and prosocial behaviors (PSBs; see [1–4]). Unfortunately,
the equivalent of PSBs in the workplace, organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs),
have not been studied in the same manner in relation to happiness. Since research has
consistently shown the positive consequences of happiness and OCBs for both workers and
organizations (e.g., enhanced health, job satisfaction, performance, etc.; see [5–9]), studying
the particular features of this relationship is worthy.

Aiming to ﬁll the previous research gap, we explored prospectively the link between
OCBs and happiness. In addition, we studied happiness from a holistic perspective, using
three well-known conceptualizations of happiness: the hedonic approach, the eudaimonic
approach, and the ﬂourishing approach [10–12]. Each of the three happiness conceptualiza-

tions may provide unique and important information regarding the happiness-OCBs link
in the study.

Drawing on a substantial body of research in psychology, we theorized that the
OCBs–happiness link is reciprocal and that this bi-directionality applies to these three
happiness conceptualizations. Indeed, despite the fact that most research on well-being
and OCBs presumes that well-being is the driver of OCBs [13], both well-being (e.g., [14])
and organizational researchers (e.g., [15]) state that the opposite direction may also be
possible (see, [16]). Further, we conducted a three-wave longitudinal design, using a
cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). The CLPM conducted allowed us to test prospective
(i.e., temporal) directions between OCBs and happiness [17]. Although CLPMs do not
test causality directly, prospective signiﬁcance between constructs is a key requirement
for causality. Indeed, CLPMs allow “looking at autoregressive effects (linking a variable
at earlier time points to itself at later time points) and cross-lagged effects (linking two
different variables across time)” [18] (p. 183), [19]. Therefore, our design would not only
allow testing the associations between the constructs of interest, but also disentangling the
right directionality between them.

To our best knowledge, this research is the ﬁrst to date to explore the reciprocal
longitudinal link between OCBs and three conceptualizations of happiness in an organi-
zational context. Further, we expect that our results bring new insights to academics and
practitioners in the Positive Organization Psychology ﬁeld (POS), which aims to improve
workers’ quality of life as well as build healthier and more resilient organizations [20]. We
hope that our ﬁndings help POS to advance its knowledge regarding how employees and
organizations may increase their performance and, at the same time, ﬂourish.

2. Theoretical Background
2.1. Happiness

Happiness is a broad construct that has been conceptualized from three psychological
perspectives: the hedonic, eudaimonic, and ﬂourishing approaches [21,22]. In this section,
we will characterize these three conceptualizations.

2.1.1. Hedonic Happiness

Hedonic theories have formed the most extensively studied approach to happiness [7,23].
This view deﬁnes happiness in terms of attaining pleasure and avoiding pain [11]. The
construct of subjective well-being (SWB) was developed by Diener [24] to measure hedonic
happiness. SWB assesses people’s sense of wellness, in both thoughts and feelings, and
includes three facets: satisfaction with life, positive affect, and negative affect [8]. Life
satisfaction, the cognitive aspect of SWB, captures satisfaction with one’s life in a broad
sense (e.g., marriage, job, health). Positive (e.g., pleasure, enjoyment, contentment, love)
and negative (e.g., fear, anger, and depression) feelings capture the emotional aspects of
SWB. Further, in this theorization, a happy person thinks her/his life is going well and
experiences frequent positive affect and only occasional negative affect [8].

2.1.2. Eudaimonic Happiness

According to the eudaimonic perspective, happiness is more than feeling pleasure
and avoiding pain. Happiness reﬂects the actualization of human potential, meaning,
and self-realization [10,11,22]. Further, eudaimonic approaches conceptualize happiness
in terms of being fully functioning and having a life that is worth living [11,23,25]. Ba-
sic psychological needs theory (BPNT; [26,27]), one of the six self-determination theory
(SDT) “mini-theories” [28], is a theory of eudaimonic happiness [10]. Following Deci and
Ryan’s [26] original ideas, just as plants need essential nutrients—such as water, sunlight,
and minerals—for survival, so people need psychological nutrients for healthy growth and
well-being [29]. BPNT states that the satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs
(BPNS)—autonomy, competence, and relatedness—would function as the necessary psy-
chological nutrients for wellness and optimal functioning. Autonomy refers to the feeling

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 6387

3 of 20

that our behavior is volitional and meaningful; competence refers to feeling effective and
efﬁcient in our behavior, as well as being able to successfully manage difﬁcult challenges;
relatedness refers to feeling that we are connected, appreciated, and understood by others
who are important to us through intimate relationships [28,30–32].

2.1.3. Flourishing

Although the hedonic and eudaimonic approaches have evolved separately, attention
is increasingly being given to how both perspectives are connected [25]. Indeed, focusing
only on hedonic or eudaimonic aspects of happiness has been strongly questioned [22,33],
resulting “in the development of more integrated frameworks” [10] (p. 186). Flourishing is
one of the terms that several academics have used to unify the eudaimonic and hedonic
models of happiness [12,34,35]. The PERMA model is the most popular conceptualization
of ﬂourishing. It was developed by Martin Seligman, one of the founders of the Positive
Psychology ﬁeld [36]. Seligman [12] proposed a theory of well-being, in which ﬂourishing
is deﬁned in terms of ﬁve pillars: positive emotions (P), engagement (E), relationships (R),
meaning (M), and accomplishment (A). To disseminate his theory, the author published
a book called, “Flourish: A visionary new understanding of happiness and well-being.”
Seligman’s book has sold more than 70,000 copies worldwide, inspiring a multiplicity
of researchers, practitioners, conferences, and governments around the world (see, [37]).
Despite its vast popularity and inﬂuence in the positive psychology ﬁeld, research using the
PERMA model is scant, and only a few studies have been published to date (see, [38–40]).
We think that the PERMA model is a promising avenue for predicting quality of life, but
the evidence is still in progress. Further, by including it in our research, we are contributing
to overcoming the scarce literature using this framework.

We decided to explore the three above-mentioned psychological perspectives of hap-
piness in our paper for two main reasons. First, understanding happiness only from the
hedonic perspective may lead people to think, misleadingly, that humans only search for
pleasure and avoid pain. Yet, people are more complex entities. Beyond pleasure and
pain, humans need, for example, to build strong social ties and ﬁnd meaning in life. These
facets are captured by the eudaimonic and ﬂourishing models, respectively. Second, each
of the three happiness conceptualizations may provide unique and important information
regarding the happiness–OCBs link in the study.

2.2. Organizational Citizenship Behaviors

OCB, a kind of pro-social behavior conducted within the workplace, refers to “indi-
vidual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal
reward system, and in the aggregate promotes the efﬁcient and effective functioning of
the organization” [41] (p. 6). In other words, OCBs are behaviors that are not speciﬁed
in the job description and involve personal choice, and the workers are not punished for
engaging or not in the act [41].

For many decades, OCBs have been conceptualized through different approaches [5,42].
The roots of OCBs are attributed to Katz [43], who used the term innovative and sponta-
neous behaviors. The author stated that these behaviors comprise ﬁve key dimensions:
cooperation acts, protection acts, constructive ideas, self-training, and favorable attitudes.
Organ [44] and Smith et al. [45] were the ﬁrst to propose the term OCBs. Smith et al. [45]
argued that facets such as acts of cooperation, helpfulness, suggestions, gestures of good-
will, and altruism may be considered citizenship behaviors. The authors also suggested
two dimensions: altruism (actions of helping toward individuals) and general compliance
(prosocial behaviors directed towards the organization). Similarly, Williams and Ander-
son [46] suggested classifying OCBs into two dimensions: OCBs-I (prosocial behaviors
towards individuals) and OCBs-O (prosocial behaviors towards the organization).

Podsakoff et al.’s [47] meta-analysis concluded that the most cited dimensions of
OCBs were helping behavior, sportsmanship, organizational loyalty, organizational com-
pliance, individual initiative, civic virtue, and self-development. Interestingly, most di-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 6387

4 of 20

mensions found by Podsakoff et al. [47] collapsed with the facets proposed by Katz [47].
LePine et al. [48] supported previous ﬁndings. The authors reviewed the literature on
OCBs and their dimensions in order to test the widely held assumption that the behavioral
dimensions of OCBs are distinct from one another. Using meta-analytic techniques, they
found “strong relationships among most of the dimensions and that the dimensions have
equivalent relationships with the predictors” (p. 52).

Thus, despite a multiplicity of dimensions that have emerged over decades to char-
acterize OCBs [5], there is strong agreement that OCBs are acts of helping, kindness, and
generosity toward individuals and organizations. As an analogy, if civic citizenship behav-
ior is the “exemplar” behavior of every citizen, OCB is the “exemplar” behavior of every
worker [49].

2.3. Research Gaps for the Link between OCBs and Happiness

Prosocial behaviors (e.g., donating blood, volunteering, giving time, and money; PSBs)
“represent a broad category of acts that are deﬁned by some signiﬁcant segment of society
and/or one’s social group as generally beneﬁcial to other people” [50] (p. 366). Research has
found positive associations between happiness and PSBs in general life settings [3,4,51–53].
Recent studies have even suggested that the link may be causal and reciprocal: People
who engage more in PSBs are happier, but also happier people tend to engage more in
PSBs [1,2]. Unfortunately, this kind of research is lacking in the workplace, and the link
between OCBs (prosocial acts in organizations) and happiness has not been tested yet.
Further, we identiﬁed three main research gaps.

First, as far as we know, just a few studies conducted in the workplace have explored
the link between OCBs and only some facets of hedonic (e.g., positive affect; [13,54])
and eudaimonic happiness (e.g., autonomy; [55]). Unfortunately, no research to date has
explored the link between OCBs and any proper models/construct of happiness. Second,
the directionality of the link is not clear yet. Indeed, no research to date has explored how
both constructs relate to each other over time. Do OCBs lead to higher happiness or does
happiness lead to higher OCBs? Is it possible to have a reciprocal link? These questions
may be solved using longitudinal designs. However, for quite a long time, researchers have
been claiming the lack of longitudinal research in this ﬁeld of study [56]. Third, the scarcity
of studies exploring OCBs and some facets of happiness are culturally laden. Indeed, there
is a lack of cultural diversity. Previous attempts to explore the link between OCBs and
speciﬁc facets of happiness have been conducted mainly in the Western World in countries
such as the US (e.g., [13,16]) and Canada [57,58], with a few exceptions in China [59,60]
and Indonesia [61].

In the same vein, Urbach et al. [62] state that “the effect of societal culture and its
associated values has received little research attention to date” (p. 2). That is unfortu-
nate, because cultural differences may affect both the antecedents and the consequences
of employees’ proactive work behaviors (such as some OCBs). Thus, testing the link be-
tween OCBs and happiness in different cultural contexts seems needed. Chile, a Latin
American country going through a fast economic and social transition, is different from
the North American and Asian countries usually included in this ﬁeld of research (see
Unanue et al. [19] for details). Therefore, we decided to test our hypotheses in a Chilean
sample, in order to go beyond the East–West dichotomy [63]. Our research aims to ﬁll
previous research gaps.

3. Hypotheses Development
3.1. The Hypothesized Reciprocal Link between SWB and OCBs
3.1.1. The Link from SWB to OCBs

We used the SWB construct [24] to measure hedonic happiness. People high in SWB
have a “sense of wellness in their lives—in both thoughts and feelings”. That is because
individuals with high SWB tend to show high levels of life satisfaction and positive affect,
as well as low levels of negative affect [8] (p. 90). Therefore, feeling and thinking that

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 6387

5 of 20

our lives are going well lead us to be more inclusive and sympathetic to other people.
In the workplace, happiness should have similar consequences. Indeed, we expect that
workers high in SWB tend to see their colleagues and organizations in a more positive
way, feel greater compassion, have more sympathy, and desire to help [8], which in turn,
could promote the pursuit of OCBs [64]. In other words, high SWB leads employees to
perceive things in a more positive light, which consecutively increases the likelihood of
feeling positive towards co-workers, encouraging helpfulness, and thus OCBs [65]. Because
high SWB is self-reinforcing, when people feel good at work, employees try to maintain
these positive feelings through, for instance, protecting the organization with more OCBs.
By protecting the organization, “the worker in a positive mood helps to ensure that his or
her own good mood is maintained” [65] (p. 316). Moreover, positive moods also foster
creativity and innovation, thus leading workers to make potentially more constructive
suggestions for the organizations. People high in SWB are also more self-conﬁdent, self-
efﬁcacious, and capable at work, leading them to increase their aspirations and get involved
in more self-development activities, which bring beneﬁts not only to themselves, but also
to the whole organizational environment. Finally, workers high in SWB “are more likely to
evaluate the organization favorably and, hence, spread goodwill” [65] (p. 317). Hence, we
have the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 1a (H1a). Hedonic happiness (i.e., SWB) prospectively predicts future OCBs.

3.1.2. The Link from OCBs to SWB

OCBs increase SWB, helping workers to feel and think that their lives are satisfactory
and rewarding, to experience more positive and less negative feelings, and have better life
evaluations. One of the theoretical explanations for the impact of OCBs on SWB comes
from novel studies on benevolence. Recent research has found that OCBs predict higher
benevolence (a sense of having a positive impact on others; Gomez et al. [66]), which in
turn increases SWB [52]. Additional support for the link from OCBs to SWB comes from
van der Linden’s (2012) Helper’s theory (cited in [67]). The author suggests that any kind
of prosocial behavior (i.e., OCBs) leads to the “feel-good” effect through the activation of
neurotransmitters that fosters positive feelings and cognitions in the giver. Additionally,
by experiencing positive emotions, there is less room left for negative emotions, which also
increases SWB. Therefore, we have the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1b (H1b). OCBs prospectively predict future hedonic happiness (i.e., SWB).

3.2. The Hypothesized Reciprocal Link between BPNS and OCBs
3.2.1. The Link from BPNS to OCBs

We used the SDT framework [26,28] to conceptualize eudaimonic happiness through
the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and related-
ness (BPNS; [26,27]). SDT claims that “we are naturally inclined to be prosocial animals,
given proper nurturing” [68] (p. 202). When our needs for autonomy, competence, and
relatedness are fulﬁlled, we have more vital energy and, thus, we are more likely to engage
in behaviors such as helping colleagues at work [68]. Furthermore, workers who have their
needs met, are more likely to get involved in extra-role behaviors (a key feature of OCBs).
For example, the satisfaction of the need for autonomy could energize workers into helping
colleagues and the organization, “both as a response to social exchange obligations, but
perhaps also through having greater time to spend on activities beyond their immediate job
requirements” [69] (p. 4). Actually, the concept of autonomy refers to the power and free-
dom felt by employees when organizing their job activities according to their own pace and
priorities. Thus, the higher the autonomy, the higher the opportunities to show voluntarily
extra-role behavior such as OCBs. Autonomy is a motivational force that leads employees
to put extra effort into OCBs, going beyond the formal work requirements [55,70].

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 6387

The satisfaction of the need for competence (as a result of their enhanced efﬁciency
and effectiveness) may also give employees enough energy as well as conﬁdence in their
abilities [59], leading them to give greater assistance to colleagues and the organization [71].
Additionally, competence satisfaction may predict higher OCBs, because demonstrating
and improving one’s abilities through these kinds of extra-role behaviors is fundamen-
tally satisfying [72]. The satisfaction of the need for relatedness helps employees to feel
connected to and cared for by relevant others at work, which consecutively leads them
to feel an increased sense of belonging and increased motivation to help those around
them [60]. Indeed, “a satisﬁed sense of relatedness provides a secure base of support
encouraging novel, exploratory, and potentially risky endeavors” such as creative and
prosocial behaviors” [60] (p. 1041). Thus, higher relatedness provides a background that
enables employees to display initiative in extra-role behaviors. Importantly, the needs for
relatedness “include the desire to connect with others, to give affection, and to receive love
and care in return” [72] (p. 874). Thus, in order to satisfy this need, workers may establish
emotional bonds through OCBs.

To summarize, higher BPNS fosters interest in supporting one’s organization and
colleagues through higher levels of OCBs [60]. Indeed, BPNS may increase the likelihood
of workers practicing OCBs, because they represent an energetic resource that propels a
variety of self-motivated behaviors [73,74]. Therefore, we have the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 2a (H2a). Eudaimonic happiness (i.e., BPNS) prospectively predicts future OCBs.

3.2.2. The Link from OCBs to BPNS

Drawing on SDT research (SDT; [28]), we hypothesized that PSBs (i.e., OCBs) foster
the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relat-
edness [53]. OCBs might boost the satisfaction of the need for autonomy, because the
volitional act of helping (a core characteristic of OCBs) “can be experienced as truly self-
initiated and endorsed”, promoting the perception of autonomy [53] (p. 224). OCBs also
enhance the psychological need for competence, because workers may feel that they are
producing positive changes in the lives of the recipients of their help. Indeed, extra-role
behaviors such as helping others “elicit experiences of competence, involvement, and
usefulness” [53] (p. 224) as well as self-efﬁcacy.

Finally, OCBs promote the satisfaction of the need for relatedness. Actually, OCBs
are “inherently interpersonal and thus impact relatedness by directly promoting closeness
to others, positive responses from others, and cohesiveness or intimacy” [53] (p. 224).
Thus, in the workplace, OCBs are key nutrients for keeping meaningful relationships with
workers and the organization. To summarize, OCBs may foster BPNS, because OCBs are
associated with higher levels of the three needs. OCBs may satisfy the need for autonomy,
“insofar as prosocial acts are volitional and autonomous”. OCBs may also satisfy the need
for competence, “insofar as one feels effective in helping”. Finally, OCBs may also satisfy
the need for relatedness, “insofar as one feels more connected with others” [51] (p.751).
Therefore, we have the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 2b (H2b). OCBs prospectively predict future eudaimonic happiness (i.e., BPNS).

3.3. The Hypothesized Reciprocal Link between PERMA and OCBs

We used the PERMA model of well-being to conceptualize ﬂourishing (Seligman, 2011).
Since Seligman includes both hedonic and eudaimonic components of happiness in the
PERMA model, and we have already extensively explained the psychological mechanisms
at the basis of a potential bi-directional link between these two conceptualizations of
happiness and OCBs, we also expect a similar relation of PERMA with OCBs. Hence, we
have the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 3a (H3a). Flourishing (i.e., the PERMA model) prospectively predicts future OCBs.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 6387

Hypothesis 3b (H3b). OCBs prospectively predict future ﬂourishing (i.e., the PERMA model).

4. The Present Research

In the previous sections, we have identiﬁed several research gaps regarding the study
of the OCB–happiness link. Therefore, the main goal of our study is to ﬁll these gaps by
exploring prospectively the link between OCBs and the three models of happiness already
explained (hedonic happiness, eudaimonic happiness, and ﬂourishing). To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst longitudinal study to date to test not only the hypothesized link
from happiness to OCBs, but also the hypothesized reverse link from OCBs to happiness in
an organizational context. In addition, we extended previous research conducted mainly
in a small number of countries in the Western world, with a few exceptions in Asia. We
analyzed data from Chile, going beyond the traditional Western–Eastern paradox [63].

5. Method
5.1. Procedure

Our research is part of a large longitudinal project on happiness and well-being funded
by the Chilean government. It was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee from a
Chilean university and followed ethical procedures to avoid coercion (e.g., participation
was voluntary and online; no penalties were applied in case of leaving the study). At T1,
Chilean workers received an online invitation to participate in a three-wave longitudinal
study and were asked to consent to future waves (T2 and T3). Consenting T1 participants
were sent an email containing a web-link to the questionnaire. Participants who ﬁnished
the T1 survey were invited to participate at T2 and T3. Those participants who decided
not to participate in the study (at any time/wave) were given the option to unsubscribe
from the mailing list and were not contacted later. In each wave, respondents were notiﬁed
that the survey would be available for only one week. Kind reminders were sent twice in
each wave.

5.2. Sample

Data for our core variables were obtained from a three-wave longitudinal survey
with one month between each wave (T1 n = 735 (42.97% female; Mean age = 38.77;
SD = 9.69); T2 n = 282; T3 n = 288; for more details see Table 1). Regarding attrition,
those who completed our main constructs in all the three waves (n = 171, 23%) did not
differ signiﬁcantly in age, gender, SWB, BPNS, PERMA, or OCBs from those who left after
T1 or T2 (n = 564; p ≥ 0.04). A total of 15% of 735 participated in T1 and T2, 16% participated
in T1 and T3, and 46% participated in T1 only. The results of the Little MCAR test [75]
showed that missing data were completely at random for the three models (Model 1:
χ2(126) = 152.88, p = 0.052; Model 2: χ2(108) = 128.86, p = 0.084; Model 3: χ2(144) = 166.78,
p = 0.094). Thus, we included all 735 participants in our structural analyses, using FIML
to handle missing data [76]. FIML infers the model log-likelihoods using all observed
cases, obtaining equivalent results that of multiple imputation methods if the data missing
mechanism is MCAR or MAR [77]. Additionally, we compared the obtained estimates to
their listwise counterpart, and because the observed data were MAR, the results were very
similar. The estimates’ raw differences ranged from 0.00 to 0.04, showing the same pattern
of results, yet reaching non-signiﬁcance levels for Model 1 and 3 due to sample loss, while
results from Model 2 supported the same conclusions.

Regarding normality, the assumption is tenable if skewness ranges from −2 to +2 and
kurtosis ranges from −7 to +7 [78–80]; all skewness (−1.74 to −0.14) and kurtosis values
(2.69 to 7.04) ranged acceptably.

Recommended sample sizes for SEM vary widely. Wolf et al. [81] have shown that
as many as 460 participants may be sufﬁcient and that the required sample size does not
necessarily increase with model complexity. Thus, we judge that our current sample size
(N = 735) is good enough for testing all our longitudinal SEM models.

5.3. Measures

All constructs were captured through highly validated scales, which were translated

into Spanish using a standard back-translation procedure [82].

5.3.1. Hedonic Happiness

We used the SWB construct developed by Diener [24]. SWB consisted of three sub-

scales: life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect.

Positive and Negative Affect. We used the 10-item International Positive and Negative
Affect Schedule Short Form (I-PANAS-SF; [83]) to measure positive (5 items) and negative
affect (5 items). Example items asked participants how frequently they had felt “inspired”,
“alert”, “upset”, or “nervous” during the last month, ranging from never (1) to always
(5). Cronbach’s alphas for positive affect were good at T1 (0.72), T2 (0.74), and T3 (0.73).
Cronbach’s alphas for negative affect were acceptable at T1 (0.69), T2 (0.74), and T3 (0.75).
Life Satisfaction. We used the 5-item Satisfaction with Life Scale [84]. Participants
rated ﬁve items, such as “in most ways my life is close to my ideal” and “the conditions
of my life are excellent” on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree to
strongly agree. Cronbach’s alphas were good at T1 (0.91), T2 (0.93), and T3 (0.93). We
built a latent variable for SWB. We created ﬁve item parcels as indicators, using domain-
representative parcels [85]. This parcel construction consisted of including a single parcel
item from each scale facet (one positive affect, one negative affect, and one life satisfaction
item). This parcel strategy aimed to maximize SWB variance while canceling out nuisance
factors in the interest of the study. To summarize, each SWB latent variable was built with
5 parcels as indicators. Each of the 5 parcels has 3 items.

5.3.2. Eudaimonic Happiness

We used the BPNS scale, a 12-item scale developed by Chen et al. [86]. Participants
rated from 1 (not at all true) to 7 (very true) their satisfaction of the needs for autonomy,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 6387

competence, and relatedness. Example items (four for each need) included “I feel my
choices express who I really am” (autonomy), “I feel capable at what I do” (competence),
and “I feel connected with people who care for me, and for whom I care” (relatedness).
Cronbach’s alphas were good at T1 (0.90), T2 (0.93), and T3 (0.94). We built latent variables
for BPNS. We used four item parcels as indicators of each latent variable. To ensure
that each latent variable would equally represent all three needs, each parcel used one
autonomy, one competence, and one relatedness item. To summarize, each BPNS latent
variable was built with 4 parcels as indicators. Each of the 4 parcels has 3 items.

5.3.3. Flourishing

We used the PERMA-Proﬁler [87]. The measure captures the ﬁve components pro-
posed by Seligman [12], with three questions per construct. Participants answered on an
11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10, and the items within each construct were averaged
together to create an indicator of that domain. Example items are “In general, how often
do you feel joyful?” (P: positive emotions); “In general, to what extent do you feel excited
and interested in things?” (E: engagement); “To what extent have you been feeling loved?”
(R: relationships); “In general, to what extent do you feel that what you do in your life is
valuable and worthwhile?” (M: meaning); and “How often do you achieve the important
goals you have set for yourself?” (A: accomplishment). Cronbach’s alphas for the PERMA
scale were good at T1 (0.93), T2 (0.95), and T3 (0.96). We built latent variables for ﬂourishing.
We used three item parcels as indicators. To ensure that each latent variable would equally
represent all ﬁve dimensions, each parcel used one positive emotion, one engagement, one
relationship, one meaning, and one accomplishment item. To summarize, each PERMA
latent variable was built with 3 parcels as indicators. Each of the 3 parcels has 5 items.

5.3.4. Organizational Citizenship Behaviors

We used the 16-item scale developed by Lee and Allen [57]. Participants answered
on a 7-point scale from 0 (never) to 7 (always) how often they behave in several ways.
Example items are “help others who have been absent” and “attend functions that are not
required but that help the organizational image”. Cronbach’s alphas for the OCBs scale
were good at T1 (0.92), T2 (0.93), and T3 (0.95). We built latent variables for OCBs. We used
three item parcels as indicators, balancing the 16 scale items. To summarize, each OCB
latent variable was built with 3 parcels as indicators. Whereas the ﬁrst and second parcels
had 6 items, the third parcel had 4 items.

5.4. Plan of Analysis

We conducted a three-wave longitudinal design, with one month between each wave
among a large sample of Chilean workers (N = 735). We tested three different CLPMs.
Model 1 tested the prospective link between OCBs and hedonic happiness. Model 2
tested the prospective link between OCBs and eudaimonic happiness. Model 3 tested the
prospective link between OCBs and ﬂourishing. For each CLPM, each measure at (T + 1)
was regressed on its own lagged measure at (T) as well as on the other lagged measure at
(T) [88]. We allowed OCBs and each measure of happiness to covary freely within each
time point. Thus, all constructs were represented as potential antecedents and potential
consequences of the other construct, while controlling for stability paths.

Our sample size and the three-wave design allowed us to use rigorous statistical
analyses. Modeling latent variables reduces the biasing effects of measurement error [88],
providing stronger estimates of stability paths and thus more stringent tests of the hypoth-
esized cross-lagged parameters. We used MPlus 7.1 [89] to model the relations among
the latent variables. Descriptive statistics and correlations are shown in Table 2 (Model
1), Table 3 (Model 2), and Table 4 (Model 3). Following the recommendations of Hu and
Bentler [90] and Kline [80], we assessed the model ﬁt through the root mean square error
of approximation (RMSEA) and comparative ﬁt index (CFI), with values of RMSEA < 0.06
(0.08) and CFI > 0.95 (0.90) indicating acceptable ﬁt.

6. Results
6.1. Model 1: The Longitudinal Link between OCBs and Hedonic Happiness

First, we started with a CLPM without any constraints. This model ﬁt the data
well, χ2(217) = 384.236, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.977, and RMSEA = 0.032 (90% CI: 0.027, 0.038).
Second, we constrained all the factor loadings of each latent variable to be equal across
waves. The model also ﬁt the data well, χ2(229) = 396.916, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.977, and
RMSEA = 0.032 (90% CI: 0.026, 0.037). According to Cheung and Rensvold [91], the as-
sumption of invariance is tenable if the reduction in CFI, when constraints are imposed,
is less than 0.01. Here, the change in CFI met this criterion (∆CFI = 0.000). Thus, we con-
sidered it acceptable to assume invariance for this CLPM and kept this constraint further.
Third, and ﬁnally, we made the simplifying assumption of constraining autoregressive and
cross-lagged paths to be invariant over time in our last model [92]. In other words, we
assumed that “the paths do not differ across the time points (i.e., a stationary process; [93])”,
as recommended by Olafsen et al. [94] (p. 280). Indeed, the time distance between T1–T2 is
the same time distance between T2–T3 (4 weeks), and we do not have any conceptual or
theoretical reason to assume that the paths would differ between waves. Because of that,
the interplay of variables would be in a stationary state, implying that every predictive path
between pairs of waves is conceptually equivalent, which allows us to build collapsed and
more parsimonious models [94] as well as gain statistical power. Hence, each hypothesis
was represented by a single parameter representing the combined effect from T1 to T2 and
from T2 to T3 (we maintained this assumption for Model 2 and Model 3 below). This ﬁnal
model showed a good ﬁt, χ2(233) = 399.416, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.977, and RMSEA = 0.031 (90%
CI: 0.026, 0.036). Unstandardized factor loadings ranged from 0.941 to 1.496 (all p < 0.001).
For simplicity, because unstandardized paths between T1–T2 are the same as paths between
T2–T3, we only reported the former (T1–T2) within the text. Structural parameters for
our CLPM are reported in detail in Figure 1. We followed the same procedure in Model 2
(Figure 2) and Model 3 (Figure 3). Supporting H1a, hedonic happiness at T1 was a positive
prospective predictor of OCBs at T2 (β = 0.26, [95% CI 0.007, 0.506], p = 0.04). Supporting

H1b, OCBs at T1 was a signiﬁcant positive prospective predictor of hedonic happiness at
T2 (β = 0.02, [95% CI. 0.00, 0.032], p = 0.04).

6.2. Model 2: The Longitudinal Link between OCBs and Eudaimonic Happiness

First, we started with a CLPM without any constraints. This model ﬁt the data well,
χ2(157) = 362.388, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.981, RMSEA = 0.042 (90% CI: 0.037, 0.048). Second,
we constrained all the factor loadings of each latent variable to be equal across waves.
The model also ﬁt the data well, χ2(167) = 379.039, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.981, RMSEA = 0.042
(90% CI: 0.036, 0.047). Because the reduction in CFI is less than 0.01 (∆CFI = 0.000), we
considered it acceptable to assume invariance for this CLPM and kept this constrained
further [91]. Third, and ﬁnally, we constrained autoregressive and cross-lagged paths
to be invariant over time [92,94]. This ﬁnal model showed a good ﬁt, χ2(171) = 389.444,
p < 0.001, CFI = 0.980, and RMSEA = 0.042 (90% CI: 0.036, 0.047). Unstandardized factor
loadings ranged from 0.941 to 1.085 (all p < 0.001). Structural parameters for our CLPM are
reported in detail in Figure 2. Supporting H2a, eudaimonic happiness at T1 was a positive
prospective predictor of OCBs at T2 (β = 0.17, [95% CI 0.080, 0.260], p < 0.001). Supporting
H2b, OCBs at T1 were signiﬁcant positive prospective predictors of eudaimonic happiness
at T2 (β = 0.06, [95% CI. 0.023, 0.103], p = 0.002).

7. Discussion

Although a few studies had made attempts to explore the link between OCBs and
happiness in the organizational context before our research, there were still important
gaps that needed to be addressed. First, the scarcity of studies on the link between OCBs
and happiness have only tested individual facets of their respective models (e.g., affect,
relatedness, meaning) instead of testing comprehensive models of happiness as a whole
construct (e.g., hedonic happiness, eudaimonic happiness, and ﬂourishing). Second, the
directionality of the link is still unknown. Most research has assumed that happiness is
the driver of OCB. However, we hypothesized that the link would be reciprocal. Third,
most previous research was conducted in the Western World with a few exceptions in Asia.
Thus, more research is needed in different cultural backgrounds, such as Latin-American.
In response to the identiﬁed research gaps, we conducted a three-wave longitudinal design
in order to test the prospective link between OCBs and each of the three mentioned models
of happiness among Chilean workers in an organizational context. Key ﬁndings emerge
from our research. First, we found that OCBs are prospective positive predictors of hedonic
happiness, eudaimonic happiness, and ﬂourishing. Second, the three models of happiness
prospectively predict higher OCBs. Thus, we showed, for the ﬁrst time, that OCBs and each
of the three models of happiness are reciprocally linked in a virtuous circle of prosociality
and well-being in the workplace.

In spite of the signiﬁcant reciprocal links found between OCBs and the three models of
happiness, it is worth mentioning that the strengths of the relationships seem to be different
in all of them. Unfortunately, since we ran three different models, our design does not allow
the analysis of statistical differences between the respective paths across Model 1, Model 2,
and Model 3. We are only able to comment on these differences as tendencies. It is relevant
to notice that, in order to compare the strength of the effect sizes, we are focusing on the
standardized paths reported in Figures 1–3 (curly parentheses). For example, regarding
the link from happiness to OCBs, our results show that the stronger predictor of OCBs
seems to be BPNS (eudaimonic happiness; β = 0.12), followed by PERMA (ﬂourishing;
β = 0.10) and then by SWB (hedonic happiness; β = 0.07). Although we did not hypothesize
these differences, these preliminary results could make theoretical sense. Indeed, following
SDT (Ryan & Deci, 2017), the satisfaction of the needs for autonomy, competence, and
relatedness (i.e., BPNS) is one of the most powerful motivational forces, giving workers the
vital energy they need to engage in behaviors such as helping colleagues at work [68].

Regarding the reverse link from OCBs to happiness, our results show that OCBs seem
to predict more strongly BPNS (eudaimonic happiness; β = 0.08), then PERMA (ﬂourishing;
β = 0.05), and ﬁnally SWB (hedonic happiness; β = 0.05). These results tend to show that
OCBs predict more strongly eudaimonic than hedonic happiness. In fact, we think that
it might be arguable that the act of helping others is more related to the actualization of
human potentials, meaning, and self-realization (i.e., eudaimonia) than to the search for
pleasure and joy (i.e., hedonia).

These tendencies are theoretically interesting; however, they would need to be tested
more rigorously. They also open a new set of questions. For example, which conceptual-
ization of happiness better predicts OCBs and why? Do OCBs have a stronger effect on
hedonic or eudaimonic components of happiness? Future research may approach these
questions using more sophisticated models and analyses.

7.1. Theoretical and Practical Implications

The present research aims to extend the ﬁeld of POS theoretically and practically by
bringing new insights to academics and practitioners in this sphere. Indeed, we expect

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 6387

15 of 20

to contribute to the improvement of workers’ quality of life, as well as building healthier
and more resilient organizations [20], through a better understanding of the relationship
between happiness and prosociality within the workplace.

7.1.1. Theoretical Implications

Our results extend the study of the OCBs–happiness link in ﬁve important ways.
First, we conceptualized happiness from a broader perspective than in previous research
in the ﬁeld. By highlighting that happiness is a broad construct, we are promoting in-
sights to scholars interested in deepening the knowledge of the link between OCBs and
happiness. This could encourage the collaboration between OCBs and happiness scholars.
We see a tremendous potential for the mutual contribution of these two research areas
that can inform each other and go beyond the mere emotional aspects of well-being in
the workplace.

Second, happiness has been conceptualized as either an antecedent or a consequence
of OCBs. We tested the OCBs–happiness link and demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that it is
reciprocal for all happiness “conceptualizations”. Third, we extended previous research
mainly conducted in the Western world and Asia, by testing our hypotheses with data
from a Chilean sample. Chile presents several cultural aspects that differ from the countries
previously studied, hence contributing to the cross-cultural generalization of previous
ﬁndings. Fourth, as Bolino and Grant have stated [95] “one natural direction for future
research is to develop a comprehensive model of prosociality in organizations” (p. 647).
By studying the relationship between happiness and OCBs in more detail, we are con-
tributing in the direction of a more integrated theoretical approach to studying prosociality.
Because we showed that both constructs are mutually interconnected, it is difﬁcult to think
in a comprehensive model of OCBs without including the role of happiness.

Fifth, and ﬁnally, it has been suggested to keep inquiring about possible antecedents
and consequences of OCBs [5]. Indeed, it is extremely important to include factors that
have raised attention in the 21st century but have not “been comprehensively explored and
understood well in the current literature” of OCBs [5]. Some factors that were historically
ignored have been gaining more attention and relevance (e.g., RSE), and happiness is an
example. In fact, the study of the OCBs–happiness link is nascent [95], and its association
with OCBs deserves more attention. Further, our results contribute signiﬁcantly to the OCBs’
nomological network: happiness appears to be not only a cause, but also a consequence
of OCBs.

7.1.2. Practical Implications

Three practical contributions emerge from our research. First, our results strongly
encourage workers and organizations to attach higher importance to kindness, generosity,
and prosociality in the workplace (e.g., OCBs) in order to foster employees’ happiness,
but also companies’ sustainability and proﬁtability. In other words, “doing good feels
good”. Importantly, we provided robust evidence that performing OCBs not only increases
hedonic happiness, but also eudaimonic happiness and ﬂourishing.

Second, we also encourage employees and companies to attach high importance to
happiness in the work context. We showed that increments in any of the three conceptu-
alizations of happiness lead to higher OCBs, which in turn are associated not only with
workers’ wellness, but also with more desirable organizational outcomes (e.g., productivity,
customer satisfaction, job satisfaction, trust, etc.).

Third, companies and practitioners count now on a broader set of tools for fostering
OCBs through, for example, happiness programs. Our results show that intervention pro-
grams are not restricted only to promoting positive emotions/affect (hedonic happiness) in
order to make OCBs more likely. In fact, practitioners could also expand their interventions
toward increasing psychological needs satisfaction (eudaimonic happiness) as well as
toward meaning and engagement (key components of the ﬂourishing perspective) in order
to increase the consequent appearance of OCBs.

7.2. Limitations and Further Research

Some limitations of the current research must be noted. First, our measures were self-
reported, and shared method variance could potentially have inﬂated correlations among
constructs within each wave. However, self-reports of one’s experience are arguably the
most valid ways of measuring happiness. Additionally, a recent meta-analysis showed that
mean differences between self- and other- ratings of OCBs are quite small [96]. Importantly,
we also took several a priori precautions to mitigate common-method bias, such as using
construct-valid measurement scales, protecting respondent anonymity, and instructing the
participants that there were no right or wrong answers [97,98].

Second, although the prospective effects reported here through our CLPM substan-
tially strengthen the case for causal effects between OCBs and happiness, by providing
evidence of temporal precedence, they do not provide conclusive evidence for causality.
For example, unmeasured variables may be at play at work. Nonetheless, our longi-
tudinal design strongly improved our knowledge regarding the temporal link between
OCBs–happiness. Third, the pattern of results obtained may have been affected by the
time-lag chosen between waves. We tested a three-wave CLPM with one month between
waves. Future research should explore different time-lags and use intensive longitudinal
data analysis. Fourth, caution is needed about generalizing the ﬁndings from a Chilean
sample to other samples and research contexts. Further research needs to expand our
ﬁndings to other economic, social, and cultural contexts. Fifth, we only tested the direct
link between OCBs and happiness. It would be interesting for future research to assess
mediators and moderators. Sixth, although we found signiﬁcant reciprocal links between
OCBs and the three models of happiness, the effect sizes were small (see [99]). Nonetheless,
it is a standard issue when using CLPM. Indeed, in a standard CLPM, all constructs are
controlled by their stability path, which reduces signiﬁcantly the variance explained for
the construct itself.

Finally, as stated in the discussion, the potential different effect sizes for the link
between the three conceptualizations of happiness and OCBs (in both directions) could
only be discussed in terms of tendencies in our study. From a theoretical and a practical
perspective, it would be very informative to know if the differences observed here are
stable in future studies. We would not like to jump to the conclusion that the eudaimonic
perspective is a stronger predictor of OCBs until further evidence is found. Future research
should include designs that more speciﬁcally search for these differences in effect sizes.

Despite these limitations, we believe our research strengthens the knowledge regarding
the OCBs–happiness link by conducting an original longitudinal design and demonstrating
that the inclusion of the three conceptualizations of happiness makes our understanding of
this relationship richer and worthy of being pursued in future research endeavors.

8. Conclusions

The present research shows that, in the workplace, “doing good feels good” and
“feeling good leads to doing good”. Importantly, “doing good” (i.e., OCBs) leads to being
happier in terms of all its three conceptualizations: hedonic, eudaimonic, and ﬂourishing.
Additionally, “feeling good” in any sense (i.e., any kind of happiness) will foster “doing
good” (i.e., OCBs). Following this wordplay, it does not matter if you are “feeling good”
because of high positive emotions, high autonomy, or having more meaning in your life.
Any kind of happiness on its own, considering any of the psychological approaches covered
in this research, will favor prosocial behaviors in the workplace. This powerful virtuous
circle of prosociality and happiness might beneﬁt not only organizations’ proﬁtability, but
also the well-being and happiness of the “good soldiers” [6].
