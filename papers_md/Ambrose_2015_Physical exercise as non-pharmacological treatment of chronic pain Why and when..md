Abstract

Chronic pain broadly encompasses both objectively defined conditions and idiopathic conditions 
that lack physical findings. Despite variance in origin or pathogenesis, these conditions are 
similarly characterized by chronic pain, poor physical function, mobility limitations, depression, 
anxiety and sleep disturbance and are treated alone or in combination by pharmacologic and 
nonpharmacologic approaches, such as physical activity (aerobic conditioning, muscle 
strengthening, flexibility training and movement therapies). Physical activity improves general 
health, disease risk and progression of chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 
diabetes and obesity. When applied to chronic pain conditions within appropriate parameters 
(frequency, duration, intensity), physical activity significantly improves pain and related 
symptoms. For chronic pain, strict guidelines for physical activity are lacking, but frequent 
movement is preferable to sedentary behavior. This gives considerable freedom in prescribing 
physical activity treatments, which are most successful when tailored individually, progressed 
slowly and account for physical limitations, psychosocial needs and available resources.

Introduction

Chronic pain conditions can be identified as having an: 1) objective pathogenic, genetic, or 
biologic origin that explains symptom presentation, or 2) idiopathic source with unknown 
origin for the illness. The former includes arthritis (osteoarthritis [OA], rheumatoid arthritis 
[RA]), systemic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, connective tissue diseases, post-herpetic

neuralgia, and peripheral neuropathy, which are typically diagnosed via objective biologic or 
inflammatory markers, radiologic evidence or other identifiable tissue damage. Idiopathic 
conditions, which often rely on subjective patient report, include complex regional pain 
syndrome (CRPS), fibromyalgia (FM), chronic widespread pain (CWP), subsets of chronic 
low back pain (LBP), and chronic pelvic pain (CPP). These syndromes are defined by 
unremitting pain and may include secondary issues of fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive 
deficits and depression.(1) For this chapter, we will largely focus on arthritis and FM as 
prototypical chronic pain conditions of known and unknown origin, respectively. Both are 
incurable, challenging to treat, tend to have poor long-term prognosis and impose substantial 
economic burden on healthcare systems and society.

Chronic pain is a significant public health concern that differentially burdens vulnerable 
populations, such as the elderly, children, and ethnic/racial minorities, due to disparities in 
treatment and resources.(2) Recent estimates suggest that chronic pain affects 100 million 
people in the United States (US) and 1.5 billion people worldwide, figures that are steadily 
rising. (3, 4) In 2010, estimated annual costs related to chronic pain were $560-635 billion in 
combined medical costs, lost earnings, disability and lost productivity. (4) Arthritis, 
specifically, is the leading cause of disability in the US. Combined medical costs and lost 
earnings exceed $189 billion annually.(5) Arthritis is highly prevalent, affecting at least 22% 
of adults and nearly half of adults older than 65. Furthermore, 43.2% of those with arthritis 
have an arthritis-attributable activity limitation, (6) and 24-58% of adults with arthritis are 
physically inactive;(7-13) estimates may be low because they are primarily based on self-
report measures.

Physical inactivity is an added insult to chronic pain conditions; in fact, it may contribute to 
the rise in chronic diseases. World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) target insufficient physical activity as a leading risk factor for 
noncommunicable diseases and death worldwide.(14, 15) Physical inactivity or sedentary 
behavior is ubiquitous at all ages, rendering many chronic diseases once relegated to older 
populations increasingly common in younger age groups.(16, 17) Sedentary behavior is 
detrimental to health, physical function and health-related quality of life.(18-21) In a 
nationally representative study of 2286 adults 60+ years old, each additional daily hour of 
sedentary behavior resulted in a 46% greater odds of disability with activities of daily living, 
controlling for moderate-vigorous physical activity, socioeconomic factors and health 
conditions.(18) Results from this study and other studies of sedentary behavior (19-21) 
suggest that even bursts of moderate-vigorous physical activity may not negate the harms of 
long, continuous hours of sedentary behavior. Regular physical activity emerges as a 
significant tool for both primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease with the ability 
to mitigate symptoms and slow or stall disease progression.(15, 16)

Usual treatments for chronic pain conditions: Poor to modest efficacy

Evidence for the effect of exercise on disease pathogenesis for chronic pain is lacking, with 
current evidence largely focusing on symptomatology. With no cure for many chronic pain 
conditions, treatments address symptoms such as pain, reduced functional capacity, poor 
sleep, fatigue, joint immobility, cognitive dysfunction, depression and anxiety. Efficacy for

pharmacologic treatment varies widely among chronic pain conditions often dictated by 
etiology or idiopathy. For example, methotrexate significantly improves pain, swelling and 
disease progression in RA and other systemic inflammatory rheumatic disease.(22) For 
idiopathic chronic pain and FM, pharmacologic treatments often include non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], topical agents like capsaicin, anti-depressants (selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs], 
tricyclics) and anticonvulsants prescribed in doses known to improve pain.(23, 24) Opioids 
are also prescribed; however, they are generally unsatisfactory for chronic pain with little 
pain resolution and undesirable side effects, physiologic dependence and risk of addiction.
(25) The use of certain classes of pharmacologic treatments has remained fairly constant 
over time; however, in 2007, the anticonvulsant, pregabalin, became the first Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved drug for fibromyalgia followed by the SNRIs, duloxetine 
(2008) and milnacipran (2009). These approvals were momentous for recognizing and 
legitimizing fibromyalgia. In 2010, duloxetine was also FDA-approved for use in OA and 
chronic LBP. Despite this evolving landscape of drugs approved for chronic pain treatment, 
pain relief from these agents is generally modest; discontinuation or dropout from clinical 
trials is high when pain relief fails to outweigh adverse effects.(24, 26)

Non-pharmacological therapies, then, are an increasingly important component for chronic 
pain management. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a classic example, which uses behavior 
modification strategies to effectively reduce pain and fatigue, and improve sleep, overall 
physical function and coping. (27-29) Therapies once considered “alternative” such as 
acupuncture, mindfulness meditation, yoga and relaxation have become accepted forms of 
symptom management with clinical trials demonstrating efficacy for pain and physical 
function. (28, 30)

Physical activity is a well-documented, viable therapeutic modality for chronic pain 
conditions with beneficial effects on pain, sleep, cognitive function and physical function. 
(27, 30-32) Increasing evidence defines physical activity as beneficial for many chronic 
illnesses including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cancer.(16, 33) 
Physical activity tends to reduce the economic impact of chronic illness through 
improvements in overall well being, independence, and reduced healthcare seeking and 
workplace absenteeism.(34-36) Overall health benefits are undeniable, regardless of whether 
physical activity is accomplished via lower intensity (i.e., lower energy expenditure) 
exercise or activities of daily living, movement therapies (Tai Chi, Qigong, yoga), or higher 
intensity exercise associated with cardiovascular fitness gains. No single modality provides 
overwhelming symptom relief for chronic pain patients; rather, multimodal treatment 
regimens including pharmacological and nonpharmacological management strategies appear 
to be most effective.

Physical activity as treatment

Historical evidence for physical activity varies with the quality of randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs); however, the bottom line has consistently supported physical activity as a 
beneficial modality for chronic pain, physical function, sleep, cognitive function and overall 
health and disease risk modification.(37-46) Further, physical activity positively influences

quality of life, activities of daily living, emotional affect, overall physical function and 
independence. At the same time, physical activity reduces disability and risk of developing 
comorbid illnesses including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, 
osteoporosis and obesity.(15, 16) With moderate to vigorous intensity, physical activity is 
effective – arguably, required - for weight management,(15) which in turn, effectively 
minimizes excessive joint loading and joint pain.(47)

Several studies have explored the economic impact of physical activity on pain and arthritis. 
Supervised and community-based exercise programs requiring facilities, equipment and 
instructors can be costly and inaccessible logistically or financially for some patients, failing 
to provide outcomes substantially better than usual care for the costs incurred.(48-50) 
Alternatively, self-directed physical activity can be inexpensive, requiring minimal 
resources such as walking around one's neighborhood and home-based programs. The CDC 
aims to make community-based exercise more feasible, less costly, and more attainable with 
guidelines that promote implementation and user-friendly self-management education for 
clinicians and patients. (40, 51)

Meeting the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommendation of ≥ 150 
minutes of moderate-equivalent physical activity per week(52) is not associated with 
worsening radiographic, symptomatic knee OA; however, many physical activity RCTs for 
other chronic pain symptoms such as FM do not meet these guidelines.(53) Patients and 
practitioners alike seek clear guidance for the type of physical activity that is most beneficial 
for chronic pain without exacerbating symptoms; exercise approaches and considerations for 
the management of chronic pain conditions are discussed below.

Major Categories of Physical Activity

RCTs have compared a breadth of activity types and environments, including aquatic vs. 
land-based exercise, aerobic exercise, resistance training, and movement therapies.

Aerobic exercise has long been studied as a treatment for chronic pain. Aerobic exercise 
includes both land-based exercise, such as walking and stationary cycling, and aquatic 
exercise.(16, 28, 37, 56-58) Recent studies have defined the benefits achieved according to 
intensity of exercise. For purposes of chronic musculoskeletal pain, intensity refers to the 
amount of energy expended and does not imply joint loading or impact. Quite uniformly, 
low to moderate intensity exercise defined as 50-60% of maximum heart rate (maxHR) 
tends to improve chronic pain symptoms. Moderate to high-intensity activity defined as 
60-80% of maxHR, a level of intensity required to achieve cardiovascular fitness gains in 
the general population, has been shown to improve fitness in those patients with chronic 
pain who can tolerate this level of intensity. (15, 53, 59)

Strength training, defined as contracting muscles against resistance, can be accomplished 
using free weights, resistance machines, elastic bands, and resistance against water or one's 
own body weight. Strength training for FM and chronic pain is well-supported. (28, 37, 45, 
60-62) Recent studies have demonstrated more robustly that strength training is both safe 
and effective for a variety of chronic pain conditions.(61, 62) Land-based training appears to

yield greater strength gains than aquatic resistance training.(56) Further, strength training 
may also improve quality of life and emotional affect in this population.(63)

Flexibility training includes exercises to improve joint range of motion and reduce muscle 
stiffness. Flexibility training, alone, for treatment of chronic pain was modestly beneficial 
for pain with a greater impact on emotional affect.(60) Similar findings exist for studies in 
which flexibility is part of a larger exercise program that includes aerobic or strength 
training. In this multimodal context, flexibility training is efficacious for anxiety, depression 
and health-related quality of life. (43, 60)

Interest in the effects of movement therapies such as yoga, Tai Chi, and Qigong has gained 
momentum for chronic pain. Generally, movement therapies are performed at lower 
intensity and are safe and well tolerated in this population.(33, 39, 44, 64) In addition to pain 
and physical function, movement therapies improve balance, mobility, joint flexibility, 
depression and anxiety.(39, 44, 65)

Outcomes of physical activity

Pain

For most chronic pain patients, the goal of participating in physical activity is to reduce pain. 
Recent studies have shown that multimodal exercise programs that include a range of 
activity (aerobic, resistance, and flexibility exercises) are effective at significantly reducing 
pain in OA, FM, CLBP and RA.(38, 66, 67) In FM patients, low-moderate intensity warm-
water pool exercise performed twice per week had an immediate positive effect on pain that 
was sustained during the 12-week program.(68) Similarly, 12 weeks of Tai Chi performed 
twice weekly reduced FM pain.(39, 44) Strength training twice weekly resulted in 
significant improvements in pain in FM patients.(60) Eight weeks of yoga, including weekly 
2-hr supervised sessions plus home practice, improved pain in 22 FM patients.(65) While 
improvements in pain can be immediate, benefits are still notable after long-term follow up 
from 24 weeks(44) to 30 weeks.(43) When performed regularly, aerobic exercise may be as 
effective as NSAIDs for reducing pain.(40, 69) Combining physical activity with other non-
pharmacologic therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and self-management 
education for coping, socialization and adaptation may be an effective clinical strategy for 
pain reduction.(67, 70)

Physical function

For patients with chronic pain, improving physical function is nearly as important as 
improving pain. Physical function in FM has been found to be worse than that after 
congestive heart failure.(71) Similar to pain, a multimodal physical activity program 
including aerobic, strengthening and flexibility exercises will improve physical function 
significantly.(16, 43, 45, 67, 72-74) Movement therapies such as Tai Chi and yoga improve 
strength, balance and mobility as well as attenuate anxiety and depression, which in turn, 
yield improvements in physical function for patients with FM, OA and RA.(44, 65) 
Moderate- to high-intensity resistance training improve physical function with little risk of 
exacerbating pain or other adverse effects provided that patients follow a plan of regular 
activity with slow progression.(37, 41, 60) Kaleth et al.(41) allowed participants to self-

select activities meeting a MET-level for moderate to vigorous activity, and physical 
function improved significantly.

Sleep and fatigue

Sleep disturbance and fatigue are common symptoms for individuals with chronic pain 
conditions. FM patients frequently report non-restorative sleep as the fourth most common 
complaint behind pain, fatigue and health-related quality of life.(75) Patients specifically 
identify poor sleep quality and quantity (difficulty falling asleep, getting comfortable, and 
staying asleep); restlessness; not feeling rested upon awakening; and difficulty starting the 
day.(75, 76) Poor sleep exacerbates the pain, stiffness, fatigue, and attention deficits that FM 
patients experience.(76) Interestingly, disruptions in both sleep and exercise can also have 
deleterious effects on pain and mood in healthy individuals, suggesting the importance of 
maintaining regular habits.(77) Twelve weeks of twice weekly Tai Chi significantly 
improved sleep in FM patients.(39) A meta-analysis of RCTs for movement therapies noted 
significant improvements in sleep in 372 FM subjects.(30) While evidence shows that 
engaging in physical activity improves sleep, the effect is reciprocal. In the absence of an 
intervention, 119 chronic pain patients naturally increased their physical activity on days 
that followed a night of higher quality sleep. (32) These findings emphasize the importance 
of improving or maintaining good sleep both for pain and for physical activity.

Depression, anxiety and mood

Depression and anxiety are common among chronic pain patients with 90% of FM patients 
reporting depressive symptoms over their lifetime.(78-80) Further, 86% of FM patients have 
been diagnosed with major depressive disorder during their lifetime.(80) Poor muscle 
strength, a sign of inactivity, is associated with depression, anxiety and reduced health-
related quality of life.(63) Depression can challenge adherence to an exercise program 
especially when social or psychological support is lacking.(81) Physical activity is 
commonly accepted to elevate mood in the general population, and the effect extends to 
chronic pain patients. In a recent study of 158 FM patients, those who chose active pain 
management strategies also had significantly less depression than patients who did not 
engage in these strategies.(82) The elevated mood derived from physical activity tends to be 
well maintained with continued exercise and persists for up to six months of detraining.(43, 
57) A wide variety of activities appear to improve depression, including aerobic exercise,
(41, 81) muscle strengthening,(60) and movement therapies.(30, 44, 64, 65) Moving more 
may be sufficient to tip the scales toward a positive mood.

Inflammation and related outcomes

Individuals with chronic pain conditions may exhibit systemic inflammation as a result of 
their condition or due to comorbid diseases. Physical activity is known to mitigate cellular 
inflammation.(83, 84) A recent study in 2330 adults demonstrated that frequency of physical 
activity had a greater effect on systemic inflammation than volume of activity.(85) 
Specifically, total weekly accumulation of physical activity was a stronger predictor of 
lower C-reactive protein (CRP) levels than the number of days per week of ≥30min/day of 
physical activity. Following 4 months of twice weekly aquatic exercise, inflammatory 
profiles improved in FM patients as interleukin (IL)-6 increased while spontaneous release

of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) decreased.(74) By the end of 8 months, spontaneous 
production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines decreased, production of TNFα and 
IL-10 diminished, and circulating CRP decreased. These results support the importance of 
consistency of physical activity throughout the week. Among patients with peripheral 
neuropathy, aerobic exercise and movement therapy (e.g., Tai Chi) improved nerve function 
and reduced pain and sensory dysfunction.(33, 86) Given the cardiovascular disease risk in 
RA, improved microvascular and macrovascular function with aerobic exercise in RA 
patients is valuable.(87)

Exercise considerations for chronic pain conditions

In a review of 46 studies, Jones et al.(53) noted that the physical activity programs described 
in many chronic pain studies did not meet CDC and American College of Sports Medicine 
(ACSM) guidelines. Kelly et al.(46) deferred to the ACSM guidelines for older adults due to 
the lack of other specific guidance for chronic pain patients. A 2010 review of 35 RCTs for 
aerobic exercise in 2,494 FM patients yielded a recommendation for both water- and land-
based activity of low to moderate intensity, performed 2-3 times per week for at least 4 
weeks.(57) Many recent studies demonstrate significant improvements in pain, depression, 
anxiety and quality of life in chronic pain patients with low to moderate intensity exercise 
performed only 2-3 times per week.(41, 60, 64, 66, 69, 72, 88) However, acute strenuous 
bouts of aerobic and isometric exercise induce hyperalgesic effects in FM patients.(54, 55) 
Chronic pain patients may be more successful when they can self-select a lower exercise 
intensity than standard guidance suggests.(53) Chronic pain patients vary greatly in their 
abilities and limitations, goals and lifestyle, and appear to have greater success from 
guidance that is tailored to their specific needs, hindering the development of strict 
guidelines specific to chronic pain; nevertheless, daily activity should be encouraged, even if 
the intensity is low and duration is short.

Nonpharmacological treatments require patients to participate actively for an extended 
period of time, often a lifetime. Such adherence may require significant behavior change and 
can be difficult to accomplish; however, these activities are often the most empowering and 
yield the largest improvements in symptoms and overall quality of life.(58) Programs that 
begin with a low level of intensity and progress steadily tend not to exacerbate pain and 
stiffness and yield greater adherence, less attrition and overall improvement in quality of life 
and ability to complete activities of daily living.(53, 69) Evidence in LBP and knee OA 
suggests that treatment effects may increase with the number of exercise sessions performed 
and, in general, pain does not increase along with an increase in volume of activity.(38, 41) 
Thus, treatment design and approach are critical.

Exercise approaches for the management of chronic pain conditions

As mentioned above, a wide range of exercises are supported for reducing pain and 
improving physical function in patients with chronic pain conditions. For FM, RA, and OA 
pain management, effects from physical activity have been found to be largely comparable 
to those for simple analgesics and NSAIDs.(69, 88-90) Not only is exercise beneficial for

mild to moderate pain conditions, but those with severe pain may exhibit improved function 
and reduced pain with physical activity.(33, 91)

Physical activity should be recommended to all patients with chronic pain conditions. 
Avoidance of exercise during acute symptom flares may be tempting, but sedentary behavior 
may not reduce symptoms and may promote loss of strength, reduced range of motion, and 
physical limitations. (18-21, 38) Small amounts of activity confer reasonable to large 
benefits, especially in patients who transition from sedentary to active. Once active, 
continued improvements may plateau over time but maintenance of reduced pain-related 
symptoms and overall fitness is manageable with regular activity. Physical activity is 
generally safe with few adverse events reported in RCTs for chronic pain. Side effects are 
typically temporary and often avoidable with patient education and safe progression.

Optimal methods for supporting physical activity for patients with chronic pain conditions 
are not well-established, but the general consensus across medical and research communities 
is that movement, no matter how minimal in duration or intensity, is desirable. For patients 
with knee OA, some evidence supports exercise programs of 12+ visits with direct 
supervision. (89, 90) This level of supervision is often not available or feasible, plus some 
individuals prefer physical activities that can be done independently. When encouraging 
physical activity, providers should consider the patient's exercise interests and activity 
modifications. Frequency of physical activity is critical, especially for reducing overall 
sedentary behavior. To promote ongoing activity and a lifestyle change, patients may be 
more likely to pursue activities that they enjoyed in the past or new and exciting activities. 
With appropriate modifications, most forms of physical activity are acceptable for people 
with chronic pain conditions. Important considerations for tailoring a physical activity or 
exercise program include: 1) safety precautions to reduce risk of falls and injuries, 2) proper 
posture and body mechanics to reduce abnormal or excessive joint loading, 3) performance 
of exercise within a range of motion that does not increase pain or increase risk of joint 
instability or loss of balance, and 4) adherence to a “start low, go slow” plan of progression 
to minimize hyperalgesic effects of “over-doing it.”

Overcoming barriers and reaching success

Psychosocial issues compound patients' efforts to adopt and maintain physical activity and 
to achieve successful outcomes. Fear-avoidance beliefs and behaviors are known barriers to 
increasing activity and can predict functional capacity and disability.(92, 93) Fear of falling 
contributes to sedentary behavior in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain,(94) and fear 
of increased pain and post-exertional malaise are significant barriers to activity among 
patients with FM and chronic fatigue syndrome.(95-97)

Chronic pain patients vary in self-efficacy (i.e., belief in own ability to complete tasks or 
reach a goal). Inadequate self-efficacy for exercise may be a considerable barrier to 
increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary time. In 41 patients with RA, physical

Summary

adherence and individual tailoring of exercise programs to promote exercise self-efficacy 
and exercise maintenance. (99)

Individually or in combination, pain, poor sleep, depression, anxiety, fear-avoidance beliefs, 
poor self-efficacy for activity can negatively impact motivation. Tailoring exercise may 
significantly contribute to patients' motivation, self-efficacy and adherence. Celebrating 
patients' “success”, symptom reduction, modeling from other successful patients, education 
on motivation techniques, and verbal encouragement through motivational interviewing are 
strategies that improve self-efficacy and motivation for exercise. (28)

Research exploring the impact of physical activity on chronic pain has grown significantly 
over the last 25 years with several recurring findings and limitations. Despite studies of 
varying quality, results consistently support the benefits of physical activity for treatment of 
chronic pain, both alone and as part of a multimodal program with pharmacotherapy and 
cognitive behavioral therapy. The impact of exercise on illness progression is largely 
unknown. Unfortunately, chronic pain-specific recommendations to guide patients and 
providers on measurable parameters (time, intensity, and frequency) are lacking. While 
guidelines offer a dual perception of legitimacy and comfort in prescribing exercise, chronic 
pain patients tend to be most successful when physical activity is tailored to their needs and 
limitations. Any amount or type of movement is advantageous over sedentary behavior, 
allowing for significant latitude in prescribing activity. Engaging chronic pain patients in a 
lifetime of physical activity to improve their pain, physical function, and quality of life is a 
classic illustration of the art and science of medicine.

Practice points

•

•

•

Understand predominant symptoms of various chronic pain conditions to 
discern similarities, differences and comorbidities.

Review existing physical activity guidelines for healthy adults and older adults 
to improve understanding of general parameters for prescribing physical 
activity.

Tailor physical activity to the specific needs and limitations of each chronic pain 
patient with consideration given to patients' physical abilities, emotional needs 
and barriers, personal interests, available resources and socioeconomic status.

• Multimodal therapy, including physical activity, pharmacotherapy, cognitive 

behavioral therapy, and self-management education, may be most effective for 
chronic pain management.
