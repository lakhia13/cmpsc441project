The American College of Physicians (ACP) recently identi-
fied cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as
the first-line treatment for insomnia. Although CBT-I
improves sleep outcomes and reduces the risks associat-
ed with reliance on hypnotics, patients are rarely referred
to this treatment, especially in primary care where most
insomnia treatment is provided. We reviewed the evidence
about barriers to CBT-I referrals and efforts to increase
the use of CBT-I services. PubMed, PsycINFO, and
Embase were searched on January 11, 2018; additional
titles were added based on a review of bibliographies and
expert opinion and 51 articles were included in the results
of this narrative review. Implementation research testing
specific interventions to increase routine and sustained
use of CBT-I was lacking. Most research focused on pre-
implementation work that revealed the complexity of de-
livering CBT-I in routine healthcare settings due to three
distinct categories of barriers. First, system barriers re-
sult in limited access to CBT-I and behavioral sleep med-
icine (BSM) providers. Second, primary care providers are
not adequately screening for sleep issues and referring
appropriately due to a lack of knowledge, treatment
beliefs, and a lack of motivation to assess and treat in-
somnia. Finally, patient barriers, including a lack of
knowledge, treatment beliefs, and limited access, prevent
patients from engaging in CBT-I. These findings are orga-
nized using a conceptual model to represent the many
challenges inherent in providing guideline-concordant in-
somnia care. We conclude with an agenda for future im-
plementation research to systematically address these
challenges.

INTRODUCTION

Insomnia is a common and debilitating public health concern
that affects nearly 25% of the general population, with eco-
nomic costs exceeding $100 billion USD per year in poor
workplace performance and health care utilization.1,2 Insom-
nia exacts a great personal cost as well, impairing cognitive,
physical, and emotional functioning and greatly reducing
quality of life.3 The American College of Physicians (ACP)
guidelines for management of chronic insomnia recommend
that all patients receive cognitive behavioral therapy for in-
somnia (CBT-I) as the initial treatment, yet patients are rarely
referred to this treatment.4–6 CBT-I is an evidence-based psy-
chotherapy that employs behavioral interventions to regularize
sleep cycles and cognitive interventions to address maladap-
tive thoughts about sleep, reducing the needs and hazards of
excessive reliance on hypnotics. The purpose of this review is
to explore the gap between guideline recommendations and
practice, with the goal of increasing CBT-I access and utiliza-
tion. As shown in Figure 1, we review pre-implementation
studies identifying barriers to CBT-I referrals and implemen-
tation studies aiming to increase the use of CBT-I services
using implementation interventions (methods designed to en-
hance adoption of a clinical treatment).7–9

Two previous reviews have focused on barriers for imple-
mentation of CBT-I.6,10 Cheung et al.10 reviewed the role of
patient perceptions of insomnia treatment, but did not discuss
provider- and system-level variables. Araujo et al.6 reviewed
patient and provider barriers to CBT-I uptake, but limited their
review to qualitative studies. This review extends the depth and
breadth of this previous work by including pre-implementation
and implementation work at system, provider, and patient lev-
els. We develop a conceptual model representing multi-level
barriers to implementing CBT-I, concluding with a discussion
of promising future directions for implementation work.

METHODS

We collaborated with a biomedical librarian to conduct a
search in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase for articles per-
taining to CBT-I implementation and barriers to use experi-
enced by physicians and patients. Searches began with the

year of comprehensive indexing in each database, 1946, 1806,
and 1947, respectively, to January 11, 2018. The search in-
cluded all publication types (full search strategy is presented in
the online appendix in the ESM). Inclusion criteria included
studies written in English which focused on implementation
and dissemination of CBT-I and patient and provider
knowledge/beliefs about CBT-I. Additional articles were in-
cluded based on review of the bibliographies of selected
articles (3) and expert opinion (16). Investigators reviewed
titles and abstracts of the 2625 articles and selected those that
met the inclusion criteria listed above. A total of 2545 articles
were deemed out of scope (see online appendix in the ESM for
reasons). The remaining 80 articles were reviewed for rele-
vance to CBT-I implementation, with 51 cited in the qualita-
tive synthesis below.

RESULTS

Research on CBT-I implementation is extremely limited and
most studies are confined to pre-implementation work within
primary care settings. The most robust evidence was for three
distinct barriers to CBT-I utilization: (1) system barriers result-
ing in limited access to CBT-I referral resources, (2) clinician
barriers resulting in underutilization of CBT-I services, and (3)
patient barriers resulting in under-engagement with CBT-I.

System Barriers

Following ACP guidelines, several commentaries cited limit-
ed access to CBT-I providers as a key system barrier to
guideline-concordant care.11,12 Demand for CBT-I providers

drastically exceeds supply. A recent survey identified just 752
CBT-I specialists worldwide, 88% of whom are unequally
distributed across the USA.13 Access barriers have been ex-
plored thoroughly in the US Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA), where the gap between supply and demand for CBT-I is
particularly pronounced. Veterans are one of the most vulner-
able groups for developing insomnia, with an estimated 90%
reporting sleep disturbances and nearly half above clinical
cutoffs for insomnia.14–16 Based on rapidly increasing insom-
nia prevalence in the VA, an estimated half million veterans
already diagnosed with insomnia would likely significantly
benefit from CBT-I by the year 2020, with potentially
hundreds of thousands more undiagnosed veterans who would
also benefit.17–19

Despite the demonstrated need, resources for the evaluation
and treatment of sleep disorders within the VA system are
extremely limited. The 2012 VA sleep inventory revealed only
112 physician and psychologist full-time employment equiv-
alents across all VA sleep medicine programs.19 VA sleep
medicine clinics, where available, are often overwhelmed with
assessment and diagnosis of sleep apnea, a condition that has
increased in prevalence with increasing rates of obesity.18
Only half of VA sleep medicine programs had access to
CBT-I resources in 2012, rendered primarily by employees
who did not have full-time employment equivalent allocated
to sleep.19

Access problems in the VA are partially addressed by
ongoing CBT-I rollout training.20 To date, approximately
700–800 clinicians have been trained as part of the rollout,
primarily providing CBT-I outside of sleep medicine programs
in behavioral/mental health and primary care; however, it is

JGIM

957

unknown how many CBT-I-trained providers continue to
practice or how many veterans they treat. Most providers are
psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health nurses, and social
workers and predominantly focus their clinical time treating
other mental health conditions. Long-term sustainability and
maintenance of treatment fidelity is unknown.20

Clinician Barriers

Research has identified three key clinician barriers leading to
underutilization of CBT-I services: lack of knowledge, treat-
ment beliefs, and lack of motivation. In marked contrast to
ACP guidelines, the most commonly used treatments remain
hypnotic medications and sleep hygiene, a psycho-education
approach with insufficient evidence as a stand-alone treatment
for chronic insomnia (e.g., avoid stimulants near bedtime,
keep bedroom dark and quiet).4,6,21,22 In an online survey with
international general health practitioners, the most commonly
used sleep treatments were sleep hygiene (88%), pharmaco-
therapy (63%), and relaxation therapy (44%), and 80% of
providers incorrectly believed that sleep hygiene was an effi-
cacious monotherapy.23 A survey study with physicians at
university medical centers in the USA demonstrated that less
than 10% of patients with a likely diagnosis of insomnia are
referred to CBT-I.24 In a survey with VA primary care pro-
viders who worked in medical centers with access to CBT-I,
only 29% reported utilizing CBT-I to treat insomnia.25 In
contrast, over 70% of these providers depended on medica-
tions and sleep hygiene.

A common theme in studies with clinicians is that they lack
familiarity with CBT-I treatment components and are unsure
of the effectiveness.4,6,25–30 In a survey study with Belgian
family physicians, only 35% indicated that their knowledge of
nonpharmacologic approaches to insomnia was sufficient.30
This finding was replicated in a VA survey study in which
82% of primary care providers had some familiarity with
CBT-I, but only 10% had a good understanding and use it in
their practice.25 Understandably, clinicians are reluctant to
refer to a treatment they do not understand, particularly when
they are unsure about the effectiveness of the treatment.31
Moreover, these knowledge gaps make it difficult for primary
care clinicians to describe the treatment to patients in a com-
pelling manner. Clinicians are also unsure about referral path-
ways and how to access CBT-I services.4,27 In the VA, 43% of
primary care providers did not know that CBT-I was an
available service in their facility.25

A second clinician barrier is treatment beliefs about the
utility and acceptability of CBT-I. Traditionally, insomnia
has been conceptualized as a symptom rather than a disorder.
Many clinicians prioritize treatment of anxiety, depression,
pain, or other conditions over insomnia. In a semi-structured
interview study with Australian general practitioners, 54%
indicated that they treat underlying causes of insomnia first.32
Similarly, a survey study in VA primary care settings shows
that clinicians believe that insomnia will resolve sometimes

(49%) or often (45%) following treatment of depression and
PTSD.25 This barrier stems from a lack of knowledge of
insomnia etiology and how it progresses to a chronic disorder.
Current diagnostic taxonomies have moved away from classi-
fying insomnia as a secondary disorder since insomnia fre-
quently becomes an independent condition maintained by
perpetuating compensatory behaviors and beliefs.33,34

Qualitative studies have shown that even if clinicians think
CBT-I would be helpful, they often mistakenly believe that
patients would be reluctant to engage and would prefer a medi-
cation quick fix.6 A survey study with Australian general practi-
tioners indicated that the most commonly endorsed barrier to
using nonpharmacological treatment for insomnia were patients
wanting/expecting medication (31%), followed by non-
compliance due to the effort required for nonpharmacological
treatment (21%).27 Similarly, 39% of general practitioners in a
UK survey study indicated that patient demand is the reason they
use pharmacological treatments for insomnia35 and 49% of Bel-
gian family physicians indicated that it is too difficult to motivate
patients for nonpharmacological treatment for insomnia.30

These clinician beliefs are not supported by research. Al-
though patients acknowledge the appeal of a Bmagic bullet^ to
treat insomnia, they are well aware of the limitations of med-
ications.10,36,37 Patients with insomnia perceive nonpharma-
cological approaches like CBT-I as healthier and preferable to
medications for managing insomnia over the long-term.6,27,38–
42 In a Norwegian epidemiological study, 80% of respondents
who had used sleeping medication indicated that they would
prefer nonpharmacological treatment, but only 10% had been
offered it.38 Even patients who are already taking hypnotics
for insomnia express openness to alternative nonpharmaco-
logical treatments.43

A final clinician barrier is a lack of motivation to assess and
treat insomnia. Surveys with primary care clinicians suggest
that diagnosis and management of insomnia is a low priority
compared to other health conditions. One survey in an Aus-
tralian primary care setting found 83% of clinicians do not
proactively assess insomnia, believing patients will raise the
issue themselves if they have sleep problems;32 however,
nearly 70% of patients with insomnia never discuss their sleep
problems with their clinicians.44 Even when patients ask for
insomnia treatment, they may not get it. In a UK survey study,
nearly 25% of patients with insomnia indicated that they spoke
with their doctor about their sleep problem but that their
clinician did not seem to think anything could be done about
it.45 Qualitative research has shown that most patients learn
about CBT-I through extensive research on their own rather
than mainstream health services and have to explicitly raise the
issue of referral to CBT-I during appointments.36 Clinicians
may also be more likely to defer to mental health, especially if
they incorrectly believe that insomnia is a symptom of PTSD
or depression rather than an independent condition that needs
targeted treatment.25

Finally, qualitative interviews with US internal medicine
physicians at a university medical center suggested that

958

Koffel et al.: Increasing access and utilization

JGIM

clinicians may be more likely to prescribe medications to ensure
that Bthe really important business of the clinic visit^ takes
place, rather than taking time to discuss nonpharmacological
options.46 Insomnia is seen as less urgent than other medical
symptoms, perhaps due to underestimating the adverse health
consequences of poor sleep.6 It is likely that the lack of moti-
vation to properly assess insomnia is related to other barriers
discussed above, including limited time, a lack of knowledge
about insomnia and nonpharmacological treatments, and insuf-
ficient access or knowledge about referral resources.

Patient Barriers

Research has identified several key barriers that prevent
patients from engaging with CBT-I, namely knowledge,
beliefs, and access. As few as 5% of patients will seek sleep
treatment.44 A lack of knowledge or awareness about non-
pharmacological treatment options and their effectiveness is
one of the top barriers. For example, a survey study with
people with insomnia in the UK indicated that 52% of partic-
ipants did not seek treatment since they thought sleeping pills
were the only treatment.45 The most common category of not
seeking treatment was the belief that their sleep problems were
benign, trivial, or something they felt they should be able to
cope with alone (57%).45

Other practical barriers related to access contribute to a
reluctance for patients to seek care and engage with CBT-I.
One survey study in the UK reported that patients identify
times constraints as a significant barrier to seeking insomnia
treatment (35%).45 Veterans with insomnia have indicated a
preference for Beasy^ insomnia treatments that accommodate
their busy lives; standard CBT-I, delivered over 4–6 weekly or
bi-weekly hour-long sessions, may not be feasible for many.47
Additionally, long wait times to get into treatment, as well as
long distances to travel, may deter patients from engaging in
CBT-I.48 Arranging for child or elder care and requiring ap-
pointment times before or after work can further complicate
engagement with treatment. Finally, for those with access to
care, changing sleep habits and schedules, key aspects of CBT-
I, is hard work and far more challenging than taking a pill.11
Qualitative research with patients involved in CBT-I has high-
lighted the degree of effort and self-discipline needed to fully
commit to the therapy.49–51 Up to 40% of patients prematurely
drop out of CBT-I in clinical practice,52 and consistent adher-
ence to treatment recommendations generally falls around 47–
52%.53–55 Fortunately, an appreciable number of patients who
complete treatment benefit, with 70–80% experiencing signif-
icant improvements in sleep.56–58

DISCUSSION

Increasing delivery of CBT-I to patients in real-world settings
requires a thoughtful and systematic program of research to
develop and test implementation interventions at multiple
levels. We present a conceptual model in Figure 2 as a

framework for this research, drawing from previous work,
including Cabana et al.’s conceptual model of barriers to
physician adherence to practice guidelines and Anthierens
et al.’s multi-level model of barriers to nonpharmacological
treatment of stress, anxiety, and insomnia.30,59 Our model
highlights promising intervention targets for future implemen-
tation work, which are discussed in more detail below.

Enhancing Knowledge and Beliefs

Clinicians have clearly expressed a desire for improved edu-
cation about insomnia treatment;4,26 knowledge gaps that
could be targeted with educational interventions include the
development and maintenance of insomnia, adverse health
and functional outcomes associated with insomnia, CBT-I
effectiveness, and patient preference for CBT-I, as well as
ways to convincingly sell this treatment to patients. It is
recommended that education, both early in the training process
(e.g., medical school, residency) and throughout the career
(e.g., conferences workshops), is crucial for instigating and
sustaining change in healthcare systems.60

Some early work has been done in this area. For example,
137 general practitioners in Australia were randomized to
receive a 15-min educational intervention in which a doctor
or pharmacist visited during office hours to provide education
and patient materials pertaining to nonpharmacological treat-
ment of insomnia.61 This significantly reduced the percentage
of benzodiazepine prescriptions for newly diagnosed insomnia
over the 7-month follow up (85 to 48%).62 Similarly, a prom-
ising pilot program within the VA delivers sleep medicine
education to rural primary care providers using video-
teleconferencing technology.63 This program involves 10
stand-alone 1-h sessions delivered by specialists in sleep,
psychology, and pharmacy, and 80% of participants reported
increased comfort with the use of nonpharmacological man-
agement for insomnia, although they also identified schedul-
ing conflicts and a lack of protected time as substantial partic-
ipation barriers.

We are currently developing a social marketing campaign to
increase knowledge and positive beliefs/attitudes about CBT-
I. This approach goes beyond providing educational materials
by focusing on strategic marketing of messages to a target
audience.64 We anticipate that informational materials for
primary care providers will include best practice guidelines,
referral information for CBT-I, and recommended talking
points for describing CBT-I to patients, presented at monthly
clinic meetings. We are also considering CBT-I Bchampions^
within primary care to answer questions about CBT-I and
provide feedback about patients who benefit from CBT-I.

Patient education will be an important counterpoint to these
clinician-focused efforts, including efforts to reduce the stigma
of discussing insomnia with a provider and making informa-
tion about the effectiveness of CBT-I easily accessible. There
is evidence from a preliminary study with 40 primary care
patients in Canada that educational brochures about the harms

JGIM

and hazards of hypnotics provided in outpatient waiting rooms
significantly improve knowledge, with 45% of patients
intending to discuss low-value hypnotic care with their clini-
cians after reading these brochures.65 Additional work is
needed to develop and test targeted educational interventions
for patients with chronic use of hypnotics, such as online
videos with Bexpert patients^ who have benefited from CBT-
I or pamphlets provided through mail or in-person at clinic
appointments discussing the benefits of CBT-I vs. hypnotics.
This education is necessary to counteract pervasive advertis-
ing by pharmaceutical companies and the compelling but
unrealistic desire for a Bmagic bullet^ to improve sleep.46,66

Increasing CBT-I Access

Research has demonstrated a vast gap between supply of CBT-
I providers and demand for CBT-I providers; lessons learned
during national efforts by the VA to train CBT-I providers can
be applied to other healthcare settings. For example, partici-
pant feedback during this training was used to extend the
training workshop (3 vs. 1.5 days) and increase the focus on
implementing CBT-I for patients with medical and mental
health comorbidities, as well as the development of virtual
office hours to provide continued consultation and support for

newly trained CBT-I providers.20 Program materials, includ-
ing competency rating scales and patient materials developed
during this initiative, can be used and adapted in future dis-
semination programs.

Stepped-care models, where different levels of care can be
delivered in different settings (e.g., mild to moderate insomnia
in primary care, severe comorbid insomnia in specialty mental
health) will help those with insomnia get the appropriate level
of care by the appropriate provider.67 In order to implement
stepped-care models, the VA and other healthcare systems also
need to increase access not only to CBT-I providers, but to
professionals with expertise in behavioral sleep medicine
(BSM) more broadly. These professionals, often psychologists
with further specialized training, are a valuable resource for
both CBT-I providers and primary care clinicians to help
manage patients with more complex comorbidities for whom
CBT-I may be contraindicated and for whom other evidence-
based approaches are needed (e.g., circadian rhythm disorder,
shift work disorder, seizure disorder, traumatic brain injury,
bipolar disorder, poorly-managed sleep apnea).

Increased access to CBT-I can also enhance clinician moti-
vation to assess, diagnose, and refer for treatment of insomnia.
Simple insomnia screening tools are available, although they

960

JGIM

are not yet widely integrated into routine clinical care.7 The
Insomnia Severity Index, a 7-item patient reported outcome
measure, could identify potentially appropriate candidates for
CBT-I in primary care, using cut scores of 11 or higher.11,68,69
If brief insomnia screens are not feasible in busy primary care
settings, clinicians can defer to trained CBT-I providers to
assess patients with an insomnia or sleep complaint and help
make decisions about treatment.

Developing and Testing Alternative Delivery
Formats for CBT-I

Work is ongoing to develop and test alternative delivery for-
mats for CBT-I to increase access and minimize patient burden
and use of healthcare resources. For example, self-
management (i.e., self-help) approaches utilizing books,
web-based programs, and mobile applications allow patients
to stay at home, eliminating both transportation and time
barriers.45,70 These approaches also partially address the prob-
lem of too few trained CBT-I providers, although qualitative
interviews with patients suggest that they prefer to have some
form of contact with a CBT-I provider.70 Developing alterna-
tive delivery formats for CBT-I may also enhance adherence
and improve outcomes, increasing the use of CBT-I by
patients and providers. Meta-analyses have found that self-
management CBT-I approaches to treating insomnia are effi-
cacious compared to inactive control,71,72 but few studies have
compared these approaches to standard CBT-I.

Telephone-delivered CBT-I is a promising approach that
minimizes practical barriers (e.g., travel) while providing the
desired contact with a trained CBT-I provider; a recent ran-
domized clinical trial demonstrated significant improvement
in sleep following a brief, telephone-based CBT-I relative to
an education control.73 Within the VA, video telehealth is
already used to provide CBT-I to veterans in rural areas, and
work is ongoing to develop mobile applications that can be
used independently and in conjunction with in-person CBT-I,
as well as self-management approaches for insomnia treatment
with telephone-based provider support.74–76 These treatments
are still in the pilot phase and comparative effectiveness rela-
tive to standard CBT-I is unknown.

In primary care settings, brief behavioral treatment for
insomnia (BBTI), group CBT-I, and classroom settings have
been investigated as a way to deliver the treatment to more
patients using fewer resources.77–79 A BBTI protocol with two
in-person sessions and two telephone sessions has demonstrat-
ed efficacy compared to control groups in veteran popula-
tions80,81 and is currently being directly compared to CBT-
I.82 Overall, there are a number of promising alternatives to
standard CBT-I that have demonstrated efficacy; it is now time
to move along the continuum toward effectiveness and imple-
mentation trials. Hybrid implementation-effectiveness trials
can be used to test the comparative effectiveness of different
CBT-I delivery methods under real-world conditions, while

simultaneously exploring barriers/facilitators to the uptake and
sustainability of these treatments in routine care settings.7,8

CONCLUSIONS

Primary care providers are ideally positioned to make referrals
to CBT-I as the first-line treatment for insomnia. Crucial next
steps will include developing and testing implementation
interventions, including targeted materials marketing CBT-I
to patients and providers. Additional efforts are needed in
community healthcare settings to adapt and implement exist-
ing training models, like those used in the VA, to increase
access to CBT-I providers. Although standard CBT-I is a
highly effective treatment, the capacity to delivery it cannot
begin to meet demand. Comparative effectiveness research
testing alternative delivery formats for CBT-I is a necessary
part of implementation and will also help establish stepped-
care models. Efforts to establish the sustained and routine use
of CBT-I will benefit clinicians and patients through the de-
livery of safe and effective insomnia care for the vast numbers
of patients struggling with insomnia.
