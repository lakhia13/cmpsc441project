Abstract

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have caused fear and anxiety worldwide
and imposed a significant physical and psychological burden on people, especially women
living with HIV (WLHIV). However, WLHIV were not studied as well as others during the pan-
demic. Hence, this study aimed to determine the relationships between COVID-19 phobia,
health anxiety, and social relations in WLHIV.

Materials and methods

This cross-sectional study enrolled 300 WLHIV who had records at the Iranian Research
Center for HIV/AIDS of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Data were collected using
sociodemographic questionnaire, the fear of COVID-19 scale, the social relations question-
naire, the socioeconomic status scale and the health anxiety inventory. Path-analysis was
used to assess the direct and indirct associations between variables.

Results

Based on the path analysis, among variables that had significant causal relationships with
social relations, socioeconomic status (β = -0.14) showed the greatest negative relationship,
and health anxiety (β = 0.11) had the strongest positive relationship on the direct path. On
the indirect path, fear of COVID-19 (β = 0.049) displayed the greatest positive relationship.
The level of education (β = 0.29) was the only variable showing a significant positive rela-
tionship with social relations on both direct and indirect paths.

Corona phobia, anxiety, and social relations in women living with HIV

Conclusion

Our result showed that increased fear and health anxiety related to a higher social relations
score in WLHIV. Hence, due to their vulnerability, these people require more support and
education to adhere to health protocols in future pandemics and similar situations.

1. Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the psychological status of many people [1]. Based on
the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) report, people are, directly and indirectly,
impacted by stressful experiences in this period; and their most prevalent responses to these
stressful experiences include fear (of illness, death, loss of livelihood, social isolation, and being
quarantined) and fear-related behaviours, e.g., limited social relations, distance from treatment
centers (fear of going to a health facility), health anxiety, depression, and stress [2].

Fear is an adaptive feeling needed to cope with potential threats, but excessive fear has nega-

tive impacts on the personal (mental health issues and anxiety disorders) and social levels
(seclusion, isolation, xenophobia) [3]. Researchers have discussed the pathological fear of
COVID-19 (COVID-19 phobia) due to the nature and wide-ranging impacts of the pandemic
[4].

Various factors may affect the degree of psychological vulnerability to COVID-19 phobia,
including personal variables such as tolerance, lack of trust, vulnerability to the diseases, anxi-
ety, and concerns [4]. Reports suggest that older adults and those with underlying diseases,
including HIV, are at greater risk [5]. Hence it seems that the COVID-19 pandemic imposes a
more significant physical and psychological burden on women living with HIV (WLHIV) [6,
7], as WLHIV have severe early death anxiety, different disease-related fears, and mental dis-
turbances ranging from indifference and hopelessness to severe reactions such as anxiety and
depressive disorders [8].

Health anxiety is a wide-ranging cognitive disorder formed by incorrect perceptions
regarding physical changes and symptoms resulting from one’s beliefs about illness or health
[9]. Some researchers say severe health anxiety can arise from COVID-19 phobia [4]. Almost
everyone has experienced some degree of health anxiety, low levels of which are not pathologi-
cal but rather help people perform and commit to preventive behaviours. However, severe
degrees are associated with maladaptive coping behaviours leading to distress, social incompe-
tence (social disability), disrupted job performance, and having a fear of going to health centers
(even in situations when it is necessary) or having an obsession with going to the health centers
repeatedly without any necessity [10].

In social science, a social relation is any relationship between two or more individuals. Peo-
ple inherently need and thus create opportunities to experience social relations. Social relations
also affect mental health, health-related behaviours, and physical health. Studies show that
social relations have short- and long-term effects on health that emerge during childhood and
throughout one’s life [11].

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended
precautionary measures, including quarantine, limiting social relations by increasing physical
distance, wearing a mask when visiting others, and avoiding overcrowding [12]. Due to the
importance of this topic, the vulnerability of WLHIV, and the absence of a model examining
all the mentioned variables together, especially for this group, the current study aimed to
determine relationships among COVID-19 phobia, health anxiety, and social relations in
WLHIV via path analysis.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design

In this cross-sectional study, 300 WLHIV who had records at the Iranian Research Center for
HIV/AIDS affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences were included.

2.2. Study population

The sample size was calculated according to Maria Pizzirusso et al. [13] study, by considering
type I (α) and type II (β) errors of 0.05 and 0.2, respectively, and the correlation (r) of 0.16 for
social relations and anxiety, by using the following formula:

Total sample size [(Zα+Zβ)/C] 2 + 3
When C = 0.5 � ln [(1+r)/ (1-r)]
Inclusion criteria.

Iranian women with records at the Iranian research center for HIV/
AIDS of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, with minimum literacy, absence of mental
and physical problems (as reported by the patient/registered in their records) that would pre-
clude them from participation, and no history of psychotropic medications.

Exclusion criteria. Returning incomplete questionnaires, migration, and hospitalization

due to COVID-19.

2.3. Data collection and definition of terms

The data were collected via four questionnaires: The fear of COVID-19 scale [14]; The health
anxiety inventory [15]; the social relations questionnaire; the socioeconomic status (SES) scale
[16]; as well as a sociodemographic information checklist.

2.3.1. The fear of COVID-19 scale. Pakpour, Griffiths, et al. developed the fear of
COVID-19 scale in 2020 with seven items. 1-I am most afraid of COVID-19. 2-It makes me
uncomfortable to think about COVID-19. 3-My hands become clammy when I think about
COVID-19. 4-I am afraid of losing my life because of COVID-19. 5-When watching the news
and stories about COVID-19on social media, I become nervous or anxious.6-I cannot sleep
because I’m worried about getting COVID-19-19.7-My heart races or palpitates when I think
about getting COVID-19 [14]. The responses range from "strongly disagree" (1) to "strongly
agree" (5). All items’ scores yield a total score ranging from 7–35. The original version has a
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.82, test-retest coefficient of 0.88, and appropriate validity. In Iran, its
reliability was confirmed with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.86 [17]. The scale’s reliability was con-
firmed in the current study with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.84.

2.3.2. The health anxiety inventory. The health anxiety inventory was developed by Sal-
kovskis and Warwick (2002) with 18 items to measure health anxiety. Each question consists
of a group of four statements describing a person’s health or feelings about health and illness
over the past six months. There are no right or wrong answers. The questions are scored on a
four-point Likert scale (never = 0 to often = 3). Salkovskis reported the test-retest reliability of
0.90 and Cronbach’s alpha of 0.70–0.82 [15]. The Persian version of the inventory showed a
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.75, demonstrating optimal validity [18].

2.3.3. Social relations questionnaire. This questionnaire evaluates communication skills

and social functioning with others/community and consists of 11 items like "I don’t worry
about dealing with people, I have competence and ability in social affairs, I am interested in
joining a private group, I can be successful in verbal communication with others, Weak social
connections can be due to failures caused by the living environment and society", and it’s
scored on a five-point Likert scale from very low to very high (1–5). The score ranges from 11

to 55. Its reliability was confirmed with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.87 (Mousavi, 2013). The cur-
rent study confirmed its reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.89.

2.3.4. Socioeconomic status (SES) scale. SES consisted of 6 questions, including parental

education, income, economic class, and housing status, which are scored based on a Likert
scale from 1 to 5, and a total score ranging from 6 to 30. Validity and reliability was approved
in Iranwith a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.83 (2013) [16].

2.3.5. Socio-demographic checklist. Sociodemoghraphic characteristics including age,
duration of the disease, the number of children, having sex partners, education, and having
health insurance were collected via self-constructed checklist.

2.4. Procedure

The study began after obtaining the required permissions and approval from the Ethics Com-
mittee of Alborz University of Medical Sciences (IR.ABZUMS.REC.1400.022). The researchers
visiting the centre of the behavioural diseases who were identified as eligible participants were
briefed about the study’s objectives. The eligible participants signed a written informed con-
sent form if they were willing to participate. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to adhere to
distancing and minimal presence at the center, the questionnaires were sent to those who had
Internet access over the Pars Online platform, and they were requested to fill them out in one
week. For those who did not have Internet access, a separate room was allocated for filling out
the questionnaires. The respondents could ask their questions regarding questionnaire items
and resolve any ambiguities by phone for those who used the Internet and in person for those
who filled out the questionnaire in the center.

They were all ensured that their data would remain confidential, that participation was not

obligatory, and that they would not be deprived of any services if they did not participate.

2.5. Statistical analysis

This study examined the fitness of a conceptual model for the relationship between fear of
COVID-19, health anxiety, and social relations in WLHIV. Path analysis is an extension of
conventional regression that shows each variable’s direct and indirect effects on the dependent
variables. The results can be used to provide a rational interpretation of the relationships and
correlations observed. It can consider a causal modelling technique; it can be performed with
cross-sectional data [19]. Direct and indirect effects of independent variables included age,
education, child number, SES, partner number, health anxiety, COVID-19 phobia on social
relations was assessed using the path model. The results of path model was reported as stan-
dardized and unstandardized β coefficient. In the path model, the significance level was set at a
T-value >1.96.

Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess correlation between variables. P-value

less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Data were analyzed in SPSS-25 and
Lisrel-8.8.

3. Results

Demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1. The participants’ mean age was
39.4 ± 7.5 years. Mean (SD, minimum, maximum) of the health anxiety score, the fear of
COVID-19 score, and social relations score (35.1 ± 3.80) was 20.6 (7.3, 5,52), 22.4 (5.3,7,35)
and 35.1 (3.80, 26, 48) respectively.

Based on Pearson’s correlation analysis, among independen variables education had the
strongest significant positive correlation (r � 0.37), and the number of children displayed the
strongest significant negative correlation (r � -0.26) with social relations (Table 2).

Based on the path analysis, among variables with significant and causal relationships on the
direct path with social relations, socioeconomic status (β = -0.27) had a negative relationship,
while health anxiety (β = 0.75) and HIV duration(β = 0.51) had a positive relationship. In
other words, with a one-score increase in SES, the social relations score decreased, and with a
rise in the health anxiety score and duration of HIV, the social relations score increased. On
the indirect path, the fear of COVID-19 (β = 0.32) had a significant and positive relationship
with social relations; in other words, a rise in fear of COVID-19 score was associated with a

4. Discussion

This study explored the relationship between fear of COVID-19, health anxiety, and social
relations in WLHIV via path analysis. Among variables with significant causal relationships
with social relations, SES showed the greatest negative relationship, and health anxiety demon-
strated the greatest positive relationship on the direct path. Fear of COVID-19 showed the
greatest positive relationship on the indirect path. Level of education was the only variable that
had significant and positive relationships with social relations on both direct and indirect
paths.

SES had the highest negative relationship with social relations; the poorer the socioeco-
nomic status, the higher the social relations. Social relations means any relationship between
two or more individuals, such as emotional and practical support provided by significant oth-
ers [11]; in a special situation such as a pandemic, people with high SES decrease their relation-
ship with the community and keep their distance. On the contrary, other studies reported
fewer social relations in lower SES groups [20]. In another study, patients with HIV who had a
lower SES were poorer or had lower living standards and had fewer social relations than others
[21]. This difference in results can be attributed to the pandemic and differences among coun-
tries, as in our study, those with a higher SES were less in need of being in society to earn a liv-
ing or visit healthcare centres. These factors limit social relations, especially for WLHIV.

PLOS ONECorona phobia, anxiety, and social relations in women living with HIV

Our study revealed that health anxiety had the greatest positive relationship with social rela-

tions. The main element of health anxiety is worry about health and the fear of disease. Com-
monly, the symptoms of worry and anxiety, which include many bodily symptoms, are
misinterpreted as evidence of organic illness [22]. It causes great suffering for patients and
those around them and is costly in terms of greater use of medical care utilization. For exam-
ple, individuals suffering from health anxiety desperately seek to identify the physical causes of
their symptoms and will often consult several medical professionals. Evidence suggests that the
social costs of health anxiety are high. In undergraduates, health anxiety is linked to increased
doctor visits [23]. We found no similar study on patients with HIV regarding this subject.

Nonetheless, according to previous studies, a possible cause of this finding could be that

patients with more health anxiety visit healthcare centers more than others to check their
health status. In Covid -19 pandemic, to ensure the diagnosis, they visit different doctors to
make sure they are not infected with COVID-19 [9, 24], Which in turn may increase their
social relations. The physical signs and symptoms of health anxiety during the pandemic may
resemble the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 itself; in this case, people may mistake these
physical changes as symptoms of COVID-19. People with high health anxiety regard any phys-
ical change as a sign of a disease, which exacerbates their anxiety and concern, and leads to
repeated referrals [24].

People with severe immune deficiencies, such as HIV, face numerous side effects. They
may be exposed to severe COVID-19 and have a higher mortality risk due to its complications,
which can cause or exacerbate their stress and concern [25].

In the present study, fear of COVID-19 had the strongest positive relationship with social
relations through the indirect path. Fear of COVID-19 positively affected health anxiety and
thus increased the social relations of the patients. As noted before, WLHIV frequently visit
diagnostic and treatment centers due to concerns and fear of COVID-19 complications, which
increases their social relations [9, 24]. According to COVID-19 research and the media report,
fear of COVID-19 affected has increased and fear of infection has become a concern in the
context of the COVID-19 pandemic because it worsens emotion, cognition, and behavioral
responses [26]. Although fear is a common psychological outcome during the pandemic, it is
not limited to morbidity and mortality but may also emerge as social and occupational stress
due to the evolving nature of the disease, its prevalence, and its unique risk factors. COVID-19
phobia is a hyper-reactive fear of contracting COVID-19 with three physiologic, cognitive, and
behavioural components. Ongoing worry can induce symptoms such as tachycardia, tremor,
breathing difficulty, vertigo, a changed appetite, obsession, and affective responses (sadness,
guilt, anger). To prevent the consequences, people adopt avoidant behaviours that may disrupt
the overall quality of their daily functioning [27]. Studies show that the complications and
mortality caused by this disease are higher in people with chronic diseases, which induces or
exacerbates fear and anxiety in them [28, 29].

In the current study, level of education was the only variable that had significant and posi-

tive relationships with social relations on both direct and indirect paths. Likewise, Nojoomi
et al. showed that HIV-positive patients who were educated and employed had a better status
than other patients in most quality of life dimensions, especially mental health, social function-
ing, and environmental dimension [30]. Educated patients have a better attitude towards the
disease and are better adjusted to it due to their better occupational and financial opportunities
and high cultural status, which can expand their social relations, such as emotional and practi-
cal support provided by significant others and leads to a better quality of life. Studies show that
people with a higher level of education run a longer and healthier life compared to people of
the same age but with a lower level of education [11, 31].

PLOS ONECorona phobia, anxiety, and social relations in women living with HIV

Contrary to our study, a study in China demonstrated no significant relationship between
the social relations of patients with HIV and their level of education [32]. Cultural differences,
economic conditions, and living standards could explain these differences.

This study had some limitations. One of them was the time in which the survey was con-
ducted (during the COVID-19 pandemic); when adhering to social distancing and limiting
social relations was necessary. In addition, this study didn’t evaluate the patients’ comorbidi-
ties, and used questionnaires for data recording. Nonetheless, due to the use of Path analysis
based on multiple regression techniques, all confounders were adjusted so that they would not
affect the reults.

5. Conclusion

According to our result, increased fear, health anxiety score and the duration of HIV, related
to a higher score of social relations. Based on their vulnerability, WLHIV requires more sup-
port and need proper education to adhere to health protocols in future pandemics and similar
situations.
