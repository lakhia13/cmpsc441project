Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
is an effective non-pharmacologic
treatment for veterans with PTSD. Extensive work has identiﬁed epigenetic factors
related to PTSD disease risk and pathophysiology, but how these factors inﬂuence
treatment response is unclear. Serotonin signaling and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis functioning may be perturbed in PTSD and are molecular pathways targeted
by PTSD treatments. To identify potential biomarkers for treatment response, we utilized
genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples from veterans with PTSD who were
responders (n = 11) or non-responders (n = 11) to MBSR as part of a clinical trial. We
assessed methylation levels at CpG sites in regions of the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4)
previously associated with expression and depression outcomes, as well as the Intron 7
region of the FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) containing known glucocorticoid response
elements suggested to regulate this gene. Selected subjects were matched across
MBSR responder status by baseline symptoms, age, sex, current smoking status, and
current antidepressant use. Percent methylation was compared between responders
and non-responders at baseline (pre-MBSR treatment). Additionally, percent change
in methylation from baseline to post-treatment was compared between responders
and non-responders. There was a signiﬁcant time x responder group interaction for
methylation in FKBP5 intron 7 bin 2 [F (1, 19) = 7.492, p = 0.013] whereby responders
had an increase in methylation and non-responders had a decrease in methylation from
before to after treatment in this region. Analyses of the three CpG sites within bin 2
revealed a signiﬁcant time x responder group interaction for CpG_35558513 [F (1, 19) =
5.551, p = 0.029] which resides in a known glucocorticoid response element (GRE).

with stress-related pathways at the molecular level. These preliminary ﬁndings suggest
that DNA methylation signatures within FKBP5 are potential
indicators of response to
meditation treatment in PTSD and require validation in larger cohorts.

INTRODUCTION

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition
with a lifetime prevalence of 8–19% in combat veterans (1,
2). High rates of chronicity, poor quality of life, and severe
functional impairments associated with PTSD result in ∼$3
billion of
lost productivity each year (3). Sadly, only 20–
30% of patients experience remission of PTSD symptoms from
pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment interventions
(4, 5). Extensive work has identiﬁed genetic and epigenetic
factors related to PTSD disease risk and pathophysiology, but
there remains a critical need to leverage this knowledge to
develop new treatments and also improve response to existing
therapies.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a meditation
approach to promote relaxation and achieve a heightened sense
of well-being (6) which has gained increasing evidence for
eﬃcacy in the treatment of PTSD (7–10). MBSR brings together
mindfulness meditation and yoga. Mindfulness cultivates a
greater awareness of the mind and body, unconscious thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors that can undermine emotional, physical,
and spiritual health. MBSR appears to be a viable treatment
option for PTSD, with a 49% response rate in a recent trial
of patients with long-standing and symptomatic illness who
had not experienced extensive relief with medications (9).
The exact mechanistic underpinnings of MBSR eﬃcacy are
not known. Reductions in markers of stress reactivity, such as
cortisol have been observed as a result of a mindfulness program
for PTSD (11), implicating eﬀects through the hypothalamic-
pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. Preliminary electroencephalogram

Genes involved with monoamine and HPA axis function have
been extensively examined in epigenetic and genetic studies
of PTSD risk, and separately in studies of disease risk and
response to treatments for mood disorders (14–17). Two of
the most commonly characterized genes in this regard are the
serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and FK506 binding protein 5
(FKBP5). SLC6A4 encodes the serotonin transporter (5HTT)
which regulates serotonin reuptake from the synaptic cleft.
Disruption of 5HTT function can be caused by epigenetic
modiﬁcation of the promoter region of this gene whereby
increased methylation decreases 5HTT expression (18). Altered
expression as a result of methylation may inﬂuence the likelihood
of an individual developing PTSD after traumatic events (19).
Additionally, hypomethylation of the serotonin transporter may
decrease response to antidepressant treatment for depression

(16). To date, relationships between SLC6A4 methylation and
response to treatments for PTSD have not been examined.

FKBP5 encodes the FK506 binding protein 5 which regulates
the glucocorticoid receptor complex through binding and
impeding its translocation to the nucleus (20). In this role,
FKBP5 serves as part of the negative feedback loop regulating
glucocorticoid activity and acute stress response. FKBP5 is
activated by glucocorticoid interactions with intronic regulatory
glucocorticoid response
(GREs) which increase
elements
transcription, and then feeds back to attenuate glucocorticoid
signaling. This acute regulation of stress response occurs through
a dynamic process of methylation/de-methylation (21–23).
Traumatic childhood exposures are thought to imprint long-
standing patterns of demethylation, resulting in chronically
dysregulated feedback and risk for PTSD (20). Preliminary
evidence in one small study suggests that FKBP5 methylation
patterns may change in veterans with PTSD who respond to
exposure therapy (24).

Methylation inﬂuences biological responses to environmental
stimuli and similarly, environmental exposures alter gene
regulation through methylation changes. Thus, the examination
of methylation patterns as biomarkers which may predispose
an individual to respond to treatment or change as a result of
treatment may reveal important mechanistic insights to help
optimize interventions and develop new treatments. While gene
expression and regulating factors may diﬀer across cell and tissue
types, peripheral DNA from blood may serve as an accessible
source for DNA methylation biomarker studies. We conducted
a pilot study investigating the methylation of SLC6A4 and FKBP5
genes before and after MBSR in veterans with PTSD who
responded or did not respond to 9 weeks of treatment as deﬁned
by changes in scores on the PTSD Checklist rating scale. We
hypothesized that decreased methylation in SLC6A4 and FKBP5
would be associated with better treatment response to MBSR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Design
We conducted a case-control candidate gene study investigating
relationships between SLC6A4 and FKBP5 methylation with
responders (n = 11) and non-responders (n = 11) to MBSR in
veterans with PTSD. Comparisons in methylation measures at
baseline and then changes after 9 weeks of MBSR were examined
between responders and non-responders.

Participants
Participants (n = 22) represent a subsample of a larger clinical
trial (NCT01548742) of n = 116 veterans recruited at the
Minneapolis Veterans Aﬀairs Health Care System from March

Epigenetics of Response to MBSR

2012 to December 2013 which compared MBSR to Present
Centered Group Therapy (PCGT) for the treatment of PTSD
(9). All participants included in this pilot methylation study
were Caucasian. Participants were at least 18 years of age,
met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) (25) diagnostic criteria for PTSD
based on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) (26)
and, if taking psychoactive medication, were on a stable regimen
for 4 or more weeks prior to study enrollment. Participants
were excluded if they (a) reported current suicidal or homicidal
ideation; (b) met DSM-IV criteria for current substance abuse
or dependence (except nicotine or caﬀeine) per self-reported
answers on the diagnostic interview or (c) met DSM-IV criteria
for a psychotic disorder; or (d) were diagnosed with severe
cognitive impairment, severe traumatic brain injury, or medical
illness that could interfere with treatment; or (e) were unable to
comprehend or communicate in English; or (f) were unwilling
to refrain from other active forms of psychotherapy during the
study period. This study was carried out in accordance with
the recommendations of Minneapolis VA Health Care System
and University of Minnesota institutional review boards with
written informed consent from all subjects. All subjects gave
written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. The protocol was approved by both the Minneapolis VA
Health Care System and University of Minnesota institutional
review boards. Participants for this pilot study were selected to
compare speciﬁc methylation measures between responders and
non-responders to MBSR to support larger scale methylation and
genetic studies of this participant cohort. Responders and non-
responders were deﬁned based on whether or not participants
achieved a reduction of 10 or more points on the PTSD Checklist
(PCL) for symptom severity (27). Participants for inclusion
needed to have clinical data and DNA available for baseline
and follow-up time points. From this larger group of n = 51
participants receiving MBSR, Caucasian responders (n = 11) and
non-responders (n = 11) were selected for matching baseline
symptoms (baseline PCL total score), age, sex, current smoking
status, and current antidepressant use. These and other clinical
and demographic variables are included in Table 1.

Assessments
The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom
severity over
time as assessed by the PCL (28) at all
assessment points. Diagnoses were based on DSM-IV criteria
for PTSD, and a severity score was calculated by summing
frequency and intensity scores for all 17 symptoms. The
minimal clinically important diﬀerence (MCID) for PTSD
symptom severity is a reduction of 10 or more points on
the PCL and CAPS. Comorbid depression symptoms were
assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-
9) (29). Participants also reported treatment satisfaction at
week 9 using a scale ranging from 1 to 4 with higher
scales indicating greater satisfaction. Demographic information,
including self-reported race/ethnicity, was collected at baseline.
Mental health treatment history, self-reports of current and
prior smoking status, and measures of early life trauma
(physical/sexual/emotional abuse, emotional/physical neglect,

and alcoholic environment) were extracted from VA electronic
medical records.

Intervention
The standard protocol for MBSR used for this study included
incorporated PTSD
an orientation to the program that
psychoeducation and treatment rationale, followed by 7 weekly
2.5-h group sessions and a 6.5-h retreat, for a total of 9 sessions
over the course of 9 weeks. The program teaches participants
to attend to the present moment (immediate emotional and
physical states, including discomfort) in a nonjudgmental and
accepting way. Sessions involved didactic training and practice
in 3 meditation techniques including (1) body scan, (2) sitting
meditation, and (3) mindful yoga. Further details on the
procedures and ﬁdelity assessments for the MBSR and clinical
ratings have been previously presented (9).

Methylation Studies
Blood samples were collected in EDTA-treated vacutainer tubes
at baseline (pre-treatment) and at week 9 (post-treatment)
for this study. DNA was extracted (ArchivePureTM DNA Kit)
and assessed with standard picogreen and UV absorbance QC
procedures. Genomic DNA was normalized to a concentration of
20 ng/µl and bisulﬁte converted using the EZ DNA Methylation
Kit (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

A next generation sequencing approach was used to examine
methylation in regions of SLC6A4 (Chr17: 28521337-28563020)
and FKBP5 (Chr6: 35541362-35696360). A total of ﬁve amplicons
ranging from 203–254 bp were generated for selected areas of
each gene. The regions selected for coverage examined 42
unique CpG sites (chr17:28562752-28563675) in the promoter
region of SLC6A4 previously associated with depression risk and
symptoms (30, 31) (Figure 1) as well as 7 unique CpG sites in the
FKBP5 Intron 7 region (chr6:35558312-35558806) identiﬁed as a
functional regulator of glucocorticoid signaling (32) (Figure 2).
PCR primers for the ampliﬁcation of FKBP5 and SLC6A4
gene target regions were designed to speciﬁcally amplify only
bisulﬁte-modiﬁed DNA with consensus binding sites outside of
known DNA SNPs with minor allele frequencies >0.5%. All PCR
primers were tested with unmodiﬁed genomic DNA and showed
no ampliﬁcation to ensure speciﬁcity to bisulﬁte-treated DNA.
Human methylated and unmethylated DNA controls (Zymo
Research) served as positive and negative methylation controls
and were used to ensure unbiased ampliﬁcation of methylated
or unmethylated, bisulﬁte-modiﬁed DNA. PCR primer and
are provided in Supplemental Table 1.
amplicon details
Following primer optimization, sequencing was accomplished
in three steps. First, independent PCR reactions were carried
out for each bisulﬁte-modiﬁed DNA sample in high-throughput
format. Second, all amplicons for each sample were pooled, and
“barcoded” with a sample-speciﬁc sequence index using indexing
primers. Finally, these pools were combined into a superpool for
loading onto an Illumina MiSeq instrument, and run in paired-
end 2 × 300-bp mode. Raw paired end reads were merged into
single fragments using PEAR (33). Merged reads were aligned
to the bisulﬁte human genome using WALT (34). Percent
methylation and coverage at each CpG was calculated using the

FIGURE 2 | FKBP5 gene intron 7 region for DNA methylation detection. Two sets of primers were designed to cover a 594 base pair region of intron 7 containing 7
CpG sites. FKBP5 intron 7 CpG sites are categorized into three bins as previously described (33): bin 1 contains CpG: 35558386 and CpG: 35558438, bin 2 contains
CpG: 35558488, CpG: 35558513, and CpG: 35558566, and bin 3 contains CpG: 35558710 and CpG: 35558721. Primer binding locations are indicated by arrows.

Statistical Analyses
Baseline diﬀerences between groups were examined using
student’s t-tests for continuously measured variables and χ2
statistics for categorical variables. Fisher’s exact test was used
when expected cell sizes were <5. To examine pre-treatment
methylation diﬀerences, we compared % methylation in those
who went on to respond versus those who did not respond to
treatment at 9 weeks using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
with lifetime trauma events used as covariate. Next we compared
change in % methylation from before to after treatment
in responders vs. non-responders using repeated measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA) while accounting for lifetime
trauma events. Due to the correlated nature of CpG sites
within each gene, we employed a principal component data
reduction approach for our primary analyses. Primary analyses
examined mean % methylation in FKBP5 CpG sites divided

into three “bins” based on methylation patterns similar to
previous investigations (32), and for SLC6A4, we identiﬁed
one primary component comprised of n = 21 CpG sites
in the CpG island region of the SLC6A4 promoter similar
to previous studies which have taken a PCA approach to
data reduction in this gene (36). We were not powered to
parse additional components of SLC6A4 and thus focused our
analyses on the primary component. Post-hoc examinations of
individual CpG sites within bins were conducted for primary
comparisons that yielded signiﬁcance at the trend level or
better (p < 0.10). Lastly, we examined methylation at baseline
and changes after treatment in relation to PCL scores as a
continuous measure using Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcients.
Analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM Corp. Released 2013.

RESULTS

Participants included in this analysis were predominantly male
(n = 18, 82%), ranging from 33 to 79 years of age. Most
participants (n = 13, 59%) were Vietnam era veterans with
68% having ≥2 years of service. Approximately 27% were
current smokers, and 27% had a record of childhood trauma.
Table 1 provides information on baseline demographics and
clinical characteristics for the sample. There were no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between responder and non-responder groups in
demographic and clinical characteristics before treatment.

Methylation of SLC6A4
Baseline (Pre-Treatment)
Methylation of the primary component of SLC6A4 at baseline
did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer between responders and non-
responders. Similarly, when all participants were examined
together regardless of responder status, SLC6A4 methylation was
not signiﬁcantly correlated with PCL total scores at baseline
(r = 0.324, p = 0.152).

Change From Before to After MBSR Treatment
There was no main eﬀect of time for methylation changing in
the primary component of SLC6A4. Similarly, we did not observe
a signiﬁcant correlation between methylation change and PCL
change from before to after treatment (r = 0.216, p = 0.346).

Methylation of FKBP5
Baseline (Pre-Treatment)
There were no diﬀerences in baseline methylation identiﬁed
between responders and non-responders for any of the FKBP5

intron 7 bins examined (see Figure 3). FKBP5 methylation was
not signiﬁcantly correlated with PCL change scores at baseline
(bin1: r = −0.116, p = 0.616; bin2: r = −0.083, p = 0.721, bin3:
r = –0.234, p = 0.308).

Change From Before to After MBSR Treatment
There was a signiﬁcant time x responder group interaction
for methylation in FKBP5 intron 7 bin 2 [F(1, 19) = 7.492,
p = 0.013, Bonferroni adjusted p = 0.052; Figure 4 and
Supplemental Table 2] whereby responders had an increase in
methylation and non-responders had a decrease in methylation
from before to after treatment in this region. Analyses of
the three CpG sites of bin 2 revealed a signiﬁcant
time
x responder group interaction for CpG_35558513 of bin 2
[F(1, 19) = 5.551, p = 0.029; Figure 4 and Supplemental Table 2]
which resides in a previously described GRE (32). FKBP5 intron
7 bin2 methylation change and PCL change scores examined
as continuous measures in all participants from before to after
treatment were signiﬁcantly correlated (r = −0.451, p = 0.04;
Figure 5).

DISCUSSION

This is the ﬁrst study to examine methylation relationships
with treatment response to MBSR in veterans with PTSD who
were carefully matched for other clinical and demographic
variables. We identiﬁed methylation changes in relation to
response in a GRE of FKBP5 intron 7 after

bin 2. FKBP5 is part of the stress feedback loop regulating
glucocorticoid receptor function. As previously noted, FKBP5
upregulation feeds back to decrease glucocorticoid activity as part
of a normal stress response, with demethylation usually resulting
in increased expression. Previous studies of the intron 7 region of
FKBP5 and PTSD risk characterized allele-speciﬁc methylation
patterns in relation to childhood trauma and the development

Epigenetics of Response to MBSR

of PTSD later in life (32). In that context, demethylation was
associated with increased stress-related gene transcription and
long-term dysregulation of stress regulation. To our knowledge
ours is the ﬁrst treatment study to examine changes in FKBP5
intron 7 GREs in relation to improvement over time. This is
signiﬁcant as methylation in this region has been predominantly
studied in the context of childhood trauma that was thought
to impart chronic and irreversible methylation changes in this
region.

To date, two studies have examined diﬀerent regions of FKBP5
methylation in response to psychotherapy, which were diﬀerent
non-pharmacological interventions than the MBSR approach
employed in our protocol (24, 37). Both of these studies examined
methylation in the FKBP5 promoter region, which is diﬀerent
from the intron 7 focus of our study. Consistent with our
study, baseline FKBP5 methylation was not related to eventual
responder status to either cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)
in children with anxiety disorders (37) or exposure therapy
(n = 8 responders or 8 non-responders) in veterans with PTSD
(24). Additionally, consistent with our ﬁndings is that despite
examining a diﬀerent regulator region of FKBP5 than our study
(exon 1 promoter vs.
intron 7 GRE in our study) both of
these investigations showed that changes in methylation were
related to better symptom response with corresponding measures
of increased gene expression identiﬁed in the study of PTSD
response to exposure therapy (24).

Our study further adds to the body of evidence suggesting that
FKBP5 methylation may be modiﬁed by non-pharmacological
interventions and that regulatory regions (i.e., intron 7 GREs
studied here) thought to represent relatively stable methylated
regions are in fact malleable through therapies that may help
patients regulate stress feedback. Collectively our ﬁndings as
well as those of others are consistent with the hypothesis that
non-pharmacologic interventions may facilitate stress reduction
through the regulation of FKBP5 to feedback on glucocorticoid
hyperactivity to reduce stress.

Serotonin Transporter
In the CpG island region of the serotonin transporter prioritized
for analysis in this study, we did not observe signiﬁcant
relationships with treatment response. To our knowledge, the
only studies speciﬁcally examining baseline methylation in
relation to treatment response have involved antidepressant
medications for depression (16, 30). These two studies had
conﬂicting results with respect to higher or lower pre-treatment
methylation predicting better outcomes. Amidst a growing body
of data establishing the deleterious inﬂuence of early life trauma
on antidepressant response for major depression later in life
(38) and the known inﬂuence of early life trauma on SLC6A4
methylation (30), the relevance of these drug treatment studies
for depression to our non-pharmacological
intervention for
PTSD is unclear. It is important to note that the serotonin
transporter is generally expressed at lower levels in WBCs (as
opposed to exclusively examining platelets), and thus perhaps not
an optimal biomarker to study using this sampling methodology.
Additionally, there are regions beyond the CpG island that may
warrant future study. Our small sample size precluded us from

parsing out additional components for analyses. The shore and
AluJB regions near the promoter, as well as others may be
relevant for future studies. Most (91%) of our participants were
on stable antidepressant treatment as PTSD has a high rate
of comorbid depression. Depression scores, rates of early life
trauma, and medication exposures did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer in
our responder and non-responder groups.

LIMITATIONS

Our pilot study was small, designed to assess whether there was
preliminary evidence to support larger investigations with more
comprehensive methylation and genetic studies. As such, there
are other genes (notably monoamine genes beyond SLC6A4)
not assessed herein, that may be potentially informative. We
were not powered to examine the inﬂuences of factors that are
generally highly variable in larger sample sizes which include
age, sex, race, smoking, medication exposures, trauma histories,
genotype interactions, etc. However, recognizing this limitation,
we carefully matched our responder and non-responder groups
so that these factors did not diﬀer or were equally represented
in each responder group of our focused study sample. It is
important to note that smoking and alcohol consumption have
been reported to inﬂuence DNA methylation (39, 40). While
the distribution of current, former, and non-smokers did not
diﬀer across responder and non-responders in our study, we
are not able to unequivocally rule out the inﬂuence of smoking.
Similarly, while none of the participants in our study met
criteria for current alcohol (or other substance) use or abuse,
a more detailed assessment of alcohol consumption may be
informative. Our study was too small to examine the eﬀects of
known genotypes in SLC6A4 (e.g., the 5HTTLPR) and FKBP5
(e.g., rs1360780), which may interact with gene methylation to
inﬂuence gene expression. Additionally, the SLC6A4 results need
to be interpreted with caution given the overall methylation
levels observed in this gene were very low. This pilot study
was not powered to control for multiple statistical comparisons.
Consequently our ﬁndings require replication with larger and
more diverse samples. The small sample size of our study and
demographically homogeneous responder and non-responder
groups may limit the broader generalizability of our methylation
ﬁndings in relation to MBSR. However, we observed important
consistencies with FKBP5 ﬁndings with prior genetic studies
examining diﬀerent disease states or interventions, supporting
the mechanistic importance of the ﬁndings observed here.
Finally, it is important to note the limitations of using white
blood cell DNA, where cell composition may inﬂuence the
to WBCs,
relative expression of genes. With respect
the
low levels, primarily
serotonin transporter is expressed at
in lymphocytes.

CONCLUSIONS

We report herein the ﬁrst study to examine pre- and post-
treatment methylation patterns in relation to response to MBSR
in veterans with long standing and symptomatic PTSD. Prior

studies have suggested that SLC6A4 or FKBP5 methylation or
genotypes which regulate gene expression inﬂuence the risk for
developing PTSD (14, 19, 41). It is important to note, however,
that these are not deterministic factors. Our study was comprised
exclusively of veterans who had long-standing PTSD. Whether
methylation or other genetic factors related to these genes were
related to the development of PTSD in these individuals is
unclear. Regardless of disease etiology, we identiﬁed signiﬁcant
changes between pre-treatment and post-treatment FKBP5
methylation in responders and non-responders, highlighting the
potential utility of methylation in this, and perhaps related
genes, as biomarkers of treatment response. These ﬁndings add
important mechanistic information related to treatment response
that builds on a wealth of knowledge that exists about epigenetic
and genetic relationships with PTSD disease risk.
