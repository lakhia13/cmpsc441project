Societies, including those of humans, have evolved multiple ways of dealing
with death across changing circumstances and pressures. Despite many
studies focusing on specialized topics, for example necrophoresis in eusocial
insects, mortuary activities in early human societies, or grief and mourning
in bereavement, there has been little attempt to consider these disparate
research endeavours from a broader evolutionary perspective. Evolutionary
thanatology does this by adopting an explicit evolutionary stance for studies
of death and dying within the sociological, psychological and biological dis-
ciplines. The collection of papers in this themed issue demonstrates the value
of this approach by describing what is known about how various nonhuman
species detect and respond to death in conspecifics, how problems of dispos-
ing of the dead have evolved in human societies across evolutionary time
and also within much shorter time frames, how human adults’ understand-
ing of death develops, and how it is ultimately reflected in death-related
language. The psychological significance and impact of death is clearly
seen in some species’ grief-like reactions to the loss of attachment figures,
and perhaps uniquely in humans, the existence of certain psychological pro-
cesses that may lead to suicide. Several research questions are proposed as
starting points for building a more comprehensive picture of the ontogeny
and phylogeny of how organisms deal with death.

This article is part of the theme issue ‘Evolutionary thanatology: impacts

of the dead on the living in humans and other animals’.

Death could not be more profound a subject for the biological sciences. The
treatment of the corpse, and the effect of an organism’s death on its surviving
conspecifics, are core research topics for biological and social scientists, clinical
practitioners, and philosophers, for myriad reasons including death’s univers-
ality, inevitability, irreversibility, and its social and behavioural consequences.
Many of us fear death—or at least dying in pain—and as we shall see, even
our languages reveal how deep-rooted our concern with it is; the moral stand-
ing of the dead can be profound and exert considerable agency among the
living, and self-induced death remains a considerably controversial moral
and social issue. Despite this, however, as several of the contributors to this
themed issue note, social and cultural trends over the last century have dis-
tanced most of us from the direct experience of death, and have often
fostered a concern to shield children from exposure to it. The result has been
the replacement of direct experience and explicit reference by a complex
system of culturally varied euphemisms that are usually aimed at masking
death or denying its terminal effects [1].

Studying the antecedents, causes and sequelae of death in the animal king-
dom and over the long term should, we suggest, form one of the most profound
scientific endeavours. Many disciplines have contributed specific perspectives
on these, in species ranging from bacteria to insects, birds to aquatic and terres-
trial mammals, and anthropoid primates including humans. The literature in
these disparate fields, comprising observational, experimental, clinical and
sociological studies, is already voluminous; however, thanatology—the aca-
demic study of death and dying—has largely lacked a broad evolutionary
perspective that could draw these fields together.

We formally propose here the field of evolutionary thana-
tology. We believe that now is a highly appropriate time to
do so, developing a more explicit evolutionary consideration
of all aspects of studies of death and dying across the biologi-
cal and sociological
fields. Many volumes have been
published that are devoted to bereavement, grief, and to
the development of ‘funerary’ activities in both early and
modern humans (e.g. [2–5]), but little attention has been
paid to the evolutionary roots and development of many of
the death-related activities that have been observed in
ancient, recent and modern human societies, and to their
psychological foundations and significance. Major changes
in human funerary activities can be traced not only over thou-
sands of years [6], but also within much shorter time frames
[1]; examples include an increasing distance from the experi-
ence of death and funerary treatment of the corpse, by way,
for example, of the increasing outsourcing of funeral services,
smaller funeral gatherings, and new ways of disposing of
corpses as a result of increasing urbanization and industrial-
ization [7]. The use of online social media has played an
increasing role in the dissemination of death notices and
expressions of condolences and commemoration, essentially
a digitalization of funerary activity, and in the USA some
drive-through funeral parlours are even tailored to allow
mourners to pay their respects without leaving their car. Fun-
erals and memorial events for dead nonhuman animals (not
only pets) are becoming increasingly popular in various
countries [8], and in Japan this extends to defunct (‘dead’)
robotic dogs, whose parts (‘organs’) may be removed and
donated to other defective robots [9] (figure 1). Clearly,
such rapid and profound changes in how we treat the
dead, and indeed even in what our concept of ‘dead’ might
fall within the
mean, reflect cultural developments that
scope—if at one extreme—of evolutionary thanatology.

justifiable

But where to start? As we shall see, the recognition of
death, and responses to the corpse, can have chemical,
emotional, rational and cultural bases. The evolutionary per-
spective we advocate requires a comparative approach, not
just within but also across biological taxa. Our aims should
be ambitious. What, then, do observations of insects, birds
and nonhuman mammals contribute to modern human
thanatology?
to seek links between
complex modern beliefs and practices and the chemically
determined responses of
insects or emotionally variable
responses of mammals? Can one distinguish discrete
packages of responses, perhaps correlated with distinct
animal classes, orders, families, and genera? If so, are certain
categories or ‘levels’ of thanatological behaviour predictable
under given biological and social circumstances? Under
what circumstances do taxa come under selection for evol-
ution of their treatment of the dead? How do the dead
impact on the living in various species, and how important
is this to the expression of behaviour towards the corpse? A
coherent collection of papers that address such issues will
be an important first step on the road to setting out an
agenda for the emerging field of evolutionary thanatology,
and we outline a more specific set of research questions at
the end of this paper.

Currently, most thanatology-related reports comprise iso-
lated publications in specialist journals (e.g. in archaeology,
primatology, zoology, psychology, sociology or human
thanatology). Although it is increasingly rich and nuanced,
and despite some broader accounts aimed at a general

audience (e.g. [10]), this literature provides us with mostly
unconnected glimpses of ‘crow funerals’, ‘elephant grave-
yards’
and ‘Neanderthal burials’, with no rigorous
investigation of their intra- or interspecific significance or
examination of the evolutionary connections between them.
Although, as we shall see from several contributions, current
thanatological understanding is for most taxa incomplete and
even poor, the available literature does provide a valuable set
of studies on which to base preliminary hypotheses for an
explicit evolutionary thanatological perspective with which
to address these lacunae. From our own research on
responses to dead individuals in chimpanzees and early
humans [6,11,12] the three of us have become increasingly
aware that a cross-field fertilization is critical for this new tha-
natology. Hence, to provide comprehensive and balanced
coverage, this themed issue presents a broad survey of non-
human responses to the dead, including corpse avoidance
and disposal mechanisms in social insects, exploratory inter-
actions with deceased companions in corvids, and caretaking
responses to dying and dead individuals in mammals includ-
ing cetaceans and primates. Contributions also address the
evolution of funerary activities in ancestral humans, cultural
variations in funerary practices in prehistoric to modern
humans, and related phenomena including suicide, infanti-
cide, ‘cannibalism’, developments in the treatment of grief,
cognition, and linguistic and philosophical underpinnings
of humans’ perception of and activities towards the dead,
which take us from the chemical to the cultural realm.

An obvious point of departure is the mechanisms by which
animals detect that death has occurred, and at what stage they
are cognizant of it. Drawing on evolutionary thanatology’s
broad taxonomic
comparison of non-human animals’
responses to death and the deceased, Goncalves & Biro [13]
explore the cognitive and sensory bases for detecting life and
death in others across invertebrate and vertebrate taxa, seeking
phylogenetically ancient as well as more derived mechanisms
behind the responses exhibited. When vertebrate taxa encoun-
ter dead conspecifics they are confronted by conflicting data;
the brain’s imperfect agency system will retain notions of the
animacy of the deceased, albeit in the absence of any signs
of animacy. The authors suggest that the resulting ‘animacy
detection malfunction’ is the mechanism that unites the drivers
of responses to the dead in the vertebrate taxa examined. They
argue for the integration of approaches from a variety of disci-
plines—including those as diverse as cognitive science and
robotics—as a way of advancing the field of evolutionary
thanatology.

The eusocial insects present a remarkable array of ways in
which the living deal actively and efficiently with corpses.
Sun et al. [14] emphasize the risks of disease from dead indi-
viduals in densely populated, enclosed colonies of ants,
termites and bees; and describe the often sophisticated and
complex ways in which these risks are managed, largely
based on olfactory cues. It is apparent from their review
that variable causes of death will affect the specific ways in
which the corpse is treated, introducing a number of beha-
viours that must, therefore, have deep evolutionary roots,
notably necrophobia (avoiding the corpse), necrophoresis
(removal of the corpse from the colony), intraspecific necro-
(burial, elsewhere
phagy (cannibalism) and entombment
referred to as necroclaustralisation).
In an evolutionary
sense the eusocial insects, therefore, provide a remarkably
variable core set of basic responses to the dead, from which
further elaboration is possible over a number of trajectories.
Swift & Marzluff [15] study the drivers of tactile and other
interactions with the dead, through controlled experiments
with wild American crows. By presenting live crows with taxi-
dermy-prepared specimens in various postures, they find that
tactile contacts are rare and typically take the form of aggres-
sive or sexual interactions, while the more frequent alarm
calling response
the
specimens as being dead. The extreme manifestations of
aggressive and sexual responses to the corpse, which in the
case of crows may derive from an inability to mediate between
conflicting stimuli, can also be traced among primates and
early humans, perhaps providing an evolutionary basis for
expression of the common conflicting emotions of anger and
sorrow as human responses to death.

These interactions with the corpse are not restricted to the
terrestrial realm. Reggente and colleagues [16] provide a com-
pendium of more than 100 reported cases of responses to
conspecific death events among aquatic mammals—most of
which comprise behaviour towards deceased young—and
perform a comprehensive quantitative treatment to seek indi-
vidual and social variables that predict the type of response
exhibited. Cetaceans and non-cetaceans both react to death,
but in distinct ways; whereas the latter protect their dead
from attack, cetaceans carry the corpse, a difference that
may relate to the relative maternity investment (short in
non-cetaceans), and is reminiscent of
the
parent –offspring bond on corpse management observable
among primates. Reggente et al.
identify characteristics
such as levels of alloparental care and calf dependence as
variables that shape behaviour towards the dead in different
species, for example by increasing the length and intensity of
caretaking directed at deceased young.

review they identify varied
responses among apes and monkeys including grooming,
protection of the corpse, and filial cannibalism. As in crows,
the wide range of these responses is notable. They argue
that to elucidate proximate and ultimate drivers of these
varied responses the detailed reporting of data from a diverse
range of species will be needed. To facilitate the development
of evolutionary thanatology they propose explanatory
hypotheses for these behaviours, and provide a systematic
framework for testing alternative hypotheses through the
quantitative coding of post-mortem behaviour.

Anderson [18] focuses specifically on chimpanzees, review-
ing the literature and describing the various ways in which
they can learn about death in conspecifics and other species.
As in Sun et al.’s analysis of eusocial insects, his review of
causes of death raises the question of to what extent cause is
reflected in the behaviour towards the corpse. Based on chim-
panzees’ known cognitive and empathic abilities, Anderson
notes that they are likely to be aware that death is characterized
by a cessation of function, and that it is irreversible, traits that,
as we shall see, modern human children possess by the age of
10. Anderson suggests that with sufficient personal experience
of dangerous situations, and through witnessing injurious or
fatal events in others, these great apes may construct a concept
of death that shares several of the components of adult
humans’ death concept, a notion picked up by Pettitt
(see below). As with other contributors, Anderson notes a
desire for researchers to pay more attention to cultural
(i.e. inter-group) variations in practice.

Several contributors take us into the complexities of the
modern world. Shimane [7] is interested in how modernization
over the last century has impacted on funerary practices. His
quantitative analysis of contemporary practices in five east
and southeast Asian countries reveals that in the context of
relentless population migration and rise of average age at
death, death-related services have become increasingly commo-
ditized and outsourced over a very short period of time,
alongside a growing disengagement of local communities
from their own funerary ceremonies. Thus, he documents
how the evolution of human funerary practices, which began
with simple necrophoresis, is undergoing rapid and significant
change in the industrialized world.

This rapid pace of change in modern,

industrialized
societies has altered children’s exposure to death, with
changes in multiple direct and indirect factors variably affect-
ing their acquisition of death concepts. In their discussion of
the changing weight of these factors, Longbottom & Slaughter
[19] highlight the importance of direct experience (including
the deaths of animals), parental communication, and media
portrayals in children’s developing concept of death. They
conclude with recommendations for enhancing children’s
understanding and readiness to cope with bereavement.
Harris [20] takes a developmental psychologist’s perspective
on children’s concepts of death. By the age of 10 children
know that it is inevitable for all living creatures, and irrevers-
ible. Harris argues in particular that children adopt two
parallel concepts of death: one from a biological viewpoint
in which the dead are corpses, and another in which they
are thought of as continuing in another existence, despite
being deceased in this one. Such continuing ties to the dead
manifest, among other things, in burials. Given their proxi-
mity to the living, he argues, these may ratchet up the
accumulation of memories about
the dead, and hence
deepen awareness of antecedent generations.

In an agenda for how Palaeolithic archaeology may
contribute to wider evolutionary thanatology, Pettitt
[21]
shares the interest in the origins of burial, reading the earliest
burials of Neanderthals and Homo sapiens in the context of a
developing sense of persistent social space. Picking up from
observations such as Anderson’s, he argues that a core set
of mortuary activities occurring face-to-face—similar
to
those documented for modern primates in this volume—
began to extend into the landscape as early human group
that
size and social

complexity grew to the extent

peripersonal mortuary behaviours were no longer sustain-
able. He sets out a number of research questions for
Palaeolithic thanatology. Chronologically, Orschiedt [22] fol-
lows on, reviewing the burial practices of the European Final
Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic, the stable but diverse
practices of Europe’s last prehistoric hunter-gatherers. He
observes geographical variation in whether burial was prac-
tised or not, and differences in extreme states of corpse
processing (disarticulation, as opposed to burial). Most
importantly, he identifies the appearance of ‘cemetery-like’
clusters of relatively large numbers of burials, a pattern that
one can also see in North Africa and the Near East. He sees
considerable continuity between the first cemeteries of the
last few thousand years of the Pleistocene and the Mesolithic
communities of early and mid-Holocene Europe, while recog-
nizing an increasing diversity of practice among the latter.
Matsumoto [23] takes us even further into the cultural evol-
ution of burials, reviewing the relationship between the
living and the dead in Japanese prehistory. The dead seem
to have continued to play a central role in the social systems
of the living among Jomon hunter-gatherers, evidenced, she
argues, by funerary practices that changed significantly
alongside major demographic thresholds. With the first
population increase in the Middle Jomon period, the first
cemeteries were created, as a response to increased sedent-
ism. Following a population disruption,
subsequent
practices focused on burials placed centrally in circular
planned settlements; after these, in turn, collective secondary
burials were emplaced in newly established settlements. All
of these are clear examples of the centrality of the dead to kin-
ship systems, and the effects of population movement and
disruption on the latter.

languages,

suggesting that

representations of

Not just our actions but also the ways we speak about
death can inform us about how we think about it. In a power-
ful linguistic analysis, Husband [24] examines death-related
verbs, which are remarkably prevalent in any language, to
argue that death has a special significance in human cognition.
Death-verbs are shown to exhibit different grammatical
constraints compared to other verbs, and to do so consistently
across different
language
surrounding death can reveal aspects of the evolution of
mental
thanatological phenomena in
humans. Perhaps the most profound indication that most
societies believe—if unconsciously—in some kind of contin-
ued agency of the dead, is their persistence in the moral
systems of the living. Luper [25] provides a philosophical
treatment of the moral issues surrounding our treatment of
the dead, asking if the dead have moral standing. By demon-
strating that events that happen after an individual’s death can
indeed be good or bad for them (despite the fact that they are
dead)—and thus by affecting their prudential interests it is
possible for us to benefit or harm them posthumously—the
dead can be argued to have moral standing.

Given that death constitutes the mental and physical
cessation of an individual in the world, and as at some
point in evolution individuals have come to know that they
can choose when to end their existence within it, death has
come to be imbued with considerable moral responsibility.
Two papers focus on suicide. Noting that suicide constitutes
a remarkable 1.4% of deaths worldwide—it is the leading
cause of violent death—Humphrey [26] explores some of
the psychological particularities of humans that might make
the purposeful killing of oneself a uniquely human

phenomenon. He contrasts ‘altruistic’ and ‘egoistic’ suicide,
and explores how these puzzling behaviours have evolved.
The suicide meme is highly infectious, and most suicides
are egoistic—deriving from a desire to remove one’s own
mind from the world, a concern with personal escape, often
with no concern for its effects on others. But how could
this be adaptive, and how might attempts to deter it create
cultural beliefs about death? O’Connor & Kirtley [27] note
that, despite some 800 000 suicides globally per year, we
are still unable to predict its imminence; it is a major public
health concern. Commencing from the heuristic that suicide
is a behaviour, built on precedents of ideation and intention,
they present the ‘integrated motivational-volitional model’
of suicide, to explain how suicidal ideation can progress to
completion of the act. The model focuses on interactions
between negative feelings such as defeat or entrapment and
other personal and environmental factors such as impulsiv-
ity, access
to means, and exposure to suicide, with
implications for preventive intervention.

returning to normal

Grief—and its emotional precursors—forms a central
concern of thanatology, and although humans experience it
as a natural response to bereavement, in many cases it may
become pathological: it can persist, with little sign of the suf-
ferer
functioning. Nakajima [28]
provides a study of extreme cases of grief, through examples
of persisting grief with high levels of acute symptoms. She
traces developments in the understanding of normal and
‘complicated grief’, the latter of which can have profound
mental health implications and act as one stimulus for
suicide. Agreement on criteria for the identification of com-
plicated grief is still lacking, hence research is required for
its diagnosis and treatment.

The contributions to this themed issue understandably
present a disparate set of behaviours, although there are sur-
prisingly repeated themes that are shared by most and they
provide fruitful opportunities for cross-disciplinary research.
Studies across modern animal taxa will provide the spatial
perspective; the long-term perspectives offered by archaeol-
ogy will provide the time; and perspectives on the modern
urban and industrial world will provide the extreme
complexity. What do these disparate studies reveal? Certainly
a surprising variability of responses to death and to the
corpse in both terrestrial and aquatic realms, whereby
responses vary with the relationship of the deceased to the
living, the cause of death and condition of the corpse, and
involving chemical, visual and tactile information gathering.
We outlined some broad aims for evolutionary thanatology
above; now, some more specific research questions for
evolutionary thanatology emerge:

— Is it feasible to construct a phylogeny of responses to
traits are phylogenetically ancient, and

death; what
what ones derived?

— Does the evolutionary diversification of responses to
death/the corpse always follow an elaboration from
chemical through emotional to cultural stimuli?

— To what extent do cues in various sensory modalities elicit
thanatological responses (including motoric and affective
or emotional) in different taxa?

— How variable can behaviours such as necrophobia, necro-
phoresis, necrophagy and necroclaustralisation be within
a specific taxon? Are they applied to all of the deceased?
If not, under what conditions are they applied?

— Exactly how does social structure of the living—and the
position of
the deceased within this—determine the
specific responses to death/the corpse? At what classifica-
tory level/s can one identify this?

— Can specific responses to death/corpses in a particular
taxon be related to the specific nature of
the death
event? At what biological classificatory level/s can one
identify this?

— How are mechanisms for detecting, dealing with or deny-
ing the effects of death determined by evolving social
environments?

tion got
in
evolution can one identify a specifically moral concern
with suicide (and, we would add, murder)?

to grips with not being? At what point

These questions are merely a sample; others, along with
new ideas and methods for advancing knowledge of the
evolution of responses to death will emerge from both onto-
genetic and phylogenetic perspectives. Field workers have
often been reluctant to report single case studies of death-
related responses in animal societies given the perceived
problem that they may be unique and hence unrepresentative

of any ‘norms’. Why not? We must start somewhere, and
uniqueness in a thanatological sense may be as important
to document as norms. The accumulation and critical assim-
ilation of such accounts, along with results of experimental
studies such as those conducted in social insects and birds,
will be of immense importance for organizing and assessing
a holistic picture of the impacts of the dead on the living
across evolutionary history. It is our hope that this volume
will provide a valuable starting point in this endeavour,
and we thank all contributors for
taking this in the
spirit intended.
