Abstract: Background: Although digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT) is considered
effective for anxiety disorders, there is considerable heterogeneity in its efficacy across
studies, and its varied treatment content and clinical components may explain such het-
erogeneity. Objective: This review aimed to identify the efficacy of digital cognitive
behavioral therapy for panic disorder and agoraphobia, and examine whether applying
relevant clinical components of interoceptive exposure, inhibitory-learning-based exposure,
and personalization of treatment enhances its efficacy. Methods: Randomized controlled
trials of dCBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia with passive or active controls were
identified from OVID Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO. The overall
effect sizes for dCBT groups (interventions through digital platforms based on the internet,
mobile, computers, VR, etc.) were aggregated against passive control (placebo/sham)
and active control (traditional CBT) groups. For subgroup analysis, key intervention com-
ponents such as interoceptive exposure, inhibitory learning, and personalization were
assessed dichotomously (0 or 1) along with other study characteristics. The stepwise
meta-regression models were applied with traditional and Bayesian statistical testing. The
risk of bias and publication bias of included studies were assessed. Results: Among the
31 selected studies, dCBT had an overall effect size of g = 0.70 against passive control and
g = −0.05 against active control. In subgroup analysis, interoceptive exposure improved
the clinical effects for both controls, and inhibitory learning and personalization increased
the clinical effects for passive control along with therapist guide/support and the length of
sessions. Many studies were vulnerable to therapist bias and attrition bias. No publication
bias was detected. Conclusions: The heterogeneity in clinical effects of dCBT for panic
and agoraphobia can be explained by the different intervention factors they include. For
effective dCBT, therapists should consider the clinical components relevant to the treatment.

1. Introduction

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established psychotherapy to address
distorted cognition and behavior related to mental disorders. It incorporates continuous
exposure to fear-related situations or stimuli and is recommended as a preferred therapy
for panic disorder and agoraphobia [1]. However, its implementation in real-world settings
involves significant challenges. In one instance, administering therapy to multiple patients
simultaneously is difficult due to the substantial time commitment for clinical training and
the concomitant increase in treatment expenses. These issues are a significant obstacle to
delivering psychotherapy, as they limit patient access to CBT and finally inflate societal
costs over time [2].

Aiming to overcome the limitations of conventional CBT, computer-based digital
therapy has recently gained attention. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT) employs
digital platforms and technologies for treatment, including online resources or virtual reality
(VR) environments [3]. Compared to conventional CBT, dCBT reduces the intensive training
required for clinicians, allows for more patients with limited resources, and is economical [4].
Moreover, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an unparalleled surge in
the execution of unconventional treatment delivery formats for CBT [5]. Many researchers
argue that digital therapy is now rapidly reshaping the post-pandemic healthcare system,
being established as a new standard in healthcare delivery [6,7].

dCBT is also recognized as an effective treatment for panic disorder and agoraphobia—
common anxiety or phobic disorders characterized by sudden, marked fear and accompa-
nying avoidance behaviors. Panic disorder is diagnosed when there are recurrent panic
attacks and persistent concerns and changes in behavior tied to the attacks, and agorapho-
bia is diagnosed based on marked fear about public spaces or situations in which escape
might be difficult or help might be unavailable [8]. Several meta-analyses suggest that the
therapeutic effects of dCBT or exposure therapy are comparable to those of conventional
CBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia. Fodor et al.’s (2018) meta-analysis on VR therapies
for anxiety symptoms suggested a Hedges’ g value (between-group effect size with pooled
weighted standard deviation) of 0.79 across 23 studies against passive control (placebo,
sham, or waitlist groups) and Hedges’ g = −0.02 across 29 studies against active control,
suggesting dCBT’s equivalence to conventional therapies [9]. Stech et al. (2020) concluded
that the effect of dCBT for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia was g = 1.22 against
passive control and potentially equivalent to conventional CBT based on the active control
results [10].

However, these reviews have also reported substantial heterogeneity in the clinical
efficacy of dCBT across their included studies. To illustrate, although many studies have
reported strong or satisfactory clinical effects of dCBT, Stech et al.’s (2020) meta-analysis
reported that two out of nine included studies for panic disorder, and two out of six studies
for agoraphobia showed effect sizes not significantly higher than waitlist controls [10].
Various aspects may affect the inconsistent efficacy of dCBT, but one reason may be the
variations in the treatment content. Although digital healthcare has led to a prolific devel-
opment of therapies for various disorders, the lack of clinical direction in this process has
caused disagreement about the evidence-based treatment modules required for dCBT [11].
To establish the successful content of dCBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia, an evidence
base is needed regarding what clinical components can improve its effectiveness.

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1771

3 of 20

Previous studies have shown that differences in intervention components and modal-
ities can explain the heterogeneity in the effects of dCBT. For instance, Pompoli et al.’s
(2018) network meta-analysis on the clinical factors of various CBT programs concluded
that face-to-face settings tended to have higher response rates than VR, interoceptive expo-
sure had higher remission and response rates, and muscle relaxation tended to have low
remission and response rates [12]. Therefore, the clinical components of CBT may influence
its efficacy, which highlights the need to identify and understand these factors to optimize
treatment outcomes.

In this review, we present three factors that affect the efficacy of dCBT for panic
disorder and agoraphobia, both theoretically and empirically. The first is interoceptive
exposure, which simulates the somatic sensations or stimuli per se that cause anxiety. It
focuses on increasing patients’ sensitivity to their bodily sensations and the association
between such sensations and anxiety or fear [13]. Interoceptive exposure is considered
indispensable for treating panic and agoraphobia [1,14]. A meta-analysis indicated that
for any form of CBT targeting panic, interoceptive exposure has effects that are more than
40% superior [12]. We expect that this difference would also apply to dCBT.

The second factor is intensive exposure based on the inhibitory learning principle.
Craske et al. (2008, 2014) argued that in anxiety treatment, the conventional approach
of aiming to immediately reduce the anxiety itself has no theoretical basis, and patients
should aim to “tolerate” the anxiety for effective treatment [15,16]. Inhibitory-learning-
based exposure, therefore, lets patients learn that the fear is tolerable and the feared
outcomes are less likely to occur than expected [14,16]. Despite being a recently supported
concept, inhibitory learning is remarkably effective for anxiety treatment. Deacon et al.
(2013) reported that intensive exposure using inhibitory learning principles is more effective
in conventional CBT [14]. Böhnlein et al.’s (2020) systematic review also concluded that
enhancing inhibitory learning experiences can increase the success of exposure therapy for
specific phobias [17]. However, no studies have identified the effect of inhibitory learning
CBT in digital environments.

The third factor is personalization, which provides individually tailored modules for
each patient rather than allocating the same content to everyone [18]. Recently, personalized
mental health and precision medicine have become prominent areas of interest [19,20].
Moreover, this corroborates the transdiagnostic approach, a current paradigm for evidence-
based psychotherapy [18,21]. Developing digital programs in which personalized or
tailored content is functionally available is key to determining the success of digital therapy.
Several attempts have been made to establish and verify personalized dCBTs for anxiety
disorders [22,23]. Nevertheless, the clinical effect of personalized digital therapy remains
unclear. Păsărelu et al.’s (2017) meta-analysis reported that although transdiagnostic or
tailored dCBT had significantly greater clinical effects than disorder-specific therapy for
depression and quality of life outcomes, there was no evidence of its superiority in treating
anxiety symptoms [24].

To sum up, although previous reviews have demonstrated the strong efficacy of dCBT,
the source of heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies has not been clearly unraveled.
We expect that clinical components such as interoceptive exposure, inhibitory learning,
and personalization can explain the differential efficacy across studies; these are clinically
significant factors that can improve the treatment effects of dCBT, as well. Therefore, this
review investigates whether the clinical efficacy of dCBT for panic disorder and agorapho-
bia is improved by the presence of the above three factors that may affect the efficacy of
dCBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia: interoceptive exposure, inhibitory learning, and
personalization. We expect that these clinical components can explain the variability in
the clinical effects of dCBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia. Also, understanding the

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1771

clinical role of these factors will help identify strategies needed to maximize the efficacy
of dCBT.

2. Methods
2.1. Protocol

The review protocol was established based on the guidelines for systematic reviews
and meta-analyses for intervention studies, developed from the National Evidence-Based
Healthcare Collaborating Agency of Korea [25]. This guidance introduces standardized
methodology and practical information for literature selection, risk of bias assessment, vali-
dated analytic process, and the principles of reporting based on the Cochrane Handbook
and PRISMA guideline. The protocol was prepared before initiating the review, including
subgroup analysis for the three tested intervention factors of interoceptive exposure, in-
hibitory learning, and personalization. The review and analysis were conducted without
significant deviation from the protocol. The retrospectively registered protocol is available
at https://osf.io/u7h8p (accessed on 28 February 2025).

2.2. Research Questions

This review aimed to identify the efficacy of dCBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia
compared to traditional CBT or passive controls, and whether such efficacy can be improved
by applying the hypothesized clinical components of interoceptive exposure, inhibitory
learning, and personalization. The population (P) included patients with panic disorder or
agoraphobia, and the intervention (I) included computer- or digital-based CBT, including
Internet, online, or VR interventions. The comparators (C) included active (face-to-face,
in vivo) and passive (waitlist, placebo/sham) controls. The outcome (O) measures were
primary clinical endpoints for panic or agoraphobia symptoms.

2.3. Eligibility Criteria and Group Definition

The inclusion and exclusion criteria were set by standard guidelines, previous reviews,
and the established research questions for this review. The included studies were (i) publi-
cations or gray literature registered in public databases in English; (ii) original studies using
quantitative methods; (iii) clinical studies using behavioral interventions among human
subjects; and (iv) randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

The following studies were excluded: (v) incomplete reports such as protocols/trials,
with only abstracts or some parts accessible, or insufficient information for assessment;
(vi) studies not primarily targeting panic disorder and agoraphobia; (vii) studies with-
out clinical outcomes or endpoints; and (viii) studies without clear treatment or control
groups, e.g., treatment not considered digital or CBT, treatment groups involving other
interventions, or no proper active/passive controls.

For included articles, any cognitive or behavioral interventions through digital plat-
forms (e.g., internet, mobile, computer-based, VR, . . .) were considered dCBT groups, and
interventions delivered in traditional ways (e.g., face-to-face) were considered active con-
trol groups. Groups without active interventions (e.g., placebo, sham, waitlist, . . .) were
considered passive control groups.

2.4. Database and Search Strategy

This review included four databases: OVID Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library (Tri-
als), and PsycINFO. The search strategy was set using terms based on the target symptoms
(panic disorder or agoraphobia) and intervention type (dCBT). For target symptoms, terms
synonymous with panic disorder or agoraphobia were determined (panic, panic disorder,
agoraphob*). For the intervention type, free text terms were adopted along with established

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1771

5 of 20

Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), as using only controlled terms was insufficient to cover
the words indicating digital therapy. We identified as many search terms as possible to
maximize search sensitivity and the number of initially identified records. The search terms
for interventions included internet, cellular phone*, cell phone*, cellphone*, mobile phone*,
mobilephone*, computer*, microcomputer*, analog computer*, tablet computer*, laptop
computer*, digital computer*, digital, mobile application*, virtual reality, online, on-line,
web, website*, www, smartphone*, smart phone*, cyberspace*, cyber space*, personal
digital assistant, computer-assisted, computer assisted therapy, Internet-based intervention,
virtual reality exposure therapy, digital intervention*, electronic health, virtual care, virtual
healthcare, virtual healthcare, and virtual medicine. To include only RCTs and exclude
other study designs, the search terms were set based on the SIGN guidelines (Healthcare
Improvement Scotland, Edinburgh, United Kingdom). The final keyword was confirmed
as a combination of the above search terms, using Boolean operators such as AND, OR, or
NEAR. No specific restrictions were applied for each database. The database search was
conducted on 15 August 2022.

2.5. Study Selection

After initial identification and duplicate removal, Han Jung (HJ) and Ki Won Jang
(KWJ) screened the reports independently based on the above eligibility criteria. Conflicts
and discrepancies were cleared by discussion, reaching an agreement on the final selection.

2.6. Risk of Bias (RoB)

RoB for the selected studies was evaluated independently by HJ and KWJ,
who agreed on the final decision via discussion, using Cochrane’s RoB [26] tool
(https://methods.cochrane.org/risk-bias-2; accessed on 28 February 2025) with seven
domains: (i) randomization, (ii) allocation concealment, (iii) participant/therapist blinding,
(iv) assessor blinding, (v) attrition bias, (vi) selective reporting, and (vii) other risks of bias.
The risk of bias in each domain for each study was assessed as high, low, or unclear using
the Cochrane guidelines.

The raters met before the independent assessment to set the strategies for this review
and improve the rater agreement. The participant/therapist blinding domain was applied
only to studies with two or more different groups in active treatment. If the study had only
one treatment group with passive control, it was automatically considered as a low risk
of bias. Otherwise, the domain mainly focused on therapist blinding. For studies with
behavioral interventions, clinical interventions by the lead researchers should be carefully
performed. As they knew the participants’ allocated conditions, these interventions should
have been conducted by delegating the therapy to other researchers who were blind to the
allocated condition, ensuring that the therapy was fully structured to prevent subjectivity,
or carefully monitoring the intervention process to prevent deviation from the protocol [27].
Only studies applying one or more of these procedures were considered to have a low risk
of bias in this domain.

2.7. Intervention Components

For any arms that applied dCBT, whether or not the treatment content had the in-
tervention components for testing (interoceptive exposure, inhibitory learning, and per-
sonalization) was assessed dichotomously as 0 (not applicable) or 1 (applicable) by the
established criteria. HJ and KWJ independently assessed whether the selected studies
addressed the three intervention components and reached an agreement.

For interoceptive exposure, the content must be mentioned in the intervention or
treatment section. Studies that did not explicitly mention the interoceptive exposure
content were still considered applicable if they described similar concepts, such as body

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1771

6 of 20

sensations. However, any therapeutic content as part of a mindfulness program was not
considered interoceptive exposure.

For inhibitory-learning-based intensive exposure, we used the seven cardinal in-
hibitory learning strategies proposed by Craske et al. (2014): expectancy violation, deep-
ened extinction, reinforced extinction, variability, removing safety behaviors, attentional
focus, and affect labeling [16]. To be assessed as following the inhibitory learning principles,
studies must have used two or more of these seven strategies. Mere variability in the places
of exposure was not considered an inhibitory learning strategy.

Personalization was defined as an application of the optimized therapeutic or exposure
content (changes in interventions, settings, conditions, or contexts) to individuals. The
therapists or automated programs must have provided the idiosyncratic manipulation
based on prior assessment. Random multiple contexts without any prior assessment were
not considered personalization. Additionally, merely providing multiple settings (except
for the places of exposure) for the same individuals was considered variability of inhibitory
learning, not personalization.

2.8. Data Extraction

In addition to the intervention components, the following characteristics were ex-
tracted from each study/group: whether the format of dCBT was app- or VR-based,
existence of a therapist guide, target symptoms, recruitment channels, whether the sample
type was patient or general public, diagnostic criteria and existence of diagnostic inter-
views, study location or country, intervention period, number of therapy sessions, and
the existence of conflicts of interest. Information regarding the type of control group (ac-
tive/passive, waitlist/CBT/in vivo exposure), sample size of treatment and control groups,
type of primary outcome selected, and effect size (Hedges’ g) and its standard error, were
also extracted.

For the therapist guide, “guided” referred to any intervention or support by human
therapists, and “unguided” referred to fully automated digital therapy without human
interventions. This component can also be a key factor in the treatment efficacy, as patients
may be less likely to fully engage in the exposure if they do not receive adequate guidance
that ensures the content is sufficiently challenging. For outcomes, the following scales were
selected for quantitative synthesis: Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) [28], Mobility
Inventory for Agoraphobia (MI) [29], Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ) [30],
Fear Questionnaire (FQ) [31], Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) [32], and Inventory of
Agoraphobia (IA) [33]. For studies with multiple candidates for the outcome, the scales
most commonly used for the symptom severity of panic or agoraphobia (e.g., PDSS, MI)
were prioritized. However, for studies where assessor bias was rated as high, the clinician-
rated PDSS was avoided to reduce bias in estimating the effect size. HJ extracted the data,
and KWJ and the last author (DR) confirmed the extracted study characteristics.

2.9. Effect Size Estimation

The effect sizes were defined as the unbiased estimate (Hedges’ g) of the between-
group difference in the post-treatment scores of the treatment and control groups. When
estimating the effect sizes, the intention-to-treat results were preferred to the completers-
only results; however, completers-only results were used when intention-to-treat results
were unavailable. When a study had two or more dividable treatment groups, they were
considered independent groups, and Hedges’ gs were computed for all groups. When a
study had two or more control groups of the same type (both passive or both active), they
were combined with the weighted average and pooled standard deviation.

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1771

2.10. Statistical Analyses

A meta-analysis was performed by synthesizing the Hedges’ g of each study with a
random effects model. In this model, the covariances and heterogeneity estimates across
studies (Q and I2) were estimated by the maximum likelihood method. The overall effects
and subgroup effects for each clinical factor for passive and active controls were estimated
with 95% confidence intervals.

To precisely identify the effects of each factor, we adopted a meta-regression model
with the three intervention components included as moderators. Other study characteris-
tics extracted for this review were also included in this model if they could provide more
predictive power (i.e., increase the omnibus test statistics [Q statistics]). The included
factors/characteristics were considered fixed-effect variables if they were categorical and
random-effect variables if continuous. Overall, the intervention components and study
characteristics were included stepwise until the omnibus test statistics of the whole model
became the largest (i.e., the model had the strongest explanatory power). Each clinical
factor and covariate’s non-standardized estimate and its 95% confidence interval were com-
puted. To highlight the significance of certain intervention components, a supplementary
Bayesian regression model (including the same variables as the frequentist model above)
was adopted, which can often generate better results in small sample sizes [34,35]. For this
analysis, a fixed effect model with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was adopted
with a prior distribution of Beta(1, 1).

To identify publication bias, funnel plots were provided with their asymmetry test
(Egger’s test) statistics. The plots and test statistics were reported for the overall effects and
meta-regression models for passive/active controls. Trim-and-fill analyses were conducted
to adjust publication bias. All processes of meta-analyses were conducted by JASP 0.16.2.0
(https://jasp-stats.org/; accessed on 28 February 2025).

3.1. Selected Studies

Figure 1 presents the PRISMA flow chart [36] illustrating the studies selected for this
review. Of the 1120 records identified, 492 reports were assessed in the final selection after
de-duplication. The interrater reliability (Gwet’s AC1) [37] between the initial assessments
of the two raters was AC1 = 0.92.

Of the assessed reports, 31 studies were selected, comprising 30 journal articles and
1 doctoral dissertation. Specifically, 23 studies, 27 groups, and 1326 participants (669 in
treatment groups and 657 in control groups) were included in the passive control condition,
and 13 studies, 13 groups, and 663 participants (310 in treatment and 353 in control groups)
in the active control condition. A summary of excluded studies is outlined in Figure 1. For
the full list of excluded studies, see Supplementary Table S1.

3.2. Risk of Bias Assessment

Figure 2 indicates the overall RoB rates for each risk of bias domain. The initial in-
terrater reliability between the two raters for the first six RoB domains was AC1 = 0.93,
0.68, 0.31, 0.30, 0.24, and 0.85, respectively. Overall, many studies were vulnerable to
therapist and attrition biases. Many studies did not report whether therapists were blind
to the participant allocation and did not structure the treatment protocol or adequately
monitor the process. Additionally, some studies had high attrition rates or uneven dis-
tribution of attrition rates across groups. Although many studies successfully corrected
bias through the intention-to-treat paradigm, attrition bias may have caused an overesti-
mation of clinical effects. For the assessment of individual studies and the reasoning, see
Supplementary Table S2.

3.3. Assessment of Intervention Components

Of the 31 selected studies, 25 were considered to involve interoceptive exposure in their
dCBT content, and the other 6 were not. Four studies were considered to have inhibitory-
learning-based principles or strategies, and five studies were considered to include person-
alized content. The interrater reliability for interoceptive exposure, inhibitory learning, and
personalization in the initial assessment was AC1 = 0.67, 0.79, and 0.84, respectively. For
clinical factor ratings of each study and the reasoning, see Supplementary Table S2.

3.4. Study Characteristics

Table 1 lists the extracted characteristics for the selected studies or groups. Most
dCBTs were performed using computer or mobile applications in non-VR environments.
Most studies included therapist guidance or support. Study locations were mostly Europe
or Oceania, followed by Asia, North America, and Europe and Oceania combined. The
intervention periods ranged from 4 to 12 weeks. The number of sessions of dCBT ranged
from 4 to 16, except for one daily chatbot study. Ten of the thirty-one studies declared
conflicts of interest.

3.5. Overall and Subgroup Effects

Table 2 shows the overall and subgroup effects for passive and active controls. Overall,
the effect sizes of dCBT were significantly higher than passive controls and not significantly
different from active controls. Also, a considerable heterogeneity of effect sizes was ob-
served across studies for passive control, Q(26) = 57.71, p < 0.001, I2 = 52.65%, indicating
considerable heterogeneity in the clinical efficacy across studies. Regarding active control,
no significant heterogeneity was observed, Q(12) = 12.97, p = 0.371, I2 = 1.01%. Figure 3
illustrates forest plots describing the individual studies’ effect sizes and confidence intervals
for passive and active controls.

and higher scores (right) favor control. The gray diamonds indicate the effect sizes estimated by the

For subgroup effects, dCBTs including the hypothesized intervention components
tended to have stronger clinical effects, especially with passive controls, although statis-
tical testing was not performed to avoid Type I errors from multiple comparisons. As
hypothesized, dCBTs with interoceptive exposure, inhibitory learning, or personalization
components tended to have stronger clinical efficacy compared to dCBTs without such
components. However, personalized dCBTs showed lower efficacy against active controls
compared to non-personalized dCBTs. This may have derived from the relatively small
sample size of the dCBT against active control groups, and further studies will be needed
to identify the results more accurately.

Also, despite some numerical differences in effect sizes between subgroups, consid-
erable asymmetry in sample sizes was observed. Since all subgroups included at least
three studies for both controls, meta-regression analyses seemed appropriate; however, the
results should be interpreted with caution because data with uneven covariate distribution
may generate invalid results [69].

3.6. Meta-Regression

Table 3 (above) shows the final model for passive control resulting from the stepwise
procedure. The model indicated a good fit without heterogeneity; Q(5) = 31.82, p < 0.001
for the omnibus test and Q(21) = 25.89, p = 0.211, I2 = 0.00% for residual heterogeneity.
The hypothesized intervention components were all included in this model. Additionally,
therapist guidance and the number of sessions were included. Interoceptive exposure,
therapist guidance, and the number of sessions showed significant confidence intervals, but
inhibitory learning and personalization did not, although the stepwise procedure recom-
mended their inclusion. The insignificant results of inhibitory learning and personalization
in traditional statistics may have resulted from their small sample sizes. The current confi-
dence intervals show limited information about whether dCBTs with inhibitory learning
or personalization may lead to better efficacy; therefore, a supplementary analysis will be
helpful for drawing conclusions.

The supplementary Bayesian analysis suggested the inclusion of inhibitory learning
and personalization in the model. The Bayes factors for all predictors, including inhibitory
learning and personalization, indicated moderate or high evidence for inclusion; therefore,
inhibitory learning and personalization may also increase the clinical effects. The effect
sizes predicted by the meta-regression model for the individual studies are indicated as
gray diamonds in Figure 3.

Table 3 (below) represents the final model for active control deduced by the stepwise
procedure. The final model indicated a good fit without heterogeneity; Q(1) = 5.31, p = 0.021
for the omnibus test and Q(11) = 7.66, p = 0.743, I2 = 0.00% for heterogeneity. Unlike passive
control, only interoceptive exposure was included in the model, and the Bayes factor
indicated strong evidence for the inclusion of this factor. Therefore, inhibitory learning and
personalization did not affect the clinical efficacy of dCBT against active control. Unlike
interoceptive exposure, the effects of inhibitory learning and personalization have to be
confirmed through further studies, considering the small sample sizes included in the
current review.

3.7. Publication Bias

Figure 4 indicates the funnel plots describing the overall effects and meta-regression
models for passive and active controls. Overall, no publication bias was observed through
visual inspections or statistical analyses. For passive controls, Egger’s tests were insignifi-
cant for the overall effect (z = −1.268, p = 0.205) and the meta-regression (z = 0.078, p = 0.938)
models, and the trim-and-fill analysis did not result in any changes to the original results.
For active controls, Egger’s tests were insignificant for the overall effect (z = 0.023, p = 0.982)
and meta-regression (z = −0.218, p = 0.827), and the trim-and-fill analysis did not change
the results.

4. Discussion

This review extends prior knowledge about digital therapy, not only confirming
the clinical efficacy of dCBT but also suggesting intervention components to improve its
effectiveness for panic disorder and agoraphobia. This review used the largest sample
size to date among the quantitative reviews examining digital therapies for panic disorder
and agoraphobia. Overall, it seems that dCBT is effective and equivalent to face-to-face
CBT despite heterogeneity reported across studies. Notably, the ostensibly varied effect
sizes were explained solely by intervention effects, without any external attributes such as
population effects. The clinical components implemented differently across studies, such as
interoceptive exposure, inhibitory learning principle, or personalization, accounted for the
observed heterogeneity. As such, adopting these clinical components or therapist guidance
could improve the efficacy of dCBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia.

The current review confirms the clinical efficacy of dCBT for anxiety disorders, in line
with previous studies [9,10,12]. Notably, our findings suggest that the variability in dCBT
outcomes across studies may be explained, at least in part, by specific intervention com-
ponents. This represents a novel insight not highlighted in earlier research, underscoring
the importance of considering these components when evaluating dCBT for panic disorder
and agoraphobia.

Specifically, this review concluded that the following intervention components may
improve dCBT’s effectiveness. First, interoceptive exposure significantly increased the
clinical effects in passive and active controls. This finding extends Pompoli et al.’s (2018)
results on general CBT to the digital field [12]. As interoceptive exposure is indispensable

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 22   factor indicated strong evidence for the inclusion of this factor. Therefore, inhibitory learn-ing and personalization did not affect the clinical efficacy of dCBT against active control. Unlike interoceptive exposure, the effects of inhibitory learning and personalization have to be confirmed through further studies, considering the small sample sizes included in the current review. 3.7. Publication Bias Figure 4 indicates the funnel plots describing the overall effects and meta-regression models for passive and active controls. Overall, no publication bias was observed through visual inspections or statistical analyses. For passive controls, Egger’s tests were insignif-icant for the overall effect (z = −1.268, p = 0.205) and the meta-regression (z = 0.078, p = 0.938) models, and the trim-and-fill analysis did not result in any changes to the original results.

Discussion This review extends prior knowledge about digital therapy, not only confirming the clinical efficacy of dCBT but also suggesting intervention components to improve its ef-fectiveness for panic disorder and agoraphobia. This review used the largest sample size to date among the quantitative reviews examining digital therapies for panic disorder and agoraphobia. Overall, it seems that dCBT is effective and equivalent to face-to-face CBT despite heterogeneity reported across studies. Notably, the ostensibly varied effect J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1771

for panic and agoraphobia, digital therapies are encouraged to adopt related content,
including programs that have difficulty combining interoceptive components such as VR.
Regarding inhibitory-learning-based exposure, a considerable increase in treatment ef-
fect was identified with passive controls. This is the first meta-analytic review to determine
the effect of inhibitory learning for panic disorder and agoraphobia. Although the number
of studies included was limited, future digital therapies for panic disorder and agoraphobia
may consider applying inhibitory learning, as its effectiveness has been recognized in
clinical fields on robust theoretical bases [16,70]. Digital environments are particularly
suitable for incorporating inhibitory learning strategies automatically, for example, varying
stimuli, situations, or designs [71].

The clinical significance of personalization is germane to the advancement of psy-
chotherapy, represented by precision medicine and a transdiagnostic approach [18,20].
Recently, personalized virtual reality has shown high potential to serve as an effective
exposure environment for patients with panic disorder [72]. Personalization was included
among the components to increase dCBT’s effects for panic disorder and agoraphobia in
the passive control model, but not in the active control. This is roughly consistent with
previous meta-analysis [24]; personalized or tailored CBT may increase clinical effects, but
further exploration is required to draw more reliable conclusions.

Despite the significance of interoceptive exposure, inhibitory learning, and personal-
ization, this review identified that these elements are not yet widely used in dCBTs. Instead,
most of the dCBT programs relied on simple therapeutic techniques such as repeated
exposure or the introduction of imaginal exposure, and most assigned the same fixed
content to all participants. Additionally, dCBTs should pay more attention to establishing
evidence-based principles and optimizing treatment protocols. In particular, we suggest
that clinicians consider applying the three clinical components covered in this review to
maximize the efficacy of dCBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia.

Moreover, therapist guidance or support also increased the effect, although analyzed
post hoc. This result is consistent with previous reviews and meta-analyses indicating its
better clinical outcomes and adherence compared to unguided CBTs [73–76]. Although
many recent digital therapies have pursued automated treatment based on machine learn-
ing or artificial intelligence [77,78], allowing more room for therapists will relieve the
rigidity of inflexible, algorithm-based programs. Governments and policymakers should
carefully consider therapists’ roles when adopting dCBTs as a replacement for conven-
tional therapies.

These findings may have important implications for clinical practice, training, and
patient outcomes. Although further confirmation may be needed, incorporating intero-
ceptive exposure, inhibitory learning, and personalization into routine dCBT protocols
can enhance treatment effectiveness and guide more precise, individualized care. Training
programs should emphasize these key components to equip clinicians with the necessary
skills, ensuring better patient engagement and symptom relief. By applying these insights
in practice, policymakers and healthcare providers can optimize dCBT interventions as a
reliable and scalable treatment option for panic disorder and agoraphobia.

4.1. Limitations

Although this review presented answers to address previous uncertainties, the high
therapist and attrition biases and conflicts of interest in several studies suggest that the
estimated effect sizes should be considered with caution. Although including treatment
components such as interoceptive exposure, inhibitory learning, or personalization re-
moved the numerical heterogeneity values, the treatment efficacy can also depend on other
factors such as patient features (severity of symptoms, clinical stages, etc.) or implementa-

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 1771

16 of 20

tion features (therapist characteristics, environmental/random effects, etc.). Additionally,
methodological issues within this review need to be acknowledged. Researchers argue
that conclusions based on subgroup analyses are being misused without methodological
rigor [79,80]. These criticisms include the improper application of post hoc rather than a
priori analyses conducted outside the randomization control, which leads to inconsistencies
with previous results [79,81].

In this context, the limitations of this review include the intervention components being
retrospectively and only qualitatively assessed by the researchers with certain hypotheses.
As the effect sizes in this review reflect the study effects irrespective of the random allocation
of the study design, the results may have been compounded by variables unrelated to pure
treatment effects. Another issue is that this review only appraised the study quality with a
risk of bias tool without scoring the overall quality with tools like Jadad and incorporating
it in the data synthesis. Moreover, although this review included a sufficient number of
studies overall, the small sample sizes within some subgroups hindered the securing of
sufficient statistical power or offsetting confounders.

4.2. Conclusions and Implications

This review highlights the need for a more evidence-based, organized approach that
effectively leverages the strengths of dCBT to optimize treatment. Interoceptive exposure,
inhibitory learning, and personalization are promising elements that could be applied to
dCBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia. Clinicians may benefit from incorporating these
important treatment principles into dCBT protocols to enhance treatment outcomes and
optimize dCBT interventions for panic disorder and agoraphobia.
