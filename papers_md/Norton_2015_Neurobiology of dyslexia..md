Abstract

Dyslexia is one of the most common learning disabilities, yet its brain basis and core causes are 
not yet fully understood. Neuroimaging methods, including structural and functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and electrophysiology, have significantly 
contributed to knowledge about the neurobiology of dyslexia. Recent studies have discovered 
brain differences prior to formal instruction that likely encourage or discourage learning to read 
effectively, distinguished between brain differences that likely reflect the etiology of dyslexia 
versus brain differences that are the consequences of variation in reading experience, and 
identified distinct neural networks associated with specific psychological factors that are 
associated with dyslexia.

1. Introduction

Developmental dyslexia, an unexplained difficulty in word reading accuracy and/or fluency, 
affects 5–12% of children [1,2]. Dyslexia is associated with many undesirable outcomes, 
including reduced educational attainment and academic self-esteem [3]. Furthermore, 
children with dyslexia tend to read far less outside of school than their peers [4], resulting in 
a widening gap in reading skills. Over the past 15 years, neuroimaging has made visible and 
quantifiable the brain differences that are associated with dyslexia; here, we review progress 
in the past few years in understanding the biological basis of dyslexia at a neural systems 
level.

Reading is a complex and slowly learned skill requiring the integration of multiple visual, 
linguistic, cognitive, and attentional processes. Neuroimaging methods including functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG, and event-related 
potentials or ERPs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG), have revealed the brain regions 
most consistently involved in single word reading. In typically reading adults, these regions 
are lateralized to the language-dominant left hemisphere, and include inferior frontal,

superior and middle temporal, and temporo-parietal regions [5]. In addition, experienced 
readers recruit an area of the left fusiform gyrus, termed the visual word form area (VWFA), 
which becomes preferentially engaged for orthographic (print) processing with reading 
experience [6–8]. This reading network (Figure 1) develops over years as children gain both 
specific reading skills and other abilities relevant to reading (e.g., 9). White-matter pathways 
that connect the components of the reading network can be quantified in size and strength by 
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Major tracts involved in reading include the left arcuate/
superior longitudinal fasciculus, which connects frontal and temporal language regions, the 
inferior longitudinal fasciculus, which connects occipital and temporal lobes, and the corona 
radiata, which connects cortex to subcortical structures [10].

2. Psychological Bases of Dyslexia

Because reading involves multiple linguistic, visual, and attentional processes, it is likely 
that variable patterns of weakness may contribute to reading difficulty across children. 
Although it is unlikely that there is a single causal mechanism of dyslexia, some frequent 
likely causes have been identified (Table 1). The best understood cause for dyslexia is a 
weakness in phonological awareness (PA) for spoken (auditory) language that predicts and 
accompanies dyslexia [11]. Whereas learning a spoken language happens almost 
effortlessly, learning to read requires explicit knowledge and practice. Children must first 
become aware of the phonological structure of words, so that they can map those units of 
sound onto their corresponding printed letters.

A second psychological weakness associated with dyslexia relates to rapid automatized 
naming or RAN (Table 1). Slowness in naming may reflect difficulty in the integration of 
cognitive and linguistic processes involved in fluent reading [12]. Often, children who are 
especially poor readers have weaknesses in both PA and RAN [13], but some children 
exhibit only one of these weaknesses.

A third category of potential causal explanations for dyslexia relates to basic perceptual 
processes that may underlie the more proximal PA or RAN weaknesses, such as temporal 
sampling or processing [14–16], visual-spatial attention [17], or perceptual learning deficits 
[18]. These explanations are more mechanistic, but perhaps because they are more distal 
from reading per se, they are also more debated.

3. Functional and Structural Brain Differences in Dyslexia

Meta-analyses of primary research findings have identified broad patterns of functional and 
structural differences between typical and dyslexic readers. The most common functional 
brain differences, in children and adults, are reduced activations (hypoactivations) in left 
temporal, parietal, and fusiform (VWFA) regions [19–22]. In most cases, these 
hypoactivations arise from comparisons between two tasks or conditions, and thus reflect a 
lack of differential sensitivity to reading demands rather than a broader dysfunction of those 
brain regions. Increased activations in dyslexia are sometimes, but not consistently, 
observed in left inferior frontal and right-hemisphere regions. Variability across these 
findings may reflect differences in reading tasks, ages of participants, diversity among 
dyslexic groups, and other factors. Additionally, structural gray matter differences in

dyslexia tend to co-localize with regions that show functional differences [23], but are also 
observed in the cerebellum, particularly in lobule VI [24, 25]. DTI studies often find reduced 
organization or volume in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, including the arcuate 
fasciculus, and corona radiata fibers [26].

Because most neuroimaging studies of dyslexia have been conducted with children or adults 
who have had years of reading difficulty, it has been impossible to determine whether the 
brain differences are associated with the underlying neurobiological etiology of dyslexia, or 
are instead the consequence of years of altered and often vastly reduced reading experience 
(including compensatory alterations in reading networks). One approach to dissociating the 
cause and consequence of dyslexia in the brain has been to compare dyslexic children not 
only to age-matched typically reading children, but also to “ability-matched” children who 
are years younger than the dyslexic children but read at the same level. Ability-matched 
children are conceptualized as having approximately the same amount of reading experience 
as older dyslexic children. In one such study, dyslexic children exhibited reduced left 
parietal and occipito-temporal activations relative to both age- and ability-matched children, 
suggesting that these hypoactivations were related to the cause of dyslexia (in contrast, left 
prefrontal activations tracked ability level) [27].

A similar design challenged another idea about dyslexia, the magnocellular hypothesis of 
dyslexia. Previously, postmortem evidence from individuals with dyslexia revealed smaller 
magnocellular neurons in the lateral geniculate body [28], part of the visual pathway that is 
associated with motion perception. Accordingly, reduced activation for moving gratings in 
area MT, the cortical region most associated with motion perception, was found in adults 
with dyslexia [29]. When, however, children with dyslexia were examined, their MT 
activations were equivalent to ability-matched younger children, suggesting that the MT 
hypoactivation in dyslexia reflected reading experience [30]. This conclusion was further 
supported by evidence that remediation of the reading difficulty also enhanced MT 
activations in children with dyslexia [30]. These findings suggest that reduced MT activation 
for visual motion in dyslexia is a consequence, not a cause, of dyslexia. Similarly, many 
structural brain differences in dyslexia among age-matched groups were eliminated when a 
group with dyslexia was compared to ability-matched children [31].

Another strategy for identifying brain differences that underlie dyslexia has been the study 
of pre-reading children, typically in kindergarten, for whom brain differences cannot be the 
consequence of altered reading experience. Although pre-reading children cannot have a 
formal diagnosis of dyslexia, children can be identified as at-risk for dyslexia because of 
either a family history of dyslexia, which increases their risk of dyslexia by four times or 
more [32], or low performance on tests of pre-reading skills that tend to predict future 
reading difficulty (e.g., PA or RAN). Often, these children are followed longitudinally to 
determine which at-risk children actually progress to dyslexia.

Several neuroimaging studies have found brain differences preceding formal reading 
instruction in pre-reading children that resemble those observed in older children and adults. 
ERP studies of the mismatch negativity (MMN), an automatic response to an oddball 
auditory stimulus that is reduced in adults with dyslexia, have observed differences between

infants with versus without a family history of dyslexia [33], and infants who do or do not 
develop dyslexia [34, 35]. Thus, the MMN may be a promising early endophenotype of 
dyslexia [36].

In MRI, pre-reading kindergartners with familial risk for dyslexia exhibited reduced bilateral 
occipitotemporal and left temporo-parietal activations for PA [37] and also bilaterally 
reduced grey matter volumes in similar posterior cortical regions [38]. Decreased grey-
matter volumes in prefrontal and parieto-temporal regions were also found in 5- and 6-year-
olds with maternal histories of reading difficulty [39]. In a heterogeneous sample of 
kindergartners, pre-reading children exhibited a positive correlation between measures of 
PA and both the size and microstructural white-matter organization of the left arcuate 
fasciculus [40]. Although it is not yet known which of these children will develop dyslexia, 
these studies support the idea that the most commonly observed functional and structural 
brain differences characterizing dyslexia are present before significant reading experience 
and therefore are more likely causes rather than consequences of dyslexia.

5. Advances in Understanding the Brain Basis of Aspects of Dyslexia

Brain Basis of Phonological Awareness (PA) Deficits

Impaired PA in dyslexia could reflect either a deficit in representing phonetic sounds and/or 
a deficit in access to and manipulation of those sounds (e.g., for mapping phonemes to 
print). Previously, a review of behavioral studies of dyslexia concluded that phonetic 
representations are intact, but access to those representations may be impaired [41]. 
Recently, a neuroimaging study with adults found that phonetic representations, as measured 
by multivoxel pattern analysis of activations in bilateral auditory cortices, were intact in 
dyslexia, but that functional and structural (DTI) connectivity between auditory cortices and 
left inferior frontal gyrus was reduced [42]. These findings favor the interpretation of 
dyslexia as being characterized by weakness in access to otherwise intact phonetic 
representations. Consistent with this conclusion is the finding that children with dyslexia 
exhibited reduced prefrontal activation when engaging in an auditory PA task, but no 
difference in temporal-lobe activation, as compared with both age- and ability-matched 
children [43].

Brain Basis of Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) Deficits

RAN has been partially dissociated from PA as a skill essential for learning to read [12, 13], 
but now there is evidence for a neurobiological distinction between the two skills. A large 
structural MRI study of typical adult readers of Chinese found that phonological decoding 
ability was related to gray matter volume in left perisylvian cortex, whereas naming speed 
was related to volume in a more distributed network across all four lobes [44]. Further, 
functional activation to a PA task differed among groups of children with PA and RAN 
deficits, as predicted by the double deficit hypothesis. Activation in left inferior parietal 
lobule showed a gradient associated with PA ability, whereas activation in right cerebellar 
lobule VI showed a gradient with RAN ability [45].

Brain Basis of Reading Fluency Deficits

For older children with dyslexia who must read longer texts, slow reading is a major 
problem. Both the psychological and brain bases of reduced fluency for connected text, such 
as sentences and paragraphs, have been poorly understood relative to the many studies 
focusing on single-word reading. Two studies, however, examined reading fluency directly 
in dyslexia during fMRI by presenting sentences word-by-word at varying rates and testing 
comprehension, but the two studies reported disparate results [46, 47]. Both studies reported 
that more rapid reading resulted in greater activation of left fusiform cortex in the VWFA 
region. One study reported that children with dyslexia exhibited reduced activation related to 
fluency exclusively in left fusiform gyrus despite no significant differences in 
comprehension accuracy [46]. The other study reported that adults with dyslexia exhibited 
disproportionately worse comprehension accuracy and lesser activation in left prefrontal and 
superior temporal regions as a function of reading speed, but found no group difference in 
the VWFA region [47]. Although the populations and outcomes of the two studies differed, 
they have initiated the analysis of the brain basis of impaired reading fluency in dyslexia.

Brain Basis of Basic Perceptual Processes

Neuroimaging findings have reported neural correlates of atypical basic perceptual 
processes in dyslexia. Successful parsing of the speech signal depends on the ability of left 
auditory cortex to selectively amplify phonemic information in the 30 Hz (low gamma) 
range [48]. MEG revealed reduced entrainment, or synchronization of neural firing, to the 
30 Hz frequency range in dyslexia, as well as reduced left-hemisphere specialization for 
such oscillations [49, 50]. These differences may impede the efficient transfer of acoustic 
information into more abstract phonemic representations. Individuals with dyslexia also 
exhibited reduced neural entrainment in response to linguistic stimuli [51, 52], differences in 
EEG signals that reflect integration of auditory and visual stimuli [53], and greater 
variability of auditory brainstem responses to speech sounds [54].

An advantage of understanding dyslexia in terms of basic perceptual processes is that the 
neural mechanisms of those processes can be studied in animals. Animal research has linked 
dyslexia-associated genes such as KIAA0319 with atypical neural migration [55] and 
impaired speech sound discrimination [55, 56], suggesting that the mechanism by which 
cortical abnormalities result in behavioral deficits is through the disruption of synchronous 
firing in response to oral language [57]. In humans, variation in KIAA0319 and two other 
dyslexia susceptibility genes has been associated with variation in left-hemisphere white 
matter and reading skill [58]. Such research may integrate findings from the genetic, 
cellular, cognitive, and behavioral levels in understanding the core deficits in dyslexia.

6. Conclusion

Progress in understanding the cognitive neuroscience of dyslexia may be approaching 
translation from basic research to intervention for children who will struggle to read. 
Remediation is known to be most effective in beginning readers, so early and accurate 
identification may promote effective intervention for children before they experience 
prolonged reading failure. Neuroimaging has identified biomarkers that enhance or

outperform current behavioral measures in predicting long-term reading outcomes [59–63]. 
With further progress in understanding specific components of dyslexia (e.g., PA, RAN, 
fluency) it may also become possible to develop personalized interventions that target the 
specific patterns of weaknesses that undermine learning to read in individual children.

Evidence for the late MMN as a neurophysiological endophenotype for dyslexia. PLoS One. 
2012; 7:e34909. The authors studied children with dyslexia and their unaffected siblings in order 
to examine genetic effects on the amplitude of the mismatch negativity ERP component. This 
approach breaks ground on characterizing the variety of phenotypes in dyslexia based on new 
insights into their biological bases. [PubMed: 22606227]

Schematic of the aspects of the reading brain in the left hemisphere. The inferior frontal 
gyrus (yellow) and the inferior parietal area (blue) are connected by the arcuate fasciculus 
(green). The fusiform gyrus, which includes the visual word form area, is in red. These 
regions are the most commonly found to be atypical in function or structure in dyslexia.
