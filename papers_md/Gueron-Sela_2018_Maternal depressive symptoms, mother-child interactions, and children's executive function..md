Abstract

This study examined the independent and mediated associations between maternal depression 
symptoms (MDS), mother-child interaction, and child executive function (EF) in a prospective 
longitudinal sample of 1,037 children (50% boys) from predominantly low-income and rural 
communities. When children were 6, 15 and 24 months of age, mothers reported their level of 
depressive symptomatology. At 24 and 36 months of age, mother-child interactions during play 
were rated for warmth-sensitivity and harsh-intrusiveness, and dyadic joint attention and maternal 
language complexity were assessed from a book sharing activity. Children’s EF (i.e., inhibitory 
control, working memory, and set shifting) were assessed at ages 36 and 48 months using a battery 
of six tasks. Results indicated that MDS at ages 15 and 24 months were negatively associated with 
children’s EF at age 48 months. Additionally, harsh-intrusive mother-child interactions partially 
mediated this link. Although warmth-sensitivity, dyadic joint attention and maternal language 
complexity were all longitudinally related to EF, they did not serve as mediating mechanisms 
between MDS and EF. These results were obtained while controlling for multiple demographic 
factors, children’s earlier cognitive abilities, maternal general distress and childcare experiences. 
Findings from this study identify one mechanism through which early exposure to MDS could be 
related to children’s EF.

Accumulating evidence suggests that distal and proximal factors within children’s early 
caregiving environments are associated with the emergence of executive function (e.g., Blair 
et al., 2011; Fay-Stammbach, Hawes, & Meredith, 2014; Hughes & Ensor, 2009). Two 
aspects of the caregiving environment that have received attention in this line of research are 
maternal depressive symptoms (MDS) and mother-child interaction. Exposure to elevated 
MDS during early childhood has been related to lower EF during childhood and adolescence 
(Belleau, Phillips, Birmaher, Axelson, & Ladouceur, 2013; Comas, Valentino, & Borkowski, 
2014; Hughes, Roman, Hart, & Ensor 2013; Pearson et al., 2016). Further, both broad 
dimensions of early mother-child interaction as well as specific experiences and stimulation 
provided within mother-child interactions have been related to children’s EF (Bernier, 
Carlson, & Whipple, 2010; Blair et al., 2011; Cuevas et al., 2014; Fay-Stammbach et al., 
2014; Gueron-Sela et al., 2016; Hughes & Ensor, 2009). However, what remains under-
studied are the independent and mediated links between MDS, mother-child interaction and 
child EF, a line of research with the potential to inform critical prevention and intervention 
programs. Thus, the main goal of the current study was to examine the associations between 
MDS, mother-child interaction during toddlerhood, and child EF at the preschool period. We 
focused our investigation on broad dimensions of mother-child interaction (i.e. warmth-
sensitivity and harsh-intrusiveness), as well as on specific experiences and stimulation 
provided within mother-child interactions that are theorized to support children’s emerging 
executive abilities (i.e., dyadic joint attention, and maternal language complexity).

An additional unique aspect of this study was examining these relations among families 
residing in low-income, rural areas. Rural communities are often characterized by high 
poverty rates, low educational attainment, and reduced formal support services (Vernon-
Feagans & Cox, 2013), all of which have been associated with higher risk for MDS and 
deficits in children’s EF (Brody, Murry, Kim, & Brown, 2002; Raver, Blair, & Willoughby, 
2013). As such, an in-depth understanding of potential associations between MDS, parenting 
and children’s EF is especially relevant within the context of rural poverty.

The Development of EF

It is generally agreed that EF includes three related yet distinct components (Miyake & 
Friedman, 2012): inhibitory control (the ability to inhibit automatic, or prepotent, responses 
to facilitate task completion), working memory (the ability to monitor and update 
information for task relevance), and set shifting (the ability to flexibly switch between tasks 
or mental sets). EF develops rapidly throughout the first 5 years of life, with gradual 
improvements in attention regulation giving way to the emergence of more complex EF 
components (Garon, Bryson, & Smith, 2008). During the first three years, infants gain 
increased voluntary control over attention including the ability to focus on relevant aspects 
of a task, disengage attention when necessary, and sustain attention for longer periods of 
time (Garon et al., 2008). These attentional systems contribute to the child’s ability to 
selectively attend to and focus on specific tasks, a necessary first step in goal-directed 
behavior that underlies EF. The emergence of the executive attention network between 3 to 5 
years of age further supports EF abilities by enabling children to resolve increasing levels of 
conflict (Posner & Rothbart, 1998), such as holding a rule in mind, detecting mismatch 
between dominant and subdominant responses, and responding according to the retained

rule. These advances form a foundation for the development of EF abilities, which rely 
strongly on the ability to resolve conflict. Thus, the toddlerhood period, which coincides 
with the emergence of the executive attention network, may be a period in which children 
are particularly susceptible to environmental experiences that support or hinder their 
emerging cognitive control skills (Camerota, Willoughby, Cox, & Greenberg, 2015; Comas 
et al., 2014).

Maternal Depressive Symptoms and Children’s EF

There is growing evidence for the negative associations between exposure to MDS, 
particularly during early childhood, and later EF ability (e.g., Belleau et al., 2013; Comas et 
al., 2014; Hughes et al., 2013; Pearson et al., 2016). Goodman and colleagues (2011) 
propose that early childhood may be a sensitive period for studying the associations between 
MDS and child outcomes because young children strongly rely on their mothers for external 
regulation of emotion and attention. In support of this claim, Hughes and colleagues (2013) 
found that elevated MDS throughout early childhood (ages 2 to 6 years) were related to 
lower EF abilities at age 6 years. Further, Comas and colleagues (2014) reported that 
whereas MDS during early childhood (ages 3 and 5 years) were a significant predictor of EF 
at age 18 years, MDS during middle childhood (ages 8 and 10 years) were not. However, it 
is unknown whether these relations with EF appear as early as the preschool period, a time 
when EF develops rapidly. Thus, in the current study we focus on the links between 
exposure to MDS during toddlerhood (ages 15 and 24 months) and children’s emerging EF 
at ages 3 and 4 years.

Mother-Child Interaction and EF

Extant literature suggests that both broad dimensions of early mother-child interaction as 
well as specific experiences and stimulation provided within mother-child interactions are 
related to children’s EF during the preschool years (Bernier et al., 2010; Blair et al., 2011; 
Camerota et al., 2015; Cuevas et al., 2014; Devine, Bignardi, & Hughes, 2016; Fay-
Stammbach et al., 2014; Gueron-Sela et al., 2016; Hughes & Ensor, 2009). In order to 
understand the unique contributions of these multiple aspects of children’s interactions with 
mothers, in the current study we focus on aspects of mother-child interactions that earlier 
research suggests may play a role in the development of children’s EF abilities both in terms 
of broad dimensions (i.e. warmth-sensitivity and harsh-intrusiveness), and specific 
experiences and stimulation provided during mother-child interactions (i.e., dyadic joint 
attention, and maternal language complexity).

Warmth-sensitivity and harsh-intrusiveness

It is theorized that a mother’s ability to appropriately interpret and respond to her child’s 
signals contributes to the child’s ability to integrate these experiences into an emerging set 
of self-regulatory skills, which lay the foundation for higher order cognitive control abilities 
in early childhood, such as EF (Posner & Rothbart, 1998; Swingler, Perry, & Calkins, 2015). 
Indeed, previous studies have linked higher levels of maternal sensitivity during toddlerhood 
with later improved performance on EF tasks (Bernier et al., 2010; Gueron-Sela et al., 
2016). Furthermore, warm-sensitive mother-child interactions across ages 7–36 months

positively predicted children’s EF performance at 3 and 5 years of age in several analyses 
that used the current dataset (e.g., Blair et al., 2011; Blair, Raver, & Berry, 2014; Camerota 
et al., 2015).

On the other hand, harsh-intrusive mother-child interactions may impinge on children’s 
ability to exercise control over their attention and to successfully practice goal-directed 
behavior (Graziano, Keane, & Calkins, 2010), which are considered crucial precursors for 
the development of EF (Garon et al., 2008). In support of these notions, previous research 
indicated that harsh-intrusive mother-child interactions across ages 10–36 months were 
negatively related to children’s EF at ages 36 and 48 months (Cuevas et al., 2014; Devine et 
al., 2016). Further, an analysis from the current dataset demonstrated that harsh-intrusive 
maternal behaviors during infancy negatively predicted children’s EF at age 36 months over 
and above the effect of maternal sensitivity (Blair et al., 2011), highlighting that these two 
parenting behaviors make unique contributions to children’s EF.

It is important to note that the previous studies from the current data set focused on broad 
characteristics of the parent-child relationship. In the current study, we aimed to expand 
these previous findings by examining additional aspects of parent-child interactions that 
have not yet been considered within the current data set, namely dyadic joint attention and 
maternal language complexity. The simultaneous examination of both broad dimensions and 
specific experiences and stimulation provided within mother-child interactions can enhance 
our understanding of the multiple ways by which early caregiving can be related to 
development of children’s EF.

Dyadic joint attention

Specific experiences with mother-child interaction, such as social contingency within joint 
attention, may provide an optimal social structure for practicing executive control skills 
(Morales, Mundy, Crowson, Neal, & Delgado, 2005; Raver, 1996). Through these dyadic 
experiences, children learn how to sustain attention and focus on specific tasks (Yu & Smith, 
2016), a necessary first step in goal-directed behavior that underlies EF (Garon et al., 2008). 
For example, dyadic joint attention with the mother during free-play at age 24 months was 
positively related to the use of efficient regulatory strategies in the face of a distressing 
situation (Morales et al., 2005; Raver, 1996). Furthermore, dyadic joint attention with a 
social partner at age 12 months was related to better inhibitory control at age 36 months 
(Vaughan Van Hecke et al., 2012). Together, these lines of research suggest that recurrent 
experiences of dyadic joint attention within the mother-child dyad may be related to later 
executive attention skills. However, it is important to consider that sustained dyadic joint 
attention with the caregiver may reflect the child’s early social applications of executive 
attention skills (Mundy, 2003). Thus, it is important to consider the role of children’s early 
executive abilities when examining longitudinal links between dyadic joint attention and 
children’s EF.

Maternal language complexity

Language input from caregivers is an additional aspect of caregiving that is theorized to 
support the development of children’s EF (Carlson, 2003). During parent–child book sharing

tasks, parents have the opportunity to ask questions and produce abstract utterances that 
stimulate advanced reasoning and metalinguistic awareness (Baker & Vernon-Feagans, 
2015), which in turn may contribute to the ability to monitor and control the use of language 
in the service of employing executive control processes. For example, more elaborative 
parental utterances that were contingent upon the child’s current activity were related to 
better attention set-sifting abilities at age 24 months (Bibok, Carpendale, & Muller, 2009). 
Thus, the complexity of mothers’ language input during mother-child interactions can serve 
as an additional aspect of caregiving that is associated with children’s EF.

MDS, Mother-Child Interaction and Children’s EF

There are four main mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the associations 
between MDS and children’s developmental outcomes, including heritability, dysfunctional 
neuroregulatory systems, exposure to mother’s maladaptive cognitions and behaviors during 
mother-child interactions, and exposure to stressful environments (Goodman & Gotlib, 
1999). As a first step in understanding the mechanisms linking MDS and children’s EF, the 
current study considered the role of mother-child interactions. We elected to focus on this 
potential mechanism because of the established links between mother-child interactions and 
children’s EF, and between MDS and less optimal mother-child interactions.

Mothers experiencing depressive symptoms may find parenting challenging, particularly 
during toddlerhood (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1999). The transition 
from infancy to toddlerhood is marked by a number of changes in children’s mobility, verbal 
ability, and bids for autonomy, making day-to-day interactions more challenging than they 
were at earlier ages (Verhoeven, Junger, Van Aken, Deković, & Van Aken, 2007). Although 
there is variability in the association between maternal depression symptoms and parenting 
behaviors, the affective, cognitive, and physical symptoms that characterize depression (e.g., 
sad mood, loss of interest, fatigue, and poor concentration) may hinder mothers’ ability to 
adjust to these challenging circumstances and to provide appropriate support for children’s 
emerging cognitive and social-emotional skills (Goodman & Gotlib, 1999).

There is evidence that all four aspects of mother-child interactions mentioned above are 
linked to MDS. The presence of depressive symptoms in mothers has been often associated 
with less sensitive mother-child interactions (e.g., Campbell, Matestic, von Stauffenberg, 
Mohan, & Kirchner, 2007). Mothers with depressive symptoms display greater affective 
discoordination in interactions with their infants and toddlers, as well as reduced likelihood 
to repair these errors (Jameson, Gelfand, Kulcsar, & Teti, 1997; Weinberg, Olson, Beeghly, 
& Tronick, 2006). MDS has also be associated with a harsh-intrusive pattern of mother-child 
interaction (Field, 2010). In depressed states, negative affect (i.e., distress, irritability, and 
anger) is increased, which may reduce mothers’ ability to tolerate normative child behavior 
and result in over-reliance on coercive parenting techniques (Lovejoy, Graczyk, O’Hare, & 
Neuman, 2000). For example, MDS has been associated with elevated use of physical 
discipline, as well as heightened levels of conflict, coercion, and hostility during mother-
child interactions in infancy and early childhood (Hoffman & Drotar, 1991; Lovejoy et al. 
2000).

The ability to initiate and maintain dyadic joint attention within a parent-child interaction 
may also be limited among mothers with depressive symptoms. Mothers who experience 
depressive symptoms often appear preoccupied and inattentive to their children’s 
communicative bids, and are less likely to coordinate and focus attention while interacting 
with their toddlers (Goldsmith & Rogoff, 1997). Finally, mothers experiencing depressive 
symptoms also differ in the type of language input they provide to their children, including 
less repetition, fewer explanations, suggestions and questions, and overall reduced lexical 
input (Field, 2010; Rowe, Pan, & Ayoub, 2005).

Maternal Depressive Symptoms and Child EF in the Context of Rural 

Poverty

Dealing with depressive symptoms may be particularly challenging for mothers living in 
rural areas due to the unique challenges associated with rural life, including a restricted 
range of employment opportunities, the absence of a public transportation system, 
difficulties in obtaining physical and mental health services, and high levels of poverty 
(Brody, Jack, Murray, Landers-Potts, & Liburd, 2001; Tickamyer & Duncan, 1990). A study 
conducted by Brody and colleagues (2002) on African American families living in rural 
areas found that higher maternal psychological functioning (i.e. lower levels of depression, 
and higher optimism and self-esteem) was related to more involved and vigilant parenting 
behaviors and higher quality parent-child discussions which, in turn, predicted higher rates 
of planful, goal-directed behaviors in early adolescence (Brody et al., 2002). In the current 
study, we aim to extend this work to examine the links between early exposure to MDS and 
EF in early childhood. It is particularly important to examine the key contexts for children’s 
early EF development, in order to identify possible ports of entry for interventions that can 
enable at-risk, rural children to gain needed readiness skills prior to school entry.

The Current Study

Although there is evidence that MDS have adverse effects on children’s EF (Hughes et al., 
2013), the mechanisms underlying these relations are unknown. Understanding this link is 
crucial, given that deficits in EF may be one of the factors accounting for the wide range of 
cognitive and socioemotional problems evident among children exposed to MDS. The 
current study aimed to address this gap by examining mother-child interaction as a potential 
mechanism for the link between MDS and child EF. To this aim, we employed a multiple 
mechanism approach that enabled us to examine various caregiving experiences that are 
longitudinally related to the development of EF in children.

We hypothesized that elevated MDS during toddlerhood (ages 15 and 24 months) would be 
associated with lower levels of warmth-sensitivity and higher levels of harsh-intrusiveness 
during play, as well as less dyadic joint attention and less complex language input during a 
book sharing activity at ages 24 and 36 months, which, in turn, would be associated with 
children’s lower EF abilities in the preschool period (ages 36 and 48). These time points 
were chosen based on previous research that demonstrated that there are significant age-
related improvements in all three EF components during this time period (Garon et al., 
2008). Finally, in order to examine the specific contribution of MDS during the toddlerhood

Participants

Procedures

The Family Life Project (FLP) is a large longitudinal study of children and families living in 
rural, lower income communities in the United States. Families that lived in two major 
geographical areas of high poverty (including three counties in North Carolina and three 
counties in Pennsylvania) were recruited using a stratified random sampling procedure 
yielding a representative sample of 1,292 families recruited over a 1-year period at the time 
mothers gave birth. Families in poverty in both geographical areas were oversampled and 
African American families were oversampled in North Carolina, ensuring that we had 
sufficient power to test complex questions related to poverty. See Willoughby et al (2013) 
for additional information on recruitment and sampling. The current analyses are based upon 
a subsample of 1,037 children (50% boys) and their biological mothers who completed at 
least one EF assessment when the child was 36 or 48 months of age. In this subsample, 43% 
of the children were African-American, 81% of mothers had obtained a high school degree, 
15% of mothers had a college degree and approximately 76% of the families were below 
200% of the poverty level. This subsample does not differ from the complete sample in 
terms of poverty status at recruitment, child gender, or ethnicity (all p > .05). However, 
mothers in this subsample were less likely to have a high school degree compared to primary 
caregivers in the original sample (χ2(1) = 6.00, p < .05).

Data for the current analysis were collected during home visits when children were 
approximately 2, 6, 15, 24, 36 and 48 months of age. All study protocols were approved by 
the relevant ethical review boards, and appropriate consent was obtained from all research 
participants. At the 2-month assessment, demographic information about the families was 
collected. At the 6, 15 and 24 month assessments, mothers reported about their depressive 
symptoms via self-report questionnaires. At the 24- and 36-month assessments, mothers and 
children engaged in a 10-min semi-structured play interaction where they were provided 
with three puzzles of increasing difficulty. Each mother was instructed that the task was for 
the child to complete, but she could help as needed. The play interaction was video recorded 
and later rated for warmth-sensitivity and harsh-intrusiveness. Mothers and children also 
participated in a book sharing activity in which mothers were asked to “go through” a 
wordless picture book with their children as they normally would, and to indicate to the 
research assistant when the activity was over. Dyadic joint attention was live rated during the 
book sharing activity by a trained research assistant using the Observer software. Maternal 
language input from the book sharing activity was transcribed and rated for language 
complexity. At 36 and 48 months, children completed a battery of EF tasks that consisted of 
measures of working memory, set shifting, and inhibitory control.

Maternal Depressive Symptoms—Mothers reported on their depressive symptoms 
during the 6-, 15-, and 24-month assessments. At 6 and 15 months, MDS were reported 
using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18; Derogatis & Savitz 2000), a validated self-
report measure consisting of 18 items. The six items of the depression scale define a 
spectrum of depressive symptoms such as “feeling blue” in the preceding seven days, and 
are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Ratings across the six 
items were averaged to create a total depressive symptoms score, with higher scores 
indicating more severe MDS (Cronbach’s α = .83). At 24 months, mothers reported 
depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-
D; Radloff, 1977), a 20-item inventory of depression symptoms (e.g., “I felt sad”) rated on a 
4-point Likert scale that ranges from 0 (rarely or none of the time) to 3 (most or all of the 
time). Ratings across the 20 items were averaged to create a total depressive symptoms 
score, with higher scores indicating more severe MDS (Cronbach’s α =.80). Both the CES-
D and the BSI have been widely used in community studies, including samples of low 
income African American mothers (e.g., Brody et al., 2002; Kotchick, Dorsey, & Heller, 
2005). The rates of risk for clinical depression in our sample were relatively low [6% for 
BSI at 6 months and 9% for BSI at 15 months (cutoff ≥ 63), 13% for CESD at 24 months 
(cutoff ≥ 23)].

Mother-Child Interactions

Warmth-sensitivity and harsh-intrusiveness: Mother–child interactions during the play 
tasks at 24 and 36 months were rated using a scheme developed by Cox and Crnic (2002) 
and based on the scheme used in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth 
Development (NICHD SECCYD; NICHD ECCRN 1999). The interactions were rated for 
the constructs of sensitivity, intrusiveness, detachment, stimulation of cognitive 
development, positive regard, negative regard and animation. Global ratings of mothers’ 
behaviors were made on a 1–7 scale, with values ranging from not at all characteristic to 
highly characteristic. Each rater was trained to be reliable with a master rater, and reliability 
checks were completed on approximately 30% of the recorded interactions (ICC > .80 for all 
pairs of raters).

An exploratory factor analysis conducted with oblique rotation (i.e., Promax) suggested that 
the individual scale scores loaded heavily onto two underlying factors that represent two 
dimensions of parent-child interaction: Warmth-sensitivity which included the sensitivity, 
detachment (reverse scored), stimulation of cognitive development, positive regard, and 
animation scales, and harsh-intrusiveness which included the intrusiveness and negative 
regard scales. We created composite scores of warmth-sensitivity and harsh-intrusiveness by 
taking the mean across multiple parenting scales. This two composite score approach has 
been widely used in previous analyses with FLP data (FLP Key Investigators, 2013).

Dyadic joint attention: Mother-child interactions during the book sharing activity were live 
rated by a research assistant to assess joint attention between the mother and the child using 
the Early Attention to Reading Situations rating system (EARS; Feagans, Kipp, & Blood, 
1994). At each time point mothers were given a wordless picture book to review before the

session began. The mother was asked to go through the book and talk to the child about the 
book as she might normally do. After approximately 10 minutes the research assistant (RA) 
would ask the mother to stop if the picture book task had not ended. The RA used a laptop 
computer that was programmed to receive observational ratings every five seconds. The RA 
rated the child’s focus of attention at the 5 second beep into one of 5 mutually exclusive 
categories (i.e., look at book, look at the caregiver, gaze aversion, look at RA/camera, off 
task and joint attention). The joint attention category reflected whether the child’s eyes were 
focused on the same page of the book as the mother’s eyes. For example, when both the 
mother and child looked at the same page of the book at the same time, joint attention was 
rated. Research assistants practiced the rating system with pilot children until acceptable 
reliability was reached with the master rater (Cohen’s Kappas of at least .70). Five selected 
video recordings of the book sharing activity were then rated by the master rater every 6 
months, to confirm and maintain a Cohen’s Kappa of at least .70 for each rater. Because the 
length of the book sharing activity varied, raw frequency scores were converted to 
proportion scores to be used in analyses. We created a mean proportion score at each time 
point that represented the proportion of 5 second intervals in which joint attention was 
observed.

Maternal language complexity: The mother-child book sharing sessions were transcribed 
using the Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts software (SALT; Miller & Chapman, 
1985). Transcribers were trained by a master transcriber, and transcribed 20 mother–child 
sessions that were reviewed by the master transcriber to ensure accuracy. As an ongoing 
check and for training reliability purposes, transcripts were regularly reviewed by the master 
transcriber and discussed at weekly research group meetings to ensure consistency in 
transcription. Further, the master transcriber and the transcribers often conferred over the 
video if it was difficult to transcribe (e.g., due to audio issues or the fact that it is sometimes 
difficult to discern whether the mother is actually using a real word). Thus, consensus was 
employed throughout. Finally, SALT software was used to find any further errors or 
omissions in the transcripts. Each SALT transcript yielded numerous language variables, 
which the SALT software was designed to automatically calculate. Our analysis focused on 
maternal language complexity. Consistent with previous analysis with FLP data (FLP Key 
Investigators, 2013), language complexity was indicated from the mean length of utterance 
(MLU) in morphemes. A morpheme is the smallest meaning unit in the language. Thus a 
word like boy/s and work/ed each contain two morphemes. MLU is calculated as the average 
number of morphemes per utterance.

Children’s EF—The EF tasks were presented in an open spiral bound flip book format at 
the 36 and 48 month assessments. For each task, children first had to pass a set of training 
trials to ensure comprehension of task procedures. The battery of EF tasks included two 
measures of working memory, three measures of inhibitory control, and one measure of set 
shifting. The psychometric properties of this task battery are reported elsewhere 
(Willoughby, Wirth, & Blair, 2012). We have previously demonstrated measurement 
equivalence of the EF tasks as a function of poverty in the current sample (Willoughby et al., 
2012). We also reported similar conclusions for measurement as a function of household 
poverty and caregiver education in a different sample (Willoughby & Blair, 2016).

Working Memory Span (Working Memory): This task was based upon principles 
described by Kane and Engle (e.g., Kane & Engle 2003). Children were shown a picture of a 
house with an animal and a colored circle inside. The children were asked to name and hold 
in mind both pieces of information. Next, the children were shown an empty house and 
asked to recall the animal or color that was previously in the house. The task increased in 
difficulty such that children were required to recall information from up to four houses at a 
time. Responses were summarized as the number of items answered correctly within each 
item set. Although the working memory spam task was administered at all three 
assessments, only the first 11 items were administered at the 36-month assessment (based on 
the results of pilot testing and test burden, the 4-house trials were omitted), whereas all 19 
items were administered at the 48-month assessments.

Pick the Picture Game (Working Memory): The Pick-the-Picture task is a pointing task 
(Cragg & Nation, 2007; Petrides & Milner, 1982) in which children were instructed to touch 
each picture one at a time, so that every picture “gets a turn”. For example, in the 2-picture 
condition, they might see a page of an apple and dog. For the first page, they pick (touch) 
either of the two pictures. For the second page they are requested to pick a different picture. 
Children received two each of 2-picture, 3-picture, 4-picture, and 6-picture sets. Responses 
were summarized as the number of items consecutively answered correctly in each picture 
set beginning with the first item in the set. Through pilot testing, it appeared that the task 
was too difficult for many children at age 36 months; hence, it was only administered at the 
48-month assessment.

Silly Sounds Stroop (Inhibitory Control): This task was based upon the Day/Night Stroop 
task (Gerstadt, Hong, & Diamond, 1994). Children were presented with pictures of a cat and 
dog, and the experimenter asked them to make the sounds of a dog and a cat. The 
experimenter then introduced the Silly Sounds game, in which dogs make the sounds of cats 
and vice versa. Then side-by-side pictures of cats and dogs were presented in random order. 
The experimenter pointed to the first picture and asked what sound this animal makes in the 
Silly Sounds game and then pointed to the adjacent picture and asked the same question. A 
total of 36 pictures were presented. Responses (correct, incorrect) to the first item on each 
page were used for purposes of scoring.

Spatial Conflict (Inhibitory Control): This is a Simon task similar to that used by Gerardi-
Caulton (2000). In this task, the examiner placed a response card, which has a picture of a 
car on the left side and picture of a boat on the right side, in front of the child. The examiner 
then turned flip book pages that depicted either a car or boat. The child was instructed to 
touch the car on his/her response card when the flip book page showed a car and to touch the 
boat on the response card when the page showed a boat (“touch your car when you see a car, 
touch your boat when you see a boat”). Across the first eight trials, cars and boat were 
depicted centrally. These items provide an opportunity to teach the child the task (“touch 
your car when you see a car, touch your boat when you see a boat”). For items 9–22, items 
were presented laterally (e.g., the stimulus was presented on the left side of the test booklet 
and the correct response required that the child touch the left side of his/her response card). 
For items 23–35, cars and boat begin to be depicted contra-laterally (e.g., the stimulus was

presented on the left side of the test booklet and the correct response required that the child 
touch the right side of his/her response card). Items presented contra-laterally required 
inhibitory control from the previously established pre-potent response in order to be 
answered correctly. Responses (correct, incorrect) to contralaterally presented items were 
used for purposes of scoring. At 48 months, task stimuli were arrows rather than boats.

Animal Go/No-Go (Inhibitory Control): This is a standard go no-go task (e.g., Durston et 
al., 2002) presented in a flip book format. Children were presented with a large button that 
clicked when pressed. They were instructed to click the button every time that they saw an 
animal (i.e., go) except when that animal was a pig (i.e., no-go). Each page depicted a line 
drawing of one of seven possible animals. The task presents varying numbers of go trials 
prior to each no-go trial, including, in standard order, 1-go, 3-go, 3-go, 5-go, 1-go, 1-go, and 
3-go trials. Responses (correct, incorrect) to no-go trials were used for purposes of scoring.

Something’s The Same Game (Attention Set-Shifting): This task is based on the Flexible 
Item Selection Task (FIST; Jacques & Zelazo, 2001). In this task, children were shown a 
page containing two pictures that were similar along one dimension (content, color, or size), 
and the experimenter explicitly stated the dimension of similarity. The next page presented 
the same two pictures, and an additional new third picture which was similar to one of the 
first two pictures along a dimension that is different from that of the similarity of the first 
two pictures (e.g., if the first two pictures were similar along the dimension of shape, the 
third card would be similar to one of the first two along the dimension of color or size.) 
Children were asked to choose which of the two original pictures was the same as the new 
picture. Twenty trials were presented (15 at the 36-month assessment). Responses (correct, 
incorrect) to all but the first item were used for scoring (the first item was excluded from 
scoring because incorrect answers were corrected in order to teach the task).

EF Scoring: Consistent with the analytic approach reported in previous reports on the 
current study sample (Willoughby et al., 2012), item response theory (IRT) models were 
used to create expected a-posteriori (EAP) scores for each task at each assessment. EAP 
scores were scaled on a z-score metric, where a value of 0 represented the average task 
performance at the 48-month assessment. Positive and negative values for EAPs refer to 
above and below average scores, relative to age 48 months. The mean EAP score across all 
completed tasks at a given assessment was used as a measure of the child’s EF ability at that 
time point.

Covariates—Ethnicity, family income and maternal education were controlled for based 
on previous research that linked these variables to maternal depressive symptoms, parenting 
behaviors and children’s EF in early childhood (e.g., Bernier, Carlson, Deschênes, & Matte-
Gagné, 2012; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1999). Child sex was controlled 
following previous research showing that boys tend to do worse on tasks of EF (Willoughby 
& Blair, 2016) and are rated as having more EF problems by parents compared to girls 
(Camerota, Willoughby, Kuhn, & Blair, 2016). Child’s ethnicity and sex were reported by 
the child’s primary caregiver at the time of recruitment. Income-to-needs ratio was 
determined using the mothers’ self-reported total household income from all sources when

the child was 15, 24, and 36 months old. Aggregated household income was divided by the 
U.S. poverty threshold for the year (adjusted for family size and household composition) to 
create an income-to-needs ratio for each family at each time point. The average income-to-
needs ratio across 15 to 36 months was retained as a single indicator. Maternal education 
was measured at the 2-month visit and is retained as two binary variables that indicate 
whether the mother had obtained a high school and/or college degree. Given the previously 
demonstrated link between childcare experiences and EF in this sample (Berry, Blair, 
Ursache, Willoughby, & Granger, 2014), we additionally controlled for maternal report of 
total childcare hours, as well as observer reports of childcare quality (HOME; Caldwell & 
Bradley, 1984) in the primary childcare setting at 15, 24 and 36 months. Both of these 
measures were averaged across the three assessments (see Berry et al., 2014 for further 
information about the quality composite). In order to tap into what is unique to EF beyond 
general cognitive functioning, we used the Mental Development Index of the Bayley Scales 
of Infant Development (MDI; Bayley, 1993) at 15 months to control for general cognition. 
Finally, in order to untangle the specific role of depressive symptoms during the toddelhood, 
we also controlled for maternal general distress at 15 months, which was a composite of the 
anxiety, somatization and hostility scales from the BSI (Derogatis & Savitz, 2000) and 
earlier levels of MDS (age 6 months).

Missing Data

Ten percent of children (n=109) had missing EF data at age 36 months, and 7% (n=79) had 
missing EF data at age 48 months. Further, 2% of the children (n = 20) had missing data on 
maternal depressive symptoms from age 15 months, and 4% (n = 42) had missing MDS data 
from age 24 months. Regarding mother-child interaction variables, at 24 months, 7% (n = 
66) of dyads were missing joint attention data, 9% (n = 93) were missing language 
complexity data, and 8% (n = 87) were missing warmth-sensitivity and harsh-intrusiveness 
data. At 36 months, 6% (n = 60) of dyads were missing joint attention data, 6% (n =59) were 
missing language complexity data, and 5% (n = 50) were missing warmth-sensitivity and 
harsh-intrusiveness data. Full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation with 
robust standard errors was used to retain the full sample.

Analytic Plan

Descriptive statistics were computed using SAS version 9.3. Path models were estimated in 
Mplus version 7.31 (Muthén & Muthén, Los Angeles CA). All models were adjusted for the 
complex sampling design (i.e., over-sampling for poverty and African American ethnicity) 
by accounting for probability weight variables in the analysis. We first tested the direct 
associations between MDS and children’s EF by estimating a path model in which 
autoregressive paths across each time point of MDS (6, 15 and 24 months) to EF at 36 
months and 48 months were specified. In addition, direct paths from MDS at both 6 and 15 
months to EF at both 36 and 48 months were specified. This enabled us to examine the links 
between MDS at 24 months and EF at 36 and 48 months of age while controlling for 
previous measurements of MDS, in addition to examining the direct associations between 
MDS at 6 and 15 months and children’s EF. Next, in order to examine the mediating role of 
parent-child interactions we estimated a partial autoregressive cross-lagged (ARCL) panel 
model. Autoregressive paths were specified within measurements of MDS (6, 15, 24

months), warmth-sensitivity (24, 36 months), harsh-intrusiveness (24, 36 months), dyadic 
joint attention (24, 36 months), language complexity (24, 36 months) and child EF (36, 48 
months). Similar to the first model, direct paths between MDS at 6 and 15 months and EF at 
36 and 48 months were also specified. Cross-lagged paths were specified between MDS at 
15 months and the mother-child interaction constructs at 24 months (i.e., warmth-sensitivity, 
harsh-intrusiveness, dyadic joint attention and language complexity), and MDS at 24 months 
and the mother-child interaction constructs at 36 months. All concurrent associations 
between variables within time points were estimated. We followed a theoretically driven 
approach to the inclusion of covariates in the model. That is, the focal variables in the model 
were regressed on the covariates that have been previously found to be related to this 
construct. For example, child EF at age 48 months was regressed on child gender, ethnicity, 
general child cognitive ability, household income, maternal education, total childcare hours, 
childcare quality and general maternal distress. A full description of the paths estimated 
from covariates to the main variables can be found in the supplementary materiel.

Results

Table 1 presents unweighted means, standard deviations, and correlations for all study 
variables.

Direct Links between MDS and Child EF

We first assessed the direct associations between MDS and child EF in a path model. The 
autoregressive paths across MDS time points were significant (β =.17–.57, p < .01). In 
addition, there were significant direct links between MDS at 15 and 24 months and EF at 48 
months (β = −.09, p = .05; β = −.09, p = .03, respectively), as well as an indirect link 
between MDS at 6 months and EF at 48 months through MDS at 15 months (β = −.02, p = .
04) and through MDS at 24 months (β = −.05, p = .05). There were no significant direct or 
indirect link between MDS at all three time points and EF at 36 months. The model fit the 
data well, χ2 (6) = 8.02, p = .23, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .01 (90% RMSEA confidence 
interval: .000 – .047).

The Mediating Role of Mother-Child Interactions

We next tested the direct and indirect associations between MDS and child EF through 
mother-child interactions in a partial ARCL model (Figure 1). Model fit was adequate, χ2 
(61) = 111.53, p < .001, CFI = .98, RMSEA = .03 (90% RMSEA confidence interval: .020 
– .036). There were no longer significant direct links between MDS at 15 (β = −.08, p =.07) 
and 24 months (β = −.05, p =.19) and child EF at 48 months when mediating paths were 
modeled. However, MDS at 15 months was significantly linked to harsh-intrusiveness at 24 
months (β =.17 p =.001), and MDS at 24 months was significantly linked to warmth-
sensitivity at 36 months (β = −.07, p = .008). In addition, there were significant links 
between the mother-child interaction constructs at 36 months and EF at 48 months including 
harsh-intrusiveness (β = −.15, p < .001), dyadic joint attention (β =.08, p =.01) and language 
complexity (β = .06, p = .05). A full description of all paths estimated in the model can be 
found in the supplementary materiel.

Indirect effects—The previous results indicated that MDS at 15 months were associated 
with harsh-intrusiveness at 24 months, which was associated with harsh-intrusiveness at 36 
months, and finally EF at 48 months. These results were suggestive of one possible indirect 
path through which MDS were associated with EF. This indirect path was significant (β=−.
009, p=.01). No other specific indirect paths between MDS and EF were significant.

Sensitivity Analysis

Acknowledging modest rates of clinically depressed individuals in our sample (6% at 6 
months, 9% at 15 months and 13% at 24 months), we re-ran the above models replacing our 
continuous measure of depressive symptoms with dichotomous measures. These 
dichotomous measure indicated whether an individual’s T score on the BSI at ages 6 and 15 
months (cutoff ≥ 63) and/or CESD raw score at age 24 months (cutoff ≥23) were clinically 
elevated. The reference group was comprised of individuals who did not report clinically 
elevated levels of depression. Repeating the above analysis with dichotomous measures of 
depression did not change any of our substantive conclusions. The only meaningful 
difference between the models was that in the dichotomous version of the mediation model, 
MDS at 15 months had both direct (β = −.10, p = .007) and indirect links via harsh-
intrusiveness (β = −.006, p =.03) to EF at 48 months.

Discussion

To our knowledge this study was the first to explicitly examine the longitudinal associations 
between maternal reports of depressive symptoms, multiple aspects of mother-child 
interaction, and children’s EF using a large, predominantly low-income sample of mothers 
and their children residing in rural areas. We found that MDS during toddlerhood were 
negatively linked to children’s EF at the preschool period. In addition, harsh-intrusive 
mother-child interactions during toddlerhood partially mediated this link. Although warmth-
sensitivity, dyadic joint attention and maternal language complexity were all independently 
and longitudinally related to EF, they did not serve as mediating mechanisms between MDS 
and EF.

Consistent with previous research (Comas et al., 2014; Hughes et al., 2013; Pearson et al., 
2016), MDS were related to children’s lower EF. We expand existing findings by 
demonstrating that these links are evident when assessing EF as early as age 48 months. By 
testing the unique links between MDS at three different time points and EF, we also show 
that whereas MDS during toddlerhood (15 and 24 months) were negatively linked with later 
EF, MDS during infancy (6 months) were not. These findings imply that exposure to MDS 
during toddlerhood may be particularly critical for the development of EF. Interestingly, 
MDS at both 15 months and 24 were not directly linked to EF at age 36 months. It may be 
that EF are not fully consolidated by age 36 months (Garon et al., 2008), and thus the 
difficulties in EF associated with MDS may not yet be manifested.

Findings from this study also demonstrate that the link between MDS and child EF is 
partially mediated by harsh-intrusive mother-child interactions. This indirect link is in line 
with the integrative model for the transmission of risk to children of depressed mothers 
(Goodman & Gotlib, 1999). According to this model, the presence of depressive symptoms

in mothers is associated with negative cognitions, behaviors, and affect that limit their ability 
to meet their children’s social and emotional needs. These unmet needs, in turn, impede on 
children’s development of social and cognitive skills (Goodman & Gotlib, 1999). Intrusive 
mother-child interactions are characterized by interventions that are not responsive to 
infants’ affect, state, or interest and are often in direct competition to the infants’ own focus 
of attention (Swingler, Perry, Calkins, & Bell, 2017). Thus, intrusive caregiving behavior 
may create rapidly shifting sources of arousal and stimulation that actively interfere with the 
child’s ability to practice effective control of attention and goal-directed behavior (Gaertner, 
Spinrad, & Eisenberg, 2008; Graziano et al., 2010), which are important building blocks for 
later EF ability (Garon et al., 2008). Although MDS were initially correlated with all aspects 
of mother-child interactions, MDS only predicted harsh-intrusiveness at 24 months and 
warm-sensitivity at 36 months in the path model. It is possible that the initial correlations 
between MDS and dyadic joint attention and maternal language complexity can be explained 
by their mutual links to environmental conditions such as income-to-needs, maternal 
education and ethnicity which were controlled for in the path model. Previous research 
supports this idea by demonstrating that these environmental conditions are related to both 
MDS (Goodman et al., 2011) and mother-child interaction (e.g., Lenuga, Honorado, & Bush, 
2007). Because the links between MDS and these aspects of mother-child interaction were 
non-significant there was no reason to consider them as mediating mechanisms.

Findings from this study demonstrate that all four aspects of mother-child interaction have 
unique longitudinal links to children’s EF. Extending findings from previous research on 
mother-child interaction and EF (e.g., Blair et al., 2011; Blair et al., 2014; Camerota et al., 
2015), dyadic joint attention and maternal language complexity at 36 months were 
independently associated with higher EF at 48 months, after controlling for earlier levels of 
EF and broad dimensions of mother-child interactions (i.e. warmth-sensitivity and harsh-
intrusiveness). These findings support the idea that multiple aspects of parent-child 
interactions can contribute to children’s EF (Bernier et al., 2010; Fay-Stammbach, et al., 
2014; Hughes & Ensor, 2009), highlighting the importance of an integrative approach that 
extends beyond the traditional focus on broad dimensions of parent-child interaction.

Study Limitations and Conclusions

Limitations should be noted when considering the findings from the current study. First, 
although our use of multiple time points and an autoregressive cross-lagged modeling 
approach provides a test of possible causality, our findings are correlational in nature and we 
cannot infer causal link between MDS, mother-child interaction, and child EF. Second, 
although the indirect path between MDS, harsh-intrusiveness, and EF was significant, the 
independent effect size was small, limiting the ability to draw extensive conclusions based 
on these findings. The small magnitude of this effect is not surprising, given that we 
simultaneously estimated multiple indirect paths that involve correlated constructs. Finally, 
this study was a first step in understanding the mechanisms linking MDS and children’s EF. 
As such, we focused on one domain that underlies the link between MDS and children’s EF, 
namely mother-child interactions. Research has identified additional pathways, including 
genetic factors, dysfunctional neuroregulatory systems, and exposure to stressful life events 
(Goodman & Gotlib, 1999) that may also be relevant for understanding this link. Examining

multiple mediating and moderating pathways is an important next step for better 
understanding the risk for EF deficits that is associated with exposure to MDS.

Despite these limitations, the present study has a number of strengths including the use of a 
prospective design, the large and racially diverse sample, the rural setting, and the 
observational measures of mother-child interaction and EF. Our findings expand the 
accumulating evidence on the risk associated with exposure to MDS, as it is the first to 
examine the links between MDS, mother-child interaction and children’s EF. While such 
relations have previously been explored in the context of children’s emotional regulatory 
abilities (e.g., Kam et al., 2011), expanding these findings to the context of children’s 
cognitive regulatory skills is important given that EF is critical to various aspects of 
children’s social-emotional and academic functioning (Raver et al., 2011). The results from 
this study also imply that harsh-intrusive mother-child interactions may be particularly 
critical in the process linking MDS to child EF. These findings may have clinical 
implications, particularly for families residing in rural areas. Efforts should be made to target 
mothers experiencing depressive symptoms in the implementation of intervention programs 
which focus on reducing harsh-intrusive dyadic interactions. Because mothers in rural areas 
often lack the resources to actively seek parenting guidance and support, home-based 
interventions that target mother-child interactions (e.g., Dozier et al., 2006) could be 
particularly beneficial in the context of rural poverty.
