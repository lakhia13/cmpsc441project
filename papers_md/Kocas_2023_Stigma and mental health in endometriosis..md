This  review  provides  an  overview  of  patient  experiences  of  endometriosis,  endometriosis-related  types  and 
sources of stigma pertaining to menstruation, chronic pain, and infertility, and their impact on patients’ mental 
health with particular implications for patient care. Because endometriosis is a complex disease with multifac-
torial etiology, complicated pathophysiology, and a spectrum of clinical features, diagnosis of endometriosis is 
typically a lengthy process, and many patients experience initial misdiagnosis. A hallmark symptom is severe 
menstrual pain with other symptoms including chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. Prior research 
documents that the diagnostic odyssey, complex management, disabling and unpredictable nature of the disease, 
and  painful  symptom  profile  affect  multiple  life  domains  of  patients,  resulting  in  poor  physical,  social,  and 
psychological  functioning  and  clinically-significant  rates  of  anxiety  and  depression  for  many.  More  recently, 
stigma has been recognized as a potent contributor to poor mental health in endometriosis patients, but existing 
research  is  limited  and  largely  atheoretical.  We  identify  major  sources  of  stigma  related  to  endometriosis, 
including menstrual stigma, chronic pain stigma, and infertility stigma, and their likely impact on patients and 
health care provision. An integrative theoretical approach is described to facilitate research on the prevalence 
and  effects  of  endometriosis  stigma  and  their  explanatory  mechanisms,  highlighting  specific  well-validated 
psychological instruments to assess stigma. Implications for patient care are emphasized. Better understanding 
of  stigma  and  mental  health  in  people  with  endometriosis  will  enhance  the  standard  of  care  for  this  patient 
population.   

Introduction 

1 in 10 individuals live with endometriosis, a chronic disease where 
tissue  similar  to  the  lining  of  the  uterus,  the  endometrium,  is  found 
outside  the  womb  [1].  Endometriosis  affects  the  physical,  social,  and 
psychological functioning of patients and has long confounded clinicians 
and  scientists  due  to  its  multifactorial  etiology,  complicated  patho-
physiology,  spectrum  of  clinical  features,  and  diverse  routes  of  man-
agement [2]. Although a definitive etiology of endometriosis is unclear, 
it  is  generally  accepted  that  hormonal,  genetic,  inflammatory,  and 
immunologic processes contribute to manifestation of the disease [1]. 
Endometriosis  patients  have  several  treatment  alternatives  available, 
including  surgical  and  pharmacological  options.  Individuals  respond 
differently  to  these;  some  patients  have  well-controlled  symptoms 
whereas others experience persistent or recurring symptoms. 

Given the wide array of life domains that are affected, it is no surprise 

that endometriosis is associated with mental distress [3–5]. A hallmark 
symptom  of  endometriosis  is  severe  menstrual  pain,  which  can  be 
debilitating.  Therefore,  the  majority  of  endometriosis-related  psycho-
logical studies focus on the impact of menstrual pain in depression [6,7] 
Recently, researchers have highlighted that psychosocial factors such as 
stigma also play a role in mental health distress among endometriosis 
patients [8]. In this review, we provide an overview of endometriosis 
and  its  impact  on  patients’  mental  health.  We  discuss  stigma  sur-
rounding the condition, how stigma affects the care of patients, relevant 
types and sources of stigma, and highlight the need for further system-
atic research on endometriosis, stigma, and mental health. 

Clinical features 

Endometriosis is a complex disease and its presentation in patients is 
heterogeneous.  Menstrual  pain  is  its  signature  symptom  [1].  Other

common symptoms include chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, dysmen-
orrhea  and  abnormal  menstruation,  infertility,  and  gastrointestinal 
discomfort.  Symptoms  can  start  as  early  as  menarche  and  last  until 
menopause  [2].  Yet  the  intensity  of  pain  does  not  correlate  with  the 
severity of disease. Clinically, the severity of disease is determined based 
on number of endometrial lesions and their depth and classified from 
Stage I to Stage IV [1,2]. Some patients may have agonizing pain with 
mild disease, whereas others may experience mild discomfort with se-
vere  disease  [1,9].  Others  may  become  aware  of  endometriosis  only 
after multiple attempts to conceive, when they seek fertility services. 

Common comorbidities include migraine, irritable bowel syndrome 
(IBS),  chronic  fatigue  syndrome,  fibromyalgia,  uterine  fibroids,  and 
ovarian cysts [1]. Endometriosis is characterized by a chronic inflam-
matory process primarily affecting pelvic tissues, involving the uterus, 
fallopian  tubes,  ovaries,  peritoneum,  and  in  the  spaces  between  the 
bladder, uterus, and vagina [2], although the disease can also be found 
outside the pelvic cavity. 

Diagnosis and clinical management 

On average, patients spend 7–10 years searching for a diagnosis, and 
75% experience initial misdiagnosis [10,11]. Misdiagnosis is a result of 
low awareness among the public and medical community [12]. Some 
patients delay medical care as they are unaware of endometriosis and 
believe their painful menstrual periods are normal [12,13]. For patients 
that do seek medical care, an abundance of research indicates that they 
are often dismissed by medical providers, who may normalize their pain 
and attribute their symptoms to psychological causes [12,14]. 

A definitive endometriosis diagnosis can only be confirmed through 
biopsy [1]. Receiving a pathology-confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis 
is a turning point for all patients, but is particularly validating for those 
who  have  been  dismissed  by  medical  professionals  [12,14].  Seeing  a 
photo or video of their lesions confirms the reality of patients’ pain. That 
said, the invasive nature of a biopsy and its cost are prohibitive for some 
patients. 

Strategies to manage endometriosis include medical treatments such 
as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, combined estrogen-progestin 
hormonal contraceptives, progestins, and other hormone treatments, as 
well  as  laparoscopic excision  surgery,  which must  be performed  by a 
physician specialist [1]. While the majority of patients obtain pain relief 
through these treatments, others continue to experience some level of 
pain. For those using medical therapies, 11–19% report no pain relief 
and  5–59%  report  that  they  continue  to  experience  some  degree  of 
persistent pain after they have terminated treatment [15]. Patients who 
opt for laparoscopic excision surgery have disease recurrence rates as 
high  as  30–50% [16].  It  is  believed  that  several  factors  contribute  to 
chronic  pain  despite  treatment,  including  1)  incomplete  excision  of 
endometriosis  lesions  during  surgery,  resulting  in  post-surgical  accu-
mulation  of  endometrial  tissue,  2)  central  sensitization,  and  3)  other 
comorbid conditions [1]. 

Endometriosis and psychological distress 

The endometriosis disease trajectory can be extremely taxing – both 
physically and mentally. While each patient experience is unique, the 
time and energy spent searching for a diagnosis, along with the disabling 
and  unpredictable  nature  of  the  disease,  generally  lead  to  significant 
disruptions  in  multiple  domains  of  life  [11,17].  Disturbances  to  re-
lationships  with  friends,  families,  and  partners  are  common.  For 
example,  50–56%  of  women  report  that  endometriosis  affected  their 
intimate  relationships, with 8–10%  cases resulting  in a  break-up [18, 
19].  Many  individuals  also  experience  substantial  interference  with 
their education and jobs, as they must cease working, take sick leave, or 
are unable to perform their jobs or school work adequately [18,20]. One 
study  revealed  that  on  average,  every  week,  each  person  with  endo-
metriosis loses 6 h of productivity at work [21]. Difficulties at work are 

complicated by employers and colleagues who do not understand the 
disease  and  by  workplace  policies  that  do  not  provide  necessary  sick 
leave [20]. Disruption to employment, coupled with the cost of treat-
ment of endometriosis also result in financial burden for some patients 
[13]. 

Given the wide array of life domains that are affected, it is unsur-
prising  that  endometriosis  can  greatly  affect  mental  health.  Rates  of 
anxiety and depression among endometriosis patients are consistently 
higher  when  compared  to  healthy  controls  [3–5].  Women  have 
described  feeling  miserable,  angry,  frustrated,  helpless,  hopeless,  and 
defeated [13], with some even contemplating suicide [18]. The mental 
health consequences are in part due to the physical effect of the disease 
but also by the ways in which patients are treated by others with respect 
to their condition [22], including dismissal, diagnostic delay, and inef-
fective treatment. Many are concerned about their future ability to cope 
with the disease as the recurrence of symptoms is unpredictable [12,13]. 
Pain resulting from endometriosis is a key driver of disruptions to 
quality of life [23] and mental health [4,5,7]. Women with endometri-
osis and chronic pelvic pain (CPP) have higher rates of mental distress 
when  compared  to  women  with  endometriosis  with  no  CPP  [24]. 
Additionally,  higher  pain  intensity  is  associated  with  higher  levels  of 
mental distress [7]. The temporal relationship between chronic pain and 
mental health distress is likely bidirectional. That is, while depression 
and anxiety increase the risk of developing chronic pain, chronic pain 
also increases the risk of depression and anxiety [25]. 

Stigma and endometriosis 

Although there is an abundance of research examining the impact of 
endometriosis  symptoms,  pain,  and  physical  functioning  on  mental 
health  and  quality  of  life,  less  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  social 
factors that contribute to wellbeing in endometriosis patients, particu-
larly stigma. Recently, scholars have highlighted that stigma plays an 
important role in the mental health of endometriosis patients and have 
called for more research [8]. 

Goffman’s early work remains highly influential in defining stigma 
[26]; he describes stigma as a “deeply discrediting” and socially unde-
sirable attribute. It is a stain or mark that sets people apart from others 
and labels them as having a defect of body or character that spoils their 
appearance or identity. Conceptualization of stigma has evolved some-
what over time, informed by Goffman’s foundational work [27–29]. For 
example, in a particularly well-articulated, integrative approach, Bro-
han et al. [27] suggest that stigma has three elements: perceived stigma, 
experienced stigma, and self-stigma. Perceived stigma is what an individual 
believes “most people think about the stigmatized group in general” and 
“how  each  individual  believes  society  views  him  or  her  personally 
because he or she is a member of the stigmatized group” [28] (p. 414). 
Thus, perceived stigma also includes fear of discrimination and unfair 
treatment [29]. In contrast, experienced stigma includes “actual instances 
of stigmatization and discrimination due to one’s status as a member of a 
stigmatized  group”  [28]  (p.  414).  Self-stigma  involves  the  negative 
consequences  of  perceived  and  experienced  stigma.  It  occurs  when 
members  of  a  stigmatized  group  accept  and  internalize  the  negative 
attitudes  and  stereotypes  towards  their  group  and  themselves. 
Self-stigma  often  manifests  in  emotions  such  as  shame,  blame,  hope-
lessness, and guilt [30]. 

These levels of stigma have been studied in multiple chronic health 
conditions, including human-immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C, 
serious  mental  illness,  substance  use,  obesity,  and  diabetes.  In  these 
conditions,  stigma  has  been  shown  to  be  associated  with  numerous 
constructs  important  for  mental  health,  including  hopelessness, 
depression, suicidal ideation, weak social support/integration, and low 
self-esteem, self-efficacy, and life dissatisfaction [31]. 

Only a handful of studies have been conducted on stigma in endo-
metriosis, and most of these focus on stigma associated with menstrual 
pain or menstruation itself. There is a long-standing history of menstrual 

EuropeanJournalofObstetrics&GynecologyandReproductiveBiology:X19(2023)1002282H.D. Kocas et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

stigma  across  cultures  [32,33].  Thanks  to  initiatives  that  challenge 
menstrual stigma, attitudes are changing; however, negative depictions 
of menstruation have not disappeared completely [34]. Laws [35] noted 
that  negative  portrayals  of  menstruation  have  influenced  individuals 
who  menstruate  to  develop  “menstrual  etiquette”  –  rules  around  the 
management of menstruation –  because of a fear of discrimination. In 
other words, the stigma surrounding menstruation leads individuals to 
develop  rules  which  govern  what  is  and  what  is  not  discussed  about 
menstruation, and where it is acceptable to discuss: in physician offices, 
among female friends and family, or in health education classes. Evi-
dence shows that these rules persist in society; a recent editorial in The 
Lancet notes: “In the UK, nearly 80% of adolescent girls have experi-
enced  concerning  menstrual  symptoms  (such  as  unusually  heavy  or 
irregular bleeding) but hadn’t consulted a health professional; 27% of 
those said they were too embarrassed to discuss the topic” [36] (p. 1). 
Experimental  studies  corroborate  that  menstruating  individuals  can 
experience discrimination [37] and internalize stigma, leading to feel-
ings of powerlessness [38]. 

In  Seear’s  [39]  interviews  with  20  endometriosis  patients  in 
Australia,  participants  faced  discrimination  for  revealing  menstrual 
symptoms. After disclosing their menstrual symptoms to family mem-
bers, romantic partners, friends, employers, and medical providers, their 
pain was normalized or trivialized. Some were accused of malingering, 
for example, to avoid work or sex with their partners, and their abilities 
to perform their jobs effectively were questioned. Seear [39] suggests 
that stigmatization of menstruation plays a critical role in the stigma-
tization of endometriosis. Similar results were observed in a study [40] 
involving  focus  groups  in  Puerto  Rico.  Patients  disclosed  feeling  that 
others  did  not  view  endometriosis  as  a  serious  health  condition, 
expressing that their menstrual symptoms were normalized and invali-
dated.  People  viewed  them  as  “changuería”,  a  term  used  to  label 
someone as a whiner or complainer without an apparent reason. Mat-
ías-Gonz´alez  and  colleagues  [41]  sought  to  understand  stigma  in 
endometriosis quantitatively and found that endometriosis stigma was 
associated with higher endometriosis symptomatology, as well as lower 
quality of life and lower self-esteem in Latin American and Caribbean 
patients. 

Furthermore,  Gupta  et  al.  [42]  conducted  focus  group  discussions 
with adolescents in the general population in New York City to under-
stand their attitudes and reactions to people with endometriosis symp-
toms.  Participants  were  presented  with  a  variety  of  vignettes,  each 
highlighting  different  symptoms  suggestive  of  endometriosis.  Across 
groups, there was consensus that such symptoms, such as debilitating 
menstrual  cramps,  were  stigmatized.  The  authors  discuss  how  stigma 
leads to isolation and lack of social support, either because others fail to 
provide  support  as  they  normalize  and  invalidate  endometriosis  pa-
tients’ symptoms, or because patients choose not to disclose symptoms. 
They  argue  that  normalization  and  invalidation  can  lead  patients  to 
doubt  their  own  symptoms,  and  discourage  patients  from  seeking 
medical  attention.  In  fact,  a  UK-based,  patient-focused  endometriosis 
charity  recently  reported  that  62%  of  women  with  endometriosis 
delayed seeking medical advice for fear of being dismissed, invalidated, 
or embarrassed, or because they felt their symptoms were normal [43]. 
47% of respondents were concerned about telling their employer that 
they needed sick leave due to endometriosis. 

Although  many  of  the  existing  studies  on  endometriosis  stigma 
described above focus on menstrual pain and menstrual stigma, chronic 
pain  is  also  stigmatized.  Given  that  endometriosis  is  associated  with 
chronically painful menstruation, sex, and pelvic symptoms, pain stigma 
can  contribute  to  endometriosis  stigma  and  poorer  mental  health  as 
well. Chronic pain is well documented within the endometriosis litera-
ture,  and  while  the  stigma  of  chronic  pain  is  implied,  it  is  often  not 
explicitly discussed. Scholars have argued that pain is frequently stig-
matized and dismissed because it is subjective, invisible, and often not 
measured using standardized procedures [44]. The subjectivity leads to 
doubt,  which  is  intensified  when  pain  reports  are  unaccompanied  by 

medical findings. De Ruddere et al. [45] demonstrated that pain patients 
with  medically  unexplained  symptoms  are  more  likely  to  be  socially 
excluded – people are less sympathetic, are less likely to offer help, and 
less willing to interact with them than with patients who have medically 
explained symptoms. Moreover, women’s pain is more likely to be dis-
missed  than men’s pain  [46].  Pain  associated  with sex  is  particularly 
vulnerable to stigma given the private nature of this topic [47]. Pain 
stigma has been linked to anxiety and depression [48]; thus, it is likely 
that  stigma  associated  with  the  chronic  pain  experienced  by  many 
women  with  endometriosis  also  contributes  to  stigmatization  of  the 
disease and suboptimal mental health. 

Additionally, infertility stigma is a likely contributor to endometri-
osis stigma and poorer mental health in people with endometriosis, as up 
to half of endometriosis patients experience infertility [49]. While it is 
generally accepted that more advanced stages of the disease, Stages III 
and  IV,  cause  infertility,  the  connection  between  endometriosis  and 
infertility is less clear in Stages I and II [50]. 

Although the experience of infertility differs cross culturally and is 
related to differences in gender norms [51], infertility stigma appears to 
be a universal experience as the norm across cultures is for humans to 
reproduce.  Regardless  of  the  primary  source  of  infertility,  the  female 
partner is often perceived to have fertility problems [52]. Women that 
deviate from the gendered role of motherhood may be labeled as defi-
cient and defective. Participants in Taebi et al.’s [53] qualitative study 
in Iran discussed how a common belief is that a childless house is “cold 
and spiritless” (p. 191). Participants expressed feeling humiliated due to 
degrading looks and comments from others, primarily other women. In 
Ghana, women described being called a “witch,” “barren,” and as pos-
sessing “spirits,” sometimes leading to exclusion from important events 
[52] (p. 7). Some of them also experienced intimate partner violence in 
the form of verbal abuse and physical abuse. In the U.S., women have 
described  receiving  “unnecessary  attention”  [54]  for  not  having  chil-
dren,  unsolicited advice  such as herbal remedies  and sex  positions to 
facilitate conception, and being told they need “only relax” to become 
pregnant, originating from the mistaken belief that infertility is caused 
by a woman’s emotional state [55]. Infertility stigma has been linked 
with  depression  and  anxiety  [51,56].  While  research  on  the  role  of 
infertility  stigma  in  endometriosis  is  lacking,  given  the  prevalence  of 
infertility in endometriosis patients and findings from infertility studies, 
infertility stigma is a likely contributor to stigma and poor mental health 
in endometriosis. 

In  summary,  research  demonstrates  that  stigma  influences  mental 
wellbeing and that it deserves more attention in endometriosis, given 
that mental distress is common among endometriosis patients. Stigma at 
all  levels  –  including  perceived  stigma,  experienced  stigma,  and  self- 
stigma – has been found to influence wellbeing in a variety of chronic 
illnesses.  Although  research  on  stigma  in  endometriosis  is  sparse,  it 
already shows that stigma is prevalent. Existing studies focus on stigma 
surrounding menstruation, yet research on the experience of endome-
triosis  shows  that  chronic  pain  and  infertility  –  conditions  that  are 
frequently stigmatized – are also common among patients. Therefore, in 
addition to menstrual stigma, it is likely that chronic pain and infertility 
stigma are contributors to the overall stigma experienced by individuals 
with endometriosis. However, the prevalence of these types of stigma 
and their particular impact on mental health in endometriosis patients is 
presently  unknown.  Patient  stigma  and  poor  mental  health  can  be 
serious  impediments  to  health  care.  Clearly,  more  work  is  needed  to 
elucidate the relationship between stigma and mental health in endo-
metriosis; the next section focuses on future directions for research. 

Future directions 

Existing studies of endometriosis-related stigma have made impor-
tant contributions to a field where rigorous research is lacking. How-
ever,  there  remains  much  room  for  improvement.  First,  a  better 
understanding of endometriosis stigma, and how stigma associated with 

EuropeanJournalofObstetrics&GynecologyandReproductiveBiology:X19(2023)1002283H.D. Kocas et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

menstruation,  chronic  pain,  and  infertility  independently  and  jointly 
influence  endometriosis  stigma,  is  needed.  Expanding  research  on 
endometriosis stigma beyond its prior focus on menstrual pain will allow 
for a deeper appreciation of stigma in endometriosis and its impact on 
mental health. This type of research can be enhanced by incorporating 
clearer,  theoretically-based  definitions  of  stigma,  including  differenti-
ating perceived, experienced, and self-stigma. Applying stigma theory to 
research will help identify the mechanisms through which stigma acts to 
influence mental health. Studies can be designed to understand how the 
different  levels  (perceived,  experienced,  and  self-stigma)  or  types 
(menstrual,  chronic  pain,  and  infertility  stigma)  of  stigma  produce 
poorer  mental  health.  Endometriosis-specific  stigma  scales  would  be 
especially  valuable  to  conduct  such  research.  The  Stigma  Scale  for 
Chronic Illness (SSCI) [57], for example, is a validated, 24-item scale to 
measure experienced stigma and self-stigma in individuals with chronic 
illness.  Respondents  rate  their  agreement  with  statements  such  as 
“Because  of  my  illness,  some  people  avoided  me,”  on  a  Likert  scale. 
Matías-Gonz´alez and colleagues used the 8-item short form of this scale 
and adapted it to the endometriosis population [41]. Adapting the full 
version of the SSCI to the endometriosis population will allow for a more 
nuanced understanding of how the different levels of stigma affect pa-
tients.  Such  an  endometriosis-specific  stigma  scale  can  then  be  used 
together  with scales that examine menstrual,  chronic pain, and  infer-
tility stigma, to better understand how they contribute to the experience 
of endometriosis. Several validated scales already exist; the Menstrual 
Self-Evaluation  Scale  (MSES)  [58],  Chronic  Pain  Stigma  Scale  (CPSS) 
[59], and Infertility Stigma Scale (ISS) [60] are excellent options that 
can be adapted to study endometriosis. 

There is evidence that endometriosis patients delay seeking medical 
care due to the stigma associated with their symptoms [43]. For those 
who do visit a care professional, it is common for their symptoms to be 
normalized  and  invalidated  [12,14].  Thus,  endometriosis  stigma  in-
terferes  with  patient  care-seeking  and  the  quality  of  care  that  they 
receive.  Better  understanding  of  stigma  and  mental  health  in  people 
with  endometriosis  will  enhance  the  standard  of  care  for  this  patient 
population.  Additionally,  physicians  can  help  to  raise  awareness  of 
endometriosis among the general public to help reduce stigma, and can 
discuss the influence of stigma on mental health with patients and guide 
them,  when  needed,  to  seek  appropriate  mental  health  services  and 
support. Elucidating the sources of stigma that endometriosis patients 
experience and the mechanisms through which stigma influences their 
mental health can also be used to improve interventions focused at in-
dividual, community, and societal levels. 

Conclusion 

The  present  article  provides  an  overview  of  existing  research 
examining how stigma influences the mental health of individuals living 
with endometriosis, and identifies gaps in current knowledge. Stigma is 
an important, but under-studied dimension of the experience of endo-
metriosis, and an important target to improve the wellbeing of patients 
and the clinical care provided to them. In order to achieve this, research 
must be expanded to obtain a fine-tuned understanding of how stigma 
influences  patients’  experience.  The  standard  of  care  can  only  be 
improved when addressed at multiple layers – including the medical as 
well as the psychosocial.
