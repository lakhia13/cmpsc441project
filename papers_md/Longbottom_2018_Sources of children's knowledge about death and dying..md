In the last century, decreases in infant and child mortality, urbanization and
increases in healthcare efficacy have reduced children’s personal exposure to
death and dying. So how do children acquire accurate conceptions of death
in this context? In this paper, we discuss three sources of children’s learning
about death and dying, namely, direct experience of death, parental com-
munication about death and portrayals of death in the media and the arts.
We conclude with recommendations about how best to teach modern
children about this aspect of life.

This article is part of the theme issue ‘Evolutionary thanatology: impacts

of the dead on the living in humans and other animals’.

1. Introduction
Over the last hundred years, improvements in public health and modern medi-
cine have led to decreased mortality rates, particularly in children and young
adults [1]. Prior to the twentieth century, death was most commonly experi-
enced at home, following a short illness or as a result of workplace accidents
[2]. The highest mortality rates were found in children and infants, but it was
not uncommon for adults to die while still in the prime of life [1,2]. When a
death occurred outside the home, the body was typically held in the home
for traditional rituals (e.g. wakes) before burial or cremation [2,3]. Extended
families lived in close proximity, so death was encountered and mourned by
a close-knit community that included children.

Recent changes to family structures and compositions, and greater geographi-
cal mobility reducing contact with extended family has resulted in a significant
decline in mourning rituals (for example, traditional Irish wakes at home [4]), par-
ticularly in Western societies [1–4]. This trend is also being increasingly
experienced in many traditional cultures as a result of increasing globalization
and a shift from traditional rites and ceremonies to more modern social norms
(see, for example, Jacob et al. [5]). As a result, children, and even young adults,
have become increasingly isolated from the realities of death in everyday life.

Coincidently, there have been significant changes to attitudes concerning how
children should be raised [1] and this includes attitudes about exposing children
to death and dying [6,7]. Overall there has been a marked shift in Western
societies from the stance that death is a ‘natural part of life’ to an attitude of pro-
tecting children from the realities of death [6,7]. This attitude was documented by
Miller et al. [7] in their interviews with Mid-Western American parents and tea-
chers of 3- to 6-year-old children. These adults expressed the views that their
children were cognitively and emotionally too immature to comprehend and
cope with death, and thus should be actively shielded from its realities.

For researchers investigating children’s death concepts, the protectionist trend
is highly pertinent. It is increasingly difficult to carry out research because ethical
review boards, education departments, individual teachers and parents often
reject researchers’ requests to investigate children’s understanding of death. Yet
it is essential to understand where and how modern children learn about death
and dying both from a basic research perspective and as a basis for educational
and clinical intervention. Here we examine three main sources of information
about death and dying that children access: direct exposure to death, parental

communication about death and depictions of death and
dying in the media. We conclude with suggestions for further
research and recommendations for how best to teach modern
children about death and dying.

2. Assessing children’s understanding of death
Death is a complex concept to grasp as it has interweaving
biological, socio-cultural, spiritual and emotional elements.
To assess children’s understanding of death, researchers typi-
cally adopt a cognitive perspective focusing on children’s
recognition of death as a biological event [8– 12]. In this tra-
dition, a mature death concept is measured and defined in
terms of several sub-concepts. While the terminology may
vary from study to study, the most commonly assessed
sub-concepts are:

(1)

(2)

Irreversibility/permanence: the understanding that death
is a permanent state from which there is no return to life;
Inevitability/universality:
the understanding that all
living things must die eventually;

(3) Applicability: the understanding that only living things

can die;

(4) Cessation: the understanding that all bodily processes

cease to function upon death; and

(5) Causation: the understanding that death is ultimately

caused by a breakdown of bodily functions [11].

immature

irreversibility or

Early researchers sometimes classified afterlife reasoning
(e.g. asserting that ‘the dead can think and feel’) as evidence
of
cessation sub-concepts.
However, in the last decade, research on the development of
spiritual and/or religious beliefs about the afterlife (e.g. [13])
has confirmed that spiritual conceptions of death are develop-
mentally distinct from biological [13–16] ones. Children’s
biological concepts of death are typically mastered first, and
then spiritual elements are layered on top, leading to an
adult pattern of sophisticated understanding of the biological
reality of death coexisting with belief in an afterlife for the
mind or soul [13–16]. This may explain why individual differ-
ence studies typically have found minimal effects of specific
religious beliefs or levels of religiosity on children’s biological
understanding of death [17–19].

This review will focus on how children acquire a biological
understanding of death. Research in this tradition indicates
that the sub-concepts are acquired in a relatively consistent
developmental pattern that follows the numbered list above.
Irreversibility is almost always understood first, as early as
age 3, and causation is acquired last, usually by age 8. This gen-
eral pattern is evident even across diverse cultural groups
[18,19]. Within this broadly normative pattern of acquisition,
ecological and individual factors influence the order of acqui-
sition for inevitability, applicability and cessation, as well as
the developmental timetable for understanding death as a
whole [8,9,11,12,20]. Hesitancy around investigating children’s
understanding of death means that experimental or training
studies are almost non-existent. Therefore, most of what we
know about how children learn about death comes from indi-
vidual differences studies correlating subject or environmental
variables with children’s mastery of death sub-concepts. The
most common variable included in such investigations is
children’s direct experience of death.

3. Direct experience of death
Intuitively, the maturity of children’s death concepts should be
associated with their first-hand experience. However, the data
are inconsistent on this. Whereas many studies report that
experience with death increases children’s death understand-
ing (see Speece & Brent [21] for a review), some report no
association [10,22] or even a negative association [8]. One
reason for the lack of consensus could be varying definitions
of what ‘experience’ constitutes [23]. Experience of death is
measured via child self-report, parent or teacher report, and
can include one or more of: (a) death of an immediate family
member or close friend, (b) death of an extended family
member, acquaintance or family friend, or (c) death of a pet
[8,9,24,25]. Additional variables such as closeness of the
relationship, extent of physical exposure to the corpse, involve-
ment in funerary rituals etc. are almost never included yet
individual differences in these specific experiences are likely
to be important to children’s understanding. Another reason
for the mixed findings may be that the association is age-
dependent: it appears that direct experience predicts children’s
death concepts for children up to the age of 6 years [26], but not
for older children.

Alternatively, the association between direct experience of
death and children’s death concepts may be mediated by par-
ental communication. Parents report that an experience of
death is one of the most significant factors influencing their
decision to talk to their children about death [24,27]. As we
discuss below, parental input appears to be a significant
predictor of children’s understanding.

Although exposure to death and/or corpses is arguably the
most powerful source of learning about death [28], there may
be other experiences that influence children’s understanding
of death indirectly. For example, children’s concepts of death
are developmentally intertwined with their concepts of life
and the life cycle [20,29], such that learning about one auto-
matically promotes development of the other [12]. Numerous
studies indicate that contact with the natural world is posi-
tively associated with development of various biological
concepts, many of which are conceptually related to death
and dying (for a complete review, see Longbottom & Slaughter
[30]). Thus it stands to reason that experience with cycles of
nature and living animals also plays a role in children’s under-
standing of death, although so far no research has been
conducted to test this assumption.

4. Parental communication about death and

dying

What children know and learn is grounded in what their
parents teach them. This includes children’s developing under-
standing of biology and the natural world [31], with numerous
studies demonstrating the influence of parental communication
on concepts such as natural life cycle changes and metamor-
phoses [32], genetic inheritance [33] and human–animal
categorization [34,35].

Clinical psychologists and bereavement experts emphasize
the importance of talking to children about death from an early
age in an honest and informative way, and to portray death as a
natural part of the life cycle (e.g. [36–38]). These same sources
express concern that many parents do not discuss death in
depth with their children until the issue is forced by the

death of a close relative, friend or pet [8,10,34,35]. A survey of
270 American parents of 4–6-year-old children revealed that
parents were least comfortable talking with their children
about death, when compared with talking about other biologi-
cal topics including reproduction, life processes, ageing and
illness [39]. Although it should be noted that these parents’
average response for discussing death fell between ‘comforta-
ble’ and ‘somewhat comfortable’. Another issue is that
parents’ communications about death can be misleading; the
use of euphemisms (‘she’s passed on’ or ‘we lost her’) can actu-
ally be detrimental to young children’s understanding, because
these forms of expression avoid the biological realities of death
and may even imply that the dead can return.

Despite widespread consensus that parental communi-
cation is an important factor in children’s development of a
mature death concept, few studies to date have directly exam-
ined the links. One exception is Matalon [26], who examined
communication about death in 68 middle- to upper-middle
class parents from New York City with their 6- to 9-year-old
children. Based on the recommendations of death education
specialists, she devised a questionnaire to assess parents’ ten-
dency to engage in ‘effective’ communication about death.
Matalon’s definition of effective communication included: the
‘parents’ willingness, availability and comfort’ when answer-
ing their children’s questions about death and dying, their
‘ability to share the unpleasant feelings’ and uncertainties
about death and their ‘awareness of the need to prepare the
child for the inevitable reality by using opportunities in
nature.’ Matalon [26] found that parents’ self-reported fre-
quency of
this type of communication was significantly
correlated with their children’s sophisticated understanding
of death. The study also revealed a significant negative associ-
ation between parents’ own death anxiety and their tendency
to communicate effectively about death, suggesting that
parents who were more death-anxious were more avoidant
or more likely to resort to euphemisms [26]. It should be
noted, however, that parents’ questionnaire responses about
how they talk to their children about death may not accurately
represent what they say when the topic comes up. Hunter &
Smith [9] found no significant correlation between children’s
death concepts and their parents’ communication about
death, when the latter was assessed by having parents write
direct responses to a 5-year-old actor’s audio-taped questions
about death. This methodological difference could account
for the contrasting findings, or, as the authors acknowledged,
it may be that Hunter & Smith’s [9] null findings could be
attributed to their relatively small sample (N ¼ 37) and
restricted range of scores. Ultimately, the role of parental
input about death should be explored with methodologies
that capture what parents actually say to their children.

Explorations of parents’ communication about death and
dying highlight two factors that influence death concept
development in Western populations. These are: (1) the age
at which children are believed to be capable of understanding
death, and therefore should be taught, and (2) the type of
information parents provide their children. Given that what
parents discuss with their children is influenced by the age
of the child, this factor will be discussed first.

Early researchers examining the development of death con-
cepts argued that children were incapable of understanding or
even thinking about death before the age of 7, and that a
mature death concept was not fully developed until 10 years
of age [25,40]. These estimates were informed by Piagetian

cognitive developmental theory, which assumed that children
could not think about abstract concepts until middle childhood.
As noted above, the modern approach assesses children’s
understanding of death as a biological, as opposed to abstract,
concept. This shift has significantly revised the developmental
timeline, with modern research indicating that most children
acquire a complete death concept between 5 and 7 years of
age, and many are capable of understanding some sub-concepts
of death as young as age 3 [10–12,35]. Despite this updated
approach and research findings, much of the popular press, as
well as some researchers, continue to cite outdated research
and adhere to Piaget’s initial developmental ages. This may
account for the variation in parents’ observed beliefs about
their children’s capacity to understand death.

Research with Western educated parents indicates that the
majority tend to fall into two groups with respect to their
beliefs about children’s ability and readiness to learn about
and understand death. One group of parents aligns with
recent research, citing ages of around 5 and 6 years and
younger [7,20,25,41,42]. Others report that children are not cog-
nitively or developmentally capable of thinking about death
before 7 years of age, and do not fully comprehend before 10
years of age at least [41–43]. For example, Hendricks et al.
[42] explored how American parents discussed sensitive
topics with their children, and when they believed children
were able to understand such topics. They found that, of a
sample of 39 parents recruited online, 43% believed children
were unable to understand death prior to 7 years of age, and
10% of those reported that a complete understanding of
death was acquired after age 12. In the only study of its kind
to date, Gaab et al. [44] compared New Zealander parents’ per-
ceptions of their children’s understanding of death to the
children’s actual comprehension levels. After assessing the
death concepts of 141 5- to 7-year-old children and surveying
their parents, Gaab et al. [44] found that parents underesti-
mated their children’s understanding of all the sub-concepts
of death to some degree, with parents’ estimations of their chil-
dren’s understanding of death causality being the most
conservative. Together, these studies suggest that parents
may be unaware of the extent of their children’s understanding
of death. Beliefs about their children’s conceptual underdev-
elopment, combined with hesitancy about the emotional
implications of talking about death, may explain why many
parents avoid the topic until circumstances demand it [10,24].
The content of parents’ explanations is also revealing. These
can be broadly divided into two categories: scientific facts and
explanations, and religious, spiritual or emotional reassurance
and comfort. Reassurance responses are explanations aimed at
providing solace to the child, and can include religious,
emotional, biological or spiritual information (e.g. continued
existence after life, I won’t die until I’m much older, or it’s
alright to feel sad [24,45]). Facts and explanations generally
relate to the biological processes involved in death, although
they can also relate to rites and rituals following death [24,45].
Providing children with the biological facts is obviously
important
for children’s developing concepts of death.
Gutie´rrez et al. [45] explored the content of 60 American
parents’ self-reported conversations with their 3- to 6-year-
old children as part of a wider study. In response to their
children’s questions about death, the majority of parents
(79.2%) reported that they had incorporated facts and expla-
nations relating to the biological nature of death. However,
other survey studies suggest that not all parents provide

these sorts of explanations. For example, Renaud et al. [27]
surveyed Canadian parents of 2- to 5-year-old children about
their conversations about death and what these conversations
included. Seventy-five percent of parents reported that they
had spoken at least once to their child about death. Of these,
36% reported that they had provided their child with a
‘known’ cause of death, and fewer than 20% reported that
they explained the irreversibility of death. While many parents
claim that their explanations include causes of death (when
known) [24,45], this is the one piece of information children
are most likely to ask about, or wish they were provided
with in retrospect [46,47]. Coincidentally, causality of death
is also the sub-concept that is mastered latest in development.
This may mean that parents’ causal explanations are not
sufficiently informative, or may be pitched at the wrong
level for children to absorb, or may be confused by parents’
emotional reassurances.

It should be recognized that the true proportion of parents
who do talk to their children about death may be overestimated
in the research literature. It seems likely that parents who are
more open to the idea of speaking about death with their chil-
dren are also more likely to agree to participate in studies.
When interviewing high school students, Stillion and Wass
(1982, described in [47, p. 67]) found that 40% of American
teenagers reported that death was never or rarely discussed
at home when they were younger, while a further 26% reported
that it had only been discussed when ‘absolutely necessary’.

How parents communicate with their children about
death and dying not only influences their children’s under-
standing of death, but also how they in turn communicate
about it throughout their lifetime. There is increasing evidence
that how a parent communicates about death and dying
with their child, particularly when addressing a personal
experience, influences how death is subsequently discussed or
approached by the child [46,47] and this influence extends
into adulthood [4,7]. For example, Irizarry [46] found that
Australian 8- to 12-year olds explained their grandparents’
deaths using the explanations provided to them by their
parents, even when they reported that they did not agree
with, or understand, them. McGovern & Barry [4] found that
Irish parents and teachers reported that their personal experi-
ence of death and bereavement was the most salient influence
on their communications with children about death and
dying. These findings suggest a perpetual transmission cycle
of attitudes and conversations about death across generations.
The literature has identified several ways in which children
construct an understanding of death in the absence of direct
teaching from parents and other carers. One way in which chil-
dren learn about death is by listening in on adults’
conversations [28]. As Kurowska-Susdorf [48, p. 141] puts it,
‘by overhearing adult conversations, [children] construct their
own internal understanding using snippets of information’. A
second way in which children formulate an understanding, par-
is by
ticularly when insufficient information is provided,
drawing on their own existing understanding of the world, or
their imagination, to ‘fill in the gaps,’ or simply by making up
their own stories to explain what happens (47, 5). For example,
Irizarry [46, p. 46] observed a 10-year-old girl who pieced
together overheard snippets and concluded that:

‘The sleeping pills she [Grandma] had been given may not have
been the correct ones because normal ones don’t make someone
die. My gran was talking about it. My grandma had a cold and
had gone to the hospital. She didn’t want to go to sleep and

was given sleeping pills and then she died. My father said it
was ‘old age’.’

Similarly, Miller et al. [7] report instances of children integrat-
ing what they know about religion or biology to make sense
of death. One example was a child who:

‘asked her therapist if she thought her deceased mother would
‘grow back when it gets back to summer time? . . . she might come
back as a flower’. This child had witnessed her mother’s coffin
being lowered into the ground. Using her knowledge that seeds
that are planted in the ground emerge as plants, she reasoned ana-
logically that her mother would grow back. . . .This child seemed to
draw on her existing understanding of biology to create a unique
and comforting idea about her dead mother.’ [7, p. 27].

Finally, children may assimilate information about death and
dying from broader contexts,
for example, by learning
that important historical figures are dead. The following
section considers one specific context, namely, the portrayal
of death in the media.

5. Media portrayals of death and dying
In times past, one function of literature, particularly fairy tales
and oral stories, was to help children to understand and
develop a sense of meaning about the world they lived in
[49]. While this role continues today, researchers acknowledge
that for modern children, conveyors of these messages are
more likely to be movies and television shows [6]. It is esti-
mated that children under 8 years of age spend an average of
3 h per day consuming media, with the majority of that time
dedicated to film and television [50,51]. Given its prevalence
in children’s lives, media is now recognized as a legitimate cul-
tural purveyor of specific roles, values and ideals, equivalent in
influence to traditional sources of learning such as schools and
the family environment [52,53].

Sedney [6, p. 316] suggests that the media is an ‘indirect
[form of] death education’ which can be just as powerful as
directed forms of learning. There is evidence that exposure to
media portrayals of real-life traumas (such as terrorist attacks)
can produce symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in
children [54,55]. However, as yet there is surprisingly little
research addressing how exposure to death in the media relates
to children’s death concepts.

Among adults, media portrayals of death have been found
to influence attitudes towards, and concepts about, death (e.g.
[56,57]). In one of the few research studies to address the role of
media exposure in children’s learning about death, Gutie´rrez
et al. [45] asked American parents of 3- to 6-year olds about
what prompted their children’s questions about death and
dying. Sixty-seven per cent of the parents reported that their
children had asked questions about a death portrayed in the
media, most commonly in books and films. Similarly, Renauld
et al. [27] found that a majority of parents they surveyed
reported that their children were first exposed to death in
the media. These parents also reported that their earliest con-
versations with children about death were most commonly
about a media portrayal, followed by death of a pet and
death of grandparents [27]. These findings suggest
that
media portrayals of death may be as important as direct experi-
ence in exposing children to death and dying, and stimulating
parental communication on the topic.

Although not characteristic of all mainstream media
representations of death, many films and books for children
contain confusing, unrealistic and potentially harmful

information about death and bereavement [6,49,52,58]. Sedney
[6] argues that children may internalize the unrealistic messages
about death being provided by popular media, and these inac-
curate ideas may impact on their developing understanding of
death and their attitudes towards it. Distorted portrayals of the
permanence of death and protagonists’ grief responses follow-
ing a death are most common. For example, Tenzek & Nickels
[52] examined the prevalence and characteristics of death
portrayals in 57 Disney and Pixar films. They found that at
least one death occurred in 84.2% of the movies. Of those
deaths, 31.6% were portrayed as reversible (either physically
or by characters returning as spirits). They also observed that,
when characters reacted to these deaths, 63.2% of those reac-
tions were portrayed as either positive or lacking in emotion.
Tenzek & Nickels [52] point out that these unrealistic portrayals
can be confusing to young children, but propose that parents
and educators may use them to frame conversations with
children about the realities of death.

Alongside concerns about unrealistic and inaccurate depic-
tions of death and grief in the mainstream media, there is also
recognition that carefully crafted media portrayals can have a
positive influence on children’s understanding of death
[6,52,58,59]. For example, there is a small children’s literature
on death education, aimed at providing facts about death
and suggesting ways to cope and normalize grief [59]. Clini-
cians and educators recognize the value of these books both
in promoting children’s understanding of the realities of
death and in stimulating communication between children
and their parents [59]. In the USA, a now-famous episode of
the children’s television show Mister Rogers’ neighbourhood
focused on the death of a goldfish [60,61]. This episode ‘dealt
with death in a low-anxiety situation’ [60, p. 183] and was
information about the death
explicit in providing factual
sub-concepts of irreversibility, universality and cessation. The
producers received numerous letters from parents and children
expressing thanks for the programme and providing examples
of how the programme helped them deal with the realities of
death [60]. The programme was repeated several times over
the next few years. More recently, an episode of the Sesame
Street television show, entitled ‘Farewell Mr Hooper’ centred
around the death of a popular (human) character in the show
[62]. The episode portrays frank and factual discussions
about death and grief. Shortly after the 2012 Sandy Hook mas-
sacre in the USA, the episode went viral as parents sought a
way to help explain death and dying to their children [63].
Despite being released decades ago, the episodes of Mr.
Rogers and Sesame Street are still accessed today, and demon-
strate that media can provide a positive resource for
children’s developing death concepts.

However, it must be acknowledged that what topics are
addressed, and how they are portrayed in the media, are gov-
erned by social norms and beliefs about what society deems
‘appropriate’ for children. This has been evident in public reac-
tions to two noteworthy portrayals of death in media for
children. The first is E. B. White’s classic storybook Charlotte’s
web [64], which was criticized for its ending in which the
main character dies [59]. White’s publisher initially told
White to modify the ending so that Charlotte survived, but
White refused [59]. After its release, the book was controversial
with reviewers claiming that the death was ‘not an appropriate
subject for children’. Despite this, Charlotte’s web remains a best-
seller for young children [7] and has since been remade for film.
More recently, Disney was criticized for The lion king movie’s

depiction of lead character Mufasa’s death. Critics argued
that the film was too violent and scary for young children,
with the death deemed to be inappropriate [65]. Again despite
the protestations, The lion king remains one of the highest gross-
ing and popular Disney films of all time. It should be noted that
the initial critical reviews of The lion king eventually gave way
to praise for its realistic and honest depiction of grief and for its
portrayal of death as part of the ‘cycle of life’ [6,66].

These examples suggest that there is an appetite in society
for realistic media portrayals of death and dying, and
highlight the potential for media to play an important role
in children’s developing concepts of death. This is a ripe
area for further research. For instance, there is as yet no
research examining how death portrayals in video games
relate to children’s developing death concepts, which is sur-
prising given the widespread recognition that many video
games portray death as impermanent.

6. Conclusion and recommendations
Modern children have limited access to realistic information
about death and dying. Alongside socio-cultural trends that
have removed death from everyday life, many adults endorse
attitudes of shielding children from the reality of death. Further-
more, it appears that parents tend to underestimate what their
children know about death, and often discuss the topic using
euphemisms that actually contradict
facts.
While media exposure is an increasing influence on children’s
learning, there is no research to date investigating how media
portrayals influence children’s developing death concepts.

the biological

Drawing together the limited evidence reviewed above,
and the advice of bereavement experts and clinicians, the fol-
lowing tentative recommendations about how to teach
modern children about death and dying can be made:

Parents, educators and other influential adults should
ensure that young children have exposure to nature and ani-
mals, as these sorts of experiences promote children’s
understanding of biological concepts [30].

Death education should be frank and honest, but it does
not have to be head-on. Research shows that understanding life
and understanding death are intertwined; so providing chil-
dren with biological
information about the life cycle and
how the body works may have a positive influence on their
understanding of death [12,38].

the potential

Adults should be aware of

to confuse
children when their communication contains a mix of factual
information and euphemisms. Furthermore, parents should
bear in mind that their communications about death affect
both their children’s emerging understanding and how
their children will approach the topic in their turn.

Media portrayals that address death frankly (e.g. Mister
Rogers, Lion king) may be valuable resources for teaching
children the realities of death. At the same time, parents
should be on the lookout to counteract beliefs and attitudes
that might arise from children’s exposure to inaccurate
media portrayals of death.
