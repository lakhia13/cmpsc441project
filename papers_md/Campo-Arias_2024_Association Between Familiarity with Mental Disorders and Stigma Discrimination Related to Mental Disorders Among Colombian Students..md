ABSTRACT

Children  and  adolescents  with  mental  disorders  are  often  discriminated  against  by  their  peers  in 
the  school  context.  However,  knowing  the  variables  associated  with  stigma  discrimination  related 
to  mental  disorders  (SDRMD)  in  each  school  community  is  crucial.  The  study  aimed  to  estimate 
the  relationship  of  familiarity  with  mental  disorders  with  SDRMD  among  students  in  Santa  Marta, 
Colombia. A cross-sectional study was conducted. Familiarity with mental disorders and SDRMD were 
measured with the Reported and Intended Behavior Scale. Three hundred fifty students were aged 
between 10 and 17 years (13.34 ± 1.78), and 188 (53.71%) were girls. Having a close friend with a 
mental  health  problem  (odds  ratio = 0.17,  95%  CI,  0.06-0.48)  was  a  protective  factor  for  SDRMD. 
Having a close friend with a mental health problem is protective against SDRMD among Colombian 
school students.

INTRODUCTION

Stigma discrimination related to mental disorders (SDRMD) 
is  widely  distributed  in  the  population,  regardless  of  age, 
schooling  level,  and  income.1-7  The  SDRMD  is  based  on 
distorted concepts about people who meet the criteria for 
a  mental  disorder.8,9  People  living  with  a  mental  disorder 
are  often  described  as  aggressive,  dangerous,  dependent, 
handicapped, irrational, or uncontrollable, 8,10,11 Children and 
adolescents with mental disorders are often discriminated 
against by their peers in the school context.12

Around the world, several programs have been implemented 
to reduce SDRMD in adolescents.13,14 However, few studies 
have  focused  on  specifying  the  variables  associated  with 
SDRMD among children and adolescents.1,2

Familiarity  with  mental  disorders  (FMD)  can  usually 
be  defined  as  presenting  a  mental  condition  or  having 
relatively close exposure or social or interpersonal contact 
with  mental  disorders  because  a  family  member,  friend, 
or  neighbor  meets  the  criteria  for  a  mental  illness.15,16 
Familiarity with mental disorders has been linked to lower 
SDRDM.15-17 General familiarity frequently reduces people’s 
fear, discomfort, and mistrust.18

On  the  other  hand,  the  scarce  findings  regarding  FMD 
and  SDRMD  among  adolescents  are  less  consistent. 

García-Soriano  and  Roncero,19  using  a  vignette-based 
questionnaire, found higher levels of stigma discrimination 
toward people described as having an obsessive-compulsive 
disorder,  especially  in  male  adolescents  with  no  previous 
experience  with  mental  health  services  or  providers. 
Moreover, Trompeter et al20 asked a group of adolescents 
3  questions  to  find  out  if  they,  a  family  member,  or  a 
friend  had  experienced  problems  similar  to  characters 
with  mental  problems  in  some  vignettes.  The  authors 
found that adolescents exposed to mental health problems 
showed less SDRMD than those who denied this experience, 
especially  among  girls  and  the  youngest  adolescents. 
Nevertheless,  Corrigan  et  al,21  with  a  vignette  depicting 
a person diagnosed with schizophrenia, documented that 
familiarity  with  mental  disorders  increased  the  odds  of 
SDRMD. Al Omari et al,22 applying an attitude questionnaire, 
reported  that  “having  a  family  member  with  a  mental 
illness”  was  related  to  less  SDRMD  and  “having  a  friend 
with a mental illness” was not.

Among adolescents, high SDRMD is a barrier to access and 
may explain a few mental health help-seeking behaviors.9,23 
It is crucial to know the variables associated with SDRMD to 
design appropriate and effective actions to reduce stigma

The  study  aimed  to  determine  the  association  between 
FMD and SDRMD among Colombian school-going students.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Design and Ethical Issues

The  authors  designed  a  cross-sectional  study.  The 
Institutional Ethical Board of the University of Magdalena, 
Santa Marta, Colombia (Approval No: N/A, Date: July 18, 
2017).  revised  and  approved  the  research  in  an  ordinary 
session  on  July  18,  2017.  Parents  signed  the  informed 
consent, and students agreed to participate. The Reported 
and  Intended  Behavior  Scale  (RIBS)  is  a  free  tool,  and  it 
was used with the authors’ permission.

Sample

The  participants  were  selected  by  convenience;  that  is, 
it  was  a  non-random  sampling,  from  2  middle-income 
schools in Santa Marta, Colombia. This pair of schools was 
chosen  because  they  were  part  of  a  university’s  health 
education  extension  program  in  secondary  institutions 
where 2 authors work. A sample of at least 272 students 
was  expected.  This  sample  size  was  adequate  for  an 
expected  prevalence  of  23%  (±5)  for  high  SDRMD  and  a 
confidence level of 95%;26 this frequency was observed in 
a similar study in Colombian medical students.3 Similarly, 
this  sample  size  allowed  block  adjusting  for  up  to  6 
variables at a rate of one variable for every 10 cases of 
high SDRMD.27

The selection criteria were age between 10 and 17 years, 
adequate literacy, and studying between sixth and eleventh 
grades. In Colombia, primary education only has 5 grades; 
completing  primary  and  secondary  takes  11  years. There 
were no exclusion criteria.

Reported and Intended Behavior Scale

The RIBS has 2 components. The first part consists of 4 yes 
or no questions about having a family member, neighbor, 
partner,  or  friend  who  meets  the  criteria  for  a  mental 
disorder.28  These  experiences  or  contacts  were  taken 
as FMD.29

The second component of the RIBS is a Likert-type response 
pattern scale that addresses the future attitude toward a 
person  who  meets  the  criteria  for  a  mental  disorder  at 
home, in the neighborhood, at school, or in continuing a 
friendship. The scores ranged from strongly agree (score 1) 
to strongly disagree (score 5), with a total score between 
4 and 20. The RIBS internal consistency in that study was 
high, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.85.28 Scores equal to or 
greater than 13 were categorized as high SDRMD.

with  the  Shapiro–Francia  test  in  the  Stata  Statistical 
Software release 14.30 Moreover, the age was also divided 
into 10 and 13, and 16 or 17, and Cronbach’s alpha was 
computed to corroborate the internal consistency of the 
RIBS.  The  bivariate  analysis  included  establishing  the 
association of FMD with SDRMD using the odds ratio (OR), 
with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The 95% CI with 
significant  value  always  presents  P  <  .05.  Finally,  OR 
was  adjusted  for  variables  with  a  significant  association 
or  probability  value  of  less  than  20%.31 Adjustment  was 
performed  using  binary  logistic  regression.  Hosmer–
Lemeshow chi-squared was applied to verify the model’s 
goodness  of  fit.32  Analyses  were  carried  out  using 
Statistical Package for Social Sciences Statistics software 
for  Windows,  version  23.0  (IBM  SPSS  Corp.; Armonk,  NY, 
USA).33

Measurement

RESULTS

Students  completed  a  questionnaire  in  the  classroom 
after  a  short  and  straightforward  explanation  of  how  to 
complete  the  questionnaire.  This  questionnaire  included 
demography information (age, gender, and grade) and the 
RIBS.28

MAIN POINTS

• 

• 

Stigma/discrimination  related  to  mental  disorders  is 
common among adolescent students.
Familiarity  with  mental  disorders  can  reduce  discomfort 
when interacting with people who meet the criteria for a 
mental disorder.

•  Having  a  close  friend  with  a  mental  disorder  is  the  most 
important  protective  factor  against  stigma/discrimination 
among Colombian adolescent students.

Three  hundred  fifty  students  participated  in  the  study, 
aged  between  10  and  17  years  (13.34  ±  1.78),  and 
236 (67.43%) took middle-school grades and 114 (32.57%) 
high-school  grades.  More  information  is  presented  in 
Table 1.

Stigma  discrimination  related  to  mental  disorder  scores 
were between 4 and 20 (10.79 ± 3.99), with a high stigma 
discrimination score of 99 (28.29%). The RIBS in the current 
analysis presented a high internal consistency (Cronbach’s 
alpha of 0.88). The percent of affirmative responses in the 
first part of the RIBS are in Table 2.

The SDRMD was significantly correlated with having a close 
friend with a mental health problem and knowing a neighbor 
with a mental health problem. Age and gender presented a

probability of less than 20% and were considered to adjust 
the association of FMD with SDRMD.

Finally,  after  adjusting,  only  “having  a  close  friend  with 
a  mental  health  problem”  kept  a  statistically  significant 
association. All Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-squared tests were 
acceptable,  that  is,  with  P-values  greater  than  .05.34  In 
summary,  “having  a  close  friend  with  a  mental  health 
problem”  was  configured  as  a  protective  factor  against 
SDRMD;  it  was  associated  with  a  more  positive  attitude 
towards  mental  disorders.  However,  “live  with  someone 
who has a mental health problem,” “study with someone 
who has a mental health problem,” and “know a neighbor 
who  has  a  mental  health  problem”  were  independent  of 
SDRMD. See crude and adjusted OR in Table 3.

DISCUSSION

The present study shows that Colombian school-going pre-
adolescents  and  adolescents  with  a  close  friend  with  a 
mental  health  problem  are  6  times  less  likely  to  report 
SDRMD.

The  most  striking  aspect  of  the  current  study  was  that 
only having a close friend with a mental health problem 
was associated with a lower probability of SDRMD. Other 
studies have documented similar findings. García-Soriano 
and  Roncero19  and  Trompeter  et  al20  reported  that  some 
FMD  is  related  to  less  SDRMD.  However,  Corrigan  et  al21 
observed that FMD could increase SDRMD. The relationship 
between FMD and SDRMD could be more complex because 
Al  Omari  et  al22  documented  a  differential  situation: 
“having  a  family  member  with  a  mental  illness”  can 
reduce SDRMD and “having a friend with a mental illness” 
can increase it.

Theoretically,  close  FMD  reduces  SDRMD  because  the 
deep interaction and knowledge of people with a mental 
disorder  can  decrease  prejudice  and  stereotypes  about 
mental health problems.15,18,29 However, some data suggest 
that this association can be modulated by other variables 
such  as  age,  gender,  and  income.  Generally,  people  with 
more years of age, female gender, and higher income show 
a  more  favorable  attitude  towards  people  with  mental 
disorders.19,20,35,36 It is necessary to consider especially low- 
and middle-income countries, such as Colombia, because 
poverty  and  inequity  are  a  syndemic  favoring  SDRMD. 
In  these  countries,  there  is  a  high  frequency  of  people 
with  little  formal  education,  people  with  mental  health 
illiteracy, and people living with mental disorders without 
access  to  health  services,  to  the  point  that  low-  and 
middle-income  countries  account  for  80%  of  the  mental 
health disease burden worldwide.37,38

The  SDRMD  is  a  potent  stressor  among  school-going 
children  and  adolescents  who  meet  the  criteria  for  a 
mental disorder.12 Stigma discrimination related to mental 
disorders reduces the possibility of service use when mental 
health symptoms or problems occur and is needed for an 
evaluation  by  health  professionals.9,23  All  professionals 
working in psychiatry play a crucial role in reducing SDRMD; 
they can implement actions in different contexts and levels 
to  increase  knowledge  and  social  contact  with  people 
living  with  mental  disorders  and  reduce  the  cognitive, 
affective,  and  behavioral  aspects related  to SDRMD.13,14,39 
Yuksel et al40 observed that medical students significantly 
reduced scores on dangerousness, a major mental health 
stigma, of people living with mental disorders after visiting 
a community mental health center.

Study’s Strengths and Limitations

This study has the great strength of measuring four forms 
of FMD and SDRMD with a valid and reliable instrument.28 
Nevertheless,  it  presents  the  limitation  that  it  had  a 
convenience  sample,  and  the  findings  are  limited  to 
these  participants  attending  middle-income  schools; 
consequently, it is impossible to generalize the findings 
to all high school students in the city.26 Future research 
should  have  a  probabilistic  selection  of  adolescent 
students  of  all  socioeconomic  strata  or  incomes.41 
Research  such  as  this  supports  the  need  for  more 
diagnostic  studies  and  actively  implementing  strategies 
to  reduce  SDRMD. These  studies  are  scarce  in  low-  and 
middle-income countries.42

Having  a  close  friend  with  a  mental  health  problem  is 
protective  against  SDRMD  in  some  high  school  students 
of  Santa  Marta,  Colombia.  Further  research  is  needed 
to  determine  the  variables  associated  with  SDRMD  in  a 
representative sample of Colombian high school students.
