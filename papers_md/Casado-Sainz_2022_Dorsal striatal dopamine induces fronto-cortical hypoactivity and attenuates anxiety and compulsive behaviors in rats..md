Dorsal striatal dopamine transmission engages the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, which is implicated in many
neuropsychiatric diseases, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet it is unknown if dorsal striatal dopamine
hyperactivity is the cause or consequence of changes elsewhere in the CSTC circuit. Classical pharmacological and neurotoxic
manipulations of the CSTC and other brain circuits suffer from various drawbacks related to off-target effects and adaptive changes.
Chemogenetics, on the other hand, enables a highly selective targeting of speciﬁc neuronal populations within a given circuit. In
this study, we developed a chemogenetic method for selective activation of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, which
innervates the dorsal striatum in the rat. We used this model to investigate effects of targeted dopamine activation on CSTC circuit
function, especially in fronto-cortical regions. We found that chemogenetic activation of these neurons increased movement (as
expected with increased dopamine release), rearings and time spent in center, while also lower self-grooming. Furthermore, this
activation increased prepulse inhibition of the startle response in females. Remarkably, we observed reduced [18F]FDG metabolism
in the frontal cortex, following dopamine activation in the dorsal striatum, while total glutamate levels- in this region were
increased. This result is in accord with clinical studies of increased [18F]FDG metabolism and lower glutamate levels in similar
regions of the brain of people with OCD. Taken together, the present chemogenetic model adds a mechanistic basis with
behavioral and translational relevance to prior clinical neuroimaging studies showing deﬁcits in fronto-cortical glucose metabolism
across a variety of clinical populations (e.g. addiction, risky decision-making, compulsivity or obesity).

INTRODUCTION
The cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical CSTC circuit relays and shapes
neocortical activity through the striatum, midbrain, and thalamus
back to the cortex. In this circuit, cortical pyramidal neurons project
to the dorsal striatum, where spiny projection neurons (SPN) then
subserve an integration of direct (go) or indirect (no-go) output
pathways that relay signals to the thalamus via the substantia nigra
pars reticulata (SNr). The thalamus then communicates the
processed signal back to the frontal cortex to complete the circuit
[1, 2]. The activity of the CSTC circuit is modulated by nigro-striatal
dopamine projections to the dorsal striatum. Changes in striatal
dopaminergic activity have been linked to perturbations of
cognitive functions in multiple neuropsychiatric or neurodegen-
erative diseases [3] such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
[2] and schizophrenia [4]. While showing distinct phenomenolo-
gies, these conditions have overlapping behavioral phenotypes,
including obsessions, compulsions, and sensory gating deﬁcits,

which are linked to altered dopaminergic transmission within the
striatum [5, 6].

Molecular imaging studies by positron emission tomography
(PET)
in people with OCD have shown changes in striatal
dopamine receptor availability [6], as well as metabolic hyper-
activity especially in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and increased
metabolic connectivity from frontal cortex to the caudate nucleus
[7–10], which is the equivalent of the medial dorsal striatum (mDS)
in rodents [11]. MR spectroscopy studies of such individuals have
shown relatively reduced total glutamate + glutamine (Glx) and
N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in fronto-cortical regions [12–14].
These clinical

neuropsychiatric disease. Furthermore,
it is unclear how dorsal
striatal dopamine dysfunction might contribute to the behavioral
changes reported in a variety of clinical conditions marked by
behavioral disinhibition (e.g., substance addiction, risky decision-
making or gambling, compulsivity or obesity).

Classical neurochemical approaches to modulate activity within
the rodent CSTC circuit include neurochemical lesions [15, 16], and
focal stereotaxic drug injections [17]. These chronic methods
bring, in varying degrees, unintended perturbations or adaptive
changes of the nervous system. Chemogenetics, on the other
hand, enables a highly selective targeting of speciﬁc neuronal
populations within a given circuit.
In this study, we applied a
the mDS
selective retrograde chemogenetic transduction of
dopamine projections arising from the medial substantia nigra
pars compacta (mSNpc). Using this model, we studied the effects
of selective nigro-striatal dopamine activation on behavioral and
whole-brain cerebral metabolic activity in the rodent brain. The
combination of [18F]FDG PET and MR spectroscopy gives valuable
knowledge highly needed in order to interpret clinical neuroima-
ging ﬁndings in psychiatric disorders, such that their combined
use through hybrid PET/MR technology in patients may increase
our understanding of such disorders. We obtained [18F]FDG PET
and MR spectroscopy data in the chemogenetically activated rats,
and tested for changes in behaviors related to CTSC function. As
such, we tested the novel hypothesis that potentiating dopami-
nergic activity speciﬁcally in mDS will perturb metabolism in the
CTSC circuit, while reducing anxiety and compulsion-like beha-
vioral symptoms resembling those present in disorders such
as OCD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Long Evans TH:Cre rats (LE Tg(TH:Cre 3.1)Deis) were purchased from the
Rat Resource and Research Center (RRRC, University of Missouri). This strain
carries a transgene containing a Cre recombinase inserted immediately
before the start codon of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene [18]. Both male
(♂ = ▴) and female (♀ = ▾) animals were used. Additional information on
breeding and ethics is presented in the Supplementary Materials. We
conducted all procedures in accordance with the FELASA guidelines and
with approval from The Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate (license
number: 2016-15-0201-01031). GMO procedures were approved by the
Danish Working Environment Authority (Lab ID 229 806).

Statistics
Results were analyzed in GraphPad using a two-way ANOVA (behavioral
experiments) or mixed effects model (PET and MRS) analysis with repeated
measures–where appropriate–with adjustment for multiple comparisons.
When relevant, we report general effects of sex, treatment or vector
injection with signiﬁcance (P) and degrees of freedom (F), while mixed
effects models are noted with t-value and degrees of freedom (DF).
Individual group differences are noted with respect to signiﬁcance (P).
Standard deviations (SD) are reported throughout the results and ﬁgures.
Signiﬁcance is reported as ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.
Graphpad Prism ﬁles containing all tests, data, and ﬁgures are available

Retrograde chemogenetic transduction of dopaminergic
projections in rats and mice
Adult TH:Cre rats (250 g) were anesthetized with 3% isoﬂurane (vol/vol) in
oxygen and placed into a stereotactic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga,
CA, USA). Anesthesia was maintained with 1.5–2% isoﬂurane; breathing,
pain reﬂex, and body temperature were monitored throughout surgery.
The scalp was shaved and disinfected with successive swabs soaked in
70% iodine, ethanol, and 0.1% lidocaine. An incision was then made down
the midline of the scalp, the skull was exposed, and burr holes were drilled
above the target regions. The DREADD (mDS-DREADD: AAV6-hSyn-DIO-
mCherry-hM3D(Gq)-WPRE) (hM3Dq) and mCherry (mDS-mCherry: AAV6-
hSyn-DIO-mCherry-WPRE) carrying viral vectors (described in detail in the

Supplementary Materials) were injected bilaterally in the mDS at two
locations in each hemisphere (2 μL per location) (AP + 1.1 mm, ML ± 2.5
mm, DV −5 mm and −6 mm, from bregma), via a 10 μl Nanoﬁl syringe and
33GA beveled needle (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) at an
infusion rate of 150 nL/min. After infusion, the needle was left in place for
10 min to allow for diffusion of the virus away from the needle tip before
its slow withdrawal. Following injections, the scalp was sutured, and the
rats were allowed to regain consciousness. Carprofen (5 mg/kg) was
administered subcutaneously as an analgesic before surgery and at 24 and
48 h after surgery. Following surgery, rats were single-housed for 1 week,
and their weight, fur, eyes and overall movement were checked daily for
signs of distress following the scheme of Roughan and Flecknell [19].
Animals were then returned to group housing for 2 weeks prior to further
experiments.

Immunohistochemistry
At the end of the experiments, rats were euthanized with an overdose of
pentobarbital and immediately perfused transcardially with 150–200 ml of
ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) followed by 100–150 ml of
ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were removed and stored in
4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C, rinsed twice with PBS, and then
cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS. Brain sections 40-μm thick obtained on
a microtome were stored in cryoprotectant solution at −20 °C. Free-
ﬂoating sections were immunostained for mCherry (Cat. #632543, TaKaRa
Bio Europe) using the Avidin-Biotin Complex Peroxidase method and for
TH (Cat. #P21962, Invitrogen) using ﬂuorescent antibodies as described in
detail in the Supplementary Material.

Behavioral assesment
First, we assessed the individual acoustic startle responses of the rats as
described in detail in the Supplementary Material. On the experimental
day, locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle
response were recorded from 43 animals in cohort 1 at baseline and again
after clozapine N-oxide (CNO) treatment (14 WT (7M/7F), 15 mDS-DREADD
(8M/7F) and 14 mDS-mCherry rats (7M/7F)), see Supplementary Material
for a description of the experimental setup (Fig. S1). Locomotor activity
was assessed in a custom-made open ﬁeld maze consisting of an 80 × 80
cm arena enclosed by 65 cm opaque walls, with indirect, dim illumination
(~10 Lux). On the test day, rats received an i.p. injection of CNO (0.5 mg/kg
in 5% DMSO/Saline), and 20 min later were placed at the center of the
open ﬁeld and allowed to explore for 40 min. Behavior was recorded with a
Basler ace2 Pro video camera with a 4.5–12.5 mm F1.2 lens positioned
directly above the arena and analyzed using Ethovision software, with
scoring of distance, velocity, center of ﬁeld entries, rearing and grooming.
The arena was cleaned with soap and water and then dried between each
session.
Immediately after the locomotion recordings, the rats were
transferred to the startle chamber for sensorimotor gating assessment,
details of which are described in the Supplementary Material.

[18F]FDG PET scanning
The rats (n = 14, (7 mDS-DREADD, 4F/3M), (7 mDS-mCherry, 4F/3M))
the
were fasted overnight before the PET scan. On the day of
experiment, they received an s.c. injection of 0.5 mg/kg CNO (0.5 mg/
kg in 5% DSMO/Saline) or saline followed 20 min later by an i.p. injection
of 14.1 ± 1.6 MBq FDG (from the clinical in-house production). The rats
remained in their home cage for 45 min following the [18F]FDG injection.
Following this uptake period, the rats were sedated with isoﬂurane
(2–2.5% in oxygen) and placed in a homemade four-rat insert in a
Siemens HRRT (High Resolution Research Tomograph) scanner [20] for a
45-min list-mode emission scan. The rats were kept warm using an
infrared lamp and monitored for respiration throughout the scan. PET
images were cropped to brain-only images for each rat and manually co-
registration to an FDG-speciﬁc rat brain template. Individual scans were
converted to SUV units and normalized to whole-brain uptake as
described in detail
in the Supplementary Material. The images were
averaged per group/condition and maps of the voxel-wise difference
were calculated between conditions. We undertook a regional analysis
for each animal in nucleus accumbens (NAc), mDS, lateral dorsal striatum
(lDS), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), mPFC, OFC, thalamus (Thal), the
midbrain including ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra (MB),
hypothalamus (Hyp) and cerebellum (Cer), as described in detail in the
Supplementary Material.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy
All MR scans were performed on a Bruker BioSpec 94/30 USR MRI system
(9.4 T, 30 cm bore, Bruker, Germany) as previously described [21]. In short,
rats were anaesthetized with 2% (vol/vol) isoﬂurane in oxygen, MRS was
done sequentially in a 3 × 3 × 3 mm region in the right hemispheric mDS
and then in a 3 × 2 × 3 mm region in mPFC. The spectra were acquired
using a STEAM sequence with TE = 4 ms, TR = 4000 ms, 400 averages,
eight dummy scans and 4096 points. VAPOR was used for water
suppression. Metabolite concentrations were calculated with LCModel
using water unsuppressed signal as an internal reference.

RESULTS
Selective chemogenetic targeting of nigro-striatal
dopaminergic projections
We ﬁrst conﬁrmed the retrograde transduction of nigro-striatal
dopamine neurons.
Injection of Cre-dependent serotype 6 adeno
associated viruses in the mDS of TH:Cre rats led to selective
retrograde expression of the mCherry reporter gene in dopamine
projection neurons arising from the mSNpc (Fig. 1A, B). Immunohis-
identiﬁcation of the mCherry reporter gene showed
tochemical
excellent selectivity towards the target neurons (Fig. 1C). Two different
viral vectors were injected into the mDS, one carrying a Gq-coupled
DREADD together with mCherry and the other only mCherry (Fig. 1D).
Overall, this produced a highly reproducible target transduction in the
mDS (Fig. S2A) with similar distance from the ventricles (Fig. S2B), with
a lower staining intensity (Fig. S2C) (P < 0.0001, n = 86) and spread
from the injection site (Fig. S2D) (P < 0.0001, n = 86) noted for the
hM3Dq-carrying vector. There was no evident transduction of cell
bodies resident in the mDS, nor of non-TH:Cre-positive cells in the
mSNpc (Fig. 1E–J). Notably, the ventral tegmental area was devoid of
mCherry-expressing somata (Fig. 1E, I).

Nigro-striatal dopaminergic stimulation increases exploratory
behaviors and lowers self-grooming
We then tested the efﬁcacy of our transduction by locomotor
activity. There were no effects of sex on either behavior, and as
such the results from each sex are pooled in the graphs displayed
in Fig. 2, where sex is denoted as male (♂ = ▴) and female (♀ = ▾).
Graphs displaying the time spent in behaviors are also shown for
each sex in the Supplementary Material (Fig. S4) for ease of
viewing changes in individual sexes. CNO signiﬁcantly increased
velocity in mDS-DREADD animals (P < 0.0001, F(1,14) = 46.8), with
a maximal 90% increase occurring after 20 min of exploration, as
compared to mDS-mCherry animals, while a small decrease was
noted in wildtype (WT) rats (P = 0.006, F(1,11) = 11.8) (Fig. 2A, B).
The mDS-DREADD rats showed an increase in total distance
traveled (Fig. 2C, D) (P < 0.0001, n = 12) and total time spent (P <
0.0001, n = 12) in locomotion (Fig. 2E). Wildtype (WT) rats had a
14% decrease in locomotion time (P = 0.0008, n = 13) following
CNO treatment, which we attribute to a general habituation to the
open ﬁeld during the second exposure (Fig. 2E). Yet, the number
of movement initiations (frequency) was similar in all groups
(Fig. 2I). There was an increased number of entries (Fig. 2F)
(+125%, P < 0.0001, n = 12) and time spent (Fig. 2J) (+119%, P <
0.0001, n = 12) in the center of the open ﬁeld for mDS-DREADD
rats following CNO treatment. Time spent rearing (Fig. 2G) and
number of rearing events (Fig. 2K) were similarly increased by 66%
(P < 0.001, n = 12) and 99% (P < 0.001, n = 12),
respectively
following CNO treatment in mDS-DREADD rats. Self-grooming
time (Fig. 2H) and bouts (Fig. 2L) were likewise affected, but in the
opposite direction, with signiﬁcant reductions of −59% (P < 0.001,
n = 12) and −38% (P < 0.001, n = 12) respectively, after CNO
treatment. Similarly, for the second batch of animals used for the
imaging experiments,

Nigro-striatal dopaminergic stimulation affects prepulse
inhibition of the acoustic startle response differently in males
and females
PPI of the acoustic startle response is modulated by CSTC circuit
function and impaired in OCD and other neuropsychiatric
disorders [22–24]. To assess PPI, we ﬁrst tested basal acoustic
startle response (SR) to different intensity sound pulses. The SR
was clearly measurable after exceeding 100 dB amplitude and
plateaued at 110 dB both in males and females (Fig. 3A), with a
maximal SR (as measured at 120 dB) of 59.1 ± 8.1% in males (n =
21) and 49.6 ± 9.1% in females (n = 27). We thus chose 110 dB as
the pulse intensity for subsequent testing of PPI. There was a sex
difference in the SR to various volumes of sound pulses (P < 0.001,
F(1,46) = 25.2), but no effect of transductions (Fig. 3B, C).

We then tested SR to a 110 dB sound pulse with or without
different intensity prepulses (all pulses are shown in Fig. S5A, D)
and short-term habituation (STH) (Fig. S5B, E). There was no effect
of transductions or treatment with CNO on the SR (Fig. 3D, E), but
there was an overall effect of sex. SR was greater in males (58.1 ±
3.8%, n = 21) than in females (48.6 ± 4.3%, n = 27) (P < 0.001, F
(1,84) = 30.64), as expected from the initial SR test (Fig. 3A). There
were no differences in mean STH between WT and transduction
groups or between baseline and CNO treatment (Fig. S5B, E).
However, the mean STH was signiﬁcant in all female groups
combined (19.7 ± 6.2%; n = 27) (Fig. S5E) (P = 0.008, F(1,86) = 7.3).
In general, SRs decreased in proportion to the amplitude of the
prepulse, as expected (Fig. S5A, D). There were no general effects
of transduction or CNO treatment on SR in either sex. Yet, a
reduced SR following CNO treatment in mDS-DREADD females
was just shy of statistical signiﬁcance (Ave. Diff. = 3.3 ± 1.5%, P =
0.0501 (F(1,9) = 5.11)) and mDS-DREADD male rats showed a
higher SR following CNO treatment to the 81 dB prepulse alone,
which probably reﬂects increased movement rather than actual SR
(Fig. S5H). We next assessed the latency from startle pulse to
startle onset and maximum peak of startle from the SR data above
(Fig. S5C, F). There were no differences in latency in any condition.
The resulting PPI showed a general 24% increase in mDS-
DREADD female rats for all pre-pulses amplitudes (P = 0.022, F
(1,9) = 7.6) (Fig. 3G), and a 58% increase in female mDS-DREADD
rats at the 69 dB prepulse condition upon CNO treatment (Fig. 3)
(P = 0.018, n = 10). There were no changes in male rats (Fig. 3F, H).
Baseline PPI following the 69 dB prepulse was higher in female
than male rats (Fig. S5G) (P = 0.006, F(1,84) = 7.86). Transduction
did not affect baseline PPI

signiﬁcant differences in the correlations between mDS-DREADD

that the largest changes in correlations we found between the
cortical regions (OFC, ACC, and mPCF) and dorsal striatal regions
(mDS and lDS), as well as intracortical (ACC-OFC) and subcortical
correlations NAc-Thal (Fig. 4F).

transductions in baseline conditions. Contrary to our previous
ﬁndings [21], CNO treatment
in mDS-mCherry animals did
provoke signiﬁcant reductions in glutamate (P = 0.0002, t = 4.69,
DF = 70) and total glutamate + glutamine (P < 0.0001, t = 6.01,

DISCUSSION
We present a novel chemogenetic procedure for selective bilateral
activation of nigro-striatal dopamine projections innervating the
rat mDS, which enabled us to test behavioral and cerebral
metabolic effects of acute dopaminergic modulation of the CSTC
circuit. In this animal model, we tested the speciﬁc hypothesis that

Nigro-striatal dopaminergic stimulation increases exploratory
behaviors and lowers self-grooming
We targeted dorsal striatal dopaminergic innervations by using
TH:Cre rats [18] treated with retrograde neuronal transduction by
the AAV6 serotype, as previously established in rats [26], mice [27],
and non-human primates [28]. We found that CNO increased
locomotor activity in all mDS-DREADD rats. In vivo stimulation of

hM3Dq DREADDs are well known to induce phosphatidylinositol
hydrolysis [25], c-fos activation [29–31], dopamine release [32],
increased dopamine neuron excitability with a burst ﬁring pattern
[30, 31, 33, 34] and ultimately increased locomotion as a
behavioral read-out [30, 35–39], in accord with our ﬁndings. We
also observed an increase in exploratory behaviors, entries into
center ﬁeld, and rearing in all mDS-DREADD rats during
chemogenetic activation. Such exploratory behaviors typically
increase following treatment with anxiolytic drugs [40, 41], and
decrease following stress [41, 42], often in a manner independent
of hyperlocomotion, thus suggesting anxiolytic effects of the
present perturbation of the CSTC circuit.

Self-grooming is an innate rodent behavior characterized by a
sequential pattern of movements [43], which serves as a useful
proxy for compulsive behavior [24, 44, 45]. Grooming time and
frequency are under control by the efferent activity of striatal
SPNs. Whereas activation of D1 receptors on SPNs of the direct
(“go”) pathway increase grooming, activation of D2 receptors on
the indirect (“no-go”) SPNs decrease grooming [43]. Our mDS-

and that it is correlated to D2 receptor activation (which is an

inhibitory receptor
preferential activation of
the indirect pathway in our mDS-
DREADD rats is supported by a recent report that the dopamine
ﬁbers, which was mapped by retrograde tracing, innervating the
mDS predominantly target the “indirect” D2-positive SPNs [47]
(which induces inhibitory action on the indirect pathway).
Furthermore, a study by Ahmari et al, showed that hyperactivation
of the OFC to DS pathway, increased self-grooming in rats, which
support our ﬁndings where lower OFC activity leads to lower self-
grooming [45].

Nigro-striatal dopaminergic stimulation affects prepulse
inhibition of the acoustic startle response differently in males
and females
PPI is an autonomous behavioral response, which is highly modulated
by components of the CSTC circuit, in particular the PFC [48–51],
striatum [52], and the SN [53]. Disruption of normal PPI is evident in
people with OCD [23, 54]. Highly conserved across species, the PPI
response serves as a useful translational construct in brain research.
While some dopamine agonists disrupt PPI when given systemically,
the relative contributions of D1-and D2/3 receptor pathways in this
effect are debated [55–58]. Thus, converging lines of clinical and
preclinical evidence link the CSTC circuit, dopamine, and PPI. The

expression of PPI differs between rodent strains [59, 60] and sex [61–
63]. Indeed, we found that mDS-DREADD female rats had increased
PPI at low prepulse amplitude during chemogenetic activation, but
males showed no such effect. Previous work showed that male rats
with SN lesions [53] as well as male mice with striatal lesions [64]
displayed disruption of PPI, but
there was no corresponding
investigation of female rats in those studies. In another investigation,
deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the NAc disrupted PPI in male WT rats,
whereas the same DBS rescued disrupted PPI in a male rat model of
schizophrenia [50], which implies context-dependence of
the
behavior consequences of stimulated dopamine release.

A limitation to this study lies in our use of CNO to activate
DREADDs. CNO metabolizes in vivo to clozapine, which is
presumably the main agonist on DREADDs [21, 65–67]. While
clozapine is an antagonist at endogenous dopamine D2/3 and
serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, it has selectivity for DREADDs when
administered at the present low dose. Indeed, we did not observe
any behavioral effects of CNO/clozapine in control rats in this
study, nor had we seen any occupancy at D2/3 or 5-HT2A receptors
in an earlier
[21]. Furthermore,
clozapine treatment can restore disrupted PPI [57, 60, 68], but
neither we nor others [66] have measured any intrinsic effects of
CNO on PPI in WT or control animals at the dose used, which also
argues for selective activation of DREADDs.

[50, 51, 69–72]. We found that chemogenetic activation in mDS-
DREADD rats elicited hypometabolism in fronto-cortical areas
(Fig. 4A, B). This conﬁrms the behavioral ﬁndings described above
suggesting that mDS dopamine activation controls fronto-cortical
neuronal activity though the CSTC circuit. Serveas et al. showed
that acute treatment of rats with the dopamine D2/3 receptor
agonist quinpirole provoked a global increase in [18F]FDG whole-
brain uptake, yet a relatively lesser increase in NAc, mDS, and the
fronto-cortical regions, i.e. mPFC, ACC and OFC [72], suggesting a
common mechanism to the present DREADD study. Globally
increased [18F]FDG uptake might mask regional differences in
metabolism, emphasizing the importance of whole-brain normal-
ization between baseline and test conditions [73]. Our use of the
human HRRT PET scanner, which has lesser spatial resolution
(2 mm) compared with contemporary dedicated small animal
scanners (1 mm), limits our ability to detect small focal changes in
metabolism. We accommodate the resolution issue by using
relatively large bilateral VOIs.

Nigro-striatal dopaminergic stimulation increase glutamate
and N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid in medial prefrontal cortex
and glutamate levels in dorsal striatum
Our MR spectroscopy results showed increases in glutamate and
NAAG in the mPFC, and increased glutamate in the mDS during
chemogenetic activation, which may seem at odds with the PET
ﬁnding of lower [18F]FDG uptake in frontal cortex. While the exact
relationship between [18F]FDG uptake and total glutamate levels is
unknown, we suppose that glutamate is stored in the terminals of
glutamatergic afferents in the mPFC, which are presumably
thalamic or cortical inputs through the CSTC circuit, while NAAG
is mainly located in interneurons [74]. Once released into the
synapse, glutamate is taken up by astroglial cells and converted
into glutamine, whereas NAAG is metabolized to NAA and
glutamate [75, 76]. In this scenario, the increased glutamate and
NAAG levels measured by MR spectroscopy during chemogenetic
activation may thus reﬂect elevated vesicular concentrations in
thalamic or cortical afferent terminals, due to indirect inhibition

via mDS dopaminergic activation of the indirect (no-go) pathway.
NAAG signaling is not completely understood, but some evidence
points towards it having an inhibitory effect on GABA release, such
that lower NAAG release might result in net inhibition of cortico-
striatal projections [77]. Such an inhibition could account for the
lower cortical [18F]FDG uptake and consequently lower glutama-
tergic activity in the DS, resulting in increased vesicular glutamate
in DS. Furthermore, we suppose that mDS-DREADD
content
stimulation also stimulates dopamine neurons that co-release
glutamate [78, 79], which in turn might favor the local astroglial
conversion of glutamine to glutamate [75, 76].

As noted above, there is no general model to connect glutamate
levels measured with MRS to [18F]FDG uptake. One study reported no
correlation between these two markers in WT mice, although there
was a clear inverse relationship in mGluR5 KO mice [80]. That ﬁnding
resembles present observations in the mDS-DREADD group, suggest-
ing a similar perturbation of the coupling between glutamate levels
and energy metabolism. We did observe a change in DS glutamate
levels in the mCherry animals, as in our previous study, albeit at
higher doses of CNO [21]. Thus,
it remains possible that CNO
metabolism to clozapine may indeed contribute to the cerebral
metabolic changes reported in this study, albeit in the opposite
direction; our results may therefore underestimate the effect of mDS
dopamine activity on local glutamate levels

Translational relevance
Changes in striatal dopamine and prefrontal cortical glutamate levels
are held to be central etiological factors for neuropsychiatric disorders
that involve the CSTC circuit, such as OCD [13] and Tourette’s
Syndrome [81]. In a recent PET study with DBS of the ventral striatum
in people with treatment-resistant OCD, increased dopamine release
correlated with a decline in OCD related symptoms [82]. Furthermore
Nordstrom et al. found that systemic administration of the D2/3
receptor agonist bromocriptine suppressed “Tics” in a transgenic
mouse model of Tourette’s Syndrome [83], supporting an earlier
clinical report that bromocriptine may be helpful
in some OCD
patients [84]. Our results are a step towards disentangling the
functional and metabolic effects of speciﬁc elements in the CSTC
circuit and support the proposition that mDS might be a relevant DBS
target in neuropsychiatric diseases involving compulsive or impulsive
behaviors.

Conclusion
We found that chemogenetic activation of dopamine neurons
projecting to mDS potentiated rat exploratory behavior,
lowered
self-grooming, and enhanced PPI of the startle response. These
behavioral changes occurred in association with reduced metabolic
activity in the frontal cortex as measured by [18F]FDG PET and
increased glutamate and NAAG levels in the mPFC as measured by
MRS. Our study thus revealed that dopamine signaling in mDS
exerted modulatory control of fronto-cortical metabolic activity and
the orchestration of behavior related to CSTC circuit function. These
results support our hypothesis that dopamine release in the mDS can
be a driver for reduced cortical metabolism in distal parts of the CSTC
circuit and suggest that dopamine activation in the mDS reduce
anxiety and compulsive behaviors.
