## What is borderline personality disorder (BPD)?

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a type of mental health diagnosis. A doctor might diagnose you with BPD if:

- You have difficulties with how you think and feel about yourself and other people

- These difficulties make it hard to cope day to day

Experiences of BPD are different for different people. You may experience emotions that are very intense, overwhelming or changeable. You may also experience difficulties with relationships or your sense of identity.

Our page onexperiences of BPDexplains what it's like living with BPD.

Everything hurts more than it seems to for everyone else. And any 'thick skin' you're supposed to have just isn't there.

You may hear other names for BPD, such as:

- Emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD)

- Emotional intensity disorder (EID)

- Borderline pattern personality disorder (borderline pattern PD)

It's your choice which term, if any, you use. People have very different views on BPD. There areongoing debates about the diagnosis of personality disorders.

Some people find a BPD diagnosis helpful or validating. Some find it unhelpful or stigmatising.

There's no right or wrong way to understand or describe your experiences. The important thing to remember is thatyou deserve support and understanding.

## When is BPD diagnosed?

You might be given a diagnosis of BPD if you experience at least five of the following things. And if they’ve lasted for a long time and have a big impact on different parts of your daily life:

- Feelingvery worried about people abandoning you.And like you'd try very hard to stop that happening.

- Havingintense emotions that last from a few hours to a few daysand canchange quickly.Like from feeling very happy and confident to suddenly feeling low and sad.

- Feelinginsecure about who you are. Your sense of self might change significantly depending on who you're with.

- Finding itreally hard to make and keep stable relationships. Often viewing relationships as completely perfect or completely bad.

- Feelingemptya lot of the time

- Actingimpulsivelyanddoing things that could harm you.Likebinge eating, usingdrugs and alcohol, or driving dangerously.

- Usingself-harmto manage your feeling or

- Feelingsuicidal

- Feeling intenseanger, which can be difficult to control

- Experiencingparanoiaordissociationin moments of extreme stress

The worst part is the insecure relationships. When I'm attached, they're my whole world – it's crippling. I care so deeply about how long they take to reply or their tone. I'm so afraid of losing them.

Watch Lechelle and Debbie talk about having BPD. And how a combination of medication anddialectical behaviour therapy (DBT)has helped them develop skills to manage it.

## Different views on diagnosis

You only need to experience five of these difficulties to be given a diagnosis of BPD. So it can be a very broad diagnosis. It includes lots of different people with very different experiences.

Those of us who've been diagnosed with BPD have different views on whether the label is helpful.

Some of us find it useful to get a diagnosis. For example, because:

- It helps us to understand and explain our difficulties

- It helps us put a name to our experiences and connect with others

- It gives us a sense of relief and validation

- It may be helpful for accessing treatment or support

Even though I haven't been offered much support, just having a diagnosis helps me feel my suffering is validated.

On the other hand, some of us don’t find a BPD diagnosis helpful. For example because:

- We may find it stigmatising

- We feel it suggests that there’s something wrong with who we are

- It can sometimes be a barrier to getting the support we need

Then there are also some of us who disagree entirely with the current system of diagnosing personality disorders.

We might prefer not to describe our experiences as medical problems. We may see them more as a response totrauma, difficult life events or problems in our society.

Our page onwhy personality disorder is a controversial diagnosishas more information.

I don't tell people I have BPD because I don't like labelling myself. I just say I have depression / anxiety. But I know I have BPD. I feel things so intensely sometimes that I lose control of my senses. It's one of the worst feelings, but I've learnt to cope.
