ABSTRACT
Objectives  To examine potential deteriorations in 
mental health and well- being in the first COVID- 19 
pandemic year compared with the previous decade 
focusing on the following vulnerable subgroups in 
Germany: women with minor children in the household, 
those living without a partner, younger and older 
adults, those in a precarious labour market situation, 
immigrants and refugees, and those with pre- existing 
physical or mental health risks.
Design  Analyses of secondary longitudinal survey data 
using cluster- robust pooled ordinary least squares models.
Participants  More than 20 000 individuals (aged 16+ 
years) in Germany.
Primary and secondary outcome measures  Mental 
Component Summary Scale (MCS) of the 12- item Short- 
Form Health Survey measuring mental health- related 
quality of life, single item on life satisfaction (LS).
Results  We find a decline in the average MCS in the 2020 
survey that is not particularly striking in the overall time 
course, still resulting in a mean score below those of all 
preceding waves since 2010. We find no change in LS 
from 2019 to 2020 against the background of a general 
upward trend. Regarding vulnerability factors, only the 
results on age and parenthood are partially in line with our 
expectations. In 2020, LS declined among the youngest 
adults; MCS declined among mothers (and women and 
men without children) but not fathers. Unlike respective 
comparison groups, refugees, those unemployed before 
the pandemic and those with pre- existing mental health 
risks experienced no MCS declines in 2020, whereas 
persons living without a partner, the eldest, and those with 
pre- existing health risks exhibited continued increases in 
LS.
Conclusions  There is no evidence for substantial 
breakdowns in mental health or subjective well- being 
in the first pandemic year in the German population 
or its subgroups, particularly when considering 
developments of the previous decade. Since the majority 
of hypothesised vulnerable groups to pandemic stressors 
showed more stable MCS and LS, our results warrant 
further study.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ The paper uses data from a large- scale longitudinal 
random  sample  of  private  households  in  Germany 
to  uncover  pandemic- related  changes  in  the  long- 
term  trajectories  of  mental  health  and  subjective 
well- being.

 ⇒ We employ analyses for two different indicators: the 
Mental Component Summary Scale capturing men-
tal health- related quality of life as a mental health 
measure and life satisfaction as a measure of sub-
jective well- being.

 ⇒ We  consider  heterogeneous  trajectories  of  mental 
health and well- being by looking at several possible 
vulnerability  factors,  namely  gender  and  children, 
living  arrangements,  age,  precarious  employment, 
migration status and pre- existing physical and men-
tal health risks.

 ⇒ No  data  for  the  succeeding  pandemic  years  after 
2020  are  available  yet,  limiting  our  possibilities  to 
assess  changes  in  mental  health  and  well- being 
trajectories  across  vulnerability  groups  further  into 
the pandemic.

INTRODUCTION
Since 2020 and for over 2 years, the COVID- 19 
pandemic has posed a threat to the physical 
health of populations globally and may have 
had  direct  and  collateral  effects  on  individ-
uals’  mental  health  and  well- being.1  2  In  the 
first year of the pandemic, populations world-
wide were exposed to major new stressors, such 
as  the  fear  of  infection  with  a  poorly  under-
stood virus, severe illness or death, as well as 
the repercussions of measures to control the 
spread  of  the  virus  via  social  contact  restric-
tions, as well as economic consequences.2 3 In 
Germany, the first case was reported at the end 
of  January  2020,  marking  the  start  of  phase 
zero with sporadic cases.4 Soon thereafter, the

first wave of infections from March to May4 prompted a 
lockdown,  including  far- reaching  contact  restrictions  in 
work  and  private  settings,  closures  of  schools,  childcare 
facilities, non- essentials and gastronomy. After a summer 
with  relatively  few  cases,  a  more  severe  second  wave  of 
infections and the beginning of the vaccination campaign 
followed between October 2020 and February 2021,4 with 
a  partial  lockdown  in  fall  2020  and  a  more  far- reaching 
lockdown from December 20205 onwards. Owing to the 
pandemic and containment measures, declines in mental 
health  and  well- being  in  2020  compared  with  previous 
years  were  widely  expected.6  7  The  early  stages  of  the 
pandemic  have  been  examined  extensively  regarding 
potential mental health declines in Germany8 and inter-
nationally.9–12  However,  findings  are  mixed,  and  clear 
conclusions cannot be easily drawn.8 13

Despite the crisis’ global nature, some population groups 
are likely to have been disproportionally affected.14 The 
burden of the pandemic—both from the presence of the 
virus  and  measures  for  infection  mitigation—may  have 
been unequally distributed across different groups in the 
population throughout the pandemic. For instance, older 
individuals and those with pre- existing health conditions face a 
greater risk of falling severely ill with COVID- 19,1 15 which 
likely led to an increased perception of threat and health 
anxiety,  particularly  in  the  first  year  of  the  pandemic, 
before  vaccinations  were  developed.  Parents,5  but  espe-
cially  mothers,16  17  may  have  been  particularly  burdened 
by  new  childcare  demands  during  school  and  childcare 
facility closures. Younger adults experienced social contact 
and  other  restrictions  during  a  transitional  life  stage.18 
Older individuals and those living without a partner18 faced 
increased risks of isolation due to contact restrictions and 
social distancing.1 Individuals in precarious labour market 
situations, such as those unemployed or marginally employed, 
were more likely to endure personal repercussions from 
economic  consequences  of  the  pandemic.19–21  Migrants, 
particularly  refugees  (used  here  to  refer  to  all  persons 
who move to another country for humanitarian reasons, 
independent  of  their  legal  situation),  may  have  faced 
increased risks due to restricted access to quality health-
care,22  poorer  labour  market  attachment23  and  greater 
risks of isolation when social networks in the country of 
residence are less established,24 25 and concerns for family 
and  friends  in  their  country  of  origin.  Those  with  pre- 
existing mental health conditions may be particularly vulner-
able to the potential mental health consequences of these 
various pandemic- related stressors.18

Indeed,  existing  research  provides  some  evidence 
for  associations  between  these  vulnerability  factors  and 
poorer mental health in the first years of the pandemic 
in  Germany  or  elsewhere:  younger  adults,8  26–28  older 
adults,29 parents,27 30 mothers,31 those with lower education 
levels,32  33  lower  household  income33  or  those  receiving 
welfare assistance,34 immigrants and refugees,25 35 36 indi-
viduals  living  alone,37  those  with  pre- existing  mental8  38 
and physical health conditions11 have been found to show 
an  elevated  risk  of  mental  health  deterioration.  Fewer 

2

studies also examined life satisfaction, identifying corre-
sponding declines in the overall German population39 40 
and  particularly  for  mothers.41  Yet,  these  studies  looked 
only at shorter time spans (ie, one time point before the 
pandemic or retrospective measures).

In  light  of  previous  research,  we  identify  three  main 
research gaps. First, we argue that it is crucial to consider 
both measures of mental health and subjective well- being 
as  outcomes  because  the  pandemic  may  have  different 
impacts on the latter, particularly on cognitive evaluative 
measures  such  as  life  satisfaction.  Second,  nationwide 
representative  studies  (exceptions  include  studies  by 
Mauz et al and Sachser et al42 43) and, in particular, longi-
tudinal studies (exceptions include studies by Hettich et 
al, Entringer and Kröger and Peters et al28 44 45) on mental 
health and well- being indicators prepandemic and peri-
pandemic  in  Germany  are  still  rare.  Moreover,  these 
and  other  existing  studies  consider  only  more  recent 
prepandemic timespans or a single baseline period, not 
regarding  longer  prepandemic  trends.  In  other  words, 
previous  studies  have  been  limited  in  their  capacity  to 
distinguish  differences  in  mental  health  and  well- being 
between  observation  periods  before  and  during  the 
pandemic  that  may  be  part  of  longer  ongoing  trends 
or  reflect  a  degree  of  fluctuation  observed  in  previous 
years  from  pandemic- related  changes.  Third,  migrant 
and especially refugee populations as potentially vulner-
able groups have scarcely been addressed in the existing 
literature (exceptions include studies by Goßner et al and 
Entringer et al25 46).

The  present  study  addresses  these  research  gaps  by 
examining the potential impact of the early phases of the 
pandemic on the development of the Mental Component 
Summary Scale (MCS) of the 12- item Short- Form Health 
Survey  (SF- 12),  which  assesses  mental  health- related 
quality of life,47 and life satisfaction, a cognitive compo-
nent  of  subjective  well- being,48  using  nationwide,  repre-
sentative,  longitudinal  data  from  approximately  20 000 
adults in Germany. We explore the heterogeneous impact 
of the pandemic by addressing a whole set of candidate 
vulnerability  factors:  being  female  with  children  under 
the  age  of  16  years  in  the  household,  living  without  a 
partner, being a younger or older adult, migration status, 
various less secure forms of employment and pre- existing 
physical  and  mental  health  risks.  We  hypothesised  that 
these  vulnerability  factors  are  associated  with  declines 
in  MCS  and  life  satisfaction  in  the  first  pandemic  year 
compared  with  the  prepandemic  period.  We  used  data 
from  the  Socio- economic  Panel  (SOEP- Core)  (17 611 
individuals  providing  75 266  person- year  observations), 
IAB- SOEP Migration Sample (2018 individuals providing 
6978  person- year  observations)  and  IAB- BAMF- SOEP 
Survey  of  Refugees  (2391  individuals  providing  6014 
person- year  observations)  (the  number  of  observations 
refers  to  the  analytical  sample  for  the  MCS  and  socio-
demographic  vulnerability  factors),  which  encompass  6 
survey waves for the MCS (between 2010 and 2020) and 
11  survey  waves  for  life  satisfaction  (2010–2020).  The

longitudinal  study  of  private  households,  located  at  the 
German  Institute  for  Economic  Research  (DIW).  The 
IAB- SOEP Migration Sample is conducted jointly by the 
Institute for Employment Research (IAB) and the SOEP. 
The  IAB- BAMF- SOEP  Survey  of  Refugees  is  conducted 
jointly by the IAB, the research data center of the Federal 
German Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) and 
the  SOEP.  To  analyse  the  developments  in  both  indica-
tors, we estimated weighted pooled ordinary least squares 
(OLS) regressions and assessed the pandemic impact by 
using interaction effects between vulnerability factors and 
survey year dummies.

METHODS
Patient or public involvement
Patients  and/or  the  public  were  not  involved  in  the 
design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans 
of this research.

Study design and analytical sample
The data employed in the present study come from the 
German Socio- economic Panel (SOEP, V.37, EU version), 
which  comprises  the  general  SOEP- CORE  population 
survey, 2010–2020,49 and two integrated studies covering 
the recent immigrants in Germany, that is, the IAB- SOEP 
Migration  Sample,  2013–2020,50  and  the  IAB- BAMF- 
SOEP Survey of Refugees 2016–2020.51

The SOEP- CORE is a large- scale longitudinal represen-
tative study of private households in Germany, launched 
in  1984  and  conducted  annually.49  The  target  popula-
tion of the IAB- SOEP Migration Sample was drawn from 
the  register  data  of  the  Federal  Employment  Agency, 
the  so- called  Integrated  Employment  Biographies,  in 
2013.50 The study is representative of immigrants arriving 
in  Germany  since  1995  and  descendants  of  immigrants 
born after 1976.52 53 As part of the SOEP- CORE study, the 
last immigrant refreshment sample before the IAB- SOEP 
Migration Sample dates back to 1995. The survey is based 
on  a  concept  of  households  according  to  which  every 
adult household member is interviewed. The IAB- BAMF- 
SOEP  Sample  of  Refugees  in  Germany  was  launched  in 
2016,  in  the  aftermath  of  the  surge  of  refugee  migra-
tion to Europe in 2015.51 The data were drawn from the 
Central Register of Foreigners54 and are representative of 
refugees who arrived in Germany between January 2013 
and  December  2016  (irrespective  of  their  current  legal 
status). It is based on the same household concept as that 
described  for  IAB- SOEP.  By  using  appropriate  sample 
weights,  SOEP  data  allow  us  to  make  inferences  for  the 
population in Germany.

For  analyses,  we  restricted  the  original  data  to  the 
years 2010–2020 to minimise the lingering effects of the 
financial crisis in 2008/2009, which had a negative public 
health  impact.55  56  Moreover,  we  considered  2010–2020 
observations  of  respondents  who  participated  in  the 
survey year 2020, that is, pandemic survey year, and in at 

Open access

least one prepandemic survey year. Due to specifics of the 
fieldwork, SOEP- CORE interviews were collected between 
10 January 2020 and 8 December 2020, interviews of the 
IAB- SOEP Migration Sample between 4 March 2020 and 
12  August  2020,  while  the  IAB- BAMF- SOEP  Sample  of 
Refugee  interviews  started  on  24  August  2020  and  were 
completed on 15 February 2021. We included data from 
respondents  interviewed  on  31  January  or  later  (exclu-
sion  of  four  respondents),  the  day  after  WHO  declared 
COVID- 19  a  ‘public  health  emergency  of  international 
concern’ and 3 days after the first case in Germany.57

These  data  restrictions  resulted  in  a  sample  of  22 020 
individuals  for  the  analysis  of  mental  health  trajectories 
by sociodemographic vulnerability factors that have been 
interviewed up to 6 times (4.5 on average). While about 
80%  of  interviews  in  our  used  SOEP- CORE  and  IAB- 
SOEP Migration Sample data were conducted by the end 
of  May  2020,  interviews  as  part  of  the  IAB- BAMF- SOEP 
Survey of Refugees only started in August 2020, and 83% 
were  conducted  by  the  end  of  2020.  All  analyses  in  this 
study  are  weighted  with  the  sample  weights  provided 
with the survey data to compensate for distortions caused 
by  over- represented  or  under- represented  groups,  and 
non- response.

Outcome variables
We  consider  mental  health- related  quality  of  life  and  subjec-
tive  well- being  as  dependent  variables.  Our  measure  of 
mental  health- related  quality  of  life  was  the  MCS  from 
the  SF- 12,  which  includes  six  items  capturing  vitality 
(energy  vs  fatigue),  social  functioning,  role  limitations 
due  to  emotional  problems  and  emotional  well- being 
over  the  past  4 weeks  on  a  5- point  scale.47  While  the 
MCS  has  commonly  been  conceived  of  as  assessing  the 
mental  health  component  of  health- related  quality  of 
life,58  59  it  has  also  shown  to  be  suitable  as  a  screening 
instrument for depression and anxiety disorders.60 61 We 
formed composite MCS- 12 scores ranging from 0 to 100 
normalised  to  the  2004  SOEP  wave  for  comparability.62 
Except  the  survey  year  2017,  when  a  new  refreshment 
sample of >2000 refugees was added, MCS was collected 
in  2- year  intervals  from  2010  until  2020,  providing  one 
pandemic- time survey date (between 30 January 2020 and 
15 February 2021).

Our  measure  of  subjective  well- being  is  a  single  item 
on global life satisfaction, a well- established 11- point scale 
ranging  from  0  (completely  dissatisfied  with  life)  to  10 
(completely satisfied with life). Life satisfaction is gener-
ally  conceived  as  the  cognitive  component  of  subjective 
well- being.63  Life  satisfaction  was  collected  annually, 
yielding pandemic- time observations between 30 January 
2020 and 15 February 2021.

Vulnerability factor variables
The vulnerability factors to be examined were measured 
using the following variables: gender and having children 
under  the  age  of  16  years  living  in  the  same  household 
were  grouped  in  a  variable  gender  and  children  with  the 

3

Jaschke P, et al. BMJ Open 2023;13:e071331. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2022-071331Open access 

following categories: (1) men without children (reference 
category),  (2)  men  with  children,  (3)  women  without 
children  and  (4)  women  with  children.  To  measure 
living arrangements, we contrasted living without a partner 
(including single, married or in a registered partnership 
living separately, widowed) with cohabiting with a partner 
(irrespective of marriage).

Age  was  grouped  into  the  following  five  categories: 
(1)  16–25  years  (reference  category),  (2)  26–45  years, 
(3)  46–59  years,  (4)  60–74  years  or  (5)  75+  years.  The 
age  group  of  those  aged  16–25 years  represents  young 
adults  in  education  or  early  career.  The  second  age 
group comprising persons aged between 26 and 45 years 
includes working adults. Those aged between 46 and 59 
years  represent  a  middle  age  group  with  a  potentially 
more established and stable career path. Two last groups 
aged between 60 and 74 years and those aged 75 years and 
above are those most at risk of severe courses of disease 
due to COVID- 19 infection.64 65

The  variable  for  migration  background  is  derived  based 
on  country  of  birth  and  legal  status  at  arrival.  The  vari-
able  includes  the  following  categories:  (1)  native- born 
ethnic majority (reference category), (2) immigrant (no 
refugee), (3) descendant of immigrant (no refugee), (4) 
refugee.

Employment status includes the following categories: (1) 
full- time, part- time employed or other (training/appren-
ticeship,  sheltered  workshop)  (reference),  (2)  margin-
ally  employed  (which  is  characterised  by  low  absolute 
remuneration—for  example,  with  a  maximum  of  €450 
in  2019  as  defined  by  law—and  short  working  hours), 
(3) self- employed, (4) unemployed (not working but job- 
seeking)  and  (5)  inactive  (retired  or  those  not  working 
but not job seeking).

An indicator for pre- existing (ie, prepandemic) mental 
health  risks  was  coded  to  one  for  those  who  reported 
having received a diagnosis of depression or burnout at 
some point in their lives, and zero otherwise. An indicator 
for pre- existing physical health risks was coded to one for 
those who reported having been diagnosed with asthma, 
cardiopathy, cancer, stroke or hypertension at some point 
in their lives, and zero otherwise. Pre- existing conditions 
were coded such that they were carried forward from the 
first report and no conditions were carried backward.

To  ensure  the  correct  order  of  changes  in  time,  we 
lagged  the  vulnerability  factor  values  for  employment 
status and health status from the last prepandemic survey 
wave  to  prevent  reverse  causality  issues.  We  included 
corresponding dummy variables indicating missing infor-
mation  to  capture  item  non- response  in  vulnerability 
factor variables.

Control variables
We  account  for  potential  confounders  that  may  vary  by 
vulnerability  factors  and  simultaneously  shape  mental 
health- related quality of life and life satisfaction. Specifi-
cally, we control for the highest educational degree aggregated 

4

into: (1) lower secondary education (reference category), 
(2)  secondary  or  short- cycle  non- tertiary  education,  (3) 
bachelor’s degree or equivalent and (4) master’s degree 
or doctorate. We further control for square metres of living 
space per person (linear and squared) to account for the 
household’s availability of private space per person. Addi-
tionally,  we  control  for  district  type  in  which  the  respon-
dent resides categorised into (1) independent large city 
(reference category), (2) urban district, (3) rural district 
with  some  density  and  (4)  sparsely  populated  rural 
district.66 We control for the average unemployment rate in 
the local labour market region in the interview month to 
account  for  the  local  economic  situation.  Since  Germa-
ny’s  counties  and  independent  cities  are  connected  by 
commuter  linkages  so  that  local  labour  markets  extend 
beyond the boundaries of 401 administrative districts, we 
use  the  141  functional  local  labour  markets  defined  by 
Kosfeld and Werner.67 To control for temporal trends, we 
include  survey  year  fixed  effects  and  the  calendar  month 
of  the  interview.  Note  that  in  the  analyses  on  life  satisfac-
tion, we include yearly dummies from 2010 (reference) to 
2020. Since the MCS was surveyed in 2- year intervals, we 
consider 2- year dummies. Online supplemental appendix 
tables  A1–A3  show  descriptive  statistics  for  the  vulnera-
bility factors and control variables.

Statistical analyses
All analyses were conducted in Stata V.17.0. Our analyses 
of the different vulnerability factors were in two parts: we 
separated  analyses  pertaining  to  structural  factors  and 
those pertaining to pre- existing health conditions. In the 
analyses pertaining to structural vulnerability factors, we 
applied pooled OLS models (with SEs clustered at person- 
level)  regressing  MCS  score  and  life  satisfaction  on  the 
vulnerability  factor  variables,  one  interaction  term  per 
model of each vulnerability factor variable by the survey 
year variable and control variables. Correspondingly, we 
calculated one model per vulnerability factor variable for 
each outcome variable to include only a single interaction 
term per model.

We  analysed  pre- existing  health  risks  as  vulnerability 
factors separately from the other factors because of their 
uniquely  close  relationship  with  the  outcome  variables. 
Another  reason  is  reduced  sample  size,  as  information 
on pre- existing health risks is unavailable for most refu-
gees.  These  pooled  OLS  models  predicting  MCS  or  life 
satisfaction  included  dummies  for  physical  or  mental 
health risks, one interaction term per model of physical 
or mental health risks by the survey year variable as well as 
all remaining structural vulnerability factors and further 
controls.

We calculated predictive margins for the outcome vari-
ables  for  each  vulnerability  factor  subgroup  from  the 
regression results. Specifically, we estimated the following 
regressions  separately  for  each  of  the  five  vulnerability 
factor groups V

with the vulnerability factor v.

RESULTS
Development of MCS and life satisfaction in the German 
population
We begin by examining the overall development of the MCS 
and life satisfaction in the German population in the recent 
decade. As shown in figure 1, in the pandemic year 2020, the 
average MCS significantly declined to a level below previous 
survey  waves  since  2010.  We  find  a  0.7- point  reduction  in 
mean MCS (on the theoretical scale between 0 and 100) in 
the population in 2020 compared with the last prepandemic 
measure  (2018).  While  this  decline  points  to  a  possible 
pandemic- related impact on mental health- related quality of 
life, it is not a marked change in the overall time course and 

could be a continuation of declines seen since 2016. At the 
same time, we do not observe any change in the population 
average life satisfaction from 2019 to 2020. Considering the 
general upward trend of life satisfaction between 2010 and 
2020, the absence of change may be linked to a pandemic- 
related attenuation. In the following, we examine whether 
the  observed  trends  differ  between  population  subgroups 
with different vulnerabilities to the pandemic.

Development of MCS by vulnerability factors
As shown in figure 2, most sociodemographic groups show 
a  significant  decline  in  estimated  MCS  from  2018  to  2020 
(see online supplemental appendix table A4 for the corre-
sponding  regression  coefficients):  (1)  women  with  and 
without children as well as men without children, (2) those 
cohabiting  with  a  partner  as  well  as  those  living  without  a 
partner, (3) all age groups, (4) the native- born ethnic majority 
as well as immigrants and their descendants (but not refu-
gees) and (5) those in full- time/part- time employment, self- 
employed and those who are inactive (online supplemental 
appendix table A5 reports the main (non- interacted) effect 
of  the  dummy  variable  1  (survey  year=2020)  for  varying 
base  categories  in  vulnerability  factor  variables).  Likewise, 
following figure  3, (6) those with and without certain pre- 
existing physical health risks and (7) persons without certain 
pre- existing  mental  health  risks  show  a  significant  decline 
in  the  estimated  MCS  (see  online  supplemental  appendix 
table A6 for the corresponding regression coefficients). Yet, 
in the context of the overall trajectories since 2010, the MCS 
declines from 2018 to 2020 in the outlined groups are not of 
a remarkable magnitude or otherwise particularly striking.

Five  groups  did  not  show  estimated  MCS  declines  from 
2018  to  2020:  (1)  men  with  children,  (2)  the  marginally

employed individuals, we observed declines as well, yet, these 
were  statistically  insignificant;  however,  it  should  be  noted 

that the sample size in this group is small and limits statistical 
power. There is no evidence from the overall time trajectories 
that the absence of a decline in the other four groups may 
represent an attenuation of a previous upward trend. Even

though these groups’ MCS may have improved without the 
pandemic,  it  can  be  ruled  out  that  the  pandemic  led  to  a 
decline from previous levels. Note that individuals with prior 
mental health risks exhibit by far the lowest MCS of all groups 
throughout the observation period; the unemployed exhibit 
the second lowest levels of MCS.

Development of life satisfaction by vulnerability factors
In contrast to the results for the MCS, most sociodemo-
graphic groups do not show pronounced changes in esti-
mated  life  satisfaction  from  2019  to  2020  (see  figure  4 
and  online  supplemental  tables  A7  and  A8).  The  only 
exceptions were decreases in life satisfaction among the 
youngest  age  group  (aged  16–25  years),  full- time/part- 
time  employed,  the  self- employed  and  those  without 
pre- existing physical health risks. Persons living without a 
partner, the two oldest age groups (aged 60–74 years and 
75  years  and  over),  those  inactive  in  the  labour  market 
and the unemployed group exhibit significant increases 
in life satisfaction from 2019 to 2020. Pre- existing physical 
or mental risks are associated with a significant increase 
in life satisfaction from 2019 to 2020. In contrast, persons 
without  pre- existing  physical  risks  show  some  deterio-
ration  in  the  same  period  (figure  5  and  online  supple-
mental appendix table A9).

Looking  at  the  overall  time  trajectories  of  estimated 
life satisfaction in figures 4 and 5, none of the significant 
increases or decreases from 2019 to 2020 appear partic-
ularly  striking  in  the  context  of  the  observation  period 
between 2010 and 2020. In most groups, life satisfaction 
has  increased  gradually  over  these  10  years.  Thus,  the 
absence of a change from 2019 to 2020 could represent 
pandemic- related attenuations, while significant increases 
may  be  the  continuation  of  ongoing  trends.  Increases 

for persons without a partner, the oldest two age groups 
and  persons  with  pre- existing  physical  or  mental  risks 
visually do not stand out against the trend of increasing 
life  satisfaction  before  2019.  However,  these  increases 
are still unexpected, given that they are all found within 
hypothesised  vulnerable  groups  and  not  their  hypothe-
sised non- vulnerable counterparts. The increases among 
inactive  and  unemployed  persons  appear  slightly  more 
marked  in  the  time  course.  Concerning  the  observed 
significant  declines,  the  overall  time  trends  provide 
context  as  follows:  in  the  youngest  age  group  and  the 
employed group, decreases are relativised by year- to- year 
fluctuations of similar magnitudes before 2019. However, 
the youngest age does reach a life satisfaction score esti-
mate  numerically  below  most  previous  estimates  in  the 
observation  period.  For  the  self- employed,  it  is  quite 
striking  that  the  decrease  goes  against  a  general  trend 
of increase. The significant reduction in life satisfaction 
from 2019 to 2020 among persons without prior physical 
health  risks  also  happens  against  an  overall  increasing 
trend;  however,  2016–2017  saw  an  even  slightly  greater 
decline.

While life satisfaction results are largely inconclusive in 
light of longer time trends, it is noteworthy that despite 
the  pandemic,  several  hypothesised  vulnerable  groups 
showed an increase in life satisfaction, and many groups 
exhibit  no  change,  demonstrating  the  clear  absence  of 
a  pandemic- related  life  satisfaction  breakdown  in  most 
subgroups.  Overall,  only  4  out  of  24  groups  (youngest 
age group; full- time/part- time employed; self- employed; 
without pre- existing physical health risks) may have expe-
rienced  pandemic- related  declines  in  life  satisfaction 
compared with the year before.

DISCUSSION
Using panel data, we examined the development of mental 
health- related  quality  of  life  (measured  using  the  MCS) 
and  subjective  well- being  (indicated  by  life  satisfaction) 

in >20 000 individuals in Germany before and during the 
pandemic (2010–2020). We found a decline in the MCS 
population average from 2018 to 2020. With regard to just 
the early phases of the pandemic, our results are in line

with previous findings for Germany indicating increased 
symptoms of depression and anxiety between April 2020 
and  June  202028  36  compared  with  2019  as  well  as  April 
and  May  2020  compared  with  a  prepandemic  baseline 
(2014–2019),45 but in contrast to a study finding declining 
symptoms in this period.42 While the mean MCS score in 
2020  is  below  any  mean  score  observed  since  2010,  this 
finding needs to be evaluated in light of previous trends 
suggesting a decline from 2016 to 2018. Further research 
is therefore needed to disentangle the potential effects of 
the pandemic from general time trends. Our results for 
life satisfaction also stress the importance of longitudinal 
analyses  and  the  consideration  of  ongoing  time  trends. 
While our finding of no change in life satisfaction in 2020 
supports resilience, we observed a rising trend in life satis-
faction  in  our  data  before  2020.  Hence,  the  absence  of 
a decline from 2019 to 2020 may represent a pandemic- 
related attenuation.

Overall, our findings of declines in MCS scores and the 
absence  of  declines  in  life  satisfaction  demonstrate  the 
importance of considering several indicators for a deeper 
understanding of developments in pandemic times. One 
caveat in comparing these two measures is that they differ 
regarding temporal specifications. With the MCS, respon-
dents are asked to report on the last 4 weeks (‘How often 
in the last four weeks…’) while the assessment of life satis-
faction  is  formulated  more  generally  (translated  from  the 
German version: ‘How satisfied are you currently, all in all, with 
your life’). These temporal specifications may be particu-
larly  important  in  fast- moving  times  like  the  pandemic, 
especially  given  that  most  observations  included  in  our 
analyses  were  collected  in  the  very  early  phases  of  the 
pandemic, that is, possibly before any effects were experi-
enced as longer- lasting or more far- reaching.

With  regard  to  the  examined  candidate  vulnerability 
factors, most of our findings did not match our expecta-
tions. Starting with the vulnerability factor of gender and 
children, MCS deteriorated in all considered subgroups, 
except for fathers, whereas none of these groups experi-
enced  life  satisfaction  deterioration.  Our  results,  there-
fore, only partly conform to previous studies consistently 
reporting  pandemic- related  worsened  mental  health 
for  women8  13  and  mothers.31  However,  our  findings 
contradict  our  expectations  to  find  declines  for  parents 
(compared with non- parents). However, the stable MCS 
levels among fathers conform to previous studies pointing 
to fathers’ increased family satisfaction after changing to 
short- time  work.41  Spending  more  time  with  family,  for 
example, through working from home policies and school 
and  childcare  facility  closures,  without  bearing  most  of 
the  childcare  burden,5  may  have  dampened  the  nega-
tive effects of the pandemic for fathers. Overall, consid-
eration  of  gender  and  parental  status  proved  crucial  in 
understanding  potential  pandemic  impacts  from  the 
gender perspective.

Our  analyses  for  the  vulnerability  indicator  for  living 
arrangements  revealed  declines  in  MCS  in  both  groups 
and even a significant increase in life satisfaction among 
individuals  living  without  a  partner  compared  with  no 
change among those cohabiting with a partner. Additional 
results provided in online supplemental appendix figure 
A1 show similar developments when comparing persons 
living  alone  with  those  living  with  others  in  the  house-
hold (irrespective of partnership) based on the number 
of  persons  in  the  household.  Taken  together,  these 
results only partly support our expectations. Both groups’ 
mental health declines may hint at different risks in both 
groups: on the one hand, decreased MCS of those living

without  a  partner  might  reflect  the  challenges  imposed 
by  the  pandemic.  Social  isolation  and  loneliness  due  to 
social distancing has been highlighted as a key concern 
for  mental  health  during  the  pandemic,68  and  being 
single  has  been  previously  linked  to  greater  loneliness 
during  the  pandemic.37  On  the  other  hand,  decreased 
MCS  of  individuals  cohabiting  with  a  partner  might  be 
related  to  external  stress  due  to  the  pandemic,  such  as 
autonomy- connection  tensions.69  This  external  stress  is 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  marital  dissolution 
and  challenges  the  partnership  as  such,  exacerbating 
existing problems or creating new ones.70 71 Our findings 
of a potential attenuation of life satisfaction among those 
living with a partner but not among those living without 
a partner may also relate to these stressors. In sum, these 
results,  and  the  challenge  they  pose  for  interpretation 
highlight the complexity of potential risk and resilience 
factors.

We found MCS declines from 2018 to 2020 for all age 
groups,  contrary  to  our  hypotheses  of  an  increased  risk 
for  decline  among  the  youngest  and  the  eldest.  For  life 
satisfaction, we found increases from 2019 to 2020 for the 
older age groups (60–74 years and 75+ years), contrary to 
our hypotheses and decreases for those aged 16–25 years, 
in  keeping  with  our  hypotheses.  These  declines  in  life 
satisfaction and those in MCS of the youngest age group 
support the previous literature showing high psycholog-
ical  distress  for  young  adults  during  the  pandemic.26  27 
Early adulthood functions as a critical period and includes 
necessary steps for interpersonal development like iden-
tity  formation,  separation  from  childhood  family  or 
significant  decisions  for  education  and  career  develop-
ment.72  73  Social  isolation  measures  and  school  closures 
drastically affected the daily life of young adults.

For the vulnerability factor immigration status, we found 
deteriorating MCS from 2018 to 2020 for all (including 
those of the native- born ethnic majority) except refugees 
and no change in life satisfaction from 2019 to 2020 for 
any of these groups. Our results for refugees are consis-
tent with Entringer et al,46 who found no increase in refu-
gees’ psychological distress from 2016 or 2019 to 2020. At 
this point, it remains unclear whether the results are due 
to changes in refugee population compositions, as those 
with poorer mental health were more likely to have left 
Germany.46  Our  results  for  life  satisfaction  also  contrast 
with  the  study  by  Goßner  et  al,25  who  revealed  negative 
effects  for  the  specific  event  of  the  second  nationwide 
lockdown  in  Germany  on  refugees’  life  satisfaction. 
Hence, a closer look at specific time periods might yield 
different results. The absence of significant drops in refu-
gees’ MCS in our analyses could be attributed to different 
underlying  factors.  First,  refugees’  mental  health  may 
improve  over  time  in  the  host  country  as  postmigration 
stressors decrease and individuals become better adapted 
to the new environment,74 mitigating or eliminating any 
potential  negative  pandemic  effects.  Second,  refugee 
populations may also be more resilient to stressors (such 
as the pandemic) because of their previous experiences 

10

and personal characteristics.75 It should also be noted that 
different field periods might limit comparability between 
groups by migration status. However, these differences do 
not affect the finding of an absence of pandemic- related 
declines in the refugee population.

Our  findings  for  MCS  and  life  satisfaction  among 
employed  (negative  effects)  and  unemployed  (positive 
or  no  effects)  individuals  resonate  with  the  results  for 
the  UK  showing  increased  mental  distress  for  individ-
uals  employed  before  the  pandemic  and  no  such  effect 
for those unemployed or inactive.27 However, we do not 
examine  the  possible  impact  of  becoming  unemployed 
during  the  pandemic,  which  has  been  associated  with 
heightened  depression  symptoms  in  Germany.76  The 
negative  trend  for  the  self- employed  group  in  both  the 
MCS  and  life  satisfaction  is  consistent  with  findings  for 
the UK highlighting psychological distress among the self- 
employed during the pandemic.77 Financial worries seem 
to mediate the pandemic’s impact on mental distress,78 79 
as  the  self- employed  were  more  likely  to  expect  income 
losses  during  the  pandemic  and  were  less  likely  to  be 
considered 
in  government  assistance  programmes. 
Contrary  to  our  expectations,  the  marginally  employed 
exhibited  no  MCS  declines.  However,  the  observation 
numbers  for  this  group  are  small  yielding  low  statistical 
power.  Mixed  results  were  also  found  for  the  inactive 
with decreasing MCS and increasing life satisfaction from 
the last prepandemic observation to 2020. We take from 
these results that the choice of measure for psychological 
well- being needs to be carefully considered and the use 
of  multiple  measures  is  critical  to  check  the  robustness 
of results.

Contrary to our expectations, there was no discernible 
difference  in  MCS  trajectories  between  individuals  with 
pre- existing  physical  health  risks  and  those  without  in 
2020. Patterns in life satisfaction were the direct opposite 
of our hypothesis, as the group with pre- existing physical 
health  conditions  displayed  an  increase  between  2019 
and 2020, while the other group experienced a decrease. 
Although the former group’s increase in life satisfaction 
could  potentially  be  attributed  to  a  pre- existing  upward 
trend  observed  since  2016,  the  absence  of  any  poten-
tial  pandemic  effects  is  still  surprising,  considering  the 
heightened risk of severe COVID- 19 cases15 in this group. 
A potential explanation for these results is that the pre- 
existing  conditions  were  defined  as  self- reported  past 
diagnoses,  and  some  subset  of  individuals  in  this  group 
had  fully  recovered  (long)  before  the  pandemic  wave 
survey,  and  thus  did  not  perceive  a  greater  threat  from 
COVID- 19.  Alternatively,  these  individuals’  overall  well- 
being  may  have  improved  due  to  recovery  or  even  just 
with time having passed since diagnosis, thereby masking 
potential deleterious effects of the pandemic.

For  individuals  with  pre- existing  mental  health  risks, 
we found no change in the MCS from 2018 to 2020 and 
an  improvement  in  life  satisfaction  from  2019  to  2020. 
Given the previous developments over the years, neither 
finding  stands  out,  making  the  pandemic  impact  on 

Jaschke P, et al. BMJ Open 2023;13:e071331. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2022-071331pre- existing  mental  health  risks  unclear.  At  the  same 
time, we find a decline in the MCS and no change in life 
satisfaction  for  individuals  without  pre- existing  mental 
health risks. While these results contrast our expectations 
and some previous literature,8 80 81 a systematic review and 
meta- analysis  present  comparable  results  revealing  no 
evidence of a change in symptoms at the beginning of the 
pandemic  among  those  with  pre- existing  mental  health 
conditions,  while  overall  increases  in  symptoms  were 
found compared with prepandemic levels.11 The authors 
of  this  meta- analysis  argue  that  this  may  be  due  to  the 
positive impacts of lifestyle changes linked to transmission 
mitigation  measures  for  this  group  as  well  as  to  regres-
sion  to  the  mean  effects,  whereby  recovery  processes 
result in improvements in mental health outcomes over 
time  in  those  with  pre- existing  conditions.  Likewise, 
increased  mental  health  problems  at  the  beginning  of 
the pandemic were noted among persons without a pre- 
existing clinical depression diagnosis compared with no 
change  among  persons  with  such  diagnosis  in  the  UK82 
and  even  improvements  in  those  with  the  most  severe 
mental health disorder burden in the Netherlands.83

The  results  of  the  development  of  MCS  during  the 
pandemic raise the question of clinical relevance. Among 
all groups, the MCS declines from the last prepandemic 
observation by no more than about one point on the theo-
retical 100- point scale. Although this average decline is of 
small magnitude, some groups may experience effects that 
are of clinical relevance. To explore the clinical relevance 
of our findings, we dichotomised the MCS according to 
a  threshold  identified  as  clinically  relevant  in  previous 
studies  of  the  SF- 12- based  MCS.  Specifically,  the  cut- off 
value of 45 has been found to have high predictive accu-
racy of depression and anxiety disorders, for example, in 
the Australian general population comparing the MCS- 12 
with  physician  diagnoses60  and  in  six  European  coun-
tries, where scores on the MCS- 12 were compared with a 
WHO- issued method (CIDI 3.0) for determining mental 
disorders  in  in- depth  interviews.61  The  replications  of 
our main results are shown in online supplemental tables 
A10  and  A11  (regressions)  and  in  online  supplemental 
appendix  figures  A2  and  A3  (corresponding  predictive 
margins). Conforming to our main results, fathers, those 
living  without  a  partner,  refugees  and  persons  with  pre- 
existing mental health risks are less likely to fall below the 
threshold  of  45  during  the  pandemic  than  their  corre-
sponding  comparison  groups  if  there  were  above  this 
threshold before. For the comparison groups, the prob-
ability  of  falling  below  the  clinically  relevant  threshold 
increases by four to five percentage points.

Limitations
We need to address some limitations. First, the distribu-
tion of interview modes in SOEP has changed during the 
pandemic  due  to  legal  contact  restrictions  and  volun-
tary  self- protection  measures  of  respondents  and  inter-
viewers.84  The  survey  methodology  literature  has  found 
effects  of  survey  mode,  particularly  when  collecting 

Open access

health data,85 with face- to- face surveys leading to a higher 
response  rate86  and  fewer  reports  on  mental  health 
problems.87  In  the  2020  survey,  the  switch  to  telephone 
interviews (CAPI- TEL) was above average among refugee 
respondents, while self- administered interviews were not 
offered  to  these  groups.  Among  other  respondents,  the 
share of CAPI interviews decreased from 68% to 39% from 
2019 to 2020 and self- administered interviews increased to 
just under one- third.84 Against this background, it cannot 
be  ruled  out  that  (a)  changes  in  survey  mode  prepan-
demic versus peripandemic may affect time trends in the 
observed indicators and that (b) different adjustments in 
interview mode between refugees and non- refugees may 
distort the group comparisons in health indicators.

Second, our data are representative of adult individuals 
living  in  private  households  in  Germany.  Since  healthy 
individuals  are  over- represented  in  such  surveys,88  it 
is  to  be  expected  that  individuals  who  are  not  encoun-
tered privately due to particularly severe courses of illness 
(eg,  due  to  hospitalisation)  are  systematically  under- 
represented in our sample. During the 2020 field period 
(January 2020 to February 2021), about 10% were hospi-
talised.4 However, with just over 2.2 million reported cases 
of  infection  by  the  end  of  January  2021,89  only  a  small 
share of the population had contact with the virus, even 
taking into account unreported cases that may be many 
times  higher.  Hence,  we  expect  the  bias  due  to  such 
systematic  wave  drop- outs  to  be  small  and  consider  the 
pandemic effects we measured as representing conserva-
tive lower limits.

Third,  since  a  substantial  share  of  observations  came 
from  before  phase  I  of  the  pandemic  in  Germany,  and 
most of the rest of our data only captures the initial phase 
of  the  pandemic,  these  may  have  resulted  in  underesti-
mation of any pandemic- related effects on mental health 
and subjective well- being. On the one hand, the first year 
of  the  pandemic  may  have  been  particularly  stressful  in 
some regard (lack of knowledge of the virus’ biology and 
health  risk,  first- time  contact  restrictions,  etc).  On  the 
other hand, there is some empirical evidence for mental 
health declines, particularly in later stages, starting from 
late  2020.42  We  are  also  unable  to  assess  any  potential 
changes within 2020 to examine, for example, the poten-
tial  impacts  of  lockdown  given  that  the  overwhelming 
majority  of  our  data  in  the  pandemic  survey  wave  was 
collected before the restrictions under the first lockdown 
were gradually relaxed.

Fourth,  we  cannot  make  a  concluding  statement 
regarding  the  resilience  of  the  most  vulnerable  groups. 
They  could  reflect  an  individual  psychological  state 
resulting  from  prepandemic  hardships,  which  taught 
them  coping  strategies,  or  reflect  successful  political 
measures  implemented  to  alleviate  hardships.  It  may 
also  be  that  efforts  to  contain  the  spread  of  the  virus 
even  conferred  some  advantages  to  specific  groups,  for

implemented  different  anti- COVID- 19  measures  would 
be necessary.

Fifth, certain relevant vulnerability factors were beyond 
the scope of this study, primarily due to data limitations. 
For instance, while income or wealth levels have a strong 
correlation with the examined employment dimensions, 
they  were  not  explicitly  included  in  this  study,  despite 
their potential relevance to mental health and well- being 
during  the  pandemic.  Furthermore,  we  were  unable  to 
assess the impact of pandemic- related changes to employ-
ment, such as remote working or job loss.

CONCLUSION
The present study adds to a growing literature on mental 
health and well- being development in the first pandemic 
year. It is among the rare studies that are nationally repre-
sentative,  longitudinal,  include  representative  estimates 
from  migrant  and  refugee  populations  and  stands  out 
for  its  10- year  prepandemic  observation  period.  Yearly 
or  biannual  estimates  this  far  back  in  time  before  the 
pandemic  allow  for  a  more  comprehensive  contextuali-
sation and assessment of the significance of any potential 
pandemic- related changes.

From  a  broader  perspective,  our  results  reveal  three 
points.  First,  the  findings  for  pandemic  impact  must 
be  contextualised  into  long- term  developments.  As  we 
show,  changes  from  the  last  prepandemic  observation 
to 2020 were several times put into a different perspec-
tive when considering overall time trends. Second, our 
study  shows  pronounced  differences  between  vulnera-
bility  groups,  confirming  that  the  pandemic  did  affect 
some  subgroups  disproportionally,  and  that  vulnera-
bility  factors  are  worthy  of  consideration.  Third,  given 
the  cases  where  we  found  different  effects  on  mental 
health compared with life satisfaction, our study shows 
the importance of considering other measures to assess 
the psychological impact of stressful events such as the 
pandemic.

Our  results  indicate  resilience  in  certain  populations 
that  were  initially  presumed  to  be  most  vulnerable  to 
pandemic- induced  stressors,  highlighting  the  need  for 
future research to delve into the underlying mechanisms. 
Putting  aside  the  aforementioned  limitations,  our  find-
ings  imply  that  vulnerability  to  novel  stressors  cannot 
be  anticipated  and  that  measures  to  protect  mental 
health  and  well- being  in  crises  may  need  to  be  more 
broadly  targeted.  Preventive  measures  to  increase  resil-
ience  could  include  the  provision  of  educational  mate-
rial  to  improve  mental  health  literacy,  and  information 
on developing self- help strategies, mindfulness skills and 
positive coping mechanisms.90 91 Alongside these preven-
tive measures, it remains crucial to ensure the availability 
of psychological support for individuals who experienced 
lasting  pandemic- related  declines  in  mental  health  and 
well- being.
