Fear, which can be expressed innately or after conditioning, is triggered when a danger or a stimulus predicting immediate
danger is perceived. Its role is to prepare the body to face this danger. However, dysfunction in fear processing can lead to
psychiatric disorders in which fear outweighs the danger or possibility of harm. Although recognized as highly debilitating,
pathological fear remains insufficiently treated, indicating the importance of research on fear processing. The neurobiolog-
ical basis of normal and pathological fear reactions is reviewed in this article. Innate and learned fear mechanisms, partic-
ularly those involving the amygdala, are considered. These fear mechanisms are also distinguished in specific phobias, which
can indeed be nonexperiential (implicating innate, learning-independent mechanisms) or experiential (implicating learning-
dependent mechanisms). Poor habituation and poor extinction are presented as dysfunctional mechanisms contributing to
persistence of nonexperiential and experiential phobias, respectively.

Fear is an emotion of anticipation that is triggered when a situation
that is at risk for our safety and/or the safety of others is perceived,
through either exteroceptive inputs or the endocrine and auto-
nomic nervous systems (interoceptive inputs). To prepare the
body to face this danger, these stimuli can evoke “freeze, ﬂight,
ﬁght, fright” reactions (Bracha 2004) or “tend-and-befriend”
responses (such as turning to others for help or social support,
or making a situation less tense, dangerous, or uncomfortable in
some way) (Taylor et al. 2000). At the neurobiological level, signiﬁ-
cant advances have been made in identifying fear circuits and
mechanisms; dysfunctions in these circuits/mechanisms can lead
to chronic psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and various types of phobia, including speciﬁc
phobias. Indeed, available treatments that aim to reduce patholog-
ical fear are associated with decreased symptom severity, but up to
40% of patients show only partial long-term beneﬁt, while most of
them fail to achieve complete remission (Singewald et al. 2015).

Speciﬁc phobias are extreme and persistent fears of certain
objects, situations, or activities, or persons. Additionally, people
who suffer from speciﬁc phobias work hard to avoid their phobia
stimuli even though they know there is no threat or danger, but
they feel powerless to stop their irrational fear. Dogs, heights, tun-
nels, darkness, water, ﬂying, and injuries involving blood are a few
of the more common irrational fears. While PTSD is always caused
by a traumatic event, speciﬁc phobia can result from either a trau-
matic event (experiential-speciﬁc phobia) or not (nonexperiential-
speciﬁc phobia).

Nonexperiential or nonassociative speciﬁc phobia is caused
and activated by stimuli that arouse fear without previous direct
or indirect associative learning. Genetic, familial, environmental,
or developmental factors play an important role in the develop-
ment of this type of speciﬁc phobia. For instance, many children
experience fear of darkness, which, in certain cases, may be sensi-
tized. Sensitization is a form of nonassociative learning manifested
by exaggerated emotional reactions to speciﬁc stimuli (e.g., nycto-
phobia, fear of darkness, is characterized by sensitized fear during
exposure to darkness or during anticipation to darkness exposure).

Sensitization may serve the functional purpose of detecting
threats. At brain level, it is a stimulus-speciﬁc increase of neuronal
responses. In nonexperiential phobia, it is suggested to be support-
ed by dysfunction in “learning-independent” fear circuits (i.e.,
circuits that include the amygdala and drive defensive behavior
without prior learning) (Rosen et al. 2015). For example, in most
children, darkness may activate the amygdala. However, this
amygdala activation may be exaggerated (sensitized) in children
who develop nyctophobia, due to the pathological changes in
the excitability threshold in fear circuits. Another feature is the
lack of habituation. Habituation is also a form of nonassociative
learning, which is manifested by reduced emotional reactions
to repeatedly presented stimuli. It may serve the functional pur-
pose of protecting the brain from ﬂooding with sensory informa-
tion considered, with time, as irrelevant. At brain level, it is a
stimulus-speciﬁc decrement of neuronal responses to repeatedly
presented stimuli. For example, fear of the dark is often lost over
time through repeated exposure to darkness without any harm.
This may be characterized by a decrement of amygdala activation
in response to repeatedly darkness exposure. A deﬁciency in this
mechanism (i.e., amygdala habituation) may therefore contribute
to the persistence of nonexperiential phobia.

Experiential-speciﬁc phobia results from an unfortunate
experience. It has been suggested that its acquisition is due to clas-
sical fear conditioning, while its maintenance is due to operant fear
conditioning, which, in turn, reinforces the avoidance behavior
(Tillfors 2004). Experimental studies show that classical fear condi-
tioning can occur by associating the presentation of a neutral cue,
like a sound, with an aversive event,
like an electric shock.
Following training, the presentation of the cue (or conditioned
stimulus), in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus, causes
fear behaviors. Fear can also be acquired through other ways, in-
cluding an observational conditioning, as shown in primates
(Cook et al. 1985; Mineka and Cook 1993) and in rodents (Chen
et al. 2009; Jeon et al. 2010). In observational conditioning, a

subject A observes a conspeciﬁc B experiencing classical fear condi-
tioning. Following training, the subject A displays fear behaviors
when later exposed to the conditioned stimulus alone. These ﬁnd-
ings demonstrate the social transmission of fear. Interestingly,
mechanisms involved in observational conditioning and those of
direct classical conditioning are similar (Mineka and Cook 1993).
However, only studies using direct classical conditioning paradigm
have largely contributed to the characterization of the circuits and
mechanisms underlying fear conditioning (LeDoux 2014; Maren
2015). Behavioral abnormalities relative to experiential-speciﬁc
phobia may therefore be supported by dysfunctions in these
“learning-dependent” fear circuits and mechanisms. In this case,
one possible dysfunction is deﬁciency in extinction (i.e., a failure
to acquire a reduction of conditioned response through repeated
presentations of a conditioned stimulus), explaining maintenance
of experiential-speciﬁc phobia.

This review focuses mainly on the involvement of the amyg-
dala in normal innate fear and dysfunction of innate fear in
nonexperiential phobia and amygdala mechanisms of classical
fear conditioning and their potential involvement in experiential
phobia.

Rodent and primate studies on substrates
of innate fear

Evidence accumulated from animal studies and human lesion and
neuroimaging data indicate that the amygdala plays a pivotal role
in innate fear (Table 1). For example, odors from predators are

ecologically relevant stimuli used by prey animals as warnings
for the presence of danger. These odors are not painful, but they
have innate threat-like properties. This is also true in laboratory
rodents that have been bred in animal colonies for generations
without exposure to predators. Studies with adolescent (Chan
et al. 2011) and adult (Dielenberg et al. 2001; McGregor et al.
2004) rats and adult mice (Janitzky et al. 2015) show that exposure
to a cat odor induces fear responses, which are associated with
increases of the number of Fos-positive cells in the amygdala, peri-
aqueductal gray, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, bed nucleus of the
stria terminalis, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and
the locus coeruleus. These substrates are interconnected with pro-
jections from the amygdala, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and
bed nucleus of the stria terminalis to the periaqueductal gray con-
trolling responses such as freezing (Vianna and Brandão 2003;
Chan et al. 2011). Particularly, inactivation of the prelimbic area
decreases freezing and abolishes Fos expression in the periaqueduc-
tal gray (Chan et al. 2011). In monkeys, fear can be assessed in
laboratory by placing the animal alone in an isolated cage. An un-
familiar human enters the room, avoids any eye contact with the
animal and leaves the room, and enters again, remains motionless
while staring at the animal. In this second condition, animal ex-
presses innate fear behaviors, including freezing. Based on this
human intruder paradigm, it has been found that bilateral lesions
of the central amygdala abolish animal fear responses (Kalin et al.
2004). In a human study, it has been reported that bilateral calciﬁ-
cation and atrophy of the amygdala is associated with impairment
of the recognition of fear in facial expressions (Adolphs et al. 1995).

conﬁrmed the involvement of the amygdala in fear, by demon-
strating that viewing fearful faces activates this speciﬁc brain re-
gion (Wright et al. 2006). In another study (Mobbs et al. 2010),
participants were placed in a neuroimaging apparatus and asked
to position their foot with the shoe removed into an open-topped
imminence box (they believed that they could observe, via a cam-
era feed, the experimenter moving a live tarantula closer or further
away from their foot in real time). As the tarantula was placed clos-
er to a subject’s foot, there was an increased activity in the amygda-
la, periaqueductal gray, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.
Interestingly projections of the amygdala to the bed nucleus of
the stria terminalis control stress reactions involving the pituitary
axis (Crestani et al. 2013).

Under resting conditions, the amygdala is inhibited by an
extensive γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) network and amygdala
neurons exhibit low ﬁring rates (Quirk and Gehlert 2003). The
reduction of GABAergic activity is therefore required to lower
the threshold for amygdala activation and facilitates amygdala ac-
tivation, necessary to expression of fear. This idea is, in part, sup-
ported by a study demonstrating that injections of muscimol, a
GABAA receptor agonist that increases GABAergic inhibition,
into the basolateral amygdala blocks predator odor-induced fear
behavior (Müller and Fendt 2006). Dopamine and norepinephrine
may play key roles in amygdala activation in response to predator
scent. First, predator odor causes increased dopamine metabolism
in the amygdala (Morrow et al. 2000), which, in turn, reduces
GABAergic inhibitory control (Marowsky et al. 2005). Second,
absorption of reboxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitor that increases the levels of norepinephrine, has been
reported to increase basolateral amygdala responses to fearful faces
(Onur et al. 2009); the norepinephrine signaling being involved
in facilitation of GABAergic inhibition in the same area (Skelly
et al. 2017). In addition, a human pharmacological study with
propranolol, a compound blocking the action of epinephrine
and norepinephrine, shows that this treatment reduces basolateral
amygdala reactivity (Hurlemann et al. 2010), while, in rodents, it
impairs unlearned fear to predatory threats (Do Monte et al.
2008). Increased amygdala activity enhances, in turn, activity of
the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus through direct
projections (Gray et al. 1989). The pituitary gland is therefore
activated from corticotrophin releasing hormone released by the
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland
increases, in turn, the levels of peripheral adrenocorticotropic
hormone, which stimulates the adrenal glands to secrete glucocor-
ticoids (mainly cortisol in primates and corticosterone in rodents).
This is supported by several fear studies, both in primates and
rodents. A rodent study (Muñoz-Abellán et al. 2011) showed
that the odor of a predator increases plasma levels of peripheral
adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone. In monkeys,
the human intruder paradigm also induces increases in plasma
levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone and
central levels of corticotrophin releasing hormone. Lesions of
the central amygdala, inducing reduction in innate fear, are also
accompanied by a signiﬁcant decrease in levels of these hormones
(Kalin et al. 2004). The peripheral hormonal and autonomic re-
sponses mediated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis
play particularly adaptive roles in responding to threat from fear
processing in the amygdala (and extending amygdala: the bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis). The adaptive roles initiated
by activation of this axis include increased cardiovascular tone, re-
spiratory rate, and intermediate metabolism, along with inhibi-
tion of general vegetative functions such as feeding, digestion,
growth, reproduction, and immunity (Sapolsky et al. 2000). In
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis is closely
addition,
linked to another axis, the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis
(Viau 2002), with the ability to inhibit each other (Fenchel et al.

Fear and phobias

2015). For example, as shown recently in a rodent study
(Fenchel et al. 2015), testosterone (a product of the hypothalam-
ic–pituitary–gonadal axis) and corticosterone levels are lower
and higher, respectively, in animals exposed to predator scent,
while there are higher and lower, respectively, in unexposed
animals. However, although testosterone has repeatedly been
shown to have anxiolytic properties in rodents, ﬁndings in pri-
mates are more mixed. In monkeys, Suarez-Jimenez et al. (2013)
reported that animals exposed to an unfamiliar human staring
directly at them (i.e., the human intruder paradigm) exhibited
less anxious behaviors when given a treatment lowering testoster-
one levels.

Serotonin, or 5-hydroxotryptamine (5-HT), has also been ex-
amined given its involvement in a range of functions including
regulation of emotional states such as mood and anxiety. The
amygdala receives dense serotonergic projections from the dorsal
raphe nucleus and expresses multiple subtypes of 5-HT receptors
(Sadikot and Parent 1990). Studies with 5-HT knockout mice
have shown a reduction in binding density and/or function of
5-HT1A receptors in several brain areas, including the amygdala
(e.g., Li et al. 2000) and facilitation of anxiety-like behaviors (for
review, see Adamec et al. 2008). Importantly, administration of
vilazodone, an agonist of these 5-HT receptors, following predator
stress interferes with the development of anxiety-related changes
(Adamec et al. 2004), supporting the involvement of reduced
5-HT activity in the amygdala in mechanisms of innate fear. It
has been suggested that 5-HT inhibits fear circuits in the amygdala
likely through local action on GABAergic interneurons (Lee et al.
2013).

Potential mechanism of persistent fear
in nonexperiential-specific phobia

Brain circuits of fear are also activated in phobic patients, but to sig-
niﬁcantly greater levels than in healthy individuals. For example,
as seen above, the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
display increases in activity in response to a threat stimulus. In a
recent study, it has been reported that phobic patients have signiﬁ-
cantly higher activation of these areas than controls in response to
threat (Münsterkötter et al. 2015). Moreover, the same authors
found enhancement of functional connectivity between the two
neuroanatomical substrates in phobic subjects (Münsterkötter
et al. 2015). Other neuroanatomical substrates that show an exag-
gerated anxiety response to threat, as shown recently with spider
pictures in spider phobics, are the mid insula, dorsal anterior cingu-
late, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (Zilverstand et al. 2017).
Another recent study has also shown a decrease in parietal process-
ing in speciﬁc phobia, suggesting attentional avoidance of affective
stimuli (Klahn et al. 2017).

Studies on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), a
class of drugs that enhance 5-HT, have indicated that these drugs
are effective for phobias (Cassano et al. 2002). Interestingly,
improvement of speciﬁc phobias with SSRI is accompanied by de-
creased regional cerebral blood ﬂow in the amygdala (Fredrikson
and Furmark 2003), revealing that low levels of 5-HT in the amyg-
dala may be involved in the pathophysiology of phobia. This is
conﬁrmed by a positron emission tomography study showing a
signiﬁcantly lower 5-HT1A receptor binding in the amygdala and
insula (Lanzenberger et al. 2007).

As seen for normal fear, phobias are also characterized by
changes affecting the dopaminergic and GABAergic systems. This
is supported, in part, by the fact that patients with Parkinson’s
disease, which is associated with dopamine dysfunction, seem to
have increased risk for developing phobia (Richard 2005). It has
also been found that monoamine oxidase inhibitors, a potentially

dopamine-enhancing class of drugs, are effective in treating
phobia (Ipser et al. 2008). Regarding GABAergic changes, treat-
ment with GABA uptake inhibitor tiagabine, a potentially GABA-
enhancing drug, is also effective in treating phobia (Dunlop et al.
2007), indicating reduction of GABAergic tonic inhibition in the
amygdala of phobic patients. Animal studies have shown that
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex inhibits the amygdala by acti-
vating intra-amygdala GABAergic interneurons (Paré et al. 2004).
Decreased GABAergic activity may, in addition, result from reduc-
tion of this down-regulation of amygdala activity. Indeed, phobic
patients are characterized by diminished responses in the ventro-
medial prefrontal cortex during provocation of phobic reactions
(Hermann et al. 2007, 2009). In another study, the authors (Kerr
et al. 2012) found that phobic patients exhibit greater activity in
the same cortical area during the anticipation of phobic stimuli
under conditions of control over stimulus presentation when com-
pared with conditions without any control. In addition, this study
also conﬁrms the inhibition of the amygdala by the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex.

Sensitization-associated increased amygdala activity is a key
amygdala mechanism contributing to fear sensitization in nonex-
periential phobia. Direct support of this idea comes from animal
studies. For example, predator stress can induce long-lasting
enhancement of right amygdala afferent and efferent neural trans-
mission, which likely mediates behavioral effects (Adamec et al.
2005). Repeated predator exposure (in a procedure allowing ani-
mals to see, hear, and smell each other, but without any physical
contact) induces long-lasting sensitization of basolateral amygdala
norepinephrine receptors via a corticotropin-releasing factor re-
ceptor 1-dependent mechanism, as revealed by double-immuno-
ﬂuorescence labeling on days 11 and 28 after stress (Rajbhandari
et al. 2016). In other words, norepinephrine sensitization may
provoke reduced GABAergic inhibition control, which may result
in both reduction in amygdala activation threshold and hyperex-
citability of the amygdala by threat stimuli. This dysfunction
may be part of mechanisms that provoke persistent fear in nonex-
periential phobia (Table 2).

Innate fear of stimuli such as animals, darkness, and heights
is frequent in children. These innate fears gradually diminish
with time, with repeated, nontraumatic exposure to the feared ob-
ject or situation, a phenomenon known as habituation. However,
children with poor habituation are at high risk of developing
nonexperiential-speciﬁc phobias. In laboratory, freezing habitua-
tion can be observed in rats exposed, over a period of days, to
a cat odor (e.g., Dielenberg and McGregor 1999), but there are
also contradictory data (e.g., Wallace and Rosen 2000). Studies in
healthy humans (Fischer et al. 2003; Herry et al. 2007; Denny
et al. 2014) and mice (Herry et al. 2007) indicate that habituation
is associated with decreased activity in the amygdala. In other
word, persistence of amygdala activity characterizes poor habitua-
tion. Nonexperiential phobia may therefore be characterized by
reduced amygdala habituation, responsible of fear persistence in
patients with this type of phobia (Table 2).

Fear and phobias

Animal studies on mechanisms of fear conditioning

One of the most signiﬁcant properties of the nervous system is its
ability to modify its structure and function in response to experi-
ence. At the synaptic level, this ability is characterized by synaptic
plasticity (i.e., activity-dependent changes of the strength of syn-
aptic transmission). Synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potenti-
ation (LTP), which is an increase in synaptic efﬁcacy, at appropriate
synapses during memory formation is believed to be both neces-
sary and sufﬁcient for storage of information (Garcia 2001;
Lynch 2004), including fear conditioning (LeDoux 2014; Maren
2015).

In fear conditioning, innate fear response (e.g., freezing) can
be converted into learned response when fear is evoked (for in-
stance with a footshock application) during or immediately after
the presentation of a neutral stimulus (e.g., a sound). The neutral
stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus (an aversive stimulus)
because it is capable of evoking by itself the fear response (freez-
ing). This example of classical fear conditioning corresponds to au-
ditory fear conditioning. It is the only example that is reviewed
below to examine mechanisms of fear conditioning.

The amygdala, which is critical for innate fear, is also critical
for auditory fear conditioning, as revealed in rats with lesions
targeting the lateral nucleus (LeDoux et al. 1990; Sheng et al.
2015). It is now well established that during training, information
from the auditory stimulus and information from the nociceptive
stimulus (footshock application) converge onto the basolateral
amygdala complex (for a recent review, see Silva et al. 2016).
Excitatory auditory inputs from the medial geniculate body are
directly and indirectly, through the auditory cortex, conveyed to
the amygdala. Regarding excitatory nociceptive inputs from the
spinal and trigeminal dorsal horn, they seem to reach the amygda-
la through two pathways: via a spino-thalamic tract (Bienvenu
et al. 2015) and via a spino-periaqueductal–thalamic pathway
(Johansen et al. 2010). In the search of mechanisms at the basis
of fear conditioning, it is therefore possible to place a stimulation
electrode in the auditory thalamus or in the bundle of ﬁbers con-
necting the auditory thalamus to the amygdala and a recording
electrode in the basolateral complex of the amygdala, and more
speciﬁcally in the lateral nucleus. Two major discoveries derive
from this approach. First, LTP is induced in this pathway by means
of high-frequency stimulation (Humeau et al. 2007). Second, au-
ditory fear conditioning also induces LTP-like changes in the
same pathway (Sigurdsson et al. 2007). Given that high-frequency
stimulation and fear conditioning induce similar long-term en-
hancement of synaptic efﬁcacy in the thalamo–amygdala path-
way, LTP and LTP-like changes may share similar cellular and
molecular mechanisms, which may underlie the basis of fear learn-
ing and memory. The ﬁrst mechanism is the increase of glutamate
release with high-frequency stimulation. Fear conditioning also
provokes an increase in glutamate release in the amygdala
(Venton et al. 2006). The second mechanism related to the applica-
tion of high-frequency stimulation is an increase of postsynaptic

depolarization, which can also be seen with fear conditioning
(Rogan et al. 1997). In both cases, the depolarization results
from the increase of amount of glutamate-evoked current that
ﬂows into the postsynaptic cell through α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-
methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). Among
AMPARs,
the subunit glutamate receptor 1 is involved in
AMPAR-dependent amygdala LTP and fear conditioning, as dem-
onstrated in a study using knockout mice (Humeau et al. 2007).
The third mechanism is calcium entry into postsynaptic cells,
through several channels, and mostly N-methyl-D-aspartate re-
ceptors (NMDARs) and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels
(VGCCs). LTP can require NMDARs or L-type VGCCs depending
on electrical stimulation paradigm (Bauer et al. 2002). Blockade
of NMDARs alters both short-term and long-term fear memory,
while blockade of L-type VGCCs impairs only long-term fear
memory. The rise in calcium in the postsynaptic cell triggers, in
turn, a cascade of intracellular processes that ultimately induce
synaptic enhancement. This includes an increase of the autophos-
phorylated (active) form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase II (CaMKII) in lateral amygdala spines (Rodrigues et al.
2004). Interestingly, intra-amygdala infusion of a CaMKII inhibi-
tor blocks short-term fear memory during conditioning, but not
already established memory (Rodrigues et al. 2004). In addition,
the same treatment also impairs LTP induction (Rodrigues et al.
2004). The other intracellular cascade resulting from the rise of in-
tracellular calcium is the production of retrograde massagers, such
as nitric oxide. Disrupting nitric oxide signaling also results in
marked suppression of LTP induction in the lateral amygdala
and impairment of long-term fear memory (Schafe et al. 2005).
Nitric oxide acts as a retrograde messenger turning on presynaptic
signaling cascades through activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase
and cGMP-dependent protein kinase. As for nitric oxide, disrup-
tion of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and particularly its
type I isoform, causes a marked reduction of freezing behavior
to a conditioned tone and a decrease of LTP in the lateral amygda-
la (Paul et al. 2008). Considering that most of these studies were
done with a transient form of LTP in the lateral amygdala, while
fear conditioning may require enduring changes for long-term
memory, it is conceivable that there is another form of LTP, which
is enduring. This enduring form exists and depends on gene ex-
pression and on new protein synthesis, through stimulation of
the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding proteins
(CREB) in amygdala cells (Huang et al. 2000). By manipulating
CREB function in the lateral amygdala principal neurons in
mice, it has been shown that neurons with high levels of CREB
have more dendritic spines, while neurons with low CREB func-
tion have relatively fewer spines compared with control neurons
(Sargin et al. 2013). Poor fear memory characterizes mice with
low CREB function (Sargin et al. 2013), conﬁrming the critical
role of CREB in fear conditioning.

Potential mechanisms of persistent fear
in experiential-specific phobia

Studies on the conditioning of fear in phobias indicate that fear is
high in phobic compared with nonphobic subjects. However,
there are studies indicating exaggerated general conditionability
in phobia (Lissek et al. 2008; Vriends et al. 2012), while in
other
studies there was either no general conditionability
(Hermann et al. 2002; Schweckendiek et al. 2011) or exaggerated
conditionability only with phobia-related conditioned stimuli
(Schweckendiek et al. 2011). The authors also found that phobic
subjects display higher amygdala activation in response to the
phobia-related conditioned stimulus than to the nonphobia-
related conditioned stimulus. In another study, the authors

Fear and phobias

(Vriends et al. 2012) found a stronger conditioning effect in ﬂying
phobia. Particularly, compared with healthy controls, patients
with ﬂying phobia rated conditioned stimuli more frightening.
Lissek et al. (2008), using facial expressions as socially relevant
stimuli, but no disorder-unrelated unconditioned stimulus, found
that only phobic patients, when compared with healthy controls,
develop conditioned fear. In an earlier study (Hermann et al.
2002), aversive conditioning was performed using neutral faces
as conditioned stimulus and an unpleasant odor as unconditioned
stimulus. Despite the lack of an enhanced conditionability in the
phobic group, extinction (i.e., a learning process in which new
non-fear memory traces are established, which inhibit the old
fear memories) was impaired (Hermann et al. 2002).

Although the above studies do not all demonstrate an en-
hancement of conditionability in phobia, when this enhancement
is present (e.g., Vriends et al. 2012), it is suggested here that it may
be caused by metaplasticity in the amygdala. Metaplasticity is
deﬁned as a dynamic regulation of synaptic plasticity thresholds
in a neuronal population, resulting, for example, in exaggerated
or inhibited LTP (Garcia et al. 1997). Metaplasticity tunes the
synapses to undergo changes that are necessary prerequisites for
memory storage under physiological (Garcia 2001) or pathological
(Garcia 2002a,b) conditions. Stress is known as a condition that
provokes metaplasticity in several brain regions (e.g.,
in the
hippocampus: Garcia et al. 1997; in the amygdala: Rodríguez
Manzanares et al. 2005). In the amygdala, metaplasticity associated
with stress results from an elevation in glucocorticoid levels (Karst
et al. 2010), which, in turn, increases the norepinephrine release in
the amygdala (McReynolds et al. 2010). Of note, norepinephrine is
released in the basolateral amygdala from ﬁbers from two struc-
tures that are activated by the stress condition: the nucleus of the
solitary track and locus coeruleus (de Quervain et al. 2009). In
turn, norepinephrine causes a reduction in GABA neurotrans-
mission (Tully et al. 2007). The amygdala, particularly its basolat-
eral complex,
is characterized by a high density of GABAA/
benzodiazepine receptor binding sites. GABAA receptors operate
as gated chloride ion channels, causing inﬂux of negatively
charged chloride ions into the neuron, leading to reduce the
chance of a successful action potential occurring. In other words,
increases of glucocorticoid levels reduce GABAergic inhibition,
via norepinephrine action (Liu et al. 2014). Consequently, stress,
by altering GABAergic inhibition in amygdala, induces a reduction
of the synaptic plasticity threshold that results in exaggerated
amygdala LTP (Rodríguez Manzanares et al. 2005). This is also con-
ﬁrmed by studies showing that treatment with the benzodiaze-
pines, which are among the most widely prescribed anxiolytic
drugs, enhances GABAergic neurotransmission (Giachero et al.
2015) and suppresses the effect of stress on amygdala synaptic plas-
ticity (Rodríguez Manzanares et al. 2005). The interactions be-
tween glucocorticoids and noradrenaline are summarized in
Figure 1. Particularly, in the amygdala, glucocorticoids induce meta-
plasticity, which facilitates fear acquisition (Buchanan and Lovallo
2001; Rodríguez Manzanares et al. 2005) and may explain the en-
hancement of conditionability found in some phobic patients
(Table 2).

As seen above, the other phenomenon that characterizes
phobia is poor fear extinction learning (Hermann et al. 2002). It
has been hypothesized that poor extinction contributes to the
maintenance of anxiety disorders (Mineka and Zinbarg 1996).
Phobias are chronic disorders with a high rate of resistance to phar-
macotherapy (Slaap et al. 1996; Van Ameringen et al. 2004; Stein
et al. 2005) and psychotherapy (Van Ameringen et al. 2004), in-
cluding exposure therapy (Lass-Hennemann and Michael 2014).
Exposure therapy is thought to rely on the extinction of the fear
memory. Even though this extinction-based therapy is a highly
treatment option, not all patients proﬁt

interpreted as a suppression of LTP-like
changes or depotentiation. Extinction
neurons exhibit, on the contrary, a pro-
gressive increase of their activity during
extinction; this being interpreted here as
a progressive development of LTP-like
changes.

Regarding

extinction

training-
associated depotentiation, it has already
been shown that conditioning-induced
LTP-like changes in the thalamo–amyg-
dala pathway are reversed with extinction
(Kim et al. 2007). At the basolateral amyg-
dala, conditioning-associated reduction
of GABA levels is also reversed with ex-
tinction (Stork et al. 2002). Fear extinc-
tion may require this change (increased
GABA levels) to initiate depotentiation
mechanisms, among which activation
of NMDARs,
increased calcium entry
in postsynaptic cells and calcineurin
Aα activation (Zhuo et al. 1999), leading
to internalization of AMPARs (Kim et al.
2007). Therefore, another way to improve
in addition to
extinction, or exposure therapy in phobics,
GABAergic interventions,
the use of NMDAR agonists.
D-cycloserine, a partial agonist of the glycine site, is one example
of NMDAR agonists that has been often tested in studies on fear ex-
tinction in rodents (e.g., Ledgerwood et al. 2003; Lehner et al.
2010) and in humans (e.g., Ressler et al. 2004; Smits et al. 2013)
studies. For example, in human studies, D-cycloserine has been re-
ported to facilitate exposure therapy in height-phobic subjects,
when compared with the placebo condition (Ressler et al. 2004;
Smits et al. 2013).

is

Regarding extinction training-association LTP-like changes, it
has also been shown that extinction is associated with a potentia-
tion of extinction neurons projecting to GABAergic intercalated
amygdala neurons that project, in turn, to the central amygdala
(Amano et al. 2010). Of note, the so-called extinction neurons in
the basolateral amygdala correspond to pyramidal neurons that
are powerfully inhibited by cholecystokinin-containing interneu-
rons (Marsicano et al. 2002). Extinction can take place only if
GABA release by these interneurons is reduced (see legend of Fig.
2). Marsicano et al. (2002) found that low-frequency stimulation
of the cholecystokinin-containing interneurons leads to a long-
term reduction in the release of GABA, which, in turn, leads to
less inhibition of the extinction neurons. Interestingly, the authors
reported that this long-term depression of GABAergic transmission
was completely blocked by the cannabinoid type 1 receptor
agonist. In addition, this synaptic plasticity was observed in canna-
binoid type 1 receptor-deﬁcient mice (Marsicano et al. 2002). One
can suggest that during extinction training, serotonin may induce
strong release of endocannabinoids that may generate long-term
depression of GABAergic release by cholecystokinin-containing
interneurons. This may thereby help development of LTP-like of
synapses between extinction neurons and their GABAergic target
cells (Fig. 2).

Collectively, these data support the view that serotonergic
dysfunction, which characterized phobic patients, may indirectly
contribute, via the lack of activation of endocannabinoid system
in the basolateral amygdala, in poor extinction that is reported
in phobia.

Figure 1.
Interactions between glucocorticoids and norepinephrine (NA) in the regulation of
GABAergic activity. During stress, adrenal hormones, epinephrine, and glucocorticoids, are released.
Epinephrine, which does not cross the blood–brain barrier, induces the release of NA in the basolateral
amygdala (BLA) by activating vagal afferents to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). NA neurons in the
NTS send direct noradrenergic ﬁbers to the BLA. NA neurons from the NTS project also to the locus coe-
ruleus (LC), which noradrenergic ﬁbers reach directly the BLA. Glucocorticoids freely cross the blood–
brain barrier and potentiate NA release in the BLA and facilitate the NA inhibitory effect on GABA inter-
neurons in the BLA (de Quervain et al. 2009). This results in the decrease of excitability threshold of the
pyramidal neurons in the BLA, which release the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate (Glu), in the
central amygdala (CeA).

(Lass-Hennemann and Michael 2014), showing therefore poor ex-
tinction mechanisms. Here, it is suggested that poor extinction
mechanisms may include dysfunction in the serotonergic system
for at least two main reasons. First, as previously mentioned,
SSRI, by increasing concentrations of 5-HT in the synapse cleft,
have been found effective for phobias (Cassano et al. 2002).
Moreover, as demonstrated with knockout mice, the ionotropic
5-HT receptor, which is expressed in limbic regions including the
amygdala, is not required for the acquisition or retention of fear
memory, but is essential for the extinction of conditioned fear
(Kondo et al. 2014). Other studies have shown that chronic treat-
ment with ﬂuoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fa-
cilitates fear extinction (Karpova et al. 2011; Popova et al. 2014;
Gunduz-Cinar et al. 2016). Second, the serotonin system interacts
within the amygdala with the GABAergic and endocannabinoid
systems. Indeed, activation of the serotonergic system has been re-
ported to stimulate the release of GABA in this structure (Koyama
et al. 2002). Similarly, activation of the serotonergic system has
been found to produce a signiﬁcant and selective increase in levels
of anandamide, an endogenous ligand of cannabinoid receptors,
in the basolateral amygdala (Gunduz-Cinar et al. 2016). As for
the serotonin system, blockade of each system (GABAergic or endo-
cannabinoid) is known to impair fear extinction, whereas their
activation facilitates fear extinction. For example, in an animal
study,
it has been reported that infusion of a low dose of
GABAergic agonist muscimol into the basolateral amygdala com-
plex, prior to fear extinction training, facilitates extinction learn-
ing (Akirav et al. 2006). Regarding the endocannabinoid system,
poor fear extinction has also been reported in knockout mice
with reduced anandamide levels in the amygdala (Marsicano
et al. 2002; Jenniches et al. 2016). In other words, extinction
may require activation of the serotonin system that may induce,
in the basolateral amygdala, increased endocannabinoid levels
and increased GABAergic activity (Fig. 2).

Using single-unit recording in mice, Herry et al. (2008) dem-
onstrated that neurons in the basolateral amygdala can be divided
into distinct functional classes: fear neurons and extinction neu-
rons. Fear neurons display a selective enhancement of activity in

Fear and phobias

go on to develop phobias (Aitken et al. 1981), why? This may result
from exaggerated fear conditionability, due to amygdala metaplas-
tic changes (i.e., exaggerated LTP-like changes) in vulnerable
individuals. However, not all phobic patients show exaggerated
fear conditionability in laboratory experiences (Hermann et al.
2002). Poor extinction, due to impairment in mechanisms of
depotentiation in the amygdala of vulnerable individuals, is also
hypothesized as a potential factor maintaining pathological pho-
bia. In experiments done by Öhman (1986), it was observed that
people conditioned to angry faces showed signiﬁcant resistance
to extinction compared with those exposed to happy and neutral
faces. So, nonphobic individuals can also present resistance to
extinction.

As mentioned in the introduction, the development of expe-
riential phobia seems to involve two stages. During the ﬁrst stage, a
pairing of a neutral stimulus and an aversive event results in a con-
ditioned fear response to the neutral stimulus, which becomes a
conditioned stimulus. During the second stage, the person learns
that fear responses to the conditioned stimulus can be reduced
by avoiding this stimulus. However, as shown in rats, strong avoid-
ance causes resistance to extinction of classical fear conditioning
(Nachon et al. 2014). Mechanisms that are involved need also to
be examined in future studies. It would also be good to consider,
in this context, other pathologies that contribute to pathological
fear, such as relapse of fear after extinction (e.g., renewal, recovery,
and reinstatement).

Despite these critical remarks, poor habituation and poor ex-

tinction, support, at least in part, fear dysfunction in phobia.

Interactions between serotonin (5-HT) and GABAergic systems
in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during fear expression and extinction.
Following fear conditioning, presentation of the conditioned cue activates
glutamatergic (Glu) neurons in the lateral amygdala (LA) that project to
fear neurons (F) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). The fear neurons
activate, in turn, neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) for fear expression.
The LA neurons also activate a BLA cell population that expresses cholecys-
tokinin (CCK) and establishes GABAergic synapses with extinction neurons
(E) within the BLA, inhibiting therefore these extinction neurons. Conse-
quently, extinction neurons cannot inhibit fear expression through their
Glu projections to BLA interneurons containing parvalbumin (PV), which es-
tablish a GABAergic connection with the fear neurons, or through their Glu
projections to intercalated cells (ITC), which send GABAergic ﬁbers to the
CeA. It is well known that endocannabinoid signaling results in retrograde
inhibition of afferent neurotransmission. Interestingly, the cannabinoid
type 1 receptors are located presynaptically on CCK-containing cells.
However, endocannabinoid synthesis is initiated via voltage-dependent
mechanisms (Kano et al. 2009) and because of the inhibitory effect of
CCK-containing cells on extinction neurons, endocannabinoids are not re-
leased. Here, it is hypothesized that, during extinction training, repeated
presentations of the conditioned stimulus alone, indicating safety, may
induce progressive enhancement of serotonin (5-HT) release in the BLA,
which may partially activate the extinction neurons, hence provoking the
release of endocannabinoids. The activation of the extinction neurons
may be achieved with the inhibitory effect of endocannabinoids on CCK-
containing cells via their cannabinoid type 1 receptors, resulting in inhibi-
tion of fear expression.

Concluding remarks

While fear is an adaptive component of response to potentially
threatening stimuli, too much or inappropriate fear accounts
for chronic psychiatric disorders, including PTSD and phobias.
Understanding the neurobiological basis of fear is therefore critical
at elucidating the mechanisms improving treatments of these fear-
related pathologies. Concerning phobias, nonexperiential, engag-
ing innate fear, and experiential, engaging conditioned fear, disor-
ders can be distinguished. However, so far, we know a lot about
how the brain processes fear that is conditioned, while much less
is known about innate fear. An increase of research on innate
fear is therefore necessary.

Based on the research reviewed in this article, it appears that
the amygdala is central to two phenomena that may support path-
ological innate fear: fear sensitization (with decreased amygdala
threshold activity and potentiation of amygdala activity) and fail-
ure of fear habituation (with decreased amygdala habituation).
Mechanisms of fear sensitization may contribute to decreased
amygdala habituation. As current research is limited, this hypoth-
esis is not fully supported here.

The cause of experiential phobia is attributed to some external
learning experience. However, although phobia-like fears can be
produced in laboratory with fear conditioning paradigms, experi-
mental ﬁndings do not prove that in everyday life, classical
fear conditioning is the cause of phobias (Merckelbach et al.
1996). For example, not all people who have had fearful events
