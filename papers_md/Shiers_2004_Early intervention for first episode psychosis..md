Assessment of acute exposures is often straightforward,
but in the chronic setting assessment is often far from
easy, although recent developments in assessment of
life-long exposure will prove a major advance in
improving the estimation of exposure and consequently
of dose.5 At the other end of the “exposure, effect,
control” paradigm, health impact assessment is the
linchpin around which establishment of
control
measures should occur.6 Yet, although this is to some
extent addressed by the Environment Agency, no men-
tion of Health Impact Assessment is made in either the
Health Protection Agency’s document or that on
sustainable development. Knowledge of all
factors
contributing to the links between exposures, their effects,
and their control does demand coherent collaboration
between a range of agencies and skills,2 stretching much
wider
than clinicians, public health doctors, and
toxicologists. For instance, advances made in the under-
standing of
the effects of air pollution have been
dependent on collaboration between meteorologists,
statistical modellers, exposure assessors, physiologists,
epidemiologists, clinicians, laboratory scientists, atmos-
pheric chemists, and material physicists in addition to
direct input from the public. This multiskilled, cross-
disciplinary approach largely emanates from the field of
occupational medicine and health.

It now needs

to think outside the
conventional, public health driven box. Its plan rightly
the need to train a workforce with the
talks of
appropriate skills, which need to be broad and
embrace other areas of environmental science (for
example, hydrology, plant and soil science, and atmos-
pheric chemistry). There is a need to develop
integrated ways to train, help establish career paths,
and define and undertake the research agenda,
embracing the multidisciplinary approach alluded to
above. This could be paralleled at a managerial level by

considering the merger of COMEAP and EPAQS as an
integrated committee dealing with air quality and
health issues, and doing so within the Health
Protection Agency rather than linked to a specific gov-
ernment department. A similar approach could be
taken for the available expertise in the effects of water
borne exposures but both these moves would need to
consider how best the Health Protection Agency can
work with the Environment Agency in this regard.

The thinking which went into these documents
should now be joined up and a fresh review across a
wider stage be established to ensure a truly integrated
plan for delivery of public health protection.

Early intervention for first episode psychosis
Needs greater involvement of primary care professionals for its success

Early intervention in psychosis is a relatively new

concept in mental health. It describes the policy
of the health service and its response to increas-
ing evidence of unacceptably long delays in accessing
specialist services and the benefits of earlier detection
and treatment for young people who experience their
first episode of psychosis (when someone displays typi-
cal symptoms, such as distorted contacts with reality,
delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorder, and no
organic disorder can be found to explain those symp-
toms). It is also a concept that requires primary and
secondary care and wider involvement of the commu-
nity to make a difference to the outcome.

Like most mental disorders, functional psychoses
such as schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder
usually appear when people are young (80% of first
episodes of psychoses occur between 16 and 30 years
of age), at a critical time in their intellectual and social
development and emerging personal autonomy.

Worldwide, the burden of psychosis is exceeded only
by quadriplegia and dementia.1 The all
cause
standardised mortality ratio for schizophrenia is 298,
with an unnatural cause standardised mortality ratio
(that includes suicide) of 1273, 12 times higher than
expected.2

Studies consistently show intervals of one to two
years between the onset of psychotic symptoms and
the start of treatment.3 Although still disputed, the
duration of untreated psychosis is also likely to relate to
outcomes
in first episode psychosis, particularly
functional and symptomatic outcomes at 12 months
and reduction of symptoms once treatment begins.4 5
Long term follow up studies show that outcomes at two
later.6
years
strongly predict outcomes 15 years
Birchwood argues that these observations support the
concept that the early phase of psychosis constitutes a
critical period for treating this illness, with major
implications for secondary prevention of impairments

and disabilities, and provide a further rationale for
intervening intensively and early.7

Early intervention for psychosis has now become a
political priority in the United Kingdom and early
intervention services are being developed across
England. The NHS Plan says that 50 early intervention
teams will be established by 2004, so that all young
people (between 14 and 35 years) who experience a
first episode of psychosis such as schizophrenia receive
the early and intensive support they need.8 However,
new services in isolation may be insufficient to make a
difference to the healthcare experience of young peo-
ple with first episode psychosis and their families. To be
maximally effective, early detection in primary care
and facilitation of help seeking in the wider community
must also be addressed.

Most general practitioners see one or two new peo-
ple with a first episode of psychosis each year. Recent
national guidance on schizophrenia and the mental
health indicators in the new general practitioner
contract may affect the roles and responsibilities of pri-
mary care by encouraging a more systematic approach
to care, including the use of protocols and referral
guidelines.9 Nevertheless some general practitioners
believe that they contribute little to the care of people
with serious mental illness and that the incidence of
first episode psychosis is too low to warrant more
active involvement.10 However, we know that general
practitioners are often consulted at some point on the
illness pathway on matters connected with a develop-
ing psychosis11 and are the most common final referral
agent. Involvement of general practitioners is also
associated with reduced use of the Mental Health Act.12
Primary care therefore has a potentially pivotal role in
reducing duration of untreated psychosis and influenc-
ing the course and outcome of first episode psychosis.
Early detection is a diagnostic challenge for general
practitioners when psychosis can take several months
to emerge from a prodrome of non-specific psycho-
logical and social disturbances of varying intensity that
can be difficult to distinguish from normal adolescent
behaviour. An active watching brief
typifies an
approach that might regard non-attendance as a signal
of deterioration rather than of resolution of symptoms.
Such an approach would also involve actively seeking
positive and negative psychotic symptoms and suicidal
ideation. Parental fears and intuition would be particu-
larly heeded and sensitivity given to the impact of an
emerging psychosis on the family. General practition-
ers would have a high index of suspicion and a low
threshold for urgently referring a young person with a
possible first episode psychosis for specialist mental
health assessment.9

Detection and referral are crucial but need to be
underpinned by community based initiatives that pro-
mote and encourage help seeking. Such an approach
makes sense for all mental illness, not just psychosis
where the stakes are arguably the highest. Primary care
trusts have a role in promoting mental health within the

communities they represent and helping to reduce the
stigma of mental illness. Early results from the “Treat-
ment and Intervention Psychosis” project in Norway
show that a programme of extensive public education
and specific education for teachers, youth workers, and
general practitioners about first episode psychosis can
reduce the duration of untreated psychosis.

The real challenge for primary care therefore goes
beyond improving the competence and knowledge of
individual general practitioners or raising awareness of
the new early intervention services. The concept of early
intervention puts the onus on primary care and other
community services to make themselves accessible, non-
stigmatising, and relevant to young people, whether
dealing with a mild and self limiting depression or a
major psychosis. Young people with emerging psycho-
ses and their families also need to feel confident that pri-
mary care services will integrate with the new early
intervention services to ensure they receive the highly
specialised interventions they require both at the onset
of the illness and in the longer term in a timely fashion.
If we achieve that then early intervention really will have
become everybody’s business.
