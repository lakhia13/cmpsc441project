Background
It is known that levels of mental health difficulties in chil-
dren  and  adolescents  are  increasing  [12].  There  is  some 
evidence  showing  corresponding  increases  in  levels  of 
mental  health  difficulties  for  young  people  accessing 
child and adolescent mental health services [3, 4]. In gen-
eral populations, young women in particular are experi-
encing increased levels of mental health difficulties [12]. 
There is a need for evidence about the characteristics that

predict of treatment outcome (i.e., mental health difficul-
ties  at  follow  up)  for  young  people  accessing  child  and 
adolescent  mental  health  services  and,  correspondingly, 
characteristics that account for variation in levels of men-
tal health difficulties at baseline.

There has been increased attention on treatment out-
come  for  young  people  accessing  child  and  adolescent 
mental  health  services  and  what  types  of  outcomes 
are  most  important  [1,  10,  11].  Change  in  symptoms, 
functioning,  and  goals  according  to  self-  or  parent/ 
carer-reported  measures  is  the  predominant  metric  of 
treatment  outcome  in  child  mental  health.  However, 
there is a need to go beyond describing treatment out-
come  to  understand  which  factors  are  associated  with

different  treatment  outcomes.  Levels  of  service  use 
may  be  one  such  factor  and,  for  example,  young  peo-
ple  with  psychosis,  substance  use,  or  eating  disorder 
have been shown to be particularly more likely to have 
higher  levels  of  service  use  compared  to  young  people 
with  less  severe  difficulties  (Edbrooke-Childs  J,  Rashid 
A, Ritchie B, Deighton J. Predictors of amoutns of child 
and  adolescent  mental  health  service  use  in  admiis-
trative  data,  submitted).  In  addition,  young  people 
referred through certain pathways, such as social care/ 
youth justice, were more likely to have higher levels of 
service  use.  Moreover,  evidence  suggests  that  a  range 
of intervention, clinician, service user, service delivery, 
organizational,  and  service  system  characteristics  may 
be  associated  with  treatment  outcome  [17].  In  terms 
of  service  user  characteristics,  these  may  include  cli-
nician,  demographic,  and  family  characteristics  [15]. 
Nevertheless,  previous  evidence  has  been  inconsistent 
in  the  extent  to  which  these  factors  were  associated 
with  treatment  outcome  for  young  people  accessing 
child and adolescent mental health services.

One  of  the  most  consistent  factors  is  levels  of  men-
tal  health  difficulties  at  baseline.  Generally,  studies 
show  that  higher  levels  of  difficulties  at  baseline  are 
associated with higher levels of difficulties at follow up 
[14].  Therefore,  to  provide  a  complete  understanding 
of  predictors  of  child  and  adolescent  treatment  out-
come,  it  is  important  to  first  examine  characteristics 
that  account  for  variation  in  levels  of  mental  health 
difficulties  at  baseline.  Notwithstanding,  some  studies 
have shown that higher levels of difficulties at baseline 
are  associated  with  increased  likelihood  of  improve-
ment  [13].  Other  characteristics  that  have,  somewhat 
less  consistently,  been  shown  to  be  associated  with 
treatment  outcome  include  diagnosis  (e.g.,  psycho-
sis,  conduct  disorder,  hyperactivity,  autism),  levels  of 
functional  impairment,  and  an  older  age  when  access-
ing  services  [3,  4,  13–15].  It  is  known  that  structural 
inequalities  mean  that  young  people  from  minoritized 
ethnic groups are more likely to be referred to services 
through  routes  that  are  less  likely  to  be  voluntary,  and 
it is therefore important to examine if there are similar 
differences in treatment outcome [5].

Aims of this study

There  were  two  aims  of  the  present  study.  The  first  aim 
was to examine characteristics in routine data from men-
tal  health  services  that  account  for  variation  in  levels  of 
baseline  difficulties  for  children  and  adolescents.  The 
second aim was to then examine predictors of treatment 
outcome  for  children  and  adolescents  accessing  mental 
health  services.  To  address  these  aims,  we  conducted  a 

secondary analysis of a large administrative dataset from 
child and adolescent mental health services in England.

Method
Data preparation and procedure

Data  were  derived  from  routinely  collected  data 
extracted  from  the  ‘community  activity  data  package’ 
of  the  Mental  Health  Services  Data  Set  by  NHS  Digi-
tal  (years  2016–17  and  2017–18).  From  this  extract, 
episodes of care were constructed, referring to periods 
of  service  use  consisting  of  at  least  two  care  contacts 
and less than 180 days between care contacts (excluding 
text message, email, or unattended), using an approach 
adapted  from  a  previous  study  [16].  To  address  the 
first  research  question,  episodes  of  care  were  included 
in  the  present  analysis  if  the  age  at  episode  start  was 
8–25 years,  the  age  range  that  the  included  measures 
can  be  self-reported.  Additionally,  episodes  of  care 
were included if the case was closed, there was at least 
50  episodes  per  service,  and  there  was  complete  data 
on mental health difficulties at baseline (see Measures).
This  resulted  in  a  first  dataset  of  N = 5907  episodes 
from  14  services  with  65–1667  episodes  per  service 
(Mage = 13.76 years,  SDage = 2.45, 
range = 8–25 years; 
3540  or  59.93% 
services = 870, 
 mediannumber  of  services  =  769;  SDnumber  of  services = 554; 
 skewnumber  of  services = 0.37);  please  see  Table  1  for 
descriptive  statistics  on  all  study  variables.  To  address 
the  second  research  question,  episodes  of  care  were 
additionally  filtered  based  on  complete  data  on  men-
tal  health  difficulties  at  follow  up.  This  resulted  in  a 
second  dataset  of  N = 1805  episodes  from  10  services 
with  53–485  episodes  per  service  (Mage = 13.59 years, 
SDage = 2.33, range = 8–24 years; 1120 or 62.05% female; 
Mnumber  of  services = 483,   mediannumber  of  services  =  443; 
SDnumber  of 
 skewnumber  of  services = 0.88). 
The  study  was  approved  by  the  University  College 
London  Research  Ethics  Committee 
(12,689/001) 
and  the  NHS  Digital  Data  Access  Request  Service 
(DARS-NIC-140981-R5N6Z).

Measures
Deprivation

Deprivation  was  reported  using  quintiles  of  the  Income 
Deprivation  Affecting  Children  Index  (IDACI)  based 
on  young  people’s  local  area  of  residence  (Lower  Layer 
Super Output Area).

Demographic characteristics

Age,  gender,  and  ethnicity  were  recorded  by  services  as 
part  of  routine  data  recording.  Ethnicity  was  captured

using the categories from the 2001 Census. For the main 
analyses,  to  avoid  including  underpowered  groups,  eth-
nicity  was  grouped  as  follows:  Any  other  White  back-
ground, any other ethnic group, Asian, Black, mixed-race, 
not reported, and White British.

Referral source

Referral source was recorded by services using 44 catego-
ries  that  were  grouped  into  nine  study  variables  for  the

emergency  department,  mental  health,  other,  and  not 
reported.

Presenting difficulties

Two  sources  were  used  to  identify  the  presence  or 
absence of 30 non-mutually exclusive presenting difficul-
ties.  First,  the  30-item  clinician-reported  Current  View 
questionnaire [8] on presenting problems were used. Sec-
ond, clinician-reported ICD-10 free-text diagnoses were 
used, which were first mapped on to the 30 Current View 
presenting problems, thus creating one set of harmonised 
30 presenting difficulties.

Mental health difficulties

Baseline  and  follow  up  mental  health  difficulties  were 
assessed  using  five  subscales  using  four  self-reported 
measures  summarized  below.  To  ensure  conceptual 
and  operationalisation  consistency  across  measures,  we 
focussed  only  on  those  assessing  depression  and  anxi-
ety.  To  accommodate  the  completion  of  different  meas-
ures, measures were transformed into z-scores, and when 
multiple  measures  were  completed,  the  mean  z-score  of 
these  measures  was  computed.  Baseline  measures  were 
completed  at  the  initial  stages  of  treatment  and  follow 
up measures were completed 4-6 months later or at case 
closure.

1.  Emotional  difficulties  subscale  of  the  Strengths  and 

Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) [6].

2.  Depression  and  generalized  anxiety  subscales  of  the 
Revised  Children’s  Anxiety  and  Depression  Scale 
(RCADS) [2].

3.  Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) [19], which is 
a 7-item questionnaire assessing symptoms of gener-
alised anxiety.

4.  Patient  Health  Questionnaire  (PHQ-9)  [18],  which 
is  a  9-item  questionnaire  assessing  symptoms  of 
depression.

Analytic strategy

To investigate characteristics that account for variation in 
levels  of  baseline  difficulties  (research  question  1),  two-
level multilevel regressions were performed, with child as 
the level 1 group and service the level 2 group, in STATA 
16 [20]. A null model without explanatory variables was 
computed  with  mental  health  difficulties  at  baseline  as 
the criterion variable, and the intraclass correlation coef-
ficient  (ICC)  was  calculated.  The  ICC  was  32.33%  (95% 
Confidence  Interval  or  CI = 15.96–48.71%)  indicating 
that  there  was  significant  service-level  variation  and 

investigate  predictors  of 

confirming  that  multilevel  regression  was  the  correct 
analytical  approach.  To  examine  the  associations  with 
individual-level  characteristics,  two  models  were  tested. 
In  Model  1,  demographic  characteristics  were  entered 
as  level-1  explanatory  variables:  economic  disadvantage 
(with  the  least  deprived  quintile  coded  as  the  reference 
category  to  facilitate  interpretation),  grand-mean  cen-
tred  age,  female  gender,  and  ethnicity  (with  White  Brit-
ish as the reference category as it was the largest group). 
In Model 2, clinical characteristics were added as level-1 
explanatory variables: referral source (with primary care 
as the reference category as it was the largest group) and 
the  26  presenting  difficulty  variables  (to  avoid  including 
underpowered variables, four variables were not included 
as they had a frequency of < 5%: selective mutism, toilet 
problems, developmental difficulties, and gender identity 
difficulties).  The  likelihood  ratio  test  was  used  to  com-
pare successive models, and both were significantly bet-
ter fits to the preceding model; Model 1: χ2(12) = 641.136, 
p < 0.001 and Model 2: χ2(35) = 860.38, p < 0.001.
To 

treatment  outcome 
(research  question  2),  two-level  multilevel  regressions 
were performed, with child as the level 1 group and ser-
vice  the  level  2,  with  mental  health  difficulties  at  follow 
up  as  the  criterion  variable.  In  the  null  model,  the  ICC 
was 25.80% (CI = 8.70–42.90%). To determine treatment 
outcome,  or  mental  health  difficulties  at  follow  up  con-
trolling  for  mental  health  difficulties  at  baseline,  men-
tal  health  difficulties  at  baseline  was  added  as  a  level-1 
explanatory variable in Model 1. The z-scores for mental 
health  difficulties  as  baseline,  and  mean  z-score,  were 
computed  again  as  this  was  a  sub-sample  of  the  overall 
sample.  In  Model  2,  demographic  characteristics  were 
entered  as  level-1  explanatory  variables:  economic  dis-
advantage,  grand-mean  centred  age,  female  gender, 
and  ethnicity.  In  Model  3,  clinical  characteristics  were 
entered  as  level-1  explanatory  variables:  referral  source, 
the  26  presenting  difficulty  variables,  and  grand  mean 
centred  number  of  care  contacts.  The  likelihood  ratio 
test was used to compare successive models, and all were 
significantly better fits to the preceding model; Model 1: 
χ2(1) = 641.13994.16,  p < 0.001,  Model  2:  χ2(12) = 22.11, 
p =  0.0364,  and  Model  3:  χ2(35) = 82.94,  p < 0.001.  It 
should  be  noted  that  using  standardized  criterion  vari-
ables for both sets of analyses resulted in small coefficient 
estimates.

Results
Research question 1: what accounts for variation 
in baseline mental health difficulties?

the  most  (β = 0.10,  95%  CI = 0.04–0.16)  economically 
disadvantaged areas had higher levels of mental health 
difficulties  at  baseline.  Compared  to  boys,  girls  had 
higher  levels  of  mental  health  difficulties  at  baseline 
(β = 0.28,  95%  CI = 0.24–0.32).  Compared  to  younger 
children  and  adolescents,  older  children  and  adoles-
cents  had  slightly  higher  levels  of  mental  health  dif-
ficulties  at  baseline  (β = 0.02,  95%  CI = 0.01–0.03).  In 
terms  of  ethnicity,  compared  to  White  British  young 
people,  young  people  from  mixed-race  ethnic  back-
grounds  had  lower  levels  of  mental  health  difficul-
ties  at  baseline  (β = − 0.15,  95%  CI = –  0.26-–0.05). 
In terms of referral source, compared to young people 
referred  through  primary  care,  young  people  referred 
through  social  care/  youth  justice  (β = − 0.30,  95% 
CI = − 0.41-–0.20), mental health services (β = − 0.14, 
95% CI = − 0.23-–0.05), or not known referral sources 
(β = −  0.09,  95%  CI = − 0.17-0.00)  had  lower  levels  of 
mental  health  difficulties  at  baseline,  although  the  CI 
for  not  known  referral  included  0  and  therefore  this 
finding  should  particularly  be  interpreted  with  cau-
tion.  In  terms  of  presenting  difficulties,  young  people 
with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, 
agoraphobia, low mood, self-harm, or features of post-
traumatic  stress  disorder,  had  higher  levels  of  mental 
health difficulties at baseline than young people with-
out these presenting difficulties (please see Table 2 for 
coefficients and CIs for presenting difficulties). In con-
trast, young people with specific phobia, conduct dis-
order, or risk management difficulties had lower levels 
of  mental  health  difficulties  at  baseline  than  young 
people without these presenting difficulties.

Research question 2: what are the predictors of treatment 
outcome?

Young  people  with  higher  levels  of  mental  health  diffi-
culties at baseline also had higher levels of deterioration 
in  mental  health  difficulties  at  follow  up  (β = 0.72,  95% 
CI = 0.67–0.76).  After  controlling  for  levels  of  mental 
health  difficulties  at  baseline,  compared  to  boys,  girls 
had  higher  levels  of  deterioration  in  mental  health  dif-
ficulties  at  follow  up  (β = 0.09,  95%  CI = 0.03–0.16). 
In  terms  of  referral  source,  compared  to  young  people 
referred  through  primary  care,  young  people  referred 
through  social  care/  youth  justice  (β = − 0.20,  95% 
CI = − 0.37-–0.03)  had  higher  levels  of  improvement 
in mental health difficulties at follow up. Young people 
with social anxiety, panic disorder, low mood, self-harm, 
or  family  relationship  difficulties  had  higher  levels  of 
deterioration  in  mental  health  difficulties  at  follow  up 

than  young  people  without  these  presenting  problems 
(please see Table 3 for coefficients and CIs for present-
ing  difficulties).  Finally,  young  people  with  a  greater 
number  of  care  contacts  had  slightly  higher  levels  of 
deterioration  in  mental  health  difficulties  at  follow  up 
compared to young people with a lesser number of care 
contacts  (β = 0.00195,  95%  CI = 0.0.00074–0.00316). 
It  should  be  noted  that  the  coefficient  was  very  small, 
meaning this finding should be particularly interpreted 
with caution.

Discussion
The aims of the present study were to examine character-
istics that account for variation in levels of mental health 
difficulties  at  baseline  and  then  predictors  of  treatment 
outcome.  We  conducted  a  secondary  analysis  of  a  large 
administrative dataset from child and adolescent mental 
health services in England.

Young people with higher levels of mental health dif-
ficulties  at  baseline  also  had  higher  levels  of  mental 
health  difficulties  at  follow  up.  In  terms  of  key  charac-
teristics  that  both  accounted  for  variation  in  levels  of 
mental  health  difficulties  at  baseline  and  were  predic-
tors  of  treatment  outcome,  girls  had  higher  levels  of 
mental  health  difficulties  at  baseline  and  of  deteriora-
tion in mental health difficulties at follow up than boys. 
Compared  to  young  people  referred  through  primary 
care,  young  people  referred  through  social  care/  youth 
justice  had  lower  levels  of  mental  health  difficulties  at 
baseline and had higher levels of improvement in men-
tal  health  difficulties  at  follow  up.  In  terms  of  present-
ing  problems,  young  people  with  social  anxiety,  panic 
disorder,  low  mood,  or  self-harm  had  higher  levels  of 
mental  health  difficulties  at  baseline,  and  higher  levels 
of  deterioration  in  mental  health  difficulties  at  follow 
up, compared to young people without these presenting 
problems.  Although  we  found  no  evidence  of  associa-
tion with levels of mental health difficulties at follow up, 
we  did  find  that  children  and  young  people  from  areas 
with  high,  and  the  highest,  levels  of  economic  disad-
vantage  had  higher  levels  of  mental  health  difficulties 
at  baseline  than  children  and  young  people  from  areas 
with the lowest levels of economic disadvantage. These 
findings  may  suggest  that  there  is  a  need  for  children 
and  young  people  from  areas  of  higher  levels  of  eco-
nomic  disadvantage  to  have  earlier  receipt  of  specialist 
mental  health  services.  Currently,  children  and  young 
people from such areas are receiving support when their 
difficulties have escalated to a higher level than children 
and  young  people  from  areas  of  lower  levels  of  eco-
nomic disadvantage.

The findings of the present research are consistent with 
previous  research  showing  that  higher  levels  of  mental 
health  difficulties  at  baseline  are  associated  with  higher 
levels of difficulties at follow up [14]. These findings also 
build on the troubling pattern in the literature that young 
women in particular are experiencing increased levels of 
mental health difficulties [12]. We found that social anxi-
ety, panic disorder, low mood, and self-harm were asso-
ciated  with  higher  levels  of  mental  health  difficulties  at 
baseline and at follow up. This is consistent with previous 
studies on common characteristics associated with lower 
treatment outcome and those that indicate high levels of 
clinical complexity [7, 13–15].

There is ongoing debate about how treatment outcome 
should  be  conceptualized  and  assessed  [10,  11].  It  is 
especially important to review how treatment outcomes 
are  framed  and  measured  with  young  people  and  par-
ticularly  with  those  from  minoritized  groups  who  may 
be less likely to be represented in the evidence on which 
current treatment outcome approaches were developed. 
The  findings  of  the  present  research  did  not  show  eth-
nic differences in treatment outcome, however such dif-
ferences  may  have  been  masked  due  to  the  lack  of  data 
on  structural  inequalities  in  administrative  datasets  [9], 
especially  as  evidence  shows  structural  inequalities  in 
relation to accessing child and adolescent mental health 
services  [5].  Future  research  should  work  with  young 
people  from  minoritized  ethnic  groups  and  relevant 
community  organizations  so  that  administrative  data 
can  include  information  on  inequalities  that  are  mean-
ingful to the experiences of individuals from minoritized 
ethnic groups.

Future  research  should  examine  the  lack  of  signifi-
cant  association  between  economic  disadvantage  and 
mental health difficulties at follow up from the present 
research. This may possibly be accounted for by young 
people  with  the  highest  levels  of  economic  disadvan-
tage being more likely to have unmet needs and to be 
not known by child and adolescent mental health ser-
vices, meaning they are not represented in administra-
tive  data.  In  the  present  research,  young  people  from 
areas of higher economic disadvantage had higher lev-
els  of  mental  health  difficulties  at  baseline  compared 
to  young  people  from  areas  of  lower  economic  disad-
vantage, suggesting economic inequalities in receipt of 
specialist  mental  health  support.  Moreover,  the  find-
ings of the present research suggest that young people 
referred  through  social  care/  youth  justice  had  lower 
levels  of  mental  health  difficulties  at  baseline  and  at 
follow up compared to young people referred through 
primary  care.  We  are  not  able  to  explain  why  such 

differences were found in the present research. Future 
qualitative  studies  should  examine  if  the  types  of  out-
comes  measured  in  mental  health  services  capture 
what young people and professionals think are impor-
tant outcomes and reflect the reasons for which young 
people  receive  mental  health  services  through  these 
pathways.

Limitations  of  the  present  research  include  the  rela-
tively small sample sizes, meaning that the findings may 
not  reflect  all  young  people  accessing  child  and  ado-
lescent  mental  health  services.  Although  we  restricted 
the  analysis  to  only  measures  of  depression  and  anxi-
ety  for  conceptual  and  operationalisation  consistency, 
future  research  is  needed  to  examine  the  factor  struc-
ture of the five subscales used to determine the extent to 
which  items  load  onto  the  same  factor.  Similarly,  using 
a  subsample  to  examine  mental  health  difficulties  at 
follow  up  means  the  groups  in  the  baseline  and  follow 
up  analyses  are  not  entirely  comparable.  More  general 
limitations of using administrative data are also relevant 
to the present research [21]. Moreover, the use of com-
plete case analysis to manage missing data, especially on 
mental  health  difficulties  at  follow  up,  may  mean  there 
are  systematic  differences  in  those  with  and  without 
these  data.  Future  research  examining  such  patterns 
and differences is encouraged, working towards consist-
ency in how missing data are handled in administrative 
child mental health records. We assessed presenting dif-
ficulties  using  two  different  types  of  clinician  reports, 
Current  View  questionnaire  [8]  presenting  problems 
and ICD-10 free-text diagnoses mapped on to the Cur-
rent View presenting problems. Inaccuracies in ICD-10 
recording  and  inconsistencies  in  mapping  across  the 
two  sources  are  other  potential  limitations.  Neverthe-
less,  this  approach  resulted  in  a  more  comprehensive 
assessment  of  presenting  difficulties  than  would  have 
been  possible  with  one  source  alone.  Future  research 
should examine different types of care provided, which 
was  not  available  in  the  present  dataset,  to  examine 
whether  predictors  of  treatment  outcome  differ  across 
treatment modalities.

Notwithstanding  the  above  limitations,  the  present 
research  identified  predictors  of  treatment  outcome  in 
a large and recent administrative dataset from child and 
adolescent  mental  health  services  in  England.  Based 
on  the  findings  presented  in  this  paper,  services  seeing 
higher proportions of young people with higher levels of 
mental health difficulties at baseline, social anxiety, panic 
disorder,  low  mood,  or  self-harm  may  be  expected  to 
show  lower  levels  of  improvement  in  mental  health  dif-
ficulties at follow up.
