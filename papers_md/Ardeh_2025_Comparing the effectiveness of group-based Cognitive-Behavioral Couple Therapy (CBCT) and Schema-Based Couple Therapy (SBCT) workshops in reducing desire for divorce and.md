Abstract
Background  Marital relationships, like any other interpersonal bond, encompass both positive and negative 
dimensions. Central to the success of marriage is the level of satisfaction and commitment experienced by the 
partners. This study aims to compare the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral couple therapy and schema-based couple 
therapy in reducing the desire for divorce and marital boredom.

Methods  This experimental study employed a pre-test-post-test design with a control group. The research sample 
comprised couples experiencing marital issues who sought counseling at various counseling centers in 2023. 
Sixty couples were randomly assigned to three groups: two intervention groups and one control group. Data were 
collected using questionnaires assessing desire for divorce (14 questions) and marital boredom (21 questions). The 
intervention consisted of 10 weekly sessions lasting 90 min each, conducted in group format for the two intervention 
groups. Questionnaire data were collected prior to the intervention, one week post-intervention, and one month 
post-intervention. Data analysis involved the use of analysis of variance and repeated measures tests to assess 
changes over time.

Results  The results indicate a significant decrease in the average boredom scores in both the cognitive-behavioral 
and schema therapy groups following the intervention (P < 0.0001). Conversely, no significant change was observed 
in the control group before and after the intervention (P > 0.05). Repeated measures analysis revealed a significant 
difference in the mean boredom scores before the intervention, post-intervention, and one month later in both 
the cognitive-behavioral and schema therapy groups (P < 0.0001). In contrast, the control group exhibited stable 
mean boredom scores across the three assessment points (P > 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant decrease 
in the average scores of the desire for divorce in both the cognitive-behavioral and schema therapy groups post-
intervention (P < 0.0001), while no significant difference was observed in the control group before and after the

intervention (P > 0.05). Similar to the boredom scores, repeated measures analysis demonstrated a significant 
difference in the mean divorce scores across the three assessment points in the intervention groups, whereas scores 
remained stable in the control group (P > 0.05).

Conclusion  The findings of this study suggest that both therapy methods are effective in reducing the desire for 
divorce and marital boredom. These treatment approaches can be valuable tools in family therapy settings aimed at 
enhancing the commitment of couples.

Introduction
The family, a dynamic institution, continuously adapts to 
societal shifts while retaining an inherent stability to nav-
igate through changes [1]. The resilience and cohesion of 
a family unit depend on the robustness of marital bonds; 
any  lack  of  satisfaction  or  relational  success  between 
spouses  can  negatively  impact  their  mental  well-being, 
thus endangering the longevity and solidity of the family 
structure [2].

In recent times, divorce has become a prevalent global 
concern, with the breakdown of family foundations at its 
core.  Sociologists  consider  divorce  a  substantial  social 
problem, interpreting rising divorce rates as indicative of 
moral  decline,  decreased  family  harmony,  interpersonal 
conflicts, and disruptions in societal norms [3]. Through-
out  the  20th  century,  driven  by  population  growth  and 
cultural  changes,  especially  in  industrialized  nations, 
divorce rates have consistently increased [4].

Psychologists  explore  individual-level  factors  contrib-
uting to divorce, while sociologists examine community-
level  dynamics.  Psychological  frameworks  emphasize 
intrapersonal  behaviors,  personality  traits,  childhood 
experiences, and cognitive schemas [5].

Analyzing  data  from  the  national  civil  registry  reveals 
a steady increase in divorce rates in Iran since 2000. The 
figures have risen from 60 thousand divorces in 2000 to 
183,193 in 2020. Reports from the Center for Asian Pop-
ulation Studies and Research support this upward trend 
in  divorce  rates,  particularly  pronounced  in  urban  areas 
compared to rural regions. In 2019, urban areas recorded 
170,688  divorces,  contrasting  with  12,505  in  rural  areas 
[6].

Marital boredom arises as a notable contributor to cou-
ples’ divorce. It is defined by a sense of physical, mental, 
and emotional weariness, occurring when couples come 
to  the  realization  that  their  relationship,  despite  sincere 
efforts, no longer offers the meaning and fulfillment they 
seek in their lives [7].

Couples’  therapy  has  seen  a  proliferation  of  treatment 
modalities  tailored  to  address  communication  conflicts, 
encompassing  cognitive-behavioral  Couples’  therapy, 
systemic  therapy,  acceptance  and  commitment  therapy, 
emotion-focused  Couples’ 
therapy,  solution-focused 
therapy,  schema  couple  therapy,  and  more.  Among 

these,  cognitive-behavioral  couple  therapy  stands  out  as 
a  potent  intervention,  integrating  behavior  modification 
techniques like communication enhancement skills with 
cognitive restructuring. Over the past decade, cognitive-
behavioral couple therapy has emerged as a highly effec-
tive  strategy  in  addressing  communication  issues,  with 
a  focus  on  enhancing  couples’  problem-solving  abilities 
through  cognitive  restructuring  and  improved  commu-
nication  [8,  9].  A  modern  counseling  approach  gaining 
momentum  is  Yang’s  schema  therapy,  esteemed  for  its 
effectiveness  in  uncovering  marital  obstacles.  Grounded 
in the cognitive paradigm, this theory explores the funda-
mental  incompatible  schemas  that  underlie  familial  and 
marital strife [10].

Schema-based  therapy  aims  to  identify  and  address 
marital  challenges  by  helping  couples  recognize,  chal-
lenge, and modify maladaptive schemas through targeted 
techniques.  These  schemas,  rooted  in  early  life,  mold 
individuals’  cognitions,  shaping  how  they  perceive  and 
interpret  reality.  Often,  individuals  unknowingly  align 
their  worldview  with  these  schemas,  which  originate 
from  adverse  childhood  experiences  and  endure  into 
adulthood [8, 9].

Recent  research  underscores  the  efficacy  of  cognitive-
behavioral  therapy  and  schema-based  couple  therapy 
in  enhancing  outcomes  within  couple  therapy.  Conse-
quently, this study seeks to compare the effectiveness of 
cognitive-behavioral  couple  (CBCT)  and  schema-based 
couple  therapy  in  alleviating  the  inclination  towards 
divorce and reducing marital boredom.

Methods
Because  this  study  is  a  non-pharmacological  interven-
tional  study,  it  was  designed  and  conducted  according 
to  the  CONSORT  guidelines  for  non-pharmacological 
randomized trials [11]. The study employed a experimen-
tal  pre-test-post-test  design  involving  three  groups  (two 
intervention groups and one control group).

The statistical population of this study was all couples 
who  visited  counseling  centers  in  Boroujerd  city  with 
marital  problems  in  2023.  The  research  sample  was 
selected  randomly  from  couples  who  voluntarily  regis-
tered  after  being  invited  to  couple  therapy.  The  sample 
size  was  calculated  with  the  formula  of  16  couples  for

20  couples  were  considered  for  each  group.  Finally,  60 
couples  (group  of  20  couples)  were  randomly  selected 
and placed into three groups using simple randomization.
Inclusion  criteria  encompassed  couples  contemplating 
divorce, aged between 20 and 50 years, possessing mini-
mal  education,  and  providing  informed  consent.  Exclu-
sion  criteria  involved  chronic  physical  illnesses,  severe 
mental  disorders  such  as  schizophrenia,  depression, 
bipolar disorder, substance abuse, missing more than two 
intervention sessions, failure to complete therapy home-
work  diligently,  expressing  reluctance  to  engage,  and 
incomplete questionnaire responses.

After  the  subjects  were  divided  into  three  groups, 
the  first  group  was  taught  Cognitive-Behavioral  Cou-
ple  Therapy(CBCT)  and  the  second  group  was  taught 
schema-based  couple  therapy  (both  groups  received 
intervention in the form of training classes), and no train-
ing was provided to the third group. At the end of each 
session,  homework  was  given  to  the  two  intervention 
groups. The intervention was implemented through edu-
cational classes. And at the end of each session, a review 
of  the  contents  of  the  previous  session  was  conducted. 
A  summary  of  the  intervention  sessions  is  reported  in

Inclusion  criteria  encompassed  couples  contemplating 
divorce, aged between 20 and 50 years, possessing mini-
mal  education,  and  providing  informed  consent.  Exclu-
sion  criteria  involved  chronic  physical  illnesses,  severe 
mental  disorders  such  as  schizophrenia,  depression, 
bipolar disorder, substance abuse, missing more than two 
intervention sessions, failure to complete therapy home-
work  diligently,  expressing  reluctance  to  engage,  and 
incomplete questionnaire responses.

After  the  subjects  were  divided  into  three  groups, 
the  first  group  was  taught  Cognitive-Behavioral  Cou-
ple  Therapy(CBCT)  and  the  second  group  was  taught 
schema-based  couple  therapy  (both  groups  received 
intervention  in  the  form  of  training  classes),  and  no 
training  was  provided  to  the  third  group.  At  the  end  of 
each  session,  homework  was  given  to  the  two  interven-
tion groups. The intervention was implemented through 
educational  classes.  And  at  the  end  of  each  session,  a 
review  of  the  contents  of  the  previous  session  was  con-
ducted. The method of enrolling participants in the study 
is explained in Fig. 1. A summary of the intervention ses-
sions is reported in Tables 1 and 2 [13, 14].

In  Schema-based  couple  therapy  sessions,  drawing 
from Yang’s Schema Therapy book, participants engaged 
in a series of ten 90-minute sessions designed to address 
relational  challenges.  The  specifics  of  these  sessions  are 
outlined in Table 2 [15].

Measurement tools
Enrich marital satisfaction questionnaire

In this study, the Enrich Marital Satisfaction Scale (1989), 
a  47-item  questionnaire  was  utilized.  The  questionnaire 
employs  a  5-point  Likert  scale,  with  response  options 
ranging from is scored from 1 to 5 (Strongly Disagree to 
Strongly  Agree  (,  resulting  in  a  minimum  total  score  of 
47  and  a  maximum  of  235.  A  higher  score  on  the  ques-
tionnaire  indicates  greater  marital  satisfaction  among 
couples. Olson reported the reliability of the Enrich ques-
tionnaire using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient as 0.92 [16].

Marital boredom questionnaire

The  Marital  Boredom  Questionnaire,  developed  by 
Pines  (1996),  comprises  21  questions  designed  to  assess 
symptoms  of  burnout  within  marital  relationships.  The 
questionnaire  encompasses  three  categories:  emotional 
fatigue,  mental  fatigue,  and  physical  fatigue.  Scores  on 
this scale range from 21 to 147, with higher scores indica-
tive of greater levels of marital boredom.

Test-retest reliability coefficients for this questionnaire 
were  reported  as  0.89  over  a  one-month  interval,  0.76 
over  a  two-month  interval,  and  0.66  over  a  four-month 
interval.  Additionally,  Cronbach’s  alpha  coefficients 
ranged between 0.91 and 0.93 [17, 18].

Willingness to divorce questionnaire

The Willingness to Divorce Questionnaire, developed by 
Rusbult  et  al.,  comprises  14  questions  aimed  at  assess-
ing the propensity of couples toward divorce. The ques-
tionnaire  evaluates  cognitive,  emotional,  and  behavioral 
categories  of  divorce  inclination,  in  which  the  cognitive 
category  includes  the  person’s  perception  on  divorce 
and  in  the  emotional  category  includes  the  positive  and 
negative feelings and emotions of the person towards the 
divorce, and the behavioral category includes the level of 
a person’s behavior towards or against divorce. The reli-
ability  of  this  questionnaire,  assessed  using  Cronbach’s 
alpha  method,  yielded  coefficients  of  0.91  for  divorce 
inclination and 0.86 for divorce tolerance [18, 19].

Data  analysis  was  conducted  using  Stata-17  software 
with a significance level set at 0.05. Analytical procedures 
involved verifying data normality using the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov  test.  Statistical  tests,  including  analysis  of  vari-
ance  (ANOVA),  were  employed  to  assess  differences 
between  groups  and  repeated  measurements  over  time 
(pre-intervention,  post-intervention,  and  one  month 
later) for each group.

Results
The  study’s  findings  revealed  that  there  were  no  signifi-
cant  statistical  differences  in  the  demographic  variables 
among the couples in the cognitive-behavioral group, the 
schema  group,  and  the  control  group,  indicating  homo-
geneity across the three study groups (Table 3).

The results of variance analysis indicated that the aver-
age  marital  satisfaction  scores  before  the  intervention 
were 57.63 in the cognitive-behavioral group, 58.02 in the 
schema group, and 56.9 in the control group, with no sig-
nificant statistical difference observed (P = 0.762).

However,  post-intervention,  the  average  marital  sat-
isfaction  scores  decreased  to  132.05  in  the  cognitive-
behavioral  group,  134.01  in  the  schema  group,  and  57.1 
in  the  control  group,  revealing  a  significant  difference 
between the groups (p < 0.0001).

Follow-up  assessments  indicated  no  significant  differ-
ence  in  marital  Satisfaction  scores  between  the  cogni-
tive-behavioral  and  schema  groups  (P > 0.05),  but  both 
groups exhibited significant differences compared to the 
control group (P > 0.05), highlighting the efficacy of both 
interventions. Notably, marital Satisfaction scores signifi-
cantly decreased post-intervention in both the cognitive-
behavioral  and  schema  groups  (P < 0.0001),  with  a  more 
substantial decrease observed in the cognitive-behavioral 
group,  the  control  group  showed  no  significant  changes 
in marital Satisfaction scores pre- and post-intervention 
(P > 0.05).

Repeated  measures  analysis  demonstrated  signifi-
cant  differences  in  marital  Satisfaction  scores  within 
the  cognitive-behavioral  and  schema  groups  over  time

(P < 0.0001),  with  noticeable  decreases  observed  post-
intervention and one month later.

However,  the  differences  between  post-intervention 
and  one-month  follow-up  were  not  statistically  signifi-
cant (P > 0.05) within these groups.

In  contrast,  the  control  group  displayed  consis-
tent  marital  Satisfaction  scores  across  the  three  stages 
of  assessment  (P > 0.05),  But  the  average  score  before 
the  intervention  and  one  month  after  the  intervention 
showed  a  statistically  significant  difference  (P < 0.0001). 

In the control group, the changes in the average marital 
Satisfaction score in three stages were constant (P > 0.05). 
(Table 4; Fig. 2).

The results of variance analysis indicated that the aver-
age  boredom  scores  before  the  intervention  were  2.83 
in  the  cognitive-behavioral  group,  2.81  in  the  schema 
group, and 2.88 in the control group, with no significant 
statistical difference observed (P = 0.386). However, post-
intervention,  the  average  boredom  scores  decreased  to 
1.45 in the cognitive-behavioral group, 1.5 in the schema

cant  difference  between  the  groups  (p < 0.0001).  Follow-
up  assessments  indicated  no  significant  difference  in 
boredom  scores  between  the  cognitive-behavioral  and 
schema  groups  (P > 0.05),  but  both  groups  exhibited 
significant  differences  compared  to  the  control  group 
(P > 0.05), highlighting the efficacy of both interventions. 
Notably,  boredom  scores  significantly  decreased  post-
intervention in both the cognitive-behavioral and schema 
groups  (P < 0.0001),  with  a  more  substantial  decrease 
observed  in  the  cognitive-behavioral  group,  the  control 
group showed no significant changes in boredom scores 
pre- and post-intervention (P > 0.05).

Repeated  measures  analysis  demonstrated  significant 
differences  in  boredom  scores  within  the  cognitive-
behavioral  and  schema  groups  over  time  (P < 0.0001), 
with  noticeable  decreases  observed  post-intervention 
and  one  month  later.  However,  the  differences  between 
post-intervention  and  one-month  follow-up  were  not 
statistically  significant  (P > 0.05)  within  these  groups.  In 
contrast, the control group displayed consistent boredom 
scores across the three stages of assessment (P > 0.05), But 
the average score before the intervention and one month 
after  the  intervention  showed  a  statistically  significant 

difference (P < 0.0001). In the control group, the changes 
in the average score of boredom in three stages were con-
stant (P > 0.05). (Table 5; Fig. 2).

The results of variance analysis indicated that the aver-
age  desire  for  divorce  score  before  the  intervention  was 
59.85  in  the  cognitive-behavioral  group,  63.85  in  the 
schema  group,  and  57.6  in  the  control  group,  with  no 
significant  statistical  difference  noted  among  the  three 
groups  (P > 0.05).  However,  post-intervention,  the  aver-
age  desire  for  divorce  scores  decreased  to  36.9  in  the 
cognitive-behavioral  group,  36.3  in  the  schema  group, 
and 58.1 in the control group, revealing a significant dif-
ference between the groups (P < 0.0001).

Follow-up  assessments  indicated  no  statistically  sig-
nificant difference in the average desire for divorce scores 
between  the  cognitive-behavioral  and  schema  groups 
(P > 0.05). Nevertheless, both groups exhibited significant 
differences  compared  to  the  control  group  (P < 0.0001). 
Both  the  cognitive-behavioral  and  schema  groups  dem-
onstrated a significant reduction in the average desire for 
divorce  scores  post-intervention,  and  this  declination  in 
the  schema  group  was  more  than  the  cognitive-behav-
ioral  group,  while  in  the  control  group  before  and  after 
the intervention, no difference was observed in the aver-
age score of desire for divorce (P > 0.05).

The repeated measurements analysis highlighted signif-
icant differences in the average desire for divorce scores 
within  the  cognitive-behavioral  and  schema  groups 
across  the  pre-intervention,  post-intervention,  and  one-
month  follow-up  periods.  However,  while  the  average 
score of the desire for divorce after the intervention and 
one  month  later  did  not  exhibit  a  statistically  signifi-
cant  difference,  the  disparity  between  the  average  score 
before  the  intervention  and  one  month  later  indicated 
a  notable  variance  (P < 0.0001).  In  the  schema  group, 
similarly,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  difference

Discussion
The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 
cognitive-behavioral  couple  therapy  and  schema-based 
couple  therapy  in  reducing  divorce  desire  and  marital 
burnout.  The  results  of  the  study  showed  that  after  the 
training  sessions,  divorce  desire  and  burnout  decreased 
and  marital  satisfaction  increased  in  the  intervention 
groups compared to the control group.

In the context of marital boredom, couples often expe-
rience a decline in intimacy over time, leading to dimin-
ished  emotional  attachment  and  feelings  of  alienation, 
disinterest,  and  indifference  towards  each  other,  often 
accompanied  by  the  emergence  of  negative  emotions 
[17].

The  findings  revealed  that  cognitive-behavioral  cou-
ple  therapy  led  to  a  decrease  in  marital  boredom  and 
the  inclination  toward  divorce  within  the  experimental 
group, both immediately after treatment and during the 
follow-up period, in contrast to the control group. These 
findings align with previous studies by Ricardo Silva [20], 
Pirfalak et al. [7], Maleki et al. [9], KhanjaniVeshki et al. 
[21], and Nilsson et al. [22].

Cognitive-behavioral  couple  therapy  plays  a  vital  role 
in  evaluating  and  reshaping  maladaptive  thoughts  and 
behaviors  to  establish  a  healthy  relationship  dynamic 
between  partners.  Through  cognitive  techniques  that 
involve examining thoughts, weighing the pros and cons 
of  these  thoughts,  reframing  negative  narratives,  fos-
tering  constructive  dialogues,  and  enhancing  couples’ 
self-awareness,  the  therapy  aims  to  shift  individuals’ 

Page 8 of 10

perspectives  from  negative  to  positive.  By  delving  into 
the  emotion-thought-behavior  cycle,  cognitive-behav-
ioral  therapy  addresses  both  personal  and  interpersonal 
challenges  within  couples,  highlighting  how  cognitive 
distortions  contribute  to  dysfunctional  emotions,  feel-
ings,  and  behaviors.  Ineffective  communication  patterns 
have  the  potential  to  exacerbate  anger  and  diminish  the 
willingness to sustain a marital bond [20].

Hence,  it  is  imperative  to  address  these  issues  and 
enhance communication through interventions. Training 
programs integrated into the cognitive aspect of therapy 
involve  cognitive  restructuring,  handling  negative  emo-
tions,  problem-solving  techniques,  adopting  effective 
coping  mechanisms,  positive  visualization,  and  refining 
both  verbal  and  non-verbal  communication  skills.  Pro-
moting active listening also plays a crucial role in allevi-
ating negative thoughts and behaviors, thereby fostering 
a more positive relational atmosphere. Therefore, in this 
study,  cognitive-behavioral  couple  therapy  effectively 
reduced  marital  boredom  and  diminished  the  desire  for 
divorce. These findings indicate that this approach signif-
icantly enhances the relationships of couples [23].

In  childhood,  humans  have  five  fundamental  needs, 
including  secure  attachment,  self-dependence  (indepen-
dence), freedom to express needs, spontaneity and plea-
sure  and  self-control.  The  degree  to  which  these  needs 
are  fulfilled  varies  from  person  to  person,  with  psycho-
logically  healthy  individuals  consistently  meeting  these 
emotional requirements. Neglecting or diminishing these 
needs can result in the formation of schemas, which are 
later  activated  in  adulthood,  evoking  emotional  memo-
ries  from  childhood.  Essentially,  schemas  symbolize  the 
unresolved childhood issues that continue to affect indi-
viduals into adulthood [24].

Schema  therapy  plays  a  significant  role  in  marital 
relationships.  Yang’s  schema  therapy  targets  cognitive, 
emotional, and behavioral domains. This research’s find-
ings  suggest  that  individuals  contemplating  divorce  may 
exhibit a tendency to withhold positive emotions even in 
response to positive behavior from their partner. Instead, 
they  often  react  swiftly  and  negatively  to  any  perceived 
negative behavior from their spouse, sometimes attempt-
ing  to  counterbalance  these  negative  interactions.  This 
negative  reactivity  can  escalate  into  hostile  behaviors, 
leading to difficulties in managing negative emotions and 
fostering  a  pattern  of  emotional  distancing  over  time. 
In  couple’s  therapy  employing  schema  therapy,  couples 
explore  the  roots  of  such  negative  behaviors,  acknowl-
edging the evolutionary origins of each schema. By com-
prehending  that  current  behaviors  are  rooted  in  past 
thoughts  stemming  from  childhood  traumas,  couples 
can  address  these  issues  through  education  and  schema 
therapy techniques. Consequently, they can identify and 
implement healthier alternatives for these schemas.

Conclusion
The  study’s  results  reveal  that  both  cognitive-behavioral 
methods  and  schema  therapy  within  couple’s  therapy 
were  equally  effective  in  tackling  marital  boredom  and 
reducing  the  inclination  towards  divorce.  Through  a 
comprehensive  approach  integrating  cognitive,  emo-
tional, and behavioral adjustments, along with interven-
tions  aimed  at  disrupting  negative  behavioral  cycles, 
establishing  boundaries  through  re-parenting  tech-
niques,  utilizing  tools  such  as  training  cards  and  engag-
ing  in  imaginative  dialogues,  couples  can  significantly 
enhance  their  relationships.  Consequently,  these  thera-
peutic  modalities  hold  promise  as  valuable  resources 
in  counseling  and  divorce  centers,  offering  avenues  to 
mitigate  divorce  rates,  resolve  relationship  challenges, 
improve  communication,  and  bolster  commitments 
between partners.

Schema  therapy  techniques  empower  couples  to  pre-
vent the activation of maladaptive schemas and cultivate 
appropriate  behaviors  and  thoughts.  These  techniques, 
such as writing a letter to an affected person, empty chair 
exercise,  engaging  in  mental  visualization,  and  creat-
ing  training  cards,  aid  in  reframing  negative  patterns 
and  promoting  healthier  relational  dynamics.  Conse-
quently,  schema-based  couple  therapy  has  the  potential 
to  alleviate  marital  boredom  and  reduce  the  desire  for 
divorce by addressing marital challenges, and enhancing 
relationships.

The  research  findings  indicate  that  schema  therapy 
for  couples  effectively  minimizes  marital  boredom  and 
diminishes  the  desire  for  divorce,  aligning  with  stud-
ies  conducted  by  Panahifar  et  al.  [24],  Fani  Sobhani  et 
al. [16], Mahnai et al. [25], Valizadeh et al. [10], Momeni 
et  al.  [26],  Hemmati  et  al.  [10],  Cheshmeh  Nooshi  et  al. 
[8],  Ahmadzadehaghdah  et  al.  [9]  and  Moradi  Vafa  et 
al.  [27].  The  schema  therapy  approach  integrates  cogni-
tive,  behavioral,  experiential,  and  relational  techniques 
to  challenge  maladaptive  schemas  underlying  negative 
thoughts.  By  addressing  and  processing  these  schemas, 
particularly  those  originating  from  childhood  experi-
ences  that  hinder  emotional  expression  and  warmth, 
couples can rekindle their desire to stay together, thereby 
reducing the likelihood of divorce and fostering psycho-
logical well-being.

This  research,  like  other  researches,  had  limitations. 
The therapy sessions were conducted with the presence of 
both couples and it seemed that some of them considered 
the presence of their spouses as an obstacle to their free-
dom of expression. Due to the fact that in this research, 
the data collection tool was a questionnaire, people may 
have  answered  the  questions  with  a  bias.  Also,  another 
limitation  of  this  study  is  the  reliance  on  voluntary  and 
available  participants  from  a  specific  geographic  region, 
which may restrict the generalizability of the results to a 
broader  population.  It  is  also  suggested  to  compare  the 
effectiveness of CBCT and schema-based couple therapy 
indifferent cities of Iran and investigate the effect of these 
two approaches on other variables, as well. The findings 
of this study can be effective in couples’ conflicts reduc-
tion. The results of the present study can also be used at 
family consultation centers, mental hygiene services cen-
ter, centers of crisis intervention, and family courts.
