Abstract

Background—Researchers have documented that child maltreatment is associated with adverse 
long-term consequences for mental health, including increased risk for depression. Attempts to 
conduct meta-analyses of the association between different forms of child maltreatment and 
depressive symptomatology in adulthood, however, have been limited by the wide range of 
definitions of child maltreatment in the literature.

Objective—We sought to meta-analyze a single, widely-used dimensional measure of child 
maltreatment, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, with respect to depression diagnosis and 
symptom scores. Participants and Setting: 192 unique samples consisting of 68,830 individuals.

Methods—We explored the association between total scores and scores from specific forms of 
child maltreatment (i.e., emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, and 
physical neglect) and depression using a random-effects meta-analysis.

Results—We found that higher child maltreatment scores were associated with a diagnosis of 
depression (g=1.07; 95% CI, 0.95−1.19) and with higher depression symptom scores (Z=.35; 95% 
CI, .32−.38). Moreover, although each type of child maltreatment was positively associated with 
depression diagnosis and scores, there was variability in the size of the effects, with emotional 
abuse and emotional neglect demonstrating the strongest associations.

Conclusions—These analyses provide important evidence of the link between child 
maltreatment and depression, and highlight the particularly larger association with emotional 
maltreatment in childhood.

Depression is a significant public health concern; indeed, major depressive disorder (MDD) 
is the leading cause of disability worldwide (World Health Organization, 2017). 
Understanding the etiology of depression, and in particular mutable factors that may play a 
causal role, is critical for reducing risk for this recurrent and debilitating disorder (Liu, 
2017). Prospective studies have documented that greater adversity in childhood is associated 
with more chronic depression (Klein & Kotov, 2016), more severe depression (Rhebergen et 
al., 2012), and a longer time to remission (Fuller-Thomson, Battiston, Gadalla, & 
Brennenstuhl, 2014). The role of early adversity in increasing risk for the subsequent 
development of depression is substantial; in fact, Kessler et al. (2010) estimated that almost 
25 percent of population-attributable risk is due to early adversity.

Among early adverse experiences, child maltreatment is a particularly potent risk factor for 
depression. Previous meta-analyses examining child maltreatment and depression have 
found that experiencing any form of maltreatment (treated statistically as the presence or 
absence of maltreatment) was associated with more than a two-fold increase in risk for 
depression in adulthood (Li, D’Arcy, & Meng, 2016), and with the development of chronic, 
or recurrent, depression (Nanni, Uher, & Danese, 2012). Although sexual abuse has received 
the most empirical attention (see Liu, 2017), it is noteworthy that different types of 
maltreatment frequently co-occur (Petersen, Joseph, & Feit, 2014). Thus, rather than focus 
on a single type of maltreatment, it is important to characterize the relation between different 
types of child maltreatment and depression. This perspective is supported by the emerging 
theory that early experiences that are characterized by threat (e.g., abuse) have different 
effects on the emergence of psychopathology than do early experiences characterized by a 
lack of species-expected input (e.g., neglect; Humphreys & Zeanah, 2015). Further, although 
physical, sexual, and emotional abuse have all been linked to depression (Mullen, Martin, 
Anderson, Romans, & Herbison, 1996), their different prevalence rates (Edwards, Holden, 
Felitti, & Anda, 2003), and their differential links to depressogenic features (e.g., low self-
esteem following emotional abuse; Mullen et al., 1996), underscores the importance of 
careful examination of different forms of maltreatment with depression.

Previous meta-analyses examining the association between maltreatment and depression are 
informative. However, while important, all are limited either by small number of available 
studies (e.g., 8 for Li et al., 2016; 12 for Infurna et al., 2016; 16 for Nanni et al., 2012) or by 
considerable variability in how child maltreatment was operationalized (e.g., Norman et al., 
2012), which limits comparisons across studies. Given that different definitions, informants, 
and thresholds for characterizing maltreatment are likely to result in different patterns of 
findings, there is value in prioritizing the meta-analysis of studies that use a common 
measure to assess maltreatment. In one such example, Infurna and colleagues (2016) 
conducted a meta-analysis of studies using the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse 
interview (CECA; Bifulco, Brown, & Harris, 1994). They also restricted their inclusion 
criteria to studies that required a clinical diagnosis of depression. This increased confidence

in their conclusions has a trade-off, which is that only 12 studies met inclusion criteria, 
which limited their ability to conduct moderator analyses. Moreover, experiences of 
maltreatment, as well as characterization of depression, may better be considered along a 
dimension (i.e., people vary in the severity of their maltreatment experiences [Humphreys & 
Zeanah, 2015; King, Humphreys, & Gotlib, 2019; McLaughlin, Sheridan, & Lambert, 2014] 
and depression to be represented both dimensionally and categorically [Ruscio & Ruscio, 
2000]).

Thus, we sought to meta-analyze studies that assessed maltreatment experiences on a 
continuous scale using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein et al., 2003; 
Bernstein & Fink, 1998). The CTQ is the most widely used measure of this construct; it has 
been shown to have acceptable internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and strong 
convergence with interviews that assess child trauma (Bernstein et al., 1994). The CTQ 
assesses five types of maltreatment experiences (i.e., emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual 
abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect) using a Likert-scale approach to assess the 
severity of each type of experience. By assessing maltreatment using a dimensional 
approach, and by using a single assessment measure (i.e., the CTQ), our meta-analysis 
maximizes consistency in the measurement of child maltreatment and increases confidence 
in the effect size estimates in relation to depression; moreover, this meta-analysis includes 
the largest set of studies and number of unique participants assessed using a single measure 
examined to date. Further, unlike prior meta-analyses that vary in the forms of maltreatment 
that were considered in their assessments, our approach allows us not only to probe 
associations between depression and overall maltreatment, but also to assess specific types 
of maltreatment measured at the same time using the same scale. Such an approach will 
yield insight into whether models indicating that the type of maltreatment or deviation from 
an expectable environment are differentially associated with depression (including neglect 
versus abuse; see Humphreys & Zeanah, 2015; McLaughlin & Sheridan, 2016; McLaughlin 
et al., 2014; or emotional maltreatment versus physical or sexual maltreatment). Finally, by 
including studies that examined depression using either a group-based approach (e.g., 
diagnoses) or a continuous approach (e.g., depression symptom scores), we can examine the 
strength and specificity using two widely used approaches to the assessment of depression.

Method

Study Selection

Each study satisfied the following inclusion criteria: (a) dimensional measurement of child 
maltreatment using the CTQ (either the long or short form); (b) dichotomous or dimensional 
assessment of depression; and (c) available data to calculate effect sizes (i.e., standardized 
mean difference in studies examining depression group and Z in studies examining 
depression scores).

Search Procedure—We used several strategies, outlined in the PRISMA flowchart 
(Figure 1), to identify the 190 journal articles with 192 independent samples that were 
ultimately included in this meta-analysis. First, we conducted computer-based searches 
using PubMed and Ovid for the following terms (or stems when appropriate) appearing

anywhere in the manuscript: (depress* OR MDD) AND (ctq OR “child trauma 
questionnaire” OR “childhood trauma questionnaire”). Second, we reviewed the 
bibliographies for additional studies using forward and backward searching. Third, we sent 
emails describing our meta-analysis and its inclusion criteria to professional membership 
LISTSERVs of research organizations including the Society for a Science of Clinical 
Psychology, the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, and Division 53. The 
majority of reviewed studies were excluded due to the presence of confounding medical 
conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, cancer), the lack of examination of CTQ as a 
predictor for MDD, and insufficient data for our quantitative analysis.

Data Extraction—Two trained raters independently coded each study. When raters 
provided contradictory judgments, disagreements were discussed and the lead authors made 
a final determination.

Moderator Variables—When heterogeneous effect sizes were detected, we tested whether 
potentially important demographic and methodological factors moderated the association 
between child maltreatment and depression. These moderators were selected on the basis of 
both recommendations from experts in meta-analysis (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001) and of prior 
work by the authors (Humphreys, Eng, & Lee, 2013; LeMoult et al., 2019; Muscatell, 
Humphreys, & Brosso, 2018). We coded the following demographic characteristics: (a) 
mean age of the sample at the depression assessment (in years) and whether the mean age 
was above or below age 18 years; (b) sex composition (percent male); and (c) racial diversity 
(percent Caucasian). We coded the following methodological characteristics of each study: 
(a) sample size; (b) year published; (c) sample source (i.e., clinic-referred; community; 
population-based; other); (d) assessment used to determine depression (i.e., Structured 
Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual [SCID] vs. other) or symptom 
scale (i.e., Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]; Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 
Scale [CES-D] vs. other); (e) whether the original 53 item version of the CTQ was used (vs. 
25/28 item short-form); and (f) the language in which the measures were given (i.e., English 
vs. other).

Calculation of Effect Size—We calculated two different types of effect sizes depending 
on whether depression was operationalized as a dichotomous (diagnosis of depression) or a 
dimensional (depression scores) measure. When depression was operationalized as a 
dichotomous measure, we calculated the Hedge’s g standardized mean difference (SMD) in 
order to estimate the effect size of the association between child maltreatment total scores 
and the onset of a diagnosis of depression. An estimate of 0 for the SMD effect size 
indicated that child maltreatment scores were equivalent in individuals with and without 
depression, whereas an SMD greater than 0 indicated that the depressed group had higher 
scores on the CTQ than did individuals without depression, and an SMD less than 0 
indicated that the depressed group had lower scores on the CTQ than did those without 
depression. When depression was operationalized dimensionally, we calculated the bivariate 
association between child maltreatment scores and depression scores by converting 
correlations and standardized β to Z values. A Z estimate of 0 indicated no association 
between child maltreatment and depression, whereas a Z value greater than 0 or less than 0

indicated that maltreatment had a positive or negative association, respectively, with 
depression scores. The 95 % confidence interval (CI) for the effect size represents the 
relative precision of the measurement (wider ranges are less precise). For each study, we 
calculated as many as 12 effect sizes: the two forms of depression measurement (diagnosis 
and scores) by CTQ total scores and the five types of child maltreatment. These procedures 
produced 609 total effect sizes estimated from 190 eligible studies. The number of studies 
were 39 for CTQ total score by depression group and 70 for CTQ total score by depression 
scores (see Tables 2 and 3).

Statistical analysis—We conducted random-effects models and estimated heterogeneity 
of effect sizes using the standard Cochran’s Q Test, which indicates the degree of 
consistency of findings across studies and approximates a chi-square distribution with k–1 
degrees of freedom, where k is the number of effect sizes (Hedges & Olkin, 1983). A 
nonsignificant Q test statistic suggests that the pooled OR represents a unitary effect. When 
the p-value associated with the Q statistic was equal to or less than .05, we conducted 
random-effects meta-regression analyses to determine whether the study characteristics 
described above could explain variability across studies. We assessed publication bias via 
Egger’s test (Egger et al., 1997). When we observed heterogeneous effect sizes, we 
conducted leave-one-out sensitivity analyses to test whether a single study unduly influenced 
effect size estimates. In addition, we examined whether any of the moderator variables 
predicted significant variance in the effect sizes that had significant heterogeneity. We used 
STATA 14 to conduct the analyses.

Results

Table 1 presents descriptive information for each included study, including details of 
demographic and methodological moderators coded and outcomes obtained. Extracted and 
coded data is available and can be obtained by emailing the lead author.

Child Maltreatment and Continuous Depression Scores

The number of studies that examined the relation between severity of child maltreatment and 
depression scores was 70 for total CTQ scores, and ranged from 48 (physical neglect) to 81 
(emotional abuse) for the subtype CTQ scores. Overall, there was a significant association 
between child maltreatment and depressive symptoms (Figure 2). The effect size estimates 
varied by type of child maltreatment: estimates were highest for emotional abuse and lowest 
for sexual abuse. All effect sizes differed significantly from 0, indicating a significant 
association between all types of child maltreatment and depression scores. Variation of the 
effect size within each meta-analysis is presented in Table 2. In addition, there was evidence 
of significant heterogeneity for all outcomes.

Child Maltreatment and Depression Diagnosis

The number of studies that examined the relation between severity of child maltreatment and 
diagnosis of MDD as 39 for total CTQ scores and 35 for each of the subtype CTQ scores. As 
with the correlational analyses, there was a significant association between total CTQ scores 
and a diagnosis of depression (Figure 3). The random-effects meta-analysis indicated that

individuals with depression reported higher child maltreatment scores than did individuals 
without depression, an effect that differed significantly from zero. The effect size estimates 
varied by type of child maltreatment: they were highest for emotional neglect and lowest for 
sexual abuse. All effect sizes obtained from meta-analyses differed significantly from zero, 
indicating a significant association between all types of child maltreatment and depression 
scores. Variation of the effect size within each meta-analysis is presented in Table 3. In 
addition, there was evidence of significant heterogeneity for all outcomes.

Moderators—We examined both methodological and demographic study-level variables 
that may explain variation in effect sizes within studies for each outcome (see Method for 
moderator variables of interest). We tested each coded moderator separately using simple 
regressions, weighted by the sample size for each study. Statistically significant moderators 
are presented by outcome in Tables 2 and 3. For total CTQ score and depressive symptoms, 
community samples were associated with larger effect size relative to other participant 
sources (t(69) = 3.18, p = .002). When the studies were divided based on whether the 
samples were drawn from the community vs. all others (e.g., clinic, population-based, etc.), 
we observed that the 48 samples not drawn from the community had a statistically 
significant (Z = 16.08, p < .001), but somewhat smaller estimate of the effect size (Z = .32 
[95% CI, .28−.36]) than did the 22 studies of community participants (Z = .43 [95% 
CI, .37−.49]), whose overall effect statistically differed from zero (Z = 14.06, p < .001). In 
addition, studies that used the CES-D, relative to other measures (e.g., BDI, etc.), on average 
had larger effect sizes (t(69) = 2.34, p = .022). Again, when the studies were divided based 
on the depression assessment measure, we found that studies that used the CES-D (n = 11) 
had a larger effect size estimate (Z = .43 [95% CI, .36−.51]) than did studies that did not use 
the CES-D (n = 59) (Z = .34 [95% CI, .30−.37]), although both sets of studies had effects 
that differed significantly from zero).

For emotional abuse, whether the mean age of the sample fell into childhood or adulthood 
(i.e., split based on the mean age of 18 years) emerged as a significant moderator (t(80) = 
2.34, p = .022). Analyses conducted within the 20 studies with child/adolescent samples 
yielded a larger association (Z = .45 [95% CI, .35−.54]) than did the 59 studies that included 
adults (Z = .36 [95% CI, .32−.39]), although in both cases the estimates significantly 
differed from zero (Z = 9.28, p < .001 and Z = 20.86, p < .001, respectively) and remained 
significantly heterogeneous. For this outcome, sample source was also significantly 
associated with effect size, such that population-based samples had smaller effect sizes than 
did other sample sources (t(80) = −3.12, p = .003). When the two studies that were 
population-based (i.e., Mikaeili, Barahmand, & Abdi, 2013; Schulz, Schmidt, et al., 2014) 
were excluded, the overall effect was similar to the full analyses (Z = .38 [95% CI, .35−.41]) 
and the effect statistically differed from zero (Z = 24.72, p < .001). In addition, year of 
publication was significantly associated with effect size (Coef. = 0.01, SE = 0.004; t(80) = 
2.35, p = .021): on average, more recently published papers had larger effects. For both 
emotional neglect and physical neglect, population-based samples had smaller effect sizes 
than did other sample sources (emotional neglect: Coef. = −0.21, SE = 0.07; t(57) = −2.87, p 
= .006; physical neglect: Coef. = −0.21, SE = 0.10; t(47) = −2.04, p = .047). When 
population-based samples were excluded, the overall effect was just slightly larger relative to

the full analyses (emotional neglect: Z = .31 [95% CI, .27−.34], physical neglect: Z = .24 
[95% CI, .20−.27]); the effects of non-population-based samples on depression differed 
statistically from zero (emotional neglect: Z = 17.24, p<.001, physical neglect: Z = 14.34, 
p<.001).

Finally, for the depression group analyses, a significantly larger effect size was found in 
studies that used the full 53-item version of the CTQ to assess the association between total 
CTQ score and depression group (t(38) = −2.62, p = .013). Analyses were repeated in the 11 
studies that used the original version and the 28 studies that used the short form; in both sets, 
the effect size estimates differed significantly from zero (CTQ-53: g = 1.64 [95% CI, 
1.14−2.14], Z = 6.45, p < .001 and CTQ-SF: g = 0.93 [95% CI, 0.82−1.05], Z = 15.59, p 
< .001). In addition, for CTQ total scores, the language in which the measure was 
administered moderated the observed effect size: studies conducted in English had smaller 
effect sizes than did non-English studies (Coef. = 0.50, SE = 0.22, t(38) = 2.23, p = .032); 
both English and non-English studies had effect size estimates that differed significantly 
from zero (English: g = 1.40 [95% CI, [1.10, 1.70], Z = 9.09 p < .001; non-English: g = 0.89 
[95% CI, [0.80, 0.99], Z = 18.45, p < .001). The same pattern was found for both sexual 
abuse (English: g = 0.65 [95% CI, [0.48, 0.82], Z = 7.40, p < .001; non-English: g = 0.37 
[95% CI, [0.31, 0.42], Z = 12.46, p < .001) and emotional neglect (English: g = 1.17 [95% 
CI, [0.93, 1.42], Z = 9.29,p < .001; non-English: g = 0.85 [95% CI, [0.73, 0.96], Z = 14.16, p 
< .001).

Publication Bias—For CTQ total score and depressive symptoms, the Egger’s test 
revealed statistically significant bias (t(69) = −2.02, p = .047). The negative intercept (Coef. 
= −0.91, SE = 0.45) indicates that the effects from the smaller studies are less than the 
effects from the larger studies, indicating that small studies are not upwardly biasing the 
estimate. A trim and fill procedure identified 0 missing studies. For emotional abuse, there 
was evidence of publication bias. The Egger’s test was statistically significant (t(80) = 2.41, 
p = .018), with a positive intercept (Coef. = 1.42, SE = 0.59) indicating that smaller studies 
may be upwardly biasing the effect. A trim and fill procedure identified 27 missing studies, 
with a filled meta-analysis estimate of Z = .29 (95% CI, .25−.33).

For the group-based analyses, there was evidence of publication bias from Egger’s test for 
total CTQ scores (Coef. = 1.31, SE = 0.56, t(34) = 2.32, p = .026), emotional neglect (Coef. 
= 1.40, SE = 0.45, t(34) = 3.12, p = .004), physical neglect (Coef. = 1.52, SE = 0.51, t(34) = 
2.97, p = .005). In all cases, smaller studies may have been upwardly biasing estimates. Trim 
and fill procedures indicated the following corrected effect size estimates for total CTQ 
scores: g = .88 (95% CI, 0.74−1.02; 8 missing), emotional neglect; g = .77 (95% CI, 
0.65−0.90; 12 missing), and physical neglect: g = .49 (95% CI, 0.35−0.63; 10 missing). In 
all cases, these revised estimates had effects that differed significantly from zero. No other 
associations were characterized by statistically significant tests of publication bias.

Leave-one-out Sensitivity Analyses—Given the significant heterogeneity in effects, 
we conducted sensitivity analyses for all of the outcomes using the leave-one-out approach 
(i.e., conducting the random-effects model following the removal of each study individually, 
with replacement). Tables 2 and 3 provide data indicating that no single study unduly

size estimates remained significantly different from zero.

Discussion

In this paper we report the result of a meta-analysis of 192 unique samples from 190 studies, 
consisting of 68,830 individuals, conducted to test whether child maltreatment was 
associated with depression diagnosis and symptom scores in adulthood. This is the largest 
study examining the association between child maltreatment and depression, increasing our 
confidence in the strength of the observed effect sizes. Across both methods of assessing 
depressive symptomatology, we found a significantly increased risk for higher depression 
symptom scores and depressive disorders (typically meeting criteria for MDD) as a function 
of greater reported severity of child maltreatment. In addition, in order to examine whether 
there was specificity in the association between different types of child maltreatment and 
depression, we conducted analyses across five types of maltreatment, all assessed using the 
same measure of child maltreatment (i.e., the CTQ). Consistent with expectations, we found 
that all types of maltreatment were associated with significantly higher depression scores 
and greater risk for meeting criteria for MDD. Importantly, however, emotional abuse and 
emotional neglect had the strongest associations with depression; we found weaker 
associations for sexual and physical abuse and physical neglect. In addition, the magnitude 
of the effect between emotional abuse and depressive symptoms was larger in samples of 
children and adolescents than in samples of adults.

The estimated effect size between child maltreatment scores and later depression was large; 
specifically, individuals with depression had, on average, total child maltreatment scores that 
were approximately one standard deviation higher than scores of their nondepressed 
counterparts. Even after applying a trim-and-fill procedure following the identification of 
possible publication bias favoring smaller studies with larger effects, the estimated effect 
size was almost one standard deviation difference between groups. These effects are 
substantially larger than those previously reported, which is bolstered by the large number of 
unique individuals who contributed data to these analysis and the advances in methods by 
including a dimensional assessment of child maltreatment. For example, across 9 studies, a 
composite measure of childhood maltreatment was reported to be moderately associated 
with a diagnosis of depression, although the confidence interval included zero (SMD=0.43; 
Infurna et al., 2016). It is possible that this discrepancy is due to differences in the scales 
used in these two meta-analyses (CTQ vs. CECA); for example, the range of possible scores 
is substantially greater in the CTQ and, further, many of the studies in Infurna et al.’s study 
used dichotomized experiences of maltreatment rather than applying a dimensional approach 
to assessing maltreatment.

Although all forms of child maltreatment examined in the present study were significantly 
associated with depression, the strength of the association varied by type of maltreatment. 
Three prior meta-analyses are relevant in interpreting these findings. Mandelli, Petrelli, and 
Serretti (2015) meta-analyzed studies that examined the association between binary 
measures of child maltreatment and diagnosed depression. These investigators found that 
emotional abuse (k=8) and neglect (k=6) were most strongly associated with depression

(ORs=2.8), and reported a weaker association for physical abuse (k=10; OR=2.0). Infurna et 
al. (2016) found that psychological abuse and neglect were the types of maltreatment most 
strongly associated with depression, and reported weaker, although still statistically 
significant, associations for sexual abuse. Finally, Norman et al. (2012) examined three 
forms of child maltreatment in relation to depressive disorders, and found the strongest 
association with emotional abuse (OR=3.06), followed by neglect, broadly defined 
(OR=2.11), and the weakest association for physical abuse (OR=1.54). While all three effect 
estimates differed significantly from zero, the effect estimate for emotional abuse and 
depression was significantly stronger than that for physical abuse and depression. In the 
present study, although effect size estimates varied across types of maltreatment, for 
depression diagnosis we found that emotional abuse differed significantly from physical 
abuse and sexual abuse, and that emotional neglect differed significantly from physical 
abuse, sexual abuse, and physical neglect, as represented by non-overlapping CIs. Such 
findings suggest that, for depression, predictions are less informed by whether maltreatment 
experiences are characterized by threat versus deprivation (e.g., McLaughlin et al., 2014; 
Sheridan & McLaughlin, 2014); instead, emotional maltreatment in particular could be 
depressogenic.

Importantly, more “silent” forms of child maltreatment (i.e., emotional abuse and emotional 
neglect) are most strongly associated with depression. This finding is consistent with 
theoretical and empirical accounts of maltreatment and depression. Compared to sexual and 
physical abuse, emotional neglect has been found to be uniquely associated with anhedonic 
symptoms of depression (Van Veen et al., 2013). Furthermore, Rose and Abramson’s (1992) 
developmental extension of the hopelessness theory of depression provides a framework 
through which to view the potential differential effects of emotional maltreatment. Rose and 
Abramson hypothesized that emotional abuse leaves individuals particularly vulnerable to 
developing a negative cognitive style, which in turn increases risk for depression. According 
to this formulation, children seek to understand the cause of the adverse life events they 
experience. Initially, these explanations are external, unstable, and specific (e.g., concluding 
that the cause of the abuse is not due to their stable characteristics of themselves, but instead, 
to some outside, isolated reason—for example, a parent having a stressful day). However, in 
the case of recurrent abuse, children may develop a more depressogenic causal attribution 
for the abuse (i.e., an attribution that is internal, stable, and global). In this context, 
emotional abuse may be particularly detrimental to children’s cognitive style because the 
abuser may state the negative causal attribution to the child (e.g., being called names). This 
formulation is supported by empirical work: emotional maltreatment during childhood has 
been found to be associated with negative self-referential processing (Steinberg, Gibb, Alloy, 
& Abramson, 2003), one potential risk pathway for depression. Our findings suggest that 
emotional neglect plays a similarly harmful role; thus, a depressive cognitive style may stem 
not only from the communication of negative cognitions, as in the case of emotional abuse, 
but also from lack of emotional support, as is the case with emotional neglect.

Among the moderators examined in this study, sample source and language used (i.e., 
English vs. other languages) emerged as particularly salient in relation to the size of effects 
that were estimated. Specifically, population-based studies demonstrated smaller 
associations than did other study recruitment sources. Sample source has also been found to

be a relevant moderator in other studies; our findings are similar to those documenting a 
stronger association between child maltreatment and depression in clinical than in 
population-based samples (Infurna et al., 2016). Type of sample (i.e., community vs. 
clinical) has been found to be associated with type of maltreatment and risk for depression 
(Mandelli et al., 2015); across sample types, these investigators found a strong association 
between neglect and depression; in contrast, in community samples emotional abuse was a 
stronger predictor of depression. In addition, studies conducted in English had larger effect 
sizes, on average, than did those conducted in other languages. Language is confounded with 
geography and cultural factors, and it is difficult to disentangle which of these may be 
responsible for explaining the differences in effect size based on this moderator. In addition, 
we found significant evidence of publication bias in several of the meta-analyses here. Our 
analyses conducted to identify what is more likely to be unbiased effects all continue to 
demonstrate a significant association between maltreatment and depression, although the 
effect sizes are lower and are more likely to be an accurate estimate of the magnitude of the 
associations.

Despite the plausibility that other moderators (e.g., sex, age of participants) are meaningful 
in understanding the link between child maltreatment and depression, for nearly all 
outcomes we found no significant evidence that the size of the effect was explained by these 
factors. For emotional abuse, however, we did find evidence of a larger effect in the relation 
to child depressive symptoms than those found in adult samples. Such findings may indicate 
that the association between emotional abuse and depression symptoms weakens over time 
and as individuals enter adulthood.

We should note five limitations of the present meta-analysis. First, because the studies 
analyzed for this meta-analysis were cross-sectional, we cannot speak to a direct causal link 
between emotional maltreatment and depression. In this context, there may be gene-
environment correlations for depression and maltreatment, given that parents with 
depression not only are passing on their genes, but also are more likely to engage in child 
maltreatment (Widom, DuMont, & Czaja, 2007). Second, the types of child maltreatment 
assessed in this meta-analysis do not occur independent of one another. Experiences of 
maltreatment, as well as other forms of stress in early life, are not randomly distributed: 
children who experience any one type of maltreatment are more likely to have experienced 
other types (Edwards et al., 2003). We are unable to determine the independent effect of 
each type using this approach, and we believe it would be useful going forward to use 
dimensional assessments of maltreatment type to document more thoroughly the overlap 
between each form of maltreatment. Third, we did not require that studies conduct clinical 
assessments to make diagnostic determinations of depression. While there are strengths to 
assessing depression dimensionally (see Ruscio & Ruscio, 2000), the use of clinical 
instruments may better capture functional impairment in relation to depression. Fourth, the 
assessment of child maltreatment in these studies was retrospective. While prospective 
studies also support the link between child maltreatment and depression (Li et al., 2016), 
there may be selective or biased reporting of adversity, which could affect the observed 
nature of the association between child maltreatment and depression (Colman et al., 2016; 
Patten et al., 2015). In fact, recent meta-analyses indicate that prospective and retrospective 
reports of maltreatment may identify different subgroups of individuals (Baldwin, Reuben,

Newbury, & Danese, 2019), which could mean that what we documented here as potential 
predictive pathways may instead be a better marker of concurrent mood and recollections of 
past experiences. Finally, the CTQ is not without flaws. We selected this measure given its 
widescale use, its ability to assess maltreatment using a dimensional approach, and its 
assessment of different subtypes of maltreatment. However, the CTQ does not provide 
details about the timing of events, which are likely to be important in understanding the 
association between stress and depression (Teicher, 2008). It also has psychometric 
limitations. In particular, researchers have noted low reliability of the physical neglect 
subscale (Gil et al., 2009; Paivio & Cramer, 2004), that has been attributed to greater 
variability in the types of items included on this subscale (Bernstein et al., 1994).

In closing, the present findings underscore the association between experiences of child 
maltreatment and depression in adulthood. The goal of the present study was to characterize 
the associations between depression in adulthood and child maltreatment generally, as well 
as specific forms of child maltreatment. Assuming that there is a causal link between child 
maltreatment and depression, next steps in this line of research include probing the potential 
mechanisms by which these early adverse experiences may lead to a diagnosis of depression 
and to increased levels of depressive symptomatology in adulthood. Identifying these 
mechanisms will be important in understanding why treatment response has been found to 
be moderated by childhood maltreatment status, with individuals who endorsed child 
maltreatment being less likely to respond to treatment (Nanni et al., 2012). Collectively, 
these results highlight the importance of reducing exposure to child maltreatment as a clear 
policy goal. Interventions and preventions that have been shown to reduce child 
maltreatment are important, and include the Nurse Family Partnership (Donelan-McCall, 
Eckenrode, & Olds, 2009) and the Triple P (Positive Parenting Program) (Prinz, Sanders, 
Shapiro, Whitaker, & Lutzker, 2009). While there is likely to be immediate benefit for the 
children and the parents who participate in these programs, it is notable that the effects may 
also have long-term positive mental health outcomes (Liu, 2017). Finally, researchers must 
consider emotional maltreatment (i.e., emotional abuse and emotional neglect) as 
influencing the etiology of depression; indeed, including these more silent forms of 
maltreatment in relevant studies should yield important insights concerning the causes of 
depression and treatment targets for individuals who are experiencing this debilitating 
disorder.
