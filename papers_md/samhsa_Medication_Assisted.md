The use of medications, in combination withcounseling and behavioral therapies, provides a “whole-patient” approach to the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs).Medicationsused are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are clinically driven and tailored to meet each patient’s needs.

Research shows that a combination of medication and therapy can successfully treat SUDs, and for some medications can help sustain recovery. Medications are also used to prevent or reduce opioid overdose.

The goal is to save lives and help people with theirrecovery, including the ability to live a self-directed life. This treatment approach has been shown to:

- Improve patient survival rates

- Increase retention in SUD treatment and recovery services

- Decrease illicit opiate use and other illicit activity among people with SUDs

- Increase patients’ ability to gain and maintain employment

- Improve birth outcomes among women who have SUDs and are pregnant

Research also shows that these medications and therapies can contribute to lowering a person’s risk of contracting HIV or hepatitis C by reducing the potential for relapse. Learn more about substance misuse and how it relates to HIV, AIDS, and Viral Hepatitis.

It’s important to remember that if medications are allowed to be kept at home, they must be locked in a safe place away from children. Methadone in its liquid form is colored and can be mistaken for a fruit juice. Children who mistakenly take medications may overdose or have an adverse reaction. Assistance needs to be sought for any known or suspected accidental ingestion.

Prevent children from accidentally taking medication by storing it out of reach. For more information, visit CDC’sUp and Awayeducational campaign. For information on how to dispose of medications in your house, refer to FDA’s informationHow to Safely Dispose of Unused or Expired MedicineorDEA’s drug disposal webpages.


## Low Barrier Models of Care


Low barrier care is a model for treatment that reduces requirements and restrictions that may limit access to care and increases access to treatment for individuals with substance use disorders. This approach meets individuals where they are and helps provide culturally sensitive care tailored to the unique circumstances and challenges that each person faces, improving treatment engagement and outcomes.
