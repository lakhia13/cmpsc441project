Abstract.
Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative movement disorder. Most PD patients are looked
after by caregivers who are close to them regardless of their relationship. Caregivers may experience a notable impact on
their mental health as they dedicate a signiﬁcant amount of time to the patient while observing the progression of the disease.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of burden, depression, anxiety, and stress among caregivers of PD
patients.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis between July and September 2023 among caregivers of PD patients
following in the Movement Disorders Clinic at King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and through the
Saudi Parkinson’s Society. The data collection was done anonymously through an electronic self-administered questionnaire.
Caregiver burden was assessed by using the validated Arabic version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) scale, and the
Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) was used to assess the presence and level of anxiety and depression.
Results: There were 118 caregivers (53.39% female, 33.9% aged between 35–45 years, and 73.73% were sons/daughters)
caring for 118 patients (57.63%, male, 38.98% aged between 66–76). The ZBI score was highest among sibling caregivers.
Moreover, burden scores were higher among those who provided care more frequently than others.
Conclusions: Our study revealed that PD caregivers face a high risk of care burden, especially those who are siblings and
spend longer periods in patient care. Additionally, female caregivers reported higher rates of depression, anxiety, and stress.

Plain Language Summary
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a serious condition that affects movement, and most PD patients are cared for by someone close
to them, such as a family member. This caregiving can signiﬁcantly impact the mental health of the caregiver, who often
spends a lot of time caring for the patient and witnessing the disease’s progression. We studied caregivers of PD patients
at the Movement Disorders Clinic at King Khalid University Hospital and through the Saudi Parkinson’s Society from July
to September 2023. Caregivers completed an anonymous electronic questionnaire, and we measured caregiver burden using

the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and assessed anxiety and depression using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS).
Our study included 118 caregivers (53.39% female, most aged 35–45 years, and 73.73% were sons or daughters) caring for
118 PD patients (57.63% male, most aged 66–76 years). Caregivers who were siblings or cared for the patient daily had
higher burden scores, and female caregivers had higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress compared to males. Our study
revealed that PD caregivers face a high risk of care burden, especially those who are siblings and spend longer periods in
patient care, and that female caregivers exhibited an elevated risk of experiencing depression, anxiety, or stress.

INTRODUCTION

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a disabling progres-
sive neurodegenerative movement disorder with four
cardinal motor features: resting tremor, slow move-
ment or bradykinesia, muscle stiffness or rigidity,
and postural instability.1 It is the second most com-
mon neurodegenerative disorder, with an incidence
of 5 in 100,000 to over 35 in 100,000 per year
worldwide and an incidence of 4.5 per 100,000 in
the Arab population.2,3 The estimated prevalence in
industrialized countries is around 0.3% for the gen-
eral population, and it increases with aging, reaching
3% for people older than 80 years.4 The prevalence
of PD in Saudi Arabia has been estimated to be 27
per 100,000.5 Despite pharmacological and surgical
strategies, PD is associated with a high risk of mor-
tality and a reduction in life expectancy with severe
disabilities, where the majority of PD patients in the
advanced phase become dependent on others in their
Activities of Daily Living (ADLs).6,7

Most PD patients are looked after by caregivers
who are close to them regardless of their relation-
ship; they could be partners, close relatives, or family
members.8−10 Moreover, caregivers may experience
a notable impact on their mental health as they dedi-
cate a signiﬁcant amount of time to the patient while
observing the progression of the disease. It is well
known that PD worldwide has an impact on care-
givers by increasing their burden, especially in the
late stages of the disease.11 Furthermore, it has been
determined that palliative care, including caregiver
support, is beneﬁcial and linked to PD patients expe-
riencing a higher Quality of life (QoL).12

The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) is a scale used
to measure caregivers’ burden and has been used
in a previous study, which revealed that most Saudi
caregivers experienced some degree of stress and bur-
den due to taking care of their elderly relatives.13
The consequences of caregiving that have been most
investigated are depression and stress. That said,

caregivers should be included in managing and coun-
selling PD patients due to their impact on the patient’s
QoL and disability.14 Furthermore, most PD patients
are diagnosed at retirement age, while at the same
time, their caregivers start to have new responsibili-
ties in their lives that consume their time and energy,
which can put the caregivers at a high risk of physi-
cal exhaustion and burnout.15 These are exacerbated
by poor stress management and physically inactive
patients.16

The extent of burden within communities, such as
the Saudi community, where caregiving is viewed as
a religious and cultural obligation, remains uncer-
tain. This study aims to explore the caregiver burden
and the prevalence of associated psychiatric illnesses
among those caring for individuals with PD.

METHODS

Participants

An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted
between July and September 2023 among caregivers
of PD patients who were following in the Move-
ment Disorders Clinic at King Khalid University
Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and through the
Saudi Parkinson’s Society by distributing the ques-
tionnaire among the patients’ caregivers. All informal
caregivers were included (the majority were fam-
ily members); however, we excluded paid caregivers
and non-Arabic speakers. The Institutional Review
Board of King Saud University approved the study
(E-23-7958).

Measurements

The data was collected anonymously through an
electronic self-administered questionnaire developed
to collect data on caregiver and patient demographics.
Each participant completed the study questionnaire,
which consisted of three sections. The ﬁrst section

S. Alshimemeri et al. / Parkinson’s Disease Caregiver Burden

1497

included the demographics of both the caregiver
and the patient, as well as information related to
the patient’s illness. The second section consisted
of the validated Arabic version of the Zarit Bur-
den Interview (ZBI).17 The third section contained
the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), used
for assessing the presence and level of anxiety and
depression among caregivers.

The validated Arabic version of the ZBI Scale
used to assess caregiver burden includes 22 items
divided into two factors: personal and role strain.17
The questions investigate multiple areas, including
caregiver health, psychological well-being, ﬁnances,
social life, and the relationship between patient and
caregiver. Each question scores out of 5 points, rang-
ing from never = 0 to nearly always = 4, and total
score ranging from 0 to 88. The cut-off values for
the ZBI are as follows: a score of 0–20 indicates lit-
tle or no burden, 21–40 indicates mild to moderate
burden, 41–60 indicates moderate to severe burden,
and 61–88 indicates severe burden.18 Furthermore,
caregivers’ depression, anxiety, and stress were eval-
uated using the Arabic version of the DASS-8 scale,
a shorter version of the DASS-21 scale that was
validated by A. Ali et al. to measure psychomet-
ric properties.19 It consists of 8 questions (three for
depression, three for anxiety, and two for stress). Each
question has a score from 0–3, where 0 = never and
3 = most of the time. The cut-off values of both the
depression and anxiety questions were 0–3 for nor-
mal, 4–6 for moderate, and 7–9 for severe. While the
cut-off values for stress were 0–2 for normal, 3–4 for
moderate and 5–6 for severe.

Statistical analysis

Data analysis was performed using R version 4.2.3
and Microsoft Excel. Continuous data was presented
using mean ± standard deviation (SD) and median
(minimum, maximum) values. Categorical variables
were represented by frequency and percentage. The
normality of the ZBI, DASS-8 subscales, and total
DASS score were assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk
test. The variables were found to follow a non-
normal distribution. The Mann-Whitney U-test was
used to compare the ZBI and total DASS score over
patient and caregiver characteristics with 2 groups.
The Kruskal Wallis test was used to compare the
ZBI and total DASS score over patient and caregiver
characteristics with more than 2 groups. Dunn’s test
is used as a post hoc analysis. Pearman’s rank cor-
relation test was used to measure the strength and

direction of associations. A p-value of less than 0.05
was considered statistically signiﬁcant in all the tests.
The correlation coefﬁcient was considered signiﬁcant
moderate positive when the correlation coefﬁcient
was ≥ 0.6 and was considered to be signiﬁcant high
positive when it was ≥ 0.7.

RESULTS

Caregiver’s characteristics (Table 1)

In our study, 118 caregivers participated, with
female caregivers representing 53.39% and male
caregivers 46.61%. The largest age category was 35
to 45 years old (33.9%), followed by those under 35
years (31.36%). Most caregivers (72.03%) worked
alongside others, while 27.97% were sole care-
givers. Among those working with others, 65.88%
had unpaid co-caregivers, and 34.12% had paid co-
caregivers. Regarding the relationship with the care
recipient, 73.73% were sons or daughters, 18.64%
were spouses, 3.39% were siblings, and 4.24% had
another relationship. The majority (78.81%) provided
daily care, while 12.71% provided care 2–3 times a
week, 3.39% once a week, and 5.08% less than once
a week.

Patient’s characteristics (Table 2)

Our study found that the majority of PD patients
were male (57.63%) compared to female patients
(42.37%). Most patients were in the 66–76 age
group (38.98%), followed by those aged 56–65 years
(23.73%). Additionally, 22.03% of patients were over
80 years old, 14.41% were between 45–55 years, and
less than 1% were younger than 45 years. Among
associated medical conditions, 33.05% of patients
were diagnosed with dementia or memory loss. In
terms of mobility, 34.75% of patients could move
around independently, while 50% required assistance
from caregivers or assistive devices, and 15.25%
were unable to mobilize at all. Moreover, 28.81% of
patients regularly underwent physiotherapy. Regard-
ing activities of daily life, 24.58% of patients were
self-sufﬁcient, 21.19% depended on caregivers for
complex tasks like bathing, 15.25% relied on care-
givers for basic activities such as eating, and 38.98%
were completely dependent on caregivers for all
aspects of daily life. Finally, 83.9% of patients
had not undergone any PD-related surgeries, while
11.86% had undergone DBS surgery, and 4.24% had a
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG) in place.

Zarit Burden Interview grading and DASS-8
subscales (Table 3)

Out of 118 caregivers, the ZBI grading indicated
that 37.29% of caregivers experienced no to mild
burden, 33.9% had mild to moderate burden, and
28.81% experienced high burden in their caregiv-
ing role. When assessing depression levels using the
DASS-8 scale, we found that 61.02% of caregivers
were normal, 24.58% had moderate depression, and
14.41% had severe depression. In terms of anxiety
levels assessed with the DASS-8 scale, 66.95% of
caregivers were normal, 23.73% had moderate anxi-
ety, and 9.32% had severe anxiety. Regarding stress
levels measured using the DASS-8 scale, 59.32% of
caregivers were normal, 27.12% had moderate stress,
and 13.56% had severe stress.

Zarit burden interview score and Total DASS
score over caregiver’s characteristics (Table 4)

We found that there is a signiﬁcant difference in
the ZBI score depending on the caregiver’s relation-
ship with the patient (p = 0.0461). The ZBI score was
high when the caregiver was a brother/sister, fol-
lowed by a spouse, a son/daughter, and then other
relations. From post hoc analysis, it is observed that
the ZBI score was signiﬁcantly higher among those
with a brother/sister relationship compared to other
relationships (p = 0.0407), as well as higher among
those with a spouse relationship compared to other
relationships (p = 0.0159). The ZBI score differed
signiﬁcantly based on the frequency of care provided
to the PD patient (p = 0.0238). It was observed that
the more often caregivers provided care, the higher
the ZBI score. Post hoc analysis showed that the ZBI
score was signiﬁcantly higher among those who cared

daily compared to those who cared less than once
weekly (p = 0.0131). Additionally, a signiﬁcant dif-
ference in the Total DASS score was noted based on
the gender of the caregiver (p = 0.0045), where it was
observed that females had a higher total DASS score
compared to males.

Zarit burden interview score and Total DASS
score over patient’s characteristics (Table 5)

We observed that the ZBI score was signiﬁcantly
higher when the PD patient was a female as opposed
to a male (p = 0.0114). Additionally, the ZBI score
was signiﬁcantly higher when the patient suffered
from dementia or memory loss (p = 0.0313). There
was a signiﬁcant difference in the ZBI score based on
the extent to which the patient mobilizes (p < 0.001).
From post hoc analysis, we found that the ZBI score
was high when the patients couldn’t mobilize at all
(p = 0.0018) or required assistance from a caregiver,
or a mobility aid (p = 0.0007) compared to patients
who could mobilize independently. There was a sig-
niﬁcant difference in the ZBI score based on the
type of activities the patient can do independently
without help from his carer (p < 0.001). From post
hoc analysis, we found that the ZBI score is high
when the patient was entirely dependent on their care-
giver as opposed to being independent in all activities
(p = 0.0030). There was a signiﬁcant difference in the
ZBI score based on the method of patient mobility
(p = 0.0341). From post hoc analysis, we concluded
that the ZBI score is high when the patient uses a
wheelchair (p = 0.0078) or requires assistance from
someone else (p = 0.0123) compared to patients who
could walk without assistance. The total DASS score
was signiﬁcantly higher when the patient suffered
from dementia or memory loss (p = 0.0279). There

DISCUSSION

Our study is the ﬁrst to examine the care burden
among caregivers of Saudi PD patients using the val-
idated Arabic version of ZBI to assess the burden and
the validated Arabic version of DASS-8 as a measure
of depression, anxiety, and stress.

Our study found that

the mean ZBI score in
our population is lower than that reported in other
countries. For instance, in a study across six Euro-
pean countries involving late-stage PD patients’
caregivers, the mean ZBI score among 506 care-
givers was 31.3 ± 16,20 while our mean ZBI score
was 15.6 ± 10.3. In the Saudi society, caregiving
is viewed as a fundamental duty towards family
members, inﬂuenced by cultural, religious, and soci-
etal norms. This may contribute to lower burden
scores among caregivers in Saudi Arabia. Addition-
ally, most PD caregivers in the same European study
experienced stress, while half had depression and
anxiety, contrasting with our ﬁndings, where most
Saudi caregivers did not report depression, anxiety,
or stress. In another study conducted in Italy among
caregivers of PD patients who were on continuous
dopaminergic delivering systems either LCIG or con-
tinuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI)
versus those on the standard of care, mean ZBI
score of 29.6 ± 14.4, 35.8 ± 20.2 and 31.4 ± 16.0
respectively.21 Interestingly, about 42% of caregivers
of PD patients who were on LCIG experienced a
mild to moderate burden,21 which was higher than
the 33.9% we found in our study. However, the num-

ber of PD patients utilizing LCIG in our sample was
small, and our study was not directed speciﬁcally at
caregivers of advanced PD, as was done in this study.
Baseline caregiver characteristics showed no asso-
ciation with the ZBI scale, except for the caregiver’s
relationship with the patient and the frequency of
care provided. We found that caregivers who were
siblings had higher ZBI scores compared to other
caregivers, including spouses and sons/daughters.
This could be attributed to the cultural and religious
perception of caregiving as a duty towards parents
and spouses, which is more pronounced than the
duty towards siblings. Further research could explore
how these cultural and religious beliefs impact the
experiences and burdens of caregivers from different
familial roles. Our ﬁndings were different from pre-
vious reports of studies performed in other countries,
where spouses as caregivers had a more signiﬁcant
burden and were highly correlated with depression
and stress than offspring caregivers, which might be
related to the age and longer care time.22−24 Although
age was not associated with a high disease burden
in our study, most caregivers were younger than 55
years. Furthermore, those who spent most of their day
caring for PD patients had high ZBI scores, which
is similar to a previous study, showing that longer
care time is considered a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
burden.23 The proposed theory behind this ﬁnding
is that patients who require longer care time may be
due to their dependency on others, contributing to an
increased disease burden on caregivers. We found a
correlation between the female gender of caregivers
and elevated DASS-8 scores. Unfortunately, no pre-
vious study measured DASS-8 among PD caregivers
or patients.

On the other hand, we found signiﬁcant associa-
tions between multiple patients’ characteristics and
an elevated ZBI score, including gender, coexisting

dementia or memory impairment, mobility, and per-
forming ADLs. Carers of female PD patients were
more likely to have higher ZBI scores. Moreover,
taking care of patients with dementia or memory
impairment and patients with limited mobility who
either cannot mobilize or need assistance with mobil-
ity had high ZBI scores and DASS-8. Finally, the
more the patient required assistance in their ADLs,
the higher the ZBI score. Findings regarding care-
givers’ burden association with patients’ gender and
memory impairment were consistent with previously
reported studies. Taking care of patients with neu-
rodegenerative disease is challenging, and several
factors contribute to this. A study conducted among
caregivers of Saudi patients with chronic diseases
reported that more than half of caregivers were
young females aged between 18 and 27 years old,

and their ZBI scores ranged from mild to moder-
ate (42.9%) with a mean of 31.3.13 Furthermore, a
study was conducted among caregivers of patients
with dementia used the Patient Health Questionnaire
PHQ-9, an instrument used for depression screening,
diagnosis, or monitoring.25 The study found a mod-
erate increase in depression scores among caregivers
compared to the general Saudi population. More-
over, those who were ﬁnancially responsible for the
demented patient and unemployed caregivers were
more likely to develop depression.25 Another study
conducted among Saudi caregivers who were sons
or daughters of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients
showed a high prevalence of depression, which was
even higher among caregivers of AD patients with
repeated falls.26 Furthermore, a study that measured
DASS scores among dementia patients and their care-

givers found that female caregivers who are caring
for dependent patients had higher distress scores,
when compared to male caregivers and caregivers of
an independent patients.27 The caregiver burden was
higher among caregivers of PD patients with mental
health symptoms, similar to other patients with neu-
rodegenerative diseases like AD.14 Furthermore, the
same study showed an association between depres-
sion and high burden among caregivers affecting their
QoL. Additionally, in a study that investigated the
burden among Chilean caregivers of PD patients by
using the ZBI and Beck Depression Inventory, they
found a high rate of depression among caregivers of
older PD patients and those who have balance or gait
abnormalities and cognitive impairment.28 Lastly,
more advanced disease was signiﬁcantly associated
with higher depression among caregivers.29

The role of coping strategies is crucial because
effective coping strategies can enhance caregivers’
mental health, leading to a positive impact on their
QoL and ultimately improving patient care. Among
Saudi caregivers of patients with chronic diseases,
various coping strategies have been suggested. A
study conducted among stroke patients and their care-
givers revealed that social support, particularly from
friends, was linked to lower scores of depression and
anxiety, contributing to a better QoL. Additionally,
the existential type of spiritual coping strategy has
been associated with good QoL and a reduced risk
of depression.30 Unfortunately, there is a lack of data
among PD caregivers.

Our study has several limitations. First, the sample
size is relatively small. Second, the lack of further
demographic information for caregivers, including
marital status, level of education, economic status,
and duration of care, might impact the burden score.
Additionally, the participants in the study were not
screened for any mental health issues that could
serve as a confounding factor in the study’s ﬁndings.
Third, patients’ disease history, duration of diseases,
and the number of medications the patients were on
could have signiﬁcant associations with high bur-
den, as seen in previous studies. Fourth, we utilized
the DASS-8 scale to assess the levels of depression,
anxiety, and stress among caregivers. Despite the
availability of more comprehensive scales, we opted
for this scale to ensure the questionnaire’s length was
manageable for participants, allowing them to com-
plete the questions more easily. Lastly, this study
was a cross-sectional study where data collection
was done anonymously through an electronic self-
administered questionnaire. Unfortunately, we were

not able to provide any intervention to address the
psychological burden among PD caregivers or pro-
vide them with possible coping strategies. Despite
these limitations, our study is the ﬁrst in Saudi Ara-
bia to assess the disease burden and psychological
aspects among PD caregivers, who play a signiﬁcant
role in patient care and support.

Conclusion

Our study showed that caring for female PD
patients, or PD patients with coexisting dementia
or memory impairment, decreased mobility, or those
who are dependent on their ADLs were signiﬁcantly
associated with higher risks of caregiver burden.
Additionally, PD caregivers who are at high risk of
caregiver burden are those who are brothers or sisters
and provide daily caregiving. The risk of depression,
anxiety, or stress is higher among female caregivers.
Finally, conducting more extensive future studies
focusing on the burden experienced by caregivers in
relation to PD is crucial. These studies are essential
for gaining a deeper understanding of the scope of the
problem and for further research aimed at enhancing
the QoL for both caregivers of PD patients and, ulti-
mately, the patients themselves. Such research efforts
can also guide the allocation of resources more effec-
tively.
