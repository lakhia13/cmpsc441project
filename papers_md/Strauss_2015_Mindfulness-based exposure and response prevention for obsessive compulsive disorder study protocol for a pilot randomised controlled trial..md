prevention for obsessive compulsive disorder:
study protocol for a pilot randomised
controlled trial

Abstract

Background: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a distressing and debilitating condition affecting 1-2% of the
population. Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is a behaviour therapy for OCD with the strongest evidence
for effectiveness of any psychological therapy for the condition. Even so, only about half of people offered ERP show
recovery after the therapy. An important reason for ERP failure is that about 25% of people drop out early, and even
for those who continue with the therapy, many do not regularly engage in ERP tasks, an essential element of ERP. A
mindfulness-based approach has the potential to reduce drop-out from ERP and to improve ERP task engagement
with an emphasis on accepting difficult thoughts, feelings and bodily sessions and on becoming more aware of
urges, rather than automatically acting on them.
Methods/Design: This is a pilot randomised controlled trial of mindfulness-based ERP (MB-ERP) with the aim of
establishing parameters for a definitive trial. Forty participants diagnosed with OCD will be allocated at random
to a 10-session ERP group or to a 10-session MB-ERP group. Primary outcomes are OCD symptom severity and
therapy engagement. Secondary outcomes are depressive symptom severity, wellbeing and obsessive-compulsive
beliefs. A semi-structured interview with participants will guide understanding of change processes.
Discussion: Findings from this pilot study will inform future research in this area, and if effect sizes on primary
outcomes are in favour of MB-ERP in comparison to ERP, funding for a definitive trial will be sought.

Background
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a distressing
and debilitating mental health condition affecting ap-
proximately 1 to 2% of the population [1,2]. People with
OCD experience unpleasant, repetitive, unwanted and
intrusive thoughts (for example, thoughts of harm com-
ing to a loved one) and engage in compulsive behaviours
that are meaningfully related to the thought in terms of

preventing harm (for example, repeated checking or
cleaning) or that are intended to reduce anxiety.

The behavioural theory of OCD draws on behavioural
theory of anxiety disorders more broadly and suggests
that compulsive behaviours are maintained through the
process of negative reinforcement. That is, compulsive
behaviours result in the temporary relief of anxiety, and
therefore,
these behaviours are reinforced, becoming
more likely to occur in the future [3]. This theory
informed behavioural therapy for OCD: Exposure and
Response Prevention (ERP) [4]. The therapy encourages
people to gradually and regularly expose themselves to
triggers of their intrusive thoughts (for example, touch-
ing surfaces perceived as ‘contaminated’) whilst not

engaging in their usual compulsive behaviours (for ex-
ample, hand washing). Although ERP was developed in
the 1960s [4], it is still the form of psychological therapy
for OCD with the most robust evidence of effectiveness.
Consequently, national treatment guidelines in the UK
recommend ERP as the psychological therapy for OCD
[2]. The guidelines recommend either individual or
group-based ERP, and there is randomised controlled
trial evidence that group ERP is effective [5] and that in-
dividually delivered cognitive behavioural
therapy for
OCD is not more effective than when delivered in a
group [6].

Despite the success of ERP, there are substantial limi-
tations. Only about half of people with OCD meet recov-
ery criteria after a course of ERP [7]. Primarily, this
seems to be because many people find ERP too challen-
ging; by definition, the therapy involves intentionally and
regularly exposing oneself to anxiety-provoking situa-
tions and disengaging from efforts to eliminate anxiety.
Twenty-five percent of people drop out of therapy early
[8]. Moreover, people with OCD show poor distress tol-
erance [9] and are therefore particularly likely to find it
difficult to engage in exposure-based therapies. Even
among those who do complete a course of ERP, many do
not fully engage with the regular between-session expos-
ure and response prevention tasks [10], with lower rates
of task engagement being associated with poorer therapy
outcomes [10]. Therefore, there is a real need to find
ways of making ERP more acceptable to patients in
order to reduce drop-out rates and increase engagement
with exposure tasks. Increasing patient engagement in
this way will hopefully lead to a greater number of
patients meeting recovery criteria upon completion of
an ERP course of treatment.

Mindfulness is a state of awareness characterised by
non-judgemental, accepting attention towards current
experiences, such as thoughts, feelings and bodily sensa-
tions. Training in mindfulness has been incorporated
into mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in recent
years [11,12]. There is increasing evidence that MBIs
have positive consequences for psychological [13,14] and
physical [15] health, in a broad range of mental health
[16-18] and nonclinical [19,20] populations.

research of MBIs

Despite this wealth of literature, there is a paucity
of
for OCD [21]. However, a
mindfulness-based approach might be expected to
enhance engagement with ERP for three reasons. First,
exposure during ERP elicits intrusive thoughts that the
person would typically attempt to eliminate by engaging
in compulsive behaviours. It has long been established
that intrusive thoughts are common throughout the gen-
eral population and are not usually problematic [22].
Mindfulness-based interventions teach people to allow
such thoughts into awareness without attempting to

suppress them and to attend to them non-judgementally
[12]. Therefore, a mindfulness-based approach to ERP
would be expected to enable people to be better able to
accept the intrusive thoughts elicited following exposure
to triggering situations and to remain engaged in the ERP
task despite these thoughts. Second, it is also well estab-
lished that people with OCD show a heightened intoler-
ance of anxiety [9]. Just as with thoughts, MBIs teach
people to notice and accept unpleasant physical sensations
and anxiety and to disengage from attempts to avoid or
eliminate them [12]. It would be expected, therefore, that
a mindfulness-based approach would help people to
attend to and accept the physical sensations of anxiety that
come about during ERP tasks and to, nevertheless, remain
engaged with the tasks. Third, MBIs encourage people to
notice the range of behavioural choices they can make in
response to an event, rather than reacting to such events
automatically [12]. A mindfulness-based approach to ERP
should, therefore, support people to better recognise their
urges to engage in compulsive behaviours and to make
these urges during ERP tasks.
the choice to resist
Mindfulness-based interventions are usually offered in
groups, and ERP can be offered either individually or in
groups [2]; thus, a group approach to integrating MBI
with ERP is warranted.

A group of six people, all with lived experience of
OCD who had experience of ERP and mindfulness-
based approaches, were consulted when developing
this protocol. The group advised that an integrated
mindfulness-based ERP group would be more likely to
improve symptom outcomes and to enhance engage-
ment in comparison to either type of intervention (that
is, MBI or ERP) on its own. In light of this advice and
the background literature outlined above, we expect that
a mindfulness-based approach to group ERP would be
more effective and have lower rates of drop-out than
group ERP on its own.

Given the lack of research in this area to date [21], this
is a protocol
for a pilot randomised controlled trial
(RCT). The research question for the definitive trial is as
follows: ‘Is group mindfulness-based ERP more effective
at reducing OCD symptom severity and better at enhan-
cing therapy engagement than standard group ERP for
people diagnosed with OCD?’ The primary aim of this
pilot study is to estimate the size and direction of the
treatment effect, and the corresponding 95% confidence
interval, by comparing mindfulness-based ERP (MB-ERP)
groups to standard exposure and response prevention
(ERP) groups on the primary outcome measures of
OCD symptom severity and therapy engagement. If
the magnitude of these effects are deemed clinically
relevant, then the estimate will be used in a power
calculation for the definitive trial. Secondary aims of
the definitive study will be to test effects on other

important outcome (depression and wellbeing) and
process (mindfulness and obsessive-compulsive beliefs)
measures and so these measures are included in the pilot
study to assess their feasibility. In addition, the pilot
study will gather information on rates of recruitment and
will record rates of attrition from the study. A semi-
structured interview with participants will also be
conducted to ascertain experiences of change and attri-
butions for change from participants’ perspectives. Infor-
mation from these interviews will inform the development
of future research in this area.

Methods/Design
Design and sample size
This is a pilot study for a single blind, prospective RCT
using an intention-to-treat comparison of two treatment
groups (MB-ERP and ERP). Measures will be taken at
baseline (Time 1), post-therapy (Time 2) and at 6 months
post-therapy (Time 3). A power calculation to determine
sample size is not appropriate for this pilot study
[23,24], as there is no intention to identify a statistically
significant difference between the two treatment groups.
This study follows recommendations for pilot RCTs [25]
and aims to have at least 12 participants per treatment
arm who provide full data. We aim to recruit 40 people
with OCD to allow up to 40% attrition from the study,
which is a conservative estimate of what might be ex-
pected to occur in ERP [8].

This study has received full ethical approval through
the South East Coast
the National
Research Ethics System in the UK (Research Ethics
Committee reference: 13/LO/1768).

Participants
Participants will be 40 adults referred to a mental health
trust in the South of the England. Inclusion criteria
are that participants (1) meet DSM-IV [26] diagnostic
criteria for OCD; (2) have been stable on psychiatric
medication for at least 3 months prior to the consent
meeting; (3) have no plans for changes to psychiatric
medication during the course of the study; (4) have
not received psychological therapy in the past three
months or have any plans for psychological therapy
during the course of the study; and (5) are older than
18 18 years of age. Exclusion criteria are as follows:
those who have an identified organic cause for their
OCD symptoms, a diagnosed learning disability, or if
they meet the diagnostic criteria, based on the Mini
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI version
6.0.0) [27], for a psychotic disorder, post-traumatic stress
disorder, anorexia nervosa, alcohol abuse or substance
abuse (non-alcohol). This will be ascertained through
the care team. To reflect the reality of mental health
services and the comorbidity of OCD with other

mental health conditions [2], comorbidity will not be
an exclusion criterion. People presenting with hoarding-
only compulsions will be excluded from the study, given
the recent move to classify hoarding as distinct from
OCD [1].

Measures
Diagnostic status
Mini
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI
version 6.0.0) [27]. DSM-IV OCD diagnostic criteria [26]
will be established at all three time points using the Mini
International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Meeting diag-
nostic criteria at baseline is an inclusion criterion for the
study.

Primary outcome measures
Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale - Second Edition
(Y-BOCS-II)
(Goodman, Rasmussen, Price & Storch:
Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale – Second
Edition Manual, unpublished). This measure is the pri-
mary outcome measure, rather than OCD diagnostic sta-
tus, as symptom severity is a continuous variable and is,
therefore, more informative about changes to OCD
symptom severity. The Y-BOCS-II is considered the gold
standard measure of OCD symptom severity [28]. It has
excellent indices of reliability and validity, including in-
ternal consistency and test re-test reliability alpha coeffi-
cients of over 0.8, and strong correlations with clinician
measures of OCD severity [28].

Exposure and response prevention engagement En-
gagement will be measured in two ways: (1) the number
of therapy sessions attended (maximum = 10) will be
recorded, and (2) participants will be asked to record
in a daily diary the number of ERP tasks performed
each day.

Secondary outcome measures
Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale [29].
The short version of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental
Well-Being Scale is a 7-item measure of well-being.
Stewart-Brown and colleagues [30] reported strong in-
ternal consistency, test re-test reliability, and concurrent
validity and found that
the measure is sensitive to
change in mental health populations.

Beck Depression Inventory - second edition (BDI-II)
[31]. Depression is often comorbid with OCD, with de-
pression thought to arise as the secondary condition [2].
The BDI-II is one of the most widely used measures of
depressive symptoms. Beck and colleague [31] reported
excellent internal consistency and test re-test reliability
(α >0.9 for both). Concurrent validity with the Hamilton
Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression-Revised is also
good (r = 0.71).

Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire - Short Form
(FFMQ-SF) [32]. The FFMQ-SF is a 24-item self-report
scale assessing five mindfulness facets: observing, de-
scribing, acting with awareness, non-judgement and
non-reacting. The short form has been reported to have
adequate indices of reliability (α > .73 for each subscale)
and validity [32].

Obsessional Beliefs Questionnaire - Revised (OBQ-44)
[33]. The OBQ-44 is a 44-item self-report measure of
cognitions associated with OCD. The instrument has
three subscales: (1) Responsibility/Threat Estimation,
(2) Perfectionism/Certainty, and (3) Importance/Control
of thoughts. The scales have excellent internal consistency
(α > .89 for each subscale), and the total score on the
OBQ-44 distinguishes between people diagnosed with
OCD and non-OCD anxious controls [33].

Change Interview [34]. The Change Interview is a
semi-structured questionnaire designed to ask partici-
pants their experiences of a psychological intervention.
Specifically, it asks about changes that have occurred in
the person’s life since starting the intervention and to
what they attribute these changes. Changes can be at-
tributed to the intervention or to other factors. Finally,
participants are asked to comment on the aspects of the
intervention that helped change to occur and those as-
pects that might have hindered change from occurring.

Procedure
Figure 1 shows the flow of participants through the pilot
RCT. Patients with a diagnosis of OCD will be sought
through mental health teams in the host NHS trust. In-
formed consent will be obtained from each participant.
Potential participants will be given a copy of the study
participant information sheet and will have the oppor-
tunity to discuss the study in person with the research
assistant (RA) before signing the consent form. The
study research assistant will conduct the baseline assess-
ments of consenting participants on the above measures
within four weeks of the groups starting. After baseline
assessments have been completed, participants will be
randomly allocated to either an MB-ERP or an ERP
group by a Clinical Trials Unit using block randomisa-
tion. Ten participants will be allocated to each group so
that there will be two MB-ERP groups and two ERP
groups in total. Ten therapy sessions for each group will
be facilitated by two clinical psychologists, at least one
of whom will be an accredited Cognitive Behavioural
Therapy (CBT) therapist and an accredited mindfulness-
based cognitive therapy teacher. Sessions will be held ei-
ther in NHS premises or suitable community venues.
Post-group assessments on each of the outcome mea-
sures will be conducted by a second RA who will be
blind to group allocation.

Therapy protocol
Exposure and response prevention groups
Participants in the ERP condition will be provided with
10 sessions of group ERP, with each session lasting two
hours. The group protocol
is adapted from a manual
(Van Noppen, Stekette & Pato: Group Behaviour
Therapy (GBT) Treatment Manual
for Obsessive
Compulsive Disorder (OCD), unpublished). Session 1
introduces the rationale for ERP. Sessions 2 to 9 involve
participants designing ERP tasks. Rather than developing
graded hierarchies, participants will design ERP tasks that
are expected to elicit the greatest levels of anxiety they
are willing to tolerate in relation to specific OCD areas of
difficulty [35]. One or more ERP task will be conducted
during the therapy session, with encouragement and sup-
port offered by a group facilitator. During in-session ERP
tasks, ratings of anxiety will be recorded at regular inter-
vals for each participant on a whiteboard in order to
observe the rise and fall in anxiety during the task. Fol-
lowing this, each participant will be asked to identify
three ERP tasks to conduct each day between therapy
sessions and to record daily engagement in these tasks
using a diary. In addition, participants will be encouraged
to engage in unplanned ERP tasks in daily life when fa-
cing obsessional cues, that is, to take as many opportun-
ities to apply the ERP approach to OCD as possible, and
this will include both planned ERP weekly tasks and un-
planned ERP tasks when the opportunity arises [35].
Session 10 will focus on consolidating learning from the
therapy group and developing a therapy blueprint for
continuing ERP once the group has ended. Regular
supervision will be provided for the group facilitators by
an ERP expert who will also rate and provide feedback on
audio recorded therapy sessions to monitor therapy
fidelity.

Mindfulness-based exposure and response groups
The MB-ERP group will be provided with 10 sessions of
mindfulness-based behaviour therapy (ERP), each ses-
sion lasting two hours. Session 1 will introduce the ra-
tionale for ERP alongside the rationale for including
mindfulness principles and practice. Sessions 2 to 9 will
each start with a 10-minute mindfulness practice: mind-
fulness of the breath and body (session 1); mindfulness
of the breath, body, sounds and thoughts (sessions 2-3);
mindfulness of thoughts (session 4-5); and mindfulness
of body,
thoughts, urges and action (sessions 6-10).
Mindfulness practice will be followed by a 20-minute
Socratic inquiry about the practices in order to draw out
learning, with a particular emphasis on the three areas
noted above: non-judgmental acceptance of (intrusive)
thoughts, non-judgmental acceptance of physical sensa-
tions (of anxiety) and a recognition that it is possible to
choose whether or not to follow behavioural urges

(to engage in compulsive behaviours). A three-minute
mindfulness breathing space practice [12] will also be
introduced from session 6 onwards for participants to
use on a daily basis to bring awareness to current experi-
ences and to facilitate engagement in ERP tasks. In
session 1, participants will be given an MP3 player with
the range of mindfulness practices for daily home prac-
tice, with practice being recorded in the daily diary. The
final 90 minutes of MB-ERP session will follow the same
ERP protocol outlined above with the addition that whilst
engaging in ERP tasks, participants will be encouraged to
bring mindfulness skills to the tasks. In particular, this
will involve an encouragement to bring mindfulness to
intrusive thoughts as they arise (allowing thoughts to
arise without suppressing them or becoming absorbed
with them), to bring mindfulness to physical sensations
of anxiety (noticing and accepting physical sensations of
anxiety with curiosity and interest) and to bring mind-
fulness to urges to engage in compulsive behaviours
(noticing compulsive urges and recognising there is a
choice available - a choice to follow the urge and a
choice to allow the urge to remain, without following it).
Session 10 will focus on consolidating learning from the
therapy and developing a therapy blueprint for continu-
ing MB-ERP after the therapy has concluded. As with the
standard ERP groups, therapy sessions will be audio re-
corded and rated by an expert to monitor and ensure
therapy fidelity. This expert will provide regular supervi-
sion to the group facilitators. Additional supervision will
be provided by an expert MBI therapist in order to en-
sure adherence to MBI principles and practice.

Data analysis
Participant characteristics will be examined at baseline
to check that the randomisation procedure has been suc-
cessful and any differences between the two treatment
groups are at a minimum. This will include a check of
between-group differences on demographic variables
(age and gender) and on all the outcome measures by
examining the descriptive statistics. The primary out-
comes will be evaluated through an intention-to-treat
analysis using linear mixed models to allow for missing
data that is assumed to be missing at random. For each
primary outcome, treatment effects will be calculated
simultaneously at both the post-therapy and the six-
month follow-up time points after adjusting for the
outcome measure at baseline and site. The models will
include treatment group (ERP or MB-ERP), time (post-
therapy or six-months follow-up) a time-treatment inter-
action and a random intercept. Corresponding standard
errors, significance levels and 95% confidence intervals
will be calculated for all treatment effects.

Data from the Change Interview will be analysed using
Thematic Analysis [36] within each condition (that is, a

Strauss et al. Trials  (2015) 16:167 

Page 6 of 7

separate thematic analysis for the ERP and MB-ERP
conditions). This will elucidate participants’ subjective
experiences of change in each type of intervention and
participants’ views on mechanisms of change, which the
Change Interview specifically addresses.

For the full trial, effect sizes alongside the minimum
clinically important difference, where relevant, on the
primary outcomes (Y-BOCS-II and engagement) will be
used to conduct a sample size calculation. Recruitment
rates to the study will be presented in terms of ‘number
of participants consented to the study per research as-
sistant days - that is, how many research assistant days
are taken on average in order to consent one participant.
This will allow us to estimate the research assistant time
that will be needed for recruitment in a full trial, once
the sample size calculation is conducted. Data complete-
ness will be monitored, and the percentage of consenting
participants contributing to all data-collection points
will be reported. If completeness falls below 95%, the re-
search team will consider strategies for improving future
data collection and handling missing data. Similarly, if
once recruited, the retention rate falls below 80%, the re-
search team will explore methods to increase retention
in the full trial. Data quality will be overseen by the trial
statistician.

Between-group effect sizes and data from the Change
Interview will inform a funding application for a defini-
tive trial of MB-ERP. If effect sizes on the primary out-
come measures (Y-BOCS-II, number of therapy sessions
attended and number of between-session ERP tasks
completed) are in favour of MB-ERP in comparison to
ERP, funding for a definitive trial will be sought, which
may include modifications to the current therapy and
study design depending on findings from the quantita-
tive data analysis, review of recruitment and retention
rates, and from the Change Interview. If effect sizes
on the primary outcome measures are not in favour of
MB-ERP in comparison to ERP, the research team will
review possible reasons for this, drawing on the Change
Interview findings and this will inform the next stage in
this programme of research.

Discussion
Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is the most
well-established and strongly evidenced psychological
therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). How-
ever, the approach is challenging for patients because it
involves them directly and regularly confronting their
anxiety-provoking triggers and staying with their feelings
of anxiety, rather than attempting to eliminate them by
engaging in compulsive behaviours. It is perhaps not
surprising, therefore, that many people refuse ERP as a
treatment option [37], that about a quarter of people
who do start ERP drop out [8] and that many of those

who do remain engaged in therapy sessions fail to en-
gage in the recommended regular between-session ERP
tasks, which is associated with poorer therapy outcomes
[10]. Taken together, around half of people with OCD
fail to show recovery after ERP [7].

Mindfulness-based ERP (MB-ERP) for OCD has the
potential to increase engagement with ERP and, there-
fore, could potentially improve therapy outcomes. The
therapy encourages patients to attend non-judgementally
to their intrusive thoughts, increase their acceptance of
physical sensations of anxiety, and bring greater awareness
to urges to engage in compulsive behaviours. This pilot
study directly compares MB-ERP groups to standard ERP
groups with the primary aim of generating effect sizes for
OCD symptom severity and measures of therapy engage-
ment in order to calculate the sample size needed for a de-
finitive trial. The hypothesis for the definitive trial is that,
in comparison to ERP, MB-ERP will lead to a greater re-
duction in OCD symptom severity and greater rates of
participant engagement.

Exposure and Response Prevention has remained rela-
tively unchanged since its development almost 50 years
ago and yet it remains the most effective therapy for
OCD [2]. Mindfulness-based ERP has the potential to
enhance the effectiveness of ERP through improving par-
ticipant engagement in therapy sessions and in therapy
tasks. This pilot study is the first step in evaluating this
possibility and the next steps will be determined by the
outcomes of this study.
