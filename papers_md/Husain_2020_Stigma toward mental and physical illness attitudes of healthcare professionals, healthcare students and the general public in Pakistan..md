Background

The evidence base for stigma in mental health largely originates
from high-income countries.

Aims

This study from Pakistan aimed to address the gap in literature
on stigma from low- and middle-income countries.

Method
This cross-sectional study surveyed 1470 adults from Karachi,
Pakistan. Participants from three groups (healthcare profes-
sionals, healthcare students and the general public) completed
the adapted Bogardus Social Distance Scale (SDS) as a measure
of stigma.

Results
All three groups reported higher scores of stigma toward mental
disorders compared with physical disorders. SDS scores for
mental illness in the general public were significantly higher than
in healthcare students (mean difference (MD) 6.93, 95% CI 5.45–
8.45, P < 0.001) and healthcare professionals (MD 6.93, 95% CI
5.48–8.38, P < 0.001). However, SDS scores between healthcare
students and healthcare professionals were not significantly
different (MD 0.003, 95% CI −1.14–1.14, P > 0.99). Being female

was associated with lower stigma scores and being over the age
of 30 years was associated with higher stigma scores.

Conclusions

Stigma campaigns in Pakistan need to target the general
population. However, evidence of negative attitudes toward
mental illness in healthcare students and healthcare profes-
sionals supports the need for stronger emphasis on psychiatric
education within undergraduate and postgraduate training in
Pakistan.

Individuals suffering from mental and physical disorders not only
endure the complications of their illness, but often face negative per-
ception of ill health from society. Stigmatisation encompasses
stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination.1 Members of a particu-
lar group are judged and discriminated against on the very basis of
belonging to that group (e.g. gender, race, sexual orientation).1
Corrigan has described two types of stigma: public stigma and
self-stigma.2 Although public stigma refers to society’s negative
perceptions of an individual deeming them socially unacceptable,
self-stigma is the individual’s self-labelling as socially unacceptable.
Both types of stigma extend to mental illness,3 as well as physical
conditions such as HIV/AIDS.4

increased hopelessness,

Stigma toward mental illness requires attention and under-
standing, as negative attitudes have persisted despite an increase
in tolerance toward other groups.1 Stigma has far-reaching conse-
quences, with evidence indicating high levels of stigma correlate
with reduced self-efficacy,
lowered
self-esteem and poorer quality of life.5 The negative effects of
self-stigma on self-esteem and self-appraisal, along with the impli-
cations for recovery, are beginning to be explored by the scientific
community. The relationship between psychiatric symptoms,
stigma and recovery is complex and likely to be bidirectional.6
Individuals with greater symptom burden may draw more
stigma, and conversely, stigma may worsen existing symptoms of
illness.6 Therefore, stigma may affect multiple facets of life and
general functioning. Stigma in mental health poses a significant
barrier to recovery and social inclusion.7 Although early interven-
tion in psychiatric illness is associated with improved health

outcomes,8 stigma has been found to inhibit help-seeking behav-
iour.9 Stigma in mental health is an independent predictor of
poorer outcomes after controlling for the initial severity of symp-
toms and disability.1

Negative attitudes held by the general public toward people with
mental illness appear to be based on lack of awareness and may
largely be shaped by the media.10 It is well documented that campaigns
increasing awareness and knowledge of mental illness are effective in
reducing stigma.11 Therefore, one would expect stigma to be less
prevalent in healthcare professionals with existing knowledge of
mental and physical disorders. Interestingly, evidence shows that
negative attitudes toward physical and mental illness in health profes-
sionals do not differ significantly from the general public’s attitudes.12
Negative stereotyping may persist in mental health practitioners
despite them having an increased awareness of mental disorders.13
A recent world survey found negative attitudes to be more prevalent
in low-income countries;14 however, the evidence base for stigma in
mental health largely originates from high-income settings.

The aim of the present study is to establish whether there are
differing attitudes toward mental and physical illness between
healthcare professionals, healthcare students and the general
public in Pakistan. Attitudes of healthcare professionals can have
a significant effect on patient care because negative attitudes con-
tribute to health inequality.15 Given their existing knowledge on
mental and physical disorders, we hypothesize that negative atti-
tudes toward physical and mental illness in healthcare profes-
sionals will be less pronounced than those of healthcare students
and the general public.

Method

This was a cross-sectional study of participant attitudes toward mental
and physical disorders. Ethics approval has been obtained from the
ethics committee of the Pakistan Institute of Living and Learning
(approval no. PILL/ERB/08-09).

Participants and sampling

The participants were recruited with a convenience sampling tech-
nique. Potential participants were approached sequentially, and
those meeting inclusion criteria were recruited. The inclusion cri-
teria were age 18 years and over, and belonging to one of the follow-
ing groups: healthcare students (medical or nursing), healthcare
professionals (general practitioners, psychiatrists, nurses or other
health professionals) or the general public. Healthcare professionals
were recruited from two teaching hospitals, Civil Hospital Karachi
and Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, as well as the Primary Care
Research and Development Network. Medical and nursing students
were recruited from the Dow University of Health Sciences and the
Dow Institute of Nursing. The general public sample was recruited
from local shopping centres. All participants were briefed about the
study by the researchers and informed consent was obtained before
surveys were completed. The sample selection was based on con-
venience method. Given our method of convenience sampling, we
acknowledge the limitations of generalisability. The post hoc
sample size calculation showed that 200 people per group would
give results with margin of error (i.e. 95% confidence interval) of
±7%. The post hoc power calculation also showed that the sample
sizes of all three groups were adequate for detecting a minimum dif-
ference of three points on the Social Distance Scale (SDS) with an
s.d. of ≤7 points, α of 0.05 and power of 0.8.

Instrument

The SDS aims to assess the willingness of the respondent to interact
with a member of a specific group at different levels of intimacy. The
first published SDS was designed by Emory Bogardus to investigate
stigma toward different groups based on their occupation, race and
religion.16 The SDS has been used extensively to measure attitudes
relating to a number of psychiatric disorders, including psychotic
illnesses17 and substance misuse disorders.18 The scale has also
been used in a number of studies comparing attitudes of healthcare
professionals,19 and among college students.20 Versions of this scale
have since been used to examine stigma in mental illness in middle-
income countries.21 The SDS has also been found to be reliable (α =
0.75–0.9).22 The availability of the SDS in the Urdu language
informed its use in the current study.

The Bogardus SDS was modified as follows: inclusion of four dif-
ferent mental and physical disorders and use of a three-point Likert
scale rather than ‘yes’ and ‘no’ response categories. The questionnaire
asked participants about their acceptance of individuals with four
mental illnesses (depression, bipolar disorder, substance misuse dis-
order and psychosis) and four physical illnesses (epilepsy, heart
disease, tuberculosis and diabetes) in five different social roles. The
five social roles were as a relation by marriage, as a friend, as a work
colleague, as a neighbour and as a teacher of
their children.
Responses were based on a three-point scale to describe the degree
of acceptance for each group (will accept, will accept after treatment
‘will
or will not accept).
accept after treatment’ was assigned a score of 1 and ‘will not accept’
was assigned a score of 2. A cumulative score for stigma was calculated
by the addition of the response scores in all five roles for physical and
mental illness, respectively. A maximum total score on the SDS was
40, with higher scores indicating more pronounced negative beliefs.

‘Will accept’ was assigned a score of 0,

Administration of the instrument

All the participants were given information about the purpose of the
study. Informed consent was obtained from those willing to take
part. Mental disorders were explained by describing symptoms
with the Urdu ICD-10.23 The SDS and a brief demographic variable
sheet were completed by all participants. Confidentiality was
assured and all questionnaires were anonymised.

Statistical analysis
The data was then analysed with SPSS (version 17 for Windows).24
The SDS scores for mental and physical illness were compared
within each of the three groups, using paired t-test to investigate
how attitudes differed within group. One-way ANOVA was used to
investigate whether there was a difference between the three
groups, and post hoc tests between pairs of groups (adjusted with
Bonferroni correction for multiple testing) were used to identify dif-
ferences between groups.

Views related to stigma are likely to be affected by age, gender,
education and profession. Multiple regression analysis was carried
out to investigate the effect of these confounding variables. The
SDS scores for mental and physical illness were dependent variables
in multiple regression analysis. All independent variables were cat-
egorical and used as indicator (dummy) variables. Categories of
variables were as follows: profession (three categories: general
public, healthcare student and healthcare professional), gender
(two categories: male and female), age (three categories: 18–30
years, 31–40 years and >40 years) and education (three categories:
no education, primary or secondary education and college or uni-
versity education).

Results

The SDS score toward mental illness was 29.82 (95% CI 29.10–30.54)
in the general public, 22.89 (95% CI 22.12–23.67) in healthcare stu-
dents and 22.89 (95% CI 22.28–23.50) in healthcare professionals.
The SDS score toward physical illness was 17.95 (95% CI 17.25–
18.65) in the general public, 11.75 (95% CI 11.06–12.43) in health-
care students and 12.66 (95% CI 12.15–13.18) in healthcare profes-
sionals. We carried out paired t-tests for within-group comparisons
(Table 1). The difference in the mean score indicates the differences
in attitudes toward physical and mental illnesses between the three
groups. All three groups reported more negative attitudes toward
mental illness (higher mean SDS scores) compared with physical
illness. The mean difference between SDS mental and physical
illness scores was 11.87 (95% CI 11.08–12.66, P < 0.001) for the
general public, 11.15 (95% CI 10.51–11.79, P < 0.001) for healthcare
students and 10.23 (95% CI 9.79–10.67, P < 0.001) for healthcare
professionals.

We also carried out between-group comparison with one-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni adjustment (see Table 2). Mean SDS
score for mental illness in the general public was significantly
higher than healthcare students (mean difference (MD) 6.93, 95%
CI 5.45–8.45, P < 0.001), and was also significantly higher than in
healthcare professionals (MD 6.93, 95% CI 5.48–8.38, P < 0.001).
However, mean SDS score for mental illness between healthcare stu-
dents and healthcare professionals was not significantly different
(MD 0.003, 95% CI 1.14–1.14, P > 0.99). Mean SDS score for phys-
ical illness in the general public was significantly higher than in
healthcare students (MD 6.21, 95% CI 4.88–7.53, P < 0.001), and
was also significantly higher when compared with healthcare pro-
fessionals (MD 5.29, 95% CI 4.03–6.55, P < 0.001). However,
mean SDS score for physical illness between healthcare students
and healthcare professionals was not significantly different (MD

We carried out a multiple regression analysis to investigate

(F(7, 1462) = 34.85, P < 0.0001), accounting for 14% of variance
(see Table 3). Healthcare students and healthcare professionals sig-
nificantly predicted a 6.55- and 8.09-point reduction on the SDS,
respectively, with the reference category being the general public.
Age groups 31–40 years and >40 years significantly predicted a
2.63- and 4.14-point increment, respectively, on the SDS, with the
reference category being the 18–39 years age group. Female
gender predicted a 0.96-point reduction on the SDS, with the refer-
ence category being male. Although the two education groups pre-
dicted higher scores, when the reference category was no education,
this effect was not significant.

Our second regression model, which investigated the effects of
independent variables controlling for each other on SDS scores
for physical illness, was also significant (F(7, 1462) = 34.85, P <
0.0001) and accounted for 11% of the variance (see Table 4).
Healthcare students and healthcare professionals significantly pre-
dicted a reduction of 6.5 and 5.594 points on the SDS, respectively,
when the reference category was the general public group. Age
groups 31–40 years and >40 years significantly predicted an increase
of 1.37 and 1.98 points on the SDS, respectively, when the reference
category was the 18–39 years age group. Females significantly pre-
dicted a 1.01-point reduction on the SDS when the reference cat-
egory was the male group. The two education groups predicted
lower SDS scores compared with reference category of ‘no educa-
tion’, but this effect was not statistically significant.

Discussion

Mental illness is more stigmatised than physical illness in Pakistan
across healthcare professionals, healthcare students and the general
public. This is consistent with recent findings from high-income set-
tings where mental illnesses are still stigmatised22 despite being per-
ceived as ‘diseases as any other’ and are understood to be treatable.

toward people with mental

Studies from low- and middle-income countries also support greater
stigmatisation of mental illnesses.25 A survey of medical students and
doctors from Pakistan reported that just over half of the participants

held negative attitudes
Explanatory models of mental illness with roots in religion and the
supernatural are more common in South Asian populations and
may contribute to such attitudes.27 Mental illness in traditional
societies is at times thought to be a consequence of social or moral
transgressions, and perceived to be divine punishment, demonic
possession or sorcery.26,27 When an individual suffering from
mental illness lives in a society with these perceptions, they are
often subject to shame and social exclusion.28 The social implications
of stigma affect the patient and extend to the family, whose entire
social status comes under threat.28 Physical illness is conceptualised
as a medical phenomenon, with even somatic symptoms of mental
illnesses being considered relatively socially acceptable. However,
emotional symptoms are regarded as a sign of weak faith.29

Attitudes of the three groups in our sample differed, with stigma
toward mental illness being more pronounced in the general public
compared with healthcare professionals and healthcare students.
We have conducted a rapid review of current evidence and were
unable to find comparative published literature exploring the differ-
ence in attitudes between healthcare students, healthcare profes-
sionals and the general public. However, published literature on
stigma has reported that the general public shows a higher degree
of social distance to mental illness in comparison with healthcare
professionals.19 Although there is limited comparative data from
Pakistan on the use of the SDS, a study from Nigeria found that
moderate social distance toward individuals with mental disorders
was commonly reported in university students. However, social dis-
tancing was less pronounced in students enrolled in medical studies
compared with students of other disciplines.30 In Pakistan, medical
students have reported more positive attitudes to mental illness
compared with their peers from non-medical programmes.31 Data
from high-income countries suggests that stigma as measured by
social distancing is prominent in pharmacy students.32 Stigmatising
attitudes toward mental illness in healthcare professionals and health-
care students were found to be high in our sample, albeit to a lesser
degree than the general public. Studies from low- and middle-
income countries have described stigmatising attitudes of health pro-
fessionals toward mental illness, and it is possible that health educa-
tion reduces negative perceptions but does not eliminate stigma
altogether. Positive attitudes toward mental illness in medical stu-
dents from Pakistan are thought to be related to the exposure students

have to mental health patients as well as their knowledge of mental
illness.31 A medical explanatory model of mental
illness may
remove the blame assigned to the affected individual;33 however, it
may not dispel all the myths surrounding mental illness. It may be
pessimism about treatment outcomes that leads to the negative per-
ception of mental disorders. A meta-analysis revealed that although
biological explanatory models of mental illness help to reduce the
blame attributed to the affected individual, there may be pessimism
for recovery.33 People with mental illnesses may be perceived as
having unchangeable conditions that are fundamentally more
serious and persistent.15 This perception may lead to greater social
distancing and contribute to stigmatising attitudes and stereotyp-
ing.33 It is therefore important that interventions focusing on
raising awareness should include dissemination about the treatability
of mental illness.

Regression models showed that being female predicted less
stigma toward both mental and physical illness. This is consistent
with wider literature, which indicates that women are less likely to
desire social distance from individuals with mental or physical ill-
nesses.34–36 Similarly, the finding that advancing age is associated
with more stigmatising attitudes, both toward physical and
mental illness, is supported by published literature.34,35 In our
study the level of education was not significantly associated with
stigma for either type of illness, which is inconsistent with reports
that higher levels of education lead to lower levels of stigma.36
This may be explained by sparse data in the ‘no education’ category

(n = 19), but given this finding, interventions to reduce stigma in
Pakistan should take this into consideration.

Strengths and limitations

The strengths of this study are the relatively large sample size and
the use of the adapted SDS. The SDS is a scale to assess stigma
with good to excellent internal consistency, reliability and construct
validity.22 However, this study could be further strengthened with
other measures that are more commonly used in international
research (e.g., measures of attitudes, or more current scales such
as the Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale).37 Also, caution
must be exercised when interpreting the generalisability of our find-
ings, given that recruitment was based on a convenience sampling
technique. Furthermore, the sample was restricted to the city of
Karachi, the most populous city in Pakistan, which has a relatively
higher literacy rate. The attitudes of the wider population in
Pakistan, particularly in more rural areas, may differ. Although
explanation was provided, this study required the participants to
have some existing understanding of various physical and mental
health conditions, such as bipolar, psychosis, epilepsy etc.

In conclusion, campaigns to raise awareness about mental dis-
orders are necessary for the general public, healthcare students
and healthcare professionals in Pakistan. The presence of negative
attitudes toward mental illness in healthcare students and health-
care workers in the current study indicates that focus on psychiatric

education needs stronger emphasis in undergraduate and post-
graduate training in Pakistan. More formal education about
mental disorders and recovery in the curriculum of healthcare
students, and clinical exposure to psychiatric care for healthcare
professionals, may go some way in tackling stigma in mental
health.38 Effective evidence-based interventions to address stigma
in healthcare professionals in low- and middle-income countries
have combined elements of education and direct contact with
people experiencing mental illness.39 Specifically targeting interven-
tions at healthcare students, who will be the front-line clinical staff
of the future, may have a more pronounced effect than mass cam-
paigns geared at the general public. More novel approaches to tack-
ling stigma must also be considered, with media and film
representing underused resources. Our group has co-produced
‘DIA’, to bring the
the critically acclaimed short-narrative film,
unique sociocultural implications of mental health in Pakistan to
the fore. ‘Parity of esteem’ must be championed by policy makers
at a national level in Pakistan, and learning from government initia-
tives like ‘Time to Change’ could inform strategies to increase public
awareness, challenge negative attitudes and reduce discrimin-
ation.34,40 The mental health gap is already significant in low- and
middle-income countries like Pakistan,41 and given that stigma
can contribute to disparities in care,1 addressing these issues may
have a major effect on public health in this setting.
