Background:  Chronic  pain  and  problematic  substance  use  are  commonly  co-
occurring  and  highly  detrimental  issues  that  are  especially  prevalent  in  U.S. 
veteran  populations.  Although  COVID-19  made  clinical  management  of  these 
conditions  potentially  difficult,  some  research  suggests  that  certain  veterans 
with these conditions did not experience this period as negatively as others. It is 
thus important to consider whether resilience factors, such as the increasingly-
studied  process  of  psychological  flexibility,  might  have  led  to  better  outcomes 
for  veterans  managing  pain  and  problematic  substance  use  during  this  time  of 
global crisis.

Methods:  This  planned  sub-analysis  of  a  larger  cross-sectional,  anonymous, 
and nationally-distributed survey (N = 409) was collected during the first year of 
the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Veteran  participants  completed  a  short  screener  and 
battery of online surveys assessing pain severity and interference, substance use, 
psychological flexibility, mental health functioning, and pandemic-related quality 
of life.

Results:  For  veterans  with  chronic  pain  and  problematic  substance  use,  the 
pandemic resulted in a significant lowering of their quality of life related to meeting 
basic  needs,  emotional  health,  and  physical  health  compared  to  veterans  with 
problematic substance use but no chronic pain diagnosis. However, moderation 
analyses revealed that veterans with these comorbid conditions experienced less 
negative impacts from the pandemic on quality of life and mental health when 
they  reported  greater  psychological  flexibility.  For  veterans  with  problematic 
substance  use  only,  psychological  flexibility  was  also  related  to  better  mental 
health functioning, but did not significantly correlate with their quality of life.

Conclusion:  Results  highlight  how  COVID-19  differentially  impacted  veterans 
with  both  problematic  substance  use  and  chronic  pain,  such  that  this  group 
reported particularly negative impacts of the pandemic on multiple areas of quality 
of  life.  However,  our  findings  further  emphasize  that  psychological  flexibility,  a 
modifiable resiliency process, also buffered against some of the negative impacts 
of the pandemic on mental health and quality of life. Given this, future research 
into the impact of natural crises and healthcare management should investigate

how  psychological  flexibility  can  be  targeted  to  help  increase  resiliency  for 
veterans with chronic pain and problematic substance use.

1. Introduction

Chronic pain and problematic substance use are two frequently 
co-occurring and significant health problems in the United States. On 
its own, chronic pain (e.g., pain lasting longer than 3–6 months and 
persisting beyond the healing of an initial injury or disease) is very 
complicated to treat (Qaseem et al., 2017; Dowell et al., 2022) and 
associated with a multitude of negative health problems and functional 
issues (Kerns et al., 2003; Rice et al., 2016; Hadi et al., 2019). In an 
effort to alleviate pain, many individuals turn to substances such as 
alcohol, tobacco, and opioids (Blanco et al., 2016; Ditre et al., 2019), 
leading to a higher prevalence of comorbid chronic pain and substance 
use concerns (Manhapra and Becker, 2018). The resulting interaction 
between chronic pain and substance use is complex. For instance, 
although frequent use of substances can have short-term analgesic 
impacts,  pain  is  often  exacerbated  during  subsequent  abstinence 
periods (Jochum et al., 2010; Ditre et al., 2018), and repeated opioid 
misuse can also induce hyperalgesia (e.g., increased pain sensitivity; 
Benyamin et al., 2008; Compton et al., 2012; Hooten et al., 2015). 
When chronic pain prompts self-medication through substances, this 
in turn contributes to escalating problematic substance use and poorer 
pain-treatment  outcomes,  resulting  in  a  positive  feedback  loop 
maintaining both issues (Ditre et al., 2019). Even in the absence of a 
formal substance use diagnosis, individuals with chronic pain can 
experience greater levels of pain due to problematic substance use or 
drinking and drug use that does not meet full substance use disorder 
criteria but is linked to personal distress, physical health issues, or 
legal or social concerns (e.g., Alford et al., 2016; Bello et al., 2018).

Comorbid  chronic  pain  and  problematic  substance  use  are 
especially prevalent in veteran populations (Oliva et al., 2017; Hoggatt 
et al., 2021). Compared to their civilian adult counterparts, veterans 
regularly demonstrate a higher prevalence of both chronic pain (e.g., 
past 6-month prevalence: 29.1% vs. 19.5%; Dahlhamer et al., 2018) 
and  substance  use  disorders  (past  12-month  prevalence:  12.8%; 
Hoggatt et al., 2021 vs. 3.0% National Survey on Drug Use and Health 
(NSDUH), 2019). Veterans with chronic pain are also at an increased 
risk for developing substance use issues (Morasco et al., 2011a). This 
comorbid chronic pain and substance misuse, including prescribed 
opioid misuse as well as other substances such as tobacco and alcohol, 
can result in multiple severe negative impacts such as mental and 
physical  health  issues  (Ward  et  al.,  2022),  difficulties  maintaining 
employment (Wyse et al., 2021), and lack of stable housing (Dunne 
et al., 2015).

Veterans with both chronic pain and problematic substance use 
may have found it particularly challenging to effectively manage their 
health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many patients 
with chronic pain, including those treated with prescribed opioids, 
faced cancelled or postponed pain treatment due to the pandemic 
(Eccleston  et  al.,  2020)  even  though  research  has  shown  that 

COVID-19 prompted worsening pain, depression symptoms, stress, 
social isolation, and decreased quality of life (e.g., Purcell et al., 2021; 
Compton  and  Marie,  2022).  At  the  same  time,  studies  conducted 
during the pandemic also identified resilient subsets of veterans who 
maintained  high  functioning  despite  their  pain  symptoms.  For 
example,  Lazar  et  al.  (2022)  found  that  despite  COVID-related 
disruptions  in  care,  many  veterans  with  chronic  pain  saw  the 
pandemic as an opportunity to enact positive lifestyle changes (e.g., 
working on work-life balance, joining a community bike ride) that 
increased their quality of life. Qualitative studies have also reported 
positive changes for veterans during COVID-19, such as allowing 
them more time at home to focus on beneficial health behaviors and 
re-engage with family members (Mohamed Ali et al., 2022).

Understanding  what  factors  may  have  helped  veterans  adopt 
positive behaviors to improve their pain experience and quality of life 
during COVID-19 could help inform future pain and substance use 
treatment. One such protective factor shown to buffer against negative 
mental  health  and  functional  impacts  for  individuals  facing 
challenging  life  circumstances  is  psychological  flexibility  (Gentili 
et al., 2019; Meyer et al., 2019). Psychological flexibility is characterized 
by an ability to remain present-focused and fully aware of emotions, 
sensations, and thoughts, be willing to accept them, and choose to act 
in  ways  that  align  with  individual  values  (Hayes  et  al.,  2004). 
Psychological  flexibility  fundamentally  reflects  how  an  individual 
adapts to difficult situations and stressful life events and how they cope 
with  their  internal  experiences  in  those  moments  (Kashdan  and 
Rottenberg, 2010). Such characteristics are, in turn, associated with 
improved mental health functioning and quality of life (Block and 
Block, 2006; Smeekens et al., 2007; Rüsch et al., 2008; Berking et al., 
2009) and have led many researchers to view it as a transdiagnostic 
protective factor (e.g., Kashdan and Rottenberg, 2010; Levin et al., 
2014; Kroska et al., 2020; Pakenham et al., 2020).

The  protective  qualities  of  psychological  flexibility  may  be  of 
particular importance when considering the coping of individuals 
with chronic pain and problematic substance use (e.g., Li et al., 2019; 
Gloster  et  al.,  2021;  Mallik  et  al.,  2021).  Notably,  psychological 
flexibility  supports  self-efficacy  for  both  pain  and  addiction 
management by increasing perceived power to enact positive change 
in  one’s  life  and  promoting  values-oriented,  goal-directed  action 
(Hayes  et  al.,  2004).  Understanding  the  benefit  of  increased 
psychological flexibility during this time may also be key to assisting 
these veterans, as psychological flexibility is a potentially modifiable 
factor  through  therapeutic  interventions  such  as  Acceptance  and 
Commitment Therapy (ACT) and other mindfulness and acceptance-
based  interventions  (Rash  et  al.,  2019).  Among  individuals  with 
chronic pain, psychological flexibility has been associated with less 
pain-related physical impairment (Vowles and McCracken, 2008), 
increased quality of life (Duarte et al., 2022), and reduced substance 
misuse  (Gentili  et  al.,  2019;  Li  et  al.,  2019).  Thus,  psychological

flexibility may be an important factor in understanding how veterans 
with  both  chronic  pain  and  substance  use  concerns  managed  the 
COVID-19 pandemic and can continue to manage symptoms in the 
everchanging public health landscape.

1.1. The current study

The  present  study  examined  the  relationship  between  chronic 
pain and psychological flexibility on mental health and pandemic-
related functioning for veterans reporting problematic substance use. 
Advancing  our  understanding  of  factors  that  can  buffer  against 
pandemic-induced  deteriorations  in  functioning  is  especially 
important for promoting the well-being of veterans with co-occurring 
chronic  pain  and  substance  use  concerns.  We  investigated  the 
following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1: Veterans reporting problematic substance use and a 
prior  chronic  pain  diagnosis  (vs.  no  chronic  pain  diagnosis) 
would report greater perceived deterioration in major areas for 
quality of life (i.e., finances, ability to meet basic needs, emotional 
health, concentration, and physical health).

Hypothesis 2: That psychological flexibility would be positively 
correlated  with  mental  health  functioning,  and  negatively 
correlated with problematic substance use, self-reported pain, and 
pandemic-related worsening of quality of life for all veterans.

Hypothesis 3: That psychological flexibility would moderate the 
relationship between chronic pain diagnosis and mental health 
functioning, such that lower levels of psychological flexibility will 
be associated with significantly poorer mental health functioning 
for veterans with chronic pain and problematic substance use. In 
addition, at higher levels of psychological flexibility, all veterans 
(i.e.,  with  and  without  chronic  pain  diagnosis)  would  report 
greater mental health functioning.

Hypothesis  4:  That  the  same  interaction  pattern  proposed  in 
Hypothesis 3 between psychological flexibility and chronic pain 
diagnosis  would  be  found  for  self-reported  pandemic-related 
quality of life, such that greater psychological flexibility would 
be  associated  with  better  quality  of  life  during  COVID-19  for 
veterans  with  chronic  pain  and  problematic  substance  use. 
We  also  hypothesized  that,  at  higher  levels  of  psychological 
flexibility,  all  veterans  would  report  less  negative  impact  of 
COVID-19 on quality of life.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Participants and procedure

veterans  with  self-reported  problematic  drug  and  alcohol  use 
administered using the Qualtrics federal platform between November 
24, 2020, and February 2, 2021 (results of the primary study published 
elsewhere: Reilly et al., 2022). Procedures and methods for collecting 
this data were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the VA 
Bedford Healthcare System. Survey participants were recruited and 
identified through the Qualtrics federally-approved survey platform 
using  their  panel-aggregator  system.  Participants  had  previously 
signed-up for specific online survey panels available through Qualtrics 
and  were  provided  via  the  panel  aggregator  system  with  basic 
information about the survey and a hyperlink. Subsequently, potential 
participants provided informed consent and then completed items 
assessing  inclusion/exclusion  criteria.  Eligible  participants  were  at 
least 18 years old and reported being a U.S. military veteran, which 
was confirmed through the review of multiple items related to age, 
service years, and DD214 information. Eligible participants reported 
problematic substance use as defined by a minimum score of 1 on the 
CAGE Adapted to Include Drugs (CAGE-AID; Brown and Rounds, 
1995). This procedure has been recommended by the Consensus Panel 
for  sufficient  breadth  in  identifying  veterans  with  potential  SUDs 
(Sullivan and Fleming, 2008). Participants were then provided access 
to the survey, which was estimated to take approximately 25 min to 
complete. Respondents were paid $4.80 to complete the survey.

A total of 436 participants completed the survey. Twenty-seven 
respondents (6.2%) were removed for not meeting pre-determined 
quality review standards (see primary data Reilly et al., 2022 for more 
information on the quality review process). The final data set consisted 
of 409 participants. Across the full sample, most respondents were 
male (76.5%), not Hispanic/Latino (91.9%), heterosexual (91.4%), and 
served  after  1990  (61.6%),  with  a  mean  age  of  54.96  (SD = 16.44). 
Similar to prior studies (Dahlhamer et al., 2018), a total of 31.5% 
(129/409)  of  participants  self-reported  receiving  a  chronic  pain 
diagnosis from a health provider.

2.2. Study measures

Survey-collected  demographics  included  self-reported  age, 
gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, income, armed service era, 
use of VHA services, and relationship status. Participants also self-
reported whether they had received a diagnosis of chronic pain or 
substance use disorder (defined for survey participants as a formal 
diagnosis received from a doctor or healthcare provider). Participants’ 
self-reported diagnosis of chronic pain was used to group respondents 
into chronic and non-chronic pain categories for analysis.

The three-item Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity scale (PEG-3) 
was used to assess (1) pain intensity, (2) pain-related interference with 
enjoyment of life, and (3) pain-related interference with daily activities 
over the prior week (Krebs et al., 2009). The PEG-3 has been found to 
be sensitive to change and differentiate between individuals with and 
without pain improvement over time (Krebs et al., 2010). The PEG-3 
items differentiate levels of pain severity continuously from a zero to 
ten scale. The composite PEG score, created by summing all items and 
dividing by three, can be viewed as a measure of total pain impact. For 
the  current  sample,  internal  consistency  was  high  for  the  PEG-3 
(α = 0.90).

This  study  was  an  a  priori  planned  sub-analysis  of  an  online 
survey of the effect of COVID-19 on physical and mental health of 

The Cut Down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye Opener (CAGE) Adapted to 
Include Drugs (CAGE-AID; Brown and Rounds, 1995) was used to

screen  for  problematic  substance  use.  This  is  a  validated  4-item 
measure that assesses the impact of participants’ use of alcohol and 
other  drugs  and  its  severity.  Per  the  CAGE-AID  protocol,  the 
questionnaire was only given to participants who reported current 
alcohol  or  drug  use.  It  consists  of  four  yes/no  questions,  “Have 
you ever felt you ought to cut down on your drinking or drug use,” 
“Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking or drug use,” 
“Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking or drug use,” and 
“Have you ever had a drink or used drugs first thing in the morning 
to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover.” The CAGE-AID has 
demonstrated both high internal consistency and high sensitivity and 
specificity to screen for problematic substance use (McIntyre et al., 
2021). It is not intended as a diagnostic tool.

Psychological flexibility was measured using the Psyflex Measure 
(Gloster et al., 2021), which assesses the major aspects of psychological 
flexibility: acceptance, mindfulness, and values-oriented actions in 
daily living. Items are rated on a Likert scale from 1 = very seldom to 
5 = very often and summed. The six-item measure aims to measure 
psychological  flexibility  by  capturing  each  domain  of  the  ACT 
Hexaflex  (Hayes  et  al.,  1999,  2011)  including  present  moment-
centeredness, acceptance, cognitive defusion, self-as-context, values, 
and committed action. Higher scores represent higher psychological 
flexibility.  According  to  Constantinou  et  al.  (2021),  the  Psyflex 
supported a one-factor solution across four clinical and non-clinical 
samples and demonstrated good psychometric properties (Cronbach’s 
alpha = 0.81; Gloster et al., 2021). For the current study, the Psyflex was 
found to be highly reliable (α = 0.88).

The  Pain  Management  Collaboratory  Coronavirus  Pandemic 
COVID-19  5-Item  Measure  (PMC-5;  Coleman  et  al.,  2021)  was 
created early in the pandemic to assess the potential negative impact 
of COVID-19 on quality of life. The developers of this measure suggest 
individualized  adaptation  as  appropriate  of  this  scale  by  clinical 
research teams to survey the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
study participants, leading to the inclusion of three of the original 
items five domains of pandemic impact in the current study: finances, 
ability to meet basic needs, and emotional health. Two additional areas 
were added to the scale, physical health and ability to concentrate, to 
assess physical and cognitive functioning changes, respectively. These 
domains  were  chosen  based  on  nascent  COVID-19  literature 
suggesting  these  social  determinants  of  health  management—
financial, physical, and emotional - might be particularly impacted 
during  the  pandemic  (e.g.,  Ryan  et  al.,  2020).  Each  quality  of  life 
domain was assessed on a Likert scale from 1 = improved to 4 = a lot 
worse.  Items  were  assessed  both  individually  and  as  a  total  score 
reflecting pandemic-related quality of life for veterans. In the current 
sample, internal validity was satisfactory (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.82).

Mental health functioning was measured using the Short-Form 
Health Survey-12 (SF-12; Ware et al., 1996), a 12-item measure that 
assesses global areas functioning. The SF-12 has been validated for 
predicting  populations’  mental  health  and  functioning  without 
targeting specific health outcomes and has high reliability, including 
with U.S. veterans (Salyers et al., 2000). The current study utilized only 
the mental health composite score (MCS-12) of the SF-12 as a measure 
of global mental health functioning, in line with past research using 
the SF-12 subscale specifically for mental health measurement (e.g., 
McAlpine et al., 2018). Scoring involves using a norm-based algorithm 
that produces a self-reported MCS-12 between 0 and 100 (Jones et al., 
2001),  with  lower  scores  associated  with  lower  mental  health 

functioning. Previous studies have indicated acceptable 2-week test–
retest reliability of 0.76 for the MCS-12 in the general U.S. population 
(Ware et al., 1996).

2.3. Data analysis

Initial descriptive statistics were examined using frequencies (n) 
and percentages (%), with independent sample t-tests and Chi-square 
tests  used  to  assess  for  potential  differences  in  sociodemographic 
variables (e.g., age, gender, use of VHA services), average pain level 
(PEG-3), and problematic substance (CAGE-AID) use by chronic 
pain  diagnosis  status.  Statistical  analysis  for  Hypothesis  1  then 
consisted of a comparative analysis of participants with and without a 
self-reported  diagnosis  of  chronic  pain  on  quality  of  life  using 
independent  samples  t-tests  for  each  categorical  variable  on  the 
PMC-5 (i.e., finances, basic needs, concentration and focus, mental 
health, and physical health). To analyze initial relationships between 
variables of interest, Pearson Product correlations were conducted for 
continuous variables to investigate indications of multicollinearity in 
the planned hierarchical multiple regression analysis for Hypotheses 
3 and 4. Multicollinearity among predictor variables was set at zero-
order correlations greater than 0.70, and continuous variables scores 
and errors were inspected for normalcy of distribution and residuals. 
Continuous  predictor  variables  were  mean-centered  prior  to 
computing an interaction term for the regression model. Hierarchical 
linear  regression  was  utilized  to  investigate  Hypothesis  3,  the 
relationship  between  chronic  pain  diagnosis  and  mental  health 
functioning, as potentially moderated by psychological flexibility, and 
Hypothesis 4, the relationship between chronic pain diagnosis and 
pandemic-related  quality  of  life  as  moderated  by  psychological 
flexibility. To correct for multiple tests, a Bonferroni adjusted alpha 
level of 0.05/k, where k was set at 6 (the number of predictors in the 
model) was used and partial regression coefficients were set to an 
adjusted alpha of 0.008. Survey participants were required to answer 
all survey questions, and thus the data set included no missing data.

Preliminary data analyses demonstrated that key assumptions for 
multiple regression analysis were met. Simple slopes analyses were 
conducted  for  significant  interactions.  In  the  first  step,  regression 
estimates controlled for age, self-reported problematic substance use 
behaviors, and total pain impact. In the second step, hypothesized 
predictors of psychological flexibility and chronic pain diagnosis were 
added to the model to assess for main effects. In the third step, the 
cross-product of psychological flexibility and chronic pain diagnosis 
was added to evaluate for the predicted interaction. These steps were 
repeated to test the same interaction model for Hypothesis 4 with the 
dependent variable of pandemic-related quality of life. All analyses 
were performed using IBM SPSS v26.

3.1. Chronic pain diagnosis and 
pandemic-related quality of life

For respondents with a self-reported chronic pain diagnosis, the 
mean  composite  PEG-3  score  over  the  prior  week  was  5.95 
(SD = 2.29), which was significantly higher than those not reporting

a  chronic  pain  diagnosis  (M = 3.30,  SD = 2.64),  t(407) = −2.81, 
p < 0.001, d = −1.04. A Chi-squared test revealed that compared to 
participants  with  problematic  substance  use  and  no  chronic  pain 
diagnosis,  participants  with  both  substance  use  concerns  and  a 
chronic pain diagnosis were more likely to have received clinical care 
from the VA, χ2 (1, N = 409) = 13.60, p < 0.01 and identify as a race 
other than Caucasian, χ2 (1, N = 409) = 5.89, p = 0.02. Veterans with or 
without chronic pain were equally likely to self-report having a formal 
substance use disorder diagnosis. Sociodemographic characteristics 
are presented for the full sample and by chronic pain diagnosis in 
Table 1.

To test Hypothesis 1, independent-samples t-tests were conducted 
to compare veterans reporting problematic substance use with and 
without comorbid chronic pain across five self-reported areas of quality 
of life measured by the PMC-5, including finances, ability to meet basic 
needs,  emotional  health,  concentration,  and  physical  health  (see 
Figure 1). There was a significant difference in the scores for perceived 
worsening of ability to meet basic needs by diagnosis for veterans with 
chronic pain and problematic substance use (M = 2.43, SD = 0.76) and 
those  with  problematic  substance  use  but  without  chronic  pain 
(M = 2.22, SD = 0.67) conditions; t(407) = −2.81, p = 0.008, d = −0.30; 
self-reported emotional health for veterans with chronic pain (M = 2.88, 
SD = 0.85) and without chronic pain (M = 2.65, SD = 0.75) conditions; 
t(406) = −2.63, p = 0.006, d = −0.30; and perceived physical health for 
veterans with chronic pain (M = 2.28, SD = 0.66) and without chronic 
pain  (M = 2.57,  SD = 0.79)  conditions;  t(404) = −3.61,  p < 0.001, 
d = −0.41. No significant differences were found for finances (p = 0.08) 
or ability to concentrate and focus (p = 0.12).

3.2. Regression analyses

Preliminary comparison tests for planned regression analyses were 
conducted to investigate possible differences by primary variables of 
interest  (chronic  pain  diagnosis,  mental  health  functioning,  and 
psychological flexibility), potential control variables (overall pain score, 
problematic  substance  use),  and  demographics  (age)  on  outcome 
variables.  Younger  age,  higher  levels  of  problematic  substance  use 
(CAGE-AID), and greater self-reported pain (PEG-3) were significantly 
related to poorer mental health functioning (MCS-12) and greater 
pandemic-related stressors (PMC-5; see Table 2). Consequently, age, 
CAGE-AID,  and  PEG-3  were  controlled  for  when  conducting  the 
subsequent hierarchical multiple regression to explain the variance in 
mental  health  and  pandemic-related  functioning.  Additionally, 
correlation analyses (see Table 2) were reviewed to assess Hypothesis 
2. Mental health functioning was negatively correlated with pain and 
substance use concerns, and positively correlated with psychological 
flexibility  for  veterans  with  and  without  a  formal  chronic  pain 
diagnosis.  All  continuous  variables  had  an  approximate  normal 
distribution with no significant outliers, and statistically significant 
relationships  among  variables  did  not  suggest  multicollinearity 
(absolute correlation coefficient greater than 0.70).

Hierarchical  multiple  regression  was  used  to  investigate 
Hypothesis 3, that the relationship between chronic pain and mental 
health functioning during COVID-19 would be moderated by an 
individual’s  self-reported  psychological  flexibility  (see  Table  3). 
Preliminary  data  analyses  were  conducted  and  assured  that  key 
assumptions  for  multiple  regression  analysis  were  met.  The 

interaction  between  chronic  pain  and  psychological  flexibility 
emerged  as  a  significant  predictor  of  mental  health  functioning 
(β = 0.15, SE = 0.07, p = 0.007).

Simple slopes analysis was consequently conducted to probe the 
interaction. Findings indicate that for veterans without chronic pain, 
higher levels (1 SD above the mean) of psychological flexibility were 
associated with greater mental health functioning, B = 0.16, β = 0.20, 
SE = 0.05, p < 0.001 (see Figure 2). This relationship was even stronger 
for veterans with chronic pain, such that those who reported greater 
psychological flexibility also reported better mental health functioning, 
B = 0.36, β = 0.45, SE = 0.06, p < 0.001. This indicates that psychological 
flexibility was a predictor for greater mental health functioning for 
veterans with substance use concerns, with or without chronic pain—
though the veterans with chronic pain showed particularly positive 
mental health impacts related to greater psychological flexibility. The 
overall  model  explained  21%  of  the  variance  in  mental  health 
functioning, total R2 = 0.21, F(6, 402) 17.34, p < 001.

Per Hypothesis 4, we also expected the pattern of interaction found 
for mental health functioning would hold for pandemic-related quality 
of life (Table 4). The interaction between chronic pain and psychological 
flexibility  emerged  as  a  significant  predictor  of  pandemic-related 
quality of life (β = −0.16, p = 0.003). Simple slopes analysis revealed that 
for veterans without chronic pain, higher levels (1 SD above the mean) 
of psychological flexibility was not significantly associated with better 
pandemic-related quality of life, B = −0.01, β = 0.12, SE = 0.00, p = 0.03 
(see Figure 3). This relationship was, however, significant for veterans 
with  chronic  pain,  such  that  those  reporting  greater  psychological 
flexibility also reported decreased negative impacts to quality of life due 
to the pandemic, B = −0.03, β = 0.39, SE = 0.00, p < 0.001. This indicates 
that psychological flexibility was a significant predictor for pandemic-
related quality of life, with veterans with chronic pain showing less 
perceived negative impact of the pandemic on their quality of life when 
they  reported  greater  psychological  flexibility.  The  overall  model 
explained  26%  of  the  variance  in  mental  health  functioning,  total 
R2 = 0.26, F(6, 402) = 23.73, p < 001.

4. Discussion

The current cross-sectional study of veterans with problematic 
substance use found that psychological flexibility appeared to buffer 
negative  outcomes  in  mental  health  functioning  and  pandemic-
related  quality  of  life  among  veterans  with  co-occurring  chronic 
pain. This buffering effect was also present among veterans with only 
problematic substance use (but without chronic pain) in relation to 
their mental health functioning, but not for their pandemic-related 
quality of life. Finally, although both groups reported decrements in 
quality of life due to the pandemic, those with comorbid chronic 
pain and problematic substance use reported reduced functioning 
across multiple discrete areas of quality of life that they specifically 
attributed  to  the  pandemic,  including  meeting  basic  needs, 
emotional  health,  and  physical  health  relative  to  those  without 
chronic pain.

Our finding of the moderating effect of psychological flexibility 
on  well-being  aligns  with  international  research  suggesting  that 
psychological  flexibility  may  have  served  as  a  potential  resiliency 
factor for adults during the first wave of COVID-19 (McCracken et al., 
2021). Consistent with other COVID-19 studies (e.g., Crasta et al.,

with differences across populations, underlying conditions, and waves 
of  the  pandemic,  that  psychological  flexibility  is  an  important 
component of resiliency, protecting against worsening quality of life 
and psychological concerns within the context of COVID-19.

Notably, the positive association between psychological flexibility 
and study outcomes appeared strongest for veterans self-reporting a 
chronic  pain  diagnosis.  Specifically,  psychological  flexibility 
demonstrated  the  greatest  benefits  for  increased  mental  health 
functioning  and  limiting  deleterious  pandemic-related  effects  for 
those  with  a  chronic  pain  diagnosis.  This  partially  supported  our 
hypothesis  and  is  consistent  with  evidence  that  psychological 
flexibility  is  associated  with  increased  functioning  for  those  with 
chronic pain and may be protective against pandemic-specific stress 
(Yu et al., 2021).

Our  findings  also  add  important  nuance  to  the  apparent 
benefit  of  psychological  flexibility  as  a  protective  factor, 
suggesting  it  is  increasingly  beneficial  for  veterans  with  more 
significant  clinical  profiles  (e.g.,  those  with  both  SUDs  and 
chronic pain). This is consistent with the theory of psychological 

flexibility that people who are more willing to experience difficult 
thoughts and feelings in the service of committed action guided 
by  their  values  would  potentially  experience  less  pandemic-
related  quality  of  life  changes  and  mental  health  issues. 
Psychological  flexibility  may  be  an  especially  important 
protective factor for veterans with chronic pain, who are more 
likely to have multiple functional and psychological conditions 
that  could  be  impacted  by  the  pandemic.  As  psychological 
flexibility is considered a transdiagnostic mental health resiliency 
process, its potentially potent effects for veterans with chronic 
pain underscores its importance as a protective factor.

Unlike veterans with chronic pain, those without chronic pain 
did not show differences in the impact of COVID-19 on quality 
of  life  based  on  their  psychological  flexibility.  Veterans  with 
problematic substance use but no chronic pain reported similar 
levels of COVID-19 impacts on quality of life, regardless of their 
level  of  psychological  flexibility.  This  could  be  because  for 
veterans who were managing specifically problematic substance 
use, quality of life was less impacted by the secondary difficulties

that veterans with comorbid chronic pain also cope with, such as 
clinic closures, physical health concerns, depression, and anxiety 
(Morasco et al., 2011b; Burke et al., 2015). It is also possible that 
veterans  with  chronic  pain  and  substance  use  issues  faced  the 
double disadvantage of managing both substance use issues and 
pain  during  COVID-19.  Specifically,  these  veterans  may  have 
experienced the reciprocal and negative cycle that occurs when 
pain  is  treated  with  recreational  substances,  which  negatively 

impacts long-term pain outcomes and results in further mood 
issues  due  to  the  added  impact  of  problematic  substance  use 
(Ditre et al., 2019). Higher levels of psychological flexibility may 
have  buffered  against  this  “double  disadvantage,”  as  it  can 
be particularly useful when external challenges arise that require 
re-evaluating  values,  health  goals,  and  viable  activities  (Roux 
et al., 2022). Thus, psychological flexibility may be more strongly 
beneficial for quality of life for veterans actively managing chronic

4.1. Limitations

Several limitations to this study exist. It is important to note that this 
is cross-sectional data, so these results identify important associations as 
foundations for further research hypotheses, but should not be construed 
as causal findings. Additionally, as the purpose of this survey was to 
assess the experiences of veterans in the community during COVID-19, 
and thus we utilized an online, anonymous survey unlinked to medical 
records, we were unable to verify self-reported diagnostic information 
related  to  chronic  pain  (though  veterans  in  our  sample  reporting  a 
chronic pain diagnosis also demonstrated significantly higher PEG-3 
scores, compared to veterans not reporting a chronic pain diagnosis). 
Second, our participant sample was not diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, 
or gender, potentially limiting generalizability. As the presence of pain 
and substance use comorbidities significantly affect multiple aspects of 
life, and this impact can differ for veterans with different racial, gender, 
and  ethnic  identities,  future  work  in  this  area  should  include  more 
diversity within their sample. Third, as the aim of our primary study was 
to assess veterans reporting problematic substance use, we did not have 
a  comparative  veteran  sample  with  chronic  pain  but  without  self-
reported substance use concerns to include in our analyses. Finally, given 
that  we  used  a  measure  for  the  overall  construct  of  psychological 
flexibility, the individual components of this construct (e.g., acceptance, 
mindfulness, valued living) could not be evaluated and represent an 
important area for future research.

5. Conclusion

Co-occurring problematic substance use and chronic pain are 
common, and our results provide evidence that a modifiable resiliency 
process  (i.e.,  psychological  flexibility)  can  be  targeted  to  improve 
quality of life and mental health functioning. Given the transdiagnostic 
nature of psychological flexibility, these benefits may be generalizable 
to other conditions and warrant further study to explore the clinical 
applications of these results. Lastly, focusing on only chronic pain or 
substance use concerns when treating veterans with both issues may 
not adequately address the interrelationship between both conditions, 
which may be especially detrimental during moments of challenge, 
both  personally  and  globally.  Future  research  should  continue  to 
investigate the interaction between pain and substance use issues and 
protective factors such as psychological flexibility.
