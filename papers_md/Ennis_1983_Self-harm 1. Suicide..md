risk of suicide can be assessed by
means of a relatively simple clinical

consult their family doctors within
the month before their death, physi-
cians are in a unique position to
prevent suicide. Routine assessment
of the risk of suicide among patients
who appear depressed or are under-
going an emotional crisis can lead to
accurate diagnosis and effective in-
tervention. Similarly, the appropriate
use of psychotropic medication can
lead to effective treatment while min-

What is suicide?

Suicide refers to the act of taking
one's own life - literally, self-mur-
der. Although the definition is obvi-
ous, determining whether an individ-
ual's death is suicide is difficult for
a number of reasons. Coroners vary
greatly in their readiness to desig-
nate a death as a
suicide. Their
decisions are influenced by cultural
attitudes towards suicide, and at
times by the implications for surviv-

ing to improve the accuracy of the
reporting of suicides, the validity of
much of
and
cross-cultural research on suicide is
limited by unreliable and inconsis-
tent reporting.

epidemiologic

the

The results of intensive investiga-
tions and comparisons of popula-
tions of "completed" and "attempt-
ed" suicide46 have cast doubt on the
usefulness of the term "attempted
suicide", which suggests that an in-
dividual has attempted to take his or
her life, but through chance, luck,
ineptitude or medical intervention
has been saved. However, the at-
tempt may carry little intent to die.
It may represent a cry for help or an
attempt to hurt or manipulate oth-
ers. A high degree of ambivalence
may make it hard to differentiate a
suicide attempt from a suicidal ges-
ture. Therefore, recently investiga-
tors have used other terms, such as
"parasuicide"6 or "deliberate nonfa-
tal self-harm".7 The term self-harm
is used in this paper.

Epidemiologic aspects

Suicide rates vary considerably
between countries and over time. In
Canada there has been a striking
recent increase in suicide rates, from
7.6/100 000 in 1,9608 to 14.0/100 000
in 1980.' Similar increases through-
out most of the Western world in
the past 20 years have caused grow-

Suicide rates generally rise with
increasing age, peaking in middle
age and remaining high in old age.
However, in the past 20 years there
have been shifts in this pattern. The
rates are now highest among 25- to
35-year-old men, and there has been
an increase among adolescents.'0"2 15

cide generally follows an "acute sui-
cidal crisis", which is often brief,
perhaps lasting only a few hours or
days. This implies that if the indi-
vidual can be helped at the time of
the crisis, his or her suicide can be
prevented. Second, suicidal acts are
ambivalent; that is, the individual
does not merely wish to die or to be
saved. People who make serious at-
tempts to kill themselves often leave
some margin for rescue. As well,
retrospective studies of people who
have committed suicide have re-
vealed that most of them not only
discussed their plans of suicide with
friends or relatives but also consult-
ed physicians shortly before their
deaths.22'23 Third, suicide usually in-

Assessing the risk of suicide

Recent research into the preven-
tion of suicide has focused on evalu-
ation of suicide risk. The closer an
individual comes to having the pro-
file of the typical suicide victim the
higher the risk. Despite the current
concern about the increase in suicide
rates among the young, special at-
tention is warranted for the middle-
aged and elderly. Suicide is the 17th
most frequent cause of death in
those over 65 years of age, and the
risk of suicide is four times greater
in those over 55 years of age.27 The

complaints, in the last weeks before
their death.27'20

How can physicians prevent sui-
cide? It is essential to be aware that
there is a risk of suicide in every
patient who appears depressed or is
in the midst of a psychosocial crisis.
Probing for suicidal ideation and an
awareness of the risk factors can
help the physician evaluate the risk
of suicide. A patient at high risk
constitutes a medical emergency and
therefore requires immediate admis-
sion to hospital or at least an emer-
gency consultation. When the risk

Intravenous glucose and/or intramuscular glucagon.
An in vitro hemodialysis study, using C'4 timolol added to
human plasma or whole blood, showed that timolol was
readily dialyzed from these fluids.
It should be remembered that BLOCADREN* is a competitive
antagonist of isoproterenol and hence large doses of iso-
proterenol can be expected to reverse many of the effects
of excessive doses of BL0CADREN*. However, the compli-
cations of excess isoproterenol, such as tachycardia,
headache,
nausea,
weakness, tremor and sweating, should not be overlooked.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
HYPERTENSiON
BLOCADREN* is usually used in conjunction with other
anti-hypertensive agents, particularly a thiazide diuretic,
but may be used alone (see INDICATIONS).
The dose must always be adjusted to
requirements of the patients,
following guidelines.
When BLOCADREN* is given to patients already receiving
other antihypertensive agents, the initial dose should be
S to 10mg twice a day. If after one to two weeks an adequate
response is not observed, dosage may be increased by
increments of 5 mg twice daily, at intervals of two weeks.
A 60 mg daily dose should not be exceeded.
When BLOCADREN* is used alone the initial dose should
be 10 mg twice a day and dosage increased if required,
following the regimen described above.
In those patients who are found to be adequately controlled
on daily doses of 20 mg or less, the administration of the
total dose in the morning should be tried as studies show
adequate response to thts dose regimen.
ANGINA
The recommended dosage range of BL0CADREN* is 15mg
to 45 mg per day. The majority of patients respond to a
daily dosage of 35 mg to 45 mg. Therapy should be
initiated with 5 mg two or three times a day. Depending
on response,
increases in dosage may be necessary.
The first increase should not exceed 10 mg per day in
divided doses. Subsequent increases should not exceed
15mg per day in divided doses. A total daily dose of 45mg
should not be exceeded. There should be an interval of at
lease three days between increases in dosage.
After the titration period, some patients may be maintained
on a bid. schedule.
PREVENTIVE USE IN SCHEMIC HEART DISEASE
For long-term preventive use in patients who have survived
the acute phase of myocardial infarction, the maintenance
dose is 10 mg twice daily. Therapy should be initiated
with 5 mg twice daily and the patient observed carefully.
If no adverse reaction occurs, the dosage should then be
increased after 2 days to 10 mg twice daily. In the studies
evaluating BLOCADREN* following myocardial infarction,
treatment was begun 7 to 28 days after the acute phase.
