Abstract

Objective—Self-harm is common and is of considerable public health concern. There is an 
ongoing debate regarding how self-harm should be classified. The aim of this study was to 
characterize associations between self-harm and impulsivity, including from the perspective of 
formal mental disorders and neuropsychological functioning.

Method—Total 333 adults (mean [SD] age 22.6 (3.6) years, 61% male) were recruited from the 
general community, and undertook detailed clinical and cognitive assessments. History of self-
harm was quantified using the Self-Harm Inventory (SHI), which asks about 22 self-harm 
behaviors (classic self-harm behaviors as well as broader types of behavior that may be relevant, 
such as engaging in emotionally abusive relationships). Principal components analysis was used to 
identify latent dimensions of self-harming behaviors. Relationships between self-harm dimensions 
and other measures were characterized using ordinary least squares regression.

Results—Principal Components Analysis yielded a three factor solution, corresponding to self-
injurious self-harm (e.g. cutting, overdoses, burning), interpersonal related self-harm (e.g. 
engaging in emotionally or sexually abusive relationships), and reckless self-harm (e.g. losing 
one’s job deliberately, driving recklessly, abusing alcohol). Regression modelling showed that all 
three dimensions of self-harm were associated with lower quality of life. Classic and interpersonal 
self-harm dimensions were associated with impulse control disorders (ICDs) whereas reckless 
self-harm was associated with other mainstream mental disorders besides ICDs. Only 
interpersonal self-harm was significantly associated with other impulsive measures ( less risk 
adjustment on the Cambridge Gambling Task).

Conclusions—This study suggests the existence of three distinct subtypes or ‘latent factors’ of 
self-harm: all three appear clinically important in that they are linked with worse quality of life. 
Clinicians should screen for impulse control disorders in people presenting with self-harm, 
especially when it is self-injurious or involves interpersonal harm. Our findings militate against

self-harm being broadly associated with impulsive personality and cognitive measures, at least in 
people recruited from a non-clinical / non-treatment setting. If future nosological revisions and 
treatment trials focus on self-injurious self-harm alone, they may overlook other aspects of self-
harm that are also functionally impairing.

Introduction

Self-harm can be defined as behaviors that are undertaken to damage oneself, irrespective of 
intention (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK, 2013). Some researchers 
distinguish non-suicidal self-injury from suicidal self-injury. Far from being limited only to 
people with formal mental disorders, self-harm behaviors – when defined broadly – are 
relatively frequent in the general population. Studies in community adolescent populations 
have reported lifetime prevalence of self-harm (broadly defined) to be up to 17% (Sansone 
& Sansone, 2010) while studies in child and adult clinical populations report rates as high as 
82.4% (Nock & Prinstein, 2004; Selby et al., 2012). Variation in lifetime prevalence of self-
harm likely reflects different operationalizations: broader definitions (including self-harm 
related thoughts as well as behaviors; Sansone & Sansone, 2010), through to relatively 
narrow/specific definitions (e.g. the concept of ‘Non-Suicidal Self Injury Disorder’; Selby et 
al., 2012). In a cross-sectional assessment of adolescents from 11 European countries 
(~12,000 participants), the overall lifetime prevalence of self-injurious behavior was 27.6% 
(Brunner et al., 2014). The public health importance of self-harm is considerable due to its 
association with increased risk of subsequent suicide (Hawton & Harriss, 2007).

Self-harm is listed explicitly amongst the diagnostic criteria for borderline personality 
disorder (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013), but is also associated with a 
range of other mental health disorders while not being listed amongst the diagnostic criteria. 
Self-harm is not unique to borderline personality disorder: elevated rates of self-harm have 
been found – for example – in depression, substance use (and substance use disorders), 
anxiety disorders and problem gambling (Hawton & Harriss, 2007; Sansone et al., 2013; 
Plener et al., 2015). Psychiatric disorders are exceedingly common among people who 
present to medical settings with self-harm. For example, in a sample of people who 
presented to a general hospital with self-harm, 92% had one or more underlying mental 
disorder, the most common types being mood, substance use, and anxiety disorders; co-
presentation with these disorders was more commonplace than co-presentation with 
personality disorder (Haw et al., 2001).

The issue is timely because self-harm, despite not being a new phenomenon, has now 
emerged as a candidate mental disorder for the first time. The Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual Version 5 (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) has highlighted ‘non-
suicidal self-injury’ (NSSI) as a condition in need of further study (Zetterqvist, 2015). Some 
argue that the evidence for this concept is questionable, due to the dichotomy between ‘non-
suicidal’ and ‘suicidal’ self-injury being invalid (Kapur et al., 2013). Also, because self-

harm occurs across a range of mental disorders, it may be better to consider whether distinct 
types of self-harm exist along a continuum, rather than categorically. Exploration of 
potential dimensions of self-harm, along with the relative strength of associations between 
dimensions of self-harm, mental disorders, and personality plus neuropsychological 
measures of impulsivity, is clinically important. Treatment trials for self-harm tend to focus 
on self-injury, but other types of self-harm may be important (such as engaging in 
emotionally abusive relationships, or driving recklessly). Identification of self-harm 
dimensions and clinical correlates could help to identify key targets for screening and 
intervention, and also potentially inform the debate about psychiatric screening in clinical 
practice. For example, in our experience, clinicians typically screen for mainstream mental 
disorders in people who present with self-harm, but may not screen for impulse control 
disorders.

One important concept of relevance to self-harm is ‘impulsivity’, which refers to actions that 
are unduly hasty, risky, and ultimately damaging to the individual (Daruna & Barnes, 1993). 
‘Impulsive’ self-harm is listed amongst the diagnostic criteria for borderline personality 
disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Some self-harm can be viewed as 
impulsive in that it can be risky and ultimately damaging, undertaken without forethought. 
Iimpulsivity can be explored in terms of overt behaviors (such as self-harm, or intake of 
substances), categorical mental disorders (such as presence or absence of attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], gambling disorder, substance use disorder), dimensional 
psychopathology (rates of ADHD-like symptoms, or problem gambling), or personality (e.g. 
the Barratt Impulsiveness Questionnaire). Impulsivity can also be measured using 
neuropsychological tests, such as in terms of failure to suppress pre-potent responses 
(response inhibition), or risky decision-making on gambling tasks (for example, preference 
for more immediate gratification to the detriment of longer-term outcomes) (Grant & 
Chamberlain, 2014).

Multiple studies have explored manifestations of different types of impulsivity in people 
with self-harm. In an online sample of 1350 university students, affective impulsivity – 
defined using latent modelling – was identified as a general risk factor for self-harm but this 
association was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for affective symptoms. 
Latent cognitive impulsivity did not show a significant relationship with self-harm in this 
study (Rawlings et al., 2015). In 181 people with suicidality presenting to the emergency 
department, surprisingly those with recent self-harm showed lower attentional impulsivity, 
on the Barratt Impulsivity Questionnaire, versus those without recent self-harm (Randall et 
al., 2014). In 64 adolescents with lifetime history of self-injury, versus 30 controls without 
such a history, those with history of self-injury scored higher on a self-report item asking 
whether they failed to think before acting, leading to getting into trouble (Janis & Nock, 
2009). However, groups did not differ significantly on impulsive errors (commission errors) 
on a continuous performance task, nor in terms of decision-making on the Iowa Gambling 
Task. The same authors also compared 20 adult women with recent self-injury versus 20 
controls on these neuropsychological tasks, plus a delay discounting task, and the Barratt 
Impulsivity Questionnaire (Janis & Nock, 2009). They found that people with recent self-
injury had significantly higher Barratt scores, but did not differ significantly from the 
controls on the neurocognitive tasks. In another study, 54 adolescents with a history of self-

harm did not differ significantly from controls (n=57) in terms of Iowa Gambling Task 
performance (Oldershaw et al., 2009). There was tentative evidence for relatively worse 
decision-making performance in people who recently self-harmed versus people who self-
harmed in the past, but the global task measure was not significant. In summary, available 
studies exploring impulsivity in people with a history of self-harm has yielded mixed results, 
with the majority of studies not reporting a clear cut positive relationship between self-harm 
(mostly self-injury) and impulsivity.

Potential limitations of existing studies exploring relationships between self-harm and 
different types of impulsivity included relatively small sample sizes, inclusion of some 
measurements of impulsivity but not others within a given study (especially failure to assess 
occurrence of impulse control disorders or ADHD), treating self-harm as a binary entity 
(rather than in terms of potential dimensions or subtypes), and use of cognitive tasks that 
may not fully have captured underlying cognitive dysfunction. For example, commission 
errors on continuous performance tasks do constitute a measure of impulsivity, but may be 
relatively insensitive to pathology compared to tasks that use dynamic tracking algorithms to 
estimate the ability of a given individual to suppress a ‘pre-potent’ response.

Aims of the study

To address the above limitations, we recruited a sample of non-treatment seeking adults and 
quantified a broad range of behaviors related to self-harm, using the 22 item Self-Harm 
Inventory (SHI) (Sansone & Sansone, 2010). We used Principal Components Analysis to 
identify latent dimensions of self-harm from the SHI, and explored the relationships between 
dimensions of self-harm behaviors and specific measures of impulsivity (impulse control 
disorders, personality measures, and cognition). These levels of impulsivity are 
complementary, capturing current symptomatology, predisposition (trait personality) as well 
as objective computerized measures linked to the integrity of fronto-striatal circuitry in the 
brain. We hypothesized that there would be two distinct subtypes of self-harm: classic ‘self-
injurious’ self-harm (such as cutting, burning, and taking overdoses), and self-harm 
potentially involving others (such as engaging in destructive relationships, deliberately 
losing one’s job, and driving recklessly). We hypothesized that both types of self-harm 
would be significantly and positively associated with impulsive symptoms (impulse control 
disorders), and impulsive cognitive functioning (risky decision-making on a gambling task, 
and stop-signal impairment on a stop-signal task).

2  Methods

2.1  Subjects

Three-hundred and thirty-three subjects aged 18-29 years were recruited using media 
advertisements in two major US cities (adverts in bulletin boards, newspapers, and flyers, 
asking for people to take part in a research study exploring impulsivity). Subjects were 
excluded if they were unable to understand and undertake the assessments. The only 
inclusion criterion, beyond age, was gambling at least occasionally (defined as five or more 
times in the preceding year); this criterion was used because the research was part of a 
broader project, funded to explore gambling behaviors in younger people. This approach

also allowed us to recruit a somewhat enriched sample with regards to impulsive tendencies. 
Prior to participation, a complete description of the study was provided, and individuals 
provided written informed consent.

2.2  Assessments

Subjects participated in detailed demographic, clinical and cognitive assessment. Self-harm 
was assessed using the previously validated Self-Harm Inventory (Sansone & Sansone, 
2010), which is a 22-item self-report questionnaire, covering a range of lifetime self-harm 
behaviors and thoughts. This inventory yields a total score out of 22, with higher scores 
being indicative of more serious self-harm. In previous work, a cut off of 5 or more was 
indicative of borderline personality disorder, and had good psychometric properties when 
compared to structured clinical interviews (Sansone & Sansone, 2010). The inventory also 
correlates significantly with healthcare utilization (Sansone et al., 2008), and compares 
favorably when viewed against other scales in terms of the range of thoughts/behaviors 
considered, psychometric properties, and ability to score over range of severities (Latimer et 
al., 2012).

Occurrence of psychiatric disorders was evaluated using the Mini International 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MINI) (Sheehan et al., 1998) and the Minnesota Impulse 
Disorder Inventory (MIDI) (Grant, 2008). The MINI identifies standard psychiatric disorders 
(e.g. depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive 
disorder) while the MIDI identifies impulse control disorders (kleptomania, compulsive 
sexual disorder, trichotillomania, intermittent explosive disorder, skin-picking disorder, 
compulsive buying disorder, pyromania, binge-eating disorder). The MINI has excellent 
psychometric properties including interrater reliability (majority of kappa values 0.9 or 
higher; Sheehan et al., 1998); the MIDI has excellent sensitivity and specificity (interrater 
reliability has not been assessed) (Grant et al., 2005).

The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS v1.1) was used to quantify ADHD 
symptomatology (Kessler et al., 2005), and the Structured Clinical Inventory for Gambling 
Disorder symptomatology (SCI-GD) (Grant et al., 2015). Cronbach’s alpha for the ASRS 
has been reported to be good-excellent (~0.88) while inter-rater reliability for the SCI-GD is 
excellent (overall Kappa close to 1) (Adler et al., 2006; Grant et al., 2004). Quality of life 
was quantified using the Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI; Cronbach’s alpha ~0.81) (Frisch 
& Cornell, 1993), self-esteem with the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (RSE; Cronbach’s 
alpha ~0.8) (Rosenberg, 1965), and emotional dysregulation with the Difficulties with 
Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Cronbach’s alpha 0.7-0.8) (Fowler et al., 2014). Self-
esteem is often low in people who self-harm, whereas difficulties with emotional regulation 
could contribute to self-harm by acting as a trigger. The Barratt Impulsiveness questionnaire 
was used to quantify impulsive personality traits (Cronbach’s alpha ~ 0.8; Patton et al., 
1995). Individuals were also asked about how often they consume alcohol (number of times 
alcohol consumed per week), and number of cigarette packs consumed per day (packs per 
day equivalent).

Cognitive testing was undertaken using two tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological 
Test Automated Battery (CANTABeclipse, version 3, Cambridge Cognition Ltd, UK), which

are particularly relevant for impulsivity. The Stop-Signal task was used to measure response 
inhibition, and the Cambridge Gambling test to measure different aspects of decision-
making. On the Stop-Signal task, a series of directional arrows were presented on the 
computer screen one per time, and volunteers made quick responses depending on the 
direction of arrows using a button box. Whenever a ‘stop-signal’ occurred (an auditory 
‘beep’), subjects attempted to inhibit/suppress their motor response for the given trial. By 
varying the time between presentation of the arrow and the stop-signal, the task calculated 
the stop-signal reaction time – a measure of time taken to suppress a response that would 
normally be made. The stop-signal reaction time is the key measure of inhibitory control 
(longer equals worse inhibitory control); median response times were also recorded (a 
measure of general response latency unrelated to inhibitory control).

On the Cambridge Gamble Task (CGT), ten boxes were shown per trial, some blue and some 
red, with a token having been hidden behind one of these. The participant selected the color 
of box they believed a token was hidden behind (blue or red), and then decided how many 
points to gamble. By sampling subjects’ gambling behaviors across a range of risk levels, 
the task provided overall scores relating to the proportion of points gambled, the proportion 
of points when a rational color choice was made, and the extent to which subjects changed 
amount gambled depending on risk (risk adjustment).

2.3  Statistical approach

Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22. All available data were entered into the 
statistical analyses. SHI items were entered into Principal Components Analysis (PCA), 
using Varimax rotation, to identify latent subtypes of self-harm (latent factors); the optimal 
model was selected based on inspection of the Scree Plot. Latent factor scores for each 
participant were extracted using method ‘regression’. Linear regression was then used to 
examine whether the following clinical (including impulsive) measures were significantly 
associated with latent factors: age, gender, presence of one or more MINI mental disorders, 
presence of one or more MIDI mental disorders, Barratt Impulsiveness total score, quality of 
life, difficulties with emotional regulation (DERS) total score, Rosenberg Self-Esteem 
Inventory (RSI) total score ASRS total score (Part A), Stop-Signal Reaction Times (SSRTs), 
quality of decision-making, and overall proportion of points gambled. For regression, the 
stepwise method of variable entry was used, which follows an iterative process of adding 
and removing variables in order to arrive at a model of best fit. This approach was preferred 
in view of the possibility of independent variables correlating with each other. To assess for 
model assumptions, we examined collinearity statistics (variance inflation factor), condition 
index for model dimensions, Durbin-Watson, and whether distributions of residuals 
conformed to normal distributions. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05 two-tailed.

3  Results

An overview of the demographic, clinical, and cognitive characteristics of the total sample is 
given in Table 1. The mean (standard deviation, SD) Self-harm Inventory total score in the 
sample was 1.64 (2.45), range 0-16 (maximum possible 22). The distribution of total scores 
is indicated in Supplementary Online Figure 1. 52.9% of individuals endorsed non-zero

scores on the instrument. Across the sample, 10.5% had total Self-Harm Inventory scores of 
five or more, which would be indicative of borderline personality disorder. The percentage 
of the sample endorsing the different items of the Self-Harm inventory are shown in Figure 
1. The top-five most commonly endorsed types of self-harm were (in order of descending 
frequency) abusing alcohol, being promiscuous, engaging in emotionally abusive 
relationships, driving recklessly, and cutting one’s self. In people without any identified 
mental disorders (N=193), the mean self-harm score was 1.08 (1.75), range 0-9, and 48% of 
these individuals with no identified mental disorders endorsed a history of self-harm.

The scree plot from the Principal Component Analysis across all SHI items is shown in 
Figure 2, inspection of which yielded a three factor solution, which accounted for 35% of 
the variance. The loading of individual SHI items on each factor is shown in Table 2; it can 
be seen that factor 1 related to classic measures of self-harm (e.g. burning, overdose, cutting) 
and therefore was labelled “classic self-harm”; factor 2 related mostly to interpersonal 
dynamics (e.g. engaging in emotionally abusive relationships) and was labelled 
“interpersonal self-harm”; and factor 3 related mainly to reckless behavior (e.g. driving 
recklessly, abusing alcohol, or losing a job deliberately), and so was referred to as “reckless 
self-harm”.

Regression yielded a statistically significant model for classical self-harm (ANOVA 
F=8.011, p<0.001; R square = 0.048). Higher classic self-harm was predicted by lower 
quality of life (standardized beta=-0.164, t=-2.934, p=0.004) and by higher occurrence of 
one or more impulse control disorders (standardized beta=0.117, t=2.095, p=0.037). The 
beta for the model constant was 0.559. Regression also yielded a statistically significant 
model for interpersonal self-harm (F=14.022, p<0.001; R square = 0.118). Higher 
interpersonal self-harm was predicted by lower quality of life (standardized beta = -0.207, 
t=-3.789, p<0.001), higher occurrence of one or more impulse control disorders 
(standardized beta = 0.165, t=3.041, p=0.003), and by less risk adjustment on the Cambridge 
Gamble Task (standardized beta = -0.143, t=-2.670, p=0.008). The beta for the model 
constant was 0.867. The regression model for reckless self-harm was also significant 
(F=15.086, p<0.001; R square = 0.087). Higher reckless self-harm was predicted by and by 
lower quality of life (standardized beta=-0.128, t=-2.278, p=0.023) and by occurrence of one 
or more MINI mental disorders (standardized beta=0.231, t=4.114, p<0.001). The beta for 
the constant term was 0.290.

4  Discussion

This study explored potential latent dimensions of self-harm (candidate subtypes) in non-
treatment seeking young adults, using an instrument assessing a broad range of behaviors 
(22 behaviors). We also incorporated a broad range of impulsive measures, including 
relating to occurrence of psychiatric disorders, personality, and cognition. The mean total 
self-harm score of our sample was 1.64 (standard deviation 2.45), which is reasonably 
comparable to the mean score of 2.3 (2.5) reported in a previous sample of control 
participants recruited from a variety of medical settings (Sansone et al., 1998). Principal 
Components Analysis identified three underlying dimensions of self-harm: self-injurious, 
interpersonal, and reckless self-harm respectively. Higher scores on all three dimensions of

self-harm were individually associated with lower quality of life. Only interpersonal self-
harm was significantly associated with neuropsychological abnormalities, namely less 
adjustment as a function of risk on the decision-making task. Self-injurious and 
interpersonal self-harm were associated with higher risk of one or more impulse control 
disorders (ICDs), whereas reckless self-harm was associated with other mental disorders 
besides ICDs.

Lower quality of life emerged as a significant statistical predictor for all three dimensions of 
self-harm, indicating the likely untoward cumulative clinical impact of self-harm. The raw 
mean quality of life t-score was 49.4 in those with no history of self-harm, which is in the 
mid-normal quality of life range versus normative data (Frisch & Cornell, 1993). A raw self-
harm score of two or more was sufficient to bring the mean quality of life down to 43.0 or 
below (poor quality of life), while a raw mean score of six or more was sufficient to bring 
mean quality of life down to 37.0 or below (very low quality of life). These findings 
highlight the particularly strong relationship between self-harm and worse quality of life, 
emphasizing the need to detect and treat self-harm early on. Our data indicate that 
interventions capable of stemming the development of new or additional forms of self-harm 
are likely to have knock on benefits for quality of life. Most self-harm research to date has 
focused mainly on self-injurious behaviors: our findings suggest that studying other aspects 
of self-harm in the same setting may be clinically valuable, because these too are linked with 
worse quality of life.

Higher self-injurious and interpersonal self-harm scores were significantly associated with 
having one or more impulse control disorders (ICDs, measured using the MIDI), whereas 
higher reckless self-harm was not. At the same time, higher reckless self-harm scores were 
associated with having one or more mainstream mental disorders besides ICDs, whereas 
higher self-injurious and interpersonal self-harm scores were not. In our experience, 
clinicians tend to screen for mainstream mental disorders (e.g. depression, alcohol use 
disorder; MINI) in people presenting with self-harm, but ICDs tend to be overlooked. Our 
finding that ICDs were more predictive of dimensions of self-injurious and interpersonal 
self-harm than mainstream mental disorders highlights the importance of careful screening 
for these conditions in clinical practice. It is surprising that self-injurious self-harm was not 
significantly associated with mainstream mental disorders; however, this may just reflect a 
stronger relationship with other types of self-harm, which would potentially wash out this 
association due to the data approach treating the three types of self-harm as being 
orthogonal. We did not identify a significant relationship between the three self-harm 
dimensions and ADHD symptom total scores (ADHD is not assessed by the MIDI). In a 
systematic review, ADHD was found to be a risk factor for self-harm (Allely, 2014). This 
discrepancy may be due to our method of assessing ADHD symptoms, which relied on a 
self-report instrument rather than involving the type of detailed psychiatric assessment 
necessary for confirming such a diagnosis.

It is potentially informative to consider these results alongside previous research findings. 
When a cross-sectional assessment of adolescents from 11 European countries was 
undertaken, comprising ~12,000 individuals, depression and anxiety were found to be 
significantly associated with self-harm (Brunner et al., 2014). In internal medicine

outpatients, self-harm scores correlated significantly with externalized aggressive behavior 
(Sansone et al., 2013). Across studies, researchers have highlighted higher scores of 
depression as having an association with self-harm, along with alcohol/drug use (Plener et 
al., 2015). There was a positive relationship between self-harm and both alcohol and 
nicotine consumption in college students (Andersson et al., 2013), while a sample of 20,000 
young adults followed longitudinally found that high alcohol use was a particularly strong 
risk factor for engaging in repeated self-harm (Martiniuk et al., 2015). Using data from the 
US National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), self-
harm was significantly associated with various forms of psychopathologies, substance use 
disorders, and violent behaviors (Vaughn et al., 2015). Research also suggests that self-harm 
is increased in the context of impulse control disorders such as intermittent explosive 
disorder, especially when comorbid with personality disorders (Jenkins et al., 2015).

Contrary to our a priori expectations, we did not generally identify any significant 
associations between self-harm and Barratt impulsiveness scores nor between self-harm and 
performance on the Stop-Signal and Cambridge Gamble Tasks. The only exception to this 
was that less risk adjustment on the Cambridge Gamble Task was associated with higher 
scores on the interpersonal self-harm dimension. Barratt impulsiveness was previously found 
to be significantly elevated in individuals with a history of self-harm (e.g. Janis & Nock, 
2009). Reasons for the discrepancy from the current findings are unclear; one possibility is 
that the relationship between self-harm and Barratt impulsiveness is lost when variation in 
other parameters is controlled for (as was the case using the current statistical approach). It 
also remains possible that there is a relationship between self-harm and Barratt 
impulsiveness, but that it is subtle or with relatively small effect size, as compared to the 
impact of other variables such as occurrence of mental disorders.

Multiple previous studies have found no significant decision-making abnormalities in people 
with a history of self-harm versus controls, using the Iowa Gambling test (Janis & Nock, 
2009; Oldershaw et al., 2009; McCloskey et al., 2012). The Iowa Gambling test is 
conceptually related to the Cambridge Gamble Task, although the latter seeks to decompose 
different aspects of decision-making and is less contingent on trial-by-trial learning. In 
previous work, self-harm was not associated with increased errors of commission on a 
continuous performance task, which is conceptually related to the Stop-Signal Task; nor was 
self-harm associated with abnormalities in delay discounting (another type of impulsivity, 
arguably only indirectly captured by the tasks we used herein) (Janis & Nock, 2009). Three 
prior studies exploring Stop-Signal Task performance in people who self-harm found no 
significant deficits versus controls overall (Glenn & Klonsky, 2010; Fikke et al., 2011; Allen 
& Hooley, 2015). Interestingly, the Allen & Hooley study (2015) found that inhibitory 
control was impacted by emotional valence of stimuli: self-injuring individuals showed 
worse inhibition relating to images with negative emotional content, and better than 
expected inhibition relating to images that were self-harm related. Our data confirm that 
self-harm does not appear to be associated with generalized impairment in decision-making 
or response inhibition, except for less risk-adjustment being linked with higher interpersonal 
self-harm.

Limitations

Page 10

Several potential limitations should be considered regarding the current study. Our statistical 
approach means that more subtle relationships between clinical variables and self-harm 
dimensions (small effect sizes) may have been overlooked, in view of the sample size. 
Ideally the findings would in future be replicated in a larger sample. Our study cannot 
demonstrate causality between variables. We did not measure all possible cognitive domains 
germane to impulsivity – for example, we did not measure delay discounting directly. The 
statistical approach allowed for those variables most robustly associated with self-harm 
scores to be identified; lack of significant association does not necessarily mean that a given 
variable is not relevant when attempting to understand self-harm – for example, subtler 
relationships with small effect size may have been overlooked. While we screened for 
antisocial personality disorder (part of the MINI assessment) and borderline personality 
disorder (inferred using total Self-Harm Inventory score of 5 or more), we did not screen for 
other personality disorders in this study. Because we conducted our study in non-treatment 
seeking adults aged 18-29 years, it remains to be confirmed whether the findings generalize 
to other settings. Lastly, we identified underlying dimensions of self-harm using a broad 
instrument capturing 22 types of behavior; our definition of self-harm is thus very distinct 
from the typical definitions used in the literature, such as the concept of ‘non-suicidal self-
injury [NSSI] disorder’, listed as a disorder in need of further research in DSM-5, which is 
narrower in scope and therefore may be more valuable clinically (Nock, 2009). Future work 
could evaluate relationships between NSSI disorder and self-harm scores on the Self Harm 
Inventory.

Summary and implications

Self-harm deserves research and clinical attention due to the significant association, found 
here, with lower quality of life. We propose that focusing only on self-injurious self-harm, as 
much existing literature discussed above has done, may overlook important treatment targets 
– our data suggest the existence of three latent dimensions of self-harm: self-injurious, 
interpersonal, and reckless types. Given that self-harm cuts across a multitude of disorders, 
we recommend that objective measures of self-harm be included in clinical trials in general, 
to address whether (for example) treating depression that includes self-harm results in 
improvement in both symptom types; and if so, which subtype of self-harm is improved. The 
lack of significant association between self-harm, select impulsive neurocognitive deficits, 
and Barratt impulsiveness scores militates against self-harm, operationalized in broad terms, 
representing a discrete ‘disorder of impulsivity’ in its own right. Nonetheless, clinicians 
should be careful to screen for impulse control disorders, as well as mainstream mental 
disorders, when evaluating individuals with self-harm. More research is needed to study 
whether risk of repeat self-harm, or worsening of self-harm, can be mitigated by 
interventions with a view to maximizing affected individuals’ quality of life. Another key 
area of investigation is into the validity and utility of narrower clinical definitions of self-
harm disorders, such as the DSM-5 concept of ‘non-suicidal self-injury [NSSI] disorder’. 
This diagnostic label focuses on self-injury whereas other aspects of self-harm (besides self-
injury) are also likely to be clinically impairing, based on our findings. Future work could 
also utilize other data analytic approaches than were used here, such as network modelling, 
or latent variable analysis with structural modelling.
