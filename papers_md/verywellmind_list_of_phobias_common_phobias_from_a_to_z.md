- Types of Phobias

- Common vs. Rare Phobias

A phobia is an anxiety disorder involving excessive and persistent fear of a situation or object. Exposure to the source of the fear triggers an immediate anxiety response.

Phobiasare one of the most commonmental illnessesin the United States. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIH), approximately 12.5% of adults in the U.S. will deal with a specific phobia in their lifetime.

Some are more common (think arachnophobia or claustrophobia), while some are much more rare (aka fear of vacuum cleaners). They also tend to fall into one of three groups: social phobia, agoraphobia, and specific phobias.

When looking at a list of common phobias, you'll probably notice that many of the specific phobias involve a fear of the natural environment, animals, medical treatments, or specific situations.

Women are more likely to experience phobias than men. Typical symptoms of phobias can include nausea, trembling, rapid heartbeat, feelings of unreality, and being preoccupied with the fear object. Phobias can be debilitating, but they are also very treatable. It's important to talk to your doctor about treatments that can help.


## Types of Phobias


The American Psychiatric Association (APA) identifies three different categories of phobias:

- Social phobias: Now known as social anxiety disorder, this phobia is marked by a fear of social situations in which a person might be judged or embarrassed.

- Agoraphobia: This phobia involves an irrational and extreme fear of being in places where escape is difficult. It may involve a fear of crowded places or even of leaving one's home.

- Specific phobias: When people talk about having a phobia of a specific object such as snakes, spiders, or needles, they are referring to aspecific phobia.

While not comprehensive, this list of phobias offers a glimpse of themany phobiasthat can have a serious impact on a person's life. As you may notice while you browse through this list, most specific phobias fall into one of four major categories:

- Fears of the natural environment

- Fears related to animals

- Fear related to medical treatments or issues

- Fears related to specific situations

One important thing to remember is that virtually any object can become a fear object. The names of specific phobias are often formed as nonce words, or words coined for a single occasion only.

These names themselves are often formed by taking a Greek prefix that represents the fear object and adding the -phobia suffix. Because of this, any attempt at a completely exhaustive list of phobias would be a futile exercise. Any list of phobias could grow with the addition of newly coined terms for previously unnamed specific phobias.

While listing all of the phobias that may exist is not possible, it can be helpful to look through a list of some of the more commonly described phobias. As you can see by looking at this list, almost any object or situation can become the source of fear.


## Symptoms of Phobias


Phobias lead to physical, emotional, and behavioral symptoms. Common symptoms include:

- Chest tightness or pain

- Chills or hot flashes

- Choking sensations

- Difficulty breathing

- Increased blood pressure

- Racing heartbeat

- Shaking or trembling

In addition to these physical symptoms, people may experience dread, a sense of impending doom, fear of losing control, or even the feeling that death is imminent. To avoid such feelings, people with phobias may avoid any situation where they might potentially encounter the source of their fear.


## What Causes Phobias?


The exact causes of phobias are not known, but a combination of factors likely plays a part. Some factors that increase the risk of developing a phobia include:

- Genetics: People with a close family member with a phobia or another anxiety disorder also have a greater risk of a phobia.It is important to note, however, that people who don't have family members with the condition still develop phobias.

- Traumatic experiences: A difficult, stressful, ortraumatic experiencecan also trigger the onset of a phobia. For example, being bitten by a dog as a child might trigger a fear of dogs in adulthood.

Some factors may increase your risk of developing a specific phobia. Women are more likely to develop specific phobias than men. People with certain mental health conditions, including depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more likely to have a specific phobia.


## Common vs. Rare Phobias


Some phobias are more common, while others are often quite rare. Five of the most common phobias include arachnophobia (the fear of spiders), ophidiophobia (the fear of snakes), glossophobia (the fear of public speaking), acrophobia (the fear of heights), andsocial phobia(the fear of social interactions).

The fear of public speaking is so common that some researchers have estimated that as much as 77% of people have some level of this fear.

Rare phobiasmay be novel terms coined to identify a single, unique case or fear that occur quite infrequently. Some different rare specific phobias includespectrophobia(the fear of mirrors),chiclephobia(the fear of chewing gum), andhippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia(the fear of long words).


## Treatment for Phobias


While phobias can be distressing and create disruptions in your life, they are treatable. Some of the different treatment options includetherapyand medication.


### Exposure Therapy


Exposure-based treatmentsare the first-line approach in the treatment of phobias. In this type of treatment, you are gradually and progressively exposed to what you fear. You might start by just thinking about your phobia trigger and then move slowly toward looking at images of the object and finally being near the object in real life.

Types of exposure-based treatments that may be used include:

- In vivo exposure: This involves being exposed to the source of your fear in real life.

- Virtual exposure: This involves the use of virtual reality to practice gradual exposure.

- Systematic desensitization: This involves being gradually exposed until you become desensitized to the source of your fear.

During this process, you'll also practice relaxation techniques to help calm your body when your fear response kicks in.


### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy


Often referred to as CBT,cognitive behaviorial therapyinvolves learning to identify the underlying negative thoughts that contribute to feelings of fear. Once you become better at noticing these thoughts, you can then work on replacing them with more positive, helpful thoughts.


### Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing


Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapyutilizes rhythmic eye movements to help people process and recover from traumatic experiences. It is frequently used in the treatment ofpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but can also be effective in the treatment of a variety of other mental health conditions including phobias.

Medications may be prescribed in some cases to help manage some of the symptoms you might be experiencing as a result of your phobia. Medications your doctor might prescribe includeselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), beta-blockers, and anti-anxiety drugs.

Phobias can have a serious impact on well-being, but it is important to remember that you are not alone. Phobias are common and treatable.If you believe that you have the symptoms of some type of phobia, consult a doctor for further evaluation and treatment advice.
