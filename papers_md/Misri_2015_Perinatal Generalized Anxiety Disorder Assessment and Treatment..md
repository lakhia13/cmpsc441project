Perinatal Generalized Anxiety Disorder:
Assessment and Treatment

Shaila Misri, MD,1–4 Jasmin Abizadeh, BA,1,3 Shawn Sanders,1,3 and Elena Swift, MRes1,3

Abstract

Perinatal generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has a high prevalence of 8.5%–10.5% during pregnancy and
4.4%–10.8% postpartum. Despite its attendant dysfunction in the patient, this potentially debilitating mental
health condition is often underdiagnosed. This overview will provide guidance for clinicians in making timely
diagnosis and managing symptoms appropriately. A signiﬁcant barrier to the diagnosis of GAD in the perinatal
population is difﬁculty in distinguishing normal versus pathological worry. Because a perinatal-speciﬁc
screening tool for GAD is nonexistent, early identiﬁcation, diagnosis and treatment is often compromised. The
resultant maternal dysfunction can potentially impact mother–infant bonding and inﬂuence neurodevelop-
mental outcomes in the children. Comorbid occurrence of GAD and major depressive disorder changes the
illness course and its treatment outcome. Psychoeducation is a key component in overcoming denial/stigma
and facilitating successful intervention. Treatment strategies are contingent upon illness severity. Cognitive
behavior therapy (CBT), relaxation, and mindfulness therapy are indicated for mild GAD. Moderate/severe
illness requires pharmacotherapy and CBT, individually or in combination. No psychotropic medications are
approved by the FDA or Health Canada in pregnancy or the postpartum; off-label pharmacological treatment is
instituted only if the beneﬁt of therapy outweighs its risk. SSRIs/SNRIs are the ﬁrst-line treatment for anxiety
disorders due to data supporting their efﬁcacy and overall favorable side effect proﬁle. Benzodiazepines are an
option for short-term treatment. While research on atypical antipsychotics is evolving, some can be considered
for severe manifestations where the response to antidepressants or benzodiazepines has been insufﬁcient. A
case example will illustrate the onset, clinical course, and treatment strategies of GAD through pregnancy and
the postpartum.

Introduction

Prevalence of GAD

The nomenclature of generalized anxiety disorder

(GAD) has evolved since Freud ﬁrst described oc-
currence of chronic, free-ﬂoating anxiety1 over a century
ago. With the introduction of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition (DSM-III) in
1980, GAD became a clear psychiatric condition. Changes to
the classiﬁcation of GAD continued with updated empirical
evidence in DSM-IV-TR,2 which focused on the character-
istics of excessive and uncontrollable worry. In the DSM-5,3
the diagnostic criteria for GAD remained largely unchanged
with only minimal re-organization of some criteria. While
awareness of GAD in general population has increased
among clinicians, the illness has received little attention in
the perinatal population.

Prevalence of GAD during pregnancy varies between 8.5%
and 10.5%,4–6 which is as high as or higher than in the general
population (1.2% to 6.4%).7 However, in the postpartum period
there appears to be a greater variance in the reported prevalence
of GAD, between 4.4% and 10.8%.8–11 This difference in
rates is contingent on recruitment strategies, methodology, and
presence of a control group. Studies show subjects selected
from a hospital outpatient population display a higher rate of
GAD versus those from wide scale epidemiological surveys.

Although speciﬁc risk factors for development of perinatal
GAD have not been established, in clinical practice the dis-
ease appears to manifests in women who are excessive
worriers, have a positive family history of anxiety disorders,
and suffer from other anxiety or mood disorders.

PERINATAL GAD: ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT

763

Clinical Presentation in Perinatal Period

GAD is a clinical entity distinct from feelings of anxiety
associated with postpartum depression; GAD is characterized
by excessive, uncontrollable worry that can cause functional
impairment. Despite the frequent manifestation of GAD
during the perinatal period, the DSM speciﬁer ‘‘with peri-
partum onset’’ is presently designated only for mood disor-
ders, not for anxiety disorders.3 Applying the DSM-5 criteria
for the general population to pregnant/postpartum women
potentially excludes those consumed with excessive worries
for less than 6 months. Some researchers therefore deﬁne
perinatal GAD if the illness meets other DSM criteria for a
minimum duration of one month.5,10

Problematically for diagnosis, physical symptoms of GAD
such as fatigue, irritability, tension, concentration difﬁculties,
and insomnia may be mistaken as normal in pregnancy and
the postpartum. Distinguishing normal pregnancy-related
concerns from pathological worry, particularly in ﬁrst tri-
mester primiparous women, can also make diagnosing peri-
natal GAD difﬁcult.12 These worries become disabling if they
intrusive, and acquire a
are recurrent,
quality of irrationality. The general
themes of perinatal
worries revolve around: (1) fears of fetal wellbeing, (2) ma-
ternal wellness, (3) illness in the partner, and (4) parental
mortality. If these worry symptoms persist for an extended
period of time they can cause functional impairment in every
area of the mother’s life.

time-consuming,

Consequences of GAD in Mother and Infant

GAD speciﬁc studies in the perinatal population remain
sparse; however, several studies have addressed the impact of
anxiety symptoms not diagnosed as GAD.13–16

Stein and colleagues17 found that recurrent negative
thinking in mothers with GAD resulted in their being less
responsive and engaged in interactions with their infants. In
addition, these infants appeared to be withdrawn and were
more likely to display lowered emotional tone. In a study by
Arteche et al.,18 women suffering from postpartum depres-
sion or GAD were less likely to identify happy infant faces
accurately due to excessive maternal worry.

Women diagnosed with GAD at 10 weeks after child-
birth were found to report sexual fear, avoidance, and body
image self-consciousness compared with women without
the illness. This group of women was sensitive to experi-
encing distress but not dysfunction in their sexual rela-
tionships.19

Few studies have investigated the impact of maternal GAD
on short- and long-term child development outcome; the
available data suggests that maternal GAD negatively im-
pacts neurodevelopment and growth of the infant. Uguz and
colleagues20 found that maternal GAD during pregnancy led
to signiﬁcantly lower levels of fetal brain-derived neuro-
trophic factor potentially negatively impacting the neurode-
velopment of the fetus.

A recent meta-analysis and systematic review suggested
that there was a modest but statistically signiﬁcant associa-
tion between maternal anxiety during pregnancy and an in-
creased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight.21 The
occurrence of low birth weight and preterm birth has also
been found to be a risk factor in itself for the development of
GAD in later years.22

Several studies have shown a link between stress in utero
and adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in the neonatal period.
This correlation has been proposed to be a result of dysregu-
lation of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis of the mother and the
offspring.23 Although not speciﬁc to GAD, the relationship
between maternal anxiety/stress and its negative impact on
child development has been extensively studied. Consequences
include: negative infant behavioral reactivity at 4 months,13
difﬁcult infant temperament at 4/6 months,14 lower mental
development at age 2 years,15 negative affectivity at 2 years,16
lower inhibitory control
in girls, and lower visuospatial
working memory in boys and girls aged 6–9 years.24

Comorbidity with GAD During Pregnancy
and Postpartum

While coexistence of perinatal GAD with depression has
been well studied, its association with other anxiety disorders
and substance use disorders has limited data.

Grigoriadis and colleagues25 found a high comorbid
depression rate of 49.5% in perinatal women with GAD.
Comorbidity with other anxiety disorders included: OCD
(4.4%), agoraphobia (8.8%), panic disorder (9.9%), and
phobia (19.8%). In a study by Wenzel et al.26 75% of post-
partum women with GAD also met criteria for a depression.
A longitudinal study by Reck et al.27 supported the ob-
servation that women with anxiety disorders often display
accompanying symptoms of depression, and vice-versa.
Comorbidity between anxiety and depressive disorders result
in a more severe and protracted course of illness.28 In the
general population, anxiety disorders are considered signiﬁ-
cant risk factors for the onset of depressive disorders.29–31
Coelho et al.32 found that anxiety disorders in pregnancy
independently predicted a threefold increase in the develop-
ment of postpartum depression up to two years postpartum.
The sequential occurrence of GAD and depression through-
out the perinatal period follows an interesting pattern. While
antenatal GAD has been recognized to be a risk factor for
development of postpartum depression, this relationship ap-
pears to be bidirectional;33 midtrimester depression has also
been found to be related to anxiety in late pregnancy.34
Collectively,

women with anxiety disorders often display accompanying
symptoms of depression, and vice-versa.

these studies support

Arch35 found that pregnancy anxiety was the strongest
predictor of alcohol consumption in the antenatal period.
Speciﬁc domains of pregnancy anxiety that accounted for
elevated drinking risk were fears of bearing a handicapped
child and fears of pregnancy-related impact on one’s ap-
pearance.

Patient Engagement in Treatment Planning

Explaining to patients and their families that symptoms of
worry might represent an illness is not easy, as the patient
may experience disbelief, embarrassment, or shame related
to their emotional turmoil, while dysfunction resulting from
all-consuming worry means their insight into their suffering
is diminished. Untreated excessive worry over time can lead
the patient to be apprehensive of situations that produce
normal anxiety.36 One way in which patients cope is by in-
tensely focusing on controlling the external environment,
including the suggested treatment.

764

MISRI ET AL.

Managing GAD patients agreeing to treatment is often
complex due to the limited availability of accessible and
affordable psychotherapy resources. The use of medication in
pregnancy is at best controversial. The National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence has published an overview of
anxiety disorders in perinatal women and clinical manage-
ment and service guidelines for antenatal and postnatal
mental health, both including sections on GAD.37,38 Gen-
erally, the management plan is determined by consensual
agreement to treatment between the patient and the clinician.

Case Example of Perinatal GAD

Thirty-four year old Tiffany, a married teacher, was re-
ferred by her family doctor to the Reproductive Mental
Health Program at 18 weeks gestation with excessive, irra-
tional worry that occupied 80%–90% of her time almost
every day, with varying intensity. Her worries focused on: (1)
the baby’s development, (2) birth-related fear, (3) her ability
to mother. Additional symptoms included increased irrita-
bility, restlessness, and fatigue; she met the DSM-5 criteria
for GAD.

During her ﬁrst pregnancy with Jack, her 18-month-old
toddler, Tiffany received four sessions of cognitive behav-
ioral therapy (CBT) for illogical worries with regard to Jack’s
welfare. After birth, a trial of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor (SSRI) resulted in remission of GAD. She dis-
continued medication after conceiving unexpectedly; her
worries gradually resurfaced.

Follow-Up of the Case Study

Tiffany was assessed by a psychiatrist and administered
the GAD-7 and conﬁrmed the diagnosis of GAD in second
pregnancy. Tiffany struggled with the idea of worries be-
ing diagnosed as an illness. At a follow-up appointment
with her husband Mark 2 weeks later, the challenges and
struggles of Tiffany became clearer. High irritability, short
fuse, and lack of patience resulted in frequent arguments
between the couple; her interactions with Jack became a
concern.

After discussing treatment options with Mark and Tif-
fany, the couple opted to seek CBT from a Psychologist
rather than restart medication during pregnancy because of
worries about potential adverse effects on the growing fetus.
The CBT helped her cope fairly well through the pregnancy.
The birth was uneventful with delivery of a healthy, 8-pound
newborn.

In the postpartum period, one month later, symptoms of
excessive worry returned accompanied by depressive mood.
At three months postpartum, Tiffany could no longer nurse;
the symptoms continued to escalate. She began an antide-
pressant trial combined with the CBT sessions, which led to
full remission of mood symptoms, though she continued to
experience manageable levels of anxiety.

Diagnosing and Screening for GAD
During Pregnancy and Postpartum

Speciﬁc screening tools to diagnose perinatal GAD do not
appear to exist.39 The most commonly validated subjective
measures in perinatal population are the General Health
Questionnaire,40 State-Trait Anxiety Inventory,41 and the

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales42 and GAD-7.43
Other screening measures for non-GAD anxiety include the
Postpartum Worry Scale,10 the Pregnancy Anxiety Scale,44
and the Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale.45 In clinical
practice, healthcare providers rely on a diagnostic interview
and available anxiety tools for conﬁrming the diagnosis.
Although the GAD-743 is not validated for perinatal popu-
lation, this screening tool appears to capture the symptom-
atology and severity of the illness in pregnant and postpartum
mothers. We recommend antenatal GAD screening around
28–30 weeks, when depression screening is often done rou-
tinely. A repeat screening with GAD-7 can be undertaken at
6-8 weeks postpartum, at a standard postpartum visit. An
algorithm for evaluating and treating GAD is presented in
Figure 1.

Pharmacological Treatment of Perinatal Generalized
Anxiety Disorder

Cognitive-behavioral therapies are the ﬁrst-line choice
for the treatment of mild to moderate perinatal GAD. How-
ever, in moderate to severe cases, pharmacological treat-
ment should be considered. While medication treatments
have potential risks, they must be weighed against the risks of
untreated maternal anxiety and its consequences for the de-
veloping infant.

Possible risks associated with pharmacotherapy in the
perinatal period include spontaneous abortion, major fetal
malformations, acute neonatal toxicity, long-term neurobe-
havioral effects, and drug transmission to the infant via breast
milk.46 For these reasons, health care practitioners must take
particular care to prescribe those medications believed to
have an appropriate safety proﬁle for use in pregnant and
lactating women. Pharmacotherapy in the perinatal period
should favor medications with the least transmission across
the placenta and with minimal active metabolites.47 Doses
should begin as low as possible and should be titrated upward
as necessary. Monotherapy is preferred if possible. Sudden
discontinuation should be avoided.

Antidepressants

This class of medication has not been rigorously tested in
the peripartum population with controlled studies, for ethical
and practical reasons; extant data are primarily based on
retrospective case studies, or other observational or population-
based research. SSRIs are the most frequently used class of
antidepressant medications in general and during pregnan-
cy.48 Their use in nursing mothers is more frequent compared
to other antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants and mono-
amine oxidase inhibitors are not generally prescribed, pri-
marily because of their less favorable side-effect proﬁle.49

Research in the perinatal population suggests that SSRIs and
serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) cross the
placenta, with 70%–86% of the maternal dosage being trans-
ferred to the infant.50 Several reviews and meta-analyses have
not found compelling evidence that SSRI/SNRIs as a class
are generally associated with birth defects.51–43 The excep-
tion is ﬁrst-trimester exposure to paroxetine, which has been
correlated with cardiac malformations,54 although a direct
causal relationship has not been established. Some researchers
suggest that risk increases only at high dosage,55 while others
have found no relationship between paroxetine use during

pregnancy and congenital malformation.56 In light of conﬂicting
data, our recommendation is to avoid paroxetine exposure in
women planning pregnancies. There are also accounts of other
SSRI-related malformations such as hypertrophic stenosis,
omphalocele, and neural tube defects, although evidence is
limited.57,58 There have been small but signiﬁcant associations
between the use of SSRI/SNRIs and spontaneous abortions, as
well as shorter gestational age, preterm delivery, and lower
APGAR scores in neonates.59–61 Additionally, an increased risk
of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn has been
associated with third trimester SSRI/SNRI exposure;62 the ab-
solute risk, however, is small—3 to 4 cases per thousand.63
Third trimester exposure has been related to neonatal with-
drawal symptoms, such as jitteriness, irritability, tremulousness,

difﬁculty feeding, difﬁculty sleeping, hypertonia, and other
adverse symptoms such as seizures. These withdrawal effects
are common, appearing in 30% of infants exposed to SSRIs, but
they are generally mild, transient, and self-limiting.64 They
appear to be particularly associated with the use of paroxetine.65
It is worth noting that in many cases, these correlations be-
tween SSRI/SNRI usage and adverse effects are confounded by
underlying maternal depression, thereby precluding any ﬁrm
causal conclusions from being drawn. For example, SSRI/
SNRI use is associated with an increased rate of preterm birth;
however, there is evidence that preterm birth rates are equiva-
lently elevated in women with untreated depression, suggesting
that underlying depression, and not SSRI/SNRI exposure, may
ultimately be responsible for the observed association.66

766

MISRI ET AL.

The current data do not, on the whole, suggest that SSRI/
SNRIs are related to negative long-term neurobehavioral
effects; children exposed to antidepressants have not con-
sistently been found to differ on cognitive, motor, or be-
havioral outcomes relative to nonexposed controls.67–69
Recently, some investigations have found an association
between autism and prenatal antidepressant exposure,70,71
while other large-scale studies have failed to detect such a
connection.72,73 Further research into this correlation is
needed.

The use of SSRI/SNRIs during breastfeeding also requires
careful consideration. Infant exposure to SSRIs via breast
milk has generally been associated with low or negligible
levels of compounds in infant serum;74 mild transient
symptoms after breastfeeding have been reported, but only in
isolated case studies.75 Of the SSRI/SNRIs, sertraline is
preferred for breast-feeding women, as it has a low milk/
plasma ratio and relative infant dose.76 Similarly, paroxetine
has a very low milk/plasma ratio; preliminary data also
suggest that escitalopram has a low relative infant dose and is
largely undetectable in the infant after feeding.77

Overall, treatment of perinatal GAD with SSRI/SNRIs
should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Patients with
prior history of SSRI/SNRI intake should continue on the
drug they have been taking in order to reduce the probability
of relapse, with the exception perhaps of paroxetine, due to
the potential cardiac risks to the fetus. For those women be-
ginning pharmacological treatment for the ﬁrst time, an
SSRI/SNRI with evidence for efﬁcacy in GAD should be
chosen. In addition, preference among these may be based on
which possess a short half-life, a low accumulation in breast
milk, a track record of safety in pregnancy, and a low ratio of
cord to serum drug concentration.

Benzodiazepines

The class of benzodiazepines is among the most com-
monly used prescription drug among pregnant women.77
They appear effective at rapidly treating short-term anxiety,
particularly its somatic symptoms.78 Because antidepressants
require several weeks before the onset of their action, ben-
zodiazepines can be used for brief, pro re nata treatment in
order to produce an immediate anxiolytic response. Despite
their usefulness, there is serious concern about cognitive
impairment with long-term use of benzodiazepines.79 Ex-
tended use of this class of drug is associated with a substantial
risk of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse.80,81

In pregnant women, with regard to teratogenicity, earlier
studies of benzodiazepines tend to report an association with
oral clefts;82 however, later research generally failed to ﬁnd
this association.83 Their use in pregnancy can elevate the risk
of neonatal withdrawal symptoms such as hypertonia, hy-
perreﬂexia, tremors, bradycardia, and sleep disturbance.84,85
Third trimester exposure has also been associated with the
‘‘ﬂoppy infant syndrome,’’ characterized by low APGAR
scores, hypothermia, muscular hypotonia, and sluggish re-
sponse to cold temperatures.37,85 Because of these risks,
benzodiazepines should be particularly avoided in the third
trimester. Lorazepam may be favored over other benzodi-
azepines due to its low accumulation in fetal tissue.47 Ex-
cretion of benzodiazepines in breast milk appears to be low in
general;37 however, one should consider avoiding diazepam

due to its active metabolites and long-lived presence in breast
milk.86,87

Atypical antipsychotics

This class of medication is generally not used as a primary
modality of treatment for GAD. In nonperinatal population,
these medications are prescribed to augment other pharma-
cologic agents for severe forms of the illness when response
to other types of pharmacotherapy has been insufﬁcient.
While meta-analyses do not support augmentation for GAD
with olanzapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone,81 in prelimi-
nary studies, newer atypicals such as quetiapine and ar-
ipiprazole seem to show promise.88,89 Side effects related to
atypical antipsychotics include extrapyramidal symptoms,
weight gain, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and a prolonged QTc
interval.90

Research into the perinatal use of newer antipsychotics is
so far conﬁned to case studies. Atypical antipsychotics have
been associated with an increased probability of therapeutic
abortions as well as low neonatal birth weight.91 In one
study, atypical antipsychotic usage has been linked to an
increased risk of congenital malformation, gestational dia-
betes, and caesarean section delivery.92 No long-term studies
track the effects of atypical antipsychotics on infant neuro-
development.93

Nonpharmacological Treatment Options

Psychotherapeutic approaches to GAD are vital in target-
ing cognitive processes underlying the excessive generalized
worrying that debilitate the sufferer. The goal of psycho-
therapy in perinatal women with GAD is to reduce the overall
level of autonomic arousal, lessen the mother’s concern over
her worries, and provide support in reducing her worries to a
more reasonable level.

Limitations to accessing appropriate psychotherapy are
generally due to high cost of therapy. In addition, it is difﬁcult
to ﬁnd a trained therapist who specializes in perinatal mental
health. In general, pregnant women tend to prefer treatment
with psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy, as pharmaco-
logical agents usually add another layer of worry for the
mother.94,95 In one study, preference for psychotherapy alone
was stronger among pregnant (74%) than nonpregnant (47%)
women; both groups of women rated exposure-based CBT
more favorably than pharmacotherapy.94

Cognitive behavioral therapy

CBT is a form of psychotherapy focused on changing
maladaptive patterns of thinking and behavior. The effec-
tiveness of CBT in the treatment of anxiety disorders, and
especially GAD, has been well established in the general
population,96–98 with improvement rates estimated between
34% and 68%.99 A study showed that a group CBT inter-
vention for antenatal mothers with mild to moderate anxiety
symptoms resulted in signiﬁcantly decreased levels of anxi-
ety; the effect was sustained into the postpartum period.100
However, researchers have cautioned that CBT’s overall ef-
fects are still clinically modest; patients receiving CBT could
still require further treatment in order to reach remission.99
Despite evidence that CBT is promising, this treatment can be
difﬁcult to implement due to the lack of easy accessibility.

Mindfulness training

Based on meditation techniques, mindfulness training is
the practice of awareness and attention exercises focused on
accepting one’s present state of emotions, thoughts, and
physical sensations. During the perinatal period this has been
shown to signiﬁcantly reduce negative affect, state anxiety,
pregnancy-speciﬁc anxiety, and stress in nonclinical popu-
lations.101–103 An evaluation of group mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy for perinatal anxiety showed statistically
and clinically signiﬁcant improvements in anxiety, worry,
and depression, as well as a signiﬁcant increase in self-
compassion and mindfulness.104 Additionally, in this study
94% of women with GAD no longer met diagnostic criteria
posttreatment.

Relaxation techniques

Activites such as progressive muscle relaxation and dia-
phragmatic breathing are an integral part of many CBT-
oriented treatments for GAD.105 In a randomized controlled
trial (RCT), Bastani and colleagues106 showed that applied
relaxation training signiﬁcantly reduced anxiety and per-
ceived stress among pregnant women compared to those who
received routine prenatal care. In another RCT, guided im-
agery and progressive muscle relaxation was found to be
most effective in enhancing levels of relaxation and de-
creasing heart rate.107 Hoyer et al.108 compared worry ex-
posure with applied relaxation in the treatment of GAD and
results showed that the treatments were equally effective.
However, a recent meta-analysis indicated that CBT may be
more effective in treatment of GAD than applied relaxation.97

Psychoeducation

Psychoeducation provides information about both the
disorder and treatment rationale. This is often the most im-
portant initial intervention and frequently improves adher-
ence to treatment. It is inexpensive, easy to implement, and
can be applied immediately by any clinician.109 However,
because there is no objective measure of anxiety in preg-
nancy, clinicians often ﬁnd it challenging to engage a preg-
nant patient in psychoeducation, as women who have worried
their entire lives may not recognize their experience as
pathological. Furthermore, GAD can be hard to separate
from personality traits. Individuals who are perfectionistic
and highly persistent are more likely to have anxiety dis-
orders than mood disorders.110 These individuals are high
functioning, organized, and prefer to feel in control of their
surroundings.

Conclusion and Future Perspectives

Marce´ in 1858111 ﬁrst described psychological symptoms
in perinatal women in ‘‘Treatise on Insanity in Pregnant,
Postpartum, and Lactating Women.’’ Prior to the inclusion of
the postpartum onset speciﬁer in DSM-IV, clinicians strug-
gled to advocate for treatment and research related to peri-
natal women with mood disorders. Similarly, until peripartum
GAD is formally classiﬁed in the DSM, its status will remain
questionable. Without a deﬁned classiﬁcation of this condi-
tion, researchers are unable to investigate this illness in a
methodologically consistent way, and it may continue to be
under-recognized in clinical practice. This review attempts to

increase the awareness and knowledge of perinatal GAD to
the readership and to familiarize them to the unique aspects of
this challenging clinical disorder.
