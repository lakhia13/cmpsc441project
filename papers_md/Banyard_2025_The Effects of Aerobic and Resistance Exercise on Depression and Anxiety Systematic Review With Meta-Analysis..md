ABSTRACT
Exercise can reduce physiological and psychological symptoms associated with depression and anxiety. However, it is unknown 
which mode of exercise, if any, is more beneficial. To determine whether aerobic, resistance, or aerobic and resistance exercise 
improves depressive and/or anxiety symptoms in individuals diagnosed with depression or anxiety. Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Five electronic databases were searched, until 
February 24, 2024. Studies were included for analysis based on satisfying quality appraisal standards and the established inclu-
sion criteria associated with aerobic or resistance exercise in adults with a diagnosis of depression or anxiety. Random effects 
meta- analysis  was  performed  where  possible.  Thirty- two  randomised  controlled  trial  studies  (n = 3243  participants)  met  the 
inclusion criteria for this systematic review, and 26 studies (n = 2681 participants) were included in the meta- analyses. For the 
25 studies assessing the effect of exercise on depressive symptoms, the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) favoured 
exercise as a beneficial treatment of depression (−0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] −1.28 to −0.66), with a large magnitude of 
effect. For the 11 studies reporting the effect of exercise on anxiety symptoms, the pooled SMD results revealed that exercise had 
a significant, moderate magnitude of effect favouring exercise treatment (−0.66, 95% CI −1.09 to −0.23). No studies excessively 
influenced the outcomes of depression and anxiety. Aerobic, resistance, or a mixture of aerobic and resistance exercise is benefi-
cial for improving symptoms of depression and anxiety.

1   |   Introduction

Globally,  individuals  with  mental  illnesses  experience  a  sig-
nificantly reduced life expectancy compared to those without a 
diagnosed  mental  health  condition  (Hu  et  al.  2020).  Common 
mental  health  disorders,  such  as  depression  and  anxiety,  are 

particularly associated with a higher incidence of chronic health 
conditions  including  cardiovascular  disease,  diabetes  and  re-
spiratory  disorders  (Stanton  et  al.  2019;  Heissel  et  al.  2023). 
Consequently,  this  population  faces  substantially  poorer  phys-
ical health outcomes compared to those without mental illness 
(Happell et al. 2015). One key factor contributing to the higher

prevalence of comorbid mental and physical illnesses is low lev-
els  of  physical  activity  (Schuch  et  al.  2017;  Stubbs  et  al.  2017). 
The  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  Mental  Health  Action 
Plan (World Health Organization 2021) recognises that engag-
ing  in  regular  exercise  poses  unique  challenges  for  individu-
als  with  mental  health  conditions.  These  challenges  are  often 
linked to the symptoms of their illness, compounded by external 
barriers such as socioeconomic disadvantages.

Depressive disorders are defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM- 5)  as  ‘sad,  empty  or  irri-
table  mood,  accompanied  by  somatic  and  cognitive  changes 
that  significantly  affect  the  individual's  capacity  to  function’ 
(American  Psychiatric  Association  2018).  Similarly,  anxi-
ety  disorders  are  characterised  by  ‘excessive  fear  and  anxiety 
and  related  behavioural  disturbances’  (American  Psychiatric 
Association 2018). Both depression and anxiety are commonly 
managed with psychotherapy and pharmacological medication 
(Kendrick  and  Pilling  2012).  However,  antidepressant  medica-
tions  can  present  challenges,  including  being  cost  prohibitive 
for some individuals and causing adverse effects such as weight 
gain and insomnia (Stanton et al. 2019).

Although individuals with mental illness may face challenges in 
engaging in exercise, research has shown that physical activity 
can alleviate both physiological and psychosocial impacts asso-
ciated with depression and anxiety (Ren and Xiao 2023; Ramos- 
Sanchez  et  al.  2021).  Physiological  benefits  of  exercise  include 
enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced fatigue (Lopresti 
et al. 2013), improved regulation of stress hormones in the brain 
(Schuch  and  Stubbs  2019)  and  better  mood  and  sleep  patterns 
(Hu  et  al.  2020).  Psychosocial  benefits,  on  the  other  hand,  in-
volve  increased  social  interaction  and  providing  a  distraction 
from  daily  struggles  with  depressive  or  anxiety- related  issues 
(Ren and Xiao 2023; Ramos- Sanchez et al. 2021).

Gordon et al. (2018) reported that resistance exercise has a mod-
erate  effect  on  reducing  depressive  symptoms,  while  Cooney 
et al. (Cooney et al. 2013) found that exercise (mixed aerobic and 
resistance) offers only small mental health benefits, comparable 
to standard psychological treatments. While there is substantial 
evidence supporting the role of exercise in managing depression, 
conflicting  findings  may  arise  due  to  variations  in  the  mode, 
frequency,  intensity  and  volume  of  exercise  prescribed  across 
studies. Additionally, the relatively recent focus on exercise and 
depression  research  highlights  the  need  for  further  investiga-
tion to refine and standardise exercise recommendations for this 
population.

To achieve substantial health benefits, the WHO (Bull et al. 2020) 
recommends that adults engage in the following weekly exercise 
regimen: (i) at least two moderate- intensity strengthening activ-
ities (i.e., resistance training) targeting the major muscle groups 
and  (ii)  at  least  150  to  300 min  of  moderate- intensity  aerobic 
activity, or 75 to 150 min of vigorous- intensity aerobic activity, 
or an equivalent combination of both moderate-  and vigorous- 
intensity aerobic activities. In light of these guidelines and the 
significant impact of depression and  anxiety on mental  health 
and the potential benefits of exercise as a non- pharmacological 
intervention, it is critical to examine the effectiveness of resis-
tance training and aerobic exercise. Therefore, does prescribed 

aerobic  exercise,  resistance  exercise,  or  a  combination  of  both 
improve depressive and/or anxiety symptoms in individuals di-
agnosed with depression or anxiety?

2.1   |   Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Statement

Our author team consists of four women and two men that are 
early  career,  mid- career  and  senior  researchers  from  different 
disciplines, including biostatistics, exercise science and nursing. 
Our analysis was performed on studies from 17 countries in five 
continents,  with  the  study  population  comprising  a  spectrum 
of ages, genders and demographics. However, we acknowledge 
that we did not examine youth or older adult populations.

2.2   |   Registration of Systematic Review Protocol

The  protocol  for  this  systematic  review  was  prospectively  reg-
istered in February 2019 with the PROSPERO database (regis-
tration number: CRD42019119341) and is reported according to 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- 
Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Page et al. 2021).

2.3   |   Literature Search

A systematic search of six databases (EBSCOhost, Scopus, Web 
of  Science,  PsychNET  and  PubMed)  was  conducted  from  the 
earliest  available  record  to  February  24th,  2024.  The  search 
strategy included terms for exercise AND mental health condi-
tions of depression and/or anxiety and was limited to an English 
language version. Additionally, reference lists of included stud-
ies and relevant review articles were searched manually.

A PICO strategy was used to help organise the key terms for the 
literature  search  strategy  (Santos  et  al.  2007).  The  subsequent 
key  terms  were  used  for  searching:  ((‘exercise’ OR  ‘physical 
training’ OR ‘aerobic training’ OR ‘circuit training’ OR ‘strength 
training’ OR ‘resistance  training’ OR ‘high 
interval 
training’  OR ‘fitness’ OR  ‘muscular  strength’  OR  ‘VO2*’  OR 
‘muscular  power’)  AND  (‘anxiety’ OR ‘depression’ OR  ‘mood 
disorder*’)  AND  (‘antidepressant*’  OR 
‘anti  depressant*’ 
OR ‘anxiolytic*’  OR  ‘anti  anxiety’  OR ‘antianxiety’ OR ‘SSRI*’ 
OR  ‘second  generation’  OR ‘tricyclic’  OR  ‘self  efficacy’)  AND 
(‘randomi* control* trial*’)).

2.4   |   Eligibility Criteria

All the studies retrieved were assessed against the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria detailed in Table 1. When the included and ex-
cluded  age  range  overlapped,  and  we  were  not  able  to  extract 
data  that  matched  our  population  inclusion  criteria,  the  study 
was excluded.

For the purposes of this review, usual care was considered treat-
ment that is typically offered to people with a diagnosis of depres-
sion and/or anxiety as part of their routine care and for example

2.5   |   Study Selection

Once  the  duplicate  studies  were  removed,  the  search  results 
were screened independently by four authors (LG, HB, AB and 
KLE) against the inclusion criteria identified in Table 1. Once no 
further articles could be excluded by title or abstract, the full text 
articles were retrieved and independently assessed for eligibility 
by two authors (LG and AB). Titles and authors were not masked 
to  the  researchers  conducting  the  review.  Any  disagreements 
arising between authors regarding the eligibility of studies were 
resolved through discussion with a third author (HB).

2.6   |   Data Extraction

Data extraction from the original studies was completed by the 
authors  (HB,  LG,  JS,  LA,  AB  and  KLE).  Once  the  studies  met 
the inclusion criteria, the following data were extracted into an 
Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Office, Microsoft, 
Redmond, Washington, USA): (1) study identification informa-
tion; (2) participant information; (3) country of study; (4) depres-
sion outcomes; (5) anxiety outcomes; (6) length of training study; 
(7)  mode  of  exercise;  (8)  exercise  programmatic  variables;  (9) 
exercise setting and (10) additional outcome measures. Within 
the exercise programmatic variables, exercise intensity was as-
certained according to the guidelines detailed by Norton et al. 
(Norton et al. 2010).

2.7   |   Risk of Bias Assessment

The  quality  of  individual  studies  was  assessed  using  the 
Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (Higgins et al. 2011). The quality of 

evidence for each meta- analysis was assessed according to the 
GRADE  criteria  for  systematic  reviews  (Higgins  et  al.  2019) 
using the GRADEpro tool. This was undertaken independently 
by  two  authors  (JS,  LA)  and  if  any  discrepancies  were  identi-
fied, a third author (HB) would resolve the discrepancy through 
discussion.

2.8   |   Reporting Quality Assessment

The  quality  of  reporting  for  the  included  randomised  con-
trolled  trials  was  assessed  using  the  consolidated  standards  of 
reporting  trials  (CONSORT)  statement  (Butcher  et  al.  2022). 
A  total  of  32  articles  (Helgadóttir  et  al.  2016;  Abdelbasset  and 
Alqahtani  2019;  Abdollahi  et  al.  2017;  Babyak  et  al.  2000; 
Bernard  et  al.  2015;  Blumenthal  et  al.  2021,  2007,  1999,  2012; 
Brush  et  al.  2022;  Carneiro  et  al.  2015;  Chalder  et  al.  2012; 
Cheung and Lee 2018; Doose et al. 2015; Fernandes et al. 2022; 
Haller  et  al.  2018;  Haffmans  et  al.  2006;  Levin  et  al.  2018; 
Mailey  et  al.  2010;  Majumder  et  al.  2015;  Merom  et  al.  2008; 
Mota- Pereira et al. 2011; Oeland et al. 2010; Gordon et al. 2023, 
2021; Pfaff et al. 2014; Phongsavan et al. 2008; Pilu et al. 2007; 
Roy et al. 2018; Verhoeven et al. 2023; Henriksson et al. 2022; 
La  Rocque  et  al.  2021)  were  examined  based  on  adherence  to 
CONSORT reporting standards, which was undertaken by two 
authors (HB and LG).

2.9   |   Statistical Analysis

Random  effects  meta- analyses  were  constructed  using  the 
DerSimonian and Laird model. This assumes that the individual 
studies  represent  a  random  sample  from  a  population  of  stud-
ies with a mean treatment effect about which individual study 
effects  vary.  The  main  meta- analyses  were  based  on  the  pri-
mary outcomes and included the depression scores and anxiety 
scores. Additional secondary meta- analyses were based on the 

3 of 16

secondary  outcomes  of  exercise  testing,  self- efficacy,  exercise 
programme adherence and attendance.

The  random  effects  model  was  chosen  to  reflect  recognised 
clinical  and  methodological  heterogeneity  across  included 
studies with respect to all primary and secondary outcomes. 
For  primary  and  secondary  analyses  of  interval- level  nu-
merical  measures,  standardised  mean  differences,  based  on 
intervention  minus  control  treatment,  and  associated  95% 
confidence  intervals  (CIs),  were  processed  due  to  variation 
in the instruments used to record outcomes. However, for the 
secondary  outcome  of  exercise  attendance,  we  assessed  risk 
ratios  based  on  the  ratio  of  attendance  proportion  in  inter-
vention  to  control  treatments,  and  associated  95%  CIs  were 
measured. The analyses were based on summary statistics of 
post- test scores (sample size, mean and standard deviation for 
numerical (interval- level) variables; and number of events and 
non- events for binary variables).

Clinical  improvements  in  depression  and  anxiety  were  repre-
sented by reductions in reported scores. Clinical improvements 
in exercise testing, self- efficacy, exercise programme adherence 
and attendance were represented by increases in reported scores. 
The tools used to measure depression and anxiety were collated 
to determine the most frequently used across the included stud-
ies. Therefore, when included studies measured depression and/
or anxiety using more than one instrument, we defaulted to only 
include the instrument that was most frequently used to allow 
for statistical comparison between studies. Where not reported 
directly,  mean  values  were  estimated  from  reported  medians. 
Similarly,  standard  deviations  were  calculated  from  reported 
standard errors or confidence intervals for grouped means; and 
standard  errors,  confidence  intervals,  t- values  or  p- values  for 
differences  in  means  were  estimated  from  reported  ranges  or 
inter- quartile ranges.

Following  recommendations  of  the  Cochrane  Collaboration 
(Higgins et al. 2019), any studies reporting statistics from two or 
more intervention groups which had been pre- identified as suit-
able for inclusion in the depression and/or anxiety meta- analyses 
were  combined  into  a  single  group,  leading  to  single  pairwise 
comparisons.  For  example,  Helgadóttir  et  al.  (Helgadóttir 
et al. 2016) had participants training in three different intensity 
exercise groups (light, moderate and vigorous) which were com-
bined into a single exercise group for the meta- analyses.

Forest plots were conducted for meta- analyses of both primary 
outcomes,  reporting  synthesised  estimates  and  associated 
95%  CIs,  and  a  Z- test  for  the  standardised  mean  difference. 
Heterogeneity statistics were also reported, including Cochran's 
Q test for heterogeneity, the I2 statistic (the proportion of varia-
tion across studies ascribed to heterogeneity) and the τ2 statistic 
(an  estimate  of  between  study  variance).  Sensitivity  analyses 
were conducted on the meta- analyses of both primary outcomes 
to assess the robustness of the derived estimates. Each of the k 
included studies was omitted in turn, and a meta- analysis was 
conducted based on the remaining k–1 studies. Any study that 
was suspected of excessive influence (considered to be indicated 
by the point estimate of the ‘omitted’ analysis of a study lying 
outside the confidence interval of the ‘combined’ analysis) was 
flagged as an influential study.

Funnel plots were generated for the meta- analyses of both pri-
mary outcomes to detect small study effect- related bias, includ-
ing  publication  bias  and  other  types  of  bias  which  may  result 
from the true treatment effect differing between small and large 
studies,  as  indicated  by  asymmetry  in  the  funnel  plot.  Funnel 
plots  are  displayed  in  line  with  meta- analytic  convention  and 
following  recommendations  by  Sterne  and  Egger  (Sterne  and 
Egger 2001) with study size, as measured by the standard error 
of  the  treatment  or  intervention  effect,  plotted  (on  the  vertical 
axis) against the effect of the treatment in each study.

Synthesised effects from meta- analyses of secondary outcomes 
were  reported  in  tabulated  form.  Forest  plots,  influence  plots 
and funnel plots were not constructed for secondary analyses. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted based on the type of exercise 
intervention  delivered,  comparing  aerobic  exercise  with  resis-
tance  or  mixed  methods  (aerobic  and  resistance)  with  respect 
to both primary outcomes. Synthesised effects from sub- groups 
were reported in tabulated form.

3.1   |   Search Results

The  initial  search  results  yielded  38 358  articles  which  were 
downloaded  into  Endnote  (version  9.1,  Clarivate  Analytics, 
Philadelphia, PA, USA). A total of 22 448 duplicate articles were 
then  removed,  leaving  15 908  studies.  After  records  were  ex-
cluded,  145  full  text  articles  were  retrieved  with  a  further  113 
articles excluded at full text screening (reasons outlined in the 
PRISMA  flowchart  Figure  1),  resulting  in  a  total  of  32  arti-
cles included in the systematic review (Helgadóttir et al. 2016;

(Abdelbasset  and  Alqahtani  2019)  and  the  United  Kingdom 
(Brush et al. 2022).

Depression  was  reported  in  30  studies;  13  of  these  studies 
also  reported  on  anxiety  (Bernard  et  al.  2015;  Blumenthal 
et  al.  2021,  1999;  Brush  et  al.  2022;  Carneiro  et  al.  2015;

Phongsavan et al. 2008; Pilu et al. 2007), and only one study 
reported on anxiety only (Gordon et al. 2021). Seven different 
measurement tools were used to measure depression, and four 
were used for anxiety (Table S2). Twelve studies included vari-
ous physical fitness outcomes (Bernard et al. 2015; Blumenthal 
et al. 2007, 1999, 2012; Brush et al. 2022; Carneiro et al. 2015; 
Doose et al. 2015; Haller et al. 2018; Levin et al. 2018; Oeland 
et al. 2010; Pfaff et al. 2014; Henriksson et al. 2022) (Table S3). 
Two  studies  reported  usable  data  on  the  6- min  walking  test 
(Bernard  et  al.  2015;  Carneiro  et  al.  2015).  Five  studies  re-
ported usable data on the VO2 max test (Blumenthal et al. 1999; 
Brush et al. 2022; Doose et al. 2015; Haller et al. 2018; Oeland 
et  al.  2010).  Usable  data  was  not  reported  by  more  than  one 

study  for  any  other  physical  fitness  outcome.  Three  studies 
included outcomes related to self- efficacy (Haller et al. 2018; 
Haffmans et al. 2006; Mailey et al. 2010) (Table S3), with all 
reporting  usable  data.  Eleven  studies  included  various  out-
comes  related  to  exercise  adherence  (Helgadóttir  et  al.  2016; 
Blumenthal  et  al.  2007,  1999;  Carneiro  et  al.  2015;  Chalder 
et  al.  2012;  Doose  et  al.  2015;  Mailey  et  al.  2010;  Merom 
et al. 2008; Mota- Pereira et al. 2011; Phongsavan et al. 2008; 
Gordon et al. 2021) (Table S3), but usable data was not reported 
by more than one of these studies for any outcome related to 
adherence. Fifteen studies included outcomes related to atten-
dance at sessions (Helgadóttir et al. 2016; Bernard et al. 2015; 
Blumenthal  et  al.  2007,  1999,  2012;  Carneiro  et  al.  2015; 
Cheung  and  Lee  2018;  Doose  et  al.  2015;  Haller  et  al.  2018;

Gordon  et  al.  2021;  Henriksson  et  al.  2022;  La  Rocque 
et al. 2021) (Table S3). Meta- analysis data included three stud-
ies with usable data (Chalder et al. 2012; Majumder et al. 2015; 
Phongsavan et al. 2008). A total of 21 studies prescribed aer-
obic  exercise  alone  (Helgadóttir  et  al.  2016;  Abdelbasset  and 
Alqahtani  2019;  Abdollahi  et  al.  2017;  Babyak  et  al.  2000; 
Bernard et al. 2015; Blumenthal et al. 2021, 2007, 1999, 2012;

Merom  et  al.  2008;  Mota- Pereira  et  al.  2011;  Phongsavan 
et al. 2008; Roy et al. 2018; Verhoeven et al. 2023; La Rocque 
et al. 2021). Three studies prescribed resistance exercise alone 
(Gordon  et  al.  2023,  2021;  Pilu  et  al.  2007),  and  six  studies 
prescribed combined aerobic and resistance (mixed) exercise 
(Helgadóttir  et  al.  2016;  Haller  et  al.  2018;  Levin  et  al.  2018; 
Oeland et al. 2010; Pfaff et al. 2014; Henriksson et al. 2022). 
Exercise intensities varied across the studies (Riebe et al. 2018),

which included light- to- moderate (Chalder et al. 2012; Mailey 
et  al.  2010;  Roy  et  al.  2018;  Gordon  et  al.  2021),  light- to- 
moderate- to- vigorous  (Helgadóttir  et  al.  2016;  Henriksson 
et al. 2022; La Rocque et al. 2021), moderate (Abdelbasset and 
Alqahtani 2019; Abdollahi et al. 2017; Cheung and Lee 2018; 
Haller et al. 2018; Levin et al. 2018; Merom et al. 2008; Mota-

Pfaff et al. 2014; Verhoeven et al. 2023) and vigorous (Babyak 
et al. 2000; Blumenthal et al. 2021, 2007, 1999, 2012; Haffmans 
et al. 2006; Majumder et al. 2015).

3.3   |   Risk of Bias Assessment

The  quality  assessment  of  the  32  studies  included  was  out-
lined  by  the  Cochrane  Effective  Practice  and  Organisation  of 
Care risk- of- bias tool for randomised controlled trials (Higgins 
et  al.  2011).  Eleven  of  the  included  studies  (34%)  were  consid-
ered to have a low risk of bias (Helgadóttir et al. 2016; Bernard 
et  al.  2015;  Blumenthal  et  al.  2021,  1999;  Brush  et  al.  2022; 
Carneiro  et  al.  2015;  Merom  et  al.  2008;  Gordon  et  al.  2023; 
Phongsavan et al. 2008; Pilu et al. 2007), while 19 of the stud-
ies  (59%)  were  considered  to  have  a  high  risk  of  bias  (Sterne 
and  Egger  2001;  Abdelbasset  and  Alqahtani  2019;  Abdollahi 
et  al.  2017;  Bernard  et  al.  2015;  Blumenthal  et  al.  2007,  2012; 
Chalder  et  al.  2012;  Doose  et  al.  2015;  Fernandes  et  al.  2022; 

Haller et al. 2018; Haffmans et al. 2006; Levin et al. 2018; Mailey 
et al. 2010; Majumder et al. 2015; Mota- Pereira et al. 2011; Oeland 
et al. 2010), and two (6%) were unclear (Cheung and Lee 2018; 
Pfaff et al. 2014). Figure 2 shows the risk of bias assessment for 
all included studies. The main risk of bias was blinding of par-
ticipants  and  researchers  (performance  bias),  with  all  studies 
considered high or uncertain risk. The second was blinding of 
outcome  assessor,  with  69%  of  the  studies  considered  high  or 
uncertain risk.

3.4   |   Reporting Quality Assessment

The  average  adherence  of  the  32  studies  according  to  the  25 
checklist items of the CONSORT statement was 67%, ranging 
from  38%  to  84%.  Thirteen  studies  (41%)  had  high  reporting 
quality (≥ 75% adherence) (Helgadóttir et al. 2016; Blumenthal 
et  al.  2007;  Brush  et  al.  2022;  Carneiro  et  al.  2015;  Chalder 
et  al.  2012;  Cheung  and  Lee  2018;  Fernandes  et  al.  2022; 
Haller  et  al.  2018;  Gordon  et  al.  2023;  Pfaff  et  al.  2014; 
Verhoeven  et  al.  2023;  Henriksson  et  al.  2022;  La  Rocque 
et al. 2021), with a further 15 studies (47%) reporting adequate 
quality  (between  50%  and  75%  adherence)  (Abdelbasset  and 
Alqahtani  2019;  Abdollahi  et  al.  2017;  Bernard  et  al.  2015; 
Blumenthal  et  al.  2021,  1999,  2012;  Doose  et  al.  2015;  Levin 
et al. 2018; Mailey et al. 2010; Merom et al. 2008; Mota- Pereira

et  al.  2018;  Gordon  et  al.  2021).  All  studies  reported  the

abstract,  introduction  and  discussion  sections.  Most  studies 
reported appropriate information pertaining to the interven-
tions  (94%  adherence)  and  statistical  analyses  (97%  adher-
ence).  However,  key  methodological  aspects  such  as  sample 
size  calculations  (28%  adherence),  randomised  allocation  se-
quence  (44%  adherence)  and  blinding  (53%  adherence)  were 
frequently underreported.

3.5   |   Depression Outcome

Thirty  studies  including  the  outcome  of  depression  were  as-
sessed for meta- analyses (Helgadóttir et al. 2016; Abdelbasset 
and Alqahtani 2019; Abdollahi et al. 2017; Babyak et al. 2000; 
Bernard et al. 2015; Blumenthal et al. 2021, 2007, 1999, 2012; 
Brush  et  al.  2022;  Carneiro  et  al.  2015;  Chalder  et  al.  2012; 
Cheung  and  Lee  2018;  Doose  et  al.  2015;  Haller  et  al.  2018; 
Haffmans  et  al.  2006;  Levin  et  al.  2018;  Mailey  et  al.  2010; 
Majumder  et  al.  2015;  Merom  et  al.  2008;  Mota- Pereira 
et  al.  2011;  Oeland  et  al.  2010;  Gordon  et  al.  2023;  Pfaff 
et  al.  2014;  Phongsavan  et  al.  2008;  Pilu  et  al.  2007;  Roy 
et  al.  2018;  Henriksson  et  al.  2022;  La  Rocque  et  al.  2021). 
One  study  did  not  report  an  independent  piece  of  research 
but referred to statistics reported in another study (Abdollahi 
et  al.  2017).  Four  further  studies  did  not  report  usable  data 
(Brush  et  al.  2022;  Fernandes  et  al.  2022;  Pfaff  et  al.  2014; 
Phongsavan et al. 2008). Usable post- test or change statistics in 
one or more intervention groups and a control group were ob-
tained from the remaining 26 studies (Helgadóttir et al. 2016; 
Abdelbasset and Alqahtani 2019; Abdollahi et al. 2017; Bernard 
et al. 2015; Blumenthal et al. 2021, 2007, 1999, 2012; Carneiro 
et al. 2015; Chalder et al. 2012; Haller et al. 2018; Haffmans 
et  al.  2006;  Levin  et  al.  2018;  Mailey  et  al.  2010;  Majumder 
et al. 2015; Merom et al. 2008; Mota- Pereira et al. 2011; Oeland 
et al. 2010; Gordon et al. 2023; Pilu et al. 2007; Roy et al. 2018; 
Verhoeven  et  al.  2023;  Henriksson  et  al.  2022;  La  Rocque 
et  al.  2021).  Eighteen  studies  were  included  based  on  a  pair-
wise comparison between a control treatment and a single re-
ported  intervention  group  (Abdelbasset  and  Alqahtani  2019; 
Abdollahi et al. 2017; Babyak et al. 2000; Bernard et al. 2015; 
Blumenthal  et  al.  2012;  Carneiro  et  al.  2015;  Chalder 
et  al.  2012;  Cheung  and  Lee  2018;  Doose  et  al.  2015;  Haller 
et  al.  2018;  Majumder  et  al.  2015;  Merom  et  al.  2008;  Mota- 
Pereira et al. 2011; Oeland et al. 2010; Gordon et al. 2023; Pilu 
et al. 2007; Roy et al. 2018; Verhoeven et al. 2023). Eight stud-
ies reported statistics from two or three exercise intervention 
groups  which  had  been  pre- identified  as  suitable  for  inclu-
sion in the meta- analysis (Helgadóttir et al. 2016; Blumenthal 
et al. 2021, 2007, 1999; Haffmans et al. 2006; Levin et al. 2018; 
Henriksson et al. 2022; La Rocque et al. 2021); all such pairs 
of intervention groups were combined, again leading to single 
pairwise comparisons.

As  seen  in  Figure  3,  13  studies  reported  a  statistically  signifi-
cant  effect  (at  the  5%  significance  level)  in  favour  of  interven-
tion  methods  on  depression  outcomes  (Helgadóttir  et  al.  2016; 
Abdelbasset  and  Alqahtani  2019;  Abdollahi  et  al.  2017;  Doose 
et  al.  2015;  Levin  et  al.  2018;  Majumder  et  al.  2015;  Merom 
et al. 2008; Mota- Pereira et al. 2011; Oeland et al. 2010; Gordon 
et  al.  2023;  Pilu  et  al.  2007;  Verhoeven  et  al.  2023;  La  Rocque 
et  al.  2021).  A  further  11  studies  reported  a  non- significant 

effect in favour of intervention methods on depression outcomes 
(Blumenthal et al. 2021, 2007, 2012; Carneiro et al. 2015; Chalder 
et al. 2012; Cheung and Lee 2018; Haller et al. 2018; Haffmans 
et  al.  2006;  Mailey  et  al.  2010;  Roy  et  al.  2018;  Henriksson 
et al. 2022). No studies reported a statistically significant effect 
(at the 5% significance level) in favour of control treatment on 
depression  outcomes.  Two  studies  reported  a  non- significant 
effect  in  favour  of  control  treatment  on  depression  outcomes 
(Bernard  et  al.  2015;  Blumenthal  et  al.  1999).  Individual  esti-
mates for the standardised mean difference ranged from −6.32 
(95%  CI:  −7.85  to  −4.79)  (favouring  intervention  methods),  re-
ported by Merom et al. (Merom et al. 2008) to 0.18 (95% CI: −0.16 
to 0.52) (favouring control treatment), reported by Blumenthal 
et al. (Blumenthal et al. 1999).

A  meta- analysis  on  the  outcome  of  depression  revealed  that  a 
synthesised estimate of the standardised mean difference in de-
pression scores from intervention treatment methods and con-
trol treatment methods was −0.97 (95% CI −1.28 to −0.66); i.e., 
favouring  intervention  methods.  A  Z- test  of  the  standardised 
mean  effect  revealed  strong  evidence  (at  the  5%  significance 
level) for a non- zero effect (Z = 6.10; p < 0.001). Cochran's χ2 test 
for  heterogeneity  revealed  strong  evidence  (at  the  5%  signifi-
cance level) for statistical heterogeneity ( χ2
(25) = 253.5; p < 0.001). 
The I2 statistic was 90.1%, indicating high levels of heterogeneity 
(high proportion of variation across studies ascribed to hetero-
geneity). The τ2 statistic (an estimate of between study variance) 
was revealed to be 0.531. The data is summarised in a forest plot 
(Figure 3).

A sensitivity analysis revealed no individual study to be exert-
ing excessive influence on the meta- analysis, with all point esti-
mates of the omitted analyses lying within the 95% CI associated 
with the estimate of the combined analysis. Estimates and asso-
ciated CIs are plotted on an influence plot (Figure 4).

The funnel plot for the depression outcome (Figure 5) displayed 
some evidence for small- study effects, with some included stud-
ies lying outside pseudo- 95% confidence limits.

3.6   |   Anxiety Outcome

Fifteen  studies  including  the  outcome  of  anxiety  were  as-
sessed  for  meta- analyses  (Bernard  et  al.  2015;  Blumenthal 
et  al.  2021,  1999;  Brush  et  al.  2022;  Carneiro  et  al.  2015; 
Cheung  and  Lee  2018;  Levin  et  al.  2018;  Mailey  et  al.  2010; 
Merom et al. 2008; Oeland et al. 2010; Gordon et al. 2023, 2021; 
Phongsavan  et  al.  2008;  Verhoeven  et  al.  2023;  Henriksson 
et  al.  2022).  Three  studies  did  not  report  usable  data  (Brush 
et al. 2022; Oeland et al. 2010; Phongsavan et al. 2008). Usable 
statistics  in  one  or  more  intervention  groups  and  a  control 
group were obtained from the remaining 12 studies (Bernard 
et al. 2015; Blumenthal et al. 2021, 1999; Carneiro et al. 2015; 
Cheung  and  Lee  2018;  Levin  et  al.  2018;  Mailey  et  al.  2010; 
Merom  et  al.  2008;  Mota- Pereira  et  al.  2011;  Verhoeven 
et al. 2023; Gordon et al. 2021; Henriksson et al. 2022). Eight 
studies  were  included  based  on  a  pairwise  comparison  be-
tween  a  control  treatment  and  a  single  reported  interven-
tion group (Bernard et al. 2015; Carneiro et al. 2015; Cheung 
and Lee 2018; Mailey et al. 2010; Merom et al. 2008; Gordon

et al. 2023, 2021; Verhoeven et al. 2023). Four studies reported 
statistics  from  two  intervention  groups  which  had  been  pre- 
identified  as  suitable  for  inclusion  in  the  meta- analysis 
(Blumenthal  et  al.  2021,  1999;  Levin  et  al.  2018;  Henriksson 
et  al.  2022);  all  such  intervention  groups  were  combined, 
again leading to single pairwise comparisons.

Two studies reported a statistically significant effect (at the 5% 
significance level) in favour of intervention methods on anx-
iety outcomes (Merom et al. 2008; Gordon et al. 2021). Eight 
studies reported a non- significant effect in favour of interven-
tion  methods  on  anxiety  outcomes  (Blumenthal  et  al.  2021, 
1999; Carneiro et al. 2015; Levin et al. 2018; Mailey et al. 2010; 

Gordon  et  al.  2023;  Verhoeven  et  al.  2023;  Henriksson 
et  al.  2022).  Two  studies  reported  a  non- significant  effect  in 
favour  of  control  treatment  on  anxiety  outcomes  (Bernard 
et  al.  2015;  Cheung  and  Lee  2018).  Individual  estimates  for 
the standardised mean difference ranged from −1.94 (95% CI: 
−2.36  to  −1.52)  (favouring  intervention  methods),  reported 
by  Verhoeven  et  al.  (Verhoeven  et  al.  2023),  to  +0.12  (95% 
CI:  −0.58  to  0.81)  (favouring  control  treatment),  reported  by 
Cheung et al. (Cheung and Lee 2018).

A meta- analysis on the outcome of anxiety revealed that a syn-
thesised  estimate  of  the  standardised  mean  difference  in  anx-
iety  scores  from  intervention  treatment  methods  and  control

treatment  methods  was  −0.66  (95%  CI  −1.09  to  −0.23);  i.e.,  a 
significant  effect  favouring  intervention  methods.  A  Z- test  of 
the  standardised  mean  effect  revealed  no  evidence  (at  the  5% 
significance  level)  for  a  non- zero  effect  (Z = 3.000;  p = 0.003). 
Cochran's  χ2  test  for  heterogeneity  revealed  strong  evidence 
(at  the  5%  significance  level)  for  statistical  heterogeneity 
( χ2
(11) = 77.5;  p = 0.005).  The  I2  statistic  was  85.8%,  indicating 
high levels of heterogeneity (high proportion of variation across 
studies ascribed to heterogeneity). The τ2 statistic (an estimate 
of between study variance) was revealed to be 0.468. The data is 
summarised in a forest plot (Figure 6).

A  sensitivity  analysis  revealed  no  individual  study  to  be  ex-
erting  excessive  influence  on  the  analysis,  with  all  point  esti-
mates of the omitted analyses lying within the 95% confidence 
interval associated with the estimate of the combined analysis. 
Estimates and associated confidence intervals are plotted on an 
influence plot (Figure 7).

scores when delivered in resistance/mixed mode, but not aerobic 
mode.  No  significant  between- subgroup  effects  were  revealed 
(Tables 3 and 4).

3.7   |   Secondary Analyses

4   |   Discussion

Secondary  meta- analyses  were  conducted  on  the  6- min  walk-
ing test (Bernard et al. 2015; Carneiro et al. 2015) and VO2 max 
test  physical  fitness  outcomes  (Blumenthal  et  al.  1999;  Doose 
et  al.  2015;  Haller  et  al.  2018;  Oeland  et  al.  2010;  Verhoeven 
et  al.  2023);  on  the  self- efficacy  outcome  (Haller  et  al.  2018; 
Haffmans et al. 2006; Mailey et al. 2010), and on the attendance 
outcome (Chalder et al. 2012; Majumder et al. 2015; Phongsavan 
et  al.  2008).  The  parameters  of  these  meta- analyses  are  sum-
marised in Table 2.

3.8   |   Subgroup Analyses

Subgroup analyses conducted on exercise mode revealed that in-
terventions were significantly associated (at the 5% significance 
level) with changes in depression scores when delivered in either 
the  aerobic  mode,  resistance  mode,  or  mixed  mode;  and  inter-
ventions were significantly associated with changes in anxiety 

The  main  findings  from  this  systematic  review  with  meta- 
analysis are that exercise- based interventions are beneficial for 
improving symptoms of depression and anxiety in people with 
a clinical diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. These benefi-
cial effects of exercise were not influenced by the mode of exer-
cise delivery on depressive symptoms, with some influence on 
anxiety symptoms. Therefore, aerobic, resistance, or a mixture 
of aerobic and resistance (mixed) modes of exercise can be pre-
scribed to individuals with depression to improve their depres-
sive symptoms, or for those with anxiety, resistance or aerobic 
and resistance (mixed) modes. However, some caution when in-
terpreting the anxiety data is warranted given the smaller num-
ber of studies in this analysis.

The large beneficial effect (SMD = 0.97) of exercise for improv-
ing  depressive  symptoms  can  be  observed  after  analysis  of  26 
studies;  50%  of  these  studies  significantly  favoured  the  exer-
cise  intervention  in  the  treatment  of  depression  (Figure  3).

FIGURE 7    |    Influence plot for meta- analysis of anxiety outcome.

FIGURE 8    |    Funnel plot for meta- analysis of anxiety outcome (with 
pseudo- 95% confidence limits).

This  significant  beneficial  exercise  effect  occurred  in  aerobic 
(n = 9) and resistance or mixed (n = 4) modes of exercise delivery 
(Figure  3),  with  no  between- group  effect,  indicating  the  mode 
of  exercise  prescription  did  not  influence  the  beneficial  effect. 
These  findings  are  similar  to  those  of  Cooney  et  al.  (Cooney 
et  al.  2013)  who  found  exercise  had  a  moderately  beneficial 
effect  on  depression  symptoms  compared  to  the  control  group 
(SMD = −0.62, −0.81 to −0.42). Despite the benefits of exercise 
to ameliorate depressive symptoms, it is often underused and/
or undervalued as part of standard treatment models for people 
with mental illnesses such as depression (Kleemann et al. 2020; 

McKeon  et  al.  2022).  Some  of  these  barriers  to  exercise  pre-
scription may relate to the mode of exercise prescribed, access 
to  appropriately  trained  personnel  such  as  exercise  scientists/
therapists or exercise physiologists (Korman et al. 2020) as well 
as a lack of understanding or confidence by health professionals 
related to appropriate exercise recommendations.

There  is  also  evidence  that  exercise- based  interventions  are 
moderately  beneficial  for  improving  symptoms  of  anxiety 
(SMD = 0.66), although the number of studies used for analysis 
was limited. From the 12 studies examining the effects of exer-
cise on anxiety symptoms, eight were favourable towards exer-
cise, yet only 4 were statistically significant. Notably, of the 12 
studies, only one study (which was favourable towards exercise) 
met the WHO criteria (Bull et al. 2020) for the weekly minimum 
physical activity levels. Therefore, it could be hypothesised that 
if the exercise prescribed in the remaining seven studies at least 
met the minimum physical activity guidelines for intensity and 
volume, then perhaps the magnitude of mental health benefits 
from exercise could have been strengthened (Pearce et al. 2022).

Despite the findings from this review favouring the use of exer-
cise to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, only three 
studies, from 30 studies included in this review, met the WHO 
weekly  physical  activity  guidelines  (volume  and  intensity)  for 
both aerobic and resistance exercise. Fifteen studies had suffi-
cient  aerobic  exercise,  and  seven  had  sufficient  resistance  ex-
ercise.  This  suggests  that  health  professionals  should  promote 
increasing exercise volume, above being sedentary, to improve 
mental health, even if the volume and intensity do not meet the

physical activity guidelines. This is in accordance with a recent 
review establishing that significant mental health benefits can 
be achieved from performing physical activity levels below the 
WHO  recommendations  (Pearce  et  al.  2022).  It  also  suggests 
that  perhaps  initial  training  and  education  or  professional  de-
velopment  opportunities  for  health  professionals  working  in 
mental  health  may  benefit  from  a  better  understanding  of  the 
physical activity guidelines and WHO recommendations.

There were no studies that excessively influenced the outcomes 
of the primary analyses (Figures 4 and 7). However, it must be 
noted that  many of the included studies had a relatively  small 
sample size, with 18 studies conducted with 50 participants or 
less,  and  seven  of  these  conducted  on  30  participants  or  less, 
not  uncommon  in  exercise- based  intervention  studies  (Abt 
et  al.  2020).  Despite  all  included  studies  being  randomised, 
some  substantive  baseline  imbalances  in  both  depression  and 

anxiety scores were observed. An additional challenge with the 
analysis in this review included some studies that reported me-
dians and inter- quartile ranges rather than means and standard 
deviations,  which  were  estimated  using  standard  methods  for 
analysis.  And  finally,  some  studies  did  not  report  exact  values 
but  presented  data  in  graphical  form  only  that  required  man-
ual extraction using a high- resolution scanner. The difficulties 
we identified are not uncommon in exercise and sport science 
research with calls encouraging an improvement in the quality 
of  methodological  rigour  and  statistical  analysis  (Sainani  and 
Chamari 2022).

The effects of aerobic and resistance exercise on depression and 
anxiety  often  vary  across  different  countries  and  regions  due 
to  cultural,  socioeconomic  and  healthcare  system  differences 
(de  la  Arias-   Torre  et  al.  2021).  Populations  with  better  access 
to exercise facilities and greater awareness of the mental health

benefits  of  physical  activity  might  be  expected  to  experience 
more  substantial  reductions  in  depression  and  anxiety  symp-
toms  compared  to  those  facing  limited  resources,  infrastruc-
ture  challenges,  or  cultural  barriers  to  engaging  in  structured 
exercise  programs  (Salmi  et  al.  2023).  However,  our  review 
revealed  mixed  results,  underscoring  the  difficulty  of  making 
direct  comparisons  due  to  variations  in  study  design,  sample 
characteristics and intervention protocols. For example, studies 
conducted  in  Australia  (Levin  et  al.  2018;  Merom  et  al.  2008) 
consistently  demonstrated  the  beneficial  effects  of  exercise  in 
reducing  depressive  symptoms.  In  contrast,  research  from  the 
USA  (Blumenthal  et  al.  2021,  2007,  1999,  2012)  found  little  to 
no benefit from 16 weeks of vigorous intensity walking and run-
ning  in  improving  depressive  symptoms.  Studies  from  Saudi 
Arabia  (Abdelbasset  and  Alqahtani  2019)  and  Iran  (Abdollahi 
et al. 2017), however, reported significant benefits from 12 weeks 
of  moderate  intensity  walking  for  reducing  depressive  symp-
toms. Similarly, studies from India (Majumder et al. 2015; Roy 
et al. 2018) showed that exercise had a moderate effect on reduc-
ing  depression.  These  contrasting  findings  highlight  the  com-
plex  nature  of  exercise  interventions  and  the  need  for  further 
investigation into how regional and contextual factors influence 
outcomes.

When assessing the quality of the randomised controlled trials 
included in this review, 67% met the 25 checklist items outlined 
in the CONSORT statement. This adherence rate is comparable 
to  other  meta- analyses  evaluating  the  quality  and  compliance 
of randomised controlled trials in cancer (68%) (Süt et al. 2008), 
ischaemic  stroke  (68%)  (Kodounis  et  al.  2020)  and  multiple 
sclerosis  research  (68%)  (Rikos  et  al.  2016),  while  being  nota-
bly higher than in diabetic retinopathy research (45%) (Mozetic 
et  al.  2019).  Key  methodological  aspects,  such  as  sample  size 
calculations,  were  often  underreported,  with  only  28%  adher-
ence.  Recruiting  participants  for  randomised  controlled  trials 
is inherently challenging, with barriers such as strict eligibility 
criteria, reluctance towards randomisation, healthcare provider 
limitations  and  logistical  burdens  related  to  time  and  finan-
cial commitment. Consequently, many studies recruit as many 
participants as possible within a set timeframe, rather than re-
porting their sample size calculations. However, this approach 
can  often  result  in  underpowering  their  research.  Researchers 
should be strongly encouraged to adhere to the CONSORT state-
ment when conducting randomised controlled trials.

Meta- analyses have limitations (LeLorier et al. 1997) and inherit 
any limitations of the individual studies that are included within 
them and the potential bias of selection of those included studies. 
However, the use of broad terms in the search strategy for both 
exercise and the outcomes of depression and anxiety limited the 
number of missing studies, evident from the large volume of re-
turned studies. Despite our inclusion criteria being randomised 
controlled  studies,  the  quality  of  reporting  was  varied.  Many 
studies  sparsely  reported  methodological  information  pertain-
ing  to  the  exercise  prescription  that  would  enable  replication 
(Schulz et al. 2010). This makes it challenging for future reviews 
to broaden their research questions to determine the optimum 
frequency,  duration,  intensity,  nature  of  supervision,  mode  of 
exercise and cost effectiveness of the exercise. Furthermore, the 
meta- analyses were challenging since there was substantial di-
versity in intervention prescription, including exercise intensity 

(low, moderate, vigorous, combined) exercise mode (swimming, 
walking, running, resistance etc.), session delivery (individual, 
group, combined), length of training (2 weeks, 12 months, etc.) 
supervision  models  (supervised,  self- reported,  mixed);  hence 
random effects meta- analyses were judged to be required in all 
cases. Providing information on session attendance, which was 
limited to three studies in this review, and adherence to the ex-
ercise prescription as well as medication adherence, which was 
not always provided, would further enhance the ability to trans-
late the data for clinical use.

A wide range of instruments have been used to measure depres-
sion and anxiety, which makes direct comparisons difficult, with 
the  need  to  conduct  all  analyses  based  on  standardised  mea-
sures. Despite this, all measures used in the analyses were glob-
ally recognised valid and reliable tools to measure symptoms of 
depression and anxiety. While a standardised measurement tool 
may have provided more opportunity for direct comparison, this 
is unlikely to occur given the broad range of clinically accepted 
tools available and utilised internationally.

5   |   Conclusions

In conclusion, despite the benefits of exercise to ameliorate de-
pressive  symptoms,  it  is  often  an  underused  and/or  underval-
ued  part  of  standard  treatment  models  for  people  with  mental 
illnesses  such  as  depression  and  should  be  considered  as  an 
isolated or adjunctive treatment option. Future research should 
consider improving the quality of the reporting of the exercise 
prescription and adhering more closely to the CONSORT state-
ment of reporting of trials.

6   |   Relevance for Clinical Practice

Aerobic  exercise  is  largely  beneficial  for  improving  symptoms 
of  depression,  and  moderately  beneficial  for  reducing  anxiety 
symptoms.  Resistance,  or  a  mixture  of  aerobic  and  resistance 
(mixed) exercise, is moderately beneficial for improving depres-
sion  and  anxiety  symptoms.  The  beneficial  effects  of  exercise 
were  not  influenced  by  the  mode  of  exercise  delivery  on  de-
pressive symptoms, with some influence on anxiety symptoms. 
Therefore,  aerobic,  or  resistance,  or  a  mixture  of  aerobic  and 
resistance (mixed) modes of exercise can be prescribed to indi-
viduals with depression and anxiety to improve their depressive 
and anxiety symptoms.
