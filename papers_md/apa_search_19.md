More thanhalf of people with mental illnessdon't receive help for their disorders. Often, people avoid or delay seeking treatment due to concerns about being treated differently or fears of losing their jobs and livelihood. That's because stigma, prejudice and discrimination against people with mental illness are still very much a problem.

Stigma, prejudice and discrimination against people with mental illness can be subtle or obvious—but no matter the magnitude, they can lead to harm. People with mental illness are marginalized and discriminated against in various ways, but understanding what that looks like and how to address and eradicate it can help.

## The Facts on Stigma, Prejudice and Discrimination

Stigma often comes from lack of understanding or fear. Inaccurate or misleading media representations of mental illness contribute to both those factors. A review ofstudies on stigmashows that while the public may accept the medical or genetic nature of a mental health disorder and the need for treatment, many people still have a negative view of those with mental illness.

Researchers identify different types of stigma: (See chart below.)

- Public stigmainvolves the negative or discriminatory attitudes that others may have about mental illness.

- Self-stigmarefers to the negative attitudes, including internalized shame, that people with mental illness may have about their own condition.

- Structural stigmais more systemic, involving policies of government and private organizations that intentionally or unintentionally limit opportunities for people with mental illness. Examples include lower funding for mental illness research or fewer mental health services relative to other health care.

Stigma not only directly affects individuals with mental illness but also the loved ones who support them, often including their family members.

Stigma around mental illness especially an issue in some diverse racial and ethnic communities and it can be a major barrier to people from those cultures accessing mental health services. For example, in some Asian cultures, seeking professional help for mental illness may be counter to cultural values of strong family, emotional restraint and avoiding shame. Among some groups, including the African American community's, distrust of the mental healthcare system can also be a barrier to seeking help. (See more onmental health in Diverse Populations.)

## Types of Stigma

Media representations of people with mental illness can influence perceptions and stigma, and they have often been negative, inaccurate or violent representations. A study published by Scarf, et. al. in 2020 looked at a recent example, the popular filmJoker(2019), which portrays the lead character as a person with mental illness who becomes extremely violent. The study found that viewing the film "was associated with higher levels of prejudice toward those with mental illness." Additionally, the authors suggest, "Jokermay exacerbate self-stigma for those with a mental illness, leading to delays in help seeking."

The stigma of mental illness is universal. A2016 report on stigmaconcluded "there is no country, society or culture where people with mental illness have the same societal value as people without mental illness."

## Harmful Effects of Stigma and Discrimination

Stigma and discrimination can contribute to worsening symptoms and reduced likelihood of getting treatment. A recent extensivereview of researchfound that self-stigma leads to negative effects on recovery among people diagnosed with severe mental illnesses. Effects can include:

- lower self-esteem

- increased psychiatric symptoms

- difficulties with social relationships

- reduced likelihood of staying with treatment

- more difficulties at work

A 2017 study by Oexle et alinvolving more than 200 individuals with mental illness over a period of two years found that greater self-stigma was associated with poorer recovery from mental illness after one and two years.

Aneditorial in theLancetnotes that the impacts of stigma are pervasive, affecting political enthusiasm, charitable fundraising and availability, support for local services and underfunding of research for mental health relative to other health conditions.

Some of the other harmful effects of stigma can include:

- Reluctance to seek help or treatment and reduced likelihood of staying with treatment.

- Social isolation.

- Lack of understanding by family, friends, coworkers, or others.

- Fewer opportunities for work, school or social activities or trouble finding housing.

- Bullying, physical violence or harassment.

- Health insurance that doesn't adequately cover your mental illness treatment.

- The belief that you'll never succeed at certain challenges or that you can't improve your situation.

### Stigma Can Also Impact Family and Friends

Family members and friends, who often provide essential help and support for people with mental illness, can also experience stigma. They may internalize stigma and blame themselves, or they may fear that people will blame them for causing a loved one’s illness or reject the family socially. This stigma can lead to reduced emotional support, social isolation, and reluctance to seek care for their relative. (Yanos, 2023; Mclean, 2023)

Stigma in Diverse Communities

Stigma around mental illness is especially an issue in some diverse racial and ethnic communities, and it can be a major barrier to people from those cultures accessing mental health services. For more information, please seeMental Health Disparities: Diverse Populations.

## Stigma in the Workplace

Employee Assistance Programs (EAP), commonly available through employers, help employees deal with a variety of concerns such as work-life stressors, mental and emotional well-being issues, family and relationship issues, or financial or legal concerns. However, the services often go unused—only about 3-5% of employees use EAP services, according to the Center for Workplace Mental Health.

A2022 national pollfrom the American Psychiatric Association (APA) found that mental health stigma is still a major challenge in the workplace. About half (48%) of workers say they can discuss mental health openly and honestly with their supervisor, down from 56% in 2021 and 62% in 2020. Half (52%) also say they feel comfortable using mental health services with their current employer, compared to 64% in 2021 and 67% in 2020. In a more positive trend, fewer adults are worried about retaliation if they take time off or seek care for their mental health. About one in three (36%) worried about retaliation if they took time off, compared to 48% in 2021 and 52% in 2020. Less than one-third (31%) were worried about retaliation for seeking care, compared to 43% in 2021 and 2020. (APA, 2022)

## Reducing Stigma

### Public Health Approaches

Many years of research on anti-stigma interventions has found that successful interventions (Yanos, 2023):

- Include contact (in person, but video can also be a feature if done right).

- Focus on a range of disorders, not just depression or mental illness broadly.

- Involve participation of people with “lived experience.”

- Target groups that have the most interaction or where lack of help-seeking is most problematic (e.g., young people, undocumented communities, military communities).

- Are tailored to be credible to specific language and cultural signifiers of the target group.

- Last several years in order to be effective.

Substantial research shows that knowing or having contact with someone with mental illness is one of the best ways to reduce stigma. Individuals speaking out and sharing their stories can have a positive impact. When we know someone with mental illness, it becomes less scary and more real and relatable.

Teens are searching for health information online and mental health issues are among the top searches, according to anational survey from Hope Lab(Hope Lab, 2021). About four in 10 teens said they have looked for people with similar health concerns. Many celebrities, such as Demi Lovato, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Michael Phelps, Taraji P. Henson and Lady Gaga have publicly shared their stories of mental health challenges and brought the discussion much more into the general media and everyday conversation. Young people are looking for information and for these personal stories online.

Recent studies have also shown the effectiveness of brief videos in reducing stigma.One studytracked more than 700 students across two years in a randomized controlled trial and found that watching videos of people sharing their personal experiences and videos with information on mental health improved students' mental health care access (da Conceição, et al 2023). The researchers found that the intervention was particularly effective for those in need, enabling them to recognize their need for care and behave accordingly.Another studyfound that a video featuring an actor sharing a story was as effective as a person with lived experience. (Amsalem, et al 2023).

Social marketing campaigns can also be effective. For example, aresearch studylooked at the effectiveness of an anti-stigma social marketing campaign in California and found that the campaign increased service use by helping people better understand symptoms of distress and increasing awareness that help is available. (Collins, et al 2019). The researchers suggest that widespread exposure to the mental health campaign could significantly increase access to treatment.

### Individual Actions to Reduce Stigma

TheNational Alliance on Mental Illness(NAMI) offers some suggestions about what we can do as individuals to help reduce the stigma of mental illness:

- Talk openlyabout mental health, such as sharing on social media.

- Educate yourself and others– respond to misperceptions or negative comments by sharing facts and experiences.

- Be conscious of language– remind people that words matter.

- Encourage equalitybetween physical and mental illness – draw comparisons to how they would treat someone with cancer or diabetes.

- Show compassionfor those with mental illness.

- Be honest about treatment– normalize mental health treatment, just like other health care treatment.

- Let the media knowwhen they are using stigmatizing language presenting stories of mental illness in a stigmatizing way.

- Choose empowermentover shame – "I fight stigma by choosing to live an empowered life. To me, that means owning my life and my story and refusing to allow others to dictate how I view myself or how I feel about myself." – Val Fletcher.

### Employers who are leading efforts to address stigma offer some suggestions (CWMH):

- Tailor programs/approachesto your company culture and existing strengths.

- Mention your commitmentto leading a behaviorally healthy workplace every time you mention the company's commitment to its overall culture of health, attracting and retaining the best talent, and valuing its employees, etc.

- Train leadersto identify emotional distress and make referrals and to responding promptly and constructively to behavioral performance issues.

- Be welcomingof the need for accommodations. Train managers to respond appropriately
