During the last decade it has become more widely accepted that pet ownership and animal
assistance in therapy and education may have a multitude of positive effects on humans.
Here, we review the evidence from 69 original studies on human-animal interactions (HAI)
which met our inclusion criteria with regard to sample size, peer-review, and standard sci-
entiﬁc research design. Among the well-documented effects of HAI in humans of different
ages, with and without special medical, or mental health conditions are beneﬁts for: social
attention, social behavior, interpersonal interactions, and mood; stress-related parameters
such as cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure; self-reported fear and anxiety; and mental
and physical health, especially cardiovascular diseases. Limited evidence exists for positive
effects of HAI on: reduction of stress-related parameters such as epinephrine and norepi-
nephrine; improvement of immune system functioning and pain management; increased
trustworthiness of and trust toward other persons; reduced aggression; enhanced empa-
thy and improved learning. We propose that the activation of the oxytocin system plays a
key role in the majority of these reported psychological and psychophysiological effects of
HAI. Oxytocin and HAI effects largely overlap, as documented by research in both, humans
and animals, and ﬁrst studies found that HAI affects the oxytocin system. As a common
underlying mechanism, the activation of the oxytocin system does not only provide an
explanation, but also allows an integrative view of the different effects of HAI.

Keywords: human-animal interaction, animal-assisted interventions, animal-assisted therapy, oxytocin, pet own-
ership, stress reduction

INTRODUCTION
During the last decades, animal assistance in therapy, education,
and care has greatly increased. Today, the value of animal-assisted
interventions [AAI, including animal-assisted therapy (AAT) and
activities] is widely acknowledged. In the light of the rapid devel-
opment of the practice of AAI, research evaluating the effects of
AAIs as well as studies investigating the basic effects of human-
animal interaction (HAI) and the underlying mechanisms seem
to lag behind. Still, there is already quite a body of scientiﬁc lit-
erature on this topic. However, this is spread out over a number
of journals and ﬁelds, constraining an integrative view. In the fol-
lowing, we will provide an overview of studies assessing effects of
AAI as well as pet ownership which meet certain scientiﬁc criteria.
In addition, we propose a common underlying mechanism for the
majority of the positive effects of HAI: i.e., the activation of the
oxytocinergic system and its role in social stress modulation. This
system can be linked directly to many of the observed physiolog-
ical effects of HAI and may also be indirectly associated with the
other, mainly psychological, effects. Thereby, we provide a coher-
ent body of theory for integrating the diverse endocrinological,
psychophysiological, and psychosocial effects of HAI found in dif-
ferent studies. Furthermore, we give a well-founded overview of

scientiﬁcally documented effects of HAIs which today are a quite
popular topic in the general literature, as are ﬁrst speculations
on underlying mechanisms including the oxytocin system (e.g.,
Olmert, 2009).

We will start our rationale with a review of the literature on
effects of HAI and thereafter we will present a short overview
of the oxytocinergic system and its psychophysiological effects.
We propose that oxytocin (OT) release may contribute to explain
many of the effects of HAI documented by the studies included in
our review.

CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION OF STUDIES IN THIS REVIEW
In this review we focus on the effects of HAI on psychosocial
variables such as empathy and social interactions and on human
physical and mental health, including effects on hormones and
the autonomic nervous system assessed via variables such as heart
rate or blood pressure. Effects could result from either companion
animal ownership or animal contacts, in experimental settings or
animal-assisted interventions. Studies not directly related to these
topics were excluded, for example, on pet ownership and atti-
tudes toward smoking, or other variables which could indirectly
inﬂuence health or social contacts (e.g., Milberger et al., 2009;

www.frontiersin.org

July 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 234 | 1

Beetz et al.

Effects of human-animal interactions

Zimolag and Krupa, 2009). Furthermore, we excluded the follow-
ing contexts: reports on relations between human personality and
animal-related issues; the link between animal abuse and interper-
sonal violence; attitudes toward pets in general or in connection
with animal welfare.

The prime criterion for inclusion was the publication of the
original research in a peer-reviewed scientiﬁc journal. Mainly
Medline and PsychLit were used for the article searches. Search
terms were: HAI, AAT, animal-assisted activity, “therapeutic rid-
ing” and “equine facilitated therapy.” However, since we focus on
psychosocial and psychophysiological effects in this review, stud-
ies employing horses in physiotherapy with a mere assessment
of effects on movement or balance were excluded (e.g., Cherng
et al., 2004; Beinotti et al., 2010). From several hundred pub-
lications found via the terms “pet,” “cat,” or “dog” we included
relevant original research articles (see Table 1) as well as reviews
and meta-analyses. The second criterion was that the study design
allowed to attribute any effect found with a high probability to
the animal interaction rather than to any other possible con-
founding variable. Hence, studies with a pre-post-measurement
design, but without control group were excluded. The third cri-
terion for inclusion was a sample size of at least 10 subjects (per
group).

EFFECTS OF HUMAN-ANIMAL INTERACTION
EFFECTS ON SOCIAL INTERACTION
Interacting with animals inﬂuences social interaction between
humans and related factors important in this respect, such as trust,
empathy, aggression, and a positive mood.

Increased positive social attention from others and stimulation of
social behavior
A relatively large body of research investigated the effect of a
friendly animal on the perception of the human in its company and
on the stimulation of social behavior. This is also called the “social
catalyst effect” when it refers to the facilitation of interpersonal
interactions.

Hart et al. (1987) and Eddy et al. (1988), for example, showed
that the company of a service dog promoted friendly social atten-
tion, smiles, and conversation from others for persons in wheel-
chairs. Wells (2004) studied the behavior of 1800 strangers toward
a female experimenter in six different conditions: accompanied by
a Labrador retriever pup, by an adult Labrador, by an adult Rot-
tweiler, being in the presence of a teddy bear or a plant, or being
alone as control conditions. In the alone condition, the experi-
menter was ignored more than with the teddy or plant, but got
more attention in the company of a dog. The Rottweiler led to
more non-responses than the pup or the adult Labrador, which
elicited most smiles and verbal responses. Also, in a classroom of
ﬁrst-graders, the presence of a dog was associated with increased
attention toward the teacher in comparison to class in the absence
of the dog (Kotrschal and Ortbauer, 2003).

Interaction with an animal is per se a form of social behavior.
The following research assessed the effect of animal presence on
this aspect without further investigating effects in interpersonal
behavior. Children with autism interacted most frequently and for
the longest periods with a real dog in comparison to objects or

a person (Prothmann et al., 2009). Also children with pervasive
developmental disorders (including autism) were more playful in
interaction with a live dog compared to toys, and also more aware
of their social environment in the presence of the dog (Martin and
Farnum, 2002).

The following studies focused on the facilitation of interper-
sonal interaction by the presence of an animal, the social catalyst
effect. Among children with autism the presence of a dog during
occupational therapy was associated with greater use of language
and more social interaction (Sams et al., 2006). Similarly, thera-
peutic riding enhanced social motivation of children with autism
(Bass et al., 2009) and in children with various psychiatric diag-
noses psychotherapy sessions supported by the presence of a dog
promoted social extroversion (Prothmann et al., 2006).

In adult patients with chronic schizophrenia dog-assisted ther-
apy was linked to improvement in social contact, symptoms,
and quality of life related to social relationships, but in com-
parison to a control group without a dog differences were not
signiﬁcant (Villalta-Gil et al., 2009). In psychiatric inpatients, how-
ever, AAT lead to a signiﬁcant increase in interactions with other
patients over the course of 4 weeks in comparison to rehabilita-
tion without animals. This included smiles, sociability, helpfulness
toward others, activation and responsiveness (Marr et al., 2000).
Many animal-assisted interventions focus on elderly residents or
patients. The presence of an animal positively inﬂuenced, e.g.,
social interaction in elderly psychiatric inpatients (Haughie et al.,
1992) and verbal interaction among male nursing home residents
(Fick, 1993). A comparison of observations of AAT and non-AAT
recreational sessions in long-term care facilities showed that the
animal involvement was linked to more frequent initiation and
longer durations of conversations (Bernstein et al., 2000). Kramer
et al. (2009) also investigated visits by a person alone, in the com-
pany of a dog, and in the company of a robotic dog (AIBO) in
female nursing home residents with dementia. The visit of a per-
son with a live dog as well as a robotic dog led to more social
interaction than the person alone. From their reviews on the effects
of animals-assisted therapy on patients with dementia, Filan and
Llewellyn-Jones (2006) and Perkins et al. (2008) concluded that
AAT can beneﬁt these patients by increasing social behavior and
interaction.

Several studies assessed changes in social interaction not via
direct observation, but rather indirectly. Paul and Serpell (1996)
found that normal families who obtained a dog, 1 month later
engaged in more leisure activities together and their children were
more often visited by friends. In a classroom of ﬁrst-graders, the
presence of a dog led to a better social integration among students
as documented via indirect psychometric indicators (Hergovich
et al., 2002) as well as via direct behavior observation (Kotrschal
and Ortbauer, 2003). Also adults proﬁt from animal contact with
regard to social relationships, such as patients with substance abuse
in an AAT group program, who rated the therapeutic alliance with
the therapist as more positive after 26 sessions than the control
group without an animal present (Wesley et al., 2009). Fournier
et al. (2007) reported that prison inmates signiﬁcantly improved
in social skills via AAT and in normal adult couples, owning pets
stabilized the marriage after the children had left home (Na and
Richang, 2003).

Based on the presented evidence we conclude that contact
with companion animals holds the potential to promote social
interaction and functioning in children and adults with or without
mental health problems.

Increased trust and trustworthiness
Two studies meeting our criteria assessed whether the presence
of a friendly animal would increase trust toward other humans.

Schneider and Harley (2006) asked college students to rate the
trustworthiness of two different psychotherapists, each of them
depicted once with a dog present and once without the dog in a
video. When the dog was present, participants, particularly those
with the least positive attitude toward psychotherapists, reported
more general satisfaction with the therapist as well as more will-
ingness to disclose personal information. Gueguen and Cicotti
(2008) investigated the inﬂuence of the presence or absence of a

Effects of human-animal interactions

dog on social interaction, helping, and courtship behavior. In four
different experiments, experimenters asked strangers for money
in the street, young women for their phone numbers in public or
observed whether people would help to pick up coins a male exper-
imenter dropped on the street. The presence of the dog was linked
to a higher compliance with the request for the phone number
and a higher rate of helping behavior. In particular the compli-
ance with the request for the phone number can be interpreted as
an indication for increased trust and maybe also attraction of the
strangers toward an unfamiliar man accompanied by a dog, which
probably promoted his perception as a trustworthy person. These
ﬁrst ﬁndings indicate a sociopositive effect of dogs on trust and
prosocial behavior, but clearly, more research is needed.

Effects on empathy
Most studies on empathy and animal ownership are designed in a
way that they are not conclusive with regards to a direct inﬂuence
of pet ownership on the development of better empathic skills.
For example, Poresky and Hendrix (1990) assessed empathy in
young children via reports of their mothers and found that the
mere presence of a pet in the household was unrelated to empathy,
while the bond with the pet was positively related to empathy and
social competence. However, as the authors point out, it cannot
be deducted from such a survey-design that the effect is due to the
animal. This also applies to the studies by Paul (2000) or Daly and
Morton (2003, 2006, 2009). However, Hergovich et al. (2002) doc-
umented a positive effect of the presence of dogs in the classroom
on the development of empathy in children. When compared to a
control class, the class with the dogs showed higher scores in ﬁeld
independence and empathy toward animals. Field independence
was interpreted as an indicator of better empathy, since it assesses
one’s ability to distinguish between self and non-self, which is a
necessary prerequisite for sensitivity toward the moods and needs
of others. Clearly, more research with appropriate designs and
measures is needed to provide evidence for an effect of animal
contact on empathy.

Reduction of aggression
Only few results point to the potential of the presence of a friendly
animal to reduce aggression in humans. In two studies, effects of
the presence of friendly dogs on aggressive behavior in a classroom
of ﬁrst-graders were investigated via behavior observation and
reports of the classroom teacher (Hergovich et al., 2002; Kotrschal
and Ortbauer, 2003). In the presence of the dog, in comparison to
its absence, aggressive behavior was decreased.

Reduction of depression and promotion of a positive mood
In their meta-analysis Souter and Miller (2007) conclude that
animal-assisted interventions have the potential to signiﬁcantly
reduce depressive symptoms and also our present survey of the
literature meeting our criteria points in this direction.

Crowley-Robinson et al. (1996) found a decrease in depres-
sion over the course of 2 years in elderly residents of a nursing
home with a resident dog, but also in the home without a resi-
dent dog. Banks and Banks (2002, 2005) showed in two controlled
studies with patients in long-term care facilities that animal vis-
itation programs reduced feelings of loneliness. The effect was

stronger in individual dog visits than in group settings, probably
since persons had more intense interactions with the dogs in an
individual setting. This indicates also that animal visits reduce feel-
ings of loneliness per se, instead via facilitating social interactions
with the other group members. Elderly residents of an institu-
tion experienced a reduction in depression and improvement in
quality of life when caring for a canary for a period of 3 months
(Colombo et al., 2006). A companion bird also reduced depres-
sion in elderly adults after admission to a skilled rehabilitation
unit (Jessen et al., 1996). While with one’s own bird individual
interaction and stroking are possible, this is different in aviaries
which do not allow for direct contact. However, while the mere
presence of an aviary did not signiﬁcantly affect depression in a
Veteran’s Medical Center, the intensity of use of the aviary by the
elderly men was associated with reduced depression (Holcomb
et al., 1997).

Also in children and adults with physical or mental health
problems animal contact can improve mood. Nathans-Barel et al.
(2005) found that a 10-week AAT-program for patients with
chronic schizophrenia improved the mood in comparison with
a group without AAT. Children with psychiatric disorders showed
better intra-emotional balance after only a single therapy session
with a dog (Prothmann et al., 2006). In hospitalized children, both,
AAT and traditional play therapy improved mood, as reported by
the parents and children themselves, but only AAT was associated
with display of positive affect (Kaminski et al., 2002).

ANTI-STRESS EFFECTS
A large body of studies investigated the effect of interacting with
animals on stress, operationalizing stress either via endocrinolog-
ical or cardiovascular parameters.

Effects of HAI on cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine
HAI has been investigated for its effects on hormonal indicators of
stress such as cortisol, and on neurotransmitters such as epineph-
rine and norepinephrine. First, studies not employing a speciﬁc
stressor, then studies including a stressor are reported. These
studies provide direct evidence that interaction with a friendly
companion animal, in particular a dog, positively affects endocrine
responses as indicated by changes in the levels of cortisol, epi-
nephrine and norepinephrine, suggesting an attenuation of stress
responses via HAI.

Barker et al. (2005) compared the effects of 20 min of quiet rest
to 5 and 20 min interaction with a therapy dog in healthcare pro-
fessionals. Before (baseline), during and after the interaction or
resting, serum cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine as well
as salivary cortisol were collected. A signiﬁcant reduction of serum
and salivary cortisol, but no effects on the other parameters, were
found in the dog conditions. Odendaal (2000) and Odendaal and
Meintjes (2003) assessed changes in plasma cortisol in dog owners
when petting their own, or an unfamiliar dog, or quietly reading
a book. The interaction with their own dog, and also with the
unfamiliar dog, but not the reading condition led to a signiﬁcant
decrease in the cortisol levels of the humans. Viau et al. (2010)
investigated cortisol levels of children with autistic-spectrum dis-
order before and after the introduction of a service dog into their
families and after the dog was removed for a short period of time.

Effects of human-animal interactions

While no change in the average diurnal cortisol levels due to the
intervention or the dog’s removal was observed, the change in cor-
tisol levels after waking up (cortisol awakening response) dropped
signiﬁcantly from 58 to 10% in the morning when the dog was
present in the family, and increased back to 48% upon removal of
the dog.

A study by Cole et al. (2007) compared a visit with a dog to a
visit without a dog and the usual care in the hospital as control
conditions among adults hospitalized with heart failure, which
can be seen as a naturally occurring stressor. Signiﬁcantly lower
epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were measured during and
after the dog visits. The effect of social support by a dog in com-
parison to support by a friendly human during a social stress test
on the cortisol levels of children with insecure attachment repre-
sentations was investigated by Beetz et al. (2011). The support by
a friendly dog during the experiment was associated with signiﬁ-
cantly lower cortisol levels than support by a friendly human. This
effect was strongly correlated with the time the children spent in
physical contact with the dog during the experiment.

Effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rate variability
A substantial number of well-designed studies investigated the
effect of HAI on blood pressure and heart rate, some also included
skin temperature or skin conductance, either in the absence of a
speciﬁc stressor or during a stress-inducing task.

Friedmann et al. (1983) investigated the effect of the presence
of a dog on children while they were reading or resting. Blood
pressure was lower when the dog was present during the entire
time than when the animal was just introduced during the second
half of the observation time. Grossberg and Alf (1985) compared
the effect of stroking a dog vs. resting, chatting, or reading in
undergraduate students. Blood pressures were signiﬁcantly lower
when stroking a dog than when chatting or reading, however, it
was lowest during rest. A positive attitude toward companion ani-
mals was associated with lower mean arterial pressure and systolic
blood pressure. Vormbrock and Grossberg (1988) assessed heart
rate and blood pressure while undergraduates interacted with a
dog visually, verbally, or tactually. Blood pressure was highest while
talking to the experimenter and lowest during stroking the dog.
Kaminski et al. (2002) found that in AAT heart rate of hospital-
ized children decreased and a display of positive affect increased,
while this was not the case in play therapy. In adults hospitalized
with heart failure, a 12-min visit by a person with a dog led to a
greater decrease in systolic pulmonary artery pressure during and
after the visit when compared to a visit by a person alone (Cole
et al., 2007). Motooka et al. (2006) employed heart rate variability
as a parameter associated with autonomic nervous system arousal
in healthy elderly adults walking with or without an unfamiliar
dog for 30 min. While walking the dog, heart rate variability was
signiﬁcantly higher than when walking alone. Generally, higher
heart rate variability indicates a relaxed state and an increase of
parasympathetic activity. Jenkins (1986) found that blood pres-
sure was signiﬁcantly lower when stroking one’s own dog at home
than while reading aloud. Similarly, Handlin et al. (2011) showed
that stroking ones’ own dog for just 3 min led to decreased heart
rates 55 min later in female dog owners, while no such response
was observed in a control group not petting a dog.

The following studies assessed the effect of interactions with
unfamiliar animals on heart rate and blood pressure before, dur-
ing or after a stressor. Nagengast et al. (1997) found heart rate and
systolic blood pressure of 3–6 year-old children during a standard-
ized physical examination as a mild natural stressor to decrease
more in the company of a friendly dog than when undergoing this
examination alone at another time. In a similar study, Hansen et al.
(1999) compared blood pressure, heart rate, and ﬁngertip temper-
ature between two groups of 2–6 year-old children undergoing a
standard physical examination, one group in company of a friendly
dog present during the examination, the other group without a
dog. Behavior observation documented less behavioral distress
when the dog was present. However, there were no signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in the physiological parameters between the two groups.
Havener et al. (2001) studied the peripheral skin temperature as
indicator of autonomic nervous system arousal during a dental
procedure in children age 7–10. The intervention group had a dog
beside them during the procedure, while children in the control
group had no dog or a supportive person present. Only children
who had stated before the procedure that they were stressed by
having to come to the dentist showed a signiﬁcant attenuation
of the stress response, measured as less decrease in skin tempera-
ture; the presence of the dog was observed for the time while the
children waited for the dentist to arrive. At the group level, the
intervention group did not signiﬁcantly differ from the control
group. Demello (1999) studied adults while they were recovering
from a cognitive stressor under three conditions, with a pet present
and only visual contact allowed, or with tactile contact allowed; in
the third condition no pet was present. As expected, the cognitive
stressor led to an increase in heart rate and blood pressure and
these parameters decreased most in the condition where the pet
was present but no tactile contact was allowed. Stroking the animal
did not affect blood pressure, but resulted in a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion of heart rate. Straatman et al. (1997) however, found no effect
on heart rate and blood pressure in a group of male students who
had a friendly, unfamiliar dog present during a stressful speech
task in comparison with a control group without a dog.

Studies investigating the effect of an aquarium in the room
differ from others due to the species and restricted possibilities
for contact. In a sample of elderly adults, DeSchriver and Riddick
(1990) compared the effects of watching an aquarium, a ﬁsh video-
tape, or a control tape on heart rate, skin temperature, and muscle
tension. While the group observing the real aquarium showed
a trend for lower heart rate and muscle tension as well as for
an increase in skin temperature, none of the group comparisons
reached statistical signiﬁcance. Similarly, Barker et al. (2003b)
found no signiﬁcant effect of an aquarium on heart rate or blood
pressure in psychiatric patients waiting for an electroconvulsive
therapy session.

The effect of the presence of one’s own pet vs. the presence of a
friend or being alone on heart rate, blood pressure, and skin con-
ductance during an arithmetic, stress-inducing task performed at
home and in the laboratory, was studied by Allen et al. (1991). At
home, pulse rate, blood pressure, and skin conductance were lower
in the presence of the pet than when alone or with a friend. Allen
et al. (2002) investigated the effect of two stressors (an arithmetic
task and putting the hand into ice-water for 2 min) in married

Effects of human-animal interactions

couples, either in the presence of a friend, their own pet, or the
spouse. In the presence of their pets, pet owners showed signif-
icantly lower heart rate and blood pressure before the task, less
increase in reaction to the stressor and a faster recovery than the
non-pet-owning participants who had a friend present. Among
pet owners the presence of the pet attenuated the stress response
more than the presence of the spouse. Hypertensive patients proﬁt
from acquiring and having a pet with regard to stress-related para-
meters such as heart rate blood pressure and plasma renin activity,
an indicator of hypertension. In a study by Allen et al. (2001) all
hypertensive participants showed similar reactions toward a men-
tal stressor before acquiring a pet. Then all participants started to
take medication for hypertension and half of the group was moti-
vated to acquire a pet. After half a year the stress task was repeated
in the homes of the participants. The pet owners had their pet
present during the task and showed lower blood pressure than
the control group. Their cardiovascular reactivity to the stressor
was lowered by half. Also, heart rate and plasma renin activity was
lower in the presence of the pet.

Overall, most of these studies show that the presence of friendly
animals, both familiar or unfamiliar, can effectively reduce heart
rate and blood pressure or buffer increases in these parameters in
anticipation of a stressor. These effects may even be stronger with
one’s own pet.

EFFECTS ON ANXIETY AND PAIN
Reduction of fear and anxiety and promotion of calmness
Several studies investigated whether animal contact can reduce
fear and anxiety elicited by a stressor. Shiloh et al. (2003) ﬁrst
showed participants a live tarantula spider and indicated that they
might be asked to hold it later on. Participants were randomly
assigned to ﬁve groups, and instructed to pet either a live rabbit,
a live turtle, a toy rabbit, a toy turtle, or to just rest. Only petting
a live animal, but not a toy animal reduced self-reported anxiety.
Therefore, not the physical activity of petting per se caused the
effect. Similarly, Barker et al. (2003a) investigated self-reported
anxiety in psychiatric patients before electroconvulsive therapy.
One group interacted with an animal for 15 min while the control
group read magazines. Interacting with the animal signiﬁcantly
reduced anxiety and fear. In contrast, Straatman et al. (1997) did
not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect on self-reported anxiety in male stu-
dents during a stressful speech task, when comparing a group in
the presence of an unfamiliar dog with a group without a dog
present.

In a few studies the effect of animal presence or contact on
self-reported anxiety in humans in the absence of a speciﬁc stres-
sor was investigated. Cole et al. (2007) compared the effects of
a 12-min visit with a dog or without a dog, with conditions of
normal care in adult patients who had been hospitalized due
to heart failure (which, however, could be interpreted as a nat-
ural stressor). Anxiety was reduced most in the presence of the
visiting dog. In undergraduate students a comparison of read-
ing quietly, reading aloud, and interacting with a dog (Wilson,
1991) did not show a signiﬁcant effect of the animal contact on
anxiety when compared to reading quietly. Also Barker and Daw-
son (1998) found no statistically signiﬁcant difference in anxiety

between AAT in comparison to therapeutic recreation in psychi-
atric inpatients. However, anxiety decreased from the beginning to
the end of the animal-assisted session, while this was not the case
in the control condition. In a study by Lang et al. (2010) patients
with acute schizophrenia reported less anxiety after a clinical inter-
view, when it was conducted in the presence of a friendly dog than
without. Berget et al. (2011) compared effects of a 12-week inter-
vention program with farm animals in psychiatric patients with
various diagnoses with a control group and found a decrease in
anxiety, however, not directly after the intervention, but 6 months
later.

As mentioned above, aquaria have limited potential in HAI.
Still, Barker et al. (2003b) showed that in a waiting room, an aquar-
ium can reduce anxiety in psychiatric inpatients before a scheduled
electroconvulsive therapy. Edwards and Beck (2002) documented
a higher food intake and weight gain, and a reduced require-
ment of nutritional supplementation in patients with Alzheimer’s
Disease after the introduction of an aquarium into the facility.
This ﬁnding may be interpreted as an increase in calmness, since
Alzheimer patients are often agitated and confused and this inter-
feres with food intake, leading to problems with malnutrition and
weight loss.

A similar effect of a friendly animal on calmness, the opposite
of anxiety, was documented by a study by Crowley-Robinson et al.
(1996). The elderly residents of a nursing home with a resident
dog, reported less tension and confusion in comparison to res-
idents of a home without a dog. Also Perkins et al. (2008) and
Filan and Llewellyn-Jones (2006) concluded from their reviews
that dog-assisted therapy reduces restlessness in elderly patients
with dementia.

Overall, the majority of studies points to a positive effect of
interactions with and observation of animals on self-reported
anxiety and calmness, in particular under stress-prone conditions.

Effects on perception of pain
Unfortunately, none of the few existing studies on effects of animal
contact on human pain management met our inclusion criteria.
However, reports point at a possible positive effect, indicating a
reduced use of pain medication, especially in nursing homes and
homes for the elderly (e.g., Darrah, 1996) with the presence of pets.

EFFECTS ON LEARNING
Little research addresses animals’ positive effects on learning in
children. However, there is some indirect evidence that animals
could positively affect the preconditions for learning. In a series
of studies, Gee and colleagues investigated the effect of the pres-
ence of a dog on children performing different tasks. A group
of developmentally delayed and a group of normally developed
children performed faster in a motor skill task with the same accu-
racy when a dog was present than when no dog was present (Gee
et al., 2007). According to the authors, one explanation could be
that the dog served as an effective motivator, another that the
presence of the dog led to increased relaxation and a reduction
of stress during execution of the task thus increasing speed of
performance. Also pre-school children with and without language
impairments adhered to instructions during an imitation task bet-
ter in the presence of a dog than in the presence of a toy dog or a

human (Gee et al., 2009). They needed fewer prompts (as an indi-
cator of concentration) for a memory task in the presence of a dog,
while they needed the most prompts in the presence of another
human (Gee et al., 2010b). Furthermore, in a match-to-sample task
pre-school children made fewer errors, such as irrelevant choices,
in the presence of a friendly dog in comparison to the presence of
a stuffed toy dog or a human (Gee et al., 2010a). In line with these
results, Kotrschal and Ortbauer (2003) found that children paid
more attention to the teacher when a dog was present in the class-
room and overall, we propose that some of the found effects of Gee
and colleagues could also be based on increased social attention
toward the experimenter in the dog condition.

Currently, there is no direct evidence that animals can promote
learning in humans, but the presence of a dog in an educational
setting seems to support concentration, attention, motivation, and
relaxation reﬂecting reduction of high stress levels which inhibit
effective learning and performance. Also, the presence of a dog
creates a pleasant social atmosphere, which is known to be an
essential component for optimal executive functioning (Diamond
and Lee, 2011), which represents a precondition for learning.

EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH AND RESTORATION
Already in the 1980s researchers tested the idea that pet owner-
ship is good for the owner’s mental and physical health. However,
many of these studies suffered from the problem of confound-
ing variables, such as the individual’s health condition which may
inﬂuence the decision to get a pet. Such studies, some of them
large surveys with thousands of participants, were conducted by
Garrity et al. (1989); Raina et al. (1999); Parslow et al. (2005);
Siegel (1990); Stallones et al. (1990), and Wineﬁeld et al. (2008).
Their ﬁndings generally suggest that companion animal own-
ers have better health than non-animal owners, as indicated by
medical markers such as cholesterol levels, or indirectly, via the
frequency of doctor visits. However, these correlative studies do
not allow making a causal connection between pet ownership and
health.

Original studies on health effects of companion animals
Headey and his colleagues investigated health effects of pet own-
ership in several surveys with large and representative samples,
while statistically controlling for most confounding variables and
thus allowing for a more causal interpretation of pet ownership
and health. In over 1000 adult Australians Headey (1999) found
that dog and cat owners paid fewer annual doctor visits and were
less likely to take medication for sleeping problems than non-pet
owners. In a survey with over 3000 female participants between
25 and 40 years of age from Chinese cities, Headey et al. (2008)
report that dog owners, who comprised half of the sample, had
higher self-reported ﬁtness and health, exercised more frequently,
slept better, saw their doctors less frequently, and took fewer days
off from work than comparable non-dog owners.

Another approach focuses on certain sub-populations with a
well-deﬁned social or health condition, which can contribute to a
better comparability of pet-owners and non-owners with respect
to many confounding variables. In their sample of empty-nesters,
i.e., families in which the children have left home, Na and Richang
(2003) found that pet-owning couples showed better mental and

physical health than those not owning a pet. From a longitudinal
survey in Australia and Germany in which the same group was
questioned a second time after several years, Headey and Grabka
(2007) reported that the healthiest group in both countries was
the one who continuously owned a pet. They reported 15% fewer
annual doctor visits than non-owners, while the inﬂuence of gen-
der, age, marital status, income, and other variables associated with
health was statistically controlled. Persons who never had a pet or
ceased to have one were less healthy.

In children with cerebral palsy a 10-week therapeutic riding
program had no effect on general health and quality of life in
comparison to a control group (Davis et al., 2009). However, indi-
rect indicators of mental health, self-efﬁcacy and coping ability,
had signiﬁcantly improved 6 months after the end of a 12-week
intervention with farm animals in psychiatric patients in compar-
ison with a control group, while directly after the intervention no
signiﬁcant differences between the two groups were found (Berget
et al., 2008). In elderly patients with schizophrenia, AAT in weekly
4 h sessions over the course of 12 months improved adaptive func-
tioning, which is frequently used as a global indicator of mental
health and describes a person’s ability to take care of him- or herself
and to effectively interact with society (Barak et al., 2001).

Reviews on health effects of human-animal interactions
In two review articles on pet ownership and human health, Wells
(2007, 2009) concluded that there is evidence supporting the pro-
phylactic and therapeutic value of companion animals to humans
without providing direct evidence for a causal association. Nimer
and Lundahl (2007) concluded from their meta-analysis of 49
studies that animal-assisted interventions (excluding pet owner-
ship or mere animal-assisted activities) showed positive health
effects, often with medium effect sizes for persons of all ages with
regard to emotional well-being, medical conditions, behavioral
problems, and symptoms of autistic-spectrum disorder.

Cardiovascular disease and human-animal interaction
Evidence for the effects of HAI on cardiovascular diseases was
gained from the following studies: Headey (1999) found that
dog and cat owners were less likely to take medication for heart
problems than non-pet owners. Friedmann and Thomas (1998)
investigated 1-year-survival in a group of several hundred patients
with acute myocardial infarction. High social support and owning
a dog, but not a cat, predicted survival after 1 year. In their review
of research on “pet therapy,” Giaquinto and Valentini (2009) come
to the conclusion that there is consistent evidence for a protective
effect of pet ownership against cardiovascular risk.

Effects of human-animal interaction on the immune system
Only one study assessing parameters of the immune system met
our inclusion criteria. Charnetski et al. (2004) reported a signiﬁ-
cant increase in salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA), an indicator
of good immune system functioning, in college students after
stroking a live dog in comparison to stroking a stuffed dog or
sitting quietly for 18 min.

SUMMARY OF EFFECTS OF HUMAN-ANIMAL INTERACTION
The studies reviewed here clearly indicate the following positive
effects of HAI in several different domains and in humans of

Frontiers in Psychology | Psychology for Clinical Settings

July 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 234 | 10

Beetz et al.

Effects of human-animal interactions

different age groups, with and without special medical, or mental
health conditions:

– improvement of social attention, behavior, interpersonal inter-

action, and mood

– reduction of stress-related parameters such as cortisol, heart

rate, and blood pressure

– reduction of self-reported fear and anxiety
– improvement of mental and physical health, especially cardio-

vascular health.

Limited evidence or very few publications exist for positive

effects of HAI on:

– reduction of stress-related parameters such as epinephrine and

norepinephrine

– improvement of immune system functioning
– improved pain management
– increased trustworthiness of and trust toward other persons
– reduced aggression
– enhanced empathy and
– improved learning.

We propose that most of these effects of HAI may be mediated
via the OT system and that the activation of this system represents
the mechanism underlying these effects. Exceptions are the studies
involving aquaria or aviaries which do not allow for direct con-
tact. The calming effects of observing ﬁsh or birds are likely mainly
based on other mechanisms than the activation of the OT system.
It needs to be mentioned here that obviously the reported stud-
ies worked with an optimal setting, i.e., persons who voluntarily
participate and can be assumed to have an at least neutral to posi-
tive attitude toward the involved species and no fear of the involved
animals. Stress-reducing and calming effects of e.g., dogs cannot
be expected in persons with a dog phobia. This self-selection lim-
its the generalization to the entire population, however, it seems
plausible to assume that the reported effects can be found in per-
sons with a similar neutral to positive attitude toward animals.
Also familiarity with the animal species might have an inﬂuence
in this respect. Furthermore, also the involved animals, partic-
ularly if they do not belong to the participants, usually meet
high standards, meaning they are obedient, calm, friendly, healthy,
and well-socialized with humans with special needs and diseases.
Therefore not all results from experimental settings can be gen-
eralized to every privately kept companion animal, or at least the
positive effects might be blunted by a pet’s behavior or health
problems.

THE OXYTOCIN SYSTEM
The peptide hormone oxytocin (OT) is produced in the hypothal-
amus and released into the circulatory system and the brain in
response to sensory stimulation via a network of OT-containing
nerves (Landgraf and Neumann, 2004; Ross et al., 2009), e.g., dur-
ing breastfeeding, labor, sex, but also touch, warmth, and stroking,
usually in the context of trusting relationships (for reviews see
Uvnäs-Moberg, 2003; Insel, 2010). Many physiological, psycho-
logical and behavioral functions are modulated via OT, as has
been shown via experimental administration of OT in animals
and humans.

EFFECTS ON SOCIAL INTERACTION
Among the acute effects of OT is the stimulation of social inter-
action. It increases eye contact, empathy, face memory, trust,
social skills, positive self-perception, and generosity and decreases
depression (Heinrichs et al., 2003; Kosfeld et al., 2005; Ohlssson
et al., 2005;Zak et al., 2005, 2007; Domes et al., 2007; Guastella et al.,
2008; Jonas et al., 2008; Savaskan et al., 2008; Rimmele et al., 2009;
Cardoso et al., 2011). Also, it counteracts aggression (Petersson
et al., 1998) and improves learning by conditioning (Björkstrand
et al., 1996;Petersson et al., 1996, 1999; Uvnäs-Moberg et al.,
2000). OT promotes maternal care behavior (Pedersen et al., 1982;
Fahrbach et al., 1984) and bonding to the offspring (Kendrick et al.,
1986, 1997; Keverne and Kendrick, 1992) as well as pair bonding
(Carter et al., 1995).

ANTI-STRESS EFFECTS
Furthermore, OT has anti-stress effects. It decreases glucocorticoid
(i.e., stress hormone) levels in humans and non-human animals
(Legros et al., 1988; Petersson et al., 1999; Neumann et al., 2000),
in particular in response to social stressors (Heinrichs et al., 2003;
Kirsch et al., 2005). When administered intracerebroventricularly,
OT decreases blood pressure for several hours (Petersson et al.,
1999) as well as heart rate (Dreifuss et al., 1988), and increases
peripheral cutaneous circulation and skin temperature (Petersson
et al., 1999).

EFFECTS ON ANXIETY, PAIN, AND IMMUNE SYSTEM
Oxytocin increases pain thresholds and has an anti-inﬂammatory
effect in rats (Petersson et al., 1996, 2005). It has also an anxiolytic
effect (Uvnäs-Moberg et al., 1994; Neumann et al., 2000; Amico
et al., 2004; Jonas et al., 2008; Guastella et al., 2009), in particular
in relation to social threats (Kirsch et al., 2005).

EFFECTS ON HEALTH AND RESTORATION
Furthermore, OT is associated with increases in the function of the
parasympathetic nervous system controlling the endocrine system
of the gastrointestinal tract, which is linked to an enhanced diges-
tive function and growth and restoration (Widstrom et al., 1988;
Uvnäs-Moberg, 1989, 1994).

As this short overview of OT-mediated effects shows there is a
major overlap of effects of HAI and OT and the following research
shows that indeed HAI may activate the OT system in humans.

EFFECTS OF HAI ON OXYTOCIN
Odendaal (2000); Odendaal and Meintjes (2003) documented a
signiﬁcant increase of plasma OT, as well as prolactin, phenylacetic
acid, and dopamine, in both, humans and dogs after 5 to 24 min
of stroking a dog. Interaction with one’s own dog resulted in a
stronger effect than stroking an unfamiliar dog. This indicated
that the increase in OT depends on the quality of the human-
animal relationship – the closer the relationship, the more OT is
released via the positive interaction including physical contact.

Miller et al. (2009) studied changes of plasma OT via inter-
action with the person’s own pet-dog, in men and women after
coming home from work who had been separated from their dog
during the day. Two conditions, interacting with the dog and read-
ing quietly in the absence of the dog were compared. Interacting

Effects of human-animal interactions

with the dog led to an increase in plasma OT in women, but not
men, while this was not observed in the reading condition. In both
conditions, men even showed a drop in OT levels. However, OT
levels decreased more in the control condition, pointing toward a
counteracting effect of interacting with the dogs on the OT system
also in men.

In their study of female dog owners, who were instructed to
stroke and talk to their own male dogs for 3 min in a laboratory
setting, Handlin et al. (2011) found a signiﬁcant increase in plasma
OT in both women and dogs, but not in a control group without
animal interaction.

Nagasawa et al. (2009) employed urinary OT to assess the effect
of 30 min of interaction between dogs and their owners, particu-
larly the duration of friendly gazes from the dogs to the owners.
In a control condition lasting for 30 min, owners were instructed
not to look at their dogs directly. Participants were divided into
owners who were less attached and received a shorter duration of
gaze from their dogs and owners who received a longer duration of
gaze from their dog and reported a higher degree of attachment to
them. In the normal interaction condition, longer gaze was linked
to higher OT levels in the owner, while this was not the case in the
control condition without eye contact.

It needs to be mentioned that measuring urinary OT is not gen-
erally accepted as a valid approach to assess peripheral OT. Indeed,
Feldman et al. (2011) found no signiﬁcant correlation between
urinary OT and plasma or salivary OT, but a moderate correla-
tion of the latter two. The techniques for assessing OT levels differ
between the studies reported above and thus did not necessarily
measure exactly the same, which needs to be kept in mind when
comparing their results (Uvnäs-Moberg et al., 2011).

Overall, the studies suggest that social interaction of humans
and dogs may lead to an increase in OT levels in both, the human
and the dog. Physical contact and the relationship between owner
and dog seem to play an important role in this respect.

CONCLUSION
Research on direct OT effects in HAI is still rare. But the exist-
ing evidence clearly points at the potential of interactions with
animals, especially one’s own pet-dog, to increase OT levels in
humans. We propose that the release of OT via contact with
animals may contribute to explain many of the effects of HAI doc-
umented by the studies included in our review. There is also much
indirect evidence on a potential link of HAI effects and the OT sys-
tem. In fact, the effects of OT and of HAI largely correspond. Both,
HAI and OT, were found to promote social interaction, to reduce

stress and anxiety, and to enhance human health. OT is released
via eye contact, but in particular, via pleasant tactile interactions
which seem to play a major role for the OT-mediated decrease of
stress levels. Oxytocin effects may be triggered in response to sin-
gle meetings with animals, but stable relationships with animals
such as pet ownership will be linked to more potent and long last-
ing effects due to repeated exposure to OT. In addition, the bond
between human and animal may contribute to OT release and oxy-
tocin mediated effects. HAI effects are stronger with a familiar dog
in comparison to an unfamiliar dog. That the OT system plays a
major role in social bonds has been documented by several studies
(e.g., Carter, 1998; Carter and Keverne, 2002; Bales et al., 2007).

Overall, we propose that the reduction of subjective psycho-
logical stress (fear, anxiety) due to animal contact, as well as
the dampening of physiological stress parameters in connection
with activation of the OT system represent a core mechanism in
explaining many of the positive effects of HAI. These mechanisms
have also be linked to other constructs such as e.g., attachment
theory, biophilia (Wilson, 1984), social support theories (Wills,
1991), the polyvagal theory (Porges, 1995, 2007, 2009) and the
social baseline model (Coan, 2008, 2010, 2011) by a large body
of studies which focus on stress regulation via social support
(Wills, 1991) and via bonds within one’s own species Julius et al.
(2012). The evidence reviewed here clearly indicates that these
mechanisms may also apply to some extent to HAI. Also, while
we believe that the activation of the OT system is a core mecha-
nism in explaining the majority of reported effects of HAI, we are
aware that it cannot explain all effects and that other mechanisms,
physiologically as well as psychologically based, are involved. Fre-
quently cited factors in research on HAI are e.g., the unconditional
love and acceptance which animals provide to clients of animal-
assisted interventions and their owners and the social catalyst
effect which might be initially based rather on biophilia than
the activation of the OT system. Biophilia can be described as
an interest in nature and animals and in seeking a connection
with them (Wilson, 1984). However, the activation of the OT
system via HAI as theoretic approach allows the integration of
many different research ﬁndings due to the large body of research
on OT in animal or human research which can serve as foun-
dation, which no other theory has been able to achieve until
now.
