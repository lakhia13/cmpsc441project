Meditation and mindfulness are practices that can support healthcare professionals, patients, carers and the general public during
times of crisis such as the current global pandemic caused by COVID-19. While there are many forms of meditation and mind-
fulness, of particular interest to healthcare professionals are those with an evidence base such as mindfulness-based stress reduction
(MBSR). Systematic reviews of such practices have shown improvements in measures of anxiety, depression and pain scores.
Structural and functional brain changes have been demonstrated in the brains of people with a long-term traditional meditation
practice, and in people who have completed a MBSR programme. Mindfulness and meditation practices translate well to different
populations across the lifespan and range of ability. Introducing a mindfulness and meditation practice during this pandemic has
the potential to complement treatment and is a low-cost beneficial method of providing support with anxiety for all.

Introduction

During the global pandemic, we have all had to change
how we live and work. Healthcare workers may be
overwhelmed, busy, fearful, coping and dividing their
lives. Patients with pre-existing anxiety, depression or
psychosis may feel overwhelmed by additional worry
or fear. People with substance abuse may turn increas-
ingly to whatever they can obtain to manage their own
addiction. Carers may have an additional burden of
care with loss of any time to themselves and loss of
supports. Household units are living in pressured envi-
ronments, not used to spending so much time in small
spaces. Children and adolescents have lost the structure
provided by school and may have their own worries
and fears, with loss of support external to their own
families. Older people have been cocooned away and
may have lost not only external support but may have
the perception that once you are over 70 you are
deemed vulnerable and no longer useful. Add financial
and employment instability into the mix and we have a
society structure that is challenged. Yet, despite the
despair, the fear and the anxiety, there have been glimp-
ses of a world with an increased sense of community
and kindness.

Meditation and mindfulness

Meditation and mindfulness are terms that have crept
into mainstream culture. These terms are often used
interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between

the two. Meditation usually refers to a formal practice
that can calm the mind and enhance awareness of our-
selves, our minds and our environment. Meditation in
its many guises has been practised over millennia by
diverse groups of people in many different traditions.
Previously practised primarily in the Eastern traditions,
meditation has spread into Western society and is
increasingly being used as a therapeutic modality.
‘Mindfulness’ as a term has become ubiquitous in recent
times. Mindfulness simply means being aware of the
present moment. Meditation comes under the umbrella
of ‘mindfulness’ which is a broader concept. Formal
meditation practices include mindfulness of breathing,
compassion or loving kindness-focused meditation, the
use of mantras or phrases as the focus for meditation,
amongst many others.

Underlying each of the different meditation tech-
niques is a simple coming to awareness of the present
moment. Being aware of what is happening in the
present moment allows the individual to observe what
is arising and what is falling away. By doing this and by
allowing thoughts to come and go without attachment,
without trying to hold on to them, we learn that calm
and stillness follows. We come to know our own minds
over time and to be aware of patterns of thinking that
habitually arise. The key is to gently catch a spiral of
thoughts, mind flurry or mind chatter, and observe,
noting ‘worry’, ‘lists’, ‘craving’, ‘fear’, and allow the
spiral to gently fall away without judgement. Useful
techniques in different forms of meditation include
mindfulness of breathing (using the breath as an anchor
to the present moment), compassion-focused medita-
tion (using loving kindness, and awareness of others’
and our own suffering to be in the present moment),

the body scan (being aware of each part of the body in
turn as an anchor for the present moment and for where
we hold tension and stress in our bodies). Other forms
include the use of mantras or phrases to focus attention
to the present moment, or walking meditation where
the entire focus is on awareness of our feet in contact
with the earth and grounding to the present moment.
Over time, regular practice of mediation allows individ-
uals to react to their environment and anything that
arises in the course of their day with more calm and
equanimity. Studies of people who have meditated
over the long-term show changes in areas of the brain
concerned with stress and anxiety (Afonso et al.
2020). The prefrontal cortex, the cingulate cortex and
the hippocampus show increased activity, and the
amygdala shows decreased activity consistent with
improved emotional regulation. Other studies have
shown that evidence-based therapies such as MBSR
also show similar brain changes to those with tradi-
tional meditation practice (Gotink et al. 2016).

As the term ‘meditation’ is so broad, and its thera-
peutic uses encompass many conditions including pain,
mental health and somatic conditions, research into
such heterogenous modalities and outcomes has been
difficult to conduct in a systematic scientific manner.
Recently, there have been more studies of better quality
resulting in randomised controlled trials and systematic
reviews. Practices such as MBSR and mindfulness-
based cognitive therapy (MBCT) have developed from
formal meditation practices. These are modularised
practices that are feasible to teach and lend themselves
more easily to evidence-based practice research. Both
are 8-week-long programmes of 2 hours duration a
week, with intensive 1-day teaching midway through
the programme, and with home practice. MBSR, origi-
nally developed by John Kabat-Zinn in the 1970s,
adapts formal meditation practices to give a more
generalised approach to mindfulness, and MBCT was
subsequently developed with more of a focus on
depression using a blend of cognitive and mindfulness
approaches.

The predominant symptoms presenting at this time
in many of our patients, in society and in ourselves are
anxiety, overwhelm and despair. These are natural
sequelae of existing in the time of a global pandemic
of what will be an uncertain duration. Systematic
reviews of meditation-based tools such as meditation
using focused attention, MBSR and MBCT have shown
reduced anxiety (Montero-Marin et al. 2019), depres-
sion and post-traumatic stress disorder (Khusid &
Vythilingam, 2016), stress (Juul et al. 2020), blood pres-
sure, cortisol levels and other physiologic markers of
stress (Pascoe et al. 2017). Having a regular meditation
practice can benefit people working in the health ser-
vice (Lomas et al. 2018) in addition to the benefits for

patients, the general population and those with pre-
existing mental illness. Meditation techniques are easy
to learn, easy to support online (Krusche et al. 2013;
Chadi et al. 2018, 2020; Champion et al. 2018), can be
done as an individual and there are benefits from a
group practice. Meditation techniques can be adapted
for adults, children, teens and those with intellectual
disabilities (Chadi et al. 2018; Singh & Hwang, 2020).
While MBSR and MBCT are usually taught face to face
by a certified professional, there has been increased
investigation of the use of meditation apps and online
eHealth and Telehealth in delivering such interventions
(Champion et al. 2018; Huberty et al. 2019). There are a
large number of meditation apps available, such as
Calm, Headspace and Insight Timer, that people can
use to support their own meditation practice. In such
times as the COVID-19 pandemic, these and other tech-
niques may be useful to support people. Preliminary
studies show benefit to people in areas such as sleep
from having a mindfulness practice (Zheng et al. 2020).
There are also a number of organisations offering
opportunities to create a pause in our lives such as
the Royal College of Physicians (#pauseforapoem),
reportedly with some interest and uptake. Places with
established traditions of teaching others secular, non-
secular and non-healthcare-based meditation and
mindfulness such as The Sanctuary and the Dublin
Buddhist Centre are offering online learning meditation
sessions at reduced cost or free. Anecdotally from these
centres, there has been a large increase in uptake of
these classes. As this pandemic is early in its infancy,
there is little peer-reviewed research to evaluate the
effects of these offerings, but they are certainly helpful
based on previous studies and could provide fruitful
areas of research interest.

Crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic have shown
that change is the only constant. Meditation and mind-
fulness can offer a helpful way to live with this constant
change. MBSR programmes already extant within ser-
vices can be adapted for online delivery. Meditation
apps and online classes can be recommended to
patients. Both learning and having a regular meditation
practice ourselves can only benefit our patients and our-
selves. Meditation and mindfulness are useful skills
that can help us to sit with our fears and our circumstan-
ces and to observe that like our thoughts, this period in
our lives too shall pass.
