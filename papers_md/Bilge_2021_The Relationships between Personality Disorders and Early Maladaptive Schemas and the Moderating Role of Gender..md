The Relationships between Personality Disorders and 
Early Maladaptive Schemas and the Moderating Role 
of Gender

ABSTRACT

Objective: The aims of this study were to examine the relationship between personality 
disorders (PDs) and early maladaptive schemas, to determine the early maladaptive sche-
mas that predict PDs, and to investigate the moderating role of gender in the relationship 
between PDs and early maladaptive schemas.

Methods: The sample consisted of 654 participants, 368 (56.4%) women and 286 (43.6%) 
men, aged 18-75 years, determined by the convenience sampling method. Data were col-
lected using Coolidge Axis II Inventory Plus Turkish Short Form and Young Schema Ques-
tionnaire-Short Form 3.

Results: From regression analysis, it was determined that each PD had a specific early mal-
adaptive schema profile. According to the analysis, the schema that predicts the most for 
paranoid, schizotypal, schizoid, antisocial, borderline, obsessive-compulsive, and avoidant 
PDs is social isolation/mistrust; for histrionic and narcissistic PDs, the schema is approval 
seeking, and for dependent PD, it is failure. The analysis related to the moderating role of 
gender indicated that for women, the emotional deprivation schema is a risk factor for 
paranoid PD, and the schemas of self-sacrifice, punitiveness, and unrelenting standards 
are the risk factors for avoidant PD.

Conclusion: This study discovered that some early maladaptive schemas were predictors 
of PDs and that gender had a moderating role in the relationship between these variables. 
It is thought that paying attention to the moderating role of gender and considering the 
specific schema profiles of each PD will be beneficial for intervention programs for early 
maladaptive schemas and understanding the etiology of PDs.

Introduction

Personality disorders (PDs) are defined as permanent, inelastic, and long-term life patterns 
that impair functionality and impact areas of cognition, interpersonal relationships, or im-
pulse control.1 It is accepted that the symptoms seen in PDs are associated with the activation 
of early maladaptive schemas, which have a complex structure and lead to chronic dysfunc-
tion in many areas of life.2 Early maladaptive schemas, formed as a result of the interaction 
between  early  childhood  experiences  and  temperament,  occur  as  a  result  of  not  meeting 
basic needs or because of negative experiences in childhood.3 As negative experiences are 
repeated,  schemas  which  help  a  person  better  understand  themselves,  other  people,  and 
the world,4 become rigid and resistant to change.2 It has been suggested that these schemas, 
which become disharmonious by losing their functionality, lie at the core of PDs that occur 
in adulthood.3, 5 

Young  et  al3  noticed  that  early  maladaptive  schemas  affecting  a  person’s  cognition,  emo-
tions, and social interaction6 also interrupt the therapy process. He found that, in addition 
to depression, his clients had PDs, and he preferred to define the self in parts that interacted

with each other functionally rather than consider it as a whole.2, 7 By 
observing his patients, Young et al3 identified a total of 18 subsche-
mas under five schema domains, which he claimed were associated 
with PDs.

It  is  seen  in  the  literature  that  the  number  of  studies  supporting 
Young et al’s3 claim that early maladaptive schemas are predictors of 
PDs has increased in recent years.8-18 In most of these studies, the re-
lationship between the schemas and borderline PDs was investigat-
ed.8-12, 14-17 When the studies in the literature are examined, it is seen 
that  in  some  studies  the  relationship  between  PDs  and  early  mal-
adaptive schemas has been examined,11, 12, 18-20 and in others, certain 
PDs have been compared in terms of early maladaptive schemas.14-16 
Moreover, some studies were conducted with control groups includ-
ed in the clinical studies.8, 13, 16, 17, 21 When the aforementioned studies 
were examined, it was found that PDs were associated with at least 
one schema and that the schemas between the clinical sample and 
the  control  group  differed.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  single  study 
conducted  in Turkey  examining  the  relationship  between  PDs  and 
early  maladaptive  schemas,21  it  was  found  that  the  early  maladap-
tive  schema  scores  of  the  sample  group  diagnosed  with  antisocial 
PD were significantly higher than the scores of the healthy sample 
group. There are also studies in the literature, in addition to these as-
sociative or comparative studies, that show that schema therapy is 
effective in PDs.12, 22-25 These studies that show the therapeutic effect 
of schema therapy on PDs also provide evidence of the link between 
PDs and early schemas in the field of clinical intervention.

In  addition  to  the  effects  of  gender  with  environmental  factors  on 
personality development,26 it is also known that gender is associated 
with PDs and early maladaptive schemas.27, 28 In addition to the dif-
ferent results seen in the literature, it has been determined that both 
PDs19,  29-33  and  early  maladaptive  schemas16,  19,  34-36  show  differences 
according to gender. For example, in a study conducted by Barnow et 
al,29 it was found that antisocial PD in men and avoidant PD in women 
are seen at high rates, whereas other studies have found narcissistic 
PD at high rates in men.30, 32 In a study by Samuels et al,37 it was deter-

mined that clusters A and B PDs are more common in men compared 
with  women.  In  a  study  that  examined  early  maladaptive  schemas 
in terms of gender,19 the abandonment schema was observed more 
frequently in men, whereas other schemas showed no difference in 
terms of gender. In another study, while emotional deprivation, so-
cial isolation, and mistrust schema scores were higher in women than 
men,35 in Khodarahimi’s16 study, it was found that mistrust and emo-
tional inhibition schemas were higher in women than men.

In line with the claims and findings presented in the studies in the 
literature on the relationships between PDs, early maladaptive sche-
mas, and gender, our study aimed to (1) determine the relationships 
between  early  maladaptive  schemas  and  all  PDs  in  the  Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5),1 (2) 
determine to what extent which early maladaptive schemas predict 
which PDs, and (3) examine the moderating role of gender in the re-
lationship between these two variables (Figure 1).

Methods

Participants
The sample consisted of 654 participants aged between 18-75 years, 
of which 368 were women (56.4%) and 286 were men (43.6%). The 
average age of the participants in the sample was 33.23 (SD = 11.84) 
years  (31.72  [SD  =  11.39]  for  women;  35.17  [SD  =  12.14]  for  men). 
Overall, 19.9% of the participants (n = 130) had primary education, 
28% (n = 183) had high school education, and 52.1% (n = 340) had 
university or a higher level of education; 47% (n = 306) were single, 
49.5% (n = 322) were married, 2.5% (n = 16) were separated from their 
spouses, and 1.1% (n = 7) were widowed; and 6.5% (n = 42) had low 
income, 86.9% (n = 566) had medium income, and 6.6% (n = 43) had 
high income. The data were collected between November 2019 and 
April 2020 from a sample of the population selected using the easy 
sampling method according to the accessibility-availability principle. 
The  ethics  committee  permission  for  this  study  was  obtained  from 
İstanbul Sabahattin Zaim University’s Ethics Committee, dated Octo-
ber 31, 2019, and numbered 2019/09.

  MAIN POINTS
• 

In this study, the relationship between personality disorders (PDs) 
and early maladaptive schemas was examined. And also the mod-
erating role of gender in the relationship between PDs and early 
maladaptive schemas was investigated. 

•  Some early maladaptive schemas are predictors of PDs and each 

PD has a specific early maladaptive schema profile. 

•  Gender has a moderating role between PDs and early maladap-

tive schemas. 

•  Our findings suggest that paying attention to the moderating role 
of gender and the specific schema profile of each PD might be use-
ful for intervention programs in the treatment of PDs.

Demographic Information Form
This form contains information about the participants’ age, gender, 
educational status, marital status, and socioeconomic status.

Coolidge Axis II Inventory Plus Turkish Short Form
The scale was developed into a short form38 to measure DSM-5 PDs 
based on the Coolidge Axis II Inventory Plus Turkish Form (CATI+TR), 
whose Turkish validity and reliability study was conducted by Bilge 
and  Berk.39  The  scale  is  a  4-point  Likert-type  scale  (1  =  absolutely 
false, 4 = absolutely true) and consists of 78 items and 10 subscales. 
In  the  test-retest  study  of  the  scale,  correlation  coefficients  were 
found to be between 0.77 and 0.89. The Cronbach alpha coefficients 
of the subscales were between 0.66 and 0.77. In the convergent va-
lidity analysis, the correlation coefficients between the CATI+TR+SF 
subscales  and  the  Personality  Belief  Questionnaire-Turkish  Short 
Form  subscales  ranged  between  0.35  and  0.64  and  between  0.27 
and  0.78  for  the  SCID-II-Personality  Questionnaire  subscales.  In  the 
differential validity analysis, it was determined that CATI+TR+SF PDs’ 
scores  were  significantly  higher  in  favor  of  the  clinical  sample,  and 
CATI+TR significantly differentiated the clinical and community sam-

were determined to be between 0.65 and 0.74.

the variables. The IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v.25 
(IBM Corp.; Armonk, NY, USA) program was used for analysis.

Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form 3
The Turkish  validity  and  reliability  study  of  the  scale  developed  by 
Young et al3 was conducted by Soygüt et al.5 The  scale is a 6-point 
Likert-type scale (1 = completely wrong for me, 6 = defines me per-
fectly)  and  consists  of  90  questions.  In  the  Turkish  adaptation  of 
the  scale,  five  schema  areas  and  14  subschemas  were  determined. 
Test-retest reliability correlation coefficients were determined to be 
between 0.66 and 0.83 for schema areas and between 0.66 and 0.82 
for  the  subschemas.  Internal  consistency  coefficients  were  deter-
mined as 0.53-0.81 for the schema areas and 0.63-0.80 for the sub-
schemas. In our study, the reliability coefficients for the Young Sche-
ma  Questionnaire-Short  Form-3  subschemas  were  found  to  range 
between 0.66 and 0.78.

Statistical Analysis
The  Pearson  product-moment  correlation  coefficient  analysis  was 
used to examine the relationship between PDs and early maladap-
tive  schemas;  multiple  linear  regression  analysis  with  the  stepwise 
method was used to determine the predictive level of early maladap-
tive schemas for PDs; and Model 1 in the PROCESS Macro v.3.4. pro-
gram40 was used to determine the moderating role of gender among

Results

Correlation Analysis Results of PDs and Early Maladaptive Schemas
As a result of the analysis conducted to examine the relationships be-
tween PDs and early maladaptive schemas, it was found that, except 
for the insignificant relationships between schizoid PD and approval 
seeking and abandonment schemas, all PDs and early maladaptive 
schemas had a significant and positive relationship in terms of results 
with different values of coefficients (Table 1). 

Regression Analysis Results on the Predictive Effect of Early Mal-
adaptive Schemas on PDs
On  the  basis  of  the  results  of  the  analysis  conducted  to  determine 
the level at which early maladaptive schemas predict PDs, the values 
of early maladaptive schemas and the total R2 values of the schemas 
that predict PDs are given in Table 2. From paranoid PD (β = -0.39; R2 
= 0.34), schizotypal PD (β = 0.35; R2 = 0.29), schizoid PD (β = 0.32; R2 
= 0.23), antisocial PD (β = 0.21; R2 = 0.21), borderline PD (β = 0.21; R2 
= 0.28), obsessive-compulsive PD (β = 0.19; R2 = 0.29), and avoidant 
PD (β = 0.14; R2 = 0.27), it was determined that the most predictive 
schema was the “social isolation/mistrust” schema. For the histrionic 
(β = 0.45; R2 = 0.31) and narcissistic (β = 0.38; R2 = 0.31) PDs, the most 
predictive schema was the “approval seeking” schema. As for the de-
pendent PD (β = 0.27; R2 = 0.30), the “failure” schema was determined 
as the most predictive schema. 

Findings  Regarding  the Regulatory  Role  of Gender between PDs 
and Early Maladaptive Schemas
As a result of the analysis conducted using Model 1 to determine the 
moderating role of gender on the relationship between PDs and ear-
ly  maladaptive  schemas,  it  was  determined  that  gender  does  have 
a moderating role in the relationship between some PDs and early 
maladaptive  schemas.  The  relationship  between  the  variables  is 
shown in Figure 2. According to the results of the analysis, in wom-
en, while the emotional deprivation schema (F = 45.579, R2 = 0.17) is

associated with an increase in paranoid PD, self-sacrifice (F = 14.695,

dards  (F  =  12.424,  R2 =  0.05)  schemas  were  found  to  be  associated

Discussion

This study aimed to determine the relationships between early mal-
adaptive schemas and PDs in DSM-51 to determine which early, mal-
adaptive schemas predicted which PDs at what level and to examine 
the moderating role of gender in the relationship between these two 
variables.

As a result of the analysis done for the first purpose, positive and sig-
nificant relationships between different coefficients were found for 
all PDs and all early maladaptive schemas, except for approval seek-
ing abandonment with schizoid PD. On the other hand, the lack of a 
relationship  between  schizoid  PD  and  approval  seeking  and  aban-
donment schemas can be explained by the characteristics of this PD 
given in the DSM-51 diagnostic criteria, such as disregarding praise or 
satire and preferring to be solitary and far from close relationships. 
However, when these relationships are evaluated in terms of the di-
mensional approach that treats personality and disorders as a contin-
uum, it is expected that early maladaptive schemas have a certain re-
lationship with PDs. At this point, regression analyses were also made 
to determine the schemas that show predictive features in the emer-
gence of each PD beyond determining the relationships seen, and as 
a result of these analyses, each PD’s unique maladaptive schema pro-
files were formed. When these profiles, which contain both common 
and different schemas, were examined, it was found that the schema 
that predicted paranoid, schizotypal, schizoid, antisocial, borderline, 
obsessive-compulsive, and avoidant PD the best was social isolation/
mistrust. The social isolation/mistrust schema may occur as a result 
of domestic abuse, exposure to peer bullying, or humiliation during 
childhood or adolescence.41 People with this schema are often anx-
ious and skeptical that other people might manipulate them for their 
own benefit. In addition, situations such as not belonging to a place 

or feeling alienated and seeing oneself as different from other people 
are  characteristic  of  people  with  this  schema.6,  7  Accordingly,  it  can 
be thought that interpersonal problems and maladaptive behaviors 
in these PDs are related to problems related to trust and reliability in 
social relationships, neglect, exploitation, and childhood abuse. The 
schema that best predicts histrionic PD and narcissistic PD is approv-
al seeking. This schema is often the result of parents’ excessive and 
persistent expectations about socially accepted behaviors.7 Social ac-
ceptance, appearance, and status are very important for people with 
this schema, and behaviors aimed at gaining the approval and appre-
ciation of other people are seen in these people.6 It can be thought 
that  the  chronic  need  for  the  approval  of  others  to  feel  valuable  is 
related  to  the  demands  such  as  being  the  center  of  attention  and 
being  admired,  which  is  the  diagnostic  criterion  of  these  two  PDs. 
The schema that best predicted the dependent PD was determined 
as failure. The failure schema often develops in a family environment 
where there is excessive criticism of success.7 Hypersensitivity to crit-
icism of self-worth is observed in people with this schema.41 It can 
be said that having this schema causes individuals to see themselves 
as unsuccessful, incompetent, and unskilled, to show submissive and 
clingy  behaviors,  and  to  feel  a  need  for  attention,1  which  leads  to 
fears of separation. The fact that the results obtained in this study are 
similar to those of the studies in the literature,11, 12, 15 that is, the level 
at which PDs predict similar schemas, is one of the reasons for the 
overlap of many characteristics of PDs and the high rate of comor-
bidity.42  It  gives  rise  to  the  idea  that  they  can  be  regarded  as “core 
maladaptive schemas” that lie in the background of PDs. As a result 
of the analysis, it was determined that the other predictive schemas 
following the schemas that predict the PDs in a common way came 
together in different combinations and created schema profiles spe-
cific to each PD. It can be said that the schema profile specific to each 
PD is descriptive and distinctive in causal terms. When the correlation 
and regression analysis results are evaluated, it is seen that Young et 
al’s3 claim that the activation of early maladaptive schemas, which in-
clude rigid and inflexible beliefs about the self, others, and the world, 
is effective in the emergence of symptoms seen in PDs, and his claim 
is confirmed.

In  the  analysis  on  the  moderating  role  of  gender  in  the  relation-
ship  between  PDs  and  early  maladaptive  schemas,  it  was  found 
that  in  women  the  risk  of  paranoid  PD  increases  related  to  emo-
tional  deprivation  schema,  and  the  risk  of  avoidant  PD  increases 
related  to  self-sacrifice,  punitiveness,  and  unrelenting  standards 
schemas. The emotional deprivation schema develops as a result 
of not meeting the basic needs of the person both physically and 
emotionally.6 Accordingly, it can be said that the emotional depri-
vation  schema  is  the  basis  of  the  development  of  paranoid  PD,1 
which is dominated by the fear of being harmed by other people, 
especially present in women, as they are known to have high lev-
els  of  anxiety  disorders.43,  44  Similarly,  it  can  be  thought  that  one 
of the factors that increases the likelihood of avoidant PD1 occur-
ring in women is the factor of gender. In addition, according to the 
results  obtained,  it  can  been  determined  that  self-sacrifice,  puni-
tiveness,  and  unrelenting  standards  schemas  increase  the  risk  of 
avoidant  PD  in  women. The  self-sacrifice  schema  often  develops 
in  environments  of  conditional  positive  respect  and  conditional 
positive  acceptance,  and  meeting  the  needs  of  others  is  a  prior-
ity  for  people  with  this  schema.41  Unrelenting  standards  and  pu-
nitiveness schemas develop mostly in environments where there 
are strict rules and emotions are suppressed. It is seen that these 
schemas develop through social learning, especially depending on 
parental attitudes, and people with these schemas exhibit their ex-
cessively critical attitudes and pressures against both themselves 
and  other  people.3  In  this  context,  it  can  be  said  that  in  families 
with strict rules, high standards, conditional positive respect, and 
acceptance, the risk of developing avoidant PD increases in wom-
en with the fear of punishment and also with the effect of genetic 
factors and gender roles.

In  conclusion,  the  findings  obtained  in  our  study  showed  that 
some early maladaptive schemas are predictors for PDs, and there-
fore, for each PD, there is a specific early maladaptive schema pro-
file, and gender has a moderating role in the relationship between 
these  two  variables.  The  most  important  limitation  of  this  study 
was that the data were collected through self-report scales, and a 
clinical sample was not included. It should be noted that the rep-
etition of the study, with different sample and clinical groups, will 
form an evidence-based platform for clinical interventions on this 
issue. The strengths of the study, which can be seen as being of pi-
oneering quality for Turkey, are the large sample population used 
and the inclusion of all PDs in DSM-5. Although there are studies in 
the literature investigating the relationship between PDs and early 
maladaptive  schemas  and  examining  them  according  to  gender, 
there  are  no  previous  studies  on  the  moderating  role  of  gender 
in the relationship between these two variables. Consequently, we 
believe that the results obtained from this study will contribute to 
the literature, and considering the gender factor as well as the ear-
ly maladaptive schema profiles will be beneficial in the treatment 
of PDs.
