Mindfulness and Physical Disease: A Concise Review

Abstract

Many of today’s most common, chronic, and costly diseases – from high blood pressure, to 
chronic pain – are related to stress. Mindfulness, considered a state, a trait, and a training, might 
help treat or prevent stress-related physical symptoms. A concise review of current scientific 
evidence shows that both higher levels of trait mindfulness as well as mindfulness training are 
associated with better psychological well-being, coping, and quality of life. Effects on objective 
measures of disease, however, are often non-significant or await replication. Larger trials with 
active control groups, clear diagnostic criteria, objective outcome measures, and longer-term 
follow-up are needed to generate better quality evidence. Yet, many studies do support integrating 
mindfulness into health care as part of self-care and disease management.

Introduction

Many of the most common physical diseases in modern society co-occur with mental health 
conditions, and both can be caused or exacerbated by stress [1]. Although some stress helps 
individuals respond adaptively to threats in their environment (“fight or flight”), chronic 
stress can cause “wear and tear” such that 60–80% of visits to primary care physicians are 
attributed to stress-related symptoms [2]. Effects of stress on health are further reflected by 
magnified health care utilization and costs for stress-related chronic diseases [3], as well as 
by poorer disease outcomes and decreased quality of life (QoL). For many people, 
experiencing a stress-related disease breeds additional stressors, including physical and 
psychiatric symptoms, time, travel and monetary obligations related to health care, 
uncertainty of the future, shifting self-perceptions, the need to make difficult and emotion-
laden decisions, and heightened awareness of one’s mortality. If stress cannot be avoided, 
then it must be managed to reduce the risk of developing stress-related medical symptoms or 
exacerbating existing illness.

Mindfulness is a promising approach to coping with chronic stress, with significant 
implications for promoting mind-body health and wellness, irrespective of disease state. The 
popularity of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) has recently surged, given 
considerable evidence that mindfulness training can decrease subjective measures of stress 
and that stress reduction effects endure over time [4–7], and the rising reports of stress and 
stress-related disease across the globe [8]. A common definition of mindfulness is an 
awareness of one’s present experience, with acceptance [9]. In theory, the ability to 
mindfully observe one’s present-moment experience with clarity and equanimity enables 
more effective appraisals of stressors, which, in turn, facilitates conscious, healthy decisions, 
and prevents automatic, unhealthy, habitual reactions. Taken together, the core principles and 
practices of mindfulness can promote self-regulation that may ultimately “buffer” against 
biological processes and behaviors that contribute to stress-related disease [10].

Effects of Mindfulness-Based Interventions in People with Physical Disease

While few studies find direct impact on physical disease symptoms as a result of MBIs, 
research confirms that MBIs decrease stress and distress while improving QoL for people 
with a variety of chronic, stress-related diseases.

Cardiovascular Disease—Higher levels of dispositional (trait) mindfulness have been 
correlated with some objective markers of cardiovascular health, like lower blood sugar and 
obesity, but not with blood pressure (BP) [11]. Clinical trials have found that MBIs 
significantly decrease BP across multiple levels of cardiovascular risk, from subthreshold-
prehypertensive levels [12], to prehypertensive [13*], to frank heart disease [14,15], but not 
in participants with unmedicated hypertension [16]. Although few studies relating 
mindfulness with hypertension examine QoL related variables, preliminary research has 
shown that BP decreases following mindfulness training are mediated by increased mindful 
attention and decreased rumination [17]. Moreover, a pilot study of MBSR for women with 
heart disease found significantly decreased anxiety and reactive coping behaviors post 
intervention [18]. Additional trials of other MBIs observed reduced sympathetic nervous 
system (SNS) activation and subjective disease symptoms in older adults with chronic heart 
failure [19,20].

Diabetes—MBI effects on long-term blood sugar control (HbA1c) and kidney function 
(albumin levels) in patients with diabetes are mixed, with some studies finding significant 
benefit [21–23] and others showing no change [24,25]. The most recent published review in 
this area found modest improvements in body weight, glycemic control and BP, and noted 
that studies are limited by short duration and small sample sizes [26]. Finally, another recent 
trial involving patients on disability with diabetic peripheral neuropathy reported decreases 
in pain symptom severity and pain catastrophizing as well as improved function and health-
related QoL [27*].

Musculoskeletal Conditions & Chronic Pain—It remains uncertain if patients with 
musculoskeletal conditions like fibromyalgia [28,52*], arthritis [29,30*], and chronic and 
lower back pain [30*,31] are afforded pain relief from MBIs, due to low methodological 
rigor [30*], chronicity of pain, and co-morbidity with other mental and physical health

conditions. However, published work does show that MBIs generally improve depression, 
pain acceptance, coping, and the ability to better control pain in people with chronic pain 
conditions [28–33].

Neurodegenerative Diseases—Similar mixed results have emerged from studies on 
neurodegenerative disorders. Namely, MBIs may not be effective in directly improving 
motor function in people with Parkinson’s disease [34,35], but evidence of MBI-related 
improvement in QoL, including daily experience of pain [34], stress management, coping 
ability [35,36], and activities of daily living [35,37], has been shown. For people with 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS), MBIs again do not directly improve disease symptoms but do 
improve QoL alongside sleep problems, fatigue, and illness perception [38,39]. Furthermore, 
in MS, higher dispositional mindfulness predicts lower pain interference at clinically 
significant levels [40].

HIV/AIDS—Initial pilot studies of patients with HIV/AIDS indicated MBIs may buffer the 
decline of CD4+ helper T-lymphocytes and increase natural killer cell counts [41]. In these 
studies, immune effects were mediated by class attendance [42] and were concomitant with 
MBI-related increases in life satisfaction, problem-solving coping ability, and cognitive 
accuracy to negative stimuli [43]. In contrast, a much larger (n=177), more definitive trial 
that compared MBSR to a self-management skills group without mindfulness training found 
no significant differences on immunologic outcomes in HIV-infected adults (97% male) who 
were not on antiretroviral therapy [44*]. Currently, the total evidence to date supports 
mindfulness training for reducing stress, enhancing coping, and promoting health-related 
QoL in patients with HIV/AIDS, however, no significant changes are observed, on average, 
for immune system outcomes or disease severity [45].

Cancer—There is no evidence to date that mindfulness training can alter cancer risk or 
progression of disease. Nevertheless, MBIs have been found to consistently reduce stress, 
improve emotional well-being, and enhance coping and health behaviors among patients 
with different types of cancer [46,47**]. For example, in breast cancer patients, MBIs 
engender greater behavioral and cognitive coping ability and acceptance of emotional states 
related to disease experience. Across multiple forms of cancer, patients report increased QoL 
after mindfulness training, in addition to better sleep quality (in some studies) and decreased 
anxiety, depression, hostility, and fatigue [48–51].

Psychosomatic/Functional/Somatization Disorders—Initial evidence suggests that 
mindfulness training may be effective in treating some somatization disorders, including 
chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [52*]. Specifically, 
MBIs have been shown to reduce pain and symptom severity, improve QoL, enhance coping 
ability, as well as decrease anxiety, rumination, depression, and impact of fatigue on 
functioning [52*–54]. Results, however, often show inconsistent or null effects on physical 
symptoms [53,55,56], but consistent gains in health-related QoL at follow up [55,56].

The Future of Health Care as Self-Care: Mindfulness for Health Promotion, Prevention & 
Disease Management

The consistent well-being and QoL benefits that result from participating in MBIs support 
mindfulness training as an evidence-based approach for alleviating the burden of stress-
related diseases. Moreover, mindfulness is particularly well-suited as a complementary 
(adjunct) treatment to traditional allopathic medicine, given its ability to promote self-
awareness, self-care, self-regulation, and self-management of disease. Although the 
American health care model has begun shifting from “sick care” to a “predictive, preventive, 
personalized, and participatory” model of health care [57*], symptom management remains 
the predominant focus of disease management in most health care settings. For example, the 
current prescription opioid crisis has prompted an urgent need to test and disseminate safe 
and effective non-pharmacologic therapies to relieve pain and enhancing coping skills by 
targeting the underlying mechanisms of pain perception and by promoting psychological, 
social, and physical functioning irrespective of disease severity [58].

Recent theoretical developments and empirical research suggest that more mindful people 
may feel less pain [59], that mindfulness training can relieve pain via effects on cognitive, 
emotional, sensory, and self-processing neural networks [60], and that acute pain relief from 
mindfulness training can be explained not by opioid-based pathways, but rather by specific 
patterns of brain activity characterized by decreased default mode network activation and 
increased sensory/experiential awareness [61]. Taken together, there is sufficient scientific 
premise and evidence to recommend mindfulness as a part of an integrative, 
biopsychosocial, self-management approach to treating and preventing chronic pain [30], 
and for other stress-related physical diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
[62**].

While mindfulness training can alleviate symptom burden across different diseases, the 
mechanisms by which mindfulness helps manage stress-related diseases is less clear. In 
theory, when confronted with physical symptoms triggered or exacerbated by stress, 
mindfulness skills like non-judgmentally observing, without reacting, can help “uncouple” 
emotional reactions from physical sensations, thereby facilitating coping and increasing 
resilience [63]. In addition, different aspects of mindfulness training can help in different 
ways. For example, whereas sitting meditation may increase acceptance of symptoms in the 
moment and thereby reduce interference of pain or other physical symptoms on mood or 
behavior, mindful yoga may improve perceived physical functioning by recognizing and 
letting go of thoughts or beliefs about perceived limitations that may not in fact be true. 
Similarly, MBIs delivered in group format can provide a sense of social support, connection, 
and empathy that can mitigate feelings of isolation, depression, anxiety, or hopelessness that 
directly contribute to poor QoL and disability. Moreover, because mindfulness is also an 
interpersonal process that is learned, in part, through inquiry and direct observation of how 
others embody and enact the core qualities of mindfulness, group-based interventions with 
experienced instructors may be particularly useful, and cost-effective. Finally, developing 
mindfulness as a dispositional trait may also serve as a preventive factor against disease and 
disease progression. For example, mindful perspectives may decrease negative, reactive, 
habitual, and mindless behaviors like smoking, poor diet, and a sedentary lifestyle that are

associated with developing chronic diseases [64**], and increase positive, valued, and 
purpose-driven health behaviors that are associated with self-care, health promotion, and 
disease prevention [65].

Future Directions

Current evidence supports mindfulness has as a promising component of health care, 
particularly for symptom management, coping, and QoL. As research continues testing how 
MBIs might affect organic disease processes, consideration of future study methodology is 
paramount. Studies of MBIs have exploded in number over the past decade [66], yet study 
quality has only marginally risen [67**]. Therefore, despite significant challenges with both 
funding and staffing in clinical trials, future work must prioritize rigorous experimental 
design, including large sample sizes to ensure sufficient statistical power, active comparison 
conditions to control for non-specific effects of positive expectancy (placebo effect), 
attention from group instructors, and social support from fellow group members, while 
minimizing attrition, monitoring intervention fidelity, using objective outcome measures and 
blinded data collection, and assessing longer-term outcomes. Furthermore, most participants 
in mindfulness research on physical diseases are white, middle to upper-class females [68]; 
an inaccurate reflection of national demographics given racial, gender, and socioeconomic 
disparities in chronic disease rates, access to care, and outcomes [69]. In addition to 
questions about efficacy and generalizability, the potential mechanisms by which 
mindfulness may help manage or prevent physical disease are unclear, but likely involve a 
combination of psychological, biological, and behavioral processes, ranging from improved 
attention and emotion regulation to changes in the brain, the immune system, and gene 
expression (for detailed reviews, see this Special Issue, subsections on Cognitive Processes, 
Emotion, Neural Correlates, and Genetic and Immune Systems).

Another major, practical gap in knowledge is whether higher trait mindfulness and/or 
mindfulness training improves adherence to medical regimens, increases wellness 
motivation, or decreases health care utilization? If so, mindfulness could become part of the 
current movement toward “integrated care” [70], where mental/behavioral health and 
physical health are treated together in a coordinated way, to improve health outcomes, lower 
costs, and improve both patient and provider satisfaction. However, more work is needed to 
understand how to best utilize mindfulness in primary care and community health settings, 
where most patients present with stress-related diseases. As noted by others, moving from 
tightly controlled clinical trials to implementation and delivery science will require 
pragmatic trials in real-world health care and community settings to determine treatment 
benefits, barriers, and how MBIs can be best delivered outside of the idealized academic 
setting [71]. Thus, an important challenge, and an enormous opportunity, is for academic 
researchers to collaborate with patients, community leaders, community-based 
organizations, and community health centers to adapt MBIs in a culturally sensitive manner. 
Such initiatives would also have to include (funded) opportunities for mindfulness 
instructors from diverse backgrounds to acquire professional MBI teacher training and 
supervision, a key barrier to translating, implementing, and disseminating MBIs to lower 
socioeconomic status (SES) and minority populations who bear a disproportionate burden of 
stress-related chronic diseases.

Another important future direction is to investigate mobile and internet-based delivery of 
MBIs to increase accessibility and feasibility for people with physical health conditions, 
such as cancer, IBS, obesity, and chronic pain. One recent review of internet-based MBIs 
found success for alleviating subjective measures of symptom burden, but no evidence of 
impacting objective markers of disease [72]. One promising telephone- and app-based 
intervention designed for patients who survived a critical illness may serve as a model for 
delivering the basic principles and practices of mindfulness to medical patients who 
experience prolonged challenges with physical mobility, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress 
and anxiety, sleep problems, functional limitations, or limited time or financial resources 
[73]. Additional research in this area is needed to substantiate more widespread 
dissemination of evidence-based MBIs to populations who suffer from chronic stress, pain, 
and illness, yet who face substantial barriers to accessing care provided in traditional 
medical settings.

Finally, two last challenges and opportunities merit consideration in terms of doing the work 
necessary to advance the science and practice of mindfulness for physical disease. First, 
when, where, and how does mindfulness fit into conventional medicine, now and in the 
future? Second, given that mindfulness can be viewed as secular or spiritual, depending on 
the person, place, or context, how should the link between spirituality, mindfulness, and 
health be addressed going forward? From the view of both a patient and a health care 
provider, attending to one’s health – from daily self-care behaviors to periodic encounters 
with medical providers – can improve awareness, communication, support, and compassion, 
all of which are directly tied to better health behaviors and health outcomes. Thus, attending 
to our own minds, bodies, and behaviors can make the field of medicine itself a mindful 
practice [74], above and beyond integrating MBIs into health care per se. From a clinical and 
translational science perspective, challenges and opportunities abound to further study the 
optimal ‘dose’ or duration of mindfulness practice for specific physical diseases, at a given 
stage of severity. Much more work is needed to determine whether trait mindfulness or 
mindfulness training play a role in treating, preventing, or promoting recovery from specific 
diseases, including potential integration with surgery preparation and recovery, for example. 
And, in terms of spirituality, future research studies on MBIs would benefit from assessing 
whether individuals perceive mindfulness training as secular or spiritual, whether that 
perception moderates health outcomes, and if a change in one’s sense of spirituality during 
mindfulness training mediates improved physical health – possibly depending on secular or 
spiritual perception (moderated mediation).

Conclusion

A preponderance of evidence shows that mindfulness – as both a dispositional trait, and as a 
skill-based training – can reduce patient-reported symptoms and improve coping and QoL 
across many physical health conditions. In addition, some studies have shown that both trait 
mindfulness and mindfulness training can “buffer” emotional and physiological reactions to 
stress, providing one plausible biological mechanism for protecting against stress-related 
diseases, like hypertension [75–76]. Given the increasing prevalence of chronic, often co-
morbid conditions – from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and depression, to chronic pain, 
cancer, and anxiety – mindfulness can play an important role in increasing self-awareness

irrespective of disease stage. Future studies are needed to clarify (1) whether MBIs to impact 
objective measures of disease severity or progression, (2) how to integrate MBIs into 
primary care, community health, and other health care settings, and (3) how to best tailor 
and disseminate effective MBIs for diverse populations that face significant barriers 
accessing and adhering to health care.

HIGHLIGHTS

Many of today’s most common, costly, and chronic diseases are stress-related

Mindfulness, as both a dispositional trait and as a skill-based training, can 
reduce patient-reported symptoms of stress in the context of physical disease

There is little good quality evidence that mindfulness-based interventions 
impact objective biomarkers of disease severity or progression

There is adequate theoretical justification and empirical support to integrate 
mindfulness with conventional medical care for chronic pain, cardiovascular 
disease, and other stress-related chronic diseases

Future studies are needed to clarify whether mindfulness impacts objective 
measures of physical disease, generalizes to diverse populations, and can be 
effectively implemented and disseminated in non-academic health settings
