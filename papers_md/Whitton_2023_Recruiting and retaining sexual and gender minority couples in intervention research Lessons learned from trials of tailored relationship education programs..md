Abstract

Relationship interventions, including healthy relationship education, couple therapy, and dyadic 
approaches to treating mental and physical health issues, hold promise for promoting relationship 
and individual health among sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. Because SGM 
couples live within a context of societal stigma against their minority identities and relationships, 
they are likely to be best served by targeted, culturally sensitive relationship interventions that 
are affirming, free of hetero- and cis-normativity, and address the unique stigma-based challenges 
that they face. Therefore, a key goal for the field today is to conduct research evaluating and 
refining newly developed relationship interventions designed specifically for SGM couples. In this 
paper, we offer recommendations for effectively recruiting and retaining large, diverse samples 
of SGM couples for clinical trials of tailored relationship interventions, grounded in guidelines 
for psychological practice and conducting research with SGM populations. Throughout, we offer 
examples and lessons learned from our experiences conducting clinical trials of tailored SGM 
relationship education programs. We encourage the use of recruitment and retention strategies that 
involve members of the target SGM community from the outset, are informed by knowledge about 
SGM individuals and relationships, use currently-preferred language for individual identities and 
relationships, attend to issues of confidentiality regarding sexual/gender identity or relationship 
involvement, and adhere to the norms of the particular community and recruitment venue.

Increasing numbers of people in the United States (U.S.) identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, or as another sexual and/or gender minority (SGM) identity. In 2021, 7.1% of 
U.S. adults identified as SGM, more than double the 3.5% who did so in 2012 (Jones, 2022). 
As these numbers rise, so do the number of couples in which one or both partners identify

as SGM, collectively referred to as SGM couples. The numbers of married same-gender 
couples in the U.S. has risen from 230,000 in 2013 to more than 700,000 in 2021(Scherer, 
2022); when non-married couples are also considered, there are currently over 1.2 million 
same-gender couple households (Scherer, 2022). In addition, though it is difficult to obtain 
exact estimates, many SGM adults are involved in different-gender relationships. More 
than half of SGM Americans – which translates into 4% of all U.S. adults – identify as 
bisexual (Jones, 2022), a group that is significantly more likely to partner with a different-
gender than a same-gender partner (Xavier Hall et al., 2021). Consequently, SGM couples 
are likely to represent an increasing proportion of couples seeking relationship-focused 
services, including preventive relationship education programs and couple therapies to treat 
relationship distress.

There are reasons to question whether it is appropriate to treat SGM couples with 
mainstream relationship interventions, which were almost exclusively developed for and 
evaluated on different-gender couples composed of presumably heterosexual partners. A 
meta-analysis of 117 relationship education outcome studies found that none reported any 
same-gender couples or SGM individuals in their samples (Hawkins et al., 2008). Similarly, 
of 111 couple therapy outcome studies included in a systematic review (Spengler et al., 
2020), only five included SGM couples. Although these interventions target relationship 
processes (conflict resolution, commitment, support) that are just as predictive of 
relationship outcomes in SGM couples as they are in heterosexual, different-gender couples 
(Gottman, 2003; Julien et al., 2003; Khaddouma et al., 2015), they contain heteronormative 
bias and fail to address unique stigma-based challenges faced by SGM couples, including 
coping with discrimination and negotiating relationship disclosure (Whitton & Buzzella, 
2012). Perhaps for these reasons, the effects of mainstream relationship interventions appear 
to be considerably smaller for SGM couples than for different-gender couples (Hatch et 
al., 2021). Further, many SGM couples are reluctant to participate in these interventions, 
citing concerns about provider competence in working with SGM clients, anticipated 
discrimination, and skepticism about program relevance to their experiences (Gates & 
Balderrama-Durbin, 2022; Pepping et al., 2017; Scott & Rhoades, 2014).

Relationship interventions tailored specifically for the SGM community represent a 
promising approach to better meet the preferences and needs of SGM couples. The 
vast majority of SGM adults in relationships would prefer such interventions (Pepping 
et al., 2017), which can include the universal components of evidence-based programs 
while removing heteronormative bias and also sensitively addressing SGM-specific issues 
related to societal stigma (Pentel & Baucom, 2022; Scott et al., 2019). Tailored SGM 
couple interventions also hold promise for reducing the striking health disparities faced 
by this population (Newcomb, 2020). Recent research has demonstrated that the health 
benefits of romantic relationships, long observed in general population (Waite & Gallagher, 
2000) are also present for SGM individuals (Umberson & Kroeger, 2016). High quality 
SGM relationships have been associated with lower internalizing symptoms and substance 
use and have shown stress-buffering effects against the psychological impact of stigma 
(Sarno et al., 2022; Whitton, Dyar, et al., 2018). By supporting relationship health, 
SGM couple interventions are therefore also likely to promote health and wellbeing. 
Further, given evidence of the effectiveness of relationship interventions in treating medical

issues (Baucom et al., 2012) and psychopathology (Baucom et al., 2014), relationship 
interventions are uniquely positioned to promote SGM health by helping couples gain a 
mutual understanding of health issues and develop a behavior change plan (Newcomb, 
2020).

Clearly, a critical goal for the field of couples research is to develop culturally sensitive 
evidence-based relationship interventions for SGM couples. Recent years have seen an 
initial emergence of such programs, including tailored SGM versions of healthy relationship 
education (Buzzella et al., 2012; Pepping et al., 2020; Whitton et al., 2017; Whitton et al., 
2016), relationship-focused HIV prevention programs (Newcomb et al., 2017; Newcomb et 
al., 2020; Newcomb et al., 2022) and couple therapy (Pentel et al., 2021). Nevertheless, 
a recent systematic review of SGM relationship interventions highlighted the ongoing 
underrepresentation of SGM in couples outcome research (Kousteni & Anagnostopoulos, 
2019). Further, most studies to date evaluating these programs used small convenience 
samples, limiting generalizability and power to statistically test program effects. There is 
an urgent need for additional SGM relationship intervention outcome studies with large, 
representative samples that reflect the diversity of SGM couples in terms of race, gender, 
and sexual orientation identity. Meeting this need will require researchers to recruit and 
retain diverse SGM couples in clinical trials of tailored couple interventions; however, we 
are aware of no published guidelines or research on this topic.

The Current Paper

In this paper, we aim to contribute to development of best practice guidelines by describing 
effective strategies, common challenges, and important considerations for recruiting and 
retaining SGM couples in relationship intervention research. We emphasize the importance 
of an SGM-affirmative approach that ensures that couples will feel safe and affirmed in 
their minority identities throughout all phases of their contact with the study, from initially 
seeing a recruitment advertisement to their final assessment. Grounded in the basic tenets 
of culturally competent care (Sue, 1998), this involves attending to SGM’s unique cultural 
and stigma-based experiences, being informed about the common experiences of SGM 
couples, and making efforts to avoid (often inadvertent) heterosexism and cisgenderism. 
We draw heavily from the American Psychological Association’s guidelines for practice 
with sexual minority (APA, 2021) and gender diverse individuals (APA, 2015) as well as 
emerging guidelines for research with these individuals (Griffith et al., 2017; Matthews et 
al., 2018), applying them to intervention research with SGM couples specifically. Because 
SGM couples are couples comprised of SGM individuals, some of our recommendations are 
also relevant for recruiting and retaining SGM individuals and of couples in general. We 
emphasize only those common factors that, in our experience, are critical in recruitment and 
retention of SGM couples.

Throughout, we offer lessons learned from multiple studies evaluating two tailored 
SGM relationship interventions, Better Together (formerly Strengthening Same-Sex 
Relationships), a culturally sensitive adaptation of preventive healthy relationship education 
for SGM couples (Whitton et al., 2019) and 2GETHER, an integrated couples-based 
HIV prevention and relationship education intervention for young same-sex male couples

(Newcomb et al., 2017). To evaluate Better Together, we have conducted three small 
randomized waitlist control trials with 3-month follow-up that involved a total of 71 same-
gender couples (Buzzella et al., 2012; Whitton et al., 2017; Whitton et al., 2016). Two were 
conducted in a single city (Boston or Cincinnati) and one had two sites (Cincinnati and 
Denver). Though we did not track enrollment rates of initially interested couples, 75 of 86 
eligible couples (87%) agreed to participate. Retention rates were high: of the 75 couples 
randomized, 71 (95%) began the intervention (all 4 who dropped out did so during the 
6-week waitlist period), 69 (92%) completed the intervention, and 67 (89%) completed all 
assessments including the 3-month follow-up.

2GETHER was initially piloted in a pre- to post-test open trial with 57 young same-sex male 
couples (Newcomb et al., 2017). Of the 128 couples who screened as eligible, 57 (45%) 
enrolled; of these, 55 (97%) completed the intervention and 56 completed the post-treatment 
assessment. Next, we conducted two RCTs to evaluate efficacy of 2GETHER. 2GETHER 
Chicago was an RCT to test the efficacy of 2GETHER relative to an attention -matched 
control with 128 young male same-sex couples in Chicago (Newcomb et al., 2022). 
Because analyses are ongoing, detailed recruitment and retention data are not yet available. 
2GETHER USA evaluated a telehealth version of the program, a 5-session hybrid group- 
and couple-based intervention delivered via videoconference to couples across the U.S., 
relative to single-session couples’ HIV testing and risk reduction counseling (Newcomb et 
al., 2020). 2GETHER USA screened 8112 individuals, of whom 1334 were eligible (most 
exclusions were due to exclusion criteria or because their partner never completed the 
eligibility screen). Of these, 400 (200 couples) had both partners complete baseline and were 
randomized; Of those randomized, there was a 91% participation rate and 89% retention rate 
through 12-month follow-up.

In the following sections, we offer considerations and recommendations for using an SGM-
affirmative approach to effectively recruit and retain SGM couples in intervention research, 
providing specific examples from our experiences conducting trials of Better Together and 
2GETHER whenever possible.

Recruitment

The effective recruitment of SGM couples begins well before the first advertisement is 
posted. Prior to initiating recruiting of SGM couples, it is important to prepare your research 
lab (including its physical space and online presence) and your research team to be SGM-
affirming and competent. Further, it is strongly recommended to establish collaborations 
with SGM couples and organizations in the target community from the very beginning of the 
research process. We now detail each of these considerations.

Due to historical injustices within research and medicine, as well as personal experiences of 
discrimination and invalidation in health care and research settings, many SGM individuals 
are wary of researchers’ intentions and level of cultural competence (Matthews et al., 
2018). This wariness may be compounded for SGM couples, whose relationships have long 
been pathologized and marginalized, and who have often felt excluded from interventions 
for couples that were designed and marketed for heterosexual people in different-sex

relationships (Scott & Rhoades, 2014). Consequently, prior to agreeing to participate in 
relationship intervention research, SGM couples are likely to seek information about your 
research team. It is important that the information they find clearly signals that participation 
will be inclusive, affirming, and safe. Toward this aim, websites for the research lab and 
host institution should post images that convey allyship (e.g., rainbow flags; photographs of 
SGM couples) as well as explicit statements (e.g., “This center is a safe environment for all 
individuals, including those who identify as LGBTQ and/or have racial and ethnic minority 
backgrounds.”). Similar statements and images can be physically posted in research space, 
particularly in waiting rooms and other public spaces.

In addition, as highlighted in guidelines for ethical research with SGM populations 
(Matthews et al., 2018), research team members should be trained to be aware of and 
culturally responsive to the SGM couples’ unique experiences and needs. SGM couples 
have noted that key barriers to participation in relationship interventions and research 
are concerns about staff knowledge level and competence in working with SGM couples 
(Pepping et al., 2017; Scott & Rhoades, 2014). Having members of the target community 
on the research team can provide current, insider information about the ever-evolving 
experiences of SGM people in relationships and can help build trust and a sense of safety 
among potential participants. However, staff from a variety of demographic groups can be 
effective in using an SGM-affirmative approach to recruitment and retention, as long as 
they are knowledgeable and sensitive to key issues faced by SGM couples (Matthews et al., 
2018). APA Guidelines (2015; 2021) dictate that staff be knowledgeable about the diversity 
in sexual and gender identities, the distinction between sexual orientation and gender 
identity, and the adverse effects of institutional, interpersonal, and intrapersonal stigma on 
SGM people and their relationships. For SGM couple intervention research, staff should be 
aware that SGM relationships can be negatively affected by each partner’s experiences of 
discrimination and stigma (Cao et al., 2017; Scott et al., 2021) as well as by couple-level 
minority stress, including expected and actual rejection of their relationship or partner, 
exclusion from family or work-related events, and pressure to conceal their relationship 
(LeBlanc et al., 2015). Study staff should recognize the heterogeneity and diversity of 
SGM relationships (APA, 2021), which often do not follow heteronormative relationship 
paths; many SGM couples do not have children, choose to have non-monogamous sexual 
relationships, or are forced to follow different trajectories (e.g., delaying meeting each 
other’s families).

There is growing consensus that research with minoritized communities should involve 
community members throughout the research process, from study design to dissemination. 
We have found this critical for recruitment and retention of SGM couples. Community 
advisory boards from the target population can inform and provide feedback on recruitment 
approaches, including which venues are highly attended and which study advertisements are 
most likely to be affirming and appealing to SGM couples. Collaborating with established 
SGM-friendly organizations in the community, including health centers, neighborhood 
groups, and bars and restaurants where SGM couples regularly congregate, can provide 
similar information and access to potential participants. In addition, it is critical to seek and 
accept community feedback to correct any missteps and adjust to changing preferences or 
norms within the community. For example, a model featured in a study advertisement photo

requested that we stop running the ad based on a negative experience associated with the 
image. The team’s willingness to do so created goodwill with that individual and, through 
his sharing of the experience with others, may have positively influenced the reputation of 
the study and fostered trust in the larger community.

Designing Recruitment Materials

In creating study advertisements and promotional materials, it is important to be aware that 
sexual minority and gender identity labels are culturally specific and constantly evolving 
(APA, 2021). Traditional labels such as gay and lesbian have become less common in 
recent years, particularly among youth (Devlin et al., 2020). Growing numbers of SGM 
young people identify with bisexual, pansexual, and queer identities that convey attraction 
to more than one gender (Krueger et al., 2020; Morandini et al., 2017), while others 
prefer terms such as same-gender loving or two-spirit. Transgender and gender non-binary 
identities, including labels such as gender non-conforming, gender queer, and gender fluid, 
have become more common in recent years (Richards et al., 2016). The wide range of 
sexual and gender identities held by SGM people has implications for language used to 
describe their relationships. Though in the past, the terms “gay and lesbian couples” were 
often used, this conflates sexual identity with relationship type and can lead partners of 
other sexual orientations (e.g., bi- or pan-sexual) to feel that their identity is being erased. 
Similarly, “same-sex couples,” a label used for many years (including in our own research 
and relationship education programs), refers to sex assigned at birth, rather than gender 
identity, is not inclusive of non-binary gender identities, and excludes SGM (typically those 
who identify as bi- or pan-sexual) involved in different-gender relationships.

Today, we generally use the term SGM couples to be most inclusive and adhere to 
APA guidelines (2021) stating that psychologists strive to affirm bi+ identities and avoid 
monosexist bias. However, when recruiting particular SGM couple types, we try to use 
terms currently used in that community (e.g., queer or same-gender loving couples). 
Recognizing the ambiguous nature of many young adult sexual and romantic partnerships, 
which often exist without a clear definition or label, we have at times avoided use of the 
words “partner” or “relationship,” instead including text such as, “Single? Committed? Its 
complicated?” (see Figure 1c). Because many young SGM people engage in consensually 
non-monogamous dyadic relationships and polyamorous relationships involving more than 
two people (Haupert et al., 2017), it can be effective for some advertisements to use 
language about “poly” or “open” relationships, or simply include images of more than 
two people. To ensure that recruitment efforts are reaching SGM with various language 
preferences, it can help to create multiple versions of advertisements that vary in wording 
and specific identities listed. This approach also signals the research team’s knowledge 
about and cultural competence in working with the SGM community and maximizes the 
chances that any SGM individual who views the materials feels visible and affirmed.

Additionally, advertisement content should speak to various participant motivations for 
enrollment that may be particularly relevant to SGM couples. We have found that many 
SGM couples are interested in improving their relationship and eager to take advantage 
of relationship interventions that they have long desired but felt excluded from (Whitton,

Scott, et al., 2018). Therefore, it has been effective for advertisements to highlight how 
we are offering a free tailored SGM intervention (e.g., “Opportunity for a free relationship 
workshop. Learn ways to keep your relationship strong!”; see Figure 1d). Other SGM 
couples, particularly those including male partners, are interested in improving their sex 
lives or sexual health. To capture their interest, we have created advertisements emphasizing 
the sexual health content of 2GETHER and including sexualized images (see Figure 1b). 
Communicating sex positivity is particularly critical for studies of sexual minority men, 
a group that has been highly stigmatized for their sexual behavior. Finally, many SGM 
individuals are highly invested in the SGM community and engaged in social activism to 
reduce inequalities and promote SGM wellbeing. We have found that emphasizing how the 
trial’s ultimate aim is to improve the availability and quality of services for this community 
when speaking to groups or individual couples during recruitment efforts has motivated 
many SGM couples to participate. Because racial and ethnic minority dyads are particularly 
likely to report being motivated by community benefit, highlighting this point may also help 
to recruit a racially diverse sample (Lanier et al., 2021).

Finally, when developing study advertisements, it is important to consider the tone, 
audience, and rules/restrictions of the given recruitment venue. For example, content in 
hookup and dating apps tends to be sexually provocative; to catch the eyes of SGM couples 
in these venues, advertisements may need to include sexually positive imagery and messages 
(see Figure 1b). Similarly, advertisements in SGM bars and clubs may be most appealing 
if they are sex-positive and affirming of various types of non-monogamy. In contrast, many 
social media advertising platforms (particularly Facebook and Instagram) reject content 
viewed as too sexually explicit. Further, to address victimization of SGM and the spread of 
misinformation, these platforms have begun restricting advertisements with the (unintended) 
consequence of making it more difficult for SGM-focused advertisements to be approved. 
We have learned that images can be used to convey our SGM focus and sex-positive stance 
without use of flagged words, for example by showing two men embracing (see Figure 
1a). Recruitment through religious organizations or other venues that serve SGM couples 
seeking to get married may require a very different approach, which involves less sexualized 
imagery and is focused on maximizing the chances of having a healthy and happy long-term 
relationship (see Figure 1d).

Social Media and Online Recruitment

Though social media and other online platforms represent effective recruitment strategies 
for many populations, they may be particularly important for SGM couples. Among SGM, 
social media sites (e.g., Facebook and Instagram) and online dating apps have become 
more popular than in-person venues for meeting sex and romantic partners, connecting with 
other members of the SGM community, and seeking sexual health information (Grov et 
al., 2014). Through their extensive reach, very large numbers of interested dyads can be 
reached quickly through advertising on these platforms. For example, in the 2GETHER 
USA trial (Newcomb et al., 2020) paid social media campaigns and advertisements in 
SGM hookup/dating applications led to over 1400 and over 4,000 interested participants, 
respectively. Be aware, however, that because this approach does not allow for specific 
targeting of populations of interest, it reaches many people who are not ultimately

eligible. In 2GETHER USA, less than 3% of couples who responded to advertisements 
in social media or hookup/dating applications met eligibility, completed the necessary steps, 
and scheduled sessions to be properly enrolled (there was no difference in enrollment 
rates between these two platforms). We attribute these low conversion rates to the rules 
prohibiting us from specifying particular groups to receive the advertisements who are 
most likely to be eligible (i.e., those with certain ages, sexual identities, and interests). 
Nevertheless, the sheer number of interested couples means that, even with low conversion 
rates, online recruitment can yield sizeable numbers of participants (128 in this trial). In 
fact, paid advertisements on traditional social media and gay-specific dating apps have 
yielded the highest raw numbers of participants compared to other recruitment methods. 
In addition, hookup/dating applications may be particularly helpful for recruiting a racially 
and ethnically diverse sample. In 2GETHER, most Latinx and Black participants came from 
hookup/dating applications, versus other recruitment strategies. Therefore, to recruit large 
and racially diverse samples of SGM couples, we recommend using paid online advertising 
and being prepared to screen large numbers of couples per eligible dyad, which will require 
significant staff time and efficient eligibility screening processes.

In addition, we recommend complimenting this approach with recruitment through unpaid 
organic online posting (e.g., Reddit, Twitter, Instagram posts). Because these posts can 
be targeted at particular demographic or affinity groups (e.g., specific Reddit forums), 
they can help to reach groups not responding to paid social media advertising, which 
does not allow such targeting. In the 2GETHER USA project, for example, posts to the 
gaybros, gayyoungold, gaysian, beingpoz, bibros, hivaids, and pansexual Reddit forums 
helped us recruit and enroll couples with age differences, individuals with bi- and pan-sexual 
identities, and individuals living with HIV. Further, though these posts require staff time, 
effort, and creativity, and yield smaller raw numbers of couples, this doesn’t necessarily 
translate into a higher cost per couple than paid advertising because the rate of enrollment is 
higher. For example, in this 2GETHER trial, 6% (19) of the 374 interested people reached 
via Reddit posts were eligible and enrolled with their partners (twice the conversion rate of 
social media and hookup/dating apps).

When taking on social media recruitment, it is important to understand that managing 
digital advertising campaigns requires a combination of skills in social media marketing, 
analytics, design, reputation management, and public relations (Lattie et al., 2018). The 
2GETHER project had a dedicated staff member whose primary job was navigating social 
media and digital advertising platforms. This allowed for regular updates to budgets and 
advertising creatives, which can be critical as social media policy, terms, and conditions 
change often and quickly. As one example, during our recruitment Facebook and Instagram 
removed options that would allow ads to be targeted toward SGM or racial minorities, 
requiring a quick shift in our approach. Staff who are unfamiliar with social media and 
online marketing, or do not have sufficient time allocated to it, can make costly errors. For 
example, “pay for click” advertising on Facebook can yield a surprisingly high number of 
clicks in a short period; if budget caps are not in place, the costs can run into the thousands 
of dollars within 24 hours.

Finally, digital advertising is not a one-size-fits-all option. SGM individuals and dyads 
of different age, gender, or racial/ ethnic groups may gravitate to different platforms and 
images (Macapagal et al., 2020). Consider setting out time within the recruitment timeline to 
test options before dedicating larger sums of money. For example, if deciding between two 
images to reach Black same-gender loving cisgender male couples, see if both images can 
be run with the same budgets, wording, and timeline and then use survey completion and 
analytics data to decide whether one deserves more financial support.

Community Based Recruitment

Community-based recruitment can also be an effective approach in SGM relationship 
intervention research. In our team’s evaluation studies, we have recruited many SGM 
couples in-person at SGM social spaces (e.g., coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and school 
organizations), SGM community events (e.g., Pride parades and other events), and through 
community partners. Although these methods reach fewer couples than online recruitment, 
they generally yield higher rates of enrollment. For example, the rate of enrollment for 
an evaluation trial of Better Together in Denver (Whitton et al., 2017) was substantially 
improved when an SGM-affirmative restaurant in Denver allowed our team to recruit at 
their weekly gatherings for sexual minority women. Partnering with known SGM-affirmative 
organizations may help garner trust in SGM couples, particularly racial and ethnic minority 
dyads, who may be wary of participating due to the historical injustices their community 
has experienced from research and medical institutions (Matthews et al., 2018). For our 
Chicago-based evaluation of 2GETHER we collaborated with (and paid) a well-known 
LGBT community organization in Chicago to assist with recruitment. Couples recruited 
from this organization were much more likely to include partners of color than those 
recruited online, which helped enhance sample diversity (Newcomb et al., 2022).

In addition, having a presence at in-person events and community venues can be an effective 
way to connect to SGM communities, develop name recognition and a good reputation, and 
enhance trust, all of which can contribute to future recruitment and enrollment. With this 
in mind, researchers should be mindful of and sensitive to the culture, norms, and purpose 
of the particular setting or event. Current standards for research with SGM populations 
dictate that researchers refrain from intruding on private or safe spaces during recruitment, 
especially if doing so will violate group norms or expectations for anonymity (Griffith 
et al., 2017). For example, some Chicago events for sexual minority men, such as Mr. 
International Rubber and Market Days, were less appropriate for recruitment because 
those who attended did so with an expectation of connecting and community-building vs. 
engaging with organizations.

Recruiting couples often entails attracting one person who then either recruits their partner 
directly or provides the partner’s contact information so that they can be contacted by study 
staff. This phase of recruitment is tricky for all couples research and is when many potential 
participants are lost. In the Better Together and 2GETHER trials, we used various methods 
to recruit the second partner, including sending information sheets to partner 1 to share 
with partner 2, scheduling phone calls with both partners, and answering questions from 
partner 2 via text, emails, and phone conversations. Though these methods are used in all

types of research with couples, they can require a few unique considerations when recruiting 
SGM couples for intervention trials. First, many second partners will have concerns around 
confidentiality and potentially being judged by research staff, intervention providers, or 
other participants if the intervention uses a group format. Recruitment staff should be 
prepared to validate these concerns and describe study policies and procedures for ensuring 
confidentiality and safe, affirming experiences during research and intervention activities. 
Second, it is important to pay close attention to preferred names, pronouns, and potential 
labels that the first partner uses for the second partner and their relationship; these should be 
adopted in all communications with the second partner. Because some SGM individuals do 
not use the term “partners,” explanations of how this label will be used in the study context 
(often as a default umbrella label) may be required. Third, some partnered SGM individuals 
may not have disclosed their identities across all life settings, so care must be taken that all 
communications are via methods that have been approved. In cases when the second partner 
is only out to their partner, it may be necessary to contact them through an email or address 
that is shared by the couple.

Relationship intervention research requires couples to engage in multiple activities over 
time, including baseline assessments, intervention sessions, and follow-up assessments. 
Rigorous relationship intervention research therefore requires significant attention to 
couple retention, to avoid issues associated with selective attrition. In this section, we 
offer recommendations for retaining SGM couples in intervention research, grounded in 
guidelines for work with SGM populations by psychologists (APA, 2015; 2021) and 
researchers (Griffith et al., 2017; Matthews et al., 2018) as well as emerging evidence 
of factors that promote retention in longitudinal and intervention research with SGM 
individuals (Lunn et al.,2019; Macapagal et al., 2020). The suggested strategies include: 
Building personalized staff-participant relationships, ensuring interventions are SGM 
affirming, providing value (i.e., interventions that meet couple’s needs and are viewed as 
helpful), and being sensitive to confidentiality during retention efforts.

Retention

Building Relationships between Research Staff and Couples

Consistent with guidelines for engaging SGM individuals in research (Matthews et al., 
2018), we sought to build trust and rapport with participating couples through development 
of personal relationships with study staff. Two strategies common to all intervention 
research are worth noting here based on their effectiveness with SGM couples in our 
trials. First, to the extent possible, couples were assigned a single member of the research 
team who served as their point of contact and was encouraged to engage in friendly 
conversation with participants during any interactions (e.g., answering questions about the 
study, scheduling visits). If it was not possible for this to be the same person across 
the entire study, we assigned one staff member for each phase (e.g., one for enrollment 
and baseline activities, another for follow-ups). Second, we made deliberate efforts for 
intervention facilitators to build relationships with couples. Intervention protocols specified 
that facilitators should use time before and after intervention sessions, as well as during 
breaks, to make conversation and share refreshments with couples. Anecdotally, we found

these personalized relationships to foster engagement and bolster follow-up completion 
rates. Indeed, when it was difficult for research staff to reach a couple for follow-up, 
having their session facilitator reach out with a personalized note often prompted follow-up 
completion.

Other strategies for building relationships with participants are unique to SGM couples. 
In contrast to general norms that therapists and relationship educators engage in minimal 
self-disclosure, we have found that planful disclosure of study staff’s sexual orientation, 
gender identity, and/or relationship status can facilitate trust and feelings of connection with 
SGM couples. Such openness can help address participants’ questions or concerns about the 
positionality and motivations of the staff member (Pentel et al., 2017). For example, one 
participating couple gave the feedback that they were distracted during the intervention by 
trying to determine the identities of the group leader, and then when they decided she was 
straight and cisgender, they were curious about why she was doing this work (“Is her brother 
gay or something?”). In addition, this disclosure can reduce inequities between staff and 
participating couples, whose identities and relationship status are known, and serve as an 
opportunity to demonstrate the belief that all people have sexual and gender identities with 
none being presumed as normative and therefore not worth mention. Personal anecdotes 
from the staff’s own romantic relationship to supplement intervention material can also 
help build connections with participating SGM couples; for heterosexual staff, this can also 
make it clear that the destructive couple behaviors targeted in the intervention are universal 
and not a deficit of SGM relationships. For heterosexual and cisgender staff, we often 
create opportunities early in the intervention to demonstrate knowledge about and cultural 
sensitivity toward SGM through respectful interactions with SGM staff or references to 
recent events (e.g., passage of anti-transgender legislation ; the Pulse nightclub shootings).

Providing Affirming, Culturally Sensitive Interventions

Research on SGM individuals in intervention research has shown that participants who 
perceive the intervention to be informative and relevant, without being condescending, are 
more likely to be retained in follow-up (Meiksin et al., 2021). Consistent with this, SGM 
couples who participated in our research have commonly expressed appreciation that the 
interventions were clearly designed for them (Whitton, Scott, et al., 2018). In particular, 
because all content was tailored to their type of SGM relationship, and the couples depicted 
in demonstration videos and other materials (e.g., vignettes, images) were similar to them 
demographically and in terms of relationship issues, they perceived the intervention to be 
relevant and informative for how to strengthen their own relationships. This cultivated a 
sense of safety and trust in the research team, as well as buy-in and affinity for the study that 
likely contributed to our high retention rates. Anecdotally, we observed that couples who felt 
this way often had an allegiance to the project, were unlikely to drop out, and recruited other 
couples to participate.

Providing Value

SGM participants who perceive value, either to themselves (i.e., by meeting an unmet need) 
or to their community (i.e., helping develop needed services for SGM) tend to remain 
engaged in longitudinal and intervention research (Witzel et al., 2019). Accordingly, to

retain SGM couples in intervention trials, it is important to offer an intervention that 
provides value not easily accessed elsewhere. Couples in our studies have often cited the 
value of the intervention – in terms of the skills, information, and relationship benefits 
that they gained by participating – as a key reason for their continued engagement. For 
many SGM couples, affirming and culturally sensitive relationship interventions that can 
provide these tools and information are not available elsewhere, which enhances the value of 
study participation. Similarly, participants also reported that health services offered as part 
of the 2GETHER studies, including HIV and STI testing, fulfilled unmet needs. This was 
especially true for couples in rural areas who took part in the trial of 2GETHER delivered 
via telehealth (Newcomb et al., 2020). One participant said, “rapid HIV testing…isn’t 
[here]…so you’re going to have to do a test and wait two to three weeks for your results,” 
so that the opportunity for testing “was really, really exciting.” Other couples expressed 
feeling committed to the studies because they saw the work as meeting an important an 
unmet need for relationship services in the SGM community; therefore, highlighting this 
community-level value may bolster retention of SGM couples.

SGM couples, more so than other participants, tend to find particular value in group-based 
interventions, such as Better Together and 2GETHER, which deliver the program to several 
couples at a time. Many SGM couples experience isolation and a lack of social support due 
to low numbers of similar couples in their geographical area or difficulties in connecting 
with them. In addition, few are exposed to role models of healthy SGM relationships 
through older generations or the media. Participating in a group comprised exclusively 
of SGM couples can reduce isolation, provide social connections and role models, and 
offer opportunities to learn from other couples facing similar issues. As one 2GETHER 
participant put it, “We don’t really have couple-friends. Most of our friends are straight 
girls…So it was kind of fun that way…just hearing their experiences in where they were 
from…and talking about the same stuff because it’s not really an experience that we get to 
have that often in [such a rural state].”

We must note, however, that our research teams found filling, scheduling, and launching 
groups to be extremely time-consuming and challenging, at times leading to couple attrition. 
Periodic lulls in recruitment and difficulties finding a common time that fit multiple 
couples’ schedules led to difficulty filling groups in a timely fashion. Consequently, some 
couples experienced a long lag between completing baseline processes and beginning the 
intervention, during which drop-out became more likely. To address this, some groups were 
launched with only two or three couples, but these groups fostered less lively discussion 
and did not provide the same value as larger groups. Coordinating participant schedules 
for group meetings and facilitating make-up sessions for individual couples who needed 
to miss group sessions required a significant amount of staff time and effort. In fact, 
in the 2GETHER Chicago trial, we found our initial approach of eliciting each couple’s 
availability and scheduling the group based on consensus to be too difficult and time-
consuming to maintain. We then shifted to a model in which we scheduled several groups 
in advance (with varying days and times) and offered those pre-set group times to eligible 
couples. Though some of the pre-set groups had to be canceled due to low interest and 
some couples could not make any of the scheduled groups, this approach did reduce some 
logistical challenges and staff time dedicated to scheduling. The field will need to continue

to work to reconcile the high value of group formats to SGM couples with their logistical 
challenges and cost.

Retaining confidentiality throughout retention efforts

Frequent contact with participants through reminders of assessments and intervention 
sessions, study newsletters, birthday cards, and other personalized communications, is 
effective at promoting retention in relationship intervention research. Using a variety of 
methods to engage in these communications with SGM participants, including email, 
text messages, and messaging via social media, has increased participant engagement 
and retention (Lunn et al., 2019). Although it is always important to contact participants 
using their stated method of preference (e.g., text, email), and not via methods they wish 
to avoid (e.g., telephone), this may be particularly critical with SGM couples because 
certain methods may reveal their sexual identity or relationship to unsupportive others. In 
the worst cases, such breaches of confidentiality can threaten their economic or housing 
security. Therefore, early in the study, we recommend consultation with each partner 
regarding preferred methods of contact as well as particular methods, phone numbers, or 
email addresses that should never be used. These conversations should be undertaken with 
care, communicating sensitivity to potential identity or relationship concealment while still 
signaling an SGM-affirmative stance and not inadvertently conveying that an SGM identity 
or relationship is something to be hidden. In addition, it is advisable to identify oneself in 
messages (including those left on voicemail and those sent by text or social media) with the 
name of the university rather than the specific study or lab name that may refer to SGM 
populations. In some couples, one partner may live with family members to whom they 
have not disclosed their sexual or gender identity. In these situations, we have sent study 
materials (e.g., STI testing kits; written materials) for both partners to the other partner’s 
home. Finally, when collecting alternate contacts to use for locating the participant if none 
of their provided contact information is working, SGM couples may be more likely than 
other couples to use friends or to decline providing names of family members. It is important 
to be sensitive, open, and flexible in helping these couples generate alternate contacts.

Limitations and Considerations

The recommendations offered in this paper should be considered in light of limitations of 
our approach. While we grounded our ideas in guidelines for psychological practice and 
research with SGM populations, and were informed by relevant research whenever possible, 
our recommendations have not been empirically tested as predictors of either recruitment or 
retention of SGM couples. Rather, we drew from our experiences conducting trials of SGM-
tailored relationship interventions, including anecdotal evidence and subjective feedback 
from participating SGM couples. Further, all of our trials evaluated preventive relationship 
education and sexual health programs; the most effective recruitment and retention strategies 
may differ for trials of couple therapies to treat relationship distress. For example, to capture 
SGM couples seeking couple therapy, it will likely be important to partner with SGM-
affirmative mental health organizations that offer relationship interventions. In addition, we 
recruited same-sex couples in all studies, though we have tried in our recommendations 
to emphasize the importance of being inclusive of other SGM couples, including those

involving gender diverse individuals and bi+ individuals involved in different-gender 
relationships. As noted in the APA guidelines (2015; 2021), preferred sexual and gender 
identity labels are ever evolving; this is also true regarding labels for relationships. This 
may mean that some of the specific recommendations in this paper will no longer be 
relevant in the future. We encourage researchers to consistently seek current information 
regarding preferred language and terminology and adapt approaches accordingly. As one 
example of this, our relationship education program, developed in 2011, was initially called 
Strengthening Same-Sex Relationships, which was considered appropriate at the time. By 
2018, however, due to increasing recognition of non-binary gender identities and the many 
SGM relationships that did not include two partners of different sexes, we changed this 
name to Better Together. Similarly, in the most recent version of 2GETHER we changed 
the study name to all2GETHER., which allows various partnership arrangements to enroll 
and recognizes that people may have more than one primary partner. As such, our new title 
de-emphasizes the “2” so as not to infer that partnerships are necessarily two people.

Conclusions

Tailored couples interventions hold great promise for promoting relationship and individual 
health among SGM people (Newcomb, 2020). We are excited by the growing interest 
in developing and testing tailored SGM couple interventions, including an SGM-specific 
version of the Relationship Check-up, a two-session preventive and early intervention 
approach to promoting relationship health (Gray et al., 2022), and workshops to teach SGM 
emerging adults romantic competence (Vilkin et al., 2022). As the field progresses, efforts 
to develop, evaluate, and refine these and other tailored SGM relationship interventions will 
require recruiting and retaining large, representative samples of SGM couples into clinical 
trials. We hope that this paper provides interested researchers with a roadmap for using 
SGM-affirmative approaches that provide value to participating SGM couples, enhancing 
recruitment and retention efforts.
