Introduction: Digital technology platforms offer unparalleled opportunities to reach
vulnerable adolescents at scale and overcome many barriers that exist around
conventional service provision. This paper describes the design and development of
POD Adventures, a blended problem-solving game-based intervention for adolescents
with or at risk of anxiety, depression and conduct difﬁculties in India. This intervention
was developed as part of the PRemIum for ADolEscents (PRIDE) research programme,
which aims to establish a suite of transdiagnostic psychological interventions organized
around a stepped care system in Indian secondary schools.

Methods and Materials:
four iterative activities: (i) review of recent context-speciﬁc
approach consisting of
evidence on mental health needs and preferences for
the target population of
school-going Indian adolescents, including a multiple stakeholder analysis of school
counseling priorities and pilot studies of a brief problem-solving intervention; (ii) new
focus group discussions with N = 46 student participants and N = 8 service providers;
(iii) co-design workshops with N = 22 student participants and N = 8 service providers;
and (iv) user-testing with N = 50 student participants. Participants were aged 12–17
years and recruited from local schools in New Delhi and Goa, including a subgroup with
self-identiﬁed mental health needs (N = 6).

Results:
Formative data from existing primary sources, new focus groups and
co-design workshops supported a blended format for delivering a brief problem-solving
intervention, with counselors supporting use of a game-based app on “ofﬂine”
smartphones. User-testing with prototypes identiﬁed a need for simpliﬁcation of
language, use of concrete examples of concepts and practice elements to enhance
engagement. There were also indications that participants most valued relatability and
interactivity within real-world stories with judicious support from an in-app guide. The
ﬁnal prototype comprised a set of interactive and gamiﬁed vignettes and a structured set

real-world application.

Discussion: Findings shaped the design of POD Adventures and its delivery as an
open-access blended intervention for secondary school students with a felt need for
psychological support, consistent with an early intervention paradigm. A randomized
controlled trial is planned to evaluate processes and impacts of POD Adventures when
delivered for help-seeking students in low-resource school settings.

INTRODUCTION

Mental health problems account for over a third of the total
burden of disease in adolescents (1), withs depressive, anxiety
and conduct disorders together accounting for over 75% of this
burden (2). India is home to the world’s largest population of
adolescents, placing the country at the center of global eﬀorts to
improve mental health care for this age group. At the same time,
fewer than 10% of young Indians have access to formal mental
health services (3). The negative impacts of adolescent mental
problems are starkly reﬂected in the strong association between
poor mental health and long-term social disability, while suicide
is the leading cause of death for 15–24 year olds in India (4–6).

The large mental health care gap in India and other low-
and middle-income countries (LMICs) coincides with a rapid
boom in telecommunications and internet access. Evidence from
diverse low-resource settings shows that young people aged 10–
24 years adopt new technologies and use mobile devices and the
internet more frequently than individuals from older age groups,
including for the purpose of accessing health-related information
(7). India in particular has 90% mobile phone penetration, more
than 225 million smartphone subscribers, and rapidly increasing
rates of internet and social media usage (8). Despite varied
access and gaps in connectivity, especially in rural areas, digital
technology platforms oﬀer unparalleled opportunities to reach
vulnerable adolescents at scale and overcome many of the barriers
that exist around conventional service provision (7, 9).

Since the initial description of “e-health” by Eysenbach (10),
the nature of such digital provision has evolved considerably.
Static content delivered via personal computers (PCs) or laptops
has been superseded by more advanced technology that allows for
greater functionality and adaptability. This increasingly involves
delivery of interventions through applications (“apps”) designed
for smartphones and other wearable digital devices (11). There
are now more than 10,000 publicly available mental health apps
(12, 13), of which a growing number make use of “serious games,”
i.e., games that are designed to educate, train, or change behavior
as they entertain players (14). However, few serious games to
date have been tested and reported in the scientiﬁc literature; the
available reports are based almost entirely on desktop-computer
formats rather than mobile apps (15).

Meta-analyses and systematic reviews of mental health apps
for adolescent populations highlight promising ﬁndings for
feasibility and acceptability (16–20). Game-based approaches

oﬀer speciﬁc characteristics that can help make learning more
meaningful, engaging, visual, and interactive (15). However,
evidence of eﬃcacy remains limited, especially for apps evaluated
in LMICs and for those focused speciﬁcally on adolescent
mental health (15, 17, 18). A recent review of digital technology
for treating and preventing mental health problems in LMICs
identiﬁed 49 studies, including only four studies with adolescents
or youth (7).

In this paper, we describe the design of POD Adventures,
a blended problem-solving game-based intervention for
adolescents with or at risk of anxiety, depression and conduct
diﬃculties in India. POD Adventures was developed as part of
the PRemIum for ADolEscents (PRIDE) research programme
(2016–2020), which aims to establish a suite of transdiagnostic
psychological interventions organized around a stepped care
system in Indian secondary schools (21). PRIDE has also
developed and evaluated a counselor-led problem-solving
intervention in secondary schools across New Delhi and Goa
in India. The counselor-led problem-solving intervention and
associated sensitization activities (aimed at generating self-
referrals) have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials at
the New Delhi site (Parikh et al., under review).

POD Adventures was originally conceptualized as a digital
counterpart
to the PRIDE counselor-led problem-solving
intervention, with both aiming to enhance a participant’s ability
to cope with stressors and thereby prevent/improve mental
health problems (22), in line with stress-coping theory (23). In
terms of delivery, POD Adventures follows a blended approach
that deploys low-intensity human support in tandem with a
smartphone-delivered game, potentially reducing the resource
demands of conventional
face-to-face counseling. Thus, we
aimed to develop an intervention speciﬁcation that could bridge
the gap between the high prevalence of anxiety, depression and
conduct diﬃculties and low capacity of the public mental health
system in India and potentially other similar settings (24).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Research Design
An iterative approach was
taken to intervention design
following established design guidelines including the person-
centered approach by Yardley et al. (25) and World Health
Organization (WHO) guidelines on monitoring and evaluating

digital health interventions (26). The research design also
incorporated insights from linked research activities related
to the development and evaluation of PRIDE’s counselor-led
problem-solving intervention.

The primary objectives of the current study were to:

(i) understand access to and appropriateness of a digital

intervention for adolescents in schools in India

(ii) identify features to enhance engagement with, the problem-

solving content of the intervention

(iii) identify features to optimize the developmental and cultural

acceptability and usability of the intervention

(iv) identify features to optimize contextual acceptability and

feasibility of intervention delivery

Setting
Intervention development was initiated in July 2017 at sites in
New Delhi (north India) and Goa (southern India). These sites
were selected for the current study as services, staﬀ and school
relationships were pre-existing in these two regions. Goa and
Delhi are among India’s most highly urbanized states and oﬀered
opportunities to evaluate the roll out of a technology-enabled
intervention. Primary data collection was conducted in two
same-sex government-run, Hindi medium secondary schools in
New Delhi (one all-girls and one all-boys) and six co-educational
government-aided secondary schools in Goa.

Ethical Approvals
Approvals for PRIDE’s formative research activities, including
the current study, were obtained from the Indian Council of
Medical Research (ICMR) and institutional review boards of
Sangath (the implementing organization in India) and London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (a collaborating
academic partner in the UK). Local approvals were also
obtained from the relevant school boards in New Delhi and
Goa. Informed written assent and consent was obtained from
participating adolescents and their parents/guardians. Detailed
information sheets providing information about the PRIDE
programme, focus group discussion and co-design workshops
were included, along with assent/consent
forms that were
developed in English, Hindi, and Konkani (the local languages).
Participants were provided with certiﬁcates of participation for
their time and contributions.

TABLE 1 | Participant characteristics FGDs and co-design workshops.

Data Collection
Intervention design consisted of four main activities: (i) review
of previous formative work; (ii) focus group discussions (FGDs);
(iii) co-design workshops; and (iv) user-testing. Insights from
(i), (ii), and (iii) were used to deﬁne the intervention “guiding
principles” (25) leading to the speciﬁcation of an initial prototype.
Insights from (iv) helped to reﬁne iterative prototypes following
from emergent ﬁndings on feasibility, acceptability, and usability.

Previous Formative Research
A review of
the previous formative research consisting of
qualitative studies [(27), Parikh et al., under review] and pilot
studies (21) contributed to intervention planning activities.
Two qualitative studies were conducted that consisted of focus
group discussions with multiple stakeholders including school-
going adolescents from low-and middle-income communities,
parents,
teachers, school counselors, and service providers
at the two research sites in New Delhi and Goa with. An
iterative phased approach was then used to model and then
test successive prototypes of the intervention in two linked pilot
studies (21) at the New Delhi site using a prospective cohort
design. The studies evaluated the acceptability and feasibility
of the intervention delivery and potential for impact in order
to reﬁne the intervention. An ongoing randomized controlled
trial is being conducted to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the
intervention (Parikh et al., under review).

Focus Group Discussions
Participants
Forty-six adolescents (n = 23 in Delhi; n = 23 in Goa; 21 female:
25 male) participated in six FGDs (one per school at four schools
in Goa; one per school at two schools in Delhi) (see Table 1).
Participants were drawn from grades 8 to 11 and ranged in
age from 12 to 16 years (mean 14.0), with recruitment carried
out through a combination of classroom announcements and
teacher nominations. To capture diﬀerent perspectives, we tried
to approximate equal quotas with regards to age and gender.
No speciﬁc eligibility criteria were used to select adolescents on
the basis of current/prior experiences of mental health problems,
although participants were required to be proﬁcient in English,
Hindi, or Konkani, and to provide informed assent and parental
consent. In addition, we conducted two FGDs at each site
drawing on a group of eight service providers (n = 3 in Delhi; n =
5 in Goa) with experience of delivering the PRIDE counselor-led

through photographs of group work, and were audio-recorded
and transcribed.

Topics
Participant FGDs consisted of questions about the use and
preferences for diﬀerent digital media; access to smartphones;
and nature of use, location of use and experience playing games
and apps. Service provider FGDs consisted of questions regarding
the appropriateness of a digital mental health intervention
in school settings. This included reﬂections on successes
and challenges faced in delivering a brief problem-solving
intervention in a conventional face-to-face individual format.
Each FGD lasted 60–90 min and was conducted jointly by the ﬁrst
author and representatives from a partner design agency. FGDs
were audio-recorded and documented through written notes and
photographs of group work.

Co-design Workshops
Participants
Twenty-two participants (n = 13 in Delhi; n = 9 in Goa; 4 female:
18 male) participated in one co-design workshop each conducted
at the participating schools at the two research sites (see Table 1).
The mean age of adolescents was 14 years (range 13.0–15.0
years) from grades 8 to 10. Eligibility criteria and recruitment
procedures were the same as in the FGDs. The same group of
eight service providers participated in one design workshop at
each site.

Topics
Co-design workshop activities with participants included: (i)
exploring a selection of popular games and apps such as Temple
Run, Candy Crush, Tekken, Horizon Chase, and Kaun Banega
Crorepati? (an Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?)
on smartphones; (ii) story building to create personas and
problem scenarios; (iii) paper prototyping of game components
and characters; and (iv) discussion about prototype ideas
presented by participants. Workshops with providers focused
on: (i) prototype contents; (ii) identifying narratives for the
game and how to emphasize the key problem-solving features;
and (iii) suggestions for making the game easier to understand
and navigate for users. Each workshop lasted 90–120 min and
was conducted jointly by the ﬁrst author and team members
from the partner design agency. Workshops were documented

User-Testing
Participants
Fifty participants (28 female: 22 male) from six schools took part
in 22 user-testing sessions over 9 months at the Goa site (see
Table 2). The mean age of participants was 14.5 years (range
12–17 years) from grades 8 to 12. Participants were recruited in
three ways: (i) classroom announcements; (ii) teacher referral of
participants representing a mix of age and gender within their
classes; and (iii) participants with prior experience of school
counseling who were invited to volunteer.

Participants were asked about their views about the gameplay
contents and concepts; characters; gamiﬁed components such
as rewards, quizzes, missions, etc., as well as on ease of use,
game bugs and points in the game when external support was
required. Feedback was also sought on human support and
intervention delivery options in schools such as small group
delivery. Gameplay was observed and notes taken by supervising
researchers. Discussions were documented through photographs,
and were audio-recorded and transcribed.

Data Analysis
Analysis followed an iterative and recursive process which was
led by an intervention working group (PPG, EH, RS) with
oversight from the senior investigators (DM and VP) and an
independent Scientiﬁc Advisory Group (see Acknowledgments).
Insights from the parallel PRIDE formative research activities
[(21), (27), Parikh et al., under review], new FGDs, co-design
workshops and user-testing were analyzed and triangulated
around the four
research objectives using an integrated
inductive-deductive approach to content analysis and through
thematic and mapping techniques (see Figure 1) (28). This
resulted in a set of “guiding principles” (25) that summarized the
intervention objectives and distinctive features necessary to meet
these objectives, in alignment with key information about the
target population and its context. During prototype development,

the formative data sources were revisited regularly and reviewed
alongside the wider literature on digital
interventions for
adolescent mental health, insights from user-testing and from
implementation of the counselor-led intervention that was being
conducted in parallel.

RESULTS

Accessibility and Appropriateness of
Digital Interventions
Context of Self-Help
Self-help was suggested early in the formative PRIDE research
(21) as a scalable format however consultations with stakeholders
(Parikh et al., under review) and service provider FGDs
highlighted that “self-help” was not a culturally-congruent
concept for most Indian adolescents. Service provider and
participant FGDs revealed norms around seeking or receiving
direct instruction from parents, teachers and other elders. Both
groups felt that support from a counselor would be necessary for
an intervention to be eﬀective. Service providers also reported
that students they had previously provided counseling services to
had diﬃculties understanding abstract concepts. This was linked
to the emphasis on rote learning over critical thinking in the
Indian schooling system. The game was therefore designed to
incorporate a combination of teaching methods including direct
instruction, modeling and practice to accommodate diﬀerent
learning styles and to emphasize self-eﬃcacy (29–31).

Accessibility and Compatibility of Technology
Most participants in the FGDs reported having easy access to
smartphones, albeit through devices that usually belonged to
a parent (mainly fathers). The primary use was to play oﬄine
games, while internet access was restricted by limited data
packs. Participants navigated a variety of digital and app-based
games with minimal help, lending support to the acceptability
and usability of a gamiﬁed format. Formative work (Parikh

et al., under review) revealed that digital interventions were
broadly appealing to adolescents. More speciﬁcally, participants
and service providers felt that a digital delivery format might
oﬀer more opportunities for personalization and engagement
thereby addressing limitations
in the context of self-help,
raised about the usefulness of this modality. Moreover, FGDs
indicated that typing into a smartphone may be preferred
by many participants to writing on paper. On the other
hand, service providers highlighted potential concerns arising
from parents and teachers regarding the amount of time that
adolescents spend on phones. Based on these learnings, the
decision was taken to restrict delivery to counselor-supported
use of smartphones during dedicated school-based sessions,
internet access
and for functionality to be independent of
(i.e., work oﬄine).

Ensuring Privacy
The importance of providing participants with clear assurances
about privacy and conﬁdentiality emerged strongly in the
preliminary formative work (Parikh et al., under review). In line
with best practice guidelines for other mental health apps (19), an
adolescent-friendly privacy policy was drafted in simple language
and included in the game prototype. This policy contained details
about how information would be collected, used and stored and
under what circumstances it would be shared (i.e., in the case of
risk to self or others).

including a majority
of self-referred adolescents who scored below thresholds for

feedback from participant FGDs and user-testing that problem
solving would be a useful and valued skill for all adolescents (not
just those experiencing ongoing mental health diﬃculties), POD
Adventures was re-conceptualized as an open-access intervention

for adolescents with a felt need for psychological support. This
decision was consistent with evidence for problem solving as
an eﬀective prevention strategy for adolescents with emotional
problems (32–34) as well as wider evidence and emerging service
models for early intervention for adolescent mental health
problems (35, 36).

Problem-Solving Contents
Format and Structure
Piloting of the counselor-led intervention supported a simpliﬁed
three step problem-solving procedure with the memorable
acronym, “POD” (identifying “Problems,” generating “Options,”
and creating a “Do it” plan) (21) and this was adopted in
development of the game. Also consistent with the counselor-
led intervention that used printed comic booklets to illustrate
problem solving, both participants and service providers
suggested that a narrative format would be optimal for the

game. The prototype structure comprised two main sections,
adventures and My-POD (see Figure 2), with navigation
within and between sections supported by a guide character.
The adventures section contained short vignette-based stories
exploring diﬀerent adolescent characters and their problem-
solving journeys while emphasizing the steps of problem solving
(see Figure 3). The My-POD section was designed to help
generalize and consolidate learning of the previous steps through
real-world application. This section presented participants with
a series of forced-choice and open-text questions in which they
were guided through the steps of problem solving for their own
problems (see Figure 4).

Common Problems and Stress Reactions
PRIDE formative work (27), FGDs and co-design workshops
identiﬁed common social stressors including academic pressure,
in romantic relationships, negotiating
bullying, diﬃculties

parental and peer inﬂuences, and exposure to violence and
other threats to personal safety. Stress reactions were commonly
described using the catch-all term “tension,” while more speciﬁc
references to anger, rumination, and loss of concentration
were also prominent in adolescents’ narratives (27). The four
character-based vignettes in the game were scripted to reﬂect
some of these common problems and stress reactions. During
user-testing, participants consistently reported that the vignettes
were relatable but that they would like more character details
and more vignettes. In response, game scripts were revised to
include more detail for the central characters (e.g., more “thought
bubbles” which shared a character’s’ thoughts and feelings; see
Figure 3). However, due to the brief nature of the intervention
a decision was made to limit the number of vignettes to four.

Concepts
User-testing sessions highlighted that while speciﬁc problem-
solving behaviors were learned with relative ease, conceptual
learning intended to address problem orientation was limited.
My-POD questions were revised to provide concrete examples
wherever possible (for example, the Options section provided the
instruction, “Write down some good things about this option”
and was supplemented by help text saying, “For example, a
good thing might be that the option would be easy for you to
do, or that it would make a BIG diﬀerence to your problem”).
Additionally, an introductory animated video explaining the
overarching stress-coping model and concepts of problem
solving was incorporated into the game opening. These concepts
were reinforced repeatedly at key points throughout the game.

Early versions of My-POD contained a high proportion of
incomplete or inaccurately ﬁlled ﬁelds. Participants reported
that some of the activities in this section, particularly related
to option generation and selection (for example, weighing pros

and cons) were diﬃcult. Instruction screens containing text and
audio information were added (see Figure 4), free-text questions
were supplemented with sliding scale responses (see Figure 4),
and a summary section was added to easily view action planning
progress. These enhancements resulted in greatly improved
completion of this section.

Participants also expressed a desire to access more directive
tips and speciﬁc suggestions about ways to solve problems. In
response, an interactive “Options Bank” was designed around
diﬀerent life domains (for example, problems faced at school, at
home, in their neighborhood, emotion-focused problems, etc.).

Emotion Regulation Activities
Formative PRIDE work (27) indicated adolescents employed
avoidance more frequently than active coping when faced with
stressful situations. A key component of eﬀective treatment
therefore was in helping participants understand and manage
emotions (Parikh et al., under review), also supported by ﬁndings
from the service provider FGDs. To address this, emotion
regulation exercises were embedded in the Adventures section of
the game. These exercises were designed based on an abbreviated
form of Nezu et al. “Stop, Slow down, Think, Act” method (22),
and included guided imagery, breathing, and muscle relaxation
exercises (see Figure 3). In user-testing, participants reported
that the early iterations of these activities were too long and these
were subsequently revised to be kept under 2-min in order to
minimize boredom and disengagement.

Developmental and Cultural Acceptability
Media Preferences
During FGDs and co-design workshops, participants expressed
a preference for games with stories set in varied real-world
environments and oﬀering choices which could be explored. In

response, gameplay was organized around a set of interactive
vignettes located in age-appropriate settings (for example,
at school, home, playground, etc.; see Figure 3). The three-
dimensional
the game was based on
photographs taken by game developers at the schools and
surrounding localities and the design aesthetic was informed by
participants’ media preferences. Special care was taken to ensure
a cast of culturally relatable characters representing a mix of
genders, ages, body shapes, social classes, and common names.

The overall tone of the game was designed to be non-directive
with multiple features providing user-choice (37, 38). Some
diﬀerences in media preferences were noted between girls and
boys, such that boys appeared to prefer immersive games and
girls favored puzzle-platform games. The prototype was therefore
designed to include both narrative and puzzle elements. In user-
testing, participants strongly endorsed elements of user-control
and interactive content and expressed a desire for more features
of this type. In response, additional user-controlled decision
points such as options to select conversational responses were
added (see Figure 3). The game was designed to be available in
the two most commonly spoken languages (English and Hindi)
and a vernacular language spoken at the Goa site (Konkani).

Literacy
Formative PRIDE research revealed widespread literacy
and
in Government-run
diﬃculties
Government-aided schools, which limited the use of
text-
heavy printed problem-solving materials (21). User-testing also
highlighted the need for more concrete and speciﬁc language,
particularly around problem-solving concepts. This led to a
number of changes in phrasing, for example, “Do you think you
will face any challenges?” was revised to “What might stop you?”
The lexicon of emotion words was also reduced, and paired with
illustrated “smileys” to aid comprehension.

Gamiﬁcation
Participants co-design workshops highlighted several gameplay
features with the potential to enhance motivation. In particular,
participants created mock games that included quizzes, obstacles
and ﬁghting elements, reﬂecting preferences for elements of
competition and rewards. Consequently, vignettes were designed
to include “missions” in which users completed a series of tasks
in order to progress through the vignette (for example, clicking
on objects in a room to discover a character’s worries represented
by that object). “Mini-games” were also incorporated to model,
practice, and reinforce speciﬁc problem-solving behaviors (for
example, rearranging the steps to make a Do-It plan for a
character; see Figure 3). Quizzes were also incorporated to assess
recall at the end of every vignette. During user-testing, the
mini-games were among the most popular features. However,
virtual “badges,” originally introduced to reward completion of
mini-games, were poorly understood and generally disliked in
favor of more targeted verbal encouragement. In response, the
badges were replaced with motivational feedback from the guide
character and points awarded for correct quiz responses.

Intervention Delivery
In-Game Support
Participants endorsed both relational and instructional functions
provided by face-to-face contacts with school counselors (Parikh
et al., under review). Service provider FGDs suggested that a
guide character within the game could provide some of these
functions. The game guide character was designed to provide
instructions,
information (psychoeducation and teaching the
problem-solving method) and support (praise, encouragement,
and motivational statements) throughout the game. They were
conceptualized as a warm and knowledgeable older peer,
intended to enhance dialogue support and social support features
in line with persuasive systems design (38, 39). Contingent
responses from the guide were programmed wherever possible.
For instance,
if participants rated their mood as negative,
the guide would respond with a sympathetic and encouraging
message. User-testing indicated that the guide character was
generally liked by participants. However, users of early prototypes
felt that the guide appeared too often and that some of their
comments were unnecessary. The guide feature was subsequently
revised to appear less frequently during the Adventures section
and their script was revised to focus on reinforcing key learning
about the problem-solving method. During user-testing some
participants reported that they felt supported by the game itself
(rather than speciﬁcally by the guide) and that they enjoyed and
felt safe in sharing their problem within the game.

Human Support
Most spontaneous requests for help during user-testing were
made when participants required troubleshooting of game
mechanics (e.g., which button to press next). Diﬃculties
in understanding content emerged in discussions following
gameplay but were not
immediately apparent. Participants
expressed mixed views about relational functions of human
support. Some participants reported that the game was better
than meeting with a person because “the game always listens to
you.” Others felt that it was important to meet with someone
because they “understand what you say.” Participants who
had previously received a face-to-face counseling intervention
suggested that the game may be suﬃcient on its own for some
participants, but others with more severe problems might also
require counselor support. The human support for the game
was subsequently conceptualized to oﬀer both instruction and
personalized support at onboarding and completion of the game,
with the counselor available to help when needed throughout the
rest of the intervention.

Managing Risk
Service provider FGDs highlighted concerns about ensuring
appropriate provisions for risk assessment and management
within the intervention. In response, a mood rating system was
incorporated into the digital login procedure. This was linked to a
risk assessment question that would be triggered for participants
who reported very low mood. As the game was designed to
work oﬄine, a real-time alert was not possible. Instead, a positive
response to the risk assessment question diverted the participant
to a locked screen containing a message about approaching the

supporting school counselor. A counselor would then undertake
further assessment and management, after which the participant
would potentially resume the intervention by the counselor using
a code to unlock the screen.

Group Delivery
Participants
speciﬁcally
in user-testing sessions were not
concerned about the prospect of peers knowing about their
engagement with the game, although concerns were voiced about
other participants observing their gameplay. Some participants
expressed that group sessions may be advantageous as a way
to encourage a sense of togetherness among intervention users.
It was suggested private gameplay could still be achieved in a
group setting if participants were able to sit at a distance from
each other.

Principal Findings and Relevance to Prior
Work
This paper describes the collaborative design and development
of POD Adventures, a blended gamiﬁed smartphone intervention
risk of anxiety,
for
depression and conduct diﬃculties in India. The study aimed to
understand access and appropriateness of digital interventions
for adolescents and identify features to optimize: engagement
with the problem-solving content, developmental, and cultural
acceptability and usability and contextual acceptability and
feasibility of delivery.

This study found that a digital blended self-help format was
acceptable to school-going adolescents in this context. The game
prototype was designed to work oﬄine and with provision
of direct counselor supervision and support during school
hours in response to concerns from teachers and parents about
inappropriate/unguided use of smartphones, and limited internet
access at schools and participants’ homes. Local infrastructural
limitations, particularly the lack of online functionality, limited
design decisions that might harness the full range of beneﬁts of
mobile health interventions for this population, such as “on-the-
go” use to facilitate practice (40, 41) or the ability to connect
with other users (12, 31). However, the design allows for further
development of the game to include enhanced interactivity or
online functionality in the future.

The gamiﬁed and narrative formats were found to be engaging
by participants. Comprehension of problem-solving concepts
was improved by revisions to the game contents wherein
principles were made more explicit and concrete and supported
by additional explanation, illustration, and repetition.

Gamiﬁed features such as user-choice, rewards and quizzes
were found to be key aspects that participants endorsed and
that enhanced their enjoyment of and engagement with the
game. This is a consistent ﬁnding across the existing global
mobile health (mHealth) literature and suggests these features
may be fairly universal components of an engaging design
(31, 38, 39). In particular, design preferences in this study
bear a number of similarities to SPARX (42), a CD-Rom and

downloadable app-based game delivering cognitive-behavioral
therapy (CBT) to adolescents for depression. SPARX is also set
in three-dimensional worlds and included characters, avatars and
gamiﬁcation, levels, modules, and a “guide” character. Given the
universality of these features, although regional translations and
cultural adaptations would be necessary, it is hoped that the basic
design would be acceptable across states in India.

these support

Instructional and relationship support were found to be
valued by participants. Aspects of
functions
were shared across the in-game guide and the supporting
counselor. Participants also reported feeling supported by
the game itself, consistent with studies from other countries
examining therapeutic alliance with digital interventions (43). It
is important to note, however, that throughout the intervention
planning and development process, participants and service
providers also highlighted limitations of pure digital self-help to
meet adolescents’ needs in full. The intervention was therefore
designed as blended with limited support from a counselor
(41, 44). This is consistent with other global research which
has found that some human support increases satisfaction (45)
and adherence (46) with digital interventions for mental health.
Furthermore, therapeutic alliance with a remote therapist is
predictive of outcome (47).

The reconceptualization of this intervention as an open-access
intervention for all help-seeking students ﬁts with a broader
move toward early interventions and selective or indicated
prevention for adolescent mental health problems (35, 36). It is
also aligned with evidence on problem solving as an eﬀective
strategy for emotional problems (32–34) and recent research
showing positive eﬀects of skill-based digital mental health
promotion interventions for young people with depression and
anxiety (48).

Strengths
this study was the emphasis on user-
A key strength of
centered design, following the guidance for design of complex
interventions and principles of the person-based approach to
intervention development (25, 26). The iterative methodology
enabled participants to guide the development and provide their
inputs at each stage. Sensitivity of the researchers and design
team to local and cultural context, language, participant media
preferences, and digital access helped focus on user needs and
formed important considerations for the prototype design. These
have also been described in detail in this paper as they could
inform the development of other similar kinds of programmes
in the future. Another important strength is the grounding
of intervention contents in relevant theory, clinical evidence
and past research. Participants were balanced with regard to
age, grade and gender across the diﬀerent activities as much
as possible. The number of adolescent participants across two
diverse research sites as well as service providers that consisted
of both clinical psychologists and non-specialist workers also
strengthened the study. Participants with previous mental health
problems who had utilized counseling services in the past were
also included.

Design and Development of “POD Adventures”

Limitations
Researcher or design team personal views may have inﬂuenced
the process of development and interpretation of results.
However, the relatively large number of adolescent participants
and service providers who were consulted may have helped
minimize bias. Parent and caregiver perspectives could not be
included and would be a valuable addition to future work.

The research methods used,

i.e., focus groups, co-design
workshops, and user-testing have limitations. Both teacher
nominated referrals and self-selection may have introduced bias.
However, the number of participants was fairly large (N =
46 for FGDs, N = 22 for co-design workshops, and N = 50
for user-testing sessions) and ideas and feedback began to be
repeated as activities progressed indicating saturation might have
been reached. Working with a larger number of participants
who had experienced mental health diﬃculties or experienced
counseling may have strengthened the prototype development.
Although this study took place in two diﬀerent urbanized
regions in India, further work would be needed to conﬁrm
the generalizability to other settings such as semi-urban or
rural settings.

Implications for Research and Practice
There are relatively few digital interventions for adolescents
or in LMICs, particularly smartphones apps that have been
rigorously designed and evaluated or are available in local
languages (19, 49). POD Adventures could help ﬁll this gap,
especially in light of the challenges of delivering accessible
and timely mental health support to adolescents in LMIC
settings where mental health services are under-resourced
and overstretched.

In India in particular, rapidly growing penetration of mobile
devices, internet and social media is increasing opportunities
for wider accessibility of these kinds of interventions (50). POD
Adventures could be adapted to settings where there is increased
access to smartphones amongst adolescents (51) or where it
can be integrated into existing services (for example, as part
of school counseling provision or as part of broader-based
health promotion activities) at lower levels of the stepped care
approach (5, 52).

As blended self-help intended to be delivered with some
human support POD Adventures is potentially more cost eﬀective
and easier to disseminate (16, 45, 46, 53). In the future,
this support could be delivered through teachers, older peers
or non-specialists with appropriate training (54), thereby also
contributing to interventions that can be delivered in settings
