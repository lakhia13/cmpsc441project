There is broad consensus that children’s ability to regulate emotion, particularly negative 
affect, can have enormous implications for the cascading processes underlying social and 
emotional development. With the burgeoning autonomy of toddlerhood comes a rudimentary 
understanding of the varieties of emotional experience, and initial awareness that a child’s 
actions can augment or attenuate the intensity of those experiences. Successful forays into 
emotion regulation are crucial for healthy psychological development, allowing children to 
accommodate life’s difficulties by purposefully altering their emotional state (i.e., cope) 
when necessary. By contrast, persistent negative affect in childhood is known to increase the 
risk for depression by late adolescence.1 Neuroimaging studies in youth and adults have 
implicated a key circuit in the generation and regulation of negative affect including the 
amygdala, a subcortical structure which detects emotionally-salient information, and the 
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a cortical region known to exert regulatory influence on 
the amygdala. Synchronous activation of these regions, reflecting functional transmission of 
information between them, is conceptually and empirically linked to individual differences 
in the intensity and purposeful modulation of emotion.2 Furthermore, amygdala reactivity is 
associated with negative affect in preschoolers, e.g.3, while emotion-related amygdala-
mPFC connectivity may shape the subsequent development of resting (intrinsic) amygdala-
mPFC connectivity particularly in childhood.4

Yet, despite this circuit’s critical relevance for socioemotional development, little remains 
known about how functioning in this circuit relates to childhood emotion regulation ability. 
In an important contribution to the field, Gaffrey et al. investigate the interrelationships of 
amygdala reactivity, amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity, and emotion regulation in a 
community sample of preschoolers.5 Understanding the functioning of this circuit in early 
childhood has the potential to inform both our biological understanding of how internalizing 
disorders develop in childhood, and our ability to better predict future risk of internalizing 
disorders utilizing objective biological measures. To that end, the authors recruited a cross-
sectional sample of 132 preschool children (ages 4–6 years) from the community to 
participate in clinical assessments and neuroimaging. The sample was enriched for variance 
in caregiver-reported child depressive symptoms, though children were otherwise typically 
developing. Caregivers further reported on their child’s ability to regulate emotional 
experiences, frequency of emotion dysregulation (negativity), and their own (maternal) 
depressive symptoms. All children underwent resting state functional (f)MRI, while a subset

completed an emotional face viewing task during fMRI. After stringent quality control 
checks, 66 children had usable resting state fMRI data, of whom a subset (n = 24) further 
completed the emotional face task. Of the 66 children, approximately one-third had a 
diagnosis of an internalizing and/or externalizing disorder based on assessment.

The authors next computed temporal correlations to identify brain regions with synchronous 
activation to left and right amygdala. In resting-state data, connectivity of the right, but not 
left, amygdala with the mPFC was linked to higher scores in caregiver-reported emotion 
regulation. Moreover, the strength of this connection was inversely correlated with caregiver 
reports of their child’s negativity. Among the subset of children completing the emotional 
face task, those with depressive symptoms tended to exhibit greater right amygdala 
reactivity to emotion faces than those without. Similarly, amygdala reactivity to faces was 
positively correlated with overall negativity, as well as reduced resting state connectivity 
between right amygdala and mPFC. Notably, these findings remained when adjusting for 
factors including age, sex, and maternal depression. Finally, the authors conducted statistical 
mediation analyses to explore whether resting amygdala-mPFC connectivity mediated the 
relationship between amygdala reactivity and negative affect. Indeed, resting amygdala-
mPFC did mediate the relationship between amygdala reactivity and negative affect, though 
the reverse model did not hold significance. As above, this statistical mediation remained 
significant when adjusting for child age and sex, and maternal depression, suggesting results 
were not simply due to bias in caregiver reporting of child symptoms.

As with any study, there are limitations which should be noted. As the authors point out, this 
is a modest sample size, particularly when examining the subset of children completing all 
tasks. Future studies with expanded samples of children will be needed to replicate and 
extend these findings. Second, this study is cross-sectional and thus can not provide 
information on neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying emotion regulation in early 
childhood.

Altogether, these findings add to a growing literature that is unveiling key neural substrates 
underlying emotional experience in early development. There are several key findings in this 
study that readers should be aware of. First, this study is one of the few implicating the 
amygdala-mPFC circuit in emotional reactivity and regulation in preschool children, a 
population that is understandably difficult to successfully recruit and scan. Second, this 
study suggests that individual differences in the neural circuitry underlying emotion 
regulation are detectable at an early age. This is particularly exciting for its potential to serve 
as an additional marker that could help guide clinicians and policymakers in identifying at-
risk children for early and timely intervention. Third, using statistical techniques, these 
findings suggest that amygdala-mPFC connectivity mediates the relationship between 
amygdala reactivity and persistent negative affect. This gives cause for optimism – your 
preschooler is not doomed simply because he or she has a hyperactive amygdala. Rather, the 
prefrontal cortex is already capable at this early age of modulating the amygdala and 
achieving successful emotion regulation. Notably, the authors caution us to temper our 
optimism given the small sample size, particularly in the task-related (emotional faces) 
results. However, their ability to detect these effects given such limited power is encouraging 
for future research replicating these results in larger contexts.

So where do we go from here? Certainly, as stated, it will be important to expand this work 
to larger samples of children assessed longitudinally, ideally beginning in the prenatal 
period. Such studies, while challenging, will be crucial for identifying early life brain 
trajectories indicative of child mental health, akin to establishing a growth curve for the 
brain and psychological well-being in children and adolescents. We direct interested readers 
to the Healthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study,6 which will provide a unique 
opportunity to examine these very questions. Second, the dynamics of this circuit’s 
operation, its integration in broader brain function, and its activity in different contexts 
remain unclear. The role of these structures in different brain networks and environmental 
operating contexts remains unclear. For example, what is the temporally causal flow of 
information in this and emotion regulatory circuitry? How does amygdala-mPFC 
connectivity interplay with the greater organizing networks of the brain (e.g., default mode)? 
Under what contexts is this circuit recruited, and just as importantly, when is it not? Third, 
how do caregivers influence the functioning and development of neural circuits underlying 
emotion regulation? Caregivers not only represent a crucial emotional buffer for children but 
can also sculpt a child’s emotional development through their own modeling and guidance, a 
critical avenue for parenting interventions.7 Clearly, it will be important for future studies of 
child development to capture as much information as possible on caregivers. This should 
include caregivers’ own mental health history, emotion regulation abilities, and ideally even 
dyadic observational and biological measures such as neural synchrony.8 Such studies can 
help us better understand the most relevant building blocks in our children’s emotional 
brains and strengthen the connections both inside and outside of the brain that matter most.
