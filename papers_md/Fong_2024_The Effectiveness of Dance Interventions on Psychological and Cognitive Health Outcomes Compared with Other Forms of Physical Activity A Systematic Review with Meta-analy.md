Abstract
Background  Physical activity is known to improve psychological and cognitive outcomes. Learning dance sequences may 
challenge cognition, partnered or group dance may benefit social interactions, and the artistic aspect may improve psycho-
logical wellbeing. Dance is an equally effective form of physical activity compared with other structured physical activities 
to improve physical health, but it is unclear how effective dance could be for psychological and cognitive outcome measures.
Objective  To systematically review the literature on the effectiveness of structured dance interventions, compared with 
structured exercise programmes, on psychological and cognitive outcomes across the lifespan.
Methods  Eight databases were searched from earliest records to July 2022. Studies investigating a dance intervention 
lasting ≥ 4 weeks, including psychological and/or cognitive health outcomes, and having a structured exercise comparison 
group were included. Screening and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers at all stages. All reviewer 
disagreements were resolved by the primary author. Where appropriate, meta-analysis was performed, or an effect size 
estimate generated.
Results  Of 21,737 records identified, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria. Total sample size of included studies was 1392 
(944 females, 418 males, 30 unreported). Dance was equally as effective as other physical activity interventions in improv-
ing quality of life for people with Parkinson’s disease [mean difference 3.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) − 2.13 to 8.30; 
p = 0.25], reducing anxiety (standardised mean difference 2.26; 95% CI − 2.37 to 6.90; p = 0.34), and improving depressive 
symptoms (standardised mean difference 0.78; 95% CI − 0.92 to 2.48; p = 0.37). Preliminary evidence found dance to be 
superior to other physical activity interventions to improve motivation, aspects of memory, and social cognition and to 
reduce distress. Preliminary evidence found dance to be inferior to other physical activity interventions to improve stress, 
self-efficacy and language fluency.
Conclusion  Undertaking structured dance of any genre is generally equally and occasionally more effective than other types 
of structured exercise for improving a range of psychological and cognitive outcomes.

Key Points 

Structured dance of at least 6 weeks’ duration can 
significantly improve psychological and cognitive health 
outcomes equivalent to other forms of structured exer-
cise or physical activity.

Preliminary evidence suggests dance may be better than 
other physical activities to improve emotional wellbe-
ing, depression, motivation, social cognition and some 
aspects of memory.

1  Introduction

1.1   Physical Activity Effect on Psychological 

and Cognitive Health

The lifetime prevalence of mental disorders is estimated to 
be between 26 and 33%, accounting for 9% to nearly 17% 
of the total burden of all disease worldwide [1, 2]. Those 
affected have 10–15 years shorter life expectancy, up to three 
times higher risk of developing a chronic disease, and lower 
quality of life [3–5]. The most common mental health prob-
lems are depression and anxiety, contributing to the leading 
causes of death worldwide (e.g. death by suicide, coronary 
heart disease and stroke) [6–8]. While mental illness can 
affect people across the lifespan, cognitive impairment refers 
to cognitive decline greater than expected with normal age-
ing. Cognitive impairment is linked to poorer medication 
adherence, poor physical and mental health, and higher mor-
bidity and mortality associated with increased cost of care 
and caregiver burden [9–11].

Exercise is a cost-effective treatment shown to signifi-
cantly improve psychological health and cognitive func-
tioning as well as positively alter health beliefs, ultimately 
lowering the healthcare burden driven by mental illness 
[12–16].  Some  mechanisms  by  which  exercise  achieves 
these outcomes are through triggering an increase in endor-
phin  levels,  neurotransmitter  production  and  distraction 
from feelings of depression and anxiety [17–19]. Despite 
the proven efficacy of exercise, 25% of adults are physically 
inactive [20]. Further, 50% of people who start an exercise 
programme will cease within half a year, while the adher-
ence rates in community-based and clinical trials are at best 
moderate at 52% and 66%, respectively [21,  22]. There-
fore, the provision of various exercise options that facilitate 
higher rates of adherence is warranted.

1.2   Dance as a Physical Activity Modality

Dance is a unique form of physical activity requiring com-
plex movements combined with aesthetics, music, cho-
reographed movement sequences and planned interactions 
with other people. A previous systematic review and meta-
analysis of the literature reported that structured weekly 
dance sessions over 6 or more weeks improved a number 
of physical health measures to the same extent (e.g. car-
diovascular function) or were superior (e.g. body mass 
index reduction) to other types of structured exercise [23].
Meeting  the  physical  activity  recommendations  and 
adherence to physical activity is the biggest challenge for 
people to achieve improvements to health [24]. Dance can 
be performed without much equipment and is associated 
with higher clinical trial completion rates of 86–100% [25, 
26]. Although there is limited substantiated evidence, it 
has been proposed that enjoyment of dance may increase 
adherence to physical activity [27], thereby enhancing 
health benefits.

Several elements may be responsible for the potential 
mental health effects of dance as a form of exercise. Exer-
cise in general has been found to improve cognition in 
both healthy populations [28], as well as populations with 
cognitive conditions such as attentional deficit hyperac-
tivity disorder [29] and mild cognitive impairment, who 
may indeed be able to expect greater positive cognitive 
outcomes from participating in physical exercise [30]. A 
recent systematic review found that, while aerobic endur-
ance  exercise  produces  improvements  in  general  and 
domain-specific cognition, coordinative exercise resulted 
in larger effect sizes for improvement in cognitive func-
tion than endurance, resistance, or mixed exercise [28]. In 
addition, exercising in a group setting has been shown to 
have additional mental health benefits as compared with 
exercising alone [31]. Dance, which is often undertaken 
in a group setting, requires aerobic endurance and is an 
inherently coordinative activity, incorporating elements 
of learning and mastering individual steps, performing 
those steps in a set order, and then remembering those 
sequences while performing them in time to music. Dance 
provides participants with additional health benefits due 
to the social and interactive aspects, its enjoyable nature 
and its unique cognitive challenges [32].

1.3   Dance and Psychological Health

The  supportive  social  nature  and  partnership  of  dance 
enhances participant enjoyment [33] and provides social 
engagement, accountability and psychological relaxation 
which may assist with managing mental disorders, such 

 
as anxiety and depression [26, 33, 34]. Socialising both in 
and after dance class generates a sense of community and 
kinship that adds to the dancer's self-identity and mental 
wellbeing [35].

Dance  participation  often  requires  dancers  to  touch, 
make eye contact and synchronise movements to music, an 
instructor, a partner or a group. Performing exertive move-
ments in synchrony with others has been linked with release 
of endorphins [36, 37], a peptide implicated in the social 
bonding often experienced during group musical activities 
[38]. Additionally, performing movements simultaneously 
with others is suggested to cause some ‘merging of self and 
other’ via the neural pathways coding for action and per-
ception [39]. Other properties of dance participation that 
can increase social bonding, and therefore psychological 
health, relate to shared intention and cooperation [40] and 
increased physical awareness of self in relation to others in 
space [41]. The experience of trustful interpersonal touch, 
which often occurs during participation in dance, has been 
associated with beneficial effects such as enhanced homeo-
static regulation and immunoregulation [42] and increased 
body appreciation [41]. The process of dancers focusing on 
their body from within during the ‘here and now’ has been 
proposed to induce mindfulness, a state of present-centred 
awareness [42] and is reported to promote improved coping 
skills and self-regulation [43].

In a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating 
the effect of dance on cognition, depression and quality 
of life in older adults, the majority of the included studies 
utilised non-active comparator groups such as usual care, 
wait list and/or education [44]. Dance for Parkinson’s dis-
ease was shown to be successful at alleviating symptoms 
of depression and anxiety and improving quality of life and 
some cognitive skills in one study; however, the comparator 
group was non-active [45]. Whilst many forms of exercise 
are known to have favourable effects on psychological and 
cognitive health compared with non-active comparators, the 
gap in knowledge now lies in relation to the effectiveness of 
dance relative to an active comparator.

1.4   Dance and Cognition

Dancing requires superior motor planning and memory, 
multitasking, and focused and conscious attention [45] to 
learn new movement patterns, remember choreographed 
sequences of movement [44, 46, 47], moving in time with 
the music, and particular focus and attention on movement 
quality and artistic expression. Imaging studies have sug-
gested that dance has neuroprotective effects, preventing 
age-related degeneration of the brain for memory functions 
and increasing resting-state activity in the fronto-temporal 
areas assumed to maintain memory and cognitive functions 
[48, 49].

1181

Current  studies  investigating  the  effects  of  dance 
on  cognition  highlight  the  need  to  control  for  various 
aspects of intervention design. Tango dancing improved 
motor–cognitive performance in a body position spatial 
task and maintained cognitive function of older adults. 
However, as the comparator group was not active, it is 
unknown if a standard exercise programme would pro-
duce  similar  results  [50].  Kattenstroth  and  colleagues 
[51] reported that older adults, with a history of partici-
pating in regular recreational dance, performed better on 
two different cognitive tests compared with the control 
group of non-dancers or participants in sporting activities. 
Similarly, older adults with metabolic syndrome showed 
improved cognition in verbal fluency and memory func-
tion when compared with a non-active control group [52]. 
Given the evidence supporting the role of structured exer-
cise to improve cognition, a truly active comparator group 
would further our understanding of the effectiveness of 
dance as an intervention.

The value of physical activity combined with care and 
instruction from a clinician or movement instructor should 
not be overlooked when assessing the efficacy of dance. 
Kosmat and Vranic [53] accounted for the potential con-
founding effect of therapist contribution by ensuring the 
active control group met with a researcher for the same 
time and frequency as the dance group so that any effect of 
therapeutic alliance [54] would have the same dosage [55]. 
When a comparator group has the potential to gain similar 
health benefits from being physically active and may have 
the additional improvements due to personal care from a 
clinician or movement instructor, then it will be easier to 
determine the potency of dance as an alternative modality.

1.5   Study Purpose

The aim of this study was to systematically review the lit-
erature to investigate the effectiveness of structured dance 
interventions on psychological and cognitive outcomes 
compared with other forms of structured physical activ-
ity across the lifespan. We hypothesised that dance may 
improve psychological and cognitive health outcomes that 
are influenced by social engagement and support. The sec-
ondary aim of this systematic review was to compare the 
rates of adherence between structured dance interventions 
and structured physical activity programmes. Our null 
hypothesis was that adherence to dance would be equal 
to adherence to structured physical activity programmes. 
Understanding how dance can impact psychological and 
cognitive health can assist clinicians to recommend dance 
for specific psychological and cognitive health outcomes.

2   Methods

The protocol for this review was registered in the PROS-
PERO  international  prospective  register  of  systematic 
reviews  (CRD42018099637).  The  process  of  complet-
ing  and  reporting  this  review  adhered  to  the  Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis 
(PRISMA) Statement guidelines [56].

2.1   Inclusion Criteria

Studies were included if they were a full original peer-
reviewed study that compared a structured dance inter-
vention with any other form of physical activity. Dance 
classes were required to have an instructor teaching any 
genre of dance with choreographed movement sequences, 
and planned interactions with other people. Dance classes 
needed to occur for at least 4 weeks to ensure potential 
psychological or cognitive changes would be evident. Out-
come measures had to include a psychological or cognitive 
health outcome(s) through scales, examinations or surveys 
for example. There were no restrictions imposed on age, 
clinical condition or language.

2.2   Exclusion Criteria

Excluded were systematic reviews, narrative reviews or 
individual case studies; those that reported only on physi-
cal health outcomes; those where dance groups were com-
bined with other forms of exercise or physical activity; 
those where dance movement therapy or improvised dance 
was examined; or studies where the control group did not 
include physical activity.

2.3   Systematic Search

Eight  electronic  databases  were  searched:  MEDLINE, 
Embase, PEDro, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials  (CENTRAL),  SPORTDiscus,  Web  of  Science, 
Scopus and PsycINFO. No language or publication date 
restrictions were imposed, and the last search was com-
pleted in July 2022. The authorship team developed the 
search strategy, with the assistance of an experienced med-
ical librarian. The search terms used to identify the articles 
were: [danc* or ballet or ballroom or jazz or ballroom or 
salsa or tango or folk] AND [depress* or mood* or mem-
ory or anxi* or “social engagement” or “quality of life” or 
fear* or stress or empowerment or “response inhibition” or 
well-being or cognit* or “executive function” or “informa-
tion processing” or self-efficacy or self-esteem or “mental

health” or wellness]. MESH headings were searched for 
additional key words to be included.

After conducting the search, one of the authors (K.D.) 
removed all duplicates. Screening of titles and abstracts of 
the remaining records was completed by two independent 
reviewers of the authorship team. Full-text articles were 
then retrieved for all remaining records and screened by two 
independent reviewers of the authorship team. In the case 
of uncertainty as to whether a study met inclusion criteria, 
cases were resolved by the primary author (A.F.Y.). Refer-
ence lists of each included study were examined to identify 
and locate potential additional studies.

2.4   Data Extraction

From identified studies, specific information and data were 
then extracted by two independent reviewers of the author-
ship team. Information included author, year, participant 
characteristics, population studied, details of the dance inter-
vention, details of the active comparator, session duration, 
frequency, study length and follow-up, retention (calculated 
as the proportion of the initial sample size that completed the 
study) and adherence to the intervention (calculated as the 
proportion of sessions participated in of the total sessions 
offered). Missing information was denoted as ‘not reported’. 
The accuracy and veracity of extracted data was checked by 
two reviewers (L.N. and C.C.).

2.5   Study Quality Assessment

Two independent reviewers of the authorship team assessed 
the study quality of each included study. Two different criti-
cal appraisal tools were used as appropriate to the study 
design. The first was a 13-item tool for assessing risk of bias 
in randomised controlled trials [57], and the second was a 
9-item tool for assessing risk of bias in non-experimental 
studies [57]. There was no exclusion of studies based on the 
quality assessment results. Disagreements were resolved by 
discussion between assessors.

2.6   Quantitative Analysis

During data extraction, there were several studies which 
examined similar psychological outcomes, using the same 
tool. Therefore, with complete pre- and post-intervention 
data reporting, a meta-analytical synthesis became feasible. 
When two or more studies examined a given outcome vari-
able (e.g. PDQ-39), raw mean and standard deviation data 
at pre- and post-intervention stages for both dance and com-
parison exercise groups were transferred to Review Manager 
software (RevMan [PC] Version 5.4, the Cochrane Collabo-
ration, 2020). Data related to two psychological outcomes 
were  transferred  for  independent  analysis.  For  each,  an 

 
invariance random effects model was applied [58], assuming 
studies drew potentially from divergent populations and con-
texts; included possibly different research designs; and tested 
different dance genres and had different exercise comparison 
groups. Thus, a true exact effect size was not expected to 
exist across studies. Unadjusted mean differences (MD) and 
standardised mean differences (SMD) were applied depend-
ing on whether the psychological outcome variables used 
consistent forms of measurement. Overall pooled estimates 
and confidence intervals indicated the effect of dance versus 
exercise comparison interventions and were summarised in 
forest plots. The Z and p values tested the null hypothesis 
that pooled estimates of dance groups were no more effective 
than exercise comparison groups. As MD analyses retained 
their common unit metric of measurement, their functional 
meaning and interpretation were retained. Meanwhile, as 
SMD is on a standard deviation scale and does not have a 
unit of measurement, effect sizes were classified as small 
(± 0.2) moderate (± 0.5) and large (± 0.8) on the basis of 
Cohen’s recommendations [59]. The I2 statistic identified 
the proportion of observed variance reflecting differences 
in true effect sizes as opposed to sampling error. If found, 
moderate (≥ 0.50) to high values (> 75%) were used to sug-
gest heterogeneity in effect sizes between studies. Where 
studies reported that dance had a greater significant effect 
compared with the standard exercise comparator and did 

1183

not fulfil criteria for meta-analysis but still reported com-
plete data (i.e. pre–post dance and exercise means, standard 
deviations and sample size), study effect size estimates were 
generated using the Hedges’ g statistic [60]. Again, effect 
sizes were classified as small (± 0.2) moderate (± 0.5) and 
large (± 0.8), on the basis of the positive or negative direc-
tion of the favoured trend [61].

Is it clear in the 
study what 
is the ‘cause’ 
and what is 
the ‘effect’ 
(i.e. there is no 
confusion about 
which variable 
comes first)?
Were the partici-
pants included 
in any compari-
sons similar?

Were the 

participants 
included in any 
comparisons 
receiving simi-
lar treatment/
care, other than 
the exposure or 
intervention of 
interest?

Was there a con-
trol group?
Were there mul-
tiple measure-
ments of the 
outcome both 
pre and post the 
intervention/
exposure?
Was follow-up 

complete, and, 
if not, were 
differences 
between groups 
in terms of 
their follow-
up adequately 
described and 
analysed?

Were the 

outcomes of 
participants 
included in any 
comparisons 
measured in the 
same way?
Were outcomes 
measured in a 
reliable way?
Was appropri-
ate statistical 
analysis used?

Dance Interventions and Mental and Cognitive Health1188

A. Fong Yan et al.

were non-RCTs [76–83]. Of the 19 RCTs, only 2 studies 
clearly stated that participants were blinded [64, 66]. All 
but two studies [70, 73] clearly used appropriate statisti-
cal analysis and study design. The non-RCTs all measured 
outcomes in a reliable way, and all but one [81] clearly 
described appropriate statistical analysis. However, descrip-
tion of the participants in each group, description of whether 
the groups were receiving equivalent treatments outside the 
intervention, and reporting of follow-up were largely unclear 
or missing. Neville and Makopoulou (2021) was the only 
study to receive ‘yes’ responses to all items of the critical 
appraisal tool [82].

3.3   Summary of Studies

Studies included between 18 and 291 participants, with 
a combined total of 1392 participants (944 females, 418 
males, 30 unreported). Nine population groups were rep-
resented: healthy people (n = 14), those with Parkinson’s 
disease (n = 4), low cognition (n = 3), cerebral palsy (n = 1), 
fibromyalgia  (n = 1),  generalised  musculoskeletal  pain 
(n = 1), unexplained falls (n = 1), breast cancer (n = 1) and 
chronic heart failure (n = 1). The included studies were cat-
egorised into age groups (Table 3).

Descriptions of interventions used in the included studies 
are presented in Table 4. Dance interventions consisted of 
both partnered and individual, with the following dance gen-
res included: aerobic dance (Zumba, step dance), theatrical 
dance styles (modern, jazz), ballroom (rumba, waltz, jive, 
Latin American, salsa, rock ‘n roll), dance gaming, dance-
based physical education, and cultural dances (line dance, 
square dance, qi gong, belly dance, folk dances of Brazil, 
Poland, England, Ireland, Greece and Argentina). The dance 
sessions varied in duration from 30 min [77] to 90 min [64, 
67, 69, 75, 81] per session. Frequency of sessions ranged 
from once per week [72, 75, 78, 81, 82] to four times per 
week [73]. One study [79] did not report on session length 
or frequency. Follow-up ranged from 6 weeks [82, 84] to 
18 months [69].

Measures of adherence included retention of participants 
in each intervention, rate of attendance, and maintenance of 
intensity of the intervention. Twelve of the 27 included stud-
ies reported greater retention in the dance intervention, and 7 
studies reported equal retention. Five reported greater reten-
tion in the physical activity comparator group. Three studies 
did not report the rate of retention in the dance or exercise 
interventions. The lowest adherence to an intervention was 
33% [70]. Only six studies reported attendance at the inter-
ventions [62, 65, 78, 83–85], with one study adding detail 
that attendance was recorded within the first ten minutes of 
class [84]. Two studies reported on attendance requirements 
to meet inclusion in statistical analyses [65, 83]. Only two 
studies accounted for intensity of the interventions as an 

element of adherence, with one only reporting the intensity 
for the weight training comparator group [76] and the other 
study attempting to mimic the aerobic intensity of the dance 
intervention for the active control group [64].

3.4   Meta‑analysis of Psychological Outcomes

The 39-item Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) 
assesses the frequency with which people with the condition 
experienced difficulty across eight domains of daily life and 
its impact on their quality of life. While some items clearly 
assess mental health, others assess physical health. Based 
on the three independent studies utilising PDQ-39, meta-
analysis did not identify a significant pooled MD estimate 
(PDQ-39 3.09; 95% CI − 2.13 to 8.30; Z = 1.16; p = 0.25), 
suggesting dance interventions did not have a greater effect 
relative to exercise interventions on how often people with 
Parkinson’s  disease  experience  difficulties  during  daily 
living [72, 75, 83] (Fig. 2). Based on the two independent 
studies investigating anxiety using a variety of tools, meta-
analysis did not identify a significant pooled SMD estimate 
(anxiety 2.26; 95% CI − 2.37 to 6.90; Z = 0.96;  p = 0.34), 
suggesting dance interventions did not have a greater effect 
on  anxiety  compared  to  exercise  interventions  [66,  81] 
(Fig. 3). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item 
questionnaire that assesses the symptoms associated with 
depression. Two studies could not be included in the meta-
analysis due to insufficient data reported to calculate SMD 
[70, 80]. Based on the two independent studies investigating 
depression using the BDI and BDI-II, meta-analysis did not 
identify a significant pooled SMD estimate (BDI 0.78; 95% 
CI − 0.92 to 2.48; Z = 0.90; p = 0.37), suggesting dance inter-
ventions did not have a greater effect on depressive symp-
toms compared with exercise interventions [85, 86] (Fig. 4).
It was not possible to perform meta-analysis on the three 
studies that reported on quality of life using the 12-item 
Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) [66], the 36-item Short 
Form Survey (SF-36) [69], the Life Satisfaction Index (LSI) 
[69] and the Brief Multidimension Life Satisfaction Scale 
(BMLSS) [72]. Each of these four outcome measures is 
composed of varying domains/subscales that measure dif-
ferent constructs.

3.5   Psychological and Cognitive Outcomes 

in Children (16 Years and Under)

Three studies investigated these outcomes in children. One 
study [66] examined the effects of Turo (qi gong dance) on 
negative psychological symptoms such as somatisation (i.e. 
distress arising from perceptions of bodily dysfunction) and 
hostility (i.e. thoughts, feelings and actions that are charac-
teristic of the negative affect state of anger) in children under 
16 years of age. The Turo group demonstrated significant

*Significant difference reported between groups

time × group interactions in the psychological symptoms of 
somatisation and hostility compared with the control group, 
who performed Turo movements without the concept of 
meridian Qi flow. There were no significant differences in 
other sections of the questionnaire. Two studies found the 
effect of jazz dance [71] and dance-based physical education 
classes [82] was equivalent to standard physical education 
classes in primary school children for cognitive outcome 
measures.

3.6   Psychological and Cognitive Outcomes in Adults 

(17–54 Years)

Ten studies [62, 67, 70, 73, 76, 79, 81, 85–87] investigated 
psychological and cognitive health benefits of dance com-
pared with other forms of physical activity in adults aged 
17–54 years. A majority of psychological and cognitive 
outcomes demonstrated equivalent changes or equivalent 
lack of changes as a result of the dance and exercise com-
parator interventions. However, Zumba demonstrated greater 
improvement in working memory compared with treadmill 
exercise (g = 0.34) [86].

Barene et al. found that soccer improved the self-effi-
cacy and emotional wellbeing of hospital employees after 
12 weeks compared with Zumba; however, the improve-
ments were equivalent by the end of the 40-week interven-
tion [62]. Soccer or volleyball also improved depressive 
symptoms compared with aerobic dance in tertiary students 
[81]. Bass and colleagues [76] found that weight training 
was more effective at reducing stress than aerobic dance; 
however, there were significant between-group sex differ-
ences noted and the session duration for the weight training 
intervention was not reported.

Modern dance demonstrated greater improvements in 
psychosocial adjustments (g = − 9.12) and in cognitive func-
tion (g = − 9.12) compared with kinesiotherapy in a popula-
tion of young adults with cerebral palsy [74]. There was no 
significant difference in cognitive performance (reciting sub-
tractions) of older adults between 1950 to 1970s style dance 
classes and a combination of strength and endurance training 
[64]. Both dance and brisk walking improved response time 
in the flanker test, which examines interference control, with 
no significant difference between the two groups of elderly 
females [77].

3.7   Psychological and Cognitive Outcomes in Older 

Adults (55 Years and Over)

Fourteen studies [63–65, 67–69, 72, 75, 77, 78, 83, 84, 88, 
89] investigated psychological and cognitive health benefits 
of dance compared with other forms of physical activity in 
adults aged 55 years or older. Eleven of these 14 studies 
demonstrated equivalent psychological/cognitive changes, 
or equivalent lack of change as a result of the dance and 
exercise comparator interventions [64, 67–69, 75, 77, 78, 
83, 84, 88, 89]; three studies showed dance had a superior 
effect [63, 65, 72]. A meta-analysis was unable to be per-
formed on the four studies that included a working memory 
outcome measure due to the different constructs assessed 
by each [90]. The Virginia Cognitive Aging Project Task 
Battery measures spatial memory [89], the N-Back Task 
measures accuracy of image or letter recall [86], and a list 
sorting task, presented both visually and auditorily/verbally, 
measures sequence stimuli recall [71], while the Digit Span 
Backwards Task measures working memory capacity by 
recalling a verbal numerical stimulus [68].

A choreographed dance programme combining various 
forms of dance styles (salsa, rock, rumba, pop and jive) had 
greater impact on verbal memory recognition than a physical 
therapy-based exercise intervention (g = 1.24) in an older 
adult  population  with  mild  cognitive  impairments  [63]. 
Greek dance resulted in greater improvements in intrinsic 
motivation in the domains of enjoyment/interest (g = 2.96), 
effort/importance  (g = 3.49)  and  perceived  competence 
(g = 1.76), for participants with chronic heart failure, when 
compared with a traditional aerobic and resistance training 
programme [65]. Two studies reported that exercise pro-
grammes incorporating strength, flexibility, endurance and 
balance training were associated with a greater change in 
verbal fluency in those with amnestic mild cognitive impair-
ment (g = 0.71) [63], and in fluency of task switching and 
spatial working memory in healthy older adults (effect size 
unable to be calculated) [89], when compared with dance.
Reporting on health-related quality of life, Dahmen-Zim-
mer and Jansen reported only on the physical sub-score of 
the SF-12 [78], finding no effect of the dance intervention 
for their participants with Parkinson’s disease. Kaltsatou and 
colleagues reported that for their chronic heart failure par-
ticipants, the Life Satisfaction Index (a measure of QoL), of 
the Greek dance group correlated positively with time spent 
exercising and with change in the mental health subscale of 
the SF-36; however, the authors did not report whether the 
QoL of participants in the dance group differed from that of 
the combined aerobic and resistance exercise group [65]. No 
significant difference in the BMLSS was reported by Poier 
and colleagues between the group with Parkinson’s disease 
who undertook Tango dancing compared with those who 
did Tai Chi [72].

4   Discussion

4.1   Overview of Main Findings

Dance was as effective as other physical activity inter-
ventions  in  improving  multiple  dimensions  of  psycho-
logical  and  cognitive  outcomes  (Table  4).  The  studies 
included participants across the lifespan (7–85 years) and 
healthy to chronically diseased samples (i.e. Parkinson’s 
disease, heart failure, cerebral palsy, fibromyalgia). The 
dance interventions encompassed a broad range of genres 
including theatrical dance, aerobic dance, traditional dance 
forms and social dance, and were compared with a broad 
range of physical activities including team sport, martial 
arts, walking and weight training.

There is preliminary evidence to suggest that dance 
may be superior to other physical activity interventions 
for the psychological outcomes of motivation [65], dis-
tress (hostility and somatisation) [66], depression [86], 
emotional wellbeing [72] and cognitive outcomes of ver-
bal memory recognition [63], working memory [86] and 
social cognition (psychosocial adjustments and cognitive 
function) [74]. Dance was found to be inferior to other 
physical activity interventions for the psychological out-
comes of motivation stress [76], and self-efficacy [78]. 
Despite generally having higher participation in dance and 
exercise [91], only five of the included studies investigated 
psychological and cognitive function in younger people 
(mean age below 25 years) [66, 73, 74, 76, 79], warranting 
further research.

4.2   Differences Between Dance and Exercise Across 

the Lifespan

Even though we can conclude that dance is equivalent to 
other forms of physical activity in improving a number of 
psychological and cognitive domains, we cannot make rec-
ommendations for a specific population. The differences 
found are linked to differences in outcome measures used, 
genres of dance, dosage of the dance and comparator physi-
cal activity interventions, and population type (e.g. diseased/
healthy). It may be that dance, like physical activity, has 
different impacts depending on type of dance and age [92].
Physical activity in general elicits benefits to health and 
wellbeing across the lifespan. However, much like any skill-
based  activity,  self-efficacy  for  exercise  (e.g.  perceived 
motor competence) is a strong predictor of engagement with 
physical activity, with perceived motor competence being 
strongly associated with the amount of physical activity reg-
ularly undertaken, starting in early childhood and continu-
ing throughout the entire lifespan [93, 94]. Perceived motor 
competence may influence the likelihood that an individual 
attempts a new activity later in life [95], and given that 

A. Fong Yan et al.

many adults and older adults are physically inactive [96], 
it is reasonable that many adults will need to take up a new 
physical activity in order to meet physical activity guide-
lines. Since foundational motor skills easily transfer between 
similar activities [94], physical activities like those under-
taken as a child may be more likely to be attempted than 
unfamiliar activities. Therefore, if an individual engaged 
in dance, aerobics or gymnastics as a child, coming to any 
form of dance as an adult may feel familiar and ‘easy to 
master’ compared with other forms of exercise. In this way, 
dance may be considered an approachable activity to begin 
as an adult; many cultures have traditional dances that will 
be familiar from one’s youth, removing the barrier of unfa-
miliarity when approaching a new (dance) physical activity. 
However, even if an individual has low motor competence 
for a given activity, the influence of social acceptability, or 
motivation generated by engaging in an activity with peo-
ple of a similar age and sex may overcome feelings of poor 
motor competence and enable sustained engagement with 
the new physical activity [95, 97, 98]. Indeed, the aspects 
of ‘social acceptability’ and ‘fun’ are key features of the 
very successful Zumba movement leading to participation in 
regular dance as an accessible form of exercise independent 
of age, body composition and fitness level.

4.3   Selection of Psychological and Cognitive 

Outcome Measures

The impact of dance on cognitive health outcomes in the 
oldest age group suggests that dance has additional cognitive 
benefits beyond those attributed to exercise in older people. 
This may be because of the combination of exercise and 
cognitive challenge for which there is emerging evidence 
of benefits on cognition compared with exercise only [99]. 
This may not be unexpected, given the interest in interven-
tions that assist in slowing down impacts of aging on cogni-
tive and physical functioning, and enhance quality of life in 
older adults. However, it presents an opportunity for future 
researchers to additionally incorporate the measurement 
of psychological variables within their studies, to explore 
a broader perspective of the benefits of dance across both 
domains and potential relationships between the two.

This systematic review provides preliminary evidence 
that different dance genres have psychological effects in 
various domains due to specific elements within the dance 
intervention. For example, Turo (qi gong dance) dance may 
have therapeutic effects on psychological and stress-related 
disorders in healthy, female youth [66]. This is consistent 
with the literature suggesting that arts interventions improve 
mental health through creative self-expression [100]. Mod-
ern dance classes based on Feldenkrais, Horton, Graham 
and Laban/Bartenieff concepts assisted in improving psycho-
social adjustment in cerebral palsy [74] and incorporated

elements of somatic practice and awareness which might be 
akin to psychological mindfulness techniques requiring body 
and breath awareness. Further investigation is warranted to 
understand what aspect of dance genres may facilitate being 
more comfortable with moving one’s own body and being 
able to express emotions through the medium of dance.

A predominance of social dance genres being investi-
gated for psychological health effects in older adults, com-
bined with largely positive outcomes for these measures 
(i.e. QoL [65], internal motivation [65], balance confidence 
[67],  emotional  wellbeing  [78]),  raises  questions  as  to 
whether it is the dancing itself to which the reported posi-
tive psychological effects can be attributed or whether it is 
the highly social nature of the dance activity, or a combina-
tion. In contrast to the genres assessed for older adults, six 
of the seven studies of participants under 55 years examined 
the effects of dance genres that could be performed indi-
vidually in a group setting, i.e. aerobic dance [70, 73, 76], 
somatic dance styles [74], modern dance [79] and qi gong 
[66], suggesting that it is in fact the dancing that improves 
psychological health.

The  variety  of  psychological  and  cognitive  outcome 
measures included makes conclusions across the lifespan 

difficult. The outcomes may have been selected to reflect 
particular genres, but the genres themselves may appeal 
more to older (e.g. social dance) or younger (e.g. modern 
dance) dancers. Repeating the studies in a broader age group 
may not be feasible if the preference is not for that dance 
style. Some outcomes may not have been considered as rele-
vant in different age groups (e.g. working memory in youth), 
or simply not explored across different genres.

4.4   Considerations for Intervention Design

Whether  the  psychological  and/or  cognitive  benefits  of 
dance are maintained in the short, medium or long term 
following these dance interventions is unknown, as only 
one paper followed up participants after the completion of 
the intervention. McKinley and colleagues [67] reported 
on their outcome (activities-specific balance confidence) 
1 month after a 10-week intervention of Argentine Tango 
versus walking, finding maintenance of improved confidence 
but no between-group difference. Two studies followed up 
participants after reducing the frequency of the interven-
tions and found equivalent benefit for the dance and exercise 
interventions [62, 69].

Dance Interventions and Mental and Cognitive Health1200

A. Fong Yan et al.

Both the dance and comparator physical activity interven-
tions varied substantially between studies not only with con-
tent but also with the exercise ‘dose’. The session length of 
the dance interventions and their active comparators across 
the 27 studies ranged from 30 to 90 min and the frequency 
from one to four times per week, while the duration varied 
from 6 weeks to 18 months. This variance in session length, 
frequency and intervention duration consequently made it 
difficult to draw direct comparisons with regard to the poten-
tial generalisability of the findings for psychological and 
cognitive benefits. Although the physical activity dose was 
comparable within studies, we cannot be confident that all 
the physical activity intensities were comparable between 
studies.

Finally, of interest is whether the intention of the classes 
for each dance genre was to focus specifically on providing 
a positive psychological health outcome. While participation 
in dance classes can often be highly social and interactive, 
it is not clear whether any specific modifications were made 
to the delivery of the classes to facilitate enhanced psycho-
logical outcomes for the purposes of the research studies, 
or if the classes were run authentically without any delivery 
modifications aiming to elicit improvements in the outcome 
measures. The modern dance class based on somatic con-
cepts like Feldenkrais, the dance-like practice of martial 
arts forms qi gong and Kata in Karate and potentially yoga 
classes  with  specific  sequencing  may  have  confounding 
benefits due to the mindfulness component of their respec-
tive philosophies. Research has found that mindfulness can 
improve psychological health and wellbeing [101]; however, 
it is unknown if there is any summative effect of simulta-
neous physical activity and mindfulness of movement that 
occurs in dance. For future studies, comprehensive reporting 
on the class design process would help determine the spe-
cific intent for delivery of each dance genre and the potential 
implementation into the community.

4.5   Considerations for Study Quality

The low to moderate quality of the included studies in this 
review was primarily due to the lack of blinding and the 
reporting of equivalent treatment for both groups. Overall, 
the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in this 
review were of a higher quality than the non-randomised 
controlled trials. The RCTs offered more reliability in their 
results as follow-up of participants and use of similar groups 
at baseline for comparison were clearly reported. Bias was 
also reduced through randomisation, rather than allowing 
participants to select which intervention they were assigned 
to. Confusion was noted as studies used the term ‘follow-up’ 
when referring to measurements taken immediately ‘post-
intervention’ rather than true follow-up measurements taken 

after a wash-out period subsequent to the completion of the 
intervention.

Two studies demonstrated the highest quality amongst 
those included [64, 67]. These two RCTs ensured true ran-
domisation, appropriate baseline and outcomes analysis, and 
reported on comparison groups with similar characteristics. 
However, it was assessed that both studies lacked appropri-
ate blinding. It is reasonable that it may be difficult to blind 
participants and the practitioners delivering the interven-
tions to group allocation. However, it is important to not 
only blind the assessor measuring the outcome variables 
to group allocation but to also report this blinding in the 
manuscript. Reporting blinding will help readers determine 
the mitigated risk of bias that was conducted and how this 
may impact the researchers’ interpretation of the results. 
Reporting the full treatment available to participants in a 
trial will also have a substantial impact on the results of the 
study. Understanding if the participants are receiving truly 
equivalent interventions (in terms of total time face to face 
with clinicians/instructors, advice regarding physical activ-
ity or self-management of their conditions, and medication) 
will ensure that the outcomes measured are more likely to be 
associated with the different intervention modality.

The results of this study should be analysed with caution 
due to the low-to-moderate quality of the included studies. 
Without high-quality studies, confidence in the effectiveness 
of dance to improve psychological and cognitive outcomes 
is  lower.  Improving  the  quality  of  research  in  this  field 
will enable clinicians to implement dance in an evidence-
based manner and have confidence that prescribing dance 
will improve mental health and wellbeing for participants. 
Research in the dance for health field would benefit from 
well-structured  study  designs  that  incorporate  assessor 
blinding to reduce the risk of bias, and clear reporting of 
the interventions and treatment conditions to account for 
confounders that may affect the study results.

4.6   Implications

The findings of this systematic review have implications for 
both clinical practice and future research. The benefits of 
dance interventions extend beyond physical health outcomes 
such as body composition, blood biomarkers, musculoskel-
etal health and cardiovascular function, to cognitive and 
psychological wellbeing. Given the similar, if not superior, 
benefits of dance on mental health and cognition, clinicians 
aiming to improve these can confidently support patients to 
choose either a traditional exercise or dance intervention. 
Exercise that is perceived to be boring is unlikely to improve 
cognition with the choice of type of exercise linked to enjoy-
ment [102]. Shared decision-making regarding the type of 
exercise/physical activity to address mental health and cog-
nitive impairment is pertinent to the general population as 

 
well as clinical populations (e.g. Parkinson's and cardiovas-
cular disease, cerebral palsy and generalised musculoskeletal 
pain) from adolescence to adulthood [103].

Enjoyment in an activity improves adherence and sus-
tainability in physical activity [104, 105]. Our systematic 
review reveals that, of the 24 studies that reported on study 
retention, 19 found the dance intervention had equal or better 
retention than the active control. The assumption here is that 
the recruited cohorts indeed enjoyed the dance intervention. 
However, enjoyment ratings of the allocated interventions 
were not collected, and adherence was poorly and inconsist-
ently recorded or reported. All aspects influencing enjoy-
ment should be considered, such as past experiences and 
autonomous motivation to exercise, because completion of 
a research study may not translate to sufficient ‘attendance’ 
at all offered sessions of physical activity or sustainable 
adherence [106, 107]. For example, simply collecting data 
relating to attendance does not guarantee compliance with 
an effective intensity or mental engagement with the physi-
cal activity to achieve the proposed psychological or cogni-
tive benefits. Individuals should be encouraged to undertake 
whichever physical activity modality they are most likely 
to enjoy, and therefore truly adhere to, to achieve optimal 
cognitive and mental health benefits.

We propose some recommendations for future research 
on the relative benefits of exercise and dance interventions 
on mental health and cognitive impairments. Researchers 
could consider the effect of shared decision-making regard-
ing group allocation of participants on firstly their satisfac-
tion with the intervention and secondly on their adherence. 
Follow-up should continue beyond the short-term effects of 
the interventions. Are participants more likely to continue 
undertaking some forms of physical activity beyond the 
period of the study intervention? Is this persistence with the 
physical activity correlated with their enjoyment, past expe-
rience or autonomous motivation? Standardised, reliable and 
valid assessment tools need to be used in this research to 
enable comparison of the effects of the interventions.

Since all interventions included in this review required 
participants to undertake supervised dance or exercise for a 
minimum of 6 weeks, we suggest this as a minimum period 
for  mental  health  and  cognitive  capacity  interventions. 
Those studies that demonstrated superior cognitive and psy-
chological benefits in favour of dance were undertaken for 
a period of at least two months, two times per week, with 
session durations between 40 and 60 min.

While pharmacological therapy continues to be standard 
treatment for mental health impairments, adverse effects 
influencing drop-out and drug interactions in populations 
with multiple co-morbidities are possible [108–110]. The 
high rate of non-adherence to such medications [111] sug-
gests that trials that compare medication with exercise as 
an adjunct to medication are warranted. Such research has 

1201

the potential to improve the societal and economic cost of 
medication as a stand-alone intervention for mental illness.

4.7   Strengths and Limitations

This review was conducted in a rigorous manner, with a 
priori specifications for all criteria, and all steps were con-
ducted by two researchers and overseen by a third. While 
only  three  variables  could  undergo  meta-analysis  with 
a small number of studies eligible for inclusion and high 
heterogeneity  between  those  studies,  the  inclusion  of  a 
broad range of dance styles and population groups is both 
a strength and a limitation of the review. Our findings can-
not be extended to unplanned and unchoreographed dance 
forms. Dance is a broad umbrella term that encompasses a 
wide variety of styles from highly structured, planned move-
ment sequencing to entirely unplanned, intuitive forms of 
body movement. To examine the effect of dance on psycho-
logical and cognitive parameters we chose to narrow the 
breadth of these dance forms to a more homogeneous inclu-
sion of structured dance to enable equivocal comparison 
with current exercise guidelines. Our results indicate that 
the benefits of structured, planned dance to psychological 
and cognitive health do not appear to be limited to a single 
dance style or single population group. However, with regard 
to clinical populations, as this review found five different 
clinical populations reported over eight studies, these studies 
need to be replicated before firm conclusions can be drawn 
about the relative benefits of dance for psychological health.
Other considerations to bear in mind when drawing con-
clusions from this review, and areas where future research 
can be improved, include: the short follow-up period in most 
of the included studies—in which data collection ceased at 
the conclusion of the active intervention; the uneven sex 
mix in the dance and control groups—particularly in non-
randomised studies in which males tended not to choose the 
dance intervention; underrepresentation of young people and 
specific clinical populations for whom dance may theoreti-
cally be of extra benefit to psychological wellbeing, such 
as those with cancer or other chronic diseases [26, 33, 34, 
40–42]; and the generally low quality of study design and 
reporting. There were significant sex disparities between the 
dance and active comparator groups in three studies [76, 
78, 79] that were not accounted for in the analysis of the 
data. The conflicting evidence regarding sex differences in 
cognitive functioning and psychological attributes limits the 
strength of the recommendations made in these studies, sug-
gesting caution is required when interpreting their results 
[112, 113].

Readers should also be cautious about generalising the 
findings of this review when implementing dance for health 
in the community. When designing dance interventions, 
inclusion of populations underrepresented in the current 

Dance Interventions and Mental and Cognitive Health1202

literature is warranted. For clinicians prescribing dance for 
patients, individual preference for physical activity modality 
and/or dance genre may impact the potential benefits of the 
programme. Many forms of dance are performed to music; 
however, music was not a factor that was controlled for in 
this review and this warrants future investigations to dis-
tinguish the effect of dance from that of the accompanying 
music. The evidence appears promising for dance as a suit-
able alternative to standard exercise programmes in several 
population groups and situations; however, this field requires 
more research to replicate those findings and strengthen the 
evidence for the effects of dance on psychological and cog-
nitive health.

5   Conclusions

Notwithstanding limitations, the findings of this review sug-
gest that dance is equivalent or superior to other physical 
activity interventions to improve psychological wellbeing 
and cognitive capacity. Structured dance can be considered 
an evidence-based alternative for individuals who might pre-
fer it to more traditional forms of exercise. In those 54 years 
and under, the current literature pool focuses on psycho-
logical outcomes, while for those 55 years and over, there is 
a greater focus on cognitive capacity. The effectiveness of 
dance interventions is most evident in the domains of self-
efficacy, anxiety, depression, motivation and health-related 
quality of life, particularly in older individuals. While there 
is considerably less evidence in those 16 years of age and 
below, dance appears to be superior to other exercise in less-
ening the impact of somatisation and hostility.
