Abstract
Background  The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder 
scale (GAD-7) are routinely used in research and clinical practice. Whilst measurement invariance of these measures 
across gender has been demonstrated individually in general population studies and clinical samples, less is known 
about invariance of the distinct but correlated latent factors (‘depression’ and ‘anxiety’). The current study assessed 
measurement invariance of these constructs across males and females seeking treatment for common mental health 
disorders.

Methods  Data were provided from eight psychological treatment services in London, England. Data from initial 
assessments with the services where individual items on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were available were included in 
analyses. Measurement invariance was explored across self-identified genders, with ‘male’ and ‘female’ categories 
available in the dataset. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using propensity score matching on sociodemographic 
and clinical variables.

Results  Data were available for 165,872 patients (110,833 females, 55,039 males). There was evidence of 
measurement invariance between males and females in both the full sample and a propensity score matched sample 
(n = 46,249 in each group).

Conclusions  Measurement invariance of the correlated depression and anxiety factors of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were 
indicated in this sample of individuals seeking psychological treatment for CMHDs. These results support the use of 
these measures in routine clinical practice for both males and females. This is of particular importance for assessing 
the prevalence of clinically significant levels of symptoms as well as comparing treatment outcomes across genders.

Background
Common  mental  health  disorders  (CMHDs),  including 
depression and anxiety disorders, affect hundreds of mil-
lions  of  people  around  the  world  each  year  [1].  Psycho-
logical therapies can be effective, but only around half of 
all  patients  recover  by  the  end  of  their  treatment  [2,  3]. 
Efforts  to  improve  treatment  outcomes  rely  on  robust 
means  of  measuring  and  monitoring  symptom  change, 
that need to be consistent and translatable across major 
patient  subgroups  who  seemingly  experience  different 
clinical  outcomes  [4,  5].  The  prevalence  of  CMHDs  is 
typically higher in females than males, and females make 
up  approximately  two-thirds  of  the  population  of  adults 
in  receipt  of  treatments  for  CMHDs  [6].  Several  poten-
tial  hypotheses  have  been  suggested  for  differences  in 
CMHD prevalence between males and females, but little 
attention has been given to the ways in which the symp-
toms of CMHDs are experienced between these groups. 
If there were differences in these experiences, the resul-
tant  measurement  error  would  make  it  challenging  to 
draw  valid  comparisons  across  males  and  females  when 
using  the  same  measurement  tools  or  scales  [4].  This 
might cast doubt on findings as to prevalence differences, 
but  also  on  evidence  suggesting  no  difference  exists  in 
treatment  outcomes  across  males  and  females  for  peo-
ple  with  depression  [7],  and  have  broader  implications 
for  the  use  of  measures  when  monitoring  and  evaluat-
ing the effects of treatments. Two of the most commonly 
used  measures  of  CMHD  symptoms,  the  9-item  Patient 
Health  Questionnaire  (PHQ-9  [8])  and  the  7-item  Gen-
eralised  Anxiety  Disorder  scale  (GAD-7  [9]),  are  widely 
used  in  research  and  clinical  practice.  Thus,  if  it  were 
found that these measures needed to be interpreted dif-
ferently between males and females then this would have 
major  consequences.  Therefore,  ascertaining  measure-
ment  invariance  in  the  use  of  these  measures  between 
males and females is important.

There  have  been  several  studies  exploring  psychomet-
ric  differences  in  measures  of  depression  and  anxiety 
between males and females, specifically using the PHQ-9 
and  the  GAD-7.  General  population  studies  have  dem-
onstrated  measurement  invariance  in  the  PHQ-9  [4, 
10,  11]  and  the  GAD-7  [12,  13]  in  non-clinical  samples 
between a range of sociodemographic groups, including 
by  gender.  Similar  findings  have  been  shown  in  clinical 
samples [14, 15]. However, given the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 
are frequently completed together, both in clinical prac-
tice as well as in research studies to estimate prevalence, 
considering  invariance  of  the  latent  structure  of  models 
including  the  PHQ-9  and  GAD-7  as  separate  but  cor-
related  constructs  of  ‘depression’  and  ‘anxiety’  is  likely 
to  have  greater  utility  and  to  be  of  greater  relevance  to 
routine  clinical  practice  and  research.  Such  invariance 
has  been  demonstrated  between  different  countries  in 

general  population  studies  [16],  but  less  is  understand 
about potential differences in males and females on these 
correlated constructs.

The aim of the current study was to explore measure-
ment invariance of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 as correlated 
latent  variables  between  males  and  females  seeking 
psychological  treatment  for  CMHDs.  Propensity  score 
matching,  where  females  and  males  were  matched  on  a 
range  of  sociodemographic  factors,  was  performed  to 
add to the robustness of findings by controlling for mea-
sured confounding factors.

Method
Participants

The  analytic  sample  comprised  all  individuals  referred 
to  eight  Improving  Access  to  Psychological  Therapies 
(IAPT)  services  that  were  members  of  the  North  and 
Central  East  London  IAPT  service  Improvement  and 
Research  Network  (NCEL  IAPT  SIRN)  [17,  18].  IAPT 
services  provide  evidence-based  psychological  treat-
ments  for  depression  and  anxiety  disorders,  across  all 
regions  in  England  using  a  stepped  care  model  (see[19] 
for  details  about  these  services).  Data  were  used  from 
January 2011 up until August 2020. Only baseline scores, 
that  is  scores  from  the  initial  assessment  with  the  ser-
vices, were included in the current analysis. Participants 
were included if: they had item-level data available for the 
PHQ-9 and GAD-7 from their initial assessment appoint-
ment,  they  were  aged  18  years  or  older  and  had  data 
available  about  their  gender.  Individuals  were  excluded 
whose  presenting  problem,  the  clinical  disorder  that  is 
to  be  the  focus  of  treatment  matched  to  ICD-10  codes 
[20],  was  for  a  disorder  for  which  there  was  no  estab-
lished  IAPT  treatment  protocol,  such  as  schizophrenia 
or  substance-misuse  problems  [19].  At  the  time  of  data 
collection  by  these  services,  the  only  available  options 
for  recording  self-identified  gender  were  ‘male’,  ‘female’, 
‘not  known’  or  ‘not  specified’.  Consequently,  it  was  not 
possible  to  estimate  invariance  across  all  genders  with 
only  individuals  who  reported  being  ‘female’  or  ‘male’ 
included,  (the  other  two  response  categories  treated  as 
missing).  It  is  acknowledged  that  the  binary  terms  male 
and  female,  whilst  commonplace  in  research,  even  in 
reporting of randomised controlled trials [7], are the only 
two  self-identifying  gender  descriptors  available  in  the 
dataset and do not fully encapsulate the range of ways in 
which individuals might choose describe their gender.

Measures
Patient health questionnaire nine-item (PHQ-9; [8])

The  PHQ-9  is  a  self-report  measure  consisting  of  nine 
items which approximately match the criteria for depres-
sion from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-
tal  Disorders  fourth  edition  (DSM-IV)  [21].  The  items 

Saunders et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:298 Page 3 of 9

include  anhedonia,  low  mood,  sleep,  fatigue,  appetite, 
low  self-esteem,  concentration,  psychomotor  distur-
bance, and suicidal ideation. Each item is scored 0 (“Not 
at all”) to 3 (“Nearly every day”), with total scores ranging 
from 0 to 27.

Deprivation (IMD) was available for individuals [22], and 
was collapsed into quintiles, with ‘1’ indicating the most 
deprived areas and ‘5’ the least deprived. Further details 
on these variables and their categorisation are presented 
in Appendix A.

Generalised anxiety disorder scale seven-item (GAD-7; [9])

The  GAD-7  is  a  self-report  measure  consisting  of  seven 
items  that  match  many  of  the  criteria  for  generalised 
anxiety  disorder  in  DSM-IV.  Items  include  nervousness, 
uncontrollable worrying, worrying about different things, 
issues  relaxing,  restlessness,  irritability,  and  fear.  As 
above, items are scored between 0 and 3, with total scores 
ranging from 0 to 21.

Additional variables

At  the  initial  assessment,  patients  completed  additional 
questions  covering  a  range  of  sociodemographic  and 
clinical variables. These included questions on: age, gen-
der,  ethnicity,  employment  status,  and  whether  they  are 
taking  psychotropic  medications.  The  Index  of  Multiple 

Statistical analysis
Multiple group confirmatory factors analysis (MGCFA)

Whilst  alternative  factor  structures  of  the  PHQ-9  have 
been proposed, such as the Cognitive-Affective/Somatic 
structure  [15],  for  the  current  analysis  we  considered 
only the unidimensional structure of each measure. This 
is because they are most commonly used in this manner 
in both research and clinical practice, and as correlations 
between  the  commonly  identified  sub-factors  are  high 
[15].  We  first  used  confirmatory  factor  analysis  (CFA) 
without considering gender groups to explore model fit. 
A  model  was  estimated  that  used  both  the  PHQ-9  and 
GAD-7 items, to construct two correlated latent variables 
for  ‘depression’  and  ‘anxiety’  respectively  (see  Fig.  1). 
Commonly  used  metrics  of  model  fit  for  CFA  were

estimated: the comparative fit index (CFI), the root mean 
squared  error  of  approximation  (RMSEA)  and  the  stan-
dardised  root  mean  square  residual  (SRMR).  CFI  values 
of  0.90  and  0.95  are  considered  indicative  of  acceptable 
and good model fit respectively [23]. For the RMSEA we 
considered  values < 0.05 indicative of  close fit, 0.05–0.08 
as acceptable fit and 0.08–0.1 as a moderate or ‘mediocre’ 
fit [24]. SRMR values below 0.05 are taken as good fit[23] 
and below 0.1 as acceptable [24].

Multiple group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) 
was then conducted using genders. The following models 
of invariance were estimated:

  • M1: Configural Invariance; same model structure 

between groups, and all parameters are free.
  • M2: Metric Invariance; invariance in loadings 

between groups.

  • M3: Scalar Invariance; invariance in loadings and 

intercepts.

  • M4: Residual Invariance; invariance in loadings, 

intercepts and residuals.

  • M5: Residual Invariance; invariance in loadings, 

intercepts, residuals and factor means.

  • M6: Residual Invariance; invariance in loadings, 
intercepts, residuals, factor means and variances.
The decision on whether to adopt a model, whereby there 
was  evidence  of  measurement  invariance  at  that  stage, 
was  made  by  comparing  the  change  in  model  fit  statis-
tics between the model in question (M) and the previous 
model  (M-1).  The  change  between  models  was  consid-
ered  within  tolerated  ranges,  when  the  difference  in  the 
CFI  value  (ΔCFI)  was  < 0.01,  the  ΔRMSEA  was  < 0.015 
and  the  ΔSRMR  was  < 0.030  [16,  25].  Whilst  χ2  values 
were  reported,  they  were  not  used  to  decide  on  model 
adoption due to known issues when using larger sample 
sizes [25].

Propensity score matching

Sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  using  a  matched 
sample  of  males  and  females.  Propensity  score  match-
ing  (PSM)  methods  [26]  were  used  to  explore  whether 
measurement invariance was observed when the groups 
were balanced on measured sociodemographic variables. 
Matched  controls  for  males  (the  smallest  group)  were 
identified  in  the  sample  of  females,  with  the  following 
matching variables: age, ethnicity, local healthcare trust, 
psychotropic medication status, employment status, IMD 
quintile  and  the  year  of  the  referral  to  the  service.  Any 
observation with missing data on matching variables was 
excluded. Baseline symptom severity (total scores of the 
PHQ-9  and  GAD-7)  was  not  included  in  the  matching 
because this would artificially create similar group mean 
scores, potentially biasing the estimates of measurement 
variance. Problem descriptors were not  included for the 
same reason, as these are likely to be related to symptom 

measure scores. Matching without replacement was per-
formed that meant the same control individual could be 
used  more  than  once,  as  the  best  match  for  more  than 
one male observation as per previous analyses [27], with 
a narrow caliper of 0.0001 used. Once a matched control 
sample  was  identified,  the  MGCFA  was  repeated  in  the 
same procedure as described above for the full sample.

Results
Descriptive statistics

From  the  initial  dataset  of  173,578  individuals  with 
item-level  data  availble  for  the  PHQ-9  and  the  GAD-7, 
n = 1,003 (0.58%) did not have a gender recorded (it was 
either  missing  or  recorded  as  ‘not  known’  or  ‘prefer  not 
to say’). In addition, n = 1,272 were less than 18 years old, 
and n = 5,431 were treated for a mental health condition 
for which there is not a treatment protocol in these ser-
vices  and  were  excluded  (see  Fig.  2  for  patient  flow  dia-
gram).  The  final  analytic  sample  included  n = 165,872 
patients,  where  n = 110,833  (66.8%)  were  female  and 
n = 55,039  (33.2%)  were  male.  The  sample  gender  split 
was  representative  of  that  observed  in  national  evalua-
tions of these services [28].

Descriptive  statistics  for  the  sample,  split  by  gender, 
are  presented  in  Table  1.  There  were  differences  in  the 
distributions of all baseline variables between males and 
females  although  effect  sizes  for  these  differences  were 
either small or negligible on recommended thresholds for 
Cramér’s V and Hedges’ g.

Confirmatory factor analysis

CFA was initially conducted on the full sample and then 
in groups stratified by gender, before the main MGCFAs 
were  performed.  The  full  sample  model  demonstrated 
acceptable fit on all metrics (RMSEA = 0.079, CFI = 0.907, 
SRMR = 0.049),  and  was  similar  for  both  the  female  and 
male  subgroups  (female:  RMSEA = 0.080,  CFI = 0.903, 
SRMR = 0.050;  male:  RMSEA = 0.077  CFI = 0.917, 
SRMR = 0.046). Unidimensionality of the PHQ-9 and the 
GAD-7 was therefore indicated within the model.

Multiple group confirmatory factor analysis – full sample

MGCFA results are presented in Table 2. The change in 
model  fit  statistics  were  below  criteria  values  through-
out  the  increasingly  strict  measurement  invariance  test-
ing  (from  M1  to  M6).  The  configural  invariance  model 
resulted  in  fit  statistics  similar  to  those  presented  for 
the full sample and all were within the acceptable range. 
There  was  limited  change  in  fit  statistics  when  exam-
ining  the  metric  invariance  model,  suggesting  metric 
invariance  was  achieved  and  that  loadings  were  similar 
between  genders.  In  the  next  stage  (scalar  invariance), 
there  was  no  observed  change  in  RMSEA  and  SRMR 
values,  but  the  CFI  decreased  by  0.006.  Whilst  this  was

below the 0.01 critical value and therefore indicating sca-
lar  invariance  was  achieved,  it  hints  that  the  intercepts 
between females and males are slightly different, even if 
this  margin  is  very  small.  Models  estimated  for  residual 
invariance,  including  with  factor  means  and  factor  vari-
ances, all indicated measurement invariance.

MGCFA – matched sample

Propensity score matching was then performed to create 
a  matched  sample  of  females  and  males.  Only  individu-
als  with  complete  data  on  covariates  were  included  in 
these  analyses,  resulting  in  n = 16,814  (15.17%)  females 
and  n = 8,770  (15.93%)  males  being  excluded.  From  a 
sample  of  n = 46,269  males,  matches  could  not  be  iden-
tified  for  n = 20  (0.04%),  so  they  were  excluded  from 

further  analyses.  This  resulted  in  n = 46,249  males  and 
their  matched  controls  being  included  in  the  sensitiv-
ity  analyses.  Sample  comparison  pre-  and  post-match-
ing  showed  that  whilst  there  were  statistical  differences 
between  groups  before  matching,  the  matched  groups 
were  not  statistically  different  on  any  of  these  variables 
after  matching,  and  Cramer’s  V  values  were  all  below 
0.01 (see Appendix B).

Results  of  the  MGCFA  analyses  with  the  propen-
sity  score  matched  sample,  presented  in  Appendix  C, 
indicated  that  the  patterns  of  change  between  models 
were nearly identical to those for the analysis of the full 
sample.  The  biggest  change  was  within  the  CFI  value 
when  estimating  scalar  invariance  (ΔCFI=-0.005),  but 
otherwise  change  values  were  within  tolerated  ranges,

indicating  measurement  invariance  of  the  correlated 
PHQ-9  and  GAD-7  model  between  genders.  It  was  also 
noted that the RMSEA and SRMR values were within the 
acceptable  model  fit  range,  but  the  CFI  moved  slightly 
below the critical value of 0.9 to 0.896 in M3 to M6.

Discussion
This study observed measurement invariance of the cor-
related  PHQ-9  and  GAD-7  factors  of  depression  and 
anxiety  across  males  and  females  seeking  psychological 
treatment for CMHDs. Unidimensionality of the PHQ-9 
and  the  GAD-7  was  indicated  within  the  model.  Mea-
surement invariance was demonstrated in both the analy-
sis  of  over  165,000  individuals,  as  well  as  analyses  using 
a  subset  of  males  and  females  matched  on  sociodemo-
graphic  variables  (n = 92,249).  Findings  from  this  robust 
set  of  analyses  suggest  that  these  measures  have  utility 
in through assessing the same underlying construct (i.e., 
depression and anxiety) between males and females. This 
supports the use of these measures in clinical care, as well 
as in research for assessing symptoms of depression and 
anxiety and ascertaining likely prevalence. The model fit 
was  just  within  the  acceptable  critical  values  based  on 
conventional recommendations.

Measurement  invariance  was  observed  across  groups 
and this finding supports previous research that has also 
identified  invariance  of  these  two  measures  in  both  the 
general population [4, 12] and in clinical samples [14, 15]. 
However, the fit of the current model was only just within 
acceptable  limits  according  to  standard  recommenda-
tions  for  structural  equation  modelling,  and  poorer 
than  the  model  fit  statistics  for  the  same  model  which 
explored  measurement  invariance  of  the  PHQ-9  and 
GAD-7 separately between studies [16]. Comparing CFA 
fit of the studies using the general population compared 
to  those  using  clinical  samples  suggests  that  poorer  fit 
is  often  observed  in  unidimensional  models  of  both  the 
PHQ-9  and  GAD-7  [4,  5,  14,  15,  29].  The  current  sam-
ple of patients assessed by IAPT services included those 
with a range of clinical disorders such as OCD, PTSD and 
panic  disorder,  and  it  may  be  the  model  structure  dif-
fers  between  specific  CMHDs,  which  warrants  further 
investigation.

The  MGCFA  metrics  demonstrated  that  no  change 
in  fit  statistics  exceeded  the  tolerated  ranges,  but  it  was 
noted  that  the  CFI  for  the  scalar  model  was  greater 
than  the  change  on  any  other  value.  Whilst  still  below 
threshold, indicating invariance between genders, it may 
suggest  potential  differences  in  scoring  specific  items 
between genders. Further exploration of item-by-gender 
differences may still be informative, despite measurement 
invariance being observed and other research suggesting 
a  lack  of  differential  item  functioning  by  gender  for  the 
PHQ-9 and GAD-7 [16].

Implications

This  study  has  indicated  measurement  invariance  of  the 
PHQ-9  and  GAD-7  across  males  and  females,  which 
supports  the  use  of  these  scales  to  measure  symptoms 
of  depression  and  anxiety  and  make  valid  comparisons 
between  these  genders  in  clinical  practice  and  research. 
This  is  particularly  important  given  the  routine  use  of 
these  measures  to  estimate,  for  example,  the  prevalence 
of depression and anxiety in the general population, such 
as  in  surveillance  studies  [30]  and  in  routine  treatment 
settings for CMHDs [19], but also due to the importance 
of transdiagnostic assessment to inform treatment prog-
nosis  [31–33].  In  these  scenarios,  where  differences  in 
either prevalence or levels of symptoms before and after 
treatment  are  regularly  compared  between  males  and 
females,  unbiased  measurement  is  a  necessity  [4].  As 
the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 are used as part of sessional out-
come measurement in a large number of services across 
the  world  [19]  demonstrating  measurement  invariance 
between groups is important for supporting clinical deci-
sion  making,  considering  treatment  progress,  and  to 
allow  confidence  in  any  relevant  comparisons  between 
male and female patients. However, given that the model 
fit statistics presented were on the limits of being consid-
ered  acceptable,  and  lower  than  other  studies  using  the 
same model structure [16], further research is needed to 
understand  the  latent  structure  of  these  models  in  indi-
viduals seeking treatment for CMHDs.

Limitations

There  are  several  limitations  to  the  current  analysis.  At 
the time data were collected by the services, only binary 
self-identifying gender options were available which pre-
cluded  the  use  of  other  categories  of  gender  in  the  cur-
rent analysis. It will be important to repeat these analyses 
to  explore  measurement  invariance  of  these  tools  when 
data  are  available  on  sufficient  numbers  of  participants 
who  identify  with  other  gender  categories.  The  study 
included  a  large  sample  of  participants,  but  all  were 
drawn  from  services  in  London,  England,  and  as  other 
sources of variance may be under-represented here, gen-
eralisability to other locations or settings is unknown and 
may warrant further investigation, particularly if sources 
of  measurement  variance  were  shown  to  be  socially  or 
culturally bound and to act with cumulative effects. Pro-
pensity score matching was used to control for measured 
confounding  factors  but  unmeasured  and  residual  con-
founding  cannot  be  ruled  out.  Further,  although  facto-
rial invariance has been demonstrated when PHQ-9 and 
GAD-7 measures are completed face-to-face or over the 
telephone  [34]  this  has  not  been  demonstrated  when 
additionally comparing measure scores collected via digi-
tal  means,  which  are  now  the  commonest  way  of  com-
pleting  the  PHQ-9  and  GAD-7  in  IAPT  services.  Being 

Saunders et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:298 able  to  discuss  individual  questions  with  clinicians  or 
other staff at the services might have helped clarify items 
for  some  individuals,  and  the  impact  of  this  could  be 
explored in future research.

Conclusions
This  study  observed  measurement  invariance  for  the 
PHQ-9  and  GAD-7  across  males  and  females  in  a  sam-
ple  seeking  psychological  treatment  for  CMHDs.  Find-
ings  were  replicated  for  a  propensity  score  matched 
sub-sample of 46,249 males and their matched controls. 
These  results  support  the  use  of  these  measures  in  ser-
vices  to  assess  symptoms  of  depression  and  anxiety,  to 
understand the need for treatment, and assess outcomes 
following intervention for both male and female patients, 
and  that  differences  between  males  and  females  can  be 
compared.
