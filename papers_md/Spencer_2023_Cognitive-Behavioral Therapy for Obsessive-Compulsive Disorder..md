Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions (ie, 
unwanted and intrusive thoughts, images, or impulses that lead to anxiety and distress) 
and compulsions (ie, repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to obsessions that 
serve to reduce distress or prevent feared outcomes).1 OCD has an estimated lifetime 
prevalence of approximately 1% to 3%,2–4 and most individuals are also diagnosed with 
comorbid conditions.5–7 The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)8 and its 
revised version (Y-BOCS-II)9 are considered the gold standard instruments for assessing the 
presence and severity of OCD symptoms in adults. A corresponding pediatric version of 
the YBOCS-II has also been developed (ie, CY-BOCS-II).10 Individuals with OCD often 
experience significant functional impairment in social, occupational, and familial domains, 
which leads to decreased quality of life.11–13 OCD is also associated with interpersonal 
relationship difficulties, loss of work, and increased family burden.12 The substantial 
impairment in functioning, restricted autonomy, and significant distress experienced by 
individuals with OCD necessitates the importance of developing efficacious treatments. As 
articulated below, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the front-line psychotherapeutic 
treatment of OCD supported by a substantial body of theoretic and empirical support.

THEORETIC FOUNDATIONS

Within CBT, several empirically supported conceptual and applied models of OCD exist 
that share an emphasis on the role of cognitive processes and behavioral learning principles 
in the cause, maintenance, and treatment of OCD. These include the cognitive model,14 
which lays the foundation for modern CBT approaches for OCD and provides a theoretic 
explanation for the emergence and maintenance of OCD symptoms. Additional models 
include emotional processing theory,15 and the inhibitory learning model,16 which offer

direct implications for treatment by explicating the mechanisms underlying exposure and 
response/ritual prevention (E/RP), the active ingredient of CBT treatment of OCD.

Cognitive Model

Consistent with traditional Beckian cognitive therapy,17 the cognitive model of OCD posits 
maladaptive beliefs and distorted interpretations concerning intrusive mental content (ie, 
obsessions) as critical maintenance factors.18 According to this perspective, it is not the 
inherent presence of unwanted intrusive thoughts per se that is problematic (survey research 
has indicated that intrusive, unwanted thoughts are ubiquitous in individuals with and 
without OCD).19 Rather, it is the interpretation of such threatening thoughts as excessively 
salient (ie, automatic negative thoughts about intrusions), along with the equation of such 
intrusive thoughts with the actual behavior being enacted (ie, thought–action fusion) and 
an excessive need for certainty concerning the feared content of obsessive thoughts (ie, 
intolerance of uncertainty) that are at the core of OCD from a cognitive perspective.14,20 
Additional dysfunctional biases or assumptions within the cognitive model include (a) 
failure to prevent harm to self or others is equivalent to having actually caused harm, (b) 
failure to neutralize intrusive thoughts through rituals is equivalent to desiring the worst-case 
scenario specified in the intrusive thought to actually occur, and (c) that one should be able 
to exert continuous control over one’s thoughts.20 Treatment of OCD from this perspective 
involves restructuring or modifying automatic negative thoughts (ie, interpretations) related 
to the intrusive obsessive content, along with a similar focus on modifying the core beliefs/
dysfunctional cognitive biases mentioned above.21 In cognitively specialized CBT for OCD, 
cognitive exercises are focused on challenging these underlying beliefs rather than the 
rationality of specific obsessive thoughts, which can actually be harmful for individuals 
with OCD, to the extent that these exercises lead to compulsive self-reassurance or thought-
stopping.22

Behavioral models—Behavioral learning principles have been used to conceptualize 
OCD and offer key treatment implications in terms of explaining the mechanism of 
action in E/RP—the active ingredient in CBT for OCD. From this perspective, classic 
conditioning processes explain how a neutral stimulus (intrusive thoughts) becomes paired 
with a heightened anxiety/fear response. Operant learning principles suggest that compulsive 
behaviors, which function to attenuate or neutralize anxious distress from the obsessive 
thoughts, are negatively reinforced and thus more likely to occur in the future in the presence 
of obsessions.23 Passive and active avoidance of obsessive triggers are also negatively 
reinforced via reduced frequency of OCD-related distress. Both compulsions and avoidance 
behaviors narrow adaptive behavioral repertoires and contribute to the functional impairment 
associated with OCD.24 Although these negatively reinforced behaviors result in fleeting 
relief from obsessions, this behavioral process paradoxically strengthens the salience of 
intrusive thoughts (ie, fear networks), denies an opportunity for corrective learning about 
obsessive fears, and perpetuates the OCD cycle.

Based on these behavioral accounts, Foa and Kozak developed emotional processing theory 
to explain the mechanism of change within E/RP treatment of OCD.25 The process of 
exposure to obsessive content while simultaneously refraining from engaging in compulsive

behavior/avoidance (ie, response prevention) allows for (a) extinction of the classically 
conditioned relationship between obsessive stimuli and the anxiety/distress response (ie, 
habituation), (b) attenuation of the negative reinforcement cycle (ie, functional link between 
obsessions and compulsions) via response prevention, and (c) new learning concerning 
the disconfirmation of OCD beliefs (ie, worst-case scenario did not, or does not have to, 
materialize).

Recent research on fear conditioning and extinction has revealed some novel intricacies 
within the extinction learning process underlying exposure,26 which has led to the 
development of the inhibitory learning model. This model posits that deficits in extinction 
learning processes in individuals with OCD and anxiety disorders mean that exposure 
operates via the development of 2 meaning systems—the original fear-based one, plus 
an additional inhibitory one that develops during exposure (ie, obsessional stimuli no 
longer associated with fear response). This points to the possibility that habituation may 
not necessarily be required for exposure to be effective.16 Rather than solely relying on 
extinguishing the original fear-based system, this model suggests a central mechanism of 
strengthening the inhibitory learning system involves maximizing expectancy violations, 
generalizing exposure efforts to a wide variety of situations (increase retrievability of 
inhibitory learning), and increasing distress tolerance skills and acceptance of variability 
in habituation.27

Core Treatment Elements

The following sections describe core components of the CBT treatment model for OCD, 
with deliberate focus on E/RP, which is considered a gold-standard treatment of OCD. 
Although space limitations preclude a detailed (ie, session-by-session) explication of the 
CBT for OCD protocol,23 the following sections offer an overview of core treatment 
elements. Most CBT protocols used in randomized trials include approximately 14 to 20 
twice weekly or weekly sessions.28

Information-gathering, psychoeducation, goal setting—Initial sessions involve 
integrating assessment data into an individualized case formulation of the patient’s 
presenting concerns, often conceptualized within the context of specific OCD subtypes. 
This is done through ongoing assessment of the content of obsessive thoughts, obsessive 
triggers, and manifestations of compulsive behaviors and avoidance and their functional 
link to the obsessive content. Probing for subtle compulsions (eg, mental rituals) and 
(active and passive) avoidance behaviors is also important because overlooked rituals or 
other safety behaviors can interfere with effective E/RP. This information-gathering process 
can also be facilitated by patient self-monitoring and tracking of triggers, obsessions, and 
compulsions, along with informant input (eg, parents, partner). Additionally, patients receive 
psychoeducation about OCD, the rationale for E/RP treatment, and the components/course 
of treatment. These initial discussions also allow therapists to explicate treatment goals, 
set treatment expectations, socialize the patient to the CBT approach, and instill hope for 
improvement in terms of increased flexibility in behavioral repertoires of daily living (rather 
than rigid governance by obsessive thoughts).

Exposure and response/ritual prevention—E/RP posits that by exposing patients 
to the feared content (obsessions) while instructing them to refrain from engaging in the 
compulsive behavior, new learning occurs, thus leading to a decrease in the salience (and 
frequency) of obsessive content along with decreases in the frequency of compulsions.23 
This process unfolds in practice through in vivo and imaginal exposure exercises that are 
conducted in session and assigned as out-of-session homework. In vivo exposures involve 
patients exposing themselves to the actual triggering stimuli (eg, touching a toilet seat 
for contamination-related OCD, holding a knife for harm-related OCD), whereas imaginal 
exposures consist of patients vividly imagining themselves in triggering situations—often 
through utilization of a written or recorded script that is read or listened to repeatedly—
while refraining from engaging in rituals or compulsive behaviors. Imaginal exposures are 
often used in situations where in vivo exposures are either logically or ethically impossible, 
such as handling needles due to concern of contracting HIV/AIDS, or fear of harm coming 
to oneself while playing baseball. Importantly, both modalities seem effective in addressing 
OCD specific symptoms.29

In practice, E/RP work begins by providing a clear rationale for the importance of frequent 
and repeated practice of exposure exercises to affect symptom reduction. Highlighting the 
collaborative nature of E/RP, patients are informed that they will never be forced to engage 
in exposure exercises without their consent, but will be encouraged to vigorously pursue 
exposures, because greater magnitude of immersion within E/RP leads to better treatment 
outcomes.24 Subsequently, therapist and patient work to develop an exposure hierarchy, 
which accounts for all of the patient’s OCD-related triggers and feared situations. Trigger 
situations are then arranged from least to most distressing, and exposure exercises are often 
structured in a way that works to sequentially proceed with exposures of greater difficulty 
until all items on the hierarchy are mastered.23 Contemporary models of exposure encourage 
flexible progression along this exposure list based on the patient’s willingness rather than 
rigid adherence to the originally outlined hierarchy (ie, beginning with least distressing, then 
trying the second-least distressing) because increased variability in distress during exposure 
can enhance learning generalization.27

In practice, exposure exercises typically involve the patient fully exposing to a trigger 
situation and tracking subjective units of discomfort (SUDs; eg, rated 0–100, with 0 being 
perfectly relaxed and 100 being the most intolerable distress ever) before, during, and after 
the exposure exercise. Careful tracking of SUDs ratings during exposure exercises allows 
patients to experientially contact the process of habituation during exposure, and highlights 
possible violations of expectancy (ie, by comparing preexposure estimated peak SUDs 
to actual SUDs). Consistent with the cognitive model of OCD, postexposure processing 
(and review of homework) often consists of emphasizing new learning from exposure and 
targeting beliefs about uncertainty and inflated sense of responsibility.

Maintenance, termination, and sustaining remission—As therapy progresses and 
patients become more adept at independently designing and implementing exposures in the 
context of their daily life, focus shifts toward maintaining gains made during treatment and 
planning for eventual termination. Implementation of less frequent maintenance and booster

sessions, along with the development of a detailed relapse prevention plan, are additional 
components that can facilitate successful termination.

Throughout this process, overarching themes and insights gleaned from treatment are 
highlighted and integrated into the patient’s life context, especially because they relate to 
the patient autonomously integrating E/RP principles into their day-to-day life. In essence, 
patients learn to live a life of exposure and move toward what matters to them without being 
held back by OCD. As such, this final phase of treatment focuses on fostering patient 
rehabilitation and promoting expansion of adaptive behavioral repertoires to numerous 
life domains once constricted by OCD. This can include pursuing hobbies, recreation, 
employment, and relationships with a newfound sense of flexibility and autonomy.

Research Support

CBT (ie, E/RP) has established a very strong evidence base in the treatment of children, 
adolescents, and adults with OCD, delivered both in-person and via telehealth.30 This is 
reflected in its superiority to psychological and pill placebo controls as well as serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in numerous randomized controlled trials,31–33 large effect sizes 
of treatment identified by multiple meta-analyses,34–36 and consistent recommendations as 
an evidence-based treatment in practice guidelines and reviews.37–39

Specifically, recent meta-analyses have demonstrated large effect sizes of E/RP for OCD 
relative to waitlist and placebo controls, as well as significant superiority to antidepressant 
medication in both youth and adults.34–36 Estimates of effect sizes from these meta-analyses 
relative to active control conditions (eg, relaxation-based therapy) range from d = .21 to 
1.13, and nonactive controls (eg, waitlist, placebo) from d = 1.27 to 1.53. E/RP has also 
demonstrated modest but significant superiority to SRIs, with meta-analytic effect size 
ranging from .22 to .36.34–36 Treatment response rates are estimated to be 65% to 70% 
after a course of E/RP, remission rates as high as 57%,34–36 and dropout rates are also 
consistently low compared with other treatments.37,40

In terms of practice guidelines, the American Psychological Association Society of Clinical 
Psychology provided a “strong recommendation” (ie, second-highest ranking level) for 
E/RP in 2015 based on universally strong superiority to control conditions identified in 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses.41 Since then, several additional RCTs have been 
published,42 which likely will lead to future revision of the strength of support to “very 
strong recommendation.” Similarly, family-based E/RP for youth with OCD has earned 
a designation as a “well-established” treatment by the Society for Clinical Child and 
Adolescent Psychology,38 reflecting the highest standard of evidence for psychological 
therapy. This recommendation was based on multiple randomized controlled trials 
demonstrating the superiority of these therapies relative to active comparison conditions.43 
The American Psychiatric Association and American Academy of Child and Adolescent 
Psychiatry provide similar recommendations, with E/RP (or SRIs) being described as a 
first-line treatment of adults,44 and as the first-line treatment alone for youth with mild-to-
moderate OCD, or in combination with an SRI in the case of moderate-to-severe OCD.39

Limitations of this research should be noted, however, because most of the evidence base 
that supports E/RP has been conducted with White, middle-class individuals in specialty 
research settings. Although efforts have been made to increase the diversity of OCD study 
participants, more research is needed in real-world settings with more culturally diverse 
populations because there is only preliminary support in these settings.41,45

Case Vignettes

Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder case example—Noah was a 10-year-old 
boy who presented for treatment with his mother (Jill) because of struggles with frequent, 
intrusive, and distressing thoughts about harming his parents, along with compulsive 
reassurance-seeking and active avoidance of certain objects and places (eg, the kitchen when 
knives are out, keeping his hands in his pockets whenever he is in the same room as a sharp 
object).a He also endorsed intrusive thoughts about his parents being harmed when separated 
from them and engagement in reassurance-seeking behaviors (eg, repeated text-messages). 
Noah and Jill also reported a nightly ritual in which they say “I love you” four times in a row 
before bed. Additionally, Noah indicated struggling with things being “just-right,” including 
tying both shoes a similar tightness, wearing socks the same length, and brushing his teeth 
evenly on both sides. He reported time-consuming, repetitive performance of such behaviors 
until it feels symmetric. Because of this, he has been late to school almost every day this 
year. His score on the CY-BOCS-II was 28 (moderate-to-severe range).

A family-based E/RP treatment plan included an initial assessment of obsessions and 
compulsions, OCD-related functional impairment, and family accommodation. During the 
initial session, Noah and Jill were provided with psychoeducation about OCD, in which 
intrusive thoughts and rituals were normalized, and the development and maintenance of 
OCD was explained as a process in which people pay excessive attention to intrusive 
thoughts and spend excessive time responding to them. This initial session also involved 
identifying the different domains of Noah’s life affected by OCD. Additionally, the rationale 
for E/RP was provided using developmentally appropriate language, describing the goal of 
E/RP to help with new learning about obsessive fears and increase the amount of time Noah 
spends in other fun activities and hobbies, rather than stuck within OCD cycles. Finally, 
Noah and Jill were encouraged to think of a funny name for Noah’s OCD to “externalize” 
OCD. This exercise helped Noah and his mother psychologically distance from OCD, which 
had become entangled with their daily lives and relationship and gave them a common focus 
to address during therapy.

In subsequent sessions, Noah and Jill developed a treatment hierarchy with their therapist, 
which included a list of potential E/RP exercises that Noah rated using a SUDS rating scale 
of 0 to 10. This collaborative process facilitated building a flexible roadmap for treatment 
that was revisited in subsequent sessions. Noah’s therapist proposed E/RP exercises he 
hoped Noah would find fun or enjoyable to facilitate engagement, like having a 3-legged 
race with his mom with uneven socks to challenge just-not-right experiences or eating his 
favorite candy after first “stabbing it” with a knife. See Table 1 for Noah’s hierarchy.

aThe following cases are based on an integration of several individuals with OCD who have been treated in our clinical work and are 
intended to illustrate E/RP as it is done in practice. They are not meant to reflect any one individual person.

Most of subsequent sessions involved the following format: first, his therapist checked 
in on “wins” from the previous week, or E/RP homework in which he approached 
feared situations and/or resisted compulsions. Next, they completed in-session E/RP, which 
sometimes involved out-of-office exercises (eg, to the bathroom to challenge his teeth-
brushing ritual). Jill would join sessions to facilitate generalization of E/RP to Noah’s 
family context. During E/RP, the therapist routinely encouraged Noah to maintain focus 
on the feared situation. They also carefully monitored overt and subtle compulsions during 
exposure to minimize them as much as possible. Over time, the therapist encouraged Jill to 
take the lead in E/RP coaching to prepare them for at-home exercises, and to identify ways 
she accommodates at home (eg, engaging in bedtime rituals, responding to text-messages 
about her safety), and resisting these urges.

Throughout the course of treatment, obsessional distress gradually reduced, and time spent 
engaging in compulsive rituals dramatically decreased, which resulted in increased adaptive 
behavioral functioning in key life domains (family, school, relationships), reduced OCD-
related impairment, and more time engaging in hobbies/fun activities. To quantitatively 
assess progress, the therapist readministered the CY-BOCS-II, which fell in the nonclinical 
range (total score of 8). After spacing the last 2 sessions out during 2 to 3 weeks, therapy 
concluded with a “relapse prevention” session in which Noah and Jill were encouraged 
to reflect on what had been most beneficial and how to prepare for the future if OCD 
symptoms reemerge.

Adult obsessive-compulsive disorder case example—Steven was a 26-year-
old man who presented with long-standing OCD symptoms specific to contamination 
involving bodily fluids, and compulsions surrounding avoidance of objects perceived to be 
contaminated, use of barriers, and excessive and ritualistic handwashing/bathing. His intake 
assessment yielded a diagnosis of OCD along with a YBOCS-II score of 24 (moderate–
severe range).

During the first E/RP session, psychoeducation concerning OCD and CBT (ie, E/RP) was 
provided. Steven was encouraged to apply this content to his personal experience with OCD 
and was able to identify how obsessive thoughts related to contamination caused anxiety, 
and in turn facilitated avoidance and compulsive behaviors. Additionally, he identified 
successful (albeit inadvertent) instances of habituation to anxiety, including an occasion 
where he was unable to bathe immediately following exercise, and recognized how this 
could be applied to E/RP treatment. An exposure hierarchy was developed, and initial 
exercises were added and assigned in the first session; Steven agreed to continue developing 
his hierarchy and track symptoms on an ongoing basis throughout treatment.

Steven’s second session was used to finish developing his hierarchy; initial exposure 
exercises were practiced in-session with Steven agreeing to handle doorknobs in the clinic 
without washing. After the exercise, Steven and the therapist discussed what occurred 
and how his anxiety eventually habituated in the absence of handwashing rituals. Steven 
also noted there was no evidence supporting predictions that he would become sick from 
touching the doorknob. His therapist pointed out that neither of them could be 100% certain, 
however, that he would not get sick from the doorknob, an observation intended to help

Steven challenge a need for certainty over his feared outcomes. For homework, Steven 
agreed to practice this exercise 3 times daily before the next session.

The third session started with a review of exposure homework. Much like the exposure 
practice during his previous visit, Steven’s exposure tracking documents provided evidence 
of habituation during exposures. Additionally, habituation occurred more quickly during 
successive trials, and peak SUDs ratings reduced across trials. Steven further explained 
that while intrusive thoughts specific to contamination were still present while handling 
doorknobs, the urge to wash was less pronounced and he felt confident in resisting washing. 
Cognitive therapy techniques were also used to maximize inhibitory learning from exposures 
in terms of highlighting the discrepancy between the expectancy of feared outcome before 
ERP and the actual outcome.46 The third visit concluded with Steven selecting exposures 
from his hierarchy to practice in-session (handling doorknob without washing and cross-
contaminating his face). Steven agreed to practice and record this exercise 3 times daily 
before next session.

Sessions 4 through 12 proceeded in a similar manner, with the agenda including a review 
of homework assigned, identification of in-session exposures, and planning subsequent 
exposure homework. After the 12th session, Steven’s score on the YBOCS-II was 13 (mild 
range). Additionally, Steven completed all exposure exercises on his hierarchy. From there, 
Steven and the therapist met for 4 additional sessions every 2 weeks to allow additional 
time for independent exposure practice. During these booster sessions, Steven took a more 
active role in integrating E/RP principles into his day-to-day lived experiences. The final 
maintenance visit included development of a symptom relapse prevention plan. A follow-up 
YBOCS-II measure yielded a score of 12 (mild range). Steven and the therapist agreed to 
discontinue treatment due to symptom reduction and his ongoing ability to independently 
maintain treatment progress.

DISCUSSION

Prognosis and outcomes for children and adults suffering from OCD have improved 
greatly during the last 40 years due to advances in CBT (ie, E/RP) and SRI treatments,24 
which both possess a strong evidence base supporting their efficacy. These treatments 
are often combined in practice (especially for more severe presentations) and have 
demonstrated robust efficacy based on a large body of research and associated practice 
guidelines.38,39,41,43,44 E/RP consistently demonstrates sustained benefits following active 
treatment, greater remission rates relative to SRIs, and has shown to be effective for 
individuals who may not respond to (or prefer) SRIs.42,47 As such, CBT, with an emphasis 
on E/RP, should be a core component of treatment of those with OCD.38,41 As demonstrated 
in the series of case vignettes presented here, cognitive and behavioral models of OCD—
with an emphasis on E/RP—are broad in scope yet offer potential for individualized care. 
This section discusses several key issues germane to clinicians delivering CBT for OCD and 
offers recommendations for overcoming some of the challenges and pitfalls that may arise in 
practice.

As described earlier, E/RP is the active ingredient of successful CBT treatment of OCD.27,48 
Despite the repeated demonstrations of E/RP’s efficacy, survey studies indicate that 
individuals treated for OCD do not always receive E/RP.49 Reasons for therapist hesitancy 
in delivering E/RP with fidelity include negative beliefs about the safety of the approach, 
patient’s ability to tolerate exposures, and faulty perceptions of E/RP as nonessential in the 
treatment of OCD.50 These beliefs are oftentimes unfounded, however (eg, survey research 
reveals that serious negative consequences of E/RP are extremely rare).51 Fortunately, such 
clinician beliefs have been shown to be amenable to modification, which further underscores 
the importance of increasing promotion of E/RP through clear articulation of the rationale 
for, and safety of, E/RP to patients and other professionals.

Additionally, when E/RP is deliberately targeted in treatment, there are several pitfalls 
that can—and indeed often do—result in reduced efficacy of treatment and an unfortunate 
prolonging of OCD symptoms. These include (a) only engaging in mild-to-moderate 
difficulty exposures and leaving more challenging ones untouched, (b) failing to notice 
subtle patient safety behaviors or inadvertently providing reassurance during exposures, (c) 
designing exposure exercises that are less relevant to the patient’s lived experience or failing 
to promote generalization of in vivo exposures to the patient’s life context, and (d) focusing 
on challenging the rationality of obsessive thoughts as is done in traditional cognitively 
focused CBT.50,52 Fortunately, awareness of these common pitfalls can assist therapists 
in conducting E/RP with fidelity and designing exposures with the greatest likelihood of 
having a positive impact in the patient’s day-to-day life.

Addressing Clinical Complexities

Comorbid psychiatric conditions in individuals with OCD presenting for treatment often 
seems to be the rule, rather than the exception. Commonly encountered comorbid conditions 
include generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive 
personality disorder, chronic tic disorders (especially in youth), and attention deficit-
hyperactivity disorder, to name a few.4–7 Because such comorbidities can present additional 
complexities and challenges, thorough assessment, case conceptualization, and treatment 
planning are essential for optimal care. Additional considerations involve whether to treat 
comorbid conditions simultaneously or sequentially in the context of OCD and evaluating 
the impact of comorbidities on successful implementation of E/RP. To the extent that 
comorbid conditions dramatically interfere with E/RP progress, addressing the comorbid 
concern before beginning a course of CBT for OCD may be indicated.23 However, 
in many cases, E/RP can be tailored to address comorbid conditions without affecting 
response.53 Further, data suggest that many comorbid conditions (eg, depression, anxiety) 
improve following successful E/RP.54,55 Distinguishing closely related clinical concerns 
(eg, ruminative anxiety, patterns of repetitive behaviors in trichotillomania and excoriation 
disorders) from independent OCD symptomology is another important consideration. 
Additional areas of clinical complexity include presentations of OCD with low levels 
of insight, comorbid disorganized or tangential thought processes (including psychotic 
spectrum disorders), substance abuse, and treatment planning for more severe cases in which 
a higher level of care (eg, residential, partial hospitalization) may be warranted.

Recommendations for Clinicians

CBT—specifically E/RP—represents a well-established, cost-effective, evidence-based 
approach for treating OCD with potential for alleviating symptomology and improving 
quality of life. Based on the cognitive and behavioral models of OCD presented above, the 
following recommendations for clinicians treating patients with OCD are proffered:

•

•

•

Implement a deliberate focus on thorough assessment, case formulation, and 
treatment planning idiographically tailored to fit the needs of diverse patients.

Use an E/RP framework to design and carry out relevant exposure exercises 
tailored to patients’ unique lived experiences that lead to resounding 
improvement in patient adaptive behavioral functioning.

Consider possible complex clinical presentations (ie, comorbidities, severe 
symptomology) when personalizing CBT for OCD.

KEY POINTS

•

•

•

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an empirically supported 
psychotherapeutic treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Exposure and response/ritual prevention (E/RP) is the active component 
underlying the efficacy of CBT for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Practice guidelines for clinicians using CBT for OCD include thorough 
assessment and case conceptualization, effective implementation of E/RP with 
fidelity to the underlying model, and flexible, idiosyncratic adaptation of 
treatment of diverse patients.
