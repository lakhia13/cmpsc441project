ABSTRACT
By now it is well known that trauma-related psychiatric disorders are associated with a broad 
range  of  biological  dysregulations.  This  special  issue  focused  on  research  aiming  to  advance 
our understanding  of the  biological  mechanisms  underlying  adverse  mental  health  outcome 
after  trauma,  in  particular  the  development  of  trauma-related  disorders  and  differences  in 
individual  susceptibility  (i.e.  risk  or  resilience)  to  their  development.  We  included  51  papers 
published  in  EJPT  between  2021  and  2023,  either  directly  submitted  to  the  special  issue  or 
whose  focus  clearly  fitted  the  aim  of  the  special  issue.  Included  papers  consisted  of  43 
original  research  papers  and  8  review  articles,  addressing  a  wide  range  of  biological 
processes, ranging  from brain and  central nervous  system functioning, to cardiovascular and 
autonomic  nervous 
(epi)genetics;  metabolism; 
inflammation;  sleep  and  pain.  Collectively,  the  included  articles  showcase  that  significant 
steps  are  taken  in  advancing  our  understanding  of  the  biological  mechanisms  underlying 
development  of  and  susceptibility  to  trauma-related  disorders,  as  well  their  recovery. 
Recommendations  for  future  research  are  provided  with  regard  to  study  design;  assessment 
of  trauma  exposure  characteristics;  sex  and/or  gender  (minority)-related  factors;  geographic, 
developmental/lifespan  and  transgenerational  aspects;  and  the  temporal  dynamics  of 
biological  processes  in  relation  to  the  stage  of  the  disorder  under  investigation.  Together, 
these  articles  will  hopefully  further  facilitate  the  development  of  more  effective  preventive, 
early  and  curative  intervention  strategies,  as  well  as  more  effective  timely  and  personalised 
allocation towards these interventions.

Mecanismos biológicos subyacentes a las consecuencias adversas para la 
salud mental tras un trauma  

Hasta el momento es bien sabido que los trastornos psiquiátricos relacionados con trauma se 
asocian a una amplia gama de desregulaciones biológicas. Este número especial se centró en 
investigación destinada a profundizar nuestra comprensión de los mecanismos biológicos que 
subyacen  a  las  consecuencias  adversas  para  la  salud  mental  tras  un  trauma,  en  particular  el 
desarrollo  de  los  trastornos  relacionados  con  trauma  y  las  diferencias  en  la  susceptibilidad 
individual  (es  decir,  riesgo  o  resiliencia)  d  su  desarrollo.  Se 
incluyeron  51  artículos 
publicados  en  la  EJPT  entre  2021-2023,  ya  sea  enviados  directamente  al  número  especial  o 
cuyo  foco  se  ajustaba  claramente  al  objetivo  del  mismo.  Estos  incluyeron  43  artículos  de 
investigación originales y 8 artículos  de revisión, que  abordan una amplia  gama de  procesos 
biológicos,  variando  desde  el  funcionamiento  cerebral  y  sistema  nervioso  central,  al 
funcionamiento  cardiovascular  y  sistema  nervioso  autónomo;  endocrinología;  (epi)genética;

1.  Introduction

Trauma-related  disorders  including  posttraumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) are associated with dysregula-
tions  in  a  wide  range  of  biological  processes.  These 
processes  include  but  are  not  confined  to  the  central 
nervous system, autonomic nervous system; endocrine 
system;  immune  system  and  metabolic  system.  An 
extensive  review  of  these  systems  and  their  associ-
ations  with  trauma-related  is  beyond  the  scope  of 
this  editorial,  but  interested  readers  are  referred  to 
the  following  recent  overview  paper  (Shalev  et  al., 
2024).  Initial  biological  studies  in  our  field  mainly 
focused  on 
the  associations  between  biological 
measures  and  the  presence  or  maintenance  of 
trauma-related  disorders.  However,  more  recent 
studies provide accumulating evidence that biological 
dysregulations should not merely be considered as an 
acquired consequence of exposure to traumatic events 
or  trauma-related  disorders.  In  contrast,  several  bio-
logical processes seem to be associated with emotional 
and cognitive trauma processing and symptom onset, 
and are increasingly thought to contribute to individ-
ual differential susceptibility (i.e. risk or resilience) to 
the development of trauma-related disorders.

PTSD  and  other-trauma  related  disorders  are 
highly prevalent and once their symptoms have estab-
lished the odds for a chronic adverse course are con-
siderable,  even  when  evidence-based  treatment  is 
provided  (Kessler  et  al.,  2017;  Semmlinger  et  al., 
2024). Thus, further elucidation of the biological pro-
cesses associated with the development of and suscep-
tibility  to  trauma-related  disorders  is  important  to 
provide  further avenues for much  warranted preven-
tive  and  early  interventions  to  ameliorate  long-term 
adverse mental health consequences of trauma. There-
fore,  this  special  issue  focused  on  research  aiming  to 
advance  our  understanding  of  these  biological  pro-
cesses. We specifically called for studies with adequate 
designs  and  setups  to  investigate  biological  processes 
in  relation  to  relevant  clinical,  cognitive  or  behav-
ioural  aspects  of  trauma  exposure  and  development 
of  and  susceptibility  to  trauma-related  disorders, 
including prospective and longitudinal cohort studies, 
but  also  experimental,  preclinical  and  computational 
studies.  We  specifically  invited  studies  addressing: 
acute  and  long-term  biological  effects  of  traumatic 
stress; biological factors associated with risk and resi-
lience  to  trauma-related  disorders;  biological  pro-
cesses  of  symptom  onset  and  development  after 
trauma;  biological  information  to  forecast  mental 
health outcome after trauma; mediators and modera-
tors  of  biological  mechanisms  of  trauma-related  dis-
orders;  intervention  studies  targeting  or  assessing 
biological  processes  associated  with  development  of 
trauma-related disorders; impact of sex as a biological 
variable  (SABV)  on  mental  health  outcome  after 

trauma;  other  biological  papers  relevant  to  the  field 
of psychotraumatology

2. In this  issue

In this special issue we collected 51 papers accepted for 
publication in EJPT between 2021 and 2023.

The  papers  eventually  selected  for  the  special  issue 
were  either  submitted  specifically  in  response  to  the 
abovementioned  call  for  papers  until  the  end  of  2022, 
or  selected  from  articles  accepted  for  publication  in 
2023  based  on  their  clear  biological  focus.  Forty-three 
of  the  included  articles  consisted  of  original  research 
papers,  with  approximately  60%  (n = 26)  describing 
results  of  studies  with  cross-sectional  study  designs. 
The  other  original  research  papers  presented  results 
from  studies  with  a  prospective  (n = 5);  longitudinal 
(n = 4),  experimental  (i.e.  analogue  trauma)  (n = 4)  or 
clinical  trial  (n = 4)  design.  Within  these  original 
research  articles, 
the  overlarge  majority  (n = 32, 
74.4%)  focused  on  biological  correlates  of  trauma- 
related psychiatric disorders or characteristic symptoms 
thereof,  predominantly  posttraumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD).  The  remaining  11  original  research  papers 
concerned  investigations  of  the  associations  between 
trauma exposure and biological processes, without con-
sidering its potential  clinical consequences or in  some 
instances  excluding  individuals  with  trauma-related 
disorders. Additionally, the special issue collection con-
tains two narrative reviews, two systematic reviews with 
meta-analytic  components,  and 
systematic 
reviews. Aligning with the trend observed in  the orig-
inal  research  papers,  six  of  these  focused  specifically 
on PTSD or its symptoms, whilst the other two focused 
on the consequences of trauma exposure without a par-
ticular focus on its clinical consequences. All details of 
the papers are provided in the enclosed tables.

2.1.  Biological  processes  investigated

investigated  within  the 
The  biological  processes 
articles  included  in  this  special  issue  can  be  broadly 
clustered as follows: brain/central nervous system; car-
diovascular/autonomic  nervous  system;  endocrin-
ology;  (epi)genetics;  and  a  miscellaneous  group 
including  sleep,  pain,  metabolism  and  inflammation. 
Below the articles are clustered based on their primary 
biological  focus,  but  please  note  that  several  articles 
focused on more than one of these processes.

2.1.1.  Brain  /  central  nervous  system
Brain and/or CNS-related research was the most preva-
lent  primary  focus  of  the  articles  accepted  into  the 
special  issue,  with  21  articles  with  this  particular 
focus.  Of  these,  16  presented  results  from  original 
research:  One  prospective  study  (Powers  et  al.,  2022), 
one  (Lan  et  al.)  longitudinal  study  (Lan  et  al.,  2023), 

and  14  studies  with  a  cross-sectional  design  (Glazeb-
rook  et  al.,  2023;  He  et  al.,  2023;  Hilberdink  et  al., 
2021; Jin et al., 2023; Liddell et al., 2023; Rosada et al., 
2021;  Schellhaas  et  al.,  2022;  Sokołowski  et  al.,  2022; 
Tamman et al., 2023; van Sleeuwen et al., 2023; Vicario 
et al., 2022; Wermuth et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2023; Zhao 
et al., 2021) Of the remaining 5 articles not presenting 
original  research,  four  consisted  of  systematic  reviews 
(one  including  a  meta-analytic  investigation;  (Askovic 
et  al.,  2023);  purely  systematic  (Manthey  et  al.,  2021; 
Nicholson  et  al.,  2022;  Susanty  et  al.,  2022)  and  one 
consisted of a narrative review  (Fine et al., 2023). The 
exact  biological  processes  under  investigation  as  well 
as  the  applied  assessment  methods  for  each  of  the  21 
articles are depicted in Table 1.

2.1.2.  Cardiovascular  /  autonomic  nervous 
system
Ten  of  the  articles  within the  special  issue had  a  pri-
mary focus on cardiovascular and/or autonomic ner-
vous  system-related  research.  Of  these,  nine  articles 
presented  results  from  original  research:  5  were 
cross-sectional  studies  (Bussone  et  al.,  2023;  Grasser 
et  al.,  2022;  Krause-Utz  et  al.,  2022;  Noble  et  al., 
2023;  Schmitz  et  al.,  2021),  2  were  experimental 
studies  (Beutler  &  Croy,  2023;  Danböck  et  al.,  2021) 
and  2  described  results  from  clinical  trials  (Magnin 
et  al.,  2023;  Roullet  et  al.,  2022).  The  final  article 
consisted of a systematic review (Beutler et al. 2022). 
The  exact  biological  processes  under  investigation  as 
well  as  the  applied  assessment  methods  for  each  of 
these 10 articles are depicted in Table 2.

2.1.3.  Endocrinology
Eight of the articles within the special issue described 
original research results with a primary focus on endo-
crinology. These articles consisted of one prospective 
study  (Yrondi  et  al.,  2022),  3  cross-sectional  studies 
(Krinke  et  al.,  2022;  Lee  et  al.,  2022;  Maslahati  et  al., 
2023;  Salvat-Pujol  et  al.,  2021;  Wadji  et  al.,  2021),  2 
experimental  studies  (Krinke  et  al.,  2022;  Maslahati 
et  al.,  2023),  and  1  clinical  trial  (Engel  et  al.,  2021). 
The  final article  consisted  of  a  systematic  review  and 
meta-analysis (Engel et al., 2023). The exact biological 
processes  under  investigation  as  well  as  the  applied 
assessment  methods  for  each  of  these  eight  articles 
are depicted in Table 3.

2.1.4.  (Epi)genetics
Six  articles  within  the  special  issue  primarily  focused 
on  epigenetic  or genetic  investigations. These studies 
all  presented  results  from  original  research,  with  2 
articles  described  results  from  cross-sectional  studies 
(Cusack  et  al.,  2023;  Mattonet  et  al.,  2023);  2  articles 
describing results from longitudinal studies (dos San-
tos  Oliveira  et  al.,  2023;  Elam  et  al.,  2022)  and  2 
describing  results  from  prospective  studies  (Gultig

et  al.,  2023;  Vuong  et  al.,  2022).  The  exact  biological 
processes  under  investigation  as  well  as  the  applied 
assessment  methods  for  each  of  these  six  articles  are 
depicted in Table 4.

2.1.5.  Miscellaneous
The remaining 6 articles contain a mixture of primary 
foci. Two original research articles focus on sleep, one 
with a cross-sectional (Ansbjerg et al., 2023) and one 
with  a  longitudinal  design  (Schenker  et  al.,  2023). 
Three  papers  describe  original  research  related  to 
inflammatory  and/or  metabolic  processes,  including 
one cross-sectional study (Kurkinen et al., 2023), one 
prospective study (Baranyi et al., 2021) and one clini-
cal trial (Maffioletti et al., 2021). The final article pre-
sents a narrative review encompassing a multitude of 
biological  processes  in  relation  to  childhood  trauma 
and physical pain (Campbell, 2022). The exact biologi-
cal processes under investigation as well as the applied 
assessment  methods  for  each  of  these  six  articles  are 
depicted in Table 5.

3. Highlights  and limitations

the 

Collectively,  the  included  articles  in  our  special  issue 
investigated  a  wide  range  of  biological  processes  in 
relation to trauma and trauma-related disorders, ran-
ging from brain and central nervous system function-
ing; to cardiovascular and autonomic nervous system 
functioning;  to  endocrinology;  (epi)genetics;  metab-
olism;  inflammation;  sleep  and  pain.  The  most  com-
mon  research  design  of 
included  articles 
consisted of cross-sectional comparisons of biological 
measures  between  participants  with  or  without 
trauma-related  psychiatric  disorders  (mostly  PTSD), 
or  with  or  without  previous  trauma  exposure.  Many 
incorporated  other 
of  these  articles  additionally 
trauma-relevant  psychological,  cognitive  and  behav-
ioural  processes  previously  associated  with  mental 
health  outcome  following  trauma,  with  the  aim  to 
shed  light  on  potential  mediators  and  moderators  of 
the  associations  between  the  investigated  biological 
processes  and  trauma  exposure  and  its  related  dis-
orders.  Beyond  the  more  traditional  cross-sectional 
studies,  we  also  included  multiple  articles  with  pro-
spective,  longitudinal,  experimental  designs  as  well 
as  clinical  treatment  RCTs.  These  latter  designs  are 
better  suited  to  investigate  the  temporal  courses  of 
the  associations  of  the  investigated  biological  pro-
cesses  with  trauma  exposure,  and  with  the  develop-
ment,  maintenance  as  well  as  the  recovery  of 
trauma-related  disorders.  Therefore,  we  recommend 
future  studies  aiming  to  obtain  more  mechanistic 
insights to prioritise such designs over cross-sectional 
designs.

We were happy to see that the participant samples 
investigated in the included articles were quite diverse

M. VAN ZUIDEN AND M. OLFF

in terms of demographic and exposure characteristics. 
In terms of recruitment location, many of the investi-
gated  samples  extended  well  beyond  the  so  called 
WEIRD  (Western,  Educated,  Industrial,  Rich,  and 
Democratic)  populations,  facilitating  generalizability 
of  findings  to  the  global  population.  Furthermore, 
whilst  most  investigated  samples  in  this  issue  con-
sisted  of  adults,  several  studies  focused  specifically 
on childhood, adolescence or young or late adulthood 
(for  a  systematic  review  on  biopsychosocial  factors 
that  may  influence  the  onset  and  persistence  of 
PTSD in children and adolescence also see (Williams 
et  al.,  2024).  Furthermore,  3  studies  assessed  child- 
adult family dyads and even triads (Elam et al., 2022; 
Mattonet  et  al.,  2023;  Wadji  et  al.,  2021).  As  such, 
these  studies will  contribute to  elucidating  the devel-
opmental  and  even  transgenerational  aspects  of 
trauma  and  how  these  may  impact  potential  adverse 
mental health outcomes. Future studies would ideally 
include  even  more  varied  and  understudied  popu-
lations  in  terms  of  location  as  well  as  developmental 
and aging perspectives.

Participants  across  articles  had  been  exposed  to  a 
wide  variety  of  (potential)  traumatic  events.  This  is 
relevant  as  trauma  characteristics,  including  the  type 
of  trauma  exposure,  are  known  to  impact  the  risk 
for  subsequent  development  of  trauma-related  dis-
orders  including  PTSD,  as  well  as  their  course  and 
phenotypical  symptom  expression  (Brewin  et  al., 
2025).  However,  in  particular  for  the  cross-sectional 
and  clinical  intervention  studies,  trauma  type  and 
the  broader  trauma  history  were  often  not  specified 
or  taken  into  account  otherwise.  Not  all  included 
articles  in  this  special  issue  strictly  specified  trauma 
according  to  the  DSM-5  definition,  instead  investi-
gating  populations  with  more  chronic  and  perhaps 
more  insidious  stress  exposure  (e.g.  Elam  et  al., 
2022;  Gultig  et  al.,  2023).  As  there  is  ongoing  debate 
about the optimal conceptualisation and demarcation 
of  what  experiences  should  be  considered  traumatic 
(Marx  et  al.,  2024),  such  studies  will  contribute  to 
explorations  of  potential  similarities  and  differences 
in  the  biological  correlates  between  these  types  of 
exposures.  Therefore,  to  advance  our  understanding 
of  if  and  how  these  characteristics  interact  with  the 
biological  processes  associated  with  trauma  exposure 
trauma-related  adverse biological outcomes, it  is rec-
ommended  that  future  biological  studies  incorporate 
trauma exposure characteristics into their descriptive 
and analytic approach.

Accumulating  findings  support  that  many  of  bio-
logical  processes  investigated  in  the  included  articles 
are  temporally  dynamic:  their  functioning  as  well  as 
their  associations  with 
trauma-related  disorders 
depend on the time since trauma exposure onset and 
exact  stage  of  the  disorder  at  the  time  of  assessment. 
the  more  recent 
These  observations  fit  with 

perspective 
including 
that  psychiatric  disorders 
PTSD  and  other-trauma  related  disorders  should  be 
approached  from  a  staging  perspective,  if  we  are  to 
better  understand  their  etiology  and  prognosis  and 
improve  treatment  outcomes  (Burback  et  al.,  2024). 
The  timing  of  assessments  relative  to  exposure  and 
symptom  onset  is  commonly  well  reported  for  pro-
spective  studies,  including  those  within  the  special 
issue. Additionally, the included experimental studies 
inducing  so-called  analogue  traumatic  stress  had 
detailed  reporting  on  the  exact  timing  of  their  peri- 
and  acute  post-‘traumatic’  assessments  (Beutler  & 
Croy, 2023; Danböck et al., 2021; Krinke et al., 2022; 
Maslahati et al., 2023). However, most of the included 
cross-sectional,  longitudinal  and  clinical  intervention 
studies  did  either  not  provide  this  information,  or 
merely  stated  or  implied  a  ‘long’  duration  since 
trauma or disorder onset without any further specifi-
cation  (e.g.  in  the  case  of  childhood  trauma  investi-
gations  in  adults).  Thus,  for  any  biological  measure, 
it  is  recommended  to  specify  when  it  was  measured 
in  relation  to  the  trauma  exposure  and  the  stage  of 
the disorder of interest.

Over  the  past  decade  it  has  become  increasingly 
clear  that  the  biological  mechanisms  underlying 
trauma-related  disorders  are  influenced  by  sex  and 
sex-related factors, as well as gender (minority)-related 
factors  (Langeland  &  Olff,  2024).  Although  the  EJPT 
was  the  first  journal  to  adopt  a  gender  policy  (Olff, 
2016)  most  of  the  included  articles  did  not  explicitly 
address  the  potential  impact  of  these  factors  in  their 
analytic  approach.  Most  articles  combined  women 
and men into one sample without investigating poten-
tially  differential  biological  effects  of  sex  and/or  gen-
der. Others investigated only women or men but did 
not take sex and/or gender (minority)-related factors 
into  account.  Less  than  a  handful  of  papers  in  this 
special  issue  purposefully  investigated  sex  and  gen-
der-differential  effects  (Gultig  et  al.,  2023;  Schenker 
et al., 2023) or the impact of sex hormone-related fac-
tors  (Krinke  et  al.,  2022;  Maslahati  et  al.,  2023), 
although  many  of  the  included  articles  noted  this  as 
a  relevant  limitation  in  their  discussion.  Hence,  it  is 
recommended  that  future  biological  trauma  studies 
further investigate sex and/or gender effects.

4. Conclusions  and future research

The large number of articles included in this special 
issue  shows  biological  research  into  trauma  and 
trauma-related  disorders  is  thriving.  Collectively, 
the  included  articles  showcase  that  significant  steps 
are  taken  to  advance  our  understanding  of  the  bio-
logical  mechanisms  underlying  the  development  of 
and  susceptibility  to  trauma-related  disorders,  as 
well  the  recovery  from  these  disorders.  Our  hope  is 
that  this  increasing  knowledge  base  will  eventually 

facilitate  the  development  of  more  effective  preven-
tive,  early  and  curative  intervention  strategies,  as 
well  as  more  effective  personalised  interventions 
and  timely  allocation  towards  these  interventions. 
This is highly pertinent, as trauma-related disorders 
remain  a  significant  public  health  problem  given 
the  ongoing  high  lifetime  prevalence  of  these  dis-
orders  (Kessler  et  al.,  2017),  and  the  fact  that  evi-
dence-based  treatments  are  not  sufficiently  effective 
treatment-receiving 
for  a  considerable  part  of 
patients  (Semmlinger  et  al.,  2024).  In  the  preceding 
section  we  outlined  several  important  recommen-
dations  should  be  taken  into  account  in  future  bio-
logical  research  into  trauma  and  trauma-related 
disorders:  trauma  exposure  characteristics;  sex  and/ 
or  gender  (minority)-related  factors;  developmen-
tal/lifespan  and  transgenerational  aspects;  and  the 
temporal dynamics of biological processes in relation 
to  the stage  of the  disorder under  investigation. We 
therefore  recommend  that  future  biological  studies 
into  trauma-related  disorders  carefully  consider 
which  study  designs  and  statistical  and  compu-
tational  methodological  approaches  are  appropriate 
to  truly  disentangle  the  effects  of  these  factors  on 
the  biological  mechanisms  behind  adverse  mental 
health outcomes of trauma (see Box 1).

Box  1.  Recommendations  for  future  biological  research  on 
trauma-related  disorders

Study  design 

.

Prioritise  prospective,  longitudinal,  experimental,  and  clinical 
RCT  designs  to  better  capture  temporal  dynamics  and  causal 
mechanisms.

. Carefully  select  appropriate  statistical  and  computational 

methods to disentangle complex interactions between biological, 
psychological,  and contextual  factors. 

Sample  diversity 

.

Include  more  diverse  and  underrepresented  populations 
across: 
-  Geographic  regions
-  Developmental  stages/lifespan
-  Transgenerational  effects

Trauma  exposure  characteristics 

. Clearly  specify  and  incorporate: 

-  Type  of  trauma
-  Trauma  history
-  Developmental  timing  of  trauma  exposure

. Consider  broader definitions  of  trauma,  including  chronic  and 

insidious  stressors. 

Temporal  dynamics 

. Report  when  biological  measures  were  taken  relative  to: 

-  Trauma  exposure
-  Stage  of  disorder  (onset,  maintenance,  recovery)

Sex  and  gender  Considerations  

Explicitly  analyse  sex-  and  gender-related  factors

.
. Avoid  aggregating  sexes/genders  without  testing  for  differential 

effects.
