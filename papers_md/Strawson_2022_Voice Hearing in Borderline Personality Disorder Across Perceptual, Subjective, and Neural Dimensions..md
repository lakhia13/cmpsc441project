Abstract

Background: Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) commonly occur in the context of borderline personality disorder (BPD) 
yet remain poorly understood. AVH are often perceived by patients with BPD as originating from inside the head and hence 
viewed clinically as “pseudohallucinations,” but they nevertheless have a detrimental impact on well-being.
Methods:  The  current  study  characterized  perceptual,  subjective,  and  neural  expressions  of  AVH  by  using  an  auditory 
detection task, experience sampling and questionnaires, and functional neuroimaging, respectively.
Results: Perceptually, reported AVH correlated with a bias for reporting the presence of a voice in white noise. Subjectively, 
questionnaire measures indicated that AVH were significantly distressing and persecutory. In addition, AVH intensity, but 
not perceived origin (i.e., inside vs outside the head), was associated with greater concurrent anxiety. Neurally, fMRI of BPD 
participants demonstrated that, relative to imagining or listening to voices, periods of reported AVH induced greater blood 
oxygenation level–dependent activity in anterior cingulate and bilateral temporal cortices (regional substrates for language

Significance Statement

Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) commonly occur in the context of borderline personality disorder (BPD) yet remain poorly 
understood. We investigated the perceptual, subjective, and neural expressions of AVH by using an auditory detection task, ex-
perience sampling and questionnaires, and functional neuroimaging, respectively. Perceptually, reported AVH correlated with 
a bias for reporting the presence of a voice in white noise. Subjectively, questionnaire measures indicated that AVH were sig-
nificantly distressing and persecutory. In addition, AVH intensity, but not perceived origin (i.e., inside vs outside the head), was 
associated with greater concurrent anxiety. Neurally, participants showed patterns of activation that resemble those in other 
groups experiencing hallucinations. Neurally, participants showed patterns of activation that resemble those in other groups ex-
periencing hallucinations (e.g., the involvement of cingulate and language cortices). By describing AVH in BPD at multiple levels 
of assessment, we showed a similarity between the experience in BPD to other groups, thus demonstrating the need for the ex-
perience to be considered a treatment priority.

processing).  AVH  symptom  severity  was  associated  with  weaker  functional  connectivity  between  anterior  cingulate  and 
bilateral insular cortices.
Conclusion: In summary, our results indicate that AVH in participants with BPD are (1) underpinned by aberrant perceptual-
cognitive  mechanisms  for  signal  detection,  (2)  experienced  subjectively  as  persecutory  and  distressing,  and  (3)  associated 
with distinct patterns of neural activity that inform proximal mechanistic understanding. Our findings are like analogous 
observations  in  patients  with  schizophrenia  and  validate  the  clinical  significance  of  the  AVH  experience  in  BPD,  often 
dismissed as “pseudohallucinations.” These highlight a need to reconsider this experience as a treatment priority.

Introduction

in 

Patients  diagnosed  with  borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD) 
show  a  pattern  of  behavior  characterized  by  impulsivity  and 
instability 
interpersonal  relationships,  self-image,  and 
emotional  states  (American  Psychiatric  Association,  1994). 
Contemporary emphasis is placed on emotional instability (BPD 
is  encompassed  within  emotionally  unstable  personality  dis-
order);  however,  psychotic  symptoms  are  extremely  common, 
reflected  in  the  original  view  that  the  diagnosis  was  on  the 
“border” between psychosis and neurosis. Between 50% and 90% 
of  patients  with  BPD  report  hearing  voices  that  other  people 
do not hear (Yee et al., 2005; Kingdon et al., 2010). Importantly, 
such  auditory  verbal  hallucinations  (AVH)  are  a  risk  factor  for 
suicide plans, attempts, and hospitalization (Miller et al., 1993; 
Zonnenberg et al., 2016).

Despite their high prevalence and apparent importance, the 
central  relevance  of  AVH  to  patients  with  BPD  is  often  clinic-
ally undervalued. Because patients with BPD often report AVH as 
originating from an “inner location” (as opposed to the outside 
world), the veracity and significance of AVH may be questioned: 
these experiences are often labelled as “pseudo-hallucinations” 
(Wing  et  al.,  1974).  Empirical  studies,  however,  show  the  con-
cept  of  pseudohallucinations  has  low  construct  validity  and 
reliability  (Copolov  et  al.,  2004;  Daalman  et  al.,  2011).  Indeed, 
many  clinicians  find  the  term  confusing,  with  inconsistency 
in  its  usage  (Berrios  and  Dening,  1996).  Overall,  the  concept  is 
poorly predictive of diagnosis or clinical characteristics (van der 
Zwaard and Polak, 2001). However, the notion that AVH in BPD 
represent  pseudohallucinations  persists  and  fuels  a  hesitancy 
to  consider  the  experience  as  comparable—in  severity  or  val-
idity—with  AVH  in  schizophrenia  (Mustafa,  2020). The  current 
study was motivated to reappraise this issue through enhanced 
understanding of AVH in BPD.

In  patients  with  schizophrenia  and  related  psychotic  dis-
orders,  AVH  are  linked  to  cognitive  psychological  mechanisms 
that include externalizing biases in source monitoring (Brookwell 
et al., 2013; Griffin and Fletcher, 2017). This refers to the tendency 

to misattribute internally generated cognitive events to external 
sources  (Bentall  and  Slade,  1985;  Hoffman,  1986;  Fraser,  1993; 
Larøi  and Woodward,  2007).  In  auditory  yes-no  signal  detection 
tasks, participants report perceived presence or absence of an am-
biguous auditory stimulus (either very faint or embedded within 
white noise). Signal detection theory (Green and Swets, 1966) can 
be  applied  to  quantify  perceptual  sensitivity  (the  probability  of 
detecting a signal correctly, given the probability of a false alarm; 
see  The  Relationship  Between  Signal  Detection  and  AVH)  and 
response  bias  (the  tendency  to  report  “signal”  vs  “noise”). This 
latter  variable  is  particularly  interesting  here  because  it  poten-
tially informs us of how an ambiguous stimulus is interpreted or 
evaluated (Peters et al., 2016). Patients with psychosis, and even 
hallucination-prone non-clinical individuals, tend to over-report 
the presence of auditory targets (exhibit a liberal response bias) 
yet typically show no reliable differences in perceptual sensitivity 
(Bentall and Slade, 1985; Barkus et al., 2007; Waters et al., 2012). 
In fact, liberal biases in auditory detection appear primarily as-
sociated  with  AVH  and  not  the  presence  of  a  psychiatric  diag-
nosis  (Powers  et  al.,  2017),  indicating  a  relationship  between 
voice-hearing  and  the  evaluation  of  ambiguous  (external)  audi-
tory signals. Within the current study, we tested if liberal auditory 
responses bias without corresponding deficits in auditory sensi-
tivity  (i.e.,  the  profile  reported  in  people  with  a  psychosis  diag-
nosis) is also seen in people with a diagnosis of BPD.

Functional neuroimaging has been used to investigate neural 
correlates of AVH in patients with schizophrenia: AVH are linked 
to multiple functional alterations (Ćurčić-Blake et al., 2017) yet 
most  consistently  with  hyperactivity  in  language-related  tem-
poral  lobe  regions  (Allen  et  al.,  2008;  Jardri  et  al.,  2011;  Kühn 
and Gallinat, 2012; Orlov et al., 2018). It is unclear if AVH-driven 
neural activity is similar in patients with BPD to patients with 
schizophrenia.

The current study aimed to advance understanding of the cog-
nitive, subjective, and neurophysiological mechanisms underlying 
AVH in BPD patients. An auditory yes-no detection task was used 

Copyedited by:  

to assess whether psychosis-like response profiles are associated 
with  AVH  severity  in  BPD.  Structured  ratings  characterized  the 
subjective  experience  of AVH  (e.g.,  distressing  and  persecutory; 
and  perceived  internal  or  external  origin)  and  their  relation  to 
other clinical symptoms (including anxiety). Functional magnetic 
resonance  imaging  (fMRI),  in  a  symptom-capture  design,  deter-
mined neural correlates of AVH compared with hearing external 
auditory voice stimuli and (cued) imagined experiences of voices. 
Lastly,  we  used  resting-state  fMRI  to  map  associations  between 
interregional functional connectivity and AVH symptom severity. 
By approaching AVH at these 3 levels of description, we provide 
a  detailed  profile  and  deeper  understanding  of AVH  in  patients 
with  BPD. The  outcomes  of  this  study  can  be  evaluated  against 
published findings regarding hallucinatory phenomena in other 
diagnostic groups across the psychosis spectrum.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants

Fifty-two  participants  with  diagnosis  of  BPD  (n  females = 42,  n 
males = 10) with a mean age of 34 years (SD = 10.9) were recruited 
from  the  Sussex  and  Kent  regions  (UK)  with  the  assistance  of 
the  Sussex  Voices  Clinic,  Sussex  Partnership  NHS  Foundation 
Trust and Kent & Medway NHS & Social Care Partnership Trust. 
Diagnosis  of  schizophrenia  was  part  of  the  exclusion  criteria. 
To  ensure  they  were  voice  hearers,  participants  were  required 
to have experienced persistent AVH over the past 6 months. For 
full demographics and inclusion/exclusion criteria, see supple-
mentary Materials.

Three  participants  withdrew  from  the  study  after  they  were 
recruited but before taking part in the first phases, so they did not 
provide any data. One additional participant, who completed later 
phases  of  the  study,  did  not  complete  the  initial  clinical  phase. 
Therefore,  48  participants  first  attended  the  clinical  assessment 
phase, where questionnaires and interviews (face-to-face and on-
line)  were  completed  (see  Clinical Assessment). The  next  phase 
of  the  study,  a  signal  detection  task  (see  Signal  Detection Task), 
was completed by 22 participants (M age = 33 years, SD = 10.8; n fe-
males = 16, n males = 6). The final phase, a neuroimaging task (see 
Neuroimaging Assessment), was completed by 30 participants (M 
age = 32.9 years, SD = 10.3; n females = 26, n males = 4).

Ethical approval was obtained from South Central Berkshire 
“B” Research Ethics Committee via the National Research Ethics 
System  ID:  234 904,  with  sponsorship  from  Sussex  Partnership 
NHS Foundation Trust and Brighton and Sussex Medical School 
Research Governance and Ethics Committee. All data acquisition 
methods used were in accordance with international, national, 
and institutional guidelines. All participants gave informed con-
sent following Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.

Behavioral Assessments

The behavioral assessment phase included the clinical charac-
terization of patients using structured interviews and question-
naires  (see  Clinical  Assessment  Phase),  followed  by  the  signal 
detection task (see Signal Detection Task) completed by partici-
pants in another session.

Clinical Assessment Phase

First,  participants  completed  a  series  of  semi-structured 
interviews:  (1)  the  Positive  and  Negative  Syndrome  Scale  for 
Schizophrenia,  (2)  Psychotic  Symptoms  Rating  Scale—Auditory

Hallucinations,  and  (3)  Brief  Negative  Symptom  Scale.  Next, 
they completed a series of online questionnaires using Qualtrics 
(Qualtrics,  2013).  Notably,  they  completed  the  Brief  Symptom 
Impact  Scale  (BSIS;  designed  for  the  current  study)  and  the 
Revised Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire (Chadwick et al., 2000).
The BSIS is a 10-item measure of impact of AVH, relative to 
other symptoms, containing items corresponding to the 9 diag-
nostic  criteria  for  BPD  (e.g.,  identity  disturbance,  impulsivity, 
etc., see supplementary Materials), alongside 1 item relating to 
voice hearing. Participants ranked these 10 items in order of cur-
rent negative impact (in terms of distress and/or ability to func-
tion),  where  1 = “generally  affects  me  most”  and  10 = “generally 
affects me least.” BSIS-Voices refers to the ranked score of the 
AVH item.

The Revised Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire is a 35-item 
self-report  questionnaire  measuring  beliefs  about  the  malevo-
lence,  benevolence,  and  omnipotence  of  voices  alongside  be-
havioral and emotional responses to voices. Items are rated on 
a  4-point  ordinal  scale  ranging  from  0  (disagree)  to  3  (strongly 
agree). A recent factor analysis identified the 2 beliefs subscales 
assessing “persecutory beliefs about voices” (12 items [e.g., “My 
voice is persecuting me for no good reason”]; potential range of 
scores 0–36) and “benevolence beliefs” (6 items [e.g., “My voice 
wants  to  help  me”];  potential  range  of  scores  0–18)  (Strauss 
et al., 2018).

Signal Detection Task

Participants  completed  a  computer-based  task  in  which  they 
detected the presence or absence of a human voice embedded 
in auditory noise and rated their subjective decision confidence 
(Fig. 1A). Participants completed 200 self-paced trials (total time 
ranging between 15 and 25 minutes), grouped into 5 blocks of 40, 
which commenced when the participants pressed the space key. 
Trials  began  with  the  onset  of  a  fixation  cross  of  variable  dur-
ation  (200–400  ms).  Subsequently,  1500  ms  of  white  noise  was 
presented binaurally through stereo headphones at 50% of max-
imum speaker output. In 50% of trials, a 200-ms voice clip with 
gradual onset and offset was inserted into the noise at a random 
time.  This  stimulus  comprised  an  androgynous  voice  articu-
lating  the  syllable  “ba.”  Following  offset  of  the  auditory  white 
noise there was a fixed 300-ms period of silence followed by a 
response prompt. Participants then reported (5-second window) 
whether a voice stimulus was present (left arrow key) or absent 
(right  arrow  key).  After,  participants  indicated  whether  they 
were confident (left arrow key) or not confident (right arrow key). 
Participants were offered breaks between blocks. Task difficulty 
was  matched  across  participants  using  a  calibration  paradigm 
(Fig. 1B, detailed account in supplementary Materials.), whereby 
the volume of the signal was adjusted using a standard psycho-
physical “staircase” procedure (Levitt, 1971). This accounted for 
natural variation in auditory acuity across individuals. 

The Relationship Between Signal Detection and AVH

To  investigate  the  relationship  between  signal  detection  out-
come  measures  and AVH  symptoms,  we  examined  how  parti-
cipants’ response bias and perceptual sensitivity related to AVH 
symptom severity (BSIS). We quantified participants’ biases to-
wards reporting hearing a voice in noise using Signal Detection 
Theory (Green and Swets, 1966) to measure decision threshold c, 
also referred to as response bias. Response bias c represents the 
amount of “voice” evidence required to report that a voice was 
present.  When  c  takes  the  value  0,  participants  are  unbiased.

noise plus voice stimuli or just white noise. Confidence was also reported. (B) Trial sequence for the calibration procedure (supplementary Materials). Visual noise 

patches represent auditory white noise. 

Negative values (arising from a increase in hit and false alarm 
rates) correspond to a bias towards reporting “voice,” and posi-
tive values (arising from an decrease in hit and false alarm rates) 
correspond to a bias towards reporting “no voice.” This measure 
is  theoretically  independent  of  task  performance  (perceptual 
sensitivity  d’).  We  calculated  bias  c  and  sensitivity  d’  as  fol-
lows:

hits + 0.5
hits + misses + 1

false alarms + correct rejections + 1

where  Z  is  the  standard  z-score.  Hit  rate/false  alarm  rate  here 
reflects the probability of reporting “voice present” when a voice 
was present/absent. The addition of 0.5 to hits (report “present” 

on voice-present trials), misses (report “absent” on voice-present 
trials), false alarms (report “present” on voice-absent trials), and 
correct rejections (report “absent” on voice-absent trials) corres-
ponded to a correction for the possibility of empty cells (e.g., no 
false alarms).

We  aimed  to  assess  the  relationship  between  participants’ 
response  bias  (c),  perceptual  sensitivity  (d’),  and  their  AVH 
symptom severity (BSIS-Voices). Pearson correlations were con-
ducted in R (V 1.3.1093) (Team, 2015) to assess the relationship 
between  AVH  symptom  severity  and  both  response  bias  and 
perceptual sensitivity.

Assessing the Extent to Which AVH Were Perceived 
as Distressing and Persecutory

To  categorize  the  subjective  experience  of  AVH,  we  analyzed 
questionnaire-based measures of AVH at the state (distress) and 
trait  (persecutory)  level. We  report  descriptive  statistics  on  (1) 
responses to the in-scanner distress item (Table 1, Question 2), 
and  (2)  responses  to  BAVQ-Persecutory  and  BAVQ-Benevolent

NEUROIMAGING ASSESSMENTS

Scanning Protocol and Preprocessing

Patients  completed  1  structural  scan  and  four  8-minute  func-
tional scans. The task details of the functional scans are in 3.2.

Preprocessing of functional imaging datasets was performed 
using FMRIPREP [RRID:SCR_016216], a Nipype [RRID:SCR_002502] 
based tool (Esteban et al., 2019). Detailed information regarding 
scanning  parameters  and  preprocessing  procedures  can  be 
found in the Supplementary Materials.

Neuroimaging Task Paradigms

Each participant completed 4 runs within the fMRI task protocol. 
The first run was a resting-state scan in which the participant 
lay with eyes open for 8 minutes. On-screen instructions stated 
“if  you  hear  your  voice/s,  press  the THUMB  button  when  your 
voice/s  start/stop.” The  participant  then  completed  3  random-
ized  task  runs.  Each  8-minute  run  consisted  of  5  blocks  of  10 
trials. Each block was 1 of 3 conditions (fixation-cross; externally 
presented verbal stimuli; cued imaginary verbal stimuli). Blocks 
were pseudo-randomized within-runs and fixed across partici-
pants. To ensure instances of AVH were recorded throughout the 
task, during all conditions, the participant was reminded (after 
condition-specific instructions) to report the onset and offset of 
an AVH using the thumb button.

In the first condition, the participant fixated on a cross, and 
there  were  no  additional  instructions  other  than  to  indicate 
the presence of AVH. In the second condition, auditory verbal 
stimuli were played through headphones, and the participant 
was  instructed  to  press  a  button  with  their  index  finger  on 
the onset and offset of these stimuli. These stimuli consisted 
of spoken word sentences. Stimuli were constructed to mimic 
typical hallucinatory content. For example, one stimulus said 
“Oi, can you hear me? I’m not going anywhere.” Stimulus con-
tent  was  derogatory,  ambiguous,  or  neutral  and  were  from 
third-  and  second-person  perspectives.  Stimulus  duration 
varied  from  1.17  to  5.36  seconds  (M = 3.42,  SD = .84).  Volume 
was  root  mean  square  normalized.  More  details  of  voice 
stimuli  can  be  seen  in  the  supplementary  Materials.  In  the 
third condition, the participant was instructed, when cued, to 
imagine voices. The participant was told “whenever the cross 
turns RED, press the FINGER button, and imagine hearing your 
voices . . . whenever the cross turns BLACK, press the FINGER 
button again, and relax.” To help perform this task, the partici-
pant wrote down 5 examples of things their voices say, prior 
to scanning.

Abbreviation: AVH, auditory verbal hallucinations. 

During  all  functional  runs,  a  white  fixation  cross  was  pre-
sented centrally on a grey screen. The cross turned red during 
conditions 2 and 3 when stimuli were present. It did not change 
color  during  the  fixation-cross  condition.  During  all  runs,  the 
lower portion of the screen also displayed the phrase “my voices 
are  .  .  .”  beneath  which  the  words  present  and  absent  were 
shown. When the participant indicated the presence of AVH, the 
word present turned white and absent turned grey.

Experience Sampling Protocol

At  the  end  of  each  run,  the  participant  was  asked  a  series  of 
questions  (Table  1)  on  a  visual  analogue  scale  relating  to AVH 
occurring  in  the  previous  time  period. The  participant  was  in-
vited to “use the THUMB and FINGER button to move the slider” 
left and right, respectively. Questions 2 to 5 were only asked if 
the participant responded positively to question 1. The partici-
pant was given 5 seconds to answer each question.

Experience Sampling and Behavioral Data Analysis

Principal  Component  Analysis—Principal  component  analysis 
(PCA)  with  varimax  rotation  was  performed  (using  SPSS,  V25, 
IBM Corp, 2017) on responses to the 4 questions relating to de-
scriptions of AVH (questions 2–5; Table 1). Component extraction 
was  based  on  analysis  of  the  correlation  matrix.  Components 
with Eigenvalues >1 were retained. As there were only 4 items, 
PCA  was  not  used  simply  for  dimension  reduction:  PCA  also 
allows  for  a  compact  description  of  the  linear  relationship  be-
tween item responses to identify “patterns of experience” (com-
ponents). Importantly, this analysis produces scores describing 
how well each observation is described by the given components.
Linear  Mixed  Model  on  PCA  Factor  Scores  and  Anxiety—The  in-
fluence  of  different  components  of  the  AVH  experience  on 
clinically  relevant  changes  in  affect  were  then  investigated 
using  in-scanner  anxiety  ratings.  To  determine  how  AVH  ex-
perience  sampling  principal  components  correlated  with  the 
run-by-run  anxiety  ratings  reported  in  the  scanner,  we  con-
structed linear mixed models of these the run-by-run data for 
all  participants  together  by  (Table  2),  using  the  package  lme4

(Bates et al., 2015) in R. To test goodness-of-fit, individual models 
were compared with reduced models using a chi-squared test (R 
function ANOVA).

General Linear Model Voxel-Based fMRI Analysis

First-Level Analysis—Functional neuroimaging data analyses was 
conducted  using  FSL’s  FEAT  (Woolrich  et  al.,  2001,  2004;  Smith 
et al., 2004). General linear modeling (GLM) was conducted to as-
certain which voxels’ blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) 
signal was associated with the experimental regressors of interest 
over the 3 non-rest functional runs. At the individual participant 
(first)  level,  for  each  run,  3  event-related  boxcar  regressors  were 
modeled that corresponded to timing of button presses for (1) ex-
ternal voices, (2) imagined voices, and (3) AVH. Each regressor was 
convolved  with  a  double  gamma  function  to  model  the  hemo-
dynamic  responses.  See  supplementary  materials  for  details  on 
nuisance regressors. Overall, 10 contrasts were computed at this 
first level (Table 3) to isolate activity related to each of the 3 event 
types. Notably, contrast 8 (AVH > external) highlighted activity as-
sociated  with  periods  of  AVH  relative  to  activity  elicited  by  the 
perception  of  externally  presented  voices.  Contrast  9  (AVH > im-
agined) highlighted activity associated with periods of AVH while 
removing  activity  associated  with  imagining  voices.  Contrast  10 
(AVH > external + imagined)  highlighted  activity  associated  with 
periods of AVH while removing activity associated with both tasks.
Higher-Level  Analyses—A  fixed-effect  design  was  conducted  to 
average  runs  within  each  participant.  Individual  participant 
data were then entered into a higher-level group analysis using 
a  mixed-effects  design.  Higher-level  contrasts  were  computed 
to  extract  the  group  average  of  these  second-level  parameter 
estimates.  Group-level  maps  were  thresholded  with  a  cluster 
forming threshold of Z > 2.3 (P < .01) at an alpha value of P < .05 
to  correct  for  multiple  comparisons  at  the  cluster-wise  level. 
Due to analytical limitations, only functional runs in which ac-
tive AVH were reported via button presses were included in this 
analysis. This equated to a total of 43 (out of 81) task runs from 
17  participants  out  of  the  30  participants  who  completed  this 
phase  of  the  study. After  accounting  for  missing  data,  41  runs 
were entered in higher-level analysis.

of functional connectivity between clusters of activation identi-
fied by the AVH > external + imagined contrast and other voxel 
clusters  across  the  whole  cortex  covaried  with  AVH  symptom 
severity (BSIS-Voices). The seeds used during this analysis were 
binarized  masks  of  significant  task  clusters  of  the  AVH > ex-
ternal + imagined contrast (contrast 10, Table 2). Details on the 
location  of  these  clusters  can  be  seen  in  the  results  section  
(Fig. 4C). Using FSL, the mean signal across all the voxels within 
each  mask  for  the  resting-run  was  computed  to  derive  the 
seed time series. This time series was used as the explanatory 
variable  at  the  first-level  analyses,  along  with  the  nuisance 
regressors corresponding to those used in the task GLM. At the 
second-level  (group)  analysis,  AVH  symptom  severity  scores 
(BSIS-Voices) were entered as a covariate. Age and overall head 
movement (mean framewise displacement) were also included 
as nuisance regressors.

Group-level maps were thresholded the same as the previous 
analysis. Twenty-six participants reported hearing voices during 
this resting scan (via button press), so analysis was conducted 
on single runs from 26 participants.

RESULTS

Relationship Between AVH Symptom Severity, 
Response Bias, and Perceptual Sensitivity

We examined the relationship between AVH symptom severity 
(BSIS-Voices) and signal detection theory measures of response 
bias  (c)  and  perceptual  sensitivity  (d’)  using  2  Pearson’s  cor-
relations. These  tested  if  symptom  severity  (across  the  21  in-
dividuals  who  completed  both  signal  detection  and  relevant 
questionnaire  measures)  varied  with  differences  in  response 
bias and/or perceptual sensitivity.

The first correlation (Fig. 2A) revealed greater AVH symptom 
severity  (as  indicated  by  lower  BSIS-Voices  scores)  was  associ-
ated  with  a  more  liberal  response  bias  (as  indicated  by  more 
negative  values  of  c)  (r(19) = .65,  P = .001,  95%  CI  [0.31,  0.85]).  In 
other  words,  participants  with  more  severe  AVH  symptoms 
exhibited  a  stronger  bias  towards  reporting “voice  present.”  In 
contrast,  the  second  correlation  (Fig.  2B)  indicated  that  AVH 
symptom severity was not significantly associated with percep-
tual sensitivity (r(19) = −.18, P = .443, 95% CI [−0.57, 0.28]).

Levels of Distress and Persecutory Beliefs in 
Hallucinations

AVH  experiences  were  shown  to  be  distressing:  a  mean 
in-scanner  distress  score  (Question  2, Table  1)  of  61.72  was  re-
ported across the 21 participants who indicated via Question 1 
(Table  2)  that  they  experienced AVH  in  the  previous  (task  and 
rest)  run  (n  responses = 60,  SD = 25.50).  When  looking  at  re-
sponses  to  questions  during  the  clinical  assessment  phase, 
participants rated their voices to be more persecutory than ben-
evolent (measured by BAVQ-Persecutory and BAVQ-Benevolent, 
respectively).  After  rescaling  both  subscales  to  be  on  a  1–10 
scale, scores were higher for persecutory beliefs (n = 33, M = 4.56, 
SD = 2.57) than benevolent beliefs (n = 33, M = 1.41, SD = 2.00).

Relationship Between AVH Intensity, AVH Location, 
and Anxiety

To  characterize  the  relationship  between  different  descriptive 
aspects  of  the AVH  experience,  PCA  was  performed  on  the  re-
sponses  to  AVH  questions  obtained  during  the  neuroimaging 
experiment. A total 21 (out of 30) participants reported hearing 
voices (positive answers to “I heard my voice/s”) on 60 out of 111 
(task and rest) runs. Therefore, 60 observations of responses to 
Questions  2  to  5  were  collected.  PCA  was  performed  on  these 
observations and 2 components were extracted. The first com-
ponent (named AVH intensity, accounted for 47.11% of variance) 
captured AVH described as prevalent (Table 1, Question 2; com-
ponent  loading = 0.82),  loud  (Question  3;  0.85),  and  distressing 
(Question  4;  0.70).  The  second  component  (AVH  location,  ac-
counted  for  25.51%  of  variance)  captured  AVH  perceived  as 
coming  from  outside  the  head  (Question  5;  loading = 0.99). The 
item loadings on each of these components are represented as 
word clouds in Fig. 3.

We tested whether AVH intensity was associated with anx-
iety  by  fitting  the  intensity  model  [anxiety  ~  1 + AVH  inten-
sity + (1|patient)]  to  the  anxiety  reports.  Goodness-of-fit  was 
compared with a reduced model [anxiety ~ 1 + (1|patient)] that 
did not include the factor of intensity. The inclusion of intensity 
significantly  improved  goodness-of-fit  (X2(1) = 6.74,  P = .009)  and 
was  such  that  higher  intensity  was  associated  with  increased 
reported anxiety (β = 8.36).

We  repeated  this  process  for  AVH  location,  comparing  the 
location  [anxiety  ~  1 + AVH  location + (1|patient)]  and  reduced 
model.  While  intensity  was  associated  with  anxiety  ratings, 
this was not the case for location. Goodness-of-fit was not im-
proved by modeling this fixed effect (β = 2.18, X2(1) = 0.36, P = .549). 
Together,  these  results  indicate  that  AVH  rated  as  prevalent, 
loud,  and  distressing  (greater  AVH  intensity)  were  associated 
with significantly greater levels of anxiety. AVH location had no 
significant association with anxiety levels.

VOXEL-BASED GLM RESULTS

A  GLM  was  conducted  on  the  task-based  fMRI  data  to  reveal 
the neural correlates of AVH. Group-level maps are presented in

Figure 4. It shows that for all 3 contrasts, there were significant 
clusters  of  activation  for  AVH.  Of  primary  interest  is  anterior 
cingulate  cortex,  which  exhibited  higher  BOLD  during  AVH 
compared with external and imagined voices (P = .002). In add-
ition,  BOLD  was  higher  in  paracingulate  gyrus  (P = .001)  and  in 
left middle (P < .001) and right superior temporal gyrus (P = .004) 
during AVH compared with imagined voices alone. For more de-
tails, see supplementary Table 1.

The statistical map for the significant rostral anterior cin-
gulate cluster (ACC) resulting from the AVH > imagined + ex-
ternal  contrast  was  binarized  into  a  mask  and  used  as  a 
seed  in  the  subsequent  resting-state  functional  connectivity 
analysis.

RESTING-STATE SEED-BASED FUNCTIONAL 
CONNECTIVITY

Seed-based  functional  connectivity  analysis  was  conducted 
on  resting-state  runs  to  assess  how  the  strength  of  connect-
ivity  between  the  ACC  seed  and  the  whole  brain  covaried 
with  AVH  symptom  severity  (BSIS-Voices).  As  illustrated  in 
Figure  5,  greater  AVH  symptom  severity  was  associated  with 
less ACC-insula  (right)  (P < .001), ACC-insula  (left)  (P < .001),  and 
ACC-parahippocampal  gyrus  (P < .001)  resting-state  functional 
connectivity. For more details, see supplementary Table 2.

DISCUSSION

The common experience of AVH by patients with BPD is a poorly 
understood  phenomenon.  In  clinical  practice,  AVH  in  BPD  are 
often  described  as  pseudohallucinations,  casting  doubt  on  the 
significance, and even validity, of the patient’s experience. The 
term  pseudohallucinations  conflates  symptom  phenomen-
ology  with  categorical  diagnostic  distinction  between  person-
ality  disorder  and  psychotic  illnesses  (notably  schizophrenia). 
Consequently,  there  is  hesitancy  for  some  researchers  and 
clinicians to consider AVH in BPD as comparable with those in 
schizophrenia.  However,  the  present  study  reinforces  evidence 
that  the AVH  experience  in  BPD  is  comparable  with  other  pa-
tients across the psychosis spectrum in terms of the cognitive 
mechanisms, subjective experience, and neural substrates.

We  demonstrated  that  patients  with  BPD  who  experience 
more severe AVH show a greater propensity (were more liberal) 
to  report  an  auditory  signal—here,  detecting  a  voice  in  white 
noise. With increasing AVH severity, there was a decrease in re-
sponse bias, c, indicating a greater tendency towards reporting 
false  alarms  (i.e.,  erroneous  hear  a  voice)  in  the  signal  detec-
tion  task.  No  association  was  observed  between  voice  hearing 
symptomatology  (as  quantified  using  BSIS-V)  and  perceptual 
sensitivity  (d’),  suggesting  that  those  with  more  severe  symp-
toms  were  not  better  or  worse  at  detecting  voices. This  same 
pattern  is  also  reported  in  signal  detection  studies  of  patients 
on the psychosis spectrum and in non-clinical individuals who 

experience  hallucinations  (Rappaport  et  al.,  1972;  Bentall  and 
Slade,  1985;  Hoffman,  1986;  Fraser,  1993;  Larøi  and Woodward, 
2007; Vercammen et al., 2008; Brookwell et al., 2013; Griffin and 
Fletcher, 2017).

We demonstrated that AVH in patients with BPD are associ-
ated with adverse subjective experiences: AVH were reported by 
patients with BPD, on a trait level, to be more persecutory than 
benevolent and, on a state level, to evoke marked subjective dis-
tress. This endorses earlier findings that AVH experience in BPD 
causes high levels of distress through derogatory, negative, and 
critical  content  (Hepworth  et  al.,  2013;  Pearse,  2014).  Moreover, 
these  affective  qualities  are  very  similar  to  those  ascribed  to 
AVH experience in schizophrenia (Slotema et al., 2012).

Ascertaining  which  aspects  of  the  AVH  experience  are 
coupled to heightened anxiety levels has important clinical im-
plications. Here, we observed that anxiety levels increased with 
increasing  intensity  (loudness,  prevalence,  distress)  of  AVH, 
but there was no significant relationship with the location (in-
ternal or external) of AVH perception. The perception of an AVH 
as originating from within the head is 1 key factor proposed to 
distinguish  a  pseudohallucination  from  “true”  hallucinations. 
However, we showed that AVH with an “inner” location are no 
less anxiety-provoking than those with an “outer” location. This 
challenges the clinical relevance of the pseudo/real distinction 
(based  on  perceived  location)  in  terms  of  the  affective  impact 
of  AVH.  Phenomenologically,  the  interior/exterior  distinction 
might retain other etiological relevance (Anthony, 2004), yet the

prefix  pseudo-  undermines  the  clinical  credibility  of  those  ex-
periencing  inner  AVH. Whether  an  AVH  is  “heard”  is  arguably 
a more suitable way of determining whether it is real (Hunter, 
2004).  Our  results  suggest  that  the  reported  intensity,  rather 
than their location, should inform assessment of the clinical im-
pact of hallucinations in BPD, particularly in relation to negative 
affective symptoms.

We used fMRI to characterize and compare AVH-related re-
gional  brain  activity  to  listening  to  externally  presented  sen-
tences  and  imagining  similar  auditory  verbal  content.  Relative 
to both the listening and imagination tasks, AVH elicited greater 
activity within rostral ACC and adjacent prefrontal cortex. ACC 
activation  is  previously  reported  to  distinguish  hallucinating 
patients  (with  schizophrenia)  from  non-hallucinating  controls 
(Jardri  et  al.,  2011).  Moreover,  real-time  modulation  of ACC  ac-
tivity (using fMRI neurofeedback) in patients with schizophrenia 
was reported to evoke changes in both AVH severity and mood, 
suggesting a causal role of ACC activation in affect-laden hallu-
cinatory experience (Dyck et al., 2016).

AVH  experience  was  also  associated  with  greater  activity 
within  lateral  temporal  cortices,  considered  specialized  for 
language processing. The right middle temporal gyrus and left 
posterior  superior  temporal  gyrus  (STG)  showed  higher  ac-
tivity  when  the  participants  experienced  AVH  than  when  im-
agining  that  they  were  hearing  a  similar  voice. These  regions, 
identified  as  core  structures  within  a  functional  network  sup-
porting speech and human voice processing (Belin et al., 2000; 

Hickok  and  Poeppel,  2007),  have  also  been  proposed  as  neural 
substrates  underlying  AVH.  For  example,  individuals  who  ex-
perience  AVH  (but  without  psychosis)  exhibit  higher  levels  of 
resting-state functional connectivity between left and right STG 
than  matched  controls  (Diederen  et  al.,  2013).  Even  in  silence, 
neural activity within left temporal language regions (including 
STG)  shows  endogenous  fluctuations  in  concert  with  changes 
in ACC  activation  (Hunter  et  al.,  2006),  suggesting  a  functional 
coupling  between  temporal  and  cingulate  regions.  Taken  to-
gether,  these  results  suggest  that  the  observed  activity  within 
language and cingulate regions associated with AVH may reflect 
a  mechanism  through  which AVH  are  generated,  through  dys-
functional cingulo-temporal connectivity.

Symptom-capture  studies  of  AVH  echo  the  involvement 
of temporal language regions: meta-analyses support greater 
activation in STG and adjacent temporo-parietal language re-
gions  during  AVH  experience  in  patients  with  schizophrenia 
(Ćurčić-Blake et al., 2017). There also seems to be a causal re-
lationship  between AVH  and  STG,  because  transcranial  mag-
netic  stimulation  to  temporo-parietal  cortex  reduces  AVH 
severity  (Hoffman  et  al.,  2007;  Kindler,  2013).  Furthermore,  a 
proof-of-concept neurofeedback study reported reductions in 
psychotic symptoms and AVH distress when STG activity was 
volitionally  downregulated  (Orlov  et  al.,  2018). Thus,  the  cur-
rent study’s observations are consistent with suggestions of a 
central role of language-specialized temporal cortices in AVH 
experience.

In  summary,  the  task-based  fMRI  analysis  showed  that 
dorsal and rostral ACC activity was associated with AVH, while 
resting-state analysis suggest that the rostral ACC may work in 
conjunction  with  the  insula  to  bring  about  the  emergence  of 
AVH in a manner that varies with AVH severity.

Among other things, the dorsal and rostral ACC are implicated 
in  the  control  of  internal  physiological  arousal  and  its  integra-
tion  with  deployment  of  attentional,  cognitive,  and  behavioral 
resources (Critchley et al., 2003, 2005, Critchley,  2005). Moreover, 
the ACC has been shown to work in concert with the insula, the-
oretically  to  enable  the  dynamic  integrative  control  of  internal 
bodily  state  (Medford  and  Critchley,  2010).  This  representation 
enables  physiological  arousal  states  be  matched  with  percep-
tual, cognitive, and affective processing and associated behaviors 
(Craig,  2009;  Seth  and Tsakiris,  2018).  Moreover,  this  interocep-
tive representation is posited to be a crucial reference for intact 
self-awareness  (Tsakiris  et  al.,  2007;  Craig,  2009;  Critchley  and 
Harrison, 2013). Neurological damage to insula regions can con-
tribute to anosagnostic denial of paralysis and somatoparaphrenia 
(Vallar and Ronchi, 2009), and insula activity has been found to 
predict the modulation of illusory experiences of body ownership 
in the rubber hand illusion (Tsakiris et al., 2007). Accordingly, the 
aberrant ACC–insula connectivity observed in the current study 
may  be  indicative  of  a  dysfunction  in  the  integrity  of  biological 
self-hood and thus give rise to self-disturbance. In turn, this may 
manifest  as  dissociative  and  psychotic  experiences,  including 
problems  with  source  monitoring  and,  by  extension,  hallucin-
ations. A link between physiological arousal states and AVH has 
been established by a recent study using an experience sampling 
(ecological momentary assessment) study with heart rate moni-
toring of patients with schizophrenia (Kimhy et al., 2017). Periods 
of  heightened  cardiac  autonomic  arousal  (including  the  with-
drawal  of  vagally  mediated  heart  rate  variability)  predict  tran-
sitory  increases  in  auditory  hallucinations. This  evidence  lends 
support to this hypothesis that physiological arousal and its in-
teroceptive representation, relying on processing in the ACC and 
insula, may play an important role in AVH.

LIMITATIONS

To our knowledge, this study represents the largest multimethod 
investigation  of  AVH  in  well-characterized  patients  with  BPD. 
However, we did not study parallel control groups of non-clinical 
individuals  (including  “voice-hearers”)  or  patients  with  diag-
noses  of  schizophrenia.  Consequently,  inferences  concerning 
the similarity of BPD experience of AVH to other patient groups 
draw  on  measures  of  symptom  variation  across  our  patient 
group  and  from  comparison  with  published  evidence. The  ab-
sence of a control group also means we are unable to determine 
if the titration levels in the signal detection paradigm are atyp-
ical.  Our  findings  motivate  the  need  to  compare  AVH  in  BPD 
with other populations susceptible to AVH. Another constraint, 
shared by similar studies, is the general use of temporally static 
measures  of  data  analysis.  Distinct  extrinsic  and  intrinsic  fac-
tors may trigger a hallucination, yet other factors may contribute 
to sustaining and/or stopping it. Neurally, this may include dy-
namic reconfigurations of functional brain networks at different 
time points within a hallucination. Here, we used static post hoc 
measures of neural connectivity, thereby emphasizing stronger 
and temporally more stable interactions. A richer understanding 
of neural correlates of AVH may be achieved if future investiga-
tions apply dynamic analytic methods [e.g., sliding windows or 
Hidden  Markov  Models  (Chen  et  al.,  2017)]  that  capture  time-
varying functional states over shorter temporal windows. Lastly, 

the  BSIS-Voices  measure  assesses  voice  hearing  in  relation  to 
other  symptoms,  arguably  making  it  a  more  holistic  measure 
of  BPD  experience  assessed  from  the  patient’s  perspective 
(Hayward  et  al.,  2021). The  BSIS,  completed  by  the  majority  of 
patients,  corresponds  significantly  to  established  scales  such 
as  the  PSYRATS  (r(30) = −.42,  P = .02)  and  hence  was  chosen  as 
our  primary  measure  to  assess  voice  hearing.  For  consistency 
with  prior  literature,  we  repeated  the  behavioral  analysis  (i.e., 
how  signal  detection  measures  relate  to  AVH  severity)  using 
PSYRATS.  Both  measures  demonstrated  a  significant  positive 
relationship between criterion (bias) and AVH symptomatology 
(see supplementary Material).

CONCLUSION

The  current  study  characterized  AVH  experience  in  BPD  over 
cognitive,  subjective,  and  neural  levels.  Critically,  across  all 
3  levels  of  assessment,  our  findings  highlight  the  broad  simi-
larity of AVH experience in patients with BPD to reported AVH 
experience of non-clinical and clinical groups across the psych-
osis  spectrum.  Our  findings  challenge  the  categorization  of 
AVH  in  BPD  as  pseudohallucinations  and  highlight  the  need 
to  recontextualize  the  phenomenology  and  clinical  impact  of 
AVH  in  BPD  for  consideration  as  a  priority  treatment  target. 
Insights from the neural level of assessment allude to the pos-
sible  dependence  of  AVH  on  physiological  arousal  states  and 
their  control.  Future  research  is  needed,  ideally  incorporating 
neuroimaging with concurrent physiological assessment, to in-
vestigate  dynamic  interoceptive  mechanisms  underlying  the 
expression of hallucinations.
