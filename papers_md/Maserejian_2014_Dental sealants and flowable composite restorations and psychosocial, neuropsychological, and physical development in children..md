Abstract

Purpose—Dental sealant materials may release their components, including bisphenol-A (BPA), 
intra-orally, but long-term health effects are uncertain. The New England Children’s Amalgam 
Trial (NECAT) found that composite restorations were associated with psychosocial, but not 
neuropsychological or physical, outcomes. The previous analysis did not consider sealants and 
preventive resin restorations (PRRs), which were routinely placed during NECAT. This analysis 
examines sealant/PRR exposure in association with psychosocial and other health outcomes.

Methods—NECAT recruited 534 children aged 6–10 years and provided dental care during 5-
year follow-up. Annually, examiners conducted psychosocial and neuropsychological tests, and 
measured body mass index (BMI) and fat percentage (BF%). Associations between surface-years 
(SY) of sealants/PRRs and outcomes were tested using multivariable models.

Results—Cumulative exposure level to sealants and/or PRRs was not associated with 
psychosocial assessments (e.g. total problems: Child Behavior Checklist, 10-SY β=−0.2, SE=0.3, 
P=0.6) or neuropsychological tests (e.g. full-scale IQ, 10-SY β=0.1, SE=0.2, P=0.6). There were 
no associations for changes in BMI-for-age z-score (P=0.4), BF% (girls 10-SY β= −0.2 SE=0.3; 
boys 10-SY β= −0.1 SE=0.3), or menarche (10-SY hazard ratio=0.91, 95%CI 0.83–1.01, P=0.08).

Conclusions—This analysis showed no significant associations between exposure level of 
dental sealants or PRRs and behavioral, neuropsychological, or physical development in children 
during 5-year follow-up.

INTRODUCTION

Dental sealants on primary and permanent molar teeth are an important component of 
children’s oral health and caries prevention.1–3 Despite their proven benefits, recent 
concerns regarding chemical exposures from dental materials have resulted from laboratory 
findings indicating that the resins used in sealants are possible exposure sources to 
bisphenol-A (BPA) and other compounds that have potential adverse effects.4–7 BPA is a 
well-known endocrine disruptor and causes a variety of adverse health effects at low dose 
exposure levels in laboratory animal experiments.8 The main monomer used in many 
manufactured sealants today, bisphenol-A-glycidyl-dimethacrylate (bisGMA), has also been 
shown to cause local cytotoxicity, DNA damage, and estrogenic activity.9–13 For example, 
BisGMA exposure significantly reduced fertility, with reductions in sperm counts, weights 
of testis and preputial glands, and overall body weight in adult male mice,14 and 
significantly increased embryo resorption rates and ovary weights in adult female mice.15 
Observational human cohort studies have identified associations between urinary BPA levels 
and various adverse health measures, ranging from behavior problems in children to 
coronary artery disease in adults.16–22 However, additional longitudinal studies are needed to 
help examine causal associations.

Clinical studies measuring salivary and/or urinary bisGMA, BPA and other compounds 
before and after placement of sealants or composite restorations have shown increased 
biomarker levels up to 30 hours after their placement in adults.23–27 Children have higher 
levels of urinary BPA than all other age groups in the U.S. and may be most sensitive to 
exposure effects.28 Previously, we examined the association of composite restoration 
placement with adverse health outcomes over five years, using data from the New England 
Children’s Amalgam Trial (NECAT). NECAT randomized 534 children to receive either 
amalgam or composite for posterior tooth restorations, collecting detailed data to allow an 
examination of treatment levels over time. While results showed no adverse effects for 
amalgam,29 children randomized to composites, especially those with greater exposure to 
bisGMA-based composites, had worse psychosocial health measures during follow-up.30, 31

Further examination of neuropsychological test scores and physical development measures 
showed no consistent associations between composites and those outcomes, indicating 
specificity to behavioral health effects.32, 33

In addition to restorative fillings, all children participating in NECAT received pit and 
fissure sealants during the 5-year trial, and, as needed, flowable composite for preventive 
resin restorations (PRRs) for shallow caries. Compared to composites used for restorations, 
sealants are designed to be highly flowable, to facilitate their infiltration onto the surfaces of 
dental pits and fissures. The high viscosity of sealants and flowable composites is attained 
by using substantially greater amounts of resin monomers that contain bisGMA.

No prior studies have examined exposure to dental sealants in association with long-term 
adverse health effects in children. The objective of this manuscript was to examine whether, 
consistent with previous findings for packable composite restorations in NECAT,30, 31 
flowable composite (sealants and PRRs) treatment levels were associated with the 
behavioral outcome measures. We also examined associations between sealants/PRRs and 
neuropsychological and physical development measures during the 5-year follow-up.

METHODS

Study Population

NECAT was a randomized safety clinical trial of amalgam vs. composite for posterior 
restorations conducted among 534 children at six community dental clinics in urban Boston 
and rural Maine from 1997–2005. Eligible children were aged 6–10 years at baseline, had no 
existing amalgam restorations; ≥2 posterior teeth with caries requiring restoration on 
occlusal surfaces; fluent in English, and, by parent-report, no physician-diagnosed 
psychological, behavioral, neurological, immunosuppressive or renal disease. Written 
informed consent was obtained from the parent/guardian, and signed assent was obtained for 
children aged eight years or older. The study was approved by the institutional review boards 
of New England Research Institutes (Watertown, MA, USA) and all participating sites. 
Additional details on the study procedures have been published.29, 34, 35

Dental Materials and Interventions

Participants received comprehensive dental care semi-annually during their 5-year 
participation. Standard dental care included exams, cleaning, fluoride application, sealant 
placement, and restorative treatment. Dental procedures and materials were standardized 
across study sites, following manufacturer’s indications for use. The flowable composite 
material used for preventive sealing of sound pits and fissures of posterior teeth, referred to 
as a sealant, was Ultraseal XT by Ultradent (South Jordan, Utah, USA). The flowable 
composite used for PRRs, which treated shallow, incipient caries that did not extend into the 
dentin, was Revolution by Kerr (Orange, Calif., USA). Composite restoration materials used 
were Z100 by 3M ESPE (St. Paul, Minn., USA) for permanent teeth, and Dyract AP 
compomer by Dentsply Caulk (Milford, Del., USA) for primary teeth. Sealants and PRRs 
were placed as needed regardless of assigned treatment group for restorations.

Health Outcome Measures

One supervising psychologist (D.C.B.) trained and certified examiners to conduct 
psychosocial and neuropsychological tests and continuously monitored them for quality 
control throughout the trial. The study used two validated instruments for psychosocial 
assessments at baseline and follow-up: (1) Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) parent-
report,36 and (2) Behavior Assessment for Children Self-Report (BASC-SR).37 Both are 
widely used in screening children and adolescents for psychosocial problems,38 yielding 
global T-scores (mean 50, SD=10) and core syndrome scores. Based on our previous 
findings, the primary outcomes of interest were BASC-SR scores on the four global scales 
(Total emotional symptoms index, Clinical maladjustment, School maladjustment, Personal 
adjustment) measured at the end of 5-year follow-up. We did not analyze change since 
baseline for BASC-SR because most (63 percent) of the subjects were <8 years of age at 
baseline, and BASC-SR was not developed or validated for children under eight years of 
age. Secondary behavioral outcomes were BASC-SR subscale scores, CBCL change scores, 
and the percentage of children with at-risk or clinically-significant scores at the end of 
follow-up.

For neuropsychological assessments, the study used a battery of validated tests of executive 
functioning, intelligence, memory, visual-spatial skills, verbal fluency, and problem-solving, 
which together help enhance interpretation of this complex outcome.39 Neuropsychological 
outcomes of interest were WISC-III Full-Scale IQ and factors of verbal comprehension, 
perceptual organization, freedom from distractibility, processing speed, the Wechsler 
Individual Achievement Test (WIAT) reading and math scores, and the following tests of 
executive function: Trail-Making Test, Letter Fluency subtest of Verbal Fluency, Stroop 
Color-Word Interference Test, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.

At baseline and annual follow-up visits, NECAT data collectors measured height, weight, 
and body fat percentage, using a calibrated bioimpedance scale (model TBF-551, Tanita 
Corp of America, Inc.).40 We calculated body mass index (kg/m2) and BMI-for-age z-score 
using the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data files, defining overweight or obese as a 
BMI-for-age z-score ≥ 85th percentile.41, 42 Female participants reported menarche status 
annually as no/yes, and if yes, month and year of menarche.

Statistical Analysis and Power

We excluded children who were missing data on placement of sealants (n=44), PRR (n=7), 
or both (n=33), resulting in 450 children in the total analytic cohort. We initially examined 
sealants and PRRs separately, and then combined them to create a measure of total flowable 
composite exposure, because (i) both contained bisGMA as a primary source monomer 
according to the material safety data sheets and (ii) PRRs were often placed using the same 
material as that used for preventive sealants. We calculated the cumulative treatment levels 
per subject using a surface-years (SY) measure, which takes each treated surface and 
weights it by the length of time that it was present in the mouth. We categorized surface-
years into four categories: none, and among the exposed, tertile of exposure level.

For each health outcome, we conducted statistical analyses separately and excluded children 
with missing outcome data (see results tables for sample sizes in each analysis). Numerous 
sensitivity analyses were conducted, such as: (i) excluding children (N=39) who had pre-
existing sealants at baseline, (ii) excluding children (also N=39, coincidentally) who had no 
sealants or PRRs during the study, because this deviation from standard clinical procedures 
may indicate an unmeasured source of confounding from children in this minority, and (iii) 
for analyses of psychosocial outcomes, excluding 302 children who ever received composite 
restorations during the study, given our previously reported findings of an association 
between composite restorations and psychosocial measures. Results of these sensitivity 
analyses confirmed those of the primary analyses and therefore are not presented.

Outcomes were analyzed as changes in score between baseline and follow-up for all 
measures except the BASC-SR (as explained above) and in the exploratory analysis of 
menarche. Physical development outcomes were analyzed separately for boys and girls. 
Repeated measurements of body fat percentage and body mass index based on annual study 
visits were used in linear mixed effects models. Models included subject-specific intercepts 
to account for natural heterogeneity in the population, age-specific slopes to account for 
differences in growth trajectory by baseline age and, if statistically significant, piece-wise 
linear splines to account for changes in growth at puberty.43 Age at menarche was analyzed 
among girls from the Maine clinical site only (N=113), because menarche data collection 
was incomplete at the Boston site.

We examined associations using multivariable models adjusting for relevant 
sociodemographic and dental variables. The following variables were included in the 
multivariable models, depending on the outcome of interest: age, sex, race/ethnicity (white, 
black, Hispanic, or other), household income, socioeconomic status, primary care giver’s 
marital status, geographic study region (urban Boston or rural Maine), blood lead level, fruit 
and vegetable intake, maternal alcohol/tobacco/drug exposure during pregnancy, and 
composite restorations (surface-years). Variables were retained in models if they were 
associated with the outcome at P<0.2 level (see footnotes of Tables 3–5 for variables 
included for each specific outcome). Using cross-product terms in the multivariable models, 
we tested interactions between sealant/PRR treatment levels and age, study site (Boston or 
Maine), or sex (for psychosocial and neuropsychological outcomes). Results are expressed 
as beta coefficients indicating the difference in test score or growth metric associated with a 
10-SY increase in sealant/PRR exposure, or adjusted mean value for each SY category, with 
standard errors (SE). For menarche, results are expressed as hazard ratio for time to 
menarche. The complete case analysis for psychosocial and neuropsychological measures 
had 80% power at alpha = 0.05 to detect a correlation of at least 0.14 between composites 
exposure level and changes in test scores. For physical development outcomes, the analysis 
had 80% power to detect a minimum correlation of 0.20 among boys and 0.16 among girls. 
For analyses of menarche, the subsample of 113 girls achieved 80% power to detect a 
regression coefficient equal to 0.0149 (hazard ratio of 1.015 for positive associations or 
0.985 for inverse associations). All analyses were conducted using SAS v.9.3 (Cary, NC) at 
alpha=0.05.

RESULTS

Page 6

The mean (SD) age of study participants was 7.4 (1.3) years at baseline, and most had mixed 
primary and permanent dentition. Table 1 presents baseline sociodemographic characteristics 
by category of the total cumulative received sealant/PRR by the end of the study.

During the 5-year follow-up, most children received sealants (87 percent) or PRRs (59 
percent), with 61 percent receiving both. Table 2 describes the sealant/PRR treatment levels 
received during the study among all subjects. At study entry, 39 (7.3 percent) children had 
sealants or PRRs in place (mean 4.3 surfaces); 37 of these 39 children had additional 
sealants or PRRs placed during the study. There were no significant differences in levels of 
sealant/PRR treatment by assigned restoration treatment group (composite or amalgam). As 
expected, there was an inverse correlation between sealant placement and restoration 
treatment; children with more sealants placed had fewer restorations during follow-up 
(Pearson correlation coefficient = −0.18, P<0.001). In contrast, PRR treatment levels were 
not correlated with restorative fillings (P=0.8).

There were no associations between sealant and/or PRR surface-years exposure and the 
primary outcomes of global behavior scores at the end of follow-up (Table 3). Results were 
similar in additional analyses (data not shown) examining primary and permanent teeth 
separately, posterior-occlusal surfaces, excluding children who received composite 
restorations, or excluding children with pre-existing sealants/PRRs. Analyses of scores for 
specific core syndromes (e.g., anxiety, depression, sensation seeking, interpersonal relations) 
showed similar results of no consistent associations with sealant or PRR exposure. We 
furthermore examined cut-points of clinically meaningful scores (normal, at-risk, or 
clinically significant) and found no consistent or significant associations with sealants/PRR. 
Lastly, there were no interactions between sealant/PRR exposure and age, study site, or 
gender.

Neuropsychological test scores over follow-up were not associated with tertile of sealant or 
PRR treatment levels (Table 4). Compared to children who ever received any sealants or 
PRRs, the minority of children receiving no sealants or PRRs during the study (<6 percent 
of children) had distinctly worse 5-year changes in WISC-III IQ (e.g., mean 1.7 point 
decrease vs. 2.2–3.5 point increase) and WIAT (e.g., mean 4.7 point decrease vs. 1.3–1.9 
point decrease), yet a smaller increase in errors on the executive function Wisconsin Card 
Sorting Test (e.g., mean total errors 3.8 vs. 17.2–17.8 increase). Thus, linear tests for trend 
including both non-exposed and exposed children were not appropriate. No statistically 
significant associations or trends were observed for test score changes among those with any 
sealant/PRR treatment. The sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.

During the 5-year study, the prevalence of children whose BMI-for-age category was 
overweight or obese increased for boys from 35 percent at baseline to 43 percent, and for 
girls from 32 percent at baseline to 47 percent. There were no significant associations 
between sealant/PRR exposure levels and changes in BMI or body fat percentage for girls or 
boys (Table 5). Among girls, menarche occurred slightly later with greater exposure to 
sealants/PRRs (age-adjusted hazard ratio=0.91, 95% CI 0.83, 1.01; P-value=0.08).

DISCUSSION

Page 7

This prospective cohort analysis of children’s exposure to flowable composites found no 
associations between dental sealant and PRR exposure levels and behavioral, 
neuropsychological, or physical development over 5-years follow-up. To our knowledge, this 
is the first analysis of these health outcomes in relation to dental sealant materials in 
children. Over eight million children in the U.S. have dental sealants, with sealants 
prevalence increasing across age, race, sex, and poverty level subgroups.44 Approximately 
10–25 percent of sealants have been shown to completely fail or have partial retention within 
2–3 years of placement, though sealant longevity depends on patient characteristics, sealant 
material type and placement techniques.2, 45–48 Laboratory studies have shown that 
monomers used in sealants are released during placement,49–53 and it is plausible that 
continued low amounts leach over time with chemical and mechanical interactions in the 
oral environment.7,54 These compounds have been shown to cause various cytotoxic, 
embryotoxic, genotoxic and endocrine effects over a range of concentrations in vitro and 
animal experiments.9–13, 55–57 Thus, a thorough evaluation and assessment of the long-term 
safety of these materials in standard use in preventive dentistry is important for dental and 
general public health.

We had previously shown associations of bisGMA-based dental composite with 
psychosocial health outcomes in the NECAT participants. In the current analysis of 
bisGMA-based sealants, most estimates, except for menarche,32 were in the opposite 
direction of estimates for composite.31, 33 Although this may be an artifact of the inverse 
correlation between composites and sealants, the correlation between sealants and composite 
was relatively small. It is possible that non-dental factors, such as residual confounding by 
unmeasured socioeconomic factors or oral health attitudes related to having sealant 
placement, contributed. However, without relevant biomarker data, it is difficult to explain 
the lack of similar findings between composite and sealant materials. That is, it is possible 
that the different results for the composite and the sealant were due to differences in material 
manufacturing, including the precise monomers and other components used, and/or the 
resulting integrity (i.e., degradation) of the materials once in the mouth and exposed to the 
oral environment. Flowable composites have higher resin content and in general, inferior 
mechanical properties, compared to standard hybrid composites.58 However, standard non-
flowable composites that are placed in bulk and undergo bulk polymerization could be 
subject to less complete curing,59 hence more exposure to resin monomers. Previous studies 
of leaching from dental material components have shown increased saliva levels of BPA and 
related compounds within a few hours after treatment, but the extent of leaching over time as 
materials degrade is unknown.23,27 If negligible leaching occurred after the initial exposure 
during placement, this might be a reason for the lack of association with the outcomes 
measured in this study. Thus, a limitation of NECAT for these secondary data analysis was 
that urinary concentrations of BPA, bisGMA, TEGDMA, HEMA, or other compounds that 
may leach from sealants were not measured. Biomarker data would help elucidate whether 
differences in results were due to differences in the internal dose of chemical exposures, or 
to artifacts of unknown or unmeasured factors associated with dental treatment. Additional 
studies that include biomarker measurement along with prospective longitudinal data on

dental treatment and health outcomes are needed for a comprehensive examination of the 
long-term safety of dental materials.

For this secondary data analysis, we combined data on two different materials used for 
sealants and PRRs, to evaluate total flowable composites exposure. Although both materials 
contain bisGMA, differences in mechanical properties could lead to differences in leaching 
of components. Considering that this study was not designed to investigate sealant materials, 
we conducted numerous sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings, e.g., 
excluding subgroups of children (those with pre-existing sealants, those not receiving any 
sealants) and examining strata of age, sex, or race; results consistently showed no 
associations with these psychosocial, neuropsychological, or growth outcomes. The minority 
of children who did not receive sealants had, on average, worse change compared to children 
who followed routine study procedures to receive any sealants. This difference may be due 
to the small sample size of children without sealants, or to unmeasured factors related to not 
receiving sealants. For that reason, we focused our interpretation of results on categories of 
sealant exposure, particularly among those ever treated (i.e., tertiles of exposure). Overall, 
these results showed no effects from sealants, and furthermore confirmed the caries 
prevention benefits of sealant placement.

While sealant level was not statistically significantly associated with age of menarche, the 
direction indicating later menarche was consistent with our previous findings for 
randomization to composite restoration treatment.32 In animal experiments, BPA alters 
reproductive development, often accelerating onset of puberty, but also causes altered 
reproductive parameters such as number of estrous cycles and days of estrus 60 and impaired 
follicle formation.61 Our analysis raises the question of possible effect on later age of 
menarche, but it is not sufficient to draw any conclusions. The menarche analyses were 
exploratory due to limitations in the sample (i.e., a subset of girls from one study site) and 
follow-up age window, in that not all girls had reached menarche within the five year study 
period. Furthermore, although children randomized to composite restorations had later 
menarche compared to those randomized to amalgam, there was no association between 
composite restoration treatment levels and age of menarche.32

Strengths of the study include that the data were obtained as part of a randomized clinical 
trial. The dental procedures, including materials used and placement procedures, and the 
treatment levels were strictly monitored for the trial. In addition, health assessments for the 
outcomes analyzed here were conducted using validated and routinely calibrated measures. 
This analysis was well-powered to detect associations between sealants and the health 
outcome measures. Given the eligibility criteria of two or more caries, the trial did not 
include a U.S. population-based representative sample of children; however, its focus on 
children in need of dental treatment resulted in a sample of children who represent the 
specific targets of sealant programs, i.e., children at high risk of caries.

In summary, this analysis does not provide evidence to alter current practice regarding dental 
sealants. It remains uncertain whether the association between composite restorations and 
adverse psychosocial outcomes was caused by higher long-term release of compounds from 
restorative composite compared to preventive sealants, by the particular combination of

between composite and amalgam treatment groups in the clinical trial. Future research 
should include biomarker measures along with treatment and longitudinal health outcomes 
data.

Conclusions

Based on the results of the secondary data analysis reported here, the following conclusions 
can be made from this study:

1. Cumulative treatment levels of bisGMA-containing dental sealants and PRRs were 

not associated with psychosocial health or behavior problems in children or 
adolescents after 5 year follow-up.

2. Cumulative treatment levels of bisGMA-containing dental sealants and PRRs were 
not associated with changes in neuropsychological test scores during the 5 year 
study.

3. Cumulative treatment levels of bisGMA-containing dental sealants and PRRs were 
not associated with changes in body composition or body mass index during the 5 
year study.

4. No evidence was provided to suggest alterations to standard procedures and 

materials used for preventive dental sealants or PRRs in children.

No statistically significant associations (P>0.05) between sealant/PRR exposure and neuropsychological test score changes among children in 
tertiles 1–3. Means are adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status (continuous score), geographic study region (urban or rural), baseline blood lead 
level, and composite restorations (surface-years).

No statistically significant associations (P>0.05) between sealant/PRR exposure and body mass or body fat changes. Table presents multivariable-
adjusted mean changes over follow-up. All models were adjusted for age and either baseline BMI z-score (for BMI models) or height and baseline 
body fat percentage (for body fat models). For boys, models additionally were adjusted for household income (<$20k, $20–40k, or >$40k) and 
race/ethnicity. For girls, models were additionally adjusted for daily servings of fruits and vegetables.
