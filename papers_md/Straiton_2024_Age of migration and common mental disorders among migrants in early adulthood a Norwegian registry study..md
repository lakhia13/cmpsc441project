Age of migration and common mental 
disorders among migrants in early adulthood: 
a Norwegian registry study

Abstract
Background  Younger age of migration is associated with higher risk of psychotic disorders but the relationship 
between age of migration and common mental disorders is less clear. This study investigates the association between 
age of migration and diagnosed common mental disorders among migrants living in Norway.

Methods  Using national Norwegian register data from 2008 to 2019, we compared the odds of a common mental 
disorder diagnosis in healthcare services during early adulthood among non-migrants, descendants and migrants 
with different ages of migration and lengths of stay. We also investigated differences in the relationship for different 
migrant groups and for men and women.

Results  Descendants and childhood migrants with ≥ 19 years in Norway had higher odds of common mental 
disorders than non-migrants, while those migrating during adolescence with ≥ 19 years in Norway had similar odds. 
Those migrating during emerging and early adulthood had lower odds. Overall among migrants, the relationship 
between age of migration and common mental disorders was more pronounced for migrants < 19 years in Norway 
than ≥ 19 years and for non-refugees compared with refugees, especially men.

Conclusions  Descendants and childhood migrants with long stays may have higher odds of common mental 
disorders due to the associated stress of growing up in a bicultural context compared with non-migrants. Age 
of migration has a negative association with diagnosed common mental disorders but much of this effect may 
attenuate over time. The effect appears weaker for refugees, and particularly refugee men, which may reflect higher 
levels of pre-migration trauma and stress associated with the asylum-seeking period for those arriving as adults. At 
the same time, migrants, especially those arriving as adults, experience barriers to care. This could also explain the 
particularly low odds of diagnosed common mental disorders among adult migrants, especially those with shorter 
stays.

Background
Migration  is  risk  factor  for  mental  disorder  [1,  2].  The 
risk  of  mental  disorder,  however,  varies  according  to  a 
number of migratory-associated factors including reason 
for  migration,  country  of  origin,  country  of  destination 
and length of stay [1–3]. Age of migration may also be an 
important factor. A systematic review and meta-analysis 
showed  that  the  increased  risk  of  psychotic  disorders 
among migrants pertained mostly to individuals migrat-
ing as minors [4]. Those migrating during early adulthood 
had a similar risk of psychotic disorders as non-migrants, 
while those migrating before age 18 had twice the risk.

The association between age of migration and common 
mental disorders (CMDs) such as depression and anxiety 
however, is less clear [5–8]. It could partly be dependent 
on the life-stage CMDs are studied. In the current study, 
we investigate the relationship between age of migration, 
length  of  stay  and  CMDs  diagnosed  in  healthcare  ser-
vices during early adulthood. Early adulthood appears to 
be an important period of risk for CMD onset (Kessler et 
al., 2007) and the prevalence is higher than in middle or 
late adulthood (Jacobi et al., 2015). Yet, most of the litera-
ture on age of migration and CMDs focuses on middle to 
late  adulthood  [9,  10]  or  adulthood  in  general  [5–8,  11, 
12].

Differences  in  findings  may  also  relate  to  the  study 
setting  or  country.  For  adulthood  in  general,  a  German 
study found no link between age of migration and men-
tal  health-related  quality  of  life  [7].  Researchers  from 
Sweden,  however,  found  that  among  migrants  of  work-
ing  age,  migrants  arriving  as  children  reported  a  lower 
risk  of  psychological  distress  than  migrants  arriving  as 
adults,  though  the  advantage  was  smaller  among  those 
with longer stays [5]. The authors argued that childhood 
migrants have more cultural exposure and opportunities 
for  integration  than  migrants  arriving  as  adults,  which 
may be positive for their mental health. Indeed, research 
shows that the younger the age of arrival, the higher the 
likelihood  an  individual  has  of  achieving  higher  educa-
tion,  employment  and  high  income  [13].  These  factors 
are  associated  with  better  mental  health  [14–16].  At 
the  same  time,  continued  exposure  to  socioeconomic 
inequalities over time appeared to attenuate any positive 
effect of lower age of migration on mental health [5].

A  negative  relationship  between  age  of  migration  and 
psychological  distress,  depressive  symptoms  and  diag-
nosed  CMDs  during  adulthood  has,  in  contrast,  been 
demonstrated  in  studies  from  the  USA  and  Canada  [6, 
8,  11,  12,  17].  There  are  several  explanations  for  why 
migrants  arriving  under  the  age  of  18  may  be  at  greater 
risk of CMDs during adulthood than those migrating as 
adults. Firstly, childhood and adolescence are considered 
sensitive  developmental  periods.  Experiencing  major 
stressors such as those associated with migration during 

these life phases can set the base for later negative health 
outcomes [18–20]. Children and adolescents are develop-
ing  their  independence,  identity  and  finding  their  place 
within social groups. Uprooting during these periods can 
be  particularly  challenging.  Difficulties  in  consolidating 
one’s  identity  can  manifest  in  mental  health  problems 
during early adulthood [21].

Second,  it  is  possible  that  the  increased  risk  of  CMDs 
is not due to the experience of migration itself, but rather 
related to the multiple interacting processes in the social, 
cultural  and  ecological  context  in  which  a  child  with  a 
migrant  background  grows  and  develops  [22].  Accul-
turation is an especially important process related to the 
social, emotional and cognitive development of children 
growing  up  in  bi-  and  multicultural  contexts  [23].  The 
child’s sense of belonging to both their culture of origin 
and the dominant culture can lead to acculturative stress 
[24,  25].  Young  migrants  and  descendants  of  migrants 
are also met with multiple disadvantages, such as grow-
ing  up  in  low  income  households  [26],  social  exclusion, 
discrimination  and  racism  across  the  life  course  [27]. 
Being  exposed  to  discrimination  and  social  exclusion 
from  a  young  age  can  also  have  an  impact  on  future-
mental  health  [28].  Beginning  during  a  sensitive  period 
and cumulating over time, these chronic stressors could 
result  in  an  increased  risk  of  CMDs  during  early  adult-
hood  compared  with  their  non-migrant  counterparts 
and migrants arriving as adults. Similarly, adolescents are 
working  on  consolidating  their  identity  and  exposure  to 
discrimination  and  social  exclusion  can  undermine  this 
process, leading to increased risk of mental health prob-
lems [29].

A  third  argument  for  why  a  younger  age  of  migration 
may  increase  the  risk  of  CMDs  relates  to  the  healthy 
migrant effect. Those who choose to migrate are mostly 
young, have a higher level of education and better health 
status than non-migrants [30]. It is adults, and not chil-
dren, who tend to drive migration, and the future health 
of a young child may not be a consideration for a healthy 
parent. Thus, we might expect migrants arriving as adults 
to  have  a  lower  risk  of  CMDs  in  early  adulthood  than 
migrants  arriving  as  children.  Further,  giving  the  health 
migrant hypothesis, migrants arriving as adults might be 
less  likely  to  experience  CMDs  than  their  non-migrant 
counterparts,  while  migrants  arriving  as  children  could 
have a similar risk.

However,  research  also  suggests  that  the  healthy 
migrant effect tends to diminish over time [31]. Migrants 
can experience many stress factors such as financial hard-
ship and other socioeconomic inequalities, language dif-
ficulties, difficulties in understanding and navigating the 
society, discrimination and social exclusion [32, 33]. This 
cumulative  stress  may  increase  the  risk  of  CMDs  over 
time, also for adults. Thus, it is possible that any mental 

Straiton et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2024) 24:521 Page 3 of 16

health  advantage  which  migrants  arriving  as  adults  may 
experience  compared  to  migrants  arriving  as  children 
could diminish over time.

Yet, there is limited evidence of a healthy migrant effect 
when it comes to mental health [33], especially in Europe. 
It may also be dependent on country of origin and reason 
for  migration  [34,  35].  Although  international  refugees 
must  be  in  good  enough  health  to  manage  a  long,  and 
often difficult, journey, (adult) refugees have not chosen 
to  migrate  to  the  same  extent  and  may  therefore  not  be 
in  as  good  health  as  other  groups  of  (adult)  migrants. 
Further,  preparedness  for  migration  may  be  impor-
tant  for  future  mental  health  in  the  settlement  country 
[36].  Adults  are  likely  to  be  more  prepared  for  moving 
than  children  are.  Due  to  the  forced  nature  of  migra-
tion  for  refugees,  adult  refugees  may  plan  their  migra-
tion  and  settlement  to  a  lesser  extent  than  non-refugee 
adult  migrants,  while  refugee  and  non-refugee  children 
may  have  similar  levels  of  preparedness.  Thus,  if  there 
is  a  negative  relationship  between  age  of  migration  and 
CMDs as a result of the healthy migrant effect, it could be 
weaker for refugees compared with non-refugees.

A  final  aspect  to  consider  is  the  intersection  between 
age  of  migration,  gender  and  migrant  group.  Boys  and 
girls  may  experience  differences  in  socialisation,  includ-
ing  family  and  peer  relationships,  and  differences  in 
exposure  and  responses  to  stress  and  social  adversities 
(e.g.,  discrimination)  [27,  37].  Girls,  for  instance,  tend 
to  experience  more  parental  control  and  restrictions  on 
their activities outside of the home [38], especially among 
those from lower income countries [37]. Limited freedom 
or negative social control is associated with poorer men-
tal  health  [39].  US  researchers  found  that  Latinas  who 
migrated  during  childhood  were  at  higher  risk  of  sui-
cidal  ideation  than  Latinos  migrating  during  adulthood, 
while there was no difference for men and women among 
those  migrating  during  adulthood  [40].  They  argued 
that  Latina  childhood  migrants  experience  more  gender 
oppression  and  family  conflict  than  childhood  Latino 
migrants,  resulting  in  poorer  mental  health.  In  contrast 
to  migrant  girls,  migrant  women  from  countries  with 
more  conservative  values  will  have  already  consolidated 
their identity prior to arrival, be more likely to have social 
ties with people from a similar background and may feel 
less pressure to conform to the expectations in the domi-
nant  society.  Thus,  they  may  experience  lower  levels  of 
cultural  conflict.  As  such,  difference  in  CMDs  between 
men and women among migrants from countries where 
gender differences in socialisation are greater (e.g. some 
countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), 
USA,  Canada,  Australia  and  New  Zealand),  could  be 
larger  for  those  arriving  during  childhood  compared  to 
those arriving during emerging or late adulthood.

In summary, there are several aspects of the association 
between age of migration and CMDs that still need to be 
investigated.  European  research  is  limited  and  contra-
dicts  literature  from  North  America.  This  could  be  due 
to  the  different  country  contexts  and  migration  policies 
(e.g.  more  selective  migration  in  North  America)  or  the 
dominant  migrant  groups  in  different  countries.  To  our 
knowledge there are no Norwegian studies on this topic. 
Differences could also be due to the study design or qual-
ity  of  the  data.  Outcome  measures  in  studies  vary  from 
self-reported  psychological  distress  to  depression  diag-
noses  measured  through  diagnostic  interviews.  Most 
studies,  however,  rely  on  cross-sectional,  self-reported 
data, which are subject to both selection and recall bias. 
Further,  few  studies  consider  whether  migrants  are  at 
differential  risk  to  individuals  without  a  migrant  back-
ground, depending on the age of migration [5, 7].

Current study
The main aim of this study is to investigate the relation-
ship  between  age  of  migration  and  common  mental 
disorders  (CMDs)  diagnosed  in  mental  health  services 
during  early  adulthood  (25–39  years).  We  include  non-
migrants  as  a  comparison  group  to  determine  the  dif-
ference  in  odds  of  CMDs  between  non-migrants  and 
migrants  who  arrived  in  Norway  during  different  life 
phases  (early  childhood,  late  childhood,  adolescence, 
emerging adulthood and early adulthood) and who have 
different  lengths  of  stay.  Descendants  are  similar  to 
migrants arriving during early childhood in particular, in 
that they grow up in a bicultural or multicultural context, 
are  educated  in  the  dominant  country,  can  experience 
discrimination from a young age and more often grow up 
in low income families [23, 26, 27]. We therefore include 
descendants  of  migrants  as  a  comparison  group.  Fur-
ther, we also aim to investigate whether the relationship 
between  age  of  migration  and  CMDs  varies  by  migrant 
group  and  whether  the  relationship  within  different 
migrant groups is different for men and women.

Method
Data sources

Demographic  information  from  the  Central  Population 
Registry and Statistics Norway was linked at an individ-
ual level, through a non-identifiable version of a personal 
identification  number,  to  diagnosis  information  from 
the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR) and The National 
Database  for  the  Reimbursement  of  Health  Expenses 
(KUHR).  All  Norwegian-born  individuals  and  regis-
tered residents with at least six months of residence are 
assigned  this  personal  number.  NPR  contains  diagnosis 
information on all individuals who have had treatment in 
specialist services, while KUHR contains information on 
all  patient  contacts  in  primary  care,  as  well  as  specialist 

Straiton et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2024) 24:521 Page 4 of 16

practitioners  who  are  contracted  by  the  municipality. 
Only  primary  care  contacts  were  extracted  from  KUHR 
for  the  purposes  of  this  study.  Data  was  linked  for  the 
years 2008–2019.

Ethical  approval  for  this  study  was  granted  by  the 
Regional  Committee  for  Medical  and  Health  Research 
Ethics,  Southeast  Norway  (REK  2019/321)  and  all  reg-
istry  owners  approved  the  use  of  their  data.  Consent  to 
participate was not required since this study uses already 
existing administrative data.

We also combined migrant status and age of migration/
length of stay in part one of the analyses to allow compar-
isons  between  non-migrants,  descendants  and  migrants 
with different ages at migration and lengths of stay: Non-
migrant, descendant, early childhood migrant, late child-
hood migrant (< 19 years), late childhood migrant ((≥ 19 
years),  adolescence  migrant  (< 19  years),  adolescence 
migrant (≥ 19 years), emerging adulthood migrant ((< 19 
years),  emerging  adulthood  migrant  (≥ 19  years),  early 
adulthood migrant.

Study population

Sex: man / woman

We  used  a  dynamic study design, including  all  migrants 
(foreign  born  with  two  foreign-born  parents),  descen-
dants  (Norwegian  born  with  two  foreign-born  parents), 
and  non-migrants  (Norwegian  born  with  two  Norwe-
gian-born  parents)  who  were  aged  25–39  years  and  liv-
ing  in  Norway  at  some  point  between  2008  and  2019. 
Individuals  were  followed  from  the  year  they  turned  25 
or  the  year  they  migrated  to  Norway  (whichever  came 
first)  until  the  first  CMD  diagnosis  during  the  study 
period or were censored upon death, emigration or turn-
ing  40  years  old  (whichever  came  first).  The  final  study 
population included 1,936,039 individuals and 10,404,580 
observations.

Variables

Outcome: Common mental health disorder (CMD) (yes/
no).  Diagnosis  information  was  extracted  from  KUHR 
for primary care and NPR for secondary care on a yearly 
basis.  Individuals  were  coded  as  having  a  CMD  if  they 
had  been  diagnosed  with  anxiety  or  depression  either 
in primary care (ICPC-2 codes: P01, P03, P74, P76, P81) 
or in secondary care (ICD-10 codes: F32, F33, F40, F41, 
F42).  All  other  individuals  were  coded  as  not  having  a 
CMD.

Exposures
Migrant status: migrants, descendants, and non-migrants

Age  of  migration/length  of  stay  (time-varying):  We 
grouped age of migration to represent different develop-
mental  periods  as  follows:  0–6  years  (early  childhood), 
7–12  years  (late  childhood),  13–17  years  (adolescence), 
18–24  years  (emerging  adulthood)  and  25 + years  (early 
adulthood).  Since  all  those  moving  in  early  childhood 
had a minimum of 19 years length of stay (25 (the young-
est  age  in  the  dataset)  − 6  (the  maximum  age  of  migra-
tion) = 19), we divided the other age of migration groups 
as  having  less  than  19  years  or  19  years  or  more  years 
in  Norway.  Those  moving  in  early  adulthood,  however, 
could  only  have  a  maximum  of  14  years  in  Norway  (39 
(the  oldest  age  in  the  dataset)  − 25  (the  youngest  age  of 
migration) = 14).  Thus,  this  group  was  not  divided  by 
length of stay.

Migrant group: We grouped migrants based on their rea-
son for migration and country of origin. Individuals who 
had come to Norway for protection or family members of 
individuals who had come to Norway for protection were 
grouped together as “refugees”. We divided the remaining 
migrants  without  refugee  background  into  two  groups: 
those  from  EEA  countries,  USA,  Canada,  Australia  and 
New  Zealand  (shortened  to  EEA + migrants)  and  those 
from  outside  of  the  EEA,  USA,  Canada,  Australia  and 
New Zealand (non-EEA + migrants). See Additional file 1 
for a classification of the main countries in each category.

Covariates

Marital  status  (time  varying):  Married,  never  married, 
previously married/widowed.

Education  level  (time-varying):  <=  compulsory  educa-
tion,  upper  secondary,  lower  college/university  educa-
tion, upper college/university education.

Low-income  (time  varying):  (Yes/No)  This  was  based 
on  total  personal  income  of  individuals  in  the  dataset 
(from  employment/business  income  and  taxable  and 
tax-free  benefits  or  other  transfers).  In  accordance  with 
the  European  Union’s  (EU)  definition  for  low  income, 
we defined low income as lower than 60% of the median 
income per year [41].

Missing data

Education  level:  educational  attainment  was  missing  for 
5.9%  observations.  Around  16%  of  individuals  with  at 
least  one  missing  observation  had  a  recorded  education 
later in the dataset. We replaced missing education level 
in  previous  years  with  the  education  level  in  the  next 
available  year.  This  left  8.1%  of  individuals  consistently 
missing  educational  attainment,  92.8%  were  migrants. 
Almost 25% of migrants had missing educational attain-
ment. Rather than attempting imputation on, or exclud-
ing, such a large percentage, we coded them as having an 
unknown education level.

Low  income:  Income  was  missing  for  around  2.9% 
of  observations.  Around  44%  occurred  in  the  last  year 
a  person  was  in  the  study.  We  replaced  missing  values 
with  values  from  the  previous  year  in  the  study.  Other 

Straiton et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2024) 24:521 Page 5 of 16

individuals  were  missing  the  first  year(s)  in  the  study 
but not later years. We imputed these values with values 
from the first available year. This left 1.8% of individuals 
consistently missing income. We coded them as not hav-
ing a low income, the most common value.

Migrant  group:  Around  10.5%  of  migrants  were  miss-
ing  a  reason  for  migration.  Reason  for  migration  has 
typically  not  been  recorded  for  migrants  from  Nor-
dic  countries  and  more  recently,  not  been  a  reporting 
requirement  for  EEA  migrants.  It  has  also  only  been 
recorded  for  migrants  arriving  in  Norway  from  1990 
onwards. Migrants arriving before 1990 (3.1%) do, there-
fore,  not  have  an  official  reason  for  migration.  Most  of 
these  migrants  were  children  or  adolescents  at  time  of 
migration. To retain a sizeable number of migrants arriv-
ing  during  childhood,  we  imputed  reason  for  migration 
based  on  country  of  origin.  We  only  did  this  if  we  were 
confident  that  most  individuals  from  a  particular  coun-
try  were  likely  or  unlikely  to  have  needed  protection. 
See Additional file 2 for a detailed description of migra-
tion  countries  (and  time  points)  that  we  imputed.  This 
resulted in an additional 8.1% of migrants being assigned 
a migrant group.

Statistical analyses

We  divided  and  described  the  study  population  by 
migrant  category  and  age  of  migration  in  the  descrip-
tive  analyses.  We  conducted  chi-square  analyses/one-
way  ANOVAs  to  determine  if  there  were  significant 
differences  across  the  different  groups  on  each  variable. 
In  part  one  of  the  analyses,  we  conducted  discrete  time 
logistic regression analyses to investigate the relationship 
between  age  of  migration  and  CMDs,  comparing  with 
non-migrants and descendants. We adjusted for age and 
age  squared  first,  followed  by  sex  and  marital  status  in 
the second model, and education level and income in the 
final model.

In part two of the analyses, we only included migrants. 
Early  adulthood  migrants  and  refugees  were  set  as  the 
reference  categories  for  age  of  migration/length  of  stay 
and  migrant  group  respectively.  We  ran  discrete  time 
logistic  regression  analyses,  first  while  adjusting  for  all 
covariates, then with an interaction term between age of 
migration/length  of  stay  and  migrant  group.  Finally,  we 
ran a fully adjusted, full-factorial model with a three-way 
interaction  between  age  of  migration/length  of  stay,  sex 
and migrant group. To visualise and describe the signifi-
cant interactions, we ran predictive marginal analyses for 
all  levels  of  the  interactions  of  interest  with  other  vari-
ables set to their means and plotted the predictive mar-
ginal probabilities.

We  also  conducted  robustness  analyses.  First,  we 
excluded individuals who were always missing education 
level. Then, for analyses with migrants only (part two), we 

excluded migrants whose reason for migration had been 
imputed.

Results
Around  30%  of  the  study  population  was  made  up  of 
migrants. Only 1.3% were descendants. Table 1 shows the 
characteristics  of  the  study  population  for  the  last  year 
of  study  inclusion  by  migrant  status  and  age  of  migra-
tion.  Overall,  only  around  13%  of  migrants  had  a  CMD 
diagnosis  compared  with  24%  of  non-migrants  and  25% 
of  descendants.  Having  a  CMD  was  inversely  related  to 
age  of  migration,  with  27%  of  migrants  arriving  during 
early  and  late  childhood  having  had  a  CMD  diagnosis 
compared with only 9% of migrants arriving during early 
adulthood.

Age of migration/length of stay and CMDs

Table  2  shows  the  results  of  the  discrete  time  logistic 
regression  analyses.  In  the  unadjusted  model  (model  1), 
descendants and migrants arriving as children regardless 
of length of stay had significantly higher yearly odds of a 
CMD than non-migrants. Adolescent migrants with ≥ 19 
years  in  Norway  also  had  higher  odds,  while  those  with 
< 19  years  had  lower  odds  than  non-migrants.  Migrants 
who moved both during emerging or early adulthood and 
had  been  in  Norway < 19  years  had  far  lower  odds  of  a 
CMD than non-migrants. Emerging adulthood migrants 
with  ≥ 19  years  in  Norway  had  similar  yearly  odds.  The 
yearly  odds  of  a  CMD  were  highest  for  late  childhood 
migrants  and  lowest  among  early  adulthood  migrants. 
Within  each  age  of  migration  category,  migrants  with 
longer stays had higher odds of a CMD than those with 
shorter  stays.  A  similar  pattern  was  seen  after  adjust-
ing  for  sex  and  marital  status  (model  2).  In  the  fully 
adjusted  model  (model  3),  descendants  and  early  child-
hood  migrants  had  slightly,  but  still  significantly,  higher 
yearly  odds  of  a  CMD  than  their  non-migrant  counter-
parts  (8%  and  11%  respectively).  Migrants  arriving  dur-
ing  late  childhood  had  around  12%  higher  yearly  odds 
of  a  CMD  if  they  had ≥ 19  years  in  Norway,  while  those 
with  < 19  years  had  around  10%  lower  odds.  Adoles-
cent migrants with < 19 years in Norway had lower odds 
while  those  with  ≥ 19  years  in  Norway  had  similar  odds 
to non-migrants. Migrants moving during both stages of 
adulthood  had  significantly  lower  odds  of  a  CMD  than 
non-migrants, regardless of length of stay.

Age of migration and CMDs by migrant group and sex

By  the  last  year  of  study  inclusion,  CMDs  were  more 
common  among  refugees  (19.8%)  than  EEA  (9.8%)  and 
non-EEA  migrants  (11.3%).  In  a  discrete-time  logis-
tic  regression  analyses  with  EEA  migrants  at  baseline, 
the  differences  between  EEA  and  non-EEA  migrants 
were  still  significant  after  adjusting  for  sex,  marital

status,  education  level  and  low  income  (OR = 1.14,  95% 
CI:  (1.11–1.17)),  as  were  the  differences  between  EEA 
and  refugee  migrants  (OR = 2.02,  95%  CI:  (1.97–2.07)). 
Thus, our two non-refugee groups were not combined in 
analyses with migrants only.

Table 3, model 1 shows the main effects of age of migra-
tion/length  of  stay,  migrant  group  and  sex,  after  adjust-
ing  for  marital  status,  education  level  and  low  income. 
Compared with those migrating during early adulthood, 
all  migrants  arriving  during  an  earlier  stage  had  higher 
yearly odds of CMDs. Odds were highest for those mov-
ing during late childhood with less than 19 years in Nor-
way.  The  odds  generally  decreased  with  increasing  age 
of  migration.  Women  had  more  than  double  the  yearly 
odds of a CMD compared with men. Both groups of non-
refugees had lower yearly odds of a CMD than refugees. 
We  plotted  average  marginal  predicted  probabilities  for 
CMDs by age of migration (Fig. 1). To visualise whether 
the relationship between age of migration and CMDs was 
the  same  regardless  of  length  of  stay,  we  plotted  those 
with  < 19  years  in  Norway  separately  from  those  with 
≥ 19  years  in  Norway. The  figure  shows  that  the  there  is 
a  clear  negative  relationship  between  age  of  migration 
and  CMDs  among  migrants  with  < 19  years  in  Norway. 
For those with ≥ 19 years in Norway, the relationship was 
weak,  though  the  probability  of  CMDs  was  still  slightly 

higher among those moving in childhood than in adoles-
cence or emerging adulthood. Notably, the probability of 
CMDs  was  higher  among  those  with  ≥ 19  years  in  Nor-
way than those with < 19 years for those arriving during 
emerging adulthood, but lower for migrants arriving dur-
ing late childhood. There was no difference in predicted 
probabilities of CMDs by length of stay for the adolescent 
group.

In  model  2,  we  investigated  the  interaction  between 
age  of  migration/length  of  stay  and  migrant  group.  The 
addition of the interaction terms improved the fit of the 
model  (χ2(14) = 265.82,  p < 0.001).  All  interaction  terms 
were significant. The higher odds ratio for each indicates 
that  the  relationship  between  age  of  migration/length 
of  stay  and  CMDs  is  stronger  for  both  the  non-refugee 
groups  compared  with  refugees.  We  plotted  average 
marginal  predicted  probabilities  (expressed  as  percent-
age)  for  all  levels  of  the  interaction  (Fig.  2),  again  with 
separate plots for illustrative purposes for those with < 19 
and  ≥ 19  years  in  Norway.  For  migrants  with  ≥ 19  years 
in  Norway,  there  was  no  clear  association  between  age 
of  migration  and  CMDs,  regardless  of  migrant  group. 
For  those  with  < 19  years  in  Norway,  there  was  a  nega-
tive  association  between  age  of  migration  and  CMDs. 
The relationship appeared, however, to peter out for refu-
gees, with little difference between those arriving during

emerging  or  early  adulthood.  The  higher  probability  of 
CMDs for refugees compared with the two other groups 
was  not  apparent  during  late  childhood  but  appeared 
with increasing age of migration. However, the probably 
of a CMD within each age of migration category did not 
differ considerably by length of stay, with the exception of 
those  those  arriving  during  emerging  adulthood,  where 
longer stays were associated with higher probability. The 
figure also shows that except for in early childhood, there 
was  no  significant  difference  in  average  predicted  prob-
ability of a CMD for EEA + and non-EEA + migrants.

In  model  3,  we  included  an  interaction  term  between 
age  of  migration  and  sex.  Compared  with  the  fully 
adjusted  model  with  no  interaction,  the  addition  of  the 
interaction  improved  the  fit  of  the  model  (χ2(7) = 26,1, 
p < 0,001).  There  were  significant  interactions  for  ado-
lescence  and  emerging  adulthood,  suggesting  that  the 
differences  in  odds  of  a  CMD  between  adolescence  and 
emerging  adulthood  compared  with  early  adulthood 
were  greater  for  women  than  for  men.  Plotting  average 
marginal  predicted  probabilities  confirmed  this  (Fig.  3). 
Additionally,  the  figure  shows  that  age  of  migration  has 
a negative relationship with CMDs for women with ≥ 19

years  in  Norway,  while  there  is  no  association  for  men. 
For migrants with < 19 years in Norway, there is a nega-
tive association for both men and women, but it appears 
slightly stronger for women.

Finally,  in  model  4,  we  investigated  whether  the  inter-
action between age of migration and sex was dependent 
on  migrant  group.  Compared  with  model  2,  the  addi-
tion  of  the  interaction  term  again  improved  the  fit  of 
the  model  (χ2(x) = 1025.69,  p < 0.001).  There  were  five 
significant  interaction  terms  in  the  three-way  interac-
tion,  all  pertaining  to  EEA + migrants.  The  odds  ratios 
indicate  that  the  sex  difference  in  yearly  odds  between 
early  and  late  childhood  and  adolescent  migrants  dif-
fers  for  EEA + migrants  compared  with  refugees.  This 
appeared  to  be  the  case  for  both  those  with  < 19  years 
and  ≥ 19  years  in  Norway.  To  visualise  this  three-way 
interaction,  together  with  the  two-way  interactions,  we 
calculated  and  plotted  adjusted  average  predicted  mar-
ginal  probabilities  (expressed  as  percentage)  for  CMDs 
for  the  different  migrant  groups  and  ages  of  migration/
length of stay for both men and women (Fig. 4). Among 
refugees  and  non-EEA + migrants,  the  sex  difference  in 
CMDs  appears  larger  among  those  migrating  as  chil-
dren  and  adolescents  than  those  migrating  as  adults. 
This was regardless of length of stay. Thus,  the relation-
ship between age of migration and CMDs appears stron-
ger  for  non-EEA + migrant  women  and  refugee  women 
compared  with  men.  For  EEA + migrants,  however,  the 
pattern  is  similar  for  both  men  and  women,  with  only 
a  slight  narrowing  of  the  sex  gap  in  CMDs  from  child-
hood  through  to  adulthood.  When  looking  at  differ-
ences  across  groups  within  each  sex,  the  differences  in 
predicted  probability  of  CMDs  among  those  with  < 19 
years  in  Norway  becomes  larger  for  refugee  men  com-
pared  with  EEA + men  with  increasing  age  of  migration. 
Women,  in  contrast,  differ  only  among  those  arriving 
during early adulthood. Among those with  ≥19 years in 
Norway,  the  differences  across  groups  are  most  appar-
ent  among  those  arriving  during  early  childhood,  with 
both EEA + men and women having lower probability of 
a CMD compared to the other migrant groups.

Robustness analyses

When  we  excluded  individuals  with  missing  education 
level (Additional file 3, Tables 1 and 2) descendants, early 
childhood and late childhood migrants with ≥ 19 years in 
Norway had higher yearly odds of a CMD compared with 
non-migrants  as  in  the  main  analyses.  All  other  groups 
had lower or the same yearly odds. This differed slightly 
from the main analyses where those moving in late child-
hood  with  < 19  years  and  adolescent  migrants  with  ≥ 19 
years  also  had  higher  odds.  In  analyses  with  migrants 
only, all the same interaction terms were still significant, 
with only two exceptions.

When we excluded migrants with an imputed migrant 
group (8.1%), the findings were similar to the main analy-
ses (Additional file 4). The yearly odds of CMDs decreased 
with increasing age. In model 1, those who moved during 
emerging adulthood who had been in Norway ≥ 19 years 
had lower odds, in contrast to in the main analysis where 
they had higher odds. In model 2, the interaction terms 
were  still  significant,  indicating  a  weaker  relationship 
between  age  of  migration  and  CMDs  for  refugees  com-
pared with the other two groups. However, the difference 
in  yearly  odds  of  a  CMD  between  those  migrating  dur-
ing early childhood and early adulthood appeared stron-
gest  for  EEA + migrants  (EEA+*childhood),  while  in  the 
main  analyses  it  was  strongest  for  non-EEA + migrants 
compared  with  refugees.  In  model  3,  the  interaction 
term  women*adolescence < 19  years  was  only  border-
line significant. Finally, in model 4, the same interaction 
terms  were  significant  as  in  the  main  analyses,  though 
again,  the  effect  size  of  childhood  and  adolescence  for 
EEA + migrants  appeared  stronger.  This  may  be  due  to 
the  large  percentage  of  EEA + migrants  (mainly  from 
Nordic countries) being excluded here compared with in 
the main analysis. The three-way interaction was consis-
tent with the findings in the main analyses.

Overall, the robustness analyses generally confirm our 

confidence in the findings of the imputed data.

Discussion
In  this  study,  we  investigated  differences  in  yearly  odds 
of diagnosed CMDs during early adulthood based on age 
of migration. Our findings show a general negative asso-
ciation between age of migration and length of stay, but 
that the effect appears to be weaker among migrants with 
long stays. This differs from findings on psychotic disor-
ders, where the negative relationship with age of migra-
tion  does  not  appear  to  attenuate  with  longer  duration 
[42,  43].  It  is  possible  that  increased  exposure  to  socio-
economic  inequalities,  discrimination  and  other  long-
term  migratory  related  stressors  increases  the  risk  of 
CMDs over time, also for migrants arriving during adult-
hood. Indeed, we found that the probability of a CMD is 
greater for migrants arriving during emerging adulthood 
with 19 or more years in Norway than for those with less 
than 19 years in Norway (Fig. 1).

Importantly,  not  only  did  migrants  arriving  during 
early  childhood  or  late  childhood  with  more  than  19 
years in Norway have slightly higher odds of CMDs than 
non-migrants but descendants did too. Thus, it may not 
be the experience of migration itself which increases the 
risk of CMDs in early adulthood for childhood migrants 
relative  to  non-migrants,  but  rather  the  experience  of 
growing  up  with  a  migrant  background  and  the  chal-
lenges it entails. Multiple socio-economic disadvantages, 
discrimination  and  acculturative  stress  experienced

during  a  sensitive  period  and  cumulating  over  time  can 
contribute to poorer future mental health [23, 27–29].

Our findings are in contrast to the Swedish study which 
found  that  migrants  arriving  during  childhood  reported 
better mental health than migrants arriving during adult-
hood  [5],  though  similarly,  the  effect  decreased  with 
increasing  length  of  stay.  The  Swedish  study  was  col-
lected at one point in time and based on self-report data, 
which may be subject to both recall and selection bias. In 
the current register study, we were able to follow individ-
uals for up to 12 years and had national coverage, mean-
ing  there  was  no  selection  or  recall  bias.  Honkaniemi 
and  colleagues  focused  on  psychological  distress,  while 
our  measure  of  CMDs  was  defined  as  a  diagnosis  set  in 
healthcare services. As such, to be identified as having a 
CMD, migrants need to have used primary or secondary 
healthcare services. Migrants can experience  major bar-
riers to care including language barriers, stigma, feelings 
of  mistrust  for  healthcare  providers  and  difficulties  in 
navigating  the  system  [44–48].  Thus,  we  are  unlikely  to 
have detected all CMDs in our study.

Barriers, and lower levels of accessing care, could there-
fore  also  explain  the  relationship  between  age  of  migra-
tion and diagnosed CMDs. Both migrants arriving during 
childhood  and  descendants  are  likely  to  be  fluent  in  the 
receiving country’s language and have experience in using 
the healthcare system. Language proficiency is associated 
with help-seeking [49]. Further, some childhood migrants 
and  descendants,  depending  on  migrant  background, 
may also have grown up in a context (through school and 
social networks) with more openness around mental dis-
order than what migrants arriving as adults have experi-
enced. This may increase help-seeking [45]. Theoretically 
then, the barriers for accessing mental health care should 
be  lower  for  migrants  arriving  as  children  (and  descen-
dants)  than  for  migrants  arriving  as  adults.  This  may 
particularly  be  the  case  for  migrants  from  countries 
where stigma surrounding mental disorder is high. Thus, 
our  finding  that  the  odds  of  diagnosed  CMDs  decrease 
with  increasing  age  of  migration  may  reflect  childhood 
migrants’  greater  propensity  to  seek  help  when  experi-
encing  CMD  symptoms,  rather  than  their  actual  mental 
health  status.  In  other  words,  the  under  identification 
of  CMDs  may  be  greater  among  migrants  arriving  as 
adults than as children. Further, these barriers are likely 
to be greatest among migrants with shorter stays and, for 
many,  they  will  reduce  overtime  as  familiarity  with  the 
health  system  and  language  proficiency  increases.  Thus, 
improved access to care, rather than a decline in mental 
health, over time, could be an alternative explanation for 
why  migrants  arriving  during  emerging  adulthood  with 
19  or  more  years  in  Norway  had  a  higher  probability  of 
CMDs than those with less than 19 years.

We also investigated whether the relationship between 
age  of  migration  and  CMDs  differed  for  across  migrant 
groups. For migrants with less than 19 years in Norway, 
the  negative  association  between  age  of  migration  and 
CMDs  appeared  slightly  weaker  among  refugees,  since 
the difference in probability between refugees and other 
groups  increased  with  increasing  age  of  migration.  This 
could be due to an overall weaker healthy migrant effect 
for refugees due to the lower level of voluntary migration 
as  well  as  the  increased  risk  of  traumatic  experiences. 
Moreover,  we  also  saw  this  weaker  association  between 
age of migration and CMDs among refugees was particu-
larly the case for men. Men may often report higher lev-
els  of  traumatic  experiences  [50]  and  are  more  likely  to 
arrive  as  asylum-seekers,  while  women  may  more  often 
follow  though  family  reunification.  Thus,  refugee  men 
may be less prepared for migration and more often face 
an  uncertain  future.  Experiencing  a  prolonged  asylum 
process  is  also  associated  with  increased  risk  of  CMDs 
[51]. With the exception of unaccompanied minors, it is 
possible  that  adults,  particularly  men,  experience  more 
stress  related  to  the  asylum  process  than  any  children 
travelling  with  them,  which  would  further  heighten  the 
risk of CMDs among those arriving as adults.

Among  migrants  living  in  Norway  for  19  years  or 
more,  however,  the  probability  of  a  CMD  diagnosis  was 
similar  for  all  three  groups  at  different  ages  of  migra-
tion,  with  the  exception  of  EEA + migrants  arriving  dur-
ing  early  childhood.  This  group  had  a  lower  probability 
compared with the other two groups. This lower level of 
CMDs among EEA + migrants arriving during early child-
hood  applied  to  both  men  and  women  in  the  three-way 
interaction  analyses  (Fig.  4).  Previous  research  suggests 
that  migrants  arriving  at  a  younger  age  tend  fare  better 
in  terms  of  educational  attainment  and  labour  market 
participation  [13],  and  that  these  factors  are  protective 
of  CMDs  [14,  15].  Yet,  childhood  migrants  can  experi-
ence  more  cultural  conflict  and  discrimination  which 
can instead increase the risk of CMDs. Given the closer 
cultural  ties  to  Norway  in  many  EEA + countries,  it  is 
possible  that  this  group  of  childhood  migrants  experi-
ence lower levels of cultural conflict as well as lower lev-
els of discrimination due to being a less visible group of 
migrants. Thus,  future  research  should  investigate  if  the 
mental  health  benefits  of  any  socioeconomic  advantage 
that  childhood  migrants  may  experience  is  mitigated  by 
acculturative stress or experiences of discrimination.

Among  those  with  less  than  19  years  in  Norway, 
there  was  little  difference  in  the  relationship  between 
age  of  migration  and  CMDs  for  men  and  women  from 
EEA + countries.  In  contrast,  the  difference  in  predicted 
probability of CMDs appeared to narrow with increasing 
age  of  migration  for  refugees  and  non-EEA + migrants. 
One  explanation  for  this  is  that  girls  with  parents  from 

Straiton et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2024) 24:521 Page 13 of 16

some  countries  outside  of  the  EU,  USA,  Canada,  Aus-
tralia  and  New  Zealand,  may  experience  less  freedom 
than  boys,  greater  levels  of  acculturative  stress  due  to 
conflicting  gender  norms  and  more  negative  social  con-
trol [37–39]. This may have an impact on young migrant 
women’s  mental  health  during  early  adulthood.  Yet,  a 
closer  look  across  the  different  migrant  groups  suggests 
that refugee and non-EEA + women migrating as girls did 
not  have  an  increased  probability  of  CMDs  relative  to 
their  EEA + counterparts  (except  for  in  early  childhood 
as  previously  discussed).  There  was  only  a  significant 
difference  in  probability  for  those  migrating  as  adults. 
Further,  the  difference  in  probability  across  the  migrant 
groups appears to increase with increasing age of migra-
tion for men more than for women, and particularly refu-
gee men. Men in these two groups may often come from 
countries where men are traditionally the breadwinners. 
It  is  possible  that  they  therefore  feel  more  pressure  to 
provide for their families but at the same time can often 
experience obstacles such as unrecognised qualifications, 
underemployment, language barriers and discrimination 
on the job market [52, 53]. Thus, difficulties in obtaining 
employment and resulting financial worries could have a 
greater impact on refugee and non-EEA + men arriving as 
adults  from  than  for  women. This  could  result  in  a  nar-
rowing  of  the  gender  gap  in  these  groups  with  increas-
ing age of migration, especially for refugee men who may 
also have experienced pre-migration trauma and a stress-
ful asylum-seeking process.

There  are  several  implications  for  this  study.  Since 
growing up with a migrant background may pose an extra 
challenge  and  increase  the  risk  of  CMDs  during  early 
adulthood  compared  with  non-migrants,  mental  health 
promotion  and  prevention  programs  should  include 
consideration  to  children  with  a  migrant  background. 
Such  programs  should  be  culturally  adapted  and  imple-
mented  with  a  focus  on  the  specific  needs  of  the  target 
group. Parents of migrant and descendant children could 
be  included  in  such  programs  to  help  them  understand 
the challenges their child can face when growing up with 
conflicting norms and roles in and outside of the home. 
This  may  be  particularly  important  for  those  who  origi-
nating from countries outside of the EEA, USA, Canada, 
Australia  and  New  Zealand.  Health  care  profession-
als  should  also  be  aware  that  descendants  and  migrants 
arriving from non-EEA countries at a young age may be 
at higher risk of CMDs than their majority and adulthood 
migrant  counterparts.  They  need  the  competency  to 
identify and understand the challenges that these young 
people  face,  so  they  can  offer  appropriate  interventions 
or  support  in  culturally  meaningful  ways.  Our  findings 
also confirm the need for continued focus on the mental 
health  of  refugees,  who,  are  at  increased  risk  of  CMDs. 
Importantly,  CMD  diagnoses  appeared  more  common 

among migrants with longer stays. On the one hand, this 
could indicate that long-term exposure to stressors such 
as  discrimination  or  social  inequality  increase  the  risk 
of  CMDs.  Thus,  efforts  to  reduce  inequalities  and  dis-
crimination in society could help prevent CMDs among 
migrants.  On  the  other  hand,  barriers  to  using  health 
care  for  migrants  arriving  after  late  childhood  may  also 
partly  explain  the  negative  relationship  between  age  of 
migration  and  diagnosed  CMDs.  Thus,  greater  efforts 
to  reduce  barriers,  with  a  particular  focus  on  migrants 
arriving as adults, must be made. Interventions improv-
ing  language  skills,  health  literacy  and  understanding  of 
the healthcare service as well as the competency of health 
care professionals in identifying mental health problems 
in  different  migrant  groups  could  potentially  lead  to 
improved  help-seeking,  identification  and  treatment  of 
CMDs among newly arrived adult migrants.

Limitations

Data  on  healthcare  use  prior  to  2008  was  not  avail-
able,  so  we  were  unable  to  see  if  a  person  was  previ-
ously  diagnosed  with  a  CMD,  or  if  the  onset  occurred 
before  inclusion  at  25  years.  Although  young  adulthood 
is  a  common  time  for  onset  of  CMDs,  adolescence  and 
emerging  adulthood  are  also  risk  periods  [54].  There 
may  also  be  an  under-identification  of  CMDs  among 
individuals  who  were  already  aged  25 + in  2008,  and  for 
migrants  who  arrived  in  Norway  after  2008.  This  could 
be particularly the case for migrants arriving both during 
early  adulthood  and  after  2008.  Thus,  the  difference  in 
odds of CMDs between migrants arriving as children and 
as  adults  could  be  slightly  overestimated.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  analysis  accounts  for  the  number  of  years  an 
individual contributes to the dataset, and thus those who 
are in the dataset for a shorter period have less impact on 
the results.

Although we offer several explanations for our findings, 
we are unable to tease out how much of the relationship 
between age of migration and CMDs can be attributed to 
each explanation (growing up with a migrant background 
and  the  associated  acculturation  stress,  lower  health 
selection  among  younger  migrants,  declining  mental 
health  with  increasing  length  of  stay  or  greater  barriers 
for migrants arriving as adults). Future studies could have 
a  longer  follow-up  time  during  adulthood  to  determine 
whether migrants arriving during adulthood also end up 
with  increased  risk  of  CMDs  after  many  years  in  Nor-
way or if this is only for those migrating at younger ages. 
Studies  could  also  utilise  different  data  sources,  such  as 
self-reported  data  or  clinical  interviews  to  complement 
our  study.  However,  such  studies  are  often  subject  to 
selection  bias.  Suicide  is  also  often  attributed  to  mental 
disorder,  including  depression.  Assessing  the  relation-
ship between age of migration and suicide could help to 

Straiton et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2024) 24:521 Page 14 of 16

discern if the lower risk among those migrating as adults 
is  due  to  this  group  being  less  likely  to  seek  care.  If  the 
pattern was far weaker than in the current study, it might 
suggest that many migrants arriving as adults fail to seek 
help for mental disorders.

Finally, there are several confounders that we have been 
unable to account for, such as pre-migration negative life 
events  including  traumatic  experiences,  parental  mental 
disorder as well as post-migration stressors such as per-
ceived  discrimination  or  negative  social  control.  These 
may help explain the relationship between CMDs and age 
of migration.

Conclusions
Migrants arriving as children with long stays and descen-
dants of migrants have higher odds of a CMD diagnosis 
during  early  adulthood  than  their  non-migrant  counter-
parts.  We  argue  that  this  difference  is  more  likely  to  be 
due to the challenges of growing up between two cultures 
and the experience of discrimination or social exclusion 
than the migration experience itself. The decline in risk of 
CMDs with increasing age of migration could also be due 
to  a  greater  health  selection  effect  among  adults  com-
pared with children. Yet, this health advantage decreases 
with increasing length of stays. Prevention programs fos-
tering  positive  mental  health  and  social  inclusion  from 
a  young  age  could  have  universal  benefits,  especially 
for children with a migrant background from outside of 
EEA, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Barriers 
to  health  care  should  also  be  addressed,  particularly  for 
migrants migrating as adults.
