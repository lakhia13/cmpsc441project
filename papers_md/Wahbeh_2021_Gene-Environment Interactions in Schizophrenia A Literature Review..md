Abstract: Schizophrenia is a devastating mental illness with a strong genetic component that is the
subject of extensive research. Despite the high heritability, it is well recognized that non-genetic factors
such as certain infections, cannabis use, psychosocial stress, childhood adversity, urban environment,
and immigrant status also play a role. Whenever genetic and non-genetic factors co-exist, interaction
between the two is likely. This means that certain exposures would only be of consequence given
a speciﬁc genetic makeup. Here, we provide a brief review of studies reporting evidence of such
interactions, exploring genes and variants that moderate the effect of the environment to increase
risk of developing psychosis. Discovering these interactions is crucial to our understanding of the
pathogenesis of complex disorders. It can help in identifying individuals at high risk, in developing
individualized treatments and prevention plans, and can inﬂuence clinical management.

Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder that affects ~20 million people world-
wide [1,2]. The ﬁrst episode of psychosis typically occurs in early adulthood, and the course
of disease varies among individuals (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fifth Edition, DSM-V). Patients with schizophrenia suffer an array of symptoms that are
classiﬁed as positive, negative, and cognitive. Positive symptoms include delusions, hallu-
cinations, and disorganized speech. Negative symptoms include ﬂat affect and poverty
of speech. Cognitive symptoms include impairments in attention, working memory, and
executive functions (DSM-V). Many of these symptoms affect the functional independence
of patients and often lead to social and/or occupational dysfunction. As a result, ~25% of
schizophrenia patients suffer from clinical depression [3], substance abuse, and have a high
risk of suicide [3,4], all of which make schizophrenia a major public health burden.

It has been well established that the interplay between an individual’s genetic makeup
and the environment is important in the development of schizophrenia. Genetically,
schizophrenia is highly heritable with heritability estimated at ~80%, and monozygotic
twin concordance at ~45% [5]. The underlying genetic architecture of the disease is poly-
genic, involving both rare damaging variants (inherited and de novo) that highly increase
risk and common variants with small to moderate effects [5]. In addition to genetics,
exposure to different environmental factors at several stages during development (pre-
natal life, perinatal life, adolescence, and adulthood) have also been shown to contribute
to the risk of developing schizophrenia [5]. Some of these environmental factors have
cumulative/additive effects [6], and may be correlated with each other and possibly share
causal pathways [7]. It is likely that the development of schizophrenia is the result of
interactions between the two types of risk factors, genetic and environmental, rather than
a result of their independent effects. This possibility has led to a considerable number of

studies aiming to identify environmental risk factors and their likely interactions with the
individual’s genetic background.

Uncovering and understanding the interactions between genetic and environmental
risk factors during development is of great importance, as it will allow for the identiﬁcation
of disease related pathways that can be exploited to identify individuals at higher risk in
the presence of certain exposures. This can inﬂuence clinical management and assist in
creating individualized prevention plans for those at higher risk and treatment plans for
patients. In this review, after a brief introduction on the genetic and environmental factors
associated with schizophrenia, we showcase and discuss some of the most recent studies
from the considerable volume of literature on the subject, connecting genetic risk to speciﬁc
environmental exposures.

2. Genetic Risk of Schizophrenia

Although no single gene or variant has been identiﬁed that is sufﬁcient to cause
schizophrenia, some rare copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) with high effect sizes have been implicated in the disease pathogenesis. Deletions
at 22q11.2 represent some of the earliest discoveries [8] and mutations in the SETD1A
gene are among the most recently identiﬁed variants [9]. Walsh et al. have shown that
individuals with schizophrenia have more rare structural variants such as deletions and/or
duplications of one or more genes compared to controls [10]. The use of large exome and
genome sequencing datasets has allowed for identiﬁcation of more rare coding variants
that confer substantial risk for schizophrenia [11,12].

Common variants with smaller effect sizes have gained a lot of attention in the last
decade as many have been identiﬁed after recent advancements in genome-wide associ-
ation studies (GWAS), increasing our understanding of their contribution to the risk of
disease [5,13]. The most recent schizophrenia GWAS to date identiﬁed 270 loci signiﬁcantly
associated with schizophrenia [13]. These loci include genes involved in dopamine signal-
ing, glutamate signaling, ion channel function, and immune response [13,14]. Although
these associations are common and of small or moderate effect, the large number of robust
associations between DNA variants and schizophrenia is beginning to suggest possible
ways to prevent and/or better treat the disease. These associations can also be used to
estimate one’s risk through the calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS), which sums
the number of risk alleles weighted by their effect size. PRSs are valuable not only as a
preliminary measure of risk, but also as a tool to assess genetic relationships of phenotypes
and environmental exposures

Although schizophrenia is a complex disorder with environmental triggers playing
a signiﬁcant role in disease development, most genetic studies ignore the effect of the
environment concentrating on genetic variation in isolation. Classic twin studies estimate
the heritability of schizophrenia to be ~80% [5]. However, twin and adoption studies cannot
fully account for shared environments (e.g., in utero), potentially overestimating the genetic
contribution to disease development. It has also been shown that heritability estimates of
schizophrenia are lower, at 64–67% [15–17] in family data from national records. Despite
these potential overestimations of genetic risk, schizophrenia is clearly one of the most
heritable neuropsychiatric disorders. Although that is the case, much of the heritability is
still not explained by the additive effects of the known disease-associated genetic variants.
Without assessing the environmental risk, we may miss pathophysiological pathways that
are involved in disease development and thus hinder discovery of treatments and ways to
prevent disease.

3. Environmental Risk Factors of Schizophrenia

Multiple biological, psychological, and social environmental risk factors have been asso-
ciated with schizophrenia. They include infectious agents such as Toxoplasma gondii [18–21],
cytomegalovirus [18,22–24], and others [18,23,24], inﬂammation markers such as cytokines
and C-reactive protein [19], and obstetric complications including complications during

Genes 2021, 12, 1850

3 of 13

pregnancy and delivery like bleeding, diabetes, rhesus incompatibility, preeclampsia, uter-
ine atony, asphyxia, and emergency Cesarean section [25,26]. Additionally, increased
risk has been associated with maternal nutritional deprivation [27,28] and cannabis use,
especially during adolescence [29–31]. Psychosocial stress and childhood adversity have
also been a major area of study linking the development of schizophrenia with an environ-
mental exposure [32,33], along with a few studies that have associated increased risk with
migration and urbanization (both of which could be considered causes of stress). Interest-
ingly, season of birth also appears to play a role, with winter births being associated with
higher risk [34–37]. It appears that the environmental impact on increasing schizophrenia
risk is most prominent early in development (fetal period and childhood), although not ex-
clusively, as some environmental exposures such as cannabis use have been shown to have
an impact in adolescence and early adulthood. Environmental risk factors can function on
an individual level or on a population and their effects can either be the direct culprit of
the risk increase, or they may act as markers for other directly implicated factors not yet
identiﬁed [37]. In comparison with genetic risk factors, individual environmental factors
generally show higher odds ratios than common genetic variant detected by GWAS [38].
There are many limitations to studying environmental risk factors for schizophrenia
and other neuropsychiatric disorders in general. Many environmental factors are very
difﬁcult to measure. Some are subjective experiences, like stress and childhood adversities.
Others, like certain infections, have a limited impact window as they only have an effect
during speciﬁc developmental stages. Some have variable dose-dependent outcomes,
like cannabis use [39,40]. Many of the environmental factors may also be interdependent,
which makes measuring their independent impact on psychosis and other psychiatric
symptoms difﬁcult [40]. The mechanisms through which environmental factors play a
role in psychiatric disorders can also vary, as some operate within biological pathways
through gene-environment interactions while others lead to changes in the epigenome
impacting gene expression and consequently behavior [41]. Finally, different studies of the
same outcome or exposure, use different models and variables adding yet another level of
complexity to the interpretation of the data [40].

4. Gene-Environment (GxE) Interactions

While environmental factors are important and have relatively strong effects, the
susceptibility of an individual to them will depend to a signiﬁcant extent on the person’s
genetic makeup. GxE interactions, although expected to exist widely, are difﬁcult to
identify because of the large search space, involving millions of variants and dozens of
environments thereby diminishing statistical power. Nevertheless, several such interactions
have been identiﬁed mostly through-hypothesis driven studies. In this review, we will
speciﬁcally discuss studies addressing GxE interactions of genetic variation with infection,
cannabis use, and psychosocial stress/childhood adversity as they are the most studied.

4.1. Infection

Epidemiological studies have long provided evidence for a link between speciﬁc infec-
tions and psychoses [19,42]. Prenatal maternal infections of Toxoplasma gondii (Toxo) [18,19],
herpes simplex viruses [19–21], cytomegalovirus [18,22–24], and rubella [19] have been
shown to increase risk of developing schizophrenia. These infectious agents seem to in-
crease the risk by disrupting fetal neurodevelopment in response to infection as well as
maternal immune activation [43–45]. Among them, Toxo is the most studied infectious
agent with the strongest evidence to be implicated in schizophrenia development. It is a pro-
tozoan parasite that is neuro-invasive and causes toxoplasmosis. It can remain in the body
of immune-competent mammalian hosts after infection for long periods of time. Prenatal
maternal Toxo infections increase the risk of schizophrenia by 80% [46,47]. Multiple studies
have assessed a potential GxE interaction between Toxo and schizophrenia-associated vari-
ants. In a meta-analysis of a toxoplasmosis susceptibility GWAS done by Wang et al., there
was enrichment for genes associated with schizophrenia in populations with IgG seropos-

Genes 2021, 12, 1850

itivity for Toxo, an indication of previous infection [48]. Although this shows that genes
involved in schizophrenia development may also be involved in the susceptibility or the
immune response to Toxo, conﬂicting evidence from a study by Lori et al. showed that PRS
scores (based on schizophrenia GWAS data) do not predict schizophrenia in individuals
who are IgG seropositive for Toxo [49]. The immune response and neuroinﬂammation due
to Toxo and other infectious agents have also been implicated as a potential mechanism for
GxE interactions. Avramopoulos et al. and Dickerson et al. showed that C-reactive protein
(CRP), a peripheral marker of inﬂammation, was elevated in schizophrenia patients [50,51].
In a small case-control study, Mouhawess et al. investigated an association between poly-
morphism in Metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9), Toxo infection and schizophrenia. They chose
MMP-9 because of its role in neuroinﬂammation. They showed that the MMP-91562 C
allele was only observed in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and seropositive for
Toxo IgG and IgM or IgG alone [52]. In another study, Ansari-Lari et al. tested 78 cases
and 91 controls for a polymorphism in Glutathione S-Transferase Theta 1 (GSTT1) and its
association with schizophrenia and Toxo infection [53]. GSTT1 is located on 22q11.2, a locus
previously associated with schizophrenia [8]. They concluded that risk of schizophrenia
increased in patients who were infected with Toxo and had a deletion in GSTT1, although
they also mention that other studies have not shown an association between variants in
GSTT1 and schizophrenia [53]. Severance et al. investigated the association of complement
C4 gene copy number and haplotype groups with schizophrenia and Toxo IgG along with
other biomarkers of pathogen exposure. The C4 gene is structurally complex with different
haplogroups that reﬂect copy number variations. C4 gene forms include C4A gene short
(C4AS), C4A gene long (C4AL), C4B gene short (C4BS), and C4B gene long (C4BL). The
authors found that the haplogroup containing two copies of 4AL had a strong association
with schizophrenia and Toxo IgG [54].

There have been a few studies investigating genetic interactions with herpes simplex
viruses, HSV-1 and -2. It is known that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene polymor-
phisms, located on chromosome 6, impact immune surveillance. With that in mind, Bamne
and colleagues tested schizophrenia-associated SNPs on chromosome 6p for association
with exposure to HSV-1. They found that HSV-1 exposure was signiﬁcantly associated with
one of the tested schizophrenia-associated SNPs (rs3130297), yet the HSV-1 associated allele
was different from the schizophrenia-associated allele. They hypothesize that this could be
a result of epistatic effects at the SNP rs3130297 or another SNP in linkage disequilibrium
(LD) [55]. Demontis et al. investigated an association between schizophrenia associated
SNPs in GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, and GRIN2D, exposure to HSV-2 during
pregnancy, and schizophrenia development in offspring in a case control study with 984
patients and 1500 controls. GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, and GRIN2D all encode
subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which has been shown to be
involved in the development of schizophrenia. They genotyped a total of 81 tag SNPs
(tSNPs), which are deﬁned as SNPs not in LD representing different haplotypes and inves-
tigated their association with maternal HSV-2 seropositivity. They showed a signiﬁcant
interaction between maternal HSV-2 seropositivity and SNPs rs1805539 and rs1806205 in
the gene GRIN2B in the offspring [56]. Moreover, Pandy et al. evaluated immunoglobulin
GM (γ marker) allotype associations with schizophrenia. GM alleles have been shown to
impact immunity to HSV-1 and other viruses. In their analysis, they found that individuals
with the GM genotypes 3/3; 23−/23− were more than three times more likely to develop
schizophrenia than individuals with other genotypes. These results implicate immunoglob-
ulin GM genes in schizophrenia and suggest a potential GxE interaction pathway for
viruses like HSV-1 [57]. Shirts et al. studied ﬁve selected SNPs from a set of tSNPs in the
100 kb region ﬂanking the marker D6S2672 in the gene MICB, previously associated with
schizophrenia. They performed their interaction analysis between genes, seropositivity of
HSV-1 and schizophrenia on two separate samples (one was a case-control cohort, and one
was a case-parent trio cohort). They found two SNPs associated with both seropositivity
for HSV-1 and schizophrenia in non-schizophrenia samples and suggested as a possible

Genes 2021, 12, 1850

interpretation of this result an interaction between genotype and HSV-1 seropositivity [58].
In another study, the same group showed that SNPs rs2272127 and rs11465702 at the gene
IL18RAP were associated with HSV-1 seropositivity in patients with schizophrenia [59]. All
of the mentioned studies are candidate gene/variant studies, and experience has shown
that publication bias and low power in such studies can sometimes lead to false positives.
More research is still needed to further investigate the link between herpes simplex viruses,
schizophrenia and the genome as no genome wide studies employing PRS scores have
been done to our knowledge.

Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted over 20 million people who became
infected with SARS-CoV-2 [60]. It has been shown that some COVID-19 patients experience
neuropsychiatric symptoms after infection [61,62]. Moni et al. investigated the potential
interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and underlying genetic psychiatric susceptibilities [60].
They analyzed the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19
patients and found elevated expression of inﬂammatory cytokine and interferon response
genes [60]. It has also been shown that SARS-CoV-2 can infect nerve cells [60]. Cytokine
storm is a common consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a cause of complication and
poor prognosis for many COVID-19 patients [63]. Patients also have elevated levels of
cytokines and chemokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-10
(IL-10) after infection [62,64]. This is of interest, as it has been shown that inﬂammation
poses an environmental risk to increasing risk of schizophrenia [19]. Elevated IL-8 during
the second trimester and the early third trimester in mothers increased risk for schizophre-
nia development in the offspring [19,65]. To our knowledge, no studies have directly
associated infection with SARS-CoV-2 with an increased risk for psychosis, however, inves-
tigating why some COVID-19 patients suffer neuropsychiatric symptoms after infection
may be an interesting area of research.

4.2. Cannabis Use

Evidence over the last few decades has suggested that cannabis use in early adoles-
cence is involved with the development of psychosis [29–31,66]. A mendelian randomiza-
tion study by Vaucher et al. suggested that the association between cannabis and increased
risk of schizophrenia is causal [31]. While one must be cautious because mendelian ran-
domization is sensitive to pleiotropy, where the variants associated with cannabis use may
be associated with some other variable that is the true cause of risk, the authors tested and
found no such evidence, contingent on the power of the test. Given the relatively large
proportion of the population that has ever used or currently uses cannabis, use alone is not
sufﬁcient to cause schizophrenia. Several studies, from candidate gene studies to genome
wide studies, have all provided evidence for interplay between genes and cannabis use in
the development of psychosis and schizophrenia [67]. McGuire et al. assessed for family
history of schizophrenia in 23 cannabis users and 46 controls, where 2/3 of the individuals
in each group had a psychosis diagnosis. They found that individuals who developed psy-
chosis after cannabis use were more likely to have family history of schizophrenia, showing
that experiencing psychotic symptoms after cannabis use may be due to a potential genetic
predisposition [30,68].

One of the most studied genes for its interaction with cannabis and impact on
schizophrenia development is COMT. COMT codes for catechol-O-methyltransferase,
an enzyme that plays a role in dopamine breakdown. It is also localized to chromosome
22q11.1. A longitudinal study following individuals to adulthood looked into a speciﬁc
polymorphism (Val158Met) in COMT, as a potential gene moderator for the association
between cannabis use and psychosis development [69]. The results of the study implicated
the COMT Val158Met Val allele as a link between adolescent cannabis use and an increased
risk for later psychosis [69]. Although other studies have found conﬂicting evidence [70],
Henquet et al. reported similar ﬁndings to the Caspi et al. study [71]. They followed
adult-onset cannabis users with psychosis and controls, and showed that individuals
homozygous for the Val allele at COMT Val158Met were more sensitive to the effects of

Genes 2021, 12, 1850

6 of 13

delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychotropic component in cannabis, on
cognition and psychosis [71].

Aside from COMT, cannabis users with speciﬁc alleles in variants in the DRD2 [72],
FAAH [73], and AKT1 genes [74,75] have been found to be much more likely to develop
psychotic symptoms. It is important to note, however, that in 2020, Hindocha et al. reported
contradictory results with a larger sample, showing that neither COMT, AKT1, or FAAH
modulated a psychosis response to cannabis use [76]. Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) has
also been implicated in cannabis use and schizophrenia risk [77,78] although, again, with
conﬂicting evidence. CB1 is a G-coupled protein receptor involved in neurotransmission of
glutamate, dopamine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and is expressed in the brain [79].
CB1 is stimulated by endocannabinoids and exogenously by THC. CB1 has been shown
to both be activated and blocked by THC [77,80,81]. Ujiki et al.
found that an AAT
repeat polymorphism in the 3(cid:48) region of CRN1, the gene encoding CB1, was signiﬁcantly
associated with hebephrenic schizophrenia in the Japanese population [82]. Ho et al.
genotyped 12 tSNPs [83], and although none showed signiﬁcant associations with either
patients who were cannabis users or nonusers, 3 of the tSNPs had signiﬁcant associations
with total cerebral white matter volumes in patients. Moreover, they showed that patients
with heavy cannabis use had smaller frontotemporal white matter volumes compared to
patients not using cannabis [83]. Other studies investigating SNPs in CRN1 have shown no
associations between the variants and schizophrenia in relation to cannabis use. Examples
include a study by Seifert et al. where they performed an association study of three different
CNR1 polymorphisms and did not detect statistically signiﬁcant associations in either the
case or control groups [84]. Another study looked for associations with CNR1, including
four SNPs (one of which was in common with the Seifert et al. study), and also saw no
signiﬁcant association between schizophrenia and any of the tested SNPs, even when they
included cannabis use as a dependent variable in their regression analysis [77].

In the last few years, studies employing genome wide data and PRS scores have
emerged, adding to the evidence of GxE interactions linking cannabis use and schizophre-
nia. In a study of 1574 participants, French et al. found that in male cannabis users, high
PRS scores for schizophrenia were associated with low cortical thickness, a known risk fac-
tor for psychosis. This indicates that cannabis use could moderate the association between
the genetic risk and cortical maturation in schizophrenia patients [85]. In another study,
Wainberg et al. assessed the relationship between self-reported psychotic experiences,
cannabis use, and PRS scores for schizophrenia in participants from the UK BIOBANK [86].
They found that 7% of those who were cannabis users self-reported psychotic symptoms
compared to only 4.1% of those who have never used cannabis. The effect of cannabis
was dose-dependent, as 8.4% of monthly users, 8.8% of weekly users, and 9.6% of daily
users reported psychotic experiences. They also found that cannabis users with the highest
PRS scores for schizophrenia had 1.58-fold greater adjusted odds of psychotic experiences
(self-reported) compared to 1.39-fold in users with the lowest PRS scores [86]. Another
group also found that there was an additive interaction between schizophrenia PRS scores
and regular cannabis use [87].

The controversy around whether cannabis use has a direct causal relationship to
increasing schizophrenia risk remains. Patients with schizophrenia may experience higher
levels of stress and depressive symptoms. Cannabis has been known to help alleviate
stress and improve symptoms [88,89], making it plausible that schizophrenia patients
are more likely to use cannabis as a form of self-medication. A longitudinal study by
Hiemstra et al. found that individuals with high PRS scores for schizophrenia were more
likely to use cannabis in adolescence (ages 16–20 and using stringent PRS thresholds) [90].
In another study by Verweij et al., PRS scores for schizophrenia were signiﬁcantly associated
with lifetime and regular cannabis use, with risk scores explaining up to 0.5% of the
variance [91]. Power et al. also used PRS scores for schizophrenia to test if they correlate
with cannabis use and found positive associations [92]. These studies add complexity to

Genes 2021, 12, 1850

the association between cannabis use and schizophrenia, and show that the link may not
be as straight forward.

4.3. Psychosocial Stress and Childhood Adversity

Psychosocial stress and childhood adversity have been shown to increase risk for
psychosis and schizophrenia. Psychosocial stress can be deﬁned as stress that is caused
by perception of social threat that results in emotional tension and discomfort. This in-
cludes situations of perceived social evaluation and social exclusion as well as stressful life
events [32,93]. Childhood adversity is deﬁned by exposure to abuse, neglect, or family dys-
function [33]. The earliest studies investigating a link between genes, stress, and psychosis
development were candidate gene studies. Winkel et al. investigated GxE interactions
between stress and COMT (already implicated in cannabis use and schizophrenia) after
epidemiological studies had shown that individuals who were homozygous for the Met
allele at the COMT Val158Met were more sensitive to stress. In a small sample, Winkel et al.
showed that patients with a psychotic disorder who were carriers of the Met allele had more
psychotic experiences in response to daily stress compared to controls, implicating COMT
in stress and psychosis [94]. Collip et al. followed up on the Winkel et al. study with a larger
sample and conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant interaction between COMT Met allele carriers, stress,
and psychosis [95]. Interestingly, a study by Stefanis et al. investigated the interaction
between COMT Val158Met and psychosis in a sample of young men entering compulsory
military training, and found that exposure to stress at army induction was associated with
psychotic symptoms and that carriers of the COMT Val allele were more susceptible to
the effect of stress, contradicting data from the previous studies [96,97]. COMT has also
been investigated as a moderator between childhood adversity and psychosis [98]. Debost
et al. found that COMT Val allele carriers who were exposed to childhood adversity and
were also carriers of MTHFR T alleles were at increased risk of schizophrenia compared to
controls [98]. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) [96], CACNA1C [99], NRG1 [100],
and FKBP5 [101] are all additional candidate gene examples of a genetic link between stress,
childhood adversity, and psychosis.

Genome wide studies employing PRS scores have also investigated genes, stress, and
childhood adversity interactions and effects on psychosis. A 2009 study by Tessner et al.
followed adolescent individuals with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) and used that
as a proxy for elevated genetic risk for psychotic disorders since SPD symptoms are similar
to prodromal signs of schizophrenia. They found that among adolescents, including those
who they deemed at high risk for developing a psychotic disorder, the frequency of daily
stressors in a 24-h period predicted an increase in positive prodromal symptoms one year
later. Although the daily stressors did not correlate with SPD in predicting prodromal
symptoms in relation to stress, they did report that adolescents with SPD had stronger
perceptions of stress to the same daily stressors than their non-diagnosed peers [102].
Pries et al. used schizophrenia PRS scores of a twin cohort and their siblings of a ﬁnal
sample of 593 participants to investigate a GxE interaction between the scores, childhood
adversity or daily stressors and psychosis. Their study concluded that there is an interaction
between PRS scores and childhood adversity affecting subtle psychosis expression and
stress-sensitivity. They hypothesize that sensitivity to daily stressors is affected by previous
exposure to bigger stressors like childhood adversity, highlighting that the type, timing,
and severity of stress has a potential role in psychosis development [103]. The same group
investigated a sample of 1699 Schizophrenia patients and 1542 unrelated controls from
the European Network of National Networks studying GxE Interactions in Schizophrenia
(EUGEI), and found evidence of an additive interaction between schizophrenia PRS scores
and childhood bullying, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional neglect, all of which
are examples of childhood adversity [87]. In another study Hatzimanolis et al. studying a
young healthy male population found that the observed association between polygenic
risk for schizophrenia and schizotypal traits is modiﬁed by stress [104]. In a 2020 study
of 6646 participants, Pries et al. calculated PRS scores as well as exposome scores for

Genes 2021, 12, 1850

8 of 13

schizophrenia. They deﬁne the exposome score as a cumulative measure of environmental
liability for schizophrenia [105]. In their analysis investigating the associations of stressful
life events with either the exposome score or the PRS score, they found that the association
of stressful life with mental outcomes was moderated only by the exposome score and not
the PRS score [106].

It’s important to note that many environmental factors can be considered sources
of psychosocial stress and likely are also associated with increased schizophrenia risk.
Winkel et al. have summarized a few studies on indirect measures of stress like urbanic-
ity [96], migrant status, and others.

5. Conclusions

The studies discussed in this review suggest that investigating the link between
environmental and genetic risks of schizophrenia through GxE interaction studies can
contribute to our understanding of schizophrenia development. Despite the importance of
these studies and the need for more, especially more agnostic, genome-wide exploration
studies of GxE interactions in schizophrenia, performing them has challenges and limita-
tions [105]. Many of the earliest studies of GxE interaction in schizophrenia used family
history as a proxy for genetic risk, and although it is strongly related, family history is not
equivalent to genetic contributions [106]. The results of more recent studies employing PRS
scores can’t be generalized to all ethnicities, as PRS for schizophrenia are only predictive for
populations genetically close to those used to calculate the scores. GxE interaction studies
also require large sample sizes compared to genetic or environmental studies, which can
be challenging [46]. Moreover, questions of possible confounding by GxE correlation [72]
and the difﬁculty in reliably measuring environmental factors complicates how we can
interpret data from GxE interaction studies.

Although GxE interaction studies are difﬁcult to conduct for reasons mentioned
above, studying GxE interactions in schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders remains
essential, as such knowledge can enhance our approaches to diagnosis and treatment, for
which there is a strong need for this devastating disorder.
