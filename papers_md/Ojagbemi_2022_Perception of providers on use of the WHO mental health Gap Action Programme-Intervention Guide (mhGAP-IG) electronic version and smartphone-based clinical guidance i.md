Abstract 
Background:  Taking advantage of the rapidly increasing access to digital technology in low- and middle-income 
countries, the World Health Organization has launched an electronic version of the mental health Gap Action Pro-
gramme intervention guide (emhGAP-IG). This is suitable for use on smartphones or tablets by non-specialist primary 
healthcare providers (PHCWs) to deliver evidence-based intervention for priority mental, neurological and substance 
use disorders. We assessed the perceptions of PHCWs on the feasibility, acceptability, and benefits of using smart-
phone-based clinical guidance and the emhGAP-IG in the management of people with mental health conditions in 
Nigeria. 

Methods:  Exploration of the views of PHCWs from 12 rural and urban primary health clinics (PHCs) in South-Western 
Nigeria were carried out using 34 in-depth key informant qualitative interviews with nurses (n 
health officers (n 
each comprising eight participants drawn from across the range of characteristics of PHCWs, were also conducted.

data.

Results:  Three overall themes were identified around the use of clinical guidance and mobile applications (apps) in 
PHCs. Apps were deployed for purposes other than clinical consultation and decision making. Although paper-based 
guidance was the expected practice, its utilization is not fully embedded in routine care. An app-based decision-
making tool was preferred to paper by PHCWs. Future usage of the emhGAP-IG would be facilitated by training and 
supporting of staff, helpful design features, and obtaining patients’ buy-in.

Introduction
Globally,  approximately  90%  of  people  with  untreated 
mental health conditions live in low- and middle-income 
countries  (LMICs)  [1]  where  80%  of  all  people  with  a 
mental health disorder also reside [2]. Evidence from the 
World  Mental  Health  Surveys  [3,  4]  suggested  that  in 
Nigeria, only 0.8% of persons with anxiety disorders and 
6%  of  those  with  mood  disorders  made  any  treatment 
contact  in  the  year  of  the  illness.  The  majority  of  Nige-
rians who sought treatment did so at primary or general 
healthcare settings [5]. Scarcity of mental health special-
ists and the concentration of hospitals with mental health 
capabilities in geographically distant urban locations are 
two factors that rank as top barriers to accessing special-
ist mental health care in LMICs [6].

‘Task sharing’ [7] is one of the efficient solutions to the 
challenge of providing adequate care to people with men-
tal health disorders in LMICs. This involves strengthen-
ing  the  capacity  of  non-specialist  healthcare  workers  to 
deliver  evidence-based  mental  healthcare  with  support 
and  supervision  from  better  trained  or  specialist  care 
providers [7]. Non-specialist healthcare workers have the 
advantage of being more widely available. They often live 
in  the  same  community  as  patients  and  share  patients’ 
explanatory  models  of  illness  [8].  They  are  thus  better 
able to deliver basic psychosocial interventions using cul-
turally  appropriate  approaches  that  are  more  acceptable 
to  patients.  Several  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCT), 
reviewed by Singla and colleagues [9], have demonstrated 
the  effectiveness  of  psychosocial  interventions  delivered 
by  non-specialist  healthcare  workers  for  mental  health 
conditions in LMICs [10].

Task sharing require the availability of evidence-based 
tools.  Based  on  over  90  systematic  reviews  [11,  12],  the 
Mental  Health  Gap  Action  Programme-Intervention 
Guide  (mhGAP-IG)  v1.0  was  launched  by  the  World 
Health Organization (WHO) as a clinical support instru-
ment  to  assist  non-specialist  mental  health  providers 
in  primary  and  community  health  services  located  in 
LMICs to deliver evidence-based interventions for prior-
ity mental, neurological and substance use disorders [12]. 
Since  its  launch  in  2010,  the  mhGAP-IG  v1.0  has  been 
used in over 100 countries worldwide. It has been found 
to be effective for the delivery of evidence-based mental 
health services within primary healthcare in LMICs [10].

Following  a  consultation  exercise  to  assess  the  5-year 
impact  of  the  mhGAP-IG,  the  WHO  developed  and 

launched the e-version of the mhGAP-IG (v2.0) in Octo-
ber  2017,  as  an  application  (App)  suitable  for  both  iOS 
and  Android  smartphones  and  tablets.  The  mhGAP-IG 
v2.0  (e-mhGAP-IG)  consists  of  8  modules  addressing 
priority  conditions  including  depression,  psychosis,  epi-
lepsy, child and adolescent mental and behavioural disor-
ders, dementia, disorders due to substance use, self-harm 
or suicide, and other significant mental health complaints 
that  impair  daily  functioning  or  lead  to  help  seeking). 
Each  module  includes  a  summary  of  the  common  pres-
entations  of  the  relevant  condition  as  well  as  guidance 
for  assessment,  management  and  follow-up.  One  of  the 
advantages  of  the  e-version  is  an  enhanced  opportunity 
for  quality  improvement  through  remote  supervision. 
However, there is limited literature on its use to date. The 
most  recent  updated  systematic  review  of  implementa-
tion  of  the  WHO  mhGAP-IG  and  its  associated  tools 
found  one  trial  registration  for  the  comparison  of  the 
e-version with the paper mhGAP-IG [10].

There is a rapidly increasing access to mobile technol-
ogy and smartphone-based applications in many LMICs. 
The  Groupe  Speciale  Mobile  Association  [13]  suggest 
that  between  2012  and  the  end  of  2020,  the  number  of 
unique  mobile  phone  subscriptions 
in  sub-Saharan 
Africa (SSA) increased by over 42%. Approximately 46% 
of  the  region’s  population  currently  subscribe  to  mobile 
technology.  This  proportion  is  predicted  rise  to  50%  by 
2025,  at  which  time  70%  of  total  connection  in  West 
Africa  will  be  via  a  smartphone.  Mobile  penetration  in 
Nigeria  was  projected  to  increase  to  55%  in  2025  [14]. 
Thirty-six percent of mobile phone connections in Nige-
ria are currently linked to a smartphone. Mobile technol-
ogy provides opportunities to expand capacity of the few 
available  mental  health  specialists  in  SSA  to  offer  train-
ing, support and supervision of nonspecialist healthcare 
workers  who  are  providing  mental  health  services  to 
communities,  especially  those  that  are  distant  from  the 
urban  centres  where  specialized  facilities  are  commonly 
based [15].

The  mhGAP-IG  was  adopted,  in  2013,  by  Nigeria’s 
highest health policy making body as a pathway for scal-
ing  up  mental  health  services  in  the  country  [16].  Stud-
ies  in  Nigeria  have  demonstrated  the  use  of  mobile 
technology  to  support  the  delivery  of  evidence-based 
mental  health  interventions  through  task  sharing  with 
non-specialist  health  workers.  For  example,  in  the 
Expanding  Care  for  Perinatal  Women  with  Depression

(EXPONATE) project [17], community midwives trained 
in  parenting  skills  as  well  as  in  the  basic  treatment  rec-
ommendations  of  the  mhGAP-IG  were  supported  by 
mental  health  specialists  through  mobile  phone  plat-
forms to deliver weekly interventions to pregnant women 
who  screened  positive  for  depression.  Follow-up  assess-
ments at six months post intervention showed remission 
rates of 66% to 70% depending on the intensity of inter-
vention [17].

To further develop the e-mhGAP-IG for successful dis-
semination  in  primary  healthcare  settings,  it  is  essential 
to  understand  the  needs,  contexts,  and  constraints  of 
frontline  primary  healthcare  workers  (PHCWs)  about 
current  and  future  use  of  app-based  clinical  guidance. 
There  are  no  previous  studies  assessing  the  feasibility 
of  an  app-based  decision-making  tool  for  mental  health 
diagnoses  in  Nigerian  primary  care  settings.  The  cur-
rent  study  was  conducted  as  a  part  of  the  UN  Medical 
Research  Council  (MRC)  funded  E-mhGAP  Interven-
tion  guide  in  Low  and  middle-income  countries:  proof-
of-concept for Impact and Acceptability (Emilia Project). 
The  aim  of  the  current  sub-study  was  to  explore  the 
perceptions  of  mhGAP-IG  trained  Primary  Health  Care 
Workers  (PHCWs)  on  the  feasibility,  acceptability,  and 
benefits of using smartphone app-based clinical guidance 
and the emhGAP-IG for detection and treatment of men-
tal health conditions in patients attending primary care.

Methods
Study design

We used a qualitative study design. This methods allowed 
for  detailed  exploration  of  personal  views  beyond  what 
might  be  possible  to  elicit  in  a  quantitative  survey  [18]. 
These,  in  the  present  study  included  details  about  the 
current practice in regarding the use of clinical guidance 
and  apps,  interest  in  or  opposition  to  the  emhGAP-IG 
and  apps,  facilitators  and  barriers  to  future  deployment 
of  app-based  decision-making  tools  in  primary  health-
care. This information was gathered using Key Informant 
Interviews (KII) and Focus Group Discussions (FGD).

Participants and settings

The study took place in 12 primary health clinics (PHCs) 
representing  a  range  of  urban  and  rural  settings  within 
four local government areas (L.G.As) in Ibadan metrop-
olis,  Southwestern  Nigeria  (Table  1).  In  all,  Ibadan 
metropolis has 11 local government areas and a popula-
tion of approximately 3.5 million people. The four LGAs 
included  in  the  present  study  are  Ibadan  North,  Ibadan 
North West, Lagelu and Akinyele.

Specialist mental health services in Ibadan are primar-
ily  provided  by  two  large  general  hospitals.  There  are 
186  PHCs  each  serving  a  population  of  approximately

10,000.  PHCs  in  Ibadan  and  Nigeria  are  staffed  by  non-
physician  health  workers:  nurses,  Community  Health 
Officers (CHOs) and community health extension work-
ers  CHEWs).  In  Nigeria,  CHOs  and  CHEWs  receive 
2–3 years post-secondary school training in basic health 
issues. They often have limited training in mental health. 
Non-physician  PHCWs  in  Nigeria  are  authorized  to 
prescribe  a  limited  range  of  mental  health  medications, 
including  amitriptyline  and  chlorpromazine.  They  are 
routinely  supervised  by  either  general  physicians  or 
senior  nurses,  and  all  are  employed  in  the  public  health 
system.

Study procedure

Participants  were  purposively  selected  staff  of  the  12 
PHCs  who  had  received  training  in  the  use  mhGAP-IG 
and  who  provide  treatment  for  common  health  condi-
tions,  including  mental  health  disorders,  presenting  in 
primary care. The mhGAP-IG training workshop ran for 
five days. It was competency based with didactic lectures, 
role  plays,  pre-and  post-training  assessments.  The  main 
goal of training was on the use of mhGAP-IG in routine 
practice.

All participants in the present study provided informed 
and  written  consent  to  participate.  We  first  conducted 
two FGDs, each comprising eight informants drawn from 
across  the  range  of  characteristics  of  PHCWs.  This  was 
to explore organizational, contextual and process issues. 
We  next  conducted  thirty-four  semi-structured  KIIs 
with  nurses  (n = 10),  community  health  officers  (n = 13) 
and  community  health  extension  workers  (n = 11).  This 
was  to  explore  personal  experiences,  including  sensitive 
issues  that  respondents  might  have  difficulty  discussing 
at FGDs.

Interview questions

We  developed  a  contextually  relevant  interview  topic 
guide  for  both  the  FGDs  and  KIIs.  This  was  reviewed 
by  a  group  of  3  PHCWs  comprising  a  nurse,  CHO  and 
CHEW.  The  interview  guide  explored  a  range  of  topics 
such as daily work life, identifying key problems at work, 
use of technology at work, as well as use of and interest in 
supervision  and  support.  The  FGDs  and  KIIs  were  con-
ducted  between  April  and  August  2019,  in  Yoruba  and 
English  languages,  at  the  PHCs  and  by  trained  research 
assistants under the supervision of LK and AO. While the 
KIIs lasted between 45 and 60 min, the FGDs lasted for 
an hour and half. All sessions were audio-recorded with 
the permission of participants.

Qualitative data analyses

Recordings of FGDs and KIIs were transcribed verbatim 
by research staff and anonymised to maintain confidenti-
ality. Translation into English was caried out by two inde-
pendent forward translators fluent in English and Yoruba 
languages.  They  compared  their  versions  to  identify 
discrepancies,  use  of  ambiguous  or  vague  wording  and 
accuracy. A final version of the transcript in English was 
developed with the two original translators by a research 
staff fluent in English and Yoruba languages. Back trans-
lation to the source language was conducted by a fourth 
independent  translator  who  was  blinded  to  the  original 
transcript.

All  final  transcripts  were  analysed  in  three  stages 
as  summarised  in  Fig.  1  using  thematic  analysis  [19]. 
Analyses  started  with  two  researchers  (AO  and  SD) 
independently  reading  and  re-reading  transcripts  for 
familiarity  and  to  begin  to  identify  pertinent  themes. 
Each  researcher  labelled  meaningful  segment  of  text 
manually using descriptive codes. The first four KII tran-
scripts  were  independently  coded.  The  researchers  met 
after each transcript was coded to review their respective 
preliminary codes to identify areas of similarities and dif-
ferences. Disagreements in assignment of attribute codes 
was  resolved  through  discussion  to  achieve  consensus. 
A  draft  initial  coding  framework  was  then  developed, 
reviewed, and agreed upon.

In the second phase, a further 10 transcripts were coded 
using  the  initial  coding  framework.  Systematic  colla-
tion  and  review  of  data  within  each  code  was  enabled  by 
the  computer  software  package,  NVivo  10  (QSR  Interna-
tional,  2012).  The  qualitative  data  set  was  reviewed  dur-
ing  frequent  meetings  between  the  researchers  during 
which respective codes within new transcripts were com-
pared  with  previous  transcripts  for  rigor  (Saldaña,  2009). 
A  focussed  coding  framework  was  then  developed  in  the 
third  phase.  These  narrower  codes  were  reviewed  against 

Fig. 1  Process of qualitative data analyses

findings  from  a  similarly  designed  study  conducted  in 
Nepal [15]. Relationships between codes were also identi-
fied  at  this  stage.  The  final  phase  of  the  analysis  included 
22 final interviews, from which four key themes were iden-
tified.  These  were  reduced  to  three  overall  themes  after 
review  by  the  research  team.  Rigour  in  the  analyses  pro-
cess was supported by frequent meetings between AO, SD 
and a third researcher (YF) to review coding, emergence of 
themes and reflexivity.

and were drawn from urban PHCs (Table 2). Odo-ona and 
Ojo PHCs had the highest number of participants (N = 7 
each), while Apogbon and Sango PHCs had the least rep-
resentation (N = 1 each). In all, PHCWs in the FGDs com-
prised  of  six  nurses,  five  CHOs  and  five  CHEWs.  Their 
ages  ranged  from  46–59  years  and  they  had  an  average 
of 23 years of total work experience and 10 years of work 
with patients living with mental health conditions.

Key themes

The  analyses  of  the  interviews  and  FGDs  generated 
three  main  themes  around  the  use  of  clinical  guide-
lines and apps in primary care: Current practice, Future 
practice, and Design suggestions (Table 3).

Theme 1: Current practice

This theme related to current practice of using clinical 
guidelines and apps in primary care and included both 
facilitators  and  barriers  influencing  their  use.  We  will 
next consider the sub-themes.

Facilitators  of  current  use  of  guidelines  and  apps  in  pri-
mary  care  Participants  described  how  apps  were  used 
in  practice.  They  reported  that  apps  were  deployed  for 
purposes other than clinical consultation and follow-up, 
in  particular,  for  making  and  receiving  phone  calls,  offi-
cial communication, collection and transmission of clini-
cal data for surveillance.

‘I  was  the  focal  person  for  my  LGA  (Local  Govern-
ment  Area).  (The)  app  was  used  to  send  reports  on 
immunization  which  involved  the  number  of  chil-
dren immunized and the number of vaccines used…’ 
(Interview, Female, Nurse).

Several  facilitators  of  current  use  of  apps  and  clinical 
guidelines  were  identified  in  the  interviews  and  focus 
group  discussions.  These  included  formal  directives  to 
own a smartphone, to keep the devices powered and to not 
run out of data, expectations for staff to be accessible via 
their mobile devices, and staff anticipation of official com-
munication at any time of the day. Consequences of non-
compliance with these requirements included disciplinary 
phone calls from managers. Staff reported that there was 
substantial compliance with official mandates. Compliance 
with official directives about use of designated smartphone 
apps appeared to have supported a change of practice.

‘During  the  programme,  they  [programme  officials] 
mandated (it for) every health worker involved to get a 
working android phone, and that they [health workers] 
must not run out of data because messages can pop up 
any time, even midnights. It was also mandated for them 
[health  workers]  to  get  a  working  power  bank  to  keep 
powering their phones always.’ (Interview, Male, CHO).

Staff reported that it was part of their expectation to have 
and consult clinical guidance and protocols as part of their 
work. One such protocol is the ‘Standing Order’ paper guid-
ance  for  general  clinical  practice  in  Nigerian  primary  care 
settings.  The  document  describes  the  scope  of  services 
offered  in  primary  care  and  provides  an  overall  guidance 
for  the  work  of  primary  healthcare  workers.  Participants 
reported  that  some  staff  also  used  app-based  reference 
guides for purposes such as antenatal and post-natal care as 
well as immunization services within primary care.

‘I use it [the app] to send data [to the central colla-
tion office]; last year I remember one case……, bleed-
ing  was  much.  I  learnt  from  there  (App)  about  the 
type of treatment I should give when matters happen 
like that.’ (Focus group participant, Female, CHEW).

Barriers to current use of paper guidance and apps in pri-
mary  care  Participants  reported  that  busy  workloads 
were  a  barrier  to  using  existing  paper  guidance  such  as 
the ‘Standing Order’ and mhGAP-IG v1.0 within current 
practice.  They  also  suggested  that  patient  expectations 
about phone use was a reason for not using their phones 
during  consultations.  It  was  reported  that  patients  dis-
liked  telephone  calls  during  their  own  consultations, 
which could potentially limit the use of app-based deci-
sion-making tools and emhGAP-IG during consultations.

‘The only thing that patients don’t like is for you to 
be making calls during consultations. They don’t like 
it at all.’ (Focus group participant, Male, CHO).

Some illustrative quotes

Current Practice • Apps used for purposes other than clini-

cal consultation and decision making
• Expectations of staff–mandate, need to 
be accessible and use guidance

• Workload
• Systematic exclusion of some staff-
Low cadre, older, have no smartphone
• Patients’ expectation of staff to not 
use phone in consultation
• Paper record of clinical activities
• Paper guidance/mhGAP-IG not 
embedded

Future Practice

• Smartphone guidance preferred to paper-
Sees many benefits
• Training
• Patient’s expectation of staff to explain 
process

• Embedded practice-
E.g., Staff exclusion as above, interest

Design features

• Features to encourage utility

‘I was the focal person for my LGA (Local Government area). 
App was used to send reports on immunization which 
involved the number of children immunized and the num-
ber of vaccines used…’(Interview, Female, Nurse)

‘Mostly we don’t have time to use it during work 
hours; that is the fact.’(Focus group participant, 
Female, CHEW)

….’though Community Health Extension Workers 
were excluded from the project.’(Interview, Female, 
Nurse)

‘The only thing that Patients don’t like is for you to be 
making calls during consultations. They don’t like it at 
all.’(Focus group participant, Male, CHO)

‘…. like the mh-GAP book given to us, I cannot 
remember the last time I opened it….’(Interview, 
Female, Nurse)

‘To me, putting it (mhGAP-IG) on the electronic (plat-
forms) is better in the sense that it will make it easy for 
people to go through it (e-mhGAP-IG) at any time of 
the day’(Interview, Female, Nurse)

‘The only thing that can solve that problem is there will 
be training, there must be a training on that aspect 
before applying it…’(Interview, Female, Nurse)

‘You know, before you start with the patient, you 
can explain to them that once they see you doing 
things on the phone, they should not think you are 
not listening to them. It is actually for their good. You 
tell them that answers to some of the questions they 
ask, may be found on the device on your hand as the 
health worker.’(Interview, Female, CHO)

‘Supervision too can be there when there is a checklist 
there. And anytime you want to supervise, that one 
will give you the clue of what and what you are 
looking for like the time we were asked to go for the 
supervision after the training of SPECTRA (Another 
programme)’(Focus group participant, Female, Nurse)

‘Video of somebody depressed but has overcome it 
[depression] can be of help, by letting them [service 
users] see it [recovery story] that they [service users] 
can come out of that problem [depression] if they 
[service users] cooperate with us [providers], and also 
true life experience can help, that will serve as client 
expert interview…’(Interview, Female, Nurse)

‘….just like the NURI (another programme)App, the 
checklist [of signs and symptoms] should be there…
’(Focus group participant, Female, Nurse)

‘Like all those core signs can be there (in the App), 
the other signs can be there (in the App) and even 
the managements can be there too and if possible…

Participants  described  the  practice  of  excluding  certain 
groups  of  staff  from  the  requirement  to  use  designated 
apps. This group of staff included those who did not own 
a smartphone or were unable to operate one, older staff 
and those belonging to a lower cadre (CHEWS).

owning smart phones, particularly older staff and work-
load were also seen as barriers to future use of guidance 
and apps. Additionally, reluctance to adopt new ways of 
working, and a desire for consistency were identified.

….’though  Community  Health  Extension  Workers 
were  excluded  from  the  project.’  (Interview,  Female, 
Nurse).

Participants  reported  that  notes  from  patients’  consul-
tation  appointments  were  currently  kept  in  paper  form. 
They also expressed that use of the paper version of the 
mhGAP-IG  v1.0  was  not  routinely  embedded  into  cur-
rent clinical practice. This was despite a perception that 
it was easy to deploy due to its diagnostic and treatment 
algorithms.  Reasons  given  for  its  low  utility  were  time 
and  work  conflicts,  as  well  as  a  perception  that  it  may 
appear unprofessional to consult a paper guidance during 
patients’ consultation.

‘Mostly  we  don’t  have  time  to  use  it  (Apps  and 
Guidelines)  during  work  hours;  that  is  the  fact.’ 
(Focus group participant, Female, CHEW).

Theme 2: Future practice

This theme related to potential facilitators and barriers to 
future deployment of the app.

Facilitators  of  future  use  of  guidelines  and  apps  in  pri-
mary  care  Several  participants  suggested  that  future 
utilization  of  paper  guidelines  including  the  mhGAP-IG 
v1.0  may  be  facilitated  by  incorporating  helpful  algo-
rithms  that  could  be  visibly  positioned  in  consulting 
areas. The potential for the mhGAP-IG to be accessed via 
smartphone or tablet (e-mhGAP-IG) was seen as positive 
and  preferred  to  the  existing  paper  version.  Many  staff 
reported  having  smartphones  which  they  carry  around 
and  frequently  use.  Participants  identified  several  ben-
efits  of  an  e-mhGAP-IG:  including  better  accessibility, 
ease of use, potential to incorporate support and supervi-
sion,  and  the  device  (smartphone  or  tablet)  being  more 
prestigious as a clinical practice tool. They perceived that 
the emhGAP-IG will be more acceptable to patients.

‘…I feel that at times, the phone may be faulty. I will 
prefer to use paper because if the phone should be 
faulty, I can still be able to refer to it [the mhGAP-
IG] on paper. It [the paper version of the mhGAP-
IG] is easy to refer to, and then paper is more con-
stant than phone….’ (Interview, Female CHO).

Facilitators  of  a  future  app-based  mhGAP-IG  Several 
focus group and interview participants reported the need for 
improved support and supervision for their clinical work. Cur-
rent  supervision  and  support  are  typically  unstructured  and 
provided by a supervisory general practitioner to a group of 
6–8 clinics in a local government area. Participants reported 
that there was low availability of supervisors as well as limited 
supervisory sessions due to the time required by supervisory 
physicians  to  travel  to  conduct  such  sessions.  Participants 
reported  enthusiasm  about  the  potential  for  a  smartphone 
mhGAP-IG in facilitating support and supervision.

‘Supervision too can be there when there is a check-
list  there.  And  anytime  you  want  to  supervise,  that 
one  [the  supervision  interphase]  will  give  you  the 
clue  of  what  and  what  you  are  looking  for  like  the 
time we were asked to go for the supervision after the 
training  of  SPECTRA  (another  health  programme).’ 
(Focus group participant, Female, Nurse).

Several  of  the  interview  participants  reported  that  use 
of e-mhGAP-IG would be facilitated by training of staff. 
There  was  a  suggestion  that  training  should  involve  all 
staff  regardless  of  their  organisational  level.  Participants 
stressed  that  CHEWs  should  be  not  excluded,  as  had 
happened  previously,  and  highlighted  the  value  of  their 
inclusion  due  to  their  regular  smart  phone  use.  Partici-
pants also reported about a positive previous experience 
of  training  all  cadre  of  staff  in  an  antenatal  care  pro-
gramme. Participants also linked staff trainability and use 
of an app-based mhGAP-IG to a younger age of the staff 
as well as interest in using smartphones.

‘To me, putting it [the mhGAP-IG] on the electron-
ics  is  better  in  the  sense  that  it  will  make  it  easy 
for people to go through it [the mhGAP-IG] at any 
time of the day’ (Interview, Female, Nurse).

‘The only thing [factor] that can solve that problem 
[of  lack  of  use  of  the  emhGAP-IG]  is  there  will  be 
training,  there  must  be  a  training  on  that  aspect 
[the  app]  before  applying  it  [the  emhGAP-IG]…’ 
(Interview, Female, Nurse).

Barriers  to  future  use  of  guidelines  and  apps  in  primary 
care  Barriers  identified  previously  such  as  not  all  staff 

Several  participants  reported  that  the  emhGAP-IG 
should  be  introduced  to  patients  both  during  a  health

education  session  conducted  before  actual  clinical  con-
sultation  and  during  routine  consultations.  The  need 
to  explain  the  process,  and  benefits  of  using  the  app  to 
patients was stressed. Explaining the process of use of the 
e-mhGAP-IG  was  perceived  to  be  important  to  gener-
ate patient acceptability of the tool as well as confidence 
in the skills of the healthcare worker and their ability to 
make  correct  decisions  about  their  health  conditions. 
It  was  felt  that  this  would  provide  assurance  that  use  of 
the  e-mhGAP-IG  during  consultation  would  be  to  the 
patients’ overall benefit.

‘You  know,  before  you  start  with  the  patient,  you 
can  explain  to  them  that  once  they  [service  users] 
see  you  [the  provider]  doing  things  on  the  phone, 
they [service users] should not think you [provider] 
are not listening to them [service users]. It is actu-
ally for their [ervice users] good. You [the provider] 
tell them [service users] that answers to some of the 
questions  they  [service  users]  ask,  may  be  found 
on  the  device  on  your  hand  as  the  health  worker.’ 
(Interview, Female, CHO).

Theme 3: Design suggestions

This theme was not associated with sub-themes.

Participants  suggested  several  design  features  that 
would  facilitate  use  of  an  e-mhGAP-IG.  The  need  for 
easy navigability was suggested, as was the inclusion of 
a reference guide, training videos, patient recovery sto-
ries, a checklist of signs and symptoms, a client follow-
up system as well as support and supervision systems.

‘Video  of  somebody  depressed  but  has  overcome 
it [depression] can be of help, by letting them [ser-
vice users] see it [recovery story] that they [service 
users]  can  come  out  of  that  problem  [depression] 
if  they  [service  users]  cooperate  with  us  [provid-
ers],  and  also  true  life  experience  can  help,  that 
will  serve  as  client  expert  interview…’(Interview, 
Female, Nurse).
‘….just like the NURI (another programme) app, the 
checklist  [of  signs  and  symptoms]  should  be  there 
[the  emhGAP-IG  app]…’(Focus  group  participant, 
Female, Nurse).

Discussion
We  have  found  in  the  present  study  that  smartphone-
based apps were used in Nigerian primary care settings, 
but  for  purposes  other  than  clinical  consultation  and 
decision  making.  Use  of  designated  apps  in  these  set-
tings  was  facilitated  by  official  directives,  which  were 

complied  with  by  most  staff.  However,  it  was  suggested 
that older staff (i.e., closer to retirement), those who were 
unable  operate  a  smartphone,  and  those  belonging  to  a 
lower  organisation  cadre  (CHEWs)  were  often  exempt 
from  official  directives  to  use  designated  smartphone-
based apps. Even though it was part of patients and staff 
expectation to use clinical guidelines for their work, the 
mhGAP-IG  v1.0  (paper  mhGAP-IG)  and  other  exist-
ing paper guidelines were not fully embedded in current 
practice. A smartphone based mhGAP-IG was preferred 
to the paper format and it was perceived that future use 
would  be  facilitated  by  training  and  re-training  of  staff, 
helpful  design  features,  and  obtaining  patients  support 
by  explaining  the  process,  as  well  as  the  benefits  during 
clinical contact.

Our  findings  are  in  keeping  with  previous  reports 
from  other  LMICs.  For  example,  a  similarly  designed 
study  conducted  as  part  of  the  EMILIA  project  in  cen-
tral Nepal [15] reported that PHCW demonstrated high 
levels of interest in a mobile app-based clinical guidance 
(mhGAP-IG v2.0) to support the identification and treat-
ment of mental health disorders. Apart from convenience 
and  ease  of  use,  primary  health  care  workers  in  Nepal 
also saw the possibility for remote supervision as a poten-
tial benefit of the mhGAP-IG v2.0 [15]. Important differ-
ences in result of the two studies is that while PHCW in 
Nigeria and Nepal expressed enthusiasm with the e-ver-
sion of mhGAP-IG, there were concerns in Nigeria about 
phone  reliability,  as  well  as  reluctance  by  some  staff, 
especially those nearing retirement, to adopt new ways of 
working.

Other  LMICs  studies  on  use  of  digital  technology 
in  healthcare  [20–22]  have  tended  to  focus  on  health 
domains  other  than  mental  health.  In  an  exploratory 
mixed method process evaluation sub-study to a cluster 
RCT on the impact on mobile phones on HIV/AIDS care 
in  rural  Uganda  [21],  qualitative  data  suggested  broad 
support  by  frontline  healthcare  workers  for  the  use  of 
mobile phone applications to support their work. Similar 
to our findings, the Uganda study [21] also found phone 
reliability as a key barrier to mobile application use. Cur-
rent  use  of  mobile  technology  by  frontline  healthcare 
workers  in  Uganda  [21]  and  other  LMICs  [20]  was  also 
for  purposes  other  than  clinical  consultation  and  deci-
sion making.

We  note  that  healthcare  workers  included  in  the  pre-
sent  study  had  received  training  on  the  mhGAP-IG 
v1.0  and  were  expected  to  deploy  the  tool  for  identifi-
cation  and  treatment  of  mental  disorders  in  primary 
care.  However,  despite  training  and  official  expectations 
to  use  clinical  guidelines  for  their  work,  the  use  of  the 
mhGAP-IG  v.1.0  and  other  existing  paper  guidelines 
were not embedded in current practice. A similar finding 

Ojagbemi et al. BMC Primary Care          (2022) 23:264

has been reported in Nepal [23] where despite an initial 
increase in detection rates for mental disorders after the 
introduction  of  the  mhGAP-IG  v.1.0,  rates  of  detection 
reduced  substantially  two  years  later.  This  finding  sug-
gests that despite an initial excitement with the introduc-
tion of the mhGAP-IG v.1.0, use of the clinical guidance 
was not embedded in day-to-day practice. Due to previ-
ous  observations  of  what  is  often  referred  to  as  ‘novelty 
effects’  of  new  interventions  [20,  23],  it  is  imperative  to 
exercise caution about the enthusiasm expressed by pri-
mary healthcare workers in the present study around the 
perceived benefits and potential acceptability of a smart-
phone-based  clinical  guidance  such  as  the  mhGAP-IG 
v2.0.  Some  authors  [20]  have  suggested  the  deployment 
of a user-centred design process to embed new interven-
tions  in  primary  and  community  care.  In  this  process, 
frontline  healthcare  workers  are  continually  engaged, 
feedback  on  their  performance  while  at  the  same  time 
taking note of their experience, contexts and constraints 
of use. As reported by participants in the present study, a 
somewhat similar process of engagement (i.e., calls from 
supervisors if not complying with directives to use desig-
nated apps) is currently in place in Nigerian primary care 
settings.  As  reported,  this  process  has  led  to  substantial 
compliance with official directives, and healthcare work-
ers are getting used to the new way of working.

We identified other potential barriers to implementing 
smartphone-based  clinical  guidance  and  decision-mak-
ing tools in Nigerian primary care settings. For example, 
we found that it was part of patients’ expectation for staff 
not  to  use  their  phones  during  consultation.  Further-
more,  and  similar  to  existing  paper  guidance,  time  and 
work  conflict  in  busy  clinics  may  not  afford  the  average 
primary  healthcare  worker  sufficient  time  to  consult  a 
smartphone-based  decision-making  tool.  Also,  the  cur-
rently  embedded  practice  of  paper  recording  of  clini-
cal  consultation  would  require  that  healthcare  workers 
duplicate  records  of  the  smartphone  consultation  in  a 
paper format, thus adding to consultation time.

Time and work-related conflict as well as limited famili-
arity with smartphone use especially by older health care 
workers have often been reported in the global literature 
as  key  barriers  to  deployment  of  mobile  technology.  In 
a  systematic  review  of  published  literature  from  Europe, 
North  America  and  Asia,  Berenguer  and  Colleagues 
(2017)  found  that  in  general,  older  people  showed  sub-
stantial  barriers  to  smartphone  adoption.  According  to 
the  same  study,  those  adopting  smartphones  often  use 
it  for  calls  and  text  messaging,  and  rarely  did  they  use 
downloaded applications [24]. Studies conducted in India 
[25] and Nepal [25] also report poor staff familiarity with 
smartphones as a key barrier to the delivery of mental care 

by frontline healthcare workers using the platform. Apart 
from technology gaps, lack of the required infrastructure 
such  as  broadband  and  power  supply,  cost  of  running 
mobile  phones,  lack  of  policy  support  and  patients  con-
cern about confidentiality and safety of their information 
ranked among the other top barriers to the deployment of 
digital technology for healthcare in LMICs [22].

Participants  suggested  important  ways  to  scale  the 
barriers  to  future  use  of  app-based  guidance  including 
the  emhGAP-IG  in  Nigerian  primary  care  settings.  For 
example, it was suggested that use of emhGAP-IG could 
be  facilitated  by  training  of  staff,  incorporating  support 
and  supervision,  as  well  as  explaining  the  reasons  and 
process  of  its  use  before  and  during  usual  consultation. 
In keeping with primary care workers suggestion on the 
facilitatory effect of training, a systematic review on the 
feasibility and effectiveness of mobile health strategies for 
frontline health workers in LMICs [20] reported from 27 
eligible  studies  that  after  adequate  training  of  frontline 
healthcare workers, they were able to use mobile technol-
ogy  to  provide  a  variety  of  healthcare  interventions.  An 
important  finding  in  the  present  study  is  the  report  of 
participants suggesting that training of healthcare work-
ers  on  the  use  of  a  future  smartphone-based  decision-
making tool should be a reoccurring event.

Similar to findings in the present study, the prior Nepal 
study also reported that regular supervision from mental 
health  specialists  was  an  important  facilitator  of  use  of 
mobile technology by frontline healthcare workers [15]. A 
key difference reflecting contexts of supervision in the two 
countries is the aspiration of Nigerian PHCW for super-
vision  by  general  practitioners,  rather  than  by  mental 
health specialists, to be more embedded in their practice. 
Incorporating  support  and  supervision  in  a  smartphone 
mhGAP-IG may be facilitatory in several ways. First, sup-
port  and  supervision  of  clinical  activities  are  currently 
inadequate in Nigerian primary health settings. The cur-
rent  practice  is  for  a  supervisory  general  practitioner  to 
provide unstructured support to a group of 6–8 primary 
health clinics in a local government area. However, actual 
supervisory  sessions  are  rarely  provided  due  to  the  time 
required  by  supervisory  physicians  to  travel  to  conduct 
such sessions. Another way in which remote supervision 
may  facilitate  adoption  of  a  smartphone  mhGAP-IG  is 
through healthcare workers cognizance of remote of over-
sight by a supervisor with mental health training who, as 
was reported in the present study, may be able to call the 
healthcare  worker  at  any  time  may  encourage  use  of  the 
app. The main limitation of the present study is that it was 
conducted among staff in 12 PHCs in Southwestern Nige-
ria,  and  as  such  findings  may  not  be  generalisable  to  all 
Nigerian primary health care settings.

Conclusion
We have found that the emhGAP-IG would be preferred 
to  the  paper  format  by  PHCWs  in  our  study  settings.  It 
would appear from our findings that emhGAP-IG could 
be a viable way to embed clinical guidance and decision-
making  tools  for  mental  healthcare  in  the  Nigerian  pri-
mary  health  system.  Future  use  of  the  e-mhGAP-IG 
would  be  facilitated  by  training  and  re-training  of  staff, 
helpful  design  features,  and  obtaining  patients  support 
by explaining the process, and the benefits during clinical 
contact. Embedding clinical guidance in primary health-
care  may  result  in  sustained  improvement  in  detec-
tion  rates  and  treatment  of  mental  health  conditions  in 
LMICs.
