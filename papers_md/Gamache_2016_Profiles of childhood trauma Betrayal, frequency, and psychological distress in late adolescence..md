Abstract

Objective—With an emphasis on betrayal trauma, this study used latent profile analysis to 
examine how childhood traumas co-occur and whether trauma patterns differentially predicted 
psychological distress.

Method—A community sample of 806 adolescents and young adults participated. Youths 
reported their trauma histories, and lifetime DSM–IV disorders were assessed using a structured 
diagnostic interview.

Results—Latent profile analysis yielded 5 profiles: high-betrayal trauma physical violence and 
emotional abuse (HBTPE), high-betrayal trauma sexual and emotional abuse (HBTSE), low-
betrayal trauma (LBT), parent death (PD), and a no/low trauma profile. Logistic regression 
analyses compared youths in the no/low trauma profile to those in the trauma profiles. Youths in 
the HBTPE profile were more likely to have moderate/severe major depressive disorder (odds 
ratio [OR] = 2.92, 95% CI = 1.16, 7.32), posttraumatic stress disorder (OR = 4.33, 95% CI = 1.34, 
14.03), and hallucinations (OR = 5.03, 95% CI = 2.00, 12.67); youths in the HBTSE and LBT 
profiles were more likely to experience hallucinations (OR = 3.19, 95% CI = 1.21, 8.39 and OR = 
3.20, 95% CI = 1.01, 10.19, respectively); and youths in the PD profile were more likely to have 
moderate/severe depression (OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.07, 5.43).

Conclusions—Specific trauma types co-occurred when considering type, level of betrayal, and 
frequency. The emergence of the two high-betrayal trauma profiles, with differing symptom 
presentations, suggests that experiences of high-betrayal traumas are not homogenous and specific 
trauma-focused interventions may be more appropriate for differing trauma profiles.

Adverse and traumatic events occur frequently among youths. Epidemiological research 
indicates that between 58% and 90% of youths have experienced at least one trauma, with 
the majority of trauma survivors experiencing multiple traumatic events (Breslau, 
Reboussin, Anthony, & Storr, 2005; Finkelhor, Turner, Shattuck, & Hamby, 2013). Greater 
trauma frequency, severity, and duration typically result in worse outcomes, but when 
examined across studies, the magnitude with which these factors impact psychological 
outcomes varies (Briere & Jordan, 2009). Assessment of cumulative trauma exposure (i.e., 
the aggregate number of different trauma types experienced) has been an effective approach 
to examining the typical multitype trauma profile. Compared with survivors exposed to a 
single trauma type, survivors of cumulative trauma experience more complex and chronic 
psychological problems (Cloitre et al., 2009; Ford, Elhai, Connor, & Frueh, 2010; Ford, 
Grasso, Hawke, & Chapman, 2013; Richmond, Elliot, Pierce, Aspelmeier, & Alexander, 
2009). Despite evidence for an incremental relationship between each additional adversity 
experienced and more severe outcomes, the dose–response effects of cumulative trauma are 
confounded by severity and the subadditive impact (i.e., the full effect is less than the sum of 
its parts) of multitype trauma (Green et al., 2010; Kessler et al., 2010; McLaughlin, Green, 
et al., 2012; Schilling, Aseltine, & Gore, 2008). These findings suggest that not all traumas 
affect psychological outcomes with equal magnitude.

Betrayal trauma theory (Freyd, 1996; Freyd, DePrince, & Gleaves, 2007) emphasizes the 
relational context within which trauma occurs. A betrayal trauma is an interpersonal trauma 
perpetrated by a trusted caregiver or significant other. For example, physical abuse and 
sexual abuse perpetrated by caregivers are more highly significant betrayals than are 
victimizations perpetrated by strangers or individuals in situations in which trust or reliance 
on the perpetrator for physical or emotional needs is absent. Compared with other trauma 
types, traumas involving higher levels of betrayal have consistently been associated with 
greater symptom severity across various mental health outcomes, including depression, 
anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and hallucinations (Edwards, Freyd, Dube, Anda, & Felitti, 
2012; Freyd, Klest, & Allard, 2005; Goldsmith, Chesney, Heath, & Barlow, 2013; Gómez, 
Kaehler, & Freyd, 2014; Green et al., 2010; McLaughlin, Green, et al., 2012,). Moreover, 
when the cumulative number of different trauma types is examined by level of betrayal, 
cumulative traumas higher in betrayal are a stronger predictor of trauma-related symptoms 
compared to cumulative traumas lower in betrayal (Martin, Cromer, DePrince, & Freyd, 
2013). Although these studies further suggest that some trauma types (i.e., high-betrayal 
traumas) may be more harmful than others, they lack specificity because they have relied on 
categorization approaches that do not allow for a systematic examination of how different 
trauma types co-occur.

Person-centered analytic approaches, such as latent profile analysis, can be used to examine 
how multiple trauma types co-occur by identifying distinct subpopulations (Laursen & Hoff, 
2006). Research that has integrated a person-centered approach confirms that trauma

survivors often experience more than one trauma type, with some tending to experience 
multiple different trauma types and a more complex symptom presentation (Ford et al., 
2010; Ford et al., 2013). However, these studies have tended to classify trauma exposure 
categorically in terms of presence or absence, limiting our understanding of how various 
trauma types co-occur when considering other dimensions, such as frequency. Moreover, 
they have not assessed the relational closeness to the perpetrator, and thus, it remains 
unknown whether evidenced subgroup differences are solely due to patterns of co-occurring 
trauma. Our study extends prior research by examining profiles of co-occurring childhood 
traumas in terms of frequency and level of betrayal. We also examine whether the distinct 
trauma profiles differentially predict psychological outcomes in a racially/ethnically diverse, 
community sample of at-risk youths. Consistent with other researchers who have 
incorporated person-centered analyses (Ford et al., 2010), we did not make specific 
hypotheses that connected trauma profiles to psychiatric outcomes prior to the analyses, 
because the latent profile analysis was exploratory. However, we expected that profiles that 
included multiple trauma types and more high-betrayal traumas would be associated with 
greater psychological distress.

Methods

Participants and Procedure

Participants were 806 adolescents and young adults who, as pre-adolescents, had 
participated (N = 998) in a randomized prevention trial of a family-based program designed 
to prevent antisocial behavior (Dishion & Kavanagh, 2003; Dishion, Kavanagh, Schneiger, 
Nelson, & Kaufman, 2002). In the original study, parents of all sixth-grade students in two 
cohorts starting school in 1996 or 1998 were approached for participation; 90% (N =998) of 
invited families consented to participate. Youths attended one of three middle schools in an 
ethnically diverse, urban community in the northwestern United States and were randomly 
assigned at the individual level to either the control or intervention condition. Data for this 
study were collected postintervention while youths were transitioning to adulthood. The 
retention rate was approximately 80%, with 807 youths participating. One participant's data 
were excluded from the analyses because he did not complete the childhood trauma 
inventory. Compared with the full sample, the individuals in the current subsample were 
more likely to be female, χ2(1, N = 998) = 13.46, p < .001, and less likely to have been 
identified as at high risk at the baseline assessment, χ2(1, N = 998) = 5.17, p = .02.

Participants were primarily 18–19 years old (M = 19.06, SD = 0.69, range = 17–21; 50% 
female), and they self-identified as 43% Caucasian (n = 347), 30% African American (n = 
242), and 27% multiracial/other minority (n = 217). The majority (70%) had obtained a high 
school diploma or GED, and approximately 60% of those who had not were currently 
enrolled in school and were between age 17 and 18. A majority lived with parents or a 
relative (73%); the remaining participants lived with romantic partners or roommates (21%), 
alone (3%), or were in the military, homeless, or had alternative living situations (3%). A 
minority of participants reported having their own children (10%).

All study procedures were approved by the (University of Oregon) Institutional Review 
Board. Parent and youth consent was obtained prior to participation. All measures and

assessments were completed by the youths at the time of the current study. Measures 
completed by parents (family SES and parental depression) were collected at a prior wave of 
data collection, when the youths were approximately 17 years old.

Measures

Trauma history—A modified version of the Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey (BBTS; 
Goldberg & Freyd, 2006) was used to assess the frequency of childhood trauma exposure 
and level of betrayal involved in different trauma types before age 18. The measure was 
modified in that participants self-reported trauma frequency on a 4-point scale: 0 (never), 1 
(once), 2 (2–5 times), and 3 (6–10 times), and an item assessing the death of a child was 
modified to assess the death of a caregiver. Traumas were classified as low, moderate, or 
high in betrayal based on guidelines established by Freyd (2008). Three items assessed for 
low–betrayal traumas, which typically lack an interpersonal component, such as natural 
disasters, or involve witnessing violence perpetrated by someone the respondent is “not 
close” to. Five items assessed for moderate–betrayal traumas which include witnessed 
traumas perpetrated by someone “very close” to the respondent or interpersonal traumas 
perpetrated by someone the respondent was “not close” to. Three items assessed for high–
betrayal traumas which include interpersonal traumas perpetrated by someone “very close” 
to the respondent. Witnessed traumas were those during which the victim was severely 
injured and suffered bruises, burns, or other physical injury. The BBTS has good construct 
and convergent validity (DePrince & Freyd, 2001; Martin et al., 2013) and test–retest 
reliability (Goldberg & Freyd, 2006).

Diagnostic assessment—Trained assessors administered the Composite International 
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI; World Health Organization; 1997), a fully structured diagnostic 
interview that is used to assess psychiatric disorders by using the definitions and criteria of 
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; 
American Psychiatric Association; 1994). Lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders and 
symptoms frequently associated with trauma exposure, including major depressive disorder 
(MDD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social phobia, and hallucinations, were 
assessed. All disorders and hallucinations were coded 1 (present) or 0 (absent). 
Hallucinations were assessed using two items assessing auditory and visual hallucinations 
and were considered present if one or both types of hallucinations were endorsed. Clinical-
level symptom significance and exclusion criteria were assessed for endorsed symptoms by 
using the probe flowchart. Participant age, gender, race/ethnicity, and education were also 
obtained from the CIDI.

Covariates—Gender, race/ethnicity, education, SES, and parent depression have each been 
associated with the diagnosis of mental health disorders (McLaughlin et al., 2011; 
McLaughlin, Gadermann, et al., 2012; Minsky et al., 2006; Seedat et al., 2009); thus, they 
were included as control variables in our study. Intervention group status was not included 
as a covariate because there were no significant differences with respect to the participants' 
psychological sequelae based on intervention group status.

When the youths were approximately 17 years old, their parents reported about parent 
education, employment level, gross annual income, use of financial aid, and housing type. 
This information was used to create a standardized composite score for family SES (M = .
00, SD = .72). At this time, parents also completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies 
Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), and we used the CES-D to account for the effects 
of parent depression on participant psychological distress. The CES-D is a 20-item self-
report checklist of depressive symptoms. Mothers and fathers were asked to consider their 
experiences during the past week and rate the frequency with which they had experienced 
each item on a scale ranging from 0 (rarely or none of the time) to 3 (most or all of the 
time).The CES-D has demonstrated good construct validity and reliability (Radloff, 1977). 
The coefficient alpha in our study sample was .90 for mothers and .85 for fathers.

Analytic Strategy

Latent profile analysis (LPA), a person-centered analysis, was conducted to determine 
whether distinct patterns of trauma exposure had been experienced. We used a stepwise 
procedure to test the profiles. The optimal number of profiles was selected using various 
model fit indicators and identifying the interpretability of each profile on the basis of mean 
frequency trauma scores. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC), the sample size-
adjusted BIC, and the Akaike information criteria (AIC) are based on the log likelihood 
function and balance goodness of fit with parsimony. Lower values or the smallest decrease 
in value between successive models indicate the best fit. The Bootstrapped Likelihood Ratio 
Test (BLRT) compares the fit of the current, more complex model to that of the prior, less 
complex model. A significant value indicates that the current model has a better fit. Entropy 
indicates the accuracy of profile assignment, with values greater than 80% considered 
acceptable. The BIC and BLRT have been found to be the best model fit indicators for 
determining the optimal number of profiles (Nylund, Asparouhov, & Muthén, 2007) and 
were thus relied upon more heavily while selecting the best-fitting model. After model 
selection, logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine profile membership as 
predictors of trauma-related disorders and symptoms, controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, 
education, family SES, and parent depression. All primary analyses were conducted using 
Mplus version 7 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2012). Post-hoc analyses were performed using 
PASW Statistics 17.

Results

Trauma Prevalence Rates

In line with epidemiological studies of trauma (e.g., Finkelhor et al., 2013) 62% of the 
participants in this sample indicated that they had experienced at least one childhood trauma. 
Approximately 40% had experienced one type of trauma, 25% had experienced two, 14% 
had experienced three, and 21% had experienced four or more types. In terms of the 
frequency of specific trauma types by level of betrayal, 58% had experienced at least one 
low betrayal trauma, 65% had experienced at least one moderate betrayal trauma, and 47% 
of the participants had experienced at least one high betrayal trauma. Table 1 depicts rates of 
exposure by trauma type.

Models with two to six profiles were tested (Table 2). Entropy was acceptable for each 
model. The BLRT indicated that each model had a significantly better fit than did the prior 
model. All the information criteria indicators indicated that the five-profile model had the 
best fit, because the values from the six-profile model increased from those of the five-
profile model and the values for the five-profile model were the lowest. The five-profile 
solution was reviewed for substantive meaning and selected as the best-fitting model.

Figure 1 illustrates the mean frequency of trauma type across the five profiles. The first 
profile, which comprised the majority of the sample (75%), was labeled no/low trauma. Half 
of the individuals in this profile reported not having experienced any of the trauma types, 
and the other half endorsed having experienced one or more trauma types, with the mean 
frequency for each trauma at less than one. The second profile comprised approximately 5% 
of the sample and was labeled high-betrayal trauma physical violence and emotional abuse 
(HBTPE) because the participants in this profile had experienced multiple forms of 
interpersonal trauma, including physical abuse and emotional abuse perpetrated by 
individuals close to them, physical abuse perpetrated by nonclose individuals, and 
witnessing severe assaults of individuals both close and not close. These trauma types were 
experienced more than once. For detailed information on frequency refer to the 
Supplemental Table. Another 6% of the sample was grouped into the third profile, labeled 
high-betrayal trauma sexual and emotional abuse (HBTSE). These individuals had 
experienced multiple instances of emotional abuse and sexual abuse by perpetrators they 
were close to. The fourth profile, labeled low-betrayal trauma (LBT), comprised 4% of the 
sample; these individuals had experienced loss or injury by means of natural disasters and 
had witnessed violence between nonclose others. The final profile, labeled parent death 
(PD), comprised 9% of the sample; these individuals had primarily experienced the death of 
a parent. One trauma type was not frequently experienced in any of the five profiles: loss or 
injury following an accident.

A multinomial logistic regression was run to examine profile membership differences 
among the control variables. Compared with the no/low trauma profile, youths in the 
HBTSE profile were significantly less likely to be in school (b = −1.11, p = .003) and those 
in the PD profile were significantly less likely to be Caucasian (b = −1.08, p = .001) and 
their fathers had significantly higher levels of depression (b = 0.06, p = .04).

Trauma Profiles and Posttraumatic Distress

Results from the logistic regression analyses suggest that trauma profile membership 
predicts lifetime prevalence of multiple trauma-related disorders and symptoms (Table 3). 
The reference group for these analyses was the no/low trauma profile. Youths in the HBTPE 
profile had a significantly increased likelihood of meeting diagnostic criteria for moderate/
severe MDD and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and they also had a greater 
likelihood of experiencing hallucinations. Those in the HBTSE and LBT profiles had a 
significantly greater likelihood of experiencing hallucinations, but they did not have a 
significantly greater likelihood of meeting diagnostic criteria for the trauma-related 
disorders. Those in the PD profile had an increased likelihood of meeting diagnostic criteria

for moderate/severe MDD. In comparison with the no/low trauma profile, individuals 
comprising the four trauma profiles did not have an increased likelihood for meeting 
diagnostic criteria for mild MDD or social phobia.

We conducted post-hoc analyses to examine the lack of a significant relationship between 
being in the HBTSE profile and meeting diagnostic criteria for PTSD. In examining the 
criteria for PTSD, there were no significant differences between individuals in the HBTPE, 
HBTSE, or LBT profiles in meeting the 3 symptom-driven criteria (Criteria B, C, and D): 
re-experiencing (X2 (2, N = 100) = 2.14, p = .34), avoidance (X2 (2, N = 67) = 0.55, p = .76), 
or arousal (X2 (2, N = 78) = 0.91, p = .63) symptoms. However, when examining Criteria A1 
and A2, the criteria that establish the stressor as meeting the threshold of a trauma sufficient 
for a possible PTSD diagnosis, the percentage of individuals from the HBTSE profile that 
met Criteria A1 and A2 (46%) was significantly less than those in the HBTPE (76%) and 
LBT (77%) profiles (X2 (2, N = 125) = 11.73, p < .01). Moreover, for individuals whose 
traumas met the threshold for Criteria A1 and A2, individuals from the HBTPE (t(402) = 
3.76, p < .001) and HBTSE (t(402) = 2.32, p = .02) profiles, but not the LBT trauma profile 
(t(402) =0.27, p = .79), endorsed significantly more PTSD symptoms compared to 
individuals from the no/low trauma profile. Thus, a greater percentage of individuals from 
the HBTSE profile did not qualify for a PTSD diagnosis because the traumas they 
experienced did not meet the DSM-IV's definition of a trauma and were not accompanied 
with feelings of fear, helplessness, or horror.

Discussion

The adolescents and young adults in this study had experienced meaningful patterns of 
trauma based on level of betrayal. Four trauma profiles were found: HBTPE, HBTSE, LBT, 
and PD, as well as a low trauma profile, in which little to no trauma exposure was endorsed. 
Although these profiles largely resemble the theory-based subscales or categories of high-, 
moderate-, and low-betrayal trauma (Freyd, 2008), some important distinctions emerged by 
using a latent analytic approach that considered trauma frequency and co-occurrence of 
trauma types across level of betrayal. First, individuals who would typically be categorized 
into the high-betrayal trauma group based on the traditional scoring guidelines were 
classified into two distinct profiles: HBTPE or HBTSE. Individuals in the HBTPE profile 
had experienced multiple interpersonal trauma types, including physical abuse, emotional 
abuse, and witnessing severe forms of violence, with each trauma type tending to be 
experienced more than once and perpetrated by people considered to be both close and not 
close. In contrast, individuals in the HBTSE predominantly experienced repeated sexual 
abuse and emotional abuse perpetrated by someone close to them. Second, none of the 
profiles that emerged solely represented moderate betrayal traumas. Instead, the individuals 
who tended to experience moderate level betrayal traumas also tended to experience high 
physical and emotional betrayal-traumas and were classified in the HBTPE profile. This 
finding is consistent with the significant and positive correlations found between high-
betrayal and moderate-betrayal trauma scores, whereas similar correlations have not been 
found between high-betrayal and low-betrayal trauma scores (Martin et al., 2013; Kaehler & 
Freyd, 2012). Finally, the PD profile emerged as a unique trauma profile, with individuals in

this profile having experienced the death of a primary caregiver with little other trauma 
exposure.

At first glance, the emergence of the two high-betrayal trauma profiles, one with high rates 
of physical and emotional abuse and witnessing violence (HBTPE) and the other with high 
rates of sexual and emotional abuse might seem at odds with the extant literature. For 
example, in a nationally representative sample, Finkelhor and colleagues (Finkelhor, 
Ormrod, & Turner, 2007) found that of the children they termed polyvictimized, who had 
experienced four or more different trauma types, 35% had experienced a sexual trauma. 
Individuals belonging to the HBTPE profile resemble such a polyvictimized sample as they 
experienced a mean of 4.95 (SD = 1.62) different trauma types. Although the most common 
trauma types experienced were physical and emotional abuse and witnessed physical 
violence, 26% of the individuals in this profile also experienced sexual abuse by a 
perpetrator they were not close to and 5% by a perpetrator they were close to, equivalent to 
the 35% found by Finkelhor and colleagues (2007). Likewise, individuals in the HBTSE 
profile also experienced other trauma types, experiencing an average of 3.81 (SD = 2.17) 
different trauma types. However, the frequency of these other trauma types was not as great 
in the HBTSE profile as they were in the HBTPE profile (Table 1). The difference in our 
study is that when examining how different trauma types naturally co-occur while 
simultaneously considering the frequency of each trauma type, some individuals 
experienced multiple different trauma types and higher frequencies of witnessing violent 
traumas and experiencing physical and emotional abuse, while other individuals experienced 
lower frequencies of these types of traumas and higher frequencies of sexual abuse, 
particularly perpetrated by someone close. These profiles emerged from the data, rather than 
from our own construction of them, and despite some similarities in trauma exposure 
between them, the emergence of the two high-betrayal trauma profiles suggests that these 
individuals' experiences of trauma are not homogenous. Further, other studies using a latent 
analytic approach (e.g., Ford et al., 2010) have likewise found distinct classes of sexually 
and physically abused adolescents.

Despite some similarities across these heterogeneous profiles, differential patterns of 
psychological distress were found based on trauma profile membership. The increased odds 
among individuals in the HBTPE and HBTSE profiles for meeting diagnostic criteria for 
trauma-related disorders or experiencing hallucinations is consistent with betrayal trauma 
theory. The traumas experienced in these profiles were largely interpersonal and often 
perpetrated by someone close. Compared to individuals in the no/low trauma profile, those 
in the HBTPE profile had a higher likelihood of meeting diagnostic criteria for moderate/
severe MDD and PTSD and a higher likelihood of experiencing hallucinations; individuals 
in the HBTSE and LBT profiles experienced more hallucinations, while those in the PD 
profile had a significantly higher likelihood of meeting criteria for moderate/severe MDD.

In comparison with those in the no/low trauma profile, individuals in the HBTSE profile 
were not more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for trauma-related disorders, including 
MDD and PTSD. The differing symptom profiles found between those in the HBTPE and 
HBTSE profiles lends further support to the idea that individuals who have experienced 
high-betrayal traumas are heterogeneous. However, in terms of PTSD, our post-hoc analyses

revealed that individuals in the HBTSE profile, who primarily experienced sexual and 
emotional abuse by perpetrators they were close to, were less likely to meet Criteria A1 and 
A2 for a PTSD diagnosis compared to individuals in the other trauma profiles. The CIDI 
question asking about experiences of rape specifies that it occur under conditions where 
threats or force were used (World Health Organization; 1997). Child sexual abuse 
perpetrated by close others often occurs without the use of explicit threat or force; instead, 
many children are groomed from a young age or made to feel that they have a special 
relationship with the perpetrator (Veldhuis & Freyd, 1999). Within such a context, traumas 
in the HBTSE profile may have been more closely associated with feelings of shame or 
betrayal rather than the requisite fear or horror required to meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria 
for PTSD (Brown & Freyd, 2008; DePrince, Chu, & Pineda, 2011). Thus, because in some 
cases individuals in the HBTSE profile did not meet the threshold for what was defined as a 
trauma (e.g., being threatened or forced during the rape) and others did not experience terror 
or helplessness, a potential diagnosis of PTSD was not further considered.

Similar to individuals in the HBTPE profile, those in the HBTSE profile who did meet the 
Criterion A1 threshold had significantly more PTSD symptoms compared to those in the 
no/low trauma profile. Provided that Criterion A2 has been eliminated from the PTSD 
diagnosis in the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), some of the HBTSE 
individuals who did not meet criteria for a PTSD diagnosis would likely qualify under 
current criteria. It may also be that the symptom presentation for those in the HBTSE profile 
more closely resembles complex PTSD, which includes the typical PTSD symptoms of 
avoidance, re-experiencing, and hyperarousal, but also incorporates poor emotional and 
behavioral regulation, interpersonal difficulties, and dissociation (Cloitre et al., 2011). 
Future research should examine whether complex PTSD symptoms would better represent 
individuals in the HBTSE profile.

Another finding of interest was that noninterpersonal traumas, such as experiencing 
significant injury or loss from a natural disaster or witnessing violence perpetrated by 
nonclose individuals, were traumas that did not tend to co-occur with other interpersonal 
traumas. This finding is consistent with prior studies that have not found an association 
between traumas higher and lower in betrayal (Martin et al., 2013). However, in a study with 
high risk youth, Ford et al. (2013) found support for the co-occurrence of interpersonal and 
non-interpersonal traumas, suggesting that additional risk factors may contribute to their co-
occurrence.

Although the individuals in the LBT profile did not have a significantly higher likelihood of 
meeting diagnostic criteria for any of the trauma-related disorders, they nonetheless 
experienced elevated levels of PTSD symptoms and also had a significantly greater 
likelihood of having hallucinations. This finding is inconsistent with prior research 
examining the association between betrayal trauma and hallucinations in college samples 
(Gómez et al., 2014). One possibility for this discrepancy could be the result of the 
individuals in our LBT profile who experienced moderate- and high-betrayal traumas in 
addition to low-betrayal traumas, but whose overall higher frequency of low-betrayal 
traumas contributed to their inclusion in the LBT profile. The use of traditional scoring

procedures would have categorized some of the individuals in the LBT profile into 
moderate- or high-betrayal trauma groups.

The findings from this study suggest that the way in which traumas co-occur is important for 
better understanding symptom and diagnostic variability, which has implications for 
informing interventions aimed at mitigating persistent, adverse reactions to trauma. 
Although individuals in the HBTSE and LBT profiles were not significantly more likely to 
meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD compared to individuals in the no/low trauma profile, 
individuals from both of the trauma profiles exhibited elevated PTSD symptoms and a 
greater likelihood of experiencing hallucinations, and they would likely benefit from 
trauma-informed care. Individuals in the HBTPE profile were more likely than those in the 
no/low trauma profile to experience trauma-related symptoms and to meet diagnostic criteria 
for MDD and PTSD. Given their high levels of psychological distress and diagnostic co-
morbidity, they may be less likely to benefit from non-trauma informed treatments. For 
example, in a study examining the effect of childhood trauma on the treatment of depression 
in adolescents, Lewis and colleagues (Lewis et al., 2010) found that the depressive 
symptoms for teens with a history of sexual abuse treated with cognitive behavioral therapy 
remained largely unchanged over the course of treatment. In accordance with meta-analytic 
findings suggesting that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is more 
effective in treating PTSD and trauma-related symptoms in sexually abused children and 
adolescents (Harvey & Taylor, 2010), Lewis et al. (2010), speculated that the teens in their 
study might require a treatment approach that better addresses the experienced trauma, such 
as TF-CBT. Moreover, specific trauma-focused interventions may be more appropriate for 
differing trauma profiles. For example, survivors belonging to the two high-betrayal trauma 
profiles may benefit more from interventions developed for complex trauma that incorporate 
sequenced therapy tailored to the specific symptom profile of the trauma survivor and that 
include components of relational healing (Cloitre et al., 2011; Ford, Steinberg, Hawke, 
Levine, & Zhang, 2012).

Study limitations should be acknowledged. First, the data are cross-sectional, so causal 
inferences cannot be confirmed. Second, the youths and young adults retrospectively 
reported their trauma histories. Some traumas may have been forgotten or occurred early in 
development and were not remembered. Because the version of the BBTS used in the 
current study does not assess timing of traumas experienced, we were unable to determine 
the temporal sequence of exposure to trauma and trauma-related symptoms. Future research 
should consider the developmental timing of the trauma exposure, which has also been 
linked to the onset and severity of poor psychological health (Manly, Kim, & Rogosch, 
2001). Third, our study was not powered to assess differences in trauma-related symptoms 
and diagnoses between the trauma profiles, and additional work is needed to examine these 
relationships, especially in clinical samples. Finally, provided that when compared to the 
original, full sample, the youths in this study were less likely to have been identified as at 
high risk at the baseline assessment, these results may not generalize to higher risk youths.

Conclusion

Page 11

This study supports prior research that has demonstrated that traumas perpetrated by trusted 
individuals or within the family are more psychologically harmful than other trauma types 
(Edwards et al., 2012; Freyd et al., 2005; Goldsmith et al., 2013; Gómez et al., 2014; Green 
et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2013; McLaughlin, Green, et al., 2012). Study results expand upon 
these findings by suggesting that trauma occurs in patterns on the basis of type, frequency, 
and level of betrayal. Specifically, individuals who witnessed physical violence and 
experienced physical and emotional abuse by individuals considered close and not close also 
tended to experience more psychological distress, including MDD and PTSD. These 
findings highlight how examining the way in which childhood traumas co-occur and relate 
to mental health in emerging adulthood is an important step in better understanding the link 
between trauma exposure and negative outcomes. The trauma survivors in this study with 
the most psychological distress tended to experience more types of high and moderate 
betrayal traumas, and to experience these traumas at higher frequencies.
