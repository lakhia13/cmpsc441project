Background. Burnout is a common psychological syndrome among nurses, especially in the frst few years of working. However,
limited studies have evaluated the factors related to burnout among junior nurses. Aims. To investigate the levels of psychological
fexibility, stress, and burnout among junior nurses and examine the role of demographic and workplace relationship factors,
psychological fexibility, and perceived stress on burnout among junior nurses. Materials and Methods. A convenience sample of 481
junior nurses was recruited from three tertiary hospitals in China from July 2021 to August 2022. Data were collected, including
demographic data, workplace relationships, psychological fexibility (measured by experiential avoidance and cognitive fusion),
perceived stress, and burnout. Te Independent t-test, one-way ANOVA, Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test, Kruskal–Wallis test,
Spearman correlation, and hierarchical regression were used to analyze the data. Results. Junior nurses had a high level of burnout in
diferent dimensions. Nurses with an undergraduate education, nurses working in the frst year, and a lack of support from su-
pervisors and poor colleague (nurse-nurse and nurse-doctor) relationships had the lowest level of psychological fexibility and the
highest level of perceived stress and burnout. Spearman correlation indicated that experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, perceived
stress, and burnout were positively associated with each other. Te regression model showed that psychological fexibility (especially
cognitive fusion) and perceived stress infuenced burnout in junior nurses. Conclusions. Higher psychological fexibility and lower
perceived stress appear to improve burnout in junior nurses. Terefore, interventions targeting these two factors may provide a viable
direction for the reduction of burnout among junior nurses. Implications for Nursing Management. Hospital authorities should create
a harmonious working environment and provide some psychology training programs for junior nurses.

1. Introduction

Burnout, as an occupational hazard, has received consid-
erable research attention in nursing over the past few years
[1]. While there is no complete consensus on how to defne
burnout, the classic structure remains to be Maslach et al.’s
description of burnout as a three-dimensional model
characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization,

and decreased personal achievement [2]. In primary care
nursing, a meta-analysis showed a prevalence of 28%, 15%,
and 31% for high emotional
exhaustion, high de-
personalization, and low personal achievement [3]. Te high
prevalence of burnout among nursing professionals is un-
questionable across diferent countries [4–7]. Lots of evi-
dence have shown that burnout is often accompanied by
anxiety, depression, and other negative emotions [8]. High

2

levels of burnout reduce the quality of care and patient
satisfaction, increase the rate of medical errors, and afect
clinical nursing outcomes [1, 5, 9]. Meanwhile, it prompts
more nurses to abandon the medical feld, which may further
exacerbate the current global shortage of nurses [10].

Junior nurses make up a large percentage of nurses and are
important human resource reserves. However, studies show
that young and inexperienced nurses are more likely to sufer
from burnout [11], and most nurses leave in the early stage of
their careers [12]. Junior nurses in China usually refer to nurses
who have worked in clinical settings for less than three years
after graduating from nursing school or university [13]. Junior
nurses need to undergo standardized training to complete the
transition to qualifed nurses. Te standardized training pro-
cess includes rotation among diferent departments, such as
internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pedi-
atrics, and emergency and intensive care unit, as well as regular
and irregular theoretical and operational examinations [14].
Te transition is difcult owing to unfamiliar working envi-
ronments, diferent professional skills, and interpersonal re-
lationship adaptation, which are signifcant physical and
psychological challenges for junior nurses [15]. Over time,
these challenges unconsciously become catalysts for their
burnout and even resignation [16].

Burnout is a complex multifactorial problem that is not
easily addressed, even among nurses. Individual-specifc factors
(such as demographic variables, stress, psychological fexibility,
personality, and coping strategies) and existing workplace
factors (like job demands,
job control, and organizational
support) have been found to have varying degrees of re-
lationships with burnout levels in numerous studies [17–21].
Te relationship between stress and burnout is obvious,
both from a psychological and biological perspective
[22, 23]. Generally, burnout is believed to be an extreme
reaction when individuals cannot smoothly cope with work
stress, and it is a state of exhausted emotions, attitudes, and
behaviors caused by individuals under long-term work
pressure [24]. Te efects of chronic stress on the functioning
of biological processes in an organism can afect psycho-
logical processes and social behavior. Tus, according to
clinical psychologists, burnout is not necessarily related to
work but to stress [25]. Results from a cross-sectional study
of 799 nurses showed that stress indirectly afected burnout
through perceived social support and psychological capital
[26]. In addition, a cross-sectional survey of new graduate
nurses revealed that 76% of participants reported moderate-
to-severe stress [27]. While some stress can be helpful,
overwhelming stress can lead to poor performance at work
and serious illnesses such as high blood pressure, depression,
and sleep disorders [28].

Psychological fexibility was defned as “the ability to
more fully engage with the present moment as a conscious
person and to change or persist in behavior in the service of
a valued goal” [28]. Psychological infexibility is the opposite
of that and mainly includes two important aspects: expe-
riential avoidance and cognitive fusion [29]. In short, ex-
periential avoidance is the tendency for individuals to avoid
or escape from some unpleasant internal mood, which could
lead to psychological distress and inefective behaviors. A

higher degree of experiential avoidance is associated with
more emotional distress and lower life function, thus re-
ducing work performance [30]. Cognitive fusion refers to the
domination of thinking in behavioral regulation over other
available processes [31]. Cognitive fusion can enhance an
individual’s believability of negative thoughts, leading to
emotional discomfort [32]. Studies have shown that the
lower the psychological fexibility was, the more the clinical
nurses were tired of their job [20]. Meanwhile, the literature
indicated a direct and predictive relationship between
psychological infexibility and burnout among nurses in the
acute phase of the epidemic [33].

Besides, organizational factors have consistently been
implicated among the complex determinants of burnout. In
a recent report, burnout was considered as a result of an
imbalance between job demands and resources [34]. Te
resources of clinicians include tangible and intangible re-
sources in the work environment, such as meaning in work,
job control, and social support from peers and supervisors.
Multiple studies have shown that, in addition to increasing
the number of nurses, changing the characteristics of the
work environment,
including training support, positive
physician-nurse relationships, nurse autonomy, and support
from supervisors, can also increase job satisfaction and
reduce burnout in nurses [35–37].

Te retention and successful transition of junior nurses
is one of the guarantees for the future stable development of
health care [38], while burnout is a stumbling block. It is
urgent to fnd ways to retain them, but there are few studies
on burnout among junior nurses. Terefore, we aimed to
investigate the levels of psychological fexibility, stress, and
burnout among junior nurses in diferent sociodemographic
and workplace relationships. Furthermore, we sought to
explore the infuence of these individual and organizational
factors on burnout among junior nurses.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Setting, Sample, and Data Collection. A cross-sectional
design was used in this study. Participants were nurses
recruited online from three tertiary hospitals in China from
July 2021 to August 2022. Te inclusion criteria for all
participants were as follows: (1) aged 18 years or older; (2)
with at most three years of work experience; and (3) pro-
vided informed consent. Te exclusion criteria included
nurses with psychological disease or who were taking a long
leave of absence (e.g., maternity leave).

Te sample size was calculated using G∗Power 3.1.9.7. In
the multiple linear regression, a fxed model and R2 de-
viation from zero were selected as the statistical method. Te
statistical signifcance level was set at α � 0.05, with an efect
size of 0.1 and a statistical power (1 − β) of 0.95, considering
a total of 12 predictors. Teoretically, a minimum sample
size of 270 was calculated.

With the assistance of the department of nursing, the call
to participate was sent to 526 targeted nurses by link via the
WeChat platform. Te nurses decided whether to participate
after reading the purpose and content of the study and had
the right to withdraw at any time. Researchers checked the

platform daily and stopped data collection once it reached
the target. Finally, we collected 481 valid questionnaires
(response rate: 91.4%) through the Wenjuanxing platform
(https://www.wjx.cn/). All questions were set as mandatory,
so there were no missing data.

2.2. Measures

2.2.1. Demographic and Workplace Factors. Demographic
data were collected, including age, gender, education level,
salary, and working experience. Workplace relationships
included the relationship between nurses, the relationship
between nurses and doctors, and the support received from
supervisors.

2.2.2. Psychological Flexibility

(1) Experiential Avoidance. Te Acceptance and Action
Questionnaire II (AAQ-II), a 7-item instrument, was used to
assess the level of experiential avoidance [30]. Te AAQ-II is
a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (never) to 7 (always). A higher
score indicates a higher level of experiential avoidance. Te
minimum and maximum total score of the scale is 7 and 49,
respectively. Cronbach’s α coefcient of the Chinese version
of AAQ-II was 0.88 [39]. Cronbach’s α of the scale was 0.95
in this study.

(2) Cognitive Fusion. Te Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire-
Fusion (CFQ-F), a 9-item instrument assessing personal
cognitive fusion, was developed by Gillanders et al. [40].
Items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (never) to 7
(always). Te possible score can range from 9 to 63, with
higher scores denoting more serious cognitive fusion.
Cronbach’s α coefcient of the Chinese version of CFQ-F
was 0.92 [41]. Cronbach’s α of the scale was 0.96 in
this study.

2.2.3. Perceived Stress. Te level of perceived stress was
assessed with the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS) [42],
which was revised from the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) [43].
Te CPSS consists of a total of 14 items, with each item rated
on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Te
total score of the CPSS scale ranges from 0 to 56, and a higher
score indicates a greater level of perceived stress. Cronbach’s
α coefcient of the CPSS was 0.84 [26]. In this study,
Cronbach’s α of the scale was 0.70.

2.2.4. Burnout. Burnout was measured using the Chinese
version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory: Human Services
Survey for Medical Personnel (MBI-HSS-MP) [44, 45]. It
consists of a total of 22 items across three dimensions of
emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal ac-
complishment. Each item is scored on a 7-point Likert scale
from 0 (never) to 6 (every day). Scores of 19–26 or ≥27 on
emotional exhaustion, 6–9 or ≥10 on depersonalization, and

34–39 or ≤33 on personal accomplishment were indicative
of moderate or high burnout for the respective dimensions.
For the sake of consistency of interpretation, the items of
personal accomplishment were reverse-scored and renamed
as low personal accomplishment when calculating the total
score. Te total score of the MBI ranges from 0 to 132, and
a higher score denotes more severe job burnout. Cronbach’s
α coefcient for the Chinese version of MBI was 0.62 [45].
Cronbach’s α of the scale was 0.80 in this study.

2.3. Data Analysis. Data analysis was performed using IBM
SPSS Statistics, version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
Firstly, descriptive data were generated for participants’
overall characteristics. Ten, based on the normality test, we
used the independent t-test or one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA)
to compare levels of perceived stress and
burnout, and the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test or Krus-
kal–Wallis test was used to compare levels of experiential
avoidance and cognitive fusion between nurses with dif-
ferent demographic and workplace relationship character-
istics. Te
relationship between these psychological
measurements was examined using the Spearman correla-
tion. Finally, hierarchical regression analysis was used to
construct models to assess the individual strength of dif-
ferent variables afecting burnout and how much the models
explained burnout.

2.4. Ethical Considerations. Ethical approval for this study
was obtained from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee
of Peking University First Hospital (approval no. 2021-415).
Informed consent was obtained voluntarily from all par-
ticipants, and all the data were recorded and analyzed
anonymously.

3. Results

3.1. Descriptive Statistics. Table 1 shows the descriptive sta-
tistics for participants’ demographic, workplace, and psy-
chological characteristics. Of the 481 nurses who completed
the questionnaire, most were female (86.7%), with a mean age
of 24.2 years. Approximately half of the participants held
undergraduate education, while only 10.2% had postgraduate
degrees. In total, 42% of the participants had only one year of
work experience, and nearly 90% had a monthly salary of less
than ¥5000. When asked about social relationships and
support in the workplace, the vast majority of respondents
reported being satisfed with coworker relationships and
supervisor support, while about one-quarter of
the re-
spondents reported poor relationships between doctors and
nurses. Te participants’ overall
scores of experiential
avoidance, cognitive fusion, perceived stress, and burnout are
shown in Table 1. Te scores for each of the three dimensions
of burnout suggested high levels of emotional exhaustion
(mean � 33.48, SD � 6.53) and depersonalization (mean-
� 16.07, SD � 5.23) and low level of personal achievement
(mean � 20.75, SD � 4.51), indicating high burnout.

3.2. Comparisons of Junior Nurses’ Psychological Flexibility,
Perceived Stress, and Burnout between Groups. Signifcant
diferences in the score of several scales were found
according to participants’ demographic characteristics and
workplace factors (Table 2). Te preliminary analysis showed
that female nurses had signifcantly higher levels of expe-
riential avoidance. Nurses with a junior college education
had signifcantly lower levels of experiential avoidance,
cognitive fusion, and burnout
than those with un-
dergraduate education. Tere was little diference between
undergraduate and postgraduate nurses, although un-
dergraduate nurses scored slightly higher on perceived stress
and burnout than the other two groups. Additionally, there
was a decreasing trend in the scores of all four scales with
longer work years in new nurses. Perceived stress decreased
signifcantly across all years of work experience, while the
improvement in the other three aspects did not reach sta-
tistical diferences until the third year. Moreover, self-
reported data showed that poor relationships and support
from colleagues or supervisors were accompanied by sig-
nifcant psychological infexibility, stress, and burnout.

3.3. Correlations between Psychological Flexibility, Perceived
Stress, and Burnout. Te results of the correlational analysis
between four psychological measurements are presented in

Table 3. Overall, experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion,
perceived stress, and burnout were positively associated with
each other. For each dimension of burnout, the largest
correlations observed were between depersonalization and
other measures. Te correlation between accomplishment
and cognitive fusion was relatively weak, while that between
accomplishment and experiential avoidance failed to reach
statistical signifcance.

3.4. Te Roles of Demographics and Workplace Relationship
Factors, Psychological Flexibility, and Perceived Stress in
Burnout among Junior Nurses. Table 4 displays the results of
the hierarchical regression analysis. As can be seen from the
table, demographics and workplace relationship factors were
entered in the frst step, psychological fexibility in the
second, and perceived stress in the third. Working experi-
ence, the relationship between nurses, the relationship be-
tween doctors and nurses, and supervisor support were
signifcantly associated with burnout in the frst step, while
none of these remained statistically signifcant after psy-
chological fexibility was added to the model. By comparing
models 2 and 3, it can be seen that the standardized beta
coefcients of experiential avoidance reduced to no statis-
tical
signifcance when considering perceived stress.
Moreover, the adjusted R2 of each regression indicated that
the three sequential models explained 9.9%, 35.2%, and
43.9% of the variance in burnout, respectively.

4. Discussion

Although burnout has been noted in nurses for years, few
studies have focused specifcally on junior nurses. Our study
examined the role of demographic and workplace re-
lationships, psychological fexibility, and perceived stress on
burnout and reported levels of these psychological indicators
among junior nurses.

Our fndings indicated a high level of burnout in dif-
ferent dimensions in our sample, which confrms that young
nurses are at high risk of burnout. Te COVID-19 pandemic
had signifcant impacts on nurses’ mental health [27, 46, 47].
China was at a lull between outbreaks during data collection
for this study, and there were only a few COVID-19 cases in
the sample hospitals. However, the workload associated with
the “dynamic zero-COVID policy” and demands put on
hospital staf (e.g., frequent nucleic acid testing, strict epi-
demic prevention and control measures, and restricted
mobility) may have increased burnout. Xie et al.’s cross-
sectional study of newly graduated nurses from 13 provinces
in China before the pandemic focused on nurses with less
than three years of experience and reported less severe
burnout than our fndings [48]. Province, hospital levels, and
epidemic status may primarily explain the diferences.
Moreover, our study demonstrated that several demographic
and workplace relationships are associated with these var-
iables. We found that nurses with a junior college education
had the lowest level of psychological infexibility, perceived
stress, and burnout, while nurses with an undergraduate
education had the worst scores among the three educational

groups. Tis is partially inconsistent with previous studies,
which showed that nurses with higher levels of education
had lower levels of burnout [49, 50]. Te reasons for the
diference are unclear, given that education is confounded by
other variables such as responsibilities, resources, and
personal attributes [34]. For our fndings, it is possible that
junior college nurses have fewer responsibilities and en-
croachment on personal time. In addition, postgraduate
nurses may have boosted their strategies to deal with ad-
versity during education and may get more support and
resource at work, while undergraduate nurses are more
likely to experience a mismatch in job demands and re-
sources, leading to stress and burnout. Future qualitative
studies are needed to delineate the reasons behind this
fnding.

We also found that junior nurses with longer years of
tenure had higher psychological fexibility and lower levels
of stress and burnout, similar to the fndings of earlier
studies [21]. Tis fnding can be explained by capacity and
maturity gained from work or life experience, although it
may also be due to survival bias. Longitudinal studies are
needed to eliminate the bias caused by resignation and
support the idea that experience can improve psychological
fexibility in the absence of additional psychoeducation.
Interestingly, perceived stress declined signifcantly across
each additional year of work experience, while the im-
provement in burnout was not so rapid. Te fnding suggests
that the accumulation of work experience can reduce stress
caused by a lack of professional knowledge and skills, while
the contributors of burnout may be more complex and
require additional attention.

In the univariate analysis as well as the frst model of
hierarchical regression, our results showed a signifcant
association between workplace relationships and nurse
burnout. However, these efects were no longer statistically
signifcant when psychological fexibility was entered into
the model. Tis appears to be contrary to other studies and
reports of burnout among health workers [34, 51]. One likely
reason is that we used subjective questions rather than
objective scales when assessing workplace relationships;
thus, the responses obtained highly depend on subjective
perceptions. In addition, some aspects of psychological
fexibility, such as cognitive integration, may distort or re-
inforce the individual’s perception of external evaluations to
some extent. Te relationship between workplace relation-
ships and psychological fexibility in Table 2 supports this
inference. Social support from coworkers and supervisors
has been reported to reduce stress reactions and promote
personal meaningfulness at work [52, 53]. Te perception of
relationships and support at work could increase nurses’
confdence and alleviate adverse emotions by changing the
process of cognitive appraisal [54]. Te individual’s psy-
chological fexibility may have a similar efect in the process.
Our fnding of a negative association between psycho-
logical fexibility and burnout corroborates with many other
studies among nurses and nursing students [21, 33, 55, 56].
In addition, consistent with the concept of burnout as an
outcome of chronic stress [57], the efect of perceived stress
was refected in the fnal model. Notably, psychological

fexibility had an independent efect on burnout, suggesting
that some aspects of psychological fexibility can directly
afect burnout instead of indirectly through stress reduction.
An imbalance between job demands and resources is con-
sidered to be the reason leading to stress and burnout
[58, 59]. Psychological fexibility, as an intangible personal
resource, helps individuals adhere to value-based actions in
the presence of uncomfortable feelings [60]. Te positive
feedback that comes with efective work will guarantee that
individuals are engaged in their work, realize their value in
the workplace, and ultimately reduce burnout [61].

A strength of this study is that it was a multicenter study
that focused exclusively on junior nurses. In addition, we
considered both organizational and individual
factors.
However, the study has some limitations. Due to the cross-
sectional design of the study, it is impossible to determine
the causality between the variables. Furthermore, workplace
relationships were evaluated using self-designed questions,
which may reduce the objectivity of these factors. Never-
theless, this,
in turn, suggests that stress and burnout
resulting from perceived workplace relationships may be
modifable through specifc processes of psychological
fexibility.

Future researchers should carry out longitudinal and
qualitative studies to clarify the diferent processes of
burnout and how psychological fexibility regulates these
processes. Path analysis would help assess the causal re-
lationship and potential moderators. In addition, future
studies should explore the possibility of providing extensive
training for junior nurses to improve their psychological
fexibility, such as mindfulness and acceptance commitment
therapy.

4.1. Implications for Nursing Management. Junior nurses’
job burnout will afect their professional identity, pro-
fessional ability, and career development. In order to
prevent early turnover and job change, it is necessary for
hospital authorities to help junior nurses improve their
burnout
levels. We recommend that nurse managers
prioritize improving organizational culture and enhanc-
ing the mental health of their employees, which may
include creating a fair, non-blaming, supportive working
environment; sharing tips for junior nurses to quickly
acquire skills and deal with relationships in a new de-
partment; and providing some psychology training fo-
cused on psychological fexibility, stress, and burnout,
such as mindfulness and acceptance and commitment
therapy.

5. Conclusions

Te results of this study corroborate that new nurses are at
a high risk of burnout. Workplace relationships, psycho-
logical fexibility, and perceived stress impact burnout, while
the latter two may be more fundamental.
