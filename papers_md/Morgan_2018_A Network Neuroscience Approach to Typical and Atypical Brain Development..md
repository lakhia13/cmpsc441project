Abstract

Human brain networks based on neuroimaging data have already proven useful in characterizing 
both normal and abnormal brain structure and function. However, many brain disorders are 
neurodevelopmental in origin, highlighting the need to go beyond characterizing brain 
organization in terms of static networks. Here, we review the fast-growing literature shedding light 
on developmental changes in network phenotypes. We begin with an overview of recent large-
scale efforts to map healthy brain development, and we describe the key role played by 
longitudinal data including repeated measurements over a long period of follow-up. We also 
discuss the subtle ways in which healthy brain network development can inform our understanding 
of disorders, including work bridging the gap between macroscopic neuroimaging results and the 
microscopic level. Finally, we turn to studies of three specific neurodevelopmental disorders that 
first manifest primarily in childhood and adolescence/early adulthood, namely psychotic disorders, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. In each case we discuss 
recent progress in understanding the atypical features of brain network development associated 
with the disorder, and we conclude the review with some suggestions for future directions.

Childhood and adolescence are critical periods during which several brain disorders develop. 
Characterizing how atypical developmental trajectories diverge from normal brain 
development is essential to understand and ultimately treat these disorders. Network models 
of neuroimaging data have already highlighted key drivers in brain organization (1–3), for 
example, the role of hubs in coordinating information transfer (4) and the economic trade-off 
brain networks navigate between the cost of long-distance connections and their topological 
benefits, enabling efficient information processing by connecting distant brain regions (5). 
Figure 1 summarizes commonly used graph metrics. However, owing to the difficulty and 
cost of recruiting and scanning large cohorts, historically many network studies of 
neurodevelopmental disorders have focused on static patient/control differences, 
disregarding the changing structure of brain networks over time. What can network models 
tell us about healthy brain development and how developmental trajectories differ in 
disease? Several neuroimaging studies have begun to tackle this question, including the 
Human Connectome Project Development study (6), the Developing Human Connectome 
Project (7), the NeuroScience in Psychiatry Network (8), and the Philadelphia 
Neurodevelopmental Cohort (9), among others. These collaborative projects benefit from 
large sample sizes with several hundred participants, which is crucial to obtain enough 
power to detect statistically significant, potentially nonlinear changes with age. Perhaps the 
most exciting feature of some of these projects is the longitudinal neuroimaging data being 
acquired (Box 1). While cross-sectional data can provide important insights into average 
group changes, longitudinal data are essential to study development at an individual level 
because significant individual differences exist even between healthy individuals of similar 
ages (10,11), which may confound cross-sectional analyses (12). In atypical development, 
the trajectory of changes in an individual’s brain network may be a more useful biomarker 
than the absolute values (13).

Here, we build on previous reviews (14–20), with particular emphasis on how healthy 
development can provide insights into abnormal development and the importance of 
longitudinal data. We begin by reviewing cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of healthy 
brain network development and their implications for understanding neurodevelopmental 
disorders. We then turn to studies of three specific neurodevelopmental disorders that first 
manifest primarily in childhood and adolescence/early adulthood, namely psychotic 
disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD). We conclude with suggestions for future directions.

Healthy Development

The human brain undergoes extraordinary changes during development, from conception to 
birth and throughout childhood. Before birth, neurogenesis is largely completed by week 20 
after conception; axons begin to grow and synapses start to form between neurons (19,21). 
After birth, a further proliferation phase in which the number of synapses continues to 
increase is followed by a consolidation phase characterized by cell loss, synaptic pruning, 
and myelination of axons, which is thought to continue into adolescence (22). Neuroimaging 
provides a noninvasive, albeit indirect, way to study these developmental changes. Table 1 
lists cross-sectional and longitudinal studies performed in healthy children and adolescents,

using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), 
and functional MRI (fMRI).

Structural MRI

sMRI provides several metrics characterizing brain morphology, for example, gray and 
white matter volumes and cortical thickness (CT). The first longitudinal pediatric 
neuroimaging study was performed in 1999 and showed that gray matter volume increases in 
early childhood before decreasing in later childhood/adolescence, forming an inverted U–
shaped trajectory, which peaks at different ages in different brain regions (23). These peaks 
occur later than expected from cross-sectional studies (13), although recent longitudinal 
studies have suggested that methodological issues might have confounded these results and 
CT may decrease from earlier in childhood (24–26). For example, Mills et al. (25) found that 
gray matter volume decreased from 8 to 30 years of age in four longitudinal samples. One 
potential confound is that in-scanner movement can lead to reduced CT and volume 
estimates (27,28), which can bias developmental trajectories. A recent multisample study 
analyzed longitudinal changes in cortical volume, surface area, and thickness from 7 to 29 
years of age and found that cortical thinning is the dominant contributor to volume 
reductions during adolescence (29). In Giedd et al. (23), white matter volumes increased 
from 4 to 20 years of age, in agreement with recent results (24). Microscopically, these 
changes are thought to be driven by the pruning of synapses, dendrites, or cell bodies and the 
myelination of axons. Several studies have shown that lower-order somatosensory and visual 
cortices mature first, followed by higher-order association cortices (30–34), in line with the 
order of cognitive and behavioral changes during childhood. These studies used a variety of 
developmental benchmarks, e.g., age at attainment of adult brain volume or at other 
inflection points.

To study the relationships between brain regions, morphological metrics can be correlated 
between regions across subjects to create one structural covariance network per subject 
group (35). The network’s nodes correspond to brain regions and the edges represent cross-
correlations of morphological metrics between pairs of regions taken across subjects. While 
this approach cannot elucidate intersubject differences, it can provide insights into average 
developmental changes. For example, volumetric covariance networks suggest that small-
world, modular topology is already present at 1 month (36). Later work found that network 
measures follow nonlinear trajectories (37,38); for example, in a longitudinal study, global 
efficiency and CT peak at 7 years of age, and at the same time local efficiency is lowest and 
cortical folding becomes stable (38). Correlations between fractional anisotropy (FA) (see 
below for details) and CT covariance matrices suggest that white and gray matter 
development is synchronized (39).

Like individual morphometric measures, in structural covariance networks different brain 
regions follow different developmental trajectories (37,40–42). Several studies have shown 
early maturation of primary regions followed by protracted development of high-order 
regions (37,40,41). One study of 108 adolescents with three to six longitudinal scans per 
participant created both structural and maturational covariance networks, in which 
maturational networks were derived from the rate of change of CT in different regions (42).

Structural and maturational covariance networks exhibited similar topological properties and 
spatial organization, suggesting that correlated anatomical structure between brain regions 
results from similarities in maturational trajectories. In other words, brain regions with high 
structural covariance might have developed in similar ways.

Other work has highlighted the importance of hub regions (37,43,44). Khundrakpam et al. 
(37) found that both the number and the distribution of hubs change over development; the 
number of hubs peaks in late childhood, then the distribution of hubs shifts toward frontal 
regions during adolescence. Whitaker et al. (43) also pointed to a key role for hubs in 
association cortices during adolescence, showing that they are less myelinated at 14 years of 
age than other regions, but have faster rates of myelination and cortical shrinkage between 
14 and 24 years of age. These results are consistent with the idea that primary sensory and 
motor regions develop early on, while hub regions of the association cortex that are 
responsible for more complex integrative function mature more slowly.

Recently Seidlitz et al. (45) proposed a new approach for calculating sMRI networks at the 
individual level, based on interregional similarity of several morphological metrics such as 
CT, gray matter volumes, surface area, and curvature. Future studies based on these 
morphometric similarity networks could enable a deeper understanding of how individual 
sMRI connectivity develops.

Diffusion-Weighted Imaging

DWI exploits the diffusion of water molecules to generate contrast between different types 
of brain tissue. It can be used to measure mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, or radial 
diffusivity, and FA, which is believed to reflect fiber density, axonal diameter, and 
myelination. Finally, white matter fibers can be tracked to create a tractography (diffusion 
tensor imaging [DTI]) network where predefined gray matter regions of interest are 
connected by an edge if white matter fibers are inferred between them (46). As in sMRI, 
DWI is susceptible to motion artifacts, particularly DTI networks, due to their long 
acquisition times (47,48).

During development, diffusivity decreases with age while anisotropy increases (19). These 
changes are believed to reflect increasing myelination. Changes occur most rapidly up to 2 
years, then continue throughout childhood and adolescence, until at least 18 years of age and 
possibly into early adulthood (49,50).

Many global topological properties of DTI networks are already established at birth, 
including small-worldness and the presence of hubs (46,49). However, several studies report 
substantial reorganization of DTI networks during childhood and adolescence, including 
monotonic increases in integration and global efficiency and decreases in clustering 
(46,49,51–53). The studies use several approaches to calculate edge weights, including 
binarization, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity values, and span age ranges from birth 
to 30 years of age. The monotonic changes are consistent with increasing white matter 
volume. Recently, Baum et al. (54) observed that while global efficiency increases with age, 
surprisingly both participation coefficient and between-module connectivity decrease, 
suggesting that networks become both more modular and more integrated. These changes

were driven by strengthening of network hub edges. Other studies agree that connectivity 
between hubs or association regions changes disproportionately to other regions, particularly 
in adolescence (52,55). Recently, Wierenga et al. (56) also showed increases in connectivity 
between rich-club nodes and peripheral nodes. We note that some studies observe decreasing 
global efficiency with age (57,58). These different results may be due to using different 
measures, as Lim et al. (57) used networks weighted by streamline count, while Baum et al. 
(54) used FA. In line with these results, in Koenis et al. (58) networks weighted by 
streamline count showed decreasing global efficiency with age, while FA-weighted networks 
showed increasing global efficiency. In Lim et al. (57), the proportion of intermodule 
connections increased with age, again unlike Baum et al. (54), and possibly owing to 
differences in network construction.

Functional MRI

In fMRI brain images, each voxel is associated with a time series. There are several 
approaches to analyzing fMRI networks, including 1) independent component analysis, a 
data-driven approach that identifies components that group voxels into regions with similar 
response patterns; 2) seed-based maps, which study correlations between a particular seed 
region and other areas of the brain; 3) regional maps, which study correlations between brain 
regions selected a priori; and 4) whole-brain network analysis, in which an atlas is used to 
parcellate the brain into regions and correlations are studied between regions. We note that 
there are still questions about how to preprocess fMRI data. As for other modalities, 
movement can bias estimates of functional connectivity (59–61). Several authors have 
proposed methods to address this problem (61–64); however, older studies may still be 
affected. The role of intersubject differences in mean connectivity and whether to perform 
global signal regression are also topics of debate (65,66).

In contrast to structural networks, in fMRI networks global topological metrics including 
efficiency and clustering generally remain stable across development (67–69), although Gao 
et al. (70) observed some changes in global efficiency between neonates and 1-year-olds, 
and Gao et al. (71) and Wu et al. (72) observed some changes in clustering at later stages of 
development.

Despite these broadly constant global topological properties, several authors have shown that 
long-range connections strengthen during development and short-range connections weaken 
(67,69,70,73,74). Although this result may be exaggerated by motion artifacts in early 
studies, the effect remains significant after motion correction (74).

Consistent with structural results, several developmental changes focus on hub regions 
(71,75,76), and intermodular integration also increases with development (67,77). Recent 
evidence from 780 subjects from 8 to 22 years of age suggests that different modules follow 
distinct developmental trajectories: for example, the default mode system shows increasing 
inter- and intrasystem connectivity, while sensorimotor systems become increasingly 
segregated from other systems (78).

Finally, recent work found that subjects develop more stable, individual functional 
connectomes during adolescence (79). In particular, for 797 subjects from 8 to 22 years of

age, the identification accuracy of one resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) or task fMRI scan from 
a subject based on other fMRI scans from the same subject (termed connectome 
distinctiveness) increases with age (see Figure 2). Machine-learning approaches like this one 
offer an alternative, individual-centric perspective on development.

A Window into Atypical Development

Developmental studies on healthy subjects provide a crucial benchmark for 
neurodevelopmental disorders. They can also provide further insights, e.g., by 1) studying 
individuals from a general population with disorder-like traits or (subclinical) symptoms; 2) 
highlighting which network properties/regions change at which stages of development and 
linking them to the disorders separately shown to affect the same network properties/regions; 
and 3) associating brain development with genes that are known to be implicated in 
disorders.

Here, we discuss studies that take these approaches to explore what large healthy 
developmental cohorts can teach us about brain disorders. Above, we discussed work by 
Kaufmann et al. (79), which showed that connectome distinctiveness increases from 8 to 22 
years of age. The authors also showed that this increase is delayed in subjects from the 
general population with increased clinical symptom scores for a range of disorders. This 
delay in connectome distinctiveness reflects both a delay in stabilization of an individual’s 
brain network over time and a delay in the individualization of the subject’s brain network 
with respect to the other subjects.

Healthy subjects can also inform our understanding of disorders by highlighting the network 
features that change during development and are therefore particularly vulnerable to 
abnormal development. As discussed above, one of the main results from several healthy 
developmental studies, across multiple modalities, is that developmental changes often focus 
on hub regions. For example, Whitaker et al. (43) showed that the greatest rates of 
myelination and cortical shrinking during adolescence are focused on hub regions of the 
association cortex. Disruptions to hub connectivity have been observed in patients: for 
example, a meta-analysis showed that hub regions are more likely to be anatomically 
abnormal than nonhub regions in nine different brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s 
disease and schizophrenia (80). Together, these results suggest that disorders may be linked 
to abnormal development of these key regions. In Whitaker et al. (43), the authors combined 
neuroimaging with the Allen Institute for Brain Science dataset on brainwide gene 
expression (81) (see Figure 3). The hub regions with greatest rates of myelination and 
cortical shrinkage from 14 to 24 years of age show overexpression of a set of genes enriched 
for both synaptic processes and schizophrenia risk-genes. The involvement of these risk 
genes in normal maturational processes during adolescence could explain why this period is 
particularly vulnerable to the onset of schizophrenia. The study provides an example of the 
way in which genetic and genomic datasets can link the brain development of healthy 
individuals and disorders for which there is a known set of risk genes (82). It also shows 
how macroscopic brain imaging results can be linked to a microscopic understanding of the 
brain (83–88). Similar methods are currently being applied to other disorders, including 
autism (89) and Huntington’s disease (90).

Abnormal Development

Despite the significant insights that can be gained from healthy developmental studies, 
ultimately building a comprehensive picture of disorders requires longitudinal studies of 
patients. Below we review longitudinal and cross-sectional studies on ASD, ADHD, and 
psychosis, which are listed in Tables 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

Autism Spectrum Disorder

ASD manifests in the first few years of childhood and strongly impacts subsequent 
development. Zielinski et al. (91) found that CT development in boys with ASD undergoes 
three phases: in childhood cortical expansion is accelerated compared with control subjects; 
in late childhood/adolescence cortical thinning is accelerated; and in early adulthood cortical 
thinning is decelerated. The wide age range studied, from 3 to 36 years of age, was made 
possible by an accelerated longitudinal design (see Box 1). Topologically, studies comparing 
adult ASD patients and control subjects have found evidence for reduced efficiency and 
long-range connections in patients’ fMRI and DTI networks (92,93), although increased 
local connectivity has also been observed (93,94). Network changes may be state dependent 
(e.g., sustained attention vs. at rest) (95). Disruption has also been observed in hub regions 
and regions related to social interaction, which is abnormal in ASD (96,97).

In DTI networks, reduced local efficiencies in low-level sensory processing regions have 
been observed in high-risk infants as young as 6 months of age and correlate significantly 
with 24-month symptom severity (98). Later in development, ASD patients fail to show the 
increases in rich-club organization observed in typically developing subjects (99). 
Nonnegative matrix factorization can be used to identify developmental subnetworks in ASD 
and subnetworks that discriminate between patients and control subjects. For example, 
Ghanbari et al. (100) identified one subnetwork with reduced interhemispheric subcortical 
connections that can discriminate groups but does not correlate with age, and another 
subnetwork involving frontal regions that is both discriminative and developmental. In 
contrast, other work taking a similar approach found increases in local connectivity in the 
cingulate cortex in ASD (101). Functional resting-state networks show a similarly complex 
picture. One study showed decreased default mode network (DMN) connectivity in 
independent component analysis networks of ASD children and adolescents, which 
normalizes by adulthood (102). Chen et al. (103) also observed reduced connectivity in 
some network edges, although other edges showed increased connectivity. A recent study 
suggested that rs-fMRI can predict whether 6-month-old infants develop autism at 24 
months, although the sample size was relatively modest (59 infants, including 11 with ASD) 
(104). Further work is needed to clarify how connectivity develops in ASD.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders and is often diagnosed 
between 6 and 12 years of age. Adult patients’ rs-fMRI networks show reduced integration 
and increased segregation compared with control subjects (105,106), and a DTI study 
observed local reductions in efficiency and increases in clustering (107). Several authors 
have highlighted the importance of development in ADHD. Patients exhibit reduced brain

volumes, which normalize in some regions during development but not in others (108). 
There is also a delay in the age at which ADHD patients’ CT peaks, which was first 
established by Shaw et al. (109) using a mixed longitudinal and cross-sectional design.

Most work to date on brain network development in ADHD has focused on rs-fMRI 
networks, which exhibit higher clustering and lower global efficiency in children with 
ADHD than in age-matched control subjects (110,111), in line with results in adults. These 
measures correlate with behavioral symptoms including inattention and hyperactivity/
impulsivity symptoms and differ between clinical subtypes (110). Early results showed that 
the rs-fMRI connectivity of the DMN is reduced in 23 ADHD patients compared with age-
matched control subjects (112). Based on previous work on healthy development, this 
suggested a delay or disruption to development in ADHD patients. Later, Sripada et al. (113) 
showed that the connectivity within the DMN and between the DMN and task-positive 
networks in ADHD patients does indeed lag behind control subjects in a large cross-
sectional sample from 7 to 22 years of age. Recently, Kessler et al. (114) used an 
independent component analysis approach to chart the development of brain connectivity 
networks in 519 subjects from 8 to 22 years of age, including 25 with ADHD. They found 
evidence for disrupted maturation in ADHD patients’ functional networks, which involves 
the DMN, although interestingly maturation is reduced (downshifted) in patients rather than 
delayed. It would be interesting to see if these results could be replicated in a larger, 
longitudinal sample and related to structural network changes.

Psychotic disorders are often associated with brain dysconnectivity. sMRI studies show 
reduced CT and volume in adults with schizophrenia (115), DTI network connectivity is 
often reduced (116), and patients’ rs-fMRI networks exhibit lower mean correlations and 
more randomized topologies (117). Psychotic disorders normally manifest in late 
adolescence/early adulthood, although earlier developmental changes could be valuable to 
identify individuals at risk.

Longitudinal studies show greater volume reductions in patients than in control subjects 
during adolescence, particularly in the frontal and temporal regions (118). Similarly, CT 
shows exaggerated thinning in patients (119). Alexander-Bloch et al. (120) found both age-
constant deficits of CT and faster cortical thinning in childhood-onset schizophrenia patients 
compared with control subjects. They used structural covariance to derive five brain 
development modules with similar maturational trajectories in normal subjects and found 
that deviations in patients are primarily in the cingulofrontotemporal module. Other 
longitudinal work using CT structural covariance networks observed that left hemisphere 
occipitotemporal connectivity is significantly reduced in patients and siblings at 12 years of 
age compared with control subjects (121). By 17 years, siblings catch up with control 
subjects, but patients exhibit further delayed development, reminiscent of other disorders 
(79,114). Few DWI studies have focused on brain network development in psychosis, 
although in older subjects (19 to 54 years) longitudinal results show decreasing global 
efficiency over a 5-year period in patients with schizophrenia, compared with increases in 
the same period in control subjects (122).

There are few functional brain network studies of schizophrenia patients during childhood/
adolescence. One study found that local degree, local clustering, and local path length are 
reduced in most cortical regions in adults compared with children/adolescents, and reduced 
in adults with schizophrenia compared with control subjects in the thalamus and midbrain 
regions (123). However not all healthy development studies show similar trends, as 
discussed previously. Other work has found a complex pattern of increases and decreases in 
local connectivity in early-onset schizophrenia patients (124). Further studies are required to 
resolve these differences. A recent rs-fMRI study of at-risk mental state subjects found that 
those who transitioned to psychosis exhibited less segregated networks and disrupted 
network communities (125).

An alternative approach to studying developmental disorders is using generative models 
(126,127), algorithms that generate synthetic networks with certain topological properties. 
Vértes et al. (126) proposed a generative model incorporating a term that penalizes long-
distance connections and a topological term that favors connections between nodes with 
shared nearest neighbors. The model reproduces several topological properties of healthy rs-
fMRI brain networks. Simulations of schizophrenia patients’ networks required a reduced 
distance penalization parameter, which increased the probability of long-distance 
connections, producing more randomized networks. Generative models could shed light on 
microscopic changes during disease. For example, increased probability of long-distance 
connections in disease could be related to the dysregulation of normal maturational 
processes such as pruning and myelination (43).

Conclusions and Future Directions

Larger sample sizes and the availability of longitudinal data are enabling more accurate 
assessments of the developmental changes of healthy children and adolescents across 
modalities. Healthy brain connectivity evolves during development, with evidence for 
stronger long-distance connections with age (74), more integration (52,67,128), and 
increasing connectome distinctiveness (79). Certain results have been observed across 
modalities, for example, the importance of hubs during brain network development 
(37,43,55), although other results vary by modality in ways that are not always clearly 
understood, for example, the changes in global efficiency with age observed in sMRI results 
are often not replicated in fMRI networks (38,67). Overall, healthy studies provide an 
important benchmark for neurodevelopmental disorders, for which atypical developmental 
trajectories may be a key biomarker.

Patient developmental studies are important to understand precisely how and when network 
properties change in disorders. Many results point toward delayed or disrupted development 
in patients (68,102,109) and to changes in network hubs and rich-club nodes, which are 
known to be vulnerable during development. Characteristics of specific disorders are likely 
to be related to their developmental timing. ASD patients exhibit a mixture of increased/
decreased connectivity in different brain regions from childhood, which may be age and/or 
state dependent. ADHD patients show a clearer pattern of reduced local efficiency, which 
lags behind control subjects. In psychosis, patients exhibit increased cortical thinning during

adolescence, which is likely coupled to functional changes although more work is required 
to elucidate this relationship.

Large, longitudinal datasets are essential to build a clearer picture, and making data openly 
accessible is an important step toward more reproducible research. Table 5 lists large open 
datasets for typical and atypical development. There are noticeable gaps, e.g., a paucity of 
developmental rs-fMRI data from patients with schizophrenia. Several ongoing psychosis 
projects will go some way to address this problem [e.g., (9,129–131)]. Similar initiatives are 
underway for other disorders (132,133).

Another advantage of large collaborative projects is that they often collect data from 
multiple modalities, enabling the relationships between modalities to be assessed. Networks 
provide an excellent framework to compare or combine different data types across temporal 
and spatial scales, for example, by using multilayer networks. Combining neuroimaging 
results with nonneuroimaging data also represents an exciting avenue for future research. 
For example, gene expression data from the Allen Institute for Brain Science has already 
provided a link between the developmental changes in hub regions during adolescence and 
genes implicated in schizophrenia (43). Ultimately, using networks to bridge the gap 
between macroscopic neuroimaging results and the microscopic level could open the door to 
a new depth of understanding and treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders.

From Cross-Sectional to Longitudinal Analysis

To understand developmental change, it is crucial to distinguish individual age-related 
changes from subject heterogeneity. Cross-sectional studies only contain a single 
observation per individual in a cohort of varying age and therefore cannot make this 
distinction (135,136). In contrast, longitudinal studies incorporate repeat measurements 
of the same individuals at multiple time points. Longitudinal studies increase the 
complexity of design and analysis, but the scientific benefits to understanding 
developmental changes are substantial.

Mixed-effects models are an established approach to analyzing longitudinal data 
(24,137–139) and include (as special cases) other well-known techniques such as change-
score regression and repeated-measures analysis of variance. However, standard mixed-
effects models are not without issues, notably, assumptions of Gaussian errors and the 
need to specify the random-effects structure (139). Longitudinal data also bring issues of 
attrition, which if associated with a biomarker or outcome of interest may lead to 
differential missingness, also known as missing not at random (140). Another challenge 
is the so-called age-period-cohort problem (141)—including the difficulty of separating 
changes owing to aging from changes due to external factors at different calendar 
periods, which is especially pertinent for long-term studies.

Study design is particularly important for longitudinal studies and requires balancing 
robust and reliable inferences against recruitment and costs to determine not only how 
many participants, but also how many visits per subject are needed. A classical 
longitudinal design follows a single cohort of subjects for the duration of interest, 
observing each subject multiple times. However, this makes the duration of many 
developmental studies untenable.

An alternative is the accelerated longitudinal design (142), also called the cohort-
sequential design (143), in which multiple cohorts are followed with overlapping follow-
up. This introduces two new design considerations, the number of cohorts and the 
overlap, which affect the acceleration of the design. An accelerated longitudinal design 
with sufficient overlap can disentangle age-period-cohort effects and the number of 
observations per subject is the primary determinant of power to detect an age-related 
trajectory (144).

Figure 1. 
An illustration of commonly used network metrics. (A) Degree, hubs, and rich clubs: The 
degree of a node is the number of links or connections it makes. Hubs are nodes with a 
significantly higher degree than other nodes in the network. In many networks, these nodes 
preferentially connect to one another, forming an elite group of nodes called a rich club. (B) 
Path length and efficiency: the minimum path length between two nodes i and j is the 
minimum number of edges that need to be traversed to go from one node to another, and 
efficiency is inversely related to path length. (C) Clustering and local efficiency: the 
clustering coefficient measures the number of connections that exist between the first 
neighbors of a node i as a proportion of the maximum possible number of such connections. 
These edges form triangular connections around the node i, which increases the local 
efficiency by decreasing the path length locally between the node’s neighbors. (D) 
Modularity: Many complex networks have a modular community structure, whereby they

contain subsets of highly interconnected nodes called modules. Many of these features are 
highlighted in a brain functional network shown in both (E) anatomical space and (F) 
topological space. Node size is proportional to degree and rich-club nodes are highlighted as 
squares in panel (F). The modular organization is highlighted by assigning different colors 
to nodes of different modules. Reproduced with permission from Vértes et al. (14) and

Figure 3. 
Schematic of the methodology in Whitaker et al. (43). Gene expression data can be used to 
link magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) observations and network phenotypes to a 
microscopic understanding of the brain. (A) In vivo MRI observations are used to (B) 
identify network phenotypes. Multivariate statistical methods can then (C) combine this 
information with brainwide gene expression data and (D) identify genes that are associated 
with the network phenotype. (E) Cellular processes that are known to be enriched in those 
genes can provide information about the processes that are particularly important in the 
regions highlighted by MRI. PLS, partial least squares.
