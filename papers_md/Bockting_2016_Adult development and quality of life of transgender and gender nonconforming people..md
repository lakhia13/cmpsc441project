Abstract

Purpose of review—Research on the health of transgender and gender nonconforming people 
has been limited with most of the work focusing on transition-related care and HIV. This review 
summarizes research to date on the overall development and quality of life of transgender and 
gender nonconforming adults, and makes recommendations for future research.

Recent findings—Pervasive stigma and discrimination attached to gender nonconformity affect 
the health of transgender people across the lifespan, particularly when it comes to mental health 
and wellbeing. Despite the related challenges, transgender and gender nonconforming people may 
develop resilience over time. Social support and affirmation of gender identity play herein a 
critical role. While there is a growing awareness of diversity in gender identity and expression 
among this population, a comprehensive understanding of biopsychosocial development beyond 
the gender binary and beyond transition is lacking.

Summary—Greater visibility of transgender people in society has revealed the need to 
understand and promote their health and quality of life broadly, including but not limited to gender 
dysphoria and HIV. This means addressing their needs in context of their families and 
communities, sexual and reproductive health, and successful aging. Research is needed to better 
understand what factors are associated with resilience and how it can be effectively promoted.

Introduction

Page 2

Public awareness about transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people has recently 
reached unprecedented heights. The field of transgender health is experiencing a 
corresponding surge in interest from health providers and policy makers. However, research 
to inform practice, education, and policy is lagging behind. Examples of TGNC people have 
been documented across cultures and throughout history. Crossdressing and TGNC 
identities were first medicalized in the early 20th century, but transgender health did not 
emerge as a field until the publication of Harry Benjamin’s book The Transsexual 
Phenomenon (1). That same year, Johns Hopkins University started providing gender-
affirming care followed by the University of Minnesota and other medical centers across the 
United States (2). Research evaluated how well transgender people functioned as members 
of the other sex after hormone therapy and surgery (3, 4). Unfortunately, 15 years later, most 
of these university-based clinics had closed, except for the University of Minnesota and the 
University of Texas Medical Branch.

In the 1980s and 90s, clinical services were primarily provided in private practice and little 
transgender health research was being conducted in the United States. Coming from a 
marginalized position, even within the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) 
community, TGNC people came together, empowered themselves, and began to redefine 
their identity and experience both within and outside of the gender binary (5–7). This 
renewed visibility led to a stronger coalition between the transgender and the LGB 
communities. A surge in research followed, particularly as public health reports revealed 
that TGNC people are disproportionately affected by HIV (8–12). LGBT community health 
centers began to serve transgender people in larger numbers and facilitated community-
based research. Findings indicated that TGNC people’s HIV risk had to be understood in 
light of their overall health affected by social stigma and lack of access to care (13).

In 2011, the NIH commissioned a report from the Institute of Medicine to review the status 
of LGBT health research, identify gaps and opportunities, and make corresponding 
recommendations. The review showed that there were more gaps than research, and the IOM 
recommended NIH implement a broad research agenda in LGBT health and prioritize 
creation of an evidence-base for transgender care (14). To assist NIH in developing such a 
research agenda, TransNet, a newly formed U.S. network of transgender health researchers, 
organized a workshop in May of 2015. This report is from the workshop’s group charged to 
review research on adult development and quality of life and make recommendations for 
future research.

Transgender Identity and Gender Dysphoria

TGNC people are a diverse group of individuals whose gender identity differs from their sex 
assigned at birth (14). Gender dysphoria refers to distress that some TGNC individuals may 
experience at some point in their lives as a result of incongruence between their gender 
identity and birth sex, which may include discomfort with gender role and primary and 
secondary sex characteristics. Gender dysphoria is a diagnosis in the Diagnostic Statistical

Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (15). However, transgender is an identity, not a 
disorder, and the diagnosis is only applicable when TGNC people experience distress or 
impaired social / occupational functioning as a result of the incongruence.

Gender dysphoria improves with gender-affirming treatment. Satisfaction with treatment is 
high (> 80%, regrets < 2%) (16). However, outcome research has primarily followed a 
binary model of gender, evaluating treatment with hormones, social transition, and surgery, 
in that order. Gender identity and expression, and gender-affirming interventions have 
become increasingly diverse. This diversity and the corresponding outcomes have not been 
systematically evaluated.

Identity Development

Theories of transgender identity development include typologies and stage models. 
Typologies differentiate TGNC individuals based on age of onset of gender dysphoria (17), 
degree of crossgender identification (18, 19) or gender role nonconformity (20, 21), and 
sexual orientation (22, 23). Stage models describe a series of developmental tasks (24–28). 
For example, Bockting & Coleman (24) distinguish among five stages, acknowledging how 
stigma attached to gender nonconformity shapes psychosocial identity development (Table 
1). Stage models are informed by qualitative research and clinical experience, yet have not 
been tested empirically. Project AFFIRM, a longitudinal study of transgender identity 
development across the lifespan (R01HD79603), includes an examination of developmental 
tasks and stages.

Most research on identity development has focused on the period of social and medical 
transition. Multiple challenges have been documented in qualitative research, with stigma as 
an overarching theme affecting mental health (e.g., contributing to increased risk for suicide) 
(29). Clinical research has focused on the role of transition in alleviating gender dysphoria. 
However, with a few exceptions (30, 31), what has not been studied is how different ways of 
transitioning affect health, wellbeing, and quality of life. Generational differences in the 
approach to transition have been observed clinically, but little research to date has examined 
such differences.

Social Stigma, Minority Stress, and Resilience

According to the minority stress model (32–34), stigma and prejudice result in added stress 
beyond general stress also faced by nontransgender people, causing an increase in mental 
and physical disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, substance use, hypertension, asthma). 
Meyer (32) described both distal and proximal minority stress processes. Distal processes 
are experiences of rejection and discrimination (enacted stigma); proximal processes refer to 
stress as a result of the internalization of prejudice and stigma. For TGNC people, distal 
processes include non-affirmation of gender identity (35,36). Proximal processes include 
internalized transphobia, perceived rejection and expectations of being rejected or 
discriminated against (felt stigma), and hiding stigmatized status (concealment). Against 
these stressors, gender minorities forge resilience, coping, social support, and use of other 
resources (37). The minority stress model describes the impact on health as the net outcome 
of these negative (stress) and positive (resilience and coping) processes.

TGNC people report verbal harassment, physical abuse, and sexual assault; employment and 
housing discrimination; and difficulties accessing health and support services (38, 39, 29). A 
test of the minority stress model with a national sample of the U.S. transgender population 
showed that discrimination was associated with psychological distress (Bockting et al., 
2013). Family support and identity pride were associated with less distress, and support from 
other transgender people buffered the negative impact of discrimination on mental health. 
Similarly, in a study of transgender women in NYC, gender-related abuse predicted 
depression (40, 41), mitigated by community connectedness (35).

Qualitative research has generated other factors of resilience yet to be tested quantitatively, 
including identity affirmation, awareness of oppression, hope and future outlook, social 
activism and being a positive role model for others (42). These findings provide support for 
the minority stress model, yet the mechanisms involved have not been adequately studied. 
Understanding of such mechanisms is necessary to inform interventions. Project AFFIRM 
(R01HD79603) is currently testing the development of resilience over time (Fig. 1).

Gender Affirmation

Gender affirmation refers to an interpersonal, interactive process whereby a person receives 
social recognition and support for gender identity and expression (24, 43, 35). Sevelius (44) 
proposed a Model of Gender Affirmation to provide a framework for research and 
interventions focused on sexual risk-taking and self-care among transgender women (Fig. 2). 
A high need for gender affirmation coupled with low access to gender-affirming procedures 
results in an unmet need for affirmation, which constitutes identity threat. TGNC people 
may attempt to reduce identity threat by seeking affirmation in contexts that pose risks and 
undervalue health-seeking behaviors. Interventions that emphasize self-care motivated by 
empowerment, gender pride, and understanding gender-based power inequalities, may be 
successful in building sexual negotiation skills and healthy behaviors supported by a sense 
of self-worth. An unmet need for gender affirmation predicted risk behavior among HIV 
negative transgender women and treatment failure among HIV positive women (45). Access 
to gender affirmation, both social and medical, is related to better mental health (46–48). 
Gender affirmation within and outside of the gender binary is a promising area for future 
research.

Quality of Life

Quality of life includes mental health, wellbeing, physical function, social function, 
satisfaction, and happiness. Data from probability samples is lacking in virtually all of these 
domains. Data from community samples indicate high rates of depression (44%) (38), 
suicidal ideation and attempts (54% and 31%, respectively) (11). Rates of excessive 
drinking were comparable to those among LGB people (22%), while rates of marijuana 
(24%) and other drugs (12%) were high (49). Transgender men reported lower quality of life 
than both female and male norms (Newfield et al., 2006). However, a review of quality of 
life after hormone therapy and transition indicated that the majority (80%) showed 
improvement, including more stable relationships, better psychosocial adjustment, overall

happiness and contentment (50, 51). Perceived financial, professional, and employment 
status also improved.

Intersectionality

Identity development and quality of life may be affected by sex, type of TGNC identity, 
sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, geographical location (52), and socioeconomic status (53). 
Study samples vary in representation of these characteristics. Transgender women are more 
often the focus than transgender men; few studies have focused on genderqueer / nonbinary 
identities (54). In public health research, inner-city transgender women of color are 
overrepresented because they carry a higher burden in HIV and its social determinants. In 
clinical samples, transgender women of color are underrepresented, reflecting unequal 
access to care. There are important differences based on these characteristics that need to be 
better understood to tailor interventions. For example, rural transgender men reported higher 
levels of depression and lower levels of self esteem than their urban counterparts (52), and 
genderqueer individuals reported higher levels of stigma than other TGNC individuals; their 
rates of depression and anxiety were higher (53% and 39%, respectively) (55–57).

Sexual and Reproductive Health

Sexual orientation

HIV

TGNC individuals may be attracted to men, women, and/or other TGNC people. Sexual 
orientation may affect transgender identity development and vice versa (58). For example, 
transgender men attracted to women may identify as lesbian before coming out as 
transgender, while other transgender men or women may not explore their attractions toward 
men until after transition (59, 24, 60, 61). Vulnerabilities and sexual health needs may differ 
by sexual orientation (62, 63).

Research has shown disproportionate prevalence of HIV, AIDS-related mortality, and 
uncontrolled viral load among transgender women (64, 11). Transgender men who have sex 
with men reported high rates of sexual risk behavior (62, 63, 65). Few tailored interventions 
have been tested (66, 67, 68, 8, 13, 69, 70, 71, 72), yet several trials are underway 
(R01HD057595; R01MH094323; UR6PS000422; R01MH106373, R34MH102109, 
R34DA038541). There are no transgender-specific guidelines for PrEP, despite evidence 
suggesting unique barriers to uptake and adherence (45, 73).

HIV-positive transgender women are less likely to receive Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) 
and showed worse adherence than other groups (74, 75). They face complex psychosocial 
challenges that complicate their access to HIV care, including past negative experiences, 
giving priority to transition-related care, and concerns about ART and hormone interactions 
(76, 77). Interventions need to address lack of adherence self-efficacy. Integration of 
hormonal and HIV care may facilitate adherence and decrease self-administered hormone 
use (78, 79).

Sexual functioning and satisfaction

Few studies have assessed sexual functioning. In an intervention study (69), TGNC 
participants reported difficulty getting aroused (38%), low sexual desire (34%), difficulty 
reaching orgasm alone or with a partner (35% and 28%, respectively); some transgender 
women attributed their sexual functioning problems to hormone therapy (13%). A review of 
research on sexual functioning after hormones and surgery, mostly conducted in Europe, 
found rates of low sexual desire among transgender women comparable to those of 
nontransgender women, while sexual desire of transgender men increased with hormone 
therapy and surgery (80).

Reproductive health

In a recent study of transgender men who had delivered a child, 80% used their own eggs, 
61% had used testosterone previously, and some pregnancies were unplanned (81). 
Questions remain about long-term fertility and best practices to preserve (before hormone 
therapy) or regain (after hormone therapy) fertility in both transgender men and women, and 
to retain ovaries after hysterectomy for possible future harvesting in transgender men. 
Questions also remain about the impact of prior testosterone use on a current pregnancy, 
how long before pregnancy testosterone should be discontinued, and how to counsel a 
pregnant patient who still has circulating testosterone levels.

Sex work

Sex work is common, particularly among transgender women, attributed to economic 
hardship, employment discrimination, and lack of health insurance coverage for 
transgender-specific care (82). HIV prevalence is more than five times as high among 
transgender compared to nontransgender female sex workers, and substantially higher than 
among transgender women not engaged in sex work (83). Qualitative research suggests that 
transgender women may be introduced to sex work by finding community on the street and, 
initially, as part of their quest to affirm gender identity (66). Research is needed to 
understand sex work in context of identity development and to test interventions aimed to 
reduce harm and improve sex work conditions (84).

Relationships, Family, and Community

Few studies have focused on TGNC people’s relationships and family. Of 10,739 articles in 
scholarly family therapy journals, only 9 focused on transgender issues (0.0008%) (85). 
Studies are mostly qualitative and samples are small. Some studies conceptualize how 
parents or spouses deal with a loved one’s transition, depicting loss, grief and cognitive 
restructuring (86, 87, 88). While family support is a protective factor in coping with 
minority stress and associated with better quality of life (38, 89, 90), family rejection is as 
high as 57% and 19% reported family violence (39). Among transgender women of color, 
family rejection in childhood had lifelong negative sequelae (91).

Research on families with a transgender parent is scarce. An early study by Green (92) 
showed that children of transgender parents did not differ from children raised in more 
traditional settings. A few studies examined changes in the parent-child relationship after

transition (93, 94, 39, 95, 96); younger age at transition and a positive relationship between 
parents proved protective (94).

TGNC people’s work life is also largely unexamined. Social stigma may disrupt or delay 
education and career development, and transgender people worry about the impact of 
transition on the job. In a U.S. national survey, 38% of transgender adults reported problems 
getting a job and 23% reported losing a job because of being transgender (38). TGNC 
people are more likely to be unemployed (33% vs. 12%) and live under the poverty level 
(31% vs. 9%) (53). Research is needed to better understand the challenges encountered in 
the workplace and how these can be prevented or overcome.

Incarceration is a public health concern disproportionately affecting transgender women. 
Among a U.S. sample of 3,878 transgender women, 19% reported incarceration (96). 
Transgender women of color were 1.8 to 3.3 times more likely to report incarceration than 
White women. The housing of TGNC people in custody in sex-segregated facilities and their 
access to care remain contentious. Interventions are needed for transgender women affected 
by the syndemic of incarceration, HIV, mental illness, and substance use (e.g., 
R34DA038541).

Brain Development

Research on the brain of TGNC individuals can clarify etiology of gender dysphoria and 
provide clinically relevant information about the effects of puberty suppression and gender-
affirming hormone therapy on the brain. Post mortem studies conducted in the Netherlands 
(97–100) have linked gender dysphoria to sex differences in the brain. MRI studies using 
voxel based morphometry, cortical thickness, and diffusion tensor imaging indicate that the 
transgender man’s brain phenotype consists of a mixture of feminine, masculine and 
defeminized characteristics, whereas the transgender woman’s phenotype consists of 
feminine, masculine and demasculinized characteristics (101–108). fMRI studies have 
focused on sexually dimorphic characteristics, such as mental rotation (109–111), 
handedness (112), and response to erotic stimuli (113–115). PET studies have addressed 
hypothalamic responses to putative pheromones acting in a sexually dimorphic manner 
(Berglund et al, 2008). These studies point toward the existence of distinct phenotypes of the 
brain for both transgender women and men. More integrative work is necessary to illuminate 
etiology and understand the effects of hormone therapy on the brain and related health and 
quality of life indicators.

Opportunities include testing the hypothesis that TGNC people may experience a form of 
intersexuality of the brain. For example, studies could correlate AR, ER, CYP19, CYP17 
and other gene polymorphisms and structural brain data. Another potential area of research 
concerns the role of body perception and image in the development of gender dysphoria 
(116–119). MRI cortical structural findings in both transgender women and men have shown 
initial support for such a role (120, 121). The neural network of body representation appears 
to differ between transgender and nontransgender individuals (122). For research on 
etiology, it should be recognized that TGNC people are not a homogeneous group. MRI

studies must compare the expression of sex differences in TGNC people of varying sexual 
orientation and age of onset of gender dysphoria.

While serious short-term complications of gender-affirming hormone therapy appear 
uncommon (123), the longer-term effects on vulnerability to cardiovascular disease, 
metabolic disease, and cancer are not well understood (124). Studies that examined the 
effects of hormones on the brain (125, 126, 121) showed dramatic changes in intracranial 
volume, cortical thickness, volume of sub-cortical structures, and fractional anisotropy. 
Transgender women experienced a decrease of gray matter that produces an expansion of 
the ventricles, while transgender men experienced an increase of intracranial volume, 
cortical thickness and FA values. These results were interpreted as deep changes in brain 
metabolism in relation to androgen suppression in transgender women and exogenous 
testosterone in transgender men (121).

Among nontrangender women, menopausal estrogen therapy has been associated with 
smaller regional volumes in frontal, temporal and limbic regions as well as the hippocampus 
(127, 128). Among women aged 65 and older, estrogen therapy was associated with greater 
brain atrophy (128). In addition, female sex steroids increase the risk of meningioma (129). 
These data are relevant for aging among TGNC people; the metabolic mechanism that 
produces changes in the brain of those receiving lifelong hormone therapy needs to be better 
understood.

Aging and End-of-Life

Transgender people aged 50 and older are at higher risk for poor physical health, disability, 
depression, and perceived stress (130) compared to their LGB counterparts. These 
differences are in part due to fear of accessing health services, lack of physical activity, 
internalized stigma, victimization, and lack of social support. Barriers to care are amplified 
by the lack of available culturally competent services. In addition, ageism, lack of affordable 
housing, and lack of family support appear to besiege TGNC older adults (131–136).

It is not uncommon for TGNC individuals to present for transition-related care in mid or 
later life when social, identity, and biological forces appear to converge and affect the 
clinical presentation (137). Changes in cortisol secretion and the down regulation of sex 
steroids and other hormones possibly intensify gender dysphoria (138). The impact of these 
factors on quality of life of transgender older adults has not been adequately studied.

A review of research on end-of-life care yielded no studies related to TGNC people in 
hospice or similar situations (139). This despite reports that transgender people fear that 
their gender identity will not be respected in long-term care and hospice facilities (140). One 
case report outlined some of the challenges transgender elders and their providers might face 
(141).

Recommendations for Future Research

Based on the above review and discussions at the May, 2015 NIH workshop on transgender 
health research, we recommend the following priority areas for future research on adult 
development and quality of life:

1. Intervention research to reduce stigma and promote resilience

Population studies with probability samples are needed to more accurately determine the 
prevalence and predictors of health concerns among TGNC people. This will inform 
research to understand the mechanism of how stigma and minority stress affect health; what 
constitutes resilience and how it develops over time; and what interventions (individual, 
family, community, and societal) can effectively promote health across the lifespan.

2. Impact of transition, medical and social, on quality of life

In addition to research on benefits and risks of medical interventions, the impact of 
transition on quality of life needs to be better understood. This includes mental health and 
wellbeing, education and employment, housing, social function, satisfaction and happiness.

3. Diversity in gender identity and expression (particularly for nonbinary identities), and 
ethnic/racial intersectionality

The full spectrum of diversity within this heterogeneous population needs to be further 
described and accounted for. This includes identifying heightened vulnerability for health 
concerns among subgroups based on type of transgender identity or race/ethnicity.

4. The role of family, social, and community support (incl. faith community) in quality of 
life

While social support has repeatedly been shown to serve as a protective factor, the various 
sources of support need to be better understood to inform interventions. This includes 
understanding the needs of families and communities.

5. Sexual and reproductive health, dating, relationships, sexual functioning and 
satisfaction, assisted reproductive technologies, and HIV

Sexual orientation and the impact of stigma on dating and relationships of TCNC people are 
understudied. Research is needed on sexual functioning and satisfaction, and how it is 
affected by transition-related care. While an increasing number of TGNC people access 
reproductive technologies, evidence to guide treatment lags behind. HIV remains a 
significant concern and research is needed to address transgender-specific risks and barriers 
to prevention and care. Evidence is lacking to inform appropriate screening for other sexual 
health concerns (e.g., pelvic and prostate exams).

6. The impact of medical interventions on brain development

Methodological advances are improving our understanding of brain development, providing 
new opportunities to understand how transgender-specific care affects the brain and related

health and quality of life indicators. Moreover, neuroscience can contribute to understanding 
sexual differentiation of the brain and its implications for health and human development.

7. Successful aging, including end-of-life care

A life course perspective should examine TGNC people’s quality of life across the lifespan 
while accounting for diversity in gender identity and expression (i.e., including nonbinary 
identities). We recommend a biospsychosocial approach, examining the impact of life 
course events, experiences, and interventions (e.g., hormone therapy) on the dimensions of 
successful aging (physical and mental health, social engagement and wellbeing).
