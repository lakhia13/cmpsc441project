Abstract

Cognitive theories suggest the manner in which individuals process trauma-related informa-
tion influences posttraumatic sequelae. Interpretations about trauma can be maladaptive
and lead to cognitive distortions implicated in the development of posttraumatic stress disor-
der (PTSD) through the processes of overaccommodation and assimilation. Alternatively,
adaptive interpretations about trauma through the process of accommodation can lead to
post-trauma resilience and recovery. The Trauma-Related Cognitions Scale (TRCS) pro-
vides a measure of beliefs associated with these cognitive processes. The TRCS was devel-
oped over the course of four phases. During Phase 1, 94 items derived from previously
validated trauma cognition/beliefs measures were aggregated with 40 items developed by
the authors. Phase 2 investigated the TRCS factor structure by fitting exploratory factor
analysis (EFA) models to data from a non-clinical sample, resulting in a reduced 69-item
TRCS representing four factors: the three theoretical cognitive processes of overaccommo-
dation, assimilation, and accommodation, and an additional optimism factor. Phases 3 and
4 fit confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models of the 69-item TRCS in a new non-clinical
and a clinical sample, respectively, and further validation analyses were conducted. Initial
evidence suggests the TRCS is a valid and reliable measure of trauma beliefs. Continued
validation can determine its utility in both research and clinical contexts.

Introduction

Most individuals experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime [1]. Although post-
traumatic stress symptoms are common reactions to traumatic events, the typical outcomes
following these events are recovery or resilience [2,3]. In fact, a large study with adults in the
U.S. (N = 2,953) estimated that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects less than 10% of
adults exposed to traumatic events [1]. Given that only a minority of trauma-exposed individ-
uals go on to develop PTSD, continued empirical identification of factors associated with the
development and/or maintenance of PTSD symptoms is warranted.

trauma-related sequelae [4–7]. Cognitive processes that have been implicated in the develop-
ment of posttraumatic stress symptoms include over-accommodation and assimilation [7,8],
while accommodation has been associated with recovery [9]. Accommodation involves the
alteration of cognitions to incorporate new post-trauma information, and is typically associ-
ated with balanced cognitions about the traumatic event, the self, and the world (e.g., “I was
hurt by another person, but that does not mean everyone is bad.”). By contrast, over-accom-
modation processes result in an alteration of post-trauma cognitions that are more extreme
and broader in nature, such as overgeneralizing (e.g., “People are inherently evil”) or catastro-
phizing (e.g. “My life will never be the same”). Assimilation involves altering new information
to maintain and reinforce pre-existing cognitions (e.g., “It is my fault this happened.”). These
theories suggest that erroneous or extreme interpretations of the causes and/or consequences
of the traumatic event interfere with recovery. Moreover, individuals may develop problematic
patterns of interpreting new information based on cognitive distortions developed post-
trauma. Distorted thinking may lead to avoidant behavioral and cognitive coping responses
intended to reduce the sense of threat (e.g., avoiding crowds due to fear of unknown danger,
constantly scanning one’s environment for threats even in relatively safe locations). However,
these strategies prevent change in event-related interpretations and instead maintain posttrau-
matic stress symptoms such as avoidance, irritability from physiological arousal, and distress
caused by intrusive thoughts and memories [10,11].

Trauma-related changes in cognitions have become explicitly recognized as diagnostic cri-
teria important to the development and trajectory of PTSD within the most recent edition of
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [12]. As part
of the revised diagnostic criteria of PTSD, a newly formulated symptom cluster, entitled nega-
tive alterations in cognitions and mood (NACM), was included to reflect and highlight post-
trauma changes in cognitions. In particular, NACM symptoms include changes in cognitions
about the self (e.g. “I am inadequate.”), others (e.g. “Everyone is malevolent.”), and the world
(e.g. “The world is a dangerous place.”), as well as cognitions regarding the meaning of post-
trauma symptoms (e.g. “I’m going crazy.”). Research has provided strong support for the addi-
tion of cognitive symptoms to the diagnostic criteria for PTSD [13]. Confirmatory factor anal-
yses conducted with two large surveys [1,14] indicated that the new four cluster model of
PTSD (re-experiencing; avoidance; hyperarousal and reactivity; negative alterations in cogni-
tions and mood) provided a better fit to the data than the previous three cluster model of
PTSD that excluded NACM [14]. Moreover, cognitive distortions captured within the NACM
cluster have been shown to predict the development, chronicity, and severity of PTSD, as well
as functional impairment associated with PTSD symptoms [10,11,15,16].

Accordingly, a central component in many empirically supported treatments for PTSD is
the targeting of trauma-related cognitions. In particular, evidence has shown belief change to
be one mechanism by which cognitive-behavioral treatments for PTSD have led to reductions
in symptom severity [17–20]. In one of the first outcome studies examining the efficacy of
Cognitive Therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD) it was observed that reduction in negative trauma-
related cognitions resulted in a reduction in PTSD symptoms over the course of CT-PTSD in a
treatment-seeking community sample, though it should be noted that the cell sizes for both
the intervention and waitlist conditions were quite small (n = 14) [21]. While trauma-related
cognitions are not specifically targeted for change in Prolonged Exposure (PE) [22], a first line
treatment for PTSD that indirectly challenges trauma-related cognitions, a recent study with
female survivors of assault enrolled in PE showed that changes in PTSD-related cognitions
predicted subsequent changes in PTSD symptoms overall; PTSD symptom reduction did not
predict change in cognitions [20]. Further, a recent longitudinal study found reductions in
trauma-related cognitions were related to reductions in posttraumatic stress symptoms up to

10 years after treatment in a sample of 171 women randomized to either Prolonged Exposure
or Cognitive Processing Therapy treatments for PTSD [23].

Currently, measures that tap into trauma-related cognitions include the Posttraumatic Cog-

nitions Inventory (PTCI) [24]; World Assumptions Scales (WAS) [25], Trauma and Attach-
ment Belief Scale (TABS) [26], Trauma-Related Guilt Inventory (TRGI) [27], Trauma
Appraisal Questionnaire (TAQ) [28], and Posttraumatic Maladaptive Beliefs Scale (PMBS)
[29]. These measures have contributed significantly to an understanding of trauma-related
cognitions involved in the trajectory of, and recovery from, PTSD symptoms. Yet, the existing
measures do not assess the full range of trauma cognitions associated with all three cognitive
processes discussed. That is, existing measures generally provide either information on assimi-
lated cognitions or overaccommodated cognitions. These tools are useful in identifying erro-
neous and extreme cognitions, yet they fail to assess accommodated cognitions.
Accommodated cognitions reflect balanced thinking about the causes and consequences of the
traumatic event and may be important in assessing changes associated with recovery in
trauma-focused therapy.

The primary aim of the current study was to develop a measure of cognitions consistent
with the cognitive processes involved in the development and maintenance of PTSD, and one
that is theory-driven and aligned with evidence-based cognitive-behavioral trauma-focused
therapies. Moreover, our goal was to take a first step in developing an assessment tool that
would be useful in both research and clinical contexts. A comprehensive trauma cognitions
measure that taps into all three cognitive processes would be beneficial to inform treatment
planning and evaluate treatment effects over time. Because research has shown that exposure
to interpersonal trauma (i.e., trauma committed at the hands of another human) is the stron-
gest correlate of cognitive symptoms of PTSD [30], the present study used samples of interper-
sonal trauma survivors to develop the trauma cognitions measure across the final phases of the
study.

Method

Scale construction was carried out across four phases. In the Item Generation Phase (Phase 1),
the initial version of the Trauma-Related Cognitions Scale (TRCS) was created with items
gathered from several validated and reliable trauma cognitions/beliefs measures in open
access, as well as items generated by the first, second, and fourth author, who are all clinical
research experts in trauma psychology and licensed clinical psychologists trained in trauma-
focused therapy. Permission to use items from pre-existing scales was secured by the original
authors of those scales. In the Exploratory Factor Analysis Phase (Phase 2), the initial version
of the TRCS was administered to a non-clinical sample and an exploratory factor analysis was
fit to the data to explore the factor structure and reduce TRCS items. This study was approved
by Northern Illinois University’s Institutional Review Board and no adverse events were
reported. In the Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Validity Assessment Phase (Phase 3), a con-
firmatory factor analysis (CFA) model was fit to the data from a second non-clinical trauma
sample to confirm the empirical measurement model identified in Phase 2; criterion-related,
convergent and discriminant, concurrent, and incremental validity were also examined. This
study was approved by Northern Illinois University’s Institutional Review Board and no
adverse events were reported. In Phase 4, a CFA model was fit to data from a clinical sample
presenting for trauma-focused therapy at an outpatient community mental health clinic, and
validity was further assessed in this sample. This study was approved by the University of Cali-
fornia, San Francisco medical center’s Institutional Review Board and no adverse events were
reported.

Phase 1: Item generation
Phase 1 method

Phase 1 measures.

Items for the TRCS were chosen from trauma cognitions measures

with permission from original authors granted to the research team, including the PTCI [24],
WAS [25], TRGI [27], TAQ [28], and PMBS [29]. The five instruments included a total of 169
items.

The PTCI is a 36-item self-report measure of trauma-related cognitions. It contains three
subscales: (1) Negative Cognitions about Self (“I am a weak person”), (2) Negative Cognitions
about the World (“The world is a dangerous place”), and (3) Self Blame (“The event happened
to me because of the sort of person I am”). Internal consistency coefficients in the development
study ranged from α = .86 to α = .97 [24].

The WAS is a 32-item scale that measures participants’ assumptions on eight subscales,
including benevolence of the world, benevolence of people, justice, controllability, random-
ness, self-worth, self-controllability and luck. Sample items include the following: “There is
more good than evil in the world” (benevolence of the world), “People are naturally unfriendly
and unkind” (benevolence of people, reverse scored) and “I have reason to be ashamed of my
personal character” (self-worth). Internal consistency for the WAS in the development sample
ranged from α = .68 to α = .86 [25].

The TRGI is a 32-item measure that assesses cognitive and emotional aspects of guilt associ-

ated with traumatic events. The TRGI includes a Global Guilt Scale, a Distress Scale, and a
Guilt Cognitions Scale composed of three subscales: Hindsight-Bias/Responsibility (“I could
have prevented what happened to me”), Wrongdoing (“I did something that went against my
values”), and Lack of Justification (“What I did made sense” reverse scored). For the purposes
of this study, only the 16 items from the subscales of Hindsight-Bias/Responsibility, Wrongdo-
ing, and Lack of Justification were used. The TRGI has adequate to excellent internal consis-
tency (α = .60 to .91), adequate temporal stability (.73 to .86), and concurrent validity [27].

The TAQ is a 54-item measure of posttraumatic appraisals that taps cognitions, emotions,
and behaviors of six categories: Fear (“Danger was always present”), Betrayal (“Important peo-
ple such as a parent, lover, friend let this happen to me”), Self-blame (“I must have done some-
thing really awful to make this happen”), Shame (“No shower can wash away how dirty I felt”),
Alienation (“I felt lonely”), and Anger (“I felt rage”). Internal consistency ranged from .83 to
.90 across three samples in the development of the TAQ, and test-retest reliability ranged from
.73 to .88 across three to eight weeks [28].

The PMBS is a 15-item measure of maladaptive beliefs about current life circumstances that

may occur following trauma exposure. It assesses maladaptive cognitions within three
domains: Threat of Harm (“I don’t feel safe anywhere anymore”), Self-Worth and Judgment
(“I am a good person”), and Reliability and Trustworthiness of Others (“Some people can be
trusted”). Internal consistency for the subscales is adequate (ranging from α = .71 to .76) [29].
Items were selected from the five validated and reliable trauma cogni-
tions measures if they referred to a cognition. Several items that were not selected referred to a
specific feeling (e.g., PMBS: I feel dead inside), the cognition of the trauma at the time of occur-
rence (e.g., TAQ: I didn’t know whether I would live or die), a general opinion (e.g., WAS; I am
luckier than most people), a behavioral fact (e.g., WAS; I take the actions necessary to protect
myself against misfortune), or were redundant with other items already selected. In total, 59
items were not retained: 38 were dropped because of content (4 items from the PTCI, 38 items
from the TAQ, 8 items from the WAS, and 2 items from the PMBS) and an additional 7 items
were redundant (1 item from the TRGI, 2 items from the WAS, and 4 items from the PMBS).
This procedure resulted in retention of 94 items, 11 of which were re-worded to refer to a

present cognition (e.g., TAQ: I was a bad person was re-worded to I am a bad person) and to
make items more concise.

From the pool of 94 items that were retained, the first, second, and fourth authors indepen-
dently coded all items into one of three categories (1) overaccommodation, (2) assimilation, or
(3) accommodation. The three authors then met to compare their independent codes and dis-
cuss any discrepancies until consensus was reached for which scale each item should be placed.
Overaccommodation was represented by 46 items (27 items from the PTCI, 7 items from the
TAQ, 12 items from the PMBS). Assimilation was represented by 38 items (15 items from the
TRGI, 5 items from the PTCI, 9 items from the TAQ, 9 items from the WAS). Accommoda-
tion was represented by 10 items (7 items from the WAS, 3 items from the PMBS). After read-
ing through item content for each subscale, it was agreed that additional items would be
created to increase content validity. The first, second, and fourth authors independently cre-
ated 8 provisional assimilation items and 87 provisional accommodation items. The higher
number of accommodation items was created because few items from the existing scales were
coded as representative of accommodative processes by the research team. After the creation
of these items, the first, second, and fourth authors compared the independently created items
to those from the 5 published instruments. Redundant items were discussed, and the authors
came to consensus with the best wording for redundant and nonredundant items. Five items
were added to the assimilation subscale and 35 items were added to the accommodation sub-
scale. In total, the preliminary TRCS was represented by 134 items among the three subscales
of overaccommodation (46 items), assimilation (43 items), and accommodation (45 items).

Finally, given the original five trauma cognitions measures had different response options,
we standardized the TRCS anchors and chose six response options. Directions to complete the
TRCS were modeled after the PTCI [24], and were as follows:

We are interested in the kind of thoughts which you may have had after a traumatic experi-
ence. Below are a number of statements that may or may not be representative of your
thinking.

Please read each statement carefully and tell us how much you AGREE or DISAGREE with
each statement using the following rating scale: 1 (strongly disagree), 2 (disagree), 3 (some-
what disagree), 4 (somewhat agree), 5 (agree), 6 (strongly agree). People react to traumatic
events in many different ways. There are no right or wrong answers to these statements.
Instructions were kept consistent throughout all study phases.

Phase 2: Non-clinical sample #1 exploratory factor analysis
Phase 2 method

Phase 2 participants and recruitment procedure. The Exploratory Factor Analysis Phase
collected and analyzed TRCS data from a non-clinical sample. The sample included 815 partic-
ipants: 509 (62.5%) community individuals recruited in 2013 through Amazon’s Mechanical
Turk (MTurk) who completed the study for small payments as well as 306 (37.5%) undergrad-
uate students from a large Midwestern university who completed the study for course credit.
Studies have found MTurk samples to be more socio-economically and ethnically diverse than
participants recruited via social media postings and university settings, with indistinguishable
test responses across samples that complete testing online and in-person. Thus, researchers
have suggested that MTurk data is as reliable as those obtained via traditional methods [31,32].
Participants age 18 and above provided electronic consent to complete the TRCS, the Trau-
matic Life Events Questionnaire, and other measures described below online as part of a larger

study. Following the completion of the study, participants were thanked for their participation
and provided a debriefing form.

The average age of participants was 27.38 (SD = 10.30), ranging from 18 to 67. The majority

of participants identified as male (54.3%) and identified their race as Caucasian/White
(59.9%); 10.3% identified as African American, 21.7% identified as Asian, 1.1% identified as
American Indian or Alaskan Native, 0.8% identified as Native Hawaiian/another Pacific
Islander, 2.5% identified as Biracial, 0.8% reported Unknown, and 2.8% preferred not to
answer; 10.4% identified their ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino. About a quarter of participants
had a college degree (24.5%), 21% reported having some high school, 16.4% reported having a
high school degree/GED, 17.5% reported having some college/vocational training, 2.0%
reported having some graduate training, and 14.2% reported having a graduate degree. The
majority were employed full-time (35.1%) or part-time (27.1%), and were single (45.8%) or
dating (19.4%). The majority of participants had experienced a potentially traumatic event (see
Table 1).

Phase 2 measures. Trauma cognitions. The original 134-item TRCS was used to assess

trauma cognitions.

Trauma history. Potential traumatic experiences were identified using the Traumatic Life
Events Questionnaire (TLEQ) [33], a 23-item broad-spectrum measure of trauma exposure.

Items ask respondents to identify how many times they have experienced a particular event
using the following rating scale: never (0), once (1), twice (2), 3 times (3), 4 times (4), 5 times
(5), and more than 5 times (6). In one study utilizing a clinical sample, the TLEQ demonstrated
a higher rate of identification of traumatic events compared to the Structured Clinical Inter-
view for DSM-IV (SCID) [34].

Phase 2 data analysis plan. Exploratory factor analysis models with direct oblimin (obli-
que) rotation were fit to the respondent data on the 134-item initial TRCS. Data were assumed
missing at random and missing data were deleted listwise. Factor solutions with varying num-
bers of factors (i.e., 2, 3, 4, and 5) were generated and the 4-factor solution was chosen as it
offered a combination of theoretical appeal and parsimony. Items with maximum absolute fac-
tor pattern loadings below .30 and items that cross-loaded (loaded on two or more factors)
were dropped if the larger factor loading was less than twice as large as the lesser loading [35].
Following EFA modeling, scale scores were calculated for each factor by averaging each
respondent’s corresponding item scores, such that scale scores had a possible range from 1–6.
Inter-scale correlations and Cronbach alphas were estimated.

Phase 2 results

Phase 2 exploratory factor analysis. The chosen exploratory factor analysis model

retained 69 items representing the three hypothesized factors of Overaccommodation (e.g., "I
can’t deal with even the slightest upset"; "My life has been destroyed by the trauma"; 25 items;
α = .97), Assimilation (e.g., "I blame myself for what happened"; "What I did was inconsistent
with my beliefs"; 13 items; α = .94), and Accommodation (e.g., "Life is sometimes a gamble";
"Life is about surviving challenging events"; 15 items, α = .89). In addition, an Optimism factor
emerged that was not hypothesized, but made substantive sense (e.g., "The world is a good
place"; "Most people are basically caring"; 16 items; α = .93; Table 2).

Between 10% and 20% of data values were missing. A missing data rate of 15% to 20% is
common in psychological studies [36]. These four factors explained a total of 49.83% of total
response variation. Scale score means, standard deviations, and inter-correlations are pre-
sented in Table 3. Item endorsement on each scale suggested participants ‘disagreed’ to ‘some-
what disagreed’ with items assessing overaccommodation; were ambivalent about items that
assessed assimilation, with average item ratings ranging between ‘somewhat disagree’ to
‘somewhat agree’; and generally agreed with items that assessed accommodation and opti-
mism, with average item ratings between ‘somewhat agree’ and ‘agree.’ For each scale, internal
consistency reliability was very good to excellent [37]. Overaccommodation was positively
associated with assimilation and negatively associated with optimism; assimilation was posi-
tively associated with accommodation; and accommodation was positively associated with
optimism (Table 3).

or psychological injury on another human being; n = 651). Interpersonal traumas were
selected based upon TLEQ responses using the same procedure as Frazier and colleagues [39],
except for abortion, which was not conceptualized in this study as an interpersonal trauma.
Participants selected for interpersonal trauma, compared to those who were dropped from
analyses, reported significantly more posttraumatic stress on the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Ver-
sion (PCL-C; described below) [40], t(994) = 8.34, p < .001. Using the most stringent cut-
point score of 50, 25.8% would be considered PTSD positive in the interpersonal trauma sub-
sample; whereas, 12.7% in the non-trauma sub-sample would be considered PTSD positive.
Phase 3 measures. Trauma cognitions. The reduced 69-item TRCS from the previous

phase was used.

Trauma history. The TLEQ was used to assess potential traumatic experiences.
PTSD symptoms. The PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) [40] was used to assess
PTSD symptoms. The PCL-C is a 17-item self-report scale for posttraumatic stress based on
DSM-IV criteria. Items are rated from 1 (Not at All) to 5 (Extremely). A total severity score is
obtained by summing scores from each of the 17 items. The PCL-C has demonstrated high
internal consistency ranging from .92 to .96 in community samples, and has shown convergent
validity with other measures of posttraumatic stress and discriminant validity with measures
of separate psychological constructs [41]. Internal consistency in the subsample selected for
interpersonal trauma was α = .95.

Depressive symptoms. The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [42] is a 21-item self-
report measure for assessing the severity of depression. Items are scored from 0 to 3 with dif-
ferent anchors for each item (e.g., 1 = I do not feel sad to 3 = I am so sad or unhappy that I can’t
stand it), with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. The average test-
retest reliability is r = .93 and the average internal consistency is α = .92 [42]. In the Phase 3
sample, internal consistency was α = .94.

Resilience. The Brief Resilience Scale [43] is a 6-item measure that operationalizes resilience
as bouncing back from stress (“It does not take long to recover from a stressful event”). Items

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250221 April 15, 2021

10 / 23

PLOS ONETrauma Cognitions Scale

are rated from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree). Three items are reverse scored, and
all items summed, with higher scores indicating greater resiliency. Internal consistency for this
scale is adequate, ranging from .80 to .91 across four samples [43]. In the Phase 3 sample, inter-
nal consistency was α = .85.

Personality. The Big Five Inventory [44] consists of 44 short-phrase items, rated on a five-
point scale from 1 (Disagree Strongly) to 5 (Agree Strongly), that represent the core traits that
define the Big Five personality domains of Extraversion (“Is outgoing, sociable”), Neuroticism
(“Worries a lot”), Conscientiousness (“Does a thorough job”), Agreeableness (“Has a forgiving
nature”), and Openness to Experience (“Is ingenious, a deep thinker”). Internal consistency in
this sample ranged from .74 (Agreeableness) to .86 (Neuroticism).

Trait anxiety. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [45] was used to assess trait-anxiety, a rela-

tively stable individual difference in anxiety proneness and the tendency to perceive stressful
situations as dangerous or threatening. Trait anxiety was measured with 10 items (“I feel ner-
vous and restless”) on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (Almost Never) to 4 (Almost Always).
Internal consistency across different samples ranged from .89 to .91. Internal consistency in
this sample was (α = .91).

Trauma beliefs. The TABS [26] is an 84-item self-report assessment of cognitive schemas
(beliefs about oneself and about others). The TABS measures beliefs related to five need areas
that are sensitive to the effects of traumatic experiences: safety, trust, esteem, intimacy, and
control. Within each need area, separate sets of items tap into beliefs about oneself and beliefs
about others. Items are rated from 1 (Disagree Strongly) to 6 (Agree Strongly), with higher
scores indicating more negative beliefs about oneself and others. Internal consistency (.67 to
.87) and test-retest reliabilities (.60 to .79) for the TABS subscales are adequate [26]. Internal
consistency in this sample ranged from .85 (Intimacy) to .92 (Control).

Phase 3 data analysis plan. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model was fit using LIS-
REL 8.72 as a confirmatory test of the 69-item, four-factor TRCS measurement model empiri-
cally identified by the Phase 2 EFA model. Model fit was assessed by the Satorra-Bentler scaled
chi-square (χ2
SB) [46], the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) [47], and the
comparative fit index (CFI) [48]. RMSEA values �.06 and CFI values � .95 are thought to sug-
gest approximate model fit [49]. Across 69 items, 3.3% of data values were missing. To accom-
modate missing data the CFA model was fit to multiply imputed data and the asymptotic
covariance matrix of item variances and covariances was estimated via the bootstrap. Follow-
ing CFA modeling, scale scores were calculated for each factor. Inter-scale correlations and
Cronbach alphas were estimated.

Phase 3 results

Phase 3 confirmatory factor analysis. The 4-factor, 69-item CFA model fit well: Satorra-

Bentler χ2(2271) = 7394.72, p < .0001; RMSEA = 0.059; CFI = 0.967. See Table 2 for factor
loadings. The four factors demonstrated high internal consistency reliability in the Phase 3
sample of non-clinical participants selected for interpersonal trauma exposure: Overaccom-
modation (α = .97), Assimilation (α = .93), Accommodation (α = .87), Optimism (α = .90).
Scale score means, standard deviations, and inter-correlations are presented in Table 3. In this
non-clinical sample selected for interpersonal trauma, it was found that item endorsement on
each scale suggested participants ‘disagreed’ to ‘somewhat disagreed’ with items assessing over-
accommodation; were ambivalent about items assessing assimilation, with average item ratings
ranging between ‘somewhat disagree’ to somewhat agree’; and generally agreed with items
assessing accommodation and optimism, with average items ratings between ‘somewhat agree’
and ‘agree.’ Again, similar to Phase 2 results, overaccommodation was highly positively

associated with assimilation and negatively associated with optimism; assimilation was posi-
tively associated with accommodation; and accommodation was moderately positively associ-
ated with optimism.

Phase 3 criterion-related validity. Known groups validity. Not surprisingly, participants

from the Phase 3 sample who endorsed experiencing interpersonal trauma(s), compared to
those who did not, scored significantly higher on Overaccommodation (t[993] = 4.24, p <
.001), Assimilation (t[990] = 4.37, p < .001), and Accommodation (t[993] = 4.71, p < .001),
although there was no significant difference on Optimism (t[993] = 0.99, p = .337). Addition-
ally, increased endorsement of interpersonal traumas was associated with more overaccommo-
dation, assimilation, accommodation, and less optimism (Table 4; ps > .05).

Convergent and discriminant validity. See Table 4 for bivariate correlations between the

four TRCS subscales and both trauma beliefs and personality factors.

Concurrent validity. The TRCS subscales correlated highly and in expected directions with

measures of resilience and psychopathology, including depression and posttraumatic stress
(see Table 4). A multiple linear regression analysis modeling resilience, with TRCS positive
subscales entered simultaneously, found that optimism (standardized β = .43, p < .001) and
accommodation (β = -.14, p < .001) were unique predictors of resilience, though in opposite
directions (Adjusted R2 = .16, F [2, 616] = 57.51, p < .001). A multiple linear regression analysis
modeling posttraumatic stress symptom severity, with TRCS negative subscales entered simul-
taneously, found that both assimilation (β = .09, p = .019) and overaccommodation (β = .62; p
< .001) were unique predictors of posttraumatic stress (Adjusted R2 = .47, F [2, 649] = 287.49,

p < .001). A multiple linear regression analysis modeling depression symptom severity, with
TRCS negative subscales entered simultaneously, found only overaccommodation (β = .59, p
< .001) and not assimilation (β = .03; p = .473) was a unique predictor of depression (Adjusted
R2 = .37, F [2, 648] = 193.87, p < .001).

Incremental validity. To examine whether there was a relation between the TRCS negative

subscales and posttraumatic stress symptom severity when variation in trauma- and attach-
ment-related beliefs were controlled, we fit two linear regression models including the five
trauma- and attachment-related beliefs from the TABS (trust, safety, control, esteem, inti-
macy) entered on step 1 and either Overaccommodation (Adjusted R2 = .50; F [6, 643] =
108.54, p < .001) or Assimilation (Adjusted R2 = .46; F [6, 643] = 90.44, p < .001) entered on
step 2 in two different models. Overaccommodation (ΔR2 = .07, β = .50, p < .001) and Assimi-
lation (ΔR2 = .02, β = .20, p < .001) remained unique predictors of posttraumatic stress after
controlling for trauma- and attachment-related beliefs.

Phase 4: Clinical sample confirmatory factor analysis and validity
assessment
Phase 4 method

Phase 4 participants and recruitment procedure. Participants included 73 acute victims
of crime who were presenting for weekly trauma-focused therapy from 2015 to 2016 with one
of 17 clinicians at a community mental health clinic in a large metropolitan area on the U.S.
West Coast. Clinicians at the community mental health clinic approached potential clients
during an intake evaluation about participating in the study, and those who expressed interest
in participating met with a research assistant to learn more about the study. After providing
written informed consent, participants were given a questionnaire packet that took approxi-
mately 45 minutes to complete. Demographic data, trauma history, and psychiatric diagnoses
assessed at intake were extracted from clinical records. Following the completion of the packet
of questionnaires, participants were thanked for their time and debriefed. They were provided
a payment of $20 for their time.

The average age of participants was 41.28 (SD = 13.80), ranging from 21 to 87. The majority
of participants identified as female (60.3%). Participants were racially diverse: 33.2% identified
as Hispanic, 24.7% identified as Caucasian/White, 13.7% identified as African American/
Black, 9.6% identified as Asian/Pacific Islander, 1.4% identified as biracial, 15.1% specified
’Other’ as their race, and 1.4% declined to provide a response. The majority of participants
identified as heterosexual (58.9%); 13.7% identified as homosexual, 5.5% identified as bisexual,
21.9% either did not provide or declined to provide their sexual orientation.

Phase 4 measures and summary statistics. Trauma cognitions. In Phase 4, the reduced
69-item TRCS that resulted from the Phase 2 EFA and that was confirmed in the Phase 3 CFA
was administered.

Trauma history. Trauma history was assessed in 63 participants with the Trauma History
Screen (THS) [50] during an intake evaluation at the community mental health clinic before
clients enrolled in trauma services at the clinic. The THS is a 14-item self-report measure that
assesses exposure to a variety of traumatic events, 13 specific types of events (e.g., car accident,
sexual assault, physical assault, natural disaster, etc.) and one “other” event. During the intake
interview, for each event, participants were asked to indicate whether they experienced the
event (“yes” or “no”). The average number of types of trauma experienced, as assessed by the
THS, was 4.81 (SD = 2.93) and ranged up to 12 discrete traumas (Table 5).

To be eligible for trauma services at the clinic, the client had to be a victim of a crime within

the last 3 years, or a survivor of torture in another country, or a family member of a homicide

victim. The index trauma that precipitated mental health treatment at the clinic was identified
for 64 participants during the intake evaluation. Most participants identified sexual assault
(32.9%), followed by physical assault (26%); 9.6% were family members of homicide victims,
5.5% were refugees or victims of torture in their home country, 4.1% were victims of vehicular
assault, 2.7% were victims of a stabbing, 2.7% were victims of attempted murder, 1.4% were vic-
tims of a shooting, and 2.7% of participants reported another type of crime as their index trauma.
Psychiatric diagnoses. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed for 63 participants during an
intake evaluation before clients enrolled in trauma services at the community mental health
clinic by clinicians who conducted a clinical interview and utilized symptom checklists to
identify psychiatric symptoms. After the intake, clinicians met weekly for an intake meeting to
solidify psychiatric diagnoses made during the intake. Almost all of the sample (92.1%) met
criteria for PTSD or another Trauma-and-Stressor-Related Disorder as defined by the DSM-5
[12]. The average number of diagnoses was 2.11 (SD = 1.44), ranging from zero (two partici-
pants did not meet criteria for any disorder) to eight (in the case of multiple substance use dis-
orders), with a Depressive Disorder being the most common co-morbid diagnosis (39.7%).
Other diagnoses included a Substance Use Disorder (19.1%), Anxiety Disorder (16.4%), Bipo-
lar Disorder (4.8%), Psychotic Disorder (3.2%), Eating Disorder (3.2%), or Gender Dysphoria
(1.6%).

PTSD symptoms. The PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) [40] and the PTSD Check-
list for DSM-5 (PCL-5) [51] were both used to assess PTSD symptoms. The PCL-5 is a 20-item
self-report scale for posttraumatic stress based on DSM-5 criteria. Items are rated from 0 (Not
at All) to 4 (Extremely). A total severity score is obtained by summing scores from each of the
20 items. Internal consistency for the PCL-5 has ranged from .91 (military service member
sample seeking treatment) [52] to .94 (college sample) [53]. Part way through data collection,
the clinic switched from using the PCL-C to the PCL-5 to assess posttraumatic stress as the
new PCL version became available after the release of the DSM-5 [12]. Researchers at the clinic
created a crosswalk between the two versions (i.e., a scoring rubric was created to produce
scores that were equivalent across both versions of the measure). The PCL total is used as the

PLOS ONETrauma Cognitions Scale

PTSD severity score in this Phase. The PCL was administered prior to initiating trauma-
focused therapy (baseline), as well as the beginning of sessions 8 and 16. Internal consistency
for the PCL total in this sample ranged from .89 (baseline) to .93 (session 16).

Depressive symptoms. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [54] is a 9-item self-report assess-
ment that can be used as a continuous measure of depressive symptoms. Items ask participants
to rate if they have been bothered by each symptom (e.g., “Little pleasure or interest in doing
things”) in the past 2 weeks on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). A total severity
score is obtained by summing the scores from each item. Internal consistency has ranged from
.86 to .92 in several different samples [55]. The PHQ-9 was administered prior to initiating
trauma-focused therapy (baseline), as well as the beginning of sessions 8 and 16. Internal con-
sistency in this sample ranged from .79 (baseline) to .89 (therapy session 16).

Resilience. The Brief Resilience Scale [43] was used to assess resilience. In the Phase 4 sam-

ple, internal consistency was α = .84.

Personality. The Big Five Inventory [44] assessed the Big Five personality domains. Internal

consistency ranged from .70 (Agreeableness) to .83 (Neuroticism).

Trait anxiety. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [45] was used to assess trait-anxiety. Inter-

nal consistency in this sample was (α = .91).

Trauma beliefs. The TABS [26] assessed beliefs related to five need areas that are sensitive to

the effects of traumatic experiences- safety, trust, esteem, intimacy, and control. Internal con-
sistency in this sample ranged from .78 (Control) to .83 (Trust).

Phase 4 data analysis plan. Again, a four-factor confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
model was fit to the 69-item TRCS data. Across 69 items, 3.3% of data values were missing.
Across 69 items, 0.54% of data values were missing. To accommodate missing data the CFA
model was fit to multiply imputed data and the asymptotic covariance matrix of item variances
and covariances was estimated via the bootstrap. Following CFA modeling, scale scores were
calculated for each factor, and reliability and validity assessments conducted.

Phase 4 results

Phase 4 confirmatory factor analysis. The TRCS 69-item, 4-factor CFA model was fit to

clinical sample data: Satorra-Bentler χ2
CFI = 0.916. Several factor loadings had low values (Table 2) and given the relatively low CFI
value, we next fit a modified model that dropped the 18 items with factor loadings <0.409. The
resulting 51-item, 4-factor model had improved fit: Satorra-Bentler χ2(1218) = 1523.08, p <
.001; RMSEA = 0.059; CFI = 0.948.

SB(2271) = 2858.91, p < .001; RMSEA = 0.060;

Item endorsement on each scale suggested participants ‘disagreed’ to ‘somewhat disagreed’
with items assessing overaccommodation; were ambivalent about items that assessed assimila-
tion, with average item ratings ranging between ‘somewhat disagree’ to ‘somewhat agree’; and
generally agreed with items that assessed accommodation and optimism, as average item rat-
ings were between ‘somewhat agree’ to ‘agree’ (see Table 6). Internal consistency reliability
ranged from .62 (accommodation) to .92 (overaccommodation). Overaccommodation was
positively and negatively associated with assimilation and optimism, respectively. However,
accommodation was not significantly associated with any subscale.

Phase 4 criterion-related validity. Convergent and discriminant validity. See Table 7 for
bivariate correlations between the four TRCS subscales and both trauma beliefs and personal-
ity factors.

Concurrent validity. The TRCS subscales correlated in expected directions with measures of
resilience, depression, and posttraumatic stress (see Table 7). A multiple linear regression anal-
ysis modeling resilience, with TRCS positive subscales entered simultaneously, found only

assimilation (β = -.11; p = .394) was a unique predictor of posttraumatic stress (Adjusted R2 =
.14, F [2, 72] = 6.78, p = .002). A multiple linear regression analysis modeling depression symp-
tom severity, with TRCS negative subscales entered simultaneously, found only overaccommo-
dation (β = .50, p < .001) and not assimilation (β = .07; p = .562) was a unique predictor of
depression (Adjusted R2 = .26, F [2, 72] = 13.55, p < .001).

Incremental validity. To examine whether there was a relation between the TRCS negative

subscales and posttraumatic stress symptom severity when variation in trauma- and attach-
ment-related beliefs were controlled, we fit two linear regression models including the five
trauma- and attachment-related beliefs from the TABS entered on step 1 and either Overac-
commodation (Adjusted R2 = .10; F [6, 68] = 1.07, p = .044) or Assimilation (Adjusted R2 = .00;
F [6, 68] = 0.95, p = .466) entered on step 2 in two different models. Overaccommodation (ΔR2
= .11, β = .41, p = .006) but not Assimilation (ΔR2 = .01, β = .09, p = .516) was a unique predic-
tor of posttraumatic stress after controlling for trauma- and attachment-related beliefs.

Predictive validity. The PCL and the PHQ9 were assessed longitudinally. For each outcome,

we fit five linear mixed effect longitudinal models. The first model included the 3-category
assessment time indicator as the only X variable (baseline/pre-therapy, week 8, and week 16).
This base model estimated the longitudinal effect of therapy on the corresponding outcome.
Subsequently, four augmented models were fit; each included one TRCS scale as well as the
interaction between the TRCS scale and the assessment time indicator. Non-significant inter-
action effects were dropped and the augmented model refit. Augmented models with no inter-
action term estimated the time-averaged effect of the modeled TRCS scale on the
corresponding outcome. Models including an interaction term estimated time-specific effects
of the modeled TRCS scale on the outcome. Each model included random effects for clinicians
and patients and assumed data were missing at random (MAR), conditional on modeled
variables.

Both the PCL and PHQ9 were completed by 73 (100%), 64 (87.7%), and 47 (64.4%) clients
at the three assessments, respectively. The PCL means equaled 47.7, 27.7, and 22.8 at the three
assessments. Base model tests of the baseline PCL mean versus the 8- and 16-week means were
significant (both p < .001) and the 8- and 16-week means significantly differed (p = .036); this
pattern also was observed in each augmented model. The interaction term was dropped from
each augmented PCL model (p-values ranged from .217 to .826). Linear regression parameter
estimates for the time-averaged effect of each TRCS scale on PCL scores follow: overaccommo-
dation, b = 9.61, p < .001; assimilation, b = 0.03, p = .982; accommodation, b = 13.16, p < .001;
and optimism, b = −8.72, p < .001. For example, a one-point increase on the TRCS overac-
commodation scale corresponded to an expected 9.61-point increase on the PCL.

The PHQ9 means equaled 14.9, 7.4, and 7.6 at the three assessments. Base model tests of the

baseline PHQ9 mean versus the 8- and 16-week means were significant (both p < .001), but
the 8- and 16-week means did not significantly differ (p = .867); this pattern held in each aug-
mented model. The interaction effect was dropped from three of the augmented PHQ9 models
(p-values ranged from .667 to .984) and the linear regression parameter estimates for the corre-
sponding time-averaged effects follow: overaccommodation, b = 3.90, p < .001; accommoda-
tion, b = 3.76, p = .004; and optimism, b = −8.72, p < .001. A significant interaction effect
between assimilation and assessment time (p = .048) resulted in time-specific effects of assimi-
lation on PHQ9: pre-therapy, b = 1.80, p = .008; 8 weeks, b = −0.08, p = .909; and 16 weeks
b = 0.22, p = .785). The pre-therapy effect significantly differed from the 8-week effect (p =
.021) and marginally differed from the 16-week effect (p = .071). Thus, assimilation was signifi-
cantly related to pre-therapy PHQ9 scores, but that relationship no longer held by the 8-week
therapy session.

PLOS ONETrauma Cognitions Scale

Discussion

The aim of this research was to develop a measure that assesses cognitions consistent with cog-
nitive processes of assimilation, accommodation, and overaccommodation. The Cognitive
Theory of PTSD [56] asserts PTSD develops and persists in the aftermath of traumatic events
that alter or reinforce negative cognitions about oneself, people, and the world. Cognitive Pro-
cessing Therapy (CPT) [7] follows from this theory, arguing that PTSD symptomatology
endures among individuals who assimilate (e.g., “I should not have gotten drunk that night”)
or over-accommodate (e.g., “All men are evil”) the traumatic event into their core cognitive
schemas about the world. A randomized clinical trial to dismantle the active components of
CPT [57] demonstrated evidence for belief change as a mechanism of treatment success,
highlighting the importance of identifying and eventually accommodating trauma-related cog-
nitions into a schema system that recognizes the world as imperfect, but not wholly malevolent
(e.g., “Sometimes people do bad things”).

Despite evidence that post-trauma cognitions consistent with maladaptive information-
processing play a role in PTSD onset, maintenance, and recovery, post trauma cognition mea-
sures used in research, treatment planning, and symptom monitoring typically reflect cogni-
tions associated with just one cognitive process. Few measures incorporate items reflective of
accommodated cognitions, which are items that would likely be most indicative of treatment-
related success. The present study used two non-clinical samples and one clinical sample to
develop a measure of cognitions consistent with all three cognitive processes, with an unantici-
pated fourth factor reflecting optimism emerging from analyses. Though preliminary, the
measure has potential to impact the trauma field by providing empirical support for cognitive
theories of PTSD, revealing the stability of post-trauma cognitions with and without interven-
tion, and identifying idiosyncratic cognitions that may be targeted by clinicians providing
trauma-focused treatment or cognitions that predict symptom trajectory.

Across the three samples, participants generally disagreed with items on overaccommoda-

tion, scored in the mid-range for assimilation items, and agreed with cognitions associated
with accommodation and optimism. This may be anticipated in regard to Phase 3 results, as
the majority of the participants did not endorse clinical levels of PTSD symptomatology
despite exposure to interpersonal trauma. It is possible the overaccommodated and assimilated
cognitions are more specific to PTSD development than trauma exposure in the absence of
PTSD symptoms. However, the same pattern of results was found in the clinical sample. This
may indicate that clinical samples hold idiosyncratic trauma cognitions that may not reflect
average scores on the subscale. With this in mind, clinicians may use this measure as a tool to
assess which idiosyncratic cognitions are most relevant to that individual and track those spe-
cific cognitions over therapy. Outcome research using the TRCS will shed light on whether the
average scores found in this study replicate in subsequent clinical samples, as well as determine
the clinical utility of the measure.

Contrary to expectations, a fourth factor emerged with items that reflect post-trauma opti-
mism. Although unanticipated, the optimism domain makes theoretical sense, as some indi-
viduals may endorse cognitions about themselves and their recovery that are more purely
positive in nature rather than the more neutral cognitions associated with accommodation or
the more maladaptive cognitions associated with assimilation or over-accommodation.
Though the optimistic cognitions factor emerged across all three subsamples, the extent to
which the optimism factor has utility in research or clinical contexts remains an empirical
question.

Several limitations to the current study must be noted. Phases 2 and 3 used Mechanical
Turk to collect data, which may have increased selection effects [58]. As is common in measure

development, the initial 4-factor CFA model fit to the clinical sample did not fit the data ade-
quately, and thus the CFA model was empirically modified by dropping some items; yet, the
number of factors and the groupings of remaining items within factors were unchanged.
Therefore, the TRCS measurement model within clinical populations should be considered
provisional until tested in subsequent clinical samples with a larger number of participants. In
addition, the present study did not assess for several factors that have been implicated in post-
trauma cognitions and reactions. For example, time elapsed since an index traumatic event
was not assessed. Survivors’ cognitions regarding an event may change naturally over time, or
be altered with formal or informal intervention, the latter of which was also not assessed.
Future research that considers how time elapsed since participants’ index traumatic event, and
previous exposure to intervention, impact cognitions assessed by the TRCS is needed. Further,
in the non-clinical trauma sample in Phase 3 of the present study, the extent to which the
potentially traumatic events assessed by the TLEQ resulted in traumatization (and therefore
were truly traumatic) was not assessed. However, use of a cut-off score to examine the preva-
lence of probable PTSD in interpersonal trauma (IPT) survivors (versus those without such
exposure) revealed nearly 25% of IPT survivors met cut-off for probable PTSD using a conser-
vative cut point. As such, it is reasonable to assume that a sizable minority of the IPT survivors
found their index event to be traumatizing. This limitation was largely rectified in the last
phase, as 91% qualified for a diagnosis of PTSD and all participants were seeking trauma-
focused treatment. However, future studies using the TRCS would benefit from collecting
additional samples of PTSD-positive participants, as well as assessing associations between
subscales of the TRCS and symptoms of other disorders frequently observed in trauma survi-
vors (i.e., depression, anxiety, substance use). Further, additional information regarding par-
ticipants’ trauma history is important to collect to ensure those indicating potential exposure
have experienced an event that would reasonably impact trauma-related cognitions. In addi-
tion, items reflecting more general responses (i.e., “I’m not safe”) should be investigated fur-
ther to determine whether these are trauma-specific or specific to post-trauma mental health
outcomes.

Validity analyses in Phase 4 revealed preliminary evidence of concurrent validity, incre-
mental validity, and predictive validity. Yet, replication is needed to further establish the valid-
ity of the scale. Additionally, it is important to note the internal consistency of the
accommodation scale in Phase 4 was α = .62, which was collected at intake for trauma-focused
treatment. It is likely accommodated beliefs are less consistent, as survivors of trauma may
have idiosyncratic cognitions based on the nature of their trauma. For instance, it may be that
an individual who was assaulted by a stranger holds negative cognitions related to safety, but
may have fewer negative cognitions related to self-blame.

The instructions given on the TRCS may have also impacted study results. The instructions

request that respondents consider the items in relationship to “a traumatic experience” with-
out explicit definition of what a traumatic event entails. Inclusion of a definition of trauma or
reference to a specific type of trauma may better orient participants to a life event that is truly
traumatic. At present, it cannot be determined whether participants across the phases of the
present study were considering a traumatic event that would fall within the DSM-5 criteria for
trauma when responding to TRCS items, or whether they were considering a life event that
fails to achieve this criterion. Further, the instructions request that participants consider the
degree to which items represent their thinking and agreement with the statements. It is possi-
ble for participants to have recurrent cognitions with which they do not agree. As such, future
research that incorporates changes to the TRCS instructions or response scale may improve
the interpretability and utility of findings.

PLOS ONETrauma Cognitions Scale

The aim of the current study was to develop a comprehensive measure of post-trauma cog-

nitions. The resulting scale may have utility in research and clinical contexts; however, the
length of the scale may be a barrier to its use. Future research to identify items with the greatest
utility that maintain scale validity is needed. Further, test-retest reliability was not assessed
in the current study and should be an area for targeted investigation in future research.
Information on the stability of posttraumatic cognitions with and without intervention would
represent an important contribution to the traumatology field. As data from the first three
phases of this study were collected prior to the release of the PCL-5 [51], additional research is
needed to determine whether the scale maintains its association with PTSD symptoms using
DSM-5 criteria in non-clinical samples. The PCL-5 was used in Phase 4 with the clinical
sample.

A strength of this study was demonstration that the four-factor structure of the TRCS was

replicated across different samples, including university students, community participants,
and a treatment-seeking clinical sample. Despite study limitations, a provisional instrument of
cognitions associated with varied post trauma cognitive processes was developed across several
phases using both non-clinical and clinical samples. Incorporation of the TRCS in future sur-
vey research and clinical trials will determine with greater certainty its valid and reliable assess-
ment of the four post trauma cognition factors identified in the current study, and of
particular interest, whether changes in TRCS scores are associated with enhanced treatment-
related outcomes. At the present time, trauma clinicians may consider employing TRCS for
descriptive purposes as part of treatment planning and monitoring.
