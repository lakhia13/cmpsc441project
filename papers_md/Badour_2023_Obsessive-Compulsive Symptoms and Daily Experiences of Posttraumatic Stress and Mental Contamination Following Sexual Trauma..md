Abstract

Although cross-sectional research highlights similarities between symptoms of obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among individuals exposed 
to sexual trauma, little is known about how these disorders relate over time. The goal of the 
present study was to examine whether 1) OCD symptoms prospectively predicted daily symptoms 
of PTSD, and 2) OCD and PTSD symptoms prospectively predicted daily experiences of sexual 
trauma-related mental contamination (i.e., dirtiness in the absence of a physical pollutant). Forty-
one women with a sexual trauma history completed baseline measures of OCD and PTSD, as 
well as twice-daily assessments of PTSD symptoms and mental contamination over a two-week 
period. Total OCD symptoms and the unacceptable thoughts dimension significantly predicted 
daily PTSD symptoms after accounting for other OCD dimensions. Only total OCD symptoms 
significantly predicted daily mental contamination when examined together with total PTSD 
symptoms. No individual PTSD or OCD clusters/dimensions significantly predicted daily mental 
contamination when examined simultaneously. Findings from this study highlight the nuanced 
associations among OCD symptoms, PTSD symptoms, and experiences of mental contamination. 
Future research is needed to further understand the development of PTSD, OCD, and mental 
contamination over time to inform targets for intervention.

Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) commonly report histories of trauma 
(Carpenter & Chung, 2011; Lafleur et al., 2011; Lochner et al., 2002; Park et al., 2014), and 
OCD symptoms appear to be more severe among those with trauma histories (Boudreaux 
et al.,1998; Cromer et al., 2007; Gothelf et al., 2004; Mathews et al., 2008; Semiz et al., 
2014). Case studies suggest that trauma exposure may lead to the onset or worsening of 
OCD symptoms (de Silva & Marks, 1999; Fostick et al., 2012; Speckens et al., 2007). 
There appears to be a particularly strong association between sexual trauma and OCD 
such that sexual trauma is associated with more severe OCD symptoms compared to other 
trauma types (Barzilay et al., 2019; Miller & Brock, 2017; Vidal-Ribas et al., 2015), and 
individuals with OCD report significantly more experiences of childhood sexual abuse 
than non-psychiatric controls (Caspi et al., 2008) and individuals without an anxiety or 
related disorder (Grisham et al., 2011). Furthermore, individuals with childhood sexual 
abuse histories are nearly seven times more likely to have an OCD diagnosis compared to 
those without a history of childhood sexual abuse (Saunders et al., 1992).

There is a high co-occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and OCD among 
individuals with a history of trauma (Pinciotti, Fontenelle et al., 2022), with studies 
reporting that as many as 40–60% of individuals with OCD met criteria for co-occurring 
PTSD (Franklin & Raines, 2019; Gershuny et al., 2008). A growing number of studies 
have documented worse symptoms treatment outcomes among individuals with comorbid 
PTSD and OCD relative to individuals experiencing OCD alone. Indeed, individuals with 
co-occurring PTSD and OCD have been shown to report more severe OCD symptoms, less 
symptom improvement over time and in response to treatment, poorer insight, worse quality 
of life, and more psychiatric and substance use comorbidity compared to individuals with 
OCD alone (Gershuny et al., 2002; Gershuny et al., 2003; Ojserkis et al., 2017; Pinciotti et 
al., 2020; Semiz et al., 2014; Van Kirk et al., 2018). and Despite compelling evidence of the 
overlap and co-occurrence between PTSD and OCD in trauma-exposed samples, relatively 
little is known about how symptoms of these two disorders may be functionally linked 
with one another in day-to-day life, as previous research on co-occurring PTSD and OCD 
symptoms has been largely restricted to clinical case studies and cross-sectional designs 
(e.g., de Silva & Marks, 1999; Franklin & Raines, 2019; Gershuny et al., 2003, 2008; 
McKay et al., 2016). Survivors of sexual trauma are especially likely to experience OCD 
and PTSD symptoms in comparison to survivors of other forms of traumatic events (Breslau 
et al., 1991; Kessler et al., 1995; Miller & Brock, 2017). Accordingly, prospective work 
examining associations between OCD and PTSD symptoms among individuals with sexual 
trauma histories is warranted to better understand temporal dynamics of OCD and PTSD 
symptoms among this high-risk group. Such research will help inform understanding of 
processes underlying symptom development, maintenance, and/or exacerbation in ways that 
may inform improved approaches to assessment and treatment of this clinically challenging 
comorbidity.

Previous work has highlighted striking similarities between core symptoms of PTSD and 
OCD (Fostick et al., 2012; Gershuny et al., 2003; Pinciotti, Horvath et al., 2022). For 
example, both disorders are characterized by repeated, intrusive, and distressing images or 
cognitions and significant attempts to avoid or escape anxiety-provoking stimuli. Although 
many avoidance and escape behaviors emphasized in the PTSD literature are non-ritualized 
and non-repetitive in nature, compulsive behaviors have also been noted in individuals with 
PTSD. For example, repeated and ritualistic checking of locks and windows, patrolling 
of the perimeter, and checking under vehicles for bombs have been documented among 
veterans with combat-related PTSD (Tuerk et al., 2009). Similar trauma-specific checking 
compulsions have been reported by individuals with PTSD secondary to accidents and 
traumatic events involving sexual or physical victimization (de Silva & Marks, 2001; 
Gershuny et al., 2003).

Contamination-related obsessions and compulsive washing behaviors, two of the most 
common symptoms of OCD, have been frequently reported following sexual trauma 
(Fairbrother & Rachman, 2004) and other traumatic events (de Silva & Marks, 2001), 
including among individuals with PTSD (Badour et al., 2013). Following experiences 
of sexual trauma, persistent contamination concerns and washing behaviors may reflect 
experiences of mental contamination (i.e., a pervasive sense of dirtiness experienced without 
contact with a contaminant; Rachman, 1994, 2004). Contact contamination is typically 
triggered by contact with identifiable pollutants. Conversely, mental contamination is 
typically prompted by internal experiences such as imagery, thoughts, memories, emotions, 
and physical sensations. Among individuals with a history of sexual trauma, experiences of 
mental contamination are often brought on by feelings or thoughts about perceived violation 
associated with sexual trauma or memories of contact with physical contaminants (e.g., 
bodily fluids) during the traumatic event (Fairbrother & Rachman, 2004; Rachman, 1994, 
2004).

Research has documented positive associations between severity of mental contamination 
and both OCD (Coughtrey et al., 2012; Melli et al., 2014, 2017; Ojserkis et al., 2018) 
and PTSD symptoms (Badour et al., 2013; Brake et al., 2018; Ojserkis et al., 2018; 
Olatunji et al., 2008). Individuals experiencing greater levels of both PTSD and OCD 
symptoms may experience sexual trauma-related mental contamination more frequently and 
intensely than individuals experiencing PTSD or OCD symptoms alone. Although PTSD 
and OCD symptoms have been broadly linked to mental contamination in cross-sectional 
work (e.g., Badour et al., 2013; Coughtrey et al., 2012; Fairbrother & Rachman, 2004), 
some PTSD and OCD symptom domains may be more associated with experiences of 
mental contamination than others. Cross-sectional research has shown that sexual trauma-
related mental contamination positively correlates with each of the symptom clusters of 
PTSD as defined by the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental 
Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), with the most robust associations 
between mental contamination and intrusions, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, 
and alterations in arousal and reactivity symptoms (Brake et al., 2019; Fergus & Bardeen, 
2016). Theory and experimental evidence suggest that trauma-related memories or images 
such as those experienced as part of PTSD-intrusions can be a potent trigger for sexual 
trauma-related mental contamination (Badour et al., 2013; Fairbrother & Rachman, 2004;

Fergus & Bardeen, 2016). Several aspects of the negative alterations in cognitions and mood 
symptom cluster of PTSD are likely to be relevant to mental contamination including strong 
negative emotions such as shame and disgust (Badour et al., 2013, 2014; Steil et al., 2011) 
and negative trauma-related cognitions (e.g., beliefs about the self, about responsibility for 
the sexual trauma experience; Olajunji et al., 2008). Fergus & Bardeen (2016) suggest 
associations between PTSD-related negative alterations in mood and cognition and mental 
contamination are likely to be particularly robust among individuals who have difficulty 
tolerating negative emotion states. Hypervigilance within the PTSD-alterations in arousal 
and reactivity cluster may be important to understanding persistent sexual trauma-related 
mental contamination. Indeed, once contamination fears have been established—in this case 
sexual trauma-related mental contamination—people may become hypervigilant for possible 
threat of future contamination, including both external and internal cues that one’s body or 
sense of self has been contaminated or polluted (Rachman, 2004; Fergus & Bardeen, 2016). 
Moreover, trauma-related mental contamination has been linked to increased risk behavior 
among individuals with elevated PTSD symptoms (Brake et al., 2018).

In the context of OCD, most studies have focused on relations between contact 
contamination and mental contamination, demonstrating that these symptom dimensions 
are related but distinct constructs (Mathes et al., 2019; Melli et al., 2014, 2017). Recent 
evidence suggests that the presence of mental contamination may interfere with effective 
exposure-based treatment for contact contamination symptoms (Mathes et al., 2019). 
Although significant positive correlations between mental contamination and other OCD 
symptom dimensions have been documented (Coughtrey et al., 2012), considerably less 
work has focused on understanding the relations between mental contamination and 
OCD symptom dimensions outside of contact contamination. Following sexual trauma 
in particular, responsibility obsessions and associated compulsive checking may lead 
individuals feel responsible for the occurrence of the trauma or for preventing a similar 
situation from occurring again in the future. Such beliefs may result in increased 
hypervigilance in the context of PTSD symptoms but may also lead to self-blame and 
associated guilt related to the causes of the sexual trauma. Consistent with the non-adaptive 
guilt and shame model (NAGS; Norman, 2014), feelings of guilt may generalize over 
time into to feelings of shame and self-disgust—two emotions that have been consistently 
linked to sexual trauma-related mental contamination (Jones & Badour, in press; Steil et 
al., 2011). Moreover, obsessions over unacceptable thoughts including sexual and religious 
obsessions may be likely to lead to increased mental contamination following sexual trauma, 
particularly if intrusive thoughts surrounding the sexual trauma experience, or the fact that 
the sexual trauma occurred at all, is perceived by the survivor to indicate that they are sinful 
or immoral (Abramowitz & Hellberg, 2020; Barker & Galliger, 2020, Chen et al., 2013).

To address gaps in the literature on co-occurring OCD and PTSD symptoms and their 
associations with mental contamination, the current study examined relations among OCD 
symptoms, PTSD symptoms, and mental contamination in a community sample of women 
with sexual trauma histories and elevated sexual trauma-related mental contamination. 
First, this study examined whether the severity of baseline OCD symptoms (total 
and dimensions of contamination, responsibility/checking, unacceptable thoughts, and 
symmetry) prospectively predicted daily symptoms of PTSD. We hypothesized that total

OCD severity and the OCD symptom dimensions of contamination, responsibility/checking, 
and unacceptable thoughts would demonstrate the strongest prospective associations with 
daily PTSD symptoms, given similarities between these OCD symptom dimensions and 
concerns documented among individuals with PTSD (Franklin & Raines, 2019). Second, 
this study evaluated unique variance explained by baseline OCD and PTSD symptoms (total 
and individual symptom dimensions or clusters) in predicting daily experiences of mental 
contamination. We hypothesized that PTSD-intrusions, -alterations in negative cognitions 
and mood, and -alterations in arousal and reactivity as well as OCD-contamination, 
-responsibility and -unacceptable thoughts domains would be the strongest prospective 
predictors of sexual trauma-related mental contamination.

Method

Participants

Participants included 41 community-recruited adult cisgender women (Mage = 32.95, 
SD = 12.59) with a history of sexual trauma and current sexual trauma-related mental 
contamination who participated in a larger study focused on understanding sexual trauma-
related mental contamination (Brake et al., 2021). Past month sexual trauma-related mental 
contamination was based on a score ≥ 10 on the Posttraumatic Experience of Mental 
Contamination scale (PEMC; Brake et al., 2019) and confirmation of ongoing sexual 
trauma-related mental contamination during a clinical interview. A majority (73.2%, n = 
30) of participants reported a history of two or more instances of sexual trauma, and the 
average age at which participants reported first experiencing a sexually traumatic event was 
12.24 years (SD = 6.13). Participants endorsed the following non-exclusive types of sexual 
trauma: sexual contact before the age of 13 (56.1%), unwanted sexual contact due to use 
of force or threatened use of force (90.2%), and unwanted sexual contact while under the 
influence of substances and therefore unable to provide consent (58.5%).

Participants identified as Caucasian (73.2%), Black or African American (19.5%), 
multiracial (4.9%), or belonging to another racial group (2.4%). Additionally, 9.8% of 
participants identified as ethnically Hispanic. Participants identified as heterosexual/straight 
(70.7%), bisexual (22.0%), lesbian/gay (4.9%), and being best described by another sexual 
orientation (2.4%). Most participants reported having completed at least some college 
(92.7%) and employment statuses were as follows: student (36.6%), employed full-time 
(24.4%), employed part-time (22.0%), unemployed and seeking employment (9.8%), or 
unemployed and not seeking employment (7.3%). The most endorsed participant income 
was < $20,000 (46.3%) and incomes ranged from < $20,000 to > $100,000. Participants 
were excluded based on an inability to provide written, informed consent; current risk 
of suicide with intent; or reporting no mental contamination symptoms during in-person 
interviews despite initially endorsing mental contamination during initial screening.

Procedure

All procedures were approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). 
Participants were recruited from the community using online listings, flyers, and brochures. 
Following an initial phone screen to determine eligibility, participants completed an online

questionnaire battery followed by an in-person visit. During the in-person visit, participants 
completed a diagnostic interview to assess current PTSD symptoms and a clinical interview 
to confirm the presence of ongoing sexual trauma-related mental contamination. Participants 
were then provided with instructions for completing the daily diary assessment portion of 
the study.

Beginning on the day after the in-person visit, participants completed 14 days of twice-daily 
diary assessments evaluating PTSD symptoms and mental contamination via the LifeData 
mobile application. During this period, participants received push notifications twice daily 
at 9:00AM EST and 5:00PM EST to complete their morning and evening assessments, 
respectively. Assessments could be completed at any point within a four-hour window, and 
participants were reminded to complete their daily assessments every 30 minutes. Study 
staff contacted participants to encourage improved adherence or troubleshoot technical 
difficulties if participants failed to complete morning and evening assessments on at least 
50% of the days during their first week or if they missed four consecutive assessment 
prompts at any time during the daily diary period. Participants were compensated $30 
at the end of their in-person visit and were provided with referral information and 
mental health resources. Participants then received $1 for each of the 28 possible daily 
diary assessments that were completed, plus $5 bonuses for each completed set of four 
consecutive assessments.

Measures

Baseline Measures

Sexual Trauma History.: Participants’ history of sexual trauma was assessed during the 
screening phase of the study using three items from the National Stressful Events Survey 
(NSES; Kilpatrick et al., 2011). These items assessed penetration and/or touching of sexual 
parts across three categories: (1) childhood sexual contact, (2) unwanted sexual contact 
under force or threat of force, and (3) unwanted sexual contact while under the influence of 
alcohol or drugs.1

Sexual Trauma-Related Mental Contamination.: Sexual trauma-related mental 
contamination was evaluated during the screening phase via the Posttraumatic Experience of 
Mental Contamination scale (PEMC; Brake et al., 2019). The PEMC is a 20-item modified 
version of the Vancouver Obsessional Compulsive Inventory-Mental Contamination scale 
(VOCI-MC; Radomsky et al., 2014) that specifically assesses experiences of mental 
contamination occurring since a traumatic event. For the purposes of this study, participants 
were instructed to respond to PEMC items in relation to their most distressing event 
involving sexual trauma. For each item, participants rated the extent to which the described 
experience was true for them using a five-point Likert-type scale (0 = “Not at all” to 4 = 
“Very much”). Item scores were summed to create an overall index for sexual trauma-related 
mental contamination, with higher total scores denoting greater sexual trauma-related mental 
contamination. Use of a cutoff score of ≥ 10 on the PEMC for inclusion in the study was 

1The NSES also includes an item inquiring about any history of penetrative assault and all but 5 endorsed this item. Given the high 
prevalence of penetrative assault in the sample, we did not examine this variable in any of the models.

informed by research using a cut score of 10 on the VOCI-MC to denote moderate mental 
contamination severity (Coughtrey et al., 2014a; Coughtrey et al., 2014b). The PEMC 
exhibits strong internal consistency (α = .92 in the current study) and strong convergent 
validity with ratings on the VOCI-MC (Brake et al., 2019). Scores on the PEMC have 
also demonstrated incremental utility over the VOCI-MC in predicting PTSD and OCD 
symptoms in community samples (Brake et al., 2019). Trauma-related mental contamination 
was determined to be current via in-person clinical interview using two items from a sexual 
assault-related mental contamination interview used in a previous study (“What, if anything, 
brings back that feeling of dirtiness now?” and “What about memories of the unwanted 
sexual experience, do they bring back that feeling of dirtiness?”; Rachman, 2004).

PTSD Severity and Diagnosis.: Past-month PTSD symptoms and diagnostic status were 
assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5; Weathers 
et al., 2013) at baseline. The CAPS-5 is a well-established, semi-structured diagnostic 
interview for PTSD that provides an index of past-month total symptom severity and 
severity for four cluster scores: intrusions, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and 
mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. Diagnostic status was determined based on 
symptom counts within each criterion and associated distress or interference (Weathers et 
al., 2018). Scores on the CAPS-5 exhibit good convergence with past-month self-reported 
PTSD symptoms, good discriminant validity when compared to measures of other forms of 
pathology and distress (Weathers et al., 2018), and good internal consistency (α = .84 in the 
current study). A trained graduate student conducted all CAPS-5 interviews and analysis of 
a random selection of 20% of interviews indicated excellent interrater reliability (diagnostic 
agreement, κ = 1.0; agreement on total symptom severity, average r = .98).

OCD Severity and Clinical Cutoff.: A modified version of the Dimensional Obsessive-
Compulsive Scale (DOCS; Abramowitz et al., 2010) was used to establish OCD symptom 
severity and determine when participants were above the recommended clinical cutoff. 
The DOCS is a 20-item self-report questionnaire indexing primary dimensions of OCD 
symptoms: contamination, responsibility/checking, unacceptable thoughts, and symmetry. 
Respondents rated 1) time spent engaging in obsessions and/or compulsions, 2) avoidance, 
3) distress, 4) disruptions in functioning, and 5) difficulty suppressing obsessions and/or 
compulsions during the past month using a five-point Likert-type scale (0 = “None at all” 
to 4 = “8 hours or more each day” or 0 = “None at all/Not at all” to 4 = “Extreme” in 
line with item content). Two additional items were added to each symptom dimensions 
to assess whether the described experiences began or worsened following participants’ 
worst unwanted sexual experience (responses included: “Did not change after unwanted 
sexual experience,” “First began after unwanted sexual experience,” or “Got worse after 
unwanted sexual experience”) and to evaluate descriptively how long participants had been 
experiencing symptoms within each dimension. Responses on these items were not score 
Total scores for OCD symptom severity and four symptom dimension scores were computed 
by summing relevant items, with higher scores denoting more severe symptoms. Participants 
were above the clinical cutoff for OCD symptoms if they scored 21 or higher on the DOCS 
based on evidence suggesting optimal sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing individuals 
with OCD from those with other anxiety disorders (Abramowitz et al., 2010). The DOCS

has demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity (Abramowitz et al., 2010) and 
internal consistency was excellent in the present sample (α = 0.94).

Daily Measures

Sexual Trauma-Related Mental Contamination.: Experiences of mental contamination 
were assessed twice daily using an adapted version of the 15-item self-report State Mental 
Contamination Scale (SMCS; Lorona et al., 2018). For each item on the SMCS, participants 
were asked to rate the extent to which they had been bothered by the described experience 
since the previous assessment using a five-point Likert-type scale (0 = “Strongly disagree” 
to 4 = “Strongly agree”). Instructions were modified to ask participants to evaluate mental 
contamination concerns that were related to their worst sexually traumatic experience. 
Previous research has successfully utilized the SMCS to obtain daily severity ratings for 
mental contamination, supporting its use in assessing mental contamination as part of 
daily diary assessments (Lorona et al., 2018). Preliminary work utilizing the SMCS has 
documented strong convergent validity via associations with behavioral outcomes linked to 
mental contamination (e.g., washing behavior; Lorona et al., 2018). The SMCS exhibited 
strong reliability in evaluating both between-person differences (Rkf = .99) and within-
person change (RC = .95) across the fourteen-day diary period in the present study (Cranford 
et al., 2006).

PTSD Symptoms.: Severity of PTSD symptoms was evaluated twice daily using a modified 
version of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013). The PCL-5 is a 
20-item self-report questionnaire that assesses frequency and intensity of PTSD symptoms 
during the past month. Instructions for the PCL-5 were modified to ask participants to 
rate their symptoms since the previous daily diary assessment and in relation to their most 
distressing sexual traumatic experience. These modifications are in line with prior use of 
the PCL-5 to measure daily PTSD symptoms (Dworkin et al., 2018). For items on the 
PCL-5, participants indicated how much each experience or symptom had affected them 
using a five-point Likert-type scale (0 = “Not at all” to 4 = “Extremely”). Total PTSD 
symptom severity was calculated for each assessment by summing item scores. The PCL-5 
exhibited excellent reliability in evaluating both between-person differences (Rkf = .99) and 
within-person change (RC = .92) in the present study.

Data Analytic Plan

First, prevalence of past-month PTSD and scoring above the clinical cutoff for past-month 
OCD symptoms were examined, and severity of baseline sexual trauma-related mental 
contamination was compared between those in the PTSD/high OCD symptoms versus no 
diagnosis group via independent samples t-tests. Comparisons were not made with the PTSD 
only and high OCD symptoms only groups given the low numbers of participants in each of 
these groups. Among participants in the PTSD/high OCD symptoms group, the proportion 
of individuals reporting that their OCD symptoms first began or got worse after an unwanted 
sexual experience was next examined. A series of zero-order bivariate correlations were then 
examined among baseline study variables.

Primary analyses included two series of hierarchical mixed linear regression models using 
restricted maximum likelihood estimation. The first series (Model 1a-1e) predicted daily 
measures of PTSD symptom severity. Baseline PTSD symptom severity and time (hours 
elapsed between opening of assessment windows centered at the midpoint coded as −160 
to 160) were included as covariates in Step 1 of each of these models. Model 1a examined 
the fixed effect of baseline total OCD symptoms (Step 2). Models 1b-1e entered each 
individual OCD symptom dimension as an individual predictor in Step 2, and the alternate 
OCD symptom dimensions were added as predictors in Step 3, to determine whether each 
symptom dimension prospectively predicted daily PTSD symptoms when examined alone 
(Step 2), and when accounting for overlap among OCD symptom dimensions (Step 3).

The second series of models (Models 2a-2j) predicted daily measures of mental 
contamination. Baseline sexual trauma-related mental contamination and time were included 
as covariates in Step 1 of these models. Model 2a examined the fixed effect of total baseline 
PTSD symptoms in Step 2, and whether that effect remained significant when accounting 
for the overlap with total baseline OCD symptoms (Step 3). Model 2b, examined the same 
model in reverse, with total baseline OCD symptoms as the focal predictor added in Step 2, 
and the effect examined while adjusting for the overlap with total baseline PTSD symptoms 
in Step 3. In models 2c-2j, each individual PTSD symptom cluster and OCD symptom 
dimension were alternatively added in Step 2, with the remaining symptoms adjusted for in 
Step 3.

Data analyses were conducted using SPSS 28 (IBM Corp, 2021). All primary models 
included the random intercept and slope of time using restricted maximum likelihood 
estimation (REML) with an unstructured covariance matrix. Prior to entry as a fixed and 
random predictor, time was re-centered at the mid-point of the daily assessments with 
spacing to account for the variable intervals between the morning and evening assessments. 
All continuous predictors were grand-mean centered to aid in interpretation of model 
intercepts and regression coefficients. Model comparisons were conducted for nested models 
using a series of −2 log-likelihood comparisons via chi-squared difference tests. Critical 
p-values were calculated for each of the primary models to control for the false discovery 
rate expected with multiple tests (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995). These critical p-values 
were used for all analyses.

Results

Descriptive Statistics

Most participants in the sample (63.4%; n = 26) met criteria for past-month diagnosis of 
PTSD and were above the clinical cutoff for OCD symptoms. An additional 9.8% met 
criteria for PTSD only (n = 2) or were above the clinical cutoff for OCD symptoms only (n 
= 2). The remaining 28.8% of participants (n = 11) did not meet criteria for either group. 
Participants in the combined PTSD/OCD group displayed higher sexual trauma-related 
mental contamination at baseline on the PEMC [M = 54.32 (SD = 12.83)] compared to 
participants in the no diagnosis group [M = 40.55 (SD = 16.29); t = −2.90, p = .01]. Most 
participants in the combined PTSD/OCD group reported that each domain of their OCD 
symptoms either started or got worse after an unwanted sexual experience (see Table 1).

Table 2 displays zero-order correlations among baseline study variables. Baseline sexual 
trauma-related mental contamination on the PEMC was positively correlated with total OCD 
symptom severity and all OCD symptom dimensions, as well as total PTSD symptom 
severity and all PTSD symptom clusters except for negative alterations in cognitions 
and mood. Total PTSD symptom severity at baseline was also positively correlated with 
total OCD symptom severity and all OCD symptom dimensions. Intrusion symptoms 
of PTSD were not significantly correlated with PTSD negative cognitions and mood or 
OCD symmetry or contamination symptoms. Avoidance symptoms of PTSD were not 
significantly correlated with OCD symmetry symptoms. Negative alterations in cognitions 
and mood symptoms in PTSD were not significantly correlated with OCD contamination 
symptoms. All other PTSD symptom clusters and individual OCD symptom dimensions 
were positively correlated.

Primary Analyses

Participants completed a total of 974 out of 1,148 possible daily diary surveys, resulting 
in an 84.8% response rate for the sample overall. The mean number of responses per 
participant was 23.76 (SD = 5.24, range: 7–28), with over 90% of participants completing 
15 or more of the 28 daily diaries. Unconditional mixed linear regression models including 
the fixed and random intercept and slope of time demonstrated that neither daily PTSD 
symptom severity (B = −.01, SE = .01, t = −0.70, p = .49) nor daily sexual trauma-related 
mental contamination severity (B = −.002, SE = .005, t = −.039, p = .70) exhibited linear 
change over the course of the two-week daily diary period.

Daily PTSD Symptoms—In the first series of hierarchical mixed linear regression 
models (Table 3), total OCD symptom severity (Model 1a) and individual OCD symptom 
dimensions involving contamination (Model 1b) and unacceptable thoughts (Model 1d) 
significantly predicted daily PTSD symptoms after accounting for baseline PTSD symptom 
severity and time. However, OCD-contamination symptoms no longer remained significant 
after accounting for overlap with other OCD symptom dimensions.

Daily Mental Contamination—Table 4 presents the second series of hierarchical mixed 
linear regression models. After accounting for baseline mental contamination and time, 
total baseline PTSD symptoms and total baseline OCD symptoms each prospectively 
and positively predicted daily sexual trauma-related mental contamination when examined 
individually (Models 2a-2b). However, only baseline total OCD symptom severity remained 
a significant predictor of daily sexual trauma-related mental contamination when both 
total baseline PTSD and OCD symptoms were added to the model simultaneously. In the 
models with individual PTSD symptom clusters and OCD symptom dimensions included 
as predictors (Models 2c-2j), PTSD intrusions and alterations in arousal and reactivity, 
and all four of the OCD dimension scores were significant prospective predictors of daily 
mental contamination symptoms when entered individually. However, none of the individual 
clusters/dimensions remained significant when entered simultaneously.

Discussion

Page 11

The present study sought to examine relations among PTSD symptoms, OCD symptoms, 
and sexual trauma-related mental contamination in a community sample of cisgender 
women with a history of sexual trauma and current trauma-related mental contamination.

PTSD/OCD Symptom Comorbidity

Consistent with prior research demonstrating high rates of OCD and PTSD comorbidity 
among traumatized individuals (Brown et al., 2001; Franklin & Raines, 2019; Gershuny et 
al., 2008; Nacasch et al., 2011), 63.4% of participants in the current sample met criteria 
for current PTSD and scored above the clinical cutoff for OCD symptoms. Notably, 
most participants with comorbid PTSD who were above the clinical cutoff for OCD 
symptoms reported that their OCD symptoms either started or worsened following an 
unwanted sexual experience. Trauma-related onset or exacerbation was reported for each 
OCD symptom dimension, highlighting the importance of focusing on sexual trauma as a 
potential precipitating or exacerbating factor in the onset or worsening of OCD. Consistent 
with previous findings (e.g., Franklin & Raines, 2019), symptoms of PTSD and all 
OCD symptom dimensions were positively correlated when examined cross-sectionally at 
baseline. For total PTSD symptom severity, the most robust correlations with OCD symptom 
dimensions were observed with responsibility/checking and unacceptable thoughts, which 
was in line with hypotheses. It was somewhat surprising that the strength of correlation 
between total PTSD symptom severity and OCD contamination symptoms was more 
moderate, in line with the strength of of association with the OCD symmetry dimension.

The particularly high rate of individuals meeting criteria for PTSD and scoring above the 
clinical cutoff for OCD symptoms in this study is consistent with high rates of PTSD/OCD 
comorbidity documented by Franklin and Raines (2019) among a sample of veterans 
receiving routine care in a Veteran’s Administration hospital. These authors found that 
participants frequently endorsed questions with similar content across self-report measures 
of PTSD and OCD, and they suggested that participants may have difficulty distinguishing 
between overlapping symptoms of PTSD and OCD using self-report measures. Although 
baseline PTSD symptoms were assessed via a clinical interview in the present study, 
baseline OCD symptoms and were measured with self-report. Participants may, therefore, 
have had difficulty distinguishing between overlapping symptoms of PTSD and OCD 
when completing self-report measures. Moreover, higher order symptoms that underlie both 
PTSD and OCD, such as neuroticism or anxiety, may have also influenced high rates of 
comorbidity and reported associations between PTSD and OCD symptoms in the present 
sample. It is true; however, that there may be a dynamic comorbidity between PTSD and 
OCD such that individual symptoms map on to both disorders simultaneously, but in unique 
ways (e.g., hypervigilance-driven checking of locks to prevent a break-in that is conducted 
in a ritualistic way typically seen in the context of OCD (Rachman, 1991). Self-report 
measures do not allow for this level of nuance in terms of understanding the nature of how 
individual symptoms may map on functionally to one or both disorders. Finally, the high rate 
of co-occurrence between OCD and PTSD symptoms observed in the present sample may 
have been influenced by inclusion criteria, which required participants to report ongoing

experiences of sexual trauma-related mental contamination. This could have increased the 
likelihood of elevated OCD and PTSD symptoms in the current sample.

Future research should examine rates of comorbid PTSD and OCD using clinician-
administered interviews among individuals with varying levels of sexual trauma-related 
mental contamination while accounting for higher order symptoms and commonly comorbid 
symptoms (e.g., depression). Such an investigation may also provide further clarification 
regarding the role that sexual trauma-related mental contamination has in individuals with 
dual diagnoses of OCD and PTSD and whether the severity of sexual trauma-related mental 
contamination increases the likelihood of having both disorders. Conversely, it may be that 
sexual trauma-related mental contamination and PTSD symptom elevations are both more 
likely to occur among individuals with OCD or OCD-related vulnerabilities.

Daily PTSD Symptoms

A novel contribution of the present study was the extension beyond cross-sectional 
correlations to demonstrate that, in line with hypotheses, total OCD symptom severity and 
OCD unacceptable thoughts also prospectively predicted higher daily symptoms of PTSD. 
Also consistent with hypotheses, contamination-based symptoms of OCD prospectively 
predicted PTSD symptoms, though this predictor was no longer significant after adjusting 
for the overlap among OCD symptom dimensions. Counter to hypotheses, OCD 
responsibility/checking symptoms did not prospectively predict daily PTSD symptoms.

It was not surprising that total OCD symptoms and the unacceptable thoughts symptom 
dimension of OCD symptoms predicted PTSD symptom severity both cross-sectionally and 
prospectively. These associations may reflect the fact that several key symptoms are shared 
between OCD and PTSD (e.g., intrusive thoughts, avoidance). The unacceptable thoughts 
scale of the DOCS provides examples that may represent specific content overlap with 
PTSD-related intrusions (e.g., “unpleasant thoughts about sex, immorality, or violence that 
come to mind against your will”) and avoidance (e.g., “avoidance of certain people, places, 
situations or other triggers of unwanted or unpleasant thoughts”) in addition to thoughts 
and behaviors likely to be more distinct to OCD symptoms (e.g., “thoughts about doing 
awful, improper or embarrassing things you don’t really want to do,” “repeating an action 
or following a special routine because of a bad thought,” “mentally performing an action or 
saying prayers to get rid of an unwanted or unpleasant thought”). The robust associations 
between unacceptable thoughts and baseline and daily PTSD symptoms may reflect, in part, 
this content overlap. It is possible that trauma-related intrusions and avoidance influenced 
scores on the unacceptable thoughts dimension of the DOCS. Notably, while Pinciotti, 
Horvarth, and colleagues (2022) found that OCD obsessions and compulsions remained 
distinct symptom clusters from PTSD intrusions and avoidance when examining the factor 
structure of scores from the PCL-5 and another self-report measure of OCD symptoms 
(the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale-Self-Report; Steketee et al., 1996), the factor 
structure of the DOCS and PCL-5 subscales has yet to be examined.

Future research should seek to further evaluate the nature of intrusive thoughts and 
associated avoidance in PTSD and OCD to determine whether there are characteristics 
of intrusions that better discriminate between the two disorders, such as trauma-specific

content or morally relevant components. This could be more effectively accomplished with 
specialized clinician interviews that seek to parse obsessive and posttraumatic intrusions 
within a given individual (e.g., OCD Trauma Timeline Interview; Wadsworth et al., 2021). 
It will also be important to learn whether intrusive thoughts are focused on the future 
or the past in individuals with comorbid PTSD and OCD, as well as whether intrusive 
thoughts lead to more safety behaviors or avoidance. A deeper understanding of intrusive 
thoughts among individuals with comorbid OCD and PTSD, what they do when confronted 
with these thoughts, and whether these thoughts serve a distinct function between disorders 
would provide needed clarity to the present findings.

Though contamination-based OCD symptoms also prospectively predicted daily symptoms 
of PTSD when examined alone, this OCD symptom dimension was no longer significant 
when controlling for other OCD symptoms. This finding suggests that the predictive power 
of OCD-contamination symptoms in this context may be better explained by is shared 
variance with other OCD symptoms. However, it is notable that over half of participants 
with PTSD and who were above the clinical cutoff for OCD symptoms reporting that 
their contamination-based OCD symptoms first began after the sexual trauma. It is possible 
that the association between OCD-contamination symptoms and PTSD symptoms were 
less robust in this context because the DOCS-contamination subscale is not specific either 
to sexual trauma or to mental contamination. Indeed, for the more than a quarter of 
participants who indicated their contamination symptoms began before their sexual trauma, 
it may be that their contamination symptoms are not functionally linked to symptoms of 
PTSD. Further research is needed to understand the temporal dynamics and heterogeneity 
of contamination and other OCD symptom dimensions before and following exposure to 
trauma.

Given robust cross-sectional correlations between baseline PTSD symptoms and OCD 
responsibility/checking symptoms, it was somewhat surprising that responsibility/checking 
symptoms did not prospectively predict daily PTSD symptoms. It is possible that 
responsibility/checking symptoms no longer prospectively predict daily PTSD symptoms 
after accounting for overlap in between-person differences in PTSD severity at baseline. 
Heterogeneity among the symptoms within the responsibility/checking dimension may, 
in part, also explain the nonsignificant relation between responsibility/checking OCD 
symptoms and daily PTSD symptoms. It is possible that some responsibility-related 
symptoms in OCD (e.g., self-blame and checking behaviors) are more related to PTSD 
symptoms than others (e.g., the need to count to or avoid certain numbers). Item-level 
analyses would be needed to explore this possibility, which is not possible with the standard 
DOCS.

Daily Mental Contamination

Findings with regard to sexual trauma-related mental contamination were partially in 
line with hypotheses. Positive correlations were found at baseline with total PTSD and 
OCD symptom severity. Similarly, positive correlations were found between baseline 
sexual trauma-related mental contamination and all individual symptom clusters/dimensions 
except for PTSD negative alterations in cognitions and mood. Total OCD and PTSD

symptom severity at baseline each prospectively predicted daily sexual trauma-related 
mental contamination; however, when considering the overlap between total PTSD and OCD 
symptom severity, only total OCD symptom severity remained a prospective predictor of 
daily sexual trauma-related mental contamination. Intrusion and alterations in arousal and 
reactivity symptoms of PTSD and all OCD symptom dimensions prospectively predicted 
daily sexual trauma-related mental contamination, but none of these individual clusters/
dimensions remained a significant prospective predictor of daily sexual trauma-mental 
contamination when accounting for overlap among individual symptom clusters/dimensions.

The finding that both baseline total PTSD symptoms and total OCD symptoms prospectively 
predicted daily experiences of sexual trauma-related mental contamination provides further 
evidence of the role of PTSD and OCD symptoms in the maintenance of sexual trauma-
related mental contamination. Contrary to previous findings (Badour et al., 2013), however, 
only baseline OCD symptoms significantly predicted daily sexual trauma-related mental 
contamination when PTSD and OCD baseline scores were entered simultaneously. These 
results do not provide support for the unique role of PTSD symptoms in predicting daily 
mental contamination above and beyond OCD symptoms. While PTSD is related to sexual 
trauma-related mental contamination, it is possible that a significant proportion of the 
variance explained by PTSD is due to co-occurring OCD symptoms.

When examined separately, all OCD dimensions prospectively predicted daily sexual 
trauma-related mental contamination, suggesting that the relation between OCD symptoms 
and sexual trauma-related mental contamination is not unique to specific OCD subtypes. 
Although the most robust OCD dimension predictors of sexual trauma-related mental 
contamination were unacceptable thoughts and contamination-related symptoms, no specific 
symptom domain remained significant when accounting for overlap among symptom 
dimensions. Given the robust overlap between PTSD symptoms and unacceptable thoughts, 
it will be important for future studies to consider whether obsessions regarding unacceptable 
thoughts in OCD still predict trauma-related mental contamination after considering the 
overlap with PTSD symptoms.

Regarding baseline PTSD symptoms, only PTSD intrusions and alterations in arousal and 
reactivity prospectively predicted daily sexual trauma-related mental contamination. PTSD-
related intrusions, as assessed by the CAPS-5, include unwanted memories, flashbacks, and 
physical reactions to reminders of the traumatic event. These symptoms may constitute the 
images, thoughts, or memories that trigger sexual trauma-related mental contamination, such 
that experiencing greater intrusions leads to increased trauma-related mental contamination. 
The CAPS-5 domain of alterations in arousal and reactivity encompasses a variety of 
symptoms, including irritability, externalizing and/or risky behaviors, hypervigilance, and 
difficulties with sleep and concentration. While it is unclear which of these symptoms 
are driving the association between PTSD-related alterations in arousal and reactivity and 
sexual trauma-related mental contamination, previous research has highlighted associations 
among externalizing behaviors, hypervigilance, and mental contamination (Brake et al., 
2019) and between mental contamination and engagement in risk behavior (Brake et al., 
2018). Additionally, it has been speculated that contamination fears can result in increased 
hypervigilance to subsequent contamination (Rachman et al., 2015). This preoccupation

with the threat of future contamination may lead to increased attention to internal sensations 
and emotions that may perpetuate continued feelings of mental contamination.

Contrary to hypotheses, baseline PTSD-related negative alterations in cognitions and 
mood was not a significant predictor of daily sexual trauma-related mental contamination. 
Negative alterations in cognitions and mood encompasses many symptoms, including 
interruptions in memory of the traumatic event; negative beliefs; self-blame; anhedonia; 
and a wide range of emotions including fear, anger, shame, and guilt. Some of these 
symptoms are likely more closely related to sexual trauma-related mental contamination 
than others (e.g., Cougle et al., 2008; Fergus & Bardeen, 2016). Thus, the heterogeneity 
of these symptoms may explain why PTSD-related negative alterations in cognitions and 
mood did not significantly predict daily sexual trauma-related mental contamination. Further 
item-level analyses are needed to explore this possibility.

No baseline PTSD or OCD symptom clusters/dimensions significantly predicted daily 
sexual trauma-related mental contamination when entered simultaneously. This suggests 
that we should consider the results from individually regressed domains with caution. These 
null findings are likely due, in part, to collinearity among these measures. Indeed, almost 
all correlations among symptom clusters/dimensions were positive and significant (see Table 
2). The nonsignificant finding may also be explained by limited sensitivity of measures, 
particularly the DOCS, to distinguish between PTSD and OCD as well as the significant 
overlap of symptoms between these disorders. Notably, this pattern of findings is consistent 
with findings from two recent papers that found unique PTSD symptom clusters/OCD 
symptom domains no longer existed among individuals with co-occurring PTSD and OCD 
once symptoms were considered simultaneously (Pinciotti et al., in press; Pinciotti & Orcutt, 
2020). Further research is needed to bolster the discriminant validity of the measures used in 
the current study. Finally, this was a relatively small sample, which may have limited power 
to detect significant findings, particularly in models with many parameters (Maas & Hox, 
2005).

Conclusions and Future Directions

The current study expanded on predominantly cross-sectional findings by examining how 
symptoms of OCD predict daily levels of PTSD symptomatology, as well as how individual 
and combined symptoms of OCD and PTSD predict daily levels of sexual trauma-related 
mental contamination. Further research is needed to better understand these relations, 
especially among larger more diverse samples (including cisgender men and gender diverse 
individuals) as well as individuals who have experienced other types of trauma. It will 
further be important to examine whether time elapsed since trauma has any effect on 
associations observed in this study. Longitudinal research is needed to better understand 
the development and subsequent interplay among PTSD symptoms, OCD symptoms, 
and feelings of mental contamination after a traumatic experience; the frequency and 
severity of intrusive thoughts in individuals with a comorbid PTSD-OCD diagnosis; and 
the function intrusive thoughts serve in individuals with this comorbidity. It is likely that 
PTSD symptoms and sexual trauma-related mental contamination may also lead to onset or 
worsening of OCD symptoms following sexual trauma. However, because OCD symptoms

were only measured at baseline in this study, we were unable to test for the possibility of a 
reciprocal relationship. This will be an important future direction. Finally, if the high level of 
comorbidity holds true in future research, it may be important to tailor interventions to more 
directly address the PTSD/OCD comorbidity, particularly in light of research demonstrating 
poorer treatment outcomes among individuals with this particular comorbid presentation 
(Gershuny et al., 2002, 2008).
