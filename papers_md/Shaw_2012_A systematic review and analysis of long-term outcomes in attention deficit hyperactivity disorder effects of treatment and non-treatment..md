Abstract

Background: In childhood, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by age-inappropriate
levels of inattentiveness/disorganization, hyperactivity/impulsiveness, or a combination thereof. Although the
criteria for ADHD are well defined, the long-term consequences in adults and children need to be more
comprehensively understood and quantified. We conducted a systematic review evaluating the long-term
outcomes (defined as 2 years or more) of ADHD with the goal of identifying long-term outcomes and the impact
that any treatment (pharmacological, non-pharmacological, or multimodal) has on ADHD long-term outcomes.
Methods: Studies were identified using predefined search criteria and 12 databases. Studies included were peer-
reviewed, primary studies of ADHD long-term outcomes published between January 1980 to December 2010.
Inclusion was agreed on by two independent researchers on review of abstracts or full text. Published statistical
comparison of outcome results were summarized as poorer than, similar to, or improved versus comparators, and
quantified as percentage comparisons of these categories.
Results: Outcomes from 351 studies were grouped into 9 major categories: academic, antisocial behavior, driving,
non-medicinal drug use/addictive behavior, obesity, occupation, services use, self-esteem, and social function
outcomes. The following broad trends emerged: (1) without treatment, people with ADHD had poorer long-term
outcomes in all categories compared with people without ADHD, and (2) treatment for ADHD improved long-term
outcomes compared with untreated ADHD, although not usually to normal levels. Only English-language papers
were searched and databases may have omitted relevant studies.
Conclusions: This systematic review provides a synthesis of studies of ADHD long-term outcomes. Current
treatments may reduce the negative impact that untreated ADHD has on life functioning, but does not usually
‘normalize’ the recipients.

Background
In childhood, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by age-
inappropriate levels of inattention, hyperactivity-impul-
siveness or a combination of these problems [1,2]. The
symptoms of ADHD often lead to functional impairment

in multiple domains and lower quality of life. Therefore, in
recent years the focus of intervention has expanded from
ameliorating immediate symptoms of ADHD to improving
functionality in several life domains. Moreover, although
traditionally regarded as a childhood disorder, it is now
clear that ADHD affects both children and adults. The
worldwide prevalence of ADHD has been estimated at
5.29% [3,4] with approximately 4% prevalence in adults
[5,6]. According to one meta-analysis, ADHD persists in
about 65% of adults diagnosed as children if ADHD in
partial remission is included [7], and in about 50% of

adults originally diagnosed as children according to a sepa-
rate estimate [8]. Persistence of ADHD may be related to
ADHD symptom severity, number of symptoms, ADHD
symptom subtype, ADHD in relatives, psychosocial adver-
sity, psychiatric comorbidities, and/or parental psycho-
pathology [8-15]. Many adults with ADHD are
undiagnosed and untreated. Research on ADHD in adult-
hood is relatively sparse [16] despite being recognized in
adults as early as 1968 as ‘minimal brain dysfunction’ [17]
and in 1972 as ‘hyperkinetic disorder’ [18]. Thus the nega-
tive outcomes reported by most follow-up studies may be
a consequence of untreated symptoms.

The short-term effect of ADHD treatment on symptoms
is well characterized. Beyond this, the longer-term conse-
quences have been the focus of numerous individual stu-
dies but comprehensive synthesis of the available data has
yet to be conducted, thus the present systematic review
was performed, focusing on comprehensive summary of
long-term outcomes of ADHD. Short-term studies have
demonstrated decreases in core symptoms with pharma-
cotherapy, but there is less evidence for longer-term bene-
fits. Poor adherence and persistence on therapy,
comorbidities, poor follow-up and difficulty in accessing
consistent medication management from the healthcare
system may contribute to difficulty in measuring long-
term effects of medication [19,20]. Non-pharmacological
interventions such as specialized training for parents of
children with ADHD and cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT) for adults also reduce symptoms, and a multimodal
approach may have greater effect [16,21]. Both non-phar-
macological (that is, psychological, social, and educational)
and pharmacological treatments for ADHD are recom-
mended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence (NICE) guidelines [22] with treatment selection
depending on the age of the individual and ADHD sever-
ity. Recently published European adult guidelines for the
treatment of ADHD indicate that both medications and
non-pharmacological interventions may be effective for
adults with ADHD, although more research specifically in
adults is needed [23].

The importance of long-term studies has been recog-
nized for more than a decade [24]. ADHD treatment
guidelines as well as conclusions drawn by health technol-
ogy assessment agencies recognize that ADHD is poten-
tially a lifelong condition with a profound effect on
quality-of-life [22,25-32]. Several of these organizations
recognize a need for further study of the long-term conse-
quences of ADHD and of its treatment [22,29,30,32,33].
For example, the NICE guidelines state that ‘More
research is needed on the influences on eventual outcome,
and should include enquiry about the possible benefits
(and risks) of early diagnosis and treatment’ [22]. Guide-
lines from the Oregon Health and Science University
propose that ‘Good-quality evidence on the use of

drugs to affect outcomes relating to global academic
performance, consequences of risky behaviors, social
achievements, etc. is lacking’. [34]. Because many studies
of long-term outcomes (LTOs) have in fact been con-
ducted [35], these statements may be more reflective of
the quality and variability of data, rather than a lack of
ADHD LTO studies. Comprehensive analysis of all avail-
able data would therefore be of value, and such an analysis
is the purpose of the present review.

The National Institute of Health in the US funded the
Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD
(MTA); this is one of the largest independent trials exam-
ining the effects on ADHD symptoms and long-term out-
comes of different ADHD treatments including: intensive
behavioral intervention, medication, these two treatments
combined, or routine community care [36]. In the primary
intent-to-treat analyses, outcomes in this study were not
significantly different for pharmacological treatment alone
versus combined treatment after correction for multiple
tests, but the combined group allowed as good a result
with significantly lower dose of medication (methylpheni-
date). In two secondary analyses compositing several out-
come measures, combined treatment was significantly
better than pharmacological treatment alone [36-38]. An
8-year follow-up for this trial failed to differentiate the
four treatment groups, demonstrating that regardless of
treatment, participants showed improved outcomes (delin-
quency rating, reading and overall academic performance,
and social skills) compared with baseline (pretreatment)
[39]. The reasons why the original differences between
groups disappeared after 8 years has been extensively
debated, with arguments on opposite sides that medication
was no longer effective or that all participants improved
from treatment and the improvement was sustained or
that the natural course of the disorder accounted for the
improvement. The best interpretation may be that the
data were confounded and conclusions difficult to draw
[39-41]. The MTA study is the best-known study of the
long-term outcomes of ADHD, including the early impact
of treatment on later outcomes.

Rationale
Based on the potential for long-term persistence of
ADHD into adulthood and equivocal reports on treat-
ment, we initiated this evidence-based systematic review
to understand the long-term outcomes of ADHD with
emphasis on a comprehensive synthesis of published
data. Given the large differences in study design and
measurements used, we decided that using a binary fea-
ture common to all the studies (’significantly different’
and ‘not significantly different’) to define outcome results
for LTOs would allow us to summarize all the included
studies in a non-statistical fashion. Binary variables are
used to simplify data in clinical trials for ADHD quite

frequently (for example, Clinical Global Impression-
Improvement (CGI-I), ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS)
responder analyses). ‘Long term’ was defined as 2 years
or more and ‘outcomes’ were defined as life conse-
quences, distinct from symptoms.

Objectives
Our analysis sought to answer the research question: what
are the long-term outcomes in participants with ADHD
compared to baseline or controls and do long-term out-
comes of ADHD improve with treatment (including phar-
macological, non-pharmacological and multimodal)?

Methods
Studies included in this review examined outcomes of
(1)participants with untreated ADHD, and (2) partici-
pants with treated ADHD. Studies that only examined
symptoms (as opposed to life-consequence outcomes)
were excluded. The dataset comprised studies published
between January 1980 to December 2010, including
longitudinal studies with prospective follow-up or retro-
spective measures of 2 years or more; cross-sectional
studies comparing two ages differing by 2 years or
more; and single cross-sectional studies of participants
age 10 years or older. Age 10 was chosen as the age
limit in single cross-sectional studies, based on the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth
edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis criteria
that symptoms be present before age 7 years. Examining
outcomes at age 10 years or older, would conservatively
allow at least 2 years to pass before outcomes were
assessed, in line with our definition of ‘long term’ as 2
years or more. All studies were peer-reviewed, primary
research articles in the English language with full text
available. Studies for which all participants were less
than 2 years old were excluded. Meta-analyses, case stu-
dies, and literature reviews were excluded.

The search methods for identification of studies are
summarized below. More specific details of the search
methods are provided in Additional File 1. The following
inclusionary terms and subterms were included: (1) names
of the condition; attention deficit disorder (captured all
versions of ADHD), hyperkinesis, TDAH (trouble déficit
de l’attention/hyperactivité in French, or trastorno por déf-
icit de atención con hiperactividad in Spanish), DAH (défi-
cit de l’attention/hyperactivité in French, or déficit de
atención con hiperactividad in Spanish), DAA (déficit de
l’attention/activité in French, or déficit de atención y acti-
vidad in Spanish), (2) long-term outcomes; long-term,
longitudinal, education, degree, socioeconomic, salary,
divorce, relationship, hobbies, criminality, arrest, incar-
ceration, automobile, car, driving, citation, weight, obesity,
suicide, drug abuse, addiction, substance abuse, alcohol-
ism, and (3) comparator condition or group; control,

proband, placebo, untreated, no treatment, pretreatment,
comparator, follow-up, normal. The following exclusion-
ary terms were included: (1) developmental, causal, or
symptom as subject terms (not general text words);
neuroanatomy, neuropathology, molecular, gene, develop-
ment, etiology, preclinical, dose-finding, reaction time,
and (2) publication types; reprint, review, conference
presentation.

The country of origin of each study was noted. For some
analyses, studies were grouped by world region (Northern
America and the Rest of the World, as defined by the
United Nations GeoScheme). Studies from Northern
America included those from Canada and the USA.
Northern America was identified as a comparator because
of the high percentage of participants who are treated for
ADHD in these two countries.

To assess risk of bias, we considered search bias,
researcher bias, bias of individual research groups and
bias due to changes in diagnostic criteria over time.

In the analysis of outcome results, outcomes were con-
sidered different between study groups if they were
reported to be statistically significantly different in the
study or were presented by the study authors as obviously
different so as to not require statistical comparison (for
example, a study in Norway found that 80% of the study
sample with ADHD were unemployed, while the unem-
ployment rate in Norway was 3.5% at the time.) Outcomes
that were not statistically significantly different were con-
sidered ‘similar’ to the comparator. We summarized num-
ber of outcomes as one measurement and number of
studies as a separate measurement, because some studies
reported more than one outcome. A list of all the studies
included in the final analysis is detailed in a separate publi-
cation [35].

Results
Data collection and analysis
Our search method has been described in a previous
publication [35]. To identify as many published studies as
possible, 12 databases were searched: Academic Search
Premier, CINAHL, Cochrane CRCT (including EMBASE),
Criminal Justice Abstracts, ERIC, MEDLINE, Military &
Government collection, NHS Economic Evaluation data-
base, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, SocINDEX, and Teacher
Reference Center. MEDLINE was searched using two dif-
ferent search engines. Duplicates were eliminated electro-
nically and manually, yielding 5,467 studies.

Based primarily on title and abstract, these studies were
reviewed manually and inclusion was agreed on by two
researchers. This yielded 351 studies for inclusion in the
analysis. A list of all studies included in the analysis has
been published [35].

All disagreements between researchers on study inclu-
sion were resolved by examining the full text of the study.

Studies included participants who were diagnosed with
ADHD or symptomatic presentation of ADHD as reported
by the authors of each study. Only those studies in which
ADHD was the primary disorder under study were
included. Studies included both naturalistic examination
of ADHD course (vs non-ADHD controls or start-of-
study baseline) and/or treated ADHD (vs ADHD natural
course, pretreatment baseline, or non-ADHD controls).
Treatments included pharmacological, non-pharmacologi-
cal, and/or multimodal treatment.

Data from each study was manually extracted from
the full text of the study to a database, including: (1)
study location, (2) study sample size, (3) study length,
(4) participant age range, (5) study support, (6) diagnos-
tic criteria, (7) study type (longitudinal, cross-sectional,
prospective, retrospective), (8) outcome measures, (9)
outcome results, (10) comparator type, (11) treatment
type, and (12) treatment duration. Outcome results were
measured by dichotomizing all results into a binary vari-
able of either ‘poorer’ or ‘similar’ outcomes, and with
respect to outcomes with treatment, either ‘benefit’ or
‘no benefit’ with treatment. Many studies (44%) reported
more than one outcome result, thus the number of out-
come results is more than the number of studies. While
the outcomes may be the item of interest, the number

of studies from which these outcomes are derived is also
informative and so is also reported.

Outcome groups
Outcome measures were compiled into nine major
groups based on commonality of outcome characteris-
tics (Figure 1). This grouping of outcomes has also been
described in a prior publication [35]. These groups
included: (1) non-medicinal drug use/addictive behavior
(for example, use, abuse, and dependence on alcohol,
cigarettes, marijuana, stimulants, or illicit drugs; age at
first use; multiple substance use; gambling), (2) aca-
demic (for example, achievement test scores, grade
point average, repeated grades, years of schooling,
degrees earned), (3) antisocial behavior (for example,
school expulsion, delinquency, self-reported crimes,
arrests, detainment, incarceration, repeat convictions),
(4) social function (for example, relationships, peer
nomination scores, marital status, multiple divorces,
activities, hobbies), (5) occupation (for example, employ-
ment, military service, job changes, occupation level,
socioeconomic status), (6) self-esteem (for example, self-
esteem scales, self-perception, suicide ideation, suicide
attempts, suicide rate) (7) driving (for example, acci-
dents, traffic violations, license suspensions, driving

Figure 1 Number of outcome results by group. The pie chart shows the number of outcome results by outcome group. Note that the
number of outcomes exceeds the number of studies included, because some studies examined more than one outcome. The greatest number
of outcomes was measured for drug use/addictive behavior, followed by academic, antisocial behavior, social function, occupation, self-esteem,
driving, services use, and obesity outcomes.

record), (8) services use (for example, justice system,
emergency health care, financial assistance), and (9) obe-
sity (body mass index (BMI), weight).

Outcome result frequency
The number of outcome results in each outcome group
can be seen in Figure 1. Drug use/addictive behavior was
the most-studied outcome (160 outcome results), fol-
lowed by academic (119 outcome results), antisocial
behavior (104 outcome results), social function (98 out-
come results), occupation (45 outcome results) self-
esteem (44 outcome results), driving (30 outcome
results), and services use (26 outcome results). Obesity
was the least studied outcome (ten outcome results).
Note that the total number of outcomes results (636) is
greater than the total number of studies (351) because
some studies reported more than a single outcome result.
Figure 2 shows the total number of studies published
per year. There was a noticeable rise in studies of long-
term outcomes of ADHD published worldwide between
1980 and 2008. The number of long-term outcome studies
published at the peak in 2008 was 42 studies, dropping
back to 28 in 2009 and 2010. The mean study length var-
ied little by year, with a total mean of 9 years for which
researchers collected data for each subject and range of 2

to 40 years for which researchers collected data for each
subject. Data collection refers either to follow-up measures
in the case of prospective studies or analysis of past
records or reports in the case of retrospective studies.

Participant ages
The ages of the participants were examined by studies of
specific outcomes (Figure 3A). Studies of children with a
mid-range or mean age of 6 to 12 years measured services
use, self-esteem, social function, academic outcomes, obe-
sity, antisocial behavior, and drug use/addictive behavior,
in that order of frequency. All nine outcome groups were
measured in adults and adolescents. Within age categories
(Figure 3B), social function and academic outcomes com-
prised the largest proportion of children outcomes (53%),
while drug use/addictive behavior and antisocial behavior
comprised the largest proportion of adult and adolescent
outcomes (43 and 46%, respectively). A substantial propor-
tion of outcomes in children and adolescents together
were self-esteem and social function outcomes (28%).

Outcomes with untreated ADHD
Poorer outcomes were generally observed in untreated
participants with ADHD (Figure 4). In all, 89 studies
showed that people with untreated ADHD had outcomes

use), whereas a greater proportion of outcomes examined in adults can be seen on the top (occupation). (B) This graph shows the proportion
of outcomes reported within each age category. Each colored section corresponds to the outcomes reported for each outcome group as a

not substantially different from controls (26% of outcome
results), whereas 244 studies showed that untreated parti-
cipants with ADHD experienced poorer long-term out-
comes (74% of outcome results). Note that more
outcomes were observed than studies because some stu-
dies reported more than one outcome. There were a few
studies (6) that reported outcomes (6) for participants
with untreated ADHD that were significantly better than
non-ADHD controls. The derived or reported effect sizes

were not large, and these few outcomes were included in
the outcomes that were ‘similar’ to controls. No single
outcome group was represented; the outcomes varied
among drug use/addictive behavior, occupation, self-
esteem, and social function outcomes.

Also found in the search were five studies that fol-
lowed untreated participants with ADHD over 2 to 9
years and compared the long-term outcomes with the
participants’ status at baseline [42-46]. Four of these

Figure 4 Untreated participants with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared with non-ADHD controls. The
percentage of the total number of outcomes is provided for each bar. The total number of studies represented in each bar is shown in
parentheses. The green bar shows the percentage of outcome results reported as similar (26% of outcomes; 89 studies) in untreated participants
with ADHD compared with non-ADHD participants. The blue bar shows the percentage of outcome results reported as poorer (74% of
outcomes; 244 studies) in untreated participants with ADHD compared with non-ADHD participants. The sum of the numbers of studies shown
under each bar does not equal the total number of studies represented in this figure; several studies reported some outcomes that were similar
to control and some outcomes that were poorer than controls. Therefore these studies are represented in both types of outcome.

studies reported a significant deterioration from baseline
without treatment [42-45]. Of these four, three reported
a deterioration in academic outcomes (increased num-
ber of failing grades over 2 years and decline in math
and reading scores over 9 years) [42-44] and one [45]
reported a worsening in tobacco use outcomes (levels of
salivary cotinine measured daily rose in untreated parti-
cipants with ADHD over 2 years. Cotinine is an alkaloid
from tobacco and a metabolite from nicotine, used as a
measure of the number of tobacco cigarettes smoked
per day). One study followed untreated participants with
ADHD for 8 years into adolescence and reported an
improvement in social function compared with the par-
ticipant’s baseline measured at the beginning of the
study, although function remained significantly poorer
than non-ADHD control levels [46].

Many studies did not report effect size, and effect
sizes varied among studies that did report it. For exam-
ple, a study of driving outcomes reported a small effect
size with a Cohen’s d of 0.33 (P = 0.04) for the differ-
ence in the number of traffic accidents in the last 6
months for participants with ADHD (0.29 ± 0.73

accidents) compared with non-ADHD controls (0.15 ±
0.43 accidents), albeit this small effect size represented
almost twice the rate of accidents for the ADHD group
[47]. Another study of social function reported a large
effect size with a Cohen’s d of 1.03 (P < 0.001) for the
difference in the parent-reported peer rejection scores
for children with ADHD (0.45 ± 0.55) compared with
non-ADHD controls (0.07 ± 0.23), while controlling for
conduct disorder as a comorbidity [48]. It is possible in
studies of smaller sample size that there may have been
small effects that were not reported as differences,
because statistical significance was not demonstrable
due to the small sample size. For the purposes of the
present analysis, to provide an overall comprehensive
synthesis of reported study results, all results were ana-
lyzed as reported without additional interpretive changes
on our part. Inclusion in this regard was limited by the
report having passed through the peer-review process.

Outcomes with ADHD treatment
Treated ADHD versus untreated ADHD was compared
in 48 studies with 76 outcomes (Figure 5). ‘Untreated

Figure 5 Treated participants with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared with untreated ADHD. The percentage of
the total number of outcome results is provided for each bar. The total number of studies represented in each bar is shown in parentheses. The
dark green bar shows the percentage of outcome results reported as exhibiting benefit (72% of outcomes; 37 studies) in treated participants
with ADHD compared with untreated ADHD. The light green bar shows the percentage of outcome results reported as exhibiting no benefit
(28% of outcomes; 15 studies) in treated participants with ADHD compared with untreated ADHD. Similar to Figure 4, the sum of the numbers
of studies shown under each bar does not equal the total number of studies of this type, because several studies have reported some outcomes
that exhibited benefit from treatment and some that did not and so these studies are represented in both types of outcome.

ADHD’ comparators included both pretreatment base-
line comparisons and comparison with an untreated
group of participants with ADHD. Overall, treatment of
ADHD resulted in favorable outcomes for most out-
comes reported (55 of 76 outcome results; 72%). Three
types of outcome results for which treatment was con-
sidered beneficial were: (1) improvement compared with
participants with untreated ADHD (38% outcome
results), (2) improvement compared with pretreatment
baseline (22% outcome results), and (3) stabilization
compared with pretreatment baseline (12% outcome
results). Stabilization compared to pretreatment baseline
was considered a benefit of treatment because it indi-
cated that treatment may have alleviated the natural-
course deterioration in outcomes over time that has
been observed in separate study samples of untreated
ADHD [42,43,45,46]. None of the studies reporting sta-
bilization compared with pretreatment baseline also
included an untreated ADHD group, therefore this is an
across-study sample comparison, subject to limitations.
Three types of outcome results for which there was con-
sidered no benefit with treatment were: (1) no difference
compared with participants with untreated ADHD (25%
outcome results), (2) poorer outcomes compared with

participants with untreated ADHD (1.5% outcomes
results), and (3) poorer outcomes compared with pretreat-
ment baseline (1.5% outcomes results). In outcomes for
which there was no difference compared with participants
with untreated ADHD, while there was no benefit to treat-
ment, there was also no detriment either, such as increased
incidence of substance use disorder or increased rate of
suicide. No significantly increased incidence of substance
abuse disorders or suicide rate compared with participants
with untreated ADHD (or compared with pretreatment
baseline either) was reported in any study included in this
analysis. There was a single outcome following treatment
that was worse for participants with untreated ADHD
(increased experimentation with cocaine). A single out-
come was reported to be worse than pretreatment baseline
(greater percentage of study participants with decreased
grade point average).

In 42 studies, the outcome results (n = 76) of partici-
pants with treated ADHD were compared with the out-
comes of non-ADHD controls. Again, more outcomes
were observed than studies because some studies
reported more than one outcome. Most such studies did
not show normalization with treatment. Only 18 out-
comes in 16 studies were similar for participants with

Figure 6 Benefit and no benefit with treatment by outcome group. This graph shows benefit (dark green bars) or no benefit (light green
bars) by outcome group in treated participants with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) versus untreated ADHD. Improvement was
reported most often in studies of driving and obesity outcomes (left side), with a greater proportion of outcomes reported to exhibit no benefit
following treatment compared with no treatment in studies of occupation (right side). An intermediate proportion of studies of self-esteem,
social function, academic, drug use/addictive behavior, antisocial behavior, and services use outcomes reported benefit with treatment.

treated ADHD versus non-ADHD controls. A total of 58
outcomes (76% of outcomes) in 35 studies, poorer out-
comes were observed for participants with treated
ADHD relative to non-ADHD controls.

Benefit with treatment was analyzed according to speci-
fic outcome group for participants with treated versus
untreated ADHD (Figure 6). Note that this analysis
involved the same 48 studies and 76 outcomes in the ana-
lysis shown in Figure 5, with the same 3 conditions con-
sidered as beneficial with treatment and the same 3
considered to exhibit no benefit with treatment. For 100%
of driving and obesity outcomes reported, treatment of
ADHD was beneficial. For 90% of self-esteem outcomes,
83% of social function outcomes, 71% of academic out-
comes, 67% of drug use/addictive behavior outcomes, 50%
of antisocial behavior outcomes, 50% of services use out-
comes and 33% of occupation outcomes, treatment was
reported to be beneficial. In the case of services use, less
use of services (for example, emergency room visits, finan-
cial assistance) was considered to be an improvement with
treatment.

Four of the nine outcome groups exhibited a substantial
percentage of no benefit with treatment. These four out-
come groups were drug use/addictive behavior, antisocial
behavior, services use, and occupation. A subanalysis of

these four outcomes examined the post-hoc hypothesis
that less aggressive/consistent treatment of ADHD in the
rest of the world compared with Northern America (based
in part on stricter diagnosis criteria for the International
Classification of Diseases, tenth edition (ICD-10) versus
the DSM-IV-TR [49,50]) may account for the rate of
reported treatment benefit observed in these four outcome
groups in Figure 6. Thus, treatment outcome by region for
this subgroup of outcomes was examined (Figure 7). For
these 4 outcome groups, studies performed in Northern
America were evenly split in reporting outcome results
exhibiting treatment benefit versus no benefit (11 outcome
results each, 50% each). In contrast, studies performed in
countries in the rest of the world (all from Europe, in this
case) reported a higher percentage of outcome results
exhibiting treatment benefit (six of seven outcome results;
86%, four of which were improvement in drug use/addic-
tive behavior outcomes) versus no benefit with treatment
(one of seven outcome results; 14%) (Figure 7). This result
clearly shows that reported results of treatment in the rest
of the world do not underlie the higher percentage of out-
come results exhibiting no benefit with treatment for
these four outcomes. On the contrary, studies from the
rest of the world reported a larger percentage of outcomes
exhibiting treatment benefits.

Figure 7 Treatment results by region for a subgroup of outcomes. Outcomes exhibiting benefit versus no benefit with treatment are
shown for Northern America (yellow bars) versus the rest of the world (green bars). Note that Northern America includes Canada and the USA,
and Rest of World, in this case, consists of countries in Europe. The response to treatment for four outcome groups was included: drug use/
addictive behavior, antisocial behavior, services use, and occupation outcomes. The percentage of studies reporting benefit with treatment for
these outcomes is greater for the rest of the world compared with Northern America. As in Figure 5, the sum of the numbers of studies shown
under each bar does not equal the total number of studies of this type, because a single study reported an outcome that exhibited benefit from
treatment and one that did not, and so this study is represented in both types of outcome.

Further analysis of the results observed in Figure 7
showed that this result did not appear to be associated
with types of treatment, comparator groups, or outcome
groups of interest in Europe compared with Northern
America [35]. A greater percentage, however, of these out-
come results from the rest of the world were reported in
retrospective studies of adults (3 of 4 studies; 75%) com-
pared with those from Northern America (2 of 19 studies;
11%). The majority of these outcomes from Northern
America were reported in prospective studies of various
age groups (15 of 19 studies; 79%). Thus, differences in
study design may underlie the result shown in Figure 7.
The various treatment types mentioned in all the studies
are listed in Additional File 2. Of the 130 studies that men-
tion treatment, 120 (92%), 49 (38%), and 24 (18%) studies
mentioned pharmacological treatment, non-pharmacologi-
cal treatment, and/or multimodal treatment, respectively.

Discussion
Overall, the results of the present study show that the
long-term outcomes for participants with ADHD when
left untreated were poor compared with non-ADHD
controls, and that treatment of ADHD improved long-
to the point of
term outcomes, but usually not

normalization. The outcomes that were studied (with
ADHD symptoms deliberately excluded as an outcome)
most often included drug use/addictive behavior, aca-
demic, and antisocial behavior. This was followed by
social function, self-esteem, occupation, driving, services
use, and obesity outcomes. These trends may reflect
what is of most immediate interest to society in a given
time period. For example, obesity, the least-studied out-
come, has come into interest only recently, likely due to
the increasing obesity epidemic in developed countries.
Increasing interest in the epidemiology of obesity, led to
the report of an association between obesity and ADHD
in 2002 [51]. Our data also indicate that there are speci-
fic geographical trends, with academic outcomes being
of greater interest for study in the US and Canada and
antisocial behaviors of greater interest in Europe. This
difference of interest may be a function of only more
severe cases, likely to have oppositional-defiant or con-
duct disorder comorbidity, being diagnosed outside
Northern America. These trends have been described in
more detail in a separate publication [35].

The number of studies of long-term outcomes of
ADHD has risen noticeably over the last 30 years, espe-
cially since 2000. This corresponds to a trend in

Shaw et al. BMC Medicine 2012, 10:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/10/99

Page 11 of 15

awareness of the consequences of ADHD by clinicians,
which appears to be on the rise [52].

Treatment resulted in beneficial effects for many of the
outcomes reported (72% of outcome results). These benefi-
cial effects were observed as either significant improvement
over pretreatment baseline, in comparison to untreated
ADHD participants, or stabilization of the outcomes (that
is, prevention of the deterioration over time from baseline
reported with untreated ADHD [43-46]). Driving and obe-
sity outcomes were the most often reported to be respon-
sive to treatment. Of course, a decrease in obesity may be
due to an appetite suppressant effect of stimulants and ato-
moxetine. The relatively small number of studies of these
two outcomes (two studies each) comparing treated with
untreated ADHD and the consistently positive response to
treatment support further investigation in these areas.
Three other outcomes that were often reported to be
responsive to treatment were self-esteem, social function,
and academic outcomes. These results are supported by a
relatively large number of studies (10, 12, and 21 studies,
respectively) comparing participants with treated ADHD
with participants with untreated ADHD. These outcomes
may be more closely related to symptom relief. The out-
comes reported are not independent of one another and
changes in one may reflect changes in others. The wider
effects of response to treatment in these two areas may
warrant further investigation.

The four remaining outcomes that appeared to be least
responsive to treatment were drug use/addictive behavior,
antisocial behavior, services use, and occupation, with
67%, 50%, 50%, and 33% of reported outcome results
demonstrating a benefit of treatment, respectively. Persis-
tence in these cases may have to do with the existence of
comorbidities, such as conduct disorder, which has for
example, been associated with increased substance use
disorders [53]. Oppositional defiant disorder or conduct
disorder, may contribute to long-term outcomes in people
with ADHD, specifically crime and substance use [54-56],
and thus may affect the response observed for these out-
comes with treatment for ADHD. Other comorbidities,
such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or aut-
ism may have similarly influenced the results we observed.
Services use may persist due to the incomplete ameli-
oration of ADHD symptoms and impairments, possibly
because although ADHD symptoms (like outcomes)
respond to treatment, they are not completely normal-
ized. Finally, continued impairment in occupation
despite treatment may reflect the cumulative effects of
ADHD symptoms and dysfunctioning over the lifespan.
For example, low academic grades may later restrict
employment or opportunities, impaired social function
may precipitate extra friction with employers. The dif-
ferential responsiveness of different outcomes to treat-
ment is an intriguing area for future study.

It should be mentioned that if we had categorized the
study outcomes by age, such as 5 to 17 and over 18, we
may have observed different areas of improvement
depending on the age group. In combining the groups it
is possible that this distinction is lost. One also needs to
consider however, that certain categories such as occu-
pation would not be as relevant to the 5 to 17 age
group as opposed to academic achievement, which
would apply to all groups.

Even with treatment, worse outcomes were often
reported for the ADHD group than for people without
ADHD. This is not surprising, because although beha-
vioral and drug treatment have been demonstrated to
improve ADHD symptoms, these treatments do not
necessarily normalize behavior to control levels [35,57-61].
For example, in one study of the effect of methylpheni-
date treatment on classroom measures, a 20 mg dose
produced normalization in 30% to 60% of participants,
(depending on the measurement used) although 53% to
94% showed improvement [58]. Many studies (42) in our
analysis evaluated treatment effects only against non-
ADHD controls, as opposed to pretreatment baseline or
any untreated state. In these studies, only 24% of outcomes
were reported to be similar for treated ADHD and non-
ADHD controls. For all the other outcomes reported
(76%), the outcomes remained worse than non-ADHD
controls, and there was no mechanism with this study
design by which to measure improvement with treatment
that did not completely ‘normalize’ the outcome. In studies
with other study designs (comparing participants with trea-
ted ADHD and participants with untreated ADHD or pre-
treatment baseline), benefit with treatment was reported
for 72% of the outcomes. These study designs allowed the
improvement with treatment to be demonstrated, even
though the outcome may not have ‘normalized’. When
considering the effects of treatment reported in any one
study, the comparator group used to evaluate the effective-
ness of ADHD treatment is particularly important.

The results of four studies included in this analysis
that used both types of comparators within the same
study ((1) non-ADHD controls and (2) untreated ADHD
participants or ADHD participant’s pretreatment base-
line) were consistent with the present overall observa-
tions that there was clear improvement or stabilization
with treatment of ADHD for social function, antisocial
behavior, and academic outcomes, but not to the extent
that non-ADHD control outcomes were matched
[13,39,48,62]. This general pattern was noticed in the
earliest of the four studies, as the authors conclude in
their 12-year follow-up study that ‘The most striking
finding of the study is the repetitive pattern of finding
significant differences between the stimulant-treated
hyperactives and their control group (with the control
group almost invariably doing better). However, there

Shaw et al. BMC Medicine 2012, 10:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/10/99

Page 12 of 15

are several areas in which the stimulant-treated hyperac-
tives seem to do better than their untreated counter-
parts’ (referring to academic, driving, self-esteem, and
social function outcomes) [13]. This pattern was also
found in an 8-year follow-up study of a different sample
‘despite overall maintenance of improvement in func-
tioning relative to baseline (pretreatment), the MTA
group as a whole was functioning significantly less well
than the non-ADHD classmate sample’ [39]. In the pre-
sent study, this pattern was broadly replicated across the
outcome groups when analyzed individually. Compari-
sons against non-ADHD controls only, may mask
improvements with treatment.

It should be noted that ADHD Rating Scale IV total
scores decline (improve) between ages 5 to 7 and ages
14 to 18 in both Caucasians and African-Americans
(although in Latinos they actually increase during these
time periods). Hyperactivity-impulsivity scores, espe-
cially, decline from ages 4 to 7 to age 14 and older in
both boys and girls [63]. Therefore, we cannot discount
that natural decline in symptoms (and possibly other
dysfunctions) occurring over time also contributes to
the improvement in outcomes observed with treatment,
although this idea contradicts the reported worsening of
functional domains in untreated ADHD. According to
one paper, symptoms and functioning are related. With
full symptom remission, illicit drug use and antisocial
behaviors become similar to non-ADHD controls, but
while social function improves, it does not reach non-
ADHD levels [64].

Finally, we observed that treatment outcomes for the
subgroup of domains that exhibit lower percentages of
outcomes that benefit from treatment (drug use/addic-
tive behavior, antisocial behavior, services use, and occu-
pation) were differentially improved when studies from
Northern America were compared with those from the
rest of the world (in this case, all ‘Rest of World’ studies
were from Europe). Based on this analysis there appears
to be a geographical bias with regard to how responsive
these four outcome group results are reported to be
with treatment, a result that may be accounted for by
regional differences in study design along with the
resulting study population age, or diagnostic practices.
In this very specific comparison, the numbers of studies
from ‘Rest of World’ countries are low (four studies,
seven outcome results), thus as further investigation of
these outcomes around the world are published, the
results of this comparison may be clarified.

Limitations and possible sources of bias
Several possible risks of bias and limitations need to be
considered regarding the included studies. First, a publi-
cation and cultural bias could have resulted from
including only studies that were published in English. In

addition, the analysis excluded unpublished studies that
might have been presented at conferences, for example.
Also, our search relied on search engines for ‘peer
reviewed’ status. Moreover, by strictly adhering to
Cochrane systematic review guidelines and only includ-
ing studies that were identified in our original electronic
search, it is possible that some relevant studies may
have been missed, introducing a search engine and lit-
erature database bias. This bias was reduced by exten-
sive searching of 12 databases. Nonetheless, we are
aware of four studies that would have met inclusion cri-
teria, but were not identified by the search engines due
to a technical limitation or inadvertent search string
exclusion. Examination of these studies shows that the
reported results are consistent with the overall results of
the present analysis. The results of these four studies
are summarized briefly here. One study reported poorer
outcomes for participants with ADHD versus non-
ADHD controls with regard to academic achievement,
occupational adjustment, antisocial behavior, relation-
ships, and substance use [65]. A second study found a
high incidence of ADHD (65%) in 23 adolescents who
attempted suicide [66]. A third study reported that by
young adulthood, participants with ADHD were similar
to non-ADHD controls in minor aspects of social and
occupational outcomes (e.g., time socializing with
friends and with hobbies), but had poorer outcomes in
major aspects of these outcomes (e.g., had many more
offspring and most were not living with them) [67]. A
fourth study found that stimulant treatment in children
with ADHD significantly improved reading scores and
decreased grade retention [68]. The results of these stu-
dies are consistent with our overall
finding that
untreated ADHD is associated with poor long-term out-
comes and that these outcomes improve with treatment.
Researcher bias could also be a possible source of bias
in this analysis, however, this was reduced by having
two researchers independently agree on the articles
included and strict, simple inclusion criteria were estab-
lished prior to searching.

Other sources of bias could include biases of indivi-
dual research groups, which was eliminated by including
only electronically identified studies (as mentioned
above) and not selectively including the studies of speci-
fic groups and omitting others. As observed, different
study designs may also lead to different conclusions and
taking comparators into consideration is critical. We
included studies of various designs, which may minimize
such bias.

A further possible bias could arise from changes over
time in diagnostic criteria or discrepancy between classi-
fication systems, specifically differences in the definition
of hyperkinetic disorder (ICD-9 or ICD-10) versus
ADHD (DSM-III/DSM-III-R/DSM-IV). Differences are

Shaw et al. BMC Medicine 2012, 10:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/10/99

Page 13 of 15

less likely within classification systems [3]. One study
found that 93% of children diagnosed with ADHD using
DSM-III-R diagnosis also received a DSM-IV ADHD
diagnosis, indicating good correspondence between clas-
sification systems [69]. Rediagnosis of the MTA sample
by ICD criteria, however, resulted in only 25% of the
DSM-IV-diagnosed MTA sample of combined-type
ADHD qualifying as having hyperkinetic disorder or
hyperkinetic conduct disorder by ICD-10 criteria [69].

Conclusions
The present analysis supports the premise that without
treatment, people with ADHD often experience poorer
long-term outcomes and that treatment may improve the
long-term outcomes of ADHD for some individuals, but
not necessarily to the degree of healthy controls. Further
analyses of the present data set will more comprehensively
examine the impact of treatment on specific outcomes, as
well as the impact of specific types of treatment modal-
ities. The question remains as to whether the short-term
benefits demonstrated by short-term drug or non-pharma-
cological treatment studies translate directly into long-
term outcomes. Associations between specific short-term
symptoms need to be examined as possible predictors for
long-term outcomes, particularly because long-term stu-
dies are not always feasible. Future research should focus
on the association between short-term symptom relief and
long-term consequences and include longer-term follow-
up of the consequences of childhood ADHD into the
adult years.
