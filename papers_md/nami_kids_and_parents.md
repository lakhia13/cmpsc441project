Identifying warning signs or symptoms and seeking treatment early can make a difference in reducing the impact of a mental health condition.

### Be Aware of What to Look For, When to Worry, and How to Respond


Children go through developmental phases that include changes in emotions, thoughts, and behavior. Most of the time, these are typical periods in development, such as the “terrible twos” when children usually have trouble separating and experience “meltdowns,” which is a stark contrast to one year olds who are not as troubled by exploring their world.

When teenagers give you the cold shoulder, shut down or “snap” at you, they may be trying, as teens should, to become their own individuals.

During this time, they’re developing their personal identities and breaking away from the family. Again, this is typical behavior. But when this type of situation persists or begins causing difficulty in their daily life, it may be a symptom of a mental health condition. This is the time to intervene.
