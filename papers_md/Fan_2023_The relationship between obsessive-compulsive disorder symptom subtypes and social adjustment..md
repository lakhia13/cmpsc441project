Abstract

Background:  Although it has been widely established that poor social functioning is 
a characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), little research has examined the 
relationship between OCD symptom subtypes and domains of social functioning. Thus, the 
present study sought to examine the specific ways in which impairment in social adjustment 
occurs in each symptom subtype of OCD.

Methods:  A total of 325 adult participants with a primary diagnosis of OCD were included in 
the study. Hierarchical linear regressions were used to compare the extent to which OCD symptom 
subtypes predicted social adjustment domains after controlling for OCD and depression severity.

Results:  Hoarding was shown to be significantly associated with work functioning. Whereas 
both contamination and symmetry subtypes were significantly associated with social functioning, 
only the contamination subtype was associated with functioning within the family unit. The 
symptom subtypes of doubt and taboo thoughts were not significantly associated with any domains 
of social adjustment.

Conclusion:  Consistent with previous research, our results suggest a differential impact of 
OCD symptom subtypes on social adjustment. They offer important implications for the specific 
domains to target in treatment for different symptom subtypes.

Introduction

Page 2

It has been widely established that poor psychosocial functioning is a characteristic of 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Bystritsky et al., 2001; Didie et al., 2007; Huppert 
et al., 2009; Mancebo et al., 2008; Steketee, 1997). Individuals with OCD report lower 
functioning compared to published community norms (Didie et al., 2007) and healthy 
populations (Huppert et al., 2009). This impairment in psychosocial functioning among 
individuals with OCD can include various aspects of life such as work, social, and family 
relationships (Cain et al., 2015; Himle et al., 2017; Huppert et al., 2009; Mancebo et 
al., 2008; Steketee, 1997). Mancebo et al. (2008) reported a substantial portion (38%) of 
individuals with OCD as being unable to work for psychiatric reasons. Similarly, Steketee 
(1997) found that individuals with OCD were more likely to be unemployed compared to 
those without the disorder. For interpersonal social functioning, the majority of previous 
research in adults with OCD focused on the familial aspect: in marriage, individuals 
with OCD experience increased marital distress, less intimacy, and sexual dysfunction 
(Kasalova et al., 2020); previous research has also shown that individuals with OCD 
reported significantly more negative family interactions, compared to people who did not 
(Chambless et al., 2007; Himle et al., 2017). However, it is worth noting that relationship 
impairment is likely multifactorial as high expressed emotion is often characteristic of 
families of those with OCD (Chambless et al., 2007). Other than family relationships, very 
limited research exists on examining other relationship variables. Himle et al. (2017) showed 
that OCD symptoms did not have a significant impact on friendships.

Previous studies have suggested that individuals with OCD are not all uniformly socially 
impaired (Albert et al., 2010; Schwartzman et al., 2017; Vorstenbosch et al., 2012). Past 
research has found differential relationships between OCD symptoms types and domains of 
functional impairment. After controlling for the presence of a comorbid mood disorder and 
OCD severity, Vorstenbosch et al. (2012) found that the obsessions/checking and hoarding 
subtypes were associated with functional impairment, but not symmetry/ordering and 
contamination/cleaning subtypes. Specifically, the subtype of obsessions/checking predicted 
overall impairment and lifestyle impairment such as health and recreation; the subtype of 
hoarding predicted overall impairment and impairment in activity involvement such as work 
and social relations. Although Vorstenbosch et al. (2012) found that no individual OCD 
symptom subtype was associated with relationship impairment, other studies have found 
high severity of symmetry symptoms to be associated with divorce status (Muhlbauer et 
al., 2021) and poor quality of life in social relationships (Schwartzman et al., 2017). Poor 
quality of life in social relationships is also shown to be associated with contamination 
symptoms in OCD (Schwartzman et al, 2017). Taken together, previous studies suggested 
that individuals with OCD were not uniformly socially impaired. Thus, it is important to 
further investigate how domains of functional impairments vary based on OCD symptom 
subtypes.

The present study sought to understand the relationship between five OCD symptom 
subtypes (symmetry/ordering, hoarding, doubt/checking, contamination/cleaning, and taboo 
thoughts) (Pinto et al., 2007) and six domains of social adjustment (work, social and leisure, 
extended family, marital, parental, and family unit domains) (Weissman & Bothwell, 1976). 
We hypothesized that OCD symptom subtypes would have differential impacts on domains 
of social adjustment. Specifically, we hypothesized that all symptom subtypes of OCD will 
be significantly associated with impaired social functioning in marital, parental, and family 
unit domains. Other than those, hoarding will be associated with impaired work functioning; 
symmetry/ordering, doubt/checking, and contamination/cleaning will be associated with 
impaired functioning in social leisure.

2.  Methods

2.1  Participants

A total of 325 adult participants who were part of the Brown Longitudinal Obsessive 
Compulsive Study were included in this study. A detailed description of the methods of 
the study can be found in Pinto et al. (2006). In the study, participants were recruited 
from psychiatric treatment settings between July 2001 and February 2006. Inclusion criteria 
were age 19 or older, a primary diagnosis of DSM-IV OCD (defined as the disorder that 
participants considered their biggest problem overall across their lifetime), having sought 
treatment for OCD, and willingness to participate in annual interviews. Individuals with 
organic mental disorders were excluded from the study. The study was approved by the 
institutional review boards of Brown University and Butler Hospital, and all subjects signed 
statements of informed consent prior to enrollment. The current study only includes data 
from the intake assessment.

2.2  Measures

The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders-Patient Version (SCID-I/P) 
was used to diagnose DSM-IV psychiatric disorders (First, 1997). The Butler Hospital 
OCD Database, a semi-structured, rater-administered questionnaire, was used to collect 
participants’ demographic information (Rasmussen & Eisen, 1994).

The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS; Goodman et al., 1989a, b), a 10-
item rater-administered interview was used to assess severity of obsessions and compulsions. 
Prior to the Y-BOCS, raters administered the Y-BOCS Symptom Checklist to gather 
information on specific current symptoms. The reliability and validity of the YBOCS 
is well-established (Goodman et al., 1989a, b). Internal consistency in this sample was 
excellent (α=.93).

Modified Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Miller et al., 1985), a rater-administered 
interview with strong reliability and validity, was used to measure depression severity. 
Higher scores indicate greater depression severity (Miller et al., 1985). The MHRSD 
exhibited strong internal consistency in this sample (α=.89).

Social Adjustment Scale Self-Report (SAS) was used to measure participants’ current social 
functioning (Weissman & Bothwell, 1976). This scale contains a total of 42 questions that

measure role performances in six subscales of social functioning: work including work 
for pay and housework; social and leisure activities; relationships with extended family; 
marital role as a spouse; role as a parent; and role as a member of the family unit. 
Internal consistency reliability ranged from acceptable to good (α =.61–.79). For each 
domain, items include four categories: the amount of friction with others; interpersonal 
behaviors; feelings and satisfactions; and behavior performance. Each item is rated on a 
five-point Likert-type scale, with higher scores indicating more severe impairment. The SAS 
differentiates individuals with psychiatric disorders from healthy controls (Weissman et al., 
1978; Weissman et al., 2001; Gameroff et al., 2012) as well as individuals with current OCD 
from those in remission (Huppert et al., 2009).

2.3  Data Analysis Plan

R version 4.2.1 was used to perform data analysis. Five symptom subtypes (symmetry/
ordering, hoarding, doubt/checking, contamination/cleaning, and taboo thoughts) were 
derived using a principal components analysis, reported in detail elsewhere (see Pinto et 
al., 2007). Briefly, in an exploratory factor analysis, scores were computed for each of 
the symptoms endorsed on the YBOCS Symptom Checklist divided by the number of 
items present in each of the 14 categories. We used an interval scoring system, rather 
than a dichotomous (present/absent) (Cullen et al., 2007) or a three-point ordinal rating 
(Mataix-Cols et al., 1999), to increase the range of category scores and to maximize the 
variance in our dataset. Proportions, unlike the symptom counts used in Leckman et al. 
(1997), do not give undue weights to categories composed of numerous items. Criteria for 
retention of factors were Kaiser’s criterion (eigenvalues >1), Cattell’s scree test, pattern of 
factor loadings, and factor interpretability. Initial factors were extracted using the principal 
components method, followed by varimax rotation, with loadings ≥ 0.45 considered 
significant. These five symptom subtypes have been supported in large-scale genetic studies 
(Pinto et al., 2008) and have been shown to differentially predict course and outcome in 
this sample (Eisen et al., 2013). Hierarchical linear regressions were used to compare the 
extent to which OCD symptom subtypes predicted SAS domains after controlling for OCD 
and depression severity. Prior research has suggested that the relationship between OCD 
symptom subtypes and social adjustment or QoL was significantly accounted for by these 
two factors (Eisen et al., 2006; Fontenelle et al., 2010; Jacoby et al., 2014; Kugler et 
al., 2013; Masellis et al., 2003; Schwartzman et al., 2017; Stengler-Wenzke et al., 2007; 
Vorstenbosch et al., 2012). For each SAS domain, OCD and depression severity were 
entered into the first step, with OCD symptom subtypes added into the second step. All 
assumptions underlying regression were met.

3.  Results

Our sample was predominantly white (97.5%), female (54.5%), college-educated (56.6%), 
employed (58.2%), and married (44.3%). The mean age was 40.1 years (SD=12.8). 
Participants reported a moderate level of OCD symptoms (M=20.6, SD=8.4) and a mild 
level of depression symptoms (M=10.9, SD=9.9). As reported on SAS-SR, participants’ 
mean score of overall social adjustment was 2.0 (SD=0.5). Participants’ mean scores for 
each domain were as follows: work (M=1.8, SD=0.5), social and leisure (M=2.4, SD=0.7),

extended family (M=1.9, SD=0.5), marital (M=2.2, SD=0.6), parental (M=1.6, SD=0.6), and 
family unit (M=2.1, SD=0.8). These mean SAS scores were similar to the scores reported in 
prior studies examining individuals with OCD (Didie et al., 2007; Huppert et al., 2009).

Results for the hierarchical linear regression models comparing the extent to which OCD 
symptom subtypes predicted SAS domains are shown in Table 1. After controlling for 
OCD and depression severity, symmetry (B=0.05, p<.05), hoarding (B=0.08, p<.05), and 
contamination (B=0.14, p<.05) subtypes were associated with overall social adjustment. 
Hoarding was the only subtype significantly associated with the work domain of SAS 
(B=0.14, p<.01). Contamination was the only symptom subtype significantly associated with 
the marital (B=0.27, p<.01), family unit (B=0.27, p<.05), and extended family (B=0.16, 
p<.05) domains. Symmetry (B=0.09, p<.01) and contamination (B=0.23, p<.01) subtypes 
were significantly associated with the social and leisure domain. Symptom subtypes were 
not significantly associated with the parental domain of SAS. Doubt and taboo thoughts 
symptom subtypes were not significantly associated with any domain or the overall score of 
SAS.

4.  Discussion

Many researchers have proposed that substantial heterogeneity exists in OCD symptoms 
with more homogeneity in symptom subtypes (Ball et al., 1996; Mataix-Cols et al., 2002; 
Pinto et al., 2007; Pinto et al., 2010; Ravindran et al., 2020; Sookman et al., 2005; Starcevic 
& Brakoulias, 2008). The present study examined how social adjustment is associated with 
symptom subtypes of OCD. Consistent with our hypothesis, the results suggest a differential 
impact of OCD symptom subtypes on social adjustment, even when taking into account 
OCD and depression severity. Although individuals with OCD experience poor overall 
social adjustment, not all symptom subtypes are associated with all domains of social 
adjustment.

First, our results show that for individuals with hoarding symptoms, work functioning is 
uniquely impacted, including employment and/or housework. Previous research has shown 
hoarding as uniquely impairing and disabling in various aspects of life (Saxena et al., 2011; 
Schwartzman et al., 2017; Vorstenbosch et al., 2012). Due to these individuals’ inability 
to discard items, their house or workspace might be too cluttered for them to function 
effectively in these spaces, causing significant social and occupational impairment (Saxena 
et al., 2011).

Second, our study shows significant associations between the contamination subtype and 
the marital, extended family, and family unit domains of social functioning. These three 
domains encompass all familial relationships examined in the SAS besides the parental 
domain, which refers to the individuals’ relationship with their children. It implies the 
extent that contamination symptoms can negatively impact familial role functioning. For the 
marital domain, this result is consistent with previous studies showing that contamination 
obsessions negatively impact intimacy and relationship satisfaction (Abbey et al., 2007) and 
sexual functioning (Aksaray, 2001). In general, contamination symptoms often generalize 
across settings increasing overall avoidance and limiting social mobility; compulsive

behaviors of excessive washing and cleaning can be time-consuming and interfere with their 
ability to connect with others (Jacoby et al., 2014). This association between contamination 
symptoms and familial relationships also suggests the importance of considering family 
accommodation. It refers to family members’ assisting or participating in the rituals 
performed by individuals with OCD, and has been shown to be particularly prevalent 
for family members cohabiting with individuals with contamination symptoms since their 
rituals are often excessive and take place at home (Albert et al., 2010; Albert et al., 2017; 
Stewart et al., 2008). Some of these accommodations are daily occurrences (Stewart et 
al., 2008) and require substantial changes in the family’s daily activities, so they often 
create a significant amount of distress in family members (Albert et al., 2010). Research 
has shown that OCD symptom reduction with treatment is significantly associated with 
reduction in family accommodation. Of note, family-based interventions or treatments that 
target reducing family accommodation have shown to be particularly helpful for individuals 
with the contamination subtype of OCD (Lebowitz et al., 2012).

Third, our results show that for individuals with both symmetry and contamination subtypes, 
functioning related to social and leisure activities is impaired. Individuals with these 
symptoms might make attempts to avoid such social and leisure activities altogether, or 
if they do try to engage in them, the possibility of things being out of order and getting 
contaminated makes them anxious. Thus, both their social functioning and satisfaction levels 
would be negatively impacted (Schwartzman et al., 2017). Specifically, for the symmetry/
ordering subtype. Ecker et al. (2013) found strong positive relationship between the OCD 
symptom of ordering and obsessive-compulsive personality traits, incompleteness, and “not 
just right experiences”. The rigid perfectionism embedded in these traits and feelings may 
increase these individuals’ anxiety in social settings (Seretis et al., 2022) and decrease their 
ability to enjoy leisure time.

Lastly, our study shows that the symptom subtypes of doubt/checking and taboo thoughts 
are not associated with impairment in social functioning. Individuals with these symptoms 
might not reveal those intrusive thoughts and routines to others, even those who are close 
family members or friends of theirs. Thus, even though they experience significant distress, 
their role functioning might not be significantly impacted. The results from previous 
research are mixed. Vorstenbosch et al. (2012) found that the subtype of obsessions and 
checking were related to both overall and lifestyle impairment. In contrast, Fontenelle 
et al. (2010) did not find these symptom subtypes to be associated with any functional 
impairment; Albert et al. (2010) also stated that the symptom subtypes of religious, 
sexual, and somatic obsessions and aggressive obsessions and checking compulsions are 
not associated with social functioning or role limitations. This discrepancy might be due to 
the varying measures used and varying ways of deriving symptom subtypes.

This study has several strengths, such as its large sample size and its recruitment from 
various clinics. However, this study also has a few limitations. First, participants are 
predominantly treatment-seeking non-Hispanic White/Caucasian individuals. Thus, the 
results we obtained might not be applicable to non-treatment-seeking or more racially 
diverse groups. Second, our method of categorizing symptoms of OCD into five different 
symptom subtypes has its limitations. These are not mutually exclusive subtypes and an

individual with OCD could endorse symptoms that are present in multiple subtypes. It 
remains unclear if phenotypic categorization (e.g., doubting and checking) is the most 
meaningful way to approach the heterogeneity in OCD or if other classification schemes 
warrant greater consideration (Boisseau et al., 2018). Third, this study only included data 
at intake. It is unclear whether participants’ social adjustment would fluctuate both within 
and across domains over time or in response to treatment. Future research should incorporate 
diverse samples and examine the stability of these social functioning impairments over time, 
in relation to OCD symptom subtypes.

In conclusion, our study shows that different OCD symptom subtypes impact different 
domains of social adjustment. These findings help us further distinguish OCD symptom 
subtypes and their functioning impairments, and highlights the importance of considering 
social impairments when assessing and treating individuals with OCD. They offer important 
implications for the specific social impairment domains to target in treatment for different 
symptom subtypes, instead of the overall social maladjustment. For individuals with 
hoarding symptoms, work functioning should be targeted in treatment. For individuals with 
contamination symptoms, special attention needs to be paid to their family functioning. 
For individuals of both symmetry and contamination subtypes, functioning related to social 
and leisure activities should be prioritized. Thus, enhancing targeted domains of social 
adjustment could potentially lead to more effective treatment plan and symptom reduction.
