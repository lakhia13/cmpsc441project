Abstract

Rationale: Social isolation and loneliness are gaining recognition
for their role in health outcomes, yet they have not been defined
in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Objective: To determine the national prevalence of and
characteristics associated with social isolation and loneliness in
people with COPD.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of community-dwelling
adults aged >50 years in the nationally representative HRS (Health
and Retirement Study) (2016–2018). Participants self-reported COPD
and supplemental oxygen use and were categorized into three
groups: 1) no COPD; 2) COPD; and 3) COPD on oxygen. Social
isolation was defined using a nine-item scale indicating minimal
household contacts, social network interaction, and community
engagement. Loneliness was measured using the 3-Item UCLA
Loneliness Scale. Multivariable logistic regression defined prevalence
and associated characteristics for both.

Results: Participants (n = 10,384) were on average 68 years old
(standard deviation, 610.5), 54% female, 10% Black, 11% self-
reported COPD, and 2% self-reported supplemental oxygen.
Overall, 12% were socially isolated, 12% lonely, and 3% both
socially isolated and lonely. People with COPD had a higher
adjusted prevalence of social isolation (no COPD: 11%; COPD:

16%; COPD on oxygen: 20%; P , 0.05) and loneliness (no
COPD: 11%; COPD: 18%; COPD on oxygen: 22%; P , 0.001). In
those with COPD, characteristics associated with social isolation
(P , 0.05) included sex (men: 22%; women: 13%), non-Hispanic
White ethnicity (White: 19%; Black: 7%), low net worth
(,$6,000: 32%; $81,001–$239,000: 10%), depression (depression:
24%; no depression: 14%), having difficulty with one or more
activities of daily living (one or more difficulty: 22%; no
difficulty: 14%), and current cigarette use (current: 24%; never:
13%). Characteristics associated with loneliness (P , 0.05)
included younger age (50–64 yr: 22%; 75–84 yr: 12%), being
single (single: 32%; married: 12%), depression (depression: 36%;
no depression: 13%), having difficulty with one or more activities
of daily living (one or more difficulty: 29%; no difficulty: 15%),
diabetes (diabetes: 26%; no diabetes: 17%), and heart disease
(heart disease 23%; no heart disease: 17%).

Conclusions: Nearly one in six adults with COPD experience
social isolation, and one in five experience loneliness, with almost
twice the prevalence among those on supplemental oxygen
compared with the general population. Demographic and clinical
characteristics identify those at highest risk to guide clinical and
policy interventions.

Suen, Iyer, Cenzer, et al.: Prevalence of Social Isolation and Loneliness in COPD

1709

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) disproportionately affects older
individuals and is the third leading cause of
death worldwide (1). Social determinants
of health play an important role in COPD
disease outcomes, health-related quality of
life, and healthcare use (2). Social isolation
and loneliness are key social determinants of
health that are gaining increasing recognition
and are linked to poor health outcomes,
including increased incidence of
cardiovascular disease and stroke, poor
disease control, worse functional
impairment, poor outcomes after intensive
care unit (ICU) admissions, and mortality
(3–7). Social isolation is deﬁned as an
objective deﬁcit in the number and frequency
of contacts with family, friends, and
community, whereas loneliness is the
subjective emotional distress that arises from
the feeling that one’s social life is inadequate.
To date, little is known about the
epidemiology of these key markers of social
well-being among persons with COPD.
Notably, prior studies suggest there is a low
correlation between loneliness and social
isolation (r , 0.20), but the correlation
among persons with COPD has not been
investigated (8).

Individuals with COPD may be
uniquely vulnerable to experiencing social
isolation and loneliness and their
downstream health consequences (9). People
with COPD may be more objectively isolated
and lonely because of a high burden of
symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnea, and
depression, as well as disease-related
functional limitations (10). In particular,
supportive therapies, such as supplemental
oxygen, may be stigmatizing and lead to
social withdrawal, shame, physical
inadequacy, and loneliness (8, 11).

It is therefore imperative for clinicians,
researchers, and policymakers to understand
the magnitude of loneliness and social
isolation in COPD. In this study, we used the
nationally representative HRS (Health and
Retirement Study), which includes a
comprehensive description of the health and
social lives of older adults. We had two
primary objectives: 1) to compare the
adjusted prevalence of social isolation and
loneliness in adults aged >50 years between

those with and without COPD, including
those on supplemental oxygen; and 2) to
identify characteristics associated with social
isolation and loneliness among those with
COPD. We hypothesized that adults with
COPD, and particularly those with COPD on
supplemental oxygen, were more likely to
experience social isolation and loneliness
than the general population of U.S. adults.
Some of the results of this study have been
previously reported in the form of an
abstract (12, 13).

Methods

Study Sample
This study uses the HRS, a nationally
representative survey of American adults
aged >50 years conducted biennially until
death. A psychosocial leave-behind
questionnaire (LBQ) that measures
loneliness and social isolation is
administered to alternating halves of the
HRS cohort every 2 years (response rate,
90%) (14). Among the 12,029 participants
from the 2016 and 2018 HRS waves with at
least one response to the LBQ, we excluded
1,645 participants because of incomplete
information on social isolation, loneliness, or
other key covariates, yielding a ﬁnal sample
of 10,384 participants. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board
at the University of Michigan and University
of California, San Francisco.

Exposure
Subjects self-reported COPD with the
question “Has a doctor ever told you that
you have chronic lung disease, such as
chronic bronchitis or emphysema?” as has
been done in prior studies (15). The
prevalence of COPD in our study was
consistent with national prevalence data
using alternative strategies to identify COPD
(16). Self-reported supplemental oxygen use
was identiﬁed with the question “Are you
receiving oxygen for your lung condition?”
We categorized participants into three
groups: 1) no COPD; 2) COPD; and 3)
COPD on oxygen. There were no
participants without COPD who reported
supplemental oxygen use.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH

Outcomes: Social Isolation
and Loneliness
We deﬁned social isolation using a
previously published scale used to study
older adults with serious illness (17). This
social isolation scale includes three subscales
(each scored 0–2) based on the three
dimensions of social isolation strongly
associated with health outcomes: 1)
household and core contacts; 2) social
network interaction; and 3) community
engagement. First, household and core
contacts included marital status, household
size, and having nearby children (,10
miles). People who live alone or are single are
less likely to have access to a daily caregiver
and are at higher risk of mortality and
prolonged nursing home stays after
hospitalizations (18). Second, we measured
social network interaction, which assesses the
frequency of contact with children, family, or
friends through in-person, e-mail, or phone
communication. Social network interaction
reﬂects the web of connections between
relationships and a pathway to the provision
of material and psychosocial support; this
domain has been tied strongly to healthcare
use in prior studies (3, 5). Third, we assessed
community engagement with participation
in religious services, other community
groups, or volunteering. Community
engagement can indicate the level of
integration with one’s local community and
the ability to access local resources of
support; it is associated with reduced
depression, functional decline, and mortality
(19, 20). When combined, the three subscales
create an overall social isolation score (range,
0–6) where ,3 points identiﬁed social
isolation.

We deﬁned loneliness using the widely
used UCLA 3-Item Loneliness Scale which
comprises three questions assessing the
frequency with which participants feel they
lack companionship, are left out, or are
isolated from others (responses: “hardly ever”
[0 points], “some of the time” [1 point], and
“often” [2 points]; overall range, 0–6 points).
We used previously deﬁned cut-offs,
including “occasional loneliness” (>1 point),
and “frequent loneliness” (>4 points), which
corresponds with at least one answer of
“often.” (21) Although even “occasional”
loneliness is associated with poor health

outcomes, we primarily focused on “frequent”
loneliness for this study to identify those at
the highest need of intervention (22).

Covariates
Sociodemographic and health information
included age, sex, education level, race and
ethnicity, net worth, and self-reported
comorbidities (diabetes, cancer, stroke, and
heart disease). We determined the presence
of depressive symptoms using a modiﬁed
center for epidemiologic studies depression
scale (CES-D) (8 items with yes or no
answers, scale 0–8, where >4 indicates
clinically relevant depression) (23, 24).

Statistical Analysis
We ﬁrst compared the national prevalence of
social isolation and loneliness among the
three groups based on COPD status using
Rao-Scott chi-square tests. We then used
logistic regression to determine the adjusted
national prevalence of social isolation and
loneliness for each of the three groups.
We selected clinically meaningful
sociodemographic factors a priori, including
age, sex, race and ethnicity, marital status,
and net worth, which are known to impact
social isolation and loneliness (22, 25, 26).
We removed marital status in the social
isolation analysis, as it is included in the
social isolation scale. We did not adjust for
comorbidities or functional status, as we
conceptualized that these factors were on the
causal pathway between COPD and social
isolation and loneliness (27). Given the
importance of each of the social isolation
subscales to health outcomes as described
above, we used Rao-Scott chi-square tests to
examine the prevalence of each social
isolation subscale by COPD status.

We next used logistic regression within

the subpopulation of participants with
COPD to identify sociodemographic and
health characteristics (after adjusting for age,
sex, race and ethnicity, and net worth)
associated with social isolation and
loneliness. We adjusted for marital status in
loneliness models but not in social isolation
models, as marital status is included in the
social isolation scale. We did not adjust for
multiple comparisons, as the goal of the
analysis was exploratory in nature (28). For
all analyses, we applied survey weights
provided by the HRS to adjust for the
complex survey design and nonresponse to
the core interview and LBQ (29). We
performed statistical analysis using STATA
v.16.1 (30).

Results

National Prevalence Estimates of
Social Isolation and Loneliness
Demographics, health characteristics, and
unadjusted national prevalence estimates of
social isolation, loneliness, or both in our
sample are summarized in Table 1. Of the
10,384 participants, the mean age was 67.9
(610.5) years old. Overall, 54% were female,
10% were African American/Black, and 66%
were married/partnered, with 1,100 (11%)
having COPD (909 [9%] had COPD, and
191 [2%] had COPD on supplemental
oxygen). Those with COPD had a higher
unadjusted prevalence of social isolation
(no COPD: 11%; COPD: 19%; COPD on
oxygen: 26%; P , 0.001) and frequent
loneliness (no COPD: 10%; COPD: 22%;
COPD on oxygen: 29%; P , 0.001).

After multivariable adjustment, both
prevalence estimates remained signiﬁcant
(Figure 1): participants with COPD had a
higher adjusted prevalence of social isolation
(no COPD: 11%; COPD: 16%; COPD with
oxygen: 20%; P , 0.001) and frequent
loneliness (no COPD: 11%; COPD: 18%;
COPD with oxygen: 22%; P , 0.001)
(Figure 1). In addition, persons with COPD
reported higher prevalence of both social
isolation and frequent loneliness (no COPD:
3%; COPD: 6%; COPD with oxygen: 11%;
P , 0.001), although the correlation between
social isolation and loneliness among persons
with COPD was low (r = 0.19).

Social Isolation Subscales
We next examined the social isolation
subscales (Figure 2A). Participants with
COPD and those with COPD on
supplemental oxygen were more likely to be
single (no COPD: 33%; COPD: 47%; COPD
on oxygen: 59%; P , 0.001), live alone
(no COPD: 23%; COPD: 32%; COPD on
oxygen: 35%; P , 0.001), and have minimal
interaction with nonchildren family
(no COPD: 25%; COPD: 30%; COPD on
oxygen: 30%; P = 0.02) and friends
(no COPD: 18%; COPD: 22%; COPD on
oxygen: 34%; P , 0.001). Persons with
COPD were more likely to report no
volunteer work in the last 12 months
(no COPD: 59%; COPD: 74%; COPD on
oxygen: 84%; P , 0.001), no religious service
attendance in the last 12 months (no COPD:
30%; COPD: 42%; COPD on oxygen: 45%;
P , 0.001), and less than monthly
participation in community groups

(no COPD: 56%; COPD: 69%; COPD on
oxygen: 78%; P , 0.001). However, persons
with COPD were more likely to live near
their children (no COPD: 41%; COPD: 48%;
COPD on oxygen: 58%; P , 0.001). Social
interaction subscales are summarized in
Table E1 in the data supplement.

Clinical Characteristics Associated
with Social Isolation and Loneliness
Within the sample of persons with COPD
(n = 1,100), characteristics associated with
social isolation after adjustment included
male sex (men: 22%; women: 13%;
P , 0.001), self-reported non-Hispanic
White ethnicity (White: 19%; Latinx: 15%;
Black: 7%; P , 0.001), low net worth
(,$6,000: 32%; $6,001–$81,000: 28%;
$81,001–$239,000: 10%; .$239,000: 12%;
P , 0.001), depression (depression: 24%; no
depression: 14%; P = 0.005), having difﬁculty
with one or more activities of daily living
(ADLs) (one or more difﬁculty: 22%; no
difﬁculty: 14%; P = 0.033), and current
cigarette use (current: 24%; former: 14%;
never: 13%; P = 0.01) (Figure 3A).
Characteristics independently associated
with frequent loneliness in participants with
COPD after adjustment included younger
age (50–64 yr: 22%; 65–74 yr: 19%; 75–84 yr:
12%, 85–102 yr: 10%; P , 0.005), being
single (single: 32%; married: 13%; P , 0.001),
depression (depression: 36%; no depression:
13%; P , 0.001), having difﬁculty with one
or more ADL (one or more difﬁculty: 29%;
no difﬁculty: 15%; P = 0.001), and having
diabetes (diabetes: 26%; no diabetes: 17%;
P = 0.012) and heart disease (heart disease:
23%; no heart disease: 17%; P = 0.023)
(Figure 3B).

Discussion

In a nationally representative sample, one in
six people with COPD experienced social
isolation, and one in ﬁve experienced
frequent loneliness. In particular, among
those with COPD on supplemental oxygen,
the prevalence of social isolation and
frequent loneliness was almost double that of
the general population, suggesting that this
group is particularly vulnerable (22, 31, 32).
Consequently, our study demonstrates the
substantial and underrecognized problem of
social isolation and loneliness in COPD, and
the key demographic and clinical
characteristics that we identiﬁed can guide
the design of interventions that promote

Figure 1. The adjusted prevalence of social isolation, frequent loneliness, and both social isolation and frequent loneliness by chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status. Rates represent the model-based probabilities adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, marital
status, and net worth. Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals. All displayed comparisons reached a significance threshold of
P , 0.05. P values represent the overall association across COPD groups with social isolation, loneliness, or both in multiple logistic regression
models using joint Wald tests. Social isolation was defined with a score <2. Frequent loneliness is defined using the validated 3-Item UCLA
Loneliness Scale, where a score of >4 indicates frequent loneliness. COPD and oxygen use are self-reported.

The high prevalence of social isolation is

We found that the high prevalence of

striking, as we used a relatively strict
deﬁnition that takes into account how social
networks tend to constrict with age and
serious illness (socioemotional selectivity
theory) (33). Our analysis of social isolation
subscales revealed that the primary drivers of
social isolation included a substantially
higher prevalence of being unmarried, living
alone, having less than monthly social
interaction with friends, and reduced or
nearly nonexistent community engagement.
This is consistent with prior qualitative
studies in which people with COPD describe
the disease restricting their social activities
and physical movement inside and outside
the home because of debilitating symptoms
and reduced functional status (34).
Subgroups associated with social isolation
identiﬁed by our study and consistent with
prior literature included individuals
reporting male sex, lower socioeconomic
status, depression symptoms, any difﬁculty
with ADLs, and current cigarette use (20, 25,
35, 36). Social isolation is known to be
strongly associated with numerous poor
health outcomes in the general U.S.
population and uniquely among persons
with COPD may be tied to acute COPD
exacerbations, worsening health-related

loneliness in people with COPD was similar
to a study of individuals with other serious
illnesses or the end of life (17). In contrast to
prior literature, we found middle-aged adults
(50–65 yr old) had a higher prevalence of
loneliness than older adults (25% vs. 16%).
Potential explanations include physical
limitations or symptoms interfering with the
ability to work or participate in activities with
similar-aged peers. Alternatively, middle-
aged adults with COPD may experience
heightened feelings of stigma and shame.
Additional characteristics associated with
loneliness and aligned with prior literature
included low socioeconomic status,
depression symptoms, and difﬁculties with
ADLs (22, 40). Our deﬁnition of “frequent”
loneliness indicates a high level of emotional
distress and difﬁculty coping. Loneliness has
been further linked to cognitive and
functional decline, as well as increased
depression and anxiety. These factors may
contribute to poor health outcomes and
health-related quality of life among persons
with COPD (22, 41, 42).

As hypothesized, supplemental oxygen
use was associated with a signiﬁcantly higher
frequency of social isolation and loneliness
among people with COPD compared with

the general population. Consequently,
supplemental oxygen is a signiﬁcant marker
that has both clinical and socially signiﬁcant
ramiﬁcations, either as a reﬂection of
worsening disease status or as a direct
consequence of supplemental oxygen.
Although studies have demonstrated
increased survival and improved health-
related quality of life in certain subgroups of
people with COPD who use oxygen (43–45),
our study raises a level of caution on the
potentially socially harmful tradeoffs that
supplemental oxygen can unwittingly
impose, especially for older adults. It may be
stigmatizing to carry oxygen and lead to
perceptions of weakness or frailty
(11, 34, 46, 47). Supplemental oxygen tanks,
the mainstay for oxygen therapy when
leaving the home, are heavy and often
difﬁcult to carry; patients report heightened
fear of tripping and falling over the oxygen
tubing or tank (46, 48, 49). Researchers
should develop more portable and
lightweight supplemental oxygen delivery
methods, and policymakers should expand
Medicare coverage for modalities that are
safe, easy to carry, and promote functional
independence, such as portable oxygen
concentrators, which are currently too
expensive for most, and liquid oxygen, which
has virtually disappeared from the market
because of competitive bidding (50). In

addition, those with COPD on supplemental
oxygen have higher symptom burden and
consequently may beneﬁt from proactive
referral to specialist palliative care; clinicians
should further consider using oxygen
initiation to trigger conversations about
social well-being (51).

Our study has several additional
implications for clinical practice and policy.

Clinicians and their clinical teams should
consider using validated screening tools to
screen for social isolation and loneliness as
part of their routine management in COPD
(52, 53). COPD is a chronic disease with slow
progression over time, and people living with
COPD have described a coping strategy of
normalization (34); consequently, it is
important for clinicians not to assume who is

or is not lonely or isolated. Given the current
timing constraints on clinicians, studies are
needed to identify evidence-based screening
practices by different members of clinical
teams and health systems.

Once identiﬁed, we suggest an
individualized approach based on each
patient’s unique needs. This is an active area
of research, and further studies are needed of

evidence-based interventions to address
social isolation and loneliness for persons
with COPD. Clinical frameworks exist and
consider the need to partner with
interdisciplinary teams (such as mental
health, social work, and case management),
given the time and complex nature of
addressing social needs (54–56). Awareness
of modiﬁable clinical risk factors, such as
treating depression and providing digital
technology devices, assistive therapies
such as walkers, and hearing or visual aids,
can optimize a patient’s ability to be
socially connected (57). Pulmonary
rehabilitation, an evidence-based program
that helps people with COPD to self-
manage dyspnea symptoms, may improve
exercise capacity and facilitate active
social participation.

Clinicians should understand how
social isolation and loneliness may be deeply
intertwined with symptoms of dyspnea, pain,
and fatigue and consider using social
interventions to supplement traditional
pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic
approaches to symptom management (42).
Moreover, given the risk of ICU-level care
among persons with COPD, early
identiﬁcation of healthcare proxies and
potential caregivers for socially isolated
adults with COPD should be a high priority.

Policymakers should consider sustained

funding for programs addressing isolation
and loneliness among persons with COPD
who have a harder time accessing healthcare
or leaving their home (57). Examples include
expanded access to virtual clinic visits and
virtual pulmonary rehabilitation, provision
of cell phones, internet, and teleconferencing
tools, and social support programs that
provide transportation or go to one’s home.
No ﬁnancial structure currently exists
wherein healthcare professionals are
compensated to address social determinants
of health. Efforts to improve reimbursement
for addressing social needs are therefore
needed (58).

Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First,
COPD and supplemental oxygen use were
self-reported. Previous studies suggest
self-reported COPD has high speciﬁcity but
may miss individuals with undiagnosed
COPD based on pulmonary function tests
(59). Reassuringly, our study prevalence of
approximately 11% is consistent with other
reported national prevalence estimates for
this age group (16). Second, we do not have
pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas
data, or more information about the
frequency or timing of oxygen use to

ORIGINAL RESEARCH

understand the severity of COPD or
cooccurring conditions necessitating
long-term oxygen therapy. Third, our data
are cross-sectional, and our ability to
determine causality is limited. Last, there
may be selection effects in response to the
HRS and LBQ. A comparison of responders
and nonresponders to the LBQ showed
similar demographic and clinical
characteristics and small differences by
race/ethnicity and education; we addressed
these differences using survey weights that
account for nonresponse and covariate
adjustment. Nevertheless, use of survey
weights may not completely mitigate
nonresponse bias among individuals with
advanced disease or functional impairments
preventing study participation.

Conclusions
Our nationally representative study
demonstrates that people living with COPD,
especially those on supplemental oxygen,
experience a high prevalence of social isolation
and loneliness. Identifying and addressing
these social needs represents a critical
opportunity to improve social well-being and
health outcomes in this population. (cid:1)
