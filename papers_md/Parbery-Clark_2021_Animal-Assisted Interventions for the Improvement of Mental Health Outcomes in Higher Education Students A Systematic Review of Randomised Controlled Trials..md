Abstract: Background: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of
Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAIs), particularly Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) and Animal-
Assisted Activity (AAA), in improving mental health outcomes for students in higher education. The
number of students in higher education reporting mental health problems and seeking support from
universities’ student support services has risen over recent years. Therefore, providing engaging
interventions, such as AAIs, that are accessible to large groups of students are attractive. Methods:
MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched from relative inception to end
of April 2020. Additionally, a grey literature search was undertaken. Independent screening, data
extraction and risk of bias assessment were completed, with varying percentages, by two reviewers.
Results: After de-duplication, 6248 articles were identiﬁed of which 11 studies were included in
the narrative synthesis. The evidence from randomised controlled trials suggests that AAIs could
provide short-term beneﬁcial results for anxiety in students attending higher education but with
limited evidence for stress, and inconclusive evidence for depression, well-being and mood. For the
non-statistically signiﬁcant results, the studies either did not include a power calculation or were
under-powered. Conclusions: Potential emerging evidence for the short-term beneﬁts of AAI for
anxiety, and possibly stress, for students in higher education was found.

1. Introduction

Attending higher education commonly represents a major life transition for young
people, with it often being the ﬁrst time living away from the family home, which can bring
social, ﬁnancial and academic stressors [1,2]. The true prevalence of mental health problems
for students in higher education is hard to estimate accurately. For example, in the UK, there
is a scarcity of large-scale studies being truly representative of the UK student population
in higher education or applying a weighted adjustment to accommodate for the lack of
representativity [3,4]. However, the number of students in higher education disclosing
mental health problems and accessing higher education institutions’ (HEI) support services
has risen in recent years [1]. Disclosure and requesting support can result in long waiting
lists for more traditional individualised therapy sessions, while stigma around seeking
help for mental health and well-being is still present [5,6]. Therefore, a possible solution
may be the provision of interventions aimed at reducing stress and anxiety as well as
boosting mental health and well-being that are appealing, effective, and accessible to large
groups of students [6]. In this respect, part of the solution could be Animal Assisted
Interventions (AAIs).

AAI is an umbrella term that describes the use of various animal species in numer-
ous ways that are beneﬁcial to humans, and includes Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT),
Animal-Assisted Education (AAE), Animal-Assisted Activity (AAA) and more recently,
Animal-Assisted Coaching (AAC) [7–9]. In summary, AAT is a structured and goal-directed
intervention with a speciﬁcally trained live animal and is designed to ameliorate socio-
emotional, behavioural, cognitive and/or physical functioning [7,8]. AAA is a planned
informal interaction with human-animal teams for recreational, motivational and educa-
tional opportunities [7,8]. AAE, similarly structured to AAT, focuses on speciﬁc educational
or academic goals with a professional trained in, and with expertise, in education or a
similar ﬁeld [7,8]. AAC is also similarly structured to AAT and AAE but delivered by
licensed coaches focusing on personal growth [8]. AAIs’ popularity have risen over recent
years, and they are used in diverse settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools and
universities [10–14]. Positive interactions with animals have been shown to have beneﬁcial
human physiological responses, such as reduction in heart rate, blood pressure, stress hor-
mones (for example, cortisol), and increase in hormones associated with positive emotions
(for example, oxytocin) [15–18]. Evidence has emerged that AAIs, particularly AAT, may
be effective in treating various mental health conditions (such as schizophrenia, depression
and drug/alcohol addiction), developmental disorders (such as autism-spectrum disorder)
and depressive symptoms in individuals with certain neurological conditions (such as
dementia) [10,11,14,19]. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis, involving both children and
adults, demonstrated statistically signiﬁcant improvements in heart rate, self-reported
anxiety and stress, but not blood pressure, after AAIs [20]. The discrepancies in ﬁndings
related to BP may be due to psychological arousal and do not necessarily contradict the
stress relieving effects [21].

There are numerous theories of why and how AAIs may work. For example,
Crossman et al. [6] suggests various theories for how animals may reduce stress including:
•
•
•

emotional contagion (transmitting the animal’s positive emotions onto humans)
facilitating social interaction
opportunities for reinforcement (by partaking in pleasurable activities and experienc-
ing positive emotions)
evoking expectations that participation will reduce stress (expectancy that the inter-
vention will work)

•

Beck [22] describes that the human–animal bond is rooted in evolutionary as well as
physiological and psychological processes with signiﬁcant health beneﬁts for both humans
and animals. Furthermore, the importance, in the psychosocial model, of social support for
health and how social support can function as a buffer against stress are also relevant [23,24].
The animal–human bond can be considered as a type of social relationship, which can offer
this type of support. Some individuals may form an animal–human bond more readily than
a human-human bond as animals are considered to be indifferent and non-judgemental to
an individual’s appearance, social skills or socioeconomic status (SES) [25]. Furthermore,
the Biophilia Theory proposes that humans are drawn to interact with animals due to an
innate desire to connect with living organisms and nature [25,26]. Additionally, distraction
as a cognitive refocus may also contribute, though this research has mostly focused on
anxiety and pain whilst awaiting or receiving medical treatment [27].

Interestingly, the prevalence of programmes using AAIs at HEIs has increased, for
example by 2015 over 900 existed in the USA [6]. In the UK, these types of programmes
have also risen in popularity with various forms being implemented, ranging from one-
day events to speciﬁc sessions [28–32]. Additionally, the evidence-base for using AAIs
with this population is growing with persuasive descriptive and anecdotal reports of the
beneﬁts [2,6,33,34]. Over recent years, more randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been
published, evaluating the effectiveness of AAIs in respect of various outcomes for students
in higher education [35–37]. Nonetheless, a lack of completed systematic reviews for AAIs
and this speciﬁc population exists. Therefore, to our knowledge, no completed systematic
reviews were identiﬁed that primarily evaluate the effectiveness of AAIs, particularly AAT

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 10768

and AAA, delivered in multiple or single sessions, in improving mental health outcomes
for students in higher education, with no age or course restrictions. This systematic
review addresses this gap in the literature to help inform HEI providers regarding the
potential beneﬁts of AAIs for students’ mental health and well-being, as well as to provide
recommendations for future policy, practices and research.

2. Aim and Objectives

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of AAIs, particu-
larly AAT and AAA, in improving mental health outcomes for students in higher education.

The objectives were to:

•

•

systematically search and critically appraise the relevant published and unpublished
literature on the effectiveness of AAIs, particularly AAT and AAA, in improving
mental health outcomes for this particular population.
provide evidenced-based recommendations for policy, practice and further research.

3. Methods
3.1. Protocol and Ethics

A scoping review deﬁned the focus of this systematic review by identifying gaps in
the literature. This included searches for published literature in MEDLINE, The Cochrane
Library, PsychINFO and Campbell Collaboration, as well as PROSPERO and Joanna Briggs
Institute’s Systematic Review Register. The protocol for this systematic review was peer-
reviewed and registered on the PROSPERO database on 25 June 2020 (registration number
CRD42020186541) [38]. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed [39]. Ethics approval was not required.

3.2. Search Strategy

The search strategy was independently peer-reviewed by both an information spe-
cialist and an experienced librarian at Newcastle University. The full search strategies are
included in Appendix A. The search strategies were not limited by year, study design,
language or publication status. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and Cochrane Library
with inclusion of Central Register of Controlled Trials CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Clinical Answers were searched from their relative
inception to week three of April/week commencing 27 April 2020. Additionally, an Ad-
vanced Google search, using the ﬁrst four pages due to Google sorting by relevance, during
the week ending the 1 May 2020, as well as a further search in the PROSPERO database
were completed. To identify additional studies, the reference lists of all full manuscripts
meeting eligibility criteria and a “cited in” search using Science Citation Index/Science
Citation Index Expanded via Web of Science were reviewed.

3.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

A description of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, according to PICOS (Population,
Intervention, Comparator, Outcome and Study design), has been provided below and
summarised in Table 1 [40]. During study selection, no restrictions for study geographical
location, date or language were applied.

and well-being.

Population:
Students who all have an established diagnosed
condition/disorder (such as autism or ADHD).
Rationale: could substantially affect the clinical heterogeneity of
the populations being compared.

Intervention:
Not involving a live animal.
Rationale: AAIs involve live animals.
Participants’ own

Rationale: Likely to represent potential confounders/effect
modiﬁers and not consistent with deﬁnitions of AAI, AAT
or AAA.

Comparator:

Rationale: RCT represents gold standard for
measuring effectiveness.

Study: all non-randomised.
Rationale: prone to effects of confounding & to ensure feasibility
of review due to time/resources constraints.

The population was students in higher education with no age, course or location
restrictions. Higher education was operationalised as delivered beyond secondary school
leading to a degree [46]. Studies that only included students with an already established
diagnosis were excluded, as this would have substantially affected the clinical heterogeneity
of the studies being compared. Consequently, the intervention’s true effect might have been
affected by differences in the population and not the intervention itself, thereby potentially
compromising the generalisability of the results [40].

Differences regarding the deﬁnitions, corresponding terminology and operating prac-
tices of the various types of AAIs can lead to difﬁculties assessing and comparing the
interventions [7–9,47–49]. AAA and AAT are often used interchangeably in the litera-
ture, leading to ambiguity [12,49]. To overcome these identiﬁed discrepancies, both AAT
and AAA were included. The deﬁnitions provided by the International Association of
Human-Animal Interaction Organisations (IAHAIO) and the American Veterinary Medical
Association (AVMA) to classify the various types of AAI were used [7,8]. In summary,
AAT involves a speciﬁcally trained live animal in a planned, structured and goal-directed
intervention, designed to improve socio-emotional, physical, behavioural and/or cognitive
functioning of the individual(s) as part of the treatment process [7,8]. AAT is delivered
and/or directed by a trained human professional (from education, health or human ser-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 10768

vices) with speciﬁc expertise, and progress is measured/evaluated [7,8]. AAA is a planned
informal interaction with trained animal-human teams for recreational, motivational and
educational opportunities [7,8]. For the purposes of this systematic review, in accordance
with IAHAIO, AAA is goal-orientated [8]. It was anticipated that studies might provide
insufﬁcient detail to objectively assess and classify the type of intervention (for example
to distinguish clearly between AAT and AAA). Consequently, studies were included if
the live animal was called/considered a therapy animal, a therapeutic aim/goal was iden-
tiﬁed, and the outcomes of interests were evaluated. If the term “therapy animal” had
not been used, the authors had to explicitly mention that the animal had, at least, had
introductory training and an assessment/evaluation [8,9]. If the intervention was part of
a multi-component programme, isolating the effectiveness of the AAT/AAA had to be
possible; otherwise, the study was excluded. Additionally, if a study used a stressor, the
stressor had to be an aspect of study, training, education or be student speciﬁc. An exam or
an experimental cognitive test that was used to emulate evaluative testing are examples of
included stressors.

Any type of comparator was included, including active intervention, attention control,
placebo/sham therapy, usual care/treatment as usual, or alternative active intervention. If
there was more than one comparator, one was chosen according to a hierarchy that was
established to assess the intervention’s effectiveness [40,50]:

control (no-treatment, attention, usual care, or wait-list)
validated sham treatment (where known not to be efﬁcacious)
other active intervention with known efﬁcacy
sham/alternative treatments (where efﬁcacy is unknown)

Speciﬁc psychological mental health outcomes, assessed using various established or
published standardised measures, before and after the intervention were included. The
primary outcomes of effect focused on anxiety and/or stress, using a range of established or
published standardised measures, including but not limited to, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)
or State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [51,52]. These outcomes were chosen as students
in higher education may experience a signiﬁcant amount of stress [6,53–55]. Additionally,
anxiety can occur as a reaction to stress, with stress and anxiety being closely linked [56].
Differences in anxiety and/or stress scores from baseline pre-intervention to directly post-
intervention and/or ﬁnal follow-up were included. Secondary outcomes of effect focused
on mood/affect, depression and well-being, using a range of published or established
standardised measures, including but not limited to, Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well-
being Scale (WEMWBS) or Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) [57,58]. The
time-point considered to have the biggest potential health beneﬁt was considered as the
time-point immediately after the intervention. Thereafter, the next best alternative was the
time-point closest to the end of the intervention.

RCTs represent the gold standard for measuring an intervention’s effectiveness with
high internal validity [59,60]. Therefore, only RCTs were included. Studies were excluded
if allocation to the respective groups was not objectively randomised, for example if
randomisation was according to participants’ availability, student number or date of birth
with no random component. Any pilot/exploratory studies that met all inclusion criteria
and analysed the outcomes of interest were included, unless the full RCT had been reported.

3.4. Study Selection

Following the electronic database and grey literature searches, titles and abstracts
(n = 8036) were de-duplicated. The remaining titles and abstracts (n = 6248) were cautiously
screened for relevance, erring on over-inclusivity, by the ﬁrst author (CPC) in Rayyan to
remove obvious irrelevant studies or duplicated studies not identiﬁed by the automated
systems [40,61]. Subsequently, 100% of the articles that were deemed potentially relevant
(n = 928), were reviewed independently by two reviewers (CPC and ML, a fellow Master’s
student) against the pre-speciﬁed eligibility criteria using Rayyan [61]. 132 articles were
identiﬁed as requiring full manuscript review, which was undertaken in full by CPC

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 10768

6 of 43

and 20% by ML, both blinded to the other’s decisions. To identify a random 20% for
ML, the titles were arranged alphabetically in Endnote. Subsequently, a random number
(n = 114) was generated by a true random number generator website [62]. Every ﬁfth
article (as 20%) was chosen starting from the 114th article. If any discrepancies arose at
any stage, discussion occurred between the two reviewers. If consensus was not achieved,
agreement was obtained by discussing with a third reviewer (EM). If the full manuscripts
were not available, title/abstract/keywords were reviewed. To meet the eligibility criteria
to request an inter-library loan, at least three elements of the PICOS criteria had to be
fulﬁlled. Keywords were identiﬁed from Rayyan, Endnote and MeSH analyser [61,63,64].

3.5. Data Extraction

A structured Microsoft Excel data extraction form was adapted with permission of
Dr. C Marshall after being piloted with two studies. The TIDieR checklist was incorporated
as AAI is a complex intervention [65]. The data extraction form included [13,66]:
•
•
•

study characteristics (such as design, setting and country)
participants (including eligibility criteria, age, gender, and type of student)
interventions (for example single/multiple sessions, species of animal, if handler
present, duration and frequency of sessions as well as length of programme)
outcomes (such as the relevant measures used, interpretation, results and time-points
for measurements)

•

Data extraction with rigorous double-checking was primarily undertaken by CPC.
ML independently data extracted 18% (n = 2 out of 11). The same previously described
strategy for addressing disagreements was followed, as required.

3.6. Risk of Bias Assessment and Strength of Evidence

A validated tool, Risk of Bias 2.0-revised (RoB2) for individually randomised parallel-
group trials, was used for the risk of bias assessment [67]. As this systematic review was
aimed to inform a health policy question, the effect of interest was the effect of assignment
to AAIs [68]. For each study that reported more than one of the relevant primary or
secondary outcomes, a risk of bias assessment was completed for each relevant outcome.
For each study that reported multiple time-points for the assessment of outcomes or had
more than one comparator, one time-point and one comparator were chosen according
to the hierarchies previously described. Where the RoB2 guidance did not cover speciﬁc
situations found in this review, decision rules were developed and applied in a standardised
manner (Appendix B). The RoB2 assessment was completed in full by CPC with 18% (n = 2)
undertaken independently by ML. The same previously described strategy for addressing
disagreements was followed. Authors were contacted to request clariﬁcations or to access
missing data and given a two-week period to reply.

A narrative synthesis based on the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)
Methods Programme was planned [69]. Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to all
studies being at high risk of bias for the outcomes of interest, with most having high or
some concerns regarding missing data, alongside the substantial clinical heterogeneity.
Since meta-analysis was judged to be inappropriate, a harvest plot using vote counting,
based on direction of effect, was used with categorisation of the studies by their effect
(detrimental, no or beneﬁcial effect) [40]. Effect size or statistical signiﬁcance were not
included for this categorisation as this can be misleading [40]. Vote counting was used for
both the primary and secondary outcomes using mean change score for one comparator
and one time-point according to the hierarchy previously described. If the outcomes were
measured immediately after the intervention, as well as, at an additional time with a
stressor, the former was only included for the vote counting. A set of decision criteria were
created for interventions with a stressor and those without to standardise interpretation of
the expected response to the intervention (Appendix B).

The quality and relevance of evidence was appraised using the ’Weight of Evidence’
approach [70] and described in the guidance on narrative synthesis for the ESRC guid-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 10768

ance [69]. In accordance with the ESRC guidance, trustworthiness was measured by Jadad’s
scale [69,71].

4. Results
4.1. Study Selection

Eleven articles, describing eleven studies, met the inclusion criteria. The PRISMA
ﬂowchart is displayed in Figure 1. Ten studies were journal articles and therefore classed
as published literature [35,37,72–79]. One study was a dissertation for partial fulﬁlment
of PhD and classed as grey literature [80]. All 11 studies were individually randomised
parallel-group trials. Of these, three were described as pilot or exploratory studies but
nonetheless presented data on interventions’ effectiveness [37,75,80]. The excluded full
text published studies (with reasons) are listed in Appendix C.

4.2. Study Characteristics

Six studies were conducted in USA [72,75–77,79,80], three in Canada [35,73,78], one
in Scotland [37], and one in Austria [74]. Sample sizes (for those randomised) across all
included studies varied from 20 to 357 students.

4.2.1. Population

For the majority (9 studies), the participants were university students [35,37,72,73,76–80].
Seven studies
reported the characteristics according to the recruited sample
size [35,37,72,73,76,77,80] and three for the analysed sample size [74,78,79]; one reported the
characteristics of the students attending the degree programme from which the participants
were recruited and not the sample’s characteristics (this study is excluded from the descrip-
tive statistics below) [75]. Ten studies reported gender with the majority (ranging from 57%

Effect size or statistical significance were not included for this categorisation as this can be misleading [40]. Vote counting was used for both the primary and secondary outcomes using mean change score for one comparator and one time-point according to the hierarchy previously described.

A set of decision criteria were created for interventions with a stressor and those without to standardise interpretation of the expected response to the intervention (Appendix B). The Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (EPPI) approach was implemented to assess strength of evidence as described in the ESRC Guidance [69,70].

to 85%) of participants being female [35,37,72–74,76–80]. The most common age bracket
was 20-year-olds and under, followed by 21 to 25-year-olds. Type of student was clearly
reported in ﬁve studies [35,73,76,77,79]. Of those, 80% were undergraduates [35,73,76,77].
The students’ year of academic studies was fully reported in two studies [35,74]. Five
studies reported ethnicity [35,73,76,77,80]. None of the studies reported health status or
socio-economic status (SES). The participants studied a range of course subjects (such as
psychology and nursing). Three studies collected the potential confounder of pet owner-
ship [37,72,78], and one reported experience with the animals employed in the intervention
(horses) [80].

4.2.2. Intervention

Ten studies employed dogs [35,37,72–79] and one employed horses [80]. Group ses-
sions were the most common format:
seven studies implemented this session
type [35,37,72,74,76–78], whilst two implemented individual sessions [73,80]. A further
two studies implemented either a combination of group and individual sessions [75] or
the format of sessions was not clearly reported [79]. The student to dog ratio in the group
sessions was clearly reported in two studies [35,37] and implied in three [74,76,77], ranging
from 3 to 4-students-per-dog to 12 to 14-students-per-dog.

animals [35,37,72,73,75–79] and two used a structured format [74,80]. Most interventions
(n = 8) corresponded to the deﬁnition of AAA described in 3.3 [37,72,73,75–79]. Two studies
were classiﬁed as AAT [35,74] and one combined AAT and AAE together [80]. These classi-
ﬁcations were mostly from an objective assessment of the description provided vis-à-vis the
deﬁnitions outlined in 3.3. If insufﬁcient detail for an objective assessment, the classiﬁcation
used by the primary authors was kept [35]. Length of intervention ranged from unspec-
iﬁed to 90 min, with the modal length being between 10 to 20 min. Seven studies used
a single session [35,37,72,73,78–80]. Four studies used multiple sessions [74–77]; of these,
two used once-weekly sessions for four weeks [76,77]; one implemented three sessions
with non-reporting of the time interval between sessions [74]; and one allowed various
lengths and frequencies over a 15 to 16-week period at the participant’s choice [75]. None
of the studies reported monitoring or measuring the intervention’s ﬁdelity. The theoretical
frameworks were clearly stated in three studies [35,37,80]. More information regarding the
theoretical frameworks is included in Appendix D.

4.2.3. Outcomes

The primary outcomes were self-reported anxiety and stress measured before and
after the intervention. Seven studies measured self-reported anxiety [37,74–77,79,80] with
most using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), apart from one study which used the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [75]. Two studies measured stress using
the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) on the original 5-point Likert scale [35,78].

Regarding the secondary outcomes, two studies measured depression [75,77] using
the HADS-depression subscale and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI II), respectively. Five
studies measured mood/affect, with most using Positive and Negative Affect Schedule
(PANAS) [72,73,76,78] and one used the University of Wales Institute of Science and
Technology Mood Adjective Checklist (UMACL) [37]. Well-being was measured in three
studies [35,37,78] using various tools.

The timing of outcome measurement after the intervention varied substantially be-
tween studies (with some reporting multiple time-points outlined in Table 2) and encom-
passed: immediately after the intervention without a stressor (n = 6); after the intervention
but before an exam (n = 2); after the intervention and an experimental stressor (n = 4);
within 24 h of the intervention (n = 1); 2 weeks after the intervention (n = 1); up to 1 month
after the intervention (n = 1); up to 15–16 weeks since the start of the intervention (n = 1).

Regarding adverse events reporting, Hall [75] described ten individuals who reported
increased anxiety and stress due to being in the control group and unable to participate
with the animal. These participants were subsequently removed from the study to allow
interaction. No other adverse events were reported. None of the studies speciﬁcally
reported any adverse events for the animals involved.
Characteristics are summarised in Table 2.

4.3. Risk of Bias Assessment

Figure 2 summarises the risk of bias for each domain with an overall assessment for
each study for all the relevant outcomes. All studies were at overall high risk of bias for
the outcomes of interest as susceptible to high risk of bias in the domain “measurement of
the outcome”. This was mainly due to the nature of the intervention as participants could
not be blinded and the measures were self-reported, therefore were not objective.

4.4. Strength of Evidence

The quality and relevance of evidence was appraised using the ’Weight of Evidence’
approach [70] and described in the guidance on narrative synthesis for the ESRC guid-
ance [69]. The strength of evidence of the included studies is summarised in Table 3. One
study had high overall weight [74], eight [35,37,73,75,76,78–80] had medium overall weight
and two had low overall weight [72,77].

4.5. Narrative Synthesis: Interventions’ Effect

As all the studies were at high risk of bias for the outcomes of interest, with most
having high or some concerns regarding missing data, alongside the substantial clinical
heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not appropriate as it was unlikely to provide meaningful
results.

All the included measurement scales provided continuous data; results were presented
in various formats such as pre- and post-values, mean change or adjusted estimates of
the intervention’s effects (for example, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with
baseline measurements included as a covariate). Appendix D provides a summary of the
studies’ results with mean change (post-scores minus pre-scores) as the common parameter
using the most immediate measurement of outcomes after the intervention (or the next
best alternative).

levels [37,74–77,79,80]. Six studies employed dogs [37,74–77,79] and one employed horses [80].
Four studies used group sessions [37,74,76,77], one used individual sessions [80], one offered
both group and individual sessions [75] and one did not explicitly state the type of sessions
but was inferred to be individual [79]. Session length varied and included student’s choice
to sessions lasting 12, 20 and up to 60 min. Three studies offered a single session [37,79,80],
two offered four sessions (once/week) [76,77], one varied depending on students’ choice [75]
and one offered three consecutive sessions but did not report the time interval between
sessions [74]. Most interventions were consistent with AAA [37,75–77,79] and of these studies
(n = 5), two included, alongside the dogs, interactive games, icebreakers and snacks for
the participants/dogs [76,77]. Furthermore, Gebhart et al. [74] offered AAT and Meola [80]
offered tailored and structured individual sessions called equine-assisted learning supervision
(EALS). The latter incorporated both educational and therapeutic goals, therefore combining
AAE and AAT.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 10768

Six studies tested outcomes without a stressor, with four showing a statistically signif-
icant improvement in favour of the AAI [37,74,75,77]. Four studies tested the outcomes
immediately after the intervention without a stressor, with three showing a statistically
signiﬁcant reduction in favour of the AAI [37,74,77] and one showing a non-statistically
signiﬁcant reduction but did not include a power calculation [76]. For the two studies
which tested the outcome after a longer time interval, Meola [80] found a non-statistically
signiﬁcant reduction in anxiety when measured up to one month after the intervention but
this study was under-powered. Hall [75] found a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in the
post-intervention scores 15–16 weeks after the intervention had started.

Four studies involved a stressor: two assessed the outcomes after the intervention but
prior to an exam [74,79] and two assessed the outcomes after an experimental cognitive test
(WAIS-IV IQ test) which was designed to imitate evaluative testing that occurs in higher
education [76,77]. Two studies found no statistical difference [74,77] but a power calculation
was not included. Hunt et al. [76], despite no signiﬁcant effect of condition on anxiety
after a stressor, still undertook paired comparisons which showed a statistically signiﬁcant
higher level of anxiety in the AAI group compared to the control group. Williams et al. [79]
showed an increase in anxiety for both groups, after the intervention but before an exam,
which one might therefore expect. However, the control group had statistically higher
anxiety levels than the AAI group.

Overall risk of bias was high for all seven studies regarding the outcomes of interest.
Regarding overall strength of evidence, one study had high [74], one had low [77] and the
remaining ﬁve had medium strength. Using vote counting, according to direction of effect
and not statistical signiﬁcance as described in the methods, all seven studies showed a
beneﬁcial effect in favour of the intervention compared to the comparator (demonstrated
in harvest plot in Figure 3).

4.5.2. Primary Outcome: Stress

Two studies, using single group sessions with dogs, measured self-reported
stress [35,78]. Binfet [35] described the intervention as AAT whilst the intervention in
Ward-Grifﬁn et al. [78] was consistent with AAA. The sessions lasted varying amounts of
time from 20 min [35] to up to 90 min (but on average 30 min) [78]. Neither study used a
stressor but one study [78] occurred during mid-term exam season. Despite the differences
between the two studies, both showed a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in stress when
measured within 24 h of the intervention. This effect was not sustained at the two-week
follow-up for the one study that included longer follow-up [35]. Therefore, these studies
showed cautious preliminary evidence of a short-term, statistically signiﬁcant, beneﬁcial
effect on stress, using AAIs, with students at Canadian universities. However, with such a
small number of studies (with both being at high risk of bias for the outcomes of interest),
caution is needed regarding generalisability to other countries and settings.

4.5.3. Secondary Outcomes: Depression, Mood/Affect and Well-Being

The evidence for depression is only based on two studies with different study charac-
teristics and with mixed results [75,77]. One study, with low strength of evidence, showed
a non-statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁcial effect on depression (with a stressor) [77] but we
are unable to state if this is the true effect as the study could have been underpowered. The
other study showed a reduction in depression scores for both intervention and comparator
but by a larger degree for the control (without a stressor) [75]. However, caution is required
due to the data’s distribution (skewed) and how the results were provided (mean) personal
communication [81].
evidence

studies measuring this
outcome [37,72,73,76,78]. A non-statistically signiﬁcant detrimental effect appeared to
occur particularly when a stressor is applied. Of the two studies that showed statistically
signiﬁcant beneﬁcial results without a stressor, this result had not lasted by the 4th session
for one study. Where a non-statistical signiﬁcance was shown, a power calculation was not

included. Therefore, the studies may have been underpowered to demonstrate the true
effect (which may or may not be similar to the results explored here). Further investigation
is required before any conclusions can be made for this outcome.

Three studies measured well-being using various tools (for example, Sense of Be-
longing in School, Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), Satisfaction
with Life Scale (SWLS), Subjective Happiness Scale and Medical Outcomes Study Social
Support) [35,37,78]. Overall, tentative but mostly beneﬁcial effects were found in varying
measures of well-being when measured immediately after or within 24 h of the AAI. Where
a non-statistically signiﬁcant effect was found, the outcomes were measured within 24 h of
the intervention during mid-term exam season. Additionally, no power calculation had
been included for the non-statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings, and therefore, distinguishing
between true “no effect” or being underpowered was not possible.

5. Discussion
5.1. Statement of Principal Findings

This systematic review included 11 RCT assessing AAIs on mental health outcomes
for students attending higher education in a variety of settings and countries. The evidence
suggests that AAIs could provide short-term beneﬁcial results for anxiety in students
attending higher education. There is limited evidence for stress, and inconclusive evidence
for depression, well-being and mood. These results are from studies at high risk of bias for
the outcomes of interest with mostly medium strength of evidence.

5.2. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Review

The strengths of this review include a comprehensive search strategy incorporating
both grey and published literature. Additionally, independent conduct of screening, data
extraction and risk of bias with inclusion of a third reviewer to resolve any discrepancies
were incorporated. This reduced the introduction of random and systematic errors [82].
Development of decision rules, where required, increased transparency and rigor. Further-
more, this review combined RCTs, which represent the gold standard study design for
evaluating a causal relationship and for measuring an intervention’s effectiveness [83]. A
meta-analysis was not appropriate for reasons already described; therefore, vote counting,
based on direction of effect and not statistical signiﬁcance, was employed. Vote counting
using statistical signiﬁcance can be misleading especially in studies where no power calcu-
lation was reported and no signiﬁcance was found [40]. The lack of statistically signiﬁcant
effect may either be due to the study being underpowered or may reﬂect a true lack of
effect [40]. However, when using vote counting on direction of effect without considering
statistical signiﬁcance, the effect seen may be due to chance. Additionally, vote counting
methods are unable to provide a precise estimate of the overall effect size.

Due to COVID-19, some resources were inaccessible (list included in Appendix C).
Additionally, a pragmatic approach to the Advanced Google search was incorporated using
only primary outcomes. Well-being is a particularly broad concept. Proxies that were
strongly related to well-being were included but may not have been an exhaustive list.
Therefore, some articles that could have met the eligibility criteria may have been missed.
A percentage above a minimum for double screening, data extraction and risk of bias
assessment was chosen due to resource and time constraints, which represents a limitation.
Using the strength of evidence approach, overall weight was inﬂuenced mainly by how
well the authors described randomisation and/or presence of withdrawals/missing data
as all the studies were relevant RCTs where double blinding was difﬁcult. Where not
reported, concluding whether these elements simply had not occurred or had occurred but
not described due to reasons (such as word-count limits) was impossible, unless clariﬁed
by the authors through correspondence. Furthermore, different tools to assess strength of
evidence or risk of bias may have produced different ﬁndings.

5.3. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Studies

The limitations of the primary evidence reviewed included variable levels of descrip-
tive reporting in the included studies, such as participant characteristics, delivery of the
intervention and theory of change. For example, the descriptions of the included AAIs

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 10768

17 of 43

varied considerably from a high level of detail to only a single sentence or short paragraph.
Therefore, providing conclusions about whether certain types of AAIs were more effective
that others or to isolate the “active ingredient” of effective AAIs was not possible. Most of
the participants were females, ranging from 57% to 85%, and authors rarely commented
on how well the sample population represented the target population. Furthermore, all
the participants volunteered to participate and, therefore, may not be representative of
the target population [84]. For example, those volunteering (and therefore, self-selecting)
may be more motivated and/or have a different mental health status than those who did
not [84,85]. Additionally, individuals who are afraid, allergic or have a medical condition
precluding participation with animals are unlikely to have volunteered. Therefore, build-
ing a comprehensive picture of the type of individual attending higher education, who
would beneﬁt from AAIs was challenging. These reporting issues meant that assessing the
generalisability of the results was also problematic.

The outcomes reviewed were self-reported and can be subject to unconscious and/or
conscious ascertainment bias. With this type of intervention, blinding of participants or
individuals delivering the intervention was difﬁcult, if not impossible. This resulted in all
the studies having an overall high risk of bias for the outcomes of interest for this systematic
review. Additionally, participant expectancy bias could have been introduced, which was
highlighted in Williams et al. [79] as 90% of the control group sampled (n = 15) stated they
thought an interaction with the dog would have reduced their stress prior to an exam. De-
spite these limitations, capturing how an individual feels after an intervention/comparator
is important. To aid corroboration and conﬁdence with self-reported results, triangu-
lation would be beneﬁcial such as with objective measures (for example, physiological
outcomes) and/or blinded behavioural observations [86]. Indeed, some of the studies
reported physiological outcomes but were beyond the scope of this systematic review,
which is a limitation.

Furthermore, for the outcomes where no statistical difference was found, either no
power calculation was included, or the study was underpowered. In those studies, no
deﬁnitive conclusion can be derived about the effectiveness of that particular intervention
for that speciﬁc outcome as it is not possible to state if the non-statistically signiﬁcant
difference was the true effect or not [87].

5.4. Study Meaning: Possible Mechanism and Implications for Policymakers

The Fogg Behaviour Model (FBM) is a theory of change model that could be considered
for AAIs and student engagement to improve mental health outcomes [88]. In summary,
FBM requires three elements for the intended behaviour of student engagement with AAIs
to occur: motivation, ability and triggers [88]. Triggers promote the intended behaviours
and may be achieved by advertisement/promotion of the sessions [88]. Motivation for
attendance is proposed as the animals’ presence addressing three core motivators: (1)
hope of an experience that is likely to be (2) pleasurable and (3) socially acceptable for
the majority [88]. Finally, to optimise the students’ ability to participate in this intended
behaviour, the model’s six elements of simplicity should be addressed [88]:

time (sessions to be short)

1.
2. money (sessions to be cost-neutral for students)
3.
4.
5.
6.

physical effort (sessions to be offered in an accessible location)
brain cycles (process by which to attend the sessions should be easy)
social acceptance (as offered by activities with animals)
routine (regular sessions to be offered)

For policymakers considering implementing AAIs in a higher educational setting,
a logic model should be developed alongside the intervention to assist in clarifying the
active ingredients and causal assumptions [89]. Key stakeholders, such as students from
varying backgrounds, staff from student support services and animal/handler teams,
should be involved during the design stage. A formative evaluation, including both
process and implementation assessments, with a mixed-methods pilot study would be a

useful ﬁrst step [89–91]. The feasibility, acceptability and ﬁdelity of the AAI in the target
population can therefore be assessed with adaptation, if required. Thereafter, a summative
evaluation, using a larger mixed-methods RCT, evaluating effectiveness, with a nested
process evaluation, would be recommended [90].

5.5. Future Research Recommendations

Further research recommendations are detailed in Box 1. Particularly, the overall
reporting quality by authors should be improved with facilitation from journals. For exam-
ple, authors should provide enough information to allow replication of the interventions
or expansion of the existing research [65]. These steps will help identify the effective or
ineffective interventions and facilitate further evaluation of the active ingredients. Fur-
thermore, potentially conﬂicting evidence, albeit not statistically signiﬁcant, is present for
mood which needs further evaluation to ensure that AAIs do not have unintended negative
consequences [92]. Additionally, including animal welfare and economic evaluations are
important to help secure support and funding from commissioners.

•

Use of standardised and internationally recognised deﬁnitions when describing AAIs
Use of sample sizes that provide adequate power
Clarity regarding the randomisation procedure (including description of allocation, and
whether concealed allocation occurred) and provision of an adequate description of the
participants’ characteristics separated by group
Clear reporting of the participants’ ﬂow through the trial with reasons for any missing data
for each respective group and at each time-point
Use of explicit comparators to establish the relative effects of the co-interventions (e.g., appro-
priate attention controls)
Adequate descriptions of the interventions implemented to facilitate replication
Clear reporting of the outcome measurement procedure (particularly when multiple time-
points or stressors are present), including any adaptations made to the scales used
Provision of access to publicly available pre-speciﬁed statistical analysis plans by authors,
including justiﬁcation for choice of target differences
Clear reporting of adverse events for both humans and animals

6. Conclusions

Animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) were considered as potential interventions to
help improve mental health and well-being of students in higher education who are willing
to and can engage with animals. The pooled evidence suggests that AAIs could provide
short-term beneﬁcial results for anxiety, and possibly stress, in this population, known to
be at risk of mental health issues. However, caution is required as these results were from
studies at high risk of bias for the outcomes of interest for this systematic review with mostly
medium strength evidence, and in various cultural settings. Subsequent implementation
of AAIs in this setting requires both formative and summative evaluation to measure both
the intended and unintended consequences. Furthermore, consideration of alternatives
for students unable to participate due to fear of animals or medical contraindications is
recommended to prevent widening of health inequalities.

Appendix B

Additional decision rules for RoB2 assessment and vote counting
RoB2 Assessment:
The decision rules were developed and applied to the RoB2 assessment to standardise
the approach when information was lacking in the RoB2 guidance on how to approach.
The speciﬁc domains and questions are taken directly from the RoB2 tool [67,68].

“Domain 1: Risk of bias arising from the randomisation process
1.3: Did baseline differences between intervention groups suggest a problem with the

randomisation process?”

To allocate “No”/”Probably No” or “Yes”/”Probably Yes”: the baseline differences
of the participants had to be split by each group to be able to compare. Additionally, the
authors had to ensure it was clearly stated (either in the narrative or in Tables/Figures)
that the characteristics were for the randomised participants. Providing only a statement
regarding the characteristics for the whole group or a statement regarding statistical
differences between the groups were not enough.

Otherwise, the grading of “No Information” was allocated.
“Domain 2: Risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions (effect

of assignment to intervention)

2.6: Was an appropriate analysis used to estimate the effect of assignment to intervention?”
“Probably Yes” was allocated if all missing information was speciﬁed with reasons
and the trialists did not state if deviations had occurred. The rationale was that the trialist
may not state that deviations had not occurred due to word-count issues. Deviations are
reportable to the relevant Institutional Review Boards (IRB) in accordance with ethical
approval and trialists are expected to state deviations (if they occurred) according to good
research practice.

“2.7: Was there potential for a substantial impact (on the result) of the failure to analyse

participants in the group to which they were analysed?”

“Probably No” was allocated if excluded or missing data were less than 5% with

appropriate reasons why.

“Domain 3: Risk of bias due to missing outcome data
3.1: Were data for this outcome available for all, or nearly all, participants ran-

domised?”

For the allocation of “Yes” or “Probably Yes”: the authors had to clearly state the
amount of missing data either in the narrative or in a Table/Figure and had to be less
than 5%.

“No” was allocated if the missing data were more than 5%.
“No Information” was allocated if the amount of missing data was not clearly stated

in either the narrative or Tables/Figures.

“3.3. Could missingness in the outcome depend on its true value?”
“No” was allocated if reasons were provided for the missing data and the reasons

were not related to the outcome.

“Yes” was allocated if reasons were given and related to the outcome.
“No Information” was allocated if no reasons were provided.
If 3.4 required a response: “Is it likely that missingness in the outcome depended on

its true value?”

“No information” was allocated if no reasons were provided for the missing data and

the amount that were missing in each group was not clearly stated.
“Domain 4: Risk of bias in measurement of the outcome:
4.5: Is it likely that assessment of the outcome was inﬂuenced by knowledge of

intervention received?”

Due to the nature of the intervention, even if the participants were blinded to the

study’s purpose: “Yes” or “Probably Yes” was allocated.

“Domain 5: Risk of bias in selection of the reported results:
5.1 Were the data that produced the results in accordance with a pre-speciﬁed analysis

plan that was ﬁnalised before unblinded outcomes data were available for analysis?”

For “Yes” to be allocated, the authors were required to publish their pre-speciﬁed

analysis protocol in the public domain.

For “No” to be allocated, the authors had to both conﬁrm pre-speciﬁed analysis proto-
col was not published and analysis was, indeed, not in accordance with an unpublished
pre-speciﬁed plan.

“No Information” was allocated if no published pre-speciﬁed plan.
“5.2: Is the numerical result being assessed likely to have been selected, on the basis
of the results from multiple eligible outcome (e.g., scales, deﬁnitions, time-points) within
the outcome domain?”

“No” was allocated if the outcomes were measured at similar times in the same order

with the same measures and same mode of administration for the groups involved.

“Yes” was allocated if the above elements varied.
“No information” was allocated if not enough information was given to assess adequately.
“5.3: Is the numerical result being assessed likely to have been selected, on the basis

of the results, from multiple eligible analyses of the data?”

For “Yes” to be allocated, evidence was required to suggest multiple analyses had
occurred either through the available information or through correspondence with the authors.
“No” was allocated if a pre-speciﬁed analysis protocol was published or the authors
conﬁrmed that the analysis was in accordance with a pre-speciﬁed unpublished analysis
plan which was then made available for reviewers to examine.

“No Information” was allocated if the above criteria were not met.
Vote counting:
Table A1 summarises the decision criteria for both without and with a stressor. Specif-
ically, in situations where a stressor was present, the expected response without the inter-
vention was considered. For example, after a stressor (e.g., an experimental cognitive test)
or before a known stressor (e.g., exam), the expectation is that anxiety scores are likely to
be worse than baseline. For the intervention to have a beneﬁcial effect when a stressor was
present, three situations could occur:

(1)

(2)
(3)

anxiety was worse after the intervention (as expected due to the stressor) but not by
as much as the control group
no change seen after the intervention, but anxiety was worse in the control group
anxiety was better after the intervention and better than the control group

reporting outcome (e.g., anecdotal with no empirical data included) as well as wrong sequence of measuring
outcomes; wrong intervention also included if stressor was not student-speciﬁc).

Appendix D. Summary of the Theoretical Frameworks and Results

Theoretical frameworks:
For a study to be classed as clearly stating the theoretical framework that underpinned

the included intervention, one of the following criteria was required:
• mechanism of action was stated and directly linked back to the intervention’s devel-

opment before implementation; or

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 10768

31 of 43

•

proposal was offered for the intervention’s mechanism of action on the outcomes
before the intervention was implemented; or

• mechanism of action was stated with a pre-speciﬁed assessment to distinguish the

different co-interventions’ relative effects

Three of the included studies were assessed as articulating the theoretical framework

•

•

according to the above [35,37,80]:
•

Binfet [35] used Biophilia and Cobb’s Social Support Theory [24,26] stating that the
study was “designed to both facilitate group interactions & human-animal relation-
ship, factors theorized to contribute to stress reduction” ([35] p. 399).
Grajfoner et al. [37] suggested that a beneﬁt of dog-assisted interventions is “encour-
aging students to perceive counseling services as more accessible” & “therapy dogs
represent a source of comfort, acceptance & de-stress” ([37] p. 2) with the study aimed
to work out the relative inﬂuence of the dogs.

• Meola [80] considered experiential learning to address the structure proposed by
Larson’s Social Cognitive Model of Counsellor Training (based on Banduras Social
Cognitive Theory) as cited by Meola [80].

Seven of the included studies partially articulated the theoretical framework according

to the above criteria [73–79]:
•

Fiocco et al. [73] discussed the presence of therapy animal may act as a buffer of stress
with no further expansion.
Gebhart et al. [74] suggested distraction-focused techniques are “capable of creating
some kind of break & may help students feel better” ([74] p. 3) with evidence that
distraction techniques have reduced anxiety in other settings.

• Hall [75] applied Kolcaba’s Midrange Theory of Comfort [208] from patients to stu-
dents. Suggested that students who reach transcendence (highest level of comfort)
“would be empowered to rise above the challenges of nursing education” ([75] p. 203).
Stating how & why dogs could help with achieving transcendence was not explicitly
included.

• Hunt et al. [76] described the intervention of interest initially as a placebo control and
in the discussion theorized the role of social support, community & sense of belonging.
Shearer et al. [77] described the intervention of interest as an active control and in the
discussion considered unconditional positive regard & social environment.

•

• Ward-Grifﬁn et al. [78] suggested that therapy animals may act as a source of social

support with no further expansion.

• Williams et al. [79] reported that therapy animals are trained to provide comfort,

affection & can be calming with no further expansion.

One study [72] was assessed as not articulating the theoretical framework according

to the above criteria:
•

Banks et al. [72] discussed the beneﬁts of canine interaction, for example the cognitive
changes with reducing mind wandering & increasing sustained attention but did not
explore how & why mental health outcomes would be improved.

Results:
Box A1 aids with interpretation of mean change scores and Table A3 provides sum-

mary of the results.

Box A1. Interpretation of the mean change scores (post-scores minus pre-scores) for each outcome
measures; one example of the change score is presented with the inverse being true for the alterna-
tive option.

Anxiety as measured by:
STAI (regardless of subscale): negative change = anxiety decreases
HADS-anxiety subscale: negative change = anxiety decreases

Stress as measured by:
PSS: negative change = stress decreases

Depression as measured by:
BDI II: negative change = depression decreases
HADS-depression subscale: negative change = depression decreases

Mood/affect as measured by:
PANAS positive: negative change = positive mood decreases
PANAS negative: negative change = negative mood decreases
UMACL (depends on subscale): inference in paper was positive change = mood increases

Well-being as measured by:
WEMWBS: positive change = mental well-being increases
Subjective Happiness Scale: positive change = happiness increases
Total social support: positive change = total levels of support increases
SWLS (based on brackets): 5–9 = extremely dissatisﬁed; 15–19 = slightly dissatisﬁed; 20 = neutral;
21–25 = slightly satisﬁed; 26–30 = satisﬁed and as both groups in the same bracket that a negative
score = satisfaction with life decreases

A free interaction 20-min single
group AAA session demonstrated:
(1) anxiety scores reduced for both
dog with handler & control groups
which was statistically signiﬁcant in
favour of the dog with handler group
(2) statistically signiﬁcant
improvement in well-being in favour
of the dog with handler group
(3) NS signiﬁcant improvement in
mood (increased in dog with handler
group with reduction in control)
Where NS, no power calculation so
unable to say if no true effect or
if underpowered.

A mixture of group/individual dog
AAA sessions with free interaction &
numerous opportunities to interact
over 15–16 weeks, showed a
statistically signiﬁcant reduction in
anxiety in favour of dogs on
post-score (not controlled for
pre-score; however, if evenly
randomised can be
appropriate [209]).
Caution: depression scores not
normally distributed (only means
provided personal communication
[81]). Appears to reduce in both
groups: more in control group.

Group AAA sessions with free
interaction of NR length once a week
for 4 weeks with a dog (with games,
icebreakers & snacks) demonstrated:
(1) anxiety levels reduced for dog
group compared to control
(statistical signiﬁcance only reported
for 4th session = NS)
(2) Control had statistically
signiﬁcant worse negative mood
over time compared to dog group
but not by 4th session
After a stressor (1–3 weeks after
interventions had ﬁnished), dog
group had statistically signiﬁcant
worsening of anxiety levels & NS
higher negative mood compared to
control. Positive mood was NR.
Where NS, no power calculation so
unable to say if no true effect or
if underpowered.

Individual 1-h structured AAT/AAE
session with a horse demonstrated a
small reduction in anxiety when
measured up to 1 month after
intervention (NS but underpowered).

Group free interaction AAA sessions
with a dog including games & snacks
lasting for 1 h/week for 4 weeks had
statistically signiﬁcant lower anxiety
scores than control.
After a stressor (1–2 weeks after
interventions ﬁnished), anxiety
levels increased in both groups but
greater in treatment group (NS).
Depression scores decreased in both
groups with treatment group
reducing more (NS) than control.
Where NS, no power calculation so
unable to say if no true effect or
if underpowered.

Group free interaction single AAA
session with dogs lasting up to
90 min with outcomes measured up
to 24 h after delivery, had statistically
signiﬁcant reduction in stress,
negative mood & amelioration of
total social support compared to
control.
Positive mood reduced for both
groups & slightly more in treatment
group (NS).
Well-being: Satisfaction with Life:
both groups were in the extremely
dissatisﬁed category at baseline.
Scores reduced in dog (NS) & did not
change category. Happiness levels
essentially did not change. Total
social support signiﬁcantly increased
in treatment group.
Where NS, no power calculation so
unable to say if no true effect or if
underpowered.

For a 12-min inferred individual
single AAA session delivered prior
to an exam, anxiety levels increased
for both groups with control having
statistically signiﬁcant higher levels
of anxiety than dog.
