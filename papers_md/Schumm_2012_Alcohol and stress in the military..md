Problematic alcohol use within the

United States military has been
linked to substantial financial and

productivity losses. Data from 2006
revealed that excessive alcohol consump-
tion cost the U.S. military $1.12 billion
per year (Harwood et al. 2009).
Regarding medical expenditures, studies
have found that excessive alcohol use
by military members results in an annual
cost of $425 million. Excessive drink-
ing within the military is estimated to
result in a loss of 320,000 work days
and 34,400 arrests per year, half of
which are for driving under the influ-
ence. Finally, these data indicate that
each year excessive alcohol use results
in 10,400 active-duty military being
unable to deploy and 2,200 being 
separated from service duty. Given the
substantial cost of alcohol misuse, it is
imperative to examine factors that may
contribute to problematic drinking so

Although research has independently linked stress experienced by military personnel
to both alcohol use and posttraumatic stress disorder, more recently researchers have
noted that there also is a significant overlap between stress reactions and alcohol use
in  veterans  and  active-duty  service  members.  This  overlap  seems  to  be  most
understood  in  individuals  who  have  experienced  combat  or  military  sexual  trauma.
This article will provide a brief review of some potential causal mechanisms underlying
this  relationship,  including  self-medication  and  genetic  vulnerability  models.  It  also
addresses  the  possible  implications  for  assessment  and  treatment  of  military
personnel with co-occurring disorders. KEY WORDS: Alcohol consumption; alcohol use

This article will examine the links
between military traumatic stress and
mental health problems, such as post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
between military traumatic stress and
problematic alcohol use. Furthermore,
it will summarize the pathways that
may explain these links and describe
possible implications for assessment
and interventions with veterans. 

Prevalence of Problematic
Alcohol Use in the U.S. Military

Frequent heavy drinking, defined as
consuming five or more drinks on one
or more occasions per week, occurs
among a substantial proportion of U.S.
military personnel and varies as a func-
tion of military demographic character-
istics. In a large-scale survey, Bray and

Hourani (2005) found that the preva-
lence of frequent heavy drinking in the
military from 1980 through 2005 ranged
from 15 to 20 percent. Consistent with
findings from civilian samples that
show gender differences in rates of
heavy drinking, military men were
nearly 3.5 times more likely to report
frequent heavy drinking compared
with women in the military. Frequent
heavy drinking also varied as a function
of ethnicity, with Hispanic and non-
Hispanic Whites exhibiting higher
rates of problematic drinking than
non-Hispanic Blacks. In addition, mili-
tary rank significantly correlated with
frequent heavy drinking; rates were six
times greater among enlisted personnel
with the lowest rankings compared
with officers. Rates of heavy drinking
also varied as a function of military 
service branch, with those in the Army,
Navy, and Marines being more likely 
to report frequent heavy drinking than

those in the Air Force. Other population-
based studies of the U.S. military have
found that heavy drinking is more
likely to occur among younger military
members (Stahre et al. 2009). Together,
these results suggest that certain military
demographic groups (e.g., younger,
low-ranking, non–Air Force, White or
Hispanic men) may be especially prone
to engage in frequent heavy drinking.
Young adults in the military are
more likely than their civilian counter-
parts to engage in heavy drinking. For
example, Ames and Cunradi (2004)
found that rates of heavy drinking
were significantly higher among male
military personnel aged 18 to 25 years
(32.2 percent) compared with male
civilians in a similar age range (17.8
percent). The researchers also found
significantly elevated rates of heavy
drinking among women in the military
compared with similarly aged female
civilians (5.5 percent). In addition to
demographic factors, military-related
stressful events also may contribute to the
high rates of problem drinking observed.
Alcohol misuse also frequently occurs
among a substantial proportion of com-
bat veterans. In one population-based
study of 88,235 veterans returning
from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF),
Milliken and colleagues (2007) found
that 12 to 15 percent of veterans endorsed
problematic alcohol use in the 3 to 6
months following their return from
combat. These data suggest that alcohol
misuse occurs among a substantial
number of veterans who are exposed to
combat-related traumatic stress and
highlight the importance of understand-
ing the relationships between stressful
military experiences (e.g., combat and
military sexual trauma) and alcohol
misuse. 

Military Trauma and 
Stress-Related Disorders

Stress-related disorders in response to
military service have been noted
throughout history. Whether labeled
“combat fatigue” or “shell shock” or
PTSD, there have been consistent

reports in the literature documenting
that exposure to combat experiences
can lead to an impairment of psycho-
logical functioning in military person-
nel (Foa et al. 2009). Beginning with
the Vietnam War, and more recently
with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
(Department of Defense [DOD], 2007,
p. ES-1), PTSD has been the most
commonly diagnosed mental health
disorder for veterans returning from

combat. Epidemiological studies of
Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/
OIF veterans treated in the Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system
have found that 14 to 22 percent of
returning veterans were diagnosed with
PTSD (Seal et al. 2009; Tanelian and
Jaycox 2008), making it the signature
psychological wound of these two wars
(DOD 2007). People are diagnosed
with PTSD after exposure to a trauma
if they experience a strong emotional
response to the event that is followed
by persistent difficulty in three key areas,
including reexperiencing (e.g., night-
mares, flashbacks), arousal (e.g., startle
response, sleep disturbance), and
avoidance (e.g., withdrawal from people,
places, and other reminders of the
trauma). These disruptions often lead
to an impaired ability to function in
social, educational, and work environ-
ments, making PTSD a very debilitating
condition. More recently, research has
found that PTSD and related disorders,
such as depression, can develop in mil-
itary personnel not only as a result of
combat exposure but also as a result 
of childhood traumas, military sexual
trauma (MST), mortuary affairs duty,
and training accidents (Foa et. al. 2009).

Military Trauma and 
Alcohol Misuse

Not only does military trauma increase
the likelihood of developing stress-
related mental health disorders such 
as PTSD or depression, but, as alluded
to earlier, there is also evidence that
traumatic experiences are related to
problematic alcohol use among military
members. One form of military trau-
matic stress that has been surprisingly
under-researched is the psychological
impact of exposure to killing within a
combat setting. In a series of studies,
Maguen and colleagues (2010a, b)
examined the relationships among
experiences with killing within combat
and  psychological adjustment of combat
veterans, including problematic alcohol
use. As predicted, engaging in killing
during combat was related to PTSD
symptoms but also was independently
linked to problematic alcohol use as
well as the overall quantity and frequency
of alcohol use among these soldiers.
These results suggest that killing within
the context of combat may be a dis-
tinctive risk factor for heavy drinking
and problematic alcohol use following
combat among members of the military.
In addition to combat-related traumatic
experiences elevating the risk for alcohol
misuse, there is also evidence that MST
is associated with alcohol misuse among
military personnel. In a review of the
literature on MST, Suris and Lind (2008)
examined the relationship between MST
experiences and mental and physical
health outcomes. They concluded that
MST was related to a variety of negative
mental and physical health outcomes,
including elevated rates of alcohol misuse
among those who experienced MST
compared with nontraumatized indi-
viduals. Taken together, these results
suggest that various forms of military
trauma, including exposures to killing
in combat and MST, elevate the risk
for problematic alcohol use among
members of the military. These findings
also suggest that alcohol misuse is likely
to co-occur with other posttraumatic
mental health disorders, such as 
PTSD and depression, among military

personnel. Therefore, it is important to
examine the co-occurrence of alcohol
misuse within the context of these
posttraumatic mental health disorders
and to develop models that might
explain these comorbidities.

Is Alcohol Used to 
Self-Medicate Symptoms 
of Military Posttraumatic
Psychiatric Disorders?

The self-medication hypothesis has
been proposed to explain the relation-
ship between military traumatic stress
and alcohol use disorders. According 
to this model, the relationship between
traumatic events and the heightened
risk for an alcohol use disorders is
mediated by the occurrence of PTSD
or other posttraumatic psychiatric dis-
orders (Jacobsen et al. 2001; Khantzian
1999). Specifically, traumatic events
are proposed to lead to psychiatric 
disorders such as PTSD or depression,
and individuals manifesting these 
conditions may turn to alcohol use 
as a means of “self-medicating” their
symptoms. From a learning-theory
paradigm, alcohol use is hypothesized
to be negatively reinforcing in that it
provides immediate and short-term
relief from posttraumatic psychiatric
symptoms. For example, military veter-
ans with PTSD reported using alcohol
to specifically cope with re-experiencing
and hyperarousal symptoms (Bremner
et al. 1996), and given the powerful,
short-term negative reinforcement
effects of alcohol, the theory postulates
that people may begin to use alcohol
frequently and excessively, resulting 
in the development of an alcohol use
disorder. 

Although the self-medication
hypoth esis proposes that the initial
development of an alcohol use disorder
is reactionary to PTSD or other post-
traumatic psychiatric disorders, an
important corollary is that alcohol abuse
impedes recovery and even worsens
symptoms of posttraumatic mental health
disorders. Within a cognitive–behavioral

paradigm that attempts to understand
the necessary conditions to recover
from PTSD, it is hypothesized that the
individual must be able to eliminate
avoidance of stressful situations—i.e.,
they must put themselves into contact
with people, places, or things that are
objectively safe but that continue to
cause distress, such as being in crowds,
thinking about the trauma, or experi-
encing emotions related to the trauma
(Foa and Kozak 1986). Alcohol misuse
can interfere with this necessary pre-
condition for recovery by leading indi-
viduals to continue to engage in
unhelpful avoidance behaviors. In fact,
within the self-medication framework,
alcohol use can in itself be conceptual-
ized as an avoidance behavior (e.g.,
using alcohol to avoid thinking about
the traumas). In addition, alcohol
withdrawal symptoms can mirror or
exacerbate the symptoms of PTSD
(Jacobson et al. 2001). For example,
people experiencing post–acute with-
drawal may have increased irritability,
sleep problems, difficulty concentrat-
ing, and anxious and depressed mood,
all of which overlap with symptoms 
of PTSD or depression. Thus, alcohol
misuse feeds back into the posttrau-
matic mental health symptoms, in a
bidirectional manner (see the figure).

Not only do alcohol use disorders
complicate recovery from posttraumatic
mental health disorders, such as PTSD,
but these stress-related conditions have
been found to impede recovery from
alcoholism. Ouimette and colleagues
(1999) found that substance-dependent
veterans with PTSD had poorer sub-
stance abuse treatment outcomes after
2 years compared with those without
PTSD. Consistent with these results,
Brown and colleagues (1999) found
that substance-dependent individuals
with co-occurring PTSD relapsed more
quickly than those without PTSD.
Taken together, these results suggest
that the co-occurrence of an alcohol
use disorder with PTSD provides a
substantial barrier to recovery from
both of these disorders.

Although large-scale research from
civilian populations have found sup-
port for the self-medication hypothesis
(e.g., Breslau et al. 1991), there has
been less research on this theory in
post–Vietnam War era samples. In a
study of OEF/OIF veterans, Jakupcak
and colleagues (2010) found that
although combat exposure per se did
not increase the risk for alcohol misuse,
screening positive for PTSD or depres-
sion doubled this risk. The authors
concluded that the findings may be

consistent with the hypothesis that these
veterans were misusing alcohol as a
means of coping with symptoms of
PTSD and depression. In addition, the
authors found that alcohol misuse was
particularly associated with emotional
numbing symptoms of PTSD, suggest-
ing that veterans may have been drink-
ing alcohol in an effort to improve their
mood or to increase emotional connec-
tivity with others. However, because
these data were collected cross sectionally,
it was not possible to clearly examine
the causal and temporal relationship
between the development of the psy-
chiatric symptomatology and the onset
of alcohol use disorders, raising questions
regarding the directionality of these
relationships.

Evidence shows that PTSD is not the
only stress-related condition that might
mediate the relationship between stress
and alcohol misuse in military person-
nel. In a stratified, large-scale sample 
of military reservists, Gradus and col-
leagues (2008) examined whether
symptoms of depression explained the
relationship between military sexual
harassment experiences and alcohol
misuse, and they found that more severe
sexual harassment was related to greater
depression symptoms among female
reservists. In addition, experiencing
greater amounts of sexual harassment
was related to higher alcohol misuse.
However, when depression symptoms
were entered into the equation, the
relationship between women’s experi-
ence of sexual harassment and alcohol
misuse was no longer significant.
These data suggest that female military
reservists may be prone to abuse alcohol
as a way of coping with depression
symptoms that are secondary to experi-
encing military sexual harassment.

Does Heritability Play a Role 
in Military Members’ Alcohol
Misuse and Posttraumatic
Psychiatric Disorders?

Research on veterans suggests that
common genetic underpinnings may
partially explain the relationship between

combat exposure, posttraumatic psy-
chiatric disorders, and alcohol misuse.
Much of this evidence comes from stud-
ies that are derived from the Vietnam
Era Twin Registry (McLeod et al. 2001;
Scherrer et al. 2008; Xian et al. 2000).
This registry involves a large-scale sample
of monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs
who served in the military during the
Vietnam era. By examining the rela-
tionships between degree of combat
exposure, posttraumatic psychiatric dis-
orders, and alcohol misuse among twin
pairs that share identical (i.e., monozy-
gotic) or nonidentical (i.e., dizygotic)
genetics, researchers derived estimates
as to the relative degree of genetic and
environmental contributions in explain-
ing experiences in these domains. 

Several conclusions were reached by
studies of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry
data. PTSD and alcohol use problems
were both found to be influenced by
genetics, although environmental factors
explained about one-half of the variance
in alcohol misuse and over one-half 
of the variance in PTSD symptoms
(McLeod et al. 2001; Xian et al. 2000).
These findings suggest that although
genetic factors are notable in explaining
these disorders, environmental factors
are equal to, if not more substantive,
than genetics. Of interest, Xian and
colleagues (2000) found that shared
family environment did not add to the
model in predicting these disorders.
This suggests that environmental factors
other than the family environment may
be responsible for much of the varia-
tion in PTSD and alcohol misuse. In
addition, these studies concluded that
a common genetic element partially
accounts for the co-occurrence of com-
bat exposure, posttraumatic psychiatric
disorders, and alcohol misuse. In other
words, genetic factors may predispose
individuals to end up in combat situa-
tions and to develop symptoms of PTSD,
depression, and alcohol use disorders.
Building on this finding, Scherrer and
colleagues (2008) found that the genetic
and environmental contributions to
PTSD, in particular, explained the link
between combat and alcohol misuse as
well as combat and depression. This

404 Alcohol Research: C u r r e n t   R e v i e w s

suggests that a combination of genetic
and environmental vulnerability for 
the development of PTSD may entirely
explain linkages between combat expo-
sure and later alcohol misuse and devel-
opment of depression. Such a conclusion
is important because it suggests that
improving understanding of the etiology
of and treatment for PTSD may be a
key to addressing alcohol misuse and
depression following combat exposure.

Is Alcohol Misuse a 
Pre-existing Risk Factor for
Traumatic Stress Recovery?

Although it is possible that military
members may engage in alcohol mis-
use as a way of trying to cope with
posttraumatic psychiatric symptoms,
there also is evidence to suggest that
pre-existing alcohol misuse contributes
to posttraumatic psychiatric maladjust-
ment. A longitudinal study by Dickstein
and colleagues (2010) found several
trajectories of recovery from PTSD
symptoms among U.S. soldiers who
were deployed to Kosovo on a peace-
keeping mission. Although most sol-
diers (84 percent) exhibited a resilient
recovery following their deployment
(i.e., low initial PTSD symptoms that
decreased over time), a minority exhib-
ited problematic levels of PTSD during
the follow-up period. After controlling
for other possible risk factors, higher
predeployment alcohol misuse distin-
guished soldiers who experienced PTSD
symptoms over the postdeployment
follow-up period. These results suggest
that problematic drinking prior to the
traumatic combat experience may be 
a risk factor for some soldiers to exhibit
PTSD symptoms following combat
exposure. 

Although these findings suggest that
problematic alcohol use may be a risk
factor that precedes the development
of PTSD, they are not necessarily
inconsistent with the self-medication
model. Predeployment alcohol misuse
may be a behavioral signal for soldiers’
pre-existing maladaptive coping strate-
gies. For example, soldiers who misuse

alcohol prior to deployment may be
especially prone to abuse alcohol fol-
lowing deployment as a way of trying
to self-medicate PTSD re-experiencing
symptoms and to avoid difficult and
painful emotions. This type of avoidance-
based coping strategy is considered an
underlying factor in the exacerbation
of PTSD symptoms (Foa and Kozak
1986). Hence, these soldiers may be
especially prone to attempt to self-
medicate posttraumatic psychiatric
symptoms, thereby worsening the
course of the posttraumatic psychiatric
condition.

Findings from Dickstein and col-
leagues (2010) that alcohol misuse is 
a risk factor for PTSD can also be con-
sidered from the perspective of genetics
research on combat, PTSD, and alcohol
misuse. As previously described, the
common genetic and environmental
elements that connect alcohol misuse
with combat exposure seem to be those
shared through PTSD (Scherrer et al.
2008). Hence, the evidence reported
by Dickstein and colleagues (2010) may
be attributed to the common genetic
and environmental vulnerabilities that
alcohol misuse shares with PTSD. In
this way, predeployment alcohol misuse
may be an observed indicator of an
underlying latent environmental and
genetic vulnerability for the develop-
ment of PTSD. Clearly, additional lon-
gitudinal research is required to tease
out how environmental and genetic risk
factors influence the course of develop-
ing PTSD and alcohol use disorders.

partially explained by improvements in
body armor and the medical response
to combat injuries. With these modern
technologies, OEF and OIF veterans
are now able to survive injuries that
would have resulted in death in prior
combat eras. However, many of these
OEF and OIF veterans who now sur-
vive combat trauma are left with the
repercussions of TBI. These TBI events
often result from blast exposure during
combat, which also can lead to post-
traumatic mental health disorders
(Corrigan and Cole 2008). Some studies
have found that up to 44 percent of
veterans who reported loss of con-
sciousness and 27 percent of veterans
who reported altered mental status also
met criteria for PTSD (Hoge et al. 2008).
Given this co-occurrence, defining the
etiology of these presenting complaints
can be difficult. Furthermore, the rela-
tionship between alcohol misuse and
TBI often is complex because heavy
drinking may predate and predispose
individuals to experiencing a TBI (i.e.,
TBI can result from accidents that
occur when people are under the influ-
ence of alcohol). In addition, alcohol
misuse can exacerbate the complications
of TBI by worsening TBI symptom
severity (e.g., persistent memory prob-
lems) and by further increasing an
individual’s risk for experiencing addi-
tional alcohol-related TBI events. In
summary, there are likely to be multiple
interrelated factors explaining the 
relationship between experiencing
traumatic events and alcohol misuse
among members of the military.

Traumatic Brain Injury, 
Alcohol Misuse, and 
Stress-Related Disorders

Implications for Assessment
and Intervention

The causal links between alcohol mis-
use and posttraumatic mental health
problems are further complicated by
the role of traumatic brain injury (TBI)
among military members. The rates of
traumatic brain injury resulting from
combat have increased dramatically
with veterans from OEF and OIF ver-
sus veterans from prior conflicts. This
increase in rates of TBI may be at least

Research on the self-medication hypoth-
esis and genetic studies suggests that
alcohol misuse following military trauma
is likely to be highly related to the co-
occurrence of PTSD and other post-
traumatic psychiatric problems. Thus,
early screening and identification of
those who are exhibiting posttraumatic
mental health problems is an impor-
tant first step in intervention. In addi-

tion, given the demonstrated vulnerability
for those with posttraumatic psychi-
atric disorders to also exhibit alcohol
misuse, screening and intervention
efforts should be comprehensive in
addressing this common comorbidity. 
Although posttraumatic psychiatric
problems may be an important medi-
ating factor between military trauma
and alcohol misuse, alcohol misuse
within the military is a complex phe-
nomenon and one that is likely to have
causal factors. As alluded to above,
military personnel who misuse alcohol
prior to experiencing military-related
trauma may be prone to abuse alcohol
following trauma, even in the absence
of developing posttraumatic mental
health problems. Thus, efforts by the
military and Veterans Affairs (VA) to
screen for early signs of alcohol misuse
are important to identify at-risk indi-
viduals before they are exposed to
combat-related trauma. As shown by
Dickstein and colleagues (2010), mili-
tary members who exhibit a pretrauma
history of alcohol misuse may be prone
to exhibit poorer recovery from PTSD
symptoms following trauma exposure.
Therefore, interventions to screen for 
a history of alcohol misuse also may
help to target individuals who are at
risk for developing increasingly severe
PTSD symptoms following military
trauma exposure.

In response to this need, the VA
Healthcare System has taken extensive
measures to address the issue of co-
occurring substance use disorders and
PTSD. For example, funding has been
provided to establish substance use 
disorder–PTSD specialists who augment
specialized PTSD treatment programs.
The role of these specialists is to facili-
tate the assessment and diagnosis of
these disorders in returning veterans
and serve as a primary provider of
mental health services for veterans with
these comorbid conditions. Of note, a
VA consensus panel (Department of
Veterans Affairs 2009) recommended
that specialists in these positions provide
first-line evidence-based treatments
such as Seeking Safety (Najavits 2002)
or motivational interviewing (Miller

Alcohol and Stress in the Military 405

and Rollnick 2002). The panel also
recommended that substance use disorder
treatment programs should continue
to use empirically supported treatments
focused on treating the substance use
disorder. Likewise, the panel recom-
mended that PTSD treatment programs
should continue to provide evidence-
based treatments targeting PTSD.
Finally, the panel concluded that the
superiority of any one given treatment
approach above another is not sup-
ported by the literature to date and that
no “gold standard” treatment exists at
this time. This serves as a reminder that
ample opportunities exist within the
VA and military settings to further study
these existing treatments and to develop
alternative approaches to treating these
comorbid conditions.  

Summary

Alcohol misuse is a problem among a
significant minority of the U.S. mili-
tary. Military-related traumatic stress
seems to elevate risk for individuals to
misuse alcohol. The co-occurrence of
posttraumatic psychiatric disorders
seems to play a major explanatory role
in the association between military stress
and alcohol misuse. Screening and
intervention for alcohol misuse, partic-
ularly following exposure to military-
related trauma, is clearly needed, as are
integrated treatments that address con-
joined alcohol and PTSD problems.  ■
