Abstract

Background:  Poor sleep exacerbates mental health problems and reduces quality-of-life (QOL) 
but prevalence of insomnia symptoms among hospice family caregivers and associations of poor 
sleep with caregiver health and QOL outcomes are not known.

Objective:  To describe prevalence of insomnia symptoms among hospice family caregivers and 
compare anxiety, depression, self-rated health, QOL, and caregiver burden between hospice family 
caregivers with and without insomnia symptoms.

Methods:  Descriptive sub-study using data collected during baseline interviews of hospice 
family caregivers involved in a randomized clinical trial in Midwestern United States (xxxxxxxx). 
Caregivers were dichotomized based on Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores (8+ indicated 
insomnia symptoms).

Results:  Among 57 hospice family caregivers, the mean ISI score was 8.2; nearly half (49.1%) 
experienced insomnia symptoms. Compared to caregivers without insomnia symptoms, caregivers 
with insomnia symptoms reported 2.4 times greater mean anxiety scores (4.7 vs 11.4); 3.5 times 
greater mean depression scores (3.1 vs 10.7); 2.1 times greater caregiver burden scores (5.6 vs 
11.8); and 1.3 times lower self-rated health (3.5 vs 2.8); 1.3 times lower total QOL scores (29.3 vs

QOL (7.4 vs 5.3).

Conclusions:  Hospice family caregivers experience high prevalence of insomnia symptoms; 
caregivers with insomnia symptoms report worse anxiety, depression, caregiver burden, QOL, 
self-rated health. Clinicians must screen hospice caregivers for poor sleep and mental health and 
offer supportive interventions that improve their sleep and health. Policy makers must expand 
hospice benefits to better support family caregivers.

Introduction

Each year, over 1.2 million family caregivers of terminally ill patients in the United States 
are at risk of sleep loss and its negative mental and physical health effects.1,2 The number 
of hospice family caregivers is expected to grow3 as the American population ages and 
as patients increasingly enroll in hospice4,5 and die at home.6 Despite providing up to 
80% of care for dying persons,7,8 hospice family caregivers receive few supportive services 
to ease the difficulty of caregiving during the day or overnight.9 Recent evidence shows 
over half of hospice family caregivers quit their jobs or reduce hours to provide care,10 
making end-of-life caregiving sometimes feel like a full-time job.11 The weight of providing 
care is enormous: hospice family caregivers experience extreme stress, fatigue, information 
overload, anticipatory grief, reduced quality of life (QOL), financial strain, decline in mental 
and physical health, and sleeplessness.8,10,12–14 Poor sleep among caregivers contributes 
to racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic health disparities15 and is associated with worse 
physical health, anxiety and depression, increased caregiver mortality, and lower caregiver 
QOL.2,16–19

In a recent mixed methods study, for example, 73% of hospice family caregivers described 
their sleep quality as “fair” or “poor” and 36% reported difficulty falling or staying asleep 
more than half the days of a week or more.20 Anticipating and attending to care-recipient 
needs at night,21,22 many hospice family caregivers report frequent sleep interruptions, 
awakenings, and anxiety that contributes to hyperarousal patterns, prevents restorative 
sleep, and results in daytime fatigue, poor mood regulation, and compromised work or 
caregiving performance.20 Hospice family caregivers’ sleep experiences mimic symptoms 
of insomnia,12,20 the most common sleep disturbance in older adults,23 but their prevalence 
of insomnia symptoms is unknown. Despite well-documented connections between sleep 
disturbance and poor health outcomes,24 associations among insomnia symptoms and 
caregiver health outcomes such as physical health, mental health, QOL, and caregiver 
burden have also not been explored.

The purpose of this study was to 1) describe the prevalence of insomnia symptoms among 
hospice family caregivers and 2) compare caregiver mental and physical health, QOL, and 
caregiver burden between hospice family caregivers with and without insomnia symptoms.

We hypothesized caregivers with insomnia symptoms would have greater levels of anxiety 
and depression, lower QOL, greater caregiver burden, and worse self-rated health.

Methods

Framework

We conducted a descriptive study using data collected during baseline surveys of hospice 
family caregivers involved in a randomized clinical trial in rural and urban areas of 
Midwestern United States (NCT02929108). This trial is sponsored by the National Cancer 
Institute (R01CA203999). The full trial protocol is registered at clinicaltrials.gov. The parent 
study included 489 caregivers of hospice patients with cancer.25 In the later stage of parent 
study enrollment, we began administering Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaires 
to participants as a sub-study within the baseline survey. To be included in our study, 
participants needed valid ISI data, which yielded a total sample of 57 participants.

The dysregulation model of sleep guided study design.24 Based on neurobiological science, 
the dysregulation model of sleep postulates that sleep disturbances impair emotional 
regulation and alter the body’s circadian rhythms in ways that exacerbate mental health 
symptoms and mood disorder severity.24 According to this model, sleep disruption due 
to insomnia or sleep loss contributes to mood disorders through 3 mechanisms: (1) 
sleep disruption acts as a neurobiological stressor leading to overactivation of the stress 
system, dysregulation of inflammation regulatory systems, and dysregulation of serotonin, 
dopamine, glutamate, orexin, and other neuroendocrine and behavioral systems related to 
mood and cognitive experiences; (2) sleep disruption impairs circadian rhythmicity, which 
is associated with mood disorders; and (3) sleep disruption impairs emotional regulatory 
systems including emotional processing, decision-making, and impulse control.24 As such, 
assessing and targeting insomnia symptoms in hospice family caregivers is critical to 
improving caregiver health outcomes.24 Over 60% of variance in caregiver depression has 
been found to be due to caregiver sleep problems,26 further supporting efficacy of this 
model.

Ethics

The parent study and our sub-study involved de-identified patient and caregiver data. Studies 
were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Washington University in St. Louis 
through a reliance agreement with the University of Missouri. Data were stored on highly 
secure servers with protocols to ensure patient and caregiver data privacy. Participants gave 
oral informed consent.

Inclusion Criteria

Participants in the parent study were included if they were age 18 or older, a friend, 
partner or family member caring for a person with cancer receiving hospice care at one 
of the participating hospice agencies, able to access the internet by phone or computer, 
and English-speaking. Additional criteria for our study included completion of the ISI 
questionnaire.

Measures

Descriptive variables.—Demographic variables included caregiver age, sex, race, 
ethnicity, marital status, caregiver relationship, education, employment status, and income. 
Similar demographic variables were included for patients. Variables related to the caregiving 
context included caregiver distance from patient, employment changes, paid caregiver 
support, caregiver administration of medications and duration, patient residence, patient 
cancer type, and patient dementia diagnosis.

Independent variable.—The presence of insomnia symptoms, defined by the 7-item 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), was our independent variable. Scores are summed and 
range from 0-28 with higher scores indicating more severe insomnia. The ISI evaluates 
the severity of current sleep onset, sleep maintenance, early morning awakening; satisfaction 
with current sleep; interference with daily functioning; notice-ability of impairment due to 
sleep problem; and amount of worry due to current sleep problem. A cut-off score of 8 
detects insomnia (95.8% and 99.4% sensitivity, 78.3% and 91.8% specificity in community 
and clinical samples, respectively).27 Caregivers who scored below 8 points are considered 
to not demonstrate clinically meaningful insomnia symptoms. The ISI has been found to be 
a valid and reliable instrument that demonstrates strong internal consistency (Cronbach’s α 
= .90 and .91).27 In our sample, the ISI’s internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .90) was 
comparable to the literature. In 2021, the ISI was validated in family caregivers of adults 
with dementia.28 Individual items from the ISI were included to describe different aspects of 
sleep difficulty among caregivers.

Anxiety.—Caregiver anxiety symptoms were measured using the validated 7-item 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale.29 Caregivers were asked how often they 
experienced anxiety symptoms over the previous 2 weeks, with response categories of 
“not at all” (0), “several days” (1), “more than half the days” (2), and “nearly every day” 
(3). Total scores range from 0-21 with scores of 5-9 representing mild anxiety, 10-14 
representing moderate anxiety, and 15 or more representing severe anxiety; a score of 
10 or more warrants treatment.29 The GAD-7 has demonstrated good internal consistency 
(Cronbach’s α = .92) and test-retest reliability (ICC = .83).29 In our sample, the internal 
consistency of the GAD-7 (Cronbach’s α = .90) was comparable to the literature.

Depression.—Caregiver depression symptoms were measured using the validated 9-
item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).30,31 Caregivers were asked how often they 
experienced 9 depression symptoms, with response categories of “not at all” (0), “several 
days” (1), “more than half the days” (2), and “nearly every day” (3). Total scores range from 
0 to 27, with scores of 10 or more indicating moderate to severe depression symptoms.32 
The PHQ-9 has demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α =.89) and test-retest 
reliability (ICC = .74).33 In our sample, the internal consistency of the PHQ-9 (Cronbach’s 
α = .91) was comparable to the literature.

Caregiver burden.—Caregiver burden was measured using the validated34 7-item brief 
version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI-7), which includes questions about caregiver 
strain and effects on relationships, caregiver health, work, and more.34 Total scores range

0-28 based on individual responses using a 5-point Likert scale (from 0, “never,” to 4, 
“nearly always”). Higher total scores indicate greater burden. The ZBI-7 has good internal 
consistency (Cronbach’s α = .83) and moderate inter-rater reliability (ICC = .51).34 In our 
sample, the internal consistency of the ZBI-7 (Cronbach’s α = .90) was comparable to the 
literature.

Quality of Life.—Quality-of-life was measured using the validated 4-item Caregiver 
Quality-of-life Index-Revised (CQLI-R), which assesses QOL overall and in 4 domains 
(emotional, social, physical, financial QOL) with self-reported ratings from 0 (low) to 10 
(high).35,36 The tool has demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability (rs = .912, P < .001) for 
the total score and for individual items and good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .77 
and .71).35,36 In our sample, the internal consistency of the CQLI-R (Cronbach’s α = .87) 
was comparable to the literature.

Caregiver health.—Caregivers were asked to rate their own health on a 5-point Likert 
scale (from poor to excellent). Self-rated health is a strong predictor of morbidity37–40 and 
mortality.39–43 An item from the ZBI-7 that assesses burden of caregiving on caregiver 
health was also included for descriptive purposes.

Data Analysis

Results

Given the exploratory nature of this study, we used descriptive statistics to examine 
the demographic characteristics of caregivers with and without insomnia symptoms. We 
examined frequencies for categorical variables and mean, standard deviation, median, and 
range for continuous variables. In addition to examining descriptive statistics, we performed 
multiple bivariate hypothesis tests to determine demographic differences between caregivers 
above and below the insomnia threshold and relationships between caregivers’ insomnia 
symptoms and other mental health and quality of life measures. When appropriate, due to 
departure from normality of some of our continuous variables, we used Wilcoxon tests to 
determine mean differences between the insomnia and no insomnia groups, otherwise we 
used T-tests, and for categorical variables, we used Fisher’s exact tests.

Hospice family caregivers in our sample (N = 57) were mostly non-Hispanic (93%), White 
race (68%), female (72%), partnered or married (60%), with a mean age 55 years old. 
Forty-two percent of caregivers had a college education or more, 40% finished some college 
or trade school, 46% were retired or unemployed while 44% were employed full-time, and 
43% had an annual household income of $70,000 or more. Most caregivers were caring for 
a parent (44%) or spouse/partner (30%), co-resided with the patient (58%), administered 
the patient’s medication (64%), and did not have paid caregiving support (79%). Other 
demographic and contextual variables are listed in Table 1. Bivariate analyses indicated only 
one significant demographic or contextual difference between caregivers with and without 
insomnia symptoms: caregivers with insomnia symptoms in our sample cared for slightly 
younger patients (66.1 years vs 72.4 years).

For hospice family caregivers overall, the mean ISI score was 8.2, indicating insomnia 
symptoms for the population overall (Table 2). When dichotomizing the sample using an 
ISI cut-off score of 8, 49.1% of caregivers reported having clinically meaningful insomnia 
symptoms. When considering individual items of the ISI, we found 54% of caregivers with 
insomnia symptoms reported moderate to severe difficulty falling asleep (32% caregivers 
overall); 68% of caregivers with insomnia symptoms reported moderate to severe difficulty 
staying asleep (35% caregivers overall); and 57% of caregivers with insomnia symptoms 
reported moderate to severe difficulty waking too early (28% caregivers overall). We also 
found 50% of hospice family caregivers with insomnia symptoms were “dissatisfied” or 
“very dissatisfied” with their current sleep pattern (26% caregivers overall). Almost all 
caregivers with insomnia symptoms (96%) reported their sleep problem was noticeable to 
others in terms of impairing the caregiver’s quality of life (65% caregivers overall). Over 
half (57%) of caregivers with insomnia symptoms reported feeling “somewhat” to “very 
much” worried/distressed about their current sleep problem (29% caregivers overall) while 
93% reported their current sleep interfered with daily functioning (eg, daytime fatigue, 
mood, concentration, ability to function) (60% caregivers overall). For Item 10 of the ZBI, 
54% of caregivers with insomnia reported “sometimes” to “nearly always” feeling their 
personal health has suffered because of their involvement with the care-recipient (32% 
caregivers overall).

Caregivers with insomnia symptoms reported significantly worse outcomes than caregivers 
without insomnia symptoms (Table 3). Compared to caregivers without insomnia, caregivers 
with insomnia reported 2.4 times greater mean anxiety scores (4.7, mild anxiety vs 11.4, 
moderate anxiety); 3.5 times greater mean depression scores (3.1, no depression vs 10.7, 
moderate depression); 2.1 times greater caregiver burden scores (5.6 vs 11.8); and 1.3 
times lower self-rated health (3.5 vs 2.8). Compared to caregivers without insomnia, 
caregivers with insomnia reported 1.3 times lower total QOL scores (29.3 vs 22.6); including 
significant differences in emotional QOL (7.9 vs 2.2), social QOL (7.2 vs 3.0), and physical 
QOL (7.4 vs 5.3). Caregivers did not differ by financial QOL (7.2 vs 6.1).

Discussion

In our study of 57 hospice family caregivers, we found high prevalence of insomnia 
symptoms: nearly half (49.1%) experienced insomnia symptoms. Caregivers with and 
without insomnia symptoms did not differ demographically or across social determinants 
of caregiving such as income, education, marital status, and paid caregiving assistance. In 
the United States, 10-25% of adults have insomnia44 with 9.5% estimated to have short-term 
insomnia, often precipitated by acute experiences such as situational stress or caregiving.45 
Evidence suggests caregivers continue to be at risk for poor sleep even after caregiving 
ceases,46,47 in some cases for up to 10 years post-caregiving,47 as about one in 5 cases of 
short-term insomnia becomes chronic.45 In our sample, half of caregivers with insomnia 
symptoms were dissatisfied with their current sleep, highlighting a major problem that 
clinicians must address.

Previous research indicates hospice family caregivers experience greater prevalence of 
anxiety and depression compared to non-caregivers.10,13,32,48 In one recent study, for

example, 32% of hospice family caregivers reported moderate to severe anxiety and 32% 
reported moderate to severe depression,10 reflecting major challenges associated with 
terminal caregiving. In our study, we found caregivers with insomnia symptoms had 2.4 
times greater anxiety scores and 3.5 times greater depression scores than hospice family 
caregivers without insomnia, indicating caregivers with sleep difficulties are at particularly 
high risk for debilitating mood changes and altered coping strategies. Although correlational 
not causal, these findings further support the dysregulation model of sleep, which guided our 
study.24 In addition, our findings support Washington et al.’s study that found hospice family 
caregivers’ sleep problems and anxiety symptoms were strongly correlated.13 In the same 
study, higher levels of caregiver anxiety and more frequent sleep problems were associated 
with poorer overall caregiver health.13

Consistent with research about negative health effects associated with sleep 
disorders,2,16–19,39 hospice family caregivers with insomnia symptoms in our study rated 
their health significantly lower than caregivers without insomnia and over half (54%) 
reported feeling their own health had suffered due to caregiving. Given self-rated health 
predicts morbidity and mortality40 and acute insomnia may become chronic, clinicians 
and policy makers should be concerned about family hospice family caregivers’ current 
and future mental and physical health needs. Left unaddressed, poor caregiver mental and 
physical health will increasingly burden the health system.

Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that insomnia symptoms were associated with 
lower quality of life in our sample of hospice family caregivers. These findings are 
consistent with other studies of caregivers for those with cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and 
Parkinson’s disease that found poor sleep quality was associated with poorer quality of 
life.49,50 These findings differ from one study that found no direct relationship between 
sleep disturbances and quality of life among caregivers providing care for a range of 
chronic illnesses.16 Potential reasons for discrepant findings are that we looked specifically 
at insomnia symptoms, which may be more directly related to quality of life and the 
association between sleep disturbances and quality of life may be more pronounced in 
hospice family caregivers.

Furthermore, our analysis supported our hypothesis that insomnia symptoms would be 
associated with caregiver burden. These findings are consistent with other studies that found 
sleep disturbances (eg, awakenings in the night) were associated with caregiver burden.51,52 
Almost 70% of our sample with insomnia symptoms reported difficulty staying asleep. 
Nighttime awakenings have been reported to be the most difficult insomnia symptom, 
as caregiving demands in the night may be prolonged and even emotionally charged.53 
Therefore, it is no surprise that hospice caregivers reporting insomnia symptoms also report 
higher caregiver burden.

To support hospice family caregivers’ caregiving efforts, prevent and treat caregiver mood 
disorders, and enable caregiver wellbeing it is critical that clinicians evaluate insomnia 
symptoms, modifiable factors that perpetuate insomnia (such as anxiety, compromised 
coping, and inadequate overnight caregiving support), and caregiver health.24 Community-
based hospice nurses are well-positioned to assess caregiver sleep and mental and physical

health needs and collaborate with clinicians to refer caregivers to appropriate treatment. 
Because less than 15% of insomnia patients overall consult a healthcare provider or 
receive treatment54 and most hospice family caregivers are fearful of or reluctant to take 
sleep medication,12 behavioral treatment for caregiver insomnia is recommended. Cognitive 
behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), the most effective treatment for caregiver sleep 
disorders, is advised.1,55 Given that caregivers are faced with many demands, and accessing 
CBT-I providers may be challenging, brief behavioral therapies may also be beneficial. For 
example, a brief behavioral sleep intervention for caregivers of people with cancer was 
found to improve sleep quality and decrease depressive symptoms compared to a control 
group.56 Furthermore, more simplified strategies such as respite care at night should be 
explored to improve caregiver sleep.

This study has limitations. First, due to its cross-sectional study design, we cannot make 
causal or temporal associations between insomnia symptoms and caregiver health outcomes. 
Second, our sample was limited in size due to the survey being delivered in the later 
stage of the parent study’s enrollment period; as such, power may have been limited.57–59 
For example, evidence suggests co-residing caregivers are more likely to have sleep 
difficulties.20,60 In our study, 70% of caregivers who co-reside had insomnia symptoms yet 
caregivers with and without insomnia symptoms did not statistically differ in their distance 
from the care-recipient (P = .06), possibly due to small sample size. Furthermore, we did not 
have information on the health of the caregiver prior to serving as a caregiver. Our sample 
was predominantly White and non-Hispanic, limiting generalizability. That said, our study 
had several strengths, including a validated measure of insomnia symptoms and various 
health outcome measures. Additionally, this is one of the first studies to empirically explore 
sleep and health outcome relationships in hospice family caregivers.

Conclusion

Findings from this study indicate high prevalence of insomnia symptoms and poor 
satisfaction with sleep among hospice family caregivers. Compared to hospice family 
caregivers without insomnia, caregivers with insomnia symptoms reported significantly 
higher severity of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and caregiver burden; and 
lower QOL and self-rated health. Clinicians should explicitly screen caregivers for insomnia 
symptoms, anxiety and depression, paying close attention to caregivers who report sleeping 
poorly. Furthermore, future research is needed to develop and implement interventions that 
better support the sleep needs, mental and emotional health needs, and physical health needs 
of family and friends providing care for seriously ill, dying persons. Policy makers must 
expand hospice benefits to include greater social and clinical supports for hospice family 
caregivers, including mental and physical health assessments, behavioral interventions such 
as CBT-I for sleep health, and overnight respite care.
