Abstract: Background and Objectives: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition
worldwide. The limited effectiveness of current psychological and pharmacological treatments has
motivated studies on meditation techniques. This study is a comprehensive, multiple-treatments meta-
analysis comparing the effectiveness of different categories of meditation in treating PTSD. Methods
and Materials: We followed Prisma guidelines in our published protocol to search major databases
and to conduct a meta-analysis of the studies. Results: We located 61 studies with 3440 subjects and
divided them logically into four treatment groups: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR, 13
studies); Mindfulness-Based Other techniques (MBO, 16 studies), Transcendental Meditation (TM,
18 studies), and Other Meditations that were neither mindfulness nor TM (OM, 14 studies). Trauma
populations included war veterans, war refugees, earthquake and tsunami victims, female survivors
of interpersonal violence, clinical nurses, male and female prison inmates, and traumatized students.
Of those offered, 86% were willing to try meditation. The baseline characteristics of subjects were
similar across meditation categories: mean age = 52.2 years, range 29–75; sample size = 55.4, range
5–249; % males = 65.1%, range 0–100; and maximum study duration = 13.2 weeks, range 1–48. There
were no significant differences between treatment categories on strength of research design nor
evidence of publication bias. The pooled mean effect sizes in Hedges’s g for the four categories were
MBSR = −0.52, MBO = −0.66, OM = −0.63, and TM = −1.13. There were no appreciable differences
in the study characteristics of research conducted on different meditations in terms of the types
of study populations included, outcome measures, control conditions, gender, or length of time
between the intervention and assessment of PTSD. TM’s effect was significantly larger than for each
of the other categories, which did not differ from each other. No study reported serious side effects.
Conclusions: All categories of meditation studied were helpful in mitigating symptoms of PTSD. TM
produced clinically significant reductions in PTSD in all trauma groups. We recommend a multisite
Phase 3 clinical trial to test TM’s efficacy compared with standard treatment.

1. Introduction

The Problem. Traumas from any source may stretch an individual’s physical and
mental adaptive resources beyond their ability for timely recovery, causing Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) [1]. PTSD symptoms include hyper-arousal (looking out for threats),
dissociative reactions (flashbacks) that make one feel like the traumatic event is happening

again, nightmares that can cause people to wake up suddenly, sometimes kicking and
screaming, and insomnia. Physical signs can include increased heart rate, rapid breathing,
muscle tension, pupil dilation, or increased blood pressure. Affected persons may have
difficulty concentrating, and PTSD is co-morbid with other conditions such as major
depression, anxiety, substance abuse, poor physical health, and suicide. Other symptoms
include avoiding reminders: avoiding places or situations that bring back memories of
the trauma; changes in behavior: withdrawing from friends and family or keeping busy
to avoid talking about the event; loss of interest: losing interest in activities one used to
enjoy; and substance misuse: trying to cope with feelings by misusing alcohol or drugs. It
is clear that PTSD takes a severe toll on the mental, physical, and financial wellbeing of
veterans, civilians, and their families [2]. A national survey found that major depression is
3 to 5 times more likely in those with PTSD [3]. These symptoms of PTSD unfortunately
degrade the quality of life of individuals, their families, and communities throughout the
world, resulting in suicide, substance abuse, divorce, child and marital neglect and abuse,
and community disruption.

Prevalence. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.9% of the global
population experiences PTSD at some point in their life [4]. This means that for the current
world population of 8.2 billion, 320 million people, which is approximately the population
of the U.S., will suffer from PTSD during their lifetime. PTSD affects approximately 6%
to 7% of adults in the U.S. over their lifespan [5]. In the U.S., there are conservatively
over 1 million veterans suffering from PTSD today. The total number of those afflicted
balloons to over 10 million if civilians are included. The incidence is greater in veterans and
active-duty military personnel, estimated to affect 14% of those who were deployed in wars
in Afghanistan and Iraq [6]. Estimates of lifetime prevalence of PTSD for military personnel
range from 10% to 29% [7]. This is an enormous unsolved public health problem, and it
needs to be quickly resolved to bring much needed relief to this huge suffering population.
Treatment. Current treatments are typically pharmaceuticals along with one or more
forms of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). A study of 186,240 VA patients with PTSD
found that 80.1% had been prescribed psychiatric medications [8]. Another study found that
approximately half (47%) receive psychiatric prescriptions. Pharmaceuticals can be targeted
toward symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, and nightmares. Particularly,
anti-depressants designed to increase the levels of serotonin in the body have been used.
Serotonin has a role to play in learning, memory, and happiness, as well as regulating body
temperature, sleep, sexual behavior, and hunger. Insufficient serotonin is thought to play
a role in depression, anxiety, mania, and other health conditions. Research indicates that
the consumption of psychotropic drugs was not adequately monitored [9]. It is generally
recognized that there is no drug or drug cocktail that is specific for or can effectively
cure PTSD.

The most frequently studied psychotherapies for military-related PTSD are Cognitive
Processing Therapy (CPT) and Prolonged Exposure (PE) [10,11]. A number of other studies
looking at “real world” effectiveness have shown that many veterans find the “best” treat-
ments intolerably uncomfortable, with completion rates of 10% or less [12–14]. Moreover,
about half of the veterans with PTSD do not seek treatment. Of the half that do seek
treatment, only half of them get “minimally adequate” treatment. In one study, only 10%
of patients had at least 12 therapy visits in the 6 months following diagnosis [9]. But even
those who receive the best available treatment all too often are still not adequately served.
A 35-year review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1980 to 2015 found that the
two CBT treatments regarded as the “gold standard” at that time, i.e., Prolonged Exposure
(PE) and Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), were inadequately efficacious; two-thirds
of veterans with PTSD treated with PE or CPT retained their diagnosis after completing
treatment [10,13,14]. Eye Movement Desensitization and Restructuring (EMDR) has also
shown consistent reduction of symptoms of PTSD with the completion of 12–16 60 min
weekly sessions [11].

The limitations in effectiveness and tolerability of the most frequently employed
PTSD treatments all too often leave veterans in the unsatisfactory position of fending for
themselves. That is, many patients cannot tolerate reliving their traumatic experiences
and simply refuse to participate in trauma-focused therapy. Moreover, patients may be
limited by access to a therapist who has been trained in trauma-focused therapy, even if
they are willing to undergo it, as well as by cost and/or insurance coverage [11]. There is
a need to identify more effective and life-supporting treatments for veterans [10]. These
considerations raise “important practical questions, particularly the value of emotionally
demanding therapies, such as PE and CPT, relative to comparably efficacious and more tol-
erable interventions, such as PCT (Present Centered Therapy), Transcendental Meditation,
and “sertraline”, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [15]. A variety of essentially non-
trauma focused meditation practices have been considered and hold enormous promise in
the treatment of PTSD [16,17].

Meditation in the Treatment of PTSD

The first study to use a meditation technique to treat PTSD (then called post-Vietnam
adjustment) was Brooks and Scarano, 1985, conducted at the Veterans Outreach Program
in Denver Colorado [18]. It compared TM and psychotherapy over 3 months for Vietnam
veterans. The effects were strong for a broad array of outcomes (PTSD symptoms, anxiety,
depression, drug and alcohol use, job and family life). The study was small and was not
followed up for two decades. Before 1985, there had been 15 years of research on TM, which
began in 1970 with Wallace et al.’s publication of TM’s physiological effects in Science [19],
the American Journal of Physiology [20], and Scientific American [21], and Orme-Johnson’s
study in Psychosomatic Medicine [22]. Wallace found that the physiological changes during
TM were in the opposite direction from the “Fight or Flight’” stress response. Orme-Johnson
found that TM reduced baseline levels of stress markers during meditation and that it
changed the response to stress outside of meditation to fewer multiple stress responses
and more rapid recovery from the stressor. By 1985, these studies had been complemented
by 350 additional studies on TM showing its metabolic, biochemical, cardiovascular, and
electroencephalographic changes, and its benefits for physiological efficiency and stability,
cardiovascular and general health, motor and perceptual ability, athletic performance,
prison and drug rehabilitation, productivity, and quality of life [23,24]. Today there are
over 750 scientific papers on TM [25–28].

The next major step in the use of meditation as a treatment in psychology and health
started in 1979 when Jon Kabat-Zinn began teaching Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
(MBSR) at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. He created a standardized
protocol for teaching mindfulness, MBSR, which facilitated research. This research began
in 1982 with Kabat-Zinn’s preliminary study of mindfulness for chronic pain [29] and
became a popular concept with the publication of his book in 1990 [30]. Although initially
developed for stress management, it has evolved to encompass the treatment of a variety of
health-related disorders. Between 1966 and 2021, there were over 16,000 studies published
related to mindfulness, with the number of publications increasing by an average of 23.5%
per year from 2010 to 2020 [31].

“Mindfulness”, even the manualized MBSR, is a heterogenous approach with many
components, not a single practice, and so far there has been few research studies on which
of the components are the “active ingredients”. Moreover, a reviewer [32] pointed out that
“the currently applied mindfulness-based interventions show large differences in the way
mindfulness is conceptualized and practiced. . . [There is an] absence of consensus about an
operational definition of ‘mindfulness’. Finally, it is noteworthy that the word ‘mindfulness’
is frequently used as a construct, a mental state, or as a number of practices designed
to achieve this state, raising concerns as to what current studies are actually measuring
when they claim they are measuring mindfulness and as to what exactly practitioners
are doing when they are practicing modern mindfulness-based interventions”. In short,
“mindfulness” does not currently meet fundamental criteria required by science that can be

Medicina 2024, 60, 2050

clearly defined and operationalized [33]. Nevertheless, many studies have reported the
effectiveness of mindfulness-based programs.

In 2014, the Mental Health Services of the Department of Veterans Services commis-
sioned the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester to conduct a multisite
Meditation for PTSD Demonstration Project, headed by Dr. Kathi Heffner [17]. The current
meta-analysis includes all these studies as well as all others that used a treatment identified
as meditation found in a systematic search of the literature. The goal of this meta-analysis
is to assess the effectiveness of various meditation techniques in the treatment of PTSD.

2. Methods and Materials

Our methodology was published in the Prospero International prospective register of
systematic reviews, National Institute of Health and Care Research [34]. We conducted a
multiple-treatments meta-analysis (Cochrane, 16.6.3) [35] that directly and indirectly com-
pared the within-groups effects of four different categories of meditation using the Com-
prehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) program Version 4, Meta-Regression 2 programs [36].

Searches. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses guidelines for 2020 (Prisma, https://www.prisma.io/ (accessed on 3 December
2024)), we searched for papers in English, published and unpublished, on the use of medi-
tation approaches for treating PTSD. Searches were made in major databases (MEDLINE,
PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Library of Congress, and Google Scholar), as well as
the bibliographies of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, original research papers, and
research anthologies and databases of meditation research, from January 1970 through June
2024. The search included references in the most recent meta-analyses on meditation and
PTSD, Hilton et al., 2017 [37], which reported 10 RCTs, and Gallegos et al., 2017 [16], which
included 19 studies. We also asked colleagues in the field for relevant papers. A Prisma
flow chart was constructed documenting the results of the literature search. Search terms
included “Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction”, “MBSR”, “Transcendental Meditation”,
“TM”, “mindfulness”, and “meditation”.

Participant populations. We included all participants diagnosed with PTSD, all types
of traumas, all age groups, all gender identifications, all ethnicities, and all countries. When
data were missing on age, we used the mean age of their meditation category. This was for
the purpose of multiple meta-regression analysis, in which one study with missing data
would reduce the N for all comparisons. We included studies conducted on populations
from VA facilities, refugee camps, prisons, medical clinics, school counseling services, and
all other facilities providing treatment for PTSD.

Types of studies included. We included all longitudinal research designs that mea-
sured change over time that have sufficient data to enable calculation of effect sizes and
variances at each measurement period. This included Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs).
We also included Controlled Trials (CTs) that were not randomized, and Single Group
case series studies, which are single groups who underwent instruction in the intervention
without a comparison or control group and were measured multiple times, at baseline and
with at least one posttest.

Studies not included. When studies were reported in two or more publications, we
used the latest publication. Heffner et al., 2014 Syracuse [17] was not used because it
overlaps with Polusny et al., 2015 [38], which we did use. We did not include studies
that did not report enough data that could be used to calculate or derive g (e.g., Bremner
et al., 2011 [39], Ge et al., 2020 [40]). Malaktaris et al., 2022 [41] was not used because
it was a hierarchal multiple regression analysis of subjects in Bormann et al., 2013 [42],
and 2018 [43], not a study of change in PTSD due to a meditation treatment. Mistry et al.,
2020 [44] (Virtual Reality Meditation, VRM) was not used because PTSD symptoms were
used only to classify subjects. No longitudinal results of the effects of VRM on PTSD were
reported. Nicotera et al., 2020 [45] was not used due to lack of data: “our study did not have
access to direct measures of PTSD”. Sullivan et al., 2021 [46] was not used because of lack of

Medicina 2024, 60, 2050

data. The abstract reported that “The sample size was insufficient for inferential analysis and the
data for some participants was not collected at all-time points”.

Screening. Two authors (DOJ, JT) working independently conducted the data searches,
with updated searches made in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Two authors (DOJ, BR)
independently coded studies for implementation statistics. Two authors (DOJ and VB)
independently coded studies for research quality on the modified Clear Score scale. Data
for calculating effect sizes and meta-regression were coded by DOJ and independently
proofed by Rhoda Orme-Johnson, a professional proofreader. Any discrepancies between
coders were discussed and resolved with reference to the original text in the papers.

Treatments. The four classifications of meditation treatment groups were defined

as follows:

2.

1. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a manualized program with several
components, involving both focused attention (Breath Awareness Meditation) and
open monitoring practices, as well as yoga, retreats, and other components [30,47,48].
The Transcendental Meditation technique (TM) falls in the category of automatic self-
transcending [49]. It is a standardized meditation technique from the Vedic tradition
of India brought to the West by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the 1950s [50–52]. TM is
described as a simple, natural, effortless process of transcending from active mind
to the silent mind. During TM, the mind is automatically drawn inward towards
increasing levels of charm to arrive at a state of restful alertness, transcendental
consciousness, a unique fourth state of consciousness that transcends the meditation
process itself, hence the name “automatic self-transcending” [49].

3. Mindfulness Based Other (MBO) techniques are meditations that identify themselves as
mindfulness, or have been derived directly from MBSR, but are not specifically MBSR.
4. Other Meditations (OMs) are techniques described as meditation but are neither
TM nor mindfulness. Descriptions of the specific techniques can be found in the
papers cited.

Mindfulness and TM were chosen for analysis because the most meditation research
has been conducted on these two modalities [53]. OM was included to have all types of
treatments called “meditation” in our meta-analysis. These meditations were all mental
techniques. We did not include related physical techniques such as yoga asanas, although
MBSR and some meditation programs include a yoga component.

Comparator(s)/control. We report the within-group effects of the four categories of
meditation on treating PTSD. This provides a direct comparison of the different meditation
categories without being obscured by the effects of controls. The “controls” were the three
other categories of meditation to which each category was compared.

Measures of PTSD. Total PTSD symptoms were measured by the PCL symptoms
checklist or measures equivalent to the PCL, such as the Clinician-Administered PTSD
Scale (CAPS). The PCL is now a 20-item questionnaire (previously 17 items), corresponding
to the DSM-5 symptom criteria for PTSD. The PCL is the most widely used measure of
PTSD, and we use it for primary analysis because that allows inclusion of all studies in
our meta-analysis. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), a semi-structured
interview for determining PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity, was reported in only
about half the studies. When only Cohen’s d was reported, we converted d into g, where
the conversion of d to g is g = d times a correction factor J; J = 1 − 3/(4df − 1) [54].

Special cases of computing effects. When the PCL was not reported, we converted
other measures on PTSD symptoms into g. Azad and Morteza, 2014 [55] reported d for
the total quality of life score, which we converted to g. For Christopher et al., 2018 [56],
which reports on police being treated with mindfulness meditation (REP-MM), we used
the composite of measures of alcohol consumption, anxiety, depression, sleep difficulties,
and suicidal ideation reported in the paper as the measure of PTSD. Omidi et al., 2013 [57]
reported on veterans in Iran with PTSD, but PTSD was not measured pre-post. Six moods
were measured (anger, dizziness, depression, fatigue, tension, and vitality), and we entered
all of them in the analysis and used the g for the average change as the PTSD score. For

Medicina 2024, 60, 2050

6 of 29

Kim et al., 2013 [58] on nurses, we used the N, t, and p reported in the paper to calculate
g. For Somohano et al., 2022 [59], PCL was not included because the authors reported it
was not significant. We used the mean of the d’s given for the Emotional Tone measures,
sadness, disgust, fear, and anger, then converted d to g. If the SDs were not reported, we
estimated the SE (standard error) from other studies; that is, SE = 0.350.

Other statistics reported. In addition to pooled effects of g, we reported 95% confi-
dence limits, using the random-effects model. Results are presented in forest plots with
associated statistics on the summary effects across studies, weighted by inverse variance.
The dispersion of effect sizes from study to study, the heterogeneity, measured by the
prediction interval, is a major focus. Combining studies within subgroups, we did not
assume a common among-study variance component across subgroups. We did not pool
within-group estimates of tau-square. This is the option used by RevMan and the CMA
software tool Version 4 used in this meta-analysis [35]. We used the fixed-effects model to
combine subgroups to yield an overall effect.

We also extracted data and made tables on study characteristics, which included the
location of the study, population type, trauma type, comparator or control, PTSD and other
measures used, age, gender, sample size, longest follow-up, notes, and implementation
outcomes, such as rate learned vs. offered and the rate of subjects completing the course.
Risk of bias (quality) assessment. Study quality was assessed by using a modified
15-item CLEAR score check list [60] assessing potential bias related to provider competence,
non-parallel design, non-equivalent groups, and incomplete meditation learning and
practice. The CLEAR score was the total number of items answered “Yes”. We also scored
the studies using a 7-item CLEAR2 scale of research quality items that do not involve a
control group. This was because two within-group analysis studies in this meta-analysis are
the pretest to posttest effects on the treatment groups with no reference to control groups.
Meta-Regression. Regression analysis is a set of statistical methods used for estimating
the relationships between an outcome (dependent) variable and a predictor (independent)
variable. For example, in our meta-analysis, the dependent variable is the effectiveness
of meditation techniques, as measured by the effect size of recovery from PTSD from
pretest to posttest, expressed in Hedges’s g units. We wanted to know if moderator
variables influenced the effectiveness of meditation on PTSD. Did the different types of
meditation—MBO, MBSR, OM, and TM—have different effect sizes? What are the effects
of age? Are younger subjects more responsive to meditation than older subjects? Does
meditation have different effects on different trauma groups? For example, how much do
combat soldiers, earthquake victims, war refugees, prison inmates, and intimate partner
violence (IPV) survivors benefit from meditation therapy? What are the effect sizes of
military personnel vs. civilians? Does research design (Randomized Controlled Trials
(RCTs), Controlled Trials (CTs), Single Group) or research quality, study duration, baseline
PTSD, or % males in the study modify effect sizes? To answer these questions, we used the
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V4, Meta-Regression 2 program [61].

Outliers. Two studies of the sixty-one studies in our meta-analysis had effects large
enough to be considered as outliers. These were Rees et al., 2013 and 2014 [62,63], discussing
the effects of TM on Congolese war refugees with PTSD in Uganda. The effects of g = −5.23
and −2.84 were three to five times larger than the mean effect of all other studies, large
enough to distort statistical analyses. We omitted these studies from the main analysis
but studied their effects. With these two outliers included, the overall effect of TM was g
(SE) −1.31 (0.11), which was reduced to −1.13 (0.09) when outliers were excluded. The
one-study-removed analysis found that removing Rees et al., 2013 [62] decreased the overall
summary effect of TM from −1.31 to −1.19, with a p-value that was essentially zero.

The outliers increased indicators of heterogeneity. A key indicator of heterogeneity
is the prediction interval, which shows the range of true effect sizes of 95% of all future
studies on comparable populations. The inclusion of the outlier expanded the range of the
prediction interval on the upper and lower ends. With the outliers included, the upper
limit to lower limit was −2.32 to −0.30, a span of −2.02. Without the outliers, the span

Medicina 2024, 60, 2050

7 of 29

was −1.89 to −0.38, a span of 1.5, a reduction in the span by 25% by eliminating those
two studies. I2, the measure of the between-group variance that reflects true differences
between studies rather than sampling error, decreased from I2 = 91.28% with the outliers
included to 86.17% with the outliers excluded. There was still a large amount of between-
study variance needing explanation, which we addressed with meta-regression.

3. Results

Literature Search. Databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Library
of Congress, and Google Scholar) were searched for keywords “Mindfulness-Based Stress
Reduction”, “MBSR”, “Transcendental Meditation”, “TM”, “mindfulness”, and “medita-
tion” from January 1970 to June 2024. These searches identified 9963 records on meditation.
Of these, 8938 were excluded because they were not on PTSD or trauma or otherwise did
not meet our study inclusion criteria. Titles and abstracts of 1025 records were obtained
for screening, of which 907 were excluded, leaving 119 papers sought for retrieval and
assessment for eligibility. The 119 records assessed for eligibility resulted in 62 records
being excluded, because 14 were reviews, 8 were theoretical papers, and 14 records were
not intervention studies on meditation. For example, they were feasibility studies on the
use of meditation to treat PTSD or were cross-sectional studies, such as on the rate of PTSD
in different populations or were correlational studies between the level of PTSD in people
with different psychological or psychosocial characteristics, such as differences in qualities
of mindfulness. Such studies, although of interest, did not address the issue of the efficacy
of meditation as a treatment for PTSD and thus were excluded. The 26 others of the 118
were excluded because they were studies of the effects of other types of interventions in
treating PTSD rather than meditation, such as trauma focus techniques, cognitive process-
ing, hypnosis, hatha yoga, pharmaceuticals, or games. This left 57 studies from the searches
of databases, which, with the addition of 4 TM studies identified via other sources, i.e., the
Collected Papers on TM, resulted in a total of 61 studies included in our review.

Collected Papers on TM, which is on the righthand column in the flow diagram,
refers to Volumes 1–8 of Scientific Research on the Transcendental Meditation and TM-
Sidhi programs 23–28. These volumes, which span 1970 to 2013, contain 678 records. Of
these, six records were on “PTSD” or “posttraumatic”, four met the inclusion criteria of
a longitudinal intervention study on PTSD, which, added to the 57 studies identified via
databases, resulted in 61 studies included in our meta-analysis.

These 61 studies were then logically divided into four categories of meditation, in-
cluding the two categories that are uniformly defined, Transcendental Meditation (TM)
and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). The first of the other two categories
was Mindfulness-Based Other (MBO), which are mindfulness-based techniques but not
MBSR. MBO techniques were often derived from MBSR but did not follow the MBSR
protocol. MBO techniques often experimented with different lengths of training, mode
of presentation (such as via telecommunications), or with additional techniques, such as
Hatha Yoga. The fourth category of meditation was Other Meditations (OMs), which were
neither TM nor MBSR nor MBO. Examples of OMs include compassion meditation, Kriya
yoga, Adapted Mantra Meditation, and Mantram Repetition meditation.

Data were then extracted from these 61 papers on study characteristics, such as
experimental design, type of treatment, number of subjects, type of trauma, location of
treatment, etc. Implementation statistics were also coded, such as the number of people
offered meditation, number and percent who learned, number and percent who were
post-tested, etc. In addition, data from the papers needed for calculating effect sizes were
entered into the meta-analysis and multivariate regression analysis program 35. Figure 1
displays the results of our literature search, which located 61 studies that used meditation
to treat PTSD, 16 studies on MBO, 13 on MBSR, 14 on OM, and 18 on TM.

Study Characteristics and Implementation Statistics. Table S1: Study Characteristics
and Implementation Statistics for all Studies contains tables with the statistics of each of the
studies in these four categories of meditation. There are four tables on study characteristics,
one for each category, which alphabetically are Mindfulness-Based Other Meditation,
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, Other Meditation, and Transcendental Meditation,
and four tables for meditation category with implementation statistics. The tables on
study characteristics show the study identification and the location of where the study was
conducted, the PTSD patient population, the research design (whether RCT, CT, or Single
Group), the control group, the PTSD measures used, the baseline PTSD level on the PCL,
the research quality on the CLEAR Score, mean age of the experimental group, the total
sample size, the % males, and the study duration in weeks.

The tables on implementation statistics display the number of people the program was
offered, the % who learned, number completed, percent completed, number of dropouts,
percent dropouts, number and percent post-tested, and notes, if any.

Table 1 summarizes the study characteristics for each category of meditation: MBO,

MBSR, OM, and TM.

The 61 studies had a total sample size of 3440 subjects: MBO = 636, MBSR = 813,
OM = 743, and TM = 1248. The overall mean (SD) baseline level on the PCL was 52.2
(12.4), which was similar across all categories of meditation. A PCL score of 31–33 or
higher indicates probable PTSD; 40 or higher allows for a provisional diagnosis of PTSD
(if cluster criteria are met) [64,65]. A score of 50 is considered PTSD-positive in military
populations [65]. The range of baseline PCL scores across all studies was from 29 to 75,
ranging from borderline to severe PTSD. It was expected that these populations would
have high levels of PTSD, because for most studies, clinical PTSD was a selection criterion
for inclusion in the study.

The average person in these studies was middle aged (40–60), with an overall mean
age of 46.8 (9.5) years. The mean age was very similar across meditation categories. A few

Figure 1 displays the results of our literature search, which located 61 studies that used meditation to treat PTSD, 16 studies on MBO, 13 on MBSR, 14 on OM, and 18 on TM.  Figure 1. Flow diagram of search of the literature. Study Characteristics and Implementation Statistics. Table S1: Study Characteris-tics and Implementation Statistics for all Studies contains tables with the statistics of each of the studies in these four categories of meditation. There are four tables on study char-acteristics, one for each category, which alphabetically are Mindfulness-Based Other Med-itation, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, Other Meditation, and Transcendental Med-itation, and four tables for meditation category with implementation statistics. The tables on study characteristics show the study identiﬁcation and the location of where the study was conducted, the PTSD patient population, the research design (whether RCT, CT, or Single Group), the control group, the PTSD measures used, the baseline PTSD level on the PCL, the research quality on the CLEAR Score, mean age of the experimental group, the total sample size, the % males, and the study duration in weeks. The tables on implementation statistics display the number of people the program was oﬀered, the % who learned, number completed, percent completed, number of drop-outs, percent dropouts, number and percent post-tested, and notes, if any.

The mean percent of males in the study populations was 65.1%. Across all categories
on meditation, % males ranged from all women (0% males) to 100% males. No non-binary
persons were identified as such in any of the studies. The maximum study durations
ranged from 1 week to almost a year (48 weeks), with the average being 13.1 weeks. In
the section on meta-regression, we present the results of % male and study duration on
effect sizes.

We found that many different populations with PTSD are willing to try meditation.
MBO has been used to treat male and female military personnel, most of whom had
experienced combat, some whom experienced Military Sexual Trauma (MST). Other MBO
studies were conducted with female survivors of trauma, police officers, nurses, students,
women with PTSD plus substance abuse, and patients with ileostomy.

In treating PTSD, MBSR has been used primarily with military personnel, but also
with breast cancer patients, child abuse survivors, women with a history of interpersonal
trauma, and women experiencing PTSD from undisclosed causes. OM has also been used
to treat PTSD in military personnel, including survivors of Military Sexual Trauma, and
experiencing trauma from the sudden death of friends and comrades. OM has also been
used to treat PTSD in traumatized youth in residential care. Most PTSD studies on TM
have also been with military personnel, but it has also been used to treat PTSD in male and
female prison inmates, women survivors of IPV, caregiver nurses, war refugees in Uganda
and Ukraine, earthquake/tsunami victims in Japan, and South African college students.

Implementation Statistics. Table 2 summarizes the implementation statistics for the
four meditation categories, which answers the following questions of the people who
were offered meditation: what was the percentage of people who learned it (started the
course), what percentage completed the course, and what percentage completed post-
testing? Overall, 85% chose to learn, 81% completed the course, and 72% made it through to
post-testing. (Table S1: Study Characteristics and Implementation Statistics for all Studies,
Part 2).

Research Quality. There were 15 research quality items in the CLEAR score (Table S2:
Meditation Modified CLEAR Assessment, which has a worksheet defining the 15 items.)
The research quality items ask such questions as whether the study used validated measures
of PTSD and were the same or equivalent measures used at pretest and posttest. It asked if
the providers of the meditation technique were qualified and skilled, did the study have
systematic follow-up and checking of correct practice of the meditation technique, and was
participant adherence evaluated quantitively. Another modified scale, CLEAR2, was used
to measure research quality on studies that did not involve a control group.

Table S3: Clear Scores for Individual Studies in 4 Categories of Meditation shows
scoring of the individual studies on research quality, as well as t-tests and a graph. The
t-tests found there was no statistically significant difference between the studies in the
meditation categories on research quality scores. The correlations of research quality of the
four meditation categories across the 15 items were all positive and statistically significant,
with r’s ranging from 0.60 to 0.93. This indicates that the strengths and weaknesses of
research quality were similar for MBO, MBSR, OM, and TM. The lack of differences between
types of meditation on research quality indicates that it is unlikely that research bias could
cause differences in their effectiveness.

We note that in this meta-analysis of within-group effects, control groups were not
an issue, because we used within-group standard mean differences pretest to posttest
that do not involve control groups. The “control” groups were the other meditation
categories. However, we did score all studies on CLEAR2, a scale of research quality items
that do not involve a control group. The mean scores on this scale were MBO = 73.3%,
MBSR = 68%, OM = 75.5, and TM = 77%; there were no statistically significant differences
between groups.

Effect sizes of the four categories of meditation. Tables 3–6 display the results for
the 61 studies using the mixed-effects model, which is the appropriate model for studies
known to differ from each other on attributes that could produce true differences between
them (such as type of meditation, age, sample size, study duration, etc.) The statistics
presented are the effect sizes in Hedges’s g units, standard errors, the upper and lower
limits of the 95% confidence intervals, the Z-values, and p-values, as well as the summary
statistics across studies at the bottom of each table. The overall effectiveness, in Hedges’s g
(SE), was moderate for MBO g = −0.66 (0.10), MBSR g = −0.52 (0.05), and OM g = −0.63
(0.07) and large for TM g = −1.13 (0.09).

Table 7 summarizes the results for the mixed-effects model, giving the summary point
values (mean g’s) and associated statistics. The mean effects of all categories of meditation
are highly statistically significant (p < 0.00000001), indicating that all meditation techniques
have real effects on reducing PTSD.

Table 8 shows the prediction interval and other heterogeneity statistics. Fixed effects
are shown in the top half of the table, mixed effects below. In the upper right, “Other Hetero-
geneity Statistics” is essentially an analysis of variance table, which under the fixed-effects
model assumes that differences between studies are only due to random sampling error. Q
statistics indicate the amount of dispersion within the various groups under the fixed-effect

Medicina 2024, 60, 2050

11 of 29

model. The expected value of Q is the degrees of freedom of Q (df(Q)), which is the number
of studies minus 1. It can be seen in Table 8 that for all meditation techniques, the Q’s
are much larger than the df(Qs), indicating that the effect of each technique on decreasing
PTSD is highly statistically significant, as shown by the p-values in the next column. The I2
(upper right in Table 8) indicates that the percentage of variance left unexplained is high
for all categories of meditation, ranging from 56.82% to 86.23%, with 90% overall. We will
explore sources of heterogeneity below using meta-regression analyses.

In the lower section of Table 8, under mixed-effects model, we see the Prediction
Intervals, which are the indicators of heterogeneity. The Prediction Interval (PI) is the
range of effect sizes that future studies on all comparable populations would likely fall
into, if we assume that the true effects are normally distributed in g units. It is a common
error in meta-analyses to believe that I2 is the measure of heterogeneity. It is not. I2
estimates the proportion of unexplained variance. PI estimates the spread of effects of
studies, which is the heterogeneity. It is important to clarify what heterogeneity is in
systematic reviews, because the PI may predict that some treatments are likely to have
adverse effects, something that clinicians need to be aware of, which is not provided by the
I2 statistic [107,108].

In the present meta-analysis, the prediction intervals indicate considerable heterogene-
ity for each of the meditation categories. The lower limits of the PIs show strong effects for
each of the meditation categories, ranging from g = −0.84 for MBSR to −1.89 for TM. The
upper limits of the PIs indicate the least effective results that future studies are likely to find.
These range from −0.38 for TM, indicating that the least effective results of future studies
on TM would be small, to a slightly positive value of 0.08 g for MBO. In this context, where
we are looking for a reduction in PTSD, a positive PI indicates that the meditation technique
may make PTSD worse. However, 0.08 only indicates slightly worse, essentially zero. For
MBSR and OM, the upper limit of their PIs of −0.21 and −0.10, respectively, might indicate
that some future studies are likely to find small effects that are not clinically useful.

The tau is the standard deviation of true effect sizes, and the tau-squared is the
variance. We see that the variances for TM and MBO are approximately the same (0.34 and
0.33, respectively) and that the variance for MBSR and OM is smaller (0.13 and 0.23). This
suggests that there is more variability in the outcomes for TM and MBO. Total between-
groups Q, shown at the bottom of Table 8 (Q = 33.93, df(Q) = 3) indicates that there is a
highly significant difference between the effectiveness of the four meditation categories on
PTSD (p < 0.0000002).

3.1. Meta-Regression

The purpose of meta-regression is to assess what aspects of the research might help
explain the unexplained differences between studies. Five principles behind constructing
the best explanatory model are shown here.

1.

2.

Use the correct model, Random Effects, because these studies are known to differ on
important dimensions, such as meditation treatment, age, type of trauma, research
design, and other items that may influence effect sizes.
Use the simplest model; too many variables will tailor the model to the specific data
set and reduce the generalizability of the model.

3. Maximize the R2 analog, which tells us what proportion of the true between-studies

variance is explained by the model.

4. Minimize the I2, the percent of true between-studies variance that remains unex-

plained after the model is applied.

5. Maximize the statistical significance of the p-values of the components of the model.

Table 9 shows the regression statistics for the significant covariates, arranged from most
predictive power (largest R2) to least. Table 10 shows the predictive power of combining
the covariates into multivariate models by adding one covariate at a time.

In Table 9, it can see seen that Treatment Groups made the largest contribution, with
an R2 = 0.41, followed by Age, Five Trauma groups, and Research Design. R2 became
negligible for Study Duration and Baseline PTSD and zero for Military vs. Civilian, Percent
Males, and Research Quality Score.

Table 10 shows the results of testing one covariate at a time, arranged from the largest
R2 to the smallest. The statistics in each row give the result for that covariate controlling for
the other covariates. For all covariates, the variance inflation factor (VIF) was less than 2.0,
indicating low concern for multi-collinearity, which would negatively impact the precision
of estimating model coefficients [54].

The top row in Table 10 shows the model with the intercept only, no covariates, which
has no predictive power (R2 = 0). All models have the same intercept. The I2 indicates that
89.97% of the true variance remains unexplained with no covariates. Adding Treatment
group (MBO, MBSR, OM, or TM) increased R2 from 0 to 0.41 and decreased I2 from 89.97%
to 83.17%, and showed a change in I2 by −6.80%. Adding all the covariates to the model
one at a time progressively increased R2 to 0.67 and reduced I2 to 72%, as seen at the bottom
row of Table 10. All models were statistically significant at p < 0.0000000001.

the circles are inversely proportional to their variance. Larger circles represent larger

3.3. Subgroup Analysis of Mantram Repetition (MR), MBSR, and TM in the U.S. Military

Mantram Repetition entails choosing a spiritual mantra from a list, such as the Sanskrit
chant of “Om”, “Om Shanti”, or “So Ham”, Christian chants like “Hail Mary” or “Ave
Maria”, or Buddhist chants like “Om Mani Padme Hum” [42,109,110]. We compared studies
on Mantram Meditation (five studies) with the two most-studied meditation programs,
MBSR (eight studies) and TM (eight studies). Mantram Repetition was included because
the multisite demonstration project of meditation recommended it. “We recommend that
meditation programs—and, in particular, the Mantram Repetition Program developed
by Dr. Jill Bormann—are worthy of further in-depth assessment through both rigorously
controlled randomized trials and comparative effectiveness studies [17], p. iii”.

The results (mixed effects, Hedges’s g (95% CI)) were MR −0.75 (−0.97, −0.54),
MBSR −0.55 (−0.69, −0.40), and TM −1.06 (−1.17, −0.94). The between-group Q = 74.42,
df (Q) = 2, and p = 0.0000000, indicating a significant difference between groups. The effect
of TM was significantly larger than for MR (p = 0.015) or MBSR (0.00000008). MBSR and
MR did not differ significantly at the 0.05 level (p = 0.12). Funnel plot analyses found no
evidence of publication bias for all 21 studies together or for MR, MBSR, or TM analyzed
separately. (See Supplementary Materials, Table S6: Military and Civilian Comparisons,
Part 1.)

In comparing the effects of MBSR, TM, and Mantram Repetition in the U.S. military, N
was 38 studies instead of 39, because we excluded the one non-U.S. study on the Israeli
military (Fruchter, 2024 [98]). Subgroup analysis showed excluding Fruchter from the
analysis only changed the effect of TM from 1.06 g to 0.99 g.

4. Discussion

The 61 studies in this meta-analysis (MA) are more than the previous MAs on med-
itation for treating PTSD, which ranged from 8 to 21 studies [16,37,111–113]. Previous
MAs had fewer studies because they included only between-group effects from RCTs,
whereas we included within-group effects from RCTs, CTs, and Single Group studies. Like
previous MAs [16,111,112], we found no appreciable differences in the study characteristics
of research conducted on different meditations in terms of the types of study populations
included, outcome measures, control conditions, gender, or length of time between the
intervention and assessment of PTSD. Previous MAs found no effect of age for mindfulness
meditations [112]. Similarly, our meta-regression found only slight evidence for a larger
effect with younger populations for TM and OM, but no age effects for MBSR or MBO.

Medicina 2024, 60, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 30   Maria”, or Buddhist chants like “Om Mani Padme Hum” [42,109,110]. We compared stud-ies on Mantram Meditation (ﬁve studies) with the two most-studied meditation programs, MBSR (eight studies) and TM (eight studies). Mantram Repetition was included because the multisite demonstration project of meditation recommended it. “We recommend that meditation programs—and, in particular, the Mantram Repetition Program developed by Dr. Jill Bormann—are worthy of further in-depth assessment through both rigorously con-trolled randomized trials and comparative eﬀectiveness studies [17], p. iii.” The results (mixed eﬀects, Hedges’s g (95% CI)) were MR −0.75 (−0.97, −0.54), MBSR −0.55 (−0.69, −0.40), and TM −1.06 (−1.17, −0.94). The between-group Q = 74.42, df (Q) = 2, and p = 0.0000000, indicating a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between groups. The eﬀect of TM was signiﬁcantly larger than for MR (p = 0.015) or MBSR (0.00000008). MBSR and MR did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly at the 0.05 level (p = 0.12). Funnel plot analyses found no evidence of publication bias for all 21 studies together or for MR, MBSR, or TM analyzed separately. (See Supplementary Materials, Table S6: Military and Civilian Comparisons, Part 1.) In comparing the eﬀects of MBSR, TM, and Mantram Repetition in the U.S. military, N was 38 studies instead of 39, because we excluded the one non-U.S. study on the Israeli military (Fruchter, 2024 [98]). Subgroup analysis showed excluding Fruchter from the analysis only changed the eﬀect of TM from 1.06 g to 0.99 g. 3.4.

However, none of these studies were designed to study the effects of age, which we suggest
will be important for future studies. Studies on the effects of age would need to be designed
to have a systematic spread of age groups treated under the same or similar conditions, the
same populations using the same meditation technique.

The pooled mean effect in Hedges’s g for all 61 studies was −0.67, a medium ef-
fect size. For the four categories, they were MBO = −0.66, MBSR = −0.52, OM = −0.63,
and TM = −1.13. These values are based on within-group analyses and are somewhat
larger than those reported in previous meta-analyses because previous ones were based on
between-group analyses. All effect sizes were statistically significant at p < 0.0000001. The
standardized mean difference (SMD) effect sizes for MBO, MBSR, and OM are
medium, indicating that the changes in PTSD symptoms from pretest to posttest were of
moderate magnitude.

The large treatment effect of TM, with a g of approximately 1.0, is also in accord
with previous MAs. The Final Report to the Department of Veterans Affairs on the large
multi-site comparison on meditation techniques for treating military personnel with PTSD
stated “Based on PTSD and other outcomes observed here, Transcendental Meditation™ (TM) may
hold promise as an effective tool for managing PTSD symptoms in Veterans [17], p. 52”. A recent
scoping review said “Meditation and mind–body–spirit interventions such as Transcendental
Meditation have high-quality randomized controlled trials demonstrating equivalent effect sizes and
efficacy to existing evidence-based treatments for PTSD. Transcendental Meditation specifically
appears to have sufficient empirical support to be considered ‘evidence-based’” [114]. A 2022
MA of mantra-based meditations also noted larger effects of TM than other mantra-based
techniques. It reported eight studies on PTSD, four with TM and four with Mantram
Repetition (MR) [115]. It had two analyses of two TM and two MR studies each, which
did not reach statistical significance. However, when we re-analyzed their data in one
analysis of four TM and four MR studies, TM’s effect was significantly larger than MR’s;
p = 0.01. (The results are available from the lead author, DOJ). This MA [115] concluded
“TM seems to produce greater effects than other mantra-based meditations (OMBMs). Some studies
support the need to differentiate TM from OMBM, because TM allows the subject to reach a higher
state of consciousness in which the mantra progressively becomes a secondary experience until its
disappearance” [116], p. 13. TM produces large effects of approximately 1.0, which suggests
that the patient, their family, and attending medical staff are likely to have noticed and
commented on the difference [54].

Our meta-regression found that Treatment Group, Age, Trauma Groups, Research
Design And Military vs. Civilian study populations were significant covariates in the
regression on effect size (Hedges’s g). Yet even the best multivariate meta-regression model
of these variables only reduced the unexplained variance (I2) to 72%. There is still much to
be learned about what factors can enhance the effectiveness of meditation treatments, and
we hope that our study will inspire new avenues of research.

4.1. Differences Among Meditation Techniques

There are many differences between TM and mindfulness-based and other medita-
tion techniques or procedure that could account for TM’s greater effectiveness in treating
posttraumatic stress. Procedurally, there are three different types of meditation: focused
attention, open monitoring, and automatic self-transcending [49]. Meditation procedures
described as “Mindfulness” are either “open monitoring” (OM), the non-reactive moni-
toring of the moment-to-moment content of experience, or focused attention (FA), which
entails voluntary and sustained attention on a chosen prescribed sensory object, mental
thought, or physiological process [49]. TM practice is characterized as an automatic self-
transcending technique (AST), in which the mantra is repeated in an effortless way as it
spontaneously becomes more refined until it transcends to silent mind: no mantra, no
thoughts, just pure consciousness. In TM, the mantras assigned by the TM instructors
originate from the ancient Vedic tradition of India. They are understood from tradition
to have positive effects on all levels of the mind. The beneficial effects for such subtle

Medicina 2024, 60, 2050

20 of 29

experience is supported by findings in over 700 scientific studies [23–28]. Instruction in the
technique, which entails selection of the appropriate mantra for the pupil and instruction in
how to use it properly, is carried out according to tradition [50–52,117]. Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi, who introduced the technique to the population at large, describes it as follows: “The
Transcendental Meditation technique is an effortless procedure for allowing the excitations of the
mind gradually to settle down until the least excited state of mind is reached. This is a state of
inner wakefulness with no object or thought or perception, just pure consciousness aware of its own
unbounded nature. It is wholeness, aware of itself, devoid of differences [118]”. In comparison,
Bhante Henepola Gunaratana, a Sri Lankan Theravada Buddhist monk, who has published
14 books on meditation and mindfulness, describes mindfulness as follows: “Meditation
is not easy. It takes time and it takes energy. It also takes grit, determination, and discipline. It
requires a host of personal qualities that we normally regard as unpleasant and like to avoid whenever
possible. We can sum up all of these qualities in the American word gumption. Meditation takes
gumption” [119].

4.2. Proposed Mechanism for Reduction of PTSD Symptomatology Through TM Practice

The first physiological research on TM in the early 1970s attests to its effortless-
ness.
It found that TM produces effects that are opposite to the fight-or-flight stress
response [19–22]. This physiological state came to be referred to as a restfully alert, hy-
pometabolic, physiologic state [20], or “restful alertness”. Whereas PTSD can be associated
with increased heart rate, rapid breathing, muscle tension, pupil dilation, or increased
blood pressure, effects of TM tend to be the opposite. A meta-analysis of 32 studies found
that, during TM, respiratory rate, skin conductance, and plasma lactate level significantly
decrease compared to controls resting with eyes closed [120]. This meta-analysis [120]
also found that baseline levels of heart rate, spontaneous electrodermal responses, plasma
lactate, and respiratory rate were lower prior to TM practice sessions than they were in
controls prior to eyes-closed rest, suggesting long-term effects likely to reduce hyperarousal
in PTSD patients. Moreover, TM subjects have been found to exhibit significantly faster
recovery from stress than controls in electrodermal [22], cardiovascular [121], and cortisol
responses, consistent with the finding of rapid recovery from PTSD. An magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) study found that activity in the brainstem, which regulates breath rate,
heart rate, and cortisol responses, decreased while frontal-lobe executive blood flow in-
creased, suggesting increased control at a deeper level of awareness during TM [122]. Also,
whereas PTSD is treated with drugs that increase serotonin to improve mood [8], TM is
associated with increased excretion of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
(5-HIAA) and decreased excretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline metabolites [123–125].
These differences in neurotransmitter metabolism suggest a shift to a lower state of arousal,
consistent with a normalizing effect. This may represent a shift to the parasympathetic side
of the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the autonomic
nervous system. Such a shift might underlie reduction of the hyperarousal associated with
PTSD that occurs after beginning meditation practice.

Recent studies of effects of meditation on gene expression in peripheral blood mononu-
clear cells (PBMC) may support this earlier work on neurotransmitter metabolism. Long-
term practitioners of TM show reduction of the Conserved Transcriptional Response to
Adversity (CTRA) in PBMC [126]. The CTRA is mediated by a β2-adrenergic-receptor
(i.e., sympathetic nervous system) mediated transcriptional response to chronic adverse
conditions or stressors and is associated with increased inflammation and reduced resis-
tance to infectious diseases [127]. The CTRA also was found to be reduced in a short-term
randomized controlled trial involving another technique of meditation somewhat similar
to TM [128]. To date, there have been no comparative effectiveness studies of effects of
different meditation techniques on the CTRA gene expression profile.

Meta-analyses indicate that TM is superior to other methods of stress-reduction in
decreasing blood pressure [129] and anxiety [130,131]. Similarly, a major review found
that cardiovascular risk factors were lower in TM adolescents and adults than controls

Medicina 2024, 60, 2050

21 of 29

receiving various other treatments [132]. Repeated systemic reduction of the fight-or-flight
response could be expected to be beneficial to persons suffering from hyperarousal. In
comparison with TM, MBSR [118] includes both OM and FA tasks of breath awareness
meditation (BAM), which requires the focusing of attention, which may keep the mind
from transcending. Hence MBSR would require reduction of hyperarousal via mechanisms
other than those resulting from transcending.

The initial distinction between the three categories of meditation is based on their
different effects on EEG frequency [49]. AST is associated with increased alpha1 frequency
(8–10 Hz), which coordinates the activities of distal cortical areas that are needed for
memory, comprehension, creativity, and fine motor coordination [133,134]. OM increases
theta frequency (4–6 Hz) EEG, which is associated with inhibition of sensory input and
is needed to reduce distraction during internal mental processing like mental arithmetic
or open monitoring meditation. FA is associated with increased beta/gamma frequency
(20–50 Hz), which coordinates the activities of adjacent cortical areas needed for focused
attention [49].

AST, OM, and FA also have different effects on EEG coherence, which is the stability
of phase angle between EEG signals from different regions of the cortex. During OM,
theta and alpha2 (10–12 Hz) coherence increases, and this is associated with idling of
the visual cortex. During TM, alpha1 (8–10 Hz) has consistently been found to become
coherent [135] among all cortical leads. TM also increases EEG synchrony, which is another
way to measure the correlation of brain waves [136].

Increased alpha1 coherence observed during TM is correlated with creativity [137],
concept learning [138], decreased anxiety [139], moral reasoning [139,140], neurological
efficiency [138], a consciousness orientation [139], and higher states of consciousness [137].
These cognitive improvements could be expected to help the PTSD sufferer regain the
ability to concentrate and improve their mood and sense of self-worth.

Different meditation techniques also have different effects on the Default Mode Net-
work (DMN) [141], a system of the medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex that
becomes active when the mind is self-referral, concerned with issues of “me”, “my”, and
“myself”, such as when describing “who I am”, or “what I think about something or
someone” [142]. The DMN has been described as the “genius lounge”, in which the major
systems of the brain responsible for memory, emotions, and decision-making sit together
in a lounge to discuss and try to find solutions to the person’s current concerns [143]. The
DMN works in the background on the preconscious level of the mind, and as solutions
are found, they break forth into conscious awareness, sometime dramatically as “Aha”
moments of deep insight. If DMN cannot find a solution to a deeply troubling personal
problem, as in PTSD, the mind may become stuck ruminating in DMN mode, which ex-
plains why extended DMN activity is found associated with depression [144]. Persons
suffering from PTSD commonly confront existential questions as a result of their traumatic
experience, such as why did this happen? How could God allow such a thing? How can
I give dignity to what happened? Do I deserve to be here? How can I resolve the guilt
and shame I feel from what I saw, or did, or failed to do, etc.? Such irreconcilable conflicts
often cannot be resolved on the level of talk therapy or reframing or figuring things out;
lack of resolution can result in depression and suicide. Anecdotal reports from veterans
and first responders indicate that even a brief transcendental experience of an inner field
of awareness that is beyond conflict can ignite an optimism that life beyond PTSD is a
possibility [145].

During TM, when the mind is effortlessly drawn inward due to the increasing charm
at subtler levels, the default mode network (DMN) is initiated, as indicated by increased
power and coherence of its characteristic frequency, alpha1, and by neuroimaging [141].
In contrast, FA and OM decrease DMN activity because they draw attention outward to
accomplish tasks [141].

Mindfulness has been found to increase cortical thickening of areas of the brain
that are exercised by mindfulness practices [146], whereas TM does not increase cortical

Medicina 2024, 60, 2050

22 of 29

thickening [122,147]. The brain, like muscles, increases in thickness with exercise, and the
fact that TM does not increase cortical thickness may be an indicator of its effortlessness.
Rather, TM increases cortical integration, as reviewed above, as well as integration of deep
brain structures correlated with decreased stress.

A three-month-long study using resting-state functional MRI found that TM decreased
perceived anxiety and stress, which correlated negatively with changes in functional
connectivity among posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, and the left superior
parietal lobule. The PCC is a key node in the DMN, associated with emotion, cognition,
awareness, and arousal. The precuneus is involved in self-processing operations, such
as taking a first-person perspective, as well as in attention, memory, motor and mental
imagery. The left superior parietal lobule is involved in spatial localization in addition to
visual perception, reasoning, working memory, and attention. TM was also associated with
increased connectivity between the PCC and the right insula, which plays a key role in
interoceptive awareness (feeling internal bodily states like pain, hunger, and heart rate),
emotional processing, empathy, and the perception of salient stimuli, particularly related
to negative emotions, with a strong focus on the body’s internal state and self-referential
processing. It is also involved in attention control and decision-making by integrating
sensory information with emotional context. These results may help explain how the
experience of restful alertness through TM integrates cortical and subcortical systems to
heal the multidimensional breakdowns associated with PTSD.

4.3. Limitations

There were few direct comparisons of the different meditation techniques on the study
level, which could have provided better controls for the duration and frequency of medita-
tion sessions, the meditation teacher or instructor, participant selection criteria (including
baseline psychological state and type of trauma), the environment where meditation takes
place, the level of participant engagement, and the control group design (ensuring it pro-
vides similar attention and social interaction as the meditation group). Also, the sample
sizes were relatively small, making it difficult to determine if the results generalize to the
wider populations.

Everyone has a worldview born of their life experiences, which potentially could be a
source of bias in scientific research. We used funnel plot analyses, which found no evidence
of publication bias for any category of meditation. We included all the studies we could
locate, which were more studies than previous meta-analyses. This is because our selection
criteria were more inclusive, and our study was up to date. It included many recent studies
that had not been reviewed before. To be transparent, we have presented the data for each
individual study in Tables in Supplementary Materials, Tables S1–S6. The summary effects
for MBSR, MBO, OM, and TM were similar in magnitude to those reported in previous
systematic reviews by researchers independent of MIU or TM, giving confidence that our
results were not biased towards overreporting TM nor underreporting other techniques.
Furthermore, the effects for studies conducted at institutions independent of MIU of TM
practice were of similar magnitude to the effects of studies that are associated with TM
and MIU, as have been found in a previous meta-analysis on the psychological effects of
meditation [148].

4.4. Future Research

In coding these studies, we found that implementation statistics on dropouts, comple-
tion rates, and regularity of meditation practices were not reliably reported across studies.
This makes it difficult to quantitatively study the effects of these variables on treatment
outcomes. We suggest that future research make sure to include these measures, which
may be useful in finding ways to improve compliance and effectiveness of meditation in
the treatment of PTSD.

We suggest also adding measures of transcending to all studies on meditation. We
have made a case that transcending is the key to the effectiveness of TM. We suggest that bio

Medicina 2024, 60, 2050

23 of 29

markers of transcending, such as slowing of breath, reduced spontaneous skin resistance
responses, and/or alpha1 (7–10 Hz) EEG power and coherence, could be measured along
with any meditation practice to see if they produce a degree of transcending and whether
this is predictive of efficacy in reducing symptoms of trauma. Are there other meditation
techniques, or different forms of known ones, that enable transcending?

There has been much discussion and research on mindfulness as the key ingredient
of successful meditation. Now we are suggesting a different paradigm, with the study
of transcending as potentially the key ingredient. In this meta-analysis, we have argued
that transcending is the reason that TM is successful, and not transcending is the reason
that other meditation techniques are of limited efficacy. Perhaps a systematic search for
transcending will lead to discovery of other meditation techniques that result in it.

The authors are currently preparing a second study which examines the effects of TM
on PTSD in both military and civilian populations compared to controls. In addition, the
main recommendation from this MA is that multisite Phase 3 clinical trials are needed to
test TM’s efficacy compared with standard treatments, such as Nidich et al., 2018 [104], to
help with the management of this public health problem of global proportion. Stakeholders
among those serving veterans would benefit from studies that could help elucidate the
roles for other meditation techniques as well.

5. Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis of all meditation techniques used for treating
PTSD found that all groups of techniques show benefit. The Transcendental Meditation
technique has clinically meaningful effects on reducing PTSD symptoms that are statistically
larger than for other meditation techniques. For this reason, and because TM is offered
on a voluntary basis, as is the case with any evidence-based modality, it should be made
widely available to military and civilian populations who desire to learn it. This research
suggests that the wide implementation of this very effective treatment for PTSD would
have significant cost savings and clinical implications, including reduced symptom severity,
improved quality of life, increased functional ability, decreased reliance on medication,
better social relationships, and potentially a greater capacity for resilience in individuals
experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder, essentially allowing people with PTSD to
manage their symptoms and participate more fully in daily life.
