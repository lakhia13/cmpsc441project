Abstract

The research into emotional regulation in eating disorders (EDs) has shown specific

impairments and maladaptive coping strategies in patients, and there is an increasing

interest in the role of the emotional domain in the treatment outcome. This study

aims to evaluate the effect of a specialized inpatient treatment characterized by both

an intensive and comprehensive standardized multidisciplinary programme based on
cognitive–behavioural

flexible and personalized component

therapy and a

implemented by third-wave interventions. A cohort of 67 female ED patients
(anorexia nervosa = 28, bulimia nervosa = 28 and binge eating disorder = 11)

underwent an evaluation of emotional

regulation difficulties, alexithymia and

dissociative symptomatology at admission to a specialized ED ward. The

psychological modifications were subsequently re-evaluated upon discharge, after an

inpatients treatment of 60 days, examining specific changes in the specific

psychopathology. A significant improvement after specialized ED treatment was

shown in alexithymia, emotional regulation difficulties and dissociation symptoms,

with higher effect sizes in patients with higher alexithymia scores. As regards the

specific effect of the psychological improvement, changes into alexithymia scores

have shown specific correlations with ED psychopathology (p < 0.010) and with

difficulties in emotional regulation (p < 0.010) in patients with higher alexithymia

levels at admission. Emotional regulation and dissociation should therefore be

evaluated in ED patients and may be improved with specific therapeutic approaches,

while alexithymia remains a clinical trait, even with a significant reduction.

alexithymia, and dissociation could be improved with specific inpatient

treatment in ED patients, despite the limits of the study. Despite sig-

nificant reduction, the TAS-20 scores remained clinically significant in

patients with alexithymia features, corroborating the evidence of its

nature as a personality trait. Finally, we found correlations between

the changes of alexithymia symptomatology and specific ED psycho-

pathology and changes in emotional regulation, which should be fur-

ther investigated due to their relevance as it pertains to treatment

outcomes.
