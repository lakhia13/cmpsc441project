Abstract: Although adults with depression struggle to effectively emotionally regulate themselves,
these findings are limited to one partner in a romantic relationship, community samples, and cross-
sectional designs. Hence, we aimed to address these gaps in the literature by investigating emotion
regulation difficulties as a predictor of change in depression among couples in couple therapy.
Additionally, we aimed to investigate whether emotion regulation difficulties mediated the well-
established association between relationship satisfaction and changes in depression of couples in
couple therapy. We examined 484 different-sex couples in couple therapy from the Marriage and
Family Therapy Practice Research Network—a clinical dataset from clinics across the United States.
Dyadic latent growth models revealed the actor and partner effects of emotion regulation difficulties
at session 1, predicting decreases in depression trajectories across 16 sessions of couple therapy.
Additionally, dyadic latent growth mediation models revealed that emotion regulation difficulties
at session four did not mediate the associations between relationship satisfaction at session 1 with
depression trajectories of sessions eight through 16. For couple therapy clinicians, emotion regulation
difficulties can play a direct role in the treatment of depression. However, our results did not support
emotion regulation difficulties as a mediator for the well-established association between relationship
satisfaction and depression trajectories.

1. Emotion Regulation and Depressive Symptoms Among Couples in Couple Therapy

Depressive disorders are common and persistent mental health conditions [1]. Consid-
ered a “distress disorder” [2], adults with depressive disorders often experience difficulties
regulating their emotions [3,4]. Findings show that emotion regulation difficulties con-
tribute to both developing and maintaining depressive symptoms. While the relationship
between emotion regulation and depression is well-established [3], the current findings on
emotion regulation and depressive symptoms among couples are limited to one partner in
a romantic relationship (e.g., [5]), community samples (e.g., [6]), and cross-sectional designs
(e.g., [7]). Therefore, our aim was to contribute to the literature by investigating emotion
regulation difficulties as a predictor of change in depression of couples in couple therapy.
Furthermore, we aimed to examine whether emotion regulation difficulties mediated the
association between relationship satisfaction and changes in depression among couples in
couple therapy.

1.1. Depression Among Couples

Depressive disorders are the world’s largest contributor to global disability [1]. In the
United States, approximately 21 million adults, or 8.4% of the population, have experienced
at least one depressive episode in the past year [8]. Depression is increasingly recognized as
a “we-disease” to reflect its profound impact on both partners [9]. Unlike some conditions
that primarily affect the individual diagnosed, depressive symptoms disrupt relationship
dynamics, transforming it into a shared burden. This mutual suffering is the result of a
feedback loop between depressive symptoms and relationship satisfaction that exacerbates
both individual and relational symptoms [10].

1.2. Depression and Emotion Regulation

Emotion regulation is a process of the conscious and unconscious modulation of
emotions in response to environmental demands [11]. Adults with depression are more
likely to use maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., rumination and suppression)
and struggle to implement adaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., distraction and
reappraisal; see [3]). Emotion regulation difficulties are both a symptom of depression and
a predictor of its occurrence and persistence [12]. Individuals who experience emotion
regulation difficulties are vulnerable to experiencing prolonged negative emotions, which
can escalate into depressive symptoms and episodes. For example, rumination, defined
as repetitive and recurring thinking about negative feelings and events, predicts the de-
velopment of depressive symptoms and exacerbates existing symptoms [11]. In contrast,
individuals with adaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) are
more likely to experience fewer depressive symptoms. Although there is strong evidence
that emotion regulation affects depression in individuals [3,12], emotion regulation diffi-
culties can affect relationships. Partners who experience emotion regulation difficulties
are more vulnerable to conflict, which perpetuates relationship distress and deteriorates
mental health [13]. Additionally, how a partner emotionally regulates themselves as well
as co-regulates with their partner have been shown to have effects on their own depressive
symptoms [14]. To date, the empirical literature on emotion regulation and depression
among couples has focused on community samples; clinical samples have not yet been
examined. Although emotion regulation has been studied in relational processes and out-
comes for couple therapy [15,16], it has yet to be investigated as a predictor of depressive
symptoms in couple therapy.

1.3. Depression and Relationship Satisfaction

There is a well-established association between depression and relationship satisfac-
tion [17]. Findings from a landmark, representative, epidemiological study demonstrated a
25-fold increase in the relative risk of depression for those in distressed relationships [18].
Relationship problems are associated with the development of future depressive symp-
toms [19]. The quality of an individual’s close relationships affects one’s view of themself
and their sense of self-worth. Furthermore, the relationship between depression and
relationship is bidirectional [20,21]. Thus, depressive symptoms put one at risk for the
development of relationship distress. This association is described in the Marital Discord
Model of Depression [22], a predominant theory on depression and couple relationships. It
explains that improving relationship distress is associated with improvements in depressive
symptoms for couples. Furthermore, this association of relationship distress and depressive
symptoms extends to clinical samples, with clinical trials of couple therapy demonstrating
improvements in relationship satisfaction and depressive symptoms [23]. Particularly,
changes in relationship satisfaction were associated with changes in depressive symptoms
for couples in a clinical trial of couple therapy for depression [24]. Despite this evidence,
there continues to be a consistent call for greater understanding of the underlying mecha-
nisms of this association [17]. Much remains unknown about when and how relationship
satisfaction is associated with depressive symptoms. We aim to heed this call by examining
emotion regulation difficulties as a mediator.

1.4. Emotion Regulation as a Mediator

There is support for emotion regulation as a mediator between relationship status and
depression [5,25] as well as insecure attachment and depression [6]. However, emotion
regulation has not been tested as a mediator for relationship satisfaction and depressive
symptoms. Put simply, it remains unknown whether emotion regulation explains how
relationship satisfaction is associated with depressive symptoms. One aspect of the Marital
Discord Model of Depression is the acceptance of emotions in the romantic relationship,
which encourages partners to disclose and be forthcoming with each other [22]. Con-
versely, partners may have difficulty with emotionally regulating themselves when there
is little to no acceptance of negative emotions. The Marital Discord Model of Depression
suggests that improving relationship satisfaction would then create more acceptance of
emotions, which would improve emotion regulation and then improve depressive symp-
toms. Thus, we expect emotion regulation difficulties to mediate relationship satisfaction
and depressive symptoms.

Prior investigations of emotion regulation as a mediator were conducted with cross-
sectional designs, sampled only one partner, and/or examined non-clinical samples. For
example, one study had a large sample of 630 adults who participated in an online survey
at one time [6]. Another studied two large samples (1319 adults and a national sample
of 772 adults) with romantic relationships recruited through the random dialing of tele-
phone numbers and an online sample at one time point [5]. This highlights the need for
longitudinal studies, clinical samples, and the inclusion of both partners.

1.5. Current Study

Our aim was to investigate emotion regulation among couples with depressive symp-
toms over the course of couple therapy. This study was designed in response to several
important gaps in the literature on emotion regulation and depression among couples. First,
most of the literature sampled only individual adults or one partner of romantic relation-
ships, which limits emotion regulation to the perception of one person in the relationship.
Second, the literature primarily sampled community or population samples, so these results
may not apply to clinical samples. Third, despite emotion regulation being tested as a
mediator, the studies were most commonly cross-sectional, severely limiting our under-
standing of the mediating role of emotion regulation over time. Using clinical data from
the Marriage and Family Therapy Practice Research Network, a dataset from marriage and
family therapy clinics across the U.S., we aimed to test the following research questions:

RQ1: To what extent are both partners’ emotion regulation difficulties associated with

their own and their partner’s depressive symptoms over the course of couple therapy?

RQ2: To what extent do both partners’ emotion regulation difficulties mediate the
associations between their own and their partner’s relationship satisfaction and depressive
symptoms?

2. Methods

We used data from the Marriage and Family Therapy Practice Research Network
(MFT-PRN) [26], which includes clinical data from marriage and family therapy university
clinics and community settings across the U.S. All clients consented to the MFT-PRN and
were provided the same treatment services they would have received if they declined to
consent. Prior to each session, clients completed electronic surveys that were stored in an
electronic database: MFT-PRN. Specifically, we used data from couples in couple therapy
from sessions 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Given the clinical nature of the data, this dataset was not
publicly available [26]. The lead author’s university deemed the data for this study to be
exempt. We limited the data to couples in which both partners completed the emotion
regulation, depression, and relationship satisfaction measures at session 1 (n = 517 couples).
There was 1 same-sex couple and 32 with missing data on sex that were removed from the
sample, which resulted in a final sample of 484 different-sex couples.

2.1. Sample Characteristics

Sample characteristics were completed at the first or second session. These couples
were in committed relationships with 22% not currently living together and the remaining
78% currently living together. On average, couples were together for 4.52 years (SD = 7.2,
Median = 2, Range, 0–48) and had an average income in the category of USD 30,000–$39,999.
On average, partners were in their late 20s (Men: M = 28.08, SD = 8.8, Median = 25,
Range = 19–72; Women: M = 27.08, SD = 8.37, Median = 24, Range = 18–70). Men identi-
fied as White/Caucasian (83%), Hispanic/Latino/Spanish (6%), Black/African American
(0.02%), Asian (1.6%), American Indian/Alaska Native (0.06%), Native Hawaiian/Pacific
Islander (0.08%), and multiracial or endorsed more than one race (6.6%). Women identified
as White/Caucasian (81%), Hispanic/Latino/Spanish (8%), Asian (2%), Native Hawai-
ian/Pacific Islander (0.02%), and multiracial or endorsed more than one race (7.8%). Some
partners had a bachelor’s degree (4-year college degree) or higher (Men: 38%; Women: 45%).
On average, the partners reported no pressure to attend couple therapy (Men: M = 1.77;
Women: M = 1.28), while many had previous experience with therapy (Men: 64%; Women:
76%) and some were in concurrent individual therapy (Men: 13%; Women: 21%). Some
partners reported taking anti-depressant medication (Men: 10%; Women: 18%). Although
dates at session 1 were not provided, the length of treatment from session 2 to session
16 was an average of 22.58 weeks (SD = 6.54, Median = 21.29, Range, 10.14–16.57). Finally,
partners reported an average treatment progress where the problems were a little better
(Men: M = 5.17, SD = 0.85, Median = 5.22, Range = 1.67–7; Women: M = 5.03, SD = 0.86,
Median = 5, Range = 1–7)

2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Emotion Regulation

Difficulties with emotion regulation was measured by the Difficulties in Emotion
Regulation Scale Short Form (DERS-SF) [27], which is a valid, reliable, and briefer version
of the full Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. This 18-item scale ranges from “I have
no idea how I am feeling” to “When I’m upset, I lose control over my behavior” and is
rated from 1 (Almost never) to 5 (Almost always). These items were summed together to
create a variable where higher scores indicated higher difficulties in emotion regulation.
The DERS-SF had an acceptable internal reliability (i.e., Cronbach’s alpha) for men (session
1: α = 0.87, session 4: α = 0.86) and women (session 1: α = 0.87, session 4: α = 0.88).

2.2.2. Depression

Depression was measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [28].
The PHQ-9 is a reliable and valid measure of depression that is sensitive to changes in
depression over time [28]. The nine items ranged from “little interest or pleasure in doing
things” to “thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way”,
which were rated from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (All the time). Items were summed to create a
variable where higher scores indicated higher levels of depression. Scores above 10 met the
clinical cut-off for depression. This had an acceptable internal reliability for men (Session 1:
α = 0.86, session 4: α = 0.84, session 8: α = 0.85, session 12: α = 0.86, session 16: α = 0.85) and
women (session 1: α = 0.87, sessions 4, 8, 12, and 16: α = 0.84).

2.2.3. Relationship Satisfaction

Relationship satisfaction was measured by the 16-item Couple Satisfaction Index
(CSI) [29] that assessed partners’ overall levels of satisfaction in their romantic relationship.
The items ranged from “In general, how often do you think that things between you and
your partner are going well” to “I really feel like part of a team with my partner”. These
items were summed together to create a variable where higher scores indicated relationship
satisfaction. Scores below 51.5 indicate relationship distress. This had an acceptable internal
reliability for men at session 1 (α = 0.98) and women at session 1 (α = 0.98).

2.2.4. Controls

We included client characteristics and treatment factors as controls including relation-
ship duration (Years), race and ethnicity (White = 1, Black, Asian, American Indian, Middle
Eastern, and multiracial = 0), income (11 categories from < USD10,000 to greater than $1,000,000),
sexual orientation (Gay, lesbian, or bisexual = 1, heterosexual or straight = 0), pressure to attend
therapy (Single item from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating more pressure to attend therapy),
in current treatment with an individual therapist (concurrent treatment = 1, no concurrent
treatment = 0), and antidepressant medication (antidepressant medication = 1, no antidepressant
medication = 0). Treatment progress was measured by an average of three items that asked
clients to rate the progress of the top three biggest problems on a scale of 1 (Problem is
much worse) to 7 (Problem is solved/Much better). These items were given after session 1
and averaged together to create an average treatment progress across the course of treat-
ment. Anxious and avoidant attachment were assessed using the Experiences in Close
Relationships Scale-Short Form [30], which had an acceptable Cronbach’s alpha for anxious
attachment (men: α = 0.72; women: α = 0.71) and avoidant attachment (men: α = 0.81;
women: α = 0.79). Both partners’ scores on income, relationship duration, and length
of treatment were averaged together to create a single variable for each of the following:
income, relationship duration, and length of treatment.

2.3. Analytic Plan

We used R [31] to run descriptive and bivariate correlations of the key variables.
Several variables had high skewness and kurtosis (i.e., relationship duration, length of
treatment between sessions 2 and 4 as well as 4 and 8, and both partners’ pressure to attend
therapy), and were logarithmic transformed. Next, the following analyses were completed
using Mplus [32]. Dyadic latent growth curve modeling [33] was used to test research
question one. For the unconditional model, the women’s initial and rates of changes
were latent constructs comprised of women’s observed depression at sessions 1, 4, 8, 12,
and 16, which had factor loadings of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. This same procedure
was followed for men’s depressive symptom trajectories. Both men’s and women’s error
variances at each time point were correlated. We evaluated possible nonlinear trends by
freely estimating parameters as well as adding quadratic and cubic latent constructs. With
good model fit, we then developed a conditional model by adding difficulties in emotion
regulation and controls as predictors of men’s and women’s initial and rates of changes in
depressive symptom trajectories.

Dyadic mediation and latent growth curve modeling was used to test research question
two. For the unconditional model, men’s and women’s initial and rates of change in
depressive trajectories were from sessions 8, 12, and 16 with factor loadings of 2, 3, and
4, respectively. With good model fit, we then created the conditional model of men’s and
women’s relationship satisfaction, along with controls, at session 1, predicting the men
and women’s emotion regulation difficulties at session 4, which in turn predicted men’s
and women’s depressive trajectories from sessions 8, 12, and 16 (see Figure 1). Of the
controls, men’s and women’s treatment progress predicted men’s and women’s initial and
rates of change in depressive symptoms. Additionally, the length of treatment between
sessions 2 and 4 predicted both partners’ emotion regulation difficulties at session 4, and
the length of treatment between sessions 4 and 8 predicted both partners’ initial and rates
of change in depressive trajectories. Mediation was analyzed by grand mean centering
all continuous variables, binary variables coded as 1, −1, and by using model indirect
effects with 2000 bootstraps. Good model fit was evaluated by a comparative fit index (CFI)
greater than 0.95 as well as a standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) and root
mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) less than 0.05 [34].

Missing Data

Of the variables at session 1, missingness ranged from 0.41% (e.g., men’s medication)
to 26.70% (e.g., men’s average treatment progress). As to be expected with clinical data,
there was a noticeable amount of missingness for depression at session 4 (28.3% women,
31.2% men), session 8 (49.4% women, 51.7% men), session 12 (65.5% women, 68.8% men),
and session 16 (75.4% women, 78.9% men). There was also attrition for missingness on
emotion regulation difficulties at session 4 (31.00% women, 28.50% men). Little’s tests (from
the naniar package; [35]) revealed that missingness was completely missing at random for
the RQ1 model (χ2 (1851) = 1936, p = 0.08) and RQ2 model (χ2 (1690) = 1781, p = 0.06).
To further evaluate the missingness, we conducted Pearson correlation tests of the key
variables. We coded missingness (Missingness = 1, Observed = 0) of depression and emotion
regulation difficulties at sessions 4, 8, 12, and 16. Results revealed that missingness on
depression at sessions 4, 8, 12, and 16 and emotion regulation difficulties at session 4
were associated with at least two variables. For example, men’s avoidant attachment was
associated with their own and their partner’s lower missingness at sessions 8, 12, and 16
(r = −0.13 was the lowest and r = −0.19 was the highest). Given these missingness analyses,
we used full-information maximum likelihood to handle missingness in our models.

3. Results

The preliminary correlation analyses are reported in Table 1 and summarized here.
Correlations revealed that emotion regulation difficulties at session 1 was positively associ-
ated with depressive symptoms at each session for both partners (See Table 1). Specifically,
women’s higher emotion regulation difficulties at session 1 was consistently associated
with their own and their partner’s higher depressive symptoms at each later session. How-
ever, men’s higher emotion regulation difficulties at session 1 were consistently associated
with their own higher depressive symptoms at each session, but only associated with
their partner’s higher depressive symptoms at sessions 1 and 4. Interestingly, men’s and
women’s higher relationship satisfaction were only associated with men’s lower emotion
regulation difficulties at session 4, but not with women’s emotion regulation at session
4. This may suggest a weak association between relationship satisfaction and emotion
regulation difficulties.

Notes: DER = emotion regulation difficulties. DS = depressive symptoms. S1 = session 1, S4 = session 4,
S8 = session 8, S12 = session 12, S16 = session 16. TX = treatment. Bolded r, p < 0.05.

Next, we began to test research question one with an unconditional dyadic latent
growth model of men’s and women’s depressive symptom trajectories of sessions 1, 4, 8,
12, and 16, and then evaluated the nonlinear trends in the model. These were non-positive
definite in the latent covariance matrix when we accounted for quadratic, cubic, and freely
estimating slope parameters, but not in the linear slope model. Hence, we used the linear
slope model. Results reported here had a p < 0.05 unless otherwise specified; refer to the
tables for details. The linear unconditional dyadic latent growth model had an acceptable
model fit: CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.04 (95% CI 0.2–0.6), and SRMR = 0.04. Men started with
mild initial levels of depressive symptoms at session 1 (b = 6.40) that varied across couples
(σ2 = 18.18), which then decreased (b = 0.17) over the course of couple therapy and did
not vary across couples (σ2 = 0.17, p = 0.33). Women also started with mild initial levels of
depressive symptoms at session 1 (b = 7.48) that varied across couples (σ2 = 21.42), which
then did not change over the course of couple therapy (b = −0.16, p = 0.06), but varied
across couples (σ2 = 0.62). Particularly, women started with higher depressive symptoms
than men (χ2 (1) = 14.69, p < 0.01.), but the linear rates of change were not different between
men and women (χ2 (1) = 0.28, p = 0.65).

Next, we added predictors and control variables to the model. This resulted in a model
with a non-positive definite covariance matrix, which was resolved by fixing the variance

Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 1215

8 of 15

of women’s linear rates of change to 0. This conditional model also had an acceptable
model fit: CFI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.04 (95% CI 0.3 to 0.4), and SRMR = 0.03. Men’s higher
emotion regulation difficulties at session 1 was associated with their own (b = 1.94) and
their partner’s higher levels of initial depressive symptoms (b = 0.60). Women’s higher
emotion regulation difficulties at session 1 was associated with their own (b = 2.14) and
their partner’s higher levels of initial depressive symptoms (b = 0.59) as well as decreasing
rates of change in their own (b = −0.18) and their partner’s depressive symptom trajectories
(b = −0.24). See Table 2 for further details.

Notes: DER = emotion regulation difficulties. DS = depressive symptoms. S1 = session 1, S4 = session 4,
S8 = session 8, S12 = session 12, S16 = session 16. TX = treatment. Bolded b, p < 0.05.

Finally, to test research question two, we began with an unconditional dyadic latent
growth model of the men and women’s depressive symptom trajectories from sessions
8, 12, and 16. This model revealed a non-positive definite covariance matrix, which was
resolved when we fixed the variances of both men’s and women’s rates of change to 0,
which then had an acceptable model fit: CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = 0.0 (95% CI 0 to 0.4), and
SRMR = 0.05. Men started with mild initial levels of depressive symptoms at session 8
(b = 6.39) that varied across couples (σ2 = 16.69), which did not change over the course of
couple therapy (b = −0.07, p = 0.69) and did not vary across couples (fixed to 0). Women
also started with mild initial levels of depressive symptoms at session 8 (b = 8.11) that
varied across couples (σ2 = 16.35), which then did not change over the course of couple
therapy (b = −0.18, p = 0.32) and did not vary across couples (fixed to 0). Particularly,
women started with higher depressive symptoms than men (χ2 (1) = 14.16, p < 0.01) but the
linear rates of change were not different between men and women (χ2 (1) = 0.24, p = 0.62).
Next, we added the predictors and controls to create the dyadic latent growth media-
tion model. This model had an acceptable model fit: CFI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.02 (95% CI 0
to 0.3), and SRMR = 0.04. With an acceptable model fit, we then tested indirect pathways
from men’s and women’s relationship satisfaction at session 1 to men’s and women’s initial
and rates of change in depressive symptoms. Men’s and women’s higher relationship
satisfaction at session 1 was neither associated with their own nor their partner’s higher
emotion regulation difficulties at session 4. However, men’s higher emotion regulation

Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 1215

difficulties at session 4 was associated with their own higher initial levels of depressive
symptoms at session 8 (b = 0.26) while controlling for men’s and women’s treatment
progress and relationship satisfaction as well as length of treatment from sessions 4 to 8.
Women’s higher emotion regulation difficulties at session 4 was associated with their own
higher initial levels of depressive symptoms at session 8 (b = 0.22). See Table 3 for details.
We then tested the indirect effects using the bootstrap method (i.e., 2000 bootstraps) for
confidence intervals. These results revealed no indirect effects from relationship satisfaction
to emotion regulation difficulties to the initial levels and rates of change in depressive
symptom trajectories for actor or partner effects (See Table 4). Put simply, men’s and
women’s emotion regulation at session 4 did not mediate the associations between men’s
and women’s relationship satisfaction at session 1 with their own and their partner’s initial
levels and rates of change in depressive symptom trajectories from sessions 8 to 16.

4. Discussion

We aimed to examine the associations between both partners’ emotion regulation
difficulties with their own and their partner’s depressive symptoms over the course of
couple therapy. We also tested whether both partners’ emotion regulation difficulties
mediated associations between their own and their partner’s relationship satisfaction and
depression symptoms. Results revealed that emotion regulation difficulties at intake were
associated with the initial and rates of change in depressive trajectories over the course of
couple therapy (RQ1). Furthermore, we examined the potential mechanism of emotion
regulation difficulties for the association between relationship satisfaction and depressive
trajectories. The results revealed that emotion regulation difficulties was not a mediator for
this association (RQ2). These findings contribute to the literature in two ways. First, the
findings expand on the support of emotion regulation difficulties predicting depressive
symptoms from individuals to couples in couple therapy. The previous literature focused
on emotion regulation and depression in individuals in community samples or clinical
samples [3]. By focusing on couples, these findings demonstrated actor and partner effects,
which are discussed below. Second, we heeded a consistent call to explore the mechanisms
for the well-established association between depression and relationship dissatisfaction [3].
Our findings greatly contribute to this literature by examining this association in a clinical
sample as well as the mediation effects. These results provide new findings for researchers
to replicate and examine in future work. Taken together, we discuss two important findings.

4.1. Emotion Regulation Difficulties as a Predictor of Depressive Symptoms

For both partners, more emotion regulation difficulties were associated with higher
levels of depressive symptoms at intake, for themselves and their partners. The actor effects
were consistent with the previous literature; both men and women who have difficulty reg-
ulating negative emotions tend to experience more frequent depressive symptoms [3,36,37].
However, the partner effects contribute to the literature to show that even higher emotion
regulation difficulties are associated with their partner’s higher levels of depressive symp-
toms. This highlights the interdependent nature in close relationships and underscores the
importance of considering both individual and dyadic processes in couple therapy, as each
partner’s emotions impact not only their own mental health, but also their partner’s. This
has implications for clinicians to not only expect couples to present at intake with higher
emotion regulation difficulties, but that there may be an interaction effect between partners.
Particularly, men’s and women’s higher depressive symptoms at intake may be a part of
their own emotion regulation difficulties and their partner’s emotion regulation difficulties.
Next, our findings revealed that emotion regulation was not only a predictor of the ini-
tial levels of depressive symptoms, but decreasing rates of change in depressive symptom
trajectories. Specifically, women’s higher emotion regulation difficulties were associated
with decreases in their own and their partner’s trajectories of depressive symptoms across

16 sessions of couple therapy. One possible explanation for this is that difficulties in emotion
regulation may surface due to unresolved relational issues during therapy, making them
more visible and addressable [38]. Couple therapy often targets emotion regulation by pro-
moting healthier emotional communication and coping strategies for both partners [28,39].
Given that women tend to be more emotionally expressive in relationships [40], their strug-
gles with emotion regulation might create more opportunities for therapeutic engagement
and progress. As women’s difficulties in emotion regulation are addressed in therapy, the
overall relational dynamic may improve, benefiting both partners’ emotional well-being.
However, due to the naturalistic setting of this study, we cannot definitively conclude that
emotion regulation was directly targeted or treated. Future research in more controlled set-
tings is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which women’s emotion regulation difficulties
influence depressive symptom changes in couple therapy.

Relatedly, another possible explanation for this may be that women often take the lead
in seeking couple therapy [41] and display greater willingness to engage in mental health
care [42,43]. They also report more effort toward self-improvement in therapy compared to
men [44]. This higher level of engagement may explain why women’s satisfaction is closely
tied to the couple’s progress in therapy, as their satisfaction likely reflects a more effective
therapeutic outcome that benefits both partners’ depressive symptoms.

Additionally, another explanation could be gender differences and similarities with
emotion regulation and psychopathology [27,45]. For example, compared to men, women
use different emotion regulation strategies [46], but there are gender similarities in that
emotion regulation is associated with psychopathology (e.g., depression; [45]). In the
current study, both genders had similar moderate averages of emotion regulation difficulties
at session 1 (Men: M = 40.56; Women: M = 41.71) and session 4 (Men: M = 40.43; Women:
M = 40.78). However, our finding that women’s emotion regulation plays a role in both
partners’ depressive symptoms is inconsistent with the noted prior literature. Prior studies
found gender differences in specific strategies. For instance, higher rumination is related to
more depression and anxiety for women compared to men [47]. A recent study offers a more
detailed look at the underlying factors behind gender differences in emotion processing.
Using an evidence accumulation model to analyze reports of emotions, the study found
that women are able to generate negative emotions more quickly than men [48]. This
suggests that women might be more sensitive to negative emotions, potentially linked to
their evolutionary role as primary caregivers, which would require a heightened awareness
of threats to their children’s safety [48]. This increased emotional sensitivity could help
explain why women, even though they use more emotion regulation strategies, are more
prone to depression and anxiety. Future research could explore how gender and emotion
regulation strategies interact, particularly in relation to mental health outcomes. Based
on these findings, clinicians can address difficulties with emotion regulation through the
implementation of targeted interventions such as emotion regulation skills and coping
strategies. Interestingly, our findings highlight that women’s emotion regulation difficulties
play a key role in decreasing their own and their partner’s depressive symptoms among
couples in couple therapy.

4.2. Emotion Regulation Difficulties Did Not Mediate

The finding that emotion regulation difficulties did not mediate the well-established
association between relationship dissatisfaction and depression was surprising. Based on
the Marital Discord Model of Depression, we expected to find that improving relationship
satisfaction would then improve emotion regulation, which would then improve depressive
symptoms. However, our findings do not support this mediation. One reason for the
lack of mediation may be attributed to the length of time between time points. Although
we accounted for this in the model, emotion regulation difficulties may show up prior to
session 4 in couple therapy. Another major reason may be due to the weak association
(found in the correlation results) or lack of association (found in the conditional models)
between both partners’ relationship satisfaction at session 1 with their own and their

Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 1215

12 of 15

partner’s emotion regulation difficulties at session 4.
It is possible that this could be
due to relationship satisfaction being an interpersonal construct and emotion regulation
being an intrapersonal construct. For example, these findings suggest that improving one’s
satisfaction with their romantic relationship does not affect how they emotionally regulate
themselves. Rather, this may be due to the sample being a clinical sample where the couples
are in relationship distress and struggling to regulate their emotions. It is possible that
emotion regulation difficulties may affect how satisfied a partner is with their relationship,
which would suggest that the direction of this relationship may be switched. Previously, in
testing theoretical concepts from Coyne’s Interpersonal Theory of Depression [49], another
major theory on couples with depression, the association between emotion regulation
difficulties and depressive symptoms was mediated by excessive reassurance seeking (i.e.,
a key theoretical concept in Coyne’s theory; [50]. In this case, emotion regulation was not
a mediator but a predictor. Hence, future research should examine whether relationship
satisfaction is a mediator between emotion regulation difficulties and depression. Together,
the clinical implications of this may suggest a different temporal association. Although it is
clear that emotion regulation difficulties play a role in couple therapy, how they play a role
in couple therapy remains unclear.

4.3. Limitations

There are both strengths and limitations associated with using clinical data from
naturalistic settings in this study. Particularly, the findings apply to real-world practices
where clients present for couple therapy. Additionally, this dataset enabled us to analyze
couples both dyadically and longitudinally. However, the naturalistic setting limited our
ability to identify and control other potential influences on the couple outcomes. Notably,
we lacked information on treatment factors such as presenting problems, interventions,
and clinic procedures utilized. Another limitation was the attrition rate in our sample. Our
examination of missing data showed a reduction in the number of participants attending
later sessions, which is a common challenge in clinical research. This may be attributed to
various external factors including financial constraints, significant life changes, or dissatis-
faction with treatment, potentially biasing our results toward couples who had resources or
were motivated to complete more therapy [51]. Finally, the findings of this study may not
be fully generalizable to more diverse populations, as the sample predominantly consisted
of White, middle-class couples. Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable
insights into links between emotion regulation, relationship satisfaction, and depression in
couple therapy.

5. Conclusions

We found that emotion regulation was a predictor of depressive symptom trajectories
for both partners. Particularly, these results demonstrate that emotion regulation may play
an important role in treating couples with depressive symptoms. However, we also found
that emotion regulation did not mediate between relationship satisfaction and depressive
symptom trajectories. This surprising finding demonstrates that the order of improving
relationship satisfaction, then emotion regulation to decrease depressive symptoms may
need to be re-considered. It may be that emotion regulation should be an earlier focus
(before session 4) in couple therapy. These findings are from clinical data from naturalistic
settings, meaning that couples presented for a variety of reasons and received a variety of
couple therapy interventions. In real-world clinical settings, emotion regulation appears to
be an important role in treating depressive symptoms for couples and not just individuals.
