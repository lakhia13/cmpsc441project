ABSTRACT

Background: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic rheumatic disease that
predominantly affects the axial skeleton, causing pain and functional impairment.
Kinesiophobia, or fear of movement, is common in patients with chronic pain
conditions and can signiﬁcantly hinder treatment outcomes. This study aims to
assess the level of kinesiophobia in AS patients and explore its relationship with
demographic characteristics, disease duration, pain intensity, disease activity, and
functional impairment.
Methods: This single-center study included 35 AS patients from July 2021 to July
2023. Patient demographics, disease duration, disease activity (BASDAI (Bath
Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index)), functionality (BASFI (Bath
Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index)), pain intensity (VAS (Visual Analog
Scale)), and kinesiophobia (TSK (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia)) were recorded and
analyzed. Patients were categorized into low and high kinesiophobia groups based on
TSK scores.
Results: Of the 35 AS patients, 15 (42.86%) had high kinesiophobia levels (TSK ≥37).
Patients with high kinesiophobia had signiﬁcantly higher BASDAI, BASFI, and VAS
scores (p < 0.001) compared to those with low kinesiophobia. No signiﬁcant
relationship was found between kinesiophobia and age, gender, or disease duration
(p > 0.05).
Conclusion: High levels of kinesiophobia in AS patients are associated with
increased pain, disease activity, and functional impairment. Early interventions
targeting kinesiophobia could improve treatment outcomes and patient
functionality.

INTRODUCTION
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic rheumatic disease involving the body’s axial
skeleton, characterized by chronic inﬂammatory changes in large joints such as the
sacroiliac and hip joints (Yang et al., 2023). The prevalence of AS may vary between
regions and ethnic groups. A systematic review assessing the prevalence of AS by continent
found the mean prevalence per 10,000 people to be 23.8 in Europe, 16.7 in Asia, 31.9 in
North America, 10.2 in Latin America, and 7.4 in Africa (Dean et al., 2014). The mean age
of onset of AS worldwide has been reported to be 26 years. Approximately 80% of patients
develop their ﬁrst symptoms under 30 years of age (Uslu et al., 2024). One of the biggest
manifestations of AS is that it negatively affects mobility. Especially in the later stages of

the disease, individuals’ mobility decreases and their mobilization is restricted. After a
while, this situation turns into a more serious situation as individuals gradually begin to
restrict their own movements. Because although many new treatment options have been
developed for AS, exercise therapy remains the cornerstone of AS treatment (Kim et al.,
2022; Tada et al., 2023; van der Linden & van der Heijde, 1998).

Exercise therapy, along with non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs), is
prescribed for AS patients either as initial therapy or as adjunctive therapy alongside any
other treatment used as initial therapy. Exercise therapy can prevent functional limitations
and improve the quality of life in patients with AS (Pina Goncalves et al., 2023; Zaggelidou
et al., 2023). In this respect, movement and exercise are indispensable for AS patients.

Kinesiophobia, also known as fear of movement, is deﬁned as an excessive, irrational,
and debilitating fear of performing a physical movement due to a feeling of vulnerability to
a painful injury or re-injury (Kori, 1990; Luque-Suarez, Martinez-Calderon & Falla, 2019).
An exaggerated negative cognitive and emotional response to anticipated or actual pain is
referred to as pain catastrophizing. Additionally, AS patients with long-term pain enter a
vicious circle in which chronic pain and functional disabilities trigger each other, their
condition paradoxically worsens, and their functional and social lives are more adversely
affected (Asiri et al., 2021; Ishak, Zahari & Justine, 2017; Miller et al., 2020). In this context,
kinesiophobia further aggravates existing diseases, especially those that progress with
chronic pain. Considering that AS is a disorder accompanied by chronic pain and that
exercise and movement are among the main components of AS treatment, it would not be
difﬁcult to predict that kinesiophobia will further exacerbate AS. Oskay et al. (2017)
reported that kinesiophobia increases the severity of pain in AS patients and negatively
affects the patients’ functional status and quality of life. Similarly, Luque-Suarez,
Martinez-Calderon & Falla (2019) reported that high kinesiophobia levels increased pain
intensity in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, were associated with a higher rate
of disability, and negatively affected the quality of life.

Determining the level of kinesiophobia in patients diagnosed with AS and taking the
necessary precautions to prevent kinesiophobia is one of the most important cornerstones
for the success of the treatment of the disease. In this disease, which has limited mobility as
one of its most important manifestations, exercise therapy and prevention of
kinesiophobia are essential for a successful treatment. Therefore, we conducted this study
to determine the level of kinesiophobia in patients diagnosed with AS and to determine
whether there is a relationship between kinesiophobia and demographic characteristics,
disease duration, pain severity, disease activity and level of functional impairment. We
believe that the study results will contribute to strategies to prevent kinesiophobia in AS
patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was designed as a single-center study. The study protocol was approved by the
Bursa Uludağ University Faculty of Medicine Clinical Research Ethics Committee prior to
the conduct of the study (Decision No: 2021-6/60, Date: May 26th, 2021). The study was

Ertem (2025), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.19034

conducted in accordance with the ethical considerations outlined in the Declaration of
Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study.
The study population consisted of AS patients who were consulted to us from different

clinics for various reasons or who were regularly followed up in our outpatient clinic
between July 2021 and July 2023. Minimum sample size calculation was made and it was
determined that a minimum of 15 patients were required for each group (low
kinesiophobia, high kinesiophobia). All patients who applied to the outpatient clinic
within the speciﬁed time period and met the inclusion criteria were included in the study.
During this process, a total of 41 patients applied and 35 met the criteria and agreed to
participate in the study. This number was considered sufﬁcient for study planning.
Diagnosis of AS was made based on modiﬁed New York criteria (Rudwaleit et al., 2009).
While patients who were older than 18 years of age and who had AS for longer than 1 year
were included in the study, patients who had a history of surgery within the last 3 months
and who had comorbidities with uncontrolled chronic pain, especially ﬁbromyalgia,
chronic fatigue syndrome, anxiety disorders and other psychiatric disorders, were excluded
from the study.

The patients’ age, gender, and disease duration were recorded on a patient evaluation
form. Patients’ kinesiophobia level was evaluated with the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia
(TSK), disease activity with the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index
(BASDAI), functionality with the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI),
and pain intensity with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

TSK is a commonly used tool to evaluate the kinesiophobia level. The reliability studies

of the Turkish version of TSK were completed. TSK consists of 17 items. Each item is
assigned a score between 1 and 4 points. Hence, the total score from TSK ranges between
17 and 68 points. The higher the total score, the higher the kinesiophobia level. A total
score of 37 and above indicates a high level of kinesiophobia, and a score below 37
indicates a low level of kinesiophobia. In line with the literature, the threshold TSK score
between low and high kinesiophobia levels was deemed 37 points (Kocyigit & Akaltun,
2020; Tunca et al., 2011; Vlaeyen et al., 1995). Accordingly, the patients were divided into
two groups: patients with a total TSK score <37, i.e., low kinesiophobia group, and patients
with a total TSK score ≥37, i.e., high kinesiophobia group.

BASDAI is a widely used 6-question tool to evaluate disease activity. The reliability
studies of the Turkish version of BASDAI were completed. BASDAI evaluates the level of
weakness and fatigue, the severity of pain and swelling in the spine and other joints, the
degree of sensitivity to touch, especially in the enthesis areas, the degree of discomfort after
waking up, and the duration of morning stiffness. Within the scope of BASDAI, patients
are asked to rate the severity of the said symptoms they experienced in the last week by
marking them on a 10 cm long scale. The average of the scores obtained from the last two
questions, which assess the discomfort and stiffness after waking up, is taken and summed
with the scores of the other four questions. The BASDAI score is obtained by dividing the
total score by 5. BASDAI scores of 4 and above indicate that the patient is in the active
phase of AS (Ay et al., 2004; Calin et al., 1999; Garrett et al., 1994; Karkucak et al., 2010).

BASFI is a 10-question tool used to evaluate the functional status of patients with AS.
The validity and reliability studies of BASFI were completed. BASFI evaluates the degree of
difﬁculty that patients experience in bending over, turning, lying down, standing up from
different surfaces, climbing stairs, and activities of daily living. Within the scope of BASFI,
patients are asked to rate the degree of difﬁculty they experienced while performing the
said activities by marking them on a 10 cm long scale. The total score is obtained by adding
the points given to each question. The BASFI score is obtained by dividing the total score
by 10. The higher the BASFI score, the more severe the functional limitations (Calin et al.,
1994; Gur Kabul et al., 2021; Ozer et al., 2005).

VAS is a scale used to evaluate the pain intensity of patients. Before using VAS, the

meaning of the facial expressions on VAS and what they mean are explained to the
patients. While the state of having no pain is assigned 0 points, the most severe pain felt in
life, expressed as unbearable pain, is assigned 10 points. The patients’ pain intensity in the
last week was determined according to VAS (Arslan et al., 2016; Carlsson, 1983; Inci & Inci,
2023).

Statistical analysis
SPSS 21.0 (Statistical Product and Service Solutions for Windows, Version 21.0; IBM
Corp., Armonk, NY, U.S., 2012) software package was used to conduct the statistical
analyses of the collected data. The results of the statistical analyses were expressed using
descriptive statistics, i.e., mean ± standard deviation values in the case of continuous
variables determined to conform to the normal distribution, as median with minimum and
maximum values in the case of continuous variables determined not to conform to the
normal distribution, and as numbers and percentage values in the case of categorical
variables. The normal distribution characteristics of numerical variables were analyzed
using the Shapiro-Wilk test. In comparing the differences in numerical variables between
two independent groups, the independent samples t-test was used for numerical variables
determined to conform to the normal distribution, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used
for numerical variables determined not to conform to the normal distribution. Fisher’s
exact test was used to compare the differences in categorical variables between the groups.
The correlations between continuous variables were analyzed using correlation analysis.
According to normality test results, Spearman correlation coefﬁcients were calculated.
Probability (p) statistics of <0.05 were deemed to indicate statistical signiﬁcance.

RESULTS
A total of 35 AS patients were included in the study. These patients’ demographic
characteristics, i.e., age, gender, and disease durations are given in Table 1. In addition the
mean TSK scores of the patients and whether they are in the low or high kinesiophobia
group, as well as their mean BASDAI, BASFI, and VAS scores, are shown in Table 1. The
majority of patients included in the study were male. Low-level kinesiophobia was detected
in 57.14% of the patients.

The distribution of patients’ demographic characteristics, disease activity, and pain and
functionality levels by the kinesiophobia groups is given in Table 2. It was found that the

increase in BASDAI, BASFI and VAS scores was associated with a high level of
kinesiophobia (p < 0.001).

The correlations between patients’ TSK scores and age, disease duration, BASDAI,
BASFI, and VAS scores are shown in Table 3. In parallel, correlation analysis revealed
strong positive correlations between TSK score and BASDAI, BASFI, and VAS scores (r:
0.91, r: 0.84, and r: 0.92, respectively) (Pripp, 2018).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, it was found that the BASDAI, BASFI and VAS scores of AS patients
with high kinesiophobia were statistically signiﬁcantly higher than those of AS patients
with low kinesiophobia (p < 0.001). This indicates the importance of exercise therapy in AS
patients. The present study will include a new perspective to the literature on these
ﬁndings. It is also important in terms of showing that kinesiophobia is a very important
modifying factor in the treatment of AS patients.

Although many new treatment options have been developed for AS, exercise therapy

remains the cornerstone of AS treatment. The positive effects of physical exercise and
movement on AS are well-established in the literature (Millner et al., 2016). It is reported in
the literature that exercise therapy increases the quality of life of AS patients, improves
their physical condition, and reduces AS-related symptoms (Liska, 2022).

In a study investigating the relationship between kinesiophobia and quality of life in
patients with AS, Balevi et al. (2020) found the mean TSK score of the AS patients to be
40.92 ± 6.65, indicating a high level of kinesiophobia. In another study conducted with 30
AS patients in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, the mean TSK score of the
patients was found to be 38.9 ± 6.7 (Oksuz et al., 2017). In comparison, of the 35 patients
included in our study, 20 (57.14%) had TSK scores ≥37, i.e., high levels of kinesiophobia,
and 15 (42.86%) had TSK scores <37, i.e., low levels of kinesiophobia. From this
perspective, we see that our results support the literature.

We found that BASDAI, BASFI, and VAS scores of AS patients with high kinesiophobia

were statistically signiﬁcantly higher than those of AS patients with low kinesiophobia
(p < 0.001). Along these lines, Sari et al. (2023) found that TSK score was correlated with
age, disease duration, and BASFI score. In a study evaluating the relationships between
kinesiophobia and pain, quality of life, functional status, disease activity, mobility, and
depression in AS patients, positive signiﬁcant relationships were found between TSK score
and VAS, BASFI, quality of life, and depression scores. On the other hand, there was no
statistically signiﬁcant correlation between TSK and BASDAI scores, even though BASDAI
scores were higher in those with higher TSK scores (Oskay et al., 2017). Selcuk et al. (2018)
found positive relationships between TSK score and VAS-pain (r: 0.684, p: 0.000),
VAS-fatigue (r: 0,494, p: 0.000), BASDAI (r: 0,484, p: 0.001) and BASFI (r: 0.389, p: 0.008)
scores in patients with AS. In general, our study’s ﬁndings correlate with the studies in the
literature evaluating the relationship between AS and kinesiophobia. Today, it is accepted
worldwide that exercise therapy is one of the main components of AS treatment. There is
ample evidence that exercise improves patients’ functional status, disease activity, and

mental state. One of the primary obstacles for patients to exercise is kinesiophobia.
Therefore, patients with high kinesiophobia levels are expected to have worse disease
activity levels, functional statuses, and pain scores. In our study, as expected, AS patients
with high kinesiophobia levels had increased functional dependency, experienced more
pain, and had higher disease activity levels. The fact that we did not ﬁnd a relationship
between kinesiophobia level, age, and disease duration may be attributed to our small
sample size and the fact that most of our patients were followed for a relatively short
period. As a reason, advanced age and long-term pain may create fear of movement in
patients. As a matter of fact, several studies, such as Sari et al.’s (2023) study, have shown
that age and disease duration are associated with kinesiophobia (Altunel Kılınc, Kirmizier
& Orucoglu, 2023). In addition, although the current study has limitations in some respects
compared to the existing literature, it makes a very important contribution to the literature
in terms of clearly showing the positive correlation between disease activity indices and
kinesiophobia level without including individual factors.

The primary limitations of our study were its single-center design and small sample size,
which hindered the generalizability of our results. Other limitations of the study include
not assessing the medications used by the patients, not using other scale used in AS, and
not including smoking and other individual characteristics that may be associated with
movement limitations in patients.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, our ﬁndings showed that AS patients had high levels of kinesiophobia and
that kinesiophobia negatively affected their treatment. Therefore, treatment success in AS
patients depends on taking the necessary precautions before the development of
kinesiophobia and early interventions after the development of kinesiophobia. In this
context, we think that our study will provide guidance in prescribing exercise therapy to
AS patients and contribute to the literature. In addition, our results revealed a strong
relationship between BASDAI, BASFI scores, which objectively indicate AS activity, and
high kinesiophobia. Kinesiophobia, which is often overlooked by clinicians, is related to
treatment success in such an important and disabling disease. The results of the current
study will make a signiﬁcant contribution to the literature in this regard and clearly show
the importance of evaluating the level of kinesiophobia at every stage of treatment,
including treatment planning and changes in treatment regimens in such patients. If we
look at the issue from the patients’ perspective, the study results indicate that reducing the
level of kinesiophobia will also be effective in pain palliation. In this respect, it is revealed
that kinesiophobia should be carefully considered when evaluating the relationship
between AS and pain in the literature.
