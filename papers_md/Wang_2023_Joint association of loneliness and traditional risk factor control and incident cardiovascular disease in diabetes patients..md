Abstract

Aims

To investigate the prospective associations of the loneliness and social isolation scales with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk 
in diabetes patients and compare the relative importance of loneliness and social isolation with traditional risk factors. Also, 
the interactions of loneliness or isolation with the degree of risk factor control in relation to CVD risk were evaluated.

Methods 
A total of 18 509 participants diagnosed with diabetes from the UK Biobank were included. A two-item scale and a three-

item scale were used to assess loneliness and isolation levels, respectively. The degree of risk factor control was defined as 
numbers of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure (BP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), smoking, and 
kidney condition controlled within the target range. During a mean follow-up of 10.7 years, 3247 total CVD incidents were 
documented, including 2771 coronary heart disease and 701 strokes. In the fully adjusted model, compared with participants 
with the lowest loneliness score (zero), hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for CVD were 1.11 (1.02 and 1.20) and 1.26 
(1.11 and 1.42) for participants with a loneliness scale of 1 and 2, respectively (P-trend < 0.001). No significant associations 
were observed for social isolation. Loneliness ranked higher in relative strength for predicting CVD than the lifestyle risk 
factors in diabetes patients. A significant additive interaction between loneliness and the degree of risk factor control on 
the risk of CVD was observed (P for additive interaction = 0.005).

Introduction

Individuals with diabetes have a two- to three-fold higher risk of cardio-
vascular disease (CVD) than individuals without diabetes.1,2 Recently, 
the American Heart Association issued a statement calling for attention 
to the importance of the social determinants of health (SDOH) in dia-
betes patients in addition to traditional risk factors.3 However, the rele-
vant evidence is still lacking.

Loneliness  and  social  isolation  are  two  important  components  of 
SDOH,  reflecting  different  aspects  of  social  contact.4,5 Loneliness 

usually refers to the emotional feelings related to the quality of social 
relations, while isolation refers to the quantity of social relations in be-
havior.6,7 Although the concepts of loneliness and social isolation are 
often discussed and compared to each other, they are quite different 
in nature and have different health consequences.6–9 Several previous 
studies in the general population have found that loneliness and social 
isolation are both significantly related to a higher risk of CVD.6,10,11
Notably,  growing  evidence  shows  that  individuals  with  diabetes 

What is the association of loneliness or social isolation with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetes and their relative importancecompared to traditional risk factors? Is there any interaction between loneliness and the degree of risk factor control on CVD risk?Loneliness, but not social isolation, was associated with a higher risk of CVD in diabetes, ranked higher for predicting CVD thantraditional lifestyle factors. The detrimental effect of loneliness and of a low degree of risk factor control on CVD risk was greater than additive (P for additive interaction=0.005).Loneliness in diabetic patients is a potent and probably neglected risk factor for CVD.Key QuestionKey FindingTake Home MessageR200.0010.0020.003Cardiovascular diseaseCardiovascular diseaseHR (95% CI)LDL cholesterolBMIAlbumin-to-creatinine ratioEstimated GFRLonelinessGlycated haemoglobinSystolic blood pressureDepressionSmokingTownsend deprivation indexPhysical activityDietSocial isolationIncreasing importance1.20 (1.07–1.35)0.002Not lonely1 (Reference)Loneliness1.03 (0.93–1.14)0.586Not isolated1 (Reference)Social isolationP valueJoint association of loneliness and traditional risk factor control and incident cardiovascular disease in diabetes patients                                        2585

experience significantly higher levels of loneliness and isolation than in-
dividuals without diabetes,12,13 whereas little is known about the asso-
ciation  of  loneliness  or  social  isolation  with  CVD  risk  in  diabetes 
patients.

Moreover, previous studies showed that controlling for multiple trad-
itional risk factors, such as high glycemia, high blood pressure (BP), dysli-
pidemia,  smoking,  and  a  poor  kidney  condition,  might  lower  but  not 
entirely eliminate the diabetes-related excess risk of CVD.14,15 It is un-
clear  whether  the  association  between  traditional  risk  factor  control 
and  the  risk  of  CVD  differs  by  the  status  of  loneliness  or  isolation. 
Therefore, in this study, we investigated the prospective associations of 
the loneliness and social isolation scales with CVD risk in diabetes pa-
tients  and  particularly  compared  the  relative  importance  of  loneliness 
and  social  isolation  to  traditional  risk  factors  (e.g.  lifestyle  factors  and 
metabolic risk factors) in predicting CVD risk. Moreover, we also evalu-
ated the interactions of loneliness or isolation with the degree of risk fac-
tor control in relation to CVD risk by applying multiplicative interaction 
and additive interaction more relevant to the public health measures.

Methods

Study design and population
The UK Biobank Study is a population-based cohort study; the detailed study 
design and methods have been described previously.16 Briefly, UK Biobank re-
cruited more than 0.5 million participants, aged 37 to 73, at 22 assessment 
centers throughout England, Wales, and Scotland from 2006 to 2010. All par-
ticipants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by 
the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee and the Tulane 
University Biomedical Committee Institutional Review Board.

In this study, our analyses were restricted to participants who had diabetes 
at baseline, which was defined based on the onset time of diabetes (before or 
equal to the date of attending the assessment center) or a self-reported his-
tory  of  diabetes  diagnosed  by  a  doctor  (n = 26 863)  (see  Supplementary 
material  online,  Table  S1).  A  total  of  18 509  participants  were  included  in 
the main analysis after excluding 6219 participants with prevalent coronary 
heart disease (CHD), stroke, or heart failure and 2135 participants with miss-
ing values on information about loneliness or isolation.

Definition of loneliness and isolation scales
In the UK Biobank, the scales of loneliness and social isolation were con-
structed based on several previous studies with a self-reported question-
naire.7–9,11 The loneliness scale was assessed through two questions, “Do 
you often feel lonely?” and “How often are you able to confide in some-
one  close to you?”  High-risk loneliness  factors were defined  as feeling 
lonely and being able to confide less than once a month. The social isola-
tion scale was measured with three questions: (i) “Including yourself, how 
many people are living together in your household?”; (ii) “How often do 
you visit friends or family or have them visit you?”; (iii) “Which of the fol-
lowing leisure/social activities do you engage in once a week or more of-
ten?”.  High-risk  isolation  factors  were  defined  as  living  alone,  having 
friends and family visit less than once a month, and no participating in so-
cial activity at least once per week. Participants with high-risk factors were 
coded as 1, and those with low-risk factors were coded as 0. The scale of 
loneliness  or  social  isolation  was  calculated  by  summing  the  individual 
scores of the two or three corresponding factors, respectively, with a 
range of 0–2 or 0–3. Higher scores indicate higher levels of loneliness 
or social isolation. We further classified the loneliness status as loneliness 
(loneliness scale =2) and non-loneliness (loneliness scale <2).7–9,11 Social 
isolation status was classified as isolation (isolation scale ≥2) and non- 
isolation (isolation scale <2).7–9,11

Definition of traditional risk factor control
According to the previous studies and guidelines,14,15,17,18five risk factors were 
used to define diabetes patients with different numbers of traditional risk factor 
control, including glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), BP, low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol, smoking, and kidney condition. We defined glycemic control 
as HbA1c level <53 mmol/mol (7.0%), lipid control as LDL cholesterol level 
<100 mg/dL,  BP  control  as  mean  systolic  BP  and  diastolic  BP  level  <140/ 
90 mm Hg, non-current smoking as a combination of never and past smoking, 
and control of kidney condition as a combination of an albumin-to-creatinine 
ratio  (ACR)  <10 mg/g  and  an  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate  (eGFR) 
≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2.14,15,19 This cut point for ACR was chosen according to 
the previous evidence that diabetes patients with an ACR value between 10 
and 29 mg/g already had a significant higher CVD risk compared with patients 
with ACR <10 mg/g19,20 Moreover, a more relaxed cut point was used to de-
fine  optimal  control  of  the  kidney  condition  (ACR  <30 mg/g  and  eGFR 
≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2) in sensitivity analysis.21 Also, because it is difficult and of-
ten impossible to make eGFR better even though the rate of eGFR decline can 
be changed, we performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding eGFR from the risk 
factor control to provide a point of view on clinical application. The degree of 
traditional risk factor control was classified as low (0–1 risk factor control), me-
dium (2–3 risk factor control), and high (4–5 risk factor control).

Outcomes
Baseline participants were linked to hospital inpatient records to obtain data on 
admissions, diagnoses, and deaths. The primary outcomes of the present study 
were incident CVD and its two major component endpoints: CHD and stroke. 
We defined outcomes according to the International Classification of Diseases, 
10th revision (ICD-10) codes: I20–I25 for CHD and I60–I64 for stroke. The 
follow-up time was calculated from the date of the baseline to the diagnosis 
of the outcome, death, or the censoring date (23 May 2021), whichever oc-
curred first. Detailed information on the ascertainment of outcomes is available 
online at https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi? id=2000.

Covariates
Self-reported information was collected by a touch-screen questionnaire, 
including age, sex, race, the Townsend deprivation index, physical activity 
(minutes  of  moderate  or  vigorous  physical  activity  or  an  equivalent 
combination  per  week22)  moderate  drinking  (alcohol  intake  >0 g  and 
≤14 g/day  for  women  and  alcohol  intake  >0 g  and  ≤28 g/day  for 
men23), healthy diet score, depression score, family history of heart disease 
or stroke (among first-degree relatives including father, mother, and siblings), 
diabetes medication (insulin  use, oral antidiabetic  drugs only, and neither), 
antihypertensive medication, and statin or other lipid lowering medication. 
The  Townsend  deprivation  index  is  a  composite  measure  of  deprivation 
based  on  unemployment,  non-car  ownership,  non-home  ownership,  and 
household  overcrowding.24 A  healthy  diet  score  was  calculated  based  on 
vegetable  intake  (≥median),  fruit  intake  (≥median),  fish  intake  (≥median), 
red meat intake (<median), and processed red meat intake (<median); one 
point was given for each favorable diet factor, and the total diet score ranges 
from 0 to 5.25 Depressive symptoms were measured with the two questions 
from  the  Patient  Health  Questionnaire-2,  including  the  frequency  of  de-
pressed  mood  and  disinterest  or  absence  of  enthusiasm  in  the  previous 
2 weeks. For each item, if participants answered, “not at all,” “several days,” 
“more than half the days,” or “nearly every day,” they were coded as 0, 1, 
2, and 3, respectively. The total depression score ranged from 0 to 6 by adding 
the scores for the two items.26 Information on diabetes medication was ex-
tracted from both self-reported data and the nurse’s verbal interview.27

Height and weight were measured during the assessment visit, and body 
mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in 
meters squared (kg/m²). Albumin-to-creatinine ratio was calculated by the 
concentration of urine albumin and creatinine.21 The eGFR was calculated 
by serum creatinine and age according to race and sex.28 Information on 
diabetes  duration,  diabetes  complications  (diabetes-related  amputation, 
neuropathy,  cataract,  retinopathy,  and  arthropathy),  and  diabetes  types

was defined through the inpatient health record. We coded missing covari-
ates as a missing indicator category for categorical variables and with mean 
values for  continuous variables.  In sensitivity analysis, we impute  missing 
covariate values with multivariate imputation by chained equations and re-
peat the analyses. Further detailed descriptions of these measurements are 
provided in the Supplementary material and can be found at the UK Biobank 
website (https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase).

Statistical analysis
Analyses of covariance (generalized linear models) and chi-square were used for 
comparison of continuous and categorical variables, respectively, between dia-
betes patients who were lonely and those who were not lonely and between 
those who were isolated and those who were not isolated. Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to evaluate the association between the loneliness or 
isolation scale and the risk of CVD separately, and follow-up years were used as 
the underlying time metric. The proportional hazards assumption was tested 
based on Schoenfeld residuals, and all analyses were satisfied. In the multivariable 
adjusted model, we controlled for age, sex, race, the Townsend deprivation in-
dex, diabetes duration, diabetes complications, types of diabetes, family history 
of CVD, CHD or stroke (in the corresponding model), BMI, the use of diabetes 
medication, cholesterol-lowering medication, and antihypertensive medication. 

Next, we further included lifestyle factors (physical activity, healthy diet score, 
and moderate drinking), depression score, and the control of traditional risk fac-
tors into the model, separately and simultaneously. A directed acyclic graph ex-
plaining  the  association  between  the  exposures,  the  outcome,  and  the 
covariates is available in Supplementary material online, Figure S1. To estimate 
whether  the  association  of  loneliness  or  social  isolation  with  incident  CVD 
was independent of each other, a sensitive analysis was performed to mutually 
adjust. Also, another sensitive analysis was performed to take the competing risk 
of death into account by using Fine and Gray’s proportional sub-hazards model.
To estimate how important loneliness or isolation is in predicting CVDs, 
we analyzed the relative importance of loneliness or isolation and other 
traditional risk factors by calculating the R2 values of the Cox models.14,29
The explainable log-likelihood attributed to each risk factor was also calcu-
lated to test the consistency of our results.14

In addition, we classified participants according to the joint categories of 
loneliness or isolation and the degree of risk factor control. To investigate 
whether the association of loneliness or isolation with CVD is modified by 
the  degree of  risk factor  control,  we performed  both  multiplicative and 
additive  interaction  analyses.  The  multiplicative  interaction  was  accessed 
by adding the product terms to the original Cox models. To assess the addi-
tive interaction, we coded variables by assigning the stratum with the lowest 
risk as the reference (non-loneliness and five risk factors controlled) and

stroke events. We found that the loneliness scale, but not the isolation 
scale,  was  significantly  associated  with  higher  risks  of  total  CVD  and 
CHD  among  diabetes  patients  (Table  2 and  Supplementary  material 
online, Table S3). In the multivariable adjusted model, compared with par-
ticipants with the lowest loneliness score (0), hazard ratios (HRs) [95% 
confidence interval (CI)] for total CVD were 1.15 (1.07, 1.25) and 1.38 
(1.23, 1.54) for participants with a loneliness scale of 1 and 2, respectively 
(P-trend < 0.001) (Table 2). The results were not appreciated changed if 
we further adjusted for lifestyle factors (physical activity, moderate drink-
ing, and healthy diet score), depression score, or traditional risk factor con-
trol  (HbA1c  control,  BP  control,  LDL  cholesterol  control,  no  current 
smoking, and control of kidney function) in the model. The association 
was slightly attenuated but still significant if all these covariates were in-
cluded in  the model, with HRs (95% CI) of 1.11 (1.02, 1.20) and 1.26 
(1.11, 1.42) for participants with a loneliness scale of 1 and 2 (P-trend 
<0.001). Similar results were observed for CHD. For stroke, in the model 
that included all the covariates, the loneliness scale was not significantly as-
sociated with stroke. We did not find a significant association between the 
social isolation scale and CVD, CHD, or stroke, if we included all the cov-
ariates in the models (see Supplementary material online, Table S3). Similar 
associations were observed when we adjusted for loneliness and isolation 
mutually in one model in sensitive analysis (see Supplementary material 
online,  Table  S4).  Additionally,  the  results  did  not  appreciably  change 
when  the  competing  risk  of  death  was  considered  in  the  analysis  or 
when  multiple  imputation  was  used  to  impute  the  missing  covariates 
(see Supplementary material online, Tables S5 and S6). Furthermore, we 
observed that the association between loneliness and CVD did not appear 
to be modified by covariates (see Supplementary material online, Table S7).

The relative importance of loneliness and 
isolation comparing with traditional risk 
factors in predicting cardiovascular disease 
among diabetic patients
We assessed the relative importance of loneliness and isolation in predicting 
CVD among diabetes patients in comparison to other traditional risk fac-
tors (Figure 1). We observed that, among a few selected factors, loneliness 
was in fifth place for CVD risk in diabetes patients. Loneliness ranked lower 
in relative strength for predicting CVD than LDL cholesterol, BMI, and ACR, 
similar to eGFR, HbA1c, and systolic BP levels, but higher than depression 
score and lifestyle risk factors such as smoking, physical activity, and diet. To 
validate our findings, we also examined the relative strengths of these risk 
factors  for  CVDs  using  explained  log-likelihood  (see  Supplementary 
material online, Figure S2) and found that the ranking of loneliness was con-
sistent with that observed using explained relative risk (R2) model.

Joint association of loneliness and risk 
factor control with cardiovascular disease 
among diabetic patients
We further assessed the joint association between the scale of loneliness 
and the degree of risk factor control with the risk of CVD (Table 3). The 
baseline  characteristics  of  diabetes  patients  according  to  the  degree  of 
risk  factor  control  are  presented  in  Supplementary  material  online, 
Table S8. Compared with individuals (reference group) who did not feel 
lonely and had a high degree of risk factor control (controlling 4–5 risk fac-
tors), the HR was 1.50 (95% CI,1.30–1.73) for individuals who did not feel 
lonely and had a low degree of risk factor control (0–1 factor), whereas the 
HR further increased to 1.93 (95% CI, 1.47–2.54) in individuals who felt 
lonely and had a low degree of risk factor control (0–1 factor). We found

considered them as continuous variables.30 The relative excess risk due to 
interaction (RERI) and the attributable proportion (AP) were assessed as 
described in our previous studies.25,31

Statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute 
Inc.  Cary,  NC,  USA)  and  R  version  3.6.1  (R  Foundation  for  Statistical 
Computing,  Vienna,  Austria).  All  P-values  were  two-sided,  and  P < 0.05 
was considered statistically significant.

Results

Study population
The baseline information of diabetes patients without prevalent CVD 
according to the loneliness scale or social isolation scale is presented 
in Table 1 and Supplementary material online, Table S2, respectively. 
Among 18 509 diabetes patients, 61.1%, 29.6%, and 9.3% participants 
were  defined  as  having  a  loneliness  scale  of  0,  1,  or  2,  respectively. 
The corresponding percentage was 44.9%, 41.9%, and 13.2% for parti-
cipants with isolation scale of 0, 1, or ≥2. Patients who had a higher 
loneliness or isolation scale were younger, had higher Townsend de-
privation  index,  were  less  likely  to  be  non-current  smoker,  drink  in 
moderation, and eat a healthy diet, as compared with their counter-
parts  who  had  a  lower  loneliness  or  social  isolation  scale.  Patients 
with a higher loneliness or isolation scale tended to have higher BMI, 
HbA1c, depression score, and a lower degree of risk factor  control 
and were more likely to use insulin and to have diabetes complications.

find  a  significant  multiplicative  interaction  (P = 0.098)  between  loneliness 
and the degree of risk factor control on the risk of CVD (Table 3). Similar 
patterns of interaction were observed in sensitive analysis if a more relaxed 
cut point (ACR <30 mg/g and eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2) was used to de-
fine optimal control of kidney condition (see Supplementary material online, 
Table S9, P for additive interaction = 0.035; P for multiplicative interaction =  
0.232), or if eGFR was excluded from the definition of risk factor control 
(see Supplementary material online, Table S10, P for additive interaction =  
0.002; P for multiplicative interaction = 0.071).

Discussion
This study generated two key findings. First, we found that a higher loneli-
ness scale, but not social isolation scale, was significantly associated with a 
higher risk of CVD in diabetes patients, and loneliness ranked higher in 

than

factors (Structured Graphical Abstract). Second, we observed that the 
risk of CVD associated with a combination of loneliness and a low degree 
of traditional risk factor control was greater than the addition of the risk 
associated with each of these factors, indicating a significant interaction 
on an additive scale.

Our study, for the first time, showed that loneliness was significantly 
related to a higher risk of CVD in diabetic patients. Our findings were 
supported  by  the  results  from  several  previous  studies  studying  the 
general  population,  in  which  loneliness  was  found  to  be  associated 
with  higher  risks  of  CVD  events.32,33 A  cohort  study  from  England 
showed that a one-point increase in the loneliness scale was associated 
with a 5%–8% increase in the hazard of CVD in the general popula-
tion.32 Another study from the UK showed that loneliness was signifi-
cantly associated with a higher risk of acute myocardial infarction in the 
general  population  when  separately  adjusting  for  biological  factors, 
health  behaviors,  depressive  symptoms,  or  socioeconomic  factors, 
whereas such an association was no longer significant when these fac-
tors were fully adjusted in the model (HR 1.06, 95% CI, 0.96–1.17).11 In 
our study, the associations between the loneliness scale and the risks of 
CVD and CHD among diabetes patients remained significant after ad-
justing for similar covariates. Our findings could be potentially explained 
by the evidence that diabetic patients not only have a higher risk of CVD 
but also experience higher levels of loneliness than individuals without 
diabetes.13 Moreover, we compared the relative importance of loneli-
ness with traditional risk factors in predicting CVD among diabetes pa-
tients and found that the relative strength of loneliness was greater than 
the lifestyle risk factors, including smoking, physical activity, and diet.

In this study, we did not find a significant association between social iso-
lation and CVDs among diabetes patients. Consistent with our findings, a 
prospective study from the Women’s Health Initiative also did not find a 
significant association between social network size (constructed by married 
or in an intimate relationship, times attending activities, and number of re-
latives) and CHD risk among women with diabetes.34 Our findings are also 
supported by the results of intervention studies examining the impact of so-
cial  support  on  outcomes  in  diabetes  patients,35–40 which  found  that 
behavior-related interventions had no effect on changes in cardiometabolic 
biomarkers such as HbA1c and BP,36,37 whereas emotion-related interven-
tions such as peer support consistently resulted in greater improvement in 
these biomarkers.38–40 Different from loneliness, which refers to a negative 
emotional feeling toward social contacts and relationships, social isolation

refers to the scarcity of social contacts and relationships in behavior.6,41,42
Our findings suggest that the quality of social context (emotional) may play 
a  more  important  role  than  quantity  (behavioral)  in  determining  CVD 
among diabetes patients.

We observed that among diabetes patients, the CVD risk associated 
with a combination of loneliness and a low degree of risk factor control 
was greater than the addition of the risks associated with each of these 
factors,  indicating  a  significant  interaction  on  an  additive  scale. 
Specifically,  if  both  loneliness  and  a  low  degree  of  risk  factor  control 
were present, this would result in an additional 8.5% of cases of CVD. 
The observed effect size of additive interaction in this study is modest 
in magnitude. However, given the high prevalence of diabetes and the in-
creasing trend worldwide, such a percentage increase is considerable re-
garding  the  number  of  patients  affected  by  CVD  complications  and 
therefore has important public health implications. The additive interac-
tions could distinguish whether the effect of the risk factor on a certain 
disease differed across subgroups; thus, they are more relevant to public 
health as compared with multiplicative interactions. Our findings indicate 
that the public health consequence of a low degree of risk factor control 
would be greater in diabetes patients with loneliness.

The major strengths of this study include the prospective study de-
sign, the large sample size of diabetes patients with available data on 
loneliness and isolation, and the comprehensive and detailed informa-
tion on covariates in diabetes patients. We also acknowledge several 
potential limitations of this study. Firstly, due to the nature of an obser-
vational study, we cannot draw any conclusions about the causality be-
tween the loneliness scale and the risk of CVD. Second, the loneliness 
and social isolation scales were constructed based on simple questions, 
which may not be able to adequately assess the complex phenomenon 
of social networking and interaction. However, these scales have been 
widely used in several previous studies from different cohorts,7–9,11,43
suggesting such scales are effective in population studies. Third, despite 
the large sample size of the study and long follow-up period, the inci-
dence of stroke was still low; thus, our results on stroke should be in-
terpreted  as  exploratory.  Fourth,  we  did  not  adjust  for  cognitive 
function in this study because only a limited number of UK Biobank par-
ticipants completed the cognitive test at baseline. Future studies consid-
ering  these  factors  are  warranted.  Fifth,  only  ∼12%  of  our  study 
participants  were  non-White  European;  whether  our  findings  could 
be generalized to other race/ethnic groups would need to be further 
tested.  Sixth,  the  participants  from  the  UK  Biobank  are  more  likely 
to have healthier behaviors and may not be a representation of the 
general UK population.16 However, a valid assessment of exposure– 
disease relationships may not require a representative population.44

Conclusion
Our findings indicate that a higher loneliness scale, but not isolation 
scale, was significantly associated with a higher risk of CVD in diabetic 
patients, and loneliness ranked higher in relative strength for predicting 
CVD than the lifestyle risk factors. The effect of loneliness and a low 
degree of risk factor control on the risk of CVD is greater than additive 
among diabetic patients. These results highlight the importance of lone-
liness in the prediction of CVDs among diabetic patients.
