Abstract 
Background  Differentiation of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and bipolar I disorder (BD) has been challenging. 
The assessment of shared symptoms in the context of the overall personality functioning, the patient’s sense of self, 
and the quality of his object (interpersonal) relations is proposed to be valuable for the differential diagnosis of these 
disorders.

Methods  We empirically investigated the level of personality organization (PO), identity integration, and quality 
of object relations in patients suffering from BD or BPD using the Structured Interview of Personality Organization 
(STIPO) and the Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS) in 34 BPD and 28 BD patients as well as 27 healthy con-
trol persons. Group comparisons and a logistic regression model were calculated to analyze group differences.

Results  The BPD group showed significantly greater impairment in several domains of personality functioning, 
namely “identity”, and “self- and other-directed aggression”, while showing lower impairment in “moral values”. The 
overall level of PO in the BPD group was significantly lower when excluding not only BPD but any personality disorder 
(PD) in the BD sample. Severity of impaired personality structure had a major impact on symptom load independent 
of the main diagnosis BD or BPD.

Conclusions  Our data show greater impairment in personality functioning in BPD than in BD patients. BD patients 
present with varying levels of PO, whereas in BPD severe deficits in PO are pathognomonic. The level of PO has a sig-
nificant impact on symptom severity in both BD and BPD patients. Therefore, careful assessment of PO should be 
considered for differential diagnosis and adequate treatment planning.

Background
Borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD)  and  bipolar  dis-
order  (BD)  are  both  debilitating  psychiatric  illnesses. 
Differentiation  of  these  disorders  has  been  challeng-
ing,  especially  regarding  BD  type  2,  but  also  BD  type  1, 
as there are many shared symptoms [1, 2]. These include 
emotional and affective instability, aggression and anger, 
changes  in  self-esteem,  impulsivity  such  as  sexual  dis-
inhibition,  antisocial  behavior,  alcohol  and  substance 
misuse, self-harm behavior and suicidality [3, 4]. On the 
contrary,  these  disorders  are  also  known  to  have  major 
differences,  namely  neurobiological,  genetic,  epidemio-
logical,  etiological,  regarding  the  course  of  illness  and

the therapeutic targets [5–8]. Nevertheless, the accurate 
diagnosis in the clinical setting remains challenging, and 
further  studies  addressing  these  issues  from  a  clinical 
point  of  view  are  called  for  [9–11].  Neuropsychologi-
cal  profiles  appeared  to  be  more  similar  than  different 
in BD and BPD [12], screening instruments for BD have 
been  shown  to  be  ineffective  in  distinguishing  between 
BD  and  BPD  [13],  and  anger  and  Cluster  B  personality 
traits were associated with the conversion from unipolar 
depression  to  BD  [14].  Furthermore,  BD  and  BPD  have 
a  high  incidence  of  co-occurrence  [15–17].  Euthymic 
bipolar  patients  assessed  by  a  structured  interview  had 
rates of comorbid personality disorder (PD) around 30% 
[17], including BPD. These observations even resulted in 
a  debate  among  clinicians  and  researchers,  whether  the 
two disorders really are separate entities [18, 19].

is  recommended 

The  correct  diagnosis  of  these  disorders  is  of  impor-
tance,  since  treatment  differs  significantly.  Psychop-
harmacological  treatment 
in  BD 
[6],  whereas  patients  with  BPD  appear  to  have  lower 
response rates to medication [20] and first line treatment 
consists  of  specific  psychotherapeutic  modalities  [21] 
such  as  Transference  Focused  Psychotherapy  (TFP;  [22, 
23]),  Dialectical  Behavioral  Treatment  (DBT;  [24,  25]), 
Schema- Focused Therapy (SFT; [26]), and Mentalization 
Based Treatment (MBT; [27, 28]).

Recently,  it  has  been  proposed  that  the  assessment  of 
symptoms in the context of the overall personality func-
tioning, the patient’s sense  of self, and  the  quality of his 
object  (interpersonal)  relations  is  valuable  for  the  dif-
ferential  diagnosis  of  the  two  disorders  [18,  29–32]. 
Focusing on the dimensions of identity, self-concept and 
self-esteem,  a  recent  review  [33]  found  identity  diffu-
sion  as  a  pathognomonic  feature  in  BPD  as  opposed  to 
BD,  where  a  more  unified  and  coherent  self-concept  is 
present.  Identity  diffusion  refers  to  a  marked  lack  of  an 
integrated  concept  of  the  self  and  severe,  chronic  dis-
crepancies in the assessment of the self [34]. The authors 
conclude  that  comparative  studies  examining  the  core 
symptom of identity diffusion are needed as heterogene-
ity  in  methods,  measures  and  theories  limited  the  com-
parability of the reviewed studies [33]. Studies comparing 
BD  and  BPD  regarding  relations  to  significant  others 
found  that  BPD  patients  had  more  difficulties  in  estab-
lishing and maintaining reciprocal relationships [1].

The  recognition  of  the  importance  of  the  concept 
of  personality  functioning,  identity,  and  interpersonal 
functioning converges with psychoanalytic or psychody-
namic  viewpoints  of  mental  disorders.  One  of  the  most 
influential  models  for  the  assessment  of  personality 
functioning  was  developed  by  Kernberg  and  colleagues 
[34–36]. Based on empirical and theoretical literature on 
the  development  of  personality  and  psychic  functioning 

Kernberg  proposed  three  basic  levels  of  personality 
organization  (PO):  neurotic,  borderline,  and  psychotic 
PO  [34,  37]. They  differ  in  terms  of  identity  integration, 
quality  of  object  relations,  maturity  of  defense  mecha-
nisms, and the capacity for reality testing [36]. In recent 
years, standardized instruments for the assessment of PO 
were designed with good psychometric properties which 
have been used for the study of diverse psychopathologi-
cal  phenomena.  These  considerations  are  in  line  with  a 
renewed interest in questions of personality functioning 
in  mental  disorders  published  in  the  diagnostic  classifi-
cation systems DSM-5 [38] and ICD-11 [39]. Section III 
of the DSM-5 and ICD-11 propose a model for personal-
ity  disorders  focusing  on  the  impairment  in  personality 
functioning  consisting  of  the  domains  of  self  and  inter-
personal functioning [40].

In light of the current discussion we want to expand the 
knowledge  of  differential  diagnostics  with  an  in-depth 
comparison  of  personality  functioning  in  BPD  versus 
BD. We empirically investigated the level of PO, identity 
integration, and quality of object relations in patients suf-
fering from BD or BPD. Based on empirical and clinical 
considerations,  we  hypothesized  that  there  exist  signifi-
cant differences in these areas between the two disorders 
[1,  18,  29,  33].  We  specifically  hypothesized  that  distur-
bances in the domain of identity would be more promi-
nent in BPD than in BD. Furthermore, we expected more 
severe  impairment  in  the  quality  of  object  relations  in 
BPD patients than in BD.

Methods
Subjects

Patients were recruited from the Department of Psychia-
try  and  Psychotherapy  and  the  Department  of  Psychoa-
nalysis  and  Psychotherapy  of  the  Medical  University  of 
Vienna and from several psychiatric departments of hos-
pitals  situated  in  Vienna  and  surroundings.  Participants 
of  the  healthy  control  group  (HC)  were  recruited  via 
announcements. This study was part of a larger research 
project  investigating  personality  functioning  in  severe 
mental  disorders,  of  which  first  results  have  previously 
been published [41].

All  participants  met  the  following  inclusion  crite-
ria:  Age ≥ 18  years  and  sufficient  command  of  German. 
Exclusion  criteria  were  comorbidity  between  BPD  and 
BD,  severe  cognitive  impairment,  psychiatric  symptoms 
due  to  any  organic  condition  or  acute  intoxication.  For 
secondary  analyses  a  sub-sample  of  BD  patients  with-
out any comorbid PD was formed (BD-). The secondary 
analysis was done to elucidate deficiencies in personality 
structure, that are relevant in all PDs, in BD without any 
comorbid PD.

Participants of the HC group were included if they had 
no  diagnosis  of  a  current  psychiatric  disorder  according 
to  SCID-I  and  -II  [42,  43]  and  subjects  were  excluded 
with  a  Global  Severity  Index  (GSI) > 0.32  on  the  Brief 
Symptom Inventory (BSI [44]).

Interviews were conducted by psychiatrists or psycho-
therapists  who  were  trained  in  administration  of  each 
interview and passed interrater reliability testing (ICC for 
the overall Structured Interview of Personality Organiza-
tion (STIPO) rating: 0.760).

Out of 116 individuals who agreed to participate in the 
study after initial information, 98 completed at least one 
interview appointment. After data entry and verification, 
9 participants were excluded due to missing data on the 
main instruments (SCID, STIPO; e.g. when patients only 
completed one of the interviews and did not show up for 
the  follow-up-date)  or  for  not  fulfilling  the  inclusion/
exclusion criteria (e.g. a co-morbidity of BPD and BD was 
shown  in  the  SCID-interview).  Valid  data  of  89  partici-
pants (34 BPD, 28 BD patients and 27 HC) could finally 
be included for statistical analysis.

Procedures
Structured interview for DSM‑IV (SCID‑I and ‑II [42, 43])

The SCID was used for categorial diagnosis  of  psychiat-
ric disorders according to DSM-IV on axis I (SCID I) and 
personality disorders (SCID II).

Structured interview of personality organization [36]

The  STIPO  [36,  45]  is  grounded  in  Kernberg’s  model  of 
PO [34]. The German version [37] consists of 100 items, 
seven  domains  and  specific  subdomains:  1.  Identity, 
1.A.  Capacity  to  invest,  1.B.  Sense  of  self,  a)  Coherence 
and continuity, b) Self valuation, 1.C. Sense of others, 2. 
Object  relations,  2.A.  Interpersonal  relationships,  2.B. 
Intimate  relationships  and  sexuality,  2.C.  Internal  work-
ing model of relationships, 3. Primitive defenses, 4. Cop-
ing / rigidity, 5. Aggression, 5.A. Self-directed aggression, 
5.B. Other-directed aggression, 6. Moral values, 7. Reality 
testing.  Each  domain  is  rated  on  a  five-point  scale  from 
healthy  functioning  (1  point)  to  severe  impairment  (5 
points).  Finally,  the  overall  level  of  PO  is  assessed  rang-
ing from a normal level to severely impaired personality 
functioning: (1) normal, (2) neurotic 1, (3) neurotic 2, (4) 
borderline  1,  (5)  borderline  2,  and  (6)  borderline  3.  Sat-
isfactory reliability and validity have been demonstrated 
[37, 46].

STIPO-interrater  reliability  between  the  six  raters 
(VB, AF, KF, MG, MK, KP) was assessed after an inten-
sive  STIPO  training  under  the  supervision  of  a  senior 
STIPO-scholar (SD) and was based on six training cases 
which were not part of this study. ICC were calculated in 
SPSS  with  a  two  way  mixed  model  with  single  measure 

and  absolute  agreement  with  the  following  results  for 
all  STIPO  domains:  overall  level  of  PO:  0.760;  identity: 
0.707; object relations: 0.706; defense mechanisms: 0.708; 
coping: 0.636; aggression: 0.899; moral values: 0.482; real-
ity  testing:  0.785.  To  minimize  skewed  assessment,  the 
STIPO interview was administered first, followed by the 
SCID interview afterwards.

Level of personality functioning scale (LPFS [47, 48])

The LPFS [47] is part of the DSM-5, section III [48] and 
assesses  personality  functioning  on  a  five-point  scale 
from  healthy  functioning  (level = 0)  to  extreme  impair-
ment  (level = 4)  in  two  domains  and  four  sub-facets: 
“Self-functioning”  with  the  facets:  “Identity”  and  “Self-
direction”; and “Interpersonal-functioning” with the fac-
ets:  “Empathy”  and  “Intimacy”.  The  German  version  of 
the  LPFS  with  good  psychometric  properties  was  rated 
on the basis of the STIPO interviews [49].

The personality inventory for DSM‑5 – brief form (PID‑5‑BF 
[50, 51])

The  Personality  Inventory  for  DSM-5  Brief  Form  (PID-
5-BF) is a 25-item self-rated personality trait assessment 
scale for adults age 18 and older [50, 51]. It is part of the 
alternative model for the assessment of personality disor-
ders in DSM-5, section III [38]. It assesses 5 personality 
trait  domains  including  “Negative  affect”,  “Detachment”, 
“Antagonism”,  “Disinhibition”,  and  “Psychoticism”,  with 
each  trait  domain  consisting  of  5  items  and  each  item 
being assessed on a 4-point scale (from 0 = very false or 
often false to 3 = very true or often true). The psychomet-
ric  properties  of  the  PID-5-BF  have  been  shown  to  be 
adequate [51, 52].

Brief symptom inventory (BSI [44, 53])

The Brief Symptom Inventory is the short version of the 
Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90 [53]). The questionnaire 
consists  of  53  items  with  nine  symptom  scales  (Somati-
zation, Obsessive–Compulsive, Interpersonal Sensitivity, 
Depression, Anxiety, Hostility, Phobic Anxiety, Paranoid 
Ideation, and Psychoticism). It provides the Global Sever-
ity Index (GSI) that assesses overall psychological distress 
level,  the  Positive  Symptom  Total  (PST)  which  covers 
the  number  of  self-reported  symptoms,  and  the  Posi-
tive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI) which evaluates the 
intensity  of  symptoms.  The  psychometric  properties  of 
the BSI were shown to be good [54].

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS Sta-
tistics 28 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Sig-
nificance threshold was set to p ≤ 0.05.

Sociodemographic  features,  psychiatric  diagnosis,  and 
overall level of PO were described based on measures of 
frequency  distribution.  Differences  between  groups  in 
sociographic  characteristics,  psychiatric  diagnosis  and 
symptom severity were investigated using t-test, Mann–
Whitney  tests  and,  where  appropriate,  the  χ2  test  (for 
ordinal  variables).  To  counteract  the  multiple  compari-
son problem a Bonferroni correction was applied. To test 
the main hypothesis a logistic regression was conducted 
to analyze the relationship between personality organiza-
tion (seven domains of the STIPO), personality function-
ing (LPFS) and diagnosis.

Results
Demographics and psychiatric diagnostics

34 patients diagnosed with a BPD, 28 patients diagnosed 
with a BD, and 27 HC agreed to participate in the study. 
The age ranged from 18 to 39 years  (Mage = . 27.15 years, 
SD = 6.42)  in  the  BPD  sample,  from  24  to  68  years 
 (Mage = 42.0 years, SD = 14.56) in the BD sample and from 
20 to 60 years  (Mage = 30.71 years, SD = 11.68) in the HC 
sample.  In  all  groups,  participants  were  predominantly 
female  (for  details  refer  to  Table  1).  Sociodemographic 
characteristics  showed  significant  differences  in  age 
with  participants  in  the  BD  sample  being  significantly 
older  than  participants  in  the  BPD  sample  (t = −5.35, 
p < 0.001)  and  HC  sample  (t = 3.16,  p = 0.001).  Partici-
pants in the BD sample were more likely to have received 
psychiatric  (χ2(1) = 5.471,  p = 0.019)  or  psychopharma-
cological  treatment  (χ2(1) = 6.498,  p = 0.011).  Patients  in 
the BPD sample were more frequently diagnosed with a 
depressive  disorder  (U = 287.0,  p = 0.002)  and  an  eating 
disorder  (U = 384.0,  p = 0.049).  Diagnoses  according  to 
DSM-IV  (55)  are  given  in  Table  2.  No  differences  were 
found  between  groups  in  terms  of  partnership,  educa-
tion, and employment.

Group differences in symptom severity, overall personality 
organization and personality traits

Overall,  patients  in  the  BPD  sample  reported  a  higher 
number of symptoms and higher level of distress accord-
ing  to  the  BSI  (t = 4.2,  p < 0.001,  d = 1.151).  With  the 
exception  of  “Somatization”,  “Hostility”,  and  “Phobic 
anxiety”  all  symptom  dimension  scores  on  the  BSI  were 
significantly  higher  in  the  BPD  patient  sample  than  in 
the  BD  sample;  with  effect  sizes  ranging  from  medium 
to  large.  Differences  were  even  greater  when  comparing 
the BPD with the BD- sample (see Table 3). For the five 
domain  scales  of  the  PID-5-BF  we  again  found  gener-
ally  higher  scores  in  the  BPD  patients  with  significantly 
increased  scores  on  the  domain  “Negative  affectivity” 
(t = 4.476, p < 0.001, d = 1.187; Table 3).

The  overall  PO  of  the  BPD,  the  BD,  the  BD-  and  the 
HC group is given in Table 4. In the HC group, nobody 
was  rated  on  a  borderline  level.  The  difference  between 
groups  in  the  overall  level  of  PO  did  reach  significance 
(χ2(2) = 29.196,  p < 0.001).  HC  had  significantly 
less 
impairment of personality structure, reflected in a higher 
level  of  PO,  compared  to  BPD  as  well  as  to  BD  patients 
(HC  vs.  BD:  U = 2.0,  p < 0.001,  HC  vs.  BPD:  U = 0.0, 
p < 0.001).  However,  no  significant  difference  was  found 
between BPD and BD patients.

Specific contribution of domains of personality functioning 
and organization in predicting psychiatric diagnosis

In  Table  5  descriptive  statistics  of  the  domains  of  the 
STIPO  and  the  LPFS  are  given.  Higher  scores  in  the 
STIPO  reflect  greater  deficiencies.  Across  the  seven 
dimensions  of  the  STIPO,  patients  in  the  BPD  sample 
had higher scores than patients in the BD sample. Table 6 
shows  results  from  a  logistic  regression  analysis  with 
dimension of the STIPO (Identity, Object relations, Prim-
itive  defenses,  Coping,  Self-directed  aggression,  Other-
directed  aggression,  Moral  values,  and  Reality  testing) 
and  the  LPFS  (Self-direction,  Interpersonal-functioning, 
Empathy,  and  Intimacy)  predicting  group  membership. 
Odds ratios for four predictors were significant, suggest-
ing  that  lower  scores  on  identity  (OR = 0.036,p = 0.023), 
self-directed  aggression  (OR = 0.273,  p = 0.008),  other-
directed  aggression  (OR = 0.211,  p = 0.042)  and  higher 
scores  on  moral  values  (OR = 10.97,  p = 0.008)  were 
associated  with  the  diagnosis  of  a  BD.  Taken  together, 
the  model  showed  considerable  predictive  value,  with 
Nagelkerke´s  R2 = 0.633 
(12) = 34.151, 
p < 0.001)  and  85%  of  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  BD 
being correctly predicted.

Group differences in personality functioning 
and organization between BPD and BD‑

Comparison  of  the  BPD  with  the  BD-  sample  revealed 
even  greater  differences  in  personality  functioning.  BD- 
patients  were  shown  to  have  a  significantly  higher  over-
all level of PO than BPD patients (U = 160.00, p = 0.002), 
with  72,3%  of  the  BD-  sample  vs.  32,4%  of  BDP  sample 
assigned  a  level  of  “Borderline  1”  or  higher.  Further-
more,  significant  differences  were  found  in  several  sub-
dimensions  of  the  STIPO  with  the  BPD  sample  being 
more  impaired  on  the  dimensions  “Identity”,  “Primitive 
Defenses”, “Self-directed aggression”, and “Other-directed 
aggression”. Statistical analysis revealed medium to large 
effect  sizes.  Significant  differences  were  also  found  in 
the domains of the LPFS with patients of the BPD sam-
ple showing higher impairment in the domains “Identity” 
and “Intimacy” with medium effect sizes.

Discussion
This  study  examined  personality  functioning  in  BD  and 
BPD  patients  to  contribute  to  a  better  differential  diag-
nosis  of  the  two  disorders.  First,  we  looked  at  the  total 
sample  of  BPD  and  BD  patients  and  the  results  confirm 
our main hypothesis. We found that BPD patients show 
more severe impairment in personality functioning with 
significant  differences  in  the  dimensions  of  “Identity”, 
“Self-directed  aggression”,  “Other-directed  aggression”, 
and “moral values”. The other domains and overall STIPO 
level  were  higher,  indicating  more  deficiency,  in  the 
BPD  sample  compared  to  the  BD  group,  but  differences 
did  not  reach  statistical  significance.  Identity  was  more 
impaired in patients with BPD, referring to the syndrome 
of  identity  diffusion,  which  is  considered  to  be  pathog-
nomonic  for  patients  with  severe  personality  disorders. 
These results also confirm recent reports which pointed 
to  the  relevance  of  the  concept  of  integrated  identity 
versus  identity  diffusion  for  distinguishing  BPD  from 
BD patients [29, 33]. Self- and other-directed aggression 
was  found  to  be  more  severe  in  BPD.  While  aggression 
is  known  to  also  occur  in  acute  phases  of  BD  as  well  as 
after  remission  [55,  56],  severe  unintegrated,  i.e.  split-
off,  mainly  self-directed  aggression  as  a  core  personal-
ity characteristic is typical for severe BPD, presenting as 
chronic  suicidal  tendencies  and  parasuicidal  behavior, 
such as repeated cutting, especially under emotional con-
ditions such as frustrations and interpersonal challenges 
[4, 29]. Finally, in our sample, BD patients showed more 
impairment  of  moral  functioning,  i.e.  the  capacity  to 
adhere to common norms of interpersonal behavior and 
to experience guilt feelings when appropriate. This find-
ing might reflect the increased risk of norm-transgressing 
behavior of BD patients during manic episodes, but more 
detailed  follow-up  research  is  necessary  to  corroborate 
these results, especially given the rather poor interrater-
reliability in our sample for this STIPO domain.

More than a third of the BD patients (35,7%) presented 
with  a  comorbid  personality  disorder  (PD)  other  than 
BPD,  which  is  higher  than  previously  reported  [17].  In 
order  to  further  investigate  the  association  between  BD 
and personality functioning in the absence of any PD, we 
performed  a  secondary  analysis  comparing  BD  patients 
without any PD (BD-) with the BPD sample. In the sec-
ondary  analysis,  the  differences  between  the  groups 
became  even  clearer  with  significantly  higher  impair-
ment in several important domains of the STIPO in the 
BPD patients. Notably, the overall level of PO was signifi-
cantly  worse  in  the  BPD  group  with  68%  having  a  level 
of “borderline 2” or lower versus 27.8% of the BD- sam-
ple.  Again,  “Identity”  was  significantly  more  impaired 
and  “Self-  and  other-directed  aggression”  was  found 
to  be  more  severe  in  BPD  patients  [33].  Additionally, 

“Primitive  defenses”  were  significantly  more  dominantly 
used  in  BPD,  confirming  the  use  of  immature  defense 
mechanisms  such  as  splitting  and  projective  identifica-
tion  as  pathognomonic  characteristics  of  BPD  [34,  57]. 
Defense mechanisms are used to prevent anxiety and to 
maintain  psychological  stability,  but  immature  defense 
mechanisms skew an individual´s perception of reality, of 
the self and others [58]. On the other hand, more mature 
defense mechanisms in BD patients lead to greater affec-
tive  stability  and  the  capacity  for  mature  relationships 
with  others  [29]. This  was  further  confirmed  by  the  sig-
nificantly less impairment of BD patients in the domains 
“Identity”  and  “Intimacy”  in  the  LPFS.  These  results 
are  in  line  with  previous  reports  that  found  that  BPD 
patients  had  significantly  more  difficulties  in  interper-
sonal  relationships  as  compared  to  patients  with  BD  [1, 
59]),  namely  in  establishing  and  maintaining  reciprocal 
relationships,  as  well  as  coping  emotionally  with  inter-
personal  stress.  Somewhat  surprisingly,  we  found  no 
significant  differences  in  the  domain  “object  relations”, 
referring to relationships to significant others, comparing 
the  BPD  and  the  BD  patients.  However,  object  relations 
were  significantly  impaired  in  both  groups  compared  to 
the  HC  sample,  therefore  relationships  to  others  were 
equally  impaired  and  not  helpful  in  distinguishing  BPD 
from BD.

Regarding personality traits, our results show a strong 
association  of  negative  affectivity  and  BPD  compared 
to  BD.  This  finding  is  in  line  with  previous  reports  of 
high  levels  of  negative  affectivity  and  disinhibition  in 
BPD  patients  [60].  Notably,  a  recent  meta-analysis  also 
reported higher scores of neuroticism and lower scores of 
conscientiousness and extraversion in BD patients when 
compared to healthy controls [61].

The  clinical  implications  of  the  level  of  impairment  of 
personality  functioning  are  known  in  BPD  [62,  63],  less 
is  known  about  its  impact  in  BD  [64–67].  Our  study 
revealed that, on a symptomatic level, BPD patients were 
significantly  more  impaired  in  all  domains  of  the  BSI 
except for somatization compared with the BD total sam-
ple.  The  differences  were  even  greater  in  the  secondary 
analysis,  when  comparing  the  subgroup  of  BD  patients 
without any comorbid PD with the BPD sample. Impair-
ment in personality functioning was thus associated with 
higher severity of symptoms, indicating that the level of 
PO has a major impact on symptom load in BPD and BD.
According to modern psychodynamic object relations 
theory,  severe  personality  disorders  including  BPD  are 
characterized by a PO on a borderline level as opposed 
to neurotic or psychotic PO [34, 68]. This was confirmed 
in  our  sample  with  100%  of  the  BPD  patients  showing 
a  PO  on  a  borderline  level.  Mood  disorders  are  known 
to  occur  on  different  severity  grades,  from  psychotic

to  less  symptomatic  manifestations.  Especially  acute 
manic episodes oftentimes present symptomatically psy-
chotic with denial leading to a loss of reality testing that 
is  regained  in  the  euthymic  phase  [69].  Patients  remit-
ted  from  acute  phases  of  illness  therefore  are  thought 
to  present  with  a  wider  range  of  personality  pathology 
[70,  71].  Patients  in  our  BD  sample  presented  with  a 
PO  ranging  from  neurotic  2  to  borderline  3  supporting 
this  hypothesis.  Only  two  of  the  BD  patients  showed 
the  most  severe  impairment  in  personality  functioning 
which is theoretically on the border to a psychotic per-
sonality  structure. Therefore,  we  could  not  find  empiri-
cal  evidence  in  our  sample  of  euthymic patients for BD 
to  be  generally  associated  with  a  psychotic  PO.  This 
implies that after the manic episode when reality testing 
might be skewed, reality testing is fully reestablished in 
remission. Nevertheless, 90% of patients in the BD group 
showed  impairment  in  personality  functioning  corre-
sponding to a PO on a borderline level. A high number 
of BD patients thus presents with severe problems in the 
areas  of  identity  integration,  intimacy  and  aggression 
based on primitive defense mechanisms. These patients 
might  also  –  besides  mood  stabilizing  psychopharma-
cological  treatment—benefit  from  specialized  psycho-
therapeutic interventions targeting pathological self and 
interpersonal  functioning  as  established  for  personality 
disorders such as BPD [21, 72].

Limitations

The  BPD  patients  were  significantly  younger  in  age.  Lit-
erature  regarding  the  course  of  BPD  across  the  lifetime 
report  a  decline  of  impulsive  symptoms  and  aggres-
sion in BPD patients over the lifespan and therefore less 
presentation in the clinical setting [73, 74]. Furthermore, 
there  is  evidence  that  there  are  characteristic  patterns 
of change in personality traits over the life span, notably 
including  an  increase  in  emotional  stability  [75].  There-
fore, an age-related bias of the differences in personality 
functioning cannot be ruled out.

Another  limitation  is  that  the  same  rater  performed 
STIPO  and  SCID  assessment,  due  to  practical  reasons. 
To  minimize  skewed  ratings,  the  STIPO  interview  was 
first administered, followed by the SCID interview.

Furthermore,  the  LPFS  ratings  were  based  on  STIPO 
interviews and not on an independent assessment inter-
view, which had not yet been available at the time of the 
realization  of  this  study  [76].  While  this  approach  has 
been  demonstrated  to  be  reliable  [76],  the  results  of  the 
LPFS  in  this  study  need  to  be  interpreted  with  caution 
and  should  not  be  seen  as  an  independent  validation  of 
the STIPO results. The LPFS score in this study was used 
primarily as a measure to build a conceptual bridge from 

STIPO  results  based  on  object  relations  theory  to  the 
diagnostic standards of the AMPD in the DSM-5.

The  interrater  agreement  on  the  domain  moral  val-
ues  in  the  STIPO  was  only  fair,  compared  to  all  other 
domains  that  reached  good  interrater  reliability.  Our 
results  on  the  significant  differences  between  BD  and 
BPD  patients  concerning  moral  issues  therefore  have  to 
be interpreted with caution.

Further  limitations  of  the  current  study  include  its 
cross-sectional  design  and  its  rather  small  sample  size 
due to the time-consuming assessment procedures. Lon-
gitudinal studies are needed to investigate the impact of 
personality  pathology  on  the  course  of  treatment  and 
outcome in BD patients.

Conclusion
Differential  diagnosis  of  BD  and  BPD  can  be  clinically 
challenging. Assessing personality functioning is a prom-
ising  perspective  to  supplement  categorical,  symptom-
oriented  approaches.  Our  data  show  that  in  BPD  severe 
deficits in overall PO and identity integration are pathog-
nomonic  whereas  BD  patients  present  with  varying  lev-
els  of  PO.  The  level  of  PO  has  a  significant  impact  on 
symptom  severity  in  both  BD  and  BPD  patients.  Care-
ful  assessment  of  personality  functioning  should  there-
fore be considered in BD for differential diagnostics and 
adequate  treatment  planning.  For  those  BD  patients 
that  have  impairments  in  PO,  specific  psychotherapeu-
tic treatment should be considered targeting personality 
pathology in addition to treatment as usual.
