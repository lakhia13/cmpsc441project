Abstract

Purpose of Review: Informal cancer caregivers play a vital role in the physical, functional, and 
emotional well-being of cancer patients. However, the majority of informal caregivers are not 
prepared for their caregiving role. We reviewed and synthesized the recent FCG literature (last 18 
months), and focused on research in the following understudied areas: 1) technology-driven 
interventions for informal caregivers; 2) informal caregivers of older adults with cancer; 3) 
interrelationship between informal caregiver and dyadic outcomes; and 4) research priorities and 
guidelines to improve informal caregiver support.

Recent Findings: Studies focused on technology-driven informal caregiver interventions, with 
evidence of good feasibility and acceptability with benefits for burden and QOL. Studies also 
focused on QOL for caregivers of older adults with cancer. Finally, research priorities and clinical 
guidelines were established through Delphi survey studies.

Summary: Despite the substantial evidence on informal cancer caregiving, more research is 
needed to further characterize caregivers at high-risk for burden, explicate interrelationships 
between caregiver/patient outcomes, and test innovative and scalable interventions. Studies are 
also needed to understand the specific needs of informal caregivers in cancer surgery, an 
understudied treatment population.

Introduction

Informal caregivers are members of an “invisible” workforce that provides support and 
direct care to cancer patients. They are individuals (adult children, spouses, parents, friends, 
or neighbors) who provide typically uncompensated home care that is physically, 
emotionally, socially, and financially demanding. The caregiving role also involves 
significant amounts of time and energy (1, 2). Due to changes in the healthcare system and 
an increasingly older population, the burden of cancer caregiving is increasingly shifting to

informal caregivers. Current evidence suggests that cancer caregiving is intense, episodic, 
and has a profound impact on the caregiver’s well-being and quality of life (QOL) (3, 4). 
Despite the burden, most informal cancer caregivers are ill-prepared for their caregiving 
role.

A growing number of interventions have been developed to address the unmet needs of 
informal cancer caregivers. Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews were published to 
understand the efficacy of interventions that target informal cancer caregivers. These include 
the 2010 meta-analysis by Northouse et al. (5), Ferrell and Wittenberg’s updated review in 
2017 (6), and a recent review by Frambes et al. (7). Collectively, these studies suggest that 
interventions reduced caregiver burden, increased self-efficacy, and improved aspects of 
caregiver QOL. A recent review of cancer dyadic interventions found improvements with 
multiple psychosocial domains of patient’s QOL (8). This paper provides a review of the 
current science of informal cancer caregiving, with implications for clinical care and 
recommendations on research priorities.

Methods

We conducted a literature search using PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Scopus 
electronic databases, and restricted our search to English language articles published in the 
last 18 months. Search key words included family caregivers, quality of life, caregiver 
burden, interventions, distress, and neoplasm. We used the research recommendations from a 
2015 National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
co-sponsored meeting on research and clinical priorities for informal cancer caregiving to 
guide our selection of studies published in the last 18 months.(1) We selected four areas of 
research/clinical innovations, which are presented in the following sections.

Technology-Driven Interventions for Informal Caregivers

The past 50 years have seen an explosion in medical innovations, with ever more exciting 
clinical capabilities on the horizon. Technological advances, such as digital healthcare 
engagement, electronic patient-reported outcomes, and wearable devices provide innovative 
platforms for the delivery of scalable patient- and family-centered interventions. Two recent 
studies explored the feasibility and role of digital engagement in support of informal cancer 
caregivers. Information technology platforms, such as smartphone applications, are viewed 
as being potentially useful by caregivers for bridging information gaps in a timely manner 
(9). Informal caregivers reported high usability ratings for ease of completion and support 
information from an electronic caregiver-reported outcome collection system (10).

Two recent reviews summarized the current state of the science on technology-based 
interventions for informal cancer caregivers. In a systematic review, Heynsbergh et al. (11) 
assessed the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of technology-based interventions among 
informal cancer caregivers. Six randomized trials of web/telephone-based interventions and 
published between 2007 to 2017 were included. From a feasibility perspective, recruitment 
rates varied between 20% and 66%; attrition rates ranged from 14% to 77% (11). Several 
strategies were reported to enhance uptake and adherence to the interventions, such as

providing internet access, provision of written instructions, and designated support staff to 
assist with technological difficulties (11). Finally, acceptability was generally high. 
Technology-driven approaches provided informal caregivers with the flexibility of 
completing interventions at home and at their own time preference, ability to personalize the 
content received based on need, and were helpful in improving knowledge and 
communication (11). Intervention content focusing on patient symptom management and 
coping were viewed as beneficial by caregivers.

Shin and colleagues conducted a recent review of technology-driven caregiver interventions 
and outcomes (12). Overall, interventions were focused on information facilitation, caregiver 
social support, and multicomponent caregiver support. The interventions utilized a wide 
range of formats, including smartphone applications, websites, multimedia, electronic health 
record patient portals, online peer support network, visual mobile system, and online 
symptom reporting system. The technology-mediated interventions were designed to target 
information delivery, communication with providers, peer connections, psychoeducational 
support, and caregiver burden (12). Collectively, the evidence suggests that informal cancer 
caregiver outcomes, including knowledge, self-efficacy, caregiving satisfaction, burden, 
emotional well-being, and QOL can improve through technology-mediated interventions 
(12).

Informal Caregivers of Older Adults with Cancer

More than half of informal caregivers (62%) provide care to cancer patients age 65 and older 
(4). Older adults with cancer are at higher risk for developing comorbidities and declines in 
physiological reserves during and after treatments; this can result in greater needs for 
functional assistance. Informal caregivers for older adults, therefore, are at greater risk for 
caregiving burden.

Three recent studies described the caregiving experiences for older adults with cancer. In a 
qualitative study, informal caregivers reported concerns related to lack of control over their 
care recipient’s cancer. However, distress with loss of control is attenuated by the realization 
of the ability to control the reaction to the patient’s illness (13). In a study with caregivers of 
hospitalized older adults with cancer, 89% of patients required assistance with instrumental 
activities of daily living (IADLs) (14). Caregivers provided care an average of 35 hours per 
week. Although informal caregivers were often older, they reported no major comorbidities 
and good overall QOL. However, 22% reported worsening physical health secondary to their 
caregiving role. Poorer caregiver mental health, less social support, and having a care 
recipient with poor performance status were associated with lower caregiver QOL (14).

In a study with spousal caregivers of older adults with cancer, frequencies of caregiver 
clinical depression and psychological distress were 16.5% and 28% (15). Lower levels of 
perceived social support were associated with higher levels of caregiver clinical depression. 
Spousal perceived support from their care recipients may play an important role in caregiver 
emotional well-being (15).

Interrelationship between Informal Caregiver and Dyadic Outcomes

Research and theories have demonstrated the potential interrelationship between patient and 
informal caregiver outcomes (16). Caregiver well-being may be associated with patient 
clinical outcomes, such as perceived quality of care (16, 17). Several recent papers described 
the interrelationship between patient and informal caregiver outcomes. In a study with 43 
lung cancer patient and caregiver dyads, patient’s symptoms were positively correlated with 
caregiver burden, depression/anxiety, and QOL (18). Patient’s depression/anxiety were also 
correlated with the caregiver’s emotional well-being. A longitudinal analysis of the national 
Health and Retirement Study (HRS) found that older caregivers whose care recipients were 
unwell (more hospitalization, higher numbers of bed days) reported poorer outcomes (19).

A substantial number of informal cancer caregivers set aside their own needs to care for a 
family member or friend. A recent study analyzed data from the Cancer Care Outcomes 
Research & Surveillance Consortium (CanCORS) to assess correlations among health 
behaviors and coping strategies in lung cancer colorectal cancer caregivers (N=1,482) (17). 
More than one-fifth of caregivers (23%) reported lack of adherence to national physical 
activity guidelines (moderate level). Most caregivers (81%) participated in non-exercise 
daily activities, and about a quarter (23%) were not sleeping enough to feel rested (17). The 
most common caregiver coping style was emotion-coping strategies, which included 
spirituality/religion (49%), acceptance (36%), positive framing (21%), and emotional 
support (20%). Caregivers with insomnia reported higher use of problem-focused coping 
strategies (help from others, planning, strategizing). Dysfunctional coping was associated 
with more binge-drinking and smoking (17).

Research Priorities and Guidelines to Improve Informal Caregiver Support

Several consensus/guideline studies on improving informal cancer caregiving support and 
research were published in the last 18 months. A recent international Delphi study aimed to 
identify priority topics for informal caregiver research in cancer care (20). Nine consensus 
research topics were identified by clinicians, administrators, researchers, and caregivers 
through three rounds of online Delphi surveys (Table 1). Despite the consensus, there were 
differences by stakeholder panels on topics within the vulnerable caregiver subgroups and 
technology area (20). Caregiver panel members were less likely to endorse older caregivers 
as a vulnerable subgroup, as well as use of technology to administer caregiver interventions. 
The results from this international Delphi study identified research priorities that are similar 
to topics identified in 2015 by the U.S. National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR). The 
NINR stakeholder consensus on research and clinical priorities for informal cancer 
caregiving were divided into four overarching areas: 1) improving the assessment of the 
prevalence and burden of caregiving; 2) improving interventions targeted at cancer patients, 
caregivers, and patient-caregiver dyads; 3) facilitating further integration of caregivers into 
formal healthcare settings; and 4) maximizing the positive impact of technology on 
caregiving (1).

Two recent guidelines from Australia aimed to develop and evaluate comprehensive 
guidelines for oncology clinicians on family involvement in cancer care (21, 22). Table 2

presents an overview of key guideline recommendations. The TRIO Guidelines are based on 
extensive literature review and input from a panel of expert advisors. The guidelines 
underwent two rounds of evaluation via online Delphi consensus procedures, and were 
presented to clinicians through training workshops. In TRIO Guideline-1, six consensus 
topics were included for quality family involvement. Within each of the six topics, strategies 
and sub-strategies are available to provide more detailed guidance on how to enact the 
strategies (22). In addition, wording and behaviors provide concrete examples that can be 
used in clinical settings with caregivers. In TRIO Guideline-2, seven consensus topics were 
included to manage challenging situations with caregivers in cancer care (21).

Conclusion

Overwhelming evidence established over the last 20 years confirms that the cancer 
caregiving role is a major source of stress and burden for informal caregivers, and has a 
negative impact on caregiver health and QOL. Despite the significant QOL issues, few 
evidence-based interventions are available to support the challenges and demands of cancer 
caregiving. Future research should continue to focus on testing innovative and scalable 
interventions to reduce caregiver burden across the cancer trajectory. The interventions 
should integrate upfront comprehensive assessments, and use the information to provide 
personalized support based on a caregiver’s needs, preferences, and the care recipient’s 
physical and emotional condition. The increasingly older population worldwide underscores 
the imperative to support the needs of informal caregivers of older adults with cancer. The 
integration of comprehensive geriatric assessment in older informal caregivers may provide 
an opportunity to identify those at high-risk for caregiving burden, and deploy precious 
resources to caregivers most in need of support. Finally, more research is needed in 
understudied caregiver populations, such as surgical populations. There is a lack of patient- 
and family-centered models of care in cancer surgery, and few interventions are designed 
specifically to target the needs of caregivers before and after surgery.

TRIO Guidelines for Clinicians on Family Involvement in Cancer Care (21, 22)

Table 2.

Facilitating Family/Caregiver Involvement:

1. Consider caregivers in inpatient and outpatient procedures and setup

  ▪ Foster respect, acknowledge importance of caregivers, documenting and identifying caregivers, sufficient space and seating for caregivers 
in consultation and waiting areas

2. Welcoming caregiver attendance

  ▪ Awareness of barriers to family participation, offer alternative solutions for inclusion, respect varying wishes for family participation, 
encourage family participation during important consultations

3. Build rapport and respect for caregivers

  ▪ Ask for information about caregivers, listen and respond to caregiver questions/needs, acknowledge the impact of the illness on caregivers, 
affirm the important role of the family

4. Caregiver communication

  ▪ Ascertain and adhere to patient preferences for sharing information with the family

5. Being observant of patient and caregiver relationship

  ▪ Ascertain caregiver’s preferred level of involvement in consultation and decision-making

Managing Challenging Situations with Family/Caregiver:

1. Interacting with large numbers of family/caregivers during consultations

  ▪ Seek to accommodate, offer to hold separate family meeting

2. Addressing family requests for nondisclosure of information to patient

  ▪ Show empathy, understand and address the reasons for nondisclosure, encourage continued clinician-family partnership, explore and 
respect the patient’s own preferences to know (or not know)

3. Addressing family/caregivers acting as interpreters

  ▪ Offer professional interpretation services, when using interpreters, ensure continued engagement with patient

4. Addressing conflicting patient-family treatment preferences

  ▪ Explore patient/family understanding of the situation and concerns, express empathy and explore emotions behind the differing views, 
assess shared values and common grounds

5. Addressing dominant, controlling, or coercive family/caregiver

6. Addressing angry family/caregiver

  ▪ Understand reasons for anger, interact with respect and empathy, offer relevant and practical support

7. Addressing dysfunction, conflict, abuse
