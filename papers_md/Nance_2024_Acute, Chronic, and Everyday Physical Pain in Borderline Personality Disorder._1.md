Abstract
Purpose of Review  Physical pain is an underrecognized area of dysregulation among those with borderline personality dis-
order (BPD). Disturbances are observed within the experience of acute, chronic, and everyday physical pain experiences for 
people with BPD. We aimed to synthesize research findings on multiple areas of dysregulation in BPD in order to highlight 
potential mechanisms underlying the association between BPD and physical pain dysregulation.
Recent Findings  Potential biological mechanisms include altered neural responses to painful stimuli within cognitive-
affective regions of the brain, as well as potentially low basal levels of endogenous opioids. Emotion dysregulation broadly 
mediates dysregulation of physical pain. Certain psychological experiences may attenuate acute physical pain, such as 
dissociation, whereas others, such as negative affect, may exacerbate it. Social challenges between patients with BPD and 
healthcare providers may hinder appropriate treatment of chronic pain.
Summary  Dysregulated physical pain is common in BPD and important in shaping health outcomes including elevated BPD 
symptoms, chronic pain conditions, and risk for problematic substance use.

Introduction

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by 
an enduring pattern of disturbances in affect, impulsivity, 
self-image, and interpersonal relationships [1]. Another, less 
recognized, area in which people with BPD commonly expe-
rience disturbances is physical health, especially the experi-
ence of physical pain [2–8]. As the body signals to the brain 
that something is awry, physical pain is both a ubiquitous 
experience and important for maintaining adaptive function-
ing. Dysregulation in the experience of pain, either in the 
direction of too little pain or too much, can have significant 
consequences. BPD has been associated with greater chronic

and everyday pain and, in contrast, reduced sensitivity to 
acute pain. This apparent contradiction has been termed the 
“pain paradox” of BPD [9–11].

In the current paper, we first define chronic, everyday, 
and acute pain and review the evidence for their relationship 
to BPD. Following this, we examine evidence for processes 
potentially related to pain dysregulation in BPD. In this review, 
we adopt a biopsychosocial framework (Fig. 1), which has 
been applied to both the experience of physical pain [12, 13] 
and BPD [14, 15] and may be particularly useful in highlight-
ing mechanisms involved in their association. The biopsycho-
social model of chronic pain conceptualizes the experience of 
pain as being shaped by biological (e.g., neural), psychologi-
cal (e.g., affect), and social (e.g., relationships) mechanisms 
which interact with one another to influence pain experiences 
[12, 13]. Likewise, Linehan’s biosocial theory of BPD identi-
fies interactions between biological, psychological, and social 
components [14]. We review evidence for the association of 
pain and BPD within each of these three interrelated domains.
Before proceeding, it is important to note that this review 
was initially conceptualized as a review of recent work on 
physical pain in personality disorders broadly. We conducted 
a comprehensive literature search of original studies listed

as functional warnings about injuries [16]. Chronic pain is 
prevalent in BPD samples and, in turn, BPD features are 
common in chronic pain samples. For instance, Heath et al. 
[17] found that 65% of patients entering outpatient treatment 
for BPD (N = 65) met DSM-IV criteria for pain disorder, 
a disorder characterized by pain that causes clinically sig-
nificant distress or impairment where psychological factors 
are judged to have an important role in the onset, severity, 
exacerbation, or maintenance of the pain [18]. Likewise, a 
prior review suggests that approximately 30% of people with 
a chronic pain disorder meet criteria for BPD or report sig-
nificant BPD traits [9] - a significant health disparity given 
the rate of BPD among the general population of the United 
States (US) is around 2% [19, 20]. Physical pain, particularly 
chronic pain, can lead to a reduction in participation in daily 
activities, which we will refer to as pain-related disability.

Aside from chronic pain, virtually everyone experiences 
everyday pains that are context-specific, relatively short-
lived, and can be generally self-managed (e.g., with over-
the-counter pain medication). As many as 80–89% of those 
with BPD report experiencing some level of physical pain 
within the past day [17, 21]. Within a non-clinical sample 
(N = 206), BPD features were cross-sectionally associated 
with greater past-year nonchronic pain [11]. Furthermore, 
in an ambulatory assessment study, Carpenter et al. [22••] 
observed that BPD outpatients (n = 26) reported greater eve-
ryday pain intensity and variability than community partici-
pants (n = 26). These findings suggest that people with BPD 
are prone to experiencing pain in their daily lives, includ-
ing pain that does not rise to the definition of chronic pain. 
These everyday pains are worthy of attention. Similar to 
mood dysregulation, daily experience of pain dysregulation 
can potentially lead to significant impacts on functioning 
[23]. It may also contribute to why people with BPD appear 
to be over-represented in samples of people seeking pain 
treatment [9] and may lead them to self-manage their pain 
in maladaptive ways (e.g., substance use [24]).

Perception of acute pain in BPD has received consider-
able attention because people with BPD frequently engage 
in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI; i.e., tissue damage without 
the intent to die), an inherently painful behavior. Experi-
mental work has found that people with BPD and a history 
of NSSI report reduced acute pain in response to painful 
stimuli. For example, Fales and colleagues [25••] recently 
reviewed laboratory pain induction studies that examined 
acute pain perception of individuals with BPD. Overall, 
those with BPD showed a higher pain threshold (the amount 
of time elapsed until pain onset after a stimulus is applied) 
and lower pain intensity (how painful a stimulus is per-
ceived) relative to comparison participants. In contrast to 
this experimental work, however, a recent large (N = 1630) 
retrospective study of people with a history of NSSI (almost 
all of whom reported significant BPD features) found that

sistic,” “avoidant,” “dependent,” “obsessive–compulsive,”

studies with samples that represented a personality disorder 
population. We considered studies that assessed categorical 
personality disorders and studies that assessed dimensional 
personality disorder traits within the past 5 years (January 
1st, 2018–February 9th, 2023). The initial search yielded 
582 results, from which 198 duplicate results were removed 
and 339 studies were removed for not assessing physical 
pain and personality disorders/traits. In total, N = 45 studies 
were identified that matched our criteria. Of the 45 articles 
identified, only 5 studies examined antisocial personality 
disorder/psychopathic traits, 1 study examined trait narcis-
sism, and 2 studies examined dimensional personality traits. 
Articles focused on antisocial personality tended to examine 
empathy for other’s pain rather than one’s own experience 
of painful stimuli. We therefore focus this narrative review 
on pain in BPD. We return to this point, and the need for 
additional attention to the experience of pain in personality 
disorders broadly, in the conclusion.

Chronic, Everyday, and Acute Pain

Chronic pain involves experiencing pain over time (typi-
cally ≥ 3 months) and is recognized as pain that exceeds 
normal healing time and lacks nociceptive benefits, such 

242

most people who self-harm report mild-to-moderate pain 
during NSSI, and BPD features were not associated with 
amount of pain reported [26]. Thus, there appears to be a 
discrepancy between what people report in the laboratory 
in response to standardized stimuli and what they experi-
ence in their daily lives. It may be that people with BPD do 
have generally greater acute pain tolerance, but also that pain 
plays an important role in experiencing benefits from NSSI 
(e.g., reduction of negative affect). These benefits may lead 
them to self-harm in a manner that increases their experi-
ence of pain [26, 27]. A significant challenge, however, of 
understanding the relationship of BPD and acute pain expe-
rience is distinguishing possible effects of BPD from those 
of having a history of NSSI, given the considerable overlap 
of BPD and NSSI history.

Biological Processes

Pain arises when nociceptive nerves are stimulated in the 
body; the resulting signal is transmitted up the spinal cord 
to the brain, and the signal is then interpreted in the brain. 
At times, the central nervous system can incorrectly inter-
pret stimuli as painful due to an increased responsiveness of 
nociceptors to sub-threshold input, a phenomenon known as 
central sensitization. Central sensitization may be a relevant 
process for understanding the tendency for people with BPD 
to report more chronic and everyday pain. In a sample of 
chronic pain patients (N = 181), those with BPD were more 
likely to meet criteria for fibromyalgia, which is the pro-
totypical central sensitization disorder [28•]. Furthermore, 
those with a chronic pain disorder and greater BPD features 
experienced greater poly-somatic complaints associated with 
central sensitization than those with chronic pain disorder 
but without elevated BPD features [28•]. These findings 
indicate that chronic pain experiences for people with BPD 
could be, in part, related to the perception or appraisal of 
sensory inputs as painful that other individuals would not 
perceive as such.

Atypical perception of innocuous stimuli in BPD has 
been  demonstrated  through  recent  laboratory  work.  For 
instance, people with BPD (n = 25) exposed to pleasant 
touch stimuli (e.g., a brush stroke on the hand) rated it as 
less pleasant than control participants (n = 25) [29•], which 
could be related to negative evaluation tendencies seen in 
BPD. Individuals with BPD have also shown differences in 
threshold and perceived intensity for innocuous stimuli that 
align with prior research on painful stimuli. Recent work 
found that those with BPD report lower intensity of pleas-
ant touch [29•] as well as higher thresholds to detect warm 
thermal stimulation (n = 22 patients with BPD compared 
to n = 33 control participants) [30•]. These results suggest 
those with BPD may have hyposensitivity not only to painful 

laboratory stimuli, but also to innocuous stimuli. This, how-
ever, is the opposite of what would be expected if BPD was 
associated with central sensitization. It is worth noting that 
these findings deviate from previous research that did not 
find differences in the ability to detect non-painful stimuli 
for those with BPD [31, 32], indicating a need for continued 
research on the perception of non-painful stimuli in BPD 
and factors, such as body mass [32], that may contribute to 
hyposensitivity. It is also possible that the effect of BPD on 
perception of innocuous stimuli is only large enough to be 
detected when individuals with current BPD are compared 
to individuals with no prior psychopathology, given that the 
two studies that did not find differences for individuals with 
BPD (n = 27 and n = 29) included individuals who had a his-
tory of major depressive disorder with no current psychopa-
thology (n = 20), and healthy controls (n = 44), or individuals 
with remitted BPD (n = 19) and healthy controls (n = 22).

Multiple  brain  areas  are  involved  in  pain  processing, 
including affective, cognitive, and somatosensory areas, 
reflecting the complex integration of sensory and emotional 
experiences that culminate in the perception of pain. When 
unpleasant, but non-painful, electric stimulation was used 
in a recent fMRI study, no group differences were observed 
between control participants (n = 15) and women with BPD 
(n = 15) in the right primary somatosensory cortex, right 
secondary somatosensory cortex, posterior insula, right pos-
terior midcingulate cortex, and right supplementary motor 
area [33]. A separate fMRI study found that individuals with 
a history of NSSI (N = 81, ~ 1/3 of whom reported having 
BPD) showed greater neural activation in the primary and 
secondary somatosensory cortex during thermal stimulation 
than control participants, which may be explained by the 
fact that their fMRI protocol used individually calibrated 
heat pain and the NSSI group required higher temperatures 
to detect pain [34]. These studies suggest that individuals 
with BPD respond to pain and innocuous stimuli within 
somatosensory areas in ways similar to those without BPD; 
however, cognitive and affective neural processing of painful 
stimuli may explain differences in the experience of pain. 
For instance, a recent review of 13 fMRI studies investigat-
ing BPD and self-injurious and suicidal behaviors suggests 
that people with BPD and a history of self-harm and/or sui-
cide attempts show altered brain activity in regions involved 
in cognitive processes and affect regulation. Specifically, 
their review found evidence for altered neural patterns for 
individuals with BPD in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, dor-
sal anterior cingulate cortex, and medial and dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex, as well as in the nucleus accumbens and 
amygdala in response to pain stimulation [35].

Reduced sensitivity to acute pain could increase risk for 
engaging in NSSI by removing a natural physiological bar-
rier to self-harm [36]. At the same time, the experience of 
physical pain may actually be important for experiencing

243

desired effects of NSSI, such as emotional relief. This may 
occur either via pain itself (pain onset) or the reduction of 
pain following self-harm (pain offset) [26, 37]. Olié et al. 
[38] recently found heightened activation in the nucleus 
accumbens in people with BPD (n = 20) compared to con-
trols (n = 23) following thermal stimulation, potentially indi-
cating a rewarding effect of pain experience. These fMRI 
findings suggest that people with BPD might experience a 
pleasant sensation in response to heat that others perceive 
as painful, underscoring the affective processing involved in 
pain perception. A recent study which recruited individuals 
with BPD with and without history of NSSI, alongside con-
trol participants (n = 20 in each group), found that those with 
BPD and history of NSSI showed heightened responses in 
the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex in response to unexpected 
rewards, which may indicate a propensity to learning that 
NSSI can provide a rewarding effect [39].

Recent work has also investigated the role of the endog-
enous opioid system in how people with BPD experience 
pain. Endogenous opioids are produced in the brain and cir-
culate widely throughout the nervous system. Opioids are 
important for maintaining the body’s homeostasis generally 
and play a specific role in regulating the perception of pain 
by reducing acute pain [40]. That the release of endogenous 
opioids reduces acute pain levels in humans generally is 
well-established. More recently, certain symptoms of BPD, 
such as dysphoria and risk-taking behaviors, have been sug-
gested as indicators of low baseline levels of endogenous 
opioids [41]. Supporting this idea, opioid antagonist treat-
ments have recently been shown to reduce BPD symptoms 
in a retrospective chart analysis of individuals with BPD 
(N = 161) who received inpatient treatment [42]. Opioid 
antagonists may acutely block the rewarding effects of prob-
lematic coping behaviors that would otherwise activate the 
endogenous opioid system (e.g., NSSI, substance use), while 
chronic administration may restore balance in the neuro-
transmission of endogenous opioids. However, evidence for 
the use of opioid antagonists to treat BPD is preliminary and 
more research is needed on the mechanisms behind improve-
ment in symptoms.

Stanley and colleagues [43] first proposed that people 
who engage in NSSI might have an endogenous opioid defi-
ciency. This was based on findings that those with a cluster 
B personality disorder and history of self-injurious behav-
ior (n = 14) had lower levels of cerebrospinal β-endorphin 
and met-enkephalin compared to a diagnostically matched 
group of individuals with no history of self-harm (n = 15) 
[43]. Specifically, they posited that genetic vulnerability and 
early life adversity could lead to chronically low levels of 
endogenous opioids, which individuals attempt to counter 
by engaging in self-injurious behaviors to stimulate release 
of endogenous opioids. A recent study found that adoles-
cents with a history of NSSI (n = 94) showed lower plasma 

β-endorphin levels, increased pain thresholds, and lower 
pain intensity compared to control participants (n = 35) [44]. 
Furthermore, in a recent ambulatory assessment study in 
individuals with DSM-5 NSSI disorder (N = 51, 63% meet-
ing criteria for BPD), Störkel et al. [45] observed that NSSI 
acutely increased salivary β-endorphin levels and found evi-
dence of a positive association between severity of the self-
inflicted injury and β-endorphin levels. While these studies 
focus on NSSI, the majority of participants met for BPD 
and it is possible biological mechanisms and hypothesized 
causes (stress and trauma exposure) are applicable to people 
with BPD irrespective of NSSI history, although more work 
is needed to understand whether this is the case.

Low levels of circulating endogenous opioids might also 
leave people with BPD at risk of experiencing chronic pain 
and more intense everyday pain. Considerable evidence has 
accumulated for endogenous opioid dysfunction in chronic 
pain, particularly low endogenous opioid CSF/plasma lev-
els in chronic pain patients [46, 47]. Among chronic pain 
patients (N = 28), endogenous opioid system dysfunction 
has been associated with elevated acute and chronic pain 
sensitivity, as well as pain-related disability [48]. Limited 
evidence suggests that individuals with BPD may have low 
baseline levels of endogenous opioids. Prossin et al. [49] 
used positron emission tomography to examine availability 
of β-endorphin receptors in women with BPD (n = 18) and 
matched comparison participants (n = 14). The authors found 
that BPD was associated with greater baseline β-endorphin 
receptor availability in the orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, 
nucleus accumbens, and amygdala, and further observed 
differences in receptor binding potential in response to sad-
ness in the pregenual anterior cingulate, left orbitofrontal 
cortex, left ventral pallidum, left amygdala, and left infe-
rior temporal cortex. Findings from this study have been 
interpreted as evidence of dysregulation in the endogenous 
opioid system for individuals with BPD, including low basal 
levels of endogenous opioids and compensatory responses in 
opioid receptors within reward processing regions. In addi-
tion to chronic pain outcomes, risk for problematic opioid 
use seen in BPD populations may be linked to endogenous 
opioid system dysfunction [50•].

Psychological Processes

Emotion dysregulation is a core component of BPD, concep-
tualized as including heightened and labile negative affect, 
emotion sensitivity, and maladaptive coping strategies [51]. 
Negative affect has been associated with pain experiences 
among those with BPD. For example, Carpenter et al. [22••] 
found,  in  their  ecological  momentary  assessment  study, 
that  everyday  physical  aches  and  pains  were  associated 
with negative affect for both BPD (n = 26) and community 

244

(n = 26) individuals, but that pain predicted future negative 
affect more strongly in the BPD group. Reynolds et al. [52] 
used path models in a cross-sectional chronic pain sample 
(N = 147) to examine whether trait affective lability, anxi-
ety, and depression accounted for associations between BPD 
features and multiple indices of pain over the past year (pain 
severity, pain-related affective interference, and pain-related 
activity interference). Pain severity measured pain on an 
11-point scale at its worst, least, and average over the past 
year, as well as current level of pain. Pain-related activity 
interference assessed pain’s interference with general activity, 
walking ability, and normal work whereas affective interfer-
ence assessed interference with mood, interpersonal relation-
ships, and life enjoyment. Although their study design did 
not allow for examining causal mediation, they found that 
affective lability and trait anxiety showed significant indirect 
effects accounting for the association between BPD features 
and all three indices of pain and pain interference. Addition-
ally, serial path models indicated that anxiety around pain 
experience accounted for additional variance in the model 
[52]. Similarly, Johnson et al. [28•] assessed negative affect 
and BPD symptoms cross-sectionally within a chronic pain 
sample (N = 181) and found that associations between BPD 
features and chronic pain symptoms were accounted for by 
level of anxiety and depression. Negative affect has also been 
shown to mediate the relationship between interpersonal 
stressors and health problems across multiple domains (i.e., 
headaches, stomachaches, and muscle pains) in daily life for 
individuals with BPD (n = 81) and depression (n = 50) [53]. 
Together, these findings indicate that emotion dysregulation 
may contribute to the high prevalence of chronic and every-
day pain observed among individuals with BPD. At the same 
time, the direction of this association remains unclear, as it is 
also possible that regularly experiencing pain worsens emo-
tion dysregulation over time.

Maladaptive coping strategies contribute to emotion dys-
regulation within BPD and may also contribute to pain dys-
regulation by increasing negative emotions and emotional 
lability over time. The use of NSSI to regulate negative 
affect is common in BPD and while it may have short-term 
benefits, it may ultimately increase dysregulation. Use of 
emotion suppression, another potentially maladaptive cop-
ing strategy, in response to social stressors and under high 
distress has recently been associated with greater daily pain 
interference for individuals with BPD features (N = 89), even 
after accounting for daily pain intensity [54].

In addition to finding generally higher pain threshold 
and lower pain intensity among those with BPD, Fales and 
colleagues’ review [25••] indicated that BPD participants 
had higher pain tolerance (the length of time one is able to 
endure a painful stimulus) specifically under conditions of 
emotional distress. This process, known as stress-induced 
analgesia,  has  also  been  observed  in  other  clinical  and 

non-clinical groups, as well as in animals, and is believed to 
be a generally adaptive, evolved pain suppression response 
[55]. However, outside of the laboratory, evidence for stress-
induced analgesia during NSSI is lacking. For instance, in a 
recent large (N = 1630) cross-sectional study of people with 
a history of NSSI who were high in BPD features, greater 
emotional distress before NSSI predicted greater NSSI pain 
[26]. It remains unclear whether and why stress-induced 
analgesia may be enhanced in individuals with BPD and 
what this means for people with BPD [27].

Dissociation, a psychological state characterized by per-
ceived disconnection, is another psychological process that 
may impact the experience of acute pain in BPD. Transient 
dissociation is common among people with BPD, particularly 
in response to stress. Furthermore, prior review of 70 studies 
indicates that BPD symptom severity is associated with both 
experiencing dissociation and decreased pain perception [56]. 
A recent study by Chung et al. [57•] found that individuals 
who currently met criteria for BPD (n = 25) showed greater 
pain hyposensitivity during experimental pain induction than 
those with remitted BPD (n = 20) and a non-clinical control 
group (n = 24). This study also examined pain perception and 
dissociation following a personalized stress task, finding that 
stress and dissociation independently contributed to pain hypo-
sensitivity for both the current and the remitted BPD groups 
[57•]. Dissociation has also been associated with lower self-
reported NSSI pain [26]. Broadly, there is evidence for adverse 
effects of dissociation on affective-cognitive functioning, body 
perception, and treatment response in BPD [58]. Dissociation 
has also been suggested as a transdiagnostic symptom involved 
in the pathway between adverse childhood experiences, psychi-
atric disorders (e.g., BPD and post-traumatic stress disorder), 
and pain chronicity or pain-related disability [59].

Dissociation commonly includes a distorted perception of 
the self, one’s body, or one’s sense of agency. A factor that 
may be related to experiencing dissociation is a person’s abil-
ity to sense their own body, or their interoceptive sensitivity. 
Individuals with high interoceptive sensitivity are better able 
to differentiate between various signals from their body’s 
organs (e.g., heart rate). Among those with BPD, interocep-
tive sensitivity has been associated with pain intensity ratings 
in laboratory pain tasks. Specifically, low body awareness 
has been associated with analgesia [60], which may facilitate 
NSSI behaviors and explain prior findings of high pain thresh-
old and low pain intensity among those with BPD. However, 
people with higher levels of interoceptive sensitivity and BPD 
(n = 46) rated lower temperatures as evoking moderate pain 
and reported higher pain intensity ratings than control par-
ticipants (n = 47) [60]. The fact that the effect of interoceptive 
sensitivity was observed for those with BPD but not control 
participants may be explained if individuals with BPD specifi-
cally respond to internal stimuli with anxiety and catastrophic 
thinking, such as in response to recurrent pain.

Social Processes

Social processes that affect acute and chronic pain in BPD 
play out in different contexts, which include not only the 
context of personal relationships but also the healthcare 
context. Within personal relationships, the BPD feature of 
negative relationships (i.e., unstable interpersonal relation-
ships) has been associated with increased rates of pain-
related disability, general disability, and unemployment in 
a chronic pain sample (N = 147) [61••]. Individuals with 
maladaptive interpersonal patterns may experience a lack of 
social support, as well as more conflictual relationships with 
healthcare providers, and discontinuity in healthcare provid-
ers as a result of conflict, each of which could contribute to 
greater chronic pain and disability. People with BPD utilize 
healthcare services at rates greater than the general popu-
lation [62], and yet, many who seek treatment for chronic 
pain experience barriers to accessing treatment, which again 
underlines the need for scientific attention. Chronic pain is 
a subjective experience and medical providers must rely on 
patient reports of their pain experiences. However, patients 
with BPD may be perceived as untrustworthy by healthcare 
providers, even when their diagnosis is not known. When 
raters in three samples (N = 98, N = 94, N = 44) viewed video 
samples of BPD and healthy control participants as targets, 
they rated BPD targets as less likeable, less trustworthy, and 
less cooperative [63, 64]. Providers may perceive patients 
with BPD as less trustworthy because they report high lev-
els of pain severity and express frustration with the (lack 
of) treatment provided for their pain conditions [65•] or as 
a result of negative stigma [66]. The interpersonal deficits 
seen in BPD, and those in chronic pain samples with BPD 
features, may contribute to the perpetuation of chronic pain 
experiences in spite of attempts to receive treatment for 
chronic pain or contributory medical conditions.

Appropriate treatment for chronic pain is an especially 
important issue for those with BPD given challenges specific 
to this population. Despite concerns about risks, prescription 
opioids remain a primary treatment option of chronic pain, 
particularly in the US [67]. Frankenburg et al. [68] found 
that participants with BPD (n = 264) were more likely to 
report prescription opioid use than comparison participants 
with another personality disorder (n = 63), which may be 
due to higher rates of co-occurrence of BPD with chronic 
pain  conditions.  Additional  evidence  suggests  that  peo-
ple with BPD may be at risk for problematic prescription 
opioid use. For instance, in a sample of outpatients who 
currently or have previously been prescribed pain medica-
tion (N = 185), BPD symptoms were associated with meas-
ures of prescription pain medication misuse [69]. In col-
lege student samples, BPD features have been associated 
with negative reinforcement motives (coping and pain) for 

prescription opioid use (N = 594) [70] and measures of mis-
use, including opioid consequences and dependence features 
(N = 606) [71]. Finally, in samples in treatment for chronic 
pain (N = 147) and samples in treatment for substance use 
disorder (N = 208), BPD features have been associated with 
prescription opioid misuse, with particularly strong associa-
tions between measures of misuse and the identity distur-
bance and self-harm/impulsivity facets of BPD [72•, 73]. It 
is important to note that these findings do not indicate that 
people with BPD cannot benefit from appropriate opioid 
therapy. However, patients with BPD and chronic pain may 
benefit from additional monitoring and resources (e.g., sup-
port, psychoeducation, psychosocial therapy) when complet-
ing a course of prescription opioids.

Conclusions

We reviewed evidence on chronic, acute, and everyday pain 
in BPD from the past 5 years, and conclude that BPD symp-
tom severity is positively associated with pain dysregulation 
and pain-related disability [28•, 52, 61••]. The experiences 
of pain in BPD may be mediated by interconnected biopsy-
chosocial processes, manifesting in emotion dysregulation 
and dysregulated experiences of physical pain. Recent fMRI 
studies suggest that neural activation in cognitive/affective 
areas in people with BPD differs from healthy control par-
ticipants [35], but those with BPD generally showed no dif-
ferences from control participants in somatosensory areas 
[33, 34]. While preliminary and based on small sample sizes, 
these fMRI studies may indicate that altered pain percep-
tion is specifically related to affective processing of sensory 
information. This idea is reinforced by recent findings that 
negative affect and affective instability contribute to chronic 
pain experiences in individuals high in BPD features [28•, 
52]. There is also evidence to suggest that pain and emo-
tion dysregulation may be manifestations of chronically 
low endogenous opioids, which regulate the experience of 
pain [41–43, 49, 50•]. Social challenges between providers 
and patients with BPD features [63, 64, 65•, 66] could lead 
to non-pharmacological treatments for chronic pain being 
underutilized in BPD populations. Providers may also be 
less willing to prescribe opioids to people with BPD, poten-
tially leading people with BPD to go without adequate pain 
treatment or to seek out non-prescribed opioids or other sub-
stances to self-medicate their pain.

In summary, our review indicates that dysregulated physi-
cal pain is common in BPD and important in shaping health 
outcomes, including risk for opioid misuse, BPD symptoms, 
and chronic pain. Evidence suggests that emotion dysregula-
tion components (emotion sensitivity, negative affect, affec-
tive lability, and maladaptive coping behaviors) mediate the 
relationship between BPD and dysregulated physical pain.

Underlying emotion dysregulation, differences in the cogni-
tive and affective neural processing of information, as well 
as physiological deficits in the endogenous opioids system, 
likely also contribute to physical pain dysregulation. Mis-
trust and interpersonal challenges between patients and pro-
viders may exacerbate chronic pain symptoms and disability 
levels by hindering appropriate treatment of chronic pain.

We  recommend  regularly  assessing  BPD  traits  in 
chronic pain populations and vice versa, and encourage 
comprehensive care for physical and mental health. Addi-
tionally, chronic pain should be assessed as a psychother-
apy outcome for BPD populations, along with measures 
of BPD symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and negative 
affect. Evaluating multiple indices of physical and mental 
health regularly in this population can provide evidence 
for directionality and indicate if improvements in emotion 
regulation improve pain experiences.

Beyond BPD, pain processes in other categorical per-
sonality disorders and the new dimensional personality 
disorder diagnosis in ICD-11 warrant further attention 
[74]. The present article focused on BPD because this 
was the disorder commonly examined in recent literature 
and it is also the personality disorder with the highest 
reported incidence of chronic pain [21] and largest body 
of  evidence  on  dysregulated  acute  pain  [25 ••].  How-
ever, there is evidence for high rates of trauma history 
and emotion dysregulation in other personality disorders 
[75], which may similarly alter the endogenous opioid 
system [76] and neural responses to pain, contributing 
to altered pain perception. Furthermore, BPD has been 
suggested to reflect general personality pathology [77]. 
Biological, psychological, and social processes observed 
within BPD samples could occur on a transdiagnostic 
and dimensional spectrum, but research on dimensional 
models of personality disorder and pain was exceedingly 
rare within the past five years.
