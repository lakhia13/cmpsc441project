Abstract
The complex mental health needs of refugee and asylum seeker (RAS) communities, often resulting from past trauma, are 
not met by overburdened and inadequate service provision. Pre-displacement, in-transit, and post-settlement traumas create 
a specific set of mental health needs which underfunded mental health services often cannot meet, despite the illusion of 
access to a range of services. This paper aims to explore how a range of stakeholders responded to inadequate provision at 
the local level. Interviews and focus groups with regional stakeholders, charities and RAS community groups, which were 
conducted as part of wider mixed-methods project on international migration in Northern England, revealed several gaps in 
provision. Findings indicate that charities and community groups are often left to fill the gap and provide signposting and 
liaison with local authorities. However, these groups are often ill-equipped to provide sufficient support but the absence of 
commissioned services leaves limited options. We conclude by suggesting that further research is necessary on trauma, RAS 
communities, and the pathways to mental health support.

This paper uses data from a mixed-methods research project 
that mapped the impact of migration on the settled commu-
nity of a town in Northern England [1], which included iden-
tifying impacts on local service provision [2]. Significant 
questions emerged about the scale of mental health issues 
within the local refugee and asylum seeker (RAS) commu-
nity, alongside gaps in service provision. The original con-
tribution shows that gaps in service provision for complex 
trauma and mental health needs are filled by local Voluntary 
and Community Sector (VCS) groups. This article outlines 
literature on RAS mental health to present a framework that

situates the existence of trauma at three stages: in the events 
that preceded exit from country of origin; in transit; and in 
settlement in the UK [3, 4]. Following a short methodo-
logical discussion of our case study, we present qualitative 
findings to illustrate our argument; that RAS mental health 
is distinct from a wider mental health crisis in respect to 
specific traumatic experiences and that service provision is 
often unsuitable, despite the best intentions of a range of 
stakeholders. As global and regional events continue to pro-
pel migrants from their countries of origin [5], understand-
ing the nature and impact of trauma along various points of 
the migration journey will be essential in ensuring adequate 
support in host countries and local authority (LA) areas.

Background

Mental health has increasingly moved to the forefront of 
public consciousness: research demonstrates rising levels 
of mental ill health, anxiety, and depression [6], particularly 
in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the lim-
its to service provision [7]. RAS communities are far from 
homogenous and do not exhibit the same mental ill health 
issues but do represent a population exposed to specific

mental health affects [8]. Lindencrona et al. [9] argue that 
refugees are more likely to face post-traumatic stress disor-
der (PTSD), depression and anxiety compared to settled pop-
ulations. DeAntsiss et al. [10] identified a range of reported 
mental health problems in refugee children including learn-
ing difficulties and impaired school function, defiance and 
hyperactivity, eating disorders, sleep disturbance, aggres-
sion, bedwetting, nail biting, suicidal ideation and attempted 
suicide, self-harm, introversion and tiredness. DeAntsiss 
et al. [10] also found children were often more resilient and 
many refugee children showed no adverse effects of trau-
matic experiences, indicating the complex nature of mental 
health. Here, we recognise the impact of pre-displacement 
trauma, transit and flight, and post-displacement or set-
tlement trauma as distinctive [11–13] requiring specific 
responses from a range of services [14].

Pre-displacement triggers, those events that force refu-
gees and asylum seekers from their home countries, appear 
to be influenced by traumatic war experiences, levels of edu-
cation [4], socio-demographic factors, age, loss of parents, 
and high levels of exposure to trauma and violence [10]. 
In Briggs’ study of refugees across Europe [5], many had 
faced war, bombings, terrorism, political murder, torture, 
beheadings, rape and sexual assault. In older refugees with 
lower levels of education and extreme traumatic experiences, 
Bogic et al. [4] found a higher incidence of PTSD. Jewkes’ 
[15] work on female prisoners follows Burstow’s contention 
that trauma is a fluid phenomenon that exists on a complex 
continuum. Dura-Vila et al. [3] found that more recent arriv-
als and younger refugees had considerable mental health 
needs and were often more likely to have exposure to war 
and violence.

Post-settlement factors also appear to impact upon RAS 
mental health [11]. McColl and Johnson [14] neatly sum-
marise this,

In the UK, post-migration adversities include social 
isolation, discrimination, poverty, lack of stable hous-
ing, and uncertainty about asylum applications. Gov-
ernment policies and legislation can also contribute 
to post-migration adversities for asylum seekers and 
include dispersal, detention, and denial of the right to 
work. These adversities and the cultural diversity of 
refugee populations are likely to make meeting their 
needs a considerable challenge for UK mental health 
services. (790).

The administrative process of seeking asylum has been 
linked to heightened anxiety, particularly if the culture or 
atmosphere of that country is hostile or unwelcoming [10, 
16]. Jannesari et al’s systematic review [11] found seven 
themes associated with mental health problems amongst asy-
lum seekers: working conditions; social networks; economic 
class; living conditions; healthcare; community and identity; 

and the immigration system. All link to post-migration. 
Additionally, Kim’s [12] study of Latino and Asian refugees 
in the US found unemployment, everyday discrimination 
and limited English were significantly associated with poor 
mental health. Likewise, McColl and Johnson [14] identified 
high and unmet need, which included finance and housing, 
social contact and daytime activity, were all post-settlement 
factors. Kim [12] further suggests that post rather than pre-
settlement traumas were less likely to affect mental health 
outcomes, but the combination of pre- and post-settlement 
traumatic experience creates a specific set of issues that 
require trauma-informed intervention.

This increases pressure on local support services, includ-
ing health care. In their case study of a North London com-
munity intervention, Harris and Maxwell [17] found that 
therapy and counselling alone were not sufficient to sup-
port refugee communities. DeAntsiss et al. [10] highlighted 
problems with limited access to same culture child mental 
health services, high cost, waiting times, service complexity, 
bureaucracy and a reliance on primary health care. Relat-
edly, McColl and Johnson [14] point out the cultural and 
linguistic barriers that services must overcome to manage 
complex clinical need. Pre- and post-migration effects play 
a significant role in RAS mental health and impacts upon 
support services. We now turn to our project to situate our 
research in this context.

Methodology

This research comes from a Controlling Migration Fund 
(CMF) study commissioned by a local authority in North-
ern England [2]. We mapped the impact of international 
migration  on  the  settled  community  of  an  anonymised 
local authority area. Research objectives included: map-
ping demographic change; considering the impact of recent 
demographic change on community cohesion; issues related 
to crime; and the impact of international migration on local 
services. We analysed public and private data to provide 
baseline insight and attended almost 100 meetings with a 
wide variety of stakeholders. The project team undertook 
41 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, partners, 
local VCS, BAME and refugee support groups, and commu-
nity residents. We also conducted focus groups with VCS, 
BAME and refugee support groups, speaking to 21 addi-
tional participants. We employed participant observation 
and ethnographic methods spending extensive time in two 
town centre wards, in excess of 50 hours, which included 
informal discussions with residents and business owners, 
and attending community meetings. Project stakeholders 
included the local authority, the regional police force, the 
Police and Crime Commissioner’s office, local representa-
tion from Public Health England and the Regional Migration

Partnership. This phase of the project ran from 2017 to 2019. 
The project received ethical approval from the host institu-
tion’s Research Ethics Committee.

The local authority area covers a population of around 
140,000,  increasingly  sustained  by  inward  international 
migration [2, 18]. This locale has undergone a sustained and 
challenging process of deindustrialisation and entrenched 
socio-economic deprivation [1]. According to the English 
Indices of Deprivation [19], over 50% of wards in this local 
authority area are situated within the 20% most deprived 
wards in the UK. Around 10% of the local population were 
born outside the UK, from around 50 different countries, 
whilst long-term Asian and Middle Eastern communities 
settled from the 1950s onwards. Recent Eastern European 
arrivals have further concentrated migration in three cen-
tral wards, where the 2011 census reported 25–30% of resi-
dents as non-UK born. Additionally, the local authority is 
an asylum seeker dispersal area. We have anonymised the 
local authority area and all participants have been given 
pseudonyms.

Findings

The findings on mental health and the RAS community 
reflect consistent themes across the literature relating to 
the severity of trauma (post and pre-settlement), mental ill 
health, and gaps in service provision. This was confirmed 
both by RAS community groups and by stakeholders includ-
ing public health officials, police officers and mental health 
professionals. Year-on-year funding cuts to NHS mental 
health provision have led to a system stretched to crisis 
point, which cannot respond to mental health need [7], let 
alone for those with complex and multiple vulnerabilities. In 
addition, our research location has historically experienced 
some of the highest rates of asylum seeker dispersal in the 
UK. Given that decisions on dispersal areas are based solely 
on the availability of low-cost housing stock with no regard 
for the impact on local services, this may have increased 
pressure on mental health service provision in the town. The 
absence of a multi-agency approach to RAS mental health 
care or adequate service provision through normal channels 
left VCS organisations to fill the gap.

Our data highlights the scale and extreme nature of men-
tal ill health amongst the RAS community. Respondents 
from the focus groups with BAME and refugee support 
groups both agreed that mental health represented the big-
gest issue facing this community. One participant referred 
to ‘extreme trauma’ while another spoke of people in a state 
of ‘mental chaos’. This manifested in suicides, fatal inter-
personal violence, as well as people sleeping rough despite 
their right to remain. Another focus group participant from 
a refugee support group, Sam, referred to people carrying 

knives  with  others  afraid  to  leave  their  homes.  Indeed, 
although they represent extreme cases, our findings refer 
to several deaths due to trauma and mental illness in recent 
years, exemplified here:

There’s quite a lot of issues with mental health within 
our communities. I know…a number of people who 
have mental issues, some of them are not aware of it 
but you can see from them. I have one friend who is 
now in [secure mental health hospital], yeah, he’s there 
because he killed somebody in the house he used to 
share. He came in as an asylum seeker…I used to see 
him…I used to advise him as well. And this happened, 
I met him, I give him advice. I was talking to Talking 
Therapies for an appointment for him so they would 
see him and over the weekend he stabbed somebody 
in the house.
We have cases that are sad to see; you see someone 
deteriorating…because  they’re  not  getting  enough 
support here…I know a lady who was here who used 
to bring their child for play area here [local VCS] for 
children, she started deteriorating slowly and eventu-
ally it escalated after a few months. The next thing she 
was walking almost naked in the streets here, but still 
nothing will be done.

These quotations show both the nature of trauma and 
mental ill health and also the feeling that timely support was 
missing or inadequate. In the first case, the RAS community 
functions as the support mechanism, talking to a troubled 
individual, providing guidance and even contacting Talking 
Therapies. In the second, the community member bears wit-
ness to this woman’s decline in the absence of appropriate 
support.

This is not to say that there is an absence of provision. A 
range of services are available, from self-referral to the local 
mental health trust, asylum seeker-commissioned GP ser-
vices, Talking Therapies, and charitable support. The local 
authority also employs liaison officers which is a positive 
step. However, it is widely recognised that mental health 
provision in general is underfunded and the common view 
amongst the RAS community, and those working with them, 
was that services for their community were inadequate. Find-
ings did identify issues with poor signposting, absence of 
joined up provision and a lack of bespoke trauma-informed 
provision capable of dealing with language barriers as well 
as a lack of intermediate-level support [17]. A health care 
professional, Jane, working with the local Public Health 
team emphasised this point,

“one of the big issues for vulnerable migrants, asylum 
seekers, refugees and some BME EU is around accessing 
mental health, appropriate mental health. Because, there 
are services that are available, but it’s not necessarily suit-
able for people who might have experienced like you know,

adverse things like torture or like, rape and persecution. 
And, what you find is that people then start to present in 
A&E first of all, and then in the Mental Health Trust when 
they reach a crisis point.”

Trauma and mental ill health in the RAS community 
must be viewed within the wider context where public ser-
vices, including mental health provision, have seen funding 
cuts and capacity reductions that impact upon all commu-
nity members [7]. If mental health provision is already dif-
ficult to access, groups with specific vulnerabilities and a 
higher degree of need will encounter barriers to access. On 
the face of it, there may be a list of options which give the 
impression that mental health support is available, but the 
difficulty in securing access coupled with the complexity 
of need renders this availability illusory. Moreover, refu-
gee and asylum seeker communities have specificities that 
require understandings of trauma and would benefit from a 
trauma-informed approach [20]. Often, the misrecognition 
of trauma as cultural difference, ‘difficult’ behaviour or sim-
ple misunderstanding can inadvertently exacerbate an issue. 
In interviews with local authority and NHS staff and police 
officers, RAS mental health was not regarded as an over-
whelming issue or drain on service provision but its distinct 
features, usually characterised as differences in experience 
and background, were acknowledged. Ultimately community 
members were quick to point out that charities, third sector 
and the refugee communities themselves filled the gap and 
provided support for complex cases which clearly involve 
trauma.

Discussion

We offer a new contribution to the literature via data from 
a funded project in Northern England that shows the spe-
cific nature and severity of mental ill health amongst RAS 
communities. The community itself suggested that traumatic 
experience manifests as mental ill health and creates service 
provision challenges for stretched public services. Refugee 
and asylum seekers inevitably face multiple traumas before 
and during their settlement in destination locales and support 
is required at all levels to help manage and cope with this 
trauma. As with the wider community, mental health and 
other public services face straitened conditions that prevent 
adequate and immediate levels of support and this is only 
anticipated to grow in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
We saw how the community itself, and charitable organisa-
tions, were expected to assume a high degree of responsibil-
ity to support those with complex trauma and specific need 
due to a lack of awareness or provision within local public 
services. This is unsustainable in the long-term and further 
research into trauma-informed service across all public sec-
tor providers alongside support for community members 

learning to cope with the day-to-day realities of trauma is 
required otherwise cases such as those identified here will 
continue to occur.
