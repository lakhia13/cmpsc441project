Of all the different types of emotions, happiness tends to be the one that people strive for the most. Happiness is often defined as a pleasant emotional state that is characterized by feelings of contentment, joy, gratification, satisfaction, and well-being.

Research on happiness has increased significantly since the 1960s within a number of disciplines, including the branch of psychology known aspositive psychology. This type of emotion is sometimes expressed through:

- Facial expressions,such as smiling

- Body language,such as a relaxed stance

- Tone of voice,such as an upbeat, pleasant way of speaking

While happiness is considered one of the basic human emotions, the things wethinkwill create happiness tend to be heavily influenced by culture.For example, pop culture influences tend to emphasize that attaining certain things, such as buying a home or having a high-paying job, will result in happiness.

The realities of what actually contributes to happiness are often much more complex and more highly individualized. People have long believed thathappiness and health are connected, and research has supported the idea that happiness can play a role in both physical and mental health.

Happiness has been linked to a variety of outcomes including increased longevity and greater marital satisfaction.Conversely, unhappiness has been linked to a variety of poor health outcomes and challenges in relationships.

Stress, anxiety, depression, andloneliness, for example, have been linked to things such as lowered immunity, increased inflammation, and decreased life expectancy.

Sadness is another type of emotion often defined as a transient emotional state characterized by feelings of:

Like other emotions, sadness is something that all people experience from time to time. In some cases, people can experience prolonged and severe periods of sadness that can turn intodepression. Sadness can be expressed in a number of ways, including:

- Withdrawal from others

The type and severity of sadness can vary depending on the root cause, and how people cope with such feelings can also differ.

Sadness can often lead people to engage in coping mechanisms such as avoiding other people, self-medicating, andruminatingon negative thoughts. Such behaviors can actually exacerbate feelings of sadness and prolong the duration of the emotion.

Fear is a powerful emotion that can also play an essential role in survival. When you face some sort of danger and experience fear, you go through what is known as thefight or flight response.

Your muscles tense, your heart rate and respiration increase, and your mind becomes more alert, priming your body to either run from the danger or stand and fight.

This response helps ensure you are prepared to deal with threats in your environment effectively. Expressions of this type of emotion can include:

- Facial expressions: Such as widening the eyes and pulling back the chin

- Body language: Attempts to hide or flee from the threat

- Physiological reactions: Such as rapid breathing and heartbeat

Of course, not everyone experiences fear in the same way. Some people may be more sensitive to fear, and certain situations or objects may be more likely to trigger this emotion.

Fear is the emotional response to an immediate threat. We can also develop a similar reaction to anticipated threats or even our thoughts about potential dangers, and this is what we generally think of as anxiety.Social anxiety, for example, involves an anticipated fear of social situations.

Some people, on the other hand, actuallyseek out fear-provoking situations. Extreme sports and other thrills can be fear-inducing, but some people seem to thrive and enjoy such feelings.

Repeated exposure to a feared object or situation can lead to familiarity and acclimation, which can reduce feelings of fear and anxiety.

This is the idea behindexposure therapy,in which people are gradually exposed to the things that frighten them in a controlled and safe manner. Eventually, feelings of fear begin to decrease.

Disgust is another of the original six basic emotions described byEckman. Disgust can be displayed in a number of ways including:

- Body language: Turning away from the object of disgust

- Physical reactions: Such as vomiting or retching

- Facial expressions: Such as wrinkling the nose and curling the upper lip

This sense of revulsion can originate from a number of things, including an unpleasant taste, sight, or smell. Researchers believe that this emotion evolved as a reaction to foods that might be harmful or fatal.For example, disgust is a typical reaction when people smell or taste foods that have gone bad.

Poor hygiene, infection, blood, rot, and death can also trigger a disgust response. This may be the body's way of avoiding things that may carry transmissible diseases.

People can also experience moral disgust when they observe others engaging in behaviors that they find distasteful, immoral, or evil.

Anger can be a particularly powerful emotion characterized by hostility, agitation, frustration, and antagonism toward others. Like fear, anger can affect the body's fight-or-flight response.

When a threat generates feelings of anger, you may be inclined to fend off the danger and protect yourself. Anger is often displayed through:

- Facial expressions: Such as frowning or glaring

- Body language: Such as taking a strong stance or turning away

- Tone of voice: Such as speaking gruffly or yelling

- Physiological responses: Such as sweating or turning red

- Aggressive behaviors: Such as hitting, kicking, or throwing objects

While anger is often considered a negative emotion, it can sometimes be good. It can be constructive, helping clarify one's needs in a relationship and motivating one to take action and find solutions to problems.

However, anger can become a problem when it is excessive or expressed in unhealthy, dangerous, or harmful ways. Uncontrolled anger can quickly turn toaggression, abuse, or violence.

This type of emotion can have bothmental and physical consequences. Unchecked anger can make it difficult to make rational decisions and can even have an impact on your physical health.

Anger has been linked to coronary heart disease and diabetes. It has also been linked to behaviors that pose health risks, such as aggressive driving, alcohol consumption, and smoking.

Surprise is another of Eckman's six basic types of human emotions. It is usually quite brief and characterized by a physiological startle response following something unexpected.

This type of emotion can be positive, negative, or neutral. An unpleasant surprise, for example, might involve someone jumping out from behind a tree and scaring you as you walk to your car at night.

An example of a pleasant surprise would be arriving home to find that your closest friends have gathered to celebrate your birthday. Surprise is often characterized by:

- Facial expressions: Such as raising the brows, widening the eyes, and opening the mouth

- Physical responses: Such as jumping back

- Verbal reactions: Such as yelling, screaming, or gasping

Surprise is another type of emotion that can trigger the fight-or-flight response. When startled, people may experience a burst of adrenaline that helps prepare the body to fight or flee.

Surprise can have important effects on human behavior. For example, research has shown that people tend to disproportionately notice surprising events.

This is why surprising and unusual events in the news tend to stand out in memory more than others. Research has also found that people tend to be more swayed by surprising arguments and learn more from surprising information.
