Abstract

Context— Only limited information exists about the epidemiology of DSM-IV panic attacks and
panic disorder.

Objective— To present nationally representative data on the epidemiology of panic attacks and
panic disorder with or without agoraphobia based on the National Comorbidity Survey Replication
(NCS-R).

Design and Setting— Nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted using
the fully structured WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).

Participants— 9282 English-speaking respondents ages 18 and older.

Main Outcome Measures— DSM-IV panic attacks (PA) and panic disorder (PD) with and
without agoraphobia (AG).

Results— Lifetime prevalence estimates are 22.7% for isolated panic without agoraphobia (PA-
only), 0.8% for PA with agoraphobia without PD (PA-AG), 3.7% for PD without AG (PD-only), and
1.1% for PD with AG (PD-AG). Persistence, number of lifetime attacks, and number of years with
attacks all increase monotonically across these four subgroups. All four subgroups are significantly
comorbid with other lifetime DSM-IV disorders, with the highest odds for PD-AG and the lowest
for PA-only. Scores on the Panic Disorder Severity Scale are also highest for PD-AG (86.3%
moderate-severe) and lowest for PA-only (6.7% moderate-severe). Agoraphobia is associated with
substantial severity, impairment, and comorbidity. Lifetime treatment is high (from 96.1% PD-AG
to 61.1% PA-only), but 12-month treatment meeting published treatment guidelines is low (from
54.9% PD-AG to 18.2% PA-only).

Conclusions— Although the major societal burden of panic is due to PD and PA-AGG, isolated
panic attacks also have high prevalence and meaningful role impairment.

Keywords

agoraphobia; panic attacks; panic disorder; epidemiology

Epidemiological surveys have helped advance understanding of panic by studying the
prevalence and distribution,1–3 onset and course,4 associations with comorbid disorders,5–7
and societal costs.8, 9 Despite these advances, though, important questions remain unanswered
about the epidemiology of panic,10 among the most important of them regarding the finding
that many people experience isolated panic attacks that do not meet criteria for panic disorder.

These people have elevated prevalence of other mental disorders.6, 11 They report higher
impairment, use of psychotropic medication, and psychiatric help-seeking than people with
many Axis I disorders.8 Such findings have led to the view that panic attacks are fairly
nonspecific risk markers for psychopathology.12

Importantly, some people with isolated panic attacks meet criteria for agoraphobia.13 It is not
known, though, whether the persistent course and poor outcome associated with agoraphobia
among people with panic disorder14 also apply to panic attacks with agoraphobia. As a result,
the boundary between panic attack and panic disorder and the relative role of agoraphobia
within each are not well understood. Investigation and comparison of these symptom
presentations in community samples might help clarify these issues. The current report presents
initial data of this sort from the recently completed National Comorbidity Survey Replication
(NCS-R).

METHODS

Sample

The NCS-R is a nationally representative survey of 9282 English-speaking household residents
ages 18+ in the coterminous United States. Face-to-face interviews were carried out between
February 2001 and April 2003. The response rate was 70.9%. Consent was verbal rather than
written to parallel the baseline NCS procedures. The Human Subjects Committees of Harvard
Medical School and the University of Michigan both approved the NCS-R recruitment and
consent procedures. Respondents were interviewed in two parts. The Part I interview,
administered to all respondents, included the core diagnostic assessment. The Part II interview,
administered to all Part I respondents who met criteria for any lifetime core disorder plus a
probability sub-sample of others (for a total of 5692 Part II respondents), assessed correlates
and disorders of secondary interest. The Part I sample is used here to examine prevalence and
course, clinical severity and role impairment, and most aspects of comorbidity. The Part II
sample is used to examine comorbidity with disorders of secondary interest to the survey, socio-
demographic correlates, and treatment. The Part I sample was weighted to adjust for differential
probability of selection and discrepancies between the sample and the US population on Census
socio-demographic and geographic variables. The Part II sample was additionally weighted to
adjust for differential probability of selection from the Part I sample. More details on NCS-R
sampling and weights are reported elsewhere .15

Panic and agoraphobia

Panic and agoraphobia were assessed using Version 3.0 of the World Health Organization
World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI),16 a fully
structured lay-administered diagnostic interview (www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmhcidi). The
assessment of panic was comparable to that in previous version of the CIDI with the exception
that a distinction was made between uncued panic attacks (described as occurring “out of the
blue” with no triggering event) and cued panic attacks. A series of parallel questions was asked
about each of these two types of attacks. Panic disorder was defined as the occurrence of four
or more uncued panic attacks not due to substance use or a general medical condition
accompanied by one month or more of either persistent concern about recurrence, worry about
the implications of the attacks, or significant change in behavior because of the attacks.
Agoraphobia was defined as anxiety about two or more situations that had to include “either
being in crowds, going to public places, traveling by yourself, or traveling away from home”
associated with a fear of having a panic attack and fear that it might be difficult or embarrassing
to escape. This fear had to result either in avoidance of the feared situations, distress upon
exposure to these situations, or the necessity of a companion during these situations. We used
these classifications to define four subgroups for comparative analysis: panic attack without

panic disorder and without agoraphobia (PA-only), panic attack with panic disorder, but with
agoraphobia (PA-AG), panic disorder without agoraphobia (PD-only), and panic disorder with
agoraphobia (PD-AG). PA-only is not a codable DSM-IV disorder. PA-AG is a subset of the
DSM-IV category “agoraphobia without a history of panic disorder,” excluding respondents
with agoraphobia who never had a panic attack. This latter subgroup is not considered in this
report, as we focus exclusively on people with a history of panic.

As detailed elsewhere,17, 18 blinded clinical reappraisal interviews using the lifetime non-
patient version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)19 were administered
to a probability sub-sample of 325 NCS-R respondents to assess concordance with CIDI
diagnoses. CIDI-SCID concordance for PD diagnosis had an area under the receiver operator
characteristic curve (AUC) of .72, a moderate Kappa (standard error) of .45 (.15), and a very
high odds-ratio (95% Confidence Interval) of 56.3 (15.5–204.6). No bias in the CIDI
prevalence estimate compared to the SCID was found using a McNemar test (χ2
1 = 0.0, p = .
820). CIDI-SCID concordance was not assessed for PA because the latter was not evaluated
separately in the SCID, or for AG because it occurred too infrequently in the clinical reappraisal
study for reliable analysis of concordance. DSM-IV requires “recurrent” uncued panic attacks,
which could be interpreted as two or more, for a PD diagnosis. However, CIDI respondents
who reported 2–3 lifetime uncued panic attacks generally were found in the SCID to have had
only one full panic attack with additional limited symptom attacks. Validity of the CIDI in
relation to the SCID consequently was improved when we required at least four lifetime uncued
attacks in the CIDI. The insignificant McNemar test documents that the CIDI PD prevalence
estimate does not differ significantly from the SCID estimate despite the SCID requiring only
two attacks.

Course, severity, and impairment

Respondents who met DSM-IV lifetime criteria for PA were asked to estimate the age of onset
(AOO) of their first attack and AOO of having four uncued attacks with a month of persistent
worry. They were also asked to estimate their age at their most recent attack, number of lifetime
uncued and cued attacks, and number of years with at least one attack. Clinical severity was
assessed only for 12-month cases using a fully structured version of the seven-question Panic
Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) that was developed specifically for the NCS-R. (Question
wording is posted at www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs.) The clinician-administered version of
the PDSS has been found to yield a reliable and valid assessment of overall panic disorder
clinical severity.20 A separate fully structured version of the PDSS, developed independently
of the NCS-R version but with very similar wording, has excellent concordance with the
clinician-administered version.21 Published PDSS cut points were used to define severity
(none, mild, moderate, severe).

Although two of the seven PDSS questions assess role impairment, a more generic measure
of role impairment, the Sheehan Disability Scales (SDS),22 was also included in each section
of the CIDI. The SDS asked respondents with 12-month panic to focus on the one month in
the past year when their panic, their worry about having another panic attack, or their restriction
of activity because of this worry interfered most with their life and activities, and to rate this
interference on a 0-to-10 visual analogue scale with response options of none (0), mild (1–3),
moderate (4–6), severe (7–9), and very severe (10). Interference ratings were obtained for four
role domains: home management, work, social life, and personal relationships. Responses were
combined by taking the highest score across the four ratings and collapsing the severe and very
severe response categories.

Comorbid DSM-IV disorders

The NCS-R assessed a number of other DSM-IV disorders: other anxiety disorders (generalized
anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, and adult manifestations of separation anxiety disorder), mood disorders
(major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, and bipolar I and II disorders), substance use
disorders (alcohol and illicit drug abuse and dependence, where abuse and dependence on
specific illicit drugs were combined with polysubstance abuse and dependence), and impulse-
control disorders (intermittent explosive disorder and adult manifestations of three child-
adolescent impulse-control disorders -- attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional-
defiant disorder, and conduct disorder). Organic exclusion rules and diagnostic hierarchy rules
were used in making all diagnoses. As reported in more detail elsewhere,18 blinded clinical
reappraisal interviews using the non-patient version of the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV (SCID)19 found generally good concordance between CIDI and SCID diagnoses of
anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders, with area under the ROC curve in the range .65–.
81, Kappa in the range .33–.70, and odds-ratios in the range 6.3–877.0. Diagnoses of impulse-
control disorders were not validated because the SCID does not assess these disorders.

Two questions about lifetime and 12-month treatment of panic were asked at the end of the
panic section. Part II respondents were additionally administered more general questions about
whether they ever received treatment for any “problems with your emotions or nerves or your
use of alcohol or drugs" and, if so, about types of professionals seen.23 Treatment was
distinguished in five sectors: psychiatry, non-psychiatry mental health specialty, general
medical, human services, and complementary-alternative (CAM). Questions about treatment
in the 12 months before interview asked about number and duration of visits, number and
duration of psychotherapy sessions, and name, dose, and duration of each medication used. No
information was obtained about the content of psychotherapy. A rough measure of 12-month
guideline-concordant treatment of panic was developed using these reports based on available
evidence-based guidelines.24 Guideline-concordant treatment was defined as receiving either
pharmacotherapy (at least two months of an appropriate medication, defined as antidepressants
or anxiolytics,25 plus at least four visits to any type of medical doctor) or psychotherapy (at
least eight visits with any health care or human services professional lasting an average of at
least 30 minutes). The decision to require at least four physician visits for pharmacotherapy
was based on the recommendation of at least four visits for medication evaluation, initiation,
and monitoring during the acute and continuation phases of panic disorder medication
treatment.24 The decision to require at least eight psychotherapy sessions was based on the
fact that clinical trials demonstrating efficacy have generally included at least eight
psychotherapy visits.24 As respondents who only began a course of treatment shortly before
the interview could not fulfill the requirements, we counted respondents with at least two visits
to an appropriate treatment sector if they were in treatment at the time of interview.

Analysis methods

Cross-tabulations were used to estimate prevalence and patterns of treatment. The actuarial
method26 was used to estimate AOO distributions. Mean comparisons were used to examine
illness course and severity-impairment. Logistic regression analysis27 was used to estimate
associations with socio-demographic variables and comorbid DSM-IV disorders. Because the
NCS-R sample design featured weighting and clustering, all analyses used the Taylor series
design-based method,28 implemented in the SUDAAN software system.29 Significance tests
of sets of coefficients in the logistic regression equations were made using Wald χ2 tests based
on design-corrected coefficient variance-covariance matrices. Statistical significance was
evaluated using two-sided design-based .05-level tests.

RESULTS

Prevalence

Page 5

Twenty-eight percent [28.3% (1.0)] of respondents (standard error in parentheses) met criteria
for lifetime panic attack and 11.2% (0.5) for 12-month PA, while 4.7% (0.3) of respondents
(roughly one-sixth of those with lifetime PA) met criteria for lifetime panic disorder and 2.8%
(0.2) for 12-month PD. Eight-tenths of one percent [ 0.8% (0.1)] of all respondents (roughly
3% of those with a lifetime PA) met criteria for lifetime PA with agoraphobia and 0.4% (0.1)
for 12-month PA with AG, while 1.1% (0.1) of respondents (approximately one-fifth of those
with lifetime PD and 60% of those with lifetime PA with AG) met criteria for lifetime PD with
AG and 0.4% (0.1) for 12-month PD and AG.

Course of illness

As described above, respondents with lifetime PA were divided into four mutually exclusive
subgroups (Figure 1): PA without PD and without AG (PA-only; 22.7% of the sample), PA
without PD but with AG (PA-AG; 0.8%), PD without AG (PD-only; 3.7%), and PD with AG
(PD-AG; 1.1%). A small proportion of respondents without PD (12.0% PA-only and 10.7%
PA-AG) reported a sufficient number of uncued attacks to quality for PD (with means of 31.0
and 131.4 lifetime uncued attacks), but failed to meet other requirements for a PD diagnosis.
(Table 1) The majority of respondents in three of the four subgroups, the exception being PD-
only, reported at least one cued lifetime attack (from a low of 67.9% PD-AG to a high of 87.6%
PA-AG). A significantly lower 46.8% of PD-only cases reported having any cued lifetime
attack. Mean number of cued attacks among those with any varies significantly across
subgroups (F3,1568 = 18.2, p < .001). PD is associated with a significantly higher mean number
of cued attacks than PA both among those without AG (121.8 vs. 38.3, z = 6.6, p < .001) and
those with AG (134.4 vs. 78.2, z = 2.1, p = .031). AG is associated with a significantly higher
mean number of cued attacks among those with PA (78.2 vs. 38.3, z = 2.4, p = .016) but not
among those with PD (134.4 vs. 121.8, z = 0.53, p = .60). In the sub-sample of respondents
who reported ever having a cued attack, the mean number of such attacks substantially exceeds
the mean number of uncued attacks both in the PD-only subgroup (121.8 vs. 31.3, z = 7.4, p
< .001) and in the PD-AG subgroup (134.4 vs. 46.0, z = 4.0, p < .001).

No meaningful difference exists in mean AOO of PA among the four subgroups (21.5–22.7;
F3,2188 = 0.9, p = .44). Indeed, the entire PA AOO distribution is very similar across these
subgroups. (Figure 2) Mean AOO of PD is only about one year later than mean AOO of PA
and does not differ significantly between the PD-only and PD-AG subgroups (23.6 vs. 22.9,
F3,1568 = 0.5, p = .62). Persistence (12-month prevalence of PA among lifetime cases), however,
varies substantially, from a low of 35.7% in PA-only to a high of 62.6% in PD-AG (χ2
3 = 48.7,
p < .001). Persistence is significantly higher in the PD than PA subgroups both in the absence
of AG (57.4% vs. 35.7%, z = 5.4, p < .001) and the presence of AG (62.6% vs. 41.1%, z = 3.0,
p = .002), but does not vary as a function of AG either in the two PA subgroups (41.1% vs.
35.7%, z = 0.9, p = .34) or in the two PD subgroups (62.6% vs. 57.4%, z = 0.9, p = .36). Mean
number of years with attacks also varies significantly across the subgroups (F3,2188 = 46.7, p
< .001) with the same rank ordering as persistence.

Socio-demographic correlates

We failed to find consistent variation in magnitude of significant socio-demographic correlates
of lifetime prevalence across the four subgroups, although the odds-ratios (OR’s) associated
with being female are noticeably higher for the PD than the PA subgroups, while the OR’s
associated with “other” employment status are noticeably higher for the AG than non-AG
subgroups. (Table 2) Age 60+ (versus younger ages) and Non-Hispanic Blacks (versus Non-
Hispanic Whites) have reduced odds of panic in all four subgroups, although not all are

significant. Women and previously married people have consistently elevated odds of panic
in all four subgroups. Respondents classified as having “other” employment status, made up
largely of the unemployed and disabled, have elevated odds of all outcomes other than PA-
only, while retired people have elevated odds of PD-AG but not the other three outcomes. None
of these associations is strong in substantive terms, though, with Pearson Contingency
Coefficients for the set of socio-demographic predictors in the range .01–.02 in the four
multivariate prediction equations.

Respondents in all four panic subgroups have significantly elevated odds of virtually all other
lifetime DSM-IV disorders assessed in the survey. (Table 3) One or more comorbid conditions
are found in 71.9% of PA-only, 83.1% of PD-only, and 100% of the other two subgroups. The
OR’s for particular comorbid conditions differ significantly across the four subgroups, with
the lowest OR’s consistently in PA-only. In the case of comorbidity with other anxiety disorders
and major depression, AG is more important than PD, as shown by the PA-AG OR’s (4.4–
24.0) consistently being higher than the PD-only OR’s (2.0–5.4) and often as high as the PD-
AG OR’s (2.5–25.8). In the case of the other mood disorders and alcohol use disorders, the
PA-AG OR’s (3.2–5.0) are comparable to the PD-only OR’s (3.5–5.4), while the PD-AG OR’s
(5.6–13.6) are considerably larger. A distinct pattern for drug use disorders is for the OR’s
associated with all three AG or PD subgroups to be comparable in magnitude (3.4–5.8).

Summary PDSS ratings of clinical severity vary significantly across the four 12-month panic
subgroups (χ2
3 = 34.3–102.9, p < .001), with the highest ratings in the PD-AG subgroup (86.3%
moderate or severe, 42.40% severe) and the lowest in the PA-only subgroup (6.7% moderate
or severe, 0.3% severe). (Table 4) Respondents in the PA-AG subgroup have higher PDSS
ratings (45.3% moderate or severe, 20.2% severe) than those in the PD-only subgroup (46.1%
moderate or severe, 6.0% severe).

Summary SDS ratings of role impairment are similar to PDSS ratings in being highest in the
PD-AG subgroup (95.0% moderate or severe, 84.7% severe) and lowest in the PA-only
subgroup (21.3% moderate or severe, 11.1% severe). Unlike PDSS ratings, though, the PA-
AG subgroup has lower SDS ratings (58.8% moderate or severe, 39.0% severe) than the PD-
only subgroup (76.8% moderate or severe, 56.2% severe), although the modal rating is severe
in all three subgroups other than PA-only. In the latter, the modal rating is no disability (70.6%).

The vast majority of PD cases obtained lifetime treatment for psychiatric problems, although
somewhat more so among those with AG (96.1%) than without (84.8%). (Table 5) Lifetime
treatment proportions are lower in the PA-AG (74.7%) and PA-only (61.1%) subgroups. The
proportions that obtained panic-specific treatment are only slightly lower than overall treatment
in the PD-only (70.3 vs. 84.8%) and PD-AG (85.0% vs. 96.1%) subgroups, but substantially
lower in the PA-only (16.2% vs. 61.1%) and PA-AG (37.6% vs. 74.7%) subgroups. The most
common site of treatment was the general medical sector in three of the four subgroups (32.3–
70.4%). The exception is PA-AG, where non-MD mental health treatment (46.1%) is slightly
more common than general medical treatment (42.7%).

As with lifetime treatment, the proportion of 12-month cases that received treatment in the year
before interview is highest in the PD-AG subgroup (72.6%), lowest in the PA-only subgroup
(45.7%), and intermediate in the PA-AG (60.8%) and PD-only (66.9%) subgroups. Also similar
to the lifetime treatment data, 12-month panic-specific treatment made up a higher proportion
of all treatment in the PD-only (43.9% vs. 66.9%) and PD-AG (52.7% vs. 72.6%) subgroups

than in the PA-only (14.7% vs. 45.7%) and PA-AG (29.7% vs. 60.8%) subgroups. Twelve-
month treatment was obtained in the general medical sector more often than in any other sector
in each of the four subgroups (25.5–46.0%). The proportion of 12-month cases that obtained
treatment consistent with basic treatment guidelines did not differ markedly across the three
subgroups with PD or AG (40.6–54.9%). Although treatment meeting basic guidelines was
received by a substantially lower proportion of patients in the PA-only subgroup (18.2%), it
is important to remember that published treatment guidelines apply to panic disorder and
agoraphobia, not to isolated panic attacks.

COMMENT

These results should be interpreted in light of several limitations. The response rate was only
70%. As described in more detail elsewhere,15 we assessed this problem in a non-respondent
survey where a sub-sample of initial non-respondents was offered a large financial incentive
($100) to complete a short (15-minute) telephone interview that included CIDI diagnostic stem
questions. No significant difference was found in panic stem question endorsement compared
to the main survey sample, indirectly arguing against large non-response bias on the basis of
panic. Second, although good concordance with SCID PD diagnoses was found, no validity
data were obtained for PA or AG. Third, information about AOO, persistence, and other
important course and treatment variables were obtained retrospectively that could be biased.
As described in more detail elsewhere,16 a number of strategies were used in the NCS-R to
reduce recall bias. Evidence exists that these strategies improved accuracy of retrospective
AOO reports,30 but we have no data about effects on other aspects of recall.

With these limitations as a backdrop, the NCS-R lifetime prevalence estimates of DSM-IV PD
and PD-AG (4.7%, 1.1%) are similar to the DSM-III-R estimates in the baseline NCS (3.5%,
1.5%). The NCS-R estimate of PD-only prevalence (3.7%) is substantially higher than in the
NCS (2.0%).2 Although higher than in earlier epidemiological surveys,31 the concordance of
the NCS-R PD prevalence estimate with an independent SCID estimate argues against upward
bias. In the case of AG, the concern is more with downward than upward bias based on the
fact that the CIDI requirement of anxiety about multiple situations is stricter than the DSM-IV
requirement.

Estimates of persistence, socio-demographic correlates, and psychiatric comorbidity are
broadly consistent with the baseline NCS1, 2, 32 and other previous epidemiological surveys,
14, 31, 33–35 although direct comparison is not possible because previous surveys did not
disaggregate panic into the four subgroups considered here. High prevalence among women,
low prevalence among the elderly, and strong comorbidity with other anxiety and mood
disorders are all noteworthy consistencies with previous surveys. One notable difference is a
much higher estimated lifetime prevalence of panic attacks in the NCS-R (28.3%) than the
NCS (7.3%), a discrepancy presumably due to the more detailed stem questions in the DSM-
IV version of the CIDI than in the DSM-III-R version that suggests panic attacks were
underestimated in the baseline NCS.

We are aware of no previous general population research that compared the prevalence and
correlates of isolated panic attacks versus panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. The
most striking results of this comparison are that isolated panic attacks are both quite common
and significantly comorbid with other DSM-IV disorders. These results are consistent with
clinical studies.36, 37 The vast majority of people with isolated panic attacks fail to meet PD
criteria because they never had recurrent uncued attacks, although they typically had numerous
cued attacks. Another notable subgroup results is that cued attacks are more common than
uncued attacks even among people with PD. This is especially striking given that probing often
uncovers initially unrecognized panic cues,38, 39 which means that the NCS-R probably

underestimates the proportion of attacks that are cued. We also found that persistence and
number of lifetime attacks are more strongly related to PD than AG, that comorbidity,
especially with other anxiety disorders, is more strongly related to AG than PD, and that isolated
panic attacks are associated with substantial role impairment when they occur in conjunction
with AG.

The subgroup results suggest that AG and PD are to some extent distinct, as about 40% of all
respondents with PA and AG never met criteria for PD. This finding is consistent with family
aggregation studies, which show that risk of AG is significantly elevated among relatives of
people with PA-AG43 and relatives of people with PD-AG compared to PD-only.39,40 Family
genetic studies also suggest that AG and PD may have at least some distinct pathogenic
mechanisms.41,42 At the same time, our finding of higher conditional prevalence of AG among
people with PD than PA is consistent with the strong association between AG and PD long
observed in clinical settings.

The subgroup results document monotonic increases from PA-only to PD-AG in number of
attacks, comorbidity, clinical severity, role impairment and treatment seeking, with
intermediate values for PA-AG and PD-only. Together with the finding that a high proportion
of AG is associated with PA, these results could be interpreted as suggesting that panic exists
along a continuum in which PA and PD differ in degree rather than in kind. This interpretation
is consistent with prior findings that infrequent, spontaneous panic attacks are common in the
general population,40, 41 that these attacks typically include fewer and less severe symptoms
than those of patients with PD,42 and that infrequent PA aggregates with PD in families.43,
44

The distinction between cued and uncued attacks might be called into question as part of this
same line of thinking based on the view that the vast majority of panic attacks are to some
extent cued.37, 45, 46 It would be premature to conclude from these results that the boundary
between PA and PD is arbitrary. Nevertheless, given the high prevalence of PA-only and the
negative outcomes associated with PA-only, future research might profitably attempt to subset
PA-only and evaluate whether diagnostic criteria or symptom thresholds for panic disorder
should be modified to improve differentiation between pathological and normal panic
experiences.

An innovation of the NCS-R was the use of a fully structured version of the PDSS to assess
clinical severity. Although lower than in clinical samples, close to 90% of respondents with
PD-AG and roughly 50% of those with PA-AG and PD-only were found to be in the clinically
significant range on the PDSS. A related finding is that both clinical severity assessed in the
PDSS and role impairment assessed in the SDS appear to be influenced nearly as much by
agoraphobia (PA-AG vs. PA-only) as panic disorder (PD-only vs. PA-only). This is consistent
with prior findings that AG is associated with panic severity, anticipatory anxiety, and cognitive
correlates of severity40, 47–49 and our finding that AG is more common among people with
PD than PA. Also consistent with this pattern is the higher average number of lifetime panic
attacks among respondents with versus without AG in both the PA and PD samples. One
possible interpretation of this pattern is that AG is a severity marker of panic, although this is
at least superficially inconsistent with the notion in the last paragraph that AG is distinct from
PD disorder. Another possibility is that AG has a direct effect on impairment.

The treatment results are consistent with previous NCS-R reports that most people with PD
eventually obtain treatment,23 that most active cases receive treatment in a given year,50 and
that most current treatment (45–60% across the three PD and-or AG subgroups) fails to meet
basic treatment guidelines.50 The latter result is all the more striking in that our definition of
treatment quality is liberal. For example, no distinction was made among psychotherapies

despite much more evidence for the effectiveness of some types of psychotherapy than others
in treating panic.51–53 Nor was a distinction made among antidepressants or anxiolytics
despite much more evidence for the effectiveness of some than others.54, 55 In interpreting
the finding that many patients fail to receive guideline-concordant treatment, it should be
recognized that some patients were so classified because they dropped out of treatment
prematurely rather than because treatment providers delivered inappropriate care. Both
problems need to be addressed in future practice-oriented research.
