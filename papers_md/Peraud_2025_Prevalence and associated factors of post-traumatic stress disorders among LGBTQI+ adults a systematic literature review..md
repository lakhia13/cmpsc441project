traumatic stress disorders among LGBTQI+ 
adults: a systematic literature review

Abstract
Background  LGBTQI+ individuals appear to be particularly at-risk of exposure to interpersonal violence. This leads to 
an increased risk of developing symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or Complex Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder (C-PTSD). The objectives of this systematic review is to: (1) Compile the prevalences of PTSD/C-PTSD among 
LGBTQI+ individuals; (2) Compare the symptomatology of PTSD/C-PTSD according to sexual orientation and gender 
identity; (3) Identify the factors involved in the symptomatology of PTSD/C-PTSD among LGBTQI+ individuals.

Methods  A systematic literature review was conducted on PTSD/C-PTSD among LGBTQI+ individuals. Psychinfo, 
Psycharticle, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Embase, and LGBTHealth databases were queried. Only 
quantitative, observational studies based on data collected after 2010 and involving LGBTQI+ adults were included. 
The risk of bias was assessed using the Control Guidelines Critical Appraisal Toolkit developed by the Public Health 
Agency of Canada.

Results  Out of the 7446 articles identified, 60 were included. Eighteen provided data on prevalence, and 57 on 
associated factors. The majority of studies were conducted in the United States. The vast majority of studies assessed 
PTSD using self-administered scales. Only one evaluated symptoms of C-PTSD. All included studies reported extremely 
high PTSD prevalence rates, with certain populations appearing particularly at risk, such as bisexual (10.3–35.7% PTSD) 
and transgender individuals (36.8–64.3% PTSD). Individual (e.g., financial precarity, transition, internalized stigma), 
interpersonal (e.g., outness, social support), organizational (e.g. health barriers), community (e.g. anti-trans discourse), 
and political variables (anti-trans laws project) associated with PTSD/C-PTSD symptoms have been identified.

Conclusions  The results show the importance of considering PTSD/C-PTSD among LGBTQI+ individuals 
in clinical practice and research. Higher quality studies are needed to quantify the extent of the problem. 
Healthcare professionals must be trained in the specific factors that may contribute to PTSD/C-PTSD symptoms in 
LGBTQI+ individuals. This cannot be achieved without public policies aimed at preventing all forms of violence against 
the LGBTQI+ population and ensuring access to equal rights.

SYSTEMATIC REVIEWOpen AccessPage 2 of 21

Background
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,1 Transgender,2 Queer,3 and Inter-
sex4  (LGBTQI+5)  individuals  constitute  a  significant 
portion  of  the  population.  According  to  a  recent  IPSOS 
survey  conducted  across  30  countries  in  2023,  9%  of 
respondents  identified  as  LGBTQI+  [1].  The  exact  pro-
portions  are  expected  to  vary  based  on  several  factors, 
including  geographical  and  generational  considerations. 
While  individuals  within  the  LGBTQI+  community 
share  the  commonality  of  not  conforming  to  hetero-
sexual  and  cisgender6  norms,  they  represent  a  diverse 
range  of  identities  and  experiences.  The  LGBTQI+ 
acronym  encompasses  matters  related  to  sexual  ori-
entation  (homosexuality,  bisexuality,  asexuality,7  etc.), 
romantic  orientation  (distinct  from  sexual  orientation, 
e.g.,  aromantic8),  gender  identity  (cisgender,  transgen-
der,  non-binary9),  bodily  characteristics  (intersexuality), 
and  gender  expression.10  Paradoxically,  psychological 
research  must  navigate  the  challenge  of  grouping  these 
identities  to  draw  general  conclusions  while  studying  a 
population  with  profoundly  diverse  and  specific  lived 
experiences.

Due  to  their  sexual  orientation  and/or  gender  iden-
tity,  LGBTQI+  individuals  may  face  specific  challenges, 
particularly  in  terms  of  violence.  These  experiences  can 
manifest  in  various  forms  and  span  a  wide  spectrum  of 
violence, including remarks or behaviors, often uninten-
tional,  that  demonstrate  a  lack  of  understanding  (e.g., 
misgendering,11  making  assumptions  about  the  person’s 

1  Individual capable of experiencing sexual attraction to more than one sex 
or gender.
2   Individual  who  does  not  identify  with  the  gender  assigned  to  them  at 
birth. Birth assignment refers to the gender assigned by the medical com-
munity based on the individual’s genital characteristics at birth.

heterosexual and cisgender norms. It may be used by individuals who pre-
fer not to define themselves within a more restrictive category.
4   Individuals  with  one  or  more  biological  sex  characteristic  that  are  not 
considered “typically male” or “typically female.”
5   The  “+”  signifies  the  non-exhaustiveness  of  the  acronym,  encompassing 
any gender identity or marginalized orientation.
6  Individual in alignment with the gender assigned to them at birth based 
on their genital organs. Birth assignment refers to the gender assigned by 
the  medical  community  at  the  time  of  birth  according  to  the  individual’s 
genital characteristics.
7 Person who does not experience or has minimal sexual attraction to any-
one.
8   Individual  who  does  not  experience  or  has  minimal  romantic  attraction 
to anyone.
9   Individual  who  is  neither  exclusively  male  nor  exclusively  female.  The 
experiences of non-binary individuals are encompassed within the broader 
category of transgender experiences.
10 Set  of  visible  and  tangible  characteristics  (body,  clothing,  makeup,  fra-
grance,  demeanor,  voice,  etc.)  presented  by  a  person.  Gender  expression

sufficient to determine a person’s gender.

sexual  orientation);  discrimination;  rejection  behaviors; 
verbal,  physical,  and  sexual  violence;  and  hate  crimes. 
These  forms  of  violence  can  occur  in  various  contexts, 
including  within  the  family  (e.g.,  parental  non-accep-
tance)  [2],  education  (e.g.,  school  bullying)  [3],  employ-
ment (e.g., discrimination in job access) [4], and daily life 
(e.g., insults, physical and sexual violence) [5]).

This  context  renders  this  population  particularly  vul-
nerable on a social level (isolation [6], precarity [7], bar-
riers to accessing healthcare [8] or social support [9]), as 
well as on the physical and mental health fronts [10–12]. 
This lived experience has been conceptualized under the 
term  minority  stress  [13].  However,  not  all  these  chal-
lenges are of the same nature within the LGBTQI+ com-
munity,  and  certain  groups,  such  as  gender  minorities, 
appear  to  be  particularly  vulnerable  today  [14].  To  date, 
scientific  literature  shows  the  overexposure  of  this  pop-
ulation  to  violence  [5,  15]  and  the  consequences  it  can 
have on their lives [3, 16]. Yet, the literature still remains 
sparse  on  one  of  the  key  factors  involved  in  post-trau-
matic symptomatology.

Exposure  to  a  potentially  traumatic  event,  specifically 
exposure  to  death  or  a  life-threatening  situation  (e.g. 
natural or human-made disaster, accident, assault…) con-
stitutes  the  gateway  to  the  development  of  PTSD  [17]. 
Certain  forms  of  exposure,  such  as  chronic  exposure 
to  interpersonal  violence  during  childhood,  which  may 
involve attachment figures, significantly increase the risk 
of  developing  post-traumatic  stress  symptoms  and  their 
severity [18–20]. In a study involving a sample of 34 000 
people  in  the  USA,  homosexual  and  bisexual  individu-
als  were  more  than  twice  as  likely  to  report  exposure  to 
childhood  maltreatment  compared  to  heterosexual  indi-
viduals [21]. Nevertheless, some authors support the idea 
that certain events, which do not involve life-threatening 
or  potentially  life-threatening  situations  but  involve  psy-
chological threats (e.g., bullying, cisheterosexism, racism), 
could also lead to traumatic symptomatology [22, 23].

To  date,  several  conceptualizations  of  PTSD  exist. 
DSM-5  considers  the  existence  of  a  single  disorder 
(PTSD), encompassing four symptom clusters: (1) Intru-
sions  (i.e.,  intrusive  memories,  nightmares,  dissociative 
reactions  related  to  the  event,  psychological  distress 
and physiological reactions upon exposure to reminders 
of  the  event);  (2)  Avoidance  (i.e.,  avoidance  of  memo-
ries,  thoughts,  feelings,  places,  people,  situations  that 
could  remind  one  of  the  event);  (3)  Negative  alterations 
in  cognitions  and  mood  (i.e.,  amnesia,  negative  beliefs 
and emotions, cognitive distortions, detachment, loss of 
interest,  and  inability  to  experience  positive  emotions); 
(4)  Alterations  in  arousal  and  reactivity  (i.e.,  irritability, 
self-destructive  behaviors,  hypervigilance,  exaggerated 
startle  response,  concentration  problems,  sleep  distur-
bances)  [17].  The  ICD-11,  on  the  other  hand,  proposes

two  distinct  disorders:  PTSD  and  C-PTSD.  C-PTSD 
consists  of  three  symptom  clusters  comprising  ICD-11 
PTSD (re-experiencing, avoidance, and a constant sense 
of  threat),  along  with  three  symptom  clusters  constitut-
ing  Disturbances  in  Self-Organization  (DSO;  emotional 
dysregulation,  negative  self-concept,  interpersonal  dif-
ficulties)  [18].  Independently  of  the  classification,  post-
traumatic  stress  symptoms  can  lead  to  significant  and 
persistent  difficulties  in  one  or  more  areas  of  life  (rela-
tional, professional, personal). Identifying and addressing 
individuals  suffering  from  these  disorders  is  therefore  a 
significant health concern.

The  results  of  a  single  recent  meta-analysis  show  a 
notably  higher  risk  of  LGBTQI+  individuals  reporting 
PTSD  compared  to  cisgender  and  heterosexual  indi-
viduals  [24].  However,  this  meta-analysis  is  limited  to 
studies including a control group consisting of hetero-
sexual and cisgender individuals, thus excluding a con-
siderable  number  of  existing  studies  to  date  and  does 
not delve into factors that could explain the symptom-
atology. The objectives of this systematic review were as 
follows:

1.  Compile the prevalences of PTSD/C-PTSD among 
LGBTQI+ individuals reported in the scientific 
literature.

2.  Compare the symptomatology of PTSD/C-PTSD 

according to sexual orientation and gender identity.
3.  Identify the factors associated in the symptomatology 

of PTSD/C-PTSD among LGBTQI+ individuals.

Based  on  the  existing  literature,  we  hypothesized  that 
LGBTQIA + individuals  would  report  higher  PTSD/C-
PTSD prevalence rates in the included studies compared 
to those typically observed in the general population. We 
also hypothesized that certain subgroups, such as gender 
minorities,  would  show  particularly  elevated  prevalence 
rates. Finally, we expected that the factors contributing to 
PTSD/C-PTSD symptoms would operate at multiple lev-
els, both individual and societal.

Methods
Eligibility criteria (PICOTS)

Prisma  [25]  and  INESS  [26]  guidelines  were  followed 
throughout the present review. The review were not reg-
istered in Prospero.

Population:  Studies  involving  adults  (≥ 18  years  old) 
identifying  as  sexual  and/or  gender  minorities  were 
considered.  Studies  specifically  focusing  on  populations 
exposed to trauma due to their profession (e.g., war vet-
erans), physical condition (e.g., HIV), or life experiences 
(e.g.,  migratory  history)  were  excluded.  For  prevalence 
data,  only  studies  involving  a  general  LGBTQI+ popula-
tion, were included.

Intervention:  Only  observational  studies  were  consid-

ered. All interventional studies were excluded.

Group comparison: All studies, with or without a con-
trol group, were included. This included studies compar-
ing LGBTQI+ subgroups with each other or with groups 
consisting of cisgender or heterosexual individuals.

Outcome:  Only  studies  using  validated  measurement 
tools  to  assess  PTSD  or  C-PTSD,  based  on  full  DSM  or 
ICD  symptom  criteria,  were  considered.  Results  were 
considered if they provided insights into:

1.  The prevalence of PTSD/C-PTSD within the 

LGBTQI+ population.

2.  The symptomatology of PTSD according to sexual 

orientation and/or gender identity.

3.  Factors associated with PTSD/C-PTSD symptoms 

within the LGBTQI+ population.

For prevalence, studies were included if the diagnosis was 
based on full symptoms criteria or a cut-off criterion.

Temporality:  This  criterion  is  not  restrictive.  Cross-
sectional  and  longitudinal  studies  were  considered  with 
equal interest.

Settings:  Only  quantitative  studies  were  considered. 
Qualitative  studies  were  excluded,  and  in  the  case  of 
mixed-methods studies, only the quantitative results were 
considered. This review was limited to peer-reviewed arti-
cles in English and French due to the languages spoken by 
the authors, published in indexed scientific journals. Due 
to the evolving living conditions of LGBTQI+ individuals 
over recent decades and changes in PTSD classifications, 
studies  based  on  data  collected  before  2010  were  not 
considered  in  order  to  focus  solely  on  the  most  current 
publications.  Conference  abstracts,  literature  reviews, 
academic dissertations, and case studies were excluded.

Sources of information

The following databases were queried: Psychinfo, Psychar-
ticle,  Psychology  and  Behavioral  Sciences  Collection, 
Embase,  and  LGBTHealth.  The  search  was  initiated  on 
October 28, 2021, and the last update was conducted on 
January  16,  2023.  The  first  author  (WP)  conducted  all 
database searches.

Search algorithm

The  keywords  related  to  sexual  orientation  or  gender 
identity used in this review are those proposed in a sys-
tematic review identifying various terminologies used in 
LGBTQI+ research [27]. The table summarizing the key-
words used is available in the supplementary material.

Study selection

All  articles  were  recorded  on  Zotero  [28].  Duplicate 
articles  were  removed  using  the  software.  The  title  and 

Peraud Berthelot et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:3644 Page 4 of 21

abstract of each article were assessed, and those that did 
not  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  were  excluded.  WP  was 
responsible for the initial screening. In case of uncertainty, 
articles were retained for a full read. A second screening 
based on full articles was independently conducted by WP 
and HF on 30 common references. WP was then respon-
sible for the entire initial screening (n = 138). In cases of 
doubt or disagreement, meetings were held involving WP, 
HF,  MH,  and  BQ.  Studies  were  excluded  if  they  did  not 
meet the defined criteria in terms of population (e.g., age 
below 18 years, not focused on LGBTQI+ individuals, or 
data  did  not  allow  distinguishing  LGBTQI+  individuals 
from the rest of the sample), study design (e.g., academic 
dissertation, qualitative study), or outcome (e.g., lack of a 
measurement scale for PTSD/C-PTSD) (Fig. 1).

Data items and collection process

The  extraction  of  information  from  the  selected  studies 
was based on the recommendations of INESSS [26]. For 

each  article,  information  about  participant  characteris-
tics  (sample  size,  age  range,  gender  identity,  sexual  ori-
entation), location, design, methods used (measurement 
tool, data analysis), outcomes, and strengths and limita-
tions  were  systematically  noted. These  data  were  manu-
ally identified in each study and noted on a spreadsheet. 
All  articles  in  which  the  researchers  had  doubts  about 
their  inclusion  were  discussed  in  a  committee  approach 
with BQ until a consensus was reached.

Summary strategy

As  the  selected  studies  showed  clinical  heterogeneity  in 
terms  of  settings  (sample  size,  participants  characteris-
tics),  study  design,  methods  (measurement  tools,  data 
analysis), it was impractical to run a quantitative analysis 
for meta-review. However, we have synthesized the main 
data  from  each  study  in  tables  constructed  from  those 
proposed  by  the  Public  Health  Agency  of  Canada  [29] 
and the INESS Guidelines [26].

Risk of bias

The Control Guidelines Critical Appraisal Toolkit (devel-
oped  by  the  Public  Health  Agency  of  Canada  [29])  was 
utilized  to  assess  the  quality  of  each  quantitative  study 
and  assign  a  specific  grade.  The  first  author  (WP)  was 
responsible for the evaluation of study quality. The qual-
ity of a study was considered high if it received high rat-
ings  on  most  criteria  (sample,  data  collection  method, 
measurement  tools,  ethics,  statistics),  and  no  elements 
were rated as low. The quality of a study was considered 
moderate if the data collection method or statistics used 
were considered moderate, and other items rated as weak 
or  moderate  were  insufficient  to  compromise  ability  to 
draw  conclusions  regarding  a  possible  association.  The 
quality  of  a  study  was  considered  low  if  the  data  collec-
tion method or statistics used were considered low inde-
pendently of other aspects (e.g., wide confidence interval, 
inadequate  statistical  power),  or  if  all  criteria  compro-
mised the internal validity of the study.

Results
Study selection and description

The final selection of studies for this review included 60 
studies.  The  results  are  summarized  in  supplementary 
material.  The  review  included  only  quantitative  studies, 
mostly retrospective (n = 53), while seven were of a longi-
tudinal nature. The vast majority of studies took place in 
the United States (n = 51), Canada (n = 4), or on the North 
American continent (n = 2). Two studies were conducted 
in Europe, in Ireland and Spain specifically. One was car-
ried out in Kenya.

Most studies used a variant of the PCL (PCL C, PCL S, 
PCL 5; n = 33) [30, 31], while others used the PC-PTSD 
(n  =  11)  [32,  33].  Occasionally,  some  other  tools  were 
used, such as AUDADIS (n = 2) [34, 35], DTS (n = 2) [36], 
IES-R (n = 3) [37], PDS (n = 3) [38], SCID-IV (n = 2) [39], 
TSC-40 (n = 2) [40], Short Screening Scale for DSM IV (n 
= 1) [41], or ITQ (n = 1) [42].

In  total,  31,943  LGBTQI+ participants  were  included 
in  all  studies.  From  articles  providing  age  information 
(n = 43), the average age of participants was 29.18 years.

The  populations  recruited  in  different  studies  were 
highly diverse, illustrating the complexity of research on 
sexual and gender minorities. Some focused on individu-
als  with  a  specific  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity 
(e.g.,  bisexual  individuals,  transgender  individuals),  oth-
ers concentrated on a specific gender within the spectrum 
of  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity  (e.g.,  gay  men, 
transgender  women),  and  others  grouped  individuals 
based  on  their  sexual  orientation  (LGB  individuals;  gay 
individuals), gender identity (transgender individuals), or 
more broadly, their affiliation with the LGBTQI+ commu-
nity.  This  information  is  systematically  presented  in  the 
descriptive table (see supplementary material).

Some  heterogeneity  in  terms  of  quality  was  observed 
in the included studies. Eleven were considered to be of 
high quality, 42 of moderate quality, and 7 of low quality 
(see supplementary material).

Prevalence of PTSD/C-PTSD
Prevalence according to sexual orientation

Among  the  18  included  studies  presenting  prevalence 
rates, 9 reported PTSD prevalence among sexual minori-
ties, with one reporting PTSD/C-PTSD (ICD-11) preva-
lence. Three studies reported prevalence among gay and 
bisexual men. The reported prevalences among gay men 
were  6.2%  for  PTSD  [43],  5.3%  for  PTSD,  and  10.7%  for 
C-PTSD (16% cumulative PTSD and C-PTSD; [44]). The 
only  prevalence  reported  specifically  among  bisexual 
men  was  10.3%  for  PTSD  [43].  However,  a  study  con-
ducted  in  Western  Kenya  among  gay  and  bisexual  men 
showed a significantly higher prevalence of PTSD (52.4%; 
[45]).  Contextual  and  cultural  factors  likely  explain  this 
higher prevalence and they will be discussed further.

Five  studies  reported  prevalences  among  lesbian  and 
bisexual  women.  The  reported  prevalences  among  les-
bian  women  were  7.4%  for  PTSD  [43],  11.4%  for  PTSD, 
and  25.7%  for  C-PTSD  (37.1%  cumulative  PTSD  and 
C-PTSD;  [44]).  The  only  reported  prevalence  among 
bisexual  women  was  21%  for  PTSD  [43].  Three  studies 
focused  on  samples  composed  of  lesbian  and  bisexual 
women and mentioned prevalences ranging from 15.43% 
[46]  and  22.9%  [47]  to  50.4%  for  PTSD  [45].  However, 
the latter study is distinct due to its sample recruited in 
Western  Kenya.  Lastly,  one  study,  using  a  similar  data-
base  to  Evans-Polce  et  al.  [43],  reported  prevalences  for 
individuals questioning their sexual orientation or engag-
ing  in  non-heterosexual  practices,  even  if  they  identi-
fied  as  heterosexual.  The  reported  PTSD  prevalences 
were 4.2% and 8.9% for discordant heterosexual men and 
women, and 11.5% and 15.3% for men and women ques-
tioning their sexual orientation [48].

Five  studies  reported  prevalences  among 

lesbian, 
gay,  and  bisexual  individuals  regardless  of  gender.  The 
majority focused on samples of bisexual individuals. The 
reported  prevalences  of  PTSD  varied  between  15.5% 
(population  aged  over  25  years;  [49]),  35.7%  [50],  and 
47.62%  (including  transgender  individuals;  [51]).  One 
study,  based  on  ICD-11  criteria,  reported  a  prevalence 
of 3.4% for PTSD and 23.9% for C-PTSD (27.3% cumula-
tive;  [44]). This  same  study  also  reported  prevalences  in 
a  group  of  pansexual,  asexual,  and  other  sexual  minor-
ity  individuals  of  7.1%  for  PTSD  and  30.8%  for  C-PTSD 
(37.9%  cumulative;  [44]).  Finally,  a  study  focusing  on 
South Asian American LGB + individuals reported a sig-
nificantly  higher  prevalence  of  PTSD  (61.3%;  [52]).  This 
result will be discussed further.

study according to sexual orientation.

Comparison between sexual minorities and heterosexual 
individuals

Prevalence according to gender identity

Among  the  14  included  studies,  9  reported  prevalences 
of PTSD among gender minorities, with only one assess-
ing PTSD/C-PTSD (ICD-11; [44]). Most studies grouped 
gender  minorities  without  distinguishing  their  gender 
identity in the analyses (n = 8) [44, 45, 53–58], while one 
focused  on  a  population  of  transgender  or  non-binary 
individuals  assigned  male  at  birth  [59].  Reported  preva-
lences ranged between 36.8% and 64.3%, with the major-
ity  falling  between 36.8% and 46.6% for  PTSD  (6/9) [44, 
54–58].  One  study  using  the  diagnostic  criteria  of  ICD-
11 reported a prevalence of 9.6% for PTSD and 31.9% for 
C-PTSD (41.5% combined) [44]. The study that reported 
the highest prevalence focused on a sample recruited in 
Western  Kenya  (64%  PTSD)  [45],  while  the  second  one 
involved a sample of 155 transgender individuals, mostly 
assigned female at birth (62.6% PTSD) [53].

Figure 3 summarizes the reported prevalences in each 

study, according to gender identity.

Comparisons of traumatic symptomatology based on 
sexual orientation or gender identity

Twenty-six  studies  explored  whether  traumatic  symp-
tomatology can vary based on reported sexual orientation 
or gender identity within samples exposed to potentially 
traumatic events [43, 45, 46, 52, 56, 57, 59–78].

Fourteen  studies  compared  a  sample  of  sexual  minorities 
with  heterosexual  individuals.  Eight  of  them  showed  that 
lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals reported more PTSD 
symptoms than heterosexual individuals [52, 62, 64, 72, 74, 
76,  77,  79].  One  study  showed  stronger  symptomatology 
among lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals in the sample 
but  without  observing  differences  in  terms  of  prevalence 
[70].  Three  studies  showed  results  that  varied  depending 
on sexual orientation or gender. For example, the study by 
Evans-Polce  et  al.  [43]  showed  that  sexual  minorities  (gay 
and bisexual men, bisexual women) reported higher PTSD 
symptoms than heterosexuals, except for lesbian women. In 
contrast, Kammer-Kerwick et al. [66] showed that gay and 
lesbian  individuals  reported  more  PTSD  symptoms  than 
heterosexual individuals, but these results did not appear in 
bisexual or pansexual individuals, or asexual and other sex-
ual orientations in the sample. In the study by Warren et al. 
[78], the difference in symptomatology was significant only 
for lesbian and bisexual women, not gay and bisexual men. 
Finally, two studies showed no differences between LGBTQ 
+ individuals and heterosexual individuals [60, 67].

Comparison between gender minorities and cisgender 
individuals

Four  studies  compared  a  sample  of  gender  minorities 
with  cisgender  individuals.  Three  showed  that  gen-
der  minorities  reported  more  symptoms  of  PTSD  than

cisgender  individuals  [61,  71,  73].  Two  of  them  focused 
on  an  undifferentiated  sample  of  transgender  and  non-
binary  individuals  [71,  73],  and  the  third  distinguished 
between  non-binary  individuals,  transgender  women, 
transgender men, and individuals reporting another gen-
der identity, all of whom reported more PTSD symptoms 
than cisgender men [61]. Only one study did not demon-
strate  differences  in  terms  of  PTSD  symptoms  in  trans-
gender  and  gender  diverse  individuals  compared  to  a 
group of cisgender and heterosexual men [66].

Factors associated with PTSD symptoms

Figure  4  summarizes  all  of  the  factors  identified  in  the 
literature.

Individual level
Sociodemographic variables
Age  Many studies (n = 15) took the age of LGBTQI+ indi-
viduals recruited in their analyses into account. The major-
ity (n = 10) did not show significant associations between 
participants’  age  and  traumatic  symptomatology  [46,  50, 
56, 59, 63, 80–84], whereas some studies found that young 
adults  represented  a  vulnerable  population  within  the 
community (n = 5) [49, 57, 61, 65, 85]. One study among 
men  who  have  sex  with  men  (MSM)  found  the  opposite 
trend, with young adults being less likely to report PTSD 
than  their  older  counterparts.  However,  this  difference 
was not observed in terms of lifetime prevalence [86].

Education  Among studies that considered participants’ 
education  levels  (n  =  9),  five  studies,  mainly  focusing 
on  transgender  populations,  did  not  show  a  signifi-
cant  association  with  PTSD  symptoms  [56,  57,  59,  61, 

66]. The results of the remaining studies (n = 4) among 
sexual and gender minorities indicated a negative asso-
ciation  between  a  higher  level  of  education  and  PTSD 
symptoms [46, 50, 65, 87].

Race  &  Ethnicity  Ten  studies  considered  race  and 
ethnicity in their analyses. The majority (n = 6) did not 
show a significant association between race or ethnicity 
and PTSD symptoms [50, 56, 57, 65, 82, 88]. The other 
four studies, all among sexual minorities, did show asso-
ciations, but they involved different races or ethnicities. 
One, focusing on an MSM sample, found that Hispanic 
or  Latino  individuals  reported  more  PTSD  symptoms 
than non-Hispanic Black individuals [89]. The second, in 
a sample of bisexual women, showed that Black bisexual 
women  reported  more  symptoms  than  other  bisexual 
women [74]. The third study showed a tendency where, 
compared  to  non-White  individuals,  White  individu-
als  reported  fewer  PTSD  symptoms  only  in  the  intru-
sion  cluster,  not  in  terms  of  overall  symptomatology 
[68].  Finally,  the  fourth  study,  with  an  sexual  minority 
women sample, showed that Asian-American individu-
als reported fewer PTSD symptoms than White individ-
uals. However, it did not find differences between White, 
African American, and Latino American sexual minority 
women [90].

Financial stability  With financial security being a par-
ticular concern in the LGBTQI+ community, many stud-
ies (n = 10) considered the level of financial precarity in 
their  analyses.  The  conceptualization  of  financial  pre-
carity  varied  across  studies  (poverty  threshold,  annual 
income,  access  to  social  assistance,  perceived  financial

situation,  food  insecurity,  etc.).  Most  studies  (n  =  7) 
showed  a  positive  association  between  precarity  and 
PTSD symptoms [50, 56, 59, 65, 82, 85, 91].

among MSM did not find a link between housing insta-
bility and PTSD symptoms [82].

Three  additional  studies  considered  housing  stability 
in  their  analyses.  Two  studies  among  transgender  indi-
viduals  showed  that  housing  instability  was  associated 
with increased PTSD symptoms [56, 57]. Finally, a study 

Employment  Two  studies  explored  employment  sta-
tus  and  its  associations  with  PTSD  symptoms  among 
LGBTQI+ individuals. The first study, which focused on 
a sample of transgender individuals, showed that unem-

Page 9 of 21

ployed individuals reported more PTSD symptoms than 
those  who  were  employed  [56].  However,  these  findings 
are  contrasted  by  the  study  conducted  by  Landes  et  al. 
[46] among lesbian and bisexual women, which stands out 
due  to  its  longitudinal  design.  This  study  demonstrated 
that the time spent employed in the last 24 months was 
not associated with PTSD symptoms.

Transition  Three studies, specifically focusing on trans-
gender  populations,  explored  issues  related  to  the  tran-
sition  process  in  their  analyses.  These  analyses  mostly 
covered  different  aspects  of  the  transition  process.  One 
study showed that transgender individuals who had under-
gone medical transition (hormones or surgery) reported 
fewer  PTSD  symptoms  than  those  who  had  not  under-
gone  a  medical  transition  [57].  However,  these  findings 
are  contradicted  by  the  study  conducted  by  Peitzmeier 
et  al.  [59],  which  did  not  observe  differences  in  symp-
tomatology  between  transgender  women  with  access  to 
hormone  therapy  and  transgender  women  who  had  not 
undergone  hormone  therapy.  Another  study  found  that 
individuals who had experienced interactions where their 
gender  identity  was  not  respected  due  to  their  appear-
ance reported more PTSD symptoms [54]. These results 
align  with  those  observed  by  Reisner  et  al.  [57],  where 
transgender  individuals  who  reported  that  their  trans-
gender identity was visible to others also reported more 
PTSD symptoms. Surprisingly, these same authors found 
that undergoing social transition (living full-time in one’s 
gender identity) was associated with an increase in PTSD 
symptoms. These results are discussed further ahead.

Adversities
Characteristics  of  violence  Three  studies  investigated 
the characteristics of traumatic events. One study among 
LGBTQ  individuals  emphasized  that,  for  lesbian  and 
bisexual women in the sample, being sexually assaulted by 
one or more women was associated with increased symp-
toms compared to those assaulted only by men. This find-
ing was not demonstrated among heterosexual women in 
the sample [69]. Another study among LGBTQ individu-
als showed that the time elapsed since the last experience 
of interpersonal violence was associated with a reduction 
in PTSD symptoms [87]. Finally, a study among racialized 
MSM  who  were  sexually  abused  during  childhood  did 
not demonstrate a link between the age of first abuse and 
PTSD symptoms [89].

Prejudice, stigmatization, discrimination  Nine studies 
explored  the  consequences  of  experiences  of  prejudices, 
stigmatization, and discrimination in terms of traumatic 
symptomatology.  These  experiences  varied  in  nature 
depending on the measurement tools used, ranging from 
stigmatizing  remarks  to  violent  behaviors,  but  were  all 

related to the victim’s sexual orientation or gender iden-
tity. All studies (n = 9) showed a link between experienc-
ing anti-LGBTQI+ behaviors and an increase in traumatic 
symptomatology  [50,  51,  56,  57,  92–96].  Some  studies 
showed  interesting  nuances.  For  example,  for  bisexual 
individuals  recruited  in  the  study  by  Arnett  et  al.  [92], 
experiencing  anti-bisexual  attitudes  had  an  impact  on 
PTSD symptoms only if it came from heterosexual indi-
viduals, not from lesbian or gay individuals.

Perceptions and cognitions
Internalized  Stigma  The  internalization  of  stigmatiz-
ing  remarks  and  behaviors  regarding  sexual  orientation 
or gender identity in the LGBTQI+ community has been 
well-identified  in  the  literature.  Several  studies  explored 
the  link  between  this  internalized  stigma  and  traumatic 
symptomatology (n = 9). The studies are heterogeneous, 
both  in  their  populations  and  the  measurement  tools 
used  (internalized  homophobia/biphobia/transphobia, 
internalized heterosexism, non-acceptance of one’s sexual 
orientation or gender identity, fear of being negatively per-
ceived). Five studies showed that reporting signs of inter-
nalized stigma was associated with an increase in PTSD 
symptoms.  This  observation  was  found  in  the  bisexual 
population  [92],  sexual  minority  women  [85,  94],  trans-
gender individuals [54], and the broader LGBTQI+ popu-
lation [71]. A study by Stenersen et al. [87] showed more 
nuanced results. The authors emphasized that expecting 
not to be accepted because of sexual orientation or gender 
identity was associated with an increase in PTSD symp-
toms. At the same time, if the authors did not observe an 
association between PTSD symptoms and the desire not 
to be LGBTQI+, experiencing a difficult acceptance pro-
cess  of  one’s  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity  could 
be associated with more PTSD symptoms. Another study 
showed  a  link  between  internalized  homophobia  and 
PTSD in a sample of sexual and gender minority individu-
als who were victims of sexual abuse, but not in another 
sample of individuals who were victims of intimate partner 
violence [75]. Two additional studies did not demonstrate 
a link between self-acceptance and PTSD [56, 95]. Finally, 
some  studies  explored  the  mediating  role  that  internal-
ized stigma can play in certain associations with PTSD. In 
Barr and colleagues’ study [54], for example, internalized 
transphobia  explained  the  relationship  between  experi-
encing discrimination or transmisogyny and an increase 
in  PTSD  symptoms.  However,  this  mediating  role  was 
not found in the longitudinal study by Dworkin et al. [94], 
where internalized heterosexism did not mediate the rela-
tionship between experiencing heterosexist behaviors and 
PTSD symptoms.

Shame  One study investigated the link between feelings of 
shame and traumatic symptomatology. It is noteworthy that 

Peraud Berthelot et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:3644 Page 10 of 21

in this study involving sexual minority women, the authors 
examined  the  general  sense  of  shame  rather  than  specifi-
cally  in  connection  with  trauma.  While  the  authors  did 
not observe a link between shame-related cognitions (i.e., 
thinking  one  is  bad  or  worthless)  and  PTSD,  they  found 
that behaviors in response to feelings of shame (i.e., avoid-
ing people or situations) explained the relationship between 
internalized heterosexism and PTSD symptoms [85].

Post-traumatic perceptions and cognitions  A few stud-
ies examined individuals’ perceptions of the trauma they 
had experienced (n = 2). One study, focusing on a sample 
of 245 bisexual individuals reporting events constituting 
rape, showed that individuals who were aware that it was 
rape reported more PTSD symptoms than those who did 
not define what they experienced as rape [97]. The second 
study found that individuals who connected their trauma 
to  discrimination  reported  more  PTSD  symptoms  than 
those who did not link this event to their sexual orienta-
tion or gender identity [95].

Other studies examined post-traumatic cognitions (n = 
2), which are certain negative beliefs or feelings that indi-
viduals  who  have  been  exposed  to  violence  may  report. 
Both studies focused solely on sexual minorities. A study 
by  Newins  et  al.  [67]  showed  a  positive  relationship 
between feeling distressed when others are in control and 
PTSD  symptoms,  which  appeared  stronger  in  LGBTQ 
individuals  than  in  heterosexual  individuals.  The  sec-
ond  longitudinal  study  found  a  significant  link  between 
post-traumatic cognitions and PTSD symptoms reported 
one year later. Additionally, the authors highlighted that 
experiencing  heterosexist  events  seemed  to  be  tempo-
rally  linked  to  the  severity  of  PTSD  symptoms  through 
the negative beliefs about oneself it engenders [94].

Behaviors
Adaptation strategies
Coping  strategies  Several  studies  have  examined  the 
link  between  coping  strategies  and  symptoms  of  PTSD 
(n = 6). Results varied depending on the panel of coping 
strategies evaluated. Two studies, both focusing on sexual 
minorities, demonstrated that individuals who consumed 
substances to cope with their thoughts or feelings reported 
more PTSD symptoms [81, 93]. One of these studies delved 
into this association and showed that experiences of het-
erosexist events led to the deployment of coping strategies 
oriented towards substance use, which exacerbated PTSD 
symptoms  [93].  These  authors  made  the  same  observa-
tion with other coping strategies in the face of heterosex-
ist  discrimination,  such  as  internalization  behaviors  (i.e., 
wondering if it’s their fault) or detachment (i.e., avoiding 
talking about it with others). Stenersen et al. [87] observed 
that  LGBTQI+  individuals  with  help-seeking  behaviors 

tended  to  report  lower  traumatic  symptomatology,  thus 
constituting a protective factor. They also noted a positive 
association  between  behaviors  of  concealing  one’s  sexual 
orientation or gender identity and the presence of PTSD 
symptoms.  Other  authors  considered  coping  strategies 
oriented towards anger regulation and observed nuanced 
results [98]. While the repression of anger was positively 
associated with PTSD symptoms in gay men and lesbian 
women, the expression of anger was positively associated 
with PTSD symptoms only in gay men. Having to conceal 
one’s  sexual  orientation  led  gay  men  and  lesbian  women 
to suppress their anger, thereby exacerbating their PTSD 
symptoms. Finally, three studies did not demonstrate a link 
between coping strategies and traumatic symptomatology. 
The coping strategies involved were problem-solving strat-
egies  [82],  religion-focused  strategies  [98],  and  strategies 
focused on vigilance towards heterosexual individuals [44].

Hypervigilance  One  study  investigated  hypervigilance 
behaviors. Note that while hypervigilance is a symptom of 
PTSD, the authors here focused on the contexts in which 
this  hypervigilance  could  form,  as  well  as  the  hypervigi-
lance behaviors employed. They observed that only hyper-
vigilance towards strangers predicted an increase in PTSD 
symptoms,  which  was  not  the  case  for  hypervigilance 
towards religious individuals or in the workplace. Among 
the measured hypervigilance behaviors, social withdrawal 
and  scanning  predicted  an  increase  in  PTSD  symptoms, 
but not concealing one’s LGBTQ + identity [71].

Health behaviors
Physical  Activity  Only  one  study  explored  the  link 
between sports participation and PTSD symptoms among 
sexual  minorities,  and  it  showed  contrasting  results. 
While  engaging  in  sports  was  positively  associated  with 
PTSD  symptoms  in  lesbian  women,  no  such  link  was 
demonstrated in gay men [98].

Substance  Use  Substance  use  is  a  behavior  frequently 
reported among individuals exposed to violence. While it 
can  sometimes  be  a  coping  strategy,  we  have  chosen  to 
distinguish  the  following  studies  due  to  their  methodol-
ogy, which did not allow for an evaluation of whether this 
behavior was perceived by individuals as a response to the 
difficulties they faced. Methodologies varied among stud-
ies, with some covering a range of drugs, while others were 
more specific (alcohol, tobacco, methamphetamines).

For studies that did not specify the type of drug, results 
seem  mixed.  Two  studies  showed  a  positive  association 
between polydrug use and PTSD symptoms, whether in 
a sample of young MSM [88] or transgender individuals 
[57]. In contrast, two other studies did not show associa-
tions with traumatic symptomatology [89, 99].

Peraud Berthelot et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:3644 Page 11 of 21

Regarding  studies  targeting  specific  substances,  the 
majority focused on alcohol consumption (n = 9). Opera-
tionalization  varied,  ranging  from  the  number  of  drinks 
reported  to  signs  of  an  alcohol  use  disorder.  Most  stud-
ies (n = 5) showed a link between high alcohol consump-
tion and PTSD symptoms [43, 63, 80, 96, 100]. One study 
particularly  emphasized  that  sexual  minorities  reported 
more  alcohol  use  disorders  comorbid  with  PTSD  symp-
toms  over  the  past  year  than  heterosexual  individuals 
[43]. In contrast, four studies did not demonstrate a link 
between  alcohol  consumption  and  traumatic  symptom-
atology [47, 81, 89, 98].

Two studies explored tobacco use in relation to PTSD 
symptoms.  One  of  them  did  not  show  a  link  between 
tobacco  consumption  and  traumatic  symptomatology  in 
homosexual  individuals  [98].  The  other,  in  a  sample  of 
lesbian, bisexual, and gay individuals, showed that com-
pared  to  heterosexual  individuals,  only  bisexual  indi-
viduals more frequently reported a tobacco use disorder 
comorbid with PTSD [43].

Finally,  only  one  study  explored  crystal  methamphet-
amine  use  in  relation  to  traumatic  symptomatology  and 
did  not  demonstrate  a  correlation  in  a  sample  of  MSM 
who experienced childhood sexual abuse [82].

Sexual  Practices  Some  studies  have  focused  on  risky 
sexual  behaviors  in  relation  to  PTSD  symptoms  (n  =  5). 
Most did not show an association with traumatic symp-
tomatology, whether in terms of unprotected sex in racial-
ized  MSM  [89]  and  transgender  individuals  [82],  or  in 
terms of sex work in transgender women [59]. One study 
demonstrated  more  nuanced  results  in  a  transgender 
population, with no link between seroadaptive behaviors 
(i.e., discussing less risky sexual behavior with a partner) 
but a negative association between PrEP12 use and PTSD 
symptoms in the past week [82]. Finally, a study of gay and 
bisexual men showed, in a network analysis, that specific 
PTSD  symptoms  (avoidance  of  thoughts  and  feelings) 
were associated with risky sexual behaviors. The authors 
noted  that  the  group  least  prone  to  risky  sexual  behav-
iors reported the greatest association with hypervigilance 
symptoms. The authors hypothesized that, in the absence 
of avoidance symptoms, this hypervigilance could be pro-
tective against risky behaviors [102].

Health status
Somatic  Health  Three  studies  considered  indicators  of 
somatic health in their analyses. One examined the rela-
tionship  between  Body  Mass  Index  and  symptoms  of 
PTSD in young lesbian and bisexual women and found no

retroviral (ARV) drugs by people who do not have HIV infection in order to

association  [80].  A  second  study  looked  at  self-reported 
sleep  duration  over  the  past  week  and  demonstrated  a 
negative association with PTSD symptoms only in lesbian 
women and not in gay men [98]. Finally, a study focused 
on  physical  health  in  bisexual  individuals  and  found  a 
negative  association  between  physical  health  status  and 
PTSD  symptoms.  Poor  health  status  (physical  function-
ing, health-related relational limitations, pain) was associ-
ated with higher traumatic symptomatology [92].

Mental  Health  Fifteen  studies  explored  the  associa-
tion between mental health variables and the presence of 
PTSD  symptoms.  The  majority  of  these  studies  focused 
on  the  relationship  between  depression  and  PTSD  (n  = 
15).  Almost  all  of  them  (n  =  14)  showed  a  positive  link 
between depression and PTSD [46, 47, 57, 63, 71, 82–84, 
88,  89,  92,  96,  99,  102].  Only  one  study,  focusing  on  a 
sample of 19 Black transgender women, did not find a sig-
nificant link between lifetime PTSD and depression [103]. 
The  methodology  of  a  study  on  MSM  who  experienced 
childhood  sexual  abuse  stands  out  by  exploring  the  link 
between depression and PTSD through network analyses. 
The authors highlighted that depression and PTSD symp-
toms clustered well in their respective diagnoses, but their 
symptoms  were  connected  through  key  nodes  involving 
sleep disturbances, concentration difficulties, and limited 
life outlook [102].

Three studies considered anxiety in their analyses [47, 
89, 99]. All of them focused on samples of sexual minori-
ties  and  showed  a  positive  association  between  anxiety 
and PTSD symptoms.

Only one study addressed distress tolerance and dem-
onstrated  that  MSM  who  had  experienced  childhood 
sexual  abuse  and  reported  greater  difficulty  tolerating 
distress  tended  to  report  more  PTSD  symptoms  in  the 
past week [82].

Some  studies  explored  variables  expected  to  be  pro-
tective  against  PTSD  symptoms  (n  =  3).  One,  focusing 
on  racial  minority  MSM,  showed  that  feeling  in  control 
of  one’s  mental  health,  reporting  positive  effects,  and 
resilience  were  associated  with  lower  traumatic  symp-
tomatology [89]. This result seems supported by another 
study  among  transgender  individuals,  which  also  found 
that  resilience  was  associated  with  a  reduction  in  PTSD 
symptoms [56]. Finally, one study examined the relation-
ship between life satisfaction and PTSD symptoms in an 
LGBTQ + sample, observing that higher life satisfaction 
was associated with fewer PTSD symptoms [71].

Interpersonal level

In  an  ecosystemic  perspective,  the  interpersonal  level 
includes  interactions  with  the  immediate  environment, 
such as parents, friends, romantic relationships, or more 
broadly, the world around us.

Peraud Berthelot et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:3644 Page 12 of 21

Partner  Only  one  study,  focusing  on  transgender  indi-
viduals,  considered  having  a  life  partner  in  its  analyses 
related  to  PTSD.  The  authors  observed  that  individuals 
who  reported  having  a  partner  had  fewer  PTSD  symp-
toms [56].

Parents  with  Mental  Health  Disorders  A  study  on 
young  MSM  explored  their  perception  of  their  parents’ 
mental  health.  When  these  young  individuals  perceived 
psychiatric disorders in their parents (depression, manic 
depression, schizophrenia), they were also more likely to 
report PTSD symptoms [88].

Outness  Few  studies  have  included  being  open  about 
one’s LGBTQI+ identity in their analyses (n = 2). One of 
them,  involving  LGBTQ  +  individuals,  focused  on  two 
samples:  one  exposed  to  sexual  violence  and  the  other 
exposed to domestic violence. Their results tend to sug-
gest no link between openness about sexual orientation 
and traumatic symptomatology. Indeed, a link was dem-
onstrated only in the sample exposed to sexual violence 
[75]. Other authors also observed no association in their 
sample  of  bisexual  individuals.  However,  they  did  note 
an indirect effect, that being open about sexual orienta-
tion  increased  the  risk  of  experiencing  discrimination, 
which, in turn, heightened the risk of developing PTSD 
symptoms [51].

Perceived Social Support  Seven studies considered per-
ceived  social  support  in  their  analyses.  In  these  studies, 
perceived  social  support  is  conceptualized  differently, 
sometimes  referring  to  family,  friends,  or  a  significant 
other, and sometimes as a global construct. Four studies 
assessed perceived overall social support. Three of them 
showed a negative association between perceived overall 
social  support  and  traumatic  symptomatology  in  trans-
gender [56, 100] and bisexual individuals [50], while one 
did not find a link in LGBQA students [63].

Four  studies  considered  perceived  family  support.  For 
three  of  them,  bisexual  [50],  LGB  [76],  and  transgender 
individuals  [83]  who  perceived  good  support  from  their 
families reported fewer PTSD symptoms. Only one study, 
involving 89 transgender women, did not demonstrate a 
link [100].

Four  studies  considered  perceived  friend  support, 
with most showing a negative association with traumatic 
symptomatology [50, 83, 100], and only one not demon-
strating any link [76].

Four studies considered perceived support from a sig-
nificant other, with two observing a negative association 
with  traumatic  symptomatology  in  bisexual  [50]  and 
transgender individuals [83], and two others not finding a 
link in LGB [76] and transgender individuals [100].

Two  additional  studies  did  not  specifically  assess 
social support but rather rejection and acceptance. One 
study in an LGBT sample showed an increase in PTSD 
and  DSO  symptoms  in  individuals  reporting  feelings 
of  isolation  or  experiencing  rejection  from  their  fam-
ily of origin [44]. Another study, involving transgender 
individuals,  showed  a  decrease  in  PTSD  symptoms  for 
those  reporting  feeling  accepted  by  other  transgender 
individuals [56].

Social trauma response  Two studies have explored how 
the social environment reacts after individuals disclose a 
trauma and its connection to traumatic symptomatology. 
Both studies showed nuanced results.

The  study  by  Salim  et  al.  [96]  notes  that  bisexual 
women  who  have  experienced  rejection  after  disclosing 
their sexual assault reported more PTSD symptoms than 
those who did not face rejection. However, further analy-
ses  showed  that  these  results  were  observed  only  when 
the victim lived in a negative context for bisexual individ-
uals. The authors also observed that recognition accom-
panied by a clumsy reaction could be associated with an 
increase in PTSD symptoms, but this association did not 
persist in multiple regression analyses.

In the second study [75], the authors also observed that 
individuals  who  felt  they  were  treated  differently  after 
disclosing their trauma reported more PTSD symptoms. 
Most other forms of reactions (egocentrism, assistance in 
procedures, distraction, or taking over) were also associ-
ated with an increase in PTSD symptoms, but this asso-
ciation  did  not  persist  in  multiple  regression  analyses. 
The authors also noted that being believed was associated 
with  more  PTSD  symptoms,  primarily  among  victims 
of  domestic  violence.  Other  forms  of  reactions,  such  as 
being listened to or being blamed, did not seem to have 
an impact on symptomatology.

Organizational level

The organizational level reflects the broader environment 
in  which  an  individual  operates.  This  can  encompass 
both the work environment and educational institutions, 
healthcare structures, as well as LGBTQI+ centers.

Barriers in access to care  Only two studies have consid-
ered aspects related to the organizational level in connec-
tion with symptoms of PTSD, both focusing on barriers in 
access to care for transgender individuals. Sherman et al. 
[84] observed that experiencing barriers in access to care 
was  associated  with  an  increase  in  traumatic  symptom-
atology.  In  their  analyses,  the  authors  emphasized  that 
experiencing barriers in access to care also magnified the 
relationship  between  exposure  to  multiple  forms  of  vio-
lence and PTSD symptoms. The second study was more

nuanced, noting that experiencing difficulties in accessing 
gender  affirmation  care  in  previous  months  was  associ-
ated with more PTSD symptoms, but this association did 
not persist when controlled for other variables [56].

Community level

The  community  level  reflects  the  interactions  between 
the individual and the wider world. It encompasses envi-
ronments in which the individual is not directly involved 
but can still be influenced by the norms and values they 
may convey.

Four  studies  have  considered  these  factors  in  their 
analyses related to PTSD. For example, one study exam-
ined neighbourhood crime rates among MSM who expe-
rienced  childhood  sexual  abuse  but  did  not  show  an 
association [82]. Another study, involving a small sample 
of  Black  transgender  women,  explored  the  relationship 
between  their  sense  of  connection  with  the  transgender 
community and PTSD symptoms, and also did not show 
any  association  [84].  A  third  study  investigated  the  link 
between exposure to pandemic-related information dur-
ing the COVID-19 health crisis and found that sexual and 
gender minority individuals who were the most exposed 
to  pandemic-related  news  reported  more  PTSD  symp-
toms  [61].  Finally,  a  study  wich  considered  exposure  to 
anti-transgender  media  discourse  found  that  the  more 
transgender  individuals  were  exposed  to  negative  dis-
course  about  their  community  in  the  media,  the  more 
PTSD symptoms they reported [65].

Political level

The political level includes cultural and political elements 
that  can  affect  individuals,  such  as  societal  attitudes 
towards LGBTQI+ individuals or the legal system.

A  study  conducted  among  transgender  individuals 
living  in  the  United  States  specifically  considered  the 
political  context  in  its  analyses.  The  authors  observed 
that  compared  to  individuals  who  did  not  live  in  states 
where politicians aimed to pass laws reducing the rights 
of transgender individuals, those living in affected states 
reported more symptoms of PTSD [55].

Discussion
The  main  objectives  of  this  systematic  literature  review 
were (a) to explore the prevalence of PTSD and C-PTSD 
among LGBTQI+ individuals as reported in articles pub-
lished  since  2010;  (b)  to  compare  the  symptomatology 
of  PTSD/C-PTSD  according  to  sexual  orientation  and 
gender identity and (c) to identify factors associated with 
PTSD and C-PTSD symptoms among LGBTQI+ individ-
uals.  Of  the  7446  articles  identified  in  the  literature,  60 
were selected for analysis: 18 for prevalence analyses, and 
57 for analyses of associated factors.

Clinical elements
Prevalence rates of PTSD/C-PTSD and disparities across 
groups

Our  first  hypothesis  was  that  LGBTQIA  +  individuals 
would  report  higher  prevalence  rates  of  PTSD/C-PTSD 
compared to those typically observed in the general pop-
ulation.  The  findings  of  this  systematic  literature  review 
underscore  that  PTSD  prevalences  reported  in  studies 
are  significantly  higher  than  those  typically  observed  in 
the general population: around 4.7% for PTSD in the past 
year  (DSM-5)  [104]  and  7.3%  for  PTSD/C-PTSD  over  a 
lifetime (ICD-11) [105].

The  observation  of  a  higher  prevalence  holds  true  for 
the  entire  LGBTQI+  community,  but  certain  popula-
tions  seem  particularly  more  at  risk,  as  expected  in  our 
second  hypothesis.  This  is  notably  the  case  for  bisexual 
individuals, already identified as more at risk than others 
for  other  mental  health  issues  such  as  anxiety,  depres-
sion, or suicidal ideation [12, 106]. This disparity is partly 
explained  by  chronic  exposure  to  different  stereotypes 
specific  to  bisexuality  (e.g.,  questioning  their  sexuality, 
potential infidelity, etc.), even within the LGBTQI+ com-
munity,  see  the  review  by  Chan  et  al.,  [107].  The  PTSD 
prevalences  gathered  in  this  systematic  review  are  even 
higher  among  transgender  individuals,  where  multiple 
factors (e.g., precarity, barriers to healthcare access, over-
exposure to interpersonal violence) combine with certain 
stressors  common  to  LGBTQI+  individuals.  Transgen-
der  individuals  are  confronted  with  various  forms  of 
stigmatization  [108]  and  seem  less  accepted  by  the  gen-
eral  population  than  homosexual  individuals  [109].  The 
meta-analysis  conducted  by  Marchi  et  al.  [24]  on  PTSD 
prevalences  in  LGBTQI+  individuals  further  supports 
our results. The study by Marcha and colleagues is based 
on  27  studies,  the  vast  majority  different  from  those 
included  in  this  systematic  review  (only  two  studies  are 
common: [43, 45]).

Certain studies included in this systematic review have 
showed  particularly  high  prevalences  of  PTSD.  This 
is  notably  the  case  in  the  study  by  Ali  et  al.  [52],  which 
reported  a  PTSD  prevalence  of  61.3%  among  Asian 
American  LGB  +  individuals,  and  the  study  by  Harper 
et  al.  [45]  conducted  in  Western  Kenya,  which  reported 
a PTSD prevalence of 52.3% across their LGBTQI+ sam-
ple and 64.3% among transgender individuals within the 
sample.  The  heterogeneity  in  prevalences  reported  in 
these last two studies likely stems from the specific char-
acteristics of their samples. Individuals recruited by Ali et 
al. [52] experienced a combination of stigmatized identi-
ties,  involving  sexual  orientation  and  racial  background. 
This intersection of different stigmas can make individu-
als particularly vulnerable to experiencing violence [110] 
or  encountering  barriers  in  accessing  healthcare  [111]. 

Peraud Berthelot et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:3644 Page 14 of 21

Harper  and  et  al.  [45]  also  emphasize  that  cultural  and 
political contexts can influence the exposure to violence 
among LGBTQI+ individuals, whereas the results of our 
systematic  review  may  have  been  smoothed  by  a  large 
majority of studies conducted in North America.

Several  international  studies  showed  the  impact  of 
cultural  and  political  context  on  the  experiences  of 
this  population.  In  Europe,  for  instance,  in  a  sample  of 
86,000 sexual minority adults recruited from 28 different 
countries,  Bränström  et  al.  [112]  underline  a  direct  link 
between  structural  stigmatization13  in  the  country  and 
victimization.  Other  studies  emphasize  that  the  political 
context sometimes leads LGBTQ+ individuals to flee their 
countries due to the violence they face, exposing them to 
other forms of violence throughout their journey [113].

Factors associated with trauma-related symptomatology

Our  third  hypothesis  was  that  the  factors  contributing 
to  PTSD/C-PTSD  symptoms  would  operate  at  multiple 
levels, encompassing both individual and societal factors. 
Consistent  with  this  hypothesis,  this  systematic  review 
reveals a wide range of factors associated with PTSD/C-
PTSD symptoms, acting across multiple levels. Several of 
these factors are examined in greater detail in the follow-
ing sections.

Violence exposure

The  experience  of  violence,  particularly  anti-LGBTQI+ 
violence, has been consistently identified as a factor asso-
ciated with increased symptoms of PTSD. This observa-
tion aligns with the scientific literature on ICD-11 PTSD 
and C-PTSD, highlighting that the primary factors iden-
tified  in  the  development  of  C-PTSD  include  repeated 
exposure  to  interpersonal  violence  from  an  early  age, 
which is difficult to escape or avoid [114].

Beyond  the  overexposure  to  interpersonal  violence, 
the characteristics of these events also seem to influence 
the  development  of  PTSD  symptoms.  This  is  suggested 
by some studies, such as that of Keating and Muller [95], 
which  noted  an  increase  in  PTSD  symptoms  when  the 
reported  trauma  was  identified  as  related  to  LGBTQI+ 
identity.  Another  study  by  Paquette  et  al.  [69]  noted  an 
increase  in  symptomatology  when  lesbian  and  bisex-
ual  women  reported  being  sexually  assaulted  by  other 
women, compared to those assaulted only by men. These 
specific  characteristics  of  violence  likely  involve  several 
factors, such as the risk of revealing one’s sexual orienta-
tion  or  gender  identity  by  talking  about  the  assault,  the 
risk of reinforcing negative stigmas toward the LGBTQI+ 
community  when  the  perpetrator  is  part  of  it,  or  the 

13   Societal  conditions,  cultural  norms,  and  institutional  political  policies 
that  restrict  opportunities,  resources,  and  well-being  for  stigmatized  indi-
viduals (Hatzenbuelher, 2016).

construction of a global perception of an insecure world 
where  violence  can  come  from  both  outside  and  inside 
the LGBTQI+ community.

Psychiatric comorbidities

The presence of comorbid disorders, typically psychiatric 
(anxiety  disorders  [47,  89,  99],  depressive  disorders  [71, 
82,  103]),  and  sometimes  somatic  [92],  has  frequently 
been  associated  with  the  existence  of  traumatic  symp-
tomatology. This finding is consistent with existing litera-
ture on the mental health challenges faced by LGBTQI+ 
individuals,  who  are  overexposed  to  various  negative 
mental health outcomes compared to the general popula-
tion [115]. This observation is not surprising considering 
that overexposure to violence, starting in childhood, is a 
major  factor  in  the  development  of  psychopathology  [3, 
116, 117].

Surprisingly,  no  included  study  explored  the  link 
between PTSD and other relevant variables such as dis-
sociative  symptoms  or  suicidal  ideation.  Once  again, 
this  review  couldn’t  clarify  if  having  other  disorders 
makes  LGBTQI+  individuals  more  vulnerable  to  trau-
matic  symptomatology  or  if  these  disorders  occur  after 
untreated traumatic symptomatology, which is frequently 
found  in  patients  reporting  chronic  C-PTSD  [118].  It 
is  highly  likely  that  both  scenarios  exist,  emphasizing 
the  importance  of  identifying  symptoms  reported  by 
LGBTQI+ individuals in clinical practice, both to prevent 
the  development  of  other  disorders  and  for  therapeutic 
purposes in addressing identified disorders.

Coping strategies

In  the  context  of  exposure  to  violence,  LGBTQI+  indi-
viduals may adopt a variety of coping strategies or coping 
behaviors.  However,  the  design  of  the  included  studies 
and, consequently, the results of our systematic review do 
not allow us to determine whether the use of these strate-
gies explains the onset of PTSD symptoms or if traumatic 
symptomatology is responsible for the use of such strate-
gies. For example, several studies showed a link between 
substance  use  and  PTSD  [63,  96],  and  a  meta-analysis 
shows  higher  comorbidity  in  sexual  minority  women 
than  in  heterosexual  women  [119].  The  hypothesis  that 
alcohol consumption could be a self-medication strategy 
in the case of PTSD is supported in the literature [120]. 
Other  authors  emphasize  that  beyond  being  a  coping 
strategy, substance use disorders and PTSD might share 
common neurobiological mechanisms [121].

Furthermore, one study explored the adoption of hyper-
vigilance  behaviors  in  relation  to  traumatic  symptom-
atology  [71].  It  is  noteworthy  that  hypervigilance  was 
conceptualized as an adaptive strategy rather than solely in 
terms of PTSD dimensions, even though it did not appear 
to  be  protective,  but  the  contrary.  The  hypothesis  of 

Peraud Berthelot et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:3644 Page 15 of 21

adaptive hypervigilance behavior in the context of chronic 
violence has  also  found  support  in other  studies, such as 
among young, racialized men in the United States [122].

While  hypervigilance  is  often  described  as  a  particu-
larly costly strategy, it is frequently reported by LGBTQI+ 
individuals  to  cope  with  various  contexts  in  their  lives 
[123].  It  seems  challenging  to  consider  hypervigilance 
solely  in  terms  of  an  adaptive  strategy  or,  conversely, 
solely in terms of traumatic symptomatology, although it 
constitutes  a  central  dimension  [124].  These  symptoms 
likely play a role in a complex system of chronic exposure 
to violence and a lack of efficient coping strategies.

Gender transition-related issues

Specific  issues  related  to  gender  transition  have  been 
identified  in  gender  minorities,  although  further  stud-
ies  would  be  necessary  for  specification.  The  protec-
tive  aspect  of  access  to  medical  transition  on  PTSD 
symptoms  appears  unclear,  with  one  study  observing  a 
decrease  in  PTSD  symptoms  in  individuals  who  under-
went  a  medical  transition  [57],  and  another  not  find-
ing  a  link  [59].  Several  methodological  issues  intersect 
and certainly limit interpretations. For example, the two 
cited  studies  compared  individuals  who  had  or  had  not 
medically  transitioned  and  lacked  clarity  in  conceptual-
izing medical transition, as some transgender individuals 
may not feel the need to medically transition. Therefore, 
the  experiences  are  necessarily  different  between  a  per-
son  wanting  to  transition  medically  but  not  having  the 
opportunity,  and  a  person  who  has  the  opportunity  but 
may  not  feel  the  need.  Moreover,  other  variables  likely 
influence  the  relationship  between  transition  and  PTSD 
symptoms.  This  is  particularly  evident  in  the  included 
articles, which, contrary to expectations in terms of psy-
chopathology [125], show an increase in PTSD symptoms 
in individuals who have socially transitioned [57]. Several 
studies suggest that social transition itself is not respon-
sible  for  this  increase  in  symptoms.  Indeed,  the  experi-
ence  of  social  transition,  especially  when  passing  does 
not allow concealing one’s transgender identity, increases 
the risk of exposure to adversities ranging from microag-
gressions  to  hate  crimes  [54,  57,  126],  thereby  increas-
ing the risk of traumatic symptomatology. This finding is 
more generally applicable within the LGBTQI+ commu-
nity, where being open about one’s sexual orientation or 
gender identity seems to be associated with an increased 
risk of exposure to violence [127].

Methodological elements
Conceptual challenges of sexual orientation and gender 
identity

Certain  conceptual  and  methodological  challenges  need 
to  be  highlighted  in  the  context  of  this  systematic  lit-
erature  review.  Firstly,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  very 

definition  of  sexual  orientation  and  gender  identity  var-
ies across studies. For instance, some studies conceptual-
ize sexual orientation based on behaviors (e.g., “Have you 
had sex or engaged in sexual activity with someone of the 
same  gender  as  you?“)  [102],  while  others  conceptual-
ize  it  based  on  self-reported  identity  (e.g.,  “You  identify 
yourself as…”) [49]. Some studies include both options in 
their  sociodemographic  questionnaires,  supplemented 
by the possibility of having an attraction to people of the 
same gender without necessarily having had sexual inter-
course  (e.g.,  “Within  the  past  year,  have  you  felt  physi-
cally  attracted  to  people  of  the  same  gender  as  you?“) 
[75].  Regarding  gender  identity,  various  operationaliza-
tions  of  gender  are  also  observed,  from  self-reporting 
(e.g.,  “What  is  your  current  gender  identity?“)  [66]  to  a 
two-step methodology asking about assigned sex at birth 
first (e.g., “What was the sex you were assigned at birth?“) 
and  then  current  gender  identity  (e.g.,  “I  identify  as…”) 
[49].  This  variability  in  operationalizing  sexual  orienta-
tion  or  gender  identity  necessarily  leads  to  variability 
in  the  recruited  profiles.  For  example,  some  individuals 
engaging in homosexual behaviors might identify as het-
erosexual if sexual orientation is operationalized solely in 
terms  of  identity.  This  variability  in  profiles  likely  leads 
to  variability  in  results;  individuals  recruited  based  on 
homosexual  behaviors  may  be  more  at  risk  of  exposure 
to various forms of violence compared to individuals self-
identifying  as  homosexual  without  having  engaged  in 
homosexual activity.

Statistical and methodological challenges in research on 
sexual orientation and gender identity

Another  methodological  challenge  in  research  involving 
LGBTQI+  individuals  relates  to  the  methodological  and 
statistical  treatment  of  the  results.  The  vast  majority  of 
included  studies  were  retrospective,  with  some  choos-
ing  to  group  different  profiles  of  sexual  orientations  or 
gender  identities  together,  thus  diluting  the  existing 
specificities of each group. This practice is more broadly 
reflected in the scientific literature concerning LGBTQI+ 
individuals [128] and may indicate difficulties in recruit-
ment  or  obtaining  financial  means  to  deploy  more 
robust  methodologies.  This  often  comes  at  the  expense 
of  the  most  vulnerable  and  hard-to-reach  populations. 
In  this  regard,  it  is  noteworthy  to  mention  profiles  that 
do  not  appear  in  the  results  of  this  systematic  review: 
no  included  study  provided  results  regarding  intersex 
individuals.  This  observation  is  likely  explained  by  the 
design  of  the  included  studies,  necessarily  quantitative, 
which  is  a  minority  research  format  in  intersex  popula-
tions  [129],  probably  due  to  the  challenges  of  obtaining 
a  significant  sample.  It  is  worth  noting  that  one  study, 
not  included  due  to  our  inclusion  criteria,  showed  that 
in a sample of 198 intersex adults, 40.9% reported having 

Peraud Berthelot et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:3644 Page 16 of 21

been  diagnosed  with  PTSD  [130].  These  results  suggest 
that  intersex  individuals  constitute  a  particularly  vul-
nerable  population  that  needs  to  be  acknowledged  and 
supported.

Conceptual and methodological challenges of PTSD

Beyond the specific challenges related to research meth-
odologies  involving  LGBTQI+  individuals,  it  is  also 
important  to  highlight  the  limitations  encountered  in 
this systematic review in the conceptualization of PTSD. 
While the included studies had to assess traumatic symp-
tomatology  by  referring  to  a  recognized  classification 
(DSM, ICD) and use validated tools, there is heterogene-
ity in the quality of the tools used, with some studies opt-
ing  for  short  versions  of  self-questionnaires.  It  is  worth 
mentioning that only a minority of studies have assessed 
inter-
PTSD  using  clinician-administered  diagnostic 
views. Moreover, studies could rely on different classifica-
tions (e.g., DSM-IV, DSM 5, ICD-11), leading to different 
conceptualizations of PTSD in terms of dimensions, and 
even  in  terms  of  diagnoses  with  the  introduction  of  the 
diagnosis  of  C-PTSD  in  the  ICD-11.  While  LGBTQI+ 
individuals are massively exposed to the risk factors iden-
tified  in  the  development  of  C-PTSD  and  some  authors 
advocate for considering this symptomatology more spe-
cifically in the LGBTQI+ population [131, 132], only one 
included study assessed C-PTSD [44].

Strengths and limitations of the study

To  date,  and  to  our  knowledge,  this  study  is  the  first  to 
conduct  a  systematic  literature  review  on  factors  asso-
ciated  with  PTSD  symptoms  in  LGBTQI+  individuals. 
This work complements, from a different perspective, the 
recent  meta-analysis  on  PTSD  prevalence  in  LGBTQ+ 
individuals  [133].  The  main  strength  of  our  work  lies 
in  the  rigor  inherent  to  systematic  reviews,  providing  a 
condensed  summary  of  the  literature  on  PTSD  among 
LGBTQI+  individuals  published  in  recent  years.  The 
contributions  of  this  study  are  numerous  and  relevant 
for  both  clinical  practice  and  research,  emphasizing 
that  PTSD  is  a  public  health  concern  among  LGBTQI+ 
individuals.

We  hope  that  this  systematic  review  finds  its  place  at 

various levels:

For  clinicians,  this  work  constitutes  a  major  resource 
for updating their knowledge by highlighting the impor-
tance of a systematic assessment of exposure to violence 
and  PTSD  symptoms  in  LGBTQ+ patients.  Identifying 
factors  influencing  traumatic  symptomatology  provides 
an important framework to consider in therapeutic work.
For researchers, this systematic review provides a con-
densed  overview  of  factors  evaluated  in  the  PTSD  lit-
erature  among  LGBTQI+ individuals  to  date.  It  serves 

as  a  foundation  for  exploring  associations  with  PTSD 
that  have  not  been  extensively  studied  within  the 
LGBTQI+ community  (e.g.,  dissociation)  or  require  fur-
ther  investigation  (e.g.,  race  and  ethnicity,  transition, 
barriers  to  accessing  care).  We  also  hope  that  this  work 
can be utilized by LGBTQI+ individuals and associations 
in  their  interactions  with  public  authorities  to  advocate 
for funding support for LGBTQI+ individuals exposed to 
violence.

Some  limitations  need  to  be  acknowledged.  One  of 
the main limitations is that, through this work, we have 
aimed  to  offer  a  comprehensive  synthesis  of  factors 
associated  with  PTSD  in  LGBTQI+  individuals.  In  this 
endeavor,  we  had  to  navigate  a  delicate  balancing  act 
between  synthesis  and  precision.  To  remain  accessible, 
we chose to group profiles with multiple characteristics, 
potentially  smoothing  over  certain  specificities.  This  is 
particularly  true  for  gender  minorities,  where  specific 
issues related to transition may have been observed that 
are  not  present  in  sexual  minorities.  It  is  certain  that 
systematic reviews focusing specifically on PTSD in cer-
tain groups within the LGBTQI+ community are neces-
sary. This  is  evident  in  the  proposals  made  by  Lépine  et 
al.  [134]  in  a  systematic  review  on  post-assault  factors 
involved in PTSD among gay men, or Scheer et al. [119] 
in  a  meta-analysis  on  PTSD  and  alcohol  consumption 
among  sexual  minority  women.  We  hope  that  further 
research  will  complement  these  works.  Additionally, 
due  to  the  predominantly  exploratory  and  retrospective 
designs  of  the  included  studies,  this  systematic  review 
does  not  allow  for  inferring  causality  for  the  majority 
of  identified  variables.  Furthermore,  the  heterogeneity 
of  methods  for  assessing  sexual  orientation  and  gender 
identity in scientific literature makes it particularly chal-
lenging to conduct meta-analyses and systematic reviews 
in  this  field.  Despite  our  vigilance,  it  is  likely  that  some 
publications presented as solely addressing sexual minor-
ities  may  also  include  gender  minorities  that  were  not 
identified  in  sociodemographic  questions.  Some  hetero-
geneity was also observed in the methods used to assess 
PTSD across the studies. The vast majority of studies (n = 
56) evaluated the presence of probable PTSD using self-
report scales rather than clinician-administered diagnos-
tic interviews (n = 4). This methodological bias may have 
led to an overestimation of the prevalence rates reported 
in the studies, and consequently in this systematic review. 
Finally,  the  systematic  evaluation  of  exposure  to  one  or 
more  potentially  traumatic  events  was  not  a  criterion 
in  the  selection  of  studies.  This  choice  reflects  a  bias  in 
existing studies, which do not always assess the presence 
of PTSD criterion A. This may have influenced the results 
reported  in  this  systematic  review  and  highlights  the 
need for more rigorous future studies.

Peraud Berthelot et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:3644 Perspectives

It is important for researchers working in the field of PTSD 
to  consider  sexual  and  gender  minorities  more  in  their 
protocols,  especially  as  this  would  only  involve  adding  a 
few  items  to  their  research  protocol.  Recommendations 
already  exist  for  inclusive  collection  of  sexual  orientation 
and gender identity information in studies [135, 136].

Our  results  also  emphasize  the  importance  of  going 
beyond  the  assessment  of  PTSD  and  exploring  C-PTSD 
symptoms.  Some  tools,  such  as  the  ITQ  [42],  make  its 
assessment  possible  at  a  relatively  low  cost  in  terms  of 
administration  time.  While  some  factors  have  already 
been  extensively  investigated,  others  still  deserve  explo-
ration  to  identify  their  role  in  the  traumatic  symptom-
atology  of  LGBTQI+  individuals  (e.g.,  dissociation). 
Furthermore, we encourage the use of more robust meth-
odological designs to address the numerous biases identi-
fied in the included articles. At a lower cost, this involves 
considering sexual and gender minorities in the sociode-
mographic questions of existing epidemiological studies.
On  a  therapeutic  level,  it  seems  necessary  for  profes-
sionals supporting LGBTQI+ individuals to be trained in 
identifying and managing psycho-trauma. Likewise, pro-
fessionals trained in psycho-trauma management should 
be sensitized to LGBTQI+ issues in order to feel compe-
tent in welcoming this population, given that a significant 
number  of  LGBTQ+  individuals  are  likely  to  seek  ther-
apy  [137].  Access  to  care  adapted  to  the  specific  needs 
of  the  LGBTQI+  community  is  a  matter  of  access  to 
human rights and public health. Some care options that 
meet the specific needs of the LGBTQI+ community do 
exist today and have proven to be relevant (e.g., support 
groups  for  affected  individuals,  parent-child  support). 
However, it is certain that existing techniques for treating 
PTSD/C-PTSD  are  also  suitable  for  LGBTQI+  individu-
als, although specific stressors for this population should 
be  taken  into  account  [138].  It  is  therefore  necessary  to 
facilitate  the  access  of  these  populations  to  these  care 
options at various levels (e.g., financial accessibility, pub-
lic healthcare offerings, professional training, etc.).

Finally, it seems impossible to discuss the treatment of 
PTSD  in  LGBTQI+ individuals  without  addressing  the 
urgency  of  protecting  this  population  from  the  violence 
to which they are exposed. It seems difficult, if not ethi-
cally  questionable,  to  imagine  being  able  to  treat  PTSD 
symptoms such as hypervigilance, avoidance, or difficul-
ties in connecting with others in an environment where, 
without  these  strategies,  these  individuals  would  risk 
being  exposed  to  violence  again.  A  public  health  policy 
aimed at improving the mental health of LGBTQI+ indi-
viduals  urgently  calls  for  a  broader  policy  of  inclusiv-
ity  for  this  population  in  common  law  at  all  levels  (e.g., 
education,  employment,  justice,  family  rights,  access  to 
healthcare, etc.).

Conclusions
This systematic review shows the importance of consid-
ering  PTSD/C-PTSD  among  LGBTQI+ individuals  in 
clinical practice and research. Higher quality studies are 
needed  to  quantify  the  extent  of  the  problem.  Health-
care  professionals  must  be  trained  in  the  specific  fac-
tors that may contribute to PTSD/C-PTSD symptoms in 
LGBTQI+ individuals.  This  cannot  be  achieved  without 
public policies aimed at preventing all forms of violence 
against  the  LGBTQI+ population  and  ensuring  access  to 
equal rights.
