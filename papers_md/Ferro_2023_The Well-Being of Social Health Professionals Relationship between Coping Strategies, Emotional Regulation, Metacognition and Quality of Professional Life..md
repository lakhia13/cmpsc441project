Abstract: Social health professionals should have the knowledge and skills and use personal resources
that promote the helping relationship, access to effective intervention strategies, and well-being at
work. This study aims to investigate the relationship between some personal resources (coping strate-
gies, emotional regulation and metacognition) and professional satisfaction in a group of social–health
professionals working with minors suffering from psychosocial distress. In this professional group,
the risk of burnout is common and the quality of professional life is strongly related to the intensity
and frequency of exposure to critical and traumatic events. The sample was assessed using self-report
instruments: Professional Quality of Life Scale, Coping Orientation to the Problem Experienced,
Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale and Metacognition Self-Assessment Scale. The quality
of professional life showed significant correlations with the psychological characteristics studied.
We then tested different regression models: coping orientation scores were found to be a significant
predictor of quality of work life for all three components, while emotional dysregulation scores
appeared to predict only the burnout component. The quality of professional life of social health
professionals was influenced by individual resources at different levels, regardless of knowledge
and skills. They showed greater fatigue and aspects of secondary traumatization when emotional
disengagement occurred and it seemed to be difficult for them to accept their emotional reactions.

1. Introduction

Health and social care professionals are a category of helpers who are in close contact
with a target group that is confronted with a variety of stressful conditions. The social health
professionals involved in the care of minors may be psychologists, professional educators,
nurses and health care workers. The main areas in which these professionals work are
residential care, home care and day care in specialized centers. In the Mediterranean
context, especially in Spain and Italy, residential care offers a high level of professional
qualification, theoretical models and specific working tools that promote and maintain
the quality of residential child protection services [1]. In Italy, local administrations define
forms and methods of organization and monitoring of residential care for the protection
of children and adolescents. This work context places individuals at increased risk of
developing work-related stress, as well as increased feelings of fatigue [2–5]. The role of
the health and social worker requires a set of competencies that can be summarized in
three categories that include thought (“knowledge”), action (“skills”) and affect (“knowing

how to be”). They develop from the combination of knowledge and skills and require
the practitioner’s willingness to engage. The terms “knowledge” and “skills” refer to
job-specific knowledge, skills and competencies. The “knowing how to be”, on the other
hand, refers to the employee’s personal resources that are used in the helping relationship
and can influence its quality. This implies a significant emotional and affective investment
that enables the helper to understand the needs of the other person and to find appropriate
and effective ways to intervene [6].

As in all helping professions, effective intervention occurs through the relational
channel, which requires, among other skills, the ability to regulate one’s emotions, select
and apply appropriate coping strategies, and use metacognition to evaluate, direct and
coordinate all other skills and strategies. Effective social health professionals today must
be able to be flexible and adaptive in their activities to the specific situations and needs
they encounter in their work practice [7,8]. Moreover, the presence of such skills not only
improves employees’ professional competence and, consequently, their ability to interact
with users, but also their sense of personal and professional self-efficacy [6]. Caregivers
describe how rewarding the role of parenting traumatized children is, even though they
may face challenges that impact their well-being [5]. In turn, caregivers recognize the need
for support for themselves that is often not available [9]. When employees feel unable
to perform their job, they perceive their resources to be insufficient to meet the demands,
so they are at risk of burnout [6,10]. Furthermore, those who work with minors within
the category of social and health professions face intense emotional, metacognitive and
stressful challenges. In fact, the helping relationship between health professionals and
children contains specific parenting elements that can significantly impact burnout risk [1].
Furthermore, users may be at risk if caregivers feel stressed or unable to cope with the
situation, further exacerbating the child’s difficulties [11–13]. Burnout is characterized by
emotional exhaustion and lack of job satisfaction and is very common among workers in
helping or educational professions [14]. The frequent staff turnover in residential childcare
due to burnout, exacerbated by the difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff during
COVID-19, has a direct impact on vulnerable children who have already experienced a
series of attachment and relationship breakdowns. Staff turnover contributes to the loss of
relationships and the unpredictability of children’s lives and is therefore a direct risk factor
for these vulnerable children [15]. For these reasons, it is crucial that training interventions
for social and health care workers not only target theoretical and/or technical knowledge,
but also take into account the skills associated with knowing how to be and serve as a link
for all other skills [6,7].

Shealy [16] defined professionals working in these settings as “therapeutic parents”,
that is, social health professionals who perform therapeutic activities but have parent-like
roles. The professional working with children with psychosocial distress is the primary
caregiver for the child and family, assumes direct responsibility for the child and acts as
a “surrogate parent” [16,17]. Professionals who have closer daily contact with children as
health and social workers are called upon to invest physically and emotionally in children’s
physical and mental health to promote their appropriate development and well-being [1,18].
The quality of professional life in emergency services appears to be strongly related to the
intensity and frequency of exposure to critical events, since the latter is correlated with
increased risk to emergency workers’ mental health [19]. The traumatic experience of a
rescuer is not necessarily due to the event itself, but to the helping relationship with a
person suffering from the event [20].

Figley [21] proposes the construct of “compassion fatigue”, which describes feelings
of deep compassion and understanding for someone affected by suffering, accompanied
by a strong desire to alleviate the suffering or eliminate its cause [21]. We can define it
as psychological discomfort caused by constant contact with the pain of others, a state
of tension and worry characterized by symptomatology reminiscent of post-traumatic
stress disorder, which can manifest itself in those who are frequently exposed to the
suffering and narrative of the traumatic experiences of others [22]. In this sense, Figley [21]

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 51

3 of 14

suggests that the response to a critical event lies on a continuum between the positive
extreme of job satisfaction (compassion satisfaction) and the negative extreme of attrition
(compassion fatigue).

Burnout and compassion fatigue may appear similar, but they differ in several key
dimensions. On the one hand, compassion fatigue has an acute and sudden onset that can
be triggered by a single experience that the affected person perceives as particularly criti-
cal [22]; on the other hand, burnout corresponds to a gradual and progressive exhaustion of
the practitioner who feels overwhelmed by his or her work and unable to promote positive
change [10,21]. Despite some differences, both can be considered occupational hazards
in their own right [23–25]. It should be noted that the practice of a helping profession is
not necessarily associated with a set of negative consequences. In this context, Stamm [26]
introduces the concept of “compassion satisfaction” to describe the positive effects a person
may derive from working with suffering people, including positive feelings related to
helping others, contributing to the well-being of society, and more generally, the pleasure
of “doing one’s job well” [26]. For this reason, the quality of a responder’s professional
life cannot be attributed solely to the absence of negative consequences, but to a state of
psychosocial well-being, too [27].

It can be stated that the well-being of social health professionals is linked to various
aspects and that the quality of the helping relationship requires various relational skills,
such as knowing how to regulate one’s emotions, and choosing and using appropriate
and utilizing metacognitive skills. If the resources described are perceived as inadequate,
professionals are at greater risk of burnout and a reduced quality of professional life,
leading to an impoverishment of the helping relationship itself [6,27]. Training would help
to improve social health professionals’ awareness and knowledge of disease and increase
their ability to understand disease presentations, including the impact and support needed
for caregivers. Access to clinical supervision and consultation would enable professionals
to reflect on and adapt their care [12,13]. Karadzhov et al. [28] emphasize the importance of
asking social health professionals for their reflections on challenges, successes and lessons
learned in order to understand the particular needs, struggles and aspirations of these
workers in different settings.

In the literature, there are few studies on the quality of life of social health professionals,
and most of them are related to patients with chronic diseases [29–31] or nurses, particularly
after COVID-19 emergencies [32–36].

The aim of the following work was to investigate the relationship between some
personal resources (coping strategies, emotion regulation and metacognition) and job satis-
faction in a group of social and health professionals working with minors with psychosocial
distress. The aim was to use the information obtained not only for the purposes of ex-
ploratory research, but also to propose preventive and educational interventions aimed
at improving the skills already present in social health professionals and promoting those
that are lacking or dysfunctional, as well as to improve the perception of the quality of the
actors’ professional life.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design

Data collection was performed by sending a battery of tests through an anonymous
Google Form. The collected data were then analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version
27 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). We performed an initial correlation analysis by
calculating Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Then, different regression models were
tested by linear regression analysis.

Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the University of Valle

d’Aosta (protocol n. 0015239; 21 September 2023).

2.2. Participants

The sample was recruited by sending an email to the coordinators of the residential
structures and day-time center for minors throughout Italy. Once consent was received,
the test battery was sent. A single institutional email address received all anonymous
responses. Therefore, 83 subjects responded to the Google Form, but only 81 had completed
the entire battery. They all met our inclusion criteria and therefore made up the sample of
our research.

The inclusion criteria for this study were that they were social–health professionals
working with minors suffering from psychosocial problems and in need of socio-health care.
Only professionals who had been employed for more than three months were included
so that the youth relationship had time to establish itself. In particular, a daily report was
required, as was typical for those working in residential care centers, in home care services
where the professional visits the minor’s home, and in day care where the professionals
of a team work in a specialized center that the minor visits during the day and returns
home in the evening. We therefore excluded the social health professional figures who do
not deal with minors daily, such as structure coordinators, neuropsychiatrists, therapists,
social workers, interns and other health professionals responsible for managing internal
and external activities at the structure (animal therapists, etc.). Therefore, we included
educators, nurses, psychiatric rehab technicians and healthcare assistants.

The mean age was 35.1 years (sd = 10.1), with a mean seniority of 7.8 years (sd = 7.1).
The group was composed of 75.3% women (n = 61) and 24.7% men (n = 20). The majority
of the sample worked in northern Italy (85.2%) and, in particular, in residential structures
(65.4%). More detailed information can be found in Table 1.

The test battery consisted of a questionnaire in which some sociodemographic and
professional information was requested. This was followed by a battery composed of four
self-report questionnaires: Professional Quality of Life Scale (PRQOL), Coping Orientation

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 51

to the Problems Experienced—New Italian Version (COPE-NVI), Difficulties in Emotional
Regulation Scale (DERS) and Metacognition Self-Assessment Scale (MSAS).

Using the PRQOL allows us to understand the quality of professional life of social
and health care workers in terms of the risk of developing burnout and compassion
fatigue and to assess any elements of satisfaction and gratification that could instead
enhance the ability to make personal and organizational efforts that improve the emotional
management of their needs and abilities [1,14,37]. Burnout impairs emotional availability
and thus therapeutic outcomes for children [38]. Minors who have suffered trauma or other
disadvantages need professionals who understand their needs and the emotions underlying
the behaviors they perform so that they can learn to self-manage and develop adaptive
and resilience skills. This requires the professional to tune into them, show empathy and
connect emotionally. These tasks become extremely difficult when one feels exhausted and
emotionally exhausted [39].

The emotional regulation scale allows us to understand the ability to identify, recog-
nize and manage one’s emotional experiences. These skills can contribute to “emotional
preparedness”, which is able to reduce the negative effects of stressful situations related to
the nature of work. The care of minors in social and health professions can be influenced
by the impact of individual events that are difficult to deal with, but also by prolonged
exposure to situations of suffering, such as previous trauma suffered and/or individual
mental health problems of the minors concerned [37]. These working conditions require
a high emotional effort, which can lead to the suppression of one’s own emotions and a
decrease in sensitivity to traumatic experiences in order to ensure the ability to maintain
work duties in the face of great stress. A profession such as that of the participants involved
in this research is based on emotions and relationships, and operators must be able to work
in this sense to manage and deal with their own emotions and those of the users [37].

For stressful situations to be managed in relation to the minor and the complex care
organization in which he/she is incorporated, this could concern the ability to respond
adaptively to events and apply useful and effective coping strategies, such as asking for
support when necessary, having a positive attitude or planning properly for the implemen-
tation of targeted and effective interventions. Our earlier study showed that the use of
avoidance strategies appears to be increasing among social and health care workers in the
face of greater emotional intolerance [14].

In addition, metacognitive understanding of the other’s psyche could improve the

effectiveness of treatment by enabling staff to better understand the minor’s needs [37].

2.3.1. Professional Quality of Life Scale

This questionnaire examines the quality of professional life using 30 items on a Lik-
ert scale (from 1 = never to 5 = very often) that explore the experiences in the helping
professions [27]. Specifically, the questionnaire identifies two dimensions: compassion
satisfaction and compassion fatigue. The first refers to the pleasure the worker derives from
being able to do his or her job well. Higher scores on this scale represent greater satisfaction
in the ability to be an effective caregiver in one’s job. Compassion fatigue, on the other
hand, is the perception of fatigue due to one’s role as a helper in the work context. This
dimension is again divided into two sub-dimensions: burnout and secondary traumatic
stress. Burnout is known to be a state of stress manifested by feelings of hopelessness and
difficulty in coping with work or performing the job effectively. Higher scores on this scale
mean you are at higher risk for burnout. Secondary traumatic stress, on the other hand, is
the discomfort that results from secondary exposure to extremely or traumatically stressful
events. This is a very specific condition of the helping professions and relates to the concept
of vicarious traumatization, which is the result of constant exposure to patients’ traumatic
experiences. Higher scores do not mean that you have a problem but are an indication
that you should change some aspects of your work and/or work environment. The cutoff
points refer to each of the three dimensions of the questionnaire and are defined as follows:

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 51

6 of 14

low for scores of 22 or less; moderate for scores between 23 and 41; and high for scores
above 42 [27].

2.3.2. Coping Orientation to the Problems Experienced

The Coping Orientations to Problem Experienced [40] is a self-report questionnaire
that considers various coping methods. It includes ratings of five dimensions: social
support (seeking understanding and information, and tendency to emotional outbursts),
avoidance strategies (denial, use of substances, behavior and mental distancing), positive
attitude (attitude of acceptance, containment, and positive reinterpretation of events),
problem solving (active and planning strategies) and turning to religion (trust in religion,
absence of humor). The Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced—New Italian Version
(COPE-NVI) [41] is a 60-item questionnaire with a four-point Likert scale ranging from 1
(I typically do not do it) to 4 (I almost always do it).

2.3.3. Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale

This is a self-completion questionnaire consisting of 36 items with Likert responses
(from 1 = almost never to 5 = almost always) [42]. The evaluation results in a total score
and six subscales. Nonacceptance is the tendency to have a negative secondary response
or nonaccepting response to one’s distress; Goals refers to the difficulty in concentrating
and/or completing tasks when experiencing negative emotions; Impulse is the difficulty in
maintaining control over one’s behavior when experiencing negative emotions; Awareness
reflects a lack of awareness or inattention to emotional reactions; Strategies concerns the
belief that there is little one can do to self-regulate when upset; Clarity reflects the extent
to which a person is aware of and clear about his or her emotions. There are no clinical
cutoffs, but high scores indicate greater difficulty in emotional regulation.

2.3.4. Metacognition Self-Assessment Scale

The Metacognition Self-Assessment Scale is a measure of metacognitive skills [43].
This is a self-report measure consisting of 18 items comprising a five-point Likert scale (from
1 = never to 5 = almost always). The assessment includes five dimensions: Monitoring,
which represents the ability to identify and name the components of our mental state.
Integration, which is the ability to think about different mental states and identify internal
contradictions, conflicts and patterns. Differentiation refers to the ability to recognize the
representative nature of one’s mental states and mental content. Decentering is the ability
to take others’ perspective and hypothesize about their mental states. Finally, mastery
refers to the strategies individuals employ to use their knowledge of themselves and others
to solve psychological and interpersonal problems. High scores on the MSAS indicate
better self-assessment of metacognitive abilities than low scores.

As can be seen in Table 2, the mean values of compassion satisfaction and burnout
correspond to a moderate level (moderate for scores between 23 and 41), while the mean
value of secondary traumatic stress corresponds to a low level (low when the score is 22
or less [27]. We can therefore argue overall that the observed sample of social and health
care professionals showed a moderate level of quality of professional life. In particular,
from the values summarized in Table 2, it is evident that no subject showed a low level
of compassion satisfaction (low when the score is 22 or less), nor a high level of the
scale for burnout and secondary traumatic stress (high for scores above 42). With regard
to compassion satisfaction, more than half of the sample showed moderate satisfaction
(69.1%), while 30.9% reported high satisfaction with the helping profession. Scores were
also positive on the secondary traumatic scale, with 71.6% of professionals indicating a
low level of discomfort related to secondary trauma. Finally, 70.4% indicated a medium
level of burnout, while only a small proportion (29.6%) indicated a low level. However,
the three self-administered questionnaires used to measure personal resources do not have
cut-offs but are a measure of the psychological characteristics of professionals. COPE
values are consistent with normative values [41]. In particular, the sample appears to use
social support, positive attitude and problem solving to a slightly greater extent than the
normative values. In contrast, the mean values for the use of avoidance strategies and
turning to religion are slightly below the normative value. In our sample, therefore, we
observe a greater use of proactive strategies.

As for the MSAS and the DERS, a wide range of values is observed, but no minimum or
maximum value assumes critical importance. There are no normative values for the MSAS.
However, the questionnaire has a total raw score ranging from 18 to 90 [43]. Therefore,
we can consider the mean value of the sample as an indicator of an intermediate level of
metacognitive abilities. As far as the DERS is concerned, the values given in Table 2 are
corrected for age and gender based on the work of Giromini et al. [44]. As these are T-points
(mean = 50, SD = 10), it can be argued that the average of our sample corresponds to the
normative data [44]. There are greater difficulties with emotional awareness. However, the
mean value remains in the range (50 + 10), which can be considered consistent with the
intermediate level of metacognitive skills of our sample.

3.2. Correlation Analysis

Quality of professional life showed some significant correlations with the psychological
characteristics studied. All three components of the PRQOL correlated significantly with

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 51

8 of 14

some coping strategies and some dimensions of emotional dysregulation. Instead, only
secondary traumatic stress appeared to correlate with metacognitive abilities. As can be
seen in Table 3, compassion satisfaction correlated positively and with low intensity with
positive attitude, problem solving and transcendental orientation.

However, burnout and secondary traumatic stress correlated only moderately with
avoidance strategies. Secondary traumatic stress also correlated weakly and directly with
social support.

As noted earlier, only secondary traumatic stress appeared to have a correlation,
albeit weak, with metacognitive abilities. Specifically, a direct correlation is observed
with the MSAS monitoring component and an indirect correlation with the integration
component. Finally, emotional dysregulation correlated with low and moderate intensity
with all components of professional quality of life. The highest correlation was observed
between secondary traumatic stress and the DERS goals dimension. Stress resulting from
secondary traumatic stress increased with difficulty concentrating and/or accomplishing

tasks when experiencing negative emotions. This dimension of the PRQOL correlated
positively with all DERS aspects except the clarity component.

Compassion satisfaction correlated weakly and inversely with the DERS components
of nonacceptance, strategies and the total scale. Burnout showed the same correlations, this
time directly. A correlation with DERS_goals was also observed.

3.3. Regression Analysis

We performed linear regression analyses using the dimensions measured by PRQOL
as dependent variables. We then tested several regression models using the COPE, MSAS
and DERS dimensions as independent variables. The MSAS demonstrated no significance
with any of the three PRQOL dimensions. Otherwise, COPE proved to be a significant
predictor of professional quality of life, for all three components. DERS appears to predict
only the burnout component (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Linear regression model.

Starting from these observations, we conducted a regression analysis with PRQOL_
Compassion Satisfaction as the dependent variable and all components of COPE as the
independent variable (R2 0.27; SE = 4.46; p = 0.00). Thus, the coping strategies measured
with the COPE were able to explain 27% of the compassion satisfaction scores measured
with the PRQOL. Table 4 summarizes the coefficients of each predictor. COPE_problem
solving (B = 0.27; SE = 0.14; p = 0.05) and COPE_turning to religion (B = 0.45; SE = 0.18;
p = 0.01) were significant predictors.

We therefore entered PRQOL_burnout as the dependent variable and COPE and DERS
as independent variables (R2 = 0.34; SE = 4.57; p = 0.00). The two dimensions together
could explain 34% of the burnout values. The significant predictors were COPE_avoidance
strategies (B = 0.64; SE = 0.20; p = 0.00) and DERS_non-acceptance (B = 0.17; SE = 0.06;
p = 0.00) (Table 5).

Finally, we tested the model with PRQOL_secondary traumatic stress as the dependent
variable and COPE as the independent variable (R2= 0.24; SE = 4.69; p = 0.00). An amount
of 24% of the secondary traumatic stress values could be explained by the values measured
in COPE. As shown in Table 6, COPE_social support (B = 0.18; SE = 0.09; p = 0.05) and
COPE_avoidance strategies (B = 0.71; SE = 0.19; p = 0.00) were significant predictors for
this dimension.

The results of the regression analyses thus indicate the predictive role of coping strate-
gies on professional quality of life. Burnout, one of the three dimensions of professional
quality of life, also appears to be partly influenced by the ability to regulate emotions.
Metacognitive skills, on the other hand, show no predictive role for the three PRQOL
dimensions investigated.

4. Discussion

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between personal resources
such as coping strategies, metacognitive and emotional regulation skills, and quality of
professional life within a specific occupational group characterized by aspects of caregiving.
Impairment of the quality of professional life and the associated risk of developing
burnout syndrome are more common among workers who interact with others and are
involved in professional relationships such as helping, supporting and guiding [45,46].
Professionals who work with minors are significantly affected by aspects of burnout
that could compromise the quality of their professional lives, precisely because of the
emotional commitment that caring for minors requires [1,47]. Healthcare professionals
tend to underestimate and fail to manage their state of stress, leading to a worsening of
their situation [16,19]; burnout affects professionals’ emotional availability and therapeutic
outcomes in minors [39]. When emotional exhaustion is present, it becomes difficult to
tune into the caregiving relationship and be empathetic [21,25]. In addition, burnout
conditions can cause frequent turnover, which negatively impacts children who have

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 51

11 of 14

already experienced relationship breakdowns and losses [15]. In addition, it appears
that under these conditions, there is a tendency to become emotionally detached, to use
avoidance strategies and to reduce the ability to regulate emotions [14].

Specific aspects of the quality of professional life were examined with the PRO-
QOL [27], namely compassion satisfaction, burnout and secondary traumatic stress. None
of the three dimensions was impaired in our sample. Our sample also had moderate scores
on the personal resources examined, such as emotional regulation skills, metacognition
and appropriate use of coping strategies.

All dimensions of professional quality of life are related to coping strategies and some
aspects of emotional dysregulation. Notably, however, professional satisfaction seems to
depend exclusively on coping strategies implemented at cognitive and behavioral levels,
such as transcendental orientation and problem orientation.

Thus, the hypothesis is that the enjoyment of the helping relationship with minors is
influenced by the perception of being acting and engaged subjects, i.e., by the perception of
feeling actively involved in their intervention with concrete actions and being able to bring
about positive change through operational strategies and planning.

Moreover, personal satisfaction, although positively associated with some aspects of
emotional regulation, does not seem to depend on these aspects. At the same time, it is
completely independent of metacognitive abilities. Therefore, it is possible that it is related
to a dimension of utility that is more likely to be achieved through the use of cognitive
and behavioral strategies that may be more timely than through recourse to the other
skills studied.

The dimension of fatigue and especially secondary traumatization is instead associated
with higher levels of emotional dysregulation and reduced metacognitive abilities. Fatigue
in the helping relationship also appears to depend on the tendency toward disengagement
that results from resorting to the avoidance and nonacceptance of responses to emotional
distress. Consistent with the previous study [14], it can be hypothesized that this tendency
may limit the use of appropriate coping strategies, emotional regulation and metacognitive
skills, which the sample has been shown to possess and which could be a protective
dimension in this case.

In addition, it is possible that the tendency toward avoidance could contribute to a
picture of emotional dysregulation associated with fatigue by reducing opportunities to
process and cope with negative experiences. These findings seem relevant because in the
helping relationship with minors, the healthcare professional is the one who simultaneously
interacts with his or her own emotions and influences the other [48]. In educational practice,
the educator must constantly demonstrate their ability to listen and be in an empathetic
position, becoming the “container” through their words, gestures and actions, and being the
one who attributes meaning and significance to the emotional experiences of the minors,
which are often unverbalized and therefore are usually enacted. These emotional and
communication skills must then be translated into purposeful and deliberate actions that
educate and repair. The educator’s position is precisely that of a “participating witness”
who constantly observes and participates even in stressful conditions associated with the
rhythms of everyday life [49].

5. Conclusions

This study extends the findings of previous research on social and health care profes-
sionals involved in the care of minors with psychosocial problems. After the pandemic,
they showed a significant deterioration in their emotional skills as well as avoidance and
emotional suppression strategies, which were strongly associated with a state of emotional
exhaustion and an associated risk of burnout [14].

This professional group has the peculiarity of defining itself as a health profession
that simultaneously performs a care and support function. The literature shows that
the professions most likely to develop burnout symptoms are precisely those in which
relationships are helpful and supportive.

The quality of professional life of social and healthcare workers who work with
minors suffering from psychosocial problems is influenced at different levels by individual
resources, regardless of knowledge and skills. This study was also conducted during a
period following the COVID-19 health emergency, which significantly altered the lives
of professionals working in care and support relationships, increasing perceptions of
stress and specific burnout symptoms such as emotional exhaustion, emotional distancing
and depersonalization, as well as a decrease in feelings of satisfaction and fulfilment.
Among health care professionals caring for minors, the pandemic required the use of
numerous emotional and cognitive resources. In particular, given the greater emotional
exhaustion and lower satisfaction with their work, the increase in avoidance strategies
was evident. These findings also emerged in the present study, which confirms that
these professionals experience greater fatigue and aspects of secondary traumatization
when emotional disengagement occurs and the difficulty of accepting their own emotional
responses appears.

Therefore, investing in these resources, such as appropriately strengthening coping
strategies and improving the ability to use metacognitive and emotional resources, can lead
to greater satisfaction and prevent the risk of burnout and secondary traumatization. The
quality of the work of the professionals, a good organizational network that provides ade-
quate support and regular supervision that allows the processing of emotional experiences
related to the profession are aspects recognized as protective factors for the well-being
of the operators and a better quality of intervention that promotes the well-being of the
minors involved [28,39].

Organizations operating in this field could promote awareness and understanding
of the skills associated with “knowing how to be”, as well as through digital tools that
can provide useful elements for the mental health of professionals remotely and with
flexible access and can promote social support. Supervisors could also provide models
for the effective use of strategies to manage one’s own well-being and potentially stressful
situations. Supervisors should focus on professionals’ emotional reactions to professional
challenges and encourage them to process and reflect on them, as well as pay attention to
their health and interpersonal skills [28].

Moreover, a better ability to recognize and communicate one’s emotions could facilitate
communication with colleagues with whom one shares the work with minors, with a
positive impact on collaboration and the effectiveness of the intervention; a good team
relationship makes it possible to resolve complaints and conflicts, including those related
to users’ pathologies, which could have an impact on the functioning of the team itself [50].
Appropriate spaces for reflection and sharing can modulate the maladaptive use of
avoidance and promote a relationship with the minor in which care develops through adult
and appropriate mental functioning, emotional experiences can be processed and managed,
and intervention and action can be more consciously oriented [51].
