ABSTRACT
Background: PTSD and gambling disorder (GD) are frequently comorbid. Gambling may
provide escape-based coping for the emotions experienced by PTSD suﬀerers. Military
personnel may be at increased risk of PTSD and/or GD. Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy (ACT) has been found to improve both PTSD and GD outcomes, yet research into
the potential eﬀectiveness of ACT for PTSD and/GD in veterans is scarce.
Objective: This review aimed to systematically assess and describe the evidence relating to the
use of ACT and acceptance-based therapy for military populations with PTSD and/or GD.
Method: Six databases were searched. Selection criteria included studies that featured the
armed forces/military, delivered ACT/acceptance-based therapy, and aimed to improve PTSD
and/or GD outcomes. A narrative synthesis approach was adopted.
Results: From 1,117 results, 39 studies were fully screened and 14 met inclusion criteria. All
studies originated from the USA and 9 were associated with United States Department of
Veterans Aﬀairs. Therapy use within each study produced an improvement in PTSD and/or
GD, yet only one study examined GD and no studies considered comorbid PTSD/GD. The

Conclusions: These preliminary ﬁndings are promising, yet more research is needed on the
delivery format and content of ACT sessions, and whether ﬁndings generalise beyond USA-
recruited military samples. The cost-eﬀectiveness of remote-based ACT also warrants investigation.

Terapia de aceptación y compromiso para la comorbilidad del juego
patológico y el trastorno de estrés postraumático en veteranos: una
revisión narrativa

Antecedentes: el TEPT y el juego patológico (JP) son frecuentemente comórbidos. El juego
puede proporcionar un afrontamiento basado en el escape para las emociones
experimentadas por los pacientes con TEPT. El personal militar puede tener un mayor riesgo
de TEPT y/o JP. Se ha encontrado que la Terapia de Aceptación y Compromiso (TAC) mejora
los resultados tanto del TEPT como del JP, sin embargo, la investigación sobre la efectividad
potencial de la TAC para el TEPT y/JP en veteranos es escasa.
Objetivo: Esta revisión tuvo como objetivo evaluar y describir sistemáticamente la evidencia
relacionada con el uso de TAC y la terapia basada en la aceptación para poblaciones
militares con TEPT y/o JP.
Método: Se realizaron búsquedas en seis bases de datos. Los criterios de selección
consideraron estudios que incluyeron a las fuerzas armadas/militares, administraron TAC/
terapia basada en la aceptación y tenían como objetivo mejorar los resultados del TEPT y/o
JP. Se adoptó un enfoque de síntesis narrativa.
Resultados: De 1.117 resultados, 39 estudios fueron evaluados completamente y 14
cumplieron con los criterios de inclusión. Todos los estudios se originaron en los EE. UU. y 9
se asociaron con el Departamento de Asuntos de Veteranos de los Estados Unidos. El uso de
la terapia dentro de cada estudio produjo una mejora en el TEPT y/o el JP; sin embargo,
solo un estudio examinó el JP y ningún estudio consideró el TEPT/JP comórbido. La amplia
gama de diseños de estudio diﬁcultó comparar los hallazgos o hacer generalizaciones a
partir de los resultados colectivos. No está claro qué método de entrega de TAC es superior
(basado en aplicaciones, telesalud, cara a cara, grupos, uno a uno, manualizado o no
estructurado), o cuál es el verdadero tamaño del efecto de TAC para TEPT y/ o JP.

Conclusiones: Estos hallazgos preliminares son prometedores, pero se necesita más
investigación sobre el formato de entrega y el contenido de las sesiones de TAC, y si los
hallazgos se generalizan más allá de las muestras militares reclutadas en EE. UU. La
rentabilidad de TAC a distancia también merece una investigación.

1. Introduction

Gambling disorder (GD) involves persistent and reoc-
curring gambling behaviour resulting in clinical levels
of past-year distress and signiﬁcant functional impair-
ment (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Bow-
den-Jones et al., 2022; Wardle et al., 2019). GD is
frequently comorbid with post-traumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD) (Dowling et al., 2015; Etuk et al., 2020;
Moore & Grubbs, 2021). While GD and PTSD may
share a common aetiology or arise in response to simi-
lar environmental antecedents, it is possible to con-
the
ceive
psychological symptoms associated with traumatic
experience (Blaszczynski & Nower, 2002; Buchanan
et al., 2020; Etuk et al., 2020). Indeed, the DSM-5 diag-
nostic criteria specify that disordered gambling likely
occurs during distress and a key symptom of PTSD
is psychological distress
(American Psychiatric
Association, 2013). In eﬀect, disordered gambling
may function as a form of experiential avoidance in
coping with PTSD symptoms such as emotional dysre-
gulation (Dighton et al., 2022; Hayes et al., 2012).

Moore and Grubbs (2021) reviewed 74 studies
relating to gambling and comorbid PTSD, 19 of
which reported that PTSD symptom severity was
linked to GD and not simply a PTSD diagnosis. A
population particularly susceptible to developing
GD, due in part to their increased risk of trauma-
related PTSD, are military personnel (Etuk et al.,
2020; Sharman et al., 2019). Disordered gambling in
the military is under-researched compared with
other mental health diﬃculties (Etuk et al., 2020),
despite the likelihood of developing GD being higher
among the military compared to the general popu-
lation (van der Maas & Nower, 2021). Estimates of

the prevalence of sub-threshold GD or ‘problem gam-
bling’ suggest military status may be a signiﬁcant risk
factor (Garvey Wilson et al., 2021). Roberts et al.
(2020) found UK veterans were eight times more likely
to meet problematic gambling criteria compared to an
age/gender-matched general population sample. Like-
wise, Dighton et al. (2022) found veteran status pre-
dicted an increased risk of problem gambling
together with the use of gambling as an escape- or
avoidance-based coping mechanism (see also, Dighton
et al., 2018). A recent survey of 3511 Australian mili-
tary veterans assessed for GD ﬁve years post-military
service found that 4.6% had experienced problematic
gambling, with a further 8.8% classiﬁed as ‘at risk’
(Metcalf et al., 2022). Military-related trauma, such
trauma, may
as operational or post-deployment
account for the relationship between military aﬃlia-
tion and GD (Cowlishaw et al., 2020; Whiting et al.,
2016) with the risk of developing GD as a veteran
remaining high after military service ends (Metcalf
et al., 2022).

Notwithstanding the impact of trauma and the
increased risk of PTSD, veterans are also likely to
to help-seeking (Murphy
report greater barriers
et al., 2016). The most commonly cited reasons for
non-help seeking include perceived stigma and the
practical accessibility of support (Hom et al., 2017;
Kantor et al., 2017; Possemato et al., 2018). The
increased availability of opportunities to gamble
nowadays, the stigma associated with disordered gam-
bling, and the tendency for veterans to use gambling to
cope with the consequences of trauma may combine
and prompt lower levels of help-seeking (Paterson
et al., 2021). Mental health diﬃculties related to
PTSD and GD may thus go undetected among
veterans.

If military populations are to have their complex
mental health needs fully supported, it is essential to
use evidence-based interventions that target PTSD
and/or GD. Acceptance and commitment therapy
(ACT) may be beneﬁcial in managing the symptoms
and sequela of PTSD and GD among the military (Shi-
pherd et al., 2016; Shirk et al., 2022). ACT is a third-
wave behaviour therapy that aims to enhance one’s
ability to connect with and mindfully accept all
psychological and emotional experiences. The empha-
sis within ACT is that suﬀering arises in large part due
to repeated attempts to avoid uncomfortable sen-
sations and experiences; instead, ACT promotes the
avoiding of avoidance itself (Thompson et al., 2021).
To do this, ACT promotes ‘psychological ﬂexibility’
through a series of structured components and experi-
ential exercises (Daar & Dixon, 2015; Gloster et al.,
2020; Hayes et al., 2012) such as reﬂecting on values,
being in the present moment, acceptance versus
change, and commitment to act in alignment with
one’s values and goals. ACT does not encourage cli-
ents to ‘think’ their way out of a diﬃcult experience
or
emotional dysregulation. Rather,
client are encouraged to accept troubling experiences
and to change how they relate to such experiences/
emotions.

episode of

The use of acceptance strategies over avoidant-
based coping within PTSD treatment has utility
given that avoidance is often a main driver of PTSD.
ACT has produced positive outcomes for military
populations suﬀering PTSD, outperforming psychoe-
ducation and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in
reducing PTSD symptom scores for 1524 active
duty, previously deployed US soldiers (Shipherd
et al., 2016). Similarly, ACT has led to a reduction in
problematic gambling for treatment-seeking US mili-
tary veterans (Shirk et al., 2022), with emotional dys-
regulation scores also seeing improvement. Due to
its utility, ACT has been endorsed as a supportive,
transdiagnostic therapy by the US Veterans Aﬀairs
Administration (VA; Thompson et al., 2021) and its
empirical status is growing (Gloster et al., 2020).
Despite the co-occurrence of PTSD and gambling
and the relative eﬀectiveness of ACT on separate
PTSD and GD outcomes, little is currently known
about its usefulness in military populations.

The aim of the present study was to systematically
search and review the literature on the use of ACT
and acceptance-based therapies to treat PTSD and/or
problematic gambling/GD in veterans.

2.1. Search strategy

In April 2022, six databases were searched, including
CINHAL, Embase, Medline, PsychInfo, PTSDPubs
and Scopus. Databases were searched with no
upper date limit using the following MESH headings
and terms: (military OR armed forces OR veterans)
AND (acceptance and commitment OR acceptance-
based OR commit* OR accept* OR refram* OR
present moment) AND (gambl* OR PTSD OR post-
stress OR
stress OR post-traumatic
traumatic
post traumatic stress). Previous systematic reviews
related to similar topics were searched and the refer-
ence lists of articles within the ﬁnal review also
screened.

2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were included if they met the following cri-
teria: featured military or armed forces populations
(including serving military personnel, veterans, and
reservists), were focused on ACT or included an
ACT-based component (e.g. reframing, psychological
ﬂexibility, acceptance), had a goal of reducing disor-
dered or problematic gambling and/or PTSD symp-
and were peer-reviewed empirical
toms/scores
articles written in English.

Studies were excluded if they did not isolate mili-
tary populations (i.e. it was not possible to determine
any eﬀect on the military speciﬁcally where the general
population had been used as a comparison group) and
if it was not possible to ascertain that ACT or ACT-
based interventions had impacted gambling and/
PTSD speciﬁcally (e.g. where outcomes were unre-
‘improved mental
ported or generalised to, say,
health’). There were no restrictions concerning date
range or study design.

2.3. Screening

Titles and abstracts were screened from all identiﬁed
sources, followed by an in-depth review of a selection
of articles to ensure study suitability (Figure 1). Ten
per cent of titles, abstracts and full papers were
the
screened/reviewed by a second member of
research team for quality cross-checking.

2.4. Extraction and quality

Bespoke data extraction sheets were created and
piloted. Data was extracted relating to the study objec-
tives, participants, country of origin, design, results or
ﬁndings, salient discussion points, generalisability,
limitations, funding, and ethics. Quality was assessed
by referring each article to an appropriate Joanna
Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool, relative
to its study design (JBI, 2022).

2.5. Data synthesis

3.1. Study demographics and characteristics

It was anticipated that any quantitative studies
identiﬁed would lack suﬃcient homogeneity to con-
duct a meta-analysis. Furthermore, as qualitative
articles could be captured within the review, it was
considered more appropriate to synthesise all
ﬁndings via a narrative synthesis. A collective con-
sideration and comparison of multiple studies
could be summarised descriptively. One study con-
tained qualitative data from a mixed-methods
design (Reyes et al., 2020b) and thus there was no
need to transform any ﬁndings in an integrated,
aggregated manner.

3. Results

A search of the literature identiﬁed 1117 results.
The number of duplicates removed was 448, leav-
ing 669 titles and abstracts to be screened. A full
review was conducted on 39 papers and 14 studies
were selected for review inclusion (Table 1).

All studies originated from the USA, with nine
recruiting participants via the VA,
two recruited
active members of
the military (Blevins et al.,
2011; Shipherd et al., 2016) – with Blevins et al.
focusing on guardsmen – while a further three
studies
(Reyes
featured veteran college students
et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2022).

The collective number of participants across the
review was 2440, yet the participant pools varied
from a single participant to n = 1542. Nine studies fea-
tured participant pools n < 50 whereas three studies
had three or less. Males represented 86.20% of all par-
ticipants, with 52.71% being married/cohabiting,
57.82% identifying as white and 18.28% being of
black ethnicity. Of those studies that reported mean
age, the overall age was M = 34.21 (SD = 7.31). Military
service was predominantly with the army during the
Iraq/Afghanistan era. Only Ramirez et al. (2021)
reported length of
service; M = 15.0 (SD = 7.87)
(Table 1).

3.2. PTSD/GD diagnosis

Only Shirk et al. (2022) included an unreferenced
assessment of gambling behaviour (frequency, craving
and self-eﬃcacy). Frequency and self-eﬃcacy were
assessed via a 7-point Likert scale. Craving intensity
was scored by a 5-point Likert scale and the number
of cravings was recorded via a ‘free text’ number.

The likelihood of having PTSD was featured within
all 14 studies but some detail of PTSD screening pro-
cedures/tools were absent. Where PTSD assessment
was discussed, most studies referred to the DSM-IV
or DSM-5 and screened PTSD with a version of the
PCL (Weathers et al., 2013). Ramirez and colleagues
(2021) included the PDS-5 and PSSI-5 diagnostic
and symptom severity scales and CAPS-5 was used
by Meyer et al. (2018). Two studies described using
versions of the SCID (1 & 5) interview to diagnose
PTSD and the MINI interview was utilised by Lang
et al. (2017). There was, therefore, considerable vari-
ation across the studies in the assessment of PTSD.

3.3. Study design/objective(s)

As shown in Table 1, Kelly et al. (2020), Shirk et al.
(2022) and Smith et al. (2021) reported case studies
of groups of three veterans (Shirk et al.) or studies
based on n = 1. Smith et al. explored the utility of tele-
health via video conferencing with assessment
measures obtained one- and three-months post-
intervention.

Five studies were described as pilot/feasibility
studies (Table 1). Reyes et al. examined the acceptabil-
ity and utility of an app-based intervention to reduce
PTSD symptoms across three articles. Wharton et al.
(2019) assessed the eﬀectiveness of in-person, group-
based therapy and individual-based therapy to reduce
PTSD, with a diﬀerent cohort recruited for each con-
dition. Meyer et al. (2018) assessed the eﬀectiveness of
in-person, individual ACT-based sessions to reduce
PTSD. Dindo et al. (2020) conducted a randomised
control trial (RCT) to compare the eﬀectiveness of
an ACT-based workshop with a ‘treatment as usual’
(TAU) condition for improving PTSD (and other
comorbidities).

Two additional studies adopted an RCT design
(Table 1). Lang and colleagues (2017) compared the
outcome of an ACT-based approach with a ‘person-
centred therapy’ (PCT) condition to reduce emotional
distress (note that PTSD was captured under the term
‘emotional distress’, together with depression, suicidal
behaviour and anger). In contrast, Shipherd et al.
(2016) compared four separate conditions (treatment
‘change’-based
as usual
therapy and ‘acceptance-based’ therapy) to establish
which was the most eﬀective to reduce cognitive intru-
sions and PTSD symptoms.

Of those studies labelled quasi-experiments, Blevins
and colleagues (2011) and Ramirez et al. (2021)
adopted pre–post-test designs but had other diﬀer-
ences. Blevins and colleagues included a control con-
dition (TAU),
to ascertain whether ACT-based
training would out-perform TAU in the context of
PTSD symptomology and post-deployment adjust-
ment. Yet, no randomisation was included. In con-
trast, Ramirez and colleagues utilised a single-arm,
pre–post-test, approach when administering their
‘blended’
therapeutic approach (exposure therapy
and ACT) to reduce PTSD.

One of the three studies by Reyes et al. was labelled
as a quasi-experiment, yet all three had similar designs
(Table 1). All three interventions had a similar dur-
ation period (two to four weeks), and outcomes were
measured across three-time points. The Reyes et al.
(2020b) study adopted a mixed-methods approach to
assess the utility and acceptability of an app-based
intervention. Quantitative data was collected via the
app and qualitative data was collected at the interven-
tion conclusion through in-person, semi-structured
interviews. All interviews were analysed with descrip-
tive content analysis.

Gobin and colleagues (2019) conducted secondary
data analysis on existing data, related to a wider-
scale RCT (Lang et al., 2017), and examined gender
diﬀerences observed in the eﬀectiveness of ACT versus
PCT.

3.4. ACT components/administration

Most interventions were described as being based on
ACT speciﬁcally, whereas some were ‘acceptance-
based’ or centred around core components of ACT
like ‘thought reframing’ (Blevins et al., 2011; Shipherd
et al., 2016; Shirk et al., 2022). Eight studies utilised a
manualised version of therapy (see Table 1). Lang et al.
(2017) compared manualised versions of ACT with
PCT. Although Ramirez et al., did not describe refer-
ring to an ACT manual, the authors used a fully struc-
tured approach to administering ACT. Both Kelly
et al., and Shirk et al., described therapy adminis-
tration as manualised but was adapted for the pur-
poses of the study. In all three Reyes et al., studies
(2020a, 2020b, 2022) therapy was administered in a
self-directed, randomised, manner. Apart from the
app-based studies, all
interventions were delivered
via a range of healthcare professionals (e.g. social
workers, psychologists) or ACT-trained facilitators.

ACT was delivered by Reyes et al. via a series of
audio recordings and videos. Four studies adminis-
tered ACT via individual therapy sessions whereas
three studies utilised a workshop group setting (see
Table 1). While Ramirez and colleagues (2021) mainly
administered their intervention to cohorts of eight to
the authors included two individual
11 veterans,

sessions in their programme. Wharton and colleagues
(2019) purposely included individual therapy and a
separate group-based setting, because their study
aimed to compare the eﬀectiveness of group versus
individual ACT sessions.

All

including homework,

interventions also included a variety of
‘engagement’ exercises,
jour-
naling, or reﬂective notetaking, yet not all exercises
were the same across every study. For instance, par-
ticipants in the Meyer et al., and Ramirez et al.,
interventions were permitted to record their sessions
to assist with engagement activities and for future
therapeutic use.

There was great variability over intervention dur-
ation. The Blevins et al. (2011) study was based on
therapy being delivered via a two-hour, single-session
workshop and Dindo and colleagues (2020) devel-
oped/evaluated a one-day ACT workshop. The app-
based interventions ranged from two to four weeks
and Ramirez et al.’s (2021) intervention was a six-
week programme. The most common intervention
length was 12 weeks (3 months) with Gobin et al.
(2019), Lang et al. (2017), and Meyer et al. (2018) col-
lectively referring to the same manual for intervention
administration guidance. The longest intervention was
19 weeks/ﬁve months (Smith et al., 2021).

Regarding whether therapy was successful, assess-
ment measures were generally collected pre-and
post-intervention, with some studies collecting out-
come data at a later, follow-up time point. However,
there was great variation across the studies regarding
the frequency of outcome assessment and the length
of follow-up (where one was included). For example,
Ramirez and colleagues (2021) assessed outcomes
weekly over the duration of a six-week intervention,
whereas Lang et al. (2017) measured outcomes at
ﬁve-time points over a year where the intervention
ceased at month three.

3.5. GD/PTSD outcomes

Only the Shirk et al. (2022) study aimed to consider
whether acceptance-based therapy had a positive
impact on GD. Shirk and colleagues reported that
mean scores of gambling instances, craving fre-
quency and craving intensity had decreased at fol-
low-up. Yet, the degree to which outcome scores
changed diﬀered between the three participants,
with one participant reporting an increase in craving
intensity at follow-up. Overall, mean impulsivity and
emotional dysregulation scores reduced across the
intervention.

All other studies examined PTSD outcome scores.
Collectively, all studies found intervention engage-
ment led to a reduction in PTSD scores. Where
ACT, or acceptance-based treatment, was compared
two studies found
with an alternative treatment,

ACT outperformed other treatments (e.g. cognitive
approaches, psychoeducation or TAU; Dindo et al.,
2020; Shipherd et al., 2016). Yet, two studies found
no diﬀerence between the ACT condition and the
comparison condition (TAU versus acceptance; Ble-
vins et al., 2011) or person-centred therapy (PCT) ver-
sus ACT (Lang et al., 2017). However, concerning
Lang and colleagues’ study, when Gobin and col-
leagues (2019) conducted secondary analysis on the
data they found gender diﬀerences: ACT did signiﬁ-
cantly out-perform PCT in reducing PTSD outcomes
for females only (d = 1.20). Finally, Wharton and col-
leagues (2019) examined whether individual ACT or
group-based ACT sessions reduced PTSD. There
were signiﬁcant reductions in PTSD scores and
PTSD symptom cluster indicators (p < .05, g = 0.69–
1.18) but diﬀerences between intervention contexts
were not compared.

Whether ACT or acceptance-based therapy would
positively impact PTSD cluster symptoms (or select
symptoms) was featured in six studies. Kelly et al.
(2020) and Wharton and colleagues (2019) considered
all PTSD symptom clusters. Wharton et al., found
both group and individual therapy settings correlated
with a reduction in avoidance scores, whereas therapy
in a one-to-one context seemed to improve hyperar-
ousal as well as avoidance. In contrast, Kelly and col-
leagues
(2020) noted ACT improved negative
thoughts only; no impact was noted for intrusion or
avoidance cluster symptoms. Six studies speciﬁcally
focused on the PTSD cluster symptom of experiential
avoidance (Meyer et al., 2018; Ramirez et al., 2021;
Reyes et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2022; Smith et al., 2021).
Of
these studies, all except Reyes et al. (2020a)
reported an improvement in experiential avoidance
scores.

ranged

from d = 0.09–1.33,

Across the studies, the reporting of outcomes var-
ied. The most frequently reported outcome was a
reduction in mean scores. Eight studies described stat-
istical signiﬁcance, ﬁve reported 95% conﬁdence inter-
vals, and seven articles included eﬀect sizes (either
Cohen’s d or Hedges’ g). The eﬀect size of accep-
tance-based therapy on PTSD, or clusters of symp-
toms,
g = 1.184.
Concerning the PTSD symptom cluster of experiential
the positive eﬀect of acceptance-based
avoidance,
therapy was d = 0.62–0.88. Reyes and colleagues
(2020b) and Smith et al. did not provide data relating
to their avoidance-speciﬁc ﬁndings. Shirk et al. (2022)
included emotional dysregulation in their GD study
and found a 4.3 mean reduction in scores. The three
app-based studies included a measure of acceptability
or useability, regarding the utility of an app-based
intervention. The utility/satisfaction-based indicators
suggest users rated app-based therapy from M =
72.75-85.11, with 85.58 equating to ‘excellent’ (Reyes
et al., 2020a).

3.6. Research quality/robustness

or

Drop-outs

All studies were reported in the convention associated
with speciﬁc study designs. Nine studies described
recruitment akin to convenience sampling, while the
remainder did not describe the recruitment method
employed. Two of the three RCTs included randomis-
ation methods but Dindo et al. (2020) did not. Many
authors acknowledged the limitation of not including
a control group, despite several experiments having
multiple conditions. Where participants were situated
in diﬀerent conditions, three studies statistically com-
pared the demographic data of each condition (Blevins
et al., 2011; Dindo et al., 2020; Shipherd et al., 2016).
non-completers were mainly
explained or acknowledged, with two studies statisti-
cally comparing the demographics of completers and
non-completers (Lang et al., 2017; Meyer et al.,
2018). Power analysis was reported in three studies
(Dindo et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2018; Ramirez
et al., 2021) with several authors commenting that
their smaller sample sizes likely led to the analysis
being underpowered. Two studies evaluated the
cost–beneﬁt of
interventions (Dindo et al., 2020;
Reyes et al., 2022). Funding sources and ethics
approval/consent were largely underreported; indeed,
only eight studies described participants as having
provided informed consent (Blevins et al., 2011;
Dindo et al., 2020; Lang et al., 2017; Reyes et al.,
2020a, 2020b, 2022; Shipherd et al., 2016).

Table 2 describes the JBI (2022) quality criteria
scores for all articles. Each study was scored against
the list of criteria associated with its corresponding
study design and additional items assessing the pres-
ence of ethical approval and informed consent were
included. Scores were rated 3 (Yes), 2 (Unclear), 1
(No), and 0 (Not applicable) for the presence/absence
of each feature. As Table 2 shows, scores ranged
between 25 (Smith et al., 2021) to 46 (Gobin et al.,
2019; Lang et al., 2017).

4. Discussion

This review set out to assess the ACT evidence base,
in the context of
relating to military populations,
both stand-alone and co-occurring PTSD and GD.
We found 14 studies that met inclusion criteria,
which is a relatively small pool of published articles
and indicates this area remains relatively under-inves-
tigated. Only one article (a case study) was GD-
speciﬁc, and no study directly addressed co-occurring
GD and PTSD. Although extant military-speciﬁc lit-
erature exists, most publications relate to predictors
or correlates of PTSD/GD rather than treatment inter-
ventions or symptom management (Moore & Grubbs,
2021; Sharman et al., 2019). Moreover, the publi-
cations that focus on PTSD and/or GD interventions

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY

9

do not include ACT or acceptance-based approaches
(Etuk et al., 2020; Levy & Tracy, 2018). A salient
ﬁnding of this review is that both GD and comorbid
GD and PTSD are largely under-studied, which is con-
cerning as the relationship between GD and PTSD
among military populations is robust (Dighton et al.,
2022).

All 14 studies collectively found that

therapy
reduced GD or PTSD scores, with a score reduction
indicating a PTSD symptom improvement. Only Ble-
vins et al. (2011) saw no diﬀerence between ACT and
the comparison control condition. Across the remain-
ing 13 studies, ACT outperformed all other forms of
therapy where an alternative condition was included.
If no control condition was included, ACT positively
impacted PTSD scores, often beyond the intervention
conclusion. ACT positively impacted some but not all
PTSD cluster symptoms, where symptom level assess-
ments were made. Shirk et al. (2022) reported GD
score changes solely at a symptom level rather than
providing global GD scores. Emotional dysregulation
saw a reduced mean score from 56.3–40.0 out of a
maximum 90, which is promising if emotional dysre-
gulation is a key component of disordered gambling.
The PTSD and GD ﬁndings collectively have merit
as they oﬀer preliminary evidence to support the use-
fulness of ACT to improve GD and PTSD at both a
global and symptom level. Reported intervention
eﬀect sizes did vary substantially (d = 0.09–1.33, g =
1.184), making it diﬃcult to draw impact size infer-
ences from the studies.

4.1. Context of ACT delivery

The context in which ACT was delivered (i.e. technol-
ogy, group, and one-to-one) was not directly com-
pared by any study. It would be useful therefore to
understand whether remote-delivered therapy per-
forms as well as or out-performs ACT administered
in-person. Moreover, group therapy could oﬀer cost-
saving beneﬁts and could reach more people who
spend limited time at a single location, such as military
personnel attending a military base for mandatory
training or a local VA centre for veterans’ healthcare
support (Blevins et al., 2011). Similarly, technology
has the additional beneﬁt of reaching those more
resistant to help-seeking, such as veterans (Augner
et al., 2022; Hom et al., 2017).

ACT interventions delivered via digital/electronic/
internet-based methods (eHealth or iTherapy) have
produced positive results. For instance, Thompson
et al.’s (2021) review of internet-based ACT (iACT)
to address poor mental health in an
literature,
undeﬁned population, found mental health assess-
ment measures improved via digital ACT and were
maintained at follow-up. Reger et al. (2022) also
noted some positive results in the context of ‘PTSD

Coach’ use, a mobile application support for mental
health in veterans. Of the 20.4% that had used one
of the 22 VA mental health apps, 7.5% of PTSD
patients had engaged with the PTSD coach app. Fur-
thermore, another app, Mindfulness Coach, was
used by 6.5% of VA users to support poor mental
health, which has merit within this study’s ﬁndings
as ACT is a ‘mindfulness-based’ approach.

It could be inferred that if veterans found mindful-
ness apps acceptable and useful, they may have a simi-
lar response to an ACT-based app, or an ACT
intervention delivered via a mobile application.
Reyes et al. (2022) noted the main cause of app non-
engagement was a lack of app awareness rather than
iACT being ineﬀective. Relatedly, a recent UK ran-
domised trial concerning CBT rather than ACT, it
did ﬁnd that online therapy was as eﬀective as face-
to-face therapy in improving PTSD outcomes in a
general population sample (Bisson et al., 2022). The
continued use of technology to support those with
addictive disorders does however require further care-
ful consideration; indeed, it is possible that some users
may ﬁnd engagement with support services delivered
virtually to be triggering if some or all of their proble-
matic addictive behaviours such as gambling were also
conducted virtually. Addressing this challenge war-
rants further empirical and clinical attention.

One point of contextual diﬀerence noted between
the ACT interventions in this review was that the
app-based studies delivered therapy via unstructured,
random methods while many of
the face-to-face
studies delivered manualised, guided versions of
ACT. Presumably, manualised ACT did not align
with app-based therapy, yet no explanation was pro-
vided as to why random therapy was embedded in
the app context. Despite the three app-based studies
(Reyes et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2022) producing reduced
PTSD scores, and strong app usability/acceptability
scores, qualitative data (2020b) found that veteran
users would have preferred guided therapy. This aligns
with Thompson et al. (2021) who found eighteen
studies indicating that guided therapy was particularly
eﬀective. Arguably, it would be particularly useful to
deliver a manualised, guided form of ACT when sup-
porting a military population, as many are likely more
familiar with following a structured, guided pro-
gramme than self-delivered.

4.2. Limitations

There are several limitations of the present review. The
variation between study designs made it diﬃcult to
compare ﬁndings. Although sample sizes were appro-
priate, many were too small to make generalisations.
Furthermore, no longitudinal, follow-up data were
collected. There were limited RCTs, and very little evi-
dence of control groups used. It would be useful to

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY

further RCT research on the diﬀerences
conduct
between context delivery of ACT. Only one study
employed a mixed-methods design, highlighting a
research gap in understanding the lived experience
of veterans with co-occurring PTSD and GD. Future
research may also ask veterans if using technology to
support GD may be triggering for their gambling,
and if so, what other ACT delivery methods may be
appropriate. Consensus-building with a range of sta-
keholders should inform future ACT interventions.
All research and participants originated from the US
and further work is needed to understand the inter-
national diﬀerences, if any, in veterans’ coping with
PTSD and GD (Randles & Finnegan, 2022).

4.3. Conclusions

The use of ACT, whether in-person or remote-based
may oﬀer beneﬁts for veterans suﬀering from PTSD
and/or GD. However, there is a paucity of current evi-
dence on this topic and a great deal further research is
warranted. Although iACT and other remote delivery
forms of therapy may increase engagement with hard-
to-reach populations like military veterans with co-
occurring PTSD and GD, the potential triggering
eﬀects of these approaches for individuals with GD
should be fully considered. Overall, we identiﬁed a
limited evidence base, particularly from non-US
samples, with many gaps in the literature on ACT-
based intervention for veterans with co-occurring
PTSD and GD.
