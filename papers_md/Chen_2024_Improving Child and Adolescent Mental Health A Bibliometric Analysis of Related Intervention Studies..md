Abstract: In response to the increase in adolescent mental health problems, related intervention
research has flourished. This study examined 2258 mental health intervention studies captured by the
Web of Science, focusing on their distribution, interdisciplinary collaboration, and emerging trends,
using bibliometric analysis. Our findings revealed a rise in studies and enhanced collaboration
across disciplines, with studies from the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom showing
high academic output, intellectual impact, and strong scientific partnerships. However, there is a
noticeable Western-centrism in the research. Identifying current trends and key areas of focus offers
valuable insights for future practices in child and adolescent mental health.

1. Introduction

The mental health status of children and adolescents is crucial for both their present
psychological well-being and future health outcomes [1]. Unfortunately, many children
and adolescents worldwide experience mental health issues. The interconnection between
mental health and other health conditions highlights the key fact that true health cannot
exist without mental well-being [2]. The World Health Organization estimates that over
10% of children and adolescents suffer from mental health problems. However, these issues
frequently remain unrecognized and untreated [3]. The mental health of children and
adolescents is becoming increasingly serious due to global risks such as COVID-19 and
localized conflicts [4–6]. Moreover, significant inequalities exist in child and adolescent
mental health. For instance, the highest rates of depressive symptoms were found in the
Global South [7]. Access to formal psychological health services in these regions is less than
one-fifth of that in high-income countries [8].

Over the past several decades, frontline mental health service workers, policymakers,
and researchers have made sustained efforts to improve the psychological well-being of
children and adolescents, recognizing the necessity of effective interventions [9]. Recent
mental health programs have shown the effectiveness of various interventions, includ-
ing digital mental health interventions, personalized interventions, rapid mental health
assessment instruments, and strengths-based interventions [10–13]. Despite these efforts, re-
sources and practices to promote mental health remain inadequate, especially in developing
countries [14,15].

Governments and international organizations have prioritized improving the psycho-
logical health of children and adolescents, with numerous countries placing prevention
of mental health problems on their public health and political agendas. This has resulted
in more resources for mental health interventions and a rise in related research [1,16].
Social sciences, encompassing fields such as psychology, social policy, and social work,

have faced criticism for their Western-centric orientation. This Western-centered approach
implies that a significant portion of research is predominantly focused on Western societies.
Consequently, the intervention methods developed within these disciplines often may fail
to adequately consider the diverse cultural, social, and economic contexts of non-Western
regions [17,18]. Henrich et al. describe this as WEIRD research to summarize research work
conducted in Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic countries, arguing
that non-WEIRD populations have been under-researched [19]. Understanding knowledge
production in interventions for child and adolescent mental health is crucial for effective
and efficient improvement of mental health outcomes [20], yet our understanding remains
limited. Although some studies offer overviews or systematic reviews of child and ado-
lescent mental health interventions, they frequently lack the capacity for a quantitative
analysis of knowledge development in this field [21–23].

Child and adolescent mental health interventions have been significant in both aca-
demic research and policy advocacy, as evidenced by the considerable number of articles
published in recent years. Therefore, a systematic review based on bibliometric analysis
using a large scientometric database is necessary to thoroughly examine the literature on
child and adolescent mental health interventions. Bibliometric analysis employs statistical
and computational techniques to explore various aspects of scientific activities, includ-
ing their inputs, outputs, and processes. This method is extensively utilized to analyze
knowledge structures and examine the evolution of disciplines. Additionally, it serves
as a tool for evaluating scientific output and anticipating future research trends. Further-
more, bibliometric analysis plays a crucial role in mapping knowledge production and
understanding epistemic politics [18,24]. Although more commonly applied in natural
sciences, bibliometric analysis has gained increasing attention in social sciences in recent
years [25–27].

This study addresses the following questions: Which countries or regions are most
productive in this field? What are the recent developmental trends and hotspots in this
field? How is interdisciplinary collaboration evolving? We begin by briefly introducing
our research methods, followed by a presentation of our findings in three areas: coun-
tries/regions, hotspots and trends, and interdisciplinary collaboration. We conclude with a
discussion on knowledge production and its implications for child and adolescent mental
health in practice. This review is very important because it gives us a picture of the cur-
rent research gaps and the future directions regarding child and adolescent mental health
intervention programs.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Data Filtering and Data Cleaning

We utilized the Web of Science (WoS) database, widely considered ideal for sciento-
metric analysis due to its extensive literature and rich publication data [24,28]. The data
filtering and cleansing process involved several steps. First, we used the search formula
“Topic = (mental health)” and “Topic = (child or adolescent) and (intervention or plan or
program or project)” to search within the WoS core collection. Second, document types
other than reviews and articles lacking essential analytical information, such as references,
countries, and keywords, were included. Additionally, as current analytical tools cannot
process multilingual literature simultaneously, we searched further by applying the follow-
ing criteria: “document type = (article + review)” and “language = (English)”. Third, to
ensure the accuracy of the included literature, non-intervention studies, duplicate studies,
and review articles were excluded. This selection process was conducted independently
by two authors adhering to the PRISMA statement guidelines [29] to maintain consistency
in the results. This process resulted in the inclusion of 2258 publications for scientometric
analysis. Figure 1 shows the detailed information on our data filtering process.

Figure 1. Article selection procedure. The temporal parameters of our study are from 1 January 1991
to 20 April 2024 (The earliest literature available in the WoS Core Collection dates back to 1991).

2.2. Indicators

Number of publications (NP) refers to the total publications produced by each entity.
Number of citations (NC) refers to the number of citations received by papers pub-

lished by different production entities.

Betweenness Centrality (BC) is a crucial metric for assessing the significance of con-
tributors within networks. Widely utilized in network analysis, BC quantifies a node’s
centrality by evaluating its role in facilitating communication across the network [30].
Specifically, BC is determined by calculating the number of shortest paths that traverse
a given node, connecting all vertices within the network [31]. The BC is calculated
as follows:

BCi = ∑
s̸=i̸=t

ni
st
gst

(1)

In this context, gst represents the total number of shortest paths from node s to node t,
among which ni
st is the number of shortest paths passing through node i. A higher BC value
indicates that the contributor plays a more significant “bridge” role in scientific research
networks. BC was calculated after collaboration network analysis using CiteSpace (version
6.4.R1) [32].

The Socio-demographic Index (SDI) assesses the level of development of a country or
region, calculated from indicators such as average income, education level, and fertility
rate [33]. This study utilized SDI data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database.
For overall analysis, SDI values represent the average from 1991 to 2019. For period-specific
analysis, SDI values are averaged for the periods 1991–2000, 2001–2010, and 2011–2019, as
GBD does not update SDI data beyond 2019.

2.3. Data Analytical Plan

First, we analyzed temporal trends in total publications and citations. Second, we
conducted spatial analysis of publication and citation numbers and examined scientific

cooperation between countries and regions. The Spearman correlation was used to analyze
the relationships between research activity quantity, impact, collaboration, and SDI. Third,
we analyzed interdisciplinary collaboration and its changes through network analysis [24].
Fourth, we used co-citation network analysis and burst detection in CiteSpace to identify
hotspots and research trends in child and adolescent mental health interventions.

Co-citation network analysis is a widely utilized method in bibliometric research [21].
This method constructs a complex network among scholarly works within a particular
field by examining the relationships between citing and cited literature. The underlying
premise is that citing and cited works often share a close relationship and similar academic
background [34]. Through the co-citation network, this analysis aims to identify signifi-
cant literature within the field, thereby enhancing our understanding of the intellectual
structure and influential works in the domain. Specifically, the BC value was used to
identify a “bridge” literature relevant to research hotspots in the co-citation network. Burst
detection identifies research trends and frontiers by detecting significant changes in citation
frequency [23,35]. We utilized continuous bursts from recent literature to identify emerging
research trends.

3. Results
3.1. Annual Publishing Trend

Figure 2 illustrates a significant increase in publications on child and adolescent
mental health interventions over the past three decades. This growth became particularly
pronounced after 2010, with the annual number of publications exceeding 100 after 2015
and reaching 368 in 2023 alone, yet NP declined significantly in 2021, probably because
of COVID-19 pandemic, and then the NP issued rebounded. The NC for research in
this area also saw a significant increase until 2015, suggesting a rapid rise in the impact
of these studies. The decline in citations post-2015 may be attributed to the time lag in
the dissemination of academic impact, necessitating a longer period to effectively assess
changes in research influence.

ordinate represents the number of articles published, while the left ordinate indicates the number of
articles cited. NP = number of publications. NC = number of citations.

3.2. Spatial Analysis of Knowledge Production

This section examines the geographical distribution of knowledge production in
child and adolescent mental well-being interventions, focusing on NP, NC, and academic
collaborations across countries and regions.

Many social scientists argue that there is an anglophone dominance in social science
publications [17,19,24,36], a notion partly supported by our data. From 1991 to 2024,
researchers from 101 countries and regions published work in this field, covering almost all

parts of the world. However, the distribution of these publications is uneven, as shown
in Figure 3. The United States (n = 1080), the United Kingdom (n = 477), and Australia
(n = 389) significantly outpaced all other countries. Although non-Western countries like
China, India, and South Africa have recently played vital roles in producing knowledge
on child and adolescent mental health interventions, Western countries still dominate the
overall landscape.

Figure 3. Publications for the countries/regions from 1991 to 2024. Each node represents a country or
region, with its size and color indicating the number of publications. Larger nodes and deeper colors
signify a higher volume of literature published from these countries or regions.

Similar patterns are observed in the number of citations (Figure 4). The United States,
Australia, and United Kingdom and are leaders in academic impact, with the United States
receiving more citations than the United Kingdom and Australia together. Additionally,
there is a high level of scientific cooperation among these three countries (Figure 5). Notably,
South Africa, a low-income country, maintains close scientific cooperation with United
States, Australia, and United Kingdom. This suggests a shift in research interest towards
less developed regions, where non-Western countries are emerging as significant sources of
knowledge production.

region, with its size and color indicating the number of citations from that area. Larger nodes and
deeper colors signify a higher number of citations.

A Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationships among
NP, NC, research collaborations, and the development status of countries or regions. The
Spearman correlation coefficients for the NP, NC, and BC were 0.528, 0.547, and 0.607,
respectively, indicating that higher development levels are associated with greater pro-
ductivity, research impact, and closer research collaboration. Countries with high SDI
values are concentrated in North America, Western Europe, and Oceania, consistent with
previous findings.

Figure 5. Collaborations of the countries/regions from 1991 to 2024. In this figure, each node
symbolizes a specific country or region. The size and color of the nodes are indicative of the
significance of each country or region within the collaborative networks. Specifically, larger nodes or
those with deeper colors represent countries or regions that play a more substantial role as “bridges”
in research cooperation. The connections between nodes signify collaborative relationships between
different countries or regions.

Figure 6 further visualizes the relationship between SDI and the NP, NC, and research
collaborations. We can find United States, Australia, and United Kingdom as outliers,
leading in productivity, impact, and research collaboration while belonging to the high SDI
countries. Thus, the United States, Australia, and United Kingdom are the most important
and productive triangle in child and adolescent mental health intervention with their
notable productivity, wide-ranging influence, and intensive collaborations.

3.3. Discipline Collaboration Network Analysis

To understand changes in interdisciplinary collaboration, we analyzed the status

Figure 7. Interdisciplinary cooperation network. Each node indicates disciplines, where larger
nodes represent a higher number of published papers. Edges between nodes indicate collaborative
relationships between disciplines.

In the early stage (1991–2000), the number of participating disciplines and interdis-
ciplinary collaborations was relatively small, with Psychiatry and Public Environment
and Occupational Health being dominant. The period 2001–2010 saw an increase in par-
ticipating disciplines and collaborations, including sub-disciplines like Developmental
Psychology and Clinical Psychology. The period 2011–2024 showed a significant increase
in participating disciplines and stronger interdisciplinary cooperation. The involvement of
fields such as Zoology and Music suggests an expansion of research perspectives in child
and adolescent mental health interventions.

3.4. Co-Citation Network Analysis and Burst Detection

We used co-citation analysis to reveal the overall structure of the knowledge domain
of child and adolescent mental health intervention research in a broader context. The
nodes in the co-citation network depict the underlying structure of the literature in this
field. Figure 8 depicts the co-citation network in child and adolescent mental health
intervention research, where each node represents a cited reference, and each edge signifies
a co-citation relationship. The color represents the publication date: yellow for newly
published literature and green and purple for older literature. BC was computed to identify
key literature in the network. Table 1 lists the 15 papers with the highest BC values,
reflecting research hotspots in this field.

Internet-based and other computerized psychological treatments for adult
depression: a meta-analysis

First, the book, Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, edited by the Amer-
ican Psychiatric Association and published in 2011 had the highest BC, showing that it
served as a crucial node linking multiple studies. Second, the study with the second highest
BC was Psychological and educational interventions for preventing depression in children and
adolescents (author: Merry et al., published in 2011), which reviewed fifty-three studies on
intervention for depression among children and adolescents and found that many interven-
tions applied cognitive behavioral therapy and emphasized the importance of placebo in
future interventions .

Table 2 lists the 15 papers that will remain of high interest until 2024, analyzed by
burst detection, and reflected the research trends in this field. The paper, Global Preva-
lence of Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms in Children and Adolescents During COVID-19: A
Meta-analysis, published by Racine et al. had the strongest of burst strength. This study,
encompassing 80,879 children and adolescents across 29 studies, found that the global
prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among this group has doubled during
COVID-19, particularly among girls . The study titled “School-based depression and anxiety
prevention programs for young people: A systematic review and meta-analysis” by Werner-Seidler
et al., published in 2016, demonstrated the second-strongest burst strength in its findings.
This suggests that refining school-based prevention programs holds significant potential
for reducing the mental health burden among students .

4. Discussion
4.1. Interdisciplinary Collaboration

Mental health issues such as depression have complex causes that encompass bio-
logical, social, economic, and cultural factors [64–67]. To improve the effectiveness of
psychological well-being interventions for children and adolescents, interdisciplinary col-
laboration is increasingly advocated [50,68]. Although not all intervention programs cur-
rently involve multiple disciplines, interdisciplinary collaboration is becoming a trend in
this research area as shown in the present review. For instance, Hoagwood and colleagues
combined Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with adaptive riding to develop the RiA in-
tervention course, which effectively reduced mild to moderate anxiety in adolescents aged
6–17 years [69]. Another example is Rap Music Therapy (RMT), an interdisciplinary col-
laboration between psychology and music, which has been shown to regulate adolescents’
emotions effectively [70].

4.2. Inequality in Knowledge Production

Examining knowledge production in child and adolescent mental health intervention
necessitates a reflexive approach. Children and adolescents in global south counties face
more severe mental health issues [7], compared to the global average, yet progress in
intervention research in these countries has been relatively limited. Undoubtedly, this is not
conducive to alleviating the overall mental well-being plight of children and adolescents
globally.
In general, research on child and adolescent mental health interventions is
rife with Western-centrism. Non-Western countries and researchers face the following
dilemmas: firstly, non-Western populations are understudied [19,71]. Secondly, Western-
centrism implies not only academic hierarchies in terms of knowledge producers and sites
of production, but also in terms of the language used. Non-English-speaking scholars are
under pressure to become multilinguals and citizens of the world; they must learn and
follow the rules of Western scholarship in their enquiry and production of knowledge and
seek to publish in English [72]. Thirdly, there exists a clear “academic dependency” where
non-Western social scientists rely on Western theorists, creating a global intellectual division
of labor. In this arrangement, Western scholars primarily engage in theorizing, while others

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 1576

11 of 17

focus on data collection [25,73,74]. Despite these challenges, non-Western researchers
are striving to challenge Western-centrism and promote localized intervention research.
The P.A.T.H.S. and Tin Ka Ping P.A.T.H.S. programs are notable examples, combining
Chinese Confucian cultural values with positive youth development theories. These
programs have been implemented in Hong Kong and mainland China for over a decade,
benefiting over 300,000 students in Hong Kong alone [68,75]. Evaluations indicate that
these programs enhance participants’ well-being and reduce mental health risks [76,77].
The Tin Ka Ping P.A.T.H.S. program was originally intended for urban schools in Chinese
mainland. Use of the Tin Ka Ping P.A.T.H.S. in rural area has also shown positive outcomes
in poor mountainous areas [78]. The P.A.T.H.S. program was the only Chinese initiative
recognized globally for effectively improving adolescents’ mental health [79]. Despite these
successes, more work is needed to advance research on child and adolescent mental health
interventions and amplify non-Western voices.

There are three possible factors contributing to the inequality of studies between the
West and non-Western worlds. First, more studies in the West can simply be regarded as a
reflection of the more serious adolescent mental health problems in the West. Such higher
figures may also be due to more sensitive catchment (such as more professionals for school
children) and higher stress in the urban and industrialized Western world [80–83]. Second,
more research in the West may be a reflection of the greater emphasis these countries place
on the welfare of children and adolescents, as reflected in the more holistic and integrated
policies on children and adolescent mental health. In non-Western countries, child mental
health policies are rather disjointed [14,15,81]. Finally, the abundance of research in Western
societies is simply due to the fact that there are more leading universities in these places.
These are exciting possibilities for future research.

4.3. Hotspots and Trends

Our study used co-citation analysis and burst detection to identify key topics in child
and adolescent mental health interventions. The emerging hotspots and trends include
digital interventions, theoretical and practical aspects of mental health interventions, and
research methods.

Digital or internet interventions use technology to expand face-to-face intervention
scenarios and tools [51,84]. These interventions have gained popularity due to their cost-
effectiveness and efficiency [42,61]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, digital interventions
were essential for addressing severe mental wellbeing issues in children and adolescents
when face-to-face interventions were not possible [85]. Evidence suggests that digital
interventions effectively alleviate psychosocial problems at the population level [86,87].
Since November 2022 when ChatGPT, an AI assistant developed by Open AI, was gener-
ated, AI has seen a surge in development, and we are moving towards an era of highly
developed AI [88]. For child and adolescent psychological digital intervention, AI brings
new opportunities [89]. How to rationally use the advantages of the big model to develop
new digital intervention products is the question we must answer now and for a long
time to come. Obviously, evidence-based intervention plays a crucial role in validating
such interventions. Nonetheless, in today’s highly digitized world, we face an equally
stark digital divide [90]. Making the fruits of digital interventions more equally available
to children and adolescents globally is another issue that we need to face. Again, this
observation echoes the use of an interdisciplinary approach to address child and adolescent
mental health issues.

CBT addresses negative emotions by influencing cognition and behavior through
various psychological strategies [91]. Empirical evidence supports CBT’s effectiveness in
improving adolescent mental health [92,93]. The National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence (NICE) recommends CBT as the primary treatment for depression in children
and adolescents [94]. Recent advancements in digital interventions and interdisciplinary
approaches have enriched traditional CBT [95]. However, the high cost of CBT has led to
calls for reducing treatment costs or developing alternative treatments [42]. School-based

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 1576

12 of 17

interventions and mental health prevention programs are recognized as cost-effective
alternatives [40,47,49].
In addition, CBT faces the problem of cultural sensitivity; for
example, the basic extent of CBT may conflict with some religious concepts [96].

In addition, interventions based on Positive Youth Development (PYD) theory are
experiencing rapid growth. As a theoretical perspective, PYD has spawned a range of
theoretical models, intervention strategies, and successes in the field of practice. Unlike
the ‘deficit’ perspective, which emphasizes the problems that adolescents exhibit in their
development, PYD emphasizes adolescents’ talents, strengths, interests, and developmental
potential, viewing them as valuable resources for social development [97]. PYD focuses on
the holistic development of adolescents rather than focusing on just one issue in adolescent
development, as well as the environment in which adolescents live and how they grow,
learn, and change [98]. Inspired by PYD, a large number of intervention projects have
been implemented within the Social Emotional Learning (SEL) framework. The result
of meta-analysis found that SEL interventions can effectively improve mental well-being
among children and adolescents [41,99]. Although a large number of PYD intervention
projects have been or are being implemented globally, the vast majority of projects are in
WEIRD countries [17].

The validity of social sciences has long been questioned when compared to natural
sciences [100]. The concept of evidence-based medicine has permeated social sciences,
emphasizing the importance of evidence-based approaches [101]. Evaluating intervention
effects and designing normative intervention programs are crucial for evidence-based
social science. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analysis techniques have
evolved, allowing for more objective assessments of intervention programs [102,103]. RCTs
are the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions and are extensively
used in child and adolescent mental health [104–106]. Most intervention studies have
been conducted in a limited number of sites and populations, and it has become an
important issue to integrate the results of multiple studies and to comprehensively assess
the effectiveness of intervention methods. Meta-analysis is the key method for synthesizing
the results of existing intervention studies [107]. A growing number of child and adolescent
intervention researchers are conducting or considering meta-analysis [108]. In fact, a large
number of intervention studies are inadequate in terms of the rationality and reproducibility
of their intervention programs. To address this problem some guidelines and statements
have been advocated [109]. For example, the SPIRIT Group, which has launched relevant
initiatives and provided guidance to help improve the integrity and quality of intervention
programs [44]. There are many more such examples. Child and adolescent mental health
intervention research is moving towards a more standardized future.

The present study highlights that although child and adolescent mental health in-
tervention research has been fruitful, challenging Western-centrism in research, a more
rational allocation of global research resources and increased interdisciplinary collaboration
are essential to effectively address global child and adolescent mental health issues.

For frontline clinicians, it is essential to integrate the latest advances in digital inter-
ventions, CBT, and PYD interventions into child and adolescent mental health practice. We
advocate for the use of evidence-based scientific methods to incorporate these research
findings effectively. Meanwhile, researchers, particularly those from non-Western contexts,
should focus on strengthening localized mental health interventions for children and ado-
lescents with reference to local, national, and international contexts. In particular, this
approach should consider the cultural influences and practical implementation issues of
these interventions within the local context during the research process. As an example,
one can look at the application of the positive youth development approach in different
Chinese contexts is the Tin Ka Ping P.A.T.H.S. project [110].

4.4. Limitations

Our study shares limitations common to bibliometric analyses. First, it is limited
to English-language and published papers. Future studies could expand data sources

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 1576

13 of 17

to include various linguistic backgrounds, conference articles, and books. Second, our
research primarily relies on bibliographic records, making it difficult to focus on practical
research processes and the rich information behind the literature. Third, the search could
be enhanced by expanding beyond the term “mental health” to include related terms such
as “depression”, “anxiety”, and “psychological problems”, which some researchers might
use. Obviously, future studies should be conducted with more refined terms related to
mental health, such as “depression”, “anxiety disorder” and “substance abuse”. Finally, our
research is limited to evaluating published literature, making it challenging to objectively
assess ongoing intervention projects. These areas require continued attention.

5. Conclusions

This research provides a bibliometric analysis of child and adolescent mental health
interventions (1991–2024) to demonstrate the patterns and politics of knowledge production
in this field. Our findings generate three observations. Firstly, academic work on child and
adolescent mental health intervention has rapidly increased since 1991. Secondly, interdis-
ciplinary collaboration is becoming increasingly popular in child and adolescent mental
health intervention. Thirdly, research on child and adolescent mental health interventions
in the English-speaking countries, including the United States, Australia, and the United
Kingdom demonstrates remarkable academic productivity, significant intellectual influ-
ence, and strong scientific collaboration, establishing a leading role in this field. Despite its
growing importance in the field, non-Western countries, particularly China, appear to be
lagging, with a significant gap still evident.
