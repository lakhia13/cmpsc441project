Abstract

Background. Despite significant advancements in healthcare technology, digital health solu-
tions – especially those for serious mental illnesses – continue to fall short of their potential
across both clinical practice and efficacy. The utility and impact of medicine, including digital
medicine, hinges on relationships, trust, and engagement, particularly in the field of mental
health. This paper details results from Phase 1 of a two-part study that seeks to engage people
with schizophrenia, their family members, and clinicians in co-designing a digital mental
health platform for use across different cultures and contexts in the United States and India.
Methods. Each site interviewed a mix of clinicians, patients, and their family members in
focus groups (n = 20) of two to six participants. Open-ended questions and discussions
inquired about their own smartphone use and, after a demonstration of the mindLAMP plat-
form, specific feedback on the app’s utility, design, and functionality.
Results. Our results based on thematic analysis indicate three common themes: increased use
and interest in technology during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), concerns over how
data are used and shared, and a desire for concurrent human interaction to support app
engagement.
Conclusion. People with schizophrenia, their family members, and clinicians are open to inte-
grating technology into treatment to better understand their condition and help inform treat-
ment. However, app engagement is dependent on technology that is complementary – not
substitutive – of therapeutic care from a clinician.

Background

Global demand for access to mental health care is growing today despite access collapsing
(Kuehn, 2020). Rising suicide and depression rates reflect an exigent, unmet need for innova-
tive treatment options (Torous and Wykes, 2020). Despite significant advancements in health-
care technology, digital health solutions for mental health continue to fall short of their
potential across both clinical practice and in terms of clinical efficacy (Lagan, 2020a,
2020b). The utility and impact of medicine, including digital medicine, hinges on relationships
and trust, particularly in the field of mental health (Torous and Roberts, 2017). For individuals
living with serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders, establishing trust
when using digital mental health interventions is especially important given this vulnerable
population often faces significant stigma (van Zelst, 2009). This stigma can have a detrimental
impact on the quality of care they receive and may vary by culture and region (Krendl and
Pescosolido, 2020; Yin et al., 2020). Conversely, many mental health care providers report
that digital health tools are seldom created with their needs in mind, and that it is not feasible
to integrate many apps into routine clinical care settings (Bucci et al., 2019; Lattie et al., 2020).
Creating and assessing digital tools that can realize the full potential of digital health and over-
come these barriers is especially critical now as the field accelerates use of these technologies in

light of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Hasson-Ohayon
and Lysaker, 2020; Maguire and Looi, 2020).

As access to and use of smartphones and mobile internet con-
tinues to increase in many lower resource settings globally, includ-
ing in underserved regions of higher income countries such as the
United States, as well as many regions in low-income and
middle-income countries (LMICs) such as India, there may be
new opportunities to extend the reach of digital mental health
interventions. In India, for example, mobile Internet penetration
continues to increase rapidly reaching close to 450 million people
by 2023 (Kokane et al., 2019). Yet, alarmingly, there are signifi-
cant gaps between those living with mental illnesses and those
who have access to adequate care in India (Naslund et al.,
2019) where in excess of 90% of individuals living with mental
disorders do not have access to care in many regions in the coun-
try (Maulik et al., 2017). Prior studies have demonstrated that
digital technology can effectively support task sharing mental
health services in various low-resource settings, through the use
of digital tools for supporting frontline health workers with diag-
nosis, guiding clinical decision making, and facilitating supervi-
sion (Merchant et al., 2020). In India, there have been recent
successful efforts to leverage technology such as smartphone
apps, for supporting community health workers in primary care
settings, and raising awareness about mental health within rural
villages (Muke et al., 2020). However, as highlighted in a recent
review, there is limited evidence for using smartphones to support
care for individuals with severe mental disorders, such as schizo-
phrenia spectrum disorders (Powell et al., 2019). These unmet
needs are compounded by the fact that a 2020 review of the com-
mercial app stores (Apple and Google) found only two schizo-
phrenia specific apps developed with links that have been
published in publicly accessible scientific literature (Lagan et al.,
2020a).

To address this gap and to inform the implementation of
digital solutions that are both relevant to the target patient groups
and grounded in sound clinical evidence, it is necessary to engage
multiple stakeholder groups early in the design and development
process. Recently, studies have recorded and analyzed attitudes
towards integrating technology into mental health care (Berry
et al., 2017). Papers around the co-design of mental health apps
are also emerging around schizophrenia (Allan et al., 2019;
Berry et al., 2020; Realpe et al., 2020) but these all focus on
tools that are not publicly available or either focus on insights
from either care providers or care recipients – but not both. No
studies that we are aware of sought to translate apps across cul-
tures and health systems as distinct as India and the United
States. Smartphone Health Assessment for Relapse Prevention
(SHARP) is an international, digital mental health study funded
by the Wellcome Trust with the goal of increasing access to evi-
dence based and personalized mental health education and treat-
ment (Rodriguez-Villa et al., 2021). The overarching goal of this
two-phase, observational research study is to measure the efficacy
and impact of an open-source platform and smartphone applica-
tion, mindLAMP (Torous et al., 2019) in preventing relapse
among individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

This paper details the methods and results of Phase 1 of
SHARP to aggregate insights from mental health clinicians,
their
family members, and people with schizophrenia in
co-designing a digital mental health platform for use across differ-
ent cultures and contexts in the United States and India.
in this paper, we report a multi-site qualitative
Specifically,
study exploring the needs of both mental health care providers,

people with schizophrenia, and their families, and highlight
opportunities for utilizing technology towards creating trust, sus-
taining engagement, and ensuring efficacy in future clinical use
cases.
In conducting this work and publicly sharing the
mindLAMP app, we aim for results presented here to be broadly
generalizable and serve as a foundation for others seeking to
expand, improve, and iterate upon our efforts.

Objective

The purpose of Phase 1 is to engage clinicians, and people living
with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and their family members,
from three study sites distinct in culture and setting – the Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, USA, the
All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bhopal,
Institute of Mental Health and
India, and the National
Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India – in developing
new features and co-designing the mindLAMP app. To under-
stand the diverse needs of all stakeholders and to find harmony
around use of the same app in three distinct settings, we sought
to identify the features and functions most appealing as well as
learn what changes to the content or layout are necessary. The
feedback and themes collected from focus groups at all three
sites will inform both front end user interface and content, as
well as technical modifications to mindLAMP in an iterative man-
ner. Collecting data from each site will also help ensure that the
application is deployed in a manner that is culturally meaningful
in distinct settings, offering a unique viewpoint of how one app
can be customized to meet diverse local needs (Torous and
Vaidyam, 2020). In Phase 2 of this project, the mindLAMP app
will be used in a clinical study to assess its effectiveness in predict-
ing and preventing relapse in schizophrenia at the same three
sites.

Methods

Procedures

We employed thematic analysis based on grounded-theory
approach (Turner, 1981) seeking to capture the actions, interac-
tions, and processes related to use of the mindLAMP app in
relapse prevention. While many qualitative methods exist,
grounded theory has been suggested for use in guiding app devel-
opment for underrepresented mental health consumers (Leung
et al., 2016) and has been employed for technology development
for schizophrenia as well (Lindberg, 2017; Gumley et al., 2018).
Participants in Phase 1 of SHARP included clinicians, family
members, and people with schizophrenia to represent a theoretic-
ally chosen sample to best inform a complete theory. For the pur-
pose of this study, clinicians were defined as clinically trained
mental health care professionals. Starting with open categories
based on prior qualitative research and feedback from ongoing
use with the mindLAMP app, as well as an in-person discussion
and use of the app by all three teams in February 2020, data from
focus groups and its analysis were collected and conducted simul-
taneously and iteratively (Torous et al., 2019; Nebeker et al., 2020;
Saldaña, 2021).

We selected sample sizes larger than similar grounded theory
work seeking insight into designing technology systems for use in
schizophrenia (Lindberg, 2017; Gumley et al., 2018) with the goal
of ensuring saturation would occur. Sites continued focus groups
until saturation occurred as determined by the study authors,

acknowledging there is simple definition of saturation (Braun and
Clarke, 2021). Prior to beginning the focus groups, all teams in
India and Boston agreed on key exploratory questions focused
on understanding how stakeholders experience and would
interact with mindLAMP. Iterative data collection, documentation
of ideas and emerging trends, and analysis through open coding
of categories was used to develop a set of central themes. See
Appendix 1 for a script of the interview questions and Fig. 1
for examples of sample screens shared in focus groups and

interviews. Participants in focus groups were recruited through
online flyers and word of mouth recruitment among clinicians.
The app was translated into Hindi for focus groups taking place
in India, although the English version was also used.

All sites received ethics approval from respective Institutional
Review Boards. To protect the health of participants and accom-
modate social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, the
study site at the BIDMC conducted all focus groups and inter-
views over Starleaf – a HIPAA compliant videoconferencing

platform, enabling virtual meetings. At the study sites in Bhopal
and Bengaluru, focus groups were conducted both in-person
and through videoconferencing. Sites in India audiotaped focus
group discussion for obtaining raw data for transcription.

All focus groups and interviews across sites followed the same
format. After an overview of the meeting’s agenda and verbal con-
sent given by participants for virtual focus groups and written
informed consent for in-person focus groups, staff members of
the research team asked participants to describe their own smart-
phone use. Follow-up questions and discussion were guided by
interests and experiences unique to participants but addressed
activities and attitudes related to general topics summarized in
Table 1.

through surveys, games, and actigraphy sensors. During the session,
participants were allowed to download and use the app in order to
better assess its user interface and interactive features, or the app
was projected onto a screen for the moderator’s ease of explaining
navigation and app features. To facilitate access, we created a
computer-based version of the app to allow anyone to interact
with and navigate mindLAMP. Research staff encouraged partici-
pants to give specific feedback on the usefulness of features, the
look and feel of the design, and their understanding of the plat-
form’s functionality throughout the demonstration. Participants
were also given the opportunity to ask questions and offer com-
ments at the conclusion of the demonstration. Research teams
emphasized that adaptations to mindLAMP were ongoing and
invited participants to continue to share insights or apposite experi-
ences with digital health after the meeting.

Participants

BIDMC
Six focus groups for mental health care providers were conducted
by the BIDMC study site. Focus groups ranged in size from two to
six participants. Each participant was asked to complete a survey
about their technology use before the meeting. A total of 20 men-
tal health care providers participated in focus groups with
BIDMC, ranging in ages 26 to 63 with a mean age of 41. The
mental health care providers included in this study represent a
range of training, expertise, and responsibilities. A detailed break-
down of clinical roles of the mental health care providers that par-
ticipated in the focus groups at each site is outlined in Table 2.

Research staff also interviewed a combined total of 25 indivi-
duals with mental illness and their family members at BIDMC.
These participants were drawn from those in care with BIDMC
and thus illness was not assessed as an inclusion criterion.
Interviews followed the same format as focus groups and were
conducted one-on-one to protect confidentiality. people with
schizophrenia’s ages ranged from 18 to 65 with a mean age of
32 years. Interviews with these participants focused on their per-
sonal experience utilizing the mindLAMP smartphone app and
salient opportunities for improvement (Fig. 2).

The AIIMS, Bhopal
Three focus groups for mental health care providers were con-
ducted by research team at AIIMS, Bhopal. A total of 13 mental
health care providers participated in these focus groups with ages
ranging from 23 to 73 years old with a mean age of 35 years.

Research staff also held focus groups for a total of 25 indivi-
duals with mental illness and their family members. These parti-
cipants were drawn from those in care with AIIMS and thus
illness was not assessed as an inclusion criterion. people with schi-
zophrenia’s ages ranged from 23 to 42 years old with a mean age
of 33 years, and family members’ ages ranged from 23 to 72 years
old with a mean age of 50 years.

National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences,
Bengaluru
Eleven focus groups for mental health care providers were con-
ducted by research staff at NIMHANS. A total of 20 mental health
care providers participated in these focus groups with ages rang-
ing from 23 to 72 years old with a mean age of 41 years.

Research staff also held focus groups for a total of 25 indivi-
duals with mental illness and their family members. These parti-
cipants were drawn from those in care with NIMHANS and thus
illness was not assessed as an inclusion criterion. people with schi-
zophrenia’s ages ranged from 25 to 46 years old with a mean age
of 35 years, and family members’ ages ranged from 26 to 66 years
old with a mean age of 41 years.

Focus groups and interviews across study sites were docu-
mented via audio-recordings, handwritten notes, and typed
notes which were used for content and thematic analysis guided
by grounded theory outlined in Methods. After focus groups con-
cluded, each site coded emerging and extant themes. All coding of
transcripts was conducted by at least three authors at each site and
consisted of the same steps: breaking down each transcript into
discrete categories or themes; removing duplicate, redundant,
and non-relevant responses; mapping remaining themes; selecting

including:
increased use and interest in technology use during COVID-19,
need for safe and trusted data use and sharing, and supporting
app engagement through human interactions. We present signifi-
cant findings below that reflect and connect these distinct themes.
These findings helped inform adaptations to the mindLAMP app
(Table 3).

(1) COVID-19 led to an uptake of virtual therapy, presenting new
challenges and opportunities for providers and people with
schizophrenia, using technology.

Focus groups with providers were held during the coronavirus
outbreak. In light of social distancing mandates in Massachusetts,
all providers in focus groups at the BIDMC had transitioned to
virtual meetings with people with schizophrenia and colleagues.
New tools such as Zoom, Google Meet, and StarLeaf were com-
mon platforms providers at BIDMC had adopted that enabled
them to videoconference. Most providers had not used these plat-
forms to meet with people with schizophrenia prior to the pan-
demic. The adoption of videoconferencing was described by
many as ‘forced’, but most providers felt comfortable using the
new tools after one or two meetings as well as now open to further
new tools like smart-phone based or digital apps.

In discussions, providers agreed that videoconferencing
allowed them to connect with people with schizophrenia and
these virtual sessions made it possible for people with schizophre-
nia to continue treatment. However, many providers brought up
new challenges in now offering online care. The most frequent
concern was privacy. At home with family members and room-
mates in close proximity, clinicians worried that people with

schizophrenia may not be alone and thus less comfortable or will-
ing to speak candidly. Moreover, some providers felt uncomfort-
able ‘entering’ a patient’s space and conversely, felt uncomfortable
with a patient entering theirs. Nearly all providers felt that video-
conferencing made it more difficult to interpret body language
and pick up on nonverbal cues. Providers who work with chil-
dren, in particular, explained that virtual visits make it more dif-
ficult to hold a patient’s attention and that it is challenging to
eliminate distractions and control external stimuli. Providers
noted that smartphone data could offer a new information source
that would enable them to compensate for what could be lost via
video visits. However, providers noted that they would want to
understand regulations and liability governing access and use of
this data – citing they are not able to respond to constant data
streams that could be possible with mindLAMP data.

Many people with schizophrenia brought up videoconferen-
cing when asked how they use their smartphone. Similar to pro-
viders, most people with schizophrenia had not met with their
therapist over a digital platform prior to COVID-19. Attitudes
towards virtual visits differed. One person with schizophrenia
said that facetiming with his therapist was ‘better than nothing
but not nearly as good as in person’ where he is ‘able to read
them [the therapist]’ and ‘not distracted by [his own] image on

the screen’. Another person with schizophrenia, however, said that
videoconferencing was ‘almost better’ because he was less focused
on pleasing his therapist and was less distracted by their presence.

much data elicit discomfort.

Unique to the mindLAMP platform is its capacity to collect,
store, and display a range of patient data. The mindLAMP smart-
phone application collects a combination of active and passive
data from people with schizophrenia. Active data include
responses to mood and symptoms surveys, while passive data
accumulate metrics related to physical activity and phone use
from device sensors. In this sense, active data are subjective and
determined by the patient while passive data are objective and col-
lected without any direct input from the patient. A visual overview
of the mindLAMP platform can be found in Fig. 1. Both providers
and people with schizophrenia described access to some combin-
ation of active and passive data as ‘valuable’.

Among providers, several were interested in eeing passive data
from people with schizophrenia, specifically metrics on sleep pat-
terns and step count. ‘It’s an indirect measure of some (people
with schizophrenia’s) activity. Which patient may not tell but
you will get some inference from the indirect sources’, commented
a provider, highlighting how passive data presents a new source
for information on people with schizophrenia’s activities and an
alternative to self-reported activity and symptoms. Providers
also expressed that collecting passive data longitudinally might
make it easier to track the efficacy of brief
interventions.
However, when shown examples of aggregated passive data,
most providers wanted less information available to them.
Comments such as ‘I feel overwhelmed with data to begin with’
and ‘this is too much data’ were echoed across focus groups.
Although mindLAMP does not track people with schizophrenia’s
GPS location in real time but instead tracks their movement over-
time, some providers were uneasy about accessing this informa-

reiterated.

People with schizophrenia expressed more excitement viewing
their own active data. Specifically, pat people with schizophrenia
wanted to ‘see what the pattern is’ in how their mood or symp-
toms fluctuated. Most people with schizophrenia explained that
seeing how their survey answers changed day to day would help
with ‘creating awareness’ and ‘engaging with the things that were
happening in life’. Tracking mood or symptoms appealed to
most people with schizophrenia Some people with schizophrenia
added, however, that seeing fluctuations was only as helpful as fol-
low up with action items. ‘I would want there to be something I
could easily take action on’, said one person with schizophrenia.
People with schizophrenia did not express discomfort with
their data being collected, noting they felt that there were strong
protections in place to ensure their privacy. A handful of people
with schizophrenia, however, described how looking at data
may impact how they answer future surveys. One person with
schizophrenia said that if they could see their answers aggregated
as data points, they would be motivated to answer surveys with
more regularity. ‘It would incentivize me to be more accurate’, a
person with schizophrenia explained. Conversely, another person
with schizophrenia worried that they would answer surveys dis-
honestly in an attempt to improve a trend in a behavior or
mood they were able to track over time. Some providers echoed

this concern and worried that self-report surveys might be com-
pleted inaccurately. Some people with schizophrenia also com-
mented that they did not want to be reminded or shown data
that reflected a depressed or anxious state.

Although one person with schizophrenia remarked that pas-
sive data collection was ‘low key freaky’, people with schizophrenia
for the most part did not express concerns about their privacy. ‘I
know that my phone knows everything about me. Why not get it to
help me?’ remarked one person with schizophrenia.

(3) Relevance and integrated experience increase engagement.

When asked how they used their smartphone, providers and
people with schizophrenia listed similar features and applications.
Providers and people with schizophrenia described the most
engagement with native applications – apps available on their
smartphone that do not require download. Among these were
email, texting, calendar, voice calls, and alarm settings. More peo-
ple with schizophrenia than providers cited social media, games,
banking, and exercise tracking tools as frequently used apps.
Many people with schizophrenia mentioned apps they had down-
loaded or used to support mindfulness and healthy habits.
However, the extent to which people with schizophrenia engaged
with and utilized mindfulness applications was limited. ‘I don’t
have a good habit of doing it regularly, but when I do its pretty use-
ful’, a person with schizophrenia described about the regularity of
their use of a commercial application that offers meditation mod-
ules. ‘Most of the time, I’ll download it and stop using after 2 days’,
said another person with schizophrenia about applications they
download from the app store.

Many people with schizophrenia explained that they learned
about mindfulness or mental health-related apps through word
of mouth. Oftentimes, they downloaded an app following a rec-
ommendation from their provider. This aligned with focus
group discussion among providers, many of whom had recom-
mended applications to people with schizophrenia. Providers
and people with schizophrenia alike admitted that user reviews
and privacy policies had little to no impact on whether they
recommended or downloaded an app – citing lack of time as rea-
sons for not examining apps in more detail. While some providers
had recommended apps focused on clinical outcomes such as
Dialectical Behavioral Therapy diary
card or Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy applications, most providers had suggested
mindfulness applications to people with schizophrenia as a
means to minimize anxiety and help refocus energy as well as
apps for lifestyle modification such as weight loss apps. Most pro-
viders did not formally follow up with people with schizophrenia
about their experiences with or continued use of a recommended
application.

For many people with schizophrenia, monotony and imper-
sonal content deterred regular use of an application. ‘Each time
I go back, I’d have to feel like I’m seeing something new’, a person
with schizophrenia
elaborated. People with schizophrenia
described intuitive navigation, accessible language, an aesthetic-
ally pleasing design, and a sense of reward as contributing factors
towards high engagement. Most people with schizophrenia agreed
that notifications increased the likelihood that they opened an
application and that ‘being reminded to use it consistently’ spurred
habitual use.

Providers and people with schizophrenia also emphasized the
importance of training and education to optimize app use. “I
think for using the app [mindLAMP], there should be some initial,

Global Mental Health

let us say, starting lessons or starting guides… ‘how to use this
app’”. They remarked that generally an app is only useful if a
user understands its features and how to utilize them, and so
that the more comfortable a provider or patient is navigating
mindLAMP, the more likely they will be to use it.

Notably, all people with schizophrenia have expressed interest
and excitement towards using a smartphone application in con-
junction with therapy. Most people with schizophrenia said that
they would be willing – and that they would like to – share
data collected on mindLAMP with their therapist directly through
the app and or during in-person therapy. By filling out surveys
and tracking specific moods or behaviors, they would be able to
record patterns and recall feelings they might otherwise neglect
or forget in between clinical visits. ‘I have a week in between ther-
apy sessions. I find it really easy to lose the momentum and not do
the work outside of therapy. I feel like it would help me carry that
momentum from one therapy session to the next’, a person with
schizophrenia explained. People with schizophrenia echoed this
sentiment and furthered that the surveys would be a useful way
to update providers and contextualize conversations.

In discussions related to data privacy and the overall safety of
mindLAMP, government recommendations or guidelines were
not brought up by a single participant – provider or person with
schizophrenia – at BIDMC. However, in India, some providers in
focus groups were employed by the government (public sector)
and noted that this reporting structure impacted how they are per-
mitted to interact with people with schizophrenia. ‘Because we are
all from the government setting, so we don’t have that freedom and
that copyright of seeing the patient the way we want. Prescribing the
patient, the way we want. Right? So, there are definitely some restric-
tions as per government policy’. They noted, however, that these
‘restrictions’, were not the same for providers in private practice.
Relatedly, people with schizophrenia in India wanted to under-
stand how they ensure the ‘legality’ and ‘authenticity’ of the doctor
they would hypothetically connect to via mindLAMP. This con-
cern was not raised by people with schizophrenia in the focus
groups at BIDMC.

(2) Diverse uses for mindLAMP were discussed in India.

At sites in Bhopal and Bengaluru, participants suggested more
novel and varied uses for mindLAMP than in Boston. These
included using mindLAMP as a means to: access healthcare ser-
vices including legal and ambulatory services, consult a doctor,
information to doctors. Participants
and provide educational
noted how mindLAMP could be used as both a self-help tool,
as well as a tool to monitor positive and negative symptoms
unique to schizophrenia or any given illness – mental or physical.

(3) Smartphones are not ubiquitous in rural areas in India.

mindLAMP is a tool only available to smartphone users. Thus,
studies or providers that utilize it are only successful if people with
schizophrenia have regular access to a smartphone. People with
schizophrenia and families might share a smartphone, and or
they have limited connectivity and available data. Providers in
India outlined this important clause, mentioning that in ‘certain
studies which we have conducted, we have found out that unavail-
ability of the smartphone and not able – not having the knowledge
to use the smartphone – was a problem’. Providers cautioned that
‘Definitely, in rural areas it will be difficult’, to ensure mindLAMP
use and engagement. To mitigate this issue, providers suggested
conducting local induction sessions to teach basic smartphone
skills, demonstrate mindLAMP features, and make technical sup-
port available to offer help.

Discussion

Implications of findings

apps

Our results are in line with a current focus in the field of digital
mental health around understanding success of smartphone apps
and implementation. The results here suggest broad interest in
using apps in schizophrenia with common themes including
adapting
in light of
into the healthcare delivery
COVID-19, ensuring app data are used to benefit care, and
increasing engagement through human support which parallels
factors that
facilitate implementation (Connolly et al., 2020)
including external factors related to healthcare systems, internal
factors related to care delivery, and a focus on the users, respect-
ively. Previous qualitative studies have yielded similar results,
highlighting openness among providers but also pervasive con-
cern related to workflow and restrictions and accessing digital
tools (Theme 1) (Lattie et al., 2020). While providers in this
study were apprehensive about opening new lines of direct com-
munication with people with schizophrenia (Theme 2), they
reported more interest in relation to technologies in response to
COVID-19 and social distancing mandates. All parties felt
human support with mindLAMP is critical
to engagement
(Theme 3). Our results focus on people and connections as
most critical for success, findings in line with recent implementa-
tion science research exploring why local efforts related to behav-
ioral nudging often fail at scale (Bird et al., 2021). The
implications of these findings reinforce the need to invest not
only in mental health technology but also the systems and people
necessary to support it.

All participants agreed that COVID-19 had made them more
interested in using apps for care because (1) barriers to trying new
technology are fewer and (2) new app data could supplement tele-
health visits to make the visits richer and bring outside informa-
tion into the online session. Participants noted that mindLAMP
would be most useful if it could integrate with an electronic med-
ical record and offer a direct link between the app and clinical
encounter and access to medication information. Among all par-
ticipants, there were fewer concerns related to privacy and safety
than we anticipated based on our own prior research with
mindLAMP. This finding may be indicative of a new landscape
for digital health that the world is adapting to (Theme 1).
Restricting in-person meetings has necessitated providers to
learn and leverage more digital tools to carry out routine clinical
responsibilities. In this new landscape, there may be more oppor-
tunity to introduce and integrate technology into care. While the
impact of COVID-19 certainly influenced our results in terms of
increasing interest in mobile health, it is likely this interest is

8

neither merely reactive nor transient. Across the world interest in
mobile health has increased (Inkster, 2021) and COVID-19 will
continue to influence mental health care delivery even after the
world population is vaccinated (Torous and Wykes, 2020).

Based on results from Theme 1, we believe that specific and
tailored education and instruction for using mindLAMP will opti-
mize its use. Clinicians and people with schizophrenia will be
more inclined to use mindLAMP to supplement care if they real-
ize its benefits and can navigate the platform with confidence. To
this end, in future iterations of the mindLAMP platform we will
pilot test a few strategies, such as providing users with an informa-
tional video and a detailed manual that includes step-by-step
instructions and frequently asked questions for clinicians and
researchers as well as people with schizophrenia and participants,
respectively. We will also create PDF summaries of data which can
be generated on demand and determine the feasibility of upload-
ing these details into medical records as an immediate solution to
integration. Further work to allow mindLAMP to integrate with
medical records using the SMART and FHIR standards will
continue.

Participants were excited by use of the new data and care
resources afforded by mindLAMP, but also raised concerns
about use of the data to improve outcomes. Participants reported
limited experiences with digital mental health applications. Their
understanding of data informed treatments that could be piloted
with mindLAMP was limited and conceptual. All parties noted
are not accustomed to accessing and viewing the range and extent
of smartphone data mindLAMP can collect, such as step count or
sleep data in routine care settings. While the fact that mindLAMP
can share results in real time was appreciated, there remained
confusion from providers and people with schizophrenia alike
on how to act on that data.

Informed by Theme 2, we will create guidelines that help
researchers interpret app data and explain and share it with peo-
ple with schizophrenia. We will also update the app so that it is
possible for clinicians to create custom views so that data visible
to them and shared with people with schizophrenia can be as lim-
ited or extensive as the clinician and person agree is appropriate
or helpful. For example, if a provider is only interested in viewing
how many steps their patient is taking daily, they can customize
the platform to display these metrics alone or in conjunction
with other selected datapoints. Adaptations to mindLAMP will
also include building a journal feature so people with schizophre-
nia can track their mood and record their thoughts to contextual-
ize data for themselves and their clinician.

The efficacy of mindLAMP hinges on engagement and our
results suggest people – not technology – will continue to drive
that engagement (Theme 3). Building on trust, providers are
poised to recommend technology to their people with schizophre-
nia and support continued use. Moreover, they can help people
with schizophrenia utilize their own data to identify patterns
and reflect on behavioral tendencies. If people with schizophrenia
utilize mindLAMP in tandem with ongoing treatment from a pro-
vider, they may be encouraged to complete more surveys and pro-
vide clinicians further context and timely information. This could
enable a reciprocal relationship between people with schizophre-
nia and clinicians, where information shared by people with
schizophrenia through use of mindLAMP could prompt targeted
feedback and recommendations from providers. In such a scen-
ario, use of technology holds potential to strengthen the thera-
peutic relationship and enable remote support for continuity of
care.

mindLAMP in India

Certain results were unique to India. Focus groups in India sug-
gested wider uses of mindLAMP beyond relapse prevention in
schizophrenia, thus, highlighting the broad potential of mobile
health tools like smartphone apps in other LMICs. Additional
regulatory concerns appear specific to the rapidly changing tele-
health policies in India – with the first national framework intro-
duced in June 2020 and new to nearly all at the times of the focus
groups. Issues of access to smartphones in more rural communi-
ties reflect an important consideration that may limit universal
access to mindLAMP. Global trends in access to smartphones
and wireless coverage however, suggest such disparities will con-
tinue to shrink in coming years.

An advantage of technology, specifically smartphone apps, is
the ability to carefully tailor content to different languages and
cultural contexts through systematic engagement of local stake-
holders and partnership with the local health system, as demon-
strated in prior work conducted by our team in rural India
(Naslund et al., 2019). mindLAMP has been translated to Hindi
and Kannada – with help from research collaborators in Bhopal
and Bengaluru to ensure cultural relevance – so that the app
can be used by providers and people with schizophrenia in a lan-
guage they are comfortable using in the context of healthcare.
Towards cultural relevance, active user engagement, and efficacy,
study sites will continue to collect insight to inform further adap-
tations to mindLAMP during Phase 2.

While there is increasing interest in using mobile technology to
advance mental health in LMICs (Ridley et al., 2020), there are few
other studies to directly compare this project to. A 2-week feasibil-
ity study of a passive data smartphone app in Nepal reveled similar
findings around the need to prioritize privacy and ensure support
for engagement (Maharjan et al., 2021). Early work in Ghana high-
lights interest and potential for smartphones to advance mental
health in this region with access and interest both high (Kola
et al., 2021). While our results around use of the mindLAMP
app in India and the United States cannot be generalized to
other countries, the broad themes uncovered are likely relevant.

Study limitations
Participants in focus groups – clinicians as well as people with
schizophrenia and family members – elected to partake in the
study. Our results may reflect that these participants were inter-
ested in technology and or already using digital
tools and
resources to supplement care. We did not re-verify diagnosis of
people with schizophrenia as they were each in treatment with
the respective site the study was conducted at. In this study,
many people with schizophrenia and their family members parti-
cipated in joint focus group discussion. This may have impacted
their comfort level sharing phone habits, expressing concerns
over privacy, and raising other issues that conversation may
have elicited. Finally, nursing practitioners and psychologists
were underrepresented in our sample although critical users
who we envision will have active roles in supporting and engaging
with technologies like mindLAMP.

To protect the privacy of focus group participants and adhere
to the protocol of our ethical approval, recorded comments and
feedback from clinicians, people with schizophrenia, and family
members were not linked to individuals. Thus, our results and
thematic analysis did not account for age or gender – demograph-
ics that may inform or impact attitudes towards technology.

This research was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic,
October 2020–February 2021, and initial plans for in-person
research had to be adapted to online formats. While this did
not decrease the rigor of the study, we did not conduct the
study utilizing any checklists like the consolidated criteria for
reporting qualitative research (Tong et al., 2007). We were also
unable to gather data on how many participants were screened
to partake at the India sites.

Financial support. Research reported in this publication was supported by
the Innovations’ Innovator Award from the Wellcome Trust (grant no.
