Abstract
Central neuropeptides are small proteins or peptides primarily produced and released by neurons. They act as neurotrans-
mitters,  neuromodulators,  and  neuroregulators  within  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS).  Numerous  studies  have  dem-
onstrated  that  these  neuropeptides  play  a  role  in  both  normal  neurophysiological  processes  and  pathological  conditions. 
Astrocytes,  the  most  abundant  glial  cells  in  the  CNS,  are  crucial  for  maintaining  brain  function  and  health,  and  they 
contribute  significantly  to  the  development  of  CNS  disorders—especially  neurodegenerative  and  neuropsychiatric  dis-
eases. Previous research suggests that central neuropeptides influence astrocyte activity by regulating their proliferation, 
morphology, and secretory functions, among other aspects, thereby impacting the pathogenesis of these disorders. Based 
on  preclinical  evidence,  both  central  neuropeptides  and  their  receptors  are  emerging  as  promising  targets  for  treating 
CNS disorders. In this review, we examine the effects of select central neuropeptides—including neuropeptide Y (NPY), 
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), cholecystokinin (CCK), 
corticotropin-releasing  hormone  (CRH),  angiotensin  (Ang),  oxytocin  (OXT),  orexin  (OX)/hypocretin  (HCRT),  and  glu-
cagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)—on astrocyte state transitions. Our aim is to provide novel insights that could inform the 
clinical treatment of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Introduction

Central  nervous  system  (CNS)  disorders—including  neu-
rodegenerative  and  neuropsychiatric  conditions—are  the 
leading  cause  of  disability  and  the  second  leading  cause 

of  death  worldwide. These  disorders  are  mainly  classified 
into three groups: neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, and 
cerebrovascular disorders. As the global population grows 
and ages, the social and economic burdens of CNS disorders 
continue to increase (Wang et al. 2022). Neurodegenerative

disorders,  such  as  Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD),  Parkinson’s 
disease  (PD),  Huntington’s  disease  (HD),  amyotrophic 
lateral  sclerosis  (ALS),  and  multiple  sclerosis  (MS),  are 
marked  by  the  progressive  loss  of  synapses  and  neurons 
(Gupta  et  al.  2023).  Neuropsychiatric  disorders—ranging 
from  depression,  anxiety,  schizophrenia,  and  bipolar  dis-
order  to  autism  spectrum  disorders,  headaches,  and  epi-
lepsy—bridge the fields of neurology and psychiatry (Saleki 
et  al.  2024). Together,  these  conditions  pose  major  public 
health challenges, significantly impacting population health 
and socioeconomic development.

Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the CNS, are 
increasingly recognized for their active role in the onset and 
progression of CNS disorders (Sofroniew 2020). Since the 
concept of neuropeptides emerged last century, many have 
been identified, and their functions in the CNS have become 
a major focus in neuroscience research. Central neuropep-
tides have been shown to influence astrocyte proliferation, 
morphology,  and  secretory  activity,  thereby  modulating 
their functional state (Chen et al. 2022; Krisch and Mentlein 
1994; Masmoudi-Kouki et al. 2018). These interactions are 
particularly  relevant  in  the  context  of  neurodegenerative 
and  neuropsychiatric  disorders.  Understanding  how  cen-
tral  neuropeptides  regulate  astrocyte  states  may  offer  new 
insights  into  the  mechanisms  of  these  disorders  and  help 
identify potential therapeutic targets.

 Central neuropeptides

Central neuropeptides are small proteins or peptides primar-
ily synthesized and released by neurons, functioning mainly 
within the CNS (Bakos et al. 2016). By binding to specific 
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), they modulate neu-
ronal  activity  and  contribute  to  a  variety  of  physiological 
processes,  including  emotion  regulation,  pain  perception, 
appetite  control,  sleep,  learning,  and  memory  (Beck  and 
Pourié 2013; Neugebauer et al. 2020). These neuropeptides 
are produced through the cleavage of precursor molecules 
and  stored  in  large  dense-core  vesicles  at  the  presynaptic 
membrane before being transported to nerve terminals via 
axonal transport (Satao and Doshi 2024). Compared to clas-
sical neurotransmitters, central neuropeptides exhibit recep-
tor  affinities  and  selectivities  roughly  1,000  times  greater, 
allowing  them  to  trigger  biological  effects  at  much  lower 
concentrations (Merighi et al. 2011).

To  date,  over  one  hundred  central  neuropeptides  have 
been  identified  and  studied.  However,  there  is  no  univer-
sally  accepted  classification  system.  Generally,  two  main 
approaches  are  used.  Family-based  classification:  Groups 
include  the  vasoactive  intestinal  peptide  (VIP)/pituitary 
adenylate  cyclase-activating  polypeptide  (PACAP)/glu-
cagon  (GCG)  superfamily,  the  endogenous  opioid  peptide 

family,  the  vasopressin  (VP)/oxytocin  (OXT)  family,  the 
gastrin/cholecystokinin (CCK) family, and the neuropeptide 
Y (NPY)/peptide YY family. Discovery site classification: 
Neuropeptides are categorized by their sites of origin, such 
as pituitary-like peptides (e.g., VP, OXT, growth hormone), 
brain-gut  peptides  (e.g.,  substance  P,  enkephalins,  VIP), 
and  hypothalamic-releasing  hormones  (e.g.,  corticotropin-
releasing  hormone  [CRH]  and  thyrotropin-releasing  hor-
mone) (Casello et al. 2022; Rana et al. 2022).

 Astrocytes in CNS

Astrocytes  are  the  most  abundant  glial  cells  in  the  CNS, 
accounting for 20–40% of all brain cells, and are essential 
for maintaining brain function and overall health. They pro-
tect the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), secrete 
neurotrophic  factors  to  promote  synaptogenesis,  regulate 
neuronal  differentiation,  and  support  neuronal  survival 
(Zhou  et  al.  2019).  The  morphological  characteristics  of 
astrocytes—such as cell size, process length and complex-
ity,  and  polarization—are  critical  for  normal  CNS  func-
tion and are tightly regulated by signals from neurons and 
other glial cells (Chai et al. 2017; Endo et al. 2022). This 
dynamic regulation underlies the adaptability of astrocytes 
and directly impacts their functional capacity.

Historically,  researchers  discovered  that  astrocyte  mor-
phology  adapts  dynamically  in  response  to  environmental 
changes, enabling these cells to cope with both physiologi-
cal and pathological conditions (Pekny et al. 2016). Under 
normal conditions, astrocytes remain in a resting state with 
limited  proliferation  while  secreting  nutrients  like  lactate 
and cholesterol to support neuronal metabolism. In contrast, 
pathological changes in the CNS trigger astrocyte hypertro-
phy, excessive proliferation, and the release of various cyto-
kines—a  process  known  as  reactive  astrogliosis  (Fig.  1). 
This reactive response significantly influences disease out-
comes (Escartin et al. 2021; Ye et al. 2018). Although the 
consequences  of  reactive  astrogliosis  vary,  an  increase  in 
glial  fibrillary  acidic  protein  (GFAP)  expression  is  widely 
used  as  a  marker  of  activated  astrocytes  (Linnerbauer  et 
al.  2020).  Other  common  markers  include  S100  calcium-
binding protein β (S100β), complement component 3 (C3), 
cluster  of  differentiation  receptor  109  (CD109),  and  con-
nexin  30  (Cx30)  (Jurga  et  al.  2021).  Moreover,  activated 
astrocytes can polarize into two distinct phenotypes, known 
as A1 and A2 astrocytes.

In neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, A1 
astrocytes are typically considered detrimental; they secrete 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic factors such as 
C3, D-serine, nitric oxide (NO), and tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α), thereby exacerbating disease progression (Clarke 
et al. 2018). In contrast, A2 astrocytes secrete neurotrophic

Fig.  1  Central  neuropeptides  regulate  astrocyte  state  transitions  in 
neurodegenerative  and  neuropsychiatric  disorders.  The  pathogenesis 
of  neurodegenerative  and  neuropsychiatric  disorders  is  multifaceted, 
involving factors such as abnormal microglial activation, neurotrans-
mitter dysregulation, neurodegeneration, demyelination, plaque aggre-
gation  and  fibrillary  tangles,  vascular  pathology,  and  chronic  stress. 
These factors ultimately alter astrocyte morphology, leading to a cas-
cade of pathological changes. Central neuropeptides are small proteins 
or peptides primarily synthesized and secreted by neurons within the 
CNS.  By  binding  to  specific  G  protein-coupled  receptors  (GPCRs), 

they  modulate  neuronal  activity  and  participate  in  a  wide  range  of 
physiological  processes.  Numerous  studies  have  demonstrated  that 
several  central  neuropeptides—including  neuropeptide  Y  (NPY), 
vasoactive  intestinal  peptide  (VIP),  pituitary  adenylate  cyclase-acti-
vating  polypeptide  (PACAP),  cholecystokinin  (CCK),  corticotropin-
releasing hormone (CRH), angiotensin (Ang), oxytocin (OXT), orexin 
(OX)/hypocretin  (HCRT),  and  glucagon-like  peptide-1  (GLP-1)—
influence  the  onset  and  progression  of  these  disorders  by  regulating 
the state transitions of astrocytes. [Created with BioRender.com]

factors—including  cardiotrophin-like  cytokine  factor  1 
(CLCF1),  leukemia  inhibitory  factor  (LIF),  interleukin-6 
(IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10)—that promote neuronal 
survival and recovery (Fan and Huo 2021). Numerous stud-
ies have indicated that, in the context of neurodegenerative 
and neuropsychiatric disorders, astrocytes are widely acti-
vated and tend to adopt the A1 phenotype (Zhai et al. 2024). 
Consequently,  strategies  aimed  at  suppressing  abnormal 
astrocyte activation and controlling their polarization repre-
sent promising therapeutic targets.

Recent research highlights the critical interplay between 
central  neuropeptides  and  astrocytes  in  maintaining  CNS 
homeostasis  (Nakamachi  et  al.  2011;  Schwartz  and  Tani-
waki  1994).  Among  these  neuropeptides,  NPY,  VIP, 

PACAP, CCK, CRH, angiotensin (Ang), OXT, orexin (OX)/
hypocretin  (HCRT),  and  glucagon-like  peptide-1  (GLP-1) 
have emerged as particularly promising drug candidates for 
treating neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. 
Understanding  how  central  neuropeptides  regulate  astro-
cyte morphology and function not only deepens our knowl-
edge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying 
these disorders but also opens the door to novel therapeutic 
strategies.

This  review  summarizes  the  latest  research  on  the 
regulation  of  astrocyte  states  by  central  neuropeptides  in 
neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Specifi-
cally,  it  focuses  on:  (1)  The  fundamental  roles  of  central 
neuropeptides;  (2) Their  effects  on  astrocyte  proliferation,

Fig. 2  Diverse effects of central neuropeptides on astrocytes via spe-
cific GPCRs. Astrocytes express a wide array of neuropeptide recep-
tors, enabling central neuropeptides to finely regulate their function. 
For example, NPY, acting through Y1R, inhibits the release of iNOS 
and NO and reduces ROS production, while also stimulating its own 
secretion via mGluR activation. VIP and PACAP, through PAC1 recep-
tors,  promote  the  synthesis  and  release  of  NT-3,  glutathione  (GSH), 
ADNP, ADNF, and MIP, thereby providing neuroprotection; addition-
ally, PACAP enhances ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a cAMP-dependent 
manner,  leading  to  astrocyte  proliferation  and  activation  of  GFAP 
gene  expression.  In  contrast, Ang  II,  via AT1R,  induces  the  release 
of inflammatory factors, suppresses GSH production, increases ROS 
generation,  and  triggers  ferroptosis,  while  also  promoting  astrocyte 
growth  through  the  activation  of  Src,  Pyk2,  and  ERK1/2,  and  con-
tributing  to  neuropsychiatric  disorders  via  the  β-arrestin2  pathway. 
ACE2 converts Ang II into Ang (1–7), which activates MasR to exert 
neuroprotective  effects  by  downregulating  p38MAPK-mediated 

inflammation,  reducing  inflammatory  factor  levels,  and  modulating 
astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation through the lncRNA SNHG14/
miR-223-3p/NLRP3 pathway. Moreover, orexin, acting through OXR, 
increases cAMP production and ERK1/2 phosphorylation while inhib-
iting  NF-κB  and  MAPK  pathways,  thereby  reducing  astrocyte  acti-
vation  and  apoptosis  and  alleviating  neuroinflammation.  GLP-1,  via 
GLP-1R,  suppresses  the  secretion  of  MMP,  MCP-1,  and  CXCL-1, 
and  lowers  VEGF-A  levels  by  inhibiting  JAK2/STAT3  signaling  to 
maintain BBB integrity. CCK, through CCKBR and mGluR5, elevates 
intracellular  Ca²⁺  and ATP  release,  which  regulates  synaptic  plastic-
ity.  OXT,  via  OXTR,  inhibits  the  release  of  the  NLRP3  inflamma-
some, thus modulating neuroinflammation, while CRH, acting through 
CRHR1,  suppresses  CXCL5  secretion  by  astrocytes,  inhibiting  syn-
apse formation in hippocampal neurons. Finally, UCN2 promotes hip-
pocampal synapse formation by inducing astrocytes to secrete NGF.

morphology, and secretory functions under both physiologi-
cal and pathological conditions (Figs. 1 and 2); and (3) Their 
potential  as  therapeutic  targets.  Through  a  comprehensive 
analysis, this review aims to illuminate the synergistic roles 
of central neuropeptides and astrocyte states in brain func-
tion  and  to  offer  new  perspectives  for  the  diagnosis  and 
treatment of related disorders.

Central neuropeptides and astrocyte 
proliferation

NPY and astrocyte proliferation

NPY is a 36–amino acid peptide widely expressed through-
out  the  mammalian  nervous  system.  It  is  particularly 
concentrated  in  brain  regions  involved  in  emotion  and 

Psychopharmacology (2025) 242:2353–23711 3 
cognition, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothala-
mus,  and  striatum  (Duarte-Neves  et  al.  2016).  Although 
NPY is primarily synthesized and released by GABAergic 
interneurons, it is also found in astrocytes and certain pro-
jection neurons. Moreover, NPY can cross the blood-brain 
barrier  (BBB)  and  enter  the  CNS  from  peripheral  sources 
(Gøtzsche and Woldbye 2016).

To  date,  seven  NPY  receptors  (Y1R, Y2R, Y4R, Y5R, 
Y6R, Y7R,  and Y8R)  have  been  identified  in  vertebrates, 
with five (Y1R, Y2R, Y4R, Y5R, and Y6R) present in mam-
mals (Sundström et al. 2013). NPY plays essential roles in 
various physiological processes, including circadian rhythm 
regulation, neurogenesis, neuronal excitability and plastic-
ity, appetite control, energy homeostasis, memory, learning, 
and emotional modulation (Geloso et al. 2015). Altered NPY 
levels have been observed in several neurodegenerative and 
neuropsychiatric  disorders.  For  instance,  NPY  expression 
is  markedly  reduced  in  the  hippocampus  of  patients  with 
AD  (Kowall  and  Beal  1988),  and  similar  reductions  have 
been noted in AD mouse models in both the hippocampus 
and cortex (Ramos et al. 2006). Additionally, intracerebro-
ventricular  injection  of  NPY  has  been  shown  to  reverse 
depressive-like behaviors and spatial memory impairments 
in AD mice via Y2R activation (dos Santos et al. 2013). In 
PD  animal  models,  the  loss  of  dopaminergic  neurons  cor-
responds with an increase in NPY neurons in the striatum, 
potentially serving as an early protective mechanism (Ma et 
al. 2014). Direct injection of NPY into the striatum has also 
been  observed  to  prevent  degeneration  in  the  nigrostriatal 
pathway through Y2R-mediated mechanisms (Decressac et 
al. 2012).

Recent  findings  indicate  that  astrocytes  themselves  can 
synthesize NPY. Upon activation of metabotropic glutamate 
receptors, astrocytes release NPY via Ca²⁺-dependent exo-
cytosis  of  dense-core  granules  (Ramamoorthy  and  Whim 
2008).  Studies  have  shown  that  knocking  out  the  NPY 
receptor reduces the number of proliferating cells, migrat-
ing  neuroblasts,  and  intermediate  neurons  in  the  olfactory 
bulb of mice, highlighting NPY’s crucial role in regulating 
adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) (Stanic 
et  al.  2008).  Moreover,  a  significant  increase  in  bromode-
oxyuridine  (BrdU)/GFAP  double-labeled  cells  after  lateral 
ventricle  injection  of  NPY  suggests  that  NPY  enhances 
astrocyte proliferation in the SVZ through Y1R activation 
(Decressac et al. 2009).

VIP and PACAP and astrocyte proliferation

VIP  is  a  28–amino  acid  neuropeptide  within  the  VIP/
PACAP/GCG superfamily. It primarily acts through VPAC1 
and  VPAC2  receptors  and  is  also  partially  recognized  by 

2357

the  PACAP-specific  PAC1  receptor.  PACAP  shares  68% 
structural similarity with VIP and exhibits comparable neu-
rotrophic  effects  (Zusev  and  Gozes  2004).  Both  VIP  and 
PACAP  play  roles  in  the  development  and  progression  of 
various  neurological  disorders  and  offer  neuroprotection 
against  toxic  insults  such  as  ethanol,  hydrogen  peroxide, 
β-amyloid,  and  inflammatory  cytokines.  For  example,  in 
AD,  overexpression  of  VIP  enhances  the  phagocytosis  of 
fibrillar  β-amyloid  by  hippocampal  microglia,  thereby 
reducing amyloid deposition in the brain (Song et al. 2012). 
In  PD,  VIP  treatment  alleviates  oxidative  stress–induced 
neuronal damage by reducing lipid peroxidation and DNA 
fragmentation  in  the  striatum,  protecting  neurons  from 
apoptosis in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)–induced rat 
model (Tunçel et al. 2012). In HD, decreased expression of 
VIP and its VPAC2 receptor in the suprachiasmatic nucleus 
is linked to disrupted circadian rhythms (Fahrenkrug et al. 
2007).

The effects of VIP and PACAP on astrocytes have been 
documented  for  decades.  Early  studies  revealed  that  these 
neuropeptides  are  involved  in  astrocyte  proliferation.  For 
instance, when VIP and PACAP antagonists were adminis-
tered to pregnant mice on embryonic days 17 and 18, a dra-
matic reduction in astrocytes was observed in the offspring’s 
upper  cortical  layers—an  effect  that  could  be  reversed  by 
VIP, PACAP, or VPAC2 agonists (Zupan et al. 1998). Fur-
ther  studies  indicate  that  PACAP  can  stimulate  astrocyte 
proliferation even at low concentrations, a process closely 
associated  with  MAPK  activation.  Picomolar  concentra-
tions  of  PACAP  trigger  the  phosphorylation  of  ERK1/2 
via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)–dependent 
mechanism,  which  in  turn  stimulates  intracellular  cAMP 
production in developing cortical progenitor cells, leading 
to astrocyte generation and activation of GFAP gene expres-
sion  (Moroo  et  al.  1998).  Additionally,  PACAP-induced 
cAMP production results in intracellular Ca²⁺ mobilization 
or increased extracellular Ca²⁺ influx, which then activates 
the  downstream  regulatory  element  antagonist  modulator 
(DREAM) to stimulate GFAP gene transcription (Cebolla et 
al. 2008). The proliferative effect of PACAP can be reversed 
by cAMP antagonists or ERK inhibitors (Masmoudi-Kouki 
et al. 2007). Under pathological conditions, VIP and PACAP 
also play significant roles in regulating astrocyte prolifera-
tion. For example, in a 6-OHDA–induced PD rat model, the 
density  of  striatal  astrocytes  increased  markedly,  and  VIP 
treatment  reduced  GFAP  levels,  thereby  partially  alleviat-
ing astrogliosis, and reversed motor dysfunction in PD rat 
models  (Yelkenli  et  al.  2016). These  findings  suggest  that 
the proliferative effects of VIP and PACAP on astrocytes are 
complex  and  not  yet  fully  understood,  warranting  further 
investigation.

CRH and astrocyte proliferation

CRH  is  a  41–amino  acid  neuropeptide  that  belongs  to 
the  CRH  peptide  family,  which  also  includes  urocortin 
1  (UCN1),  urocortin  2  (UCN2),  and  urocortin  3  (UCN3). 
All these peptides exert their effects by binding to the CRH 
receptor (CRHR) (Matsoukas et al. 2024). The CRHR fam-
ily  comprises  two  subtypes,  CRHR1  and  CRHR2.  CRH 
preferentially  binds  to  CRHR1,  while  UCN1  can  interact 
with  both  receptors.  In  contrast,  UCN2  and  UCN3  selec-
tively  bind  to  CRHR2,  serving  as  the  endogenous  ligands 
for this receptor (Vuppaladhadiam et al. 2020).

CRH is mainly secreted by the paraventricular nucleus of 
the hypothalamus and plays a critical role in regulating the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)  axis,  especially  in 
response to stress and emotional changes (Vale et al. 1983). 
Urocortins, however, are more widely distributed. In addi-
tion to their role in the HPA axis, they participate in feeding 
behavior,  cardiovascular  regulation,  and  other  physiologi-
cal  processes  (Monteiro-Pinto  et  al.  2019).  Overexpres-
sion of CRH and CRHR1 has been closely linked to mental 
disorders such as anxiety and depression (Lv et al. 2024), 
while activation of the CRHR2 signaling pathway contrib-
utes to anxiolysis, stress recovery, and the maintenance of 
homeostasis  (Wang  et  al.  2023a).  CRH  is  involved  in  the 
pathogenesis of various diseases. Studies have shown that 
serum  CRH  levels  are  elevated  in  post-stroke  depression 
(PSD) patients compared to healthy persons. This strongly 
suggests  that  the  elevation  of  CRH  levels  is  a  key  patho-
logical factor in the occurrence of PSD. Moreover, In PSD 
rats, CRH activates the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway via 
CRHR1  in  the  prefrontal  cortex,  leading  to  increased  p62 
expression.  Blocking  CRHR1  enhances  synaptic  plastic-
ity  and  alleviates  depressive-like  behaviors  and  cognitive 
impairments in these animals (Liu et al. 2024a). Similarly, 
in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) models, selective 
activation of CRHR2 in the paraventricular nucleus allevi-
ates  anxiety-like  behaviors  and  slows  disease  progression 
(Tillinger et al. 2024).

CRH  and  urocortins  also  directly  interact  with  astro-
cytes, modulating their inflammatory responses and neuro-
protective functions (Deng et al. 2024a; Zheng et al. 2016). 
These interactions may help explain mechanisms underly-
ing neuroinflammation and neuropsychiatric disorders. For 
example, CRH promotes astrocyte proliferation in a dose-
dependent manner, as demonstrated by BrdU incorporation 
experiments. This  mitogenic  effect  is  more  pronounced  in 
immature astrocytes than in mature ones and can be inhib-
ited  by  competitive  CRHR  antagonists  (Ha  et  al.  2000). 
However,  the  precise  mechanisms  by  which  CRH  affects 
astrocyte  proliferation  remain  unclear  and  warrant  further 
investigation.

Under cerebral ischemic conditions, increased expression 
of  CRHR1  in  the  mouse  hippocampus  leads  to  significant 
proliferation of reactive astrocytes. Treatment with antalar-
min, a CRHR1 blocker, notably reduces GFAP levels in the 
hippocampus, underscoring the role of CRHR1 in astrocyte 
reactivity (de la Tremblaye et al. 2017).

Ang and astrocyte proliferation

Ang  represents  a  class  of  central  neuropeptides  derived 
from angiotensinogen (AGT). In the CNS, astrocytes syn-
thesize both renin and AGT, and AGT is enzymatically pro-
cessed by renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). 
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a crucial role in 
regulating blood pressure, fluid balance, and various organ 
functions.  Within  the  RAS, ACE  converts  inactive  angio-
tensin I (Ang I) into highly bioactive angiotensin II (Ang II) 
(Wright et al. 2013). Ang II exerts its effects by binding to 
specific receptors, including the AT1 receptor (AT1R) and 
AT2 receptor (AT2R) (Paz Ocaranza et al. 2020). Notably, 
Ang  II-AT1R  signaling  mediates  pro-inflammatory  and 
pathological  processes—such  as  neuroinflammation,  oxi-
dative  stress,  and  neurotoxicity—that  contribute  to  tissue 
damage and functional impairments (Forrester et al. 2018). 
Conversely, when Ang II activates AT2R, it inhibits oxida-
tive  stress  and  inflammation,  promotes  cell  survival,  and 
enhances  cognitive  function  (Bhat  et  al.  2021).  This  dual 
regulatory  mechanism  underscores  the  central  role  of  the 
RAS in maintaining physiological and pathological balance.
The brain RAS is also involved in regulating cardiovas-
cular functions such as blood pressure, cardiac output, and 
vascular tone (Volpe et al. 2002). Moreover, it plays a vital 
role  in  the  development  of  various  neurodegenerative  and 
neuropsychiatric disorders, including traumatic brain injury 
(TBI), MS, AD, PD, and stroke (Abiodun and Ola 2020). In 
neurodegenerative  disorders  like AD,  PD,  and  MS,  astro-
cytes  often  exhibit  excessive  activation  and  a  pro-inflam-
matory phenotype. In contrast, astrocytes appear to perform 
distinct functions in TBI (Wang et al. 2021). Research has 
shown that neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus 
(DG)  increases  following TBI,  although  this  occurs  at  the 
expense of astrocyte formation (Bielefeld et al. 2024). How-
ever, the specific mechanisms by which astrocytes contrib-
ute to these processes remain unclear.

Astrocytes  are  integral  components  of  the  brain  RAS, 
and  both  Ang  II  and  Ang  III  significantly  influence  their 
activity. Studies have demonstrated that Ang II and Ang III 
promote astrocyte proliferation. For example, Ang II stimu-
lates  astrocyte  growth  by  activating  non-receptor  tyrosine 
kinases Src and Pyk2, which in turn activate ERK1/2 (Clark 
and Gonzalez 2007). Additionally, both Ang II and Ang III 
induce  phosphorylation  of  c-Jun  N-terminal  kinase  (JNK) 

Psychopharmacology (2025) 242:2353–23711 32359

in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, leading to 
the proliferation of cultured rat astrocytes. Pre-treatment of 
brainstem astrocytes with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 sig-
nificantly reduced the phosphorylation of JNK and the sub-
sequent astrocyte proliferation induced by Ang II and Ang 
III (Clark et al. 2008, 2012).

et al. 2017). Moreover, OXT promotes astrocyte prolifera-
tion  through  ERK1/2  phosphorylation  and  protects  astro-
cytes from oxidative stress, underscoring the importance of 
OXT and OXTR in maintaining astrocyte growth and vital-
ity (Alanazi et al. 2020).

OXT and astrocyte proliferation

OXT is a neuropeptide composed of nine amino acids and 
is  primarily  synthesized  by  hypothalamic  neurons  in  the 
paraventricular nucleus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SON), 
and  other  accessory  nuclei.  It  is  released  into  both  the 
bloodstream and the brain (Iovino et al. 2021). OXT plays 
a  crucial  role  in  childbirth  and  lactation;  during  labor,  it 
stimulates uterine smooth muscle contractions to facilitate 
delivery, and during lactation, it triggers mammary smooth 
muscle contractions to eject milk. Often referred to as the 
“love  hormone,”  OXT  significantly  influences  bonding, 
social  behavior,  and  mother–infant  interactions  (Marsh  et 
al. 2021; Zik and Roberts 2015).

Beyond  its  role  in  social  behaviors,  OXT  has  emerged 
as  an  important  factor  in  neurodegenerative  and  psychiat-
ric disorders such as AD, anxiety disorders, and depression 
(Ghazy  et  al.  2023).  For  example,  in APP/PS1  transgenic 
mouse  models  of  AD,  OXT  reduces  hippocampal  glial 
activation and restores both social and non-social memory, 
suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for alleviat-
ing central inflammation and cognitive impairments in AD 
(Selles  et  al.  2023). Additionally,  studies  have  shown  that 
OXT  can  reverse  the  reduction  of  OXT  receptor  (OXTR) 
expression and glutathione levels in the striatum of HD rats, 
while  also  modulating  anxiety  and  depression  symptoms 
(Khodagholi et al. 2022).

In the brain, OXT interacts with both neurons and astro-
cytes. As early as 1992, OXTR were identified on astrocytes 
(Di Scala-Guenot and Strosser 1992). OXT promotes astro-
cyte proliferation, and evidence indicates that intracellular 
calcium plays a crucial role in this process. In vitro studies 
have shown that OXT induces intracellular Ca²⁺ oscillations 
in astrocytes, confirming that these cells directly respond to 
OXT signaling (Scala-Guenot et al. 1994). Recent research 
further  revealed  that  optogenetically  controlled  release 
of  OXT  at  axon  terminals  in  the  central  amygdala  (CeA) 
triggers  local  calcium  transients  in  astrocytes  via  OXTR 
activation  (Wahis  et  al.  2021). Although  intracellular  Ca²⁺ 
signaling  is  critical  for  astrocyte  proliferation,  direct  evi-
dence linking OXT-induced Ca²⁺ increases to astrocyte pro-
liferation remains limited, similar to findings with PACAP. 
Nonetheless, studies have demonstrated that OXT adminis-
tration  significantly  increases  the  expression  of  the  GFAP 
gene and protein in the hippocampus of adult rats (Havránek 

Central neuropeptides and astrocyte 
morphology

CCK and astrocyte morphology

CCK is a 33–amino acid neuropeptide highly expressed in 
both the peripheral nervous system and the CNS of mam-
mals. In addition to its roles in digestive function and glucose 
metabolism,  CCK  is  crucial  for  regulating  neurotransmit-
ter  release  and  memory  formation  (Asim  et  al.  2024).  Its 
effects are primarily mediated by G protein-coupled recep-
tors  (GPCRs),  which  vary  in  distribution  and  function 
between the peripheral and central systems. In the periph-
ery, CCK mainly interacts with the cholecystokinin A recep-
tor (CCKAR) to facilitate digestion and nutrient absorption 
(Chen  et  al.  2004).  In  the  CNS,  the  predominant  active 
forms  are  CCK-8  sulfate  (CCK-8  S)  and  CCK-8,  which 
interact  with  the  cholecystokinin  B  receptor  (CCKBR) 
via  autocrine,  endocrine,  and  paracrine  mechanisms.  This 
interaction  influences  neurotransmitter  release,  emotional 
responses,  pain  perception,  and  memory  processes  (Ager-
snap et al. 2016; Lau et al. 2023; Meyer 2014). High lev-
els of CCK are found in brain regions involved in feeding 
behavior,  emotional  regulation,  and  cognitive  functions—
such  as  the  hypothalamus,  hippocampus,  cortex,  striatum, 
and spinal cord (Rehfeld 2017) — with CNS concentrations 
of CCK being significantly higher than those of other cen-
tral  neuropeptides  (Rehfeld 2021).  Changes  in  brain  CCK 
levels are essential for maintaining normal physiology and 
have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several neu-
rodegenerative disorders. For instance, injecting a CCKBR 
antagonist into the motor cortex impairs motor learning in 
mice (Li et al. 2024), while activation of CCKBR amelio-
rates cognitive deficits. CCKBR agonists mitigate memory 
impairments in CCK-deficient and aged AD mice (Zhang et 
al. 2024), and CCK analogs improve learning and memory 
in AD mice by modulating hippocampal neuronal mitochon-
drial dynamics (Hao et al. 2024). Moreover, CCK is impor-
tant  for  emotional  regulation,  influencing  conditions  such 
as  panic  attacks,  PTSD,  anxiety,  and  depression.  Chronic 
stress activates CCKBR in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), 
whereas  blocking  CCKBR  impairs  long-term  potentiation 
(LTP) formation while producing antidepressant-like effects 
(Zhang et al. 2023).

Psychopharmacology (2025) 242:2353–23711 32360

Astrocytes  also  express  CCK  receptors,  which  are 
involved  in  various  physiological  and  pathological  pro-
cesses. Under normal conditions, CCK induces intracellular 
Ca²⁺ oscillations in cultured astrocytes, indicating that these 
cells are key targets of hippocampal CCK signaling (Mül-
ler et al. 1997). Activation of CCKBR and group 5 metabo-
tropic glutamate receptors (mGluR5) in astrocytes increases 
intracellular  calcium  levels  and  triggers  ATP  release, 
thereby  modulating  GABAergic  synaptic  plasticity  in  the 
dorsomedial  nucleus  of  the  hypothalamus  in  rats  (Crosby 
et al. 2018). Calcium signaling is closely linked to astrocyte 
morphological  changes  and  activation;  as  a  vital  intracel-
lular  second  messenger,  Ca²⁺  regulates  various  astrocytic 
activities.  Since  astrocytes  are  non-excitable  cells,  their 
activity  largely  depends  on  intracellular  calcium  elevation 
(Novakovic et al. 2023). For example, treatment with lipo-
polysaccharide (LPS) stimulates the expression and activity 
of  L-type  voltage-operated  calcium  channels  (VOCCs)  in 
primary cortical astrocytes. LPS also increases the number 
of reactive astrocytes, the proportion of proliferating cells, 
and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and che-
mokines.  Blocking  L-type  VOCCs  effectively  inhibits  the 
increase  in  cells  positive  for  GFAP,  S100β,  vimentin,  and 
nestin (Cheli et al. 2016).

Under pathological conditions, CCK influences astrocyte 
states  and  contributes  to  neurological  disorders.  Reduced 
CCK levels in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus lead to 
activation of A1 astrocytes, decreased proliferation of radial 
glia-like neural stem cells, reduced adult hippocampal neu-
rogenesis, and upregulation of neuroinflammatory proteins. 
Chemogenetic  activation  of  CCK-expressing  interneurons 
can reverse these changes via astrocyte-mediated glutama-
tergic  signaling  cascades  (Asrican  et  al.  2020).  Similarly, 
exogenous  CCK-8  supplementation  suppresses  A1  astro-
cyte activation and increases glutamatergic synaptic density 
in the hippocampus, effectively alleviating spatial learning 
and memory deficits in aged mice with delayed neurocogni-
tive  recovery  (Chen  et  al.  2021). Additionally,  CCK  ana-
logs reduce the coverage area of GFAP-positive astrocytes 
in the substantia nigra pars compacta of PD mouse models, 
decrease  inflammatory  cytokine  levels,  reverse  dopamine 
neuronal and synaptic loss, and ultimately alleviate MPTP 
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced 
impairments  in  motor  and  exploratory  activity  in  mice 
(Zhang et al. 2022c).

OX/HCRT and astrocyte morphology

Orexin  (OX),  also  known  as  hypocretin  (HCRT),  is  a 
neuropeptide  secreted  by  neurons  in  the  lateral  hypothal-
amus.  There  are  two  forms:  orexin A  (OXA,  or  hypocre-
tin-1),  composed  of  33  amino  acids,  and  orexin  B  (OXB, 

or  hypocretin-2),  composed  of  28  amino  acids  (Sun  et  al. 
2021b). Orexin acts through two G protein-coupled recep-
tors,  OX1R  and  OX2R,  to  regulate  various  central  and 
peripheral functions. While OXA binds both receptors with 
similar affinities, OXB preferentially activates OX2R (Li et 
al.  2020).  In  the  CNS,  orexins  are  essential  for  regulating 
wakefulness,  sleep,  appetite,  energy  metabolism  (Toor  et 
al. 2021), and emotion and reward systems (Katzman and 
Katzman  2022).  Peripherally,  they  modulate  cardiovascu-
lar  function  (Jiao  et  al.  2024)  and  gastrointestinal  activity 
via  the  autonomic  and  endocrine  systems(Okumura  and 
Takakusaki 2008). Because orexins are vital for maintaining 
wakefulness, their dysregulation is linked to neurodegenera-
tive and neuropsychiatric disorders, making them important 
research targets (Berhe et al. 2020; Fronczek et al. 2021).

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of OXA are significantly 
increased in AD patients (Liguori et al. 2014). Interestingly, 
one study found a positive correlation between CSF OXA 
levels  and  cognitive  function  in  AD  patients  (Shimizu  et 
al.  2020).  However,  in  animal  models,  OXA  appears  to 
worsen  spatial  learning  and  memory  deficits  in AD  mice, 
underscoring the complexity of the orexin system’s role in 
AD (Li et al. 2023). In PD, orexins exhibit neuroprotective 
effects  on  dopaminergic  neurons;  for  instance,  OXA  sig-
nificantly  improves  motor,  sensorimotor,  and  muscle  tone 
impairments in 6-OHDA-induced rats (Hadadianpour et al. 
2017). Orexins are also implicated in psychiatric disorders: 
acute  restraint  stress  activates  hypothalamic  OX  neurons 
and raises OXA levels in the ventral tegmental area, poten-
tially triggering relapse in addiction (Tung et al. 2016), and 
elevated  CSF  OX  levels  are  found  in  patients  with  panic-
related anxiety (Johnson et al. 2010).

Orexins  also  regulate  diverse  functions  in  astrocytes. 
Activation  of  OX1R  stimulates  cAMP  synthesis  in  pri-
mary rodent astrocytes (Woldan-Tambor et al. 2011). Like 
Ca²⁺, cAMP is a key second messenger that initiates vari-
ous downstream cellular processes. Elevated cAMP levels 
have  been  shown  to  transform  flat,  polygonal  astrocytes 
into process-bearing, stellate cells (Won and Oh 2000). Fur-
thermore,  cAMP  treatment  reduces  the  number  of  GFAP-
positive  astrocytes  by  nearly  25%  compared  to  controls, 
accompanied by a broad downregulation of genes involved 
in  astroglial  activation—such  as  those  regulating  hyper-
plasia, cytoskeletal rearrangement, immune responses, and 
scar formation (Paco et al. 2016).

In  pathological  conditions,  orexin-mediated  regulation 
of astrocytes plays a crucial role in disease progression. In 
sepsis-associated  encephalopathy  (SAE),  compared  to  the 
sham  group,  the  expression  levels  of  OX1R  and  OX2R 
in  the  hippocampus  are  elevated  in  SAE  mice  (Guo  et  al. 
2024b). Additionally, OXA, via OX2R rather than OX1R, 
reduces  oxidative  stress  and  inflammatory  responses  in 

Psychopharmacology (2025) 242:2353–23711 3the  hippocampus,  suppresses  ERK/nuclear  factor-kappa 
B  (NF-κB)–driven  activation  of  microglia  and  astrocytes, 
reverses morphological changes such as enlarged cell bod-
ies  and  shortened  processes,  and  promotes  the  conversion 
of neurotoxic A1 reactive astrocytes to the neuroprotective 
A2  phenotype,  ultimately  enhancing  cognitive  function 
(Guo et al. 2024a, b). In ischemia-reperfusion injury, OXA 
mitigates excessive autophagy through the OX1R-mediated 
MAPK/ERK/mTOR pathway (Xu et al. 2021b) and reduces 
cortical  astrocyte  activation  and  apoptosis  by  suppressing 
OX1R-mediated NF-κB and MAPK signaling, thereby low-
ering  GFAP  expression  and  neuroinflammation  (Xu  et  al. 
2021a).  In  MS  mouse  models,  OXA  diminishes  astrocyte 
activation and central demyelination (Becquet et al. 2019). 
The multifaceted roles of the orexin system in the nervous 
system make it a promising target for treating neurodegen-
erative and neuropsychiatric disorders, and future research 
will  further  clarify  its  complex  mechanisms  and  clinical 
applications.

GLP-1 and astrocyte morphology

GLP-1  is  a  neuropeptide  composed  of  30  amino  acids, 
derived from the cleavage of the proglucagon molecule. It 
is  primarily  secreted  by  intestinal  L  cells  in  the  periphery 
and by neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in 
the CNS (Holst 2007; Secher et al. 2014). Neuronal projec-
tions from the NTS extend to multiple brain regions, includ-
ing other brainstem areas as well as forebrain and midbrain 
limbic regions (Diz-Chaves et al. 2022).

GLP-1 plays a vital role in various physiological systems. 
Its  glucose-lowering  and  anti-inflammatory  effects  have 
garnered  significant  attention  in  recent  years.  In  the  CNS, 
GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling is essential for mediat-
ing the anorexigenic effects of GLP-1 analogs. When physi-
ological  doses  of  GLP-1  are  administered  intravenously 
during  meals,  subjects  experience  increased  satiety  and 
reduced food intake (Flint et al. 1998). Disruption of vagal 
afferent signaling hinders these anorexic effects, highlight-
ing the importance of the vagus nerve in GLP-1-mediated 
satiety (Plamboeck et al. 2013). Additionally, GLP-1 and its 
receptors have been implicated in neurodegenerative disor-
ders. Studies have shown that in neurodegenerative diseases 
such as AD and PD, the expression level of GLP-1R in the 
CNS is significantly downregulated(Sun et al. 2021a; Wang 
et al. 2023b). In AD models,, the GLP-1R agonist liraglu-
tide reduces activated microglia and cortical inflammation, 
alleviating AD symptoms (Mehdi et al. 2023). In PD, GLP-
1R  agonists  protect  against  dopaminergic  neuronal  death 
induced  by  6-hydroxydopamine,  and  administration  of 
GLP-1 via the lateral ventricle protects mice from MPTP-
induced neuronal loss (Li et al. 2009).

2361

Recent  research  has  also  revealed  that  GLP-1  recep-
tors  are  expressed  on  astrocytes,  making  them  key  targets 
of GLP-1 (Chowen et al. 1999). Activation of GLP-1R in 
NTS  astrocytes  enhances  intracellular  Ca²⁺  signaling  and 
increases cAMP levels in cultured astrocytes (Reiner et al. 
2016).  Similar  to  neuropeptides  such  as  CCK  and  orexin, 
GLP-1  may  regulate  astrocyte  activation  through  modula-
tion of intracellular Ca²⁺ and cAMP levels. In pathological 
conditions,  the  protective  effects  of  GLP-1  on  astrocytes 
are well documented. GLP-1R agonists significantly reduce 
GFAP-positive astrocytes and lower NLRP2 inflammasome 
expression,  thereby  improving  cortical  neuroinflammation 
and oxidative stress in AD mice (Zhang et al. 2022a). More-
over,  dual  receptor  agonists  targeting  both  GLP-1R  and 
the  glucose-dependent  insulinotropic  polypeptide  receptor 
(GIPR) resensitize insulin signaling in the brain and reduce 
activated  astrocyte  levels  in  the  cortex  and  hippocampus 
of AD  rats,  ultimately  ameliorating  learning  and  memory 
impairments induced by streptozotocin (Shi et al. 2017).

In stroke models, GLP-1 and its receptor exert significant 
neuroprotective effects. Treatment with GLP-1 reduces the 
number  of  C3d/GFAP-positive  A1  astrocytes  in  the  isch-
emic  perifocal  region,  decreases  brain  infarction  volume, 
alleviates  neuroinflammation,  and  mitigates  BBB  disrup-
tion, resulting in improved cognitive function (Zhang et al. 
2022b). In a diffuse PD mouse model, GLP-1 agonists pre-
vent  dopaminergic  neuron  loss  and  motor  dysfunction  by 
inhibiting the microglia-mediated conversion of astrocytes 
to the A1 phenotype.

CRH and astrocyte morphology

Research shows that CRHRs on astrocytes modulate various 
cellular responses—including astrocyte activation and mor-
phological changes—that are critical for neuroinflammation 
and  neuroprotection.  In  models  of  ischemic  brain  injury, 
pre-treatment with antalarmin effectively reduces glucocor-
ticoid secretion following ischemia-reperfusion injury, alle-
viates  excessive  astrocyte  activation  in  the  hippocampus, 
and  provides  neuroprotection.  Antalarmin  also  improves 
spatial  memory,  reduces  passive  avoidance  learning  defi-
cits,  and  mitigates  anxiety-related  behaviors,  emphasizing 
the potential role of CRHR1 in neural injury and cognitive 
dysfunction  (de  la  Tremblaye  et  al.  2017).  Additionally, 
CRHR2 knockout zebrafish exhibit A1 astrocyte activation 
and display anxiety-like behaviors, indicating that CRHR2 
deficiency  can  lead  to  astrocyte  dysregulation  and  behav-
ioral  changes  (Deng  et  al.  2024b). These  findings  suggest 
that CRHR1 and CRHR2 regulate astrocyte function under 
various physiological and pathological conditions, thereby 
influencing neural network structure and function.

Psychopharmacology (2025) 242:2353–23711 32362

Ang and astrocyte morphology

Ang II is implicated in various neurodegenerative and neu-
ropsychiatric disorders, and its impact on astrocyte morphol-
ogy is particularly noteworthy. Treatment with ferrostatin-1 
effectively  inhibits  Ang  II-induced  astrocyte  activation, 
ferroptosis, and the expression of AT1R and inflammatory 
factors (Li et al. 2021). In addition to the classic ACE/Ang 
II/AT1R  axis,  the  non-canonical  ACE2/Ang  (1–7)/Mas 
receptor (MasR) axis has gained attention. In this pathway, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) converts Ang II 
into Ang (1–7), which then binds to MasR to produce anti-
inflammatory,  antioxidative,  and  neuroprotective  effects. 
Activation  of  the  ACE2/Ang  (1–7)/MasR  axis  effectively 
counteracts  the  pro-inflammatory  actions  of  the ACE/Ang 
II/AT1R axis, showing great potential for disease prevention 
and treatment (Sriramula et al. 2015).

In  models  of  lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)-induced  neu-
roinflammation,  ACE2  activation  significantly  reduces 
astrocyte activation in the cortex and hippocampus, down-
regulates  p38  MAPK-mediated  inflammatory  signaling, 
and lowers pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (Tiwari et al. 
2023). Similarly, in PD models, ACE2 activation decreases 
glial  cell  activation,  protecting  neurons,  astrocytes,  and 
microglia  from  cytotoxicity.  By  reducing  Ang  II  levels, 
ACE2  activation  upregulates  the  ACE2/Ang  (1–7)/MasR 
axis, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation in the substan-
tia  nigra  pars  compacta  (SNPC)  and  influencing  disease 
progression(Gupta et al. 2022). Moreover, Ang (1–7) ana-
logs regulate astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation via the 
lncRNA  SNHG14/miR-223-3p/NLRP3  pathway,  rescuing 
cognitive dysfunction in AD mice (Duan et al. 2021).

OXT and astrocyte morphology

OXT plays a significant role in regulating brain functions, 
and its effects on astrocyte morphology are increasingly rec-
ognized. Notably, phenotypic changes in reactive astrocytes 
are  closely  linked  to  decreased  OXTR  expression  (Knoop 
et al. 2022). Activation of OXTR leads to astrocytic mem-
brane depolarization and increased Ca²⁺ release. Moreover, 
OXT acting on astrocytes can trigger the retraction of their 
processes from synapses—a change that may be associated 
with improved anxiety behaviors in rats (Knoop et al. 2022).
Studies  have  also  shown  that  intranasal  administration 
of  OXT  restores  bilateral  hippocampal  OXTR  expression, 
inhibits the overactivation of microglia and astrocytes, and 
alleviates  depressive-like  behaviors  in  models  of  neuro-
pathic pain and autism (Liu et al. 2024b; Wang et al. 2018). 
These findings suggest that changes in CNS OXT levels can 

induce morphological alterations in astrocytes, which play 
an important role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiat-
ric disorders.

Central neuropeptides and astrocyte 
secretory functions

NPY and astrocyte secretory functions

NPY  plays  a  crucial  role  in  modulating  astrocyte  secretory 
functions, especially under conditions of neuroinflammation 
and  oxidative  stress.  Research  shows  that  NPY  effectively 
reduces the production of nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric 
oxide synthase (iNOS), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in 
astrocytes, thereby mitigating oxidative damage in the brain. 
Additionally,  NPY  inhibits  LPS-induced  calcium  overload 
and decreases the release of inflammatory cytokines such as 
IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα through Y1R (Chen et al. 2022).

Beyond  its  antioxidative  and  anti-inflammatory  proper-
ties, NPY also influences neurotrophic signaling pathways. 
Overexpression  of  NPY  upregulates  brain-derived  neuro-
trophic  factor  (BDNF)  in  astrocytes—a  critical  mediator 
of  neuronal  survival,  plasticity,  and  repair.  This  increase 
in  BDNF  is  linked  to  reduced  astrocyte  reactivity,  as 
shown  by  lower  GFAP  expression  and  diminished  release 
of  inflammatory  cytokines  like  IL-1β  and  TNF-α  (Pain  et 
al.  2022).  These  findings  suggest  that  NPY  may  exert  its 
neuroprotective  effects  by  attenuating  astrocyte-mediated 
neuroinflammation.

VIP and astrocyte secretory functions

VIP is a central neuropeptide that plays a key role in regulat-
ing  astrocyte  secretory  functions  and  mediating  neuropro-
tection. It exerts its effects through two distinct pathways. 
The direct pathway involves the activation of cAMP, while 
the indirect pathway operates independently of cAMP and 
relies on astrocytes as intermediaries. In this indirect mech-
anism, astrocytes contribute to VIP’s neuroprotective effects 
through their unique physiological and secretory properties 
(Deng and Jin 2017).

VIP’s neuroprotective actions are largely attributed to its 
stimulation of astrocytes to secrete neuroprotective proteins 
and cytokines, such as activity-dependent neurotrophic/neu-
roprotective  protein  (ADNP),  neurotrophin-3  (NT-3),  and 
various macrophage inflammatory proteins (Brenneman et 
al. 2003; Dejda et al. 2005; Deng and Jin 2017). Furthermore, 
VIP  treatment  significantly  increases  extracellular  GSH 
levels  in  the  striatum—a  key  antioxidant  predominantly 

Psychopharmacology (2025) 242:2353–23711 3secreted by astrocytes—underscoring its regulatory impact 
on astrocyte activity (Yelkenli et al. 2016).

GLP-1 and astrocyte secretory functions

2363

CRH and astrocyte secretory functions

CRH  and  urocortins  (UCNs)  play  critical  roles  in  modu-
lating  astrocyte  secretory  functions,  which  in  turn  affect 
synapse formation. Notably, UCN2 exhibits dual effects on 
synaptogenesis  that  depend  on  the  presence  of  astrocytes. 
In isolated hippocampal neurons, UCN2 suppresses synapse 
formation, whereas in neurons co-cultured with astrocytes, 
it  significantly  promotes  synaptogenesis.  This  astrocyte-
dependent  enhancement  is  mediated  by  the  secretion  of 
nerve  growth  factor  (NGF)  triggered  by  the  activation  of 
CRHR2. Blocking CRHR2 with the antagonist astressin2B 
abolishes  these  effects,  as  shown  by  unchanged  levels  of 
synapsin I and PSD95 proteins (Zheng et al. 2016).

Conversely,  CRH  inhibits  the  astrocytic  secretion  of 
CXCL5 via CRHR1 activation. CXCL5, a chemokine that 
promotes synaptogenesis, is pivotal for astrocytic modula-
tion  of  neuronal  connectivity. The  suppression  of  CXCL5 
by CRH leads to reduced synapse formation in hippocampal 
neurons;  however,  treatment  with  the  CRHR1  antagonist 
antalarmin  reverses  this  suppression,  restoring  synapto-
genic activity (Zhang et al. 2018). These findings highlight 
the contrasting roles of CRHR1 and CRHR2 in astrocyte-
mediated synaptic regulation.

OX/HCRT and astrocyte secretory functions

Orexins regulate a range of physiological functions in astro-
cytes. Activation  of  OX1R  stimulates  cAMP  synthesis  in 
primary  rodent  astrocytes,  which  triggers  the  release  of 
neurotransmitters (Woldan-Tambor et al. 2011). Moreover, 
orexin A  (OXA)  reduces  lactate  production  in  hippocam-
pal astrocytes, limits its transfer to neurons, and decreases 
BDNF expression. These changes impair adult hippocampal 
neurogenesis and cognitive function, leading to anxiety- and 
depression-like behaviors—a pattern that can be reversed by 
selectively blocking hippocampal OX1R (Chen et al. 2024). 
Additionally, orexins inhibit the production and release of 
inflammatory  factors  in  astrocytes,  including  IL-1β, TNF-
α, IL-6, and iNOS, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation. 
The multifaceted roles of the orexin system make it a prom-
ising  target  for  treating  neuropsychiatric  disorders,  and 
future research will further clarify its complex mechanisms 
and clinical applications.

Activation of GLP-1 receptors has shown promising effects 
on  astrocyte-mediated  functions  in  the  CNS,  especially 
under conditions of stress or injury. Research demonstrates 
that  the  long-acting  GLP-1R  agonist,  Exendin-4  (Ex-4), 
reduces the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 
monocyte  chemoattractant  protein-1  (MCP-1),  and  C-X-C 
motif  ligand-1  (CXCL-1)  from  astrocytes  during  oxygen-
glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). These molecules 
are  involved  in  extracellular  matrix  remodeling,  immune 
cell  recruitment,  and  inflammatory  signaling;  their  reduc-
tion helps to attenuate neuroinflammation and tissue dam-
age. Furthermore, Ex-4 modulates JAK2/STAT3 signaling, 
leading to a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor-
A  (VEGF-A)  expression,  which  is  crucial  for  maintaining 
BBB integrity (Shan et al. 2019).

In mice pretreated with LPS to simulate AD-like neuro-
inflammation, GLP-1 agonists reduce amyloid-β deposition, 
glial  activation,  and  the  secretion  of  inflammatory  mol-
ecules such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), TNF-α, IL-1β, 
and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). They also inhibit the activ-
ity of the inflammatory NF-κB/TLR4 and Akt/GSK-3β sig-
naling pathways (Kopp et al. 2022).

Central neuropeptides as therapeutic 
targets

Pharmacological manipulation of central 
neuropeptides

Pharmacological  manipulation  of  central  neuropeptides 
has  emerged  as  a  promising  strategy  for  treating  various 
neurodegenerative  and  neuropsychiatric  disorders.  These 
neuropeptides play a crucial role in modulating brain func-
tion, and their dysregulation has been implicated in diseases 
such as depression, anxiety, AD, MS, and PD (Rana et al. 
2022;  Shen  et  al.  2022).  Numerous  studies  and  reviews 
have explored the roles of neuropeptides in these disorders, 
aiming either to restore normal neuropeptide function or to 
enhance their therapeutic effects.

One  well-studied  approach  involves  using  agonists  and 
antagonists to selectively target neuropeptide receptors. For 
example,  the  effects  of  NPY  on  astrocytes  have  potential 
therapeutic implications for regulating neuroinflammation. 
In  vitro  studies  have  demonstrated  that  exogenous  NPY 
reduces the inflammatory response of astrocytes to LPS by 
activating  the  Y1R.  Pre-treatment  with  NPY  significantly 

Psychopharmacology (2025) 242:2353–23711 32364

attenuates  LPS-induced  cytotoxicity  in  C8-D1A  astro-
cytes, lowers GFAP expression, and suppresses the NF-κB 
signaling pathway by inhibiting the activation of the IKK/
IκB/NF-κB  p65  complex  and  preventing  IκB  degradation. 
Moreover, NPY reduces the expression of NLRP3 and cas-
pase-1 proteins in these astrocytes (Pain et al. 2022).

Similarly,  treatment  with VIP,  PACAP,  or  PAC1  recep-
tor agonists effectively prevents motor deficits in MS mouse 
models and reduces GFAP expression in the corpus callo-
sum. In vitro studies further indicate that the anti-inflamma-
tory effects mediated by PAC1 are largely achieved through 
astrocytes (Jansen et al. 2024). Together, these mechanisms 
offer a promising direction for developing new therapeutic 
strategies for related disorders (Chen et al. 2022).

Gene therapy approaches

Gene therapy approaches have gained increasing attention 
as  potential  strategies  to  modulate  the  expression  of  neu-
ropeptides and their receptors in the CNS. Unlike pharma-
cological  treatments,  which  typically  offer  only  transient 
effects, gene therapy can provide long-lasting or even per-
manent therapeutic outcomes by directly altering the genetic 
makeup  of  target  cells.  This  method  involves  delivering 
genes that encode specific neuropeptides or their receptors 
into  the  CNS  to  either  enhance  or  inhibit  their  expression 
(Sudhakar and Richardson 2019).

For  example,  in  postpartum  depression  (PPD)  models, 
decreased  OXTR  expression  has  been  observed.  Targeted 
knockout of OXTR in hippocampal astrocytes induces acti-
vation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, revealing a novel role 
for the astrocytic OXTR-NLRP3 axis in PPD pathophysiol-
ogy (Zhu and Tang 2020). Similarly, conditional knockout 
of  AT1R  in  astrocytes  significantly  ameliorates  amyloid 
β-induced cognitive dysfunction in AD models by suppress-
ing  the  β-arrestin2  pathway  in  the  hippocampus  (Chen  et 
al. 2023).

Gene  therapy  offers  several  advantages  over  traditional 
pharmacological  treatments.  It  can  target  specific  neuro-
peptides or receptors with high precision, potentially reduc-
ing  the  side  effects  associated  with  broad-spectrum  drugs. 
Moreover, gene therapy may provide sustained therapeutic 
effects,  which  is  particularly  beneficial  for  chronic  condi-
tions  requiring  long-term  treatment.  However,  challenges 
remain, including the safe and efficient delivery of genetic 
material  to  the  CNS,  potential  immune  responses  to  viral 
vectors,  and  ethical  considerations  surrounding  genetic 
modifications (Tang and Xu 2020).

Central neuropeptides beyond CNS regions

Beyond  their  CNS  functions,  these  neuropeptides  play 
pivotal  roles  in  peripheral  physiology.  For  example,  NPY 
regulates  appetite,  energy  balance,  and  stress  responses 
(Reichmann and Holzer 2016), while VIP and PACAP pro-
mote smooth muscle relaxation, vasodilation, and modulate 
immune responses (Iwasaki et al. 2019; Langer et al. 2022). 
Similarly,  CRH  and  urocortins  not  only  manage  the  HPA 
axis and stress responses in the brain but also influence car-
diovascular function and metabolic processes in peripheral 
tissues  (Parkes  et  al.  2001; Takefuji  and  Murohara  2019). 
Angiotensin  peptides,  derived  from  angiotensinogen,  are 
essential  components  of  the  renin-angiotensin  system, 
which  regulates  blood  pressure,  fluid  balance,  and  kidney 
function  (Bhandari  et  al.  2022;  Nakayama  et  al.  2023). 
Oxytocin, widely recognized for its roles in social bonding 
and emotional regulation, is also essential for childbirth and 
lactation (Buckley et al. 2023; Erickson and Emeis 2017). 
A recent study showed that human intestinal organoids pro-
duce oxytocin, indicating that the intestinal epithelium alone 
is  capable  of  generating  this  neuropeptide  (Danhof  et  al. 
2023). Additionally, orexin not only regulates wakefulness 
and energy balance in the brain but also modulates appetite 
and  metabolic  functions  in  peripheral  tissues  (Hashimoto 
2025). Finally, GLP-1, produced by both intestinal L cells 
and  the  brain,  plays  a  critical  role  in  maintaining  glucose 
homeostasis  and  stimulating  insulin  secretion  (Cabou  and 
Burcelin 2011; Zheng et al. 2024).

Given  the  importance  of  brain-body  communication  in 
health  and  disease  (Ma  et  al.  2025),  these  neuropeptides 
integrate  central  and  peripheral  signaling  to  orchestrate  a 
wide range of physiological processes. By bridging the gap 
between the CNS and the body, they help maintain systemic 
homeostasis and offer novel therapeutic avenues. Their dual 
roles underscore the potential of targeting brain-body com-
munication  to  restore  normal  neuropeptide  function  and 
alleviate symptoms associated with conditions such as AD, 
PD, depression, and anxiety.

Conclusion and future directions

This  review  underscores  the  critical  role  of  central  neuro-
peptides  in  regulating  astrocyte  function—impacting  their 
proliferation,  morphology,  and  secretory  activities.  The 
dynamic  interplay  between  neuropeptides  such  as  NPY, 
VIP,  PACAP,  CRH,  angiotensin,  oxytocin,  orexin,  and

GLP-1  and  astrocytes  is  essential  for  maintaining  neural 
homeostasis.  Disruptions  in  these  signaling  pathways  are 
closely linked to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative 
and neuropsychiatric disorders.

The evidence reviewed highlights the therapeutic poten-
tial of targeting these neuropeptide systems. Pharmacologi-
cal agents, receptor agonists/antagonists, and emerging gene 
therapy  approaches  have  shown  promise  in  modulating 
astrocyte  activity  to  mitigate  neuroinflammation,  promote 
neuroprotection, and improve synaptic function. For exam-
ple, intranasal administration of NPY has demonstrated anti-
depressant effects in patients with major depressive disorder 
(Mathé et al. 2020), and GLP-1R agonists have been shown 
to reduce inflammation-related proteins in AD patients (Koy-
chev  et  al.  2024).  Notably,  central  neuropeptides  influence 
multiple aspects of these disorders—including neuroinflam-
mation,  metabolic  dysregulation,  and  neuroprotection—by 

modulating astrocyte states (Table 1 and Table 2). However, 
challenges  remain  regarding  long-term  safety,  individual 
variability, and efficient delivery methods.

Looking  ahead,  future  research  should  focus  on  elu-
cidating  the  complex  molecular  mechanisms  underlying 
neuropeptide-mediated  astrocyte  regulation.  Advanced 
techniques  such  as  optogenetics,  chemogenetics,  and  sin-
gle-cell  transcriptomics  will  be  crucial  for  dissecting  cell-
specific  responses  and  refining  therapeutic  interventions. 
Moreover,  exploring  brain-body  communication  and  the 
integration  of  peripheral  signals  could  pave  the  way  for 
comprehensive  treatment  strategies  that  address  both  cen-
tral and systemic aspects of these disorders. With continued 
technological  innovation  and  integrative  research,  central 
neuropeptides  hold  promise  as  a  next-generation,  multi-
target  therapeutic  strategy  for  neurodegenerative  and  neu-
ropsychiatric disorders.
