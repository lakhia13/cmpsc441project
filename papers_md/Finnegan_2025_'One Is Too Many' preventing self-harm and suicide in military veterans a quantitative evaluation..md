ABSTRACT
Introduction  In 2021, the Armed Forces Covenant Fund 
Trust allocated over £2 million to programmes designed 
to  have  a  clear  and  demonstrable  impact  on  suicide 
prevention.  Four  grant  holders  delivered  a  combination 
of psychotherapeutic interventions, group activities, social 
prescribing,  peer  support  mentoring,  life  skills  coaching, 
educational courses and practical help with housing and 
employment.  The  evaluation  was  completed  between 
August 2021 and July 2023.
Methods  A  survey  was  completed  by  503  participants 
at entry and 423 at exit. It captured data regarding demo-
graphic  and  military- specific  details,  health  status,  situ-
ational  stressors,  predisposing  symptoms,  help- seeking 
behaviour,  social  engagement,  housing,  living  arrange-
ments and employment status. The questionnaire included 
a number of validated psychometric questionnaires.
Results  This  evaluation  revealed  reductions  in  situa-
tional  stressors,  symptoms  and  mental  health  illnesses. 
Seventy- six  per  cent  of  participants  had  completed  an 
Operational Tour, and 77% were exposed to a traumatic 
event during service. It was the negative impact of unre-
solved  traumatic  effects  that  influenced  service- users  to 
require support. Forty- nine per cent delayed seeking help, 
and 36% self- referred to the One Is Too Many programme 
which demonstrates the importance of this option. There 
were improvements in the participants’ social networking, 
social  activities,  club  membership  and  having  people  to 
rely on. Only 4% of participants were women which rein-
forces  the  requirement  to  explore  initiatives  to  engage 
with female veterans.
Conclusions  Timely  therapeutic  and  social  prescribing 
interventions in a safe environment lowered depression, 
anxiety and the associated situational stressors leading to 
self- harming and may have reduced suicide. It presented 
another  option  to  veterans  and  their  families  regarding 
where  they  can  obtain  support,  care  and  therapeutic 
interventions. The programme provided a strong founda-
tion for delivery organisations to forge lasting collabora-
tive  partnerships  that  can  be  extended  to  working  with 
other authorities and institutes. The results highlight path-
ways for prevention and intervention strategies to inform 
policymakers,  healthcare  professionals  and  third- sector 
organisations.

INTRODUCTION
Suicide  is  a  devastating  event,  inflicting  damaging 
consequences  on  families,  friends  and  colleagues. 
Within a military context, there is often a percep-
tion that military veterans’ suicides directly correlate 
with the impact of serving in hostile environments. 
However,  the  factors  leading  to  someone  taking 
their own life are often extremely complicated and 

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
 ⇒ Suicide is a devastating event, inflicting 

damaging consequences on families, friends 
and colleagues.

WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
 ⇒ Evidence that unresolved traumatic effects 
related to Operational Tours caused service- 
users to require support.

 ⇒ A personalised care plan with tailored 

intervention options led to improvements in 
participants’ social networking, social activities, 
club membership and having people to rely on.

HOW THE STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, 
PRACTICE OR POLICY
 ⇒ The programme provides a strong foundation 
for delivery organisations to forge lasting 
collaborative partnerships that can be extended 
to working with other authorities and institutes.
 ⇒ The findings illustrated protective factors which 
facilitate the development and implementation 
of prevention and intervention strategies and 
policy.

influenced  by  numerous  situational  factors  and 
personal beliefs.1

In 2021, the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust 
(the  Trust)  allocated  >£2  million  for  2- year  ‘One 
Is Too Many’ (OITM) projects designed to have a 
clear  and  demonstrable  impact  on  suicide  preven-
tion  by  providing  the  following:  a  better  under-
standing  of  the  issues;  timely  intervention;  peer 
support  while  addressing  the  barriers  to  accessing 
healthcare.  The  grant  holders  for  this  evaluation 
were the Royal Marines Charity (RMA), the Forces 
Employment  Charity,  Inspire  and  Adferiad.  They 
offered  interventions  that  included  mental  health 
(MH) assessments, psychotherapeutic options such 
as  cognitive–behavioural  therapy  (CBT),  counsel-
ling  and  medication.  There  were  group  activities, 
social  prescribing  events  such  as  equine  therapy, 
peer support mentoring, life skills coaching, educa-
tional courses and practical help with housing and 
employment (see table 1). Clients were not enrolled 
on concurrent interventions or treatment.

In  2021,  the  programme  was  launched  with 
an  engagement  event  including  workshops  to 
help  prepare  grant  holders  for  the  challenges  that 
lay  ahead  including  ethical  considerations  (see 
figure  1).  The  UK  National  Institute  for  Health 
and  Care  Services  state  that  consideration  should 
be given to measuring activities designed to prevent

suicide,2  and  this  evaluation  commenced  in  August  2021  and 
concluded in July 2023.

There  are  approximately  1.85  million  British  Armed  Forces 
veterans  in  England  and  Wales.3  Veterans  can  receive  support 
from a general practitioner or access NHS priority treatment for 
MH conditions attributable to their military service. Under this 
banner,  NHS  England’s  Op  COURAGE:  The  Veterans  Mental 
Health and Wellbeing Service provides specialised MH support 
including  partnerships  with  community/voluntary  third- sector 
services.4

Office  for  National  Statistics5  reported  that  in  2021,  there 
were  5583  suicides  registered  in  England  and  Wales,  equiva-
lent to a rate of 10.7 deaths per 100 000 people. Of these, 74% 
(n=4129) were men which is the equivalent to 16.0 deaths per 

100 000  and  for  women  there  were  5.5  deaths  per  100 000. 
Among females, the age- specific suicide rate was highest in those 
aged  45–49  years  (7.8  deaths  per  100,000),  and  among  males 
highest  in  those  aged  50–54  years  (22.7  deaths  per  100  000). 
Suicides were lowest among people aged under 20 and over 70. 
Overall rates in Northern Ireland were 14.3 deaths per 100 000.6
The social contexts and causes of self- harming behaviour are 
complex,  although  usually  associated  with  a  number  of  situa-
tional stressors.7 8 However, research comparing the prevalence 
of suicide and suicidal ideation in the veteran community with the 
civilian population has identified no significant differences.9–12

Factors  associated  with  the  risk  of  suicide  in  veterans 
include  the  following:  being  a  young  male  (under  28  years); 
discharging as an Early Service Leaver (ESL) (within 4 years of

enlistment)12  13;  females  over  40  years;  having  depression  or 
alcohol problems10 12 13; combat experience14; those who sustain 
injuries,15  unemployed16  and  reservists.15  Veterans  who  expe-
rienced  adverse  life  events  before  enlisting,  or  had  difficulties 
adjusting to civilian life, may be at higher risk.16 Post- traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) increased the risk of suicide in veterans 
compared  with  the  civilian  population  and  was  found  to  be 
significantly  related  to  suicidal  thoughts,  plans  and  previous 
attempts.10 Female veterans were found to be at higher risk of 
suicide  than  female  civilians,  although  there  was  no  statistical 
difference between male veterans and female veterans.9 Veterans 
who  delayed  seeking  help  for  MH  difficulties  reported  more 
suicidal ideation which supports the stance that veterans often 
fail to seek help until they are in crisis.13 17

Aims and objectives
Aim
To  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  OITM  programmes  and 
make recommendations for development.

Objectives
1.  Identify  trends  and  risk  factors  (including  gender  and  age) 
and  indicate  if  vulnerable  groups  were  prone  to  significant 
MH issues (eg, whether aspects of their life or military ser-
vice contributed to self- harming or potential suicide).

2.  Provide insights into areas such as employment, accommoda-
tion, social isolation and help- seeking behaviour and provide 
indicators of the situational factors causing distress and po-
tential self- harming/suicide.

3.  Gauge  participants’  views  regarding  their  satisfaction  with 
the  OITM  programmes  and  the  impact  on  their  quality  of 
life.

METHOD
A  survey  including  tick  boxes  and  Likert  scale  questions  was 
completed  at  programme  entry  and  exit.  This  replicated  the 
survey  designed  for  a  previous  Trust  project.18  The  survey 
captured  data  regarding  demographic  and  military- specific 
details,  health  status,  situational  stressors,  predisposing  symp-
toms, help- seeking behaviour, social engagement, housing, living 
arrangement  and  employment  status.  The  exit  survey  offered 
grant  holders  the  option  to  record  their  satisfaction.  Psycho-
metric  questionnaire  scores  were  included  if  they  were  used 
as  part  of  the  grant  holder’s  assessment  process  and  included 
the  Patient  Health  Questionnaire- 9  (PHQ- 9),  and  Generalised 
Anxiety  Disorder- 7  (GAD- 7).  The  entry  survey  took  approxi-
mately  15 min  to  complete  and  the  exit  survey  took  12 min  to 
complete. The evaluation was completed between August 2021 
and July 2023.

Data analysis
Completed  questionnaires  were  downloaded  and  exported 
from  the  Jisc  online  survey  portal  and  inputted  into  the  IBM 
SPSS  Statistics  software  database  V.27.  Quantitative  data  anal-
ysis  included  descriptive  statistics  of  frequency  distributions, 
and  paired- sample  t- tests  facilitated  comparisons  between  the 
completed questionnaires at programme entry and exit. Appro-
priate  bivariate  correlations  supported  the  exploration  of  rela-
tionships  between  variables  to  identify  multifactorial  causes  of 
poor  MH  outcomes  in  veterans  entering  the  programme.  The 
following  values  were  used  to  interpret  and  determine  the 
strength  of  the  correlations.  The  latter  comprised  negligible 
correlation: 0.00–0.10, weak correlation: 0.10–0.39, moderate 

Original research

correlation: 0.40–0.69, strong correlation: 0.70–0.89 and very 
strong  correlation:  0.90–100.  For  all  analyses,  a  p  value  of 
<0.05 was considered statistically significant.19

RESULTS
There  were  597  participants  who  received  an  entry  question-
naire of which 84% (n=503) were completed and 71% (n=423) 
for exit questionnaires. Participants engaged in an average of two 
interventions,  incorporating  MH  therapy  or  counselling  71% 
(n=181) with CBT including eye movement desensitisation and 
reprocessing.  Group  activities  35%  (n=89),  MH  assessments 
23%  (n=58),  MH  medication  8%  (n=20)  and  other  activities 
13% (n=34), such as help with housing and employment, educa-
tional courses, family mediation or participation in equine or art 
therapy.

Demographics, service history and Operational Tour (OT) 
profile
Participants  were  96%  (n=483)  male  and  4%  (n=20)  female, 
with a mean age of 45 years. Sexual orientation was 99% (n=465) 
heterosexual,  with  1%  (n=7)  from  the  Lesbian  Gay  Bisexual 
Transgender Queer (LBGTQ) community. Further demographic 
details on status ethnicity and religion are in table 2.

Participants  were  predominately  from  the  Army  53% 
(n=267), in regular service 97% (n=486) and a private soldier 
or equivalent when they left the Armed Forces (55%, n=262). 
The  mean  length  of  service  was  12  years  (n=66,  median=10; 
mode=6; SD=7.52; range 1–32 years); 3% (n=2) were ESLs, 
leaving inside 1 year and 12% (n=8) served for less than 4 years. 
The  majority  76%  (n=362)  conducted  OTs  (see  table  2).  A 
significant relationship was observed between whether a veteran 
had  conducted  OTs  and  service- linked  trauma  (χ2(2,  n=465) 
= 108.89, p<0.05), and although relationships were observed 
between the number of OTs and service- linked trauma, this was 
not significant (χ2(10, n=305) = 8.963, p=0.536).

Veteran trauma related to military service
Seventy- seven per cent (n=367) of veterans reported exposure 
to  a  traumatic  event  during  their  service,  with  a  mean  of  two 
events  (median=2;  mode=2;  SD=1.75;  range  1–5  traumas). 
Traumatic  events  (which  were  not  mutually  exclusive)  were 
reported  as  conflict/contact  situations  58%  (n=289),  followed 
by personal attack 29% (n=146), abuse 23% (n=116) and acci-
dents 23% (n=113). The mean rating of the most traumatic event 
reported  was  graded  at  9,  ranging  from  0  (minimum  distress) 
to  10  (maximum  distress).  There  was  a  significant  correlation 
between number of years served and number of traumatic events 
experienced (r(402)=0.295, p≤0.05), indicating the longer the 
service,  the  greater  number  of  traumatic  events  experienced. 
A  significant  correlation  was  observed  between  the  number  of 
traumatic  events  experienced  during  service  and  depression 
scores on entry (r(450)=0.237, p≤0.05), and a correlation was 
also observed between traumatic events experienced and anxiety 
(r(450)=.170, p=0.097), but this was not statically significant.

Discharge, physical and mental health
The most common reasons for leaving the Armed Forces were 
the  end  of  the  contract  (32%,  n=152),  premature  voluntary 
release 25% (n=119) and medical discharge 25% (n=116). On 
entry, 83% (n=393) self- reported long- standing physical or MH 
problems and they were affected by an average of two illnesses 
(median  3;  mode  4;  SD  1.61;  range  1–7).  The  most  common 
being depression (55%, n=275), anxiety (53%, n=267), PTSD

(51%,  n=257)  and  musculoskeletal/back  problems  (25%,

depression  35%  (n=147),  anxiety  37%  (n=156),  PTSD  40% 
(n=170) and musculoskeletal problems 15% (n=66). Although 
changes were observed at exit, with veterans self- reporting fewer 
illnesses, a paired samples t- test indicated this was not significant 
(t(269) = 1.67, p=0.096).

Predisposing factors and symptom
A mean of five predisposing factors was reported by veterans on 
entry (median=4; mode=4; SD=3.00; range 1–16). The most 

common  were  as  follows:  unresolved  trauma  66%  (n=334), 
traumatic  exposure  53%  (n=268)  and  family  problems  47% 
(n=235).  Exit  details  showed  notable  reductions  in  all  areas 
with  an  increase  in  only  dementia.  On  admission,  participants 
reported  a  mean  of  nine  symptoms  (median=9;  mode=11; 
SD=4.49; range 1–17). These were anxiety 79% (n=396), low 
mood 78% (n=394) and included feelings of hopelessness 67% 
(n=334). At exit, there were decreases in every criterion, with 
self- reported  factors  reducing  from  five  to  two  and  symptoms 
from  nine  to  three.  Self- reported  illnesses  remained  the  same 
(n=2) (see figure 2).

Original research

On entry, correlations were observed between the number of 
traumatic events experienced during service and the number of 
reported  illnesses  (r(450)=0.121,  p>0.05).  Also,  the  number 
of  reported  predisposing  factors  (r(450)=0.395,  p<0.05)  and 
number  of  reported  symptoms  (r(450)=0.439,  p<0.05),  both 
of  which  were  significant  and  indicates  a  relationship  between 
exposure to trauma and the number of factors and symptoms.

Support services
Fifty- one per cent (n=239) reported having previously accessed 
support  with  the  majority  contacting  a  mean  of  two  organisa-
tions, most commonly from the NHS 51% (n=121) and char-
ities  43%  (n=103).  Forty- nine  per  cent  (n=232)  stated  that 
they  delayed  help- seeking,  with  a  mean  of  two  factors,  most 
commonly ‘finding it hard to ask for help’ at 30% (n=69) and 
‘being  unaware  of  the  available  support’  at  18%  (n=41).  The 
most  common  programme  entry  was  by  self- referral  (36%, 
n=179) then charities (16%, n=80).

Social networks
Twenty- four  per  cent  (n=112)  reported  having  ‘no  one’  to 
rely  on.  Regarding  social  interactions,  most  met  people  ‘once 
or  twice  a  month’  (31%,  n=118)  and  ‘once  or  twice  a  week’ 
(28%, n=107). Seventy- eight per cent (n=310) were not active 
members  of  clubs.  On  exit,  this  decreased  to  64%  (n=189). 
Regarding engagement in social activities, on entry, participants 
54% (n=236) were ‘much less than most’ which at exit reduced 
to 17% (n=49). Following the projects, improvements in social 
networks  were  significant  for  ‘taking  part  in  social  activities’ 
(χ2(20,  n=265)  =  34.58,  p<0.05),  ‘active  members  of  clubs’ 
(χ2(2, n=269) = 10.83, p<0.05) and ‘relying on people’ (χ2(4, 
n=364) = 29.37, p<0.05).

Employment and housing
Employed service- users were 44% (n=221) with 39% (n=196) 
unemployed. On exit, employment increased to 48% (n=188) 
with unemployment falling to 32% (n=124). Significant employ-
ment  differences  were  found  between  grant  holders  (χ2(15)  = 
32.72, p<0.05). Homeowners were 45% (n=204), those living 
in rented accommodation were 37% (n=171) and 3% (n=16) 
were homeless. On exit, 45% (n=177) were homeowners, 39% 
(n=152) were living in rented accommodation, and 3% (n=12) 
were homeless. There were 43% (n=201) of participants living 
with  their  spouse/partner,  followed  by  36%  (n=168)  living 
alone.  On  exit,  46%  (n=182)  were  living  with  their  spouse/
partner and 33% (n=129) were living alone. The main status is 
in tables 3 and 4.

A one- way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed a significant 
difference  between  age  and  housing  status  (F(3,  439)=13.87, 
p>0.05).  Post- hoc  comparison  tests  using  the  Tukey  HSD  test 
indicated  significant  differences  across  age  groups  (18–30, 
31–50, 51–70) and housing status although there was no signif-
icant  difference  between  age  groups  and  the  older  age  group 
(71–85).  This  indicates  that  although  differences  in  housing 
were apparent across age groups, the older veterans were more 
stable in terms of housing status.

Psychometric questionnaires and satisfaction
On  programme  entry,  PHQ- 9  and  GAD- 7  scores  revealed  a 
sample  with  moderate  to  moderately  severe  depression  and 
severe  anxiety.  On  exit,  paired  sample  t- tests  indicated  signifi-
cant  differences  across  improvements  for  the  PHQ- 9  (t(16)  = 
6.38,  p<0.01)  and  GAD- 7  (t(18)  =  5.55,  p<0.05),  meaning 
significant  reductions  in  depression  and  anxiety  were  present. 
Participant  satisfaction  was  94%  (n=364)  and  positive  impact 
on quality of life was rated with a mean score of 9 (ranging from 
0 no impact to 10 maximum impact).

DISCUSSION
The  grant  holder’s  dedication, 
intelligent  application  of 
resources  and  timely  therapeutic  and  social  prescribing  inter-
ventions alongside participant engagement within a safe setting 
resulted  in  widespread  accomplishments  with  reductions  in 
depression  and  anxiety,  improved  health  and  well- being  and 
better social interactions. Flexibility and responsiveness to refer-
rals, empathetic peer support with collaborative networking and 
connectivity  helped  reduce  the  situational  stressors  leading  to 
self- harming and may have reduced suicide.

Participants’ mean age was 45 years old. For men, lower than 
the  civilian  equivalent  of  suicide  rates  at  50–54  years  but  for 
women comparable to the civilian population most at risk.5 This 
indicates that the grant holders were reaching their target vulner-
able  age  group.  Service- users  were  younger  than  the  overall 
median age of UK veterans. where almost one- third are 80 years 
old  or  over.3  While  suicide  rates  begin  to  drop  in  those  aged 
over 70 years old, it does however rise again from 85 onwards 
in a vulnerable group due to factors including failing health and 
bereavement of loved ones.5

Only 4% (n=20) of participants were women which is below 
the 11.2% of women serving in the British Armed Forces.20 This 
may indicate that men experienced severe MH issues and women 
did  not,  or  that  women  did  not  want  to  access  the  service,  or 
they may have been unaware of the programme. Female veterans 
were less likely to deploy in front- line combat areas, and many 
take  on  professional  roles  such  as  doctors  and  nurses,  so  they 
may  be  a  less  vulnerable  group.  Without  data,  it  is  impossible 
to state exactly why women were under- represented as they do 
commit  suicide.  The  evaluation  reinforces  the  requirement  to 
further  explore  initiatives  to  engage  with  female  veterans  and 
to  examine  the  impact  of  gender- related  experiences  during 
military  service  on  female  veterans’  help- seeking  behaviour.  In

addition, ethnic minorities represent 9.6% of the British Armed 
Forces20 but only 1% in this programme.

Service history
Ninety- seven per cent completed regular service, indicating that 
reservists  were  not  attracted  into  the  programmes.  However, 
as  risk  factors  are  situational  stressors,  age- related  or  aligned 
to MH issues such as depression or alcohol misuse, then more 
reservists  were  anticipated.  Considering  reservists  were  used 
extensively  during  operations  in  Afghanistan  (2002–2014) 
and Iraq (2003–2011), why they have not been engaged needs 
further exploration. Seventy- six per cent completed an OT, and 
77%  were  exposed  to  a  traumatic  event  during  service.  These 
incidents  increase  the  likelihood  of  MH  issues  such  as  PTSD. 
Correlations  confirmed  a  relationship  between  service- linked 
trauma and those who had completed an OT. Also, significant 
correlations  were  observed  between  the  number  of  traumatic 
events experienced during service and the number of reported 
situational  factors  and  the  number  of  reported  symptoms  on 
entry,  which  is  an  indication  that  it  is  the  negative  impact  of 
unresolved traumatic effects that cause service- users to require 
support.

Health
At  entry,  83%  reported  long- standing  physical  or  MH  illness, 
with over 50% reporting depression, anxiety and PTSD. These 
figures  are  likely  to  be  higher  due  to  individual  attestation 
but  considerably  higher  than  UK  veterans  generally.21  All  MH 
morbidity  had  notably  decreased  at  exit.  The  psychometric 
PHQ- 9  and  GAD- 7  scores  at  entry  indicated  veterans  were 
exhibiting severe anxiety and moderately severe depression and 
reflected the self- reported health findings. These questionnaires 
reaffirmed  improvements  against  all  measures  at  exit  from  the 
programme. The findings reflect the outcomes from a National 
Health  Service  England  Op  COURAGE  High  Intensity  Service 
evaluation  which  concluded  that  early  peer  support  followed 
by social prescribing and clinical interventions can have positive 
outcomes.22

Stressful  life  events  such  as  financial  problems,  unemploy-
ment  and  relationship  instability  are  considered  to  be  high- 
risk  factors  contributing  to  suicide.23  Veterans  presented  with 
an  average  of  five  predisposing  factors  ranging  from  1  to  15 
including unresolved trauma (66%), traumatic exposure (53%) 
and family stress (47%). Exit details showed notable reductions 
in all areas with situational stressors reducing from five to two 
which resulted in significant improvements to the participants’ 

well- being and is a clear indication of the programme’s success. 
The results indicated that reducing/resolving even one situational 
stressor in a timely and effective manner can have a meaningful 
bearing on the individual and re- energise and motivate them to 
address  other  issues.  Therefore,  projects  that  concentrate  on 
issues such as accommodation and employment can have much 
wider benefits.

Service users had  a mean of nine symptoms  with  a  range  of 
1–17.  Most  common  were  anxiety  (79%),  low  mood  (78%) 
with feelings of hopelessness (67%) and lack of interest (63%), 
symptoms concurrently linked to depression.24 At exit, there was 
a  significant  reduction  in  symptoms  from  nine  to  three  repre-
senting  tangible  advantages  for  the  beneficiaries.  Service- users 
presenting  with  a  lack  of  interest  and  feelings  of  hopelessness 
would  have  presented  the  grant  holders  with  challenges  in 
getting  clients  motivated  to  be  involved  in  any  activity.  That 
they did may be due to the focus on veteran- specific services and 
peer support workers who provided this vulnerable group with a 
sense of identification with those offering the support.

Help-seeking behaviour and social isolation
Fifty- one per cent of participants had previously sought support, 
most commonly via NHS facilities and charities. It was not clear 
how  many  of  these  engagements  were  related  to  a  self- harm 
attempt  or  feeling  suicidal,  but  does  reveal  that  some  of  them 
did  not  receive  the  support  they  required,  or  were  discharged 
only  for  their  problems  to  resurface.  That  36%  self- referred 
to  the  OITM  programme  clearly  demonstrates  how  important 
this  option  is.  Forty- nine  per  cent  delayed  seeking  help,  and 
improving  knowledge  and  access  to  Primary  Healthcare  and 
veteran- specific  services  together  with  investment  in  destig-
matising  MH  are  further  required.25  26  There  was  a  significant 
improvement in the participants’ social networking, social activ-
ities, club membership and having people to rely on. The partici-
pants of varying ages seemed motivated to connect with a variety 
of social engagement opportunities as many of the activities had 
a  physical  exertion  component  which  potentially  would  have 
enhanced  their  mood.  Identification  with  a  particular  charity 
such as the RMA appears to be a particularly useful way of tack-
ling  this  conundrum.  How  this  progresses  over  time  was  not 
identified,  but  the  hope  would  be  for  long- term  engagement, 
motivation and benefits.

Employment and housing
Veterans may face challenges with employment27 and housing.28 
On  entry,  39%  of  participants  were  unemployed,  11%  were

retired  and  44%  were  employed.  Although  the  age  range  is 
different, the Ministry of Defence estimates that 79% of work-
ing- age veterans were employed and 3% were unemployed.29 So 
there is a marked difference, and stable well- paid employment 
is  extremely  important  to  MH  and  well- being.  Following  exit, 
unemployment  rates  fell  by  7%  and  there  was  a  4%  increase 
in  employment.  That  32%  of  veterans  were  still  unemployed 
provides an identifiable area for improvement.

The  2021  Census30  revealed  that  75%  of  veterans  owned 
their accommodation outright or held a mortgage. With OITM 
participants, homeowners were significantly lower at 45%, with 
a further 37% in rented accommodation, and 3% homeless. This 
reaffirms that employment and housing status are contributing 
significantly  to  the  service- users  distress.  Targeting  these  issues 
while gaining a better understanding of the life trajectory after 
leaving the Armed Forces is required, including those who are 
homeless or required to access judicial services.

At 94%, the majority of participants were satisfied across all 
programmes, rating the interventions at 9 out of 10 in relation 
to the positive impact on their quality of life. The study recom-
mendations are given in table 5.

Limitations
The results do not indicate sustained improvements, and a longi-
tudinal  study,  qualitative  interviews  and  cost–benefit  analysis 
are required to determine sustainable long- term benefits. There 
were  low  numbers  of  females,  ethnic  minorities,  LGBTQ  and 
elderly veterans >70 years old. There is no comparison between 
the different programmes.

Conclusions
OITM  provides  a  strong  foundation  for  delivery  organisations 
to forge lasting collaborative partnerships that can be extended 
to working with other authorities and institutes, governmental 
agencies,  charities,  businesses  and  appropriate  networks.  Most 
importantly,  it  presented  another  option  to  veterans  and  their 
families who need help. However, there are significant emotional 
challenges for the staff providing care to vulnerable veterans, and 
this raises concerns regarding the impact on their mental health. 
The findings illustrated suicide risk and protective factors which 
facilitate  the  development  and  implementation  of  preventative 
and  intervention  strategies  to  inform  policymakers,  healthcare 
professionals  and  third- sector  organisations  of  a  direction  of 
travel that has palpable benefits.
