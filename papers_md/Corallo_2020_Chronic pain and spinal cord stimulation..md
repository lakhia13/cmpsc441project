Abstract
Chronic pain can have a devastating impact and lead to patient isolation. Many people with chronic pain are predisposed to anxiety-
depressant symptoms, due to a lower quality life. The aim of the study is to demonstrate how neuromodulation methods, can
encourage the reduction of chronic pain and an improvement in the quality of life, therefore advancing the restoration of psychological
well-being.

We involved 50 patients with a diagnosis of pain that not respond to traditional pharmacological therapies. Interventions: All subject
had depression and anxiety symptoms and a low-quality life. We used the spinal cord stimulation treatment and a psychological
evaluation for assessment of depression-anxiety symptomatology and the level of quality life.

We observed a signiﬁcant difference in physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, general health perceptions,

vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and mental health.

Our study afﬁrms that the perception of chronic pain has a great impact on the perception of psychological well-being, quality of life,

and the performance of normal daily social and professional activities.

1. Introduction

Chronic pain is any agony that has persisted for more than
6 months and is not related to a continuous peripheral disease
process.[1] Unlike acute pain, lasting less than 3 months, it has no
biological utility[2]; it is rarely diagnosed, and it does not react to
medical treatment, as long as it is completely relieved. The patient
tests chronic pain as unresolved persistence of acute pain that keeps

more after due. In this way, the experience of chronic pain often
involves a prolonged process in which the patient experiments a
series of disastrous interventions. The chronic pain can lead to a
series of negative perception that can have a signiﬁcant impact on
functionality levels and pain tolerance.[3,4] Many people with
chronic pain are less able or unable to perform a variety of daily
activities, they have difﬁculties sleeping or doing domestic activities,
or having sex or to keep a stable relationship; additionally, they
have not an independent lifestyle.[5] This condition can lead a
signiﬁcant risk of depression and anxiety symptomatology for
various reasons.[6] First, the presence of chronic pain can inﬂuence
the course of the disease and the insurgence of depression and
anxiety.[7–16] Second, chronic diseases and pain can lead to the use
of negative coping strategies, disability and a reduced quality of
life[16,17]; quality of life means the possibility/ability of an individual
to perform the multiplicity of roles assigned to him/her in society,
drawing an acceptable level of psychological, professional and
economic satisfaction.[18] Third, several studies suppose shared
pathophysiological mechanisms for chronic somatic diseases and
pain, and depression and anxiety,[19–21] survey neuromodulation
methods. They are an efﬁcient alternative when pharmacological
and surgical treatments are not effective in controlling pain. In
particular, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is the most incisive. The
ﬁrst use of neuromodulation methods is the Neurostimulation of
the spinal cord and peripheral nerves (SCS) by Shealy et al in
1967.[22] Several studies have reported that the 50% of patients
treated with neurostimulation achieves an improvement in pain
relief.[23–31] It also reduces the opioid use and quality of life
improves in most patients treated with SCS.[32] For years, SCS was
successfully used to treat selected patients with chronic pain,
particularly failed back surgery syndrome patients.

In general, the SCS has several advantages compared to a

procedure, it has a very low rate of mortality[33]; is a completely
reversible procedure and, before implanting a permanent system,
patients are screened for physiological responses, with temporary
percutaneous electrodes emulating the pain-relieving effects of
the implanted system. Candidates for SCS are also subjected to
psychological evaluation to address possible depression or other
comorbidities.[34–36]

The aim of the study is to demonstrate how neuromodulation
methods,
in particular SCS (spinal cord stimulation), can
encourage the reduction of chronic pain and an improvement
in the quality of life, therefore advancing the restoration of
psychological well-being.

2. Materials and methods

This observational study was conducted on a sample of 50
patients with a diagnosis of chronic pain from 6 months recruited
at the IRCCS Centro Neurolesi “Bonino Pulejo,” in antalgic
therapy ambulatory. The patients recruited did not respond to
traditional pharmacological therapies for chronic pain (paracet-
amol, non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs, opioids, anticon-
vulsants and cortisone). All subjects gave written consent to the
study. Patients showed severe algic syndrome: chronic cervical
and lumbar radiculopathy, post-traumatic brachial neuropathy
and back pain and a moderate chronic pain. The exclusion
parameters were the presence of psychiatric disorders, severe
cognitive alteration, neurodegenerative disorders. All subjects
had chronic pain associated with anxiety and depression
symptomatology and a very low quality of life. We introduced
a cable located in the epidural space using a Tuohy needle and
connected to an implantable subcutaneous pulse generator,
which contains the power source and electronics to provide
programmable stimulations. The SCS treatment[37] started with
percutaneous placement of a temporary electrode for a
therapeutic test lasting at least 3 days for testing the system.
Then, patients may receive permanent implantation if they have
reported an estimate of at least 50% pain relief[38] based on
standard pain assessment methods. The test employed to
psychological disease were Beck depression inventory (BDI-II),
Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAM-A), short form health
survey 36 (SF-36) and numerical rating scale (NRS) in 2 stages, at
the initial assessment (T0) and after eight months from T0 (T1).
BDI-II
is a self-assessment questionnaire composed by 21
multiple-choice items. The score tolerates from 0 to 63: a score
of 0 to 13 absence of depressive, from 14 to 19 mild depressions,
between 27 and 29 moderate depression and ﬁnally 30 to 63
severe depression.[39] HAM-A measures the subjective severity of
anxiety symptoms in the previous 7 days. It has long been used as
an indicator of anxiolytics in panic disorder (PD) and general
anxiety disorder. Each item is marked on a scale from 0 (not
present) to 4 (severe), with a total score of 0 to 56, where a
point < 14 indicates no symptoms presence, ≥14 to 17 indicates
meekness, 18 to 24 from mild to moderate, > 25 severe symptoms
presence.[40] The SF-36 is a short questionnaire (36 items) that
assesses 8 dimensions: physical functioning, social functioning,
limitations due to physical problems,
limitations due to
emotional problems, mental health, energy/life, pain and general
health perception. The levels of anxiety, depression and quality of
life were compared with the levels of pain, extrapolated from the
results of the NRS.[41–43] NRS is a quantitative, one-dimensional,
11-point, quantitative clinical scale of pain assessment; in this
scale the patient selects the number describing the intensity of the

pain, from 0 to 10. The method of SCS was used to compare it
with the diminution of chronic pain, anxiety-depressant
symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.

3. Results

3.1. Statistical analysis

The analysis was conducted with descriptive statistic of
respondent’s sociodemographic characteristic, followed by the
mean, standard deviation of sample. Normal distribution of the
data was evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. The
Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used in order to compare the
clinical variables (BDI-II, HAM-A, and NRS) and SF-36 sub-
scores at T0 and T1. Finally, we performed an interaction effect
analysis (improved time) by calculating the T1–T0 differences in
variables scores to correlate by the Spearman’s coefﬁcient, clinical
variables with SF-36 sub-scores. Analyses were performed using
an open source R3.0 software package (R Foundation for
Statistical Computer, Vienna, Austria). A 95% of conﬁdence
level was set with a 5% alpha error. Statistical signiﬁcance was set
at P < .05.

4. Results

Socio-demographic and characteristics of patients and caregivers
showed in Table 1 and Figure 1. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test
showed a highly signiﬁcant difference in BDI (P < .001), HAM-A
(P < .01) and in NRS (P = .004) (Table 2). In SF-36 scores, we
observed a signiﬁcant difference between T0 and T1 in physical
functioning (P = .001), role limitations due to physical health
(P < .001), general health perceptions (P < .001), vitality (P
< .001), social functioning (P < .001), role limitations due to
emotional problems (P = .001) and mental health (P < .002) but
no signiﬁcance difference in bodily pain (P = .17). Spearman’s
coefﬁcient showed a signiﬁcant positive correlation between NRS
and BDI-II (r = 0.48; P = .05), and between NRS and HAM-A (r =
0.53; P = 0.03). Moreover, in SF-36 sub-scores we highlighted
signiﬁcant negative correlation with NRS and physical function-
ing (r = (cid:1)0.51; P = 0.03), bodily pain general health perceptions

5. Discussion

Chronic pain often precedes physical and psychosocial changes.
Everyday life becomes particularly heavy, due to pain that
accompanies all daily activities: also, the simplest actions can be
problematic, and this causes the person to isolate himself,
withdrawing from his anxieties and sufferings. Pain implies a
limitation of physical abilities and movement abilities, invalid-
ating the autonomy of the person. The results of our study show
that there has been a decrease in algic symptoms and an

improvement in the quality of life, as a result of the use of the
latest technologies. They have facilitated a better adaptation of
the patient to daily life, reducing the pain perception and also
the anxious-depressive symptoms. Therefore, alternative meth-
ods to traditional drug treatments bring relief to patients and
ensure an improvement in psycho-physical well-being. These
results have shown that painful perception, anxiety-depressant
symptoms and quality of
life, respectively, decrease and
increase, highlighting a signiﬁcant correlation between pain
and psychological disorders. Other studies[44] demonstrate and
deﬁne chronic pain as social and moral pain, emphasizing how
chronic pain can put the subject in a state of psychological
distress associated to anxiety for socially incorrect or destructive
behavior. The social life of these subjects is characterized by
retirement and self-criticism, probably due to shame for
themselves, embarrassment, vulnerability to criticism and fear
of punishment. The direct consequence is a lower quality of life,
which is perceived by the patient in measure to health.[45–49] The
quality of life is a not well known, but the pain is a critical factor
that conditioned patient’s life. Chronic pain causes a focus on
the problem, producing distress, fear, a sense of loneliness and a
progressive withdrawal from social relationships; isolation, in
turn, makes suffering and the feeling of helplessness even more
burdensome. To measure patients’ perception of daily func-
tioning, physical, social and psychological well-being, various
instruments like HRQoL, SF-36 and heart rate measurement
were used.[46–48,50] These measurements showed that
the
depressive symptoms are the most present and also the most
disabling and they sometimes resulted life-threatening or fatal
results.[51,52] In this study we have also used the BDI II to
evaluate depressive symptoms. Depression symptomatology
ampliﬁes the experience and perception of pain[53]; the SF-36
can be a useful clinical instrument to measure the depression
severity and also the quality of life in patients with chronic pain.
In this study we have also used the BDI II to evaluate depressive
symptoms. The reduction of chronic pain, achieved by SCS, has
decreased the levels of anxiety and depression symptomatology

changing in the subject’s daily life. Therefore, non-invasive
neuromodulation methods are an efﬁcient alternative when
pharmacological and surgical treatments are not effective in
pain management.
