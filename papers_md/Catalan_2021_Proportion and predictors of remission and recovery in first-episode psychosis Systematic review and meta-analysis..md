Abstract

Background. To determine the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission and recovery
following a first-episode of psychosis (FEP).
Methods. A multistep literature search using the Web of Science database, Cochrane Central
Register of Reviews, Ovid/PsychINFO, and trial registries from database inception to November
5, 2020, was performed. Cohort studies and randomized control trials (RCT) investigating the
proportion of remission and recovery following a FEP were included. Two independent
researchers searched, following PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines and using a PROSPERO
protocol. We performed meta-analyses regarding the proportion of remission/recovery (symp-
tomatic plus functional outcomes). Heterogeneity was measured employing Q statistics and I2
test. To identify potential predictors, meta-regression analyses were conducted, as well as
qualitative reporting of studies included in a systematic review. Sensitivity analyses were
performed regarding different times of follow-up and type of studies.
Results. One hundred articles (82 cohorts and 18 RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis. The
pooled proportion of symptomatic remission was 54% (95%CI [30, 49–58]) over a mean follow-
up period of 43.57 months (SD = 51.82) in 76 studies. After excluding RCT from the sample, the
proportion of remission remained similar (55%). The pooled proportion of recovery was 32%
(95%CI [27–36]) over a mean follow-up period of 71.85 months (SD = 73.54) in 40 studies. After
excluding RCT from the sample, the recovery proportion remained the same. No significant
effect of any sociodemographic or clinical predictor was found.
Conclusions. Half of the patients are in symptomatic remission around 4 years after the FEP,
while about a third show recovery after 5.5 years.

Introduction

After the first-episode of psychosis (FEP), the disorder can display a severe cognitive and
behavioral decline that worsens symptoms and poor functioning [1,2]. Outcomes are highly
influenced by early interventions’ timing and efficacy, which can improve symptoms and restore
social and occupational functioning [3–5]. Accumulated evidence indicates that the early years
after a FEP are critical for remission and recovery in psychosis [4,6]. Over the past decade, the
criteria of The Remission Schizophrenia Working Group (RSWG) have been adopted as a
common measure of symptomatic remission in clinical studies [7,9]. According to the RSWG,
symptomatic remission is defined based on a fixed threshold for symptom severity (only mild or
absent symptoms) and a time component (sustained for at least 6 months) [10].

Ana Catalan et al.

While symptomatic remission can lead to recovery [10,11], the
latter is more broadly conceived. Contrary to remission, recovery
still lacks an accepted and validated definition [12]. There is con-
sensus that symptomatic remission should be one of the compo-
nents to be included in a definition of recovery [13]. Additionally, a
consensus initiative suggested that improvement in independent
living and in social and occupational/educational functioning for
more than 1 year are core defining features of recovery [12].

Given the clinical relevance of symptomatic remission and
recovery in FEP, considerable research has also been undertaken
to identify their predictors. In a previous meta-analysis on FEP
patients, 109 potential predictors of clinical outcomes were ana-
lyzed [14]. While this study concluded that medication nonadher-
ence, longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), and substance
misuse were core risk factors of relapse [14], no remission or
recovery predictors were analyzed in FEP. Another meta-analysis
[15] showed that cognitive deficits, concurrent remission and both
positive and negative symptoms were predictors of recovery in FEP.
However, in this meta-analysis, recovery was broadly defined by
global or social functioning measures, for example, Global Assess-
ment of Functioning (GAF), while changes in the severity of
symptoms were not incorporated [15].

To our knowledge, four meta-analyses [15–18] and three system-
atic reviews have investigated symptomatic remission and recovery
in FEP or schizophrenia [19–21]. Overall, these studies are limited by
a variety of outcome definitions used [20], are heterogeneous with
regard to individuals included in the analysis (first-episode or multi-
episode) [17], included both prospective and retrospective studies
and searched the literature only until 2016 [16].

The current systematic review and meta-analysis address the
gaps mentioned above. We included prospective studies until 2020
with first-episode psychosis spectrum disorder participants with
standardized definition of remission/recovery. The first aim of this
study was to assess pooled proportion of symptomatic remission
and recovery in FEP. The second aim was to identify potential
predictors of remission and recovery in FEP.

Methods

This study was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA, Sup-
plementary Table S1) [22] and Meta-analysis for Observational
Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines (Supplementary
following EQUATOR Reporting Guidelines

Search strategy and selection criteria

A systematic literature search was performed by two independent
researchers
(A.C., A.R.) using the following search terms:
“predictor*” “response” OR “outcome” OR “prognosis” OR
“response” OR “remission” OR “recovery” AND “psychosis” OR
“schizophrenia” OR “schizophreniform” OR “first-episode
psychosis” OR “early psychosis” AND “cohort” OR “case-control”
OR “RCT” OR “clinical trial.” A search was conducted in the Web
of Science (which includes Web of Science Core Collection, BIOSIS
Citation Index, KCI—Korean Journal Database, MEDLINE,
Russian Science Citation Index, and SciELO Citation Index), the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Ovid/ Psy-
chINFO databases, from inception until November 5, 2020. We
further searched references from included studies and reviews that

were screened during the literature search. Abstracts identified
were then screened, and after excluding those that were not eligible,
the full-text of the remaining articles were retrieved for further
inspection against the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

We included: (a) prospective studies with a minimum follow-up
of at least 6 months to detect remission or recovery. According to a
recent meta-analysis [5], we operationalized remission in the current
study as: (a) stability of symptoms and/or, (b) minimum symptom
severity for at least 6 months according to the RSWG remission
criteria [10], and (c) study-defined (see Supplementary Table S4 for
details); and recovery as: (a) symptom stability/minimum severity
plus
improved social, educational or vocational attainment,
(b) study-defined (for details see Supplementary Table S4), (c) FEP
patients (including nonaffective psychosis see below), and (d) peer-
reviewed original studies published in English. FEP was defined as
having the first contact with healthcare services (both inpatient and
outpatient settings), or less than 5 years of disorder [6] and oper-
ationalized criteria established by a clinical standard classification
(Diagnostic and Statistical Manual [DSM], International Classifica-
tion Disease [ICD] or Research Diagnostic Criteria [RDC] [25]).
When studies were reporting overlapping samples for the meta-
analyses, the study with the longest follow-up period was included.
If this was unclear, studies with the largest sample were included.

Data extraction

Three researchers (J.V.-S., G.M., and B.P.) independently extracted
data from all included studies, and any discrepancies were resolved
by consensus or by a third author (G.S.P.). The variables extracted
included: first author and year of publication, country, setting, topic
investigated, diagnostic classification method (DSM, ICD, and
RDC), sample size, age, gender, length of study follow-up, DUP,
study design, baseline presence of comorbidity, predictors of remis-
sion or recovery, the proportion of FEP patients exposed to anti-
psychotic treatment at baseline, the severity of baseline positive/
negative/general psychotic symptoms (mean scores and SD), cri-
teria used to define remission and recovery, quality assessment (see
below). We extracted the primary outcomes, defined as the pro-
portions of individuals with FEP who met the criteria for remission
or recovery (at each follow-up time point: 6–<12 months;
≥ 12(cid:1) < 24months; ≥ 24 (cid:1) < 36months; and ≥36monthsÞ.

Risk of bias (quality assessment)
Risk of bias was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle–
Ottawa Scale for case-control studies (Supplementary Table S3)
and cohorts. Studies were awarded a maximum of eight points on
items related to representativeness, sample size, group definition,
validity, outcomes and representativeness, exposure, outcomes,
follow-up period and loss to follow-up for cohort studies. The risk
of bias assessment was conducted independently by two researchers
(J.V.-S., G.S.P.). In cases of disagreement, a consensus was reached
through discussion and, when not possible, to obtain consensus, a
third researcher (A.C.) was included in the process.

Strategy for data synthesis

Specific meta-analyses were: (a) proportion of remission and
(b) recovery. Since heterogeneity was expected to be high, the
random-effect model was employed [26]. Heterogeneity among
studies was assessed using Q statistics, with the proportion of the
total variability in effect size estimates evaluated using the I2 index

European Psychiatry

(with an I2 > 50% representing significant heterogeneity) [27].
Publication biases were assessed for the proportion of remission
or recovery by inspecting funnel plots and assessing Egger’s test
[28]. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determinate the dif-
ferences depending on whether the RSWG criteria were used to
define remission or other broader definition was used; types of
included studies (cohorts, case-control study, RCTs), and length of
the follow-up period. In line with our hypotheses, we also per-
formed (c) meta-regressions to estimate the association between
potential predictors and remission and recovery proportions sep-
arately when data from at least 10 studies were available. The
predictors included clinical variables (e.g., the severity of baseline
positive/negative/general psychotic symptoms at baseline, DUP),
sociodemographic variables (e.g., age and gender), percentage of
FEP under antipsychotic treatment at baseline, length of follow-up,
and NOS quality assessment. All analyses were conducted using
STATA version 16 [29]. The significance level was set at a p < 0.05,
two-sided.

We also provided a systematic narrative synthesis of the
included studies around predictors of remission/recovery (supple-
mentary results).

Results

Characteristics of the included studies
Of 7267 articles identified, 100 (RCTs k = 18, observational studies
k = 82) studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 25375 FEP
individuals; Figure 1). The studies’ sample size ranged from 16 to
2960; the mean age of included participants was 26.18 (SD = 3.93)
years, and 67.8% of the sample was male in no overlapping samples.
The characteristics of the included studies are detailed in Supple-
mentary Tables S5 and S6.

Details of the operationalization criteria for remission and
recovery are listed in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5. Most studies
(N = 43, 57.33%) employed the RSWG criteria [10] to define
remission: having mild or absent symptoms (symptom severity
criteria) for at least 6 months (duration criteria). The remaining
studies (42.66%) employed broader operational remission criteria
to define significant symptomatic remission (24.14% of the studies
using more than one instrument, see Supplementary Table S5) with
no duration criteria.

Recovery was operationalized as

symptomatic remission
(16 studies [39.02%] using the RSWG criteria, and 24 studies
[60.97%] using broader remission criteria as described above)
and significant improvement in functioning. Functional improve-
ment involved the following domains: functioning status (19 stud-
ies, 46.34%), living independently (13 studies, 31.71%), working or
studying (21 studies, 51.23%), and social interactions (9 studies,
21.95%).

Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analyses were performed considering the duration of the
follow-up period (Figure 2), the definition of remission (RSWG
criteria [10] versus broader remission criteria), and the type of
study (cohorts, case-controls, and RCT).

Sensitivity analysis on follow-up period showed that
the
remission proportion was slightly reduced with the longer dur-
ation of the follow-up (Figure 2). Depending on which remission
criteria were applied, the proportion of remission varies (RWSG
remission criteria: k = 39; 52% (95%CI [30,46–58]); broader
remission criteria with no duration criteria: k = 37; 56% (95%
CI [30,49–62]). After excluding 15 RCTs from the analysis, the
remission proportion was 55%, 95%CI [30, 50–60] (I2: 97.93%,
z = 19.58).

Regarding recovery, sensitivity analysis on follow-up period
showed that the recovery proportion slightly increased the longer
the duration of the follow-up (Figure 2). A sensitivity analysis of
studies reporting recovery after ≥2 years and recovery at <2 years
were performed [30]. Six studies assessed recovery status after more
than 2 years (38%; 95%CI [30, 19–56]), while 34 studies assessed
recovery proportion in less than 2 years (30%; 95%CI [26–35]).
After exclusion of RCT, the recovery proportion was similar to the
pooled proportion (32%, 95%CI [27–37]).

Meta-regressions

The effect of different predictors of remission proportion is shown
in Table 1. None of the predictors studied had a significant effect on
remission. The meta-regression analyses showed that the propor-
tion of patients in recovery was moderated by male sex (ß = 0.006;
95%CI [0.0003,0.0117], p = 0.04, R2 = 10.71) and by positive
symptoms (ß = 0.0126; 95%CI [0.0041,0.0207], p = 0.002,
R2 = 57.22; Table 2). These associations did not survive multiple
comparison corrections (p < 0.002).

Remission
We found 76 studies reporting on remission (RCTs k = 15, obser-
vational studies k = 59) (N FEP = 18528, Supplementary Table S5).
The total remission proportion was 54% (95%CI [30, 49–58]; I2:
97.86%, z = 21.63; Supplementary Figure S1) with a mean follow-up

Quality assessment
The quality rating of the studies ranged from 2 to 7 (mean = 4.95;
median = 5) on a modified version of the Newcastle–Ottawa scale
(Supplementary Table S3).

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest systematic review of studies of
remission and recovery in psychosis conducted to date. We found
that more than half of the patients (54%) achieved remission 4 years
after the first-episode, while around a third were in recovery after
5.5 years (32%). The most studied predictors of remission and
recovery were clinical and sociodemographic variables.

Our results are consistent with those of a previous meta-analysis
[16], although the proportion of remission and recovery is nomin-
ally lower (54 vs. 58% for remission and 32 vs. 38% for recovery).
Another systematic review in FEP showed “good” outcomes for
42% of patients with psychosis and 31% of patients with

schizophrenia [20], while a more recent systematic review of remis-
sion identified a remission proportion of 40% (range 17–78%) in
FEP patients [19].

The current study has several advantages compared to previous
reviews: the inclusion of RCT studies, inclusion of only prospective
designs, and all studies reporting measures of recovery were clas-
sified. Additionally, we included more studies using the RSWG
remission criteria (N = 43 compared to N = 25) [16].

Without antipsychotic treatments, most FEP cases display fre-
quent poor outcomes [4,31]. However, with antipsychotic treatment,
one study showed that remission was achieved by 70% of FEP patients
after 6 months [13], while another study showed that 74% were in
remission after approximately 9 months [32]. This meta-analysis

highlights that the remission proportion could be lower than previ-
ously reported.

As we expected, the remission proportion decreased over time
(56–50%, Figure 2), as relapse after a FEP is common [33], while the
recovery proportion increased (26–35%). This could partially be
explained by the fact that recovery involved other social and
functioning goals, which require more time to be achieved
[34]. Although a high proportion of patients can achieve remission
in the short-term [16], only a minority of them get the full recovery
in the long-term [35].

The most recent systematic review and meta-analysis of recov-
ery showed a pooled proportion of 38% in FEP patients [16], and an
earlier systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that only
13.5% of patients with schizophrenia met the criteria for recovery
[17]. While the most recent systematic review and meta-analysis
completed the literature search in 2016, yielding 3021 studies [16],
the current study provides a more comprehensive, up to date
overview of the literature on remission and recovery (current search
yielded 7267 studies).

After excluding RCTs from the analyses, we showed that the
remission and recovery proportion rates remained the same. This
is surprising given the sample biases generally attributed to RCTs
[36] (e.g., RCTs usually include adherent participants with no
drug abuse or suicidal ideation). Observational studies could be
overrepresented in the meta-analysis. Besides, the cohort studies
also used active treatments,
including early intervention pro-
grams [37–39].

While we did not find any predictors associated with remission,
two were associated with recovery, namely male sex and positive
symptoms. Previous studies did not find gender differences in the
prognosis of psychosis after a FEP [40,41]. The association between
higher scores of positive symptoms and increased recovery propor-
tion may be related to the intrinsic heterogeneity of FEP cohorts.
However, it is important to note that both the association with male
sex and positive symptoms did not survive multiple comparison
corrections and need to be investigated in future studies to draw
meaningful clinical conclusions. Different negative psychotic
symptoms trajectories in FEP patients have been described
[42]. Negative psychotic symptoms are generally linked to worse
outcomes in FEP [43]. However, only a small proportion of FEP
subjects present a high level of persistent negative symptoms [44];

therefore, this effect could be underestimated in large samples
of FEP.

Although there is extensive literature [45–48] reporting that
DUP is related to a worse prognosis in patients with psychosis,
we did not find such an association. Several studies suggest that the
relationship between DUP and prognosis is based on other factors
[49,50], such as positive symptoms. In line with our findings, a
recent systematic review investigating remission/recovery propor-
tion also did not find a relationship between DUP and better
outcomes in psychosis [16], which could also be related to some
inaccuracy in defining or measuring DUP. However, a recent
umbrella review described suggestive evidence for a relationship
between longer DUP and lower chance of remission and poorer
functioning [51], but this result could be affected by lead-time bias,
and thus, DUP would not be an important predictor of the out-
comes and it could be more an indicator of illness stage [52].

The proportion of recovery in FEP is dramatically low. As an
extended concept of remission, recovery has attracted interest as a
desirable outcome in psychosis. It usually comprises symptomatic
remission as a basic condition and functional improvements in
vocational perspectives, independent living and social functioning
[34,53]. Thus, recovery is a more complex concept than remission
[30,54]. Unlike symptomatic remission, recovery encompasses
multiple aspects of the patient’s life, including functioning and
making it difficult to settle on a standard definition and develop
reliable assessment criteria. Some clinicians think recovery can only
be achieved when symptoms are mild or absent and remain that
way for a prolonged time to not interfere with normal functioning
in social activities and relationships [55]. Additionally, social and
family circumstances, opportunities, and lifetime events contribute
to extending the list of environmental factors that may influence
recovery beyond clinical manifestations of
schizophrenia
[56,57]. The lack of a clear definition and assessment tools prevents
from drawing strong conclusions regarding the feasibility of a
therapeutic model based on the concept of recovery. However,
empirical evidence on various therapeutic interventions suggests
that many patients with schizophrenia can achieve recovery goals
such as independent living and competitive employment and edu-
cation in routine community settings [58]. Symptomatic recovery
and functional recovery are different aspects that should be clearly
differentiated to facilitate comparison between studies. Symptom

and functional
illness trajectories are independent, with some
studies reporting lower functional recovery rates than symptomatic
recovery rates [59]. This might suggest that these outcomes are
likely to be influenced by different predictor variables and thus
needing to be treated by different interventions. Researchers have
combined commonly used scales such as the Global Assessment
Functioning (GAF) scale and other objective indicators of lifetime
achievements [60,61]. Despite the lack of a well-defined concept of
recovery, some authors identified a trend toward a common arche-
type of the definition and factors associated with recovery and its
applicability in clinical practice and clinical research [62].

In most cases, symptomatic remission is a prerequisite for recov-
ery [63–66], so it might not be surprising that the recovery propor-
tion is lower than those for remission [10]. Although the RSWG
criteria to operationalize remission are widely used [9, 67–70], some
studies used criteria for symptoms severity without applying a
duration criterion [71], while other studies have used other outcome
measures (e.g., CGI-S) [72].

remission

This study includes a large sample of FEP and analyzed the
proportion of remission and recovery. The main limitation of
this study is the lack of operationalized definitions for recovery.
Remission was operationalized in 2005 [10], and the majority of
included studies used the RSWG criteria. However, there are
other
criteria
[63,73,74]. The definition of recovery is even more complicated.
Some of the studies we examined used definitions that included
functional remission [64,65] while others used much more
exigent definitions, including having work and a relationship
with a peer [14]. Some authors did not report the proportion of
drop-out, the treatment used, premorbid adjustment, age of
psychosis onset, or comorbidity in their samples which limited
our set of different predictors being analyzed. In most studies,
there was no information on the proportion of patients who met
the remission or recovery criteria during the whole follow-up,
limiting the final remission/recovery proportion. Moreover,
psychosis is a long-term chronic disorder with negative out-
comes frequently evolving over the whole lifetime [17]. A minor
proportion of studies included a follow-up after 10 years which
could impact remission/recovery rates and overestimate these
rates for a subgroup of patients. Therefore, we conducted sub-
group and meta-regression analyses to explore potential sources
of heterogeneity. We showed that the main findings largely
remained the same.

Conclusions

This is the most up to date meta-analysis of remission and recovery
proportion, and predictors of both outcomes in people with FEP.
We showed that around half of patients with FEP reached symp-
tomatic remission after 4 years, and about a third were in recovery
after 5.5 years. Remission and recovery rates in FEP subjects remain
low, indicating that more than half of patients do not achieve
remission, and two-thirds do not achieve recovery at long-term
follow-up. The early intervention services should implement strat-
egies to improve long-term outcomes and detect patients who can
benefit more from intensive care.
