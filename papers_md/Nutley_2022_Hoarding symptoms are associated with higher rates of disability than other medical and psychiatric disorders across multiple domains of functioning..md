Abstract 
Background:  Hoarding symptoms are associated with functional impairment, though investigation of disability 
among individuals with hoarding disorder has largely focused on clutter-related impairment to home management 
activities and difficulties using space because of clutter. This analysis assesses disability among individuals with hoard-
ing symptoms in multiple domains of everyday functioning, including cognition, mobility, self-care, interpersonal and 
community-level interactions, and home management. The magnitude of the association between hoarding and dis-
ability was compared to that of medical and psychiatric disorders with documented high disability burden, including 
major depressive disorder (MDD), diabetes, and chronic pain.

Methods:  Data were cross-sectionally collected from 16,312 adult participants enrolled in an internet-based research 
registry, the Brain Health Registry. Pearson’s chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression models were used to 
quantify the relationship between hoarding and functional ability relative to MDD, diabetes, and chronic pain.

Results:  More than one in ten participants endorsed clinical (5.7%) or subclinical (5.7%) hoarding symptoms (CHS 
and SCHS, respectively). After adjusting for participant demographic characteristics and psychiatric and medi-
cal comorbidity, CHS and SCHS were associated with increased odds of impairment in all domains of functioning. 
Moderate to extreme impairment was endorsed more frequently by those with CHS or SCHS compared to those with 
self-reported MDD, diabetes, and/or chronic pain in nearly all domains (e.g., difficulty with day-to-day work or school: 
CHS: 18.7% vs. MDD: 11.8%, p < 0.0001) except mobility and self-care. While those with current depressive symptoms 
endorsed higher rates of impairment than those with hoarding symptoms, disability was most prevalent among 
those endorsing both hoarding and comorbid depressive symptoms.

Conclusions:  Hoarding symptoms are associated with profound disability in all domains of functioning. The bur-
den of hoarding is comparable to that of other medical and psychiatric illnesses with known high rates of functional 
impairment. Future studies should examine the directionality and underlying causality of the observed associations, 
and possibly identify target interventions to minimize impairment associated with hoarding symptomatology.

Background
Disability has been broadly defined as impairment to one 
or  more  areas  of  functioning,  including  alterations  in 
body  structure  or  problems  in  body  function,  difficulty 
executing  activities  of  daily  living,  and  problems  with 
involvement in everyday life [1]. A substantial proportion 
of individuals with medical and psychiatric health condi-
tions  experience  disability,  including  those  with  cardio-
vascular disease, diabetes, chronic pain, major depressive 
disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) 
[2–4]. For psychiatric conditions in particular, the nega-
tive functional impact of psychiatric symptoms is a nec-
essary  criterion  for  diagnosis.  However,  the  relative 
impact  of  health  conditions  on  disability  varies  widely 
and  thus  the  identification  of  diseases  associated  with 
substantial  functional  impairment  is  crucial  for  clarify-
ing  objectives  in  national  health  policy,  and  for  patient 
assessment and management [3, 5].

Hoarding  disorder  (HD)  is  a  neuropsychiatric  condi-
tion characterized by persistent difficulty discarding due 
to  distress  or  indecision  about  what  to  discard.  Though 
HD affects up to 6% of U.S. older adults and is associated 
with  substantial  reductions  in  overall  health  and  quality 
of  life  [6–8],  exploration  of  disability  among  those  with 
HD  is  somewhat  limited.  As  HD  was  previously  con-
ceptualized  as  a  subtype  of  obsessive–compulsive  disor-
der (OCD), studies  investigating the  impact  of hoarding 
on  functional  ability  have  largely  focused  on  hoarding 
behavior  that  occurs  in  the  context  of  OCD  and  other 
anxiety  disorders.  In  this  population,  hoarding  symp-
toms  have  been  associated  with  compromised  function-
ing  in  social,  familial,  and  occupational  settings  [9–20]. 
Even  when  adjusting  for  the  effects  of  comorbid  mood 
and  anxiety  disorders,  as  well  as  co-occurring  OCD 
symptoms,  increased  hoarding  symptom  severity  has 
been associated with limited activity involvement, finan-
cial  dissatisfaction,  and  poor  social  adjustment  [11,  17]. 
While  some  researchers  have  suggested  that  the  impact 
of hoarding symptoms on disability may actually exceed 
that  of  co-occurring  affective  and  obsessive–compulsive 
disorders [9], others have observed no difference in func-
tioning between OCD patients with and without hoard-
ing symptoms [16, 19].

Though  hoarding  symptoms  may  occur  in  the  con-
text  of  OCD,  it  is  estimated  that  fewer  than  20%  of 
individuals  with  HD  meet  diagnostic  criteria  for  OCD 
[8].  Despite  evidence  suggesting  a  clinical  and  etiologic 
distinction  between  HD  and  the  hoarding  symptoms 

in  OCD  [20,  21],  only  a  small  number  of  studies  have 
expanded investigation of functional disability in hoard-
ing to non-OCD populations. Studies assessing disability 
among individuals with HD commonly report increased 
difficulty  with  home  management  activities,  including 
greater difficulty using space because of clutter [22–26]. 
However,  impairment  among  those  with  HD  has  also 
been extended to social, occupational, and personal care 
settings  [20,  23,  24,  27,  28].  As  in  the  studies  of  OCD, 
some  investigators  have  reported  that  the  degree  of 
impairment  observed  among  individuals  with  HD  may 
exceed  that  of  individuals  with  other  psychiatric  condi-
tions  [27].  However,  others  have  reported  no  difference 
in  disability  between  these  populations  [20].  Despite 
some  evidence  linking  hoarding  to  disability,  investiga-
tion has been largely limited to small samples that often 
lack control populations and explore disability in a lim-
ited  number  of  functional  domains  (i.e.,  home  manage-
ment,  social,  occupational,  etc.).  The  full  extent  of  the 
relationship  between  hoarding  and  functional  ability  is 
not  clear,  and  the  association  between  hoarding  symp-
toms and disability relative to that of other medical and 
psychiatric conditions has not been fully described.

The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  explore  global  and 
hoarding-specific  disability  in  a  large  sample  of  indi-
viduals  with  clinically  relevant  and  subclinical  hoarding 
symptoms  using  information  collected  from  U.S.  adults 
enrolled in an online research platform, the Brain Health 
Registry [29]. To assess the relative magnitude of the rela-
tionship  between  hoarding  and  disability,  self-reported 
impairment  among  those  with  hoarding  symptoms  was 
compared  to  that  of  individuals  with  other  debilitat-
ing  medical  and  psychiatric  conditions,  including  major 
depressive  disorder,  diabetes,  and  chronic  pain.  It  was 
hypothesized  that  individuals  with  hoarding  symptoms 
would endorse impairment in all domains of functioning, 
including interpersonal and community-level interaction 
(social), cognition, mobility, self-care, and home manage-
ment. It was further hypothesized that the magnitude of 
the relationship between hoarding symptoms and disabil-
ity would be greater than or equal to that of other health 
conditions associated with high disease burden.

Methods
The  Brain  Health  Registry  (BHR)  is  an  online  research 
registry  developed  to  advance  research  of  brain  aging 
and  neuropsychiatric  health.  The  platform  is  comprised 
of  more  than  70,000  U.S.  adult  participants  who  are 

Nutley et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:647

semi-annually invited to complete neurocognitive assess-
ments and self-report questionnaires evaluating medical 
and  psychiatric  health  and  health  behaviors,  including 
assessments  of  hoarding  symptoms  and  functional  abil-
ity  [29].  BHR  participants  are  recruited  from  all  50  U.S. 
states  using  a  variety  of  recruitment  sources,  including 
owned (e.g., BHR website and press-releases), paid (e.g., 
online advertising, direct mail), and earned (e.g., word of 
mouth,  publicity)  media.  The  sole  inclusion  criteria  for 
participation is age ≥ 18 years. Electric informed consent 
is  obtained  from  all  participants  prior  to  enrollment  in 
the research registry. Compared to the U.S general pop-
ulation,  BHR  participants  are  more  likely  to  be  female, 
White, of older age, and of higher educational attainment 
[7].

As of August 2020, a total of 16,312 BHR participants 
simultaneously  completed  assessments  of  hoarding 
symptoms,  health  history,  and  functional  impairment, 
and  were  included  in  this  secondary  analysis.  Though 
the  BHR  is  longitudinal  in  nature  and  some  partici-
pants  completed  all  relevant  assessments  at  multiple 
time  points,  this  analysis  uses  data  collected  at  partici-
pants’  most  recent  time  point  with  complete  data.  All 
data  points  included  in  the  final  analysis  were  collected 
between January 2019 and August 2020.

Demographic characteristics

Participants  were  asked  to  report  their  age  (18–90; 
recoded  as  (1)  less  than  60  years  and  (2)  60  years  or 
older),  gender  (male/female  [only  2  gender  identity 
options were available as options in the BHR at the time 
of  data  collection]),  race  (African  American;  Asian; 
White; other [includes Native American, Pacific Islander, 
other, and individuals who identified with more than one 
race; collapsed into a single category due to low endorse-
ment]), ethnicity (Latinx/Hispanic; Not Latinx/Hispanic; 
Prefer not to say), and educational attainment (grammar 
school; high school; some college; two-year degree; four-
year  degree;  master’s  degree;  doctoral  degree;  profes-
sional degree; recoded as (1) less than college degree, (2) 
2-  or  4-year  college  degree,  and  (3)  graduate  or  profes-
sional degree). Self-reported height and weight were used 
to  calculate  body  mass  index  (BMI).  Participants  were 
provided a list of height and weight ranges (e.g., 140–149 
pounds)  from  which  conservative  BMI  estimates  were 
calculated (i.e., when exact BMI group was unclear based 
on reported height and weight, individuals were classified 
using the BMI category closest to “Normal Weight”; see 
Nutley et al. [7] for details).

Hoarding

Current  hoarding  symptoms  were  assessed  using 
an  online  adaptation  of  the  Hoarding  Rating  Scale, 

Self-Report  (HRS-SR),  a  5-item  assessment  for  the  core 
features  of  hoarding  disorder:  clutter,  difficulty  discard-
ing,  excessive  acquisition,  and  hoarding-related  distress 
and impairment [30]. Individual items ask participants to 
rate  the  severity  of  hoarding  symptoms  using  a  9-point 
Likert scale ranging from 0 (none) to 8 (extreme); items 
are summed for a total score ranging from 0 to 40, with 
higher  scores  indicating  greater  hoarding  symptomatol-
ogy.  For  all  items,  participants  are  instructed  to  answer 
with  regard  to  how  symptoms  are  currently  (no  specific 
timeframe specified). Previously validated for the screen-
ing  of  clinical  hoarding  among  BHR  participants  [31], 
cutoffs of 10 and 14 have been used to identify individu-
als with subclinical (SCHS) and clinically relevant hoard-
ing  symptoms  (CHS),  respectively  [6,  7].  Participants 
with  total  scores  less  than  10  were  classified  as  having 
minimal or no hoarding symptoms (No HS).

Functional impairment

The  12-item  version  of  the  World  Health  Organization 
Disability Assessment Scale 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) was used 
to  assess  participants’  level  of  functioning  in  six  major 
life  domains  including  cognition  (i.e.,  ability  to  concen-
trate  and  learn),  mobility  (i.e.,  ability  to  move  around), 
self-care (i.e., ability to manage personal hygiene), getting 
along  (i.e.,  ability  to  interact  with  others),  life  activities 
(i.e.,  ability  to  carry  out  responsibilities  at  home,  work, 
and  school),  and  participation  in  society  (i.e.,  ability  to 
engage  in  community)  [32].  For  each  item  participants 
are asked to rate the level of difficulty they have experi-
enced  while  performing  12  activities  of  daily  living  over 
the past 30 days using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 
1 (no difficulty/none) to 5 (extreme difficulty/cannot do). 
For  each  item,  a  binary  variable  was  created  to  identify 
individuals  experiencing  moderate  to  extreme  difficulty 
with  the  respective  task  (i.e.,  scores  were  dichotomized 
for comparing individuals with scores between 3 and 5 to 
those with scores of 1 or 2).

A modified version of the Activities of Daily Living in 
Hoarding  scale  (ADL-H)  was  used  to  assess  hoarding-
related impairment in daily functioning [33]. Participants 
were asked to rate the level of difficulty they experience 
in performing seven daily living activities due to a hoard-
ing or clutter problem. Individual items were rated from 
1  (can  do  easily)  to  5  (unable  to  do),  with  higher  scores 
indicating  greater  hoarding-related  impairment  to  daily 
functioning.  Participants  were  further  asked  about  the 
presence  and  severity  of  hoarding-related  safety  con-
cerns,  including  queries  related  to  fire  hazards,  blocked 
exits, and clutter outside the home. Individual items were 
rated  from  1  (no  problem)  to  5  (severe  problem),  with 
higher  scores  indicating  more  severe  safety  concerns. 
For  all  items,  a  binary  variable  was  created  to  identify 

 Nutley et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:647 

Page 4 of 13

individuals  experiencing  moderate  or  greater  difficulty 
(or  severity)  with  the  respective  task  or  safety  concern 
(i.e., scores were dichotomized for comparing individuals 
with scores between 3 and 5 to those with scores of 1 or 
2). In the case where individual items do not apply, a “not 
applicable”  (NA)  response  was  offered  to  participants; 
NA  items  were  not  considered  in  the  development  of 
binary indicators of impairment (i.e., marked as missing).

Medical and psychiatric health

The  association  between  hoarding  symptoms  and  dis-
ability  was  compared  to  that  of  quantitatively  assessed 
depressive  symptoms  and  self-reported  lifetime  diag-
noses  of  major  depressive  disorder  (MDD),  diabetes, 
and  chronic  pain  –  conditions  that  are  recognized  as 
leading  causes  of  disability-adjusted  life-years  in  the 
United  States  by  the  Global  Burden  of  Disease  (GBD) 
study  (GBD  equivalent  and  2019  rank:  MDD  [GBD: 
Depressive  Disorders,  Rank:  9],  diabetes  [GBD:  Diabe-
tes, Rank: 5], chronic pain [GBD: Low Back Pain, Rank 
3]). Current depressive symptom severity was assessed 
using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)
[34]. For all items, participants were asked to report the 
frequency  of  depressive  symptoms  over  the  past  two 
weeks using a 4-point Likert scale. Items were summed 
for a total score ranging from 0 to 27. Participants with 
total  scores  greater  than  10  (i.e.,  moderate  to  severe 
depressive symptoms) were classified as having current 
depressive  symptoms  and  those  with  scores  of  10  or 
less were classified as having no or minimal depression 
[35]. As previously examined by Vieira Sordo et al. [36], 
self-reported  lifetime  diagnoses  of  MDD  and  diabetes 
were  ascertained  by  asking  participants  if  they  have 
ever  had  or  currently  have  the  conditions  of  interest 
(yes/no)  [36].  Participants  were  further  queried  about 
chronic  pain  using  the  following  question:  “Is  chronic 
pain  a  problem  for  you?”  (yes/no).  Four  separate  cat-
egorical  variables  were  used  to  describe  comorbidity 
between  hoarding  symptoms,  depressive  symptoms, 
MDD, diabetes, and chronic pain. For all four variables, 
individuals  were  classified  into  one  of  four  groups:  (1) 
comorbid  hoarding  symptoms  (CHS  or  SCHS)  and 
the  medical  or  psychiatric  condition  of  interest  (i.e., 
depression,  diabetes,  or  chronic  pain),  (2)  hoarding 
symptoms  only  (i.e.,  CHS  or  SCHS  but  no  medical  or 
psychiatric condition of interest), (3) medical or psychi-
atric  condition  of  interest  only  (i.e.,  depression,  diabe-
tes, or chronic pain and no HS), or (4) neither hoarding 
symptoms  nor  the  medical  or  psychiatric  condition  of 
interest  (i.e.,  depression,  diabetes,  or  chronic  pain). 
For  example,  individuals  were  categorized  into  one  of 
four  groups  when  classifying  the  comorbidity  between 

hoarding  symptoms  and  MDD:  (1)  comorbid  hoarding 
symptoms (CHS/SCHS) and MDD, (2) hoarding symp-
toms only, (3) MDD only, or (4) neither HS nor MDD.

To  assess  the  association  between  hoarding  and  dis-
ability  independent  of  co-occurring  psychiatric  and 
medical  health  conditions,  variables  quantifying  psy-
chiatric and medical disease burden were calculated by 
summing  the  number  of  comorbid  health  conditions 
endorsed  by  participants  in  each  domain  (i.e.,  psychi-
atric and medical). For psychiatric disease burden, par-
ticipants were asked to report lifetime history of MDD, 
generalized  anxiety  disorder,  specific  or  social  phobia, 
panic  disorder,  posttraumatic  stress  disorder,  OCD, 
eating  disorder,  drug  or  alcohol  abuse,  attention-defi-
cit/hyperactivity  disorder,  autism,  Tourette  syndrome 
or  Tourette  disorder,  chronic  motor  or  vocal  tic  dis-
order,  bipolar  disorder,  schizophrenia,  and  psychosis. 
For  medical  disease  burden,  participants  were  asked 
to  report  lifetime  history  of  high  blood  pressure,  high 
cholesterol,  diabetes,  heart  disease,  stroke,  asthma, 
lung disease, arthritis, allergies, traumatic brain injury, 
concussion, sleep apnea, and chronic pain.

Statistical analysis

The  demographic  and  health  characteristics  of  study 
participants  with  CHS,  SCHS,  and  no  HS  were  com-
pared  using  Pearson’s  chi-square  tests  and  Kruskal–
Wallis  H  tests.  Pearson’s  chi-square  tests  were  then 
used  to  compare  (1)  the  proportion  of  individuals 
with  CHS,  SCHS,  and  no  HS  who  endorsed  moderate 
to  extreme  impairment  on  each  single  item  measure 
of  global  (WHODAS)  or  hoarding-related  (ADL-H) 
disability,  as  well  as  (2)  the  proportion  of  individu-
als  with  hoarding  symptoms  and/or  depressive  symp-
toms,  MDD,  or  chronic  pain  who  endorsed  moderate 
to  extreme  impairment  on  each  measure  of  disability. 
For measures of global disability (i.e., WHODAS), sepa-
rate,  adjusted  logistic  regression  models  were  used  to 
quantify  the  association  between  hoarding  symptoms 
and  moderate  to  extreme  functional  impairment  (i.e., 
12 separate models predicting each single item measure 
of disability in the WHODAS). Models were adjusted to 
control for the effects of participant demographic (i.e., 
age,  gender,  race,  and  education)  and  health-related 
(i.e.,  BMI,  co-occurring  psychiatric  burden,  and  co-
occurring medical burden) characteristics. Of note, the 
Results  section  has  been  structured  by  type  of  disabil-
ity  assessment  rather  than  type  of  statistical  test  (i.e., 
we first present results from all statistical tests/models 
assessing  the  relationship  between  hoarding  and  disa-
bility assessed via the WHODAS, and then results from 
tests corresponding to the ADL-H).

Results
Approximately  one-tenth  of  the  study  sample  endorsed 
clinically relevant hoarding symptoms (11.4%). Of 16,312 
BHR  participants  included  in  this  analysis,  923  (5.7%) 
endorsed  clinical  hoarding  behavior  (i.e.,  HRS-SR  total 
score > 14),  937  (5.7%)  endorsed  subclinical  hoarding 
behavior  (i.e.,  HRS-SR  total  score  between  10  and  14), 
and  14,452  (88.6%)  did  not  endorse  hoarding  symptoms 
(i.e.,  HRS-SR  total  score  less  than  10).  A  demographic 
overview  of  the  sample  is  outlined  in  Table  1.  On  aver-
age, individuals with CHS and SCHS were younger than 
those  without  HS  (Median  age  [IQR]:  CHS:  63  [54,  70], 
SCHS: 63 [56, 70], No HS: 65 [57, 72], p < 0.001), slightly 
less likely to be White (CHS: 87.5%, SCHS: 86.5%, No HS: 

91.4%, p < 0.001), and slightly less likely to have received 
college  or  graduate-level  education  (CHS:  78.3%,  SCHS: 
80.9%,  No  HS:  84.0%,  p < 0.001).  Additionally,  those 
with CHS were more likely than those without HS to be 
female (78.3% vs. 73.3%, p < 0.001), though no difference 
in the distribution of gender was observed when compar-
ing individuals with SCHS and those without HS. A small 
effect size was observed for all between-group differences 
in demographic characteristics.

In terms of health history, those with CHS were more 
than  twice  as  likely  to  report  obesity  than  those  with-
out hoarding symptoms (39.1% vs. 18.8%, p < 0.001), and 
the  psychiatric  and  medical  disease  burdens  reported 
by those with hoarding were nearly double that of those

Functional disability

Moderate to extreme impairment was reported by more 
than  one  in  three  individuals  with  CHS  for  the  major-
ity  of  single  item  measures  on  the  WHODAS,  includ-
ing  measures  of  cognitive  functioning,  mobility,  and 
life  activities  (Table  2).  After  adjusting  for  demographic 

characteristics  and  psychiatric/medical  disease  burden, 
CHS  increased  the  odds  of  impairment  in  all  domains. 
Notably, CHS was associated with a 6- to 12-fold increase 
in  the  odds  of  impairment  in  life  activities/home  man-
agement,  as  well  as  a  4-  to  sixfold  increase  in  the  odds 
of impairment in cognitive and social (i.e., interpersonal 
interaction,  participation  in  society)  functioning  (Fig.  1; 
Table  3).  Similarly,  SCHS  was  associated  with  increased 
odds  of  impairment  in  social,  physical  (i.e.,  mobility), 
and  cognitive  domains  relative  to  those  without  hoard-
ing behavior (Fig. 3). However, impairment was less fre-
quently  reported  by  those  with  subclinical  symptoms 
relative to those with CHS (Table 2); in adjusted regres-
sion  models  limited  to  participants  with  SCHS  or  CHS,

individuals with CHS were between 1.5 and 3 times more 
likely  than  those  with  SCHS  to  endorse  disability  in  all 
domains  except  self-care  (Supplemental  Table  1).  Sensi-
tivity  analyses  assessed  whether  functional  impairment 
differed  between  individuals  with  and  without  hoarding 
symptoms  when  WHODAS  items  were  measured  using 
a full, 5-point Likert scale. For all measures of functional 
disability,  individuals  with  CHS  endorsed  the  highest 
levels of impairment, followed by those with SCHS, and 
those  with  no  HS  (data  not  shown).  Bivariate  Pearson 
correlation coefficients indicated that no single HRS item 
was uniquely associated with WHODAS summary scores 
(i.e.,  sum  of  all  WHODAS  items),  rather  that  all  HRS 
items  were  moderately  correlated  with  disability,  with 
correlation coefficients ranging from 0.35 to 0.44.

WHODAS: comparison to MDD, chronic pain, and diabetes

The  prevalence  of  moderate  to  extreme  impairment 
in  all  single-item  WHODAS  measures  for  individu-
als  with  CHS,  depressed  mood,  self-reported  MDD, 
chronic pain, and diabetes are displayed in Fig. 2. When 
using  self-report  measures  to  assess  lifetime  history  of 

MDD,  chronic  pain,  and  diabetes,  individuals  with  CHS 
reported  greater  impairment  in  nearly  all  WHODAS 
domains  (i.e.,  except  mobility  and  self-care)  than  indi-
viduals with MDD only, those with chronic pain only, and 
those  with  diabetes  only  (Supplemental  Table  2).  How-
ever, the size of the association between CHS and disabil-
ity  was  greatest  when  hoarding  symptoms  co-occurred 
with  MDD,  chronic  pain,  or  diabetes.  For  all  three  con-
ditions, all disease groups (i.e., CHS only, MDD/chronic 
pain  only,  CHS + MDD/chronic  pain)  reported  signifi-
cantly  greater  impairment  than  those  with  neither  CHS 
nor  MDD,  chronic  pain,  or  diabetes.  A  slightly  differ-
ent  pattern  was  observed  when  using  the  PHQ-9  to 
assess  current  depressive  symptoms.  In  all  WHODAS 
domains, individuals with both CHS and current depres-
sive  symptoms  most  frequently  reported  moderate  to 
extreme  impairment,  though  individuals  with  depressed 
mood  alone  reported  slightly  greater  impairment  than 
those  with  CHS  alone  (Supplemental  Table  2).  How-
ever,  in  some  domains,  this  difference  between  indi-
viduals  with  either  CHS  or  depressive  symptoms  was 
marginal  (e.g.,  life  activities,  getting  along  with  others).

Activities of daily living for hoarding disorder

As  expected,  very  few  individuals  without  HS  reported 
impairment in activities of daily living (ADL) as a result 
of  a  clutter  or  hoarding  problem.  However,  individuals 
with  CHS  frequently  reported  moderate  to  extreme  dif-
ficulty in multiple domains, including being able to sit in 
a  chair  or  sofa  (11.5%  vs.  0.2%,  p < 0.0001),  use  kitchen 
counters (26.1% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.0001), eat at a table (37.6% 
vs.  1.5%,  p < 0.0001),  and  find  important  things  due  to 
clutter  or  high  volume  of  items  in  the  home  (59.6  vs. 
3.4%, p < 0.0001; Table 2). Safety concerns were also com-
mon  among  those  with  CHS;  approximately  one-fifth 
of  individuals  with  CHS  reported  concerns  regarding 
emergency  medical  personnel’s  ability  to  move  equip-
ment  through  their  home  (CHS:21.7%  vs.  No  HS:0.4%, 
p < 0.0001), as well as concerns regarding excessive clutter 
outside  their  home,  such  as  on  a  porch  (18.7%  vs.  0.9%, 
p < 0.0001).  Additionally,  nearly  one  in  ten  individuals 
with CHS reported an ongoing fire hazard in their home, 
though almost no participants without HS endorsed the 
same  concern  (10.1%  vs.  0.2%,  p < 0.0001).  For  all  single 

item  measures,  the  prevalence  of  safety  concerns  and 
impairment  in  common  activities  of  daily  living  among 
those  with  SCHS  were  intermediate  to  those  with  and 
without  clinically  relevant  hoarding  symptoms  (Table  2 
[pairwise Pearson’s chi-square tests]). Findings remained 
when  examining  variability  between  hoarding  groups 
when ADL-H items were measured using a 5-point Lik-
ert  scale;  for  all  single-item  measures,  individuals  with 
CHS endorsed the highest levels of impairment, followed 
by  those  with  SCHS,  and  those  with  no  HS  (data  not 
shown).

ADL-H: comparison to MDD, chronic pain, and diabetes

Despite  the  fact  that  clutter  can  also  accumulate  in 
the  homes  of  individuals  with  active  depression  (e.g., 
due  to  amotivation),  participants  with  current  depres-
sive  symptoms  (PHQ-9  scores > 10)  but  not  CHS  in  this 
study  rarely  reported  safety  concerns  or  impairment 
to ADL due to a hoarding or clutter problem. The most 
frequently  reported  domain  of  ADL  impairment  among 
individuals with depressive symptoms only was difficulty 
finding  important  things  (10.3%).  However,  those  with 
CHS were almost four times as likely to report the same 
concern  (39.4%,  p < 0.001;  Fig.  3;  Supplemental  Table  4). 
This effect was even stronger when assessing self-report 
diagnoses  of  MDD;  those  with  CHS  were  over  6  times 
more  likely  than  those  with  self-reported  lifetime  his-
tory  of  MDD  to  endorse  difficulty  finding  important 
things as a result of a hoarding or clutter problem (38.9% 
vs. 6.2%, p < 0.0001). Regardless of how depressed mood 
was assessed, all ADL-H single item measures of disabil-
ity and safety concerns were most frequently reported by 
those  with  both  CHS  and  MDD/depressive  symptoms, 
followed by those with CHS only, MDD only, and neither 
condition. The same pattern was observed when compar-
ing individuals with CHS to those with chronic pain and 
those with diabetes (Fig. 3).

Discussion
Although hoarding symptoms have previously been asso-
ciated  with  functional  impairment,  to  date  much  of  the 
literature assessing disability among individuals with HD 
has focused on impairment to home management activi-
ties  and  difficulties  using  active  living  space  because  of 
clutter  [22–26].  While  our  findings  confirm  that  a  sub-
stantial  number  of  individuals  with  hoarding  symptoms 
do  experience  difficulty  in  completing  home  tasks,  our 
data  indicate  that  impairment  in  other  areas  of  func-
tioning  is  also  highly  prevalent  in  those  with  hoarding 
symptoms. Perhaps most alarmingly, we observed a 2- to 
threefold increased odds of impairment in the domains of 
mobility and self-care among those with clinically signifi-
cant  hoarding  symptoms  or  CHS,  even  after  controlling

for multiple possible confounders, as well as a 4 to sixfold 
increased  odds  of  self-reported  impaired  cognitive  and 
social  functioning.  We  also  observed  high  rates  of  dis-
ability among those with subclinical hoarding symptoms, 
though  the  size  of  the  effect  was  slightly  smaller  than 
what  we  observed  among  those  with  CHS.  Importantly, 
the observed associations occurred independently of co-
occurring medical and psychiatric health burden, indicat-
ing that the relationship between disability and hoarding 
is not simply an attribute of high comorbidity rates.

As the relative impact of health conditions on disabil-
ity varies widely, this analysis also uniquely assessed the 
magnitude  of  the  association  between  hoarding  symp-
toms  and  multidimensional  functional  impairment  rela-
tive  to  medical  and  psychiatric  conditions  commonly 
associated  with  high  disease  burden:  MDD,  chronic 
pain,  and  diabetes.  Our  findings  indicate  that  in  nearly 
all  domains  of  functioning,  individuals  with  subclinical 
or  clinical  hoarding  endorsed  rates  of  impairment  that 
were  greater  than  or  equal  to  that  of  individuals  with 
self-reported  depression,  chronic  pain,  and/or  diabetes, 
which are all ranked as among the top ten causes of disa-
bility in the U.S. by the WHO [37]. While rates of impair-
ment among those with hoarding symptoms were slightly 
lower than what was observed among those with depres-
sive  symptoms,  individuals  with  both  hoarding  and 
depressive symptoms were nearly twice as likely to report 
impairment  in  nearly  all  domains  of  functioning  when 
compared  to  those  with  depression  alone.  As  an  esti-
mated 50% of individuals with HD have comorbid MDD 
[8], the additive effect of hoarding and depressive symp-
toms on disability is of high concern. In this population, 
it is likely that concomitant treatment of HD and depres-
sive symptoms is needed to improve overall functioning. 
However, HD remains vastly underdiagnosed and under-
treated  [38].  Assessment  of  hoarding  symptoms  among 
individuals with MDD who report substantial functional 
impairment  may  improve  the  identification  of  individu-
als with hoarding symptoms who may benefit from dual 
treatment programs.

Our  findings  further  indicate  that  a  substantial  num-
ber  of  individuals  with  hoarding  symptoms  are  at  risk 
of  house  fires,  falls,  and  other  safety  concerns  due  to 
hoarding  behavior  or  clutter.  Approximately  one  in  ten 
individuals  with  CHS  endorsed  an  ongoing  fire-hazard 
in  their  home,  and  one  in  five  endorsed  concerns  about 
emergency  service  personnel’s  ability  to  access  their 
home. Notably, these concerns were also present among 
individuals with subclinical hoarding. However, the self-
reported  prevalence  of  fire  hazards  in  this  sample  was 
almost threefold lower than the rate observed in previous 
studies  (~ 29%),  and  almost  fivefold  lower  than  the  rate 
observed  among  community-dwelling  cases  identified 

through  community  agencies  (~ 46%;  [39]).  It  is  impor-
tant to note that the previously reported rates were based 
on direct observation, while our data rely on self-report. 
These  discrepancies  could  be  due  to  a  lower  severity  of 
hoarding  and  clutter  in  our  sample,  which  was  unse-
lected  for  HD,  and  thus  may  be  more  representative  of 
the  general  population  of  individuals  with  clinically  sig-
nificant hoarding. However, they could also indicate that 
individuals with CHS may minimize the potential impact 
of  their  hoarding  symptoms.  Unfortunately,  we  do  not 
have  the  ability  within  this  study  to  determine  which  of 
these alternative explanations is more likely to be correct. 
Future studies comparing self-report to external observa-
tion would be needed.

As  expected,  individuals  with  clinical  and  subclini-
cal  hoarding  symptoms  also  endorsed  higher  rates  of 
impairment  due  to  a  hoarding  or  clutter  problem  than 
those  with  no  or  minimal  hoarding  symptoms.  In  part, 
this  finding  provides  some  evidence  of  the  validity  of 
the ADL-H assessment as a measure of hoarding-related 
impairment. However, our results also highlight the clini-
cal  relevance  of  distinguishing  clinical  and  subclinical 
hoarding  symptoms,  as  the  two  groups  displayed  differ-
ential rates of impairment to activities of daily living. Our 
findings indicate that while there are similarities between 
subclinical and clinical hoarding symptoms, there remain 
important distinctions regarding the impact of the disor-
der on overall functioning.

Several  studies  indicate  improved  functional  abil-
ity  among  those  with  hoarding  symptoms  following 
treatment,  though  research  has  primarily  focused  on 
improvement  in  the  domain  of  home  management 
and ability to carry out other home tasks [40–47]. Few 
studies  have  expanded  investigation  to  other  areas  of 
functioning, and data from these studies indicate little 
improvement in functional ability following treatment. 
For  example,  Ayers  and  colleagues  (2011;  [48])  found 
no  evidence  of  improved  functioning  in  social,  home, 
or  familial  settings  among  older  adults  with  hoarding 
following  completion  of  an  individual  CBT  program 
[48].  In  part,  this  may  be  the  result  of  relatively  short 
follow-up  periods  that  do  not  allow  investigators  to 
detect long-term changes in overall functioning. Addi-
tional  investigation  assessing  the  long-term  impact 
of  hoarding  treatment  on  all  domains  of  disability  is 
needed.  As  our  findings  indicate  that  individuals  with 
both  hoarding  symptoms  and  co-occurring  depression 
or chronic pain are most likely to report impairment in 
all domains of functioning, attention to multimorbidity 
is  likely  a  key  component  of  effectively  reducing  disa-
bility among those with hoarding symptoms. Unique or 
combined  intervention  approaches  may  be  needed  for 
these populations.

Though  not  the  primary  focus  of  this  analysis,  our 
findings  also  indicated  that  individuals  in  the  BHR 
sample who endorsed clinical and subclinical hoarding 
symptoms  were  slightly  younger  than  those  without 
hoarding  symptoms.  Though  the  size  of  the  observed 
effect was small, this is a surprising observation given 
that  the  prevalence  of  hoarding  has  been  found  to 
increase  linearly  with  age  [49].  Additional  investi-
gation  is  needed  to  identify  potential  sources  of  the 
observed discrepancy.

To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  large-scale  study 
to  assess  and  compare  disability  in  multiple  domains 
of  functioning  among 
individuals  with  hoarding 
symptoms  and  those  with  MDD  or  chronic  pain, 
which are conditions that are known to be associated 
with  high  disease  burden.  However,  this  investiga-
tion is not without limitations. Importantly, the use of 
cross-sectional data to assess the relationship between 
hoarding  and  disability  precludes  us  from  drawing 
definitive  conclusions  about  the  directionality  of  the 
observed association. This concern is compounded by 
use  of  self-report  assessments  that  evaluate  psychiat-
ric  symptomatology,  health  conditions,  and  disability 
using  varying  time  frames,  some  of  which  allow  for 
broad  interpretation  of  time  across  the  study  sample 
(e.g., the HRS asks participants to answer with regard 
to  how  symptoms  are  currently).  It  is  hypothesized 
that hoarding symptoms lead to increased impairment 
in overall functioning through interaction of multiple 
factors,  including  the  accumulation  of  clutter  within 
the home, increased social isolation, and financial dis-
tress. However, it is also possible that disability exac-
erbates  hoarding  symptoms  and  the  accumulation 
of  clutter.  Additionally,  it  may  be  that  an  unknown 
factor  simultaneously  contributes  to  both  hoarding 
symptoms  and  disability.  Additional  work  is  needed 
to explore the temporality of the association between 
hoarding  and  disability,  as  well  as  the  underlying 
mechanisms  of  the  observed  relationship  and  poten-
tial  confounding  factors.  If  hoarding  symptoms  are 
found to precede functional impairment, it is possible 
that early recognition of hoarding behavior will lessen 
the functional impact of symptoms.

This investigation relies on the use of self-report meas-
ures  to  assess  hoarding  symptomatology  and  disabil-
ity,  introducing  the  possibility  of  self-report  biases  and 
some  misclassification.  Though  previous  investigation 
suggests that the use of the HRS-SR for identifying CHS 
and SCHS is a reasonable proxy for clinically-defined HD 
in  the  BHR  sample,  it  is  possible  that  social  desirability 
biases  or  low  insight  contributed  to  artificially  low  lev-
els  of  hoarding  behavior  for  some  individuals.  It  is  also 

possible  that  some  individuals  with  hoarding  symptoms 
would  be  better  classified  using  a  diagnosis  of  a  related 
disorder, such as OCD.

To  assess  the  magnitude  of  the  association  between 
hoarding  symptoms  and  disability  relative  to  other 
conditions,  the  relationship  between  hoarding  and 
functional  impairment  was  compared  to  that  of  self-
reported  lifetime  diagnoses  of  MDD,  diabetes,  and 
chronic  pain.  Though  this  comparison  allows  for 
a  baseline  understanding  of  the  relative  size  of  the 
observed  association  between  hoarding  and  disability, 
some  individuals  reporting  a  lifetime  history  of  medi-
cal  and  psychiatric  conditions  may  not  be  currently 
affected, and thus the relationship between such condi-
tions  and  disability  is  likely  attenuated  in  our  sample. 
Though we aimed to mitigate this concern by compar-
ing  the  association  between  hoarding  and  disability  to 
that of current depressive symptoms, additional work is 
needed to fully quantify the magnitude of the observed 
effect  relative  to  other  current  medical  and  psychi-
atric  symptoms.  Lastly,  the  BHR  inherently  requires 
that individuals have computer and internet access for 
participation.  As  the  sample  is  primarily  comprised  of 
White females of older age and high educational attain-
ment,  this  investigation  may  not  be  representative  of 
more diverse populations.

Conclusions
Disability  in  hoarding  is  highly  prevalent  and  exten-
sive, affecting all areas of functioning including mobil-
ity,  self-care,  social  and  cognitive  function,  and  home 
management.  Impairment  among  those  with  clinical 
and  subclinical  hoarding  symptoms  is  comparable  to 
that  of  MDD  and  chronic  pain,  conditions  known  to 
be  associated  with  high  disability  burden,  and  is  fur-
ther  exacerbated  by  disease  comorbidity.  Efforts  to 
reduce  functional  impairment  in  all  domains,  rather 
than  focusing  primarily  on  home-related  domains  are 
needed  for  those  with  hoarding;  additional  investi-
gation  should  examine  the  role  of  current  treatment 
programs  in  improving  functional  ability  and  work  to 
identify  specific  approaches  for  targeting  disability  in 
all domains of functioning.
