Abstract

Background: Sexual orientation and gender identity and expression change efforts (SOGIECE) are a set of scientifically
discredited practices that aim to deny and suppress the sexual orientations, gender identities, and/or gender expressions
of sexual and gender minorities (SGM). SOGIECE are associated with significant adverse health and social outcomes.
SOGIECE continue to be practiced around the world, despite denouncements from professional bodies and survivors, as
well as calls for legislative advocacy to prohibit SOGIECE and protect SGM. There are substantial gaps in the availability of
consolidated international research to support and refine legislative proposals related to SOGIECE, including those
currently underway to enforce bans in Canada and elsewhere.
We therefore propose the first systematic review of international data on SOGIECE that will outline the scope and nature
of these practices worldwide. Specifically, we aim to estimate how many SGM have been exposed to SOGIECE, which
sub-groups of SGM experience higher rates of SOGIECE, and how estimates of SOGIECE vary over time and place. In
addition, we aim to describe when, where, how, and under what circumstances SGM are exposed to SOGIECE.
Methods: To locate an interdisciplinary swath of papers, nine (9) bibliographic databases will be searched: Medline
(OVID), Embase (OVID), PsycInfo and Social Work Abstracts via EBSCO, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, LGBTQ+
Source, and Proquest Dissertations & Theses Global and Sociology Collection (ProQuest). A gold standard search will be
developed for Medline and adapted to the other databases. Grey literature will be searched at relevant websites, and
reference harvesting will be performed in relevant SOGIECE scientific consensus statements. Two authors will
independently screen abstracts/titles, screen full texts, abstract data, and apply risk of bias assessments. A narrative
synthesis will be implemented to summarize findings.

Discussion: This review will address the gap in synthesized data regarding the prevalence of SOGIECE, social correlates of
SOGIECE, variations of SOGIECE over time and place, and the circumstances, settings, and time-points of SOGIECE
exposure. Findings from this review will directly inform ongoing and new legislative efforts to ban SOGIECE and other
interventions that aim to stem SOGIECE practices and support SOGIECE survivors.

Introduction
Background and rationale
What are conversion therapy and SOGIECE?
“Conversion therapy,” sometimes referred to as “repara-
tive therapy,” “reintegrative therapy,” or “reorientation
therapy,” refers to a set of pseudo-scientific, discredited
practices that aim to deny and suppress the sexual orien-
tations, gender identities, and/or gender expressions of
sexual and gender minorities1 (SGM). Conversion ther-
apy ranges from talk-“therapies” to invasive treatments
such as eclectic shock therapies [1]. Given the variability
in how conversion therapy is articulated and practiced, a
fulsome examination requires a broad definition. To
capture the breadth of conversion therapy-related prac-
tices, such as a youth speaking to a counsellor who pro-
vides advice on repressing sexual attraction, a physician
prescribing medication to suppress
sex drive, or
intentional delay of gender non-affirming care to a
transgender (trans) or non-binary person, this project
uses the phrase sexual orientation and gender identity
and expression change efforts (SOGIECE) [2]. This def-
inition includes, but is not limited to, more formal prac-
tices of conversion therapy. SOGIECE settings include
religious sites, private and unregulated counsellor’s of-
fices, businesses, and licensed healthcare professional of-
[3–5]. Despite the increasing
fices, among others
marginalization of professional-conducted SOGIECE in
recent years, particularly for gender identity and expres-
sion change efforts, many healthcare professionals lack
training and support to deliver gender-affirming care
and may seek ways to deter their patients from transi-
tioning from the gender aligned with their sex assigned
at birth [6–11]. Accordingly, our definition of SOGIECE
includes practices that delay transition for trans and
non-binary people.

The prevalence of SOGIECE:
SOGIECE continue to occur across the globe, including
jurisdictions with strong legal protections for SGM, such
as Canada [2, 12]. To-date, no attempts have been made
to synthesize quantitative prevalence estimates
(i.e.,
using a systematic review methodology). Recent Canad-
ian data estimate that, as of 2019, 20% of sexual minority
men have been exposed to SOGIECE and 8% have

1Sexual and gender minorities refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, non-binary, queer, and Two-Spirit (LGBTQ2) people.

experienced more circumscribed “conversion therapy”
practices [1]. In addition, a 2019 Canadian survey with
trans people estimated that 11% have experienced con-
version therapy at some time in their lives [13], likely a
low estimate given the narrower definition used. In the
United States (US), empirical data suggest a lifetime
prevalence of SOGIECE exposure of 7–18% among sex-
ual minority (i.e., non-heterosexual) people [4, 5] and
14% among trans, non-binary, and other gender minority
(i.e., non-cisgender) people [6]. Approximately half of
SGM people exposed to SOGIECE were subjected to these
change efforts during childhood or adolescence [4, 5].
Lifetime prevalence of SOGIECE exposure is highest
among those born before 2000 [2, 7]; however, at least 3–
4% of SGM children and adolescents (born after 2000) are
estimated to have been exposed to such practices (likely
much higher, owing to the challenges in sampling and
surveying youth currently/recently exposed to SOGIECE)
[2, 4]. Among US sexual minority populations, up to 60%
of those exposed to SOGIECE report experiencing these
change efforts in religious settings, while the remainder
visited counselors (many unlicensed), psychologists, and
psychiatrists [3–5]. Among US gender minority popula-
tions, 35% report exposure to SOGIECE in religious set-
tings, with the remainder of SOGIECE occurring in
secular settings, including offices of medical doctors and
psychologists [7]. Taken as a whole, SOGIECE are highly
prevalent and continue to harm SGM worldwide; how-
ever, there is a need to more carefully compile and analyze
these published estimates to understand how they vary
over time, place, social characteristics of participants, and
definitions of conversion therapy/SOGIECE.

The effects of SOGIECE:
SOGIECE are ineffective, harmful, and often lead to
poor psychosocial outcomes. For example, SOGIECE
have been associated with poor self-esteem, internalized
stigma and discrimination, self-harm, self-hatred, de-
pression, anxiety, and adaptive substance use (i.e., as a
form of coping or suppression) [2, 14]. More generally,
SOGIECE can lead to isolation from both communities
of origin and SGM communities, as many survivors of
SOGIECE feel that they have lost years of their lives and
are not able to embrace their authentic selves [12, 15].
Most alarmingly, it is estimated that over a third of those
who experience SOGIECE attempt suicide [2], a statistic

regulating bodies

that does not capture those who have died of suicide.
More than 40 professional
(e.g.,
American Psychiatric Association, Canadian Psycho-
logical Association) and numerous regions (e.g., New
York, Malta) have denounced SOGIECE due to its inef-
fectiveness and detrimental health and social
impacts
[11, 16–19]. Further, several SGM have spoken about
their experiences of SOGIECE through political engage-
ments, media, and books to share how it has impacted
their lives (e.g., Muse [20]; Poisson [21]).

There is limited SOGIECE-related research—a critical
knowledge gap, given ongoing public policy efforts to
end SOGIECE and devise health and social support
agendas for those who have experienced these practices.
Over the past year, numerous national, regional, and
local governments have introduced legislation to ban
SOGIECE—with varying degrees of support or oppos-
ition across geographic, religious, and political
lines.
Rigorous research syntheses to support or refine legisla-
tive proposals related to SOGIECE are not available at
this time. We therefore propose a systematic review of
international data on the scope and nature of SOGIECE.

Study aim and research question:
The aim of this review is to synthesize quantitative and
qualitative literature that addresses the scope and nature
of SOGIECE among SGM worldwide. To fulfil this aim,
we propose the following research questions:

(1) What is the scope of SOGIECE globally? In

response to this question, we will estimate how
many SGM have been exposed, which sub-groups
of SGM experience higher rates of SOGIECE, and
how estimates of SOGIECE vary over time and
place.

Definitions:
As there are varying definitions associated with this
topic, it is necessary to define how particular terms are
being taken up, see Table 1.

Methods
Protocol and study team
This systematic review protocol follows the PRISMA-P
guideline for systematic review protocols and checklist
(see Additional file 1 for PRISMA-P checklist) [24]. The
systematic review team includes expertise in research
methods (DG, TS, OF, AA, HK), substantive areas, in-
cluding SOGIECE and SGM health (TS, OF, HK, FA,
DJK, AA, ED, TG), and biomedical
library sciences
(DG). The research team will meet regularly throughout
the review to identify and resolve challenges, validate
and reconcile inclusion/exclusion decisions, and ensure
quality and rigour of the review processes. The system-
atic review protocol has been registered on PROSPERO
under the number: CRD42020196393.

Eligibility criteria
The following criteria will be implemented for screening
and selection of studies:

a. Language

Language restrictions will be in place for both screen-
ing and final inclusion of studies. Literature in French,
Spanish, and English will be included due to feasibility
and French, Spanish, and English being the languages
spoken by members of the research team.

b. Participants

(2) What is the nature of SOGIECE globally? In

response to this question, we will describe when,
where, how, and under what circumstances SGM
are exposed to SOGIECE.

Studies involving SGM, according to definitions pro-
vided above, of all ages will be included. SOGIECE prac-
tices have been documented across a wide range of ages,
countries of origin, genders, gender identities, and sexual

Table 1 Definitions

Sexual orientation and gender identity
change efforts

“a person’s capacity for profound emotional, affectional, and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual
relations with, individuals of the same gender, of a different gender, or of more than one gender” [11]
“a person’s deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender including the personal sense of the
body. Gender identity may be completely male or female or may lie outside the male/female binary” [11]
“a person’s desired external appearance as it relates to social expectations and norms of femininity and
masculinity” [11]
“any treatment, practice, or sustained effort that aims to repress, discourage, or change a person’s sexual
orientation, gender identity, gender modality, gender expression, or any behaviours associated with a
gender other than the person’s sex assigned at birth or that aims to alter an intersex trait without adequate
justification” [11]

SOGIECE are related to conversion therapy in that both sets of practices aim to repress, discourage, or
change one’s gender identity, gender expression, and/or sexual orientation; however, SOGIECE additionally
include less well defined and advertised practices, which in some cases may not be sustained (e.g., single
sessions/conversations) [2, 22, 23]

orientations. Therefore, no other restrictions will be
used with regard to participant populations.

c. Time, geography, and setting

SOGIECE have likely been practiced for decades,
if
not centuries; as noted above, SOGIECE are practiced
across multiple countries and settings. We anticipate
that literature on this topic will be sparse; therefore, we
will not restrict studies by date, geography, or setting.

d. Study designs

Quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods studies
will be included in the search, including case studies,
case series, surveys, cohorts, interviews, and secondary
analyses of existing data. We will screen the citations
lists of systematic reviews, commentaries, and letters
retrieved from literature searches. We anticipate that
quantitative studies will be most relevant to research
question 1, regarding the scope of SOGIECE, and
qualitative studies will be most relevant to research
question 2, regarding the nature of SOGIECE, al-
though these methodological distinctions
are not
exact. Due to the inclusion of multiple study designs,
we will not exclude studies based on sample size or
related characteristics. Rather, the limitations of stud-
ies will be considered and discussed within the
review.

e. Content

All studies that include content related to scope (i.e.,
prevalence) and/or nature (i.e., descriptions of circum-
stances,
timing, and setting) of SOGIECE will be
included.

f. Specific exclusion criteria

Given the inclusion criteria above, studies will be ex-

cluded based on the following criteria:

1. Studies about SGM that do not include any

reference to SOGIECE

2. Studies that reference SOGIECE in the rationale

but do not specifically address our objectives related
to the scope and nature of SOGIECE

3. Theoretical or ethical essays on the origins or

mutability of sexual orientation, gender identity, or
gender expression

4. Ethical essays on the practice of SOGIECE
5. Psychotherapeutic guidelines for SGM-affirming

care (except for consensus statements that are com-
ponents of the grey literature search)

Information sources
The following indexed medical, health science, nursing,
psychology, social work, and social science databases will
be searched: Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), CINA
HL, PsycInfo, Social Work Abstracts via EBSCO, Web of
Science Core Collection, LGBTQ+ Source, Dissertations
& Theses Global (ProQuest), and the Sociology Collec-
tion on ProQuest.

In addition to searching the databases above, refer-
ences of all included full-text articles will be reviewed.
Articles identified in this step will also have their refer-
ences reviewed for inclusion in the study. We will hand-
review the reference lists of highly relevant papers (e.g.,
Turban et al. [7]; Ryan et al. [23]) for additional sources
(peer-reviewed and grey literature). Additionally, litera-
ture databases of co-authors and affiliated networks will
be reviewed and compared to a bibliography of all in-
cluded articles identified in previous stages to ensure lit-
erature saturation.

There will also be a targeted grey literature search fo-
cused on the most relevant and robust reference lists of
consensus statements issued by health professional orga-
nizations about the scientific validity (or lack thereof) of
SOGIECE [11].

Search strategy
Two members of the research team, TS and DG, in con-
sultation with all co-authors, have devised a comprehen-
sive, peer-reviewed search strategy.

Exhaustive searches will be conducted using highly-
sensitive strategies given the disseminated nature of the lit-
erature. Nine (9) bibliographic databases will be searched:
Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), CINAHL, PsycInfo and
Social Work Abstracts via EBSCO, LGBTQ+ Source, Web
of Science Core Collection, and Proquest Dissertations &
Theses Global and the Sociology Collection (ProQuest). A
search will be created in Medline and translated into the
requirements of the other databases. In consultation with
the principal investigator, the librarian has developed an
exhaustive list of concepts and controlled terms based on
relevant papers and the expertise of the research team.
Searches will be iteratively improved to increase sensitivity
by testing optimal combinations of keywords, synonyms,
and controlled terms (Table 2). In the absence of con-
trolled terms in the databases for SOGIECE, other related
headings will be incorporated. A grey literature search
strategy will be created based on a combination of brows-
ing reference harvesting and targeted searching of key
websites cited by relevant papers [18, 25–34]. The search
strategy will be peer-reviewed using the Peer Review of
Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) checklist (see Add-
itional file 2) [35]. Duplication of papers will be performed
in RefWorks before the dataset is loaded into Covidence
for title and abstract screening.

Study records: data management, selection process,
abstraction, items, and bias
To support collaboration and organization among the
systematic review team, search results will be uploaded
and stored in Covidence—a systematic review software
manager. The senior authors will provide training to
junior team members regarding the systematic review
software and techniques. TS and ED will independently
screen titles and abstracts, using Covidence, guided by
the above inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagree-
ments will be resolved by consensus, and when in doubt,
articles will be carried forward to full-text review. All ti-
tles and abstracts that meet inclusion criteria will then
have full texts pulled for review. Full texts will be inde-
pendently screened by TS and ED, using Covidence. In
the event that TS and ED cannot achieve consensus,
there will be full discussion, and a third co-author, DJK,
will be consulted.

Data collection will utilize a standardized process. A
data abstraction tool will be used and include titles, au-
thors, year of publication, and findings relevant to the
objectives: nature and scope (Additional file 3). TS and
ED will independently abstract data. Calibration activ-
ities will be conducted among TS and ED to ensure uni-
in their process. Upon completing data
formity

abstraction for 20% of articles, abstractors will meet to
discuss and reconcile differences in abstracted informa-
tion and adjust abstracting procedures going forward,
for a list of data items and definitions, see Additional file
3.

We will use an adaptation of the Hoy et al. (2012) risk
of bias tool for population-based prevalence studies to
evaluate the risk of bias in quantitative studies that are
included (see Additional file 4) [36]. This tool has been
adapted by a subset of authors (TS, DJK, ED) for applic-
ability to SGM samples. Qualitative articles will be
assessed using the CERQual approach that assists in
assessing confidence in qualitative findings [37].

Outcomes and prioritization
The primary outcome of interest is the number of SGM
who have exposure to SOGIECE, based on the defini-
tions provided above. There is a need to understand the
magnitude of SOGIECE worldwide and synthesize
prevalence rates to illustrate that this phenomenon re-
quires global attention.

Secondary outcomes include the following:

1. Where—i.e., the setting where SOGIECE occurred.
This is relevant to identify levels and forms of

Kinitz et al. Systematic Reviews           (2021) 10:14 

Page 6 of 8

policy and legislation that can have bearing on
SOGIECE prevention or enforcement of bans.
2. When—i.e., the age and calendar year when SGM

are exposed to SOGIECE. This is relevant to inform
policy regarding minor and adult protections. Age
will be considered based on numerical presentation
or categorically using such terms as “minor,”
“youth,” and “adult.”

3. Under what circumstances—i.e., reasons and
motivations for attending SOGIECE, whether
forced or compelled to attend or attending
voluntarily.

4. How—i.e., the types of activities constituting

SOGIECE.

These primary and secondary outcomes will be pre-
sented in summary results tables and narrative form, as
appropriate.

Synthesis of results
Results of the systematic review will be presented in a
final report that will be structured according the specific
objectives identified above, corresponding to the scope
and nature of SOGIECE, and the type of data charted.

Quantitative data will be synthesized to the extent pos-
sible given the likely heterogeneity of studies selected. A
meta-analysis is likely not possible due to the variability
of populations (e.g., differing age groups, gender iden-
tities, gender modalities) and definitions of SOGIECE
used [2, 7, 23]. Results will therefore be presented using
a narrative synthesis with tables [38]. Specifically, tables
will be used to display prevalence rates among different
subpopulations of SGM, along with other characteristics
such as geographic area, population demographics (e.g.,
age, religious background), and year of study/article pro-
duction. Analysis of social location and equity factors,
such as socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, gender,
and sexual orientation, will be conducted to better
understand the nuances of SOGIECE and its impacts
across and within various SGM subpopulations. The
identification of potential disparities within this area will
help to inform equity-oriented and population-tailored
responses to SOGIECE,
including supports for those
who have experienced SOGIECE. Qualitative data will
be appraised and combined in the narrative presentation
as these data relate to the relevant section—scope and
nature. In addition, results will be highlighted and dis-
cussed narratively per their relevance and potential to
inform policy.

In the final section of the synthesis, we will discuss the
limitations of the current literature as per the findings of
the review as well as the limitations of the current study.
Given the dearth of literature discussing SOGIECE, it is
likely that there will be several challenges in clearly

identifying robust reports that can independently answer
our research questions. Reports are likely to omit various
populations and demographics impacted by SOGIECE
and to inadequately present information related to the
outcomes under study.

Discussion
This proposed systematic review of the prevalence and
scope of SOGIECE will be the first of its kind conducted
to date. Two prior systematic reviews have been pub-
lished on the topic of conversion therapy, to the know-
ledge of our co-author team [39, 40]. One of these
reviews was focused solely on gender minorities and
used a relatively limited set of search terms [39, 41]. The
other review was solely focused on sexual minorities and
did not examine estimates of prevalence [40]. We believe
that it is beneficial to simultaneously review literature on
SOGIECE targeting sexual orientation, gender identity,
and gender expression, given overlap between SGM pop-
ulations (i.e., some sexual minorities are trans; some
gender minorities are queer, bisexual, lesbian, gay), the
unspecific nature of some SOGIECE (i.e., some practi-
tioners conflate sexual orientation and gender identity,
or primarily target non-conforming gender expressions),
and the potential to attend SOGIECE with a practitioner
who targets more than one of: sexual orientation, gender
identity, and gender expression.

vidual experiencing SOGIECE.

Dissemination
The impetus for this systematic review is the need for
policy makers and legislators to have readily available,
scientifically robust, and synthesized evidence to inform
policy changes involving SOGIECE. Findings from the
proposed systematic review will be beneficial to legisla-
tors in Canada and other countries and jurisdictions
considering SOGIECE bans,
such as Australia and
Ireland [42–44]. Furthermore, identifying the scope and
nature of SOGIECE will assist health care providers,
SGM community leaders and advocates, and SGM
people themselves when determining supports needed
for those who have experienced these practices. This

Page 7 of 8

systematic review will be published in an open-access,
international journal that will provide evidence for coun-
tries considering or implementing federal, provincial, or
municipal bans on SOGIECE. In addition, our findings
will be shared with Canadian policy leaders and inform a
community-based strategic planning meeting involving
survivors, researchers, service providers, and politicians.
Lastly, findings will be presented at relevant national
and international conferences.
