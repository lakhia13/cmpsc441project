Abstract

Mindfulness meditation represents a mental training framework for cultivating the state of mindful 
awareness in daily life. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in how mindfulness meditation 
improves human health and well-being. Although studies have shown that mindfulness meditation 
can improve self-reported measures of disease symptomatology, the effect that mindfulness 
meditation has on biological mechanisms underlying human aging and disease is less clear. To 
address this issue, we conducted the first comprehensive review of randomized controlled trials 
examining the effects of mindfulness meditation on immune system parameters, with a specific 
focus on five outcomes: (1) circulating and stimulated inflammatory proteins, (2) cellular 
transcription factors and gene expression, (3) immune cell count, (4) immune cell aging, and (5) 
antibody response. This analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity across studies with respect to 
patient population, study design, and assay procedures. The findings suggest possible effects of 
mindfulness meditation on specific markers of inflammation, cell-mediated immunity, and 
biological aging, but these results are tentative and require further replication. On the basis of this 
analysis, we describe the limitations of existing work and suggest possible avenues for future 
research. Mindfulness mediation may be salutogenic for immune system dynamics, but additional 
work is needed to examine these effects.

through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally to the 
unfolding of experience moment by moment” (p. 145).1 Mindfulness meditation, in turn, 
represents a systematic framework and process for cultivating mindfulness in daily life by 
intentional and sustained practice.

Several standardized programs have been developed for cultivating mindfulness meditation, 
with the goal of realizing its potential benefits for human health and well-being. Credit is 
ordinarily assigned to the 1970s Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program as 
the first standardized mindfulness-based intervention (MBI). These programs are based on 
secularized teachings from various historical mindfulness meditation traditions, especially 
eastern humanistic contemplative traditions rooted in the cultivation of personal insight and 
wisdom.2,3 To reduce symbolic dissonance and surmount cultural barriers to access and 
participation, MBIs serve as a template for translating ancient teachings into a language and 
practice that is acceptable and easily understood by contemporary society.

The presence of MBIs in major healthcare settings is at an all-time high. Indeed, almost 80% 
of the 140 accredited medical schools or their associated universities in the United States 
presently incorporate MBIs into their treatment, education, and/or research programs.4 
Reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that MBIs can exert some 
beneficial effects on stress-related ailments, psychiatric disorders, and disease 
symptomatology.5–9 However, mindfulness meditation is not regarded as a therapeutic 
panacea for all ailments, and the effects of MBIs on health appear similar in magnitude to 
those demonstrated by other conventional approaches for treating stress, pain, and illness, 
including the administration of psychoactive medications, psychotherapy, health education, 
and behavior modification.6,10–15 MBIs nevertheless enjoy increasing appeal, stemming 
from a mix of promising empirical evidence, a modern medicine paradigm that increasingly 
emphasizes the role of patients as active and accountable participants in health care (e.g., 
self-management of disease and engagement in preventive behaviors),16–18 and a growing 
emphasis on transtherapeutic interventions.19

So far, the research base documenting the effectiveness of MBIs relies heavily on 
participants’ self-reports of their own health status, which can be prone to bias.2,8,10,20 A 
more recent, yet relatively small, literature also exists examining how MBIs affect objective 
biological markers of human health,21 but to date, no comprehensive literature reviews have 
been conducted to evaluate how mindfulness meditation influences biological processes that 
are most proximally relevant for disease pathogenesis. Markers of immune system activity 
are particularly relevant in this context, given that immune system dynamics have been 
implicated in several major mental and physical health problems, including asthma, 
rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, certain types of 
cancer, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression.22,23 Therefore, in the present review, 
we examined the question of whether MBIs can influence peripheral biomarkers of immune 
system activity.

To conduct this review, we performed a comprehensive literature search that involved 
identifying all of the RCTs that tested the effects of mindfulness meditation on immune 
system biomarkers. We focused specifically on five immune system outcomes that are

relevant for health, namely: (1) circulating and stimulated inflammatory proteins, (2) cellular 
transcription factors and gene expression, (3) immune cell count, (4) immune cell aging, and 
(5) antibody response. Below, we describe the methods and results of this systematic review. 
We then discuss the findings and highlight lingering issues and possible avenues for future 
research in order to help advance the goal of better understanding how mindfulness 
meditation may shape biological aging and disease.

  Literature review methods and findings

We scanned all potentially relevant articles published between January 1966 and July 2015 
to examine the literature on mindfulness meditation and immune system activity. The year 
1966 was selected as a start date because this was when the first empirical paper on 
mindfulness meditation appeared. The terms immune, inflammation, cytokine, 
proinflammatory, biomarker, blood, saliva, urine, telomere, and infection were used to 
search the American Mindfulness Research Association’s publication database 
(www.goAMRA.org), which archives over 4000 published journal articles, pulling from 
comprehensive monthly literature searches of PubMed, Ovid, PsycINFO, Web of Science, 
and Google Scholar. Citations were also received from researchers in the field, and table-of-
content searches were conducted for topic-specific journals. In addition to the computer-
assisted searches, bibliographies of previous publications on the topic were screened for 
relevant articles. When required, authors were contacted to clarify details regarding their 
study methods or blood sampling protocols. Articles were included if they: (1) used an RCT 
design, (2) administered mindfulness meditation as the main intervention element, (3) 
objectively assessed a biomarker of immune-related activity, and (4) were published in 
English.

  Description of the field of work

Included studies

A total of 20 RCT studies met the inclusion criteria above and were thus included (Table 1). 
Two studies resulted in multiple publications, but these data were only counted once (Table 
1; Study column). The mean sample size of these 20 studies was n = 80 (range: 21–201), and 
a total of 1602 participants were included in the analysis.

  Comparison conditions

Less than half of the studies (n = 8; 40%) administered a comparison condition that 
accounted for the nonspecific effects of the intervention protocol, including time, attention, 
and group effects. Active comparator programs included exercise, sleep hygiene, group 
therapies, mind–body medicine, health education courses, and cognitive behavioral therapy. 
Half of the studies used a waiting list or usual care group for comparison to mindfulness 
meditation (n = 10; 50%), which did not account for nonspecific effects. Other 
nonequivalent comparator groups included less intensive single-day educational courses, 
access to resource services, and short-term respite care for caregivers (n = 2; 10%).

  Sample selection

Page 4

Females were oversampled, as 14 of the 20 studies examined (70%) had samples that were 
60% or more female. This is partly due to disease-specific recruitment of breast cancer 
patients, but may also indicate possible participation bias favoring females due to sex 
differences in motivation to practice mindfulness meditation or participation in research 
studies focused on health and wellness. Supporting this last possibility, studies sampling the 
general community, university staff, and corporate employees also showed proportionately 
greater female participation. Ten studies (50%) selected samples on the basis of disease 
inclusion criteria (e.g., breast cancer, HIV positive, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid 
arthritis), and five studies (25%) recruited participants on the basis of a proposed risk factor 
(e.g., aging, poor sleep, loneliness, overweight/obesity, cardiovascular disease). Finally, five 
studies (25%) recruited healthy volunteers (e.g., corporate employees, older adults, 
meditators, or community residents).

Intervention dosage

All but three studies included in this review administered an MBSR or MBSR-derived 
program (i.e., MBSR with cognitive therapy or additional psychoeducational content), 
indicating high similarity in intervention type across studies. Of the remaining interventions, 
two studies reported on the use of a standardized Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPs) 
course, and one study broadly defined their program as mindfulness, compassion, and 
equanimity meditations led by a senior meditation teacher. Of note, MAPs and the 
generalized mindfulness program appeared to be conceptually the same as MBSR and 
differed only in program dosage and degree of documented standardization. All classes were 
administered in weekly group-based sessions spanning 6–10 weeks. Eight of the studies 
(40%) held an additional single-day intensive meditation retreat per conventional MBSR 
administration. Participants in one study lived at the retreat location for 3 months and 
practiced daily meditation.

  Collection of biological specimens

Eighteen studies (90%) collected peripheral blood via venipuncture for processing of the 
target blood specimen or cell type. The most commonly reported processing protocol was 
the extraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using ficoll for immune 
bioassay. This method is used to isolate leukocytes (white blood cells consisting of T, B, and 
natural killer (NK) cells) from other more predominant immune cells (i.e., granulocytes, 
including neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils). Nasal mucous was collected in one study 
using a nasal wash approach during participant acute respiratory infection episodes.24 
Another study induced skin blisters using a vacuum pressurized blister template and 
subsequently collected blister fluid.25

  Excluded studies

Six studies tested the effect of a mindfulness meditation intervention on at least one immune 
parameter,26–33 but were excluded because they lacked an RCT design. In brief, these quasi-
experimental studies used non-randomized matched control and single-group cohort designs. 
The median sample size of these six studies was n = 51 (range: 34–66), with samples

consisting of breast cancer and prostate cancer patients, experienced meditators, HIV-
diagnosed individuals, and women with a trauma history. Blood was collected in five studies 
(83%) and saliva was collected in one study. All interventions were MBSR or MBSR 
derived. Significant changes in immune measures were observed for levels, count, activity, 
or expression of interleukins (IL)-4, IL-6, and IL-10; interferon gamma (IFN-γ); NK cells; 
monocytes; eosinophils; receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase (RIPK2); 
cyclooxygenase (COX2); regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and presumably 
secreted to stromal-derived factor ratio (RANTES/SDF-1); and telomere length. Findings 
from these studies may suggest potential biomarker targets for future investigation, but the 
results are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution.

  Summary of evidence from randomized controlled trials

Below, we report the results of our systematic review of the 20 RCT studies that met all of 
the inclusion criteria, organized by outcome. Table 1 provides a description and the results 
of the 20 studies included in this review.

  Circulating and stimulated inflammatory proteins

Inflammatory proteins are produced by immune cells and serve as extracellular 
communicators during immune system activity. When circulating, these proteins propagate 
proinflammatory (e.g., liver-derived C-reactive protein; CRP) or anti-inflammatory (e.g., 
cell-derived IL-10 cytokine) effects. These proteins are essential for systemic preservation 
(i.e., protection against autoimmunity and septic shock) and immune cell differentiation; 
however, dysregulated and chronically elevated levels of proinflammatory proteins increase 
risk for disease, poor healing, and mortality.34–36 Of the 20 studies reviewed, nine measured 
inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and its 
receptor agonist sTNF-RII, and IFN-I, as well as CRP.

Five studies quantified circulating levels,37–42 and one additional study reported on 
stimulated levels,42 of IL-6 in blood. Of these studies, one study of female breast cancer 
patients engaging in a 6-week MAPs course (compared to a waiting-list control group) 
showed a relative reduction in post-intervention circulating levels of IL-6 that was dependent 
on the frequency of practice dosage.37 Three studies measured IL-8,24,25,39 one of which 
showed a relative increase in IL-8 in nasal secretions in older community-dwelling adults 
after an 8-week MBSR course (compared to moderate-intensity exercise).24 In addition, two 
studies measured IL-10 in blood,24,39 one of which showed a relative increase in IL-10 in 
ulcerative colitis patients after MBSR (compared to a matched mind–body medicine 
program), specifically among patients who experienced a symptomatic flare up.39 Four 
studies measured TNF-α,25,37,41,43 of which one study of healthy community volunteers 
showed reductions in TNF-α in blister fluid following MBSR, with these effects being 
dependent on practice time,25 and a second study of ulcerative colitis patients showed a 
trend effect for reductions in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated TNF-α production following 
MBSR intervention.43 Furthermore, three studies measured IFN,37,44,45 one of which 
showed a relative increase in IFN-I in female breast cancer patients after a 6-week MAPs 
intervention.37 A second study showed that females recovering from breast cancer who

received MBSR had an increased IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio. Finally, six studies measured 
CRP,37–41,46 of which three showed a reduction in CRP, with one study showing reduced 
CRP levels after MBSR among non-flared patients with ulcerative colitis,39 and two other 
studies showing a trend for reduced CRP levels after MBSR-type programs among non-
diseased samples displaying an inflammatory risk factor.38,40

  Cellular transcription factors and gene expression

Transcription factors are intracellular molecules in immune cells that modulate the activity 
of immune response genes and their production of extracellular proteins.47 For example, 
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor that, when activated, translocates into the 
cell nucleus and binds to DNA at the promoter region, thus activating genes for 
expression.48 NF-κB functions as a precursor to increased concentrations of 
proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood and thus helps coordinate the inflammatory 
response.49,50 Some psychoneuroimmunologic models propose that NF-κB activity is a key 
intracellular pathway linking the central nervous system (CNS) psychological threat cascade 
with neuroendocrine signal-mediated peripheral immune system dysregulation.51,52 
Consistent with these models, acute psychological stress has been shown to activate NF-κB 
in PBMCs.53–55

Of the studies reviewed, three measured NF-κB in PBMCs37,38,56 and showed a reduction in 
NF-κB after the MBI. Two studies—one in lonely older adults and the other in breast cancer 
patients—showed a relative reduction in the expression of NF-κB after MBSR and MAPs 
(compared to waiting-list controls) using promoter-based bioinformatics measures of 
functional genomic activity.37,38 A third study showed that MAPs produced a reduction in 
activated NF-κB p65 in older adults exhibiting sleep disturbances; however, NF-κB was also 
significantly decreased in the highly active sleep hygiene comparison condition.56

Immune cell count

When engaged by an immune challenge, immune cells are differentially activated, 
generated, and then deployed by the immune system to target regions to protect the body 
against infection and promote tissue recovery. As such, cell distribution or count is used as a 
diagnostic marker for various immune-compromising diseases. For example, a decline in 
CD4+ T lymphocyte count is a standard immune cell signal of disease progression in HIV 
patients.57 Further, chronic stress and depression can inhibit immune cell activity and 
proliferation, and thus weaken defenses against tumorigenic surveillance and growth.58

Immune cell counts pertain to cells constituting the innate (neutrophils) and adaptive (T, B, 
and NK cells) subsets, and this count was quantified in five studies.24,45,59–61 In one of these 
studies, there was no relative change in neutrophils (mucous from nasal wash) after MBSR-
derived intervention in older adults experiencing an acute respiratory illness.24 Of the other 
four studies that enumerated lymphocytes in blood, all identified either an increase or a 
buffered decline in T lymphocyte cell count (CD4+ T; CD4+/CD8+ ratio; T helper (Th)1/Th2 
T-helper) and/or activation (% activated T cells) after mindfulness meditation in samples 
diagnosed with a disease (i.e., HIV or breast cancer) as compared to controls.45,59,61,62 
Three of these studies were restricted to people diagnosed with HIV.59,61,62 B lymphocyte

and NK cell counts did not show relative changes in a study of breast cancer patients after 
intervention.45

Immune cell aging

Immune cell telomeres are protective DNA and protein complexes that function as caps to 
protect and stabilize the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, which truncate during cell 
division.63 Shortened telomeres are a marker of immune cell aging and vulnerability to 
apoptosis, and are associated with poorer clinical outcomes and premature death in various 
age-related diseases.64 Telomere length is protected in part by the naturally occurring 
enzyme telomerase, which help slow or reverse cell aging.63 Longer telomeres and higher 
telomerase activity are thus considered to be salutogenic immune system profiles.

Four studies measured telomere length and/or telomerase activity.65–68 Of the two studies 
that quantified telomere length,65,66 one examining breast cancer survivors showed a trend 
for the MBSR-derived intervention to attenuate the telomere shortening observed in the 
control group;65 however, these effects were observed only when samples from the 
mindfulness meditation and supportive group therapy groups were combined to increase 
statistical power. Of the three studies that measured telomerase activity, all showed an 
increase in telomerase activity after mindfulness meditation, at least at the trend level, 
among a diverse set of samples (e.g., meditation retreat participants, overweight/obese 
women, and breast cancer patients).66–68 In one of these three studies, the increase was 
dependent on program attendance—specifically, only high treatment-regiment adherers 
showed a trend for mindfulness mediation–related increases in telomerase activity.67

  Antibody response

Antibodies are immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE) or molecules secreted by 
immune cells (B lymphocytes) that identify and neutralize pathogens (via antigen flagging). 
Antibodies constitute humoral immunity and help immune cells inactivate toxic substances, 
attack viruses and bacteria, and assist in the function of other immune cells. Suboptimal 
antibody response is commonly found in immune-compromised individuals (e.g., HIV 
disease progression),69 persons experiencing chronic stress,70 and older adults (> 60 years of 
age).71 Antibody titer tests demonstrate serologic immunity by quantifying the level of 
antibodies in blood, mucous, or other tissue samples.

Antibodies were measured in three studies,44,72,73 two of which examined antibody response 
to influenza vaccination;44,73 one revealed that MBSR led to a significantly greater rise in 
hemagglutination-inhibition influenza antibody titers from the 4–8 week blood draw period 
(compared with controls in a sample of corporate employees).73 The second study did not 
show relative changes in serum influenza antibody or nasal IgA in older adults.44 The 
antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin was administered in a third study of older adults, which 
showed a relatively greater increase in IgG immediately after MBSR intervention; 
additionally, a smaller increase in IgG was observed at the 24-week assessment.72

  Summary of evidence and implications for future research

The present review is the first to interrogate the findings of the RCTs that have been 
conducted to date on mindfulness meditation and the immune system. This comprehensive 
examination included data from 1602 participants and revealed tentative evidence that 
mindfulness meditation is associated with changes in select biomarkers of immune system 
activity. When using the criteria of three or more RCTs showing that mindfulness meditation 
has at least a trend-level or dosage-dependent effect on immune parameters, we identified 
mindfulness mediation-related effects for the following four parameters: reductions in the 
activity of the cellular transcription factor NF-kB, reductions in circulating levels of CRP, 
increases in CD4+ T cell count (in HIV-diagnosed individuals), and increases in telomerase 
activity (Fig. 1). In contrast, null findings or a lack of replicated effects were found for 
antibodies (IgA, IgG, influenza), interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), IFN, TNF, and 
various measures of cell count. Considered together, these data point to promising areas of 
future investigation, but we caution against exaggerating the positive effects of mindfulness 
meditation on immune system dynamics until these effects are further replicated and 
additional studies are performed.

With respect to the abovementioned preliminary positive effects that replicated across 
studies, if robust and maintained over time, these types of shifts in immune system activity 
could potentially have beneficial effects on health by influencing mechanisms that are 
known to affect biological aging and disease. For example, countering a dysregulated or 
hypersensitive immune system profile with mindfulness meditation could theoretically 
function to improve organism fitness by enhancing immune defenses that protect against 
viral and bacterial infection, as well as various age-related disease conditions, including 
cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, type-2 diabetes, frailty, and some cancers. To 
test this possibility, future studies will need to examine associations between mindfulness 
meditation, immune function, and disease symptomatology.

Insights garnered from this review provide the basis for further theory building and 
empirical investigation into if, and if so, how, mindfulness meditation influences biological 
processes involved in aging and disease. For example, these findings extend existing models 
of mindfulness meditation, which suggest that mindfulness meditation may downregulate 
the activity of major stress axes in the body, such as the sympathetic–adrenal–medullary 
(SAM) and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axes,21 which are known to influence 
some of the immune system mechanisms identified in this review. To fully realize the 
benefits of this work for improving health, however, additional RCTs are needed that 
examine the robustness and generalizability of the present immune-related findings, as well 
as their relevance for predicting changes in clinical outcomes over time.

Looking forward, there are several points that should be considered when planning future 
studies on mindfulness meditation and immune system dynamics. First, only 40% of the 
RCTs reviewed used control programs that could account for nonspecific treatment effects. 
This leaves substantial room for improving study designs by using comparator groups that 
are better than a waiting-list control condition. Indeed, a description of a standardized active 
control condition that can be used alongside MBIs was recently made available for trial

were dosage-dependent in some instances. As a result, beyond obtaining adequate sample 
sizes, future studies and interventions will benefit from maximizing treatment adherence. 
This also highlights a need for researchers to collect data on individuals’ class attendance 
and/or home practice schedules, and to report on both the overall effects and dosage-
dependent effects when publishing trial results.

Third, in the studies reviewed, immune biomarkers were often included as ancillary 
measures and, consequently, hypothesis tests were frequently underpowered. To truly 
advance this area of study, future projects will need to power studies and calibrate tests for 
changes in immune parameters as primary outcomes, a priori, to avoid false negative results. 
It will also be important to provide clearer rationales for the immune biomarkers chosen for 
inclusion and better descriptions of how those biomarkers relate to the pathophysiologic 
process being studied. Fourth, almost all of the RCTs examined (19/20 studies) employed 
peripheral blood as the main human specimen with which to quantify immune function. This 
is a notable and consistent strength across studies, but it also highlights an opportunity for 
future studies to investigate other less invasive specimens (e.g., mucous, saliva, urine, hair) 
that could be validated against blood and potentially used as biomarkers of mindfulness 
meditation–related changes in immune system dynamics. Finally, the specimen collection 
and processing procedure employed by several studies was not well described, thus 
highlighting an opportunity to improve the reporting of study procedures to enhance 
researchers’ ability to replicate study protocols, especially with respect to the timing of 
specimen collection, steps taken for sample processing and storage, and procedures used for 
assay quantification.

In conclusion, across 20 RCTs and more than 1600 participants, we found tentative evidence 
that mindfulness meditation modulates some select immune parameters in a manner that 
suggests a more salutogenic immune profile. Specifically, mindfulness mediation appears to 
be associated with reductions in proinflammatory processes, increases in cell-mediated 
defense parameters, and increases in enzyme activity that guards against cell aging. 
Although these findings replicated and are based on well-designed RCTs, they are restricted 
to particular populations, subgroup analyses, and disease types. Consequently, additional 
research is needed to test the effects of mindfulness mediation on immune system 
biomarkers to provide a clearer understanding of the robustness and generalizability of 
findings, and to examine the relevance of these findings for clinical symptoms and overall 
health.
