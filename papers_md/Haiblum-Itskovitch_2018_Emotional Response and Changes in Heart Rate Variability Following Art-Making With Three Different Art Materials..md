Art therapy encourages the use of art materials to express feelings and thoughts in
a supportive environment. Art materials differ in ﬂuidity and are postulated to thus
differentially enhance emotional response (the more ﬂuid the material the more emotion
elicited). Yet, to the best of our knowledge, this assumption has not been empirically
tested. The current study aimed to examine the emotional and physiological responses
to art-making with different art materials. We were particularly interested in vagal activity,
indexed by heart rate variability (HRV), because of its association with numerous health
related outcomes. In this study, 50 adults (mean age 33 ± 10.27 years, 52% males)
participated in a repeated measures experiment, in which they were requested to
draw with three art materials (order randomized) differing in their level of ﬂuidity (pencil,
oil-pastels, and gouache paint) intermittent with periods of music. We measured the
emotional response to art-making with each material using a self-report measure and
matrices of HRV using a wearable electrocardiogram device. We calculated two indices
of HRV, one indicative of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity, and one
indicative of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. Art-making with gouache paint
and oil-pastels resulted in improved positive mood, while pencil did not. Art-making
explained approximately 35% of the variability in parasympathetic reactivity, which may
indicate changes in emotional regulation processes during the art-making task. Yet,
ﬂuidity was not sufﬁcient to explain the reaction to art-making. Surprisingly, the largest
suppression of PNS and augmentation of the SNS occurred during art-making with
oil-pastels and not with Gouache. Moreover, PNS and SNS reactivity to oil-pastels
were related to emotional valance, which may point to emotional engagement. We can
conclude that art-making with oil-pastels, ﬁrst created in Japan in 1924 to increase
self-expression of students, results in a unique emotional and physiological responses.
These ﬁndings might be explained by the enhanced tactile experience of art-making with
oil-pastels along with their relative ﬂuidity, triggering an arousal pattern. Further studies
that take the format and presentation of the materials as well as the content of the
artwork, into account, are needed.

HRV and Emotion Following Art-Making

INTRODUCTION

Art therapy is a mental health profession that encourages the
use of art materials to express feelings and thoughts as part
of a supportive relationship. This process has been shown to
promote improved mood (Drake et al., 2011), catharsis and stress
reduction (Curl, 2008). An experimental study examined the
eﬀect of drawing with a black marker on white paper as compared
to writing following a negative mood induction. The researchers
found that drawing led to increased positive aﬀect in comparison
to writing. Furthermore, using art-making (and writing) for
distraction rather than for venting, promoted positive mood
(Drake et al., 2011). The opportunity to choose what to create as
well as the art materials and art-making techniques with which to
create, enhances one’s ability to solve problems, make decisions,
and act upon them (Foster, 1992; Moon, 1994; Czamanski-
Cohen, 2012).

The expressive therapies continuum (ETC) is a theoretical
for the assessment and application of media in art
model
therapy (Lusebrink, 2010). The ETC can be utilized to assess
the predominance of sensory information processing based on
the conﬁguration of formal elements in the art work and the
interaction of the art-maker with the materials. The ETC also
accounts for the eﬀect of the texture and ﬂuidity of the art
materials, which are postulated to diﬀerentially eﬀect the level of
sensory information processing as well as the potential to elicit
emotion (Kagin and Lusebrink, 1978; Lusebrink et al., 2013).
For example, pencils and markers are highly structured, easy to
control, and are assumed to promote limited emotional arousal.
Oil-pastels are soft and easily smeared, thus their use entails
tactile engagement and encourages emotional arousal (Hinz,
2009; Moon, 2010). Finally, gouache paint is an aqueous material
with the potential for regressive engagement and high levels of
emotional arousal. Gouache is used with a brush, which oﬀers
structure and some sense of control (Snir and Regev, 2013).

Several studies interviewed art therapists and art therapy
clients about their experience of engaging in art therapy. Snir and
Regev (2013) analyzed 30 reﬂective writing samples of students
after working with ﬁve diﬀerent art materials. They found that
students reported a sense of pleasure in working with materials
that entailed a risk of getting dirty and losing control. However,
these materials also led to the fear of getting dirty and an
attempt to balance ﬂow and control. Their overall conclusion
is that the art-making experience is related to the interaction
between the material qualities, the art-maker’s personal attributes
and previous art-making experiences. An experiment examined
the eﬀect of 41 children engaging in art-making with pencils,
oil-pastels, and gouache paint over 10 group sessions. The
researchers found decreases in aggression in the group that
used gouache, however, not pencils or oil-pastels. Furthermore,
there were no changes in self-esteem, anxiety, or self-control
following the group art-making (Passo-Aviv et al., 2014). Two
studies qualitatively investigated the opinions and experience of
art therapists of the use of art materials in art therapy assessments
(Pénzes et al., 2014, 2015). These authors used focus groups and
interviews to create a categorization of the ways in which art
therapy clients interact with art materials. They concluded that

art therapists observe how clients interact with art materials to
assess cognitive and emotional characteristics. In addition, the
authors claim that these studies conﬁrm the ETC claim that
resistive art materials lead to cognitive processes while ﬂuid
materials promote aﬀective processes.

However, this conclusion is based on art therapists’ clinical
experiences rather than empirical knowledge. To support the
theoretical base of the art therapy profession, empirical studies
of an experimental nature along with clinical trials need to be
conducted. The Bodymind model of Art Therapy (Czamanski-
Cohen and Weihs, 2016) delineates several mechanisms through
which Art Therapy beneﬁts clients. The model is developmental
and epigenetic in nature, meaning that each therapeutic process
described develops from a preceding process in a cyclical
manner (Wynne, 1988). The processes begin with the triangular
relationship between the client- the art- therapist and the art-
making process and product, which is elementary in any art
therapy setting. It proceeds to self-engagement that is possible
after a basic security in relationship is established. The self-
engagement emphasizes the self as the integration of body and
mind when engaged in art therapy. The third process is the
embodied self-expression that occurs when emotional content
transitions from implicit to explicit expression which can occur
on a continuum in which content remains embedded in a
visual metaphor to a verbal discussion during and following
art-making. Lastly, meta-cognitive (thinking about thinking)
processes include mechanisms that entail exploration and
reﬂection of the self, the art-making process and product as
well as relationships in and outside of the art therapy setting.
Each core process is further divided in to several mechanisms
that can be measured in experimental or clinical studies. The
mechanisms can overlap and occur under several processes, or
just one, depending on their nature. The core processes are
cyclical rather than linear and can be revisited over sessions
or within one session. The bodymind model has two main
goals- to describe how art therapy may have a salutary eﬀect on
individuals and to provide a clear framework for the conduct
of studies that examine how art therapy beneﬁts clients. This
study follows the latter call to empirically examine psychological
and physiological responses following art-making. One proposed
physiological measure with cognitive and emotional implications
is heart rate variability (HRV).

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is the primary neural
mediator of physiological responses to internal and external
stimuli and is comprised of the sympathetic nervous system
(SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). The two
branches of the ANS usually act in a reciprocal opponent fashion
on target organs. However, the balance between sympathetic
and parasympathetic activity is not a simple bipolar unimodal
process and under some physiological conditions, both branches
are enhanced or inhibited at the same time (Teﬀ, 2008). The SNS
has an activating role and stimulates the body’s ﬁght-or-ﬂight
response to stressful situations while the PNS has an inhibiting
role and promotes relaxation (Porges and Byrne, 1992). The HRV
index is a non-invasive way to gauge ANS activity (Porges and
Byrne, 1992). Fluctuation in the intervals between heartbeats
comprise the HRV index and express the responsiveness of the

HRV and Emotion Following Art-Making

cardiovascular and nervous systems to the constantly changing
external and mental environment (Cohen and Taylor, 2002).

The vagus nerve is the longest nerve in the ANS and it
innervates many of the body’s organs. The vagus is also partially
responsible for the ANS innervation of the heart. The myelinated
vagus actively attenuates the SNS’s inﬂuences on the heart.
The most inﬂuential theoretical frameworks that guide a large
portion of HRV studies emphasize the neural inﬂuence that
aﬀect behavioral ﬂexibility following changes in the physical,
emotional, and social environment. Porges’s (2007 & 2011)
Polyvagal theory emphasizes the importance of this system in
response to emotional and social stimuli. The neurovisceral
integration model (NIM, Thayer and Lane, 2000) also emphasizes
the role of the vagus in adapting to the environment. The NIM
focuses on HRV as indicative of vagal inhibition of the heart
and reﬂecting the primary output of the ANS. The NIM also
provides the platform for further studies that associate brain
activity and functioning, that are beyond the scope of this paper.
Both models are complementary and have diﬀering, but not
contrasting emphases on the role of vagus nerve, reﬂected in
HRV. The NIM postulates that higher resting HRV indicate
tendencies for appraisal while the Polyvagal theory associates
higher levels of HRV with a capacity for social engagement
(Kemp et al., 2017).

Heart rate variability at rest is indicative of ANS health.
High variability is associated with a range of motion and
ﬂexibility in physiological processes, adaptive response, and good
adaptability to changes. Therefore, people with low HRV at rest
tend to be less ﬂexible both physiologically and behaviorally
in adapting to environmental demands (McCarty et al., 1995;
Lane et al., 2009; Meerwijk et al., 2014). Low HRV at rest was
found to be associated with diﬃculties in emotional regulation
(Williams et al., 2015) and psychiatric conditions (Adrian et al.,
2011). However, when participants used an eﬀective strategy for
emotional regulation (reassessment), the diﬀerence in resting
HRV between anxious and non-anxious individuals was reduced
(Reinecke et al., 2015).

Heart rate variability reactivity is a change from the basal
state in response to stimuli. An increase in the respiratory sinus
arrhythmia (RSA) index, which is a high frequency index of HRV,
indicates an increase in heart’s vagal cardiac control, which is
reﬂected in a decrease in heart rate (HR), and a decrease in the
RSA indicates a withdrawal in the vagal eﬀect on the heart, which
is reﬂected in an increase in HR (Malliani et al., 1994; Malik, 1996;
Porges, 2007; Rottenberg et al., 2007; Meerwijk et al., 2014). High
volatility, theoretically attesting to high adaptability, is associated
with high attention processing and regulatory capabilities (Suess
et al., 1994). The emotional response to stimuli results in a
decrease in RSA (Yaroslavsky et al., 2013).

Two other mechanism proposed by the Bodymind model
(Czamanski-Cohen and Weihs, 2016) are tactile engagement
and relaxed arousal, both measured using the self-assessment
manikin visual analog scale (SAM; Bradley and Lang, 1994).
Tactile engagement relates to the experience of interacting with
the art materials that begins in the exploratory and pre-symbolic
stages of art-making. This mechanism is postulated to lead to
the experience of pleasure related from a sensory experience.

The SAM can measure the intensity of that response using
the dominance sub-scale. The tactile engagement with the art
materials can lead to a state of arousal that is well-balanced with
relaxation. The level of arousal and relaxation can be measured
using the SAM. As well as by looking at changes in sympathetic
and parasympathetic indices of HRV.

The objective of the current study was to examine the
theoretical claim that art-making with art materials with diﬀerent
levels of ﬂuidity (pencil, oil-pastel, and gouache paint) creates
a diﬀerentiated emotional and thus physiological response. To
obtain this objective, we conducted a controlled experiment
that measured the mechanisms of emotional response and
HRV during art-making with three art materials. Hypothesis
1: Drawing with diﬀerent materials will diﬀerentially aﬀect
emotional response. We hypothesize that drawing in pencil will
result in the lowest while painting in gouache will result in
the highest arousal. Hypothesis 2: Art-making will aﬀect HRV
compared to baseline. Mean change in the parasympathetic
function will be largest while drawing in pencil and smallest
while painting in gouache. Conversely, we expect an increase
in sympathetic function while engaged in art-making, with
the smallest change expected during drawing with pencil, as
it requires cognitive engagement and planning as compared
to drawing with oil-pastels and gouache paint, respectively.
Hypothesis 3: HRV and self-reported emotional response after
art-making will be related. As emotional response increases
we expect to see decreases in the parasympathetic index and
increases in sympathetic index.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Research Procedure
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty
of Health and Welfare at the University of Haifa. The participants
were recruited using the snowball method through which the
experiment was advertised and interested participants were
requested to invite friends and acquaintances to participate in
the study. Conditions while measuring HRV were maintained
by having the subjects in the laboratory between 08:00 and
15:00 to ensure similar environmental conditions. Per guidelines
for experimental studies measuring HRV (Thayer et al., 2008;
Quintana et al., 2016), and to create baseline conditions, 2 h
before the experiment subjects were asked to avoid drinking
coﬀee, eating, smoking, and exercising. Two video cameras were
installed in the room that was activated after signing the informed
consent form and were ﬁlmed throughout the experiment.
After attaching a wearable Electrocardiogram (ECG) device and
adapting to the environment, 5 min of resting HR was measured
in a sitting position to establish baseline HRV.

Each participant engaged in three 10 min art-making sessions
(pencil, oil-pastels, and gouache paint) (see Figure 1). The order
of the art materials was randomized to ensure that the eﬀect
of drawing with the material was not aﬀected by the order of
the presentation. To establish a baseline in terms of arousal,
participants listened to 5 min of relaxing music of their choice

heart disease. The study included 60 subjects, 30 men and 30
women between the ages of 21 and 56 years, with an average
age of 33 ± 10.27 years, 38 of them were born in Israel (63.3%),
18 in the former USSR (30%) and others in diﬀerent countries.
28 of them were single (46.7%), 30 were married (50%), and 2
divorced (3.3%). In terms of education, 20 of them have a high
school education (33.3%), 23 have a bachelor’s degree (38.3%),
18 have a higher degree (30%), and seven have a professional
certiﬁcate (11.7%). Fifty-nine of the participants were Jewish
(98.3%), and 51 deﬁned themselves as secular (85%). Secular Jews,
are individuals who are Jewish by ethnicity, but do not deﬁne
themselves as religious (Cohen and Susser, 2000). 40 were not
engaged in art (66.7%), 14 were engaged in art as a hobby (23.3%),
and six professionally (10%). Four of them reported that they
were in emotional therapy (6.7%) and 11 were taking medication
regularly (18.3). There was no attrition during the study.

Research Tools
Self-Report
The practice of art was coded by a single item “Do you regularly
engage in art-making?” to which the participants marked one
of three possible answers: “No” (1), “Yes, as a hobby” (2), “Yes,
professionally” (3).

Emotional responses were measured with the self-assessment
manikin visual analog scale (SAM, Bradley and Lang, 1994),
which is a valid nine-point visual scale for measuring the
valence, arousal, and dominance of emotional response. The
valence scale ranges from unhappy or sad to happy or joyful.
The arousal scale ranges from calm or bored to stimulated
or excited. The dominance scale ranges from submissive or
“sense of being without control” to dominant or “in control”
(Lang, 1980). Following Tsonos and Kouroupetroglou (2008)
SAM scales were centered on zero ranging from −4 to 4. Valence
and arousal have been validated against physiological responses
related to emotional experiences such as HR, skin conductivity
and electrical activity of facial muscles (Bradley et al., 1992; Lang
et al., 1993).

Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
The frequency of the HR is calculated using spectral analysis
by calculating the diﬀerence in time between each beat [inter-
beat interval (IBI)]: high frequency (HF: 0.15–0.4 Hz),
low
frequency (LF: 0.04–0.15 Hz), and very low frequency (VLF:
0–0.04 Hz)
et al., 1994). The high-frequency
the HRV is associated with vagal activity
component of
that regulates respiration rate and represents RSA. Low RSA
indicates increased activity of the PNS is indicated in a lower
RSA index. We assessed sympathetic function can be using a
non-linear method to analyze ﬂuctuations in heartbeats using a
Lorenz plot and resulting in two indices that point to sympathetic
(CSI) and parasympathetic (CVI) function (Toichi et al., 1997;
Allen et al., 2007), also coined Non-Linear SD1/SD2 (Kemp
et al., 2017). These measures have been ﬁeld validated and
found to have factor structures and patterns of changes from
baseline to stressor consistent with indices of parasympathetic
and sympathetic activity, except CVI, which was not found to
discriminate between baseline and stressor (Hibbert et al., 2012).

(nature sounds, new age, or classical music) before each art-
making session. The rationale for the music listening was to
create a comparable condition before the art-making session
and ensure equal conditions within participants. After each art-
making session, participants reported their emotional response
using a visual analog scale, described below. The subjects received
a (50 cm × 35 cm) sheet of paper and were instructed to draw for
10 min. Participants were encouraged to use the entire 10 min
for art-making. The pencil was provided with a pencil sharpener
and eraser. An open box of 12 colors of oil-pastels was placed on
the table, and participants were told that they can use them in
any way they choose including peeling the wrapper and breaking
the pastel if needed. The box of pastels was replaced for the next
subject if their general appearance was signiﬁcantly aﬀected by
use. Gouache paint in primary colors (yellow, red, and blue),
black and white were presented in a plastic palate, divided into six
bowls and four mixing surfaces, to control the quantities of paint.
In addition, a color mixing chart, a jar of water, a soft, ﬂat-headed
brush (size 6) and a cloth were provided. The subjects were told
that they could request additional paint if needed. The researcher
provided a short explanation of mixing colors and cleaning the
brushes.

Participants
Sixty adults participated in the study (30 women). Inclusion
criteria were: normative development and health, Hebrew
speakers at a level suﬃcient for their participation between the
ages of 18 and 60. Exclusion criteria were current or history of

HRV and Emotion Following Art-Making

Heart rate variability was estimated based on continuous
ECG recordings, at rest and while drawing. ECG was sampled
(1000 Hz, 16 bit) and recorded by a small wireless and
portable device (BioPatch, Zephyr Technology, Annapolis, MD,
United States), that was attached to the participants’ chest
using Ag–AgCl disposable electrodes. ECG series were visually
inspected for artifacts since ECG artifacts might be quite similar
to those of R waves, it may result in R–R, i.e., IBIs miscalculations.
The R component of the ECG was identiﬁed using the QRS-
tool software. ECG series was visually inspected alongside
the identiﬁed heartbeats time points and artifacts (missed or
wrongfully identiﬁed heartbeats) were corrected manually (Allen
et al., 2007). The two indices of HRV (RSA- calculated by the
extraction of frequencies of variability and CSI- using a Lorenz
plot to analyze ﬂuctuations in heartbeats) were calculated using
CMetX software (Allen et al., 2007), is a command-line based
utility that calculates various matrices of HRV given a simple IBI
series as an input. HRV reactivity was calculated by subtracting
the mean HRV index during music listening from the HRV
index during the following art-making session (i.e., positive
values represent higher HRV during art-making compared to the
proceeding relaxation).

Statistical Methods
To compare HRV in the diﬀerent experimental conditions, a
repeated measures ANOVA was performed. In the planned
t-tests were performed, whereas in
pairwise comparisons,
unplanned comparisons a post hoc test of Sidák was used. To
compare the experimental conditions with measurements of a
rank scale, a non-parametric Friedman’s test was performed.
For the pairwise comparisons, we conducted the Wilcoxon test.
To test the correlation between variables, Pearson or Spearman
correlation coeﬃcients were calculated.

RESULTS

Demographic Data
Fifty of our participants (83%) were under the age of 37 while
10 participants were between 40 and 60. Since the eﬀect of age
on RSA was determined, we decided to examine diﬀerences in
HRV at baseline between the two age groups. Baseline RSA in
participants over the age of 40 5.15 (± 0.70.) was found to
be statistically signiﬁcantly lower than RSA in subjects under
the age of 40 6.32 (± 1.21) [t(58) = 3.15, p = 0.003, Cohen’s
d = 1.184]. Because lower RSA due to age diﬀerence may
mask the responsiveness to diﬀerent materials of each group,
we decided to omit them in our analyses. We also identiﬁed
further diﬀerences in demographics between the two age groups
(Table 1). We included 50 participants between the ages of 21
and 36 (see Table 1 for full demographic data). No diﬀerences
were found in HRV, indexed as RSA [t(48) = 0.77, p = 0.442,
Cohen’s d = 0.213] between men [0.643 (± 1.08)] and women
[6.19 (± 1.71)].

It is plausible that participants who practice art on a regular
basis may respond to the experiment diﬀerently than those
who do not practice art. Therefore, we decided to examine

indices in the
diﬀerences between the average physiological
baseline condition between individuals with habitual art-making
experience and those without. No diﬀerence was found at
baseline RSA [t(48) = −0.54, p = 0.052, Cohen’s d = −0.15]
between those who practice or do not practice art.

To examine whether listening to relaxing music could be used
as a baseline for each task we conducted an analysis of variance
between the diﬀerent time-points in which participants were
listening to relaxing music as well as the baseline HRV measure
at the beginning of the experiment. There were no statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the baseline levels (M = 6.32,
SD = 0.16) and music listening (before pencil drawing M = 6.34,
SD = 0.15, before oil-pastel painting M = 6.39, SD = 0.15,
and music before drawing in gouache M = 6.35, SD = 0.17)
[F(3,147) = 0.24, p = 0.868, η2
p = 0.005]. Hence, we conclude that
the state of listening to the music before each material can be
considered a baseline measurement.

Emotional Response and
Art-Making (H1)
The ﬁrst hypothesis was that painting with diﬀerent materials
would result in an emotional response in which pencil would
have the least eﬀect, while gouache would have the largest
eﬀect. In the analysis of the variability of the emotional valance,
a signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found between the experimental
conditions [F(3,147) = 2.93, p = 0.030, η2
p = 0.056]. In a Sidák’s
post hoc test to examine the source of the diﬀerence, we found
that increased positive valance was found following painting with

HRV and Emotion Following Art-Making

gouache in comparison to emotional valence following drawing
with a pencil (p = 0.038), but not in comparison to baseline
valence (p = 0.744). Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no
diﬀerence in emotional arousal nor dominance following art-
making with the diﬀerent art materials (Table 2).

The Relationship Between Art-Making
and HRV (H2)
The second hypothesis was that mean RSA would decrease
and CSI would increase from baseline in each material. This
hypothesis was conﬁrmed in RSA, but not in CSI. The results of
the analysis indicated an interaction between material and state,
with a decrease in mean RSA from resting state while painting
[F(1,49) = 26.155, p < 0.0005]. The eﬀect size (η2
p = 0.348);
indicates that 35% of the variability of RSA is explained by
art-making, regardless of art material. When examining the
diﬀerences in RSA for each of the materials, the smallest change
was as expected during art-making with pencil 6.22 (± 01.020)
compared to baseline 6.34 (± 01.008) [t(49) = 1.40, p = 0.168,
Cohen’s d = 0.105]. But contrary to the hypothesis, the greatest
change was found to be during art-making with oil-pastels 5.90
(± 0.99) compared to baseline 6.39 (± 1.07) [t(49) = 5.51,
p < 0.0005, Cohen’s d = 0.475] and not during art-making
with gouache 6.01 (± 1.09) compared to baseline 6.35 (± 1.21)
[t(49) = 3.63, p = 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.195].

In examining the change in RSA from baseline ((cid:49)RSA),
a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found between the
experimental conditions [F(2,98) = 5.97, p = 0.004]. The eﬀect
size (η2
p = 0.109) indicates the variance of (cid:49)RSA explained
by the drawing material. The change while drawing with a
pencil was small in comparison to oil-pastel (p = 0.007), but
not gouache (p = 0.099). There was no diﬀerence in the
change in RSA between drawing with oil-pastel and painting
with gouache (p = 0.412). The change in CSI from baseline
((cid:49)CSI), was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in the experimental conditions
[F(2,58) = 3.98, p = 0.024] with an eﬀect size (η2
p = 0.24)
indicating that the variance of (cid:49)CSI is explained by the drawing
material. The change in CSI after drawing with a pencil is
smaller than the change in CSI following drawing with oil-pastels
(p = 0.025). The diﬀerence in changes between CSI during art-
making with oil-pastels compared to painting with gouache was
also signiﬁcant (p = 0.02). There was no diﬀerence in the changes
in CSI following painting with gouache and drawing with pencil
(p = 1.0). The means, standard deviations, and results of analyses
of this index in the state of the various materials appear in Table 3.

Examining the Association Between
Emotional Response and HRV (H3)
The third hypothesis was that emotional response and HRV
would be related (increased emotional response and increased
changes in RSA and CSI). Contrary to hypothesis, we found
no linear other relationship between emotional state (valence,
arousal, and control) and HRV parameters (RSA/(cid:49)RSA and
CSI/(cid:49)CSI).

DISCUSSION

The current study examined the eﬀect of drawing with diﬀerent
art materials on HRV and emotional response. Leaning on the
ETC model (Kagin and Lusebrink, 1978) and the Bodymind
model of art therapy (Czamanski-Cohen and Weihs, 2016), we
hypothesized that similar to the stages of visual information
processing in the brain, art-making with ﬂuid art materials
would result in an increase in emotional response (Lusebrink
et al., 2013). This research is unique in its examination of the
relationship between the use of diﬀerent art materials and HRV.
It responds to the claim, presented in the Bodymind model,
that places importance on conducting studies that examine the
ways in which art-making in the framework of a supportive
relationship has a salutary eﬀect.

The hypothesis that creating with diﬀerent materials would
have a diﬀerential emotional response (pencil having the least
and gouache the most) was partially conﬁrmed by increase of
emotional valance but not emotional arousal or control. Art-
making, has been shown to increase positive mood (Drake et al.,
2011) however we expected to ﬁnd increases in arousal and
intensity of emotion following engagement with more ﬂuid art
materials. According to Kapitan (2013), a certain amount of stress
always accompanies the creative process and can be a driving
force in the process. However, the ability to maintain equilibrium,
between arousal and relaxation by require the increased ability for
emotion and sensory regulation. The participants in this study
were a normative population, most likely with eﬀective adaptive
and coping mechanisms, which may moderate their emotional
response following art-making with the diﬀerent art materials.

Flooding and withdrawal during the creative process can
be motivated by self-judgment, performance anxiety, worry,
stress, lack of attention and physical exhaustion (Kapitan, 2013).
In this study, drawing with pencils resulted in the lowest
increases in positive mood. Pencils are monochromatic and may
create connotations to elementary school and be associated with

cognitive (dis)abilities (McManus et al., 2010). This may give
rise to self-criticism, thus making the art-making experience less
pleasant. In addition, the paper presented to the subjects was the
same for all the materials. The properties (size, thickness, and
texture) of the drawing/painting platform inﬂuence its ability to
contain aqueous materials (Moon, 2010). We chose a relatively
large and thick sheet to contain the gouache paint which may
have evoked unease during drawing with pencils.

Unlike pencil, gouache paint was associated with the highest
increase in positive valence, similar to the aggression reduction
found by Snir and Regev (2013). Memories of childhood are
important in working with materials (Snir and Regev, 2013), and
oil-pastels may be perceived as childish and less “artistic,” while
painting by brush and palette, with which artists paint with oil
colors and acrylic, may have been perceived as more mature and
“professional.”

Art-making explained approximately 35% of the variability
in parasympathetic reactivity, which may indicate changes in
emotional regulation processes during the art-making task.
to explain the
However, ﬂuidity alone was not suﬃcient
emotional response to art-making. The hypothesis that art-
making with diﬀerent materials would aﬀect RSA was conﬁrmed
to a large extent however, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
in HRV after painting with gouache compared to after drawing
with oil-pastels. We believe that this may be because of the
mediation of the paintbrush as opposed to drawing with oil-
pastels without mediation. The brush prevents direct contact with
the paint which in turn limits tactile engagement (Kagin and
Lusebrink, 1978; Czamanski-Cohen and Weihs, 2016). Therefore,
even though gouache is more liquid than oil-pastels, oil-pastels
may be experienced as “dirtier” because they smear and leave
marks on the art-maker’s hands. In other words, it is possible
that the intensity of the reaction to the painting material depends
not only on the degree of liquidity of the material but on the
degree of its contact with the art-maker’s skin. Another possible
explanation is related to the relatively thin brush and the way
the gouache colors were arranged on the palette in a limited
quantity which may have increased the art makers’ sense of
control. Possibly a thicker brush and more paint would enhance
tactile engagement and result in greater changes in HRV during
gouache painting. Surprisingly, the largest suppression of the
PNS and augmentation of the SNS occurred during art-making
with oil-pastels and not with Gouache. Moreover, PNS and SNS
reactivity to oil-pastels were related to emotional valance, which
may point to increased emotional engagement.

Drawing with oil-pastels demonstrated a diﬀerential pattern of
sympathetic response in comparison to while drawing with pencil
and painting with gouache paint. CSI decreased while working
with both gouache and pencil while it increased while drawing
with oil-pastels. This ﬁnding may also be indicative of emotional
and cognitive eﬀorts while using oil-pastels.

The context in which oil-pastels were invented as a media
to encourage self-expression is interesting. Inﬂuenced by British
and American art education, the Japanese educational system
during the Taisho period the Jiyu-ga movement theorizing
that free form drawing increases creativity (as opposed to
teaching art through copying, which was the norm at the
time) (Okazaki, 1984). In 1924 by teachers Rinzo Satake and
Shuku Sasaki with the consult of Kanae Yamamoto, the artist
who formed the Jiyu-ga movement, sought to create a new
and local art material to increase self-expression in students
(Ellis and Yeh, 1998). Yamamoto recommended that the new
art material have vivid colors and a soft texture to enhance
creativity (Sakura Color Products of America, 2018). As far as we
know, these hypotheses have not been examined by the Japanese
educational system, or elsewhere. Our study, can provide some
support that oil-pastels are doing what they were designed to
do. Further research is needed to examine the extent of the
self- expression involved, beyond emotion and physiological
response.

Our ﬁndings are also interesting considering the clinical
preference of oil-pastels by art therapists for their tendency to
promote self-expression while maintaining the art-maker with a
sense of control (Snir and Regev, 2013).

Thirdly, we expected to ﬁnd a diﬀerential connection between
emotional response and HRV in response to the various art-
making materials. The greater the hypothesized emotional
response, the greater the increase in mean RSA and vice versa.
However, no relationship was found possibly due to our sample
of a healthy and normative individuals. These associations were
found in a study of individuals coping with psychiatric disorders,
such as depression (Meerwijk et al., 2014). Another possibility is
that the lack of connection stems from the nature of the task. The
purpose of this study was not to focus on a certain emotion, and
subjects were instructed to draw freely. A relationship between
emotion and RSA was found in a normative population when a
manipulation was performed to stimulate certain emotions (Lane
et al., 2009).

Research Limitations
The beneﬁts of this study should be considered along with
its limitations. We had a relatively small number of subjects;
therefore, it was not possible to examine diﬀerences in emotional
response in diﬀerent age groups. The small sample size may
also explain why we did not ﬁnd the expected diﬀerences in
HRV between men and women which were found in larger
sample (N = 1970) or when stress induction was used (Nugent
et al., 2011). Even though drawing with diﬀerent materials was
expected to aﬀect the ANS, the intervention in the current study
did not include stress induction. Furthermore, while the non-
linear calculating CSI, has been used in studies to measure the

HRV and Emotion Following Art-Making

HRV index of sympathetic function (Toichi et al., 1997; Allen
et al., 2007) and more recently validated in the ﬁeld (Hibbert et al.,
2012), other studies question whether HRV indices accurately
reﬂect cardiac sympathetic regulation in short term measurement
(Reyes del Paso et al., 2013; Heathers, 2014).

Another limitation lies in the way art materials were presented
to the subjects. For example, in the case of the gouache paint,
the brush served as an intermediary and prevented direct
contact with the material. Furthermore, placing small amounts
of paint on the palette may have limited tactile engagement and
moderated its impact on emotional involvement and changes
in HRV.

In addition,

in our sampling participants were recruited
using the snowball method, which can lead to homogeneity
in demographics and increased motivation to cooperate with
the researchers. 98% of our participants were Jewish, 86% were
secular, and 68% had an academic education. In addition, the self-
report questionnaires may reﬂect the respondent’s desire to please
the researchers (Cook and Campbell, 1979).

Recommendations for Further Studies
Due to the paucity of research on materials and art therapy,
and the limitations of the research mentioned above, additional
research is needed. In this study, we found the largest decrease
in HRV during drawing with oil-pastels. This ﬁnding raises
questions about the properties of the materials examined, and it
would be interesting to examine the eﬀect of additional materials
that diﬀer from each other by tactile engagement or ﬂuidity.

In addition, art therapists work with a variety of populations
and age groups. Considering the homogeneity of the sample
(Jewish population,
secular, working, and educated), and
considering diﬀerences in HRV found in other studies in diﬀerent
age groups, it would be important to examine a wider range of

populations and age groups. It would be interesting to compare
the response to diﬀerent art materials in diﬀerent groups with the
goal of designing appropriately tailored interventions.

CONCLUSION

The importance of this research to the ﬁeld of art therapy stems
from the growing demand for practice from an evidence-based
research standpoint. This study is based on the ETC model,
which emphasizes the importance of interaction with creative
materials. The results reinforce this model and support the claim
that diﬀerent art materials have a diﬀerent eﬀect on emotional
response and physiology. This research clariﬁes the importance
of art therapists making well-informed choices of art materials.
We call for follow-up studies to continue examining the eﬀect of
art-making with diﬀerent art materials and their association with
emotion, cognition, and physiology.
