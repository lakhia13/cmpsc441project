The  coronavirus  disease  2019  (Covid-19)  pandemic  intensified  the  already  catastrophic  drug  overdose  and 
substance use disorder (SUD) epidemic, signaling a syndemic as social isolation, economic and mental health 
distress,  and  disrupted  treatment  services  disproportionally  impacted  this  vulnerable  population.  Along  with 
these  social  and  societal  factors,  biological  factors  triggered  by  intense  stress  intertwined  with  incumbent 
overactivity of the immune system and the resulting inflammatory outcomes may impact the functional status of 
the central nervous system (CNS). We review the literature concerning SARS-CoV2 infiltration and infection in 
the CNS and the prospects of synergy between stress, inflammation, and kynurenine pathway function during 
illness and recovery from Covid-19. Taken together, inflammation and neuroimmune signaling, a consequence of 
Covid-19 infection, may dysregulate critical pathways and underlie maladaptive changes in the CNS, to exac-
erbate the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms and in the vulnerability to develop SUD. 

This article is part of the special Issue on ‘Vulnerabilities to Substance Abuse’.   

1. Covid-19 and substance use disorder (SUD) syndemic 

1.1. Introduction 

Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged as a world-historical 
pandemic which will change our lives for generations, and the end of 
this global crisis is not in sight. Covid-19 is the third coronavirus in the 
last 20 years to transmit from an animal reservoir to humans (Salajegheh 
Tazerji  et  al.,  2020).  The  causative  virus  has  been  designated  severe 
acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)  coronavirus  2  (SARS-CoV2),  a 
single-strand RNA virus. SARS-CoV2 is genetically close, but a distinct 
version of the viruses which caused the outbreak of SARS in 2003 and 
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 (Coronaviridae Study 
Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 2020). 
The  epidemiology  and  clinical  findings  to  date  suggest  that  Covid-19 
presents  with  a  wide  spectrum  of  disease  characteristics.  The  virus 
devastates host cell function in the lung, resulting in respiratory damage 
as a primary cause of death in some cases, despite mechanical ventila-
tion to achieve lung recovery (Hanidziar and Bittner, 2020). Although 
the host risk factors are not yet completely clear, chronic comorbidities 
(e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases) are thought to 

be key contributors to severe Covid-19 disease (Alhazzani et al., 2020; 
Qin  et  al.,  2020;  Zhao  et  al.,  2020),  potentially  due  in  part  to  the 
exuberant  inflammatory  response  to  infection  (“cytokine  storm”) 
(Stebbing et al., 2020). Additionally, neurological indicators of Covid-19 
disease (e.g., confusion, delirium, dysphoria) have surfaced, suggesting 
that the central nervous system (CNS) involvement may contribute to 
the sustained pathophysiology of Covid-19 (Baig et al., 2020; Wu et al., 
2020). 

The  synergism  between  two  or  more  health  conditions  within  the 
context of both disease and societal factors has been used frequently to 
understand the morbidity and mortality associated with human immu-
nodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  transmission  and  substance  use  disorders 
(SUDs)  (Cisneros  and  Ghorpade,  2012;  Sil  et  al.,  2021;  Tyagi  et  al., 
2016). The syndemic concept is now relevant to the overlapping crises 
associated with the Covid-19 pandemic and the epidemic of abused drug 
misuse,  overdose,  and  the  incidence  of  SUDs.  The  Center  for  Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that more than 33 million people 
have contracted SARS-CoV2 and nearly 600,000 individuals in the U.S. 
have succumbed to Covid-19 ((NCHS), 2021; Statistics, 2021; System, 
2021).  In  parallel,  drug  overdose  deaths  claimed  a  reported  91,862 
people in the U.S. in the 12-month period ending in October of 2020; up 
by ~30% vs. the previous year (provisional data) (Ahmad et al., 2021;

Kuehn, 2021; Prevention, 2021). Recent surveillance data in the Over-
dose  Detection  Mapping  Application  Program  shows  an  18%  rise  in 
overdose deaths since the initiation of stay-at-home orders which cor-
relates with increased of use in all types of substances of abuse (Alter and 
Yeager, 2020a). 

The interaction between Covid-19 and SUDs also includes biological 
factors  triggered  by  intense  stress,  intertwined  with  incumbent  over-
activity of the immune system, and resulting inflammatory outcomes. 
For instance, infection-triggered alterations in host immunity may drive 
key  aspects of  the  psychopathology  observed in  the  current  Covid-19 
pandemic  which  pose  a  significant  vulnerability  for  the  development 
of drug misuse and SUDs in recovering Covid-19 patients (Mazza et al., 
2020). Preclinical research demonstrates that brain inflammation and 
viral-mediated  immune  activation,  like  that  triggered  by  SAR-CoV2, 
result  in  maladaptive  alterations  in  brain  function  which  could  drive 
drug misuse (Amruta et al., 2021; Blednov et al., 2011; Breese et al., 
2008; Cannella et al., 2019; Eisenberger et al., 2010). Like other viruses, 
SARS-CoV2 immunopathology and disease progression are a function of 
factors that drive virus pathogenesis and host vulnerability (Ezeomah 
et al., 2020; Mangalmurti and Hunter, 2020). For example, host proteins 
involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infections, in parallel to host 
immune signaling, impact the kynurenine pathway, a major regulator of 
serotonergic  and  glutamatergic  systems  involved  in  SUDs  and  neuro-
psychiatric  disorders;  in  tandem,  kynurenine  functionality  is  tightly 
regulated by inflammatory events (Anastasio et al., 2020; Attademo and 
Bernardini,  2021;  Klempin  et  al.,  2018;  Linker  et  al.,  2019;  Moral-
es-Puerto et al., 2021; Singer et al., 2012). Given that patient cytokine 
patterns and interferon responses correlate to Covid-19 disease severity 
and neurological complications, dysregulation of serotonergic and glu-
taminergic signaling could generate a cascade of pathophysiology that 
contributes to the escalation of SUDs (Galani et al., 2021; Kohno et al., 
2019; Lucerne and Kiraly, 2021; Nennig and Schank, 2017; Solomon, 
2021).  Thus,  Covid-19  medical  risks  factors  due  to  dysregulated  pe-
ripheral and CNS immunity, may increase the vulnerability to engage in 
drug abuse behaviors. 

This mini-review highlights the relationship between inflammation 
and the kynurenine pathway in the CNS and the potential for vulnera-
bility to SUDs following recovery from Covid-19 (Schematic 1) and fo-
cuses on elucidating aspects of immune-related consequences associated 
with SUDs. 

1.2. Drug abuse and SUDs during Covid-19 

The drug overdose crisis has resulted in the death of nearly 500,000 
individuals between 1999 and 2018, the majority related to the opioid 
class of drugs [e.g., prescription pain relievers, synthetic opioids (fen-
tanyl derivatives), heroin] (Upp and Waljee, 2020). In addition to opioid 
overdoses, cocaine- and methamphetamine-related fatalities increased 
nearly 30%, by approximately 10 deaths daily, between 1999 and 2018 
(Hedegaard  et  al.,  2020).  Alarmingly,  the  CDC  reported  that  30%  of 
overdose deaths involved a combination of stimulants and opioids and 
10% involved stimulants alone (O’Donnell et al., 2020). Unfortunately, 
an 18.6% increase in non-fatal overdoses and an 11.4% increase in fatal 
overdose deaths have been observed during the stay-at-home orders in 
2020  (Alter  and  Yeager,  2020b;  Niles  et  al.,  2021).  Drug  urine  tests 
performed  four  months  before  and  after  the  initiation  of  pandemic 
stay-at-home  orders  indicated  increased  prevalence  of  methamphet-
amine  and  cocaine  use  during  the  Covid-19  pandemic  (Wainwright 
et al., 2020). In fact, the CDC estimates that 13.3% of people began using 
or increased use of abused substances as of June 2020 (Czeisler et al., 
2020) and a self-described 34% increase in binge drinking by U.S. adults 
was also observed during the social isolation conditions of the pandemic 
(Weerakoon et al., 2021). About 40% of individuals increased tobacco 
use during the pandemic at a time that 71% of individuals indicated a 
heightened motivation to quit smoking tobacco and/or electronic ciga-
rettes to reduce harms from Covid-19 (Kowitt et al., 2020). These in-
dicators signal the potential for further elevations in drug overdoses and 
rises in the prevalence of SUDs. 

Substance use disorders are diagnosed in the U.S. with the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 which outlines major SUD 
indicators (e.g., risky drug use, social/interpersonal difficulties linked to 
use, withdrawal/tolerance, failed efforts to control use, etc.) on a scale 
from  mild  to  severe  (Hasin  et  al.,  2013);  this  nosology  also  includes 
craving (a strong desire or urge to take a drug) which is often triggered 
by  cues  associated  with  drug  use  (e.g.,  paraphernalia)  and  elevated 
stress levels (Koob, 2020; Koob and Volkow, 2016; Volkow et al., 2019). 
The  intoxication  induced  by  a  psychoactive  drug,  when  perceived  as 
pleasurable, motivates the user toward episodes of intake, punctuated 
with escalating misuse and abuse, craving and/or withdrawal effects. 
This  cycle  can  devolve  into  a  diagnosis  of  a  SUD  in  susceptible  in-
dividuals. Termination of drug use and efforts to sustain abstinence can 

Neuropharmacology198(2021)1087662I.E. Cisneros and K.A. Cunningham                                                                                                                                                                                                         

be  marked  by  a  high  recidivism  rate  and  reversion  to  drug-using 
behavior  which  interrupts  the  progress  of  abstinence  and  rehabilita-
tion. The magnifying disorder that advances from drug use to misuse to 
SUD  is  linked  to  CNS  pathophysiology  which  engages  an  “expanding 
cycle of dysfunction” in cognition, learning, reward, and emotion (Koob, 
2020;  Koob  and  Volkow,  2016;  Volkow  et  al.,  2019).  Malfunctional 
synaptic  plasticity  in  the  CNS  is  a  key  pathological  element  in  SUDs, 
which  is  dependent  on  the  operational  conversation  across  neurons, 
astrocytes, brain-resident microglia, and oligodendrocytes and is influ-
enced  by the  neurovascular “unit”  of  endothelia and  blood-born cells 
(leukocytes,  platelets,  erythrocytes)  which  carry  peripheral  immune 
cells and released pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 
(Boulanger, 2009; He and Crews, 2008; Mahajan et al., 2008; Malapla-
te-Armand et al., 2005; Niu et al., 2019). The status of CNS immuno-
logical  function  is  impacted  by  exposure  to  life  stressors,  like  those 
associated with Covid-19 during stay-at-home orders and risk for con-
tracting  SARs-CoV2 
infection,  which  evoke  adaptations  further 
impacting the experience of drug abuse (Clay and Parker, 2018; Koob 
and  Kreek,  2007;  Kreek  et  al.,  2005;  Vida  et  al.,  2014;  Wang  et  al., 
2021b). The accumulation of these components likely contributes to an 
increased risk for drug misuse, overdose, and escalation of SUDs during 
the pandemic and following recovery from Covid-19. Disturbingly, 20% 
of respondents diagnosed with SUDs reported a consequent increase in 
drug  use  (Hulsey  et  al.,  2020),  elevating  the  challenges  in  sustaining 
abstinence  and  recovery  and  complicating  efforts  to  reduce  drug 
overdoses. 

Increased  drug  use  and  misuse  during  the  Covid-19  pandemic  is 
likely  attributable  to  a  multitude  of  stressors  including  the  intense 
anxiety about the dangers of becoming infected, the trauma of deaths 
and disabilities in communities, and the socioeconomic impact of lost 
employment (Taylor et al., 2021; Volkow and Blanco, 2021). In addi-
tion, the probability of a synergistic interaction between the immuno-
logical and inflammatory aspects of Covid-19 and the pathophysiology 
of SUDs cannot be discounted (Tien et al., 2011), especially given evi-
dence to suggest that stress and drug misuse cycles promote the devel-
opment  of  SUDs  through  elevated  inflammatory  cytokines  (Blednov 
et al., 2015; Fox et al., 2012; Hueston et al., 2011; Loftis et al., 2013; 

Mandrekar et al., 2002; Truitt et al., 2016). Neurological consequences 
of Covid-19 may contribute to these rises in drug use and misuse and are 
potentially uncaptured side effects of Covid-19 illness that impedes full 
recovery.  Thus,  activation  of  CNS  resident  immune  cells and  amplifi-
cation of inflammation, have a reciprocal effect on stress and substance 
abuse,  which  may  be  additive  during  co-morbidity  and  neurological 
sequalae of Covid-19. 

2. Covid-19 neurological sequelae 

2.1. SARS-CoV2 neurotropism 

The  Coronaviridae  family  of  pathogen  viruses  present  a  clinical 
profile  characterized  primarily  by  respiratory  involvement.  However, 
SARs-CoV2 has the potential to be neuroinvasive based upon clinical, 
translational,  and  basic  research  conducted  with  SARS-CoV  and  the 
MERS-CoV  (Arabi  et  al.,  2015;  Ng  Kee  Kwong  et  al.,  2020).  Multiple 
studies  demonstrate  that,  aside  from  SARS-CoV2  acute  respiratory 
engagement, SARS-CoV2 is neuroinvasive with observed CNS manifes-
tations of Covid-19 (Bullen et al., 2020; Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020; 
Jacob et al., 2020; Puelles et al., 2020; Ramani et al., 2020; Solomon 
et  al.,  2020;  Song  et  al.,  2021;  Yang  et  al.,  2020a).  The  mRNA  for 
SARS-CoV2 was detected in human brain (Puelles et al., 2020; Solomon 
et  al.,  2020)  and  cortical  neurons  in  autopsied  patients  who  died  of 
Covid-19 (Song et al., 2021). Viral SARS-CoV2 proteins were also found 
in endothelial cells of the olfactory bulb in human Covid-19 autopsies 
(Cantuti-Castelvetri  et  al.,  2020).  Several  in  vitro  studies  report 
SARS-CoV2  infection  of  human  pluripotent  stem  cell-derived  neural 
cells,  human  neurons  of 
three-dimensional  brain  organoids, 
neural-perivascular assembloids, and neurospheres (Bullen et al., 2020; 
Jacob et al., 2020; Ramani et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021; Wang et al., 
2021a; Yang et al., 2020a); however, the definitive routes of CNS infil-
tration for SARs-CoV2 remain to be identified. Thus, the virus invades 
neurons, and can be detected in CNS regions with direct connection to 
the point of entry in the olfactory mucosa, but other mechanisms and 
entry  routes  may  allow 
into  brain 
parenchyma.

Schematic  1. Relationship  between  Covid-19,  inflammation  and  SUDs.  Inflammation  and  neuroimmune  signaling  related  to  Covid-19  infection  underlay 
maladaptive changes within key brain regions involved in the formation of drug abuse and SUD behaviors.

factors 

interacts  with  key  human  host 

Neuroinvasive dissemination routes of SARS-CoV2 are proposed to 
include olfactory transmucosal invasion by retrograde transport along 
sensory and olfactory nerves, thereby bypassing the blood brain barrier 
(BBB) (Baig et al., 2020). Alternatively, the hematogenous route via the 
systemic circulatory system may allow SARS-CoV2 to disseminate into 
the  CNS  via  transcellular/paracellular  migration  or  the  Trojan  horse 
strategy  through  host  phagocytes  (Perrin  et  al.,  2021).  Moreover, 
including 
SARS-CoV2 
angiotensin-converting  enzyme  2  (ACE2)  receptor,  transmembrane 
protease serine (TMPRSS) 2/4, cathepsin L (CTSL), two-pore channel 
subtype 2 (TPCN2), and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) to trigger target cell and 
organ invasion (Matschke et al., 2020). In silico analyses revealed the 
highest  expression  of  ACE2  localizes  to  oligodendrocytes,  NRP-1  and 
TPCN2  to  astrocytes,  CTSL  to  microglia,  TMPRSS2/4  to  neurons  and 
NRP-1 to endothelial cells of the brain (Matschke et al., 2020). These 
host factors are implicated in viral tropism to the CNS. In brain tissue 
collected  from  postmortem  Covid-19  patients,  common  neuropatho-
logical findings included astrogliosis in multiple brain regions, micro-
glial  activation,  and  infiltration  of  cytotoxic  T-lymphocytes  in  the 
brainstem and cerebellum which point to clinical findings suggestive of 
viral and autoimmune encephalitis (Matschke et al., 2020). These au-
thors also reported the detection of SARS-CoV2 RNA and viral proteins 
in  the  brains  of  53%  of  the  fatalities  (Ludlow  et  al.,  2016;  Matschke 
et al., 2020). Therefore, detection of SARS-CoV2 RNA, protein, and CNS 
localized host proteins including ACE2, TMPRSS2/4, CTSL, TPCN2 and 
NRP-1, suggest that SARS-CoV2 can infiltrate the CNS, activating neu-
roimmune signaling through host proteins. 

2.2. Host immunity and CNS immune signaling in Covid-19 

Elevated  levels  of  the  circulating  pro-  and  anti-inflammatory  pro-
teins (i.e. cytokines and chemokines), such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, 
IL-6,  IL-10, interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, chemo-
kine (C-X-C) ligand (CXCL)10, and monocyte chemoattractant (MCP)-1 
have been measured during the clinical course of Covid-19 (Bouadma 
et al., 2020; Bronte et al., 2020; Han et al., 2020; La Ros´ee et al., 2020). 
High concentrations of cytokines appear related to the more severe cases 
of Covid-19 based upon epidemiological evidence (Huang et al., 2020a; 
Ludlow et al., 2016). Despite the identification of SARS-CoV2 RNA and 
viral  proteins  in  the  brains  of  patients  who  died  of  Covid-19,  little 
clinical data are available to firmly establish the nature and extent of 
inflammatory-specific  events  in  the  CNS.  However,  recent  findings 
suggest SARS-CoV2-associated CNS inflammation given observations of 
a high degree of astrogliosis, microglial activation and localization of 
microglial  nodules  in  the  brainstem  and  cerebellum  in  postmortem 
Covid-19 patients (Matschke et al., 2020). Magnetic resonance imaging 
scans revealed reactive astrogliosis in postmortem brains (Coolen et al., 
2020; Kanberg et al., 2020) and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein 
levels in plasma of patients who succumbed to Covid-19 (Coolen et al., 
2020; Kanberg et al., 2020), indicating pathological events occurring in 
the  CNS  (Brommeland  et  al.,  2007;  Nyl´en  et  al.,  2006;  Quddusi  and 
Shamim,  2019;  Watanabe  et  al.,  2019).  Positive  staining  for  Major 
Histocompatibility  Complexes  (MHC)  or  MHC  class  II  cell  surface  re-
ceptor and the human leukocyte antigen-DR isotype (HLA-DR) in the 
CNS  of  patients  who  died  from  Covid-19  suggests  activation  of  host 
immunity in the CNS (Aliseychik et al., 2018; Matschke et al., 2020). 
Lastly,  release  of  multiple  inflammatory  cytokines  and  chemokines 
(IL-1β,  IFN-α2,  IFN-γ,  TNF-α,  MCP-1,  IL-6,  IL-10,  IL-12p70,  IL-17  A, 
IL-18, IL-23, IL-33) were generated by SARS-CoV2 exposure of human 
brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs), an in vitro model of 
the BBB (Reynolds and Mahajan, 2021). Considering previous evidence 
of  activated  CNS  immune  signaling  associated  with  SARS  and  MERS 
infection, this cross-section of recent findings illustrates that SARs-CoV2 
profoundly impacts immunological function in the brain.

tonin and melatonin as well as for numerous important CNS and immune 
system proteins. The kynurenine pathway is a major route of degrada-
tion of ingested l-tryptophan not used for protein synthesis which ac-
counts for ~95% of the dietary tryptophan disposal (Yu et al., 1999). 
During tryptophan degradation, the bioactive compound kynurenic acid 
is  produced  and  accounts  for  diverse  biological  functions,  including 
in 
regulation  of 
immune-mediated  disorders  (Huang  et  al.,  2020b).  Several  viral  in-
fections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Huengsberg 
et al., 1998), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Larrea et al., 2007), and herpes 
simplex  virus  (HSV)  (Atlas  et  al.,  2013)  increase  activation  of  the 
kynurenine  pathway,  which  interestingly  is  implicated  in  the  neuro-
logical and cognitive impairments of HIV, HCV, and HSV patients (Atlas 
et al., 2013; Baran et al., 2012; Weinstein et al., 2019). Therefore, it is 
possible that the kynurenine pathway is a driving factor in the devel-
opment  of  Covid-19  neurological  sequelae  given  that  the  kynurenine 
pathway  is  activated  in  patients  with  Covid-19.  In  two  separate 
metabolomic studies, Covid-19 patients had significantly reduced serum 
levels  of  tryptophan  and  serotonin  and  elevated  serum  levels  of 
L-kynurenine (Shen et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2020). In another study, 
severely ill Covid-19 patients showed significantly higher L-kynurenine 
levels compared to Covid-19 negative or control patients (Fraser et al., 
2020).  These  studies  did  not  evaluate  CNS  levels  of  kynurenine  or 
kynurenic acid; however, transgenic mice devoid of ACE2, which binds 
the  SARS-CoV2  spike  protein,  uptake  less  tryptophan  from  the  gut 
compared  to  their  wild-type  controls  (Schwarcz,  2016;  Singer  et  al., 
2012) and exhibit significantly lower levels of serotonin in blood and 
brain (Klempin et al., 2018), implicating ACE2 as modulator in seroto-
nin  synthesis.  The  dopamine  synthetic  pathway  also  engages  ACE2 
mechanisms 
(Attademo  and  Bernardini,  2021).  Employing  a 
multi-experiment matrix  web tool that utilizes  microarray  datasets to 
merge information from different datasets and mine for co-expression, 
dopa decarboxylase (DDC), an enzyme which converts l-3,4-dihydrox-
yphenylalanine  (L-DOPA)  into  dopamine  and  l-5-hydroxytryptophan 
into serotonin, exhibits the highest statistically significant co-expression 
link  with  ACE2  (Nataf,  2020).  These  findings  suggest  an  association 
between ACE2 function and dopamine/serotonin synthesis by DDC. 

Kynurenic acid, a product of L-tryptophan metabolism, also inhibits 
dopamine release and reduces extracellular dopamine levels in the rat 
striatum (Borland and Michael, 2004; Wu et al., 2007). This is in part 
through kynurenic acid-induced antagonism of glutamate receptors and 
therefore kynurenic acid is also considered a major regulator of gluta-
matergic activity in the CNS strongly linking the kynurenine pathway to 
glutamate imbalance (Borland and Michael, 2004; Meier et al., 2016). 
Alleviating kynurenic acid accumulation in the CNS is thought to posi-
tively impact mental health (Wu et al., 2007). Although kynurenine, or 
its pathway metabolites have not been measured in the CNS of Covid-19 
patients, cumulatively, these finding suggest the potential importance of 
ACE2-kynurenine interactions with serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate 
systems in normal brain function, and implicates kynurenine dysregu-
lation in the neuropsychiatric and neurological consequences associated 
with Covid-19. 

3.2. 3.2 The immune-kynurenine pathway 

The  bidirectional  relationship  between  innate  immunity  and  the 
kynurenine  pathway  provides  further  evidence  for  the  potential  pro-
gression  of  neuropsychiatric  disorders  during  and  following  recovery 
from  Covid-19.  For  example,  immune  signaling,  like  that  induced  by 
Covid-19, impacts downstream metabolism of the kynurenine pathway, 

Neuropharmacology198(2021)1087664I.E. Cisneros and K.A. Cunningham                                                                                                                                                                                                         

Schematic 2. SARS-CoV2 host factors and inflammation in the regulation serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate. We propose that SARS-CoV2 may activate 
host factors and increase peripheral levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines with the potential to reduce tryptophan and serotonin functionality while 
kynurenine  is  increased  in  Covid-19  patients.  With  increased  IDO  activity  upon  Covid-19-evoked  inflammation,  tryptophan  metabolism  may  be  diverted  from 
maintaining serotonin function into increased levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid. Given that kynurenic acid antagonizes glutamate receptors and increases 
glutamate concentrations, excitotoxicity may become a challenge. Kynurenic acid also inhibits dopamine release thereby reducing dopamine levels in the brain. 

including quinolinic and kynurenic acid and the neurotransmitters se-
rotonin,  dopamine,  and  glutamate  (Bonaccorso  et  al.,  2002;  Capuron 
and Miller, 2011; Maes et al., 2002). Inflammation stimulates the ac-
tivity  and  expression  of  the  enzyme  indoleamine  dioxygenase  (IDO) 
which metabolizes tryptophan to kynurenine rather than to serotonin 
(Badawy,  2017;  Kiank  et  al.,  2010;  O’Connor  et  al.,  2009;  Yisireyili 
et  al.,  2018),  decreasing  the  availability  of  the  primary  amino  acid 
precursor for the synthesis of serotonin, setting the stage for the disor-
ders  mediated  by  the  serotonin  system,  including  the  cascade  into 
depression which is resistant to treatment with selective serotonin re-
uptake  inhibitors  (for  review)  (Roman  and  Irwin,  2020).  Preclinical 
studies  demonstrate  that  a  lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)  challenge  which 
activates  the  immune  system,  increases  IDO  activity  and  expression 
(Dobos et al., 2012) which likely activates the metabolism of L-trypto-
phan to kynurenine, initiating an excitotoxic imbalance, based on the 
strong  link  of  kynurenine  to  glutamate  dysregulation  (Borland  and 
Michael, 2004; Meier et al., 2016). Decreased levels of tryptophan and 
serotonin and increased levels of kynurenine were correlated to levels of 
IL-6 in Covid-19 patients and associated inflammation (Thomas et al., 
2020). Similarly, several studies observed reduced levels of tryptophan 

and  serotonin  and  elevated  levels  of  L-kynurenine  in  serum  collected 
from Covid-19 patients (Shen et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2020), likely 
via  increased  IDO  activity  dictated  by  inflammatory  cytokines  and 
chemokines  generated  during  infection  with  SARS-CoV2.  In  line with 
these  studies,  patients  suffering  from  HCV-induced  cognitive  impair-
ments,  have  increased  IDO  expression  in  liver  and  peripheral  mono-
cytes,  and  increased  blood  levels  of  kynurenine  that  correlate  to 
cognitive dysfunction (Larrea et al., 2007; Schulz et al., 2015; Weinstein 
et al., 2019). Moreover, patients suffering from HIV-associated dementia 
had  increased  IDO  activity  when  compared  to  HIV  patients  without 
dementia  (Sardar  and  Reynolds,  1995).  In  preclinical  studies,  HIV 
significantly  increase  extracellular  glutamate  concentrations  in  an  in 
vitro astrocyte model that corresponds to clinical studies demonstrating 
increased excitotoxicity in patients suffering from HIV-associated neu-
rocognitive  disorders  (Cisneros  and  Ghorpade,  2014;  Cisneros  et  al., 
2020; Fields et al., 2013). Although, IDO levels and activity have not 
been measured in Covid-19 patients, it is likely that triggering of the 
immune system by SARS-CoV2 increases IDO activity and kynurenine 
levels thereby decreasing serotonin and dopamine levels and increasing 
glutamate  excitotoxicity  in  Covid-19.  Thus,  dysregulation  of  the  host

factor ACE2, inflammation, and altered synthesis and levels of seroto-
nin,  dopamine,  and  glutamate  via  the  kynurenine  pathway,  during 
Covid-19 is strongly related to neurological sequalae (Schematic 2). 

4. Inflammation in SUDs 

Glutamate,  dopamine,  and  serotonin  crosstalk  with  the  immune 
system  and  maladaptive  changes  induced  by  inflammation  may 
certainly contribute to increased vulnerability to SUDs, although direct 
and  clear  experimental  designs  for  definitive  studies  are  difficult  to 
develop. For instance, TNF-α  and IL-1β, classical proinflammatory cy-
tokines, inhibit glutamate uptake in astrocytes and increase ionotropic 
glutamate receptor expression at the synapse (Cisneros and Ghorpade, 
2012,  2014;  Cisneros  et  al.,  2020;  Olmos  and  Llad´o,  2014;  Pickering 
et al., 2005) and activating glutamate transporters in glial cells reduces 
cocaine and methamphetamine induced CPP and significantly decreases 
cocaine  self-administration  (Nakagawa  et  al.,  2005;  Northcutt  et  al., 
2015). Reduced clearance and increased levels of synaptic glutamate is a 
central  mechanism  underlying  SUD  pathophysiology  and  associated 
cocaine-  and  heroin-seeking  behaviors.  In  vitro,  in  vivo,  and  ex  vivo 
studies  demonstrate  that  proinflammatory  cytokines,  including  IL-1β, 
TNF-α,  and  downstream  signaling  pathways  that 
include  p38 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B 

(NF-κB)  can  modulate  the  functional  activity  of  serotonin,  which  is 
involved in the transition to compulsive drug use behaviors (Bubar and 
Cunningham,  2006;  Cunningham  and  Anastasio,  2014;  Howell  and 
Cunningham, 2015; Müller and Homberg, 2015; Nic Dhonnchadha and 
Cunningham, 2008; Schwamborn et al., 2016; Steiner et al., 2008; Walsh 
and  Cunningham,  1997;  Zhu  et  al.,  2010).  Chronic  inflammation  is 
characterized to decrease dopamine levels in the CNS which aligns with 
a  similar  observation  for  chronic  drug  use  (Lacagnina  et  al.,  2017; 
Treadway et al., 2019), supporting the interactive relationship between 
these  system  in  control  of  SUD  behaviors  and  implications  for  CNS 
mechanisms underlying drug reward (Di Chiara, 2002). 

Substances  of  abuse  additionally  dysregulate  immune  signaling 
driving  the  complexity  associated  with  understanding  maladaptive 
changes that increase vulnerability to SUDs. Although both TNF-α and 
IL-1β, cytokines that modulate the activity of serotonin, dopamine, and 
glutamate, are canonically increased during viral infections, such as HIV 
(Chivero  et  al.,  2017;  Vartak-Sharma  et  al.,  2014)  and  Covid-19 
(McElvaney et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020), substances of abuse can 
also regulate activity of these cyokines. For instance, inflammatory cy-
tokines and chemokines are increased and decreased following exposure 
to cocaine (Atluri et al., 2016; Kovalevich et al., 2015; Montesinos et al., 
2020; Souza et al., 2021), methamphetamine (Karimi-Haghighi et al., 
2020; Kays and Yamamoto, 2019; Wang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020b) 

Neuropharmacology198(2021)1087666I.E. Cisneros and K.A. Cunningham                                                                                                                                                                                                         

and/or alcohol (Barr et al., 2016; Crews et al., 2006) and dysregulated 
following opioid exposure (Cisneros and Cunningham, 2021; Ezeomah 
et al., 2020). For example, we demonstrated increased and decreased 
inflammation in the nucleus accumbens relative to the hippocampus in 
rats withdrawn from chronic self-administration of the opioid fentanyl; 
these  outcomes  positively  correlated  to  expression  of  specific  host 
pattern recognition receptors that trigger inflammatory cascades (Cis-
neros and Cunningham, 2021; Ezeomah et al., 2020). An unanswered 
question remains as to the impact of such drug-induced inflammatory 
changes  to  perpetuate  fentanyl  self-administration;  if  this  is  the  case, 
there  may  be  the  potential  anti-inflammatory  therapeutics  to  help 
mitigate continuing opioid abuse. For instance, opiate antagonists which 
are used to treat alcohol and opiate use disorders also block induction of 
innate  immune  cytokine  and  chemokine  generation,  and  prevent 
LPS-induced  immune  responses  (Liu  et  al.,  2000a,  2000b).  Perhaps, 
prevention  of  inflammatory  cytokine  and  chemokine  cascades  may 
reduce alcohol and opiate use. Although statistical significance was not 
achieved, the TNF-α inhibitor pentoxifylline tended to decrease cocaine 
use  in  clinical  studies  conducted  in  cocaine-dependent  individuals 
relative  to  placebo  (Ciraulo  et  al.,  2005).  Further  studies  are  also 
required  to  evaluate  whether  the  immune-kynurenine  pathway  is 
directly involved in mediating inflammation evoked by cocaine or other 
abused  drugs.  Based  on  the  evidence  presented,  we  speculate  that 
inflammation-induced  dysregulation  of  serotonin,  dopamine  and 
glutamate  may  trigger  interacting  aspects  of  underlying  the  patho-
physiology of SUDs and compulsive drug-seeking behaviors (Koob et al., 
2014; Koob and Volkow, 2016). Taken together, inflammation and its 
relationship to this pathophysiology of SUD development and mainte-
nance is undoubtedly complex and worthy of further investigation. 

5. Conclusion: Covid-19 and SUD vulnerability 

SARS-CoV2,  the virus  that causes Covid-19,  activates the host  im-
mune system, thereby impacting the onset of neurological sequelae. The 
severity of neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive symptoms of Covid-19 
are directly associated with the levels of circulating inflammatory cy-
tokines  and  chemokines  (Huang  et  al.,  2020a;  Ludlow  et  al.,  2016). 
Based  on  the  evidence  presented  in  this  review,  we  suspect  that 
inflammation  in  the  CNS,  initiated  by  host  immune  responses  to 
SARS-CoV2, results in dysregulation in tryptophan metabolism, dually 
triggered  by  IDO  activity  and  ACE2  functionality.  Increased  levels  of 
peripheral kynurenine and CNS kynurenic acid are predicted to desta-
bilize  normal  serotonin,  dopamine  and  glutamate  function  vital  for 
normal  brain  functioning.  Alterations  in  these  neurotransmitters  are 
strongly related to drug use and misuse and the vulnerability to develop 
SUD (Schematic 3). More research is needed to further dissect (1) the 
CNS inflammatory response to Covid-19; (2) the causal relationship of 
the immune-kynurenine pathway with Covid-19 neurological sequalae; 
(3)  the  impact  of  Covid-19-related  inflammation  on  IDO  activity  and 
interruption of serotonin, dopamine and glutamate metabolism; (4) the 
role of Covid-19 CNS inflammation in the evolution of drug misuse and 
SUD; and (5) the regulation of CNS-expressed Covid-19 host factors (e. 
g.,  ACE2,  TMPRSS2/3,  CTSL,  NRP-1,  TPCN2)  following  exposure  to 
drugs of abuse and how impaired host factors contribute to sustained 
clinical challenges during recovery. In summary, as the research field 
continues to explore these questions and the Covid-19 pandemic con-
tinues, we hope that gains in knowledge will frame the means through 
which we can mitigate suffering of those co-morbid for SUDs and the 
sequela  of  Covid-19.  The  identification  of  specific  targets  related  to 
SARS-CoV2-induced  inflammation  may  help  guide  novel  therapeutics 
approaches to alleviate the future SUD burdens.
