ABSTRACT
Background: Women prescribed adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) for nonmetastatic breast cancer may experience a decline
in positive psychological well‐being (PPWB) and self‐efficacy. Brief cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and relaxation training
(RT) interventions have shown short‐term efficacy in reducing distress, but their impact on PPWB and self‐efficacy over longer
periods among women prescribed AET is unknown.
Aims: We aimed to investigate longitudinal effects of CBT and RT on PPWB and self‐efficacy among women prescribed AET.
Methods: This secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing 5‐session CBT versus RT versus a time‐matched
health education (HE) control for women with nonmetastatic breast cancer examined PPWB (positive affect, benefit finding,
positive states of mind, optimism), coping self‐efficacy, and relaxation self‐efficacy at four timepoints over the first‐year post‐
diagnosis and at median 8‐year follow‐up. Piecewise hierarchical linear modeling tested intervention effects on longitudinal
trajectories among women prescribed AET from the parent study (N = 135).
Results: Over the first‐year post‐surgery, positive affect and relaxation self‐efficacy increased across all conditions (ps < 0.03).
Women in CBT reported enhanced positive states of mind compared to those in HE (p = 0.044) and enhanced coping self‐
efficacy versus those in RT (p = 0.029). Women in HE reported enhanced coping self‐efficacy versus those in RT
(p = 0.043). All intervention effects persisted at 8‐year follow‐up. There were no significant effects on optimism or benefit
finding.

OPEN ACCESSConclusions: Brief interventions may bolster aspects of PPWB and self‐efficacy in women prescribed AET. Testing is warranted
to determine whether more PPWB components can be incorporated into these interventions to further enhance outcomes.

1 | Background

In the United States, one in 8 women will be diagnosed with a
breast cancer in their lifetime [1]. A breast cancer diagnosis
triggers a series of stressors throughout the cancer care contin-
uum, from initial surgery and adjuvant treatment through long‐
term monitoring and survivorship [2, 3]. These challenges can
be prolonged for the approximately 75% of patients with hormone
receptor positive (HRþ) disease [1], who are prescribed adjuvant
endocrine therapy (AET) daily for up to 5–10 years. While AET
(i.e., Tamoxifen, Aromatase Inhibitor) can reduce rates of recur-
rence by up to 50% [4], it comes with significant side effects [5–7],
including menopausal‐related symptoms (e.g., hot flashes,
musculoskeletal pain) and mood changes (e.g., depression) [5–7],,
which may interfere with adherence. In fact, nearly half of women
do not complete the recommended course of AET [8]. Non‐
in-
psychosocial
pharmacological
terventions, may be helpful for managing these effects [9].

strategies,

including

Cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) is a 10‐session,
group‐based intervention designed to reduce distress associated
with breast cancer diagnosis and treatment [10]. CBSM has been
shown to reduce distress among women with nonmetastatic
breast cancer with multiple phenotypes [11, 12], with sustained
effects years into survivorship [13]. However, the effects of
CBSM were not
tested specifically among women with
HR þ breast cancer. To enhance patient accessibility and scal-
ability, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to
test brief versions of CBSM components for women with newly
diagnosed nonmetastatic breast cancer [14]. This three‐armed,
dismantling trial tested two intervention conditions—cognitive‐
behavioral therapy (CBT) and relaxation training (RT)—against
an attention‐matched health education (HE) control condition,
all of which were delivered via five weekly in‐person group
sessions. Initial results showed immediate pre‐post intervention
improvements in factors related to psychosocial distress in both
the CBT and RT intervention groups compared to those in the
HE control group [14]. Women in the intervention groups also
reported specific benefits related to stress management re-
sources, with women in the CBT condition reporting more
reliable social support networks and women in the RT group
reporting increased confidence in relaxation skills immediately
post‐intervention [14]. It is yet to be determined whether this
brief intervention has efficacy in women with HR þ breast
cancer on AET.

While promising, these initial findings are limited in duration
and scope. Further research is needed to determine whether
brief intervention effects can be sustained in the long‐term as
patients continue into survivorship, as has been demonstrated
following more time‐intensive interventions [13, 15–17]. More-
over, results focus largely on intervention effects on negative
psychosocial sequelae, a primary focus of most intervention
studies among women with breast cancer,
including those
prescribed AET [18, 19]. Less is known about brief psychosocial
intervention impacts on positive psychological well‐being

(PPWB),
including positive affect, benefit finding, positive
states of mind, and optimism, among women with breast can-
cer. This is a notable gap in the literature given that PPWB has
been linked to reduced morbidity/mortality [20–22] and
improved medication adherence in other disease groups
[23, 24].

The Broaden and Build theory of positive emotions [25] posits
that PPWB broadens one's mindset in ways that accumulate and
compound cognitive (e.g., enhanced focused attention), psy-
chological (e.g., positive coping), and social (e.g., social inte-
gration) resources, which may be used to “buffer” the effects of
stress. The Upward Spiral Theory expands upon this idea to
describe how positive psychological adaptation may enhance
health behaviors in the long‐term: as positive psychological
phenomena occur in tandem with health behaviors, the moti-
vation to repeat the behavior grows stronger, and this habit is
strengthened by the broadened resources gained from the pos-
itive psychological experiences that help overcome perceived
barriers [25, 26]. Stress management interventions like CBSM
teach key skills to increase stress management resources, such
as coping and relaxation, offering vast potential for enhanced
PPWB. Women who feel more capable of coping with stressors
and engaging in relaxation may overcome perceived barriers to
achieving PPWB (e.g., greater positive affect; optimism), which
in turn may enhance perceived coping and relaxation.
Enhanced coping self‐efficacy may also contribute to positive
health behaviors in this population. In an RCT testing a tele-
health intervention for symptom management, distress, and
adherence to AET [18] coping self‐efficacy “buffered” the effect
of distress on poor AET adherence [27].

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of two brief
stress management interventions—CBT and RT—versus HE
control on (1) PPWB, and (2) coping and relaxation self‐efficacy,
among women with HR þ disease who were prescribed AET at
baseline. We assessed intervention effects across two time
frames: (1) from post‐diagnosis (pre‐intervention) to 1‐year post‐
intervention, and (2) from 1‐year post‐intervention to 8 years
post‐intervention. We chose to collect long‐term follow‐up at
8 years post‐intervention to be consistent with past literature in
breast oncology demonstrating lasting effects of a psychosocial
intervention of at least 8 years [15, 16].We hypothesized that
compared to women in the HE control condition, women in
both CBT and RT interventions would report enhanced PPWB,
coping self‐efficacy, and relaxation self‐efficacy across the first‐
year post‐diagnosis and that effects would be maintained
across long‐term survivorship.

2 | Methods

2.1 | Participants

The parent trial (NCT02103387) included both hormone re-
ceptor positive and negative cases and was approved by the

University of Miami Institutional Review Board. All women
who enrolled in the study completed informed consent pro-
cedures. The parent trial recruited women from cancer clinics
in South Florida ages 21 years or older with nonmetastatic
breast cancer who were 2–10 weeks post‐surgery who had not
yet begun adjuvant/neo‐adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation.
Exclusion criteria from the parent trial included a prior can-
treatment, severe psychiatric
cer diagnosis or neoadjuvant
illness, acute or chronic medical conditions
that would
interfere with study participations, or lack of fluency in En-
glish [14]. Of 739 women screened, 298 did not meet eligi-
bility criteria, and an additional 247 declined participation
due to a lack of time, transportation concerns, or lack of
interest. A total of 194 women gave consent, with 11 with-
drawing prior to randomization. Of the 183 women random-
ized, 135 (73.4%) were prescribed AET for hormone receptor‐
positive (HRþ) disease and were included in the current
study (Figure 1). Further details of the parent trial have been
published elsewhere [14].

2.2 | Procedures

Women completed psychosocial questionnaires at baseline prior
to randomization. Study staff collected medical and de-
mographic data via self‐report and verified these characteristics
through medical record review. Women completed psychosocial
questionnaires at baseline (T1), and then were randomized and
scheduled to receive one of the three five‐session interventions.

Following the final session of their respective intervention
(approximately 2 months post‐baseline) women completed an
additional psychosocial questionnaire (T2). Women completed
follow‐up questionnaires at 6‐month post‐baseline (T3), and 12‐
month post‐baseline (T4). We conducted a long‐term follow‐up
assessment using self‐report measures (median 8‐year; range 7–
11‐year post‐baseline; T5) on women from the parent trial who
were prescribed AET, which included completion of patient‐
reported psychosocial questionnaires. All measures were
administered via paper surveys.

2.3 | Study Conditions

Women in each study condition met once per week over
5 weeks for 90 min. Sessions were conducted in groups ranging
in size from 3‐7 participants and were led by one group facili-
tator. Facilitators were pre‐doctoral clinical psychology students
(n = 6) who each completed protocol training on each inter-
vention arm with a licensed psychologist. Fidelity was moni-
tored by two licensed psychologists who viewed the videotaped
sessions for all three study conditions, and drift was minimized
by weekly supervision with interventionists to provide feedback
on competence and adherence to protocol.

There was no significant difference in session attendance across
the three different intervention conditions (F(2, 98) = 1.87,
p = 0.25), with high overall attendance (median = 4 sessions
completed).

2.3.2 | Relaxation Training (RT)

The RT intervention, derived from the 10‐week CBSM inter-
vention [10], taught relaxation techniques through weekly in‐
including deep diaphragmatic breathing,
session exercises,
progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and mindfulness
meditation. In addition to in‐session practice and discussion,
audio recordings of the exercises were provided for at‐home
practice.

2.3.3 | Health Education (HE)

The HE condition served as the time‐ and attention‐matched
control consisting of educational
information related to a
breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, including available re-
sources, symptom management, and healthy lifestyle choices.

2.4 | Measures

The following psychosocial constructs were measured at five
timepoints spanning approximately 8 years: baseline (N = 135),
2 months (n = 101), 6 months (n = 96), 12 months (n = 101),
and 8 years (n = 59). Average reliability across all timepoints for
each measure is listed below.

2.4.1 | Positive Psychological Well‐Being

2.4.1.1 | Positive Affect. Positive affect was measured us-
ing the Affect Balance Scale [28]. The Affect Balance Scale is a
40‐item scale measuring various aspects of positive and negative
affect. The positive affect subscale was calculated by taking the
mean of the 20 items addressing positive affect; higher scores
indicate more positive affect. Reliability was high in this
sample (average Cronbach's alpha > 0.90).

2.4.1.2 | Benefit Finding. The Benefit Finding Scale (BFS)
was used to assess benefit finding, or an individual's ability to
identify positive outcomes resulting from a negative event (i.e.,
breast cancer diagnosis and treatment) [29]. On the BFS, 17
items assessing the degree to which respondents perceived
benefits across various domains (e.g., family, social relations, life
priorities, or ability to accept circumstances) with 5‐point Likert
scale response options ranging from Not at all (1) to Extremely
(5). A total score was calculated for all 17 items; higher total
scores indicate a greater degree of benefit finding. Reliability

2.4.1.3 | Optimism. Generalized optimism was assessed
using the Life Orientation Test‐Revised (LOT‐R) [30]. The LOT‐
R consists of six coded items (three of which are reverse‐scored)
that are summed to calculate an overall optimism score, with
higher scores indicating greater levels of optimism. Reliability
was adequate (average Cronbach's alpha > 0.80).

2.4.1.4 | Positive States of Mind. The Positive States of
Mind (PSOM) [31] is a 7‐item scale that measures women's
perceived ability to achieve positive experiences that may be
perceived as difficult in the context of cancer diagnosis and
including focused attention, productivity, restful
treatment,
repose,
sexual pleasure, and sensuous
nonsexual pleasure. Items are summed to calculate a total
score, with higher scores indicating a greater frequency and
intensity of positive emotional and cognitive experiences.
Reliability was adequate (average Cronbach's alpha > 0.85).

2.4.2.1 | Coping
and Relaxation Self‐
Efficacy. The Measure of Current Status (MOCS) ‐ Relaxa-
tion and Coping subscales [32] were used to measure self‐
efficacy specific to skills
targeted in the RT and CBT
interventions, respectively. Participants were asked to rate
their current perceived ability to relax and cope with stressors
generally (the MOCS is not specific to coping with cancer‐
related stressors). Responses on items within each subscale
are averaged to calculate the subscale score, with higher
scores indicating a higher degree of self‐efficacy. The internal
consistency of the MOCS subscales were adequate (average
Cronbach's alpha > 0.80).

2.4.3 | Covariates

Covariates for analyses included age at diagnosis, non‐invasive
versus invasive disease (stage 0 vs stage I‐III breast cancer),
household income, chemotherapy receipt (yes/no), radiation
receipt (yes/no), and Hispanic ethnicity (yes/no). We deter-
mined covariates based on their relationship with both disease
outcomes and behavioral and psychological constructs and
those used in prior trials of stress management interventions in
breast cancer [14, 33, 34].

2.5 | Analytic Plan

We initially screened data for outliers, normality, and homosce-
dasticity. Participants from the parent trial with HR þ disease
were included in analyses (N = 135). For all analyses, p < 0.05 was
considered an indicator of statistical significance, and p < 0.10
indicated marginal significance.

We used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to examine the

adaptation over time. We used RStudio to estimate all hierar-
chical linear models [35]. These models were estimated using
restricted maximum likelihood (REML), which allows for the
inclusion of participants with partially missing data under the
assumption that data are missing at random (MAR). This
approach uses all available data points at each time point
without listwise deletion, providing unbiased estimates when
the MAR assumption holds. HLM differs from traditional lon-
gitudinal analyses as it accounts for the non‐independence of
the data and does not assume equal number of observations and
utilizes all available data, making it an ideal method for long‐
term follow‐up analysis with anticipated attrition [34]. A
piecewise modeling approach was adopted with a knot at the 12‐
month timepoint to model both the trajectory over four time-
points in the first‐year post‐diagnosis (T1‐T4) and the trajectory
of long‐term survivorship from 12‐month follow‐up to 8‐year
follow‐up (T4‐T5) and to determine the differential impact of
study condition on trajectories across different periods along the
cancer care continuum. In the case of a significant cross‐level
interaction (time*condition) Cohen's f 2 effect size was calcu-
lated as a measure of practical significance, such that f 2 ≥ 0.02
indicated a small effect size, f 2 ≥ 0.15 indicated a medium effect
size, and f 2 ≥ 0.35 indicated a large effect size [36]. Appendix S1
offers detailed information regarding model building for each
outcome.

3.1 | Descriptive Statistics

Women (N = 135) were on average 54.8 years old (SD = 10.19;
range 28–80), had invasive disease (88.9%), received radiation
(50.4%) and/or chemotherapy (35.6%), and predominately
identified as Hispanic (42.2%) or non‐Hispanic White (41.5%)
(Table 1).

Intervention Effects on Positive

Psychological Well‐Being

3.2.1 | Positive Affect

There was a significant main effect of time during the first‐year
post‐diagnosis (B (SE) = 0.18 (0.07), p = 0.023), with positive
affect increasing. This trajectory did not persist into the long‐
term survivorship period indicating changes were maintained
(i.e., did not regress) in the long‐term. There were no significant
cross‐level interactions of CBT versus HE, RT versus HE, or CBT
versus RT on positive affect in the first‐year post‐diagnosis or
during long‐term survivorship (Supporting Information S2: Ta-
ble 1).

3.2.2 | Benefit Finding

There was a marginally significant main effect of time during
the first‐year post‐diagnosis (B (SE) = 0.32 (0.17), p = 0.054),
with benefit finding increasing. This trend did not persist into
the long‐term survivorship period. There were no significant

cross‐level interactions of CBT versus HE, RT versus HE, or CBT
versus RT in the first‐year post‐diagnosis or during long‐term
survivorship (Supporting Information S2: Table 2).

3.2.3 | Optimism

There was no significant main effect of time in the first‐year
post‐diagnosis or during survivorship. There were no signifi-
cant cross‐level interactions of CBT versus HE, RT versus HE, or
CBT versus RT in the first‐year post‐diagnosis or during long‐
term survivorship (Supporting Information S2: Table 3).

3.2.4 | Positive States of Mind

There was a significant main effect of time in the first‐year post‐
diagnosis (B (SE) = 1.50 (0.39), p < 0.001), with PSOM
increasing. This trajectory did not continue in the long‐term. In
line with hypotheses, there was a significant cross‐level inter-
action of CBT condition by time during the first‐year post‐
diagnosis as compared to the HE condition (B (SE) = 1.38 (0.68),
p = 0.044), which was a medium effect size (f 2 = 0.15)
(Figure 2). Simple slope analyses demonstrated that the effect of
time in the first‐year post‐diagnosis on PSOM was greater
among women who received CBT (b = 3.36) as compared to
those who received HE (b = 1.98). However, this effect was
unique to the CBT versus HE contrast: there were no differences
between RT and either HE or CBT on the trajectory of PSOM
during this period. In addition, there were no significant cross‐
level
indicating
benefits were maintained (i.e., did not regress) in the long‐term
(Supporting Information S2: Table 4).

3.3.1 | Coping Self‐Efficacy

There was a marginally significant main effect of time during
the first‐year post‐diagnosis (B (SE) = 0.17 (0.10), p = 0.069),
with coping self‐efficacy increasing. This trend did not persist
into the long term. There was a significant interaction of the
CBT condition with time during the first‐year post‐diagnosis,
compared to the RT condition (B (SE) = −0.31 (0.14), p = 0.029),
which was a medium effect size (f 2 = −0.17). A similar inter-
action between RT and HE was observed (B (SE) = −0.28 (0.04),
p = 0.043), which was a medium effect size (f 2 = −0.15)
(Figure 3). Simple slope analyses showed that the effect of time
in the first‐year post‐diagnosis on coping self‐efficacy was pos-
itive for women who received CBT (b = 0.10) and HE (0.17) but
negative for women who received RT (b = −0.11). There were
no differences between CBT and HE regarding the trajectory of
coping self‐efficacy during this period. Additionally, no signifi-
cant cross‐level interactions occurred during long‐term survi-
vorship, indicating benefits were maintained over the long term
(Supporting Information S2: Table 5).

3.3.2 | Relaxation Self‐Efficacy

There was a significant main effect of time during the first‐year
post‐diagnosis (B (SE) = 0.45 (0.14), p = 0.002), such that
women's perceived ability to relax increased. This trajectory did
not continue into the long‐term. There were no significant
cross‐level interactions of RT versus HE, CBT versus HE, or CBT
versus RT in the first‐year post‐diagnosis or during long‐term
survivorship (Supporting Information S2: Table 6).

4 | Discussion

Brief post‐surgical CBT was associated with enhanced positive
psychological well‐being during the first‐year post‐surgery in
women with HR þ breast cancer, as demonstrated by enhanced
positive states of mind (PSOM) compared to HE. In addition,
women assigned to CBT had enhanced coping self‐efficacy as

compared to those assigned to RT. By testing the ongoing tra-
jectories over 8 years, we demonstrated that these treatment
effects were maintained during long‐term survivorship. How-
ever, brief CBT was not associated with all measures of positive
psychological well‐being in this
there were no
intervention‐related improvements in positive affect, optimism,
or benefit finding. CBT also, as expected, was not associated
with relaxation self‐efficacy. However, across all three condi-
tions there was a significant main effect of time suggesting
improved relaxation self‐efficacy and positive affect during the
first‐year post‐diagnosis.

sample:

In this secondary analysis, we found an association between the
receipt of brief CBT and enhanced PSOM among women pre-
scribed AET, which persisted into long‐term survivorship.
While we were unable to explicitly test this hypothesis, CBT
may enhance PSOM via improved cognitive flexibility. For
it is plausible that women may learn to reframe

post‐diagnosis on PSOM was greater among women who received CBT (b = 3.36) as compared to those who received HE (b = 1.98). There were
no differences between CBT versus RT or RT versus HE during this period. There were no significant cross‐level interactions during long‐term
survivorship, indicating that intervention‐related effects were maintained (did not regress or grow stronger) over the long‐term.

unhelpful thought patterns (e.g., reframing a thought such as “I
cannot ever focus because of my breast cancer” to “I may have
cognitive side‐effects, but there are steps I can take to lessen the
severity”). This cognitive flexibility may bolster women's resil-
ience in the face of stressors that arise during the early stages of
survivorship and equip them to overcome stressors and achieve
positive experiences. Indeed, prior research has demonstrated
that greater PSOM may “buffer” the effects of stress on

depression [37] and may be related to higher medical compli-
ance in women with breast cancer [38]. Further research should
test cognitive flexibility as a mediator of the effects of CBT on
PSOM. It is also important to note that the PSOM assesses both
sexual and non‐sexual pleasure. Given the common sexual side
effects of AET [39], this may represent a particularly important
target of treatment to enhance well‐being and adherence in this
population.

In contrast to our hypotheses, women receiving RT did not
report longitudinal improvements in PPWB or self‐efficacy as
compared to the CBT or HE conditions. This was particularly
unexpected as this effect was found in the short‐term immedi-
ately post‐intervention [14]. It is possible that a more intensive
relaxation intervention (e.g., booster sessions, provision of a
mobile app to enhance relaxation practice) may be important to
sustain gains. Although there was no difference by intervention,
it is worth noting that there was a significant increase in both
relaxation self‐efficacy and positive affect across all three con-
ditions in the first‐year post‐diagnosis. These main effects of
time may be related to a “recovery” following the baseline (post‐
surgery) period in which positive moods and relaxation may be
more difficult to achieve. Further research is needed to clarify
whether this trajectory of improvement may naturally occur
following diagnosis and surgery or whether receipt of all three
interventions bolstered recovery in relaxation self‐efficacy and
positive affect.

It is important to acknowledge the apparent benefits associated
with the active HE control condition: women who received HE
reported enhanced coping self‐efficacy over the first‐year post‐
diagnosis as compared to women receiving RT, and these results
were maintained during the long‐term follow‐up period.
Although not provided with any CBT or RT intervention ma-
terial, women receiving HE participated in a supportive group
environment and received material on healthy living, potential
autonomy‐supportive experiences that contribute to psycholog-
ical well‐being according Self‐Determination Theory [40, 41].
Specifically, women may have experienced a greater sense of
control and ownership of their health management, particularly
related to managing AET, which in combination with peer
support may have contributed to sustained improvements in
coping self‐efficacy. Prior research supports the notion that
health education may impact well‐being in breast cancer. A
meta‐analysis including 27 trials demonstrated that health ed-
ucation reduces anxiety and enhances quality‐of‐life; however,
health education alone does not impact health behaviors [42].
Another trial of CBT for patients with incurable cancer utilized
a similar time‐ and attention‐matched health education control
and similarly found improvements in psychosocial functioning
across both intervention and control conditions with no signif-
icant difference between conditions [43]. Thus, there may be
some effect of a health education intervention on psychological
adaptation for patients undergoing cancer treatment.

Prior work among this cohort of women demonstrated that
receipt of RT was associated with enhanced self‐reported AET
adherence [33]. Given the null results of RT on our measures of
PPWB and self‐efficacy, we were unable to elucidate the
mechanisms by which RT may impact adherence. It is possible
that unmeasured factors in the current study contributed to this
relationship. For instance, the mindfulness module may have
enhanced acceptance of the present moment and of internal
experiences, thereby improving women's ability to cope with
somatic side effects and engagement in meaningful activities to
support AET adherence. Supporting this theory, prior work
found that RT was associated with decreased illness‐related
social disruption over the first‐year post‐surgery [44]. Given
that both low social engagement [45] and greater side‐effect
burden [46] are associated with worse AET adherence, these

factors represent additional mechanisms that may drive previ-
ously found adherence effects.

Contrary to hypotheses, brief CBT and RT interventions were
not associated with changes in benefit finding or optimism. As
this was a post‐hoc analysis, intervention materials did not
specifically target these constructs. In contrast, positive psy-
chological interventions (PPI) directly target these constructs
and involve topics such as life review and gratitude journaling,
which may enhance benefit finding [47]. Optimism, while
significantly related to both health outcomes and health be-
haviors [22, 48], may be a more difficult intervention target
given its trait‐like nature; however, recent PPI work within
oncology has shown promising effects on optimism [49]. Results
suggest the potential importance of incorporating positive psy-
chological activities to directly address and enhance PPWB in
this population.

Among covariates,
interesting effects arose with regard to
ethnicity and chemotherapy receipt. Specifically, Hispanic
women reported significantly greater benefit finding than non‐
Hispanic women. This is in line with prior research suggest-
ing that Hispanic women may be more likely to engage in
coping that involves benefit finding than non‐Hispanic women
with breast cancer [50]. It may be particularly important to
recognize and encourage this adaptive coping strategy among
Hispanic women with breast cancer. In addition, the receipt of
chemotherapy was associated with lower
relaxation self‐
efficacy. This is consistent with longitudinal data suggesting
that patients experience stable to decreasing levels of self‐
efficacy and emotional well‐being over the course of chemo-
therapy [51], suggesting that the difficult treatment and asso-
ciated side effects may erode confidence in utilizing relaxation
skills. Results suggest that patients receiving both AET and
chemotherapy may represent an important target population for
future studies.

4.1 | Limitations

likely due to recruitment

The current study is not without limitations. First, the current
sample is comprised of women from a high socioeconomic
bracket,
from private practice
oncology clinics in South Florida. Thus, results may not
generalize to populations of women with fewer socioeconomic
resources. In addition, there is significant missing data at long‐
term follow‐up, such that only 59 of 135 women completed the
final assessment. Although retention rates were similar to those
observed in previous long‐term follow‐up studies [16] and were
not unexpected due to mortality, morbidity, and loss to follow‐
up, attrition limited our ability to detect 8‐year effects and may
have biased our findings that gains during the primary treat-
ment period were maintained over the long‐term. Finally, it is
important to highlight that this was a secondary, post‐hoc
analysis of a prior trial using a convenience sample to
generate hypotheses for further testing. The post‐hoc nature of
this project precluded investigation into other important con-
structs related to PPWB (e.g., gratitude, life satisfaction) in this
population. While results suggest brief intervention may be
associated with some long‐term positive psychological effects,

8 of 11

Psycho‐Oncology, 2025

future fully powered studies should investigate the role of brief
interventions designed to directly modulate positive psycho-
logical well‐being and self‐efficacy among a more diverse sam-
ple of women prescribed AET.

4.2 | Clinical Implications

Women prescribed AET for HR þ breast cancer experience a
myriad of psychosocial concerns, including elevated levels of
physical and psychological side effects and difficulty adhering to
the medication [5–7]. Although AET is related to a reduction in
recurrence risk by up to 50% [4], nearly half of women do not
complete the recommended course of AET [8]. Positive psy-
chological well‐being and coping and relaxation self‐efficacy
represent modifiable constructs that may enhance both overall
well‐being and improve medication adherence among this at‐
risk population. Future a priori research is warranted to better
understand whether a brief intervention targeting these con-
structs may enhance well‐being and AET adherence.

5 | Conclusions

Brief CBT delivered in the post‐surgical period may improve
long‐term aspects of positive psychological well‐being (positive
states of mind) and coping self‐efficacy among women with
HR þ breast cancer prescribed AET. However, brief CBT and
RT interventions did not impact positive affect, optimism, or
benefit finding, PPWB constructs commonly associated with
improved health outcomes and health behaviors. Future work
may consider incorporating CBT skills along with evidence‐
based motivational
interviewing and positive psychological
skills [23, 47] to enhance well‐being, health behaviors, and
health outcomes in this population.
