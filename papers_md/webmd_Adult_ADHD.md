## What Is Adult ADHD?


Adult ADHD is a brain disorder in which you have trouble paying attention. You might also tend to act on impulse, or seem to have too much energy. About 4% to 5% of U.S. adults have ADHD, which stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Â

Every adult who hasADHD had it as a child. Some were diagnosed in childhood, but others only found out later in life. While manyÂ kids with ADHDÂ outgrow it, about 60% still have it as adults.Â

Thereâs no cure for ADHD. If your doctor says you have it, youâll work together to make atreatmentplan just for you.Â


## Adult ADHD Symptoms


When you haveÂadult ADHDyour symptoms can range from mild to serious and can change over time. They may affect you a lot, or they may not bother you much. They can be problems all of the time or just depend on the situation.

You may have issues with:

- Following directions

- Remembering information

- Organizing tasks

- Procrastination

- Controllinganger

- Low self-esteem

- Relationship problems

- Substance abuseÂ or addiction

- Talking too much

No two people with ADHD are exactly alike. You may be able to concentrate if youâre interested in or excited about what youâre doing. But some people withADHDhave trouble focusing under any circumstances.Â

Some people look for stimulation, but others avoid it. Plus, some people withADHDcan be withdrawn and antisocial. Others can be very social and go from one relationship to the next.


## Complications of Adult ADHD


If you have adult ADHD, you could have a long-term pattern of issues in many parts of your life. That might include:

Problems at schoolÂ

- A history of bad grades or repeating a grade

- Getting in trouble at school

Problems at work

- Frequent job changesÂ

- Poor work performance

- Unhappiness with your jobÂ

Problems in life

- Speeding tickets,car crashes, or having your license suspended

- Smoking or using alcohol or drugs

Relationship problems

- Unstable relationships

- A history of separation or divorce

- Multiple marriages


## Types of Adult ADHD


There are three maintypes of ADHD:

Inattentive ADHD.ÂWith this type,Âyour symptoms are mostly about being distracted and having trouble paying attention. You might be disorganized, often lose things, or have trouble following instructions. Doctors used to call thistypeADD.

Hyperactive/impulsive ADHD.ÂIf you have this type, most of your symptoms center on acting impulsively or being over-active. You might feelrestless, have a hard time sitting still, or talk a lot. You also may interrupt people or have a hard time waiting your turn.

Combined ADHD.ÂThis is the most common type of ADHD. If you have it, youÂhave some symptoms of both other types.Â


## Causes of Adult ADHD


Scientists aren't sure exactly whatcauses someone to get ADHD,Â but research has shown that it runs in families.Â

They do know that people with ADHD have differences in the way theirbrainsare structured. It takes their brains longer to become fully mature. The nerve cells that send and receive signals in thebrainwork differently, too.Â

Studies have found no evidence thatADHD is caused by:

- Sugar consumption

- Too much screen time

It's possible these things could make ADHD worse, though.


## Adult ADHD Risk FactorsÂ


You're at higherriskÂ for ADHDif you have a close relative, like a sibling or parent, with the condition. The odds are 1 in 4Â that a child with ADHD has a parent who also has it.

Researchers are looking at other possible risk factors, including:

- Alcohol use, smoking, or drug use duringpregnancy

- Exposure to toxic substances in the environment (such aslead) in the womb or during childhoodÂ

- Premature birth and low birth weight

Adult ADHD epidemiology

One large surveyÂ found that 4.4% of adults ages 18-44 in the U.S. have ADHD. About 62% are men and 38% are women, according to the survey. The ethnic group most likely to have a diagnosis of ADHD is non-Hispanic White people. The rate of ADHD among other groups is:Â

- 2.1% for Hispanic adults

- 1.9% for Black adults

- 3.6% for other ethnic groups (The survey did not further break down this category.)


## Adult ADHD Diagnosis


No test can diagnose ADHD. If you think you might have it, look for apsychiatristwho has experience with diagnosing and treating people with ADHD.

The doctor may:

- Ask you to get aÂ physical examÂ to make sure other medical problems aren't causing your symptoms

- Take someÂ bloodÂ from you and test it

- Recommend psychological testing

- Ask questions about your health history

While experts donât agree on an age when you can firstdiagnose ADHD, they do agree that people donât suddenly get it as adults. Thatâs why when a doctor sees you, they'll ask about your behavior and any symptoms you may have had as a child. They may also:

- Look at school report cards. Theyâll look for comments about behavior problems, poor focus, lack of effort, or underachievement compared to your potential.

- Talk with your parents to see if you had any symptoms duringchildhood.

The doctor will also ask whether anyone else in your family has ADHD.Â

## Adult ADHD TreatmentÂ


Treatment plans can include medicine, therapy, learning more about ADHD, and getting family support.

Together, these things can help you find new ways to do things that can make day-to-day life easier. That can make you feel better in general and feel better about yourself.

Making sure you get fully checked by a doctor is important. Thatâs because people with ADHD often face other conditions, too. You may also have aÂ learning disability, anxiety or anotherÂ mood disorder,Â obsessive-compulsive disorder, or a dependence on drugs oralcohol. Knowing the whole picture can make sure you get the best plan for you.

Medications for adult ADHD

Stimulants.Â Adults with ADHD are often prescribed stimulantmedications. Studies show that about two-thirds of adults with ADHD who take these medications have big improvements in their symptoms.

Examples ofstimulant medicationsinclude:

- Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (Adderall, Adderall XR)

- Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin)

- DextroamphetamineÂ (Dexedrine)

- LisdexamfetamineÂ (Vyvanse)

- MethylphenidateÂ (Concerta,Â Daytrana, Metadate, Methylin,Â Quillivant XR, Ritalin)

But stimulants aren't always ideal. Why? They can be:

- Addictive.ÂStimulants are controlled substances. That means they can be misused. Some adults with ADHD havesubstance abuseproblems or had them in the past.

- Hard to remember to take.Â Short-acting types of stimulants (versus long-acting) may wear off quickly. Since people with ADHD can have trouble with forgetfulness, remembering to take them several times a day can be a challenge.

- Hard to time.Â If people choose to stop taking them in the evening, they can have a hard time focusing to do housework, pay bills, help children with homework, or drive. But if they do take them later in the day, they may be tempted to use alcohol or other things "to relax."

Nonstimulants.Â Doctors may also recommend anonstimulant medicationfor you to take, either on its own or with a stimulant. They are:

- AtomoxetineÂ (Strattera)

- ClonidineÂ (Kapvay)

- GuanfacineÂ (Intuniv, Tenex)

- Viloxazine (Qelbree)

Therapy and other behavioral treatments

You may want to ask about making these part of your treatment plan, too:

- Cognitive and behavioral therapy.Â It can help with self-esteem.

- Relaxation training and stress management.Â These can loweranxietyandstress.

- Life coaching.Â It may help youÂ set goals. Plus, it can help you learn new ways to stay organized at home and work.

- Job coaching or mentoring.Â This can help support you at work. It can help you have better workingÂrelationshipsÂ and improve on-the-job performance.

- Family education and therapy.Â This can help you and loved ones understand ADHD better. It can also help you all find ways to lessen how much it affects everyoneâs life.

Alternative treatments for adult ADHD

Researchers haven't foundÂ much evidence that any alternative treatment can relieve symptoms of adult ADHD.Â

But some studies have shown that mindfulness meditation might boost your mood and help you pay attention. This type of meditation uses centering techniques, like guided imagery ordeep breathing, to help you relax your mind and body.

If you're considering analternative treatment, talk to your doctor first. They can help you weigh the benefits and drawbacks.Â

## Adult ADHD Health Disparities


It can be harder for adultsÂ to be diagnosed and treated for ADHD than it is for kids. Experts once thought children outgrew the condition, so many health care providers lack training about ADHD in adults. And because many with adult ADHD also have other conditions like depression oranxiety, those issues may overshadow ADHD symptoms.

Men make up 62% of adults with ADHD, while women make up 38%, according to one large survey. By comparison, boys are more than twice as likelyÂ asgirlsto be diagnosed with ADHD. Why does the gender gap narrow in adults? Some experts think it's because the inattentivesymptomsÂ thatwomentend to have don't go away as you get older. But hyperactive symptoms, which are more common in boys, often decrease.Â

One large, 10-year studyÂ found that White people, especially younger White men, were more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than those who are Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, or Pacific Islander. It's not clear whether this is because some groups are more likely to have the condition or seek care for it, or whetherdoctorstend to diagnose it more readily in certain groups.Â


## Living With Adult ADHD


When you haveÂ ADHD, even simple tasks likeÂ grocery shoppingÂ or paying bills can sometimes feel overwhelming. Anyone can havemood swings, loss of focus, and trouble staying organized, but you might deal with these each day if you haveÂ ADHD.

Your doctor can suggestÂ medicationÂ or other treatment to help you focus better, but there are things you can do on your own to make life with ADHD more manageable.

Adult ADHD diet

Doctors don't recommend any particular diet for adults with ADHD. But eating abalanced diethelps to protect your mental and physical health. Choose plenty of fruits and veggies along with whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.Â

Adult ADHD cost

Adult ADHD brings extra expenses in several area, such as medical costs and lost productivity. One study found that, on average, adults with ADHD spend an extra $2,500 a year on health care, including medications, doctor visits, and more. But untreated ADHD can be even more costly when it leads to things like traffic tickets, late payment fees, and impulse spending.Â

Managing adult ADHDÂ

These steps can help you lessensymptomsand deal with them when they arise:Â

- Take medications as directed.Â If you are taking anyÂ medications for ADHDÂ or any other condition, take them exactly as prescribed. Taking two doses at once to catch up on missed doses can be bad for you and others. If you notice side effects or other problems, talk to your doctor as soon as possible.

- Organize.Â Choose a time thatâs quiet and unhurried â maybe at night before you go to bed â and plan out the next day, down to each task. Make a realistic list of things to complete. Alternate things you want to do with ones you donât to help yourmindstay engaged. Use a daily planner, reminder app, timer, leave notes for yourself, and set your alarm clock when you need to remember an appointment or other activity.

- Be realistic about time:Â YourÂbrainÂ is wired differently than other peopleâs, and it may take you longer to get things done. Thatâs OK. Figure out a realistic time frame for your daily tasks â and donât forget to build in time for breaks if you think youâll need them.

- Breathe slowly.Â If you tend to do things you later regret, such as interrupt others or getangryat others, manage the impulse by pausing. Count to 10 while youbreathe slowlyinstead of acting out. Usually, the impulse will pass as quickly as it appeared.

- Cut down on distractions.Â When itâs time to buckle down and get something done, take away the distractions. If you find yourself being distracted by loud music or the television, turn it off or use earplugs or noise-canceling headphones to drown out sounds. Put yourphoneon silent. Move yourself to a quieter location, or ask others to help make things lessdistracting. If you can, work in a room with a door you can close. Set up your space in a way that helps youfocus.

- ControlÂ clutter. Another way to quiet yourÂ brainÂ is to clear your space of things you donât need. It can prevent distractions, and it can help you stay organized because youâll have fewer things to tidy up. Go paperless â take your name off junk mailing lists and pay bills online. Get some organizational helpers like under-the-bed containers or over-the-door holders. Ask a friend to help if it seems like youâre swimming in a sea ofdebrisand you donât know where to start.

- Burn off extra energy.ÂExerciseÂ is good for everyone, but it can do more than improve yourÂ heart healthÂ if you have ADHD. Even a little regularÂ exerciseÂ can easeÂ ADHD symptoms. You may need a way to get rid of some energy if youâre hyperactive or feel restless.Â Exercise, a hobby, or other pastimes can be good choices. Shoot for 20 to 30 minutes a day. If you work in an office, a brisk walk during lunch may be the ticket to beating yourÂ brainâs afternoon slump. After youexercise, youâll feel more focused and have more energy to stay on task.

- Learn to say no:ÂImpulsive behavior can be a side effect of havingÂ ADHD. This means yourÂ brainÂ might bite off more than it can handle. If you find yourself overwhelmed, try to say no to a few things. Ask yourself: Can I really get this done? Be honest with yourself and with others about whatâs possible and whatâs not. Once you get comfortable saying no, youâll be able to enjoy the things you say yes to even more.

- Reward yourself.ÂSticking to a task can be easier when thereâs amood boosterat the end. Before you tackle a project, decide on a reward for yourself once youâre done. Positive reinforcement can help you stay the course.

- Ask for help.Â We all need help from time to time, and it's important to not be afraid to ask for it. If you have disruptive thoughts or behaviors, ask a counselor if they have any ideas you can try that could help you control them.

Adult ADHD and stress

The problems in your everyday life that ADHD leads to can stress you out. In turn,stresscan make ADHD symptoms worse.

You may be able to reduce stressÂ withtime managementand organization methods that help keep you on task. Regular exercise can help you deal with the effects of stress. So can meditation and deep breathing techniques. If you feel overwhelmed by stress, talk to your doctor about the best ways to manage it.Â


## Adult ADHD Prognosis


If you have serious ADHD that goes untreated, you're at higher long-term risk for complications like:

- School, job, and relationship troubles

- Substance use disorders

- Othermental healthissues

But many people with ADHD learn how to manage theirsymptomsand reduce the condition's effect on their lives. Experts think that's why some children seem to "outgrow" ADHD.

Further, some of the brain differences that come with ADHD are positive ones. People with this condition may be more:

- Empathetic to others

- Innovative and creative

- Able to focus on things that really interest them

Can adult ADHD be cured?

Treatment can't cure ADHD, but it can help manage your symptoms. About 60% of adultsÂ who get treatment have fewer symptoms and a better quality of life.Â

What to expect with adult ADHD

If you had ADHD as a child, you may have fewerhyperactivesymptoms like restlessness when you reach adulthood. But you may still struggle with focus andimpulsive behavior.Â

Some symptoms may bother you less asÂ time goes on. But you might notice that your ADHD gets worse at times. That might happen when you go through life changes like a new job, the birth of a child, or menopause. Some research has found that ADHD symptoms get better once people pass age 60.


## Adult ADHD PreventionÂ


Since ADHD runs in families, you can't prevent it. Experts aren't sure what might raise your risk for the condition. But if you'repregnant, avoiding drugs, smoking, and alcohol could reduce the odds that your child will get ADHD and have other health problems later on.Â
