Introduction

The increase in the older adult population is no longer 

an exclusive phenomenon of globalized and developed 

nations, but also of developing countries, such as Brazil(1). 

In 2008, the population aged 65 and over represented 

6.53% of the total Brazilian population, with estimates 

of exceeding 22.71% by the year 2050. For the same

instrumental support. It relates to the life history and the 

context of the social organization. From this perspective, 

isolation does not refer to those who are voluntarily 

disconnected, but to those with possible barriers that 

hinder or prevent social integration.

Considering this scenario, it is necessary to recognize

actions to ensure aging with minimal impairment(1).

The magnitude of the phenomenon of population aging 

is increasing and influenced by different factors, being 

related to unequal and contradictory ways of aging, with 

social interaction as a marker for quality of life(3). The World 

Health Organization(4) warns that the non-inclusion of older

Accordingly,  new  technologies  have  been 

transforming communication practices in contemporary

factors are considered risk factors for the occurrence of 

loneliness and social isolation in older adults(6).

Loneliness can be defined as the cognitive perception 

that existing social relationships in life are insufficient or 

inadequate, generating an affective reaction of sadness 

and emptiness(7). In older adults, loneliness is related to 

inadequate social contact and low socioeconomic status, 

Social media can be described as places that “allow 

conversations”. They can be websites constructed to allow 

social interaction and the sharing of information in various 

formats: photos, messages, icons, among others. Their 

main characteristic is the active participation of the user

people who prefer to spend most of their time without 

the  company  of  other  people  and  with  a  reduced 

social network, without implying that they feel alone. 

This phenomenon is characterized as active isolation. 

Loneliness differs from these patterns, as it implies a 

discrepancy between personal preferences for social

their social roles, and exercise citizenship, autonomy and 

active participation in a complex society, which promotes 

the maintenance of a more active life(16). With a positive 

emphasis on friendly relationships and social integration,

In  this  way,  the  importance  of  investigating 

perspective  of  separation,  typically  physical,  from 

the  current  social  scenario  transformed  by  digital 

people, such as in those who live alone or live in isolated 

environments. In a review study(3), it was possible to 

identify a more general concept about social isolation in 

older adults, linked, in an objective way, to the scarcity 

of human relationships and regular contacts with people, 

whether they are family members, friends or members 

of the community In these cases, the person, in their 

technological changes and the inclusion of older adults 

is highlighted. Accordingly, the present study aimed to 

synthesize knowledge about the use of social media and

older adults. It is believed that the results of the study 

may provide support for planning interprofessional care,

the review/synthesis of knowledge(20).

In  the  first  step,  the  research  question  was 

elaborated,  using  the  PICO  strategy,  in  which  the 

population (P) refers to older adults, the intervention (I) to 

the use of social media, and the outcome (O) to loneliness 

and/or social isolation, which resulted in the following 

guiding question: “What is the available knowledge about 

the use of social media and the perception of loneliness 

and/or social isolation in older adults?”.

The  terms  were  identified  after  consulting  the 

Health Science Descriptors (DeCS) of the Virtual Health 

Library  and  the  Medical  Subject  Headings  (MeSH/

PubMed). The electronic databases consulted were: APA 

PsycNET (American Psychological Association Database), 

Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature 

(CINAHL), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health

Results 

Considering the results, it was possible to identify 

different types of technologies used in the studies. 

The results of this IR correspond to the analysis 

For a better understanding, these technologies were 

of the 11 scientific articles published, all in English. 

Regarding the databases, there was a greater number 

of articles published in journals indexed in the PubMed 

database (n=6), followed by PsycNET (n=2), CINAHL 

(n=2) and Web of Science (n=1). Considering the year 

of publication, two articles were published in 2015, one 

in 2017, two in 2018, five in 2019 and one in 2020. 

In relation to the research design, primary studies with 

quantitative (n=5), mixed methods (n=3) and qualitative 

(n=3) designs were identified. No primary national studies 

were identified that responded to the research question. 

The countries in which the studies were carried out were: 

United States of America (n=2), United Kingdom (n=2), 

China (n=2), Netherlands (n=1), Sweden (n=1), South 

Africa (n=1), India (n=1) and Canada (n=1).

In the evaluation of the articles, the quality of the 

studies was analyzed according to Figure 3. From the 

evaluation of the 11 articles, four presented partial 

results in the analysis of methodological rigor, two had 

a methodology that was partially adequate to obtain the 

results, one had a research design partially adequate 

divided into three categories, namely: “Internet use”, 

encompassing social networking sites, internet and 

applications, found in four (4) studies; “communication 

devices”, which covered information regarding the 

use  of  smartphones,  tablets  and  iPads,  with  four 

(4)  studies  included  in  this  category;  and  “types 

of  communication”  which  covered  the  means  of 

interpersonal communication in the digital age, such 

as video calls, emails and computer programs, with 

three (3) studies in this category. 

Seven studies (63.6%) included showed positive 

results  in  the  use  of  social  media  to  minimize  the 

perception of loneliness and/or social isolation of the older 

adults. The studies showed that a simplified approach 

and the prior training of the older adults in the use of 

information and communication technology (ICT) had 

positive results in terms of interaction with their family 

members, improved quality of life, access to information 

and greater social participation. Therefore, the results 

demonstrate that the use of social media has an impact 

for achieving the proposed objectives and one had a

To assess whether 
Information and 
Communication 
Technologies (ICTs), 
specifically, iPads, 
improved the lives of 
the older adults.

Quantitative study, carried 
out with 626 Dutch older 
adults. A formulated 
question was used to 
determine the use of 
social networks, as well 
as the instruments: 
Loneliness Scale and 
Mental Health Inventory. 
The questionnaires were 
applied online, and those 
older adults who did not 
have a personal computer 
or internet access, and 
who wanted to participate 
in the study, received 
equipment for data 
collection.

Quantitative study, carried 
out with 144 older adults 
in the United Kingdom. 
The intervention activities 
were carried out through 
individual sessions or in 
small groups with the aim 
of teaching how to use the 
internet. The instruments 
used were: Lubben Social 
Network Scale (LBNS-
6), De Jong Gierveld 
Loneliness Scale (DJG-
6), Warwick-Edinburgh 
Short Mental Well-Being 
Scale (SWEMWBS), 
Life Satisfaction Scale, 
Independence, using a 
question from the index of 
the measure Investigating 
Choice Experiments 
for the Preferences of 
Older People Capability 
measure (ICECAP) 
and questions from 
the Personal eHealth 
Readiness Questionnaire 
(PERQ).

Mixed methods 
study, carried out in a 
community center with 
19 older adults in 2014. 
Training sessions were 
offered in small groups, 
fortnightly. After the 
6-week training period, 
a new assessment 
was performed with 
demographic information, 
multiple-choice questions 
and open-ended 
questions.

A total of 56.2% (n=352) of 
the participants reported 
using social media several 
days a week. The use of 
social networking sites was 
not related to loneliness 
in general and emotional 
and social loneliness in 
particular, or to mental 
health. Older adults aged 
65 to 74 had lower levels 
of mental health compared 
to those aged 60 to 64. 
The number of medical 
conditions present was 
significantly related to lower 
levels of mental health.

The use of social media 
was not related to 
loneliness and mental 
health. There were no 
differences in levels of 
loneliness and/or mental 
health between users 
who had access to 
social media and those 
who did not.

The results showed that 
the number of contacts with 
other people increased from 
13.7 to 17.6; loneliness 
scores were reduced from 
2.38 to 1.80; and mental 
well-being improved from 
24.06 to 24.96. Participants 
valued better communication 
with family and friends and 
highlighted better health 
care with the use of the 
internet. Having the internet 
was valued less compared 
to having a TV, however, 
more than, for example, 
having a weekly visit from a 
cleaning lady.

The social networking 
of the participants 
increased, their 
loneliness decreased, 
and their mental well-
being improved after 
the intervention. Better 
communication with 
family and friends as 
a benefit of using the 
internet was ranked 
highest out of six 
aspects by the older 
adults, followed by 
being entertained or 
stimulated and feeling 
more confident related 
to their newly learned 
skills.

In the pre-test results, 13 
(68%) of the participants 
reported being unfamiliar 
with an iPad prior to training. 
In post-experience surveys, 
16 (90%) of the respondents 
rated their iPad use at a 
“medium to high” skill level.

The use of the 
technology increased 
knowledge, fostered 
closer family ties, and 
led to a greater overall 
connection to society.

3.Types of 
Communication

To identify barriers 
and facilitators for 
implementing video 
calls for older adults 
in care settings.

Mixed methods study. 
A randomized and 
controlled clinical trial 
was carried out with 300 
participants, 150 older 
adults in the Intervention 
Group - PRISM (IG) and 
150 older adults in the 
Control Group - Binder 
(CG), in three cities in 
the United States. The 
intervention involved the 
use of a special interface 
aimed at the older adult 
population (PRISM). It 
lasted 12 months, with 
assessments at baseline, 
6, and 12 months after 
randomization. The study 
population consisted 
of older adults who 
lived alone and were at 
risk of social isolation. 
The control group 
was called Binder and 
received only printed 
content. Instruments 
used: Friendship Scale, 
Loneliness Scale, 
Interpersonal Support 
Evaluation List, Lubben 
Social Network Index, 
Quality of Life Scale, 
Perceived Vulnerability 
Scale, and the SF-36. 
Longitudinal data on the 
impact of access to the 
PRISM system were also 
collected.

Qualitative study, with 
an action research 
approach. An intervention 
was carried out with 
the implementation of 
video calls, through a 
simple mobile device, 
with the name: Skype 
on Wheels (SoW). The 
project was carried 
out in hospitals and 
homes for older adults 
in the United Kingdom, 
with the participation 
of 8 older adults and 
8 family members, 
performing video 
calls. An ethnographic 
approach consisting 
of observations, 
unstructured interviews, 
writing of memos, 
feedback forms and 
reflective diaries was 
undertaken to collect 
data from a small 
number of cases. 
Variables were analyzed 
according to themes, 
such as: attitudes, care 
environment, loneliness 
and isolation.

The participants in the 
PRISM group reported less 
loneliness and increased 
social support and perceived 
well-being 6 months after the 
start of the study, as well as 
a greater decline in social 
isolation, when compared 
to the Binder group. Group 
differences were not 
maintained at 12 months; 
however, those in the 
PRISM condition maintained 
gains beyond baseline 
values in the loneliness and 
social support outcomes.

Access to technology 
applications such as the 
PRISM can increase 
social connectivity 
and reduce loneliness 
among older adults 
and has the potential 
to change attitudes 
towards technology and 
increase self-efficacy in 
using technology.

About half of the residents 
used video calling once 
or twice a month after 
implementation. The 
rest held video calls 
less frequently, taking 
advantage of opportunities 
like birthdays, important 
family occasions, or when 
close family members went 
on vacation. There were 
barriers with the device, 
due to its peculiar design, 
internet problems and 
anxiety when handling the 
small screen (cell phone). 
However, regarding the 
signs of loneliness and 
isolation, the participants 
showed a positive reaction 
to staying close and 
reconnecting with family 
members, only presenting 
insecurity related to self-
esteem and appearance due 
to hospitalization. 

The SoW intervention 
can help older people in 
care settings to become 
better connected with 
their families, however, if 
implemented as part of 
a rigorous assessment, 
co-production of the 
intervention at each 
recruitment site may be 
necessary to overcome 
barriers and maximize 
engagement.

1.The use of the 
internet

To explore 
older people’s 
experiences and 
assessments of 
the usefulness of 
an intervention to 
reduce feelings of 
loneliness.

To assess whether 
the use of ICTs 
has a positive 
effect on the social 
participation of older 
adults, whether 
social isolation 
has a negative 
effect on their 
social participation, 
whether loneliness 
moderates the 
effect of ICTs on 
social isolation, and 
whether loneliness 
moderates the 
influence of social 
isolation on social 
participation.

Qualitative study with 
32 older adults, 15 (IG) 
and 17 (CG), who lived 
in a residential care 
complex in Durban, South 
Africa. Participants in 
the intervention group 
received training in the 
use of smartphones 
and a chat application 
(WhatsApp). Results 
were measured through 
discussion in a focus 
group. Content analysis 
was performed to 
evaluate the group 
discussions and social 
media data.

Quantitative study 
carried out in India with 
240 participants. An 
instrument developed 
and validated by 
the researchers 
was used, covering 
sociodemographic data 
and the use of ICTs 
such as WhatsApp, 
Facebook and e-mail. 
For the variables of 
social isolation, social 
participation and 
loneliness, a Likert-type 
scale was used, with 
questions taken from the 
Loneliness Scale (UCLA), 
social isolation constructs 
and definitions of terms 
by the researchers, to 
ensure a greater ease 
of response for the older 
adults. 

The intervention group 
showed improvement in 
their levels of loneliness. 
The intervention reduced 
loneliness through four 
main means, namely: 
strengthening existing 
social bonds, facilitating 
the development of new 
social contacts, promoting 
cognitive flexibility, and 
increasing self-efficacy and 
self-confidence.

The analyses indicated 
that the cell phone 
was used to alleviate 
the perceptions of 
loneliness and isolation, 
therefore facilitating 
the construction of 
the social network, 
increasing self-efficacy 
and improving the 
cognitive flexibility of the 
older adults.

The older people who used 
ICTs were less socially 
isolated. The ability to 
access and disseminate 
information had positive 
effects, due to maintaining 
connections and managing 
new connections. Older 
adults who did not have a 
network of contacts did not 
use ICTs, directly affecting 
their contacts with friends 
and family. Loneliness did 
not impact the relationship 
between social isolation and 
social participation, however, 
it had a significant effect on 
the relationship between 
ICTs and social isolation, 
concluding that in the 
sample, lonely older people 
did not use ICTs, which was 
associated with greater 
isolation.

For the older adults, 
social inclusion 
depended on the use 
of specific ICTs for 
socialization. This can 
help older adults to 
participate more in the 
current techno-society, 
however programs and 
policies are needed 
that promote the use 
of specific ICTs for 
socialization among 
them, since their use 
can increase the level 
of activity, which can 
lead to an increase in 
social participation and 
a reduction in social 
isolation.

Conclusions

Mixed methods study, 
carried out with 12 
older adult residents of 
a Long Stay Institution 
for the Elderly (LSIE), 
in Canada. Participants 
used the tablet with the 
application for 3 months. 
The application had 
an easy-to-understand 
interface, with four 
options (automatic 
messages, video, photo 
or voice recording) 
all for the purpose of 
communication. There 
was a pre, middle and 
post research stage. 
In the pre-stage, an 
individual training session 
and application of the 
Social Support Scale 
(Duke Social Support 
Scale) and Solitude Scale 
(UCLA) were performed, 
as well as semi-
structured interviews with 
participants and family 
members. In the middle 
of the study period, the 
printed manual and tablet 
with the application were 
delivered for use during 
the 3 months, after half 
the time, the scales were 
reapplied. In the post-
stage, the application of 
the scales was repeated, 
interviews were carried 
out with family members 
and usability and 
accessibility tests were 
carried out.

Quantitative study 
performed with 738 older 
adults in Hong Kong. 
The interviews were 
carried out by telephone. 
The use of ICTs was 
evaluated through two 
questions, on a Likert-
type scale. Loneliness 
was assessed using the 
Revised Loneliness Scale 
(R-UCLA), psychological 
stress using the Kessler 
Scale, and sense of 
community using the Brief 
Sense of Community 
Scale (BSCS). 
Sociodemographic 
variables, financial 
sufficiency and self-
rated health were also 
evaluated.

Audio was the most used 
function, followed by image 
messages and then video. 
For some, the audio option 
was easier to use than cell 
phones, which are often 
“too small” and “difficult 
to operate”. The app was 
seen as an additional 
means of communication 
and the relatives of three 
older women reported an 
increase in the frequency 
of communication due to 
the use of the tool. The app 
influenced the perception 
of well-being of 7 of the 12 
participants, who reported 
an impact on their positive 
mood, self-efficacy and 
comfort with technology. 

Despite being older 
adult residents of 
an LSIE, and being 
vulnerable to social 
isolation and loneliness, 
no participant showed 
high levels of social 
isolation. The tool may 
have been less effective 
for these older adults, 
especially since at least 
one bond (available 
and participatory) is 
necessary for social 
interaction.

More frequent ICT use 
was associated with 
a lower psychological 
adjustment and higher 
levels of loneliness 
among the older adults. 
There was no correlation 
between ICT use and 
loneliness, psychological 
distress or sense of 
community with moderate 
significance. Loneliness was 
negatively associated with 
psychological distress and 
sense of community. The 
sample results suggested 
that ICT use predicted more 
psychological distress only 
among the loneliest older 
adults. ICT use predicted a 
lower sense of community 
among the lonelier older 
adults.

The use of ICTs was not 
necessarily beneficial 
for the sample. The 
authors highlighted the 
need for professionals 
and researchers to 
be vigilant about 
the symptoms that 
problematic Internet 
use causes in older 
adults, especially 
among the lonely and 
socially vulnerable. 
The risks of ICT use 
among older people are 
much less understood 
than its potential 
benefits. Identifying 
the mechanisms and 
limiting conditions 
related to problematic 
use is essential to make 
the most of the benefits 
that ICTs bring.

2.Communication 
Devices

To assess the 
role that social 
technology plays 
in the social life of 
older people

Qualitative study with 15 
older adults who regularly 
(more than once a week) 
used some form of social 
technology (WhatsApp, 
Facebook, Skype, email). 
The interviews covered 
topics such as: Attitude 
(how they felt about 
social technology?). 
Questions of why and 
how they started using 
social technology. What, 
with whom (network), but 
mainly why (reasons) the 
older people used social 
technology. Especially 
covering situations where 
the older adults used 
social technology. 

The social technological 
devices (hardware) most 
used by the participants 
were the landline phone, the 
smartphone and the tablet. 
The applications most used 
by the participants were 
WhatsApp and email. The 
use of most participants was 
influenced by their children 
and grandchildren; the 
participants reported that 
social technology is a good 
resource to communicate 
and contact them. The role 
social technology played in 
the participants’ lives and 
the time they spent using 
social technology varied. 
Most participants used 
social technology every 
day because it allowed 
them to communicate more 
easily with their friends 
and family. Some of the 
participants emphasized that 
they could not live without 
social technology. There 
were reports that social 
technology was a means 
or resource to connect the 
older person to the members 
of their network and to 
society. 

Social technology 
strengthened the older 
people’s existing social 
relationships and 
structures and brought 
depth and fun to social 
relationships.

3.Types of 
Communication

To evaluate 
the effect of a 
smartphone-based 
videoconferencing 
program on feelings 
of loneliness, 
depressive 
symptoms and 
quality of life of LSIE 
residents.

A quantitative, quasi-
experimental study 
carried out among 62 
older people living in Long 
Stay Institutions for the 
Elderly (LSIEs) in Taiwan. 
Participants were divided 
into the IG=32 and 
CG=30. The intervention 
consisted of interaction 
with family members once 
a week (minimum of 5 
minutes) for 6 months, 
using a smartphone and 
the LINE application. Data 
were collected at 1, 3 and 
6 months, using the self-
report instruments: Mini 
Mental State Examination 
(MMSE for inclusion 
criteria), Loneliness 
Scale (UCLA), Geriatric 
Depression Scale, Quality 
of Life (SF-36).

The smartphone video 
conferencing intervention 
reduced feelings of 
loneliness in the older adult 
residents at 1, 3, and 6 
months. The IG was older 
than the CG. The decrease 
in feelings of loneliness 
scores from baseline to 6 
months was significantly 
greater in the IG than in the 
CG. The videoconference 
intervention did not 
improve the residents’ 
depressive symptoms at 
any time, however, it had 
positive effects on vitality 
at 6 months, in addition, 
it had positive effects on 
QoL indicators for pain, 
vitality and physiological 
dimensions of health at 6 
months, but not on physical 
function. 

It was suggested 
that allowing older 
residents to use these 
communication and 
information technologies 
improves their overall 
outlook, as well as them 
reporting that they “felt 
young” or “became 
members of the modern 
generation”.

the Brazilian population. 

It is therefore recommended to carry out further

probably include new evidence to better understand 

the results in situations of mandatory social isolation. 

Accordingly, studies on loneliness and social isolation 

in older adults must be evaluated by the family and 

healthcare providers, with it being up to each person 

responsible to identify the social media available to each 

population and guide them in each situation. What must 

be considered is that social media are already part of 

society’s daily life and that we have a commitment to 

support those who need assistance in their daily lives, 

aiming to help older adults minimize the perception of 

loneliness and social isolation.
