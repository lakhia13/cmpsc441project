ABSTRACT
Introduction  Suicide is a global public health problem. 
Self- inflicted burns are one of the most severe methods 
of suicide, with high morbidity and mortality. Low- income 
and middle- income countries contribute 40% of all suicidal 
burns. Pakistan lacks comprehensive burns surveillance 
data, which prevents an understanding of the magnitude 
of the problem. This scoping review aims to understand 
the scope of the problem of suicide and self- harm burns 
in Pakistan and to identify knowledge gaps within the 
existing literature related to this specific phenomenon.
Methods and analysis  This scoping review will follow 
the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and 
O’Malley. We will search electronic databases (PubMed, 
Cochrane, Google Scholar and Pakmedinet), grey literature 
and a reference list of relevant articles to identify studies 
for inclusion. We will look for studies on self- inflicted 
burns as a method of suicide and self- harm in Pakistan, 
published from the beginning until December 2023, in the 
English language. Two independent reviewers will screen 
all abstracts and full- text studies for inclusion. The data 
will be collected on a data extraction form developed 
through an iterative process by the research team and it 
will be analysed using descriptive statistics.
Ethics and dissemination  Ethical exemption for this 
study has been obtained from the Institutional Review 
Board Committee of Aga Khan University Karachi, 
Pakistan. The findings of the study will be disseminated 
by conducting workshops for stakeholders, including 
psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors, general and 
public health physicians and policymakers. The findings 
will be published in national and international peer- 
reviewed journals.

BACKGROUND
Burns  are  a  global  public  health  problem, 
causing  an  estimated  180 000  deaths  per 
year.1  Mortality  from  burn  injuries  is  higher 
in  low- income  and  middle- income  countries 
(LMICs).  Almost  two- thirds  of  deaths  occur 
in  the  WHO  African  and  Southeast  Asia 
regions.1

Self- inflicted  burns  are  one  of  the  most 
painful and violent methods of suicide, with 
high  morbidity  and  mortality.2  Suicide  by 
burning  is  a  rare  condition  in  high- income 
countries  (0.06%–1%  of  all  suicides)  but  is 
more  frequent  in  LMICs  (accounting  for  as 
many  as  40.3%  of  all  suicides).3  77%  of  all 
suicides occurred in LMICs in 2019.4

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ The  Preferred  Reporting 

Items  for  Systematic 
Reviews  and  Meta- Analyses  protocol  and  scoping 
review  reporting  guidelines  have  been  followed  in 
the  preparation  of  this  manuscript  and  will  be  fol-
lowed throughout the scoping review process.
 ⇒ The review will be conducted in close collaboration 
between all authors. Any disagreement about the in-
clusion of studies will be discussed among the team 
until a consensus is reached. This process increases 
the validity and reliability of the review.

 ⇒ Academic librarians will be consulted to develop a 
search strategy and identify relevant papers in dif-
ferent databases.

 ⇒ Only English language studies will be included. This 
is  the  dominant  language  used  for  the  practice  of 
medicine in Pakistan, but it may restrict the breadth 
of our results.

Burn injuries can result in prolonged hospi-
talisation and long- term physical and psycho-
logical sequelae.5 Non- fatal burns contribute 
to  morbidity,  such  as  disfigurement  and 
disability,  leading  to  stigma  and  abandon-
ment for the survivors.1 Burns are among the 
leading causes of disability- adjusted life years 
lost in Asia.6

In Pakistan, a South Asian Islamic country, 
there  are  no  official  statistics  on  suicides  at 
the  national  level.7  The  WHO  estimated 
there were 19 331 suicidal deaths and a rate of 
8.9/100 000 people in 2019.4 Until recently, 
suicides were treated as criminal acts in Paki-
stan,  a  religiously  condemned  and  highly 
stigmatised.  In  December  2022,  suicide  and 
self- harm acts were decriminalised.8 However, 
it will take time for the abolition of the legal 
processes  associated  with  them.  Suicide  and 
self- inflicted 
injuries  are  under- reported 
due  to  religious,  sociocultural  and  medico-
legal  processes.  Suicidal  burn  injury  is  an 
important but under- researched area in Paki-
stan. Due to fear of societal stigma and legal 
issues,  families  withhold  information  about 
assault  and  self- harm  and  label  it  as  acci-
dental. This cany lead to misclassification and 
undercounting of cases.9 10

There are few systematic reviews and meta- analyses on 
suicidal burns from various parts of the world.11–14 These 
reviews  revealed  that  the  highest  prevalence  of  suicidal 
burns is found in South Asian and Eastern Mediterranean 
countries, including India, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri 
Lanka. In these studies, women represent many cases of 
suicidal burning with high mortality. Women who engage 
in suicidal self- burning are typically young, married and 
mothers.2 11 12 14

A  sysematic  scoping  review  has  been  conducted  on 
the  terminology  and  methods  used  to  differentiate  the 
intent  of  hospitals  presenting  burn  injuries  in  South 
Asia.15  However,  there  is  no  study  that  we  are  aware  of 
that  systematically  investigates  the  demographics  and 
outcomes of all suicidal burns in Pakistan.

The  importance  of  reviewing  the  existing  literature 
on burn studies in Pakistan lies in investigating the true 
extent of the burden imposed by suicidal burn injuries. 
It  is  crucial  to  explore  the  frequency,  demographics 
and  outcomes  reported  to  gain  insights  into  this  issue. 
Furthermore,  the  comparability  of  the  findings  in  the 
literature remains undetermined, emphasising the need 
for a scoping review to assess the availability and compara-
bility of the existing research. Identifying specific groups 
that are prominently affected by these injuries may also 
highlight  the  necessity  for  further  focused  studies  to 
address their special needs. The gravity of burn injuries 
in  terms  of  fatality16  and  the  availability  of  the  method, 
with  their  profound  impact  on  physical  and  mental 
health, differentiate these cases from other forms of self- 
harm. This necessitates a comprehensive understanding 
of the under- researched subject matter in Pakistan. This 
scoping review will also serve as an initial step as part of 
the planning to commence a surveillance system in Paki-
stan  by  gauging  the  magnitude  of  the  problem  and  its 
implications.

A  search  was  conducted  at  the  Open  Science  Frame-
work (OSF), Figshare, PubMed and Prospero for system-
atic and scoping reviews on self- inflicted burn injuries in 
Pakistan,  but  no  prior  research  specific  to  Pakistan  was 
identified.

Aims and objectives
This  scoping  review  aims  to  understand  the  scope  of 
the  problem  of  suicide  and  self- harm  using  burns  as  a 
method of attempt across various age groups in Pakistan. 
It will also provide evidence to identify the knowledge gap 
in the existing literature on the phenomenon of interest. 
The specific objectives of the review include:
1.  To  assess  the  availability  of  data  on  the  frequency  of 
self- harm and suicide cases involving burns across vari-
ous demographic factors in Pakistan.

2.  To  examine  the  methods  commonly  used  for  self- 
inflicted burns, including self- harm and suicide in Pa-
kistan.

3.  To  evaluate  the  outcomes  of  self- inflicted  burns  in 

Pakistan.

METHODS
We will conduct a scoping review to synthesise evidence 
on self- inflicted burns as a method of self- harm or suicide 
in  Pakistan.  This  protocol  has  been  written  using  the 
Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and 
Meta- Analyses  extension  for  Scoping  Reviews  (PRIS-
MA- ScR) (refer online supplemental file 1). This scoping 
review will follow the methodological framework proposed 
by Arksey and O’Malley17 and amended by Levac et al.18 
This framework consists of six stages: (1) identifying the 
research  question,  (2)  identifying  relevant  studies,  (3) 
study  selection,  (4)  data  charting,  (5)  data  analysis  and 
reporting the results and (6) consultation.

The  scoping  review  method  is  described,  considering 
the  above  six  stages.  This  review  has  been  registered 
with  the  Open  Science  Framework:  https://doi.org/10. 
17605/OSF.IO/XA68S.

Stage 1: identifying the research question
Based  on  the  literature  review,  we  formulated  the 
following research questions.

Research question 1A
What  is  the  frequency  of  self- harm  and  suicide  cases 
involving burns in Pakistan?

Research question 1B
How  is  the  frequency  of  self- harm  and  suicide  cases 
involving burns distributed across different demographic 
factors such as age, sex and marital status in Pakistan?

Research question 2A
What  are  the  common  methods  used  for  self- inflicted 
burns, including self- harm and suicide, in Pakistan?

Research question 2B
Are  there  any  variations  in  the  methods  of  self- inflicted 
burns based on demographic factors such as age, sex and 
marital status in Pakistan?

Research question 3A
What are the short- term and long- term outcomes of self- 
inflicted burns in Pakistan?

Research question 3B
Are there any variations in the outcomes of self- inflicted 
burns based on demographic factors such as age, sex, and 
marital status in Pakistan?

Stage 2: identifying relevant studies
To  identify  relevant  studies,  an  academic  librarian  will 
assist in developing a robust search strategy. We will iden-
tify MESH keywords for each concept (burns, suicide, self- 
harm  and  intentional)  included  in  the  review  question 
and use synonyms of key terms. Additionally, we will use 
Boolean operators with a combination of terms including 
(self- burning)  OR  (self- immolation)  OR  (burns)  OR 
(self- mutilation)  AND  (self- harm)  OR  (intentional)  OR 
(deliberate  self- harm)  AND  (suicide)  OR  (attempted

suicide)  OR  (parasuicide)  AND  (Pakistan)  to  look  for 
relevant literature (refer online supplemental file 2).

We  will  search  four  databases,  including  the  National 
Library  of  Medicine’s  MEDLINE  (PubMed),  Google 
Scholar, Cochrane Library and Pakmedinet. We will also 
search ‘grey literature’ that includes unpublished theses, 
conference papers and other reports. In addition, we will 
employ  an  ancestry  approach,  checking  the  reference 
lists  of  retrieved  articles  for  relevant  references.  We  will 
search  databases  from  the  beginning  until  December 
2023, published in the English language. The search strat-
egies for each database will be similar in structure, with 
similar search terms and synonyms. Additional keywords 
and  sources  identified  during  the  process  will  be  noted 
and  reported.  We  will  keep  a  separate  record  of  the 
search results in a spreadsheet file, including the date of 
search, search terms and the number of retrieved articles. 
The  search  results  will  be  exported  into  the  reference 
management  software  Endnote,  and  duplicate  articles 
will be removed.

Eligibility criteria
The  selection  of  studies  in  the  review  will  be  based  on 
the  thematic  framework  ‘Population–Concept–Context 
(PCC)’  recommended  by  the  Joanna  Briggs  Institute 
for  scoping  reviews,19  outlined  under  broader  eligibility 
criteria.  Consideration  would  be  given  to  additional 
filters  for  type  of  publication  and  language  preference 
(refer table 1)

Stage 3: study selection
Two  researchers  will  conduct  an  exercise  before  initi-
ating the search to ensure reliability in selecting articles 
for inclusion. This exercise will involve the independent 
screening of a random sample of 5% of the citations by 
the  two  independent  reviewers.  If  the  two  researchers 
show low agreement, they will revisit the selection criteria.
The study selection process involves two steps. In the first 
step, two reviewers (SP and AN) will screen the study titles 
and abstracts to determine eligibility for full- text screening 
based on predefined inclusion criteria. A spreadsheet file 
will  be  used  to  record  the  search  results,  including  the 
search date, terms used and the number of retrieved arti-
cles.  After  exporting  the  search  results  into  the  Endnote 
reference management software, duplicate articles will be 
removed. In the second stage of the selection process, the 
full  text  of  the  articles  will  be  retrieved  and  uploaded  as 
an  endnote.  These  will  undergo  independent  screening 
by the same two reviewers (SP and AN), and any disagree-
ments in eligibility between the reviewers will be resolved 
through discussion and involving a third researcher (MK).
We  will  use  an  adapted  version  of  the  PRISMA  flow 
diagram  to  report  the  final  numbers  of  the  included 
studies. At the full- text screening stage, we will record the 
reasons for excluding the studies.

Stage 4: charting the data
The data charting form has been developed in a Micro-
soft Excel sheet after consultation with the subject expert

Open access 

and  by  reviewing  the  existing  literature  (refer  online 
supplemental  file  3).  This  form  included  information 
on  the  source  of  the  study,  the  place  where  the  study 
was conducted, study design, time of the study, number 
of  burn  cases,  number  of  suicidal  burns,  mechanism 
of  burns,  age,  gender,  marital  status,  reasons  for  burns 
and  outcome.  We  will  pretest  the  form  and  modify  it 
accordingly.

Stage 5: data analysis and reporting the results
We will analyse the data descriptively using a data charting 
form.  The  study  question  included  the  frequency  of 
suicidal  burns  across  various  demographics,  methods 
commonly used for self- inflicted burns and the outcome of 
injury, which will be the basis for analysis. We will present 
the  characteristics  of  the  study  related  to  suicidal  burns 
using  tabulations  or  figures/flow  charts,  where  appro-
priate, to present a synthesis of key findings according to 
the scoping review objectives.

The researchers will report the scoping review according 

to the PRISMA- ScR checklist.

Stage 6: consultations
In this final stage, we will consult with the subject experts 
(MK and EB) to validate the findings. The subject experts 
will help to situate the findings in the context of broader 
research, policy, and practice.

Our scoping review work is in the study selection phase, 
which began in November 2023. The authors anticipate 
that  this  review  will  be  completed  and  submitted  for 
publication in the latter half of 2024.

Patient and public involvement
There has been no patient or public involvement in the 
development  of  this  protocol,  nor  will  there  be  in  the 
scoping review itself.

Coordination, monitoring and quality control
The study will ensure quality control by adhering to the 
standard protocols for conducting scoping reviews. This 
includes:
 ► Use  of  the  five- stage  framework  by  Arksey  and 

O’Malley for conducting a literature review.
 ► Development of a comprehensive search strategy.
 ► Training  and  debriefing  session  for  the  two  staff  on 

conducting the scoping review.

 ► Independent  review  by 

two  experienced 

team 

members.

 ► Frequent  meetings  with  the  research  team  to  review 

the findings.

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DISSEMINATION
Ethical  exemption  for  this  study  has  been  obtained 
from  the  Institutional  Review  Board  Committee  of  Aga 
Khan  University  Karachi,  Pakistan.  We  will  disseminate 
the  findings  of  the  study  by  conducting  workshops  for 
stakeholders, 
including  psychiatrists,  psychologists, 
counsellors,  general  and  public  health  physicians  and 

4

policymakers. Additionally, we will publish the findings in 
national and international peer- reviewed journals.
