ABSTRACT

Obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  is  characterized  by  distressing  thoughts  and  repetitive  behaviors  that  are 
interfering, time-consuming, and difficult to control. Although OCD was once thought to be untreatable, the last few 
decades have seen great success in reducing symptoms with exposure and response prevention (ERP), which is now 
considered  to  be  the  first-line  psychotherapy  for  the  disorder.  Despite  these  significant  therapeutic  advances,  there 
remain a number of challenges in treating OCD. In this review, we will describe the theoretical underpinnings and 
elements of ERP, examine the evidence for its effectiveness, and discuss new directions for enhancing it as a therapy 
for OCD.

INTRODUCTION

(OCD) 

Considered  one  of  the  most  debilitating  psychiatric 
illnesses,[1,2]  obsessive-compulsive  disorder 
is 
characterized  by  distressing  thoughts  and  repetitive 
behaviors that are interfering, time-consuming, and difficult 
to control.[3] Historically, OCD was thought to be untreatable, 
as  people  with  the  disorder  did  not  respond  that  well  to 
traditional  psychodynamic  psychotherapy,  medication, 
or  available  behavioral  interventions  such  as  systematic 
desensitization  or  aversion  therapy.[4]  The  first  significant

after  Meyer[5]  reported  that  patients’  OCD  symptoms  
improved  when  they  were  exposed  to  feared  stimuli  
while,  crucially,  refraining  from  performing  compulsions.  
Subsequent studies indicated that this method of exposure 
and  response  prevention  (ERP)  was  effective  in  both  a 
hospital  and  outpatient  setting  and  that  a  majority  of 
patients  experienced  significant  improvement  which  was 
maintained  for  many  up  to  two  years  post-treatment.[6-8] 
Since then, ERP has become the first-line psychotherapeutic 
treatment  for  OCD  and  will,  therefore,  be  the  focus  of 
the  current  paper.  In  this  review,  we  will  describe  the 
theoretical underpinnings and elements of ERP, examine the 
evidence  for  its  effectiveness,  and  discuss  new  directions 
for enhancing it as a therapy for OCD.

ELEMENTS OF EXPOSURE AND RESPONSE 
PREVENTION

Mowrer’s[9]  two-factor  theory  of  fear  and  avoidance 
provided  an 
influential  framework  for  understanding 
the  etiology  of  OCD  that  inspired  the  development  of 
behavioral  treatments  for  the  disorder,  including  ERP. 
Specifically,  Mowrer  asserted  that  individuals  experience 
anticipatory  anxiety  in  the  presence  of  environmental 
stimuli  that  are  associated  with  painful  or  aversive 
experiences  through  classical  conditioning.  Subsequent 
avoidance of the feared stimuli serves to alleviate people’s 
anxiety,  which  in  turn  reinforces  the  avoidant  behavior 
through  operant  conditioning.  Similarly,  individuals  with 
OCD  experience  anxiety-provoking  obsessions  that  are 
triggered  by  various  situations  and  subsequently  perform 
compulsions or engage in avoidance behaviors to decrease 
the  anxiety  associated  with  these  thoughts.  Paradoxically, 
these ritual and avoidance behaviors reinforce individuals’ 
fear and strengthen both obsessions and compulsions. ERP 
aims to break this cycle of symptoms by eliminating rituals 
and  avoidance,  thereby  teaching  patients  how  to  tolerate 
distress  without  engaging  in  counterproductive  behaviors 
and  providing  “corrective  information”  that  challenges 
people’s existing fear response.[4]

ERP can be conducted at varying levels of intensity, including 
outpatient, partial hospitalization, and residential treatment 
settings,  depending  on  the  severity  of  the  patients’ 
symptoms. Irrespective of the symptom severity, however, 
ERP  typically  shares  certain  elements  across  settings.[4] 
First, there is an assessment and treatment planning phase 
during which the clinician provides psychoeducation about 
OCD and its treatment and collects information about the 
patient’s symptoms. The patient and clinician work together 
to  identify  external  (situations,  objects,  people,  etc.)  and 
internal (thoughts and physiological reactions) stimuli that 
trigger  the  person’s  obsessive  thoughts  and  subsequent 
distress. Importantly, they also catalog the specific content 
of  the  person’s  obsessions  and  compulsions,  discuss  the 
functional  relationship  between  the  two,  and  identify 
the  feared  outcome  if  the  rituals  are  not  performed.  For 
example,  one  patient  might  repeatedly  wash  his  hands  to 
disinfect  them,  thereby  preventing  a  feared  outcome  of 
contracting an illness and dying. Another patient, however, 
might  wash  her  hands  because  she  is  disgusted  by  the 
physical sensation of having residue on her hands and will, 
therefore,  keep  washing  them  until  they  “feel  right.”  The 
patient  and  clinician  then  work  collaboratively  to  rank 
different situations in order from least to most distressing 
(as measured by subjective units of distress or SUDs), which 
results in a fear hierarchy.

Over  the  subsequent  treatment  sessions,  the  clinician 
coaches the patient as he or she repeatedly confronts the 
situations  on  his  or  her  fear  hierarchy  while  refraining 

from  engaging  in  compulsions.  For  example,  a  man  who 
has  a  fear  of  contracting  an  illness  from  unclean  surfaces 
might  hold  his  hands  on  various  bathroom  surfaces  for  a 
prolonged period of time, but not wash his hands afterward. 
The patients may also engage in imaginal exposures during 
which they envision their feared outcome triggered by their 
obsessive thoughts (e.g., pushing someone into oncoming 
traffic  and  then  being  sent  to  prison).  By  practicing  both 
in  vivo  and  imaginal  exposures,  the  patients  learn  that 
the  consequences  they  fear  do  not  occur,  as  well  as  how 
to  tolerate  distress  and  uncertainty  without  engaging  in 
compulsions.[4]  Following  each  in-session  exposure,  the 
therapist  and  patient  engage  in  post-exposure  processing 
to  review  the  patient’s  experience  and  how  his  or  her 
expectations were violated and what he or she learned. The 
patients are also asked to practice exposures on their own 
for homework and to attempt to eliminate all rituals in their 
day-to-day life. As patients habituate to various scenarios, 
they  then  gradually  work  their  way  up  the  fear  hierarchy 
to  confront  increasingly  distressing  situations.  Typically, 
a  course  of  ERP  will  conclude  with  relapse  prevention 
planning.

EFFICACY

two-thirds  of  patients  who 

Since  ERP  was  recognized  as  a  viable  treatment  for  OCD, 
a  large  body  of  literature  has  supported  its  efficacy.  Early 
studies  demonstrated  its  superiority  in  reducing  patients’ 
OCD  symptoms  relative  to  relaxation  therapy,  anxiety 
management,  or  a  wait-list  condition.[10-14]  Subsequent 
reports  have  similarly  pointed  to  its  effectiveness  across 
multiple  countries,  treatment  settings,  and  intensity.[11-15] 
Indeed,  a  meta-analysis  by  Eddy  et  al.[16]  indicated  that 
approximately 
received 
symptoms,  and 
ERP  experienced 
approximately  one-third  of  patients  were  considered  to 
be recovered. Moreover, although the majority of patients 
treated  with  cognitive-behavioral  therapy  (without  ERP 
specifically)  or  cognitive  therapy  also  experienced  a 
reduction in symptoms post-treatment, ERP outperformed 
the  other  treatments.  Specifically,  there  was  a  slightly 
stronger  effect  size  for  ERP,  and  it  resulted  in  lower  OCD 
severity  scores  post-treatment  relative  to  the  other  two 
modalities.[17]

improvement 

in 

Importantly,  research  indicates  that  the  treatment  is 
effective not only with highly controlled study samples of 
OCD that are not necessarily representative of the general 
clinical population but also with less restricted samples with 
comorbidities and complicated treatment histories and that 
are concurrently taking medication.[11,18] That patients in a 
representative  outpatient  treatment  setting  experienced 
significant  symptom  improvement  after  a  course  of  ERP 
speaks to the treatment’s generalizability. A review by Storch 
et al.[15] provides further support for the treatment’s utility 
in a variety of settings (e.g., home vs. office), delivered in 

S86

and  with  pediatric  and  adolescent  populations.  Moreover, 
ERP  has  also  been  shown  to  lead  not  only  to  symptom 
reduction but also to a decrease in sleep disturbances and 
improved quality of life more generally.[15,19,20]

reuptake 

Treatment  studies  have  also  examined  the  efficacy  of  ERP 
relative  to  and  in  combination  with  medication.  A  review 
of four studies indicated that medication neither enhanced 
nor  impeded  treatment  with  ERP.[21]  That  is,  individuals 
taking  a  combination  of  medication  and  ERP  had  similar 
outcomes  to  individuals  in  ERP  alone  but  improved  more 
than  individuals  on  medication  alone.  In  a  subsequent 
study examining the combined effects of ERP with selective 
(the  pharmacological 
inhibitors 
serotonin 
frontline treatment for OCD), Foa et al.[22] randomized OCD 
participants into one of four treatment conditions as follows: 
ERP  only,  clomipramine  only,  ERP  plus  clomipramine,  and 
placebo. At the end of 12 weeks, participants treated with 
ERP  or  a  combination  of  ERP  plus  medication  showed  a 
greater  decrease  in  symptoms  relative  to  those  treated 
with  clomipramine  alone  [Figure  1,  left  panel].  Moreover, 
those in the ERP plus medication condition did not differ in 
post-treatment  symptom  severity  from  those  treated  with 
ERP  alone,  indicating  that  medication  did  not  bolster  the 
efficacy of ERP.[7]

More recent studies have similarly tested the effectiveness 
of  ERP  as  an  augmentation  approach  for  individuals  who 
benefit  from  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SRIs)  but 
continue to suffer from clinically significant OCD symptoms. 
Simpson et al.[23] found that patients on a stable dose of SRIs 
experienced  greater  symptom  reduction  after  additional 
treatment  with  17  weeks  of  ERP  compared  to  those  who 

received  augmentation  with  stress  management  training 
[Figure  1,  center  panel].  A  similar  pattern  of  findings 
emerged  when  comparing  augmentation  with  ERP  to  that 
with  risperidone.  Specifically,  individuals  taking  SRIs  had 
lower OCD severity scores immediately[24] and 6 months[25] 
following additional treatment with ERP than those who had 
additional treatment with risperidone or placebo [Figure 1, 
right  panel].  The  OCD  severity  of  groups  who  received 
risperidone or placebo did not significantly differ from one 
another post-treatment.

Although  the  current  guidelines  recommend  ERP  as  the 
first-line treatment for OCD, only about half of the patients 
who  receive  it  will  reach  complete  symptom  remission.[26] 
There are a number of factors that are associated with poor 
response,  including  lack  of  adherence  to  treatment,  poor 
insight, comorbid depression, and OCD severity (for a review 
of  treatment-resistance  Middleton,  Wheaton,  Kayser,  & 
Simpson  (2019)[27]).  Approximately  20–30%  of  patients  drop 
out  of  ERP  prematurely,[11]  perhaps  unsurprising  given  the 
challenging  and  time-consuming  nature  of  the  treatment. 
Moreover, there is variation in the extent to which patients 
adhere  to  treatment  recommendations  even  if  they  do 
complete  a  full  course  of  ERP.  One  study  found  that  low 
adherence  to  completing  exposures  assigned  between  ERP 
sessions predicted higher symptom severity post-treatment.[28] 
Similarly, clinicians are susceptible to making errors in how 
they deliver the treatment to patients, which likewise inhibits 
its effectiveness.[29] Given the strong association of adherence 
to  treatment  outcome,  future  interventions  that  increase 
patient and therapist fidelity to ERP would be worthwhile.

Research investigating the relationship between outcomes 
and  other  factors  such  as  insight  and  depression  and

studies  indicate  that  individuals  with  poor  insight  have 
a  lower  response  to  ERP  than  do  those  with  good  or  fair 
insight,  other  studies  fail  to  find  an  association  between 
the two.[27] Discrepant findings may be due to a restricted 
range of insight in OCD study samples. That is, people with 
very  low  insight  may  be  less  likely  to  seek  treatment  for 
symptoms than do those with better insight.

Similarly,  some  studies  have  found  that  people  suffering 
from severe symptoms and those with comorbid depression 
have  worse  treatment  outcomes  than  people  with  no  or 
mild depression and those with less severe OCD. However, a 
meta-analysis by Olatunji et al.[30] reported no differences in 
treatment outcome effect sizes for a range of moderators, 
including depression and symptom severity. One explanation 
for  these  inconsistent  findings  is  that  these  factors  may 
impact  treatment  adherence  rather  than  outcomes  more 
directly.  For  example,  individuals  with  poor  insight  (e.g., 
a man who believes that his feared outcomes are realistic 
or  that  his  rituals  will  prevent  negative  events)  may  be 
less likely to adhere to treatment and engage in exposures 
than  someone  who  recognizes  her  fears  and  behaviors  as 
excessive and unrealistic.

MECHANISMS OF CHANGE

Researchers  have  proposed  different  theories  of  how  ERP 
works or its mechanism of action. Early cognitive models of 
OCD proposed that people develop the disorder when they 
misinterpret the significance of normal, intrusive thoughts 
that the majority of individuals will experience at some point 
in their lives.[31,32] Dysfunctional thoughts such as an inflated 
sense of responsibility for preventing harm to oneself and 
others, overestimation of threat, intolerance of uncertainty, 
a need for perfectionism, and over-importance of and need 
to control thoughts have also been identified as potential 
etiological and maintaining factors for OCD, as they cause 
people  to  interpret  their  intrusive  thoughts  as  significant 
and potentially dangerous.[33] According to this perspective 
then, ERP works by disconfirming people’s distorted beliefs 
through exposures. For example, if a woman overestimates 
the likelihood of danger, then repeated exposures to feared 
situations in which she tests this belief would presumably 
lead to less-biased thinking, thereby resulting in decreased 
OCD  symptoms.  Since  its  inception,  the  cognitive  theory 
of  OCD  has  received  empirical  support,[34]  including  from 
studies showing that decrements in dysfunctional thinking 
mediate symptom improvement post-treatment.[35] However, 
other studies have found that OCD severity predicts changes 
in  dysfunctional  thinking,  thus  calling  into  question  the 
causal  direction  of  change.[36]  Specifically,  Olatunji  et  al.[37] 
found  that  changes  in  OCD  symptoms  preceded  altered 
beliefs  about  inflated  responsibility  rather  than  the  other 
way around.

A  behavioral  perspective  asserts  that  ERP  works  by 
breaking  the  conditioned  response  between  obsessions 
and  compulsions.[5]  According  to  this  model,  compulsions 
temporarily  alleviate  people’s  anxiety  that  obsessive 
thoughts trigger. The decrease in distress strengthens the 
rituals and conditions people to continue using them when 
confronted  with  subsequent  intrusive  thoughts.  On  the 
other hand, when individuals confront triggering situations 
while  simultaneously  refraining  from  engaging  in  rituals, 
their  distress  decreases  naturally  in  the  absence  of  their 
feared outcome. With repeated exposure, the fear response 
is eventually extinguished and OCD symptoms subside.

According  to  emotion  processing  theory,  fear  and  other 
emotions  are  stored  in  memory  structures  that  contain 
information about stimuli that elicit the emotional response, 
as  well  as  the  response  itself.[7]  This  theory  states  that 
exposure therapy provides information that is contradictory 
to  the  existing  fear  structure  when  patients’  dreaded 
outcomes  do  not  occur.  Consequently,  individuals  form 
new, more realistic memory structures that do not include 
a pathological fear response. Repeated practice confronting 
distressing  situations  strengthens  the  activation  of  this 
competing structure, thereby weakening the occurrence of 
the fear response.

More  recently,  researchers  have  proposed  that  inhibitory 
learning 
is  central  to  extinction  through  exposure 
therapy.[38,39]  Specifically,  this  theory  purports  that  the 
initial  conditioned  association  between  the  stimulus  and 
the  unconditioned  fear  response  does  not  disappear,  but 
rather  that  a  new  association  is  learned  that  competes 
with  the  former  response.  Craske  et  al.  explain  that 
“…after  extinction,  the  [conditioned  stimulus]  possesses 
two meanings; its original excitatory meaning (conditioned 
stimulus–unconditioned  stimulus)  as  well  as  an  additional 
inhibitory meaning (conditioned stimulus–no unconditioned 
stimulus)”  (p.  11-12).[38]  Therefore,  the  newly  formed 
association  inhibits  the  memory  of  the  original  excitatory 
response  with  repeated  practice,  but  does  not  prevent  it 
from  being  reactivated  at  some  point  in  the  future,  thus 
underscoring  the  importance  of  continued  exposure  to 
once-feared stimuli.

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the 
neural mechanisms underlying the etiology and treatment 
of psychiatric disorders, including OCD. For example, using 
a neurobiological framework, Gillan and Robbins[40] propose 
that compulsions are the result of excessive habit formation 
and  that  obsessions  develop  when  the  sufferer  makes 
inferences  about  his  or  her  behavior  (e.g.,  “I  check  the 
knobs  on  the  stove  so  I  must  be  afraid  of  accidentally 
starting a fire”). Therefore, when refraining from engaging 
in  compulsions  during  ERP,  the  patients  are  learning  to 
break  the  habitual  ritualistic  behavior,  which,  in  turn, 
reduces obsessions. A number of studies examining neural 

S88

Hezel and Simpson: ERP for OCDmechanisms  of  change  have  identified  differences  in  the 
brain from pre- to post-treatment with psychotherapy.[41-43] 
However, researchers have yet to identify how these changes 
are  directly  related  to  processes  that  then  lead  to  clinical 
improvement.[44]

NEW DIRECTIONS

Despite the success of ERP in treating OCD, there is room 
for improvement. As noted above, many people drop out of 
treatment  prematurely  and  a  substantial  number  of  those 
who do complete a course of ERP do not achieve a clinically 
significant reduction of symptoms. Some especially notable 
challenges  in  treating  OCD  include  addressing  people’s 
limited access to evidence-based treatments, finding novel 
ways  to  improve  upon  ERP  to  increase  its  efficacy,  and 
integrating  biological  and  psychological  frameworks  to 
fine-tune treatment.

Access to care
There  are  numerous  barriers  to  treatment,  including  high 
costs of care, stigma surrounding mental health issues, and 
lack of access to clinicians who are trained in evidence-based 
practices.[45-47]  One  solution  to  improve  access  to  care  is 
the  development  of  an  internet-based  ERP  program  that 
individuals can use to guide themselves through treatment 
with  the  support  of  a  therapist  through  e-mail,  phone,  or 
the  online  treatment  platform.[48,49]  Results  from  studies 
implementing these internet programs are promising; they 
have  demonstrated  not  only  the  feasibility,  but  also  the 
efficacy,  of  delivering  ERP  online.  Specifically,  individuals 
who  completed  these  online  programs  experienced  a 
clinically  significant  decrease  in  OCD  symptoms[47,49,50] 
which were maintained at follow-up.[49,51] Given the growing 
ubiquity of internet access and cellular phones, continuing 
to develop programs that increase the dissemination of ERP 
is worthwhile.

Enhancing exposure and response prevention
Technological  advances  have  been  used  not  only  to 
disseminate  ERP  but  also  in  an  attempt  to  improve  its 
effects.  Najmi  and  Amir  (2010)  recruited  individuals  with 
subclinical  OCD  contamination  concerns  to  complete 
attention  bias  modification  (ABM)  before  a  subsequent 
behavioral  approach  task.  In  the  attention  task,  half  of 
the  participants  were  placed  in  an  active  condition,  in 
which  they  were  trained  to  shift  their  attention  away 
from “threatening” words (i.e., related to contamination), 
whereas  the  other  half  in  the  nonactive  condition  did 
not receive such training. The authors found that relative 
to  those  in  the  nonactive  condition,  individuals  in  the 
active  ABM  group  were  less  avoidant  of  contaminated 
objects  during  a  subsequent  behavioral  approach  task.  It 
is  possible,  then,  that  reducing  attention  to  threat  may 
diminish  avoidance  behaviors,  thus  making  people  more 
willing to engage in exposures.[52] However, a subsequent 

study using a clinical population found that ABM alone did 
not  reduce  OCD  symptoms,  thus  suggesting  that  it  may 
be  more  effective  in  addition  to  ERP  rather  than  in  place 
of it.[53]

Virtual reality is similarly being studied as a way to enhance 
exposure  therapy  for  a  number  of  disorders,  including 
post-traumatic  stress  disorder  and  anxiety  disorders.[54,55] 
Although  it  has  not  been  tested  extensively  with  OCD 
patients, a preliminary study demonstrated its effectiveness 
in  triggering  and  measuring  anxiety  in  people  through  a 
virtual  reality  platform.[56]  Virtual  reality  may  be  especially 
effective in designing exposures to situations or stimuli that 
are impossible to reproduce in vivo and are otherwise left to 
imaginal exposures.

Craske et al.[39] have proposed a number of ways to enhance 
extinction learning based on the aforementioned inhibitory 
learning perspective. This orientation emphasizes that the 
overarching goal of exposure should be distress tolerance 
rather than fear reduction. Accordingly, the authors outline 
ideas  for  how  to  translate  this  approach  into  clinical 
practice  with  exposure  therapy,  such  as  maximizing  the 
extent to which people’s expectancies of feared outcomes 
are  violated,  pairing  a  previously  extinguished  cue  with 
a  new  conditioned  stimulus,  removing  safety  signals, 
and  practicing  exposures  in  multiple  contexts  (e.g.,  with 
different people, settings, times of day, etc.[39]). By homing 
in  on  processes  thought  to  underlie  mechanisms  of 
change,  it  may  be  possible  to  maximize  the  benefits  of 
extinction learning, thus leading to greater improvement in 
psychopathological symptoms.

Finally,  some  studies  have  investigated  the  advantage  of 
enhancing  ERP  with  medication  implicated  in  facilitated 
extinction  learning.  Specifically,  research  demonstrated 
that,  relative  to  those  given  a  placebo  pill,  patients 
taking  d-cycloserine  before  engaging  in  exposure  therapy 
experienced a faster rate of symptom improvement in the 
first few weeks of receiving ERP.[57] However, there were no 
group differences in symptom improvement by the end of 
treatment, suggesting that the drug’s utility lies primarily in 
speeding up treatment response.[58]

Integrating biological and psychological approaches
Investigations on the biological underpinnings of OCD have 
identified genetic factors and abnormalities in neurocircuitry 
that  are  associated  with  the  disorder.[59]  However,  very 
little  research  has  bridged  the  gap  between  biological 
and  psychological  approaches  in  psychopathology,  and 
consequently,  there  is  a  dearth  of  information  regarding 
how  information  about  genetics  or  neurobiology  might 
meaningfully improve our treatment of psychiatric disorders. 
Notable exceptions are recent studies that have identified 
gene  variants  of  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  (BDNF) 
and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) that mediate outcome

Hezel and Simpson: ERP for OCDto psychotherapeutic treatment. The BDNF gene codes for a 
protein that promotes neuron development and growth and 
helps to regulate the neurophysiological response to stress, 
making it especially relevant to better understanding mood 
and anxiety disorders.[60] A series of studies have reported 
that variants of the BDNF gene are associated with improved 
treatment outcomes with medication for schizophrenia,[61] 
with dialectical behavior therapy for borderline personality 
disorder,[62]  and,  most  recently,  with  cognitive  behavioral 
therapy (CBT) for children with anxiety disorders.[63]

FAAH, on the other hand, is a gene in the endocannabinoid 
system,  which  plays  an  important  role  in  regulating 
anxiety  and  facilitating  fear  extinction,  which  is  central 
to  ERP  as  noted  above.[60]  Dincheva  et  al.[64]  found  an 
association  between  a  variant  of  FAAH  and  accelerated 
fear extinction in late stages of an extinction learning task 
as well as reduced levels of anxiety. This finding suggests 
that  it  may  be  possible  to  identify  individuals  who  are 
more  responsive  to  treatments  that  entail  extinction 
learning.  However,  a  more  recent  study  in  children  with 
anxiety  disorders  found  only  minimal  evidence  of  a 
correlation between gene variants in the endocannabinoid 
system  and  response  to  CBT.[60]  The  authors  assert  that 
though further research on the endocannabinoid system 
specifically  and  on  “therapygenetics”  (p.  153)  more 
generally is worthwhile, we are unlikely to identify single 
gene  variants  that  predict  response  to  psychological 
treatments.

Finally,  several  surgical  and  noninvasive  neurological 
interventions  are  available  to  patients  who  have  not  had 
success with psychotherapy or medication. Neuromodulating 
methods such as transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) 
and  transcranial  magnetic  stimulation  (TMS),  as  well  as 
surgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation, work to 
decrease  symptoms  by  targeting  underlying  neurocircuitry 
implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD.[65-68] Few studies 
have examined the effect of augmenting therapy with these 
methods and fewer still specifically for the treatment of OCD. 
However, there are encouraging reports that indicate some 
benefit of combining tDCS with CBT for treatment-resistant 
depression,[69]  suggesting  it  might  likewise  be  useful  as 
an  augmentation  for  the  treatment  of  other  disorders. 
Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that combining DBS 
with  CBT  (which  included  ERP)  resulted  in  a  reduction  of 
OCD symptoms in a treatment-refractory sample.[70] Indeed, 
DBS  has  been  shown  to  enhance  fear  extinction,[71,72]  thus 
highlighting  its  potential  usefulness  when  paired  with 
a  treatment  such  as  ERP.  Finally,  in  their  meta-analysis, 
Berlim  et  al.[73]  found  that  repetitive  TMS  was  an  effective 
augmentation  for  medication  when  treating  refractory 
OCD.  None  of  the  studies  included  in  the  meta-analysis 
examined  TMS  in  combination  with  ERP;  hence,  whether 
or not they would be beneficial when used together merits 
further study.

Morphometric  studies  have  revealed  that  the  thickness[74] 
and volume[75] of different brain regions in individuals with 
OCD are correlated with treatment outcomes with exposure 
therapy. What remains to be seen, however, is if variation 
in  neurocircuitry,  such  as  genetic  variants,  can  ultimately 
predict  differential  response  to  treatment  and  whether 
brain  imaging  findings  at  baseline  can  be  usefully  applied 
to  individual  patients.  Since  OCD  is  caused  by  a  complex 
interaction  among  genetic,  neurocircuitry,  environmental, 
and  developmental  factors,  it  is  essential  that  researchers 
integrate  psychological  and  biological 
continue 
approaches  to  more  effectively  treat  this  debilitating 
disease.

ALTERNATIVES TO EXPOSURE AND RESPONSE 
PREVENTION

Although ERP has been identified as a (nonpharmacological) 
gold standard treatment for OCD, other psychotherapeutic 
treatments  have  been  developed  and  their  efficacy 
empirically  supported  (see  Manjula  and  Sudhir  review  in 
this issue for more details).

Two that have been found to be effective in treating OCD 
include cognitive therapy and acceptance and commitment 
therapy (ACT). Despite the fact that ERP, cognitive therapy, 
and  ACT  are  considered  distinct  treatments  grounded  in 
different  theoretical  perspectives,  they  share  common 
elements  that  perhaps  make  them  more  similar  than 
they seem on the surface.[76] Moreover, though  some  data 
support their efficacy as standalone treatments for OCD,[77,78] 
some  argue  that  integrating  components  of  cognitive 
therapy (Rector, in press) or ACT into ERP may have added 
benefits.[79] Future research in this area is needed.

CONCLUSION

ERP  is  a  highly  efficacious  treatment  for  many  people 
who  suffer  from  OCD.  Although  there  are  a  number  of 
explanations for its mechanism of action, it is still unclear 
exactly  how  it  works  or  why  some  people  respond  to  it 
whereas  others  do  not.[44]  Although  up  to  half  of  people 
will achieve minimal symptoms after acute treatment with 
ERP  as  either  a  monotherapy[22]  or  in  combination  with 
medication,[23,24]  many  who  undergo  the  therapy  will 
remain symptomatic and some will not benefit at all. These 
shortcomings underscore the need to continue to improve 
upon ERP by enhancing it with new methods, incorporating 
genetic  and  neurobiological  approaches,  and  developing 
alternative treatments.
