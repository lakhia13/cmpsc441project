Abstract
We searched Embase, PubMed, and CENTRAL from inception until 22 May 2020 to investigate which antipsychotics and/
or mood stabilizers are better for patients with bipolar disorder in the maintenance phase. We performed two categorical
network meta-analyses. The ﬁrst included monotherapy studies and studies in which the two drugs used were speciﬁed (i.e.,
aripiprazole, aripiprazole once monthly, aripiprazole+lamotrigine, aripiprazole+valproate, asenapine, carbamazepine,
lamotrigine, lamotrigine+valproate, lithium, lithium+oxcarbazepine, lithium+valproate, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetia-
pine, risperidone long-acting injection, valproate, and placebo). The second included studies on second-generation
antipsychotic combination therapies (SGAs) (i.e., aripiprazole, lurasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone) with
lithium or valproate (LIT/VAL) compared with placebo with LIT/VAL. Outcomes were recurrence/relapse rate of any mood
episode (RR-any, primary), depressive episode (RR-dep) and manic/hypomanic/mixed episode (RR-mania), discontinuation,
mortality, and individual adverse events. Risk ratios and 95% credible interval were calculated. Forty-one randomized
controlled trials were identiﬁed (n = 9821; mean study duration, 70.5 ± 36.6 weeks; percent female, 54.1%; mean age, 40.7
years). All active treatments other than carbamazepine, lamotrigine+valproate (no data) and paliperidone outperformed the
placebo for RR-any. Aripiprazole+valproate,
lithium, olanzapine, and quetiapine
outperformed placebo for RR-dep. All active treatments, other than aripiprazole+valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and
lamotrigine+valproate, outperformed placebo for RR-mania. Asenapine, lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, and valproate
outperformed placebo for all-cause discontinuation. All SGAs+LIT/VALs other than olanzapine+LIT/VAL outperformed
placebo+LIT/VAL for RR-any. Lurasidone+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL outperformed placebo+LIT/VAL for
RR-dep. Aripiprazole+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL outperformed placebo+LIT/VAL for RR-mania. Lurasidone
+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL outperformed placebo+LIT/VAL for all-cause discontinuation. Treatment efﬁcacy,
tolerability, and safety proﬁles differed among treatments.

Introduction

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common chronic mental disorder
and a major contributor to the global burden of disease, with
a worldwide prevalence of ~1% [1–3]. Patients with BD
repeatedly and irregularly present mania/hypomania or
depression during their lifetimes, which can result in social
and occupational disability [4].

Pharmacological treatments are among the primary treat-
ments for BD [4, 5]. The most recent guidelines state that
clinicians and patients should take the maintenance phase into
account when selecting acute phase treatments [6]. A previous
network meta-analysis (NMA) reported that, compared with
placebo, lithium and quetiapine reduced the recurrence or

relapse rate of any mood, depressive, or manic, hypomanic/
mixed episodes [7]. Recently, aripiprazole once monthly
(AOM) and asenapine were approved for the treatment of BD
[8]. We performed a systematic review and NMA of the
efﬁcacy, tolerability, and safety of antipsychotics and/or mood
stabilizers, and we conducted a risk-beneﬁt analysis of each
medication for patients with BD in the maintenance phase.

required for meta-analysis were missing in the articles, we
searched for these data in published systematic review
articles. Although we attempted to contact the original study
investigators to obtain unpublished data, we did not succeed
in obtaining these data from all of them.

Meta-analysis methods

Methods

This study was performed according to the Preferred
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Reporting Items
[9] and was
Analyses guidelines (PRISMA Checklist)
registered on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/h4nw
p). The literature search, data extraction, and data input into
spreadsheets for analysis were performed simultaneously
and independently by at least two authors (TK, TI, YM, KS,
and MO). The authors double-checked the accuracy of data
transfer and calculations in the study.

Search strategy and inclusion criteria

The information about the literature search is shown in Sup-
plementary Fig. 1. Inclusion criteria were (1) randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) of antipsychotics and/or mood sta-
bilizers lasting at least 12 weeks; (2) studies including adult
patients with any BD subtype in the maintenance phase; (3)
studies including patients with any mood symptoms at
recruitment; (4) open studies and those with any level of
blinding; and (5) studies with/without an enrichment designs.
Exclusion criteria were (1) studies with child/ adolescent
patients with BD; (2) continuation studies which randomly
assigned patients with acute symptoms to treatment groups;
(3) monotherapy and/or combination therapy studies of anti-
depressants with mood stabilizers or antipsychotics.

Data synthesis and outcome measures

The primary outcome was recurrence/relapse rate of any
mood episode. Secondary outcomes were recurrence/relapse
recurrence/relapse rate of
rate of depressive episodes,
manic/hypomanic/mixed episodes, all-cause discontinua-
tion, and discontinuation rate due to adverse events. Other
outcomes were mortality rate and incidence of individual
adverse events. Divalproex was classiﬁed as part of the
valproate group. Deﬁnitions of
recurrence/relapses are
shown in Supplementary Table 1.

Data extraction

We analyzed the extracted data based on intention-to-treat
or modiﬁed intention-to-treat principles. When data

Based on the results of our literature search (Supplementary
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1), we planned to perform
two categorical NMAs. The ﬁrst
included (1) placebo-
controlled and head-to-head trials of monotherapy of anti-
psychotics and/or mood stabilizers, and (2) combination or
augmentation studies in which the two drugs used were
speciﬁed. The second NMA included studies in which
second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) combined with
lithium or valproate (LIT/VAL) were compared with pla-
cebo-LIT/VAL. A Bayesian NMA based on random-effects
models [10] was conducted using the netmeta package [11].
We ﬁtted random-effects frequentist NMAs, in which we
assumed a common random-effects standard deviation for
all comparisons in the network. The risk ratio (RR) and
95% credible interval (95% CI) were calculated. The het-
erogeneity standard deviation was also calculated for all
outcomes. The odds ratios and their 95% CIs were calcu-
lated for mortality rate and completed suicide rate because
incidences of these outcomes were very rare (Supplemen-
tary Appendix 1.6–1.7). We assessed network heterogeneity
using τ2 with the netmeta package. We conducted a statis-
tical evaluation of consistency using the design-by-
treatment test (globally) and the node-splitting approach
or Separate Direct from Indirect Evidence test (locally). The
Bayesian analyses also estimated rank probabilities (i.e.,
probability of each treatment obtaining each possible rank
as shown by their relative effects). The surface under the
cumulative ranking area was calculated to rank the inter-
ventions. We also performed a meta-regression analysis in
the ﬁrst NMA to examine whether some potentially con-
founding factors (e.g., publication year, duration of study,
number of total patients, percent female, and mean age)
were associated with the extent of effect on primary and
secondary outcomes. In addition to the analyses conducted
previously [7], we also performed sensitivity analyses for
primary and secondary outcomes in the ﬁrst NMA, in which
we gave only half the weight to (1) studies that included
both patients with bipolar disorder I (BDI) and with other
BD (when focusing on studies including only patients with
BDI); (2) studies that included rapid-cycling patients with
BD (when focusing on studies including only non-rapid-
cycling patients with BD because rapid-cycling BD is
considered to be more difﬁcult to stabilize than non-rapid-
cycling BD); (3) non-double-blind studies (when focusing
that were
on double-blind studies);

“enriched” (when focusing on nonenriched studies); and (5)
study arms supported by industry sponsors (when focusing
on non-industry sponsorship studies) [12]. We did not
perform meta-regression and sensitivity analyses in the
second NMA because only six studies were included. In
addition, the methodological quality of the included articles
was assessed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias cri-
teria [13]. Funnel plots were used to explore potential
publication bias. Lastly, we incorporated results into the
Conﬁdence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) applica-
tion to assess the credibility of ﬁndings from each NMA
[14]. CINeMA grades the conﬁdence in results of each
treatment comparison as high, moderate, low, or very low.

lithium+valproate, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine,
RISLAI, valproate, and placebo arms were included in the
ﬁrst NMA (32 studies and 7113 patients). Aripiprazole,
lurasidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, or ziprasidone combined
with LIT/VAL and LIT/VAL arms were included in the
second NMA (6 studies and 2498 patients).

Results of the ﬁrst network meta-analysis

Results of the ﬁrst NMA are shown in Supplementary
Appendix 1.1–1.17.

Primary and secondary outcomes

Results

Study characteristics

A ﬂow diagram of the literature search is shown in Sup-
plementary Fig. 1. We eliminated 2724 articles based on a
review of the abstract and/or title. A review of the full texts
of the remaining 59 articles resulted in the elimination of a
further 21 articles. This left 38 included in the analysis [15–
52]. Three additional studies [53–55] were identiﬁed fol-
lowing a manual search through the reference lists of the
previous review article [7]. No further studies were found in
the clinical trial registers. Although two studies included
antidepressant treatment arms [15, 28], these studies were
included in the NMA because they had both lithium arm
and placebo arm. Hence, 41 studies, including a total of
9821 patients, with mean study duration of 70.5 ±
36.6 weeks, were identiﬁed and included in this study.
Characteristics of these studies are shown in Supplementary
Table 1. The percent female was 54.1%, and the mean age
was 40.7 years. Twenty-three studies included only patients
with BDI. Just four studies included only patients who had
depressive episodes at recruitment. Sixteen studies included
patients with rapid-cycling BD and 25 studies used
enrichment designs. One perphenazine study [51] and two
risperidone long-acting injection (RISLAI) studies [43, 44]
were not included in the NMA because no arms of the study
connected to the treatment arms of other studies [51].
Detailed methodological quality analyses of the studies
based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias criteria are presented in
Supplementary Fig. 2. Three studies were open-label studies
[27, 30, 43]. Twenty-nine studies were industry-sponsored
studies. Supplementary Tables 2.1 and 2.2 show the results
of primary outcome in the individual study included in our
systematic review.

Fig. 1 Recurrence/relapse rate
of any mood episode. Drugs
were compared with placebo. To
visualize heterogeneity, we used
prediction intervals in the forest
plot. The conﬁdence level
estimated by CINeMA is shown
next to 95% PI (L: low, M:
moderate, VL: very low). 95%
CI: 95% credible interval, 95%
PI: prediction interval, CR:
conﬁdence rating, RR: risk ratio.

outperformed lamotrigine, lithium, paliperidone, quetiapine,
and valproate. Quetiapine outperformed lamotrigine.
RISLAI outperformed lamotrigine, lithium, quetiapine, and
valproate.

Asenapine, lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, and valpro-
ate were associated with lower all-cause discontinuation
compared with placebo, with RR (95% CI) ranging from
0.450 (0.270–0.750) for asenapine to 0.837 (0.725–0.966)
for lithium (29 RCTs, 6988 patients; Fig. 3a). Asenapine
outperformed aripiprazole, carbamazepine,
lamotrigine,
lithium, paliperidone, and valproate. Quetiapine was out-
performed by carbamazepine.

Only asenapine was associated with a lower dis-
continuation due to adverse events compared with placebo,
with RR (95% CI) 0.363 (0.162–0.812) (21 RCTs, 6107
patients; Fig. 3b). Lithium and lithium+valproate were
associated with higher discontinuation due to adverse
events compared with placebo, with RR (95% CI) 2.238
(1.430–3.502) and 3.651 (1.234–10.801), respectively (21
RCTs, 6107 patients; Fig. 3b). Asenapine outperformed
AOM,

pine, and RISLAI. Lamotrigine outperformed AOM, aripi-
lithium, and lithium+valproate.

T. Kishi et al.

Aripiprazole+valproate ranked ﬁrst for reduction of the
recurrence/relapse rate of any mood episode and depressive
episodes. Asenapine was selected the best drug for reducing
manic/hypomanic/mixed episodes and discontinuation due
to adverse events. Lithium+valproate had the least inci-
dence of all-cause discontinuation. Supplementary Appen-
dix 2.1–2.3 shows two-dimensional graphs of the primary
and secondary outcomes.

A signiﬁcant association between the extent of effect on the
recurrence/relapse rate of manic/hypomanic/mixed episodes
and the duration of study was detected (beta = –0.497; 95%
CI = –0.985, –0.004; p < 0.001). The heterogeneity var-
iance of the meta-regression analysis was reduced by 21%
compared with the unadjusted analysis. Although the
unadjusted analysis demonstrated that aripiprazole, aripi-
prazole+lamotrigine, and paliperidone outperformed pla-
cebo in the recurrence/relapse rate of manic/hypomanic/
mixed episodes,
these differences were not statistically
signiﬁcant in the meta-regression analysis. We did not ﬁnd
any associations between the extent of effect in primary and
other secondary outcomes and potentially confounding
factors (Supplementary Appendix 1.1–1.5).

Sensitivity analyses for primary and secondary
outcomes

Relative reduction in heterogeneity variance for recurrence/
relapse of any mood episodes for sensitivity analyses
including only non-rapid-cycling
focusing on studies
patients with BD, nonenriched studies, and those not
sponsored by industry were 29%, 21%, and 29%, respec-
tively (Supplementary Appendix 1.1). Although outcomes
with aripiprazole and aripiprazole+valproate were superior
to placebo in the unadjusted analysis, the results did not
reach statistical signiﬁcance in the sensitivity analyses. The
results of other comparisons for this outcome in the unad-
justed and sensitivity analyses were similar. We did not
detect relative reductions in heterogeneity variance for other
outcomes in any of the sensitivity analyses (Supplementary
Appendix 1.2–1.5).

Mortality rate and incidence of individual adverse

symptoms/use of

Mortality and completed suicide rates were low and similar
for all treatments. Aripiprazole was associated with a higher
incidence of
antic-
holinergic agents compared with carbamazepine. Lithium
was associated with a higher incidence of extrapyramidal
symptoms/use of anticholinergic agents compared with
placebo, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, olanzapine, and que-
tiapine. Valproate was associated with a higher incidence of
extrapyramidal symptoms/use of anticholinergic agents
compared with placebo, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and
quetiapine. Olanzapine was associated with a higher inci-
dence of somnolence compared with placebo, lamotrigine,
and lithium. Olanzapine and quetiapine were associated
with a lower incidence of insomnia compared with placebo,
lamotrigine, and lithium. RISLAI was associated with a
higher incidence of prolactin-related adverse events com-
pared with placebo. Lithium was associated with a higher
incidence of dry mouth compared with valproate, and
quetiapine was associated with a higher incidence of dry
mouth compared with placebo and valproate. Lamotrigine,
lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, valproate, and placebo were
associated with a higher incidence of headache compared
with RISLAI. Valproate was associated with a higher
incidence of headache compared with AOM. Lamotrigine
was associated with a higher incidence of nausea compared
with quetiapine. Lithium was associated with a higher
incidence of nausea compared with placebo, olanzapine,
and quetiapine. Valproate was associated with a higher
incidence of nausea compared with placebo and quetiapine.
Lithium was associated with a higher incidence of diarrhea
compared with placebo and lamotrigine.

Heterogeneity, inconsistency, and results of the ﬁrst
network meta-analysis graded using the CINeMA
system

in

certain

comparisons

Global heterogeneity was low to moderate for most out-
comes other than insomnia, dry mouth, and increased
weight (Supplementary Appendix 1.1–1.17). We also did
not detect considerable heterogeneities for most of the
outcomes
(Supplementary
Appendix 1.1–1.17). We did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant global
inconsistencies in the primary and secondary outcomes.
Percent inconsistency loops in the recurrence/relapse of
any mood episode, depressive episodes, manic/hypo-
manic/mixed episodes, all-cause discontinuation, and
discontinuation due to adverse events were: 0%, 13.6%,
9.1%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. However, we detected
global inconsistency in insomnia and increased weight.
We did not analyze global inconsistencies in prolactin-
related adverse events and dry mouth due to insufﬁcient
data. Funnel plots with fewer than ten studies might not be
meaningful. The conﬁdence in evidence was often low or
very low.

Results of the second network meta-analysis

Results of the second NMA are shown in Supplementary
Appendix 3.1–3.11. Aripiprazole+LIT/VAL,
lurasidone
+LIT/VAL, quetiapine+LIT/VAL, and ziprasidone+LIT/
VAL were superior to placebo+LIT/VAL in the recurrence/
relapse rate of any mood episode. Moreover, lurasidone+LIT/
VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL were superior to olanzapine
+LIT/VAL. Lurasidone+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/
VAL were superior to placebo+LIT/VAL in the recurrence/
relapse rate of depressive episodes, and lurasidone+LIT/VAL
and quetiapine+LIT/VAL were superior to aripiprazole+LIT/
VAL and ziprasidone+LIT/VAL. Aripiprazole+LIT/VAL
and quetiapine+LIT/VAL were superior to placebo+LIT/
VAL in the recurrence/relapse rate of manic/hypomanic/
mixed episodes, and lurasidone+LIT/VAL and quetiapine
+LIT/VAL were associated with lower all-cause dis-
continuation compared with placebo+LIT/VAL. Quetiapine
+LIT/VAL was associated with a higher incidence of som-
nolence compared with placebo+LIT/VAL. Olanzapine
+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL were associated with a
lower incidence of insomnia compared with placebo+LIT/
VAL. Olanzapine+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL were
associated with a higher incidence of increased weight com-
pared with placebo+LIT/VAL and aripiprazole+LIT/VAL.
We did not examine local heterogeneity, and global and local
inconsistency for any outcomes in the second NMA due to
insufﬁcient data. The conﬁdence in evidence of the second
NMA was very low.

Discussion

We performed a systematic review and NMAs of efﬁcacy,
acceptability, tolerability, and safety for mono- or combi-
nation therapies using mood stabilizers and/or anti-
psychotics in the treatment of adult patients with BD in the
maintenance phase. We extended a previous NMA by two
SGAs (i.e., asenapine and AOM), by investigating many
more adverse effects and by examining efﬁcacy and safety
of various combination therapies using SGA and LIT/VAL
[7]. Overall, most of the mood stabilizers and/or anti-
psychotics reduced the recurrence/relapse rates of any mood
episode. However, when examining individual mood
symptoms, both drug types appeared to be more effective
for treating mania than depression.
Aripiprazole+valproate was

for
reducing the recurrence/relapse rates of any mood episode
and depressive episodes. However, these signiﬁcances dis-
appeared during sensitivity analyses adjusting for enrich-
ment design and sponsorship. Lithium+oxcarbazepine
ranked high with respect to reducing the recurrence/relapse
rates of any mood episode (2nd), depressive episodes (2nd),
and manic/hypomanic/mixed episodes (3rd). Lamotrigine
+valproate ranked third for reducing the recurrence/relapse
rate of depressive episodes. However, these results were
based on only one small study (<50 patients in each treat-
ment arm). Lithium+valproate ranked ﬁrst for all-cause
discontinuation, based on the results of a single open-label
study. We deemed the result
inconclusive, given the
CINeMA rating showed low and very low conﬁdence levels
for these treatments.

treatment

the best

Asenapine ranked high with respect

to reducing the
recurrence/relapse rates of any mood episode (3rd), manic/
hypomanic/mixed episodes (1st), all-cause discontinuation
(3rd), and discontinuation due to adverse events (1st),
which might represent novel insights into the pharmacolo-
gical treatment of patients with BD in the maintenance
phase. Although it did not prevent recurrence/relapse of
depressive episodes, asenapine ranked ﬁfth for outcome. It
should be noted that this ranking was made from only one
26-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
of asenapine. Furthermore, asenapine carries the risk of oral
hypoesthesia [34], and this distinctive side effect makes it
difﬁcult to blind [13]; the asenapine study might therefore
be subject to performance and detection biases.

Olanzapine and quetiapine outperformed placebo in all
efﬁcacy outcomes and all-cause discontinuation. Quetiapine
results should be interpreted with caution because all the
quetiapine studies included in our meta-analysis used
enrichment designs and were industry sponsored. However,
sensitivity analyses adjusting for these factors demonstrated
that quetiapine outperformed placebo in all efﬁcacy out-
comes. Thus, olanzapine and quetiapine showed good

efﬁcacy and acceptability in adult patients with BD in the
maintenance phase. However, olanzapine and quetiapine
carry a risk of somnolence and dry mouth, respectively. The
second NMA demonstrated that combination therapies of
these SGAs with LIT/VAL also carried the risk of increased
weight.

Recent

treatment guidelines recommend lithium as a
ﬁrst-line drug for the treatment of adult patients with BD in
the maintenance phase [6, 56, 57]. The numbers of studies
and patients treated with lithium were the largest among the
active drugs included in our study (19 studies and 1335
patients). A recent meta-review including RCTs and non-
RCTs reported that
lithium had anti-suicidal effects for
patients with psychiatric disorders including BD [58],
although our meta-analysis did not show this effect. Our
meta-analysis demonstrated that lithium outperformed pla-
cebo in all efﬁcacy outcomes; however, it did not rank
highly for the outcomes. Although lithium outperformed
placebo
lithium
increased discontinuation due to adverse events, and carried
risks of extrapyramidal symptoms/use of anticholinergic
agents, nausea, and diarrhea. However, given only 17 of 19
lithium studies included in our meta-analysis did not use
enrichment designs, most patients assigned lithium included
in our meta-analysis were not evaluated for efﬁcacy,
acceptability, tolerability, and safety of lithium prior to the
assignment. However, sensitivity analysis of enrichment
designs using the design-adjusted model demonstrated
similar results to the unadjusted analysis. Accordingly, we
concluded that lithium still had beneﬁts for patients with
BD in the maintenance phase, providing that due care is
taken of its side effects.

discontinuation,

regarding

all-cause

A Finnish nationwide cohort of 18,018 patients with BD
(mean follow-up time = 7.2 years) demonstrated that
lithium and long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics
were effective in preventing hospitalization due to mental or
physical illness compared with no drug use [59]. Unlike the
results of our meta-analysis, the study indicated that lithium
was superior to other mood stabilizers and that LAI anti-
psychotics are markedly better than identical oral formula-
tions of antipsychotics. Quetiapine (most widely used in the
study population) showed only an 8% risk reduction. Thus,
there appear to be inconsistencies between the results of our
meta-analysis, which included RCTs (providing the most
robust evidence), and those of the cohort study (reﬂecting
“real-world” routine clinical practice). We could not simply
compare results between the studies for the following rea-
sons [59, 60]. First, the study durations of RCTs are gen-
erally shorter than those of non-RCT studies. Second, the
symptoms of trial populations are evaluated in more detail
than those of patient populations in clinical practice. Hence,
symptoms might be detected earlier, and earlier intervention
given to trial populations than to patients in clinical

practice. Third, because RCTs often have stringent inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria (e.g., excluding patients with the
most comorbidities and the highest severity of illness, such
as suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt), trial populations
are often not representative of those in clinical practice.

Our study has several limitations. First, the conﬁdence in
evidence of the ﬁrst NMA was often low or very low. In the
primary outcome, conﬁdence levels were deemed to be low
or very low in 90.8% of comparisons with placebo. Second,
we did not perform the inconsistency test for dry mouth and

In conclusion, our study represents the most compre-
hensive evidence currently available to guide the initial
choice of pharmacological treatment for adult patients with
BD in the maintenance phase. Clinicians and patients
should consider the maintenance phase when selecting the
treatment for the acute phase of BD.
