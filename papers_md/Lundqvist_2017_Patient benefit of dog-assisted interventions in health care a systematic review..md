Patient benefit of dog-assisted
interventions in health care:
a systematic review
Martina Lundqvist1*, Per Carlsson1, Rune Sjödahl2, Elvar Theodorsson3 and Lars-Åke Levin1

Abstract

Background: Dogs are the most common companion animal, and therefore not surprisingly a popular choice for
animal-assisted interventions. Dog-assisted interventions are increasingly used in healthcare. The aim of the review
was to conduct a systematic literature review of quantitative studies on dog-assisted interventions in healthcare,
with the intention of assessing the effects and cost-effectiveness of the interventions for different categories
of patients.
Methods: A systematic review of the scientific literature reporting results of studies in healthcare, nursing home or
home care settings, was conducted. The inclusion criteria applied for this review were: quantitative studies,
inclusion of at least 20 study subjects, existence of a control and performed in healthcare settings including nursing
homes and home care. The electronic databases PubMed, AMED, CINAHL and Scopus were searched from their
inception date through January 2017, for published articles from peer-reviewed journals with full text in English.

Results: Eighteen studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and were judged to be of at least moderate quality,
were included in the analysis. Three of them showed no effect. Fifteen showed at least one significant positive
effect but in most studied outcome measures there was no significant treatment effect. Dog-assisted therapy had
the greatest potential in treatment of psychiatric disorders among both young and adult patients. Dog-assisted
activities had some positive effects on health, wellbeing, depression and quality of life for patients with severe
cognitive disorders. Dog-assisted support had positive effects on stress and mood.

Conclusions: The overall assessment of the included studies indicates minor to moderate effects of dog-assisted
therapy in psychiatric conditions, as well as for dog-assisted activities in cognitive disorders and for dog-assisted
support in different types of medical interventions. However, the majority of studied outcome measures showed no
significant effect.

Background
Interaction with animals has been a favorite human
pursuit since the dawn of history. Numerous studies
have reported that animals exert favorable effects on
psychological, physiological and social aspects of human
wellbeing [1]. The increasing use of animals in health
and social care is therefore not surprising.

Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) are more or less
goal oriented and structured interventions that intentionally
incorporate animals in health, education and human service
for the purpose of therapeutic gains and improved health
three sub-
and wellness [2]. AAI usually consists of
(AAT), Animal-
categories; Animal-Assisted Therapy
Assisted Education (AAE) and Animal-Assisted Activities
(AAA). These concepts are defined in a slightly different
way by various organizations. According to the Inter-
national Association of Human-Animal Interaction Organi-
zations (IAHAIO), AAT is a goal oriented, planned and

structured therapeutic intervention directed and/or deliv-
ered by health, education and human service professionals,
and intervention progress is measured and included in pro-
fessional documentation [3]. According to the American
Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), the definition
AAT should also be an integral part of the treatment
process [4]. Most definitions of AAA differ from AAT in
several aspects; the absence of specific treatment goals,
delivery by volunteers, spontaneous visit content and no
obligation to document. According to the IAHAIO defin-
ition, AAA is a “planned and goal oriented informal inter-
action and visitation conducted by the human-animal team
for motivational, educational and recreational purposes.
Human-animal teams must have received at least introduc-
tory training, preparation and assessment to participate in
informal visitations.” [3]. Another difference between AAT
and AAA seems to be the purpose, which is more focused
on wellbeing in AAA and on health improvement in AAT.
We also understand that AAA could be provided by differ-
ent degrees of integration with a formal treatment process.
However, this leads us to conclude that there are no estab-
lished definitions and that there is no clear division between
AAT and AAA.

Dogs are the most common companion animal and
therefore not surprisingly a popular choice for AAI [1].
They are keen observers of human reactions through their
exceptional ability to read signs of will and emotion from
human faces [5]. They also exhibit a behavior that humans
interpret as happy, friendly and affectionate which makes
them suitable to be used in interventions with a thera-
peutic aim [1]. This review is therefore delimited to inter-
ventions with dogs as the assisting animal, transposing the
term AAT to the corresponding Dog-Assisted Therapy
(DAT) and AAA to Dog-Assisted Activity (DAA).

In our review we have identified another relevant sub-
category to Dog-Assisted Interventions (DAI), namely
Dog-Assisted Support (DAS). DAS is delivered by a
trained health care professional or a volunteer, within
the scope of the professionals’ practice, in order to have
alleviating or distracting effects during short
term
diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. In our opinion,
DAS deserves to be a separate category since DAS in
contrast to DAA has a specific diagnostic or therapeutic
intention, especially in reducing anxiety and stress both
in diagnostic and therapeutic contexts, but compared to
DAT, DAS has no specific therapeutic goal. Rather, DAS
focuses on reduced anxiety and quality of life with indir-
ect effect to facilitate a regular treatment process. Figure
1 illustrates our identified categories.

Previous reviews of DAI studies [6–10] have focused
exclusively on single conditions or on specific po-
pulations. In this review we have included various condi-
tions without any limitation of the characteristics of the
population, except for sample size.

Aim
The aim of the review was to conduct a systematic
literature review of quantitative studies on dog-assisted
interventions in healthcare, with the intention of asses-
sing the effects and cost-effectiveness of the interven-
tions for different categories of patients.

Method
Search methods for identification of studies
Studies were identified by searching the electronic data-
bases PubMed, AMED, CINAHL and Scopus from their
inception date through January 2017. Some of
the
included studies were identified outside standard data-
base searches (e.g. hand searching reference lists from
included articles and systematic reviews).

We searched for various terms of DAI and outcomes.

The search was conducted as presented in Table 1.

Selection of studies
The inclusion criteria applied in the review were deter-
mined before the initial literature search. The first four

criteria were a consequence of the scope of the study.
The last
three criteria were determined by the re-
search group as basic quality criteria to be fulfilled.
The inclusion criteria;

(cid:1) Studies of DAI performed in healthcare settings

including nursing homes and home care.

(cid:1) Studies collecting primary data.
(cid:1) Quantitative studies (i.e. measuring outcomes with

numerical scales).

(cid:1) Separate result presentation of effects.
(cid:1) At least 20 study subjects.
(cid:1) Existence of a control.
(cid:1) Published articles from peer-reviewed journals with

full text in English.

One of the authors (ML) conducted the initial search
in May 2016, as well as a second search in September
2016 and a third search in January 2017. All the titles
and abstracts from the identified studies were examined
to determine the relevance of the articles. If the title and
abstract met with the inclusion criteria the study passed
on to the next stage of the review process. Studies with
insufficient information in title and abstract were also
included in the next stage of the review process. The
studies that remained after the initial selection, were
read in full to confirm eligibility and determine quality.

Review of quality
Pairs of authors independently read the articles in full to
assess eligibility and to determine the quality. Traditional
criteria for judgment of scientific quality were used, in-
cluding; adequate control group(s), control of confounders,
randomization, adequately described experimental design,
and relevant measured outcome variables [11, 12]. The
quality of the studies was rated as high, moderate or low. A
study determined as being of high quality had to fulfill all
the above mentioned criteria and a study determined as
being of moderate quality had to fulfill most of the above
mentioned criteria. When a study was determined as being
of low quality it failed to fulfill several of the above men-
tioned criteria or had major shortcomings in some of the
criteria. Studies rated as moderate or high were included in
the analysis. Studies rated as low quality were excluded, but
are presented with a comment in an additional file (see
Additional file 1). For the included studies the following
data was extracted and gathered into a structured table; ref-
erence, characteristics of patients (age, gender, condition),
type of study, type of intervention, study period, sample size,
outcomes, author conclusion, and scientific quality rating.

Categorization
To establish in what context DAIs have effect we catego-
rized the interventions as therapeutic (DAT), activating

(DAA) or supportive (DAS) intervention, based on the
criteria presented in Table 2.

Results
Results of the search
The result of the search is illustrated in the flow chart in
Fig. 2. It resulted in 1445 unique articles (after duplicate
removal). Another 28 studies were included through
other sources. Based on the information in the title and
the abstract 1402 articles did not meet the eligibility cri-
teria and were therefore excluded. The main reason for
early exclusion was that the article did not scope DAI.
Additionally, 53 articles were excluded after reading the
full text. Of these 53 articles, 28 were excluded since
they did not meet the inclusion criteria and 25 were ex-
cluded due to low quality [13–58] (see Additional file 1).
Finally, 18 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and
were judged to be of at least moderate quality, were in-
cluded in the final analysis. None of the studies were con-
sidered to be of high quality. A summary of the 18 studies
included in the final analysis is presented in Tables 3 and 4.

Included studies
The included studies were published in the time period
1997–2016. Countries of the corresponding authors that
were represented were USA (8 studies), Italy (4 studies),
Australia, Columbia, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Spain
(1 study each).

Seventy-eight percent of the studies were randomized
controlled trials. Two studies were cohort studies with a
pre-post
intervention. One study adopted a within-
subject, time series design and one used a crossover
design.

Studied patients
The number of patients included in the studies varied,
between 23 and 100. Eleven studies had 20–40, four had
41–60, two had 61–80, and one had 81–100 patients
(Table 3). In 11 of the 18 studies the patients were
adults. The remaining studies included children and ad-
olescents. The gender distributions favored women, 14
of the 18 studies had >50% women.

Studied disorders
Studies on cognitive disorders dominated the selected
studies [38–44]. In four studies the patient conditions
were psychiatric disorders, of which three included
children or adolescents with psychiatric disorders and
one included patients cared for in institutions due to
[45–48]. Six studies examined
psychiatric disorders
stress and mood [49–54]. Target symptoms and diseases
were children undergoing physical examination, chil-
dren undergoing dental procedure, children undergoing
venipuncture, patients with cancer and older adults. In

one study the intervention was preformed to reduce pain
for patients undergoing total knee joint arthroplasty [55].

Studied controls
In all studies expect two, the control treatment was a
visit, series of visits, a therapy session or series of ther-
apy sessions without a dog. In the study by Thodberg et
al. the controls were either a visit from a person bringing
a robot seal or a visit from a person bringing a soft-toy
cat [44]. In the study by Bono et al. the control group re-
ceived no active intervention [41].

Outcomes
The studies included a variety of outcome measures and
instruments (Table 4), physiological parameters e.g. blood
pressure, heart rate, cortisol
in saliva, skin temperature;
disease specific measures e.g. dementia mood assessment
scale, geriatric depression scale, Cohen-Mansfield agitation
inventory; general functional measures e.g. observation scale
of behavioral distress, profile of mood states, self-perceived
health questionnaire, orientation to life questionnaire;
generic health related quality of life measures e.g. EQ-5D,
quality of life in late-stage dementia; and other measure-
ments including e.g. sleep data, body mass index, and ordin-
ary school attendance. In the column ‘Outcomes of DAI’
(Table 4) we have summarized the outcome changes for the
different studies, based on statistical significance.

Table 5 shows the number of studies with at least one
statistically significant positive outcome measure divided
by patient condition and intervention category.

Cognitive disorders
Seven trials studied cognitive disorders and were all
categorized as DAA [38–44]. They differed in terms of
patient population severity, which varied from mild
cognitive impairment to severe dementia. In all studies
multiple sessions were used during periods varying in
length from 6 to 32 weeks. The number of sessions
varied between 12 and 72, and the length of sessions
were 10–90 min.

structured intervention [38, 42, 44]. In Majic et al.,
Olsen et al. and Travers et al. the control group was
treated as usual [39, 40, 43]. In the study conducted by
Bono et al. the control group received no active inter-
vention [41].

Two of the studies showed some decrease in depres-
sion specific instruments [40, 42]. Travers et al. showed
that patients with worse baseline depression scores in
the DAA group, significantly improved depression scores
in comparison to the control group. They also found
significant improvements in quality of life in one of the
facilities studied, but these results were confounded by
an outbreak of gastroenteritis with subsequent signifi-
cant decrease in QoL in another unit [40]. In the Fried-
man et al. study, depression decreased significantly in
the DAA group after three months but not
in the
control group [42]. In the study by Olsen et al. patients
with severe dementia in the DAA group had an im-
proved quality of
life at follow up [43]. Bono et al.
showed a significant difference in reduction of functional
status between the DAA group and the control group
after eight months. In the DAA group, the development
of cognitive impairment also slowed up in comparison
to the control group [41]. In Thodberg et al. the sessions
lasted only 10 min and the control group were activated
with a robot seal or a soft toy cat. They found no effect
in measures of depression [44]. Also in Lutwack et al.
the patients only received short sessions, the results
showed no effect in measures of depression but a signifi-
cant improvement in mood for those receiving visits
from a therapy dog [38].

Concerning cognitive disorder, we conclude that the
included studies differed in terms of severity of patient
conditions, and in particular in the characteristics of
DAA and the activity offered to the control group. Given
these differences, treatment of cognitive disorders in a
nursing home setting may result in some positive effects
on health and wellbeing, most likely on depression and
on quality of life for patients with severe dementia.

The studies also differed regarding control group treat-
ments. In Friedman et al., Thodberg et al. and Lutwack
et al. the control group participants were given another

Psychiatric disorders
The four trials that studied psychiatric disorders were all
categorized as DAT, and were randomized in a pre-post

experimental design. Three of the included studies in-
vestigated patients in child and adolescent psychiatry
[45, 46, 48], and one studied patients from adult psych-
iatry [47]. All of the studies comprised 12 week DAT
programs in different settings except for the study con-
ducted by Calvo et al., where the intervention lasted
24 weeks [47].

out DAT in children with ADHD [45]. In the study by

al.

All three studies of young patients with psychiatric
disorder showed that DAT resulted in significant im-
provements on different psychometric scales and mea-
sures [45, 46, 48]. The two DAT studies, studying young
patients with acute mental disorders, found improve-
ments in global functioning, school attendance, as well
as self-reported emotional-behavioral symptoms [46, 48].
DAT in ADHD children resulted in a greater reduction
in the severity of ADHD symptoms in comparison to
cognitive-behavioral
interventions without DAT [45].
Calvo et al. showed that after 24 weeks of rehabilitation
the DAT group had no benefit on the Positive and Nega-
tive Syndrome Scale (PANSS), but in comparison with
conventional rehabilitation, a significant reduction of
negative symptomatology, a higher adherence to the
program, and cortisol reduction were found after the
DAT sessions [47].

In summary, all studies of DAT in psychiatric disor-
ders showed significant reductions in symptoms, and
higher program adherence.

Stress and mood
Seven trials studied stress and mood, five of them were
categorized as DAS and two as DAA. Nagengast et al.,
Hansen et al. and Havener et al. examined effects of
DAS on physiological and behavioral distress among
children undergoing a physical examination or a dental
procedure [50, 51]. Vagnoli et al. studied the effects of
DAS in children undergoing venipuncture [53]. Johnson
et al. conducted a study in a radiation oncology unit
examining effects of DAA among patients undergoing
non-palliative radiation therapy [52]. Krause-Parello et
al. [54] investigated changes in older adult’s cardiovascu-
lar health before and after a DAA.

In the study by Nagengast et al. the children were
exposed to two examinations, one with and one without
a dog present [49]. In Hansen et al., Havener et al. and
Vagnoli et al. the children underwent a procedure with

or without the presence of a dog [50, 51, 53]. In the
study by Johnson et al. two control groups were con-
structed, one receiving visits from a human person and
one where the patients read magazines [52]. In the study
by Krause-Parello et al. all patients received two visits;
one with and one without a dog [54].

In four of the six studies, the populations studied were
children and the number of sessions was limited to one
[49–51, 53]. Both Nagengast et al. and Hansen et al.
found lower stress levels during physical examination
when a dog was present, compared to not present, mea-
sured with the Observation Scale of Behavioral Distress
(OSBD) [49, 50]. In addition, Nagengast et al. reported a
statistically significant decrease in mean arterial and sys-
tolic blood pressure, heart rate and behavioral distress in
the presence of a dog [49]. Vagnoli et al. also reported sig-
nificant lower stress levels measured with OSBD, when a
dog was present,
in children undergoing venipuncture
[53]. They also found significant lower levels of serum cor-
tisol plasma in the intervention group compared with the
control group [53]. The study conducted by Havener et
al., examining children undergoing a dental procedure,
was very similar to the other studies but showed no sig-
nificant effects [51]. The study conducted by Johnson et
al. differed from the other studies. They investigated the
effects of DAA during a four-week period, including 12
sessions on adults undergoing non-palliative radiation
therapy. They found no effects of DAA [52]. The study by
Krause-Parello et al. also differed from the other studies
[54]. The study was conducted on older adult patients
living at home who did not have any specific condition.
The results implied a greater decrease in systolic blood
pressure when visited by a dog compared to a human
person. From the results they also predicted more of a
decrease in heart rate during the DAA compared with the
conventional intervention [54].

In summary, four out of six studies showed at least
one significant positive effect. Taken together, these find-
ings suggest that particular DAS may reduce stress and
positively affect the mood.

Pain
Harper et al. studied the role of DAS in postoperative
recovery in patients after total
joint arthroplasty [55].
Patients in the intervention group received a 15-min
visit from a dog before the patient underwent physical
therapy over a three-day period. The control group
underwent physical therapy without any changes to nor-
mal routine. Patients in the intervention group reported
a significant reduction of pain measured with the visual
analog scale (VAS) compared with the control group
[55]. Like the other studies categorized as supportive in-
terventions reporting positive effects, the study included
few and short sessions.

Discussion
Even though there is a growing number of studies re-
ported on use of animals in healthcare, the evidence
base appears weak, partly due to studies including a
limited number of participants. Previous reviews of AAI
studies have focused exclusively on a single condition or
a specific population. This review was delimited to dogs
used as the assisting animal in a health care setting but
without any limitation of the characteristics of the po-
pulation. The studies fulfilling our selection criteria
included diverse conditions and outcome measures. The
findings were not consistent, and studies of cost-
effectiveness were lacking.

Substantial differences were observed in the manner in
which DAI was applied. Three major categories of inter-
ventions were identified; those used for therapeutic pur-
pose, those used for activating purpose and those used
as support during a procedure. Even if we were unable
to draw firm conclusions regarding specific applications
from the studies included in the current review, some
promising results were seen. DAT seemed to be most
substantial
in treatment of psychiatric disorders both
among young and adult patients. DAA appeared to have
some positive effects on health and wellbeing as well as
life in severe
an effect on depression and quality of
cognitive disorders. We also found that DAS may have
positive effects on stress and mood.

Previous systematic reviews of the scientific literature
regarding the use of DAI in health care settings showed
some evidence of patient benefit. However, many reviews
included a mix of animals and only a handful focused
exclusively on DAI. One review of therapy dogs for chil-
included four
dren with autism spectrum disorders,
studies on DAI in health care. It concluded that the re-
sults were encouraging but further research with better
designs and larger samples were needed [56]. Another
review of AAT in treatment of similar patient material
included fourteen studies with different kinds of animals.
Seven of these studies involved dogs and showed posi-
tive outcomes. However, most studies included were
connected with methodological weaknesses [8]. The
evidence base seemed to be better for the use of DAI for
residents of
long-term care facilities. Cipriani et al.
showed that 12 of 19 studies reported statistically signifi-
cant outcomes [57]. Even though there is some system-
atic, and a substantial amount of anecdotal evidence for
the effects of animals as interventions in health care, the
evidence base seems to be relatively weak.

Overall, in all the included studies, DAIs were offered
in combination with regular medical treatment, which
means that the control group always received regular
treatment. In general though, we found that the included
studies were fraught with numerous obstacles and con-
lack of proper control
founding factors. For example,

group and lack of a proper control activity, were com-
mon. Also, most studies had not attempted to investi-
gate the impact of the dog handler. Besides that, there
were natural difficulties in randomization due to patient
preferences, fears and possible allergies. Given all the
challenges mentioned above, it was a matter of concern
that the number of participants was generally too small
to minimize the effects of the multitude of lack of con-
trol and confounding factors involved. It is possible, and
even likely, that matters of suboptimal study designs
may explain some of the observed differences in the
effects of DAI. It is also likely that the limited number of
subjects included in most of the studies explained the
non-statistically significant effects (type II statistical
error). It is also possible that the instruments used in
the studies for measuring treatment effects did not
optimally measure the effect of all important aspects of
increased wellbeing. Studies of DAI is evidently challen-
ging regarding research design, since none of the studies
we selected fulfilled our criteria of “high quality”.

Only 18 studies were included in the review as a
primary basis for our conclusions. This limited number
may be due to the strict criteria applied by us, to poor
study designs, or both. One weakness with our review
may be that we excluded studies with less than 20
participants. It is possible that there exist studies based
on small samples that could be judged to have at least
moderate quality. There is also a possibility that we have
wrongly classified one or several studies, but that would
hardly affect our conclusion. Another weakness of a
review linked to inclusion criteria, is the limitation of
including only published articles from peer-reviewed jour-
nals with full text in English. This is a common delimita-
tion due to a lack of resources, but of course a weakness.

Conclusion
The overall assessment of the included studies indicates
minor to moderate effects of dog-assisted therapy in
psychiatric conditions, as well as for dog-assisted activ-
ities in cognitive disorders and for dog-assisted support
interventions. However,
in different types of medical
the majority of studied outcome measures showed no
significant effect.
