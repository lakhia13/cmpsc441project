Abstract

Introduction.—Pain is a cardinal symptom of chronic pancreatitis (CP). Using PROMIS 
measures, we characterized physical and mental health and symptom profiles of a well-defined 
cohort of individuals with CP and compared them to controls. Among patients with CP, we also 
examined associations between pain (intensity, temporal nature) and PROMIS symptom profiles 
and the prevalence of clinically significant psychological comorbidities.

Methods.—We analyzed baseline data in 488 CP patients and 254 controls enrolled in 
PROCEED, an ongoing longitudinal cohort study. Participants completed the PROMIS-Global 
Health, which captures global physical and mental health, and the PROMIS-29 profile which 
captures seven symptom domains. Self-reported pain was categorized by severity (none, mild-
moderate, severe) and temporal nature (none, intermittent, constant). Demographic and clinical 
data were obtained from the PROCEED database.

Results.—Pain was significantly associated with impairments in physical and mental health. 
Compared with participants with no pain, CP participants with severe pain (but not mild-moderate 
pain) had more decrements in each PROMIS domain in multivariable models (effect sizes: 2.54–
7.03), and higher prevalence of clinically significant depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance and 
physical disability (odds ratios, ORs: 2.11–4.74). Similar results were noted for constant pain (but 
not intermittent pain) for PROMIS domains (effect sizes: 4.08–10.37), and clinically significant 
depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance and physical disability (ORs: 2.80–5.38).

Conclusions.—Severe and constant pain are major drivers for poor psychological and physical 
health in CP. Systematic evaluation and management of psychiatric comorbidities and sleep 
disturbance should be incorporated into routine management of patients with CP.

INTRODUCTION.

Page 3

Abdominal pain is common symptom (~90%) in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) 
that can be debilitating and difficult to treat1. Opioid medications are frequently used for 
managing pain1, but too often lead to dependence and side effects. While treatments such 
as endoscopic and surgical therapies provide durable pain relief in a subset, many patients 
continue to live with chronic daily pain1, 2. As a result, pain remains the most frequent 
reason for inpatient and outpatient care1.

Prior studies have demonstrated that constant pain (vs. intermittent pain) in CP is associated 
with higher pain severity, greater use of opioids, and lower quality of life (QOL)2. 
For example, in one recent study, constant pain, use of opioids, and alcohol etiology 
were associated with low QOL, but these variables accounted for a small amount of 
overall variance3. Psychological and behavioral comorbidities are common in individuals 
with chronic pain conditions4, 5, including CP6. Psychological comorbidities can also be 
sustained by ongoing pain, which has been shown to exacerbate symptoms of anxiety, 
depression, and sleep disturbance, resulting in a mutually maintaining effect7–9. Studies 
investigating psychologic comorbidities in patients with CP have found that patients with 
anxiety or depression reported higher pain prevalence, pain severity and pain interference 
as well as reduced global health and QOL6. However, the broader prevalence of these 
and related psychological and behavioral comorbidities, like sleep disturbance and social 
functioning has not been examined in CP. Sleep quality and fatigue are highly associated 
with pain and disability in other conditions,4, 5, 8 and this represents an important knowledge 
gap in CP.

Using a cross-sectional analysis of an ongoing cohort study, our aims were to: 1) 
compare global health and symptom profiles using Patient Reported Outcome Measurement 
Information System (PROMIS) measures, specifically Global health, Anxiety, Depression, 
Sleep Disturbance, Pain Interference, Fatigue, Physical Function, and Social Role 
Participation in patients with CP and a healthy comparison group; 2) among patients with 
CP, examine associations between pain (intensity, temporal nature) and PROMIS symptom 
profiles; and 3) among patients with CP, examine associations between pain (intensity, 
temporal nature) and the prevalence of clinically significant psychological and behavioral 
comorbidities. Based on prior literature, we hypothesized that patients with CP would have 
worse global health and symptom profiles compared to the control group. Within the CP 
group, we hypothesized that more intense pain or constant pain would be associated with 
worse global health and higher rate of clinically significant psychological comorbidities10.

METHODS.

Study population

Page 4

We analyzed data from Prospective Evaluation of Chronic Pancreatitis for Epidemiologic 
and Translational Studies (PROCEED), an ongoing, multicenter, prospective longitudinal 
cohort study of CP in the United States (NCT03099850), sponsored by the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH)11. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards 
of each of the participating institutions and the Coordinating and Data Management Center. 
Informed consent was provided by participants before any study procedures.

The current analysis included 488 participants with definite CP and 254 controls without 
pancreatic disease enrolled from June 2017 to May 2020 who completed PROMIS measures. 
CP was defined by the presence of Cambridge stage 3–4 findings or pancreatic parenchymal 
or ductal stones on cross-sectional imaging or histologic evidence of CP11. A designated 
radiologist at each institution reviewed imaging studies according to a standardized 
protocol12, which has been demonstrated to achieve a high level of concordance for cohort 
assignment13. Selection and eligibility for control subjects is reported in Supplementary 
Data.

Clinical data

Detailed demographic and clinical data were prospectively collected from participants 
using standardized questionnaires and from physicians using structured case report forms. 
Participants with CP indicated if they experienced abdominal pain related to pancreatitis 
in the year preceding enrollment. Those with a positive response provided information on 
the severity and temporal nature of pain using five predefined choices, which were used to 
categorize participants based on pain severity (no pain, mild-moderate pain, severe pain) and 
temporal nature (no pain, intermittent pain, constant pain) as previously reported14.

PROMIS measures

PROMIS is an NIH-funded initiative which has developed valid and precise measures 
for approximately 70 distinct health domains that can be used without a contract and is 
available free of charge15. PROMIS measures employ a T-score metric that is anchored to 
the estimated U.S. general population mean of 50 (SD=10), such that individual scores are 
not only comparable across distinct clinical populations through a common reference point, 
but are also readily interpretable as percentiles in a normal distribution. A substantial body 
of evidence documents the validity and reliability of the PROMIS measures across diverse 
clinical populations16.

At enrollment, the PROMIS Global Health Version 1.2 and PROMIS-29 Profile Version 
2.0 instruments were self-administered to study participants via paper questionnaires. The 
PROMIS Global Health instrument consists of 10 questions, the responses to which are used 
to generate physical and mental component scores. The PROMIS-29 instrument consists 
of 29 questions which assess subdomains of Anxiety, Depression, Sleep Disturbance, Pain 
Interference, Fatigue, Physical Function, and Social Role Participation17. Response options

range from 1–5 (e.g., Never/Not at all to Always/Very much), and raw sum scores are 
calculated by adding together responses to all items within a domain.

Statistical Procedures

For each domain (two for PROMIS Global health, seven for PROMIS 29), T-scores 
were calculated using sum score to T-score tables according to recommended protocols17. 
From PROMIS 29 scores, we calculated the percentage of participants who had clinically 
relevant symptoms (moderate-severe symptoms) using recommended cut points of T >60 for 
negatively worded concepts (high or very high anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance) and 
T <40 for positively worded concepts (low or very-low physical function)18. T-scores for 
the domains, and percentage of participants with moderate-severe symptoms of depression, 
anxiety, sleep disturbance, and low physical function were compared between participants 
with CP and controls, and again within the CP cohort after stratification by severity and 
temporal nature of pain.

One-way ANOVAs, t-tests, or Chi-squared tests were applied to examine the between group 
difference on continuous and categorical outcomes respectively. Mean differences or odds 
ratios (OR) were calculated as appropriate, with 95% confidence intervals. Cohen’s d was 
used to estimate effect sizes. Ordinary least squares regression was applied to examine the 
independent association of CP (versus controls) with each of the nine PROMIS domains 
separately, adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates (age, sex, race, ethnicity, 
body mass index [BMI], education, marital status, employment status, income, current 
smoking and drinking). Similar regressions were then applied to the CP cohort to examine 
the adjusted effects of differing level of pain severity as well as temporal nature of 
pain, controlling for these and additional covariates (alcohol etiology, diabetes, exocrine 
dysfunction, calcifications on imaging studies, pancreatitis duration, prior endoscopic 
treatment, surgery and Charlson comorbidity index). Standard model diagnostics were used 
to ensure proper model fit. There were sporadic missing data in covariates. Mean (for 
continuous covariates) or mode (for categorical covariates) imputation was used when there 
were fewer than 10 missing values; for categorical variables with 10 or more missing 
values (e.g., annual income), a separate category was created and included in the model 
for adjustment. The study used the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for cross-sectional studies.19

When compared with controls, participants with CP were significantly older, more likely 
to be white, non-Hispanic, have a low or normal BMI, current cigarette smokers and less 
likely to be current drinkers (Table 1). Significant differences were also noted in education, 
employment and income with the CP group having lower socioeconomic indicators than 
the control group. Alcohol was attributed as the primary etiology for CP in 42.5% 
participants, 43.6% had diabetes, 42.4% had exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and 73.8% 
had calcifications. Abdominal pain in the preceding year was reported by 84% participants 
with CP, over half rated their pain as severe (58.6%), and 45.7% as constant (Table 1).

Global Health and Symptom Profiles in CP vs. controls

As hypothesized, participants with CP had significantly lower global health than controls 
with larger differences observed in Global Physical Health and Global Mental Health 
representing 1.2 and 0.8 standard deviations difference, respectively (eTable 2). Similarly, on 
univariate analysis, participants with CP had significant impairment in each of the physical, 
mental, and social health domains that comprise the PROMIS 29 profile (all p<0.001, 
Cohen’s d range: 0.88–2.10) as shown in Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1.

In adjusted regression analyses, the presence of CP was independently associated with a 
reduction of 7.15 points in PROMIS Global Physical Health and 3.13 points in Global 
Mental Health (p<0.001). With respect to PROMIS 29 symptom profiles, significant 
differences were observed in participants with CP compared to controls (range=2.95–
7.01 points) with the largest differences in fatigue, followed by pain interference, sleep 
disturbance, social roles, physical function, anxiety and depression (Table 2). Notably, 
across all domains, between 24–52% of the variance in QOL scores was explained by CP 
and relevant covariates included in the models.

Associations of Pain Severity and Temporality with Physical, Mental, and Social Health in 
CP

Regarding Global Health and the PROMIS 29, progressively larger differences were 
noted between the no pain, mild-moderate, and severe pain categories (Figure 1 and 
Supplementary Table 2). Adjusted comparisons from multivariable regression models 
indicated that differences between the no pain and the mild-moderate pain groups were 
not significant (Table 3). In contrast, large decrements were observed for participants with 
severe pain with the largest in pain interference (60.9±10.3), fatigue (56.5±10.0), and 
physical function (43.8±9.3). Adjusted comparisons from multivariable regression models 
indicated significant effects of severe pain (vs. no pain group) in all PROMIS domains 
(range: 2.54–7.03 points).

Summary scores for PROMIS Global Health and the PROMIS 29 also differed based 
on temporality of pain (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 2). Adjusted estimates from 
multivariable regression models indicated that differences between the no pain and the 
intermittent pain groups were not significant (Table 3). However, large deficits were 
observed for those in the constant pain group in Global Physical Health (37.6±7.2), Global 
Mental Health (42.7±8.7), and each of the PROMIS-29 domains, with the largest in pain 
interference (64.1±8.4), fatigue (59.1±9.2), and physical function (41.6±8.7). Adjusted 
effects of constant pain (vs. no pain group) from multivariable regression models were 
statistically significant for all PROMIS domains (range: 4.08–10.37).

Prevalence of moderate-severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, problematic sleep, and 
low physical function

A significantly higher proportion of participants with CP (vs. controls, all p<0.001) met or 
exceeded thresholds indicative of moderate-severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, sleep 
disturbance, and low physical function (range of ORs 9.92–19.36) (Figure 2, Supplementary 
Table 3). Comparisons among CP subgroups indicated that rates of clinically significant

comorbidities in participants with no pain were not statistically significant from participants 
with mild-moderate pain (range of ORs: 0.83–1.62, all p>0.05), and those with intermittent 
pain (range of ORs: 0.81–1.44, all p>0.05). In contrast, when compared with participants 
with no pain, the rate of comorbidities was between 2.11–4.74 times greater in participants 
with CP who had severe pain and between 2.79–5.38 times greater in participants with 
CP who had constant pain (Figure 2, Supplementary Table 4); these results are statistically 
significant at 0.05 level as the 95% confidence intervals did not cover 1.

DISCUSSION.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to use PROMIS profile measures to characterize 
physical, mental, and social health in patients with CP. We noted significant decrements 
in all PROMIS domains in patients with CP when compared to controls. We found that 
presence of either severe or constant pain was a major factor associated with reduction 
in global health and all symptom domains. A sizeable subgroup of patients with CP 
demonstrated clinically significant psychological and behavioral comorbidities including 
anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and physical disability, with the highest rates among 
patients with either severe or constant pain. Our findings support ongoing research into 
the effective management of pain in CP, as well as the need for a broader approach to 
incorporate evaluation and treatment of psychological and behavioral comorbidities.

We observed a dose-response relationship between pain and decrement in health status such 
that patients with no, mild-moderate, and intermittent pain have little impairment while 
those with severe or constant pain had significant impairments. As a group, patients with 
CP reported significantly greater psychological and behavioral comorbidities than controls. 
Raw and adjusted differences in physical, mental, and social health between controls and 
CP consistently exceeded and often doubled or tripled validated thresholds of minimal 
clinically important differences in PROMIS measures20. However the largest drivers of 
differences in health status and prevalence estimates of clinically significant psychologic 
and behavioral comorbidities in CP were severe pain and constant pain, suggesting the 
sustained effect of ongoing pain on health status is greater than intermittent disruptions. As 
observed in multiple patient populations21, chronic pain can become increasingly complex 
over time in its pathophysiology, maintaining psychosocial and functional consequences and 
compounding costs to patients, making pain more difficult to manage.

In the absence of local complications, patients with significant burden of abdominal 
pain symptoms who have pancreatic duct obstruction from stones and/or strictures often 
undergo endoscopic and/or surgical treatment. However, a durable response even with 
invasive therapies is suboptimal. Although psychological comorbidities in patients with 
CP are recognized6, systematic evaluation and management of anxiety, depression and 
sleep disturbance as part of pain management has not been included in treatment 
guidelines for pain in CP22, 23. In other chronic pain populations, cognitive-behavioral 
treatments have been developed to address anxiety, depression, and sleep problems finding 
positive effects for reducing pain interference24. In particular, treatment of comorbid 
sleep disturbance has been identified as an important aspect of chronic pain management 
where cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia has produced positive effects on pain

reduction25, 26. Whether treatment of these comorbid factors leads to improved outcomes 
of pain management has not been systematically evaluated in CP. Our data show a high 
prevalence of psychological comorbidities and sleep problems, especially in patients with 
significant symptom burden, suggesting that a multidisciplinary approach to address these 
factors should be included in the treatment algorithm for management of pain in patients 
with CP.

In prior studies of QOL using SF12, demographics, risk factors, and disease-specific 
variables were incorporated in multivariable models; however, these variables explained only 
a small fraction of variance in QOL (19–38%)27, 28. In the current analyses, we expanded 
the covariates to include ethnicity, socioeconomic factors and Charlson comorbidity, which 
helped to explain greater variability in the QOL domains (up to ~50%). We also used 
the PROMIS 29, which provided greater specificity in terms of decrements in specific 
symptom domains over and above more generalized measures of health-related QOL like 
physical and mental health component scores. Indeed, an important finding facilitated by 
discrete subdomain assessment from the PROMIS 29, is that CP leads to impairments in 
sleep, fatigue, and social role participation. This increased precision in symptom assessment, 
along with the broad validation and proliferation of PROMIS measures in studies of diverse 
medical conditions makes valid comparisons of symptom profiles within CP and between 
CP and other medical populations possible. Other strengths of our study include a large, 
multicenter, well-phenotyped cohort, inclusion of controls, and the use of robust statistical 
measures and methodology.

Our study also has limitations. Data presented are a cross-sectional assessment at the 
time of enrollment and not an assessment of changes in physical, mental, and social 
health over the disease course. Moreover, our measurement of pain is limited to severity 
and temporality; future studies may consider assessing perceptual qualities (e.g., sensory, 
neuropathic features), bodily locations and pain extent as well as assessing pain over longer 
measurement periods. We did not conduct diagnostic assessments of anxiety, depression or 
other psychologic diagnoses, and rather relied on symptom measures from the PROMIS 
29. However, prior studies have demonstrated criterion validity for PROMIS anxiety and 
depression symptom scores with clinical diagnoses of anxiety and depression.29 Our use 
of well accepted clinical thresholds for these symptom scores likely minimizes the risk of 
misclassifying participants with these comorbidities. Finally, our study participants may not 
represent all CP patients and controls due to voluntary and non-population-based sampling 
used in the study.

Although causality cannot be inferred by our study, given the high rate of psychological 
comorbidities observed and their relationship to chronic disabling pain, it is evident 
that psychosocial screening and treatment are needed in the clinical management of CP. 
In particular, identification of anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and the presence 
of severe and constant pain may be key factors to address to improve patients’ QOL. 
Validated screening tools, e.g. PHQ-9 can help identify clinically meaningful anxiety and 
depressive symptoms that warrant referral for further evaluation and treatment. Currently, 
there are available psychosocial interventions for management of pain and treatment of 
poor psychosocial functioning used in other chronic health conditions that may adapted

other conditions has produced positive benefits in reducing pain and disability24. There is 
recent preliminary evidence that internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy is feasible, 
acceptable, and reduces pain and disability in patients with definite and suspected CP30. 
Future research in larger-scale definitive trials is needed to evaluate whether these treatments 
can be applied effectively in CP to improve pain and QOL. Finally, longitudinal data are 
needed to understand the trajectories of pain, physical, mental, and social health over time 
and effects of pancreatic endotherapy and surgery.

In conclusion, this large multicenter study found a substantial impact of CP on physical, 
mental and social health. Among patients with CP, severe or constant pain are the major 
drivers for the decrements in health status. CP patients, especially those with severe or 
constant pain, had a high burden of clinically significant psychological and behavioral 
comorbidities including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and low physical function. 
These findings highlight the need for systematic evaluation and management of psychologic 
comorbidities and sleep disturbance in addition to disease-specific treatments in patients 
with CP.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW.

BACKGROUND.

•

Abdominal pain is a major driver for poor quality of life in chronic 
pancreatitis. Outcomes for treatments for abdominal pain in patients with 
chronic pancreatitis are suboptimal.

FINDINGS.

•

Chronic pancreatitis participants with severe or constant pain (vs. no pain) 
had significant decrements in physical, mental, and social health; and had 
greater prevalence of moderate-severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, sleep 
disturbance and low physical function.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE.

•

The evaluation and treatment of psychological and behavioral comorbidities 
may improve outcomes for pain management of patients with chronic 
pancreatitis.

Figure 1. 
Radar chart showing PROMIS 29 symptom profile* for comparisons between participants 
with CP and controls (panel A), CP categorized by pain severity (panel B), and CP 
categorized by pain temporality (panel C)*
The center of the radar plot represents a score of 30 on all seven domains of the 
PROMIS-29, and the outer edges of the plot represent a score of 70. Separate lines represent 
distinct subgroups. The further a line is from the center, the higher the mean score is on 
that domain. *Comparisons for each PROMIS domain (chronic pancreatitis vs. controls; 
pain categories in chronic pancreatitis [severe vs. no pain, and constant vs. no pain]) were 
significant (p<0.001)
