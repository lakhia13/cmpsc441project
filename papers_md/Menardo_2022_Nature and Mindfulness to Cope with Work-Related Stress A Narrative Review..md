Abstract: In recent years, work-related stress has grown exponentially and the negative impact
that this condition has on people’s health is considerable. The effects of work-related stress can be
distinguished in those that affect workers (e.g., depression and anxiety) and those that affect the
company (e.g., absenteeism and productivity). It is possible to distinguish two types of prevention
interventions. Individual interventions aim at promoting coping and individual resilience strategies
with the aim of modifying cognitive assessments of the potential stressor, thus reducing its negative
impact on health. Mindfulness techniques have been found to be effective stress management tools
that are also useful in dealing with stressful events in the workplace. Organizational interventions
modify the risk factors connected to the context and content of the work. It was found that a restorative
workplace (i.e., with natural elements) reduces stress and fatigue, improving work performance.
Furthermore, practicing mindfulness in nature helps to improve the feeling of wellbeing and to relieve
stress. In this paper, we review the role of mindfulness-based practices and of contact with nature in
coping with stressful situations at work, and we propose a model of coping with work-related stress
by using mindfulness in nature-based practices.

1. Introduction

Several institutions and researchers have highlighted global stress prevalence and
costs [1–4]. Hassard [5] presented a systematic review of the available evidence examining
the cost of work-related stress (WRS) in Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and EU-15. The ﬁndings reveal that the total estimated
cost of WRS was considerable and ranged substantially from USD 221.13 million to USD
187 billion. The cost of work-related stress within the EU-15 for 2014 was estimated to
be EUR 26.47 billion [3]. In Australia, the WRS’s costed USD 14.81 billion yearly [6]. The
American Institute of Stress estimated that US businesses lose up to USD 300 billion yearly
due to WRS [7]. The economic costs of WRS in Chinese or Asian contexts remain unclear.
The only available study reported data from Hong Kong and estimates the cost of WRS
range from USD 614 million to USD 900 million [8]. Moreover, productivity-related losses
contribute to the majority of the total cost of WRS (between 70 to 90%), with healthcare
and medical costs constituting the remaining 10 to 30% [5]. Improved productivity and a
healthy workforce are good for the companies’ economy and society. Additionally, it has
been also emphasized that stress prevention represents several beneﬁts for companies [2,4].

Different stress management interventions are offered to help keep individuals living
under heavy stress to avoid developing more severe stress-related disorders [9]. Stress man-
agement programs at workplaces typically focus on psychosocial environments and do not
address the growing body of research on workspace’s environmental psychology [10,11].
However, studies show that ofﬁce designs inﬂuence employees’ stress-level, productivity,
and wellbeing [12–16]. One aspect of the physical environment that is often overlooked in
a traditional ofﬁce design is the presence of nature or biophilic designs—such as indoor
plants, views to outdoor nature, easy access to outdoor nature, or visual representations
of nature [17]. Biophilic designs have received increased attention in recent years and are
being hailed as a workplace strategy for reducing stress while at the same time enhancing
performance and overall wellbeing [18–20]. Existing theories, such as the biophilia hypoth-
esis [21], the attention restoration theory [22,23], and the stress restoration theory [24,25],
suggest that contact with nature can inﬂuence both productivity and wellbeing.

Another kind of stress management intervention acts at the individual level by improv-
ing the individual’s capacity to deal with stressors (e.g., physical exercise, counseling, and
biofeedback). In this paper, we will focus on the practice of mindfulness for two reasons.
First, mindfulness training is a multimodal intervention informed by the principles of
positive psychology, with a central focus on skills that enable more effective coping and
stress reduction. Second, this paper aims to build a solid framework based on theoretical
and empirical evidence to plan an innovative solution for the issue of WRS, proposing
Mindfulness-in-Nature-based Intervention (MiNBI) that join together the healing effect of
nature and the distressful effect of Mindfulness.

The current narrative review synthesizes mechanisms underlying these two strategies
(nature and mindfulness) and explores how researchers have applied these methods to
enhance employees’ health and to manage (prevent and reduce) work-related stress. In the
discussion, we propose a hypothetical model for coping with WRS by applying MiNBI.

2. Deﬁnition of Stress and Work-Related Stress

Stress started to be deﬁned from a biological perspective and is focused on the phys-
iological reaction to stressful factors. In the base of this approach, we can ﬁnd Selye’s
deﬁnition of stress [26] as a response to aggression due to an internal or external stressor
factor in order to resist, adapt, and restore the individual’s internal equilibrium. Cur-
rently, it is accepted that stress indicates a state of elevated activation of the autonomic
nervous system with affective, cognitive, and behavioral manifestations [27] and that an
individual can feel this activation when he perceives their resources and capabilities as
inadequate to handle the hassles and difﬁculties in an environment [28], shining a light on
coping mechanisms.

Over the years, the focus shifted from cause–effect linearity to the interactions between
the individual and the context (physical and social) [29–31]. Seyle’s theory was criticized
since it devalues the role of the cognitive dimension involved in the answer [32]. Indeed,
individuals can interpret certain events or stimulus as stressful based on their evaluation
of the situations, on their past experiences, and on their emotions. The appraisal process
involves a continual monitoring of the person’s transactions with their environment in
terms of demands, abilities, competence, constraints, and support [33]. In this perspective,
stress is a dynamic process in which both individual and environment act one over the
other based on a sequential evaluation of the situation. The individuals ﬁrst evaluate the
situation, distinguish what is positive or pleasant from what is aggressive, and interpret
this aggression as a challenge, a threat, or a loss. After this, individuals evaluate their
own resources to deal with a singular situation. These sequential steps are inﬂuenced by
emotions, which make the process even more complex and dynamic across time [33].

Stress, as a research topic, arrives at the ﬁeld of psychology by Murrel [34] who deﬁned
occupational stress as a pression or external charge that causes tension (or strain). Currently,
in the literature, WRS is also termed in the literature as ‘job stress’ or ‘occupational stress’,
and generally refers to situations faced in the workplace context that are related to overload,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5948

high demands, or expectations [35]. As it happens for stress in general, several deﬁnitions
of work stress can be found, and most of them retain the main deﬁnition of stress as
an individual reaction while placing it in the dynamics of work contexts. A consensual
deﬁnition of work stress is presented in an ofﬁcial report from the European Commission,
stating that it refers to the emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological reaction to
aversive and noxious aspects of work, work environments, and work organizations. It is a
state characterized by high levels of arousal and distress and often by feelings of not being
able to cope [32].

Stress has been largely studied in the work psychology domain, exploring the main
causes or stress factors that can be present in the working contexts and also emphasizing
the consequences for individuals and organizations [36].

Regarding stressors, the UK government’s health and safety division proposed a
model, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), that covers six main areas of work design
that could be causes of stress: (1) Demands (includes workload, work patterns, and work
environment); (2) Control (relates to the degree of decision that people have over the way
they work); (3) Support (includes encouragement, sponsorship, and resources provided by
the organization, line management, and colleagues); (4) Relationships (includes promoting
positive working to avoid conﬂict and dealing with unacceptable behavior); (5) Role
(workers’ understanding their role within the organization and having clear and non-
conﬂicting roles); (6) Change (relates to the way changes are managed and communicated
within the organization) [37].

Additionally, we should not forget the stressors that can emerge from the content of
work and from the ergonomic design of the workplace, such as the distribution of work,
task changes, changes of machines or other devices, noise, dust, temperature, intensity and
fatigue, or the use of uncomfortable personal protective equipment [38,39].

Considering the main reported consequences, a systematic review of WRS conducted
by Burman and Goswami [35] highlights the following: cognitive consequences (mental
illness, lack of concentration and judgment capacity), behavioral consequences (sleeping
disorders, poor eating habits, addictive consumption of drugs or alcohol, and neglecting
responsibilities), emotional consequences (restless, irritation, impatience, anxiety, isolation,
and depression), and physical consequences (high blood pressure, nausea, cardiovascular
problems, back, and neck pain). In addition to individual consequences, there are also
negative consequences for the organizational side: weak commitment, low engagement,
unsafe behaviors, low performance, absenteeism, and turnover [36].

3. Nature and Work-Related Stress

Physical settings can play a role in coping with stress. A rapidly growing amount of re-
search from many different areas (e.g., environmental/consumer/health/sport/organizati-
onal/occupational psychology, environmental epidemiology, and public health) indicates
that nature has a multiplicity of beneﬁcial qualities for mental health [40,41], including
stress reduction [42–45]. With the term “Nature”, we refer to spaces (outdoor and indoor)
and views that incorporate natural elements (e.g., trees, rivers, and beaches), material
(e.g., wooden and water), sound (e.g., birds and water), or odors (e.g., essential oils).

To recover from stress, individuals need to replenish their lost resources by engaging
in activities that either restore old resources or generate new resources [46]. This process can
be described as passive recovery, which follows from the relief from work demands [47].
As claimed by the Attention Restoration Theory [23] and Stress-Recovery Theory [25],
exposure to nature restores emotional and cognitive resources, permitting stress reduction.
Thanks to the natural elements that capture the workers’ involuntary attention and make
feel him/her “being-away”, the workers can receive relief from work demands and restore
their resources.

Based on the homogeneous, substantial, and statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings, there is
strong evidence concerning emotional and cognitive changes [48–50]. Exposure to natural
scenes moderates the negative effects of stress, reducing the negative mood state, and simul-

taneously enhances positive emotions [48] and the recovery of cognitive performance [49]
more than urban environments do. Indeed, the evidence concerning perceived stress level
measures is weaker, although they are mainly positive [50].

The most common research design has investigated the presence of indoor plants.
Two reviews concluded that, in general, the presence of indoor plants appears to reduce
stress [51,52]. Studies have been conducted by focusing on speciﬁc independent variables.
For example, researchers examined the size and volume of greenery [53]; the number of
plants installed [54,55]; the shape, size, type, and distance of the plants from the partici-
pant [56,57]; and the index of the greenness of interior space [58]. Bakker and Voordt [51]
further noted that little attention had been paid to the type of plant or its state of health. The
majority of the studies have been conducted in laboratory or quasi-ofﬁce design [59–63].
A more limited number of studies targeting ofﬁce workers in real ofﬁce settings have
also been conducted [53,64–70]. In these studies, indoor plants were placed on the ﬂoor,
windowsills, shelves, desks, or all of these ofﬁce options to provide visual access to plants.
Most previously mentioned studies focused on the psychological and physiological effects
of passive interaction with plants. Nishina [53], however, studied the effects of active
involvement with plants. He reported that allowing participants to choose and care for
the plants in the study enhanced their satisfaction and contributed to the mitigation of
stress in the workplace. Considering physiological effects, green plants in an internal
space induced parasympathetic activity, the greater stabilization of the autonomic nervous
system, and increased electroencephalographic (EEG) activity [71]. However, due to a low
number of studies, the evidence of the physiological effects related to stress recovery is
more equivocal [50,72].

Moreover, the view (of real nature or aesthetical images) and natural materials
(e.g., wood) reduce stress and anger in a working environment and help workers feel
happier and healthier [10,62,73,74]. Moreover, individual preferences for a material can
lead to stress reduction [75,76]. Participants preferring wood panels to white steel panels
showed greater stress reduction when exposed to their preferred material: wood [75].

Finally, it has recently been discovered that the reduction in stress and improvements
to the immune system produced by forest visits can be replicated when evergreen oils are
removed from trees, aerosolized, and infused in interior spaces [77]. The essential oils
emitted by evergreen trees are associated with improvements to the immune system and
the production of natural killer cells [78,79]. These effects could be long-term but vary
based on gender, with immune functions increased for up to 30 days in men and only
seven in women [80]. Women also report higher stress levels than men, and they are less
likely to use outdoor natural environments during the work day [20]. Thus, including
access to indoor natural environments as become an even a greater priority for female
knowledge workers.

In summary, the literature has shown that, independently from the type of exposure
(plants, poster, slides, video, virtual reality (VR) settings, or views of natural environ-
ments/stimuli), people experience a general reduction in symptoms related to psycho-
physiological stress [42,81]. However, for the emotional aspect, the results are less clear.
Indeed, a meta-analysis showed a larger effect for exposure to real nature vs. laboratory
simulations [48].

Despite many existing studies and reviews, no existing systematic reviews investigate
experimental studies on the effect of contact with nature on healthy adults’ workplace-
related outcomes. Moreover, earlier research on workplace design primarily focused on the
physical arrangement of employees’ immediate work area and the environmental qualities
of the work area. Less attention has been given to building organization, exterior amenities,
and site-planning [82].

Greater consideration has been directed toward the multifactorial nature of sound per-
ception and the restorative impact of positively evaluated soundscapes on stress recovery
and physio-psychological wellbeing—e.g., the sound of trickling water or birds chirping.

Finally, some questions have not been sufﬁciently answered with respect to the

ofﬁce setting:
•
•
• How much “nature” is enough or recommended to achieve potential effects?

Does biophilic design actually lead to these outcomes?
Do all nature contact types lead to equal outcomes?

Designing healthy workplaces, for example, by increasing the possibility of being
in contact with natural elements, is only one of the strategies for coping with stress that
companies and workers could follow. Another form of coping strategy acts at the individ-
ual level by training individuals that are more exposed to stressors and developing and
improving their capacity to deal with them in order to be protected from their effects. In the
following sections, we review mindfulness techniques that have been found to be effective
in modifying the cognitive assessment of the potential stressor, thus reducing its negative
impact on health.

4. Mindfulness and Work-Related Stress

Mindfulness is deﬁned as “a process of openly attending, with awareness, to one’s
present moment experience” [83]. Several deﬁnitions have been given of mindfulness,
but all of them share two characteristics: Firstly, mindfulness focuses on the awareness in
individual’s present experience in terms of external and internal present-moment states
(e.g., sounds, body sensations, thoughts, and emotional reactions), which is also called
“watchfulness” [84]. Secondly, mindfulness involves adopting an open attitude toward
one’s experience [83,85].

Mindfulness refers to both the state of mind, which can be considered as a dispositional
trait according to the frequency people experienced it at [86], and the practices (included
into intervention programs) to foster it [87]. Studies on mindfulness at work can be
distinguished in two broad groups: those that focus on state or trait mindfulness, according
to the frequency in which workers experience mindfulness, and those which focus on
mindfulness-based interventions and its effects at individual and organizational levels.
The following paragraphs will present the main ﬁndings on mindfulness and wellbeing
at work.

Research on trait mindfulness has shown its beneﬁts in terms of greater workers’
wellbeing [88–91] and as protective factor [87]. For instance, Roche and colleagues [90]
found that leaders’ mindfulness is negatively related to their levels of anxiety, depres-
sion, negative affect, emotional exhaustion, and cynicism. In another study, Schultz and
colleagues [91] showed the direct negative relationship between mindfulness and “work
ill-being” is measured in terms of burnout, turnover intentions, and absenteeism. Diary
studies demonstrated its positive effects on reducing emotional exhaustion and improving
sleep quality [89,92]. A recent meta-analysis [88] showed a signiﬁcant and positive relation-
ship between trait mindfulness and physical, mental health, and emotion regulation and a
negative relationship with anxiety, depression, negative emotions, or burnout.

Mindfulness-based interventions also play a beneﬁcial role in reducing work-related
stress and enhancing wellbeing [89,93,94]. The high quantity of studies about mindfulness
at work led to a greater production of systematic review and meta-analyses [95]. For
example, Lomas and colleagues’ meta-analysis [87] showed a strong negative effect size for
health, stress, anxiety, and distress; small to medium positive effect sizes were observed for
compassion, empathy, mindfulness (state), and positive wellbeing (life satisfaction, positive
affect, and resilience). A non-signiﬁcant effect size was shown for emotional regulation and
depression. Virgili [96] found similar results across intervention types, program durations,
and occupations, and the effects were maintained ﬁve weeks after the intervention.

Finally, even if the researchers focused on positive outcomes, mindfulness in the
workplace could also have some negative consequences for workers, which must be con-
sidered [97]. For example, mindfulness increases creativity, which is helpful in some tasks,
but, at the same time, it could increase the duration of most repetitive and mundane
tasks [86]. Moreover, in ﬁve experiments conducted by Hafenbrack and Vohs [98], a single

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5948

6 of 16

mindfulness practice weakened energy (arousal) and task motivation. The induction of
a mindfulness state reduces energy directed toward accomplishing upcoming tasks [85]
and, consequently, task motivation [99,100]. Furthermore, in a recent review Bartlett and
colleagues [101] found that highly committed mindfulness training (e.g., 10 h training
plus 30 minutes’ daily homework) could increase, rather than decrease, employees’ stress,
especially if the training was expressly built for “at risk” employees [102,103].

Research has tried to explain the mechanisms that lead mindfulness to the positive
outcomes described above. Literature suggests that in the relationship between mind-
fulness and WRS, one of the key processes of mindfulness is “decoupling the self from
experiences, events, and mental processes” [86,104]. When the self (i.e., ego, self-esteem,
and self-concept) is deeply rooted in negative thoughts, emotions, and experiences, people
perceive adverse events as more threatening and could feel that their values are under
attack [104,105]. On the contrary, mindfulness allows people to select and observe those
stimuli that trigger emotions, affecting how they appraise and react. By utilizing mindful-
ness, people learn to notice and observe stimuli (internal and external) without judging
them. This mindfulness approach, in turn, allows people to create a distance between the
self and the situation that leads them to have negative thoughts, emotions, and experiences
as transient [86,106] and, consequently, to perceive the negative situation as less threaten-
ing [103]. Indeed, mindful people show less negative effects after a stressful event [107].
This present-moment nonjudgmental awareness inﬂuences, on one side, automatic mental
processes by reducing automatic responses and rumination [86,106] that, in turn, lead to
better cope with stressful events. On the other side, it also promotes an awareness of one’s
physiological state [106] that, in turn, can help individuals better interpret and respond to
messages from the body [86]. This leads to a more effective coping mechanisms with stress
by reducing reactivity to unpleasant states (lower cortisol levels) [106,108] and allows faster
recovery toward baseline levels [108].

Research on mindfulness in the workplace has also received criticism due to the lack
of deﬁnition consistencies and, in some cases, the lack of rigor in the adaptation of standard
intervention programs (e.g., MBSR) to the work environment without guaranteeing the
respect of the basic standards of such programs [109]. Another criticism is related to the
quality of research designs. For instance, Jamieson and Tuckey’s systematic review [109]
showed that 22.5% of the intervention studies revised (9 studies) did not employ a control
group; moreover, almost half of the studies (18 studies) failed in the manipulation check.
Hence, they did not measure trait and state mindfulness before and after the intervention
for each condition/group. The dropout rates of mindfulness interventions and participants’
level of satisfaction with them are lacking in many studies, preventing from identifying
the reason why participants do not stay in intervention programs and possible areas of
improvements [109]. As other areas of research, another criticism is related with the bias
entailed by the self-assessment of state and trait mindfulness, which might be overcome
by using triangulation and the use of objective measures according to the mindfulness
deﬁnition considered. In addition, in most cases, participants were white-collar workforces
drawn from large organizations. Therefore, currently, it is not known whether the effective-
ness of training differs by setting (e.g., small, medium, and large organization) and role
type (e.g., blue collar, administrative, and professional) [101].

Finally, in the organizational context, mindfulness is often used as a “for-gain” ap-
proach [110] to gain a healthier and more productive “self”. For example, mindfulness
is used as a set of practices for achieving determinate outcomes (e.g., reducing stress or
enhancing productivity) [111]. This approach contrasts with the original Buddhist mind-
fulness approach [111], a “no-gain approach [110], to achieve a not self-centered state of
existence [112]. Researchers and those who design mindfulness programs for companies of-
ten do not know the theoretical roots of Buddhist mindfulness. Organizational mindfulness
programs must not be strictly adherent to Buddhist mindfulness. However, participants
could beneﬁt from being aware that mindfulness training should not be used as a single
and standalone exercise for reducing stress (or enhancing performance). Mindfulness

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5948

training should be seen as a gradual and personal process that involves many other factors
(e.g., physical, emotional, cognitive, spiritual, ethical, and social) and should lead to adopt-
ing a different lifestyle. The isolation of mindfulness practice from other factors may reduce
its effectiveness [111].

5. Mindfulness in Nature: How Nature Helps to Restore Resources in Order to Carry
out Mindful-Based Practices

Environmental psychology rarely pays enough attention to the potential beneﬁt that
nature could bring to mindfulness training [113] or considers meditation practices as a way
to facilitate and enhance restorative experiences [114]. Nevertheless, some authors, among
which include Kaplan, one of the pioneers of the concept of restorative experiences [22,23],
suggested some converging points between theory in the ﬁeld of mindfulness and theory in
restorative environments [115–117]. Both suggest disengaging from habitual and reactive
thoughts and emotion (calling this mechanism detachment and being away, respectively)
as a stress management strategy. Both suggest that attention underlies the positive effect of
experiences. In particular, both theorize that present experiences (meditation and nature
exposure) are characterized by a particular quality of attention (curiosity and soft fasci-
nation, respectively) [22,23,116,117]. Thus, experiences in nature can support meditative
states through soft fascination (attentional state that restores resources effortlessly) and
by being away. Meditation practices, in turn, can help people become positively engaged
and curious toward restorative environmental conditions [113,115]. People could reduce
stress through mindfulness meditation and exposure to nature by achieving psychological
distance from stressors and distraction rather than addressing and eliminating them [118].
In addition to similarities, there are also some differences between the two approaches.
One of the most evident is that mindfulness focuses on the voluntary practice (and effort)
of speciﬁc individual skills to achieve the target (i.e., stress reduction). On the other
hand, restorative theories claim that nature holds some characteristics that capture the
involuntary attention of people. In other words, for mindfulness theories, the connection
between present experience and stress management is a top-down attentional process
driven by internal factors, while for restorative theories, it is a bottom-up attentional
process driven by external factors. However, this difference is not a limitation for the
tentative of integration between the two approaches. Lymeus et al. [118] proposed that
these top-down and bottom-up processes can converge to enhance each other, supporting
the mindfulness state and restorative processes. The approach to mindfulness training
that draws on restorative qualities in natural environments could support beginners with
stress or concentration problems in effortless meditation. When mindfulness practice
requires attentional effort, for example, in beginner practitioners, exposure to natural
environments could support effortless mindfulness-like states. Then, directing the practice
toward nature scenes could offset that effort [118]. Reciprocally, practicing intentional
curiosity can enhance practitioners’ ability to connect with natural stimuli, making them
more fascinating (and, consequently, more restorative). Moreover, mindful detachment
could help alleviate stress and worries, allowing people to enjoy the restorative potential
of the natural environment more. In sum, meditation training and exposure to nature
could complement each other when combined and not be a mere addition of independent
effects [115].

Experimental Evidence

The ﬁeld of nature-based mindfulness is at its beginning and is not yet deﬁned.
However, research including both mindfulness and nature is a growing ﬁeld. Many
modern Buddhist meditation retreats and mindfulness retreats are held in natural envi-
ronments [119,120]. Forest bathing (complete immersion in a natural environment) and
mindfulness are often joined to maximize therapeutic effects [121–123]. Barriers, challenges,
and difﬁculties toward achieving a mindful state could be overcome thanks to nature’s
exposure [124].

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5948

A recent systematic review synthesizes results [125]. It includes only studies that
examined the effect of real outdoor nature (no virtual and indoor nature). Only seven
articles compared nature-based mindfulness with similar interventions but without contact
with nature [118,126–134]. In three articles, the authors ask participants to “pay attention
to purpose, in the present moment” (informal mindfulness) [126–128]. Two articles used
horticultural therapy [130,131]. Shi et al. [129] used a mindfulness technique in which the
subject focuses on his/her breathing and sensations while walking. Lymeus [118] used
restoration skills training (ReST): weekly classes in a garden environment, with exercise
instructions aimed to stimulate participants’ effortless, restorative transactions with the
environment through sensory exploration, and practice in curiosity and detachment. Al-
though the interventions’ characteristics varied widely concerning the type of mindfulness,
in all studies, with the exception of one [131], mindfulness in the natural environment
enhanced positive emotions or decreased negative ones. Its effect was superior to those of
the control groups.

In all studies included in the previously reported review, mindfulness sessions in na-
ture were only one element of the intervention (i.e., psychotherapy) to cope with stress [125].
However, studies considering only mindfulness intervention showed the same enhanced
effect [132–134]. Formal (e.g., MBSR) and informal (e.g., walking mindfulness meditation)
mindfulness training in the natural outdoor environment resulted in greater decreases in
stress than in the other environments [132,134].

With respect to the mechanism of mindfulness, the literature suggested that stress
is inﬂuenced primarily by mindful attention (actively sustaining attention to the present
moment) and mindful acceptance (an attitude of openness, nonjudgment, and curiosity
about the current moment) [133]. Moreover, people who receive a mindfulness intervention
in nature reported higher decoupling ability and less negative emotions than those who
walk indoors without mindfulness instruction. However, no difference was found from
those who walk in nature without mindfulness instruction. This means that exposure to
nature could also enhance the decoupling process typical of mindfulness practices [134].
Moreover, this result empirically supports the idea of a combined effect of mindfulness
and nature [118]. Indeed, it suggests that only exposure to nature could not be sufﬁcient
for reducing negative emotions. Instead, by adding mindfulness intervention, negative
emotions signiﬁcantly decrease [134]. On the contrary, even if participants who also
received mindfulness training reported greater awareness of their surroundings [134],
mindful awareness (monitoring of present experiences, external and internal, both pleasant
and unpleasant) did not directly inﬂuence perceived stress [133].

A largely separate line of research has recently provided indirect support for the
notion that mindfulness can enhance nature contact and vice versa, suggesting that a
mutually beneﬁcial relationship between humans and nature can be mediated, in part, by
mindfulness [135–137]. From one side, connection to nature can enhance mindfulness (in
particular attention and acceptance) that, in turn, reduces stress [133]. Indeed, connection
with nature increases only in mindfulness in the nature group and not in built mindfulness
or indoor groups [132]. In particular, it could be that the tendency to attend mindfully
to experiences in everyday life (i.e., with intentional curiosity) is related to a stronger
general sense of connectedness with nature, whereas aspects of mindfulness more related
to detachment may not be [138,139]. On the other side, using mindfulness to increase
the awareness of restorative qualities of nature can activate a supplementary pathway to
connectedness with nature [113] that, in turn, is positively associated with a better ability
to cope with stress [140]. A recent review highlighted that connection with nature increases
after exposure to nature (“forest bathing”), but it is signiﬁcantly higher if participants were
also engaged in mindfulness [122].

Considering WRS, no study has investigated the effect of mindfulness in nature
intervention. One study [141] compares the effect of two interventions, the mindful emotion
regulation (MER) and the savoring nature (SN) in strengthening the positive relationship
between work engagement and proactive behaviors. The moderating role of supervisor

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5948

justice was also considered. MER is the ability to remain aware despite the valence and
magnitude of the emotions experienced. MER works with emotional regulation, allowing
people to detach from their own emotions and observe them without judgmental attitudes.
SN involves attending to nature voluntarily and effortlessly, the action that might have a
restorative potential, according to the Attention Restoration Theory [23].

Molina and O’Shea’s SN intervention “involved reﬂecting on different natural im-
ages while listening to a piece of music” [141]. People in the MER intervention condition
“received the same images and background music while listening to audio reﬂection activi-
ties” [141]. Results showed that both interventions promote prosocial behaviors, but only
MER was effective when supervisor justice was low. The study highlights the important
role of resources (supervisor justice) in determining the effectiveness of interventions at the
organizational level.

In conclusion, research on mindfulness has grown rapidly in the organizational con-
text in recent years [85,111,142,143], as well as organizational attention to design healthy
environment for workers [144–147]. However, further studies are needed to understand
how (behavioral, cognitive, and affective mechanisms) situational factors (e.g., physical
environment) may affect mindfulness practice and its beneﬁcial effects on workers.

6. Discussion

In the previous paragraphs, we described how Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) on
one side and nature on the other side could help with coping with stressful situations at work.
Moreover, we highlighted that nature-based mindfulness interventions are widespread but
not in the workplace. To help researchers develop effective stress management intervention
using mindfulness and nature, we propose a hypothetical model for coping with work-related
stress by using Mindfulness in Nature-Based Intervention (MiNBI).

MBIs are designed to train individuals to promote mindfulness and to integrate its
practice into daily life. Mindfulness, in turn, through the mechanisms that lie behind it
and enhancing the described secondary processes, can affect resources and demands at
work concerning the six main areas of work design: Demand, Control, Support, Relation-
ship, Role, and Change. Mindfulness disrupts automatic thought processes and increases
response ﬂexibility, allowing for better problem solving and decision making involved in
demanding and/or new situations. It promotes working memory, self-determination, and
persistence, which are relevant for dealing with diverse demands. When facing competing
demands, mindfulness promotes attentional control and efﬁciency. Enhancing cognitive
capacity is linked with higher creativity and better problem-solving skills, which are impor-
tant for crafting how individuals work effectively. Moreover, by fostering adaptive capacity
and the adoption of new perspectives, together with empathy, mindfulness can contribute
to healthier exchanges between individuals and increase backup behavior. Higher empathy,
awareness, and intent in information processing promote the recognition of needs in others.
Present moment awareness, attentional control, and better working memory contribute
to clear perceptions of one’s role. In addition, cognitive ﬂexibility can contribute to the
systemic perception of how one’s role impacts and is inﬂuenced by others. Furthermore, by
decreasing the use of automatic mental processes, mindfulness promotes the unbinding of
cognitive schemas and broader possibilities for thinking and acting without being lodged in
past schemas. Mindful people better adapt to new environments by ﬁnding new response
strategies more efﬁciently.

Nature acts in two different ways: On the one hand, nature directly affects stress and
mental fatigue, which have a role in coping with demands and in increasing resources
concerning the six areas of work design. Exposure to nature can reduce the negative mood
state and enhance positive emotions, which in turn help in coping with stressful situations
connected with high demands and increase social awareness so that individuals can relate
with others more assertively and positively solve conﬂicts. Moreover, it contributes to
mental fatigue restoration, with positive impacts on attention, increasing resources for
controlling the way they develop their work, and helping in coping with highly demanding

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5948

10 of 16

situations. Furthermore, exposure to nature has a calming effect, helping to reduce psycho-
physiological activation during stress responses and protecting individuals against the
impact of environmental stressors provoked by changes. On the other hand, nature can
boost the effect of MBI in fostering mindfulness and, consequently, can improve all the
positive effects of mindfulness that are already described. For example, contact with nature
fosters cognitive performance, boosting the mindfulness’s effect on working memory,
self-determination, and persistence, which are relevant for dealing with diverse demands
and for the control of the way they develop their work. Moreover, contact with natural
environments or elements as a part of mindfulness practice could boost the mindfulness
effect on empathy, awareness, cognitive ﬂexibility, and self-management skills of workers.
The latter, in turn, contribute to developing positive interpersonal relationships, to the
perception of their role within the organization, and to adjust effectively to change, reducing
stress and promoting new response patterns. Figure 1 summarizes these mechanisms.

Figure 1. How does Mindfulness in Nature-Based Intervention works to mitigate work-related stress.

To develop these practices (MiNBI), workers could, for example, personalize personal
workplace with nature elements and takes little breaks (e.g., 5 min every hour) to look at
them (e.g., indoor plants, outdoor nature, or visual representations of nature). Alternatively,
they can use break-time to have a short walk in a natural environment (e.g., outdoor nature,
if available, or a terrace with plants, or towards a window with natural landscape). These
actions could be occasions to use nature to restore their mental resources and also to practice
mindfulness in natural exercises (e.g., pause for presence in nature, consciously relaxing in
nature, focusing on nature, and open awareness in nature).

MINDLIVEN (Mindfulness-in-Nature Based Training through Virtual Environments

project) aims to develop a MiNBI that will include “formal” training with the following:
•
•

Exercise: A dedicated time to practice a skill that takes about 10 min.
Small exercise: A short exercise to practice a skill so it can be more easily ﬁtted in the
day, with a length of 2 or 3 min.

• Micro-practice: A very short exercise that lasts only about 15 s that can be very easily
included in our day-to-day habits (e.g., before a challenging task as send an important
e-mail or do a presentation).

Finally, management actions are critical for developing a healthy workplace and
contributing to a context that facilitates individual actions to practice mindfulness and
the use of nature. For this reason, we want to suggest some actions that managers should
develop to deal with the demands and work characteristics that contribute to stress and,
if not managed, will contribute to a decrease in performance and health problems. For
example, we list the following:

1.

Facilitate mindfulness practices in a speciﬁc place. Create a room for people to practice
mindfulness with natural elements to recreate conditions that occur in nature, e.g.,
with an open view of natural landscape, water, natural sounds, essential oils, natural
materials, and light that changes over time.

3.

Facilitate mindfulness practices outdoors. Organize outdoor natural workspaces
whenever possible.
Facilitate mindfulness practices without moving from the workstation. Place indoor
natural elements where employees can easily see them from their workstations.

7. Conclusions

The workplace is one of the environments where people spend most of their day.
Consequently, in addition to being a place of production, a workplace must also be a place
that can generate wellbeing. In this paper, we summarized the positive effect of mindfulness
and exposure to nature relative to workplace outcomes. Moreover, we highlighted the
therapeutic potential of mindfulness in nature interventions also in the workplace. The
proposed model will be used in future research studies as a theoretical framework to
develop efﬁcient interventions to cope with WRS. MiNBI could be a useful tool to enhance
both production and wellbeing. However, it is important to underline that MiNBI should
be part of a more comprehensive process for managing the risks of WRS that include also
identifying work-related stress causes (i.e., risk evaluation).
