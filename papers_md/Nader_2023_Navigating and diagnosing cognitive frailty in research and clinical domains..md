Abstract

While physical frailty has been recognized as a clinical entity for some time, the concept of 
cognitive frailty (CF) is now gaining increasing attention in the geriatrics research community. CF 
refers to the co-occurrence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment in older adults, which has 
been suggested as a potential precursor to both dementia and adverse physical outcomes. However, 
this condition represents a challenge for researchers and clinicians, as there remains a lack of 
consensus regarding the definition and diagnostic criteria for CF, which has limited its utility. 
Here, using insights from both the physical frailty literature and cognitive science research, we 
describe emerging research on CF. We highlight areas of agreement as well as areas of confusion 
and remaining knowledge gaps, and provide our perspective on fine-tuning the current construct, 
aiming to stimulate further discussion in this developing field.

The relationship between physical frailty and cognitive status in older adults has received 
increasing attention over the past decade1-4. Physical frailty is a clinical syndrome defined 
by the presence of three or more of the following criteria: unintentional weight loss, 
self-reported exhaustion, muscle weakness, slow walking pace and low physical activity5. 
It is independently associated with cognitive impairment, dementia, loss of function, 
hospitalization and mortality5-8. While there is no consensus on the definition of CF, it 
generally refers to a complex construct that involves both physical frailty and cognitive 
impairment. The cognitive component is defined as a decline in cognitive function that does 
not meet the criteria for dementia, while the physical component includes factors such as 
weakness and fatigue. The term CF has been used in over 295 articles on PubMed since 
2013, mostly in review and meta-analysis papers. However, there is still a disagreement 
regarding the exact nature of this phenomenon, and further exploration is needed. The 
co-occurrence of the two conditions gives rise to the dilemma of having to decide on 
which condition comes first, with the potential for cognitive-based definitions that rely 
on cognitive impairment as the primary component of CF, with physical frailty being 
considered a secondary factor. However, this approach can be criticized for ignoring the 
potential impact of physical frailty on cognitive functioning. Physical-based definitions, 
on the other hand, could consider physical frailty as the primary component of CF, with 
cognitive impairment being considered a secondary factor. However, this approach also 
ignores the potential impact of cognitive impairment on physical functioning. Research 
has demonstrated that individuals with CF notably differ from those who have cognitive 
impairment but not physical frailty. The former group performed more poorly on tests of 
executive function and attention and exhibited a subcortical–frontal cognitive pattern that 
differs from that of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)9. In addition, regarding the risk of incident 
dementia, it has been found that co-occurrence of cognitive impairment and physical frailty 
carries a higher risk compared to either cognitive impairment or physical frailty alone10. It is 
quite likely that patients with CF who have AD biomarkers would present different cognitive 
characteristics compared to patients with CF who have predominantly vascular damages, 
which necessitates a nuanced and tailored approach to cognitive assessment.

Navigating the intersection of physical and cognitive decline

Several studies11-17 have demonstrated a link between physical frailty and various cognitive 
traits, including memory, verbal abilities, spatial abilities and processing speed18,19. 
Individuals with pre-frailty had poorer cognitive performance in both memory and non-
memory domains than non-frail individuals20. Similarly, individuals with frailty performed 
poorly on tests measuring processing speed, verbal fluency and simple reaction time21. As 
a result, an international consensus group from the International Academy of Nutrition and 
Aging (IANA) and the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics (IAGG) 
proposed the term CF to describe the simultaneous presence of physical frailty and cognitive 
impairment without dementia22.

While the original IANA/IAGG definition of CF only included those with a clinical 
dementia rating (CDR) of 0.5, an extended definition23 has since been proposed, including 
those with subjective cognitive decline (SCD; CDR < 0.5) and/or positive serum and 
imaging biomarkers of abnormal amyloid accumulation and neurodegeneration in the

presence of pre-frailty or frailty. This updated definition creates a spectrum of CF ranging 
from SCD + pre-frailty to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) + frailty. SCD is defined as 
a self-experienced persistent decline in cognitive capacity in comparison to a previously 
normal status, despite normal performance on standardized cognitive tests (CDR < 0.5). This 
SCD, considered as pre-MCI, is a critical component of the CF spectrum because it may 
represent one of the earliest symptomatic manifestations of neurodegenerative disease and 
may place individuals in the category of being at a greater risk of progressing to MCI and 
subsequently dementia24. It is, therefore, a key factor in the early identification and reversal 
of CF.

Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome represents a pre-dementia syndrome characterized 
by subjective cognitive complaints and slow gait in older adults without dementia or 
mobility disability25. Hence, the simultaneous decline in both memory and gait speed 
was found to be associated with a heightened risk of developing dementia in older 
individuals26,27. MCR has been proposed as a useful construct to identify older adults 
at high risk of developing dementia and mobility declines. This syndrome is particularly 
relevant to the concept of CF, as it represents a state of vulnerability where physical 
and cognitive impairments intersect, much like CF. Notably, MCR also emphasizes the 
link between motoric impairment, especially slow gait, and risk of cognitive decline and 
dementia, and is associated with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease pathologies 
as we have shown28. Hence, it further underscores the intertwined nature of physical and 
cognitive declines. In the context of CF, MCR can be seen as a potential early sign or a 
sub-phenotype of the syndrome. The co-occurrence of subjective cognitive complaints and 
motoric dysfunction as observed in MCR may well correspond to the early stages of CF. 
Thus, a detailed examination of MCR and its relationship to CF could provide valuable 
insights into the identification and management of individuals who may be on the trajectory 
toward more pronounced cognitive impairment.

Additionally, physio-cognitive decline syndrome has been proposed as the simultaneous 
presence of cognitive impairment and physical decline and defined as cognitive performance 
in any domain that is at least 1.5 standard deviations below the mean for age-matched, 
sex-matched and education-matched norms and the presence of physical weakness and/or 
slowness29. The 2013 IANA/IAGG consensus report initially aimed to identify cognitive 
impairment caused by physical conditions using the term CF. However, the report also 
acknowledged that CF may be a precursor of neurodegenerative processes. This makes it 
challenging to differentiate between cognitive impairment caused by physical conditions 
and cognitive impairment resulting from comorbid physical frailty and early/prodromal AD. 
Cesari et al. recently highlighted the rationale behind this new construct as promoting a 
holistic approach to the assessment and management of cognitive impairment in older adults 
and recognizing frailty as a multidimensional phenomenon30.

Understanding the dynamics of CF: potentially reversible versus reversible

CF is often considered a prodromal stage to more serious cognitive impairments such 
as dementia, and its potential reversibility is a topic of notable interest and controversy. 
According to Ruan et al.23, CF may be classified into two types based on its course

and potential for reversal: ‘potentially reversible’ CF and ‘reversible’ CF. ‘Potentially 
reversible’ refers to early-stage cases wherein, with timely and effective interventions, 
further cognitive decline can be halted or slowed down. This type encompasses individuals 
exhibiting initial signs of cognitive decline that do not yet meet the criteria for dementia. 
‘Reversible’, on the other hand, includes cases where implemented interventions can reverse 
cognitive decline to a considerable extent and restore cognitive functioning. It is crucial to 
highlight that the ability to reverse CF depends on various factors, including the individual’s 
overall health status, the severity of cognitive decline and the underlying causes of CF. In 
addition, Mantovani et al. suggested to use the term ‘reversibility’ for MCI cases when 
there are identifiable modifiable factors such as polypharmacy, psychiatric conditions (for 
example, depression), metabolic deficiencies, sleep disturbances or sensory deficits. They 
cautioned that categorizing MCI as potentially reversible CF, as suggested by Ruan et 
al., might oversimplify the condition and overlook its multifaceted nature, particularly 
when the underlying neuropathology is not taken into account31. Furthermore, recent 
longitudinal studies32,33 have explored both concepts in predicting dementia, highlighting 
their importance in geriatric clinical care and research. One key point to consider is that, 
although CF can be a predictor of dementia, it is not invariably or inevitably a step toward 
dementia. Multiple research studies suggest that changes in an older adults’ overall health 
status are frequently linked to cognitive impairments. Improving their health could mitigate 
these cognitive changes, or even reverse them. This is a crucial clinical understanding; 
without it, any cognitive decline might be misinterpreted as part of a journey toward 
dementia. While it might not be straightforward to differentiate between reversible and 
irreversible states, it is critical to consider the possibility of both conditions.

Beyond chicken and egg: debating the directionality of physical frailty and 

cognitive decline

CF is associated with a higher risk of hospitalization, disability and death34,35. Moreover, 
CF has been shown to be a predictor of overall dementia, including vascular dementia32. 
While strong epidemiological evidence supports a relationship between physical frailty 
and cognitive decline11,36, data have not been consistent on the characterization of 
this relationship. Some studies suggest that physical frailty may increase the risk of 
cognitive impairment, MCI and a more rapid rate of cognitive decline12,37. Conversely, 
cognitive impairment can increase the risk of frailty and adverse health outcomes38. Recent 
longitudinal studies have shown that cognitive impairment can also be associated with 
a higher risk of developing frailty in later years among older adults with no frailty at 
baseline39. A recent study examined the hierarchical development of physical frailty and 
cognitive impairment, revealing that the occurrence of dementia anytime during the follow-
up period, was strongly associated with a high risk of developing cognitive impairment 
before frailty, and an even higher risk of cognitive impairment and frailty concurrently, as 
opposed to developing frailty first40.This finding highlights the importance of understanding 
the interplay between physical frailty and cognitive decline and its potential implications for 
early diagnosis and intervention.

In exploring the potential links between frailty and cognitive decline, it is crucial to consider 
the mechanisms underpinning this relationship. Recent evidence suggests a potential 
correlation between AD pathologies and physical frailty, which raises the possibility of a 
common underlying factor contributing to both conditions41. A valuable perspective comes 
from Wallace et al.42, who propose that the severity of frailty could modulate the expression 
of AD pathology in older adults, potentially influencing the manifestation and progression 
of cognitive impairments. One potential explanation is that as the damage accumulation 
underlying frailty occurs, compensatory mechanisms (such as photostatic mechanisms or 
DNA repair) tend to be hijacked by the frailty status and may allow the AD pathology 
to progress unchecked. This interaction suggests that addressing frailty in older adults 
might impact cognitive outcomes, potentially delaying or mitigating cognitive decline. 
Alternatively, early physical decline and pre-frailty may reflect an early undiagnosed brain 
pathology. Further longitudinal studies are required to enhance our understanding of the 
relationship between physical frailty and cognitive function.

Untamed territory: a diverse landscape of CF assessment tools

Estimating the prevalence of CF is challenging due to the ambiguity in its definition, the 
lack of standardized tools to assess and the limited number of prospective cohort studies 
available. It is also essential to approach the findings of these studies with caution, as they 
often differ in sample size and methodology. Research indicates that the identification and 
documentation of cognitive impairment in primary care is generally inadequate43,44, with 
less than 25% of patients with mild dementia having it noted in their records45.

In community settings, the prevalence of CF ranges from 1.0% to 4.4%, while clinical-
based studies report higher prevalence rates of 10.7% to 22.0%46,47. In Japan, a combined 
prevalence of frailty and MCI was found to be 2.7%, similar to other studies, with 
frailty alone at 11.3% and MCI alone at 18.8%48. Various factors, such as age and sex 
differences in samples, the use of differing CF models and the operationalization of CF’s 
two components (physical frailty and cognitive impairment), may contribute to varying 
prevalence estimates across studies47.

The inclusion of SCD, a self-perceived worsening of cognitive function, in CF models not 
only presents a challenge but also provides an opportunity to identify and possibly intervene 
with individuals who might be on a trajectory toward cognitive decline and dementia but 
have not yet reached the threshold of objective cognitive impairment.

Currently, the physical elements of CF are mostly screened using the Cardiovascular Health 
Study criteria, but there is a lack of consistency in the screening instruments for the 
cognitive component of this construct47.

The Fried frailty phenotype provides a concentrated and specific analysis of the physical 
aspect of CF because its assessment is based on an extensive set of physical criteria. 
As such, it is considered a suitable approach for examining physical frailty in relation 
to cognitive impairment. Beyond the Fried frailty phenotype, several other methods are 
available for evaluating frailty. One of these methods is the accumulation of deficits

approach, also known as the Frailty Index. This approach determines frailty by quantifying 
the proportion of potential health deficits that an individual exhibits, encompassing 
symptoms, signs, diseases, disabilities and laboratory abnormalities49. Another alternative 
is the Clinical Frailty Scale, which rates frailty into nine stages, from very fit to terminally 
ill, based on a clinician’s evaluation of a patient’s overall health status and degree of frailty. 
While these frailty tools are proficient at identifying vulnerable older adults, they classify 
individuals as frail based on a wide range of variables, complicating biological discovery 
and intervention development within these frameworks50,51.

To identify CF, individuals with frailty should undergo a comprehensive cognitive evaluation 
that examines their memory and other cognitive abilities, such as executive functions and 
processing speed. Several cognitive tests and instruments have been suggested, including 
the speed processing tests, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the mini–mental 
state examination, the AD assessment scale cognitive subscale and pre-MCI SCD research 
criteria22,23. When selecting the appropriate test, it is important to consider that the mini–
mental state examination is not sufficient for evaluating executive function and MCI. While 
the MoCA is an effective overall screening tool for cognitive impairment, the addition 
of more in-depth assessments that focus on executive function and processing speed can 
provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of an individual’s cognitive status31,52. 
Tools such as the Trail-Making Test, Stroop Test or Digit Symbol Substitution Test can be 
particularly useful in highlighting these specific cognitive domains.

Delrieu et al. proposed using the Frontal Assessment Battery and the Five-Word Test, as well 
as diagnostic tests such as the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, the Trail-Making 
Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised coding and verbal fluencies to assess 
cognitive impairment in individuals with frailty9. Won et al. proposed accepting cognitive 
impairment as 1.5 standard deviations below the mean for age-adjusted, gender-adjusted and 
education-adjusted norms on any cognitive functioning test to identify CF53.

Exploring the complex interplay between biological mechanisms and risk 

factors in CF: an unresolved debate

CF is influenced by various biological, environmental and psychosocial factors (Fig. 1). 
There is a general agreement among experts that the co-occurrence of cognitive decline 
and physical weakness in older adults is likely to be the result of a complex interplay of 
biological, environmental and psychosocial factors. However, evidence for direct causality 
remains lacking, despite the many causes that have been reported in the literature. Several 
biological mechanisms have been proposed to underlie CF, including chronic inflammation 
(CI), oxidative stress, neurodegeneration and vascular factors. Although the mechanisms 
linking frailty and cognitive impairment remain unclear, it is possible that abnormalities in 
biological processes related to accelerated aging, consistent with the geroscience hypothesis, 
may be involved54. Moreover, the high prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic risk 
factors in persons who develop dual cognitive and mobility impairments or decline may 
suggest an important role for these factors26. Furthermore, several factors have been linked 
to CF, including advanced age, lower niacin intake, lack of social support, depression and

reduced physical performance55. Cross-sectional studies also reveal associations with older 
age (over 70 years), lower educational attainment (primary school or lower), poor nutritional 
status, non-working status, poor self-perceived health and depression56-58.

CI has been linked to MCI, but there are few studies that have shown direct connections 
between CI and CF. One study found higher levels of some inflammatory markers 
in individuals with MCI compared to those with normal cognition59. Additionally, as 
individuals age, neuroinflammation mediators and pro-inflammatory cytokines are released 
by glial cells60,61. This buildup of CI in the brain has also been linked to changes at a 
neuronal level, resulting in neurobehavioral impairments such as reduced ability to learn, 
to remember and to adapt to changing conditions, as well as higher rates of delirium and 
depression60,62. Recently, a study found elevated levels of neuroinflammatory cytokines in 
association with CF63. However, a direct relationship between CI and CF has not been fully 
examined.

Oxidative stress is characterized by a disturbance in the body’s balance of reactive oxygen 
species and antioxidants64,65. Multiple studies have hypothesized that oxidative stress and 
free radicals contribute to the development of cognitive decline and physical frailty66. 
Participants with cognitive decline and physical frailty were found to have increased levels 
of reactive oxygen species derivatives and decreased levels of antioxidants67.

Impaired hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis function has also been associated with 
cognitive decline and physical frailty68. The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis plays an 
essential role in maintaining homeostasis in the presence of chronic stressors by producing 
cortisol69. Higher cortisol levels are associated with lower brain volume, impaired memory 
in middle-aged adults and a decline in cognitive performance in older adults. Cortisol has 
also been linked to the vulnerability of patients with frailty47,59,70,71.

Hormonal changes and dysregulation have shown to be indicators of cognitive decline in 
older adults. Dysregulation of thyroid, androgenic and growth hormones are associated 
with cognitive decline and physical frailty72. Insulin resistance as a part of endocrine 
dysregulation68,73-75 may also mediate cognitive decline and physical frailty.

The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) allele is well established as being associated with 
cognitive decline76. Evidence suggests that it may also be associated with physical 
frailty and motor decline in older adults, regardless of cognitive status77,78. Additionally, 
longitudinal studies have found that physical frailty is a major risk factor for incident 
vascular dementia in older adults.

Several studies on CF have reported varying patterns of cognitive impairment, with some 
emphasizing deficits in frontally mediated cognitive functions, such as executive functions, 
while others report more general cognitive changes, including memory impairment4,12. This 
variability may reflect differences in the specific cognitive domains assessed, the tools 
used for assessment and the characteristics of the study participants4. For example, studies 
focusing on global cognitive changes might have not looked at specific cognitive domains 
in detail or did not exclude individuals with dementia from their samples, potentially 
biasing results toward more general cognitive changes. Additionally, the specific etiology

of CF in different individuals, which can be influenced by a multitude of factors including 
vascular health, neurodegenerative processes and systemic health, may also contribute to 
these different patterns of cognitive impairment31. Given these considerations, it is important 
for future research in CF to apply comprehensive and standardized cognitive assessments 
that allow for detailed analysis of different cognitive domains. Furthermore, careful sample 
selection and characterization, including the exclusion of individuals with established 
dementia, are crucial for reducing bias and enhancing the validity of findings.

The road ahead: embracing the unknown in CF prevention and delaying 

progression

Over the years, an increasing number of studies have suggested that interventions focusing 
on improving physical activity can also benefit cognitive health by reducing cognitive 
decline. A 24-month structured, moderate-intensity physical activity program has been 
shown to decrease CF in sedentary older adults. The participants in the physical activity 
group demonstrated a 21% lower chance of worsening CF compared to those in a health 
education group79. Furthermore, incorporating a multicomponent exercise routine can 
enhance functional capacity and executive function, while moderate-intensity activities can 
reduce CF and promote healthy aging. These multidomain interventions often combine 
physical exercise prescription (resistance, aerobic, balance and flexibility training), cognitive 
training, dietary counseling and promotion of psychosocial support79,80.

There are additional factors that impact both the physical frailty and cognitive status of 
older adults, such as sleep quality and social isolation47,81,82. Recently, studies have found 
a correlation between poor sleep quality, including difficulty in falling asleep, and CF81. 
Frailty status has been found to improve more substantially in individuals participating 
in both a structured exercise program and bimonthly group reading activities compared 
to those who did not participate. Social activities that promote interactions have been 
linked to favorable outcomes in adults with frailty and with cognitive impairment83-85. In 
addition, while there is no specific food or supplement that has been conclusively shown 
to directly impact physical frailty and cognitive impairment, following a lifelong balanced 
diet, such as the Mediterranean diet, along with engaging in regular physical and mental 
exercise, is considered an effective preventive approach against cognitive decline in older 
age86. To mitigate the development of CF, it is imperative to prioritize the development of 
interventions that address these specific variables and aim to prevent their negative impact 
on cognitive health in older individuals.

Research has also investigated dual-task interventions, which involve performing two tasks 
(for example, walking and memory tests) simultaneously. Aging individuals, especially 
those with cognitive impairment, may experience a decline in their ability to perform 
dual tasks. These complex tasks demand more cognitive and motor resources and could 
potentially prevent or reverse frailty in older adults. However, there is currently no evidence 
to support additional benefits from simultaneous cognitive training87.

Evidence supports the notion that higher education enhances resilience against cognitive 
impairment. Indeed, research shows that, given equivalent degrees of brain pathology,

individuals with more education display fewer cognitive issues than expected88. Moreover, 
factors such as higher socioeconomic status, complex occupations, low stress levels and 
active participation in mental, physical and social activities probably bolster resilience and 
decelerate cognitive decline89.

However, despite the evidence, the mechanisms underlying these associations are still not 
well understood. Furthermore, the role of these elements in clinical evaluations of older 
individuals remains undefined. The exploration of these issues is of paramount importance 
and warrants additional research both for understanding the mechanisms and developing 
pharmacological interventions for CF prevention.

CF demystified: integrating concepts for clarity

CF represents the intersection between cognitive impairment and physical vulnerability, 
impacting an individual’s ability to perform activities of daily living and increasing their risk 
for adverse health outcomes, such as disability, falls, hospitalization and mortality.

CF can be defined as the co-occurrence of cognitive decline and physical frailty in older 
adults, resulting from a complex interplay of biological, environmental and psychosocial 
factors (Fig. 2). It is characterized by a cognitive impairment that does not meet the 
criteria for dementia, manifesting in difficulties with memory, attention, language and other 
cognitive abilities. The physical component encompasses a decline in physical function, 
including weakness, fatigue and decreased mobility, ultimately impairing activities of daily 
living. This condition is thought to originate from a combination of physical frailty and 
cognitive decline. However, determining whether cognitive decline is an inherent part 
of the CF syndrome or an early symptom of a concurrent neurodegenerative disease 
can be challenging. The relationship between physical and cognitive impairments is not 
hierarchical, and there is no consensus on whether physical or cognitive impairments should 
be considered primary or secondary components of CF. Additionally, in the realm of aging, 
there exists a spectrum of older adults with varying degrees of cognitive and physical 
conditions. Some may be physically frail but display no notable cognitive impairments, 
while others might exhibit cognitive deficits yet maintain physical robustness. This 
heterogeneity highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between cognitive 
and physical domains when evaluating and addressing CF in geriatric populations. We 
suggest categorizing CF (Fig. 3) based on varying levels of severity, rather than stages, 
with each level characterized by its unique combination of physical frailty and cognitive 
impairment. Given the distinct negative outcomes associated with each scenario90,91, we 
propose the following severity levels for CF: level 1, physical pre-frailty + SCD; level 2, 
physical frailty + SCD; level 3, physical pre-frailty + MCI; and level 4, physical frailty + 
MCI.

It is important to note that there is no implied expectation of progression between severity 
levels in a linear fashion. Instead, the categorization is intended to help to assess and address 
the varying levels of negative outcomes experienced by individuals with pre-frailty or frailty.

To accurately assess physical frailty and cognitive function in older adults, we recommend 
using the Fried frailty phenotype for physical frailty assessment, combined with a 
multistep approach for cognitive assessment to provide a consistent measurement approach. 
The concept of CF acknowledges that cognitive and physical vulnerabilities are not 
mutually exclusive, and that their combined presence can lead to unique challenges 
for affected individuals. This recognition underscores the necessity for comprehensive 
and multidisciplinary approaches in assessment, prevention and management strategies to 
promote overall well-being and quality of life for older adults experiencing CF.

For the initial screening of level 1 and level 2 (pre-MCI SCD), we propose a multistep 
process:

1.

2.

3.

First, general practitioners or other primary care professionals could administer 
the SCD questionnaire92, which is designed to detect individuals who experience 
subjective memory complaints. The SCD questionnaire is relatively easy to 
implement and has shown good reliability and validity in identifying individuals 
at risk for cognitive decline.

If the individual reports cognitive complaints, the addition of more specific 
assessments focusing on executive function and processing speed can provide 
a more comprehensive and accurate picture of an individual’s cognitive status. 
Tools such as the Trail-Making Test, Stroop Test or Digit Symbol Substitution 
Test can be particularly useful in highlighting these specific cognitive domains.

For cognitive impairment, the practitioner could then administer more detailed 
neuropsychological tests to evaluate cognitive performance in multiple domains. 
This could include tests such as the MoCA, which is more sensitive to early 
cognitive changes compared to the AD assessment scale cognitive subscale93.

Finally, SCD alone is not enough to establish a diagnosis of CF; its presence along with 
physical frailty could potentially signal CF. The introduction of select biomarkers could 
further bolster the accuracy and reliability of diagnosing and monitoring this condition. Such 
biomarkers, although still in the validation phase, may encompass inflammatory markers, 
neurodegenerative markers, indicators of oxidative stress, markers of metabolic conditions 
and cardiovascular biomarkers. Their inclusion in a comprehensive CF assessment could 
enhance the overall precision and robustness of the diagnosis. The concept of reversibility 
is another critical aspect of CF that warrants further investigation. Some studies suggest 
that CF could be potentially reversible, especially when interventions are implemented early. 
This highlights the importance of early detection and intervention strategies and underscores 
the urgency for more research in this area.

In conclusion, although there has been uncertainty primarily centered around the exact 
nature, definition and screening instruments of CF, our understanding of CF has improved 
over the past decade. CF describes the intersection of cognitive decline and physical frailty 
in older adults, characterized by a combination of cognitive impairment, physical weakness, 
and a reduced ability to perform daily activities. The co-occurrence of cognitive impairment 
and physical frailty carries a higher risk of developing dementia, as well as increased 
morbidity and mortality, when compared to either cognitive impairment or physical frailty

alone. Some reversibility has been observed, but the extent and sustainability of this reversal 
remain unknown. Future research may further elucidate the heterogeneity of physical frailty 
and use innovative tools, such as AI-enabled devices, to characterize physical, social and 
cognitive functions in older adults. This may help us to subclassify frailty based on specific 
physical, cognitive and social domains and identify novel biomarkers to understand the 
mechanisms and relationships between these domains that constitute CF.

Fig. 1 ∣. Schematic of the interplay of biological mechanisms, biomarkers and risk factors in CF.
The outer circle highlights that both physical frailty and cognitive decline possess common 
biological mechanisms, biomarkers and risk factors. These shared elements can interact with 
each other throughout all stages, forming the foundation of the concept of CF. The middle 
circle showcases the symptoms that emerge from these biological mechanisms. When there 
is a sufficient convergence of physical and cognitive symptoms, it leads to the manifestation 
of physical frailty and/or cognitive decline phenotypes. The presence of both signifies the 
onset of CF. HPA, hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal.

Fig. 2 ∣. Integrating CF concepts for clarity as a complex, multidimensional geriatric syndrome 
resulting from the complex interplay of biological, environmental, and psychosocial factors.
Psychosocial, environmental and age-related biological factors intertwine with observed 
declines in physical and cognitive abilities. Although these age-influenced biological 
changes may vary in their effect, they collectively play a part in the decline. The culmination 
of these factors leads to a condition known as CF, which underscores the interplay between 
cognitive and physical deterioration. Despite physical and cognitive decline potentially 
evolving separately, these shared influences can shape their progression concurrently.
