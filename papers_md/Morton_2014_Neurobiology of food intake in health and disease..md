Abstract

Under normal conditions, food intake and energy expenditure are balanced by a homeostatic 
system that maintains stability of body fat content over time. However, this homeostatic system 
can be overridden by the activation of ‘emergency response circuits’ that mediate feeding 
responses to emergent or stressful stimuli. Inhibition of these circuits is therefore permissive for 
normal energy homeostasis to occur, and their chronic activation can cause profound, even life-
threatening, changes in body fat mass. This Review highlights how the interplay between 
homeostatic and emergency feeding circuits influences the biologically defended level of body 
weight under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

Whether to eat, what to eat, when to eat and how much to eat in any one meal are decisions 
that each of us is intimately familiar with and that we are capable of making with little 
conscious effort. As these decisions can be influenced by a nearly limitless number of 
variables, day-to-day energy intake tends to vary both between and within individuals1. 
However, in normal individuals, body weight and body fat content are typically quite stable 
over time2,3 owing to a biological process termed ‘energy homeostasis’ that matches energy 
intake to expenditure over long periods of time. The energy homeostasis system comprises 
neurons in the mediobasal hypothalamus and other brain areas4 that are a part of a 
neurocircuit that regulates food intake in response to input from humoral signals that 
circulate at concentrations proportionate to body fat content4-6.

The robust efficiency with which the energy homeostasis system works in normal-weight 
humans and animal models seems to be at odds with the very high prevalence of overweight 
and obesity in Westernized societies7. Also common are disorders characterized by anorexia 
and progressive loss of body mass (‘wasting illness’) that importantly contribute to the 
mortality of cancer and other diseases8. Little is known regarding mechanisms underlying 
these disorders, but recently identified neurocircuits, which are referred to here as 
‘emergency feeding circuits’, may play a part. Some of these emergency circuits are 
designed to increase plasma glucose levels (partly by increased feeding) when they are 
activated9, whereas others prevent feeding when to do so is maladaptive (for example, under 
conditions of trauma, illness or threats from the environment)8. A key point is that activation

of these emergency circuits can potentially override normal control of energy homeostasis 
irrespective of whether these circuits function to increase or decrease food intake. The goals 
of this Review are to describe how food intake is governed by the energy homeostasis 
system and how it is altered in times of stress, and to consider how pathological activation of 
emergency response circuits can cause disorders of body weight.

The energy homeostasis system

First proposed by Kennedy10 some 60 years ago, energy homeostasis is achieved by a 
system whereby circulating signals inform the brain of available energy stores (a process 
referred to as ‘adiposity negative feedback’) and, in response, the brain makes corrective 
adjustments to food intake. (The energy homeostasis system also regulates energy 
expenditure, a topic that has recently been reviewed in REFS 11,12.) The best-studied 
humoral mediator of adiposity negative feedback is the adipocyte hormone leptin. Leptin is 
secreted from adipose tissue13, circulates in proportion to body fat stores14, enters the brain 
in proportion to its plasma level15 and acts on key neurons that regulate energy balance16,17. 
Moreover, leptin administration directly into the brain reduces food intake and body 
weight18,19, although conversely, reduced or impaired neuronal leptin signalling promotes 
hyperphagia and weight gain13,20.

The pancreatic hormone insulin is also implicated in energy homeostasis. Like leptin, insulin 
circulates in proportion to body fat21 and acts in the brain to reduce food intake22; 
conversely, reduced neuronal insulin signalling causes a mild expansion of body fat mass23. 
Although both hormones are implicated in this adiposity negative feedback control system, 
the feeding effect of leptin is quantitatively much greater than that of insulin.

Beyond adiposity negative feedback signals, numerous hormonal and nutrient-related 
signals can potently influence feeding. Among these are gut peptides that are involved in the 
perception of satiety and hence participate in the termination of individual meals. Putative 
satiety signals include peptide YY3-36 (PYY3-36)24, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1)25 and 
cholecystokinin (CCK)26. The gastric hormone ghrelin27, conversely, is secreted before 
meal onset and can stimulate feeding. Food intake can also be inhibited by other endogenous 
mediators, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis 
factor-α) and nutrients themselves (for example, glucose and free fatty acids28) (FIG. 1).

Satiety perception

Whereas the decision to eat (meal initiation) is influenced by many external factors, the 
amount eaten (meal size) is primarily determined by internal signals. Among the most 
important internal signals are peptides such as CCK and GLP1 that are secreted from the 
gastrointestinal tract in response to food ingestion26,29. Satiety information is conveyed by 
these peptides, as well as by neural signals generated by gastric distension, to the CNS 
through afferent fibres of the vagus nerve that project from the gut to the nucleus of the 
solitary tract (NTS) in the caudal hindbrain. Satiety peptides trigger food intake inhibition 
that is profound but short-lived, and they do not reliably cause sustained weight loss with 
repeated dosing. Illustrating this point is a study in rats in which serial injections of CCK 
were administered at the onset of each meal over a period of days30. Although CCK

consistently decreased meal size, its impact on body weight was minimal because of a 
compensatory increase in meal frequency, such that the total amount of calories consumed 
was not substantially affected30.

Buried within this observation is a fundamental axiom regarding how the energy 
homeostasis system works: adiposity negative feedback reduces food intake in part by 
increasing brain responsiveness to satiety signals31, an effect that is mediated by neuronal 
input from leptin and insulin32,33. Weight loss lowers the plasma levels of these hormones, 
which reduces the satiating effect of food (by reducing the response to satiety signals) and 
thereby increases meal size. Consistent with this concept is evidence that leptin reduces food 
intake by enhancing the response to satiety signals32,34,35 and thereby decreases meal 
size36,37, whereas deficient brain leptin signalling reduces the responsiveness to CCK, 
which leads to an increase in meal size31,38,39. This interaction between leptin and satiety 
signals seems to involve the activation of leptin receptors in both the hindbrain (on NTS 
neurons themselves40) and the forebrain (on neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus 
(ARC) that project directly or indirectly to the NTS41). The key point is that this interaction 
enables the amount of food consumed during individual meals to be adjusted to compensate 
for changes in body fat mass35,42 (FIG. 2).

Food reward

That palatability is a crucial determinant of the decision to eat, and that highly palatable 
foods can trigger eating at times when food would not otherwise be consumed, comes as no 
surprise. This type of feeding has been described as ‘non-homeostatic’ (REF. 43), because it 
can occur in the absence of the need to replenish depleted fuel stores. However, we disagree 
with this characterization because regulation of food reward is in fact integral to how energy 
homeostasis is achieved44. First, reduced perception of food reward seems to be an inherent 
aspect of satiety, a concept that has recently been developed based on findings from rodent 
studies45 and that is supported by brain imaging studies in humans46,47. Second, a fasting-
induced increase in food intake (‘re-feeding hyperphagia’) is associated with an increase in 
both the amount of work an animal will do to obtain food (a measure of the motivation to 
eat) and the ability of food to condition place preference (a measure of learning driven by 
food’s reinforcing properties), and both of these responses are blunted by 
intracerebroventricular administration of leptin or insulin48,49. Stated more simply, weight 
loss induced by fasting or caloric restriction stimulates a compensatory hyperphagia in part 
by increasing the rewarding properties of food, and this effect is mediated by reduced 
neuronal input from adiposity negative feedback signals. Clinical evidence in support of this 
assertion includes the finding that leptin administration reduces food intake in humans with 
congenital leptin deficiency. This effect is associated with decreases not only in the 
subjective experience of food reward but also in the activation of brain areas that are 
associated with reward (that is, the ventral striatum) in response to food-related stimuli50 
(FIG. 3).

The homeostatic regulation of food reward is the subject of recent reviews51,52. Briefly, 
brain reward circuits that process information related to food reward (for example, the 
hedonic value of and motivation to work for food) are influenced by metabolic and

hormonal signals that communicate information regarding the status of energy stores to the 
CNS. These reward circuits include mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons in the ventral 
tegmental area (VTA) that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and other forebrain 
areas53. With its supply of fibres from hypothalamic areas such as the ARC, as well as from 
reward-processing areas such as the NAc, the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) is proposed 
to integrate reward-related input with information related to energy homeostasis53. In turn, 
LHA neurons project to and influence the mesolimbic dopamine system54 as well as 
hindbrain areas such as the NTS that regulate satiety. To summarize, the energy homeostasis 
system functions through powerful and coordinated influences over the perception of satiety 
on the one hand and of food reward on the other.

Energy homeostasis neurocircuitry

Our understanding of the neurocircuitry of energy homeostasis has rapidly grown over the 
past decade. Among the most-studied and best-understood neuronal subpopulations are 
those that co-express neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein (AGRP; an antagonist of 
melanocortin signalling) and GABA16,55; these neurons are henceforth referred to as AGRP 
neurons. AGRP neurons are situated in the ARC and they stimulate feeding when they are 
activated56. Consistent with a role in energy homeostasis, AGRP neurons are inhibited by 
both insulin and leptin57-59, whereas they are activated by ghrelin60. In leptin-deficient 
ob/ob mice, these neurons are strongly activated, and this effect has been functionally linked 
to the pronounced hyperphagia in these mice55,61.

Adjacent to AGRP cells in the ARC are neurons that express pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) 
and release α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which inhibits food intake by 
binding to and activating neuronal melanocortin receptors. Unlike AGRP neurons, POMC 
neurons are stimulated by leptin62,63 and they are inhibited in leptin-deficient states62. 
However, caution is warranted when generalizing the role of POMC neurons, as several 
distinct subsets have been reported, some of which are leptin-responsive64, whereas others 
are responsive to insulin. Surprisingly, whereas leptin depolarizes and increases firing of 
POMC cells, insulin has the opposite effect64. Nevertheless, insulin and leptin activate 
overlapping signal transduction and transcriptional cascades in POMC neurons65, and the 
functional significance of the effects of these hormones on membrane potential is unknown. 
Still other POMC neuronal subsets are activated by ascending serotonergic input66 or by 
glutamatergic neurons located in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN)67, whereas 
they are inhibited by GABAergic input from AGRP neurons57.

Weight loss activates AGRP neurons, which inhibits POMC neurons, and these effects are 
triggered at least in part by reduced leptin signalling. It is therefore somewhat surprising that 
only a mild obesity phenotype results when leptin receptors are deleted from both POMC 
and AGRP neurons67-69, whereas pan-hypothalamic leptin receptor deletion recapitulates the 
severe obesity and hyperphagia phenotype of mice lacking leptin receptors altogether70. 
These and other observations support the hypothesis that although leptin can act directly on 
leptin receptors expressed by POMC and AGRP neurons, these neurons can also be 
regulated through indirect effects mediated by leptin-responsive neurons that are situated 
upstream.

Although ARC neurons remain a major research focus, leptin clearly influences energy 
balance through effects in other brain areas both within the hypothalamus (for example, the 
VMN71) and outside the hypothalamus (for example, the VTA72,73 and NTS40,74). With 
respect to neuronal subtypes that are important in leptin action, a role has been suggested for 
hypothalamic GABAergic neurons (which are typically detected by the expression of the 
vesicular GABA transporter (also known as vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter)). 
Deletion of leptin receptors from GABAergic neurons causes a much more pronounced 
obesity phenotype75 than that induced by leptin receptor deletion from AGRP and/or POMC 
cells69,76. A caveat to these observations is that GABAergic neurons constitute a majority of 
hypothalamic leptin-responsive cell types (including, for example, AGRP neurons), and 
hence leptin receptor deletion from these cells has a greater effect than that which would be 
expected in a more select neuronal subpopulation. In this context, it is of interest that some 
GABAergic neurons also synthesize nitric oxide, and leptin receptor deletion from neurons 
that express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) causes severe hyperphagia and obesity77. 
These leptin-responsive GABAergic neurons are found in both the ARC and dorsomedial 
nucleus (DMN), and in response to leptin, they are hypothesized to inhibit downstream 
neurocircuits that are ‘hardwired’ to drive feeding (perhaps including AGRP neurons).

Recent observations point to an important and specific role for GABA originating in AGRP 
neurons in the control of feeding behaviour. Deletion of GABA signalling (by deletion of 
the vesicular GABA transporter) from AGRP neurons results in mice characterized by a lean 
phenotype that are resistant to diet-induced obesity (DIO)78. Perhaps more importantly, 
GABAergic projections from AGRP neurons tonically inhibit a subset of neurons in the 
parabrachial nucleus (PBN) that, when activated, trigger profound anorexia79,80. These PBN 
neurons, discussed in greater detail below, are marked by expression of calcitonin and 
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and their activation after the ablation of AGRP 
neurons induces potentially fatal anorexia in mice81.

Identification of neural circuits for feeding

The combination of mouse genetics with optogenetics or DREADD (designer receptor 
exclusively activated by a designer drug) technology has enabled investigation into the 
feeding effects induced by activating or inhibiting defined neuronal subsets in live, 
conscious adult mice82,83. For example, studies using optogenetic as well as 
pharmacogenetic (DREADD-mediated) strategies show that AGRP neuron activation is 
sufficient to rapidly and potently stimulate feeding84-86. Moreover, this voracious feeding 
response occurs irrespective of nutritional state (that is, in well-fed mice), time of day and 
without training, and instead primarily depends on the level of AGRP neuron activity84. 
Activation of these neurons also increases both the motivation to work for food (as assessed 
by a progressive ratio test or lever pressing) and food-seeking behaviour86, whereas 
selective inhibition of AGRP neurons reduces feeding84. Thus, hyperphagia associated with 
reduced leptin signalling (for example, in ob/ob or db/db mice, fasting and uncontrolled 
insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus (uDM))87-89 probably involves activation of AGRP 
neurons (FIG. 4).

Recent research has shed light on the respective roles of the three mediators contained 
within AGRP neurons: AGRP, NPY and GABA. Using DREADD technology in three 
different mouse models, Lowell and colleagues tested the individual contributions made by 
GABA, NPY or AGRP to feeding induced by AGRP neuron activation90. They found that 
the presence of either GABA or NPY is sufficient to rapidly stimulate feeding upon AGRP 
neuron activation. Although AGRP release alone failed to increase food intake in the short 
term, it did so effectively over a longer time interval90. Although the time course of their 
effects can differ, release of any of the three mediators contained within AGRP neurons is 
sufficient to comparably and potently stimulate feeding.

Although stimulation and inhibition of POMC neurons using either optogenetics or 
DREADDs in mice reduces and increases food intake, respectively84,85, these effects do not 
occur rapidly. Thus, POMC cells may primarily participate in long-term rather than short-
term control of feeding84,85. This observation fits with the delayed onset of feeding induced 
by local release of AGRP alone90, as AGRP acts by inhibiting neuronal melanocortin 
receptors. The observation also implies that the inhibition of POMC neurons by AGRP 
neuron activation (through type A GABA (GABAA) receptors)57 does not explain the 
associated acute stimulation of food intake.

Studies to identify a ‘feeding circuit’ activated by AGRP neurons have thus far focused on 
the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) on the basis of evidence that 
photoactivation of AGRP axons in this brain area mimics the feeding effect of activating 
AGRP neurons in the ARC85. The relevant PVN neurons (which are characterized by the 
expression of single-minded homologue 1 (SIM1)) seem to be inhibited by input from 
AGRP neurons, as activation of these PVN neurons reduces food intake and reverses the 
hyperphagic effect of AGRP neuron activation, including effects on both food seeking and 
willingness to work for food85. Conversely, electrolytic lesioning of the PVN (like AGRP 
neuron activation) has long been known to induce hyperphagic obesity91.

Melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) mediates many of the feeding effects of both AGRP and 
POMC neurons. The importance of this receptor in energy homeostasis was first established 
by the obese phenotype of MC4R-knockout mice92. Subsequent studies found that MC4R 
mutation is the most common cause of monogenic obesity in humans93,94, accounting for up 
to 6% of early-onset or severe adult obesity cases95. The PVN has been implicated as a key 
site for the inhibitory effect of MC4R signalling on food intake, as MC4Rs are abundantly 
expressed in this brain area96, the PVN is heavily innervated by both AGRP and POMC 
neurons97and food intake is reduced by administration of MC4R agonists directly into the 
PVN98. Furthermore, re-expression of MC4Rs in SIM1 (that is, PVN) neurons rescues 
hyperphagia in MC4R-null mice99, whereas regulation of energy expenditure by MC4R is 
mediated by sympathetic preganglionic neurons100.

Among several distinct subsets of PVN neurons that are likely to participate in the control of 
food intake are those that express oxytocin and seem to be components of the pathway 
activated by leptin. Following either systemic or central administration, oxytocin reduces 
food intake and body weight in obese as well as lean animals101-104. This effect is mediated 
in part by projections to the NTS, where oxytocin release seems to enhance the hindbrain

response to gut-derived satiety signals such as CCK, leading to the consumption of smaller 
meals105. In support of this concept, leptin-responsive oxytocin neurons in the PVN project 
to the NTS, and leptin-induced anorexia requires oxytocin signalling106,107. Conversely, 
mice108 or humans109-111 with genetic disruptions in SIM1 as well as individuals with 
Prader–Willi syndrome112 are characterized both by the loss of PVN oxytocin neurons and 
by severe hyperphagia and obesity. This PVN–NTS oxytocin circuit therefore exemplifies 
how leptin-responsive hypothalamic neurons can inhibit feeding by enhancing the hindbrain 
response to satiety signals, although (as noted above) leptin can also reduce meal size 
through direct effects in the NTS40. Moreover, mice lacking either oxytocin113 or its 
receptor114 exhibit only a modest, late-onset obesity phenotype, and oxytocin neuron 
activation does not reduce food intake after a fast85. Thus, the importance of oxytocin 
neurons in energy homeostasis and obesity pathogenesis awaits further study.

Emergency circuits that stimulate feeding

An emerging concept in the neurobiology of food intake is that neurocircuits exist that are 
normally inhibited, but when activated in response to emergent or stressful stimuli they can 
override the homeostatic control of energy balance. Understanding how these circuits 
interact with the energy homeostasis system is fundamental to understanding the control of 
food intake and may bear on the pathogenesis of disorders at both ends of the body weight 
spectrum.

Hypoglycaemia

Although reduced food intake accompanies most stressful stimuli, inadequate delivery of 
glucose to the brain, termed ‘neuroglucopenia’ (also known as ‘glucoprivation’), is an 
exception. The response to hypoglycaemia exemplifies how the emergency created by 
neuroglucopenia activates neurocircuits that drive feeding along with wide-ranging 
neuroendocrine and autonomic ‘counter-regulatory’ responses that together function to raise 
blood glucose levels9,115. Components of the response include: suppression of insulin 
secretion; secretion of counter-regulatory hormones such as glucagon and adrenaline that 
function in a coordinated manner with the activation of the hypothalamus–pituitary-adrenal 
(HPA) axis; and increased sympathetic nervous system outflow to liver, islet and adrenal 
tissue. The net effect of these responses is to raise serum glucose levels by stimulating 
glucose production while inhibiting glucose uptake in peripheral tissues115-118 (BOX 1).

Information regarding glucose availability is conveyed to the brain from multiple sources, 
including the hepatic portal vein and glucose-sensing neurons in both the hindbrain119 and 
forebrain120, including the hypothalamus. Glucose-responsive neurons can either increase or 
decrease their firing rate as local glucose concentrations rise, with the former termed 
‘glucose-excited’ and the latter referred to as ‘glucose-inhibited’ neurons121. These glucose-
sensing neurons then project to integrative centres that are located in the hindbrain and the 
hypothalamus, with VMN neurons being strongly implicated in efferent responses that act to 
raise plasma glucose levels. Although the neurocircuitry that mediates glucose counter-
regulation remains poorly understood, both limbs of the autonomic nervous system are 
potently activated in an organ-specific manner. Parasympathetic outflow increases through 
neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus that supply pancreatic islets, and

sympathetic outflow increases through the intermedio lateral cell column of the spinal cord 
to stimulate glucose production by the liver and to activate the adrenal medulla while also 
stimulating pancreatic islets122. Thus, glucopenia-induced glucagon secretion is stimulated 
by the activation of both parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons supplying the islet.

A potent and sustained increase in food intake also accompanies these responses (termed 
‘neuroglucopenic feeding’ (also known as ‘glucoprivic feeding’)), and this increase is so 
robust that it overrides control exerted by the energy homeostasis system. Stated differently, 
neuroglucopenia stimulates feeding irrespective of body fuel stores or plasma levels of 
leptin or insulin123 and, consequently, obesity can result from repeated bouts of 
neuroglucopenia over a prolonged period. Indeed, the flawed notion that excess insulin is a 
cause of obesity stems in part from the early observation that pathological weight gain can 
be induced by repeated administration of insulin at doses sufficient to cause 
hypoglycaemia124. However, this effect results from neuroglucopenic feeding rather than 
from insulin itself.

From a teleological perspective, the notion that neuroglucopenic feeding should override the 
energy homeostasis system is logical in that maintaining stable body fat stores over time is 
of little use if plasma glucose levels are too low to support brain function. Thus, hyperphagic 
feeding is sustained until glucopenia has resolved, at which point the energy homeostasis 
system can re-engage to offset any increase in body fat mass sustained in the process of 
restoring euglycaemia.

A role for NPY in neuroglucopenic feeding has been suggested, as this response is blunted 
in NPY-deficient mice125 and ARC NPY-containing neurons (AGRP neurons) are activated 
by neuroglucopenia126. However, these neurons do not seem to be required for 
neuroglucopenic feeding127,128, as hypoglycaemia induces hyperphagia in mice even after 
AGRP neurons have been ablated127. Hindbrain catecholamine neurons that project to the 
PVN may also drive neuroglucopenic feeding119, as destruction of these neurons selectively 
blocks this feeding response but leaves fasting-induced feeding responses intact129. These 
and other findings suggest that neuroglucopenic feeding can be induced by any of several 
components of a distributed neuronal system, at least some of which are distinct from 
neurocircuits that drive hyperphagia after a fast.

Diabetic hyperphagia

Type 1 diabetes is a human disease caused by autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting 
pancreatic β-cells. In the absence of insulin treatment, profound hyperglycaemia is 
accompanied by progressive weight loss because insulin deficiency impairs fat storage in 
adipose tissue. In the absence of insulin therapy, the resultant depletion of body fat causes 
deficiency of leptin as well as insulin130. Recent experiments in rodent models of uDM, in 
which hyperglycaemia is induced using the β-cell toxin streptozotocin (STZ), have begun to 
change our thinking about mechanisms underlying diabetic hyperphagia.

In addition to severe weight loss, hyperglycaemia and ketosis, uDM is accompanied by 
hyperphagia and many of the same neuroendocrine and autonomic responses that are 
induced by neuroglucopenia (BOX 1). These responses include increased plasma levels of

glucagon, catecholamines and corticosterone that collectively act to increase hepatic glucose 
production115,131. Moreover, sympathetic outflow to thermogenic brown adipose tissue is 
reduced in both neuroglucopenia and uDM, and the reproductive, growth and thyroid axes 
are inhibited in both conditions as well. Therefore, in uDM, hyperglycaemia seems to be 
driven by many of the same behavioural, autonomic and neuroendocrine responses that are 
elicited by neuroglucopenia9,132.

Virtually all of these responses are also present in fasting133 and ob/ob mice134, both of 
which, like uDM, are characterized by leptin deficiency. Together, these observations 
suggest that the brain response to leptin deficiency recapitulates the response that is induced 
by hypoglycaemia, a concept that seems paradoxical in that plasma glucose levels are high 
in both uDM and ob/ob mice and low in fasting and hypoglycaemia. However, this view is 
consistent with a model in which the CNS response to a deficiency of immediately available 
fuel (for example, glucose) overlaps with the CNS response to depletion of stored body fuel 
(as reflected by deficient leptin signalling). That is, the response to a deficiency of currently 
available fuel involves the same neuro circuits that respond to a pending fuel deficiency; in 
each case, the response functions to raise blood glucose levels and thereby ensure an 
adequate supply of fuel to the brain. This concept is consistent with the observation that 
intracerebroventricular leptin administration ameliorates each of these responses in rats and 
mice with leptin deficiency induced by STZ-DM135-138, whereas restoring neuronal glucose 
availability reverses these conditions in neuroglucopenia. These observations support a 
model in which plasma glucose levels provide the brain with a crucial signal of immediately 
available fuel, whereas plasma leptin levels signal the amount of stored fuel (in the form of 
adipose tissue) and that deficiency of either triggers essentially the same brain response. 
This modification of the ‘selfish brain hypothesis’ (REF. 139) has interesting potential 
implications for obesity pathogenesis, and these are discussed below.

Implications for obesity pathogenesis

In normal-weight individuals, the energy homeostasis system robustly defends against both 
weight loss and weight gain140,141. The homeostatic response to weight loss has important 
clinical implications in that it explains how weight lost by dietary and/or lifestyle 
intervention tends to be regained over time in obese humans142,143. Conversely, available 
data from studies in rodents144 as well as humans145,146 show that the energy homeostasis 
system also protects against pathological weight gain. Specifically, when weight is increased 
by involuntary (or ‘forced’) overfeeding, a dramatic reduction in caloric intake occurs that is 
sustained until body weight returns to its pre-intervention level145. From this observation, 
we infer that obesity does not arise simply from the passive accumulation of excess body fat 
but rather is a state in which the defended level of body fat has increased141. Indeed, 
overweight individuals defend their increased body fat stores as robustly as lean 
individuals145,147-149. Consistent with this view, the main challenge confronting successful 
obesity treatment is that voluntary weight loss is resisted by homeostatic responses that 
eventually promote the recovery of lost weight.

One possible explanation for the biological defence of increased body fat mass involves the 
phenomenon of leptin resistance. This hypothesis has its origin in the observations that

leptin levels are increased in obese individuals14 and that the ability of leptin to reduce food 
intake and body weight is blunted in most obese animals and humans18,150-152. However, 
leptin resistance is a term that should be used cautiously, as a reduced behavioural or 
metabolic response to leptin can occur even when the response of cells and tissues to leptin 
is entirely normal (for example, when the underlying defect lies downstream of neurons that 
respond directly to leptin). Nevertheless, evidence suggests that in rodent models of DIO, 
both the ability of leptin to cross the blood-brain barrier and its capacity to activate neuronal 
leptin receptor signalling are impaired153.

Although the cause of obesity-associated leptin resistance is unknown, inflammation, gliosis 
and injury affecting hypothalamic neurons may have a role154-158. Inflammation and gliosis 
are detected in the rat or mouse ARC within the first few days of exposure to a high-fat diet, 
well before obesity develops159, and these effects could favour weight gain by impairing the 
response of key neurons to insulin and leptin. In this scenario, input from leptin would need 
to be increased for ‘normal’ energy homeostasis to occur (for example, maintenance of 
neutral energy balance and stable body fat mass over time), and expansion of fat stores is the 
body’s only way to increase plasma leptin levels. Accordingly, body fat mass will increase 
until input from leptin (combined with other adaptive changes, such as the increased energy 
cost associated with increased body weight) increases sufficiently to create a new steady 
state in which body weight is once again stabilized, albeit at a raised level.

Consistent with this hypothesis, experimental activation of hypothalamic inflammatory 
pathways (such as inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB kinase-(IKKβ)–nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) 
signalling) promotes hyperphagia and weight gain, predisposes to DIO and blunts the 
anorectic effects of insulin and leptin160. Conversely, interventions that reduce hypothalamic 
inflammation can reduce food intake and body weight, and improve hypothalamic insulin 
and leptin sensitivity157,160.

A recent study suggests that hypothalamic inflammation induced by high-fat feeding 
involves neuronal injury — the basis of which remains unknown — which in turn triggers 
an associated reactive gliosis (the recruitment and activation of microglia and astrocytes)159. 
In its early stages, this gliosis may be neuroprotective, but with prolonged exposure to a 
high-fat diet, permanent damage to or loss of neurons involved in energy homeostasis (that 
is, POMC neurons) can occur159,161. Additional research is needed to assess the causal 
nature of the relationship between hypothalamic inflammation, gliosis and neuron injury and 
the pathogenesis of DIO, and to determine whether these responses are reversible and/or can 
be blocked by therapeutic intervention.

Regardless of the underlying mechanism, reduced neuronal leptin sensitivity seems to 
trigger adaptive responses that are by and large the same as those induced by 
neuroglucopenia (BOX 1). The predicted result is not only the biological defence of an 
increased level of body fat mass among obese, leptin-resistant individuals but also the 
defence of increased blood glucose levels and an associated impairment in glucose 
tolerance. Thus, if the brain leptin signal is not effectively transmitted to key hypothalamic 
neurocircuits, increases in glycaemia as well as food intake will occur until a new steady

state is reached, one that is marked by delivery of leptin as well as glucose in amounts 
sufficient to silence the adaptive response.

The neurobiology of stress-induced anorexia

Reduced food intake is common to many types of stress — whether being chased by a 
predator, in response to trauma or illness, or following exposure to noxious substances. As 
the need to maintain body fat stores would seem to be of secondary importance under such 
circumstances, anorexia effectively overrides control of feeding by the energy homeostasis 
system. It is as if an ‘off switch’ has been turned on, ensuring that feeding does not occur 
until the threat has passed.

Palmiter and colleagues81 have recently identified a subset of neurons situated in the PBN 
that may function as one such off switch for feeding. The PBN is a relay station that receives 
both visceral and gustatory information and plays a part in protection against the 
consumption of unfamiliar or potentially toxic substances. In normal rodents, this protection 
manifests as neophobia (for example, avoidance of a novel taste or food until its post-
ingestive consequences are determined) and conditioned taste aversion (CTA)162. Thus, 
when confronted with a novel-tasting food with no previously known gustatory association, 
little is consumed until the consequences of doing so are known, and foods that elicit an 
aversive experience will be avoided in the future. These responses are presumed to have 
survival value because they protect against the consumption of potentially harmful foods162.

Lithium chloride and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are agents that, when administered to 
rodents, mimic the consumption of chemical and bacterial toxins, respectively. As such, 
each induces anorexia and can support CTA formation. The PBN is implicated in these 
responses as both lithium chloride and LPS activate PBN neurons, and lesions of the PBN 
prevent CTA formation163,164. Contained within the PBN are CGRP-expressing neurons 
that project to the amygdala and are implicated as mediators of anorexia that is induced by 
stressful stimuli81. The activity of these neurons increases in response to input from 
ascending projections from the caudal hindbrain, although conversely, they are tonically 
inhibited by GABAergic input from AGRP neurons79-81. Using a combination of viral and 
genetic approaches, a recent study showed that these PBN CGRP neurons are activated by 
both lithium chloride and LPS81, and that activation of these neurons in unstressed mice 
(using either optogenetics or DREADD technology) causes feeding to decrease or even to 
cease altogether. With repeated stimulation, animals continue to exhibit anorexia even when 
they are threatened with death from starvation79-81 (FIG. 5).

Perhaps most importantly, the anorexia induced by lithium chloride and LPS is blocked 
when PBN CGRP neurons are inhibited81, whereas inhibition of these neurons has no effect 
on intake in normal, unstressed animals; the latter finding fits with evidence that under usual 
conditions, these neurons are already inhibited, at least in part by GABAergic input from 
AGRP neurons. Taken together, these findings suggest that one function of neurons in 
energy homeostasis circuits (for example, AGRP neurons) is to inhibit neurons in 
emergency feeding circuits (for example, CGRP neurons). However, when faced with a 
stress that is sufficient to override this inhibition, feeding ceases until the stress has passed.

Implications for disease states

Wasting illness is common not only in cancer but also in chronic infectious, inflammatory 
and other disorders. In these conditions, wasting is a major cause of morbidity and 
mortality8, and insight into its pathogenesis has proven elusive despite decades of study. 
Empirically, wasting can be considered a state in which the energy homeostasis system does 
not function properly, as food intake remains low irrespective of the amount of weight 
lost165. Furthermore, weight loss in normal individuals is typified by the preferential 
depletion of body fat, with relative sparing of lean mass, whereas wasting illness is 
characterized as cachexia, which is defined as progressive weight loss without sparing of 
lean mass.

With this background, the identification and characterization of CGRP neurons by the 
Palmiter group raises an important question: does chronic activation of this or a similar 
endogenous ‘off switch’ for feeding drive the pathogenesis of wasting illness in diseases 
such as cancer? Perhaps certain tumours (or the body’s response to tumour cells) might 
result in the production of factors that activate CGRP neurons in the PBN, thereby causing 
inexorable, unrelenting weight loss that completely overrides the energy homeostasis 
system. If this hypothesis is correct, silencing these neurons should improve the wasting 
disorder or even induce its remission. We view testing of this hypothesis as an important 
scientific priority.

Summary and conclusions

That robust and powerful systems ensure that the body’s ongoing energy demands are met 
comes as no surprise. At the same time, carrying either too much or too little body fat can be 
maladaptive. To address these competing needs, the energy homeostasis system evolved to 
enable animals to match energy intake to energy expenditure over long time intervals and 
thereby ensure stability in the amount of body energy stored as fat. However, under 
pathological conditions, activation of an unrelated set of neurocircuits can override control 
exerted by the energy homeostasis system, leading to common and potentially serious 
disorders at either end of the body weight spectrum.

A key goal underlying efforts to delineate energy homeostasis neurocircuits is to facilitate 
the discovery of effective new therapeutic modalities, but little progress has been made in 
this effort to date. Bariatric surgery can effectively induce and sustain weight loss, but the 
underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Possibilities include both neural 
mechanisms (for example, activation of a ‘gut–brain’ axis by re-routing or accelerating the 
flow of intestinal nutrients) and humoral mechanisms (for example, markedly increasing the 
secretion of satiety-inducing gut peptides)166, but how these or other such effects ultimately 
lower the defended level of body fat mass remains unclear.

Options for medical therapy increased following the US Food and Drug Administration 
approval of both lorcaserin (Belviq), a 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 2C agonist, and 
Qsymia, a drug that combines phentermine (an adrenergic agonist) with the anticonvulsant 
topiramate. Lorcaserin-induced weight loss is probably mediated at least in part by 
activation of POMC neurons167 and, although the drug’s safety profile is favourable,

efficacy is modest168. Qsymia is a somewhat more potent weight loss agent169, but how 
topiramate affects energy homeostasis neurocircuitry is unknown. Clearly, there is ample 
room for improvement where treatment of obesity and other weight disorders is concerned, 
and efforts to delineate energy homeostasis and stress-responsive neurocircuitry have great 
potential to move the field forward. Recent technological advances offer exciting new tools 
with which to accomplish these goals and obtain information that will inform strategies for 
more effective approaches to the treatment of these common and debilitating disorders.

Box 1

Behavioural, autonomic and neuroendocrine responses to current or 
pending energy deficiency

In response to conditions of either acute energy deficiency (for example, hypoglycaemia) 
or chronic energy deficiency (for example, leptin deficiency), the brain initiates a shared 
set of behavioural, autonomic and neuroendocrine responses that are designed to increase 
the availability of fuel to the CNS while also conserving fuel stores. Among the 
responses are increases in both feeding and hepatic glucose production (HGP), with the 
latter effect mediated in part by increased plasma levels of glucagon and corticosterone 
(through activation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis). At the same 
time, the body conserves energy by inhibiting energy-expensive processes such as growth 
and reproduction while reducing metabolic rate through the suppression of the 
hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis. These various responses are elicited by both 
hypoglycaemia and uncontrolled insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus (uDM) despite the 
fact that blood glucose levels are low in the former and high in the latter. Thus, one cause 
of hyperglycaemia in uDM is the pathological activation of the same responses that are 
also observed in hypoglycaemia, presumably in response to deficient leptin input to the 
brain.

Consistent with this hypothesis, central leptin infusion restores euglycaemia in rats and 
mice with uDM135-138. Similarly, the behavioural, autonomic and neuroendocrine 
responses that are observed in hypoglycaemia and uDM are also elicited in other leptin-
deficient conditions (for example, fasting and in ob/ob mice); again, these responses are 
ameliorated by administering leptin directly into the brain61,133. Thus, conditions 
associated with central leptin deficiency are characterized by both hyperphagia and raised 
HGP, presumably reflecting activation of some of the same neurocircuits that are 
involved in the counter-regulatory response to neuroglucopenia.

In summary, the CNS monitors signals that are pertinent to both immediately available 
fuel (for example, glucose) and the status of fuel stores (for example, leptin), with 
deficiency of either hypothesized to activate the same neurocircuitry. The result is a 
potent increase in both feeding and HGP until blood glucose (and leptin) levels have 
risen sufficiently to turn off the response.

Figure 1. CNS regulation of energy homeostasis
The CNS integrates input from long-term energy stores (for example, leptin) and short-term 
meal-related signals (nutrients and gut-derived satiety signals) to regulate food intake and 
energy expenditure in a manner that maintains stable body fat stores over time. Positive 
energy balance induced by overfeeding inhibits the rewarding properties of food while 
enhancing meal-induced satiety, thereby reducing food intake. In response to energy 
deprivation, CNS adaptive responses are engaged that both increase the rewarding properties 
of food and reduce the response to satiety signals, collectively resulting in increased food 
consumption until deficient fat stores are replenished. CCK, cholecystokinin; FFAs, free 
fatty acids; GLP1, glucagon-like peptide 1. Modified from Marx, J. Cellular warriors at the

Figure 2. Integration of long-term homeostatic and short-term satiety signals
A model describing homeostatic control of body adiposity proposes that regulation of food 
intake on a meal-to-meal basis is adjusted in response to changes in body fat content. 
Through actions in both the forebrain and hindbrain, the adiposity negative feedback signal 
leptin enhances responsiveness to gut-derived satiety signals such as cholecystokinin (CCK), 
which are released upon food ingestion. In addition to direct effects on hindbrain areas such 
as the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), leptin stimulates pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) 
neurons but inhibits neurons that express agouti-related protein (AGRP) and neuropeptide Y 
(labelled as just AGRP) in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). These neurons project 
to second-order neurons in adjacent hypothalamic nuclei, including the paraventricular 
nucleus (PVN) and lateral hypothalamic area (not shown), which, in turn, project to the 
NTS, where satiety signals are processed. Satiety signals activate vagal afferents that 
terminate in the NTS to promote the termination of a meal. The NTS response to the satiety 
response is amplified both by direct input to the NTS from leptin and indirectly through the 
action of leptin in the hypothalamus. Consequently, reduced leptin action (for example, 
following weight loss) increases meal size by reducing the hindbrain response to satiety 
signals. GI, gastrointestinal. Figure from REF. 4, Nature Publishing Group.

Figure 3. Integration of homeostatic and reward-related inputs
Homeostatic signals modulate the perception of food reward (for example, the hedonic value 
and the motivation to work for food). Mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons in the ventral 
tegmental area (VTA) project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and other brain areas to 
heighten the reward value of palatable food. Neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) 
integrate reward-related input from the NAc with information related to energy homeostasis 
from arcuate nucleus (ARC) neurons. In turn, LHA neurons project to and influence the 
mesolimbic dopaminergic system while also influencing satiety perception through 
projections to the hindbrain (not shown). Weight loss lowers plasma insulin and leptin levels 
while increasing plasma ghrelin levels. Working in concert, these responses increase the 
rewarding properties of food and hence the motivation to eat through either direct effects in 
the ventral striatum or indirect effects in the hypothalamus through the LHA. Conversely, 
following periods of positive energy balance, body weight is returned to its biologically 
defended level through both a decrease in the rewarding properties of food and an increased 
response to input from satiety signals. AMY, amygdala.

Figure 4. Neurocircuits involved in the homeostatic regulation of feeding
Neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) 
sense and respond to peripheral energy signals to promote energy homeostasis. 
Neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and neurotransmitters such as GABA, among 
others, are released onto downstream neurons including those in the paraventricular nucleus 
(PVN). In the PVN, oxytocin and other neurons tonically inhibit feeding and, during energy 
deficit, are inhibited by orexigenic input from the ARC, thereby stimulating feeding. The 
same agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons (which co-express GABA and NPY) that are 
involved in short-term feeding also contribute to long-term energy balance through the 
release of AGRP, an inverse agonist of melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) and, through 
GABA release, inhibit neighbouring pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. POMC 
neurons are stimulated by input from leptin, and the release of α-melanocyte stimulating 
hormone (α-MSH) activates MC4R, thereby inhibiting food intake. In addition, recent 
evidence also implicates leptin-responsive GABAergic neurons that express neuronal nitric 
oxide synthase (nNOS) in the regulation of energy homeostasis. These neurons are found in 
the ARC and dorsomedial nucleus (not shown) and are hypothesized (dashed line) to inhibit 
downstream neurocircuits that drive feeding. Collectively, this input is relayed to the PVN 
and lateral hypothalamic area (not shown) and integrated to modulate the rewarding 
properties of food and the response to satiety signals. GABAAR, type A GABA receptor;

Figure 5. Activation of emergency neurocircuits that inhibit feeding
Neurocircuits exist that, when activated, can override the homeostatic control of food intake. 
Recent work from the Palmiter laboratory suggests that calcitonin gene-related peptide 
(CGRP) neurons expressed in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) are an ‘off switch’ that can 
trigger anorexia in the context of emergency conditions (that is, illness, trauma or injury). 
The activity of this neurocircuit is constrained by inhibitory GABAergic input from agouti-
related protein (AGRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), but this inhibition can be 
overcome in response to trauma, illness or stress. Some PBN neurons express NMDA 
receptors (NMDARs) that are activated by glutamatergic input from neurons in the rostral 
nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), which in turn are regulated by serotonergic input from 
neurons located in the raphe magnus (RMg) and raphe obscurus (ROb). The net effect of 
activating this circuit is to activate CGRP neurons and thereby inhibit feeding. AMY,
