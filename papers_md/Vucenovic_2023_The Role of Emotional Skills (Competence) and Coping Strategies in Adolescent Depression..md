Abstract: Depression is a state of low mood that can lead to several negative outcomes on thoughts,
emotions, behaviors, and even physical state. With that in mind, it is important to detect individ-
uals at risk of developing depressive symptoms early and identify protective factors. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents emerged as one of the most vulnerable groups, with deteriorated
anxiety and depression due to imposed social isolation, reduced social activities, and concerns over
household status, health, and peer support. Distance learning through public service broadcasts
and online tools lasted for several months, posing the need for adjustment. This study aimed to
assess emotional competence and coping styles as predictors of depression in a sample of adolescents.
The study was conducted in-person on a sample of 142 high school students. A high percentage of
participants reported above-average levels of depression (21.1% severely depressed). On average,
girls reported higher levels of depression than boys (t = 3.86, p < 0.01). Gender differences were
also found in emotion-focused coping and avoidance, with girls scoring higher on both (p < 0.05).
However, there were no gender differences in problem-focused coping or emotional competence.
Hierarchical regression analysis concluded that perceiving and understanding emotions, expressing
and naming emotions, regulating emotions, and avoidance were signiﬁcant predictors of depression.
This regression model explained 53% of depression variance, with the regulation of emotions being
the most powerful predictor (p < 0.01). No mediating effect of coping styles on the relationship
between emotional competence and depression was found in this study.

1. Introduction

Depression has steadily risen in the last few decades, affecting almost all age groups
with early onset. It has become a global issue for youth mental health, especially after the
pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic severely threatened adolescents who faced imposed
restrictions, changes in educational and leisure practices, increased digital activity [1], and
disrupted interpersonal relations. According to the European Commission report [2], Euro-
pean adolescents’ mental health deteriorated before the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
during the pandemic, health scares, loneliness, and tension made them fear for their future
even more, and no other age group was affected like youth. Children and adolescents
appear to be the most vulnerable group, after the chronically ill or elderly population, since
they report deteriorated anxiety and depression levels after the pandemic [3]. Some data
claim that almost 80% of children were affected negatively by the pandemic conditions [4].
A recent Canadian study showed how adolescent depression increased in general but
increased even more within a female group [5]. Social isolation-imposed changes such as
loneliness and remote and virtual learning were indicated. Reduced activities disabled
valuable environmental protective factors such as social connection and support, which
are some of the main community-level resilience factors for youth exposed to childhood
adversity [6]. In Croatia, the ﬁrst wave of restrictions was introduced on March 16. Until the

end of May, distance learning was primarily delivered through public service broadcasts,
online learning platforms, and tools. On March 19, the government-imposed restrictions
on sports, culture, and religious and public gatherings. After that, the capital of Zagreb
was hit by an earthquake, travelling between cities was banned, and remote working was
encouraged wherever possible.

Adolescent depression manifests similarly to adults, with consistently low mood,
hopelessness, and disinterest in activities being the predominant symptoms. However, in
addition to lowered mood and increased dissatisfaction, adolescents tend to be angrier and
more irritable [7]. Such behavior can be mistaken for antisocial or acting-out tendencies.
Due to the growing prevalence of these symptoms and the fact that they are associated with
an increased risk of reduced quality of cognitive, social, academic, and personal life [8], a
more comprehensive understanding of this issue is necessary. Considering its early onset
and how strongly symptoms of depression in adolescence predict an episode of major
depression in adulthood [9], research efforts are needed to identify individuals at risk and
protective factors, both personal and environmental.

Adolescence might be the optimal period for prevention and developing healthy
habits for a lifetime [10]. Recent research highlights the role of emotional regulation [11]
and coping strategies [12]. Emotional intelligence represents the ability to effectively pro-
cess emotional information about oneself and others through emotional perception and
using emotions to facilitate thinking, emotional understanding, and regulation [13]. A
relationship between emotional intelligence and mental health has been found [14], and
the mediating role of emotional regulation was emphasized [15]. That alone shows why
adolescents with more advanced emotional intelligence express lower levels of depres-
sion. Emotion regulation skills develop through adolescence, and disrupted emotional
regulation is a symptom of both anxiety and depression, as was found in self-report and
neuroimaging measures [11].

A body of research focused on the relationship between coping styles and depres-
sion. Coping is generally deﬁned as a psychological response to a stressful situation
aimed at psychosocial adjustment. Lazarus and Folkman’s [16] stress and coping the-
ory differentiate problem-focused and emotion-focused coping. According to this theory,
problem-focused coping involves taking action to solve the problem and remove the stres-
sor. In contrast, emotion-focused coping reduces negative emotions associated with the
stressor. In addition, Endler and Parker [17] conceptualized avoidance as another coping
style based on psychological or behavioral distraction from the source of stress. A strong
connection exists between higher levels of depression and avoidance coping styles and
lower levels of depression and problem-focused coping styles [18]. Some authors suggest
that emotional intelligence affects depression by regulating coping styles [19]. There is a
possibility that emotional intelligence inﬂuences the selection and implementation of cop-
ing strategies, making emotionally competent individuals more likely to choose strategies
that lead to adjustment [19].

Higher levels of emotional intelligence, especially the ability to regulate emotions,
are often associated with more frequent use of problem-focused coping [20]. Emotional
intelligence affects the choice of coping style, which determines the level of depression.
Moreover, higher levels of emotional intelligence affect coping effectiveness by enhancing
the positive effect of active coping and minimizing the negative impact of avoidant coping
on mental health [21].

Despite speculations about the interaction of emotional intelligence and coping styles
in predicting depression, little research has empirically and systematically explored this
relationship and all the involved mechanisms. This study examines the role of emotional
competence and coping styles in predicting depression in adolescents. Based on previous
research, we expect girls to achieve signiﬁcantly higher results on depression and overall
emotional competence and to express a strong preference for an emotion-focused coping
style. Women tend to employ this style more often to manage stressors [22], and, inversely,
those who use it report more depressive symptoms [23]. Gender, emotional intelligence,

Eur. J. Investig. Health Psychol. Educ. 2023, 13

542

and coping styles are expected to signiﬁcantly predict levels of depression, with coping
styles as a mediator variable. Some authors [19] suggest that emotional intelligence affects
depression by regulating coping styles, leading individuals to choose strategies that provide
better outcomes, such as problem-solving or enhancing positive effects through social
support and less avoidant tendencies. Therefore, we are examining how accurate the
presented model is for adolescents in the post-COVID-19 era and whether emotional
regulation protects them even in such distorted social circumstances.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants

A total of 142 second-grade high school students from an urban area, living with
both parents and with no chronic illness or cognitive impairment, participated in the
research. Participants were introduced to the study details, and the researcher obtained
their written informed consent. We wanted to control for any age-related effects and
thus chose to narrow down the age group. Since school prevention programs in Croatia
started in second grade, we tried to collect pre-prevention intervention data for implication
purposes. Participants ﬁlled out an online survey during school hours to ensure the validity
of obtained data. The age of the participants ranged between 14 and 17 years, with a mode
value of 16 (108 participants) and a mean of 15.92 (SD = 0.53). Of the participants, 20 were
15-year-olds, and 14 were 17-year-olds. In total, 60% of them were females. No participants
were excluded from the analysis

2.2. Questionnaires

Gathered information from participants included: sociodemographic data (age, gender,
grade), the Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire (ESCQ-45), a short version
of the Coping Inventory for Adolescents, and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale
(DASS). All questionnaires were validated on a Croatian sample of adolescents.

2.2.1. The Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire (ESCQ-45)

The Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire (ESCQ-45) [24] was used to assess
emotional intelligence. The questionnaire consists of 45 items divided into three subscales:
the ability to perceive and understand emotions (15 items), the ability to express and name
emotions (14 items) and the ability to manage emotions (16 items). The participant’s task is
to assess the extent to which a particular item applies to them on a Likert-type scale (1–5).
The overall score is formed by dividing the sum of the results by the number of items,
where a higher score implies a higher level of emotional competence. The reliability of
the total score varies from α = 0.87 to α = 0.93 in this research, similar to the original
author’s ﬁndings.

2.2.2. Short Version of the Coping Inventory for Adolescents

A short version of the Coping Inventory for Adolescents [25] was used to determine
participants’ coping styles. It consists of 18 items divided into 3 subscales: Problem-focused
coping, emotion-focused coping, and avoidance. The participant’s task is to assess how
often they use a particular coping strategy on a Likert-type scale (1–4). Each subscale
forms into total sums, where a higher result means a greater tendency to use that coping
style. According to the authors, each subscale has adequate reliability, with avoidance
being the lowest. In our research, avoidance was the most reliable (α = 0.88), next to the
problem-focused (α = 0.74) and the emotion-focused coping subscale (α = 0.65).

2.2.3. Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)

The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) was used to assess the levels of depression
in adolescents [26]. The scale consists of 42 items divided into three subscales: Depression,
anxiety and stress (14 items each), and we used the depression subscale. Participants
estimate how often they experienced speciﬁc symptoms in the last week on a Likert-type

Eur. J. Investig. Health Psychol. Educ. 2023, 13

543

scale (0–3). The reliability for the depression subscale in Croatian validation was α = 0.85,
and in this research, it was α = 0.96.

2.3. Procedure

The study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the
University of Zagreb, Faculty of Croatian Studies (protocol code 380-58/506-22-0001). The
research was conducted during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and after the
lockdown, and schools were no longer practising online classes. After the methodological
and ethical approval, schools were contacted to grant classroom access. Principals and
staff were given detailed instructions about the research, following the Croatian Code
of Ethics for Research with Children and parental agreements for school extracurricular
activities. Parents were notiﬁed about the entire procedure in advance, and all of them gave
informed consent. Students were informed about the research’s aims, granted anonymity,
and signed the informed consent. After ﬁlling out the questionnaire, they were given a
short educational brochure about mental health, including a list of adolescent depression
symptoms and free public mental health practitioners in their school area.

2.4. Data Analysis

All analyses were made utilizing IBM® SPSS® Statistics version 29. To determine the
reliability of chosen questionnaires, we used Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient. Descriptive
analysis included the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-ﬁt test and Levene’s homogeneity
of variance test to ensure parametric preconditions. A T-test for independent samples
(Cohen’s D statistic) was used to estimate between-subjects effects. Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient was used for all variables measured on pseudo-interval Likert scales as a base
for hierarchical (linear) regression analysis and mediation analysis with the SPSS PROCESS
macro developed by Andrew Hayes (Model 1).

3. Results
3.1. Descriptive Data

We found no extreme results according to the z-values of individual results, as Field
and Miles [27] suggested. The next step was testing the parametric procedures’ assump-
tions, as presented in Table 1.

The Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-ﬁt test indicated that the abilities to perceive
and understand emotions and manage them ﬁt within a normal distribution range. At the
same time, all other variables signiﬁcantly deviated from it. Since the asymmetry values of
the distribution in this sample did not exceed 0.51, and the ﬂattening values did not exceed
0.88 (see Table 1), the distributions were considered normal for parametric procedures [28].
According to the DASS norms, most participants reported average levels of depression

Eur. J. Investig. Health Psychol. Educ. 2023, 13

544

(37.3%), while 21.1% suffered from extremely severe depression. Mild, medium, and severe
depression levels were evenly distributed at around 13–14% of our sample.

3.2. Gender Differences in Depression, Emotional Competence, and Coping Styles

A T-test for independent samples was conducted to determine gender differences
in the observed variables. Cohen’s D statistic conﬁrmed that, as expected, girls reported
signiﬁcantly higher levels of depression (d = 0.99), but there were no differences in self-
assessed emotional competence and problem-focused coping style. Results also suggest
gender differences in emotion-focused coping (d = 0.47) and avoidance (d = 0.59) styles,
which are more common for adolescent girls, as is shown in Table 2.

3.3. The Relationship between Depression, Emotional Competence, and Coping Styles

Our ﬁrst step was calculating a correlation matrix and Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient
for all variables measured on pseudo-interval Likert scales to determine whether selected
predictors correlate with the criteria variable, i.e., depression. As presented in Table 3, all
variables except for the ability to perceive and understand emotions correlate signiﬁcantly.
Between them, emotional competencies were more strongly associated with depression than
coping styles, and participants with higher emotional competencies reported lower levels
of depression. Additionally, emotion- and problem-oriented strategies were negatively
associated with depression, as opposed to avoidance style.

Emotional competence was signiﬁcantly related to problem-focused and emotion-
focused coping but not to avoidance style. As expected, a problem-focused coping style
was strongly associated with the ability to manage emotions through activities aimed at
handling stressful situations or eliminating their sources, and emotion-focused coping
showed the highest correlation with the strategy of naming and expressing emotions.
Furthermore, Table 4 shows the results of hierarchical regression analysis to determine

the independent and overall predictive value of gender, coping styles, and emotional
competence in predicting depression.

Given the established gender differences in depression, gender was used as the ﬁrst
independent predictor, but it covers only 9% of the variance in depressive symptoms. Cop-
ing styles explained an additional 22% in the next step, the same as emotional competence
in the third and ﬁnal steps. Overall, our model explained 53% of criteria variance and
conﬁrmed the hypothesized model of emotional intelligence and well-being [29], where
coping strategies represent mediator variables between EI and mental health outcomes
(Figure 1). Since correlation assumptions for that speciﬁc model are proven in our sample,
we proceeded with the mediation analysis steps [30] (see Table 5 and Figure 1) using the
PROCESS macro developed by Andrew Hayes [31], Model 1.

We proceeded with mediation analysis [30] and first checked the relationship be-tween the predictor and the criterion variable, which was significant (β = −0.44). The rela-tionship between the predictor (emotional competence) and the potential mediator (cop-ing styles) proved to be significant, except for the avoidance style. Therefore, avoidance was not included in the third step, where coping styles did not predict levels of depression after controlling for emotional competence, meaning we do not have enough evidence to make a conclusion about the presence of a mediating effect of coping styles. 4. Discussion The main goal of this research was to determine whether the assumed model [19] of gender, emotional competence, and coping style can predict depression levels in adoles-cents. Descriptive data showed that 63% of participants reported above-average or sub-syndromal levels of depression, suggesting adolescents were experiencing clinical symp-toms shortly after the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is in line with previ-ous research stating that between 20 and 50% of adolescents experience symptoms of de-pression [32]. The global prevalence rate of self-reported depressive symptoms among adolescents increased from 24% to 37% in 2001-2010 [33], and recent data suggest another decline in their general resilience and coping abilities.   Eur.

We proceeded with mediation analysis [30] and ﬁrst checked the relationship between

between the predictor (emotional competence) and the potential mediator (coping styles)
proved to be signiﬁcant, except for the avoidance style. Therefore, avoidance was not

4. Discussion

The main goal of this research was to determine whether the assumed model [19]
of gender, emotional competence, and coping style can predict depression levels in ado-
lescents. Descriptive data showed that 63% of participants reported above-average or
subsyndromal levels of depression, suggesting adolescents were experiencing clinical
symptoms shortly after the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is in line with
previous research stating that between 20 and 50% of adolescents experience symptoms of
depression [32]. The global prevalence rate of self-reported depressive symptoms among
adolescents increased from 24% to 37% in 2001–2010 [33], and recent data suggest another
decline in their general resilience and coping abilities.

4.1. Gender Differences in Depression, Emotional Competence, and Coping Styles

Previous ﬁndings [34] imply that gender differences in depression become noticeable
during puberty. The combined effect of biological factors, multiple changes in self-image,
and identity confusion can trigger negative affect, avoidance, and helplessness [35]. On
average, depression rises for female adolescents and remains relatively stable for boys [34].
Changes in puberty are only partially responsible. Other factors, such as negative cognitive
style, social pressure, and a higher frequency of stressful events, can contribute to the
increased risk of depression in adolescent girls [36]. Our ﬁndings support similar post-
pandemic reports where female adolescents were more vulnerable [5].

Regarding gender differences in levels of emotional competence, some research found
none [37], while others suggest that men tend to achieve higher levels on self-report
measures, while women perform better on objective measures, e.g., tests [38]. In addition,
emotional competence is not a one-dimensional construct, and some researchers state that
women develop a more remarkable ability to perceive emotions. At the same time, men are
better at managing emotions, perhaps due to better down-regulation of amygdala activity
combined with less prefrontal activity during regulation, making them more effective in
regulating negative emotions [39]. While no signiﬁcant gender differences were found in
problem-focused coping, the emotion-focused and avoidance styles were more frequent
in girls. We could argue that the avoidance style is more commonly found in clinical
groups regardless of gender, as it was found that immature defense styles and avoidance

Eur. J. Investig. Health Psychol. Educ. 2023, 13

547

coping mediated psychiatric symptomatology after victimization [40]. Another viewpoint
derives from social role theory, where social behavior tends to be affected by widely shared
gender stereotypes, one of which is the tendency to express feelings openly, which could
explain why females are more inclined to use emotion-based coping strategies and social
support-seeking.

Women tend to use social support more often in stressful situations, and items from
that speciﬁc subscale partially measure social support seeking. Regarding problem-oriented
coping, previous research is not consistent, but it seems that, on average, men (or those
high in masculinity) use problem-focused coping strategies more often [41]. It appears that
gender affects both perceptions of a situation as stressful (or not) and the coping response
or behaviors and their consequences [42]. However, results indicating a greater tendency to-
ward the avoidance style in women should be interpreted cautiously. Although many other
authors agree with this outcome [43], others point out that men prefer avoidance strate-
gies [44] to compass emotional distance, which can help reduce stress short-term through
distraction and denial. These inconsistencies may also reﬂect differences in theoretical
operationalizations of coping mechanisms, stress, and general vulnerability.

The bivariate correlation analysis results indicated a moderate to high correlation
between emotional competence and depression, as expected in previous reports [15]. Total
ESCQ-45 score and naming and managing emotions were negatively related to depression,
in accordance with the rest of the empirical data [45]. Emotion-focused coping showed the
highest correlation with the strategy of naming and expressing emotions since they tend
to help individuals to diminish the emotional consequences of stressful events, such as
expressing emotions destructively or inappropriately [46] and can help verbalize internal
mental health status when seeking help or support. The ability to perceive and understand
emotions was often positively linked to depression [38]. Understanding emotions is a nec-
essary ﬁrst step in expressing and managing them. However, prolonged focus on emotions
can lead to rumination, which triggers negative emotions and depressive symptoms [47].
For those reasons, recognizing and naming personal and other people’s emotional states is
an advantage for favorable outcomes only in low-stress environments or combined with
high emotional regulation. In another way, it can make youth more prone to experiencing
guilt, shame, anger, inadequacy, fear, and loneliness.

On average, participants with a more problem-focused [19] and emotion-focused
coping style had lower levels of depression, as was hypothesized based on comparative
research [48,49]. Avoidance was negatively linked to depression, as suggested by some
authors [18]. Focus on emotions proved to be an adaptive strategy for adolescents. Based
on this questionnaire, emotion-focused coping represents behaviors such as seeking social
support and openly expressing emotions. Perhaps emotion- and problem-oriented coping
are not necessarily opposing strategies. Rather than being opposites, when combined they
tend to lead to more favorable outcomes such as psychological adaptation [50].

Emotional competence and stress coping styles did not correlate entirely. Emotionally
competent adolescents preferred problem- and emotion-focused coping styles more than
avoidant ones. Emotional intelligence or emotional knowledge allows us to recognize,
select, and use more adaptive strategies in stressful situations [20,21]. Effective coping with
pressure, conﬂict, and interpersonal relations is an essential trait of emotionally intelligent
individuals [51]. They tend to modify their environments to reduce frustration and negative
emotions, monitor emotional cues and learn from social situations faster so they do not
have to use avoidance as a coping style [52]. Regulating emotions improves with age,
when prefrontal brain regions mature and our cognitive control and executive functioning
develop. That makes us successful in complex problem-solving, visualizing different
outcomes, and becoming less reactive to external stimuli [53].

4.2. The Relationship between Depression, Emotional Competence, and Coping Styles

The linear hierarchical regression analysis managed to predict depression in adoles-
cents. Gender and problem- and emotion-focused coping ceased to be signiﬁcant predictors
of depression when emotional competence entered analysis, as expected [14,48].

Only avoidance remained a signiﬁcant predictor of depression, and emotional compe-
tence did not affect avoidance in mediation analysis. Avoidance contributes to the main-
tenance of depressive symptoms by delaying the elimination of the source of stress [54].
Similarly, higher emotional intelligence helps maintain a stable mood after stressful situa-
tions, and thus leads to better adaptation [21]. Finally, some [55] believe that control over
rumination is key to emotional adaptation. An emotionally competent person will choose a
more adaptive coping strategy [19,56].

The mediating inﬂuence of stress coping styles on the relationship between emotional
competence and depression should have been veriﬁed. However, theoretical assumptions
for mediation were not achieved. Although authors assume that emotional intelligence
mitigates the negative impact of stress through selecting an adaptive coping strategy and
thus contributes to the preservation of mental health [56], only a few studies have examined
that [19]. Emotional intelligence could determine the choice of coping style, affecting
depression levels. A notable difference in research results might be the consequence
of the decision to use an emotional intelligence test instead of self-report measures [19].
Combined with zero evidence for gender differences in emotional competence, we conclude
that subjective measures may not be the best option for the adolescent population or should
be combined with more objective instruments.

4.3. Implications and Limitations

The results of this research represent valuable data about depression prevalence and
preferred coping styles in the Croatian youth population. They should be used primarily
as guidelines for future research and efforts to incorporate emotional literacy in school
programs in a way that promotes mental health and prolongs the onset of depression, but
that also serves as a tool for self-monitoring programs aimed at developing socio-emotional
skills in children, and adolescents have repeatedly proven to be efﬁcient in improving their
mental health and life satisfaction. Programs aimed at developing emotional competence
can signiﬁcantly improve adolescents’ mental health six months after the program [57].

The research was conducted on a small, non-random, convenient sample of adolescents
from only four high schools, reducing the external validity. Since the total population of
high school students in this city is around 35.000, the sample size should aim at a minimum
of 1–2% of the population (sample size calculation indicates at least 380 participants or,
as some suggest, over 250 to stabilize correlations [58]). However, most schools were
not allowing paper surveys and were still too concerned over coronavirus transmission,
but for the sake of internal validity, we opted for an in vivo approach at the expense of
sample size. It is possible that, based on some systematic factor, some students were more
inclined to participate in the research, contributing to higher average levels of depression.
Self-reports are traditionally loaded with several issues but remain a gold standard for
correlation research. Some additional predictor variables should be incorporated into a
comprehensive, longitudinal study. Perhaps controlling for ﬁve broad personality traits
would elucidate which individuals faced the most negative outcomes during the pandemic.
Several studies inspected differences in personality and cognitive skills. They found that
individuals high on openness and extraversion during the pandemic suffered more, while
those higher in agreeableness were less affected. In the same research, speciﬁc cognitive
skills presented risk factors for females [59]. Another key limitation represents possible
unmeasured confounders or spurious associations related to coping styles and mental
health, including physical health. In a more recent paper, emotional ability decreased with
age and lower income [60]. Education, recent income declines, and poor housing were
found to be associated with a higher prevalence of mental disorders in adults [61]. In

Eur. J. Investig. Health Psychol. Educ. 2023, 13

general, we excluded family-related variables that might have an impact, such as parental
education level, heredity of depression, etc.

To conclude, the COVID-19 pandemic posed a signiﬁcant threat to youths’ mental
health and was possibly mediated by coping styles, including behavior patterns such as
increased digital activity, physical activities, or even substance abuse during the lockdown
period. Young people, women, and minorities use social networks more often [62], and
while they are an important outlet for socializing, education, and fun, they can also indicate
avoidance strategies or entice social comparison, depression, fear of missing out, etc. It is
reported that students who used electronic devices after 10:00 pm during the last 6 months
had poorer academic performance and sleep quality [63]. Some might suggest that, during
the pandemic, adolescent substance use increased due to stress, social isolation, and even
boredom [64]. Worrying about a potential new wave of coronavirus could affect the
adolescent’s ability to experience positive emotions and trigger negative behavior patterns
during (partial) social isolation.

5. Conclusions

The obtained results indicate that some adolescents in Croatia experience severe
and extremely severe symptoms of depression, predominantly girls who also tend to use
avoidance strategies more often, perhaps due to a lack of social support or because their
social support system is ineffective in mitigating stress.

Emotional competence could predict depression symptoms, along with avoidance
strategies. We could theorize how the COVID-19 pandemic induced adolescents’ tendencies
to avoid unpleasant emotions, interpersonal conﬂicts, ﬁnancial difﬁculties, or any other ma-
jor repercussions of a lockdown. We could see how, for example, online schooling, academic
burnout, and social isolation could affect vulnerable youth. Even though our test model
explained 53% of the variance in depression, with the ability to manage emotions being the
most signiﬁcant predictor, there was no evidence supporting the hypothesized mediating
effect of coping styles, suggesting their effects are independent, but also that emotional
regulation is key concept to be explored and implemented in the school curriculum, such
as RULER [30,65].
