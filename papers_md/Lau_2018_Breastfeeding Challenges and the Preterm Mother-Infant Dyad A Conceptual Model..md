Breastfeeding Challenges
and the Preterm Mother-Infant Dyad:
A Conceptual Model

Chantal Lau

Abstract

Breastfeeding is an experience that only a mother and her infant(s) can share. Infants who can feed from the
breast receive not only the best nutrition but also, due to the close physical contact between mother and child, it
is the optimal nurturance they can receive from their mother. When breastfeeding is trouble free, maternal well-
being is uniquely heightened. However, breastfeeding remains a challenge for many mother-infant dyads and
more so for those whose infants are born prematurely. This article introduces a conceptual model of the
breastfeeding challenges facing preterm mother-infant dyads. It distinguishes between a maternal caregiving
and an infant growth/development components. Within the maternal component, two primary elements are
considered, that is, maternal behavioral and nutritional care. The two primary elements within the infant
component include infant non-nutritional and nutritional growth/development. It is proposed that an improved
understanding of the factors associated with these four elements and how they interplay with each other within
individual dyads will facilitate the identiﬁcation of the breastfeeding challenges facing these mother-infant
entities. Due to the intimate relationships existing between a mother and her infant(s), it is further advanced that
breastfeeding studies would be optimized if mother-infant pairs are studied as one entity rather than mother and
infant separately. It is proposed that this conceptual model will assist health professionals develop personalized
breastfeeding management plans for individual preterm mother-infant dyads, while furthering the development
of evidence-based interventions to optimize their breastfeeding experiences.

Introduction

The importance of breastfeeding has been advocated

for more than two decades and is supported by increas-
ing professional and public support throughout the world.1–9
Infants feeding from the breast receive not only the best
nutrition but also, due to the close physical contact between
mother and child, they are provided with the optimal nur-
turance from their mother.10–12 Breastfeeding initiation and
maintenance, however, remain a challenge for many mother-
infant dyads.2 It is an undertaking that does not involve only a
mother and her infant, but often that of well-intentioned family
members and friends, as well as health professionals when
necessary. It may also be compounded by uncontrollable
environmental and social factors such as family obligation
and support, lifestyle, maternal characteristics, and health.13–15
For the majority of mothers whose infants are born term,
this process evolves naturally. However, it is not so when

mothers are stressed and/or their infants are sick. For in-
stance, following a premature delivery with infants cared in
neonatal intensive care units (NICU), the mother-preterm
infant dyad is threatened by the fragility and immaturity of
the baby and the unique stress that their mothers experience in
the NICU environment.16,17

In an attempt to better understand the breastfeeding chal-
lenges facing preterm mother-infant dyads, a conceptual
model is introduced that distinguishes between two compo-
nents, that is, a maternal caregiving and an infant growth/
the maternal
development component (Fig. 1). In turn,
caregiving component comprises two elements, maternal
behavioral care and nutritional care/lactation, whereas the
infant component distinguishes between their non-nutritional
and nutritional growth/development. This model is based on
the working premise that, during breastfeeding, these four
elements are intimately connected and continually feed-
back positively or negatively on both partners of the dyad,

FIG. 1. Conceptual model of breastfeeding challenges facing preterm mother-infant dyad—A model presenting four
major elements, maternal behavioral and nutritional care and infant non-nutritional and nutritional growth/development,
making up the preterm mother-infant dyad with examples of external factors that may impact mother-infant breastfeeding
interactions. The bilateral interactions (solid line arrows) between maternal and infant elements represent the reciprocal
impact that each partner’s actions may have on the other, be they beneﬁcial or detrimental. The external factors (unidi-
rectional dashed arrows) have a unidirectional impact on mother and/or infant as they are not controlled by the dyad, be
they beneﬁcial or detrimental

modulating their interactions. It is advanced that in examin-
ing their individual interplays, a clearer understanding would
be gained as to how a mother and her infant reciprocal re-
sponses impact on one another’s actions.

It is well recognized that there exists many more fac-
tors that can disrupt the equilibrium described in Figure 1
such as maternal health or attributes, infant’s genetic makeup,
cultural/societal dogmas, and/or governmental policies. How-
ever, it is advanced that the four elements presented in this
model are the ones that have the most direct impact on
breastfeeding performance. On this basis, one may consider
these ‘‘disruptive’’ elements as stressors to the breastfeed-
ing mother-infant dyad.

The Preterm Mother-Infant Dyad

‘‘Breastfeeding’’ is deﬁned herein as a maternal behavior
insofar as it is a mother’s prerogative to breastfeed that will
allow her infant to feed at the breast rather than from a bottle.
In turn, given such opportunity, infants can only breastfeed
successfully if their oral feeding skills are sufﬁciently mature
to allow them to remain latched on to the breast for the du-
ration of a breastfeeding session.

The proposed conceptual framework is presented in Fig-
ure 1 with maternal behavior and nutritional care under the
maternal component and infant non-nutritive and nutritive
growth/development under the infant component. In addi-
tion, major ‘‘external factors,’’ for example, stress and NICU
environment, which may support or hinder a mother and/or
her preterm infant relationships are listed.

Maternal behavioral care deﬁnes the interactive actions
initiated by mothers toward their infant(s), for example,

willingness/interest
in breastfeeding, milk expression if
breastfeeding is not feasible, skin-to-skin holding, and daily
routine care for the infant’s welfare. Nutritional care (lac-
tation) relates to mothers’ ability to provide the appropriate
supply of their own milk to meet their infants’ nutritional
needs. In turn, infants’ non-nutritional growth/development
addresses their neurophysiologic, neuromotor, and neurobe-
havioral development, whereas the nutritional element fo-
cuses on infants’ ability to breastfeed safely and competently
to grow. Within the dyad, the relationship that mothers de-
velop with their infant(s) at the time of birth is essential in
optimizing the proper establishment of maternal caregiving
and infant growth/development.

Mother-infant interactions implicate a continual bidirec-
tional feedback system as their respective actions reciprocally
impact on one another, be they beneﬁcial or not. This rela-
tionship would be optimized if it is mutualistic, that is, a re-
ciprocal ‘‘give and take’’ interaction as both partners beneﬁt
from one another’s sensory and behavioral exchanges, thereby
optimizing the development of the mother-infant dyad.18,19 The
external factors predominantly have a unidirectional impact on
these four dyadic elements and are relatively ‘‘uncontrollable,’’
that is, their actions being imposed by environmental and social
conditions and/or well-intentioned care providers. It is the
complexity of all these interactions that often challenges the
ability of mothers and infants to succeed in breastfeeding.

The interactive ‘‘give and take’’ that develops between the
partners of the dyad may be ‘‘balanced’’ as often observed
between a mother and her healthy infant or ‘‘imbalanced’’
when one and/or both partners encounter difﬁculties of
their own.20,21 Following a premature delivery, the ‘‘imbal-
anced exchanges’’ primarily arise from infants’ immaturity,

10

fragility, and unstable medical status that require the care of
neonatal specialists. Along with prolonged hospitalization in
the stark environment of an NICU, the normal maternal
caregiving is disrupted with breastfeeding initiation and
maintenance frequently deferred. It is well acknowledged
that these unexpected detrimental events become signiﬁcant
stressors for these mothers.22–28

Mother caregiving

Maternal behavioral care. Within the animal kingdom,
humans are considered ‘‘semialtricial’’ as newborns are rel-
atively helpless and must rely on mother for nurturance,
nutrition, and locomotion.19,29 Mother can be viewed as the
active partner of the dyad, the initiator who nurtures and
feeds her child. Although infants may appear to be passive
recipients, their responses to maternal investment are essen-
tial for maintaining the quality of maternal care as both
partners’ reciprocal feedback is required to ensure the dyad’s
integrity.19,30–32 Studies have speculated on the genetics of
maternal behavior (motherhood) and their potential in af-
fecting maternal caregiving through neurohormonal
in-
volvement and activation of speciﬁc areas of the central
nervous system (CNS), for example, hypothalamus, amyg-
dala, and medial preoptic area.29,31,33–35

Maternal behavioral care includes functions such as nurtur-
ing, maintaining close physical contact with the infant through
skin-to-skin holding, attachment/bonding, appropriate respon-
siveness to infant’s cues to meet their needs, and provision of
needed care that the infant cannot perform.21,36–42 Over time,
‘‘balanced’’ mutualistic exchanges would be achieved if ma-
ternal and infant behaviors are synchronized with both partners
continually adjusting to their reciprocal growing needs and
development.40,43,44 Breastfeeding and skin-to-skin holding
strengthen such mother-infant communications.37,45–47

However, a mother-infant dyad can also be tainted by ma-
ternal characteristics, stress, and environmental factors, for
example, responsibilities toward other children, occupation,
and marital relationship.13–15,40 If maternal behavioral care
implicates hormonal stimulation, for example, prolactin and
oxytocin, in return, its maintenance necessitates the continued
presence and feedback of the young by mother’s side.33,48–50
Attachment between mother and infant will be ‘‘secure’’ if
mother is responsive, protective, and sensitive to her infant’s
emotional and physical needs, and ‘‘insecure’’ or ‘‘anxious’’ if
mother is unpredictable, distant, and neglectful. Such early
patterns of ‘‘attachment security’’ can have a long-lasting
positive or negative impact on both mother and child.42,49,51–59

Nutritional care. To safeguard lactation, it is necessary to
have a good understanding of both the physiology of lactation
and maternal interest in lactating.2,60 Under normal cir-
cumstances, lactation performance is a function of ‘‘supply
and demand,’’ namely, the greater an infant’s nutritional
need, the greater a mother’s milk production/ejection.

Neville early on differentiated between two stages of lac-
tation, namely Lactogenesis I consisting of the mammary
glandular and ductal development, that is, their cellular and
enzymatic differentiation, followed by Lactogenesis II per-
taining to milk synthesis and ejection.61 It is important to
recognize that milk synthesis is dependent upon the adequate
presence of lactogenic hormones, for example, prolactin,

leptin, opiates, and insulin, while milk ejection from the
breast is primarily dependent upon the release of oxytocin
from the posterior pituitary. As such, milk synthesis and
ejection are regulated by two separate neuroendocrine func-
tions that singly or together can affect the overall lactation
performance of a mother (Stress and lactation section below).
Following the normal gestational period and birth of a term
infant, it is generally expected that proper lactation will occur
as a result of the normal anatomical and physiologic devel-
opment of the mammary function. However, it remains un-
certain whether following a shortened gestation due to a
premature delivery, Lactogenesis I and II have sufﬁciently
advanced to allow for proper milk synthesis and ejection.
Understandably, the functionality of Lactogenesis I has been
difﬁcult to study at the cellular/molecular level. In regard to
Lactogenesis II, results have been inconclusive. As the re-
lease of appropriate lactogenic hormones necessary for milk
synthesis and ejection is a two-step neuroendocrine reﬂex, it
is dependent upon the proper development of neural net-
works originating from the mammary sensory receptors to the
CNS. Again, following a premature delivery and depending
on the shortened gestation period involved, it is uncertain
the extent to which such development has occurred.2,62,63

Indeed, if this reﬂex has not ‘‘fully’’ developed, one may
speculate that maternal neurosensory and/or neuroendocrine
responsiveness to breastfeeding would be hindered resulting
in a decrease in milk synthesis and/or ejection. Peripheral
factors such as mother’s nipple shape and degree of elasticity
and protractility may impede breastfeeding as they can play
a determining role in the infant’s ability to latch onto the
nipple-areola complex.2 As lactation is a function of supply
and demand, any decrease in infant’s demand, whether due to
infant’s inability to latch on, immature nutritive sucking
skills, poor endurance, and/or disinterest in breastfeeding
would lead to decreased milk availability.

Infant growth/development

Non-nutritional growth/development. The non-nutritional
beneﬁts offered by breastfeeding to the preterm dyad relate to
the impact that the frequent and close physical contact be-
tween mother and infant has in stimulating infant growth/
development. This is substantiated by a number of studies in
animals and humans showing the beneﬁts of tactile stimula-
tion.46,64–69 Infant growth/development can be measured
by outcomes such as weight gain and maturation of physio-
logical and neural functions. However, motor movement is
one of the most examined areas of development because it is a
resultant of the maturation of combined anatomical, periph-
eral, and central neurophysiologic and neuromotor functions.
In addition, its ease of observation facilitates the identiﬁca-
tion of objective measures to follow its evolution.

Thelen70 has proposed that motor behavior or movements
are observable ‘‘outputs’’ that emerge in a ‘‘self-organizing
manner,’’ be it appropriate or not, from interactions between
diverse subsystems, for example, physiological, biomechani-
cal, and psychological.71 Under such deﬁnition, infants’ ability
to safely and competently breastfeed may be considered one of
the earliest markers of non-nutritional growth/development.

It is also believed that brain plasticity reorganizes sensori-
motor areas in response to repetitive beneﬁcial or detrimental
practices.72,73 If such ‘‘practice makes perfect’’ approach is

BREASTFEEDING AND PREMATURITY

constructive, preterm infants’ physical isolation that limits
sensory stimulations during their NICU stay would put them at
a disadvantage. From the infants’ standpoint, their direct
physical/sensory contact with mother would be crucial for
their growth/development.74 Therefore, the multisensory ex-
changes between mother and infant play an essential part in the
safeguard of a close-knit relationship, proper development of
maternal behavioral care, and infant growth/development.

Nutritional growth/development. Preterm infants’ inabil-
ity to transition readily from tube to independent breast-
feeding or bottle feeding is an example of the motor
developmental model discussed above. Unlike term infants,
preterm infants have less endurance and may not have yet
acquired the mature nutritive sucking skills that allow them to
feed by mouth efﬁciently and safely.75,76 This is due to their
immature nutritive sucking skills and their inability to coor-
function.76–79
dinate suck-swallow-respiration-esophageal
Indeed, with nutritive sucking occurring at 1 suck/sec,80 ac-
cumulation of milk in the oral cavity due to any delay in bolus
formation and/or transport down to the stomach through the
pharynx and esophagus would increase risks of adverse
events, for example, choking, regurgitation, oxygen desa-
turation, and penetration/aspiration into the lungs.

Caregivers do not have a means to assess the maturity level
of their infants’ nutritive skills and often have taken to ac-
celerating the advancement of daily oral feedings without
necessarily evaluating its appropriateness for their individual
patients. This, not only puts infants at risk of adverse events
but also raises the risk of long-term oral feeding aversion.2,81
Therefore, one may speculate that oral feeding experience
will be successful and safe, if sucking, swallowing, respira-
tion, esophageal activity, their coordinated activities, infant
behavioral states, and feeding positions are appropriate.82–84

Preterm mother-infant dyad interplay

Figure 2 shows how the four elements presented in this
conceptual model are so intricately linked that alterations in
any one of them can readily lead to an unsafe disequilibrium

between mother and infant. Such imbalance, if remained
undetected, can lead to a multilevel downward spiral, not
only threatening breastfeeding success but also the integrity
of the whole dyad. This scenario does not pertain only to
mother-preterm infants, but any high-risk infant with chronic
conditions, for example, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and
cardiac or congenital anomalies.

The proposed four elements highlight four interactive
pathways between and within mother and infant components
that can challenge the breastfeeding performance of the dyad.
It was mentioned earlier that the quality of these interplays are
dependent upon the reciprocal feedbacks between mother and
child as they can be positive/beneﬁcial or negative/detrimental
depending upon the partners’ respective circumstances.

Pathway I relates to the interaction between maternal be-
havior and lactation. Indeed, the greater a mother’s drive to
breastfeed, the more likely her milk availability will in-
crease,85 increasing the probability of her infant being exclu-
sively breastfed or receiving only mother’s milk. In reverse, poor
lactation may negatively feedback to mother, potentially leading
to a decreased drive in breastfeeding and/or interest in expres-
sing milk,30 simultaneously increasing maternal stress. Pathway
II shows the interactions between maternal behavior and in-
fant non-nutritional growth/development that importantly relate
to nurturing and bonding. If maternal behavior is inadequate,
nurturing and caring/holding one’s infant close would decrease
affecting infant’s growth/development. In return, if infant non-
nutritional growth/development was delayed due to a shortened
fetal development or infant postnatal fragility, mother-infant
contact would be reduced along with increased maternal stress,
overall leading to a decrease in maternal-infant interaction.
Pathway III presents the interactions between an infant’s non-
nutritive and nutritive growth/development. With a delayed non-
nutritive growth/development, an infant’s neurophysiologic and
neuromotor maturation would likely impact on his/her oral
feeding skills and ability to breastfeed safely and competently.
In return, such difﬁculty would reduce the nutritional and nur-
turing beneﬁts that breastfeeding offers, further hindering the
infant’s overall growth/development. Pathway IV relates to the
feedback between infant breastfeeding aptitude and lactation.

Safe and competent neonatal oral feeding is a complex
dynamic system that relies on the coordination of multiple phy-
siologic functions, behavioral state dynamics, and social inter-
actions.86 If an infant cannot latch on and remain latched onto the
breast due to immature nutritive sucking skills and/or poor en-
durance, lactation over time will decrease and eventually cease.
This may result from various causes, for example, the ‘‘supply
and demand’’ principle mentioned earlier, as a decreased de-
mand from the part of the infant will reduce milk supply; infant’s
inability to remain on the breast will likely increase maternal
stress, leading to a decrease in milk production and/or maternal
drive to breastfeeding; and with poor lactation, baby in turn will
lose interest in breastfeeding and turn to bottle feeding.

Stress impact on the preterm mother-infant dyad

Figure 2 also illustrates how stress may differentially im-
pact on the four elements of the mother-infant dyad de-
pending on the nature of the stressor. Stress may be generated
separately from within the individual, mother or child, or
both partners of the dyad, or arise from external factors.

Stress and maternal behavioral care. The birth of an in-
fant engenders a certain level of maternal stress. It is not only
due to concern over the well-being and caring of the newborn
but also due to the adjustments mothers need to make in their
own life. A broad range of factors can affect the ease with
which women settle into their new role as mothers, for exam-
ple, maternal characteristics, coping skills, depression, anxiety,
personal health, socioeconomic status, family/social support,
life style, and/or work.13,14,17,60,87–90 All these factors poten-
tially may hamper women’s transition to motherhood. As such,
it is understandable that maternal stress may worsen with the
birth of a premature high-risk infant. It is now well recognized
that mothers’ inability to act as a parent in the stark and high-
pressured environment of an NICU is a deﬁnite stressor.16,17,91
Animal studies have reported that a 4-hour separation
between a dam and her pups increases the anxiety-generated
c-fos activity in speciﬁc brain regions of postpartum rats.92 In
an earlier study, we observed that dams’ corticosterone stress
response to various stressors is dampened when compared to
virgin rats, but is signiﬁcantly heightened when the stressor
threatens their young.93 A number of studies conducted on
breastfeeding women and animals are supportive of such an
altered effect of stress during lactation, suggesting that in-
volvement of oxytocin, prolactin, brain CRF-binding protein,
and opiates, and activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-
adrenocortical axis are likely implicated.93–98

Over the last two decades, the recognition of oxytocin as a
‘‘social’’ hormone and its importance in the protection of the
mother-infant dyad does not relate only to its lactogenic
properties, but just as importantly to its social/behavioral
impact on motherhood.31,51,54,99–106 The intimate relation-
ship existing between a mother-infant dyad106 is exempliﬁed
by a number of studies demonstrating that maternal well-
being or lack thereof is echoed in her child. Maternal increase
in circulating cortisol levels during stress has been associated
with corresponding changes in their infant.106 During times
of ‘‘balanced’’ interplays, heart rhythms are coordinated
between mother and infant.107

Studies have reported 34% to 40% of mothers of very low
birth weight infants were signiﬁcantly depressed compared to

8–15% of mothers of healthy term infant.17,106,108–110 On the
other hand, a meta-analysis study found that ‘‘parents of
preterm-born children experience only slightly more stress
than parents of term-born children, with small effect sizes’’.111
This may be explained by the resilience of mothers whose
infants are in an NICU as they ﬁnd themselves in a situation
that they cannot control.112 However, in an earlier study fo-
cused on mothers of infants born between 26 and 29 weeks
gestation, we noted that mother’s responses to self-reported
questionnaires pertaining to depression and parental stress in
the NICU were signiﬁcantly correlated to the individual sub-
jects’ social desirability trait. Social desirability bias is one’s
tendency to overreport or underreport good or bad behaviors to
be regarded more favorably by others.17 Thus, interpretation of
self-reported data needs to be more closely scrutinized to en-
sure the truthfulness of subjects’ responses.

Maternal depression has been linked to decreased quality
of mother-infant interaction and attachment, more speciﬁ-
cally, decreased positive affective involvement and com-
munication as well as breastfeeding performance.17,113,114
More severe and longer lasting psychological conditions such
as posttraumatic stress situation have been reported in
mothers of preterm infants.115–118 With a high-risk infant,
this dyadic interaction may be further affected by maternal
feelings of disappointment, guilt, insecurity, and choice not
‘‘to engage actively in mothering’’ for fear that one’s infant
may die.16,119–121 Therefore, the ability of a mother to com-
pensate for her infant’s difﬁculties through her behavior and
traits, for example, resilience, ability to cope, and sensitivity
to her infant’s cues, is a strong determinant of their dyadic
outcome.122–124 In a study conducted on physiotherapists’
perceptions about the major obstacles to successful breast-
feeding, three categories were identiﬁed: maternal obstacles,
health professionals, and society. Maternal obstacles com-
prised lack of motivation, insufﬁcient knowledge, anxiety, and
work. Health professionals’ obstacles included lack of sup-
port, inappropriate lactation management, lack of knowledge/
conﬂicting advice, negative attitudes, and staff shortages.
Societal obstacles consisted primarily of lack of social sup-
port and lifestyles. However, for these mothers, the most
important methods of motivation to maintain breastfeeding
pertained to increased information/education and contact
with other breastfeeders,87 an observation also supported by
other studies.125–127

Stress and lactation. Based on human and animal stud-
ies, the suppressive effect of stress on lactation is generally
well recognized. However, the research literature does not
support such a consistent outcome. This is likely due to the
wide variations in study designs, methodologies, as well as
subjects’ characteristics/traits, particularly as it relates to
clinical studies.93,128,129 Nevertheless, such apparent incon-
sistencies only emphasize the importance of not ‘‘rushing’’
into generalizing that a particular stressor may be beneﬁcial,
detrimental, or have no effect insofar as maternal responses
may also be inﬂuenced at the same time by the presence of
additional environmental and physiologic factors, or their
infant feedback to breastfeeding.

From animal research, we have a good physiologic un-
derstanding of how and why stress can inhibit lactation at the
level of the CNS and peripherally on milk synthesis and
ejection. Breastfeeding stimulates the release of the lactogenic

BREASTFEEDING AND PREMATURITY

13

hormones in the CNS, for example, prolactin from the anterior
pituitary for milk synthesis and oxytocin from the posterior
pituitary for milk ejection. There is anatomical evidence of
interconnections between the neuroendocrine hypothala-
mus and the central autonomic system that can directly alter
lactogenic hormones at the hypothalamic level or indirectly
through catecholaminergic and peptidergic neural net-
works.130–133 Peripheral inhibition of milk synthesis and
ejection may occur as stimulation of the central and/or peri-
pheral autonomic systems can lead to vasoconstriction re-
sulting in decreased hormonal delivery to the mammary
alveoli and myoepithelium, respectively.60,134–136 The time
delay between lactogenic hormone release and the resulting
milk synthesized in the mammary alveoli would appear pro-
longed hours.137 This contrasts with the release of milk stored
in the mammary alveoli that occurs immediately in response to
oxytocin. As such, depending upon the duration of a stressor,
acute or prolonged, suppression of lactation may result from a
decrease in milk synthesis and/or ejection. Consequently,
when mother’s milk availability decreases under stress, it be-
comes difﬁcult to determine whether it is a result of a decrease
in milk synthesis and/or milk release.

Stress and infant growth/development. Being born pre-
maturely is a major stressor that infants encounter. Never-
theless, with immature neurophysiologic functions and
underdeveloped organs, they must adapt to their ex-utero
environment to survive. Consequently, during their time in
the NICU, infants are faced with a variety of stressors that
they have no control over. As safe oral feeding is one of the
last milestones they need to attain before hospital discharge,
some of these infants may not have reached the develop-
mental stage that allows them to readily feed by mouth.
Under such circumstances, breastfeeding and bottle feeding
can become an additional daily struggle that we know can
lead to unsafe and inefﬁcient feeding along with long-term
feeding aversion.2 Although safe and competent oral feeding
require mature skills, it is important to remember that oral
feeding difﬁculties can also be of nonoral origins, for ex-
ample, infant’s clinical status at feeding time and during the
feeding (e.g., cardiorespiratory status and fatigue), the NICU
environment (e.g., light and noise level), infant’s own be-
havioral states (e.g., sleepy, quiet alert, or crying), and/or
organization (e.g., calm or agitated).138–140

The NICU Setting

The caring of preterm infants, due to their fragility, rests
initially and understandably in the hands of the neonatal
medical team in NICUs. Such setting drastically restricts op-
portunities for mother-infant direct contact. In addition, after
overcoming the immediate life-threatening and damaging
consequences of chronic conditions such as intraventricular
hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis, these infants’ hos-
pital discharge is often delayed by their inability to feed by
mouth as attainment of independent oral feeding is one of the
criteria recommended by the AAP for hospital discharge.141
Consequently, the longer the transition from tube to indepen-
dent oral feeding, the longer the hospitalization will be.142,143
introduction and progression of oral
feeding, be it breast or bottle, involve the input of the mul-
tidisciplinary medical team caring for the infant that includes,

Within a NICU,

not only neonatologists, neonatal nurse practitioners, and
neonatal nurses but often feeding specialists, for example,
occupational therapists, speech pathologists, neonatal nutri-
tionists, and lactation consultants when breastfeeding is
concerned. Under such circumstances, mother and baby re-
ceive recommendations from all members of the team. If
these messages are not consistent, confusion will likely arise
with mothers uncertain about which feeding recommendation
is best and infant needing to ‘‘adapt’’ to everyone’s differing
feeding approaches. This is a good example of an ‘‘uncon-
trollable’’ external factor mentioned earlier. Therefore, having
one feeding plan agreed upon by all team members would be
critical from the time a mother and her infant are introduced to
oral feeding. Indeed, proper communication, relationship, and
performance are important factors that will allow all players to
work together effectively and successfully, just as it should be
within a mother-infant dyad. At this time, this is unfortunately
not common practice, but awareness that multidisciplinary
interventions can be beneﬁcial in the care of pediatric feeding
disorders is growing.144

Conclusion

Due to the intimate interactive exchanges existing between
a mother and her infant(s) and the knowledge that stress may
impact mother and infant differentially and at the same time,
it is clear that studying mother and infant independently from
one another, as customarily done, is not productive. Studies
relating to maternal stress following a premature delivery
primarily focus on mothers or infants separately without
considering how importantly one partner can affect the other.
Thus, to begin deciphering the mother-preterm infant ‘‘breast-
feeding puzzle’’, it would be more relevant to consider the
mother-infant pair as one entity rather than two separate en-
tities, that is, mother and infant.

The four elements deﬁned in this model could be readily
monitored. For instance, maternal behavioral care may be
evaluated by the frequency of maternal NICU visits and skin-
to-skin holding; lactation by the frequency of breastfeeding
events and milk volume collected during milk expression;
infants’ non-nutritional growth/development by their overall
medical status; and infants’nutritional growth/development
by their daily weight gain and oral feeding performance.

As such, there is a unique opportunity to determine within
a dyad at risk, the elements within each partner that may
beneﬁt from support. In addition, in evaluating the reciprocal
effects of mother-infant interplays, this approach would en-
sure that any clinical management plan developed to assist
one partner will, at the least, not be detrimental to the other.
As such, our working model may be envisaged as a potential
‘‘diagnostic’’ tool. In summary, this working concept would
not only facilitate the selection of relevant interventions that
could be offered but also importantly determine whether any
ensuing beneﬁts to one partner have relevance for the other.
