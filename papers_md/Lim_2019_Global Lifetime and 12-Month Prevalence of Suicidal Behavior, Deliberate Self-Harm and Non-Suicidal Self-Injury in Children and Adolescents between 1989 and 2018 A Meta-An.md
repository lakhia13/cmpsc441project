Abstract: Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the global lifetime and 12-month prevalence
of suicidal behavior, deliberate self-harm and non-suicidal self-injury in children and adolescents.
Methods: A systematic search for relevant articles published between 1989 to 2018 was performed in
multiple electronic databases. The aggregate 12-month and lifetime prevalence of suicidal behavior,
deliberate self-harm, and non-suicidal self-injury were calculated based on the random-eﬀects model.
Subgroup analyses were performed to compare the prevalence according to school attendance
and geographical regions. Results: A total of 686,672 children and adolescents were included.
The aggregate lifetime and 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts was 6% (95% CI: 4.7–7.7%) and
4.5% (95% CI: 3.4–5.9%) respectively. The aggregate lifetime and 12-month prevalence of suicidal
plan was 9.9% (95% CI: 5.5–17%) and 7.5% (95% CI: 4.5–12.1%) respectively. The aggregate lifetime
and 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation was 18% (95% CI: 14.2–22.7%) and 14.2% (95% CI:
11.6–17.3%) respectively. The aggregate lifetime and 12-month prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury
was 22.1% (95% CI: 16.9–28.4%) and 19.5% (95% CI: 13.3–27.6%) respectively. The aggregate lifetime
and 12-month prevalence of deliberate self-harm was 13.7% (95% CI: 11.0–17.0%) and 14.2% (95% CI:
10.1–19.5%) respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that full-time school attendance, non-Western
countries, low and middle-income countries, and geographical locations might contribute to the
higher aggregate prevalence of suicidal behaviors, deliberate self-harm, and non-suicidal self-injury.

1. Introduction

During the past 30 years, suicide has become a severe cause of mortality across all ages in the
world. In 2015, the number of suicide deaths worldwide was estimated to be 788,000 [1], with a
global average of 10.7 per 100,000. Suicide was ranked second as a cause of mortality amongst
those aged 15–29 years old globally [2], making it a global public health concern. Suicidal behavior,
deliberate self-harm and non-suicidal self-injury are important antecedents of suicide in children
and adolescents [2]. Suicidal behaviors involve suicidal ideation, planning for suicide and suicide
attempts [3]. Self-harm behavior is deﬁned here as an act of intentionally causing harm to own self,
irrespective of the type, motive or suicidal intent [2]. Non-suicidal self-injury is deﬁned as deliberate
direct destruction or alteration of body tissue without conscious suicidal intent [4]. Deliberate self-harm
is an encompassing term for self-injurious behavior, both with and without suicidal intent that has a
non-fatal outcome [5]. Non-suicidal self-injury and deliberate self-harm are common in young people
who will have borderline personality traits or disorder [6]. Non-suicidal self-injury and deliberate
self-harm have been known to predict future suicide attempts [7].

There are potential factors that aﬀect the global prevalence of suicidal and self-harm behavior in
children and adolescents. From cross-cultural perspectives, there are ethnic diﬀerences in risk factors
of suicide attempts [8,9]. In Western countries like Canada, suicide accounts for 10% of deaths in
children aged 10 to 14 years and for 23% of deaths in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years [10]. In New
Zealand, children and adolescents from the lowest socio-economic status were found to be 31 times
more likely to attempt suicide compared to individuals in the higher socio-economic status [11].
In Asia, relationship issues, academic and environmental stressors are common precipitants for suicide
attempts among young people [12]. In Singapore, a peak in suicide attempts has been observed in
adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24 years old [12]. Cross-cultural studies found that self-harm
behaviors amongst eighth-graders in Hong Kong (23.5%) were less frequent compared to those in the
United States (32%) [13]. The lower self-harm rate in Hong Kong adolescents was attributed to cultural
diﬀerences between the Eastern and Western cultures, with a stronger emphasis on family structures
and rules in Asian culture [13]. A meta-analysis is required to study cross-cultural perspectives of
suicidal behavior, deliberate self-harm, and non-suicidal self-injury among young people in diﬀerent
countries in a systematic manner.

From a gender perspective, Lewinsohn et al. found female adolescents to have a signiﬁcantly
higher risk of suicide attempts compared to male counterparts, with the diﬀerences between genders
diminishing as participants increased with age [14]. Furthermore, gender was found to predict lethality
in suicide attempts as more males than females made attempts with high perceived lethality and
medical lethality [15]. Youth who experienced diﬃculty in school were at risk for suicide [16]. However,
there is little published information speciﬁc to the relationship between school attendance, suicidal
behaviors, deliberate self-harm, and non-suicidal self-injury in children and adolescents.

Despite the seriousness and scope of the problem, little is known about the global prevalence of
suicidal and self-harm behaviors in children and adolescents in the past 30 years. Further research is
required to compare the prevalence of suicidal, and self-harm behavior among children and adolescents
from diﬀerent geographical regions as contextual diﬀerences (e.g., exposure to adversity) across
countries may aﬀect prevalence estimates. Given the above ﬁndings and observations, we aimed to
conduct a meta-analyze to estimate the global 12-month and lifetime prevalence of adolescents having

a history of suicide attempts, suicide plans, suicidal ideation, non-suicidal self-injury, and deliberate
self-harm between 1989 to 2018.

2. Methods

2.1. Search Strategy

During the past thirty years, the advent of computer technology, the Internet, and the widespread
use of social media have aﬀected suicidal behaviors, deliberate self-harm and non-suicidal self-injury in
young people. Many young people report that computers and the Internet facilitate their communication
with peers [17]. The eﬀect of social media on suicidal behaviors, deliberate self-harm and non-suicidal
self-injury is still under evaluation. Some studies suggested that social media use has led to the growth
of suicide clusters [18], while others showed that it had a positive impact on the prevention of suicide
given the myriad of support platforms for the children and adolescents at risk [19]. Given the above
ﬁndings and observations, this meta-analysis focused from 1989 to 2018.

This study was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic search was performed with dates covered from 1
January 1989 to 31 December 2018, using a combination of search terms (* indicates truncation): ‘suicid
*/suicide attempt *’, ‘self harm’ or ’self-harm’,’self injury’ or ’self-injury’, ‘adolescent’, ’youth’, ’young’,
’child *’,’teen *’,’student *’,’school *’ and ‘prevalence’. Electronic databases such as PubMed, Web
of Science, PsycINFO, and Embase were utilized. The reference lists of reviews, reports, and other
relevant articles were also examined to identify additional studies.

2.2. Eligibility Criteria

Two authors (K.-S.L. and R.C.H.) independently identiﬁed the eligibility of studies. The studies
included in this review must fulﬁl the following inclusion criteria: (1) the study provided cross-sectional
data on the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of suicidal behavior, deliberate self-harm or non-suicidal
self-injury; (2) the study population was children or adolescents and (3) a clear deﬁnition of suicidal
behavior, deliberate self-harm or non-suicidal self-injury were reported. Any study that did not meet
the aforementioned inclusion criteria were excluded. Any discrepancies between the two authors were
reviewed by another author (C.S.H.) and resolved with consensus.

2.3. Data Extraction

Two authors (K.-S.L. and R.C.H.) independently extracted the following data from each eligible
study: ﬁrst author, year of publication, the country where the study was conducted, number of
participants with suicidal behavior, deliberate self-harm or non-suicidal self-injury, total sample size,
mean age of participants, proportion of female gender and school attendance. Any disagreements
between the two authors were resolved via discussion with a third author (C.S.H.). The three authors
involved in this process were trained in medicine and psychiatry.

2.4. Study Outcomes

A suicide attempt is deﬁned as an act in which an adolescent tries to end his or her life but
survives [20]. A suicide plan is a proposed plan of carrying out a suicidal act that may lead to potential
death [21]. Suicidal ideation is deﬁned as any self-reported thoughts of engaging in suicide-related
behavior [22]. Non-suicidal self-injury is deﬁned as the deliberate, self-inﬂicted destruction of body
tissue without suicidal intent and for purposes not socially sanctioned, such as cutting, burning, and
biting [23]. Deliberate self-harm is deﬁned as self-injurious behaviors with and without suicidal intent
and that have non-fatal outcomes. The 12-month and lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts, suicide
plans, suicide ideation, non-suicidal self-injury, and deliberate self-harm were extracted from each
study, which met inclusion criteria.

2.5. Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were conducted in Comprehensive Meta-analysis statistical software
version 3.0 (BioStat Solutions, Inc, Frederick, MD, USA). The aggregate prevalence was calculated
based on the random-eﬀects model. The random-eﬀects model was used as it assumes varying eﬀect
sizes between studies, because of diﬀering study design and study population [24,25]. A forest plot was
then constructed and reported the aggregate prevalence, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) and p-value based
on the method adopted by previous meta-analysis on prevalence [26,27]. The statistical signiﬁcance
level was set at p < 0.05. The I2 statistic was used to assess the between-study heterogeneity [28], which
describes the percentage of variance on the basis of real diﬀerences in study eﬀects. I2 value of 25%
was considered low, 50% moderate and 75% substantial [29].

Publication bias was assessed with the utilization of Egger’s regression [25]. A p-values of 0.05 or
less was used as the cut oﬀ for the presence of statistically signiﬁcant publication bias [30]. The presence
of publication bias was then further investigated using both the standard and Orwin’s fail-safe N
tests to provide an estimated number of additional studies required to make the eventual eﬀect size
insigniﬁcant [31]. Meta-regression analyses with a mixed-eﬀect model were performed to identify
the eﬀects of potential moderators on the overall heterogeneity. Potential moderators include mean
age of sample and proportion of female gender. Subgroup analyses were performed to compare the
aggregate prevalence of each study outcome with regards to school attendance and study location.
The deﬁnitions of developing and developed countries were based on Standard Country or Area Codes
for Statistical Use developed by the United Nations [32].

3. Results

3.1. Selection Results and Study Characteristics

A total of 668 potentially relevant citations were gathered after an extensive literature search was
performed on the databases listed in Figure 1. A total of 106 studies were found to be duplicated. Of the
remaining 562 studies for which titles and abstracts were screened, 400 were excluded. The ﬁnal 162
studies were then reviewed in full, of which 96 were excluded, leaving 66 studies that met the inclusion
criteria to be used in this meta-analysis. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses—chart depicting the detailed process of paper selection can be seen in Figure 1. The 66
studies included in the meta-analysis yields a total population of 686,672 study participants. Table 1
shows the characteristics of the included studies.

3.2. Aggregate Prevalence of Suicide Attempts in Children and Adolescents

The aggregate lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was found to be 6.0% (95% Conﬁdence
Interval (CI): 4.7–7.7%). The forest plot is shown in Figure 2. There was a signiﬁcantly high level of
heterogeneity across the included studies (I2 = 98.60, p <0.001). There was no evidence of publication
bias (intercept = 0.16, 95% CI: −5.87–6.2, t = 0.06, df = 27, p = 0.96).

Figure 2. Forest plot of the aggregate lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts.

The aggregate 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts was found to be 4.5% (95% CI: 3.4–5.9%).
The result is demonstrated using the forest plot as shown in Figure 3. There was a signiﬁcant high
level of heterogeneity across the included studies (I2 = 99.64, p < 0.001). There was no evidence of
publication bias (intercept = 0.39, 95% CI: −11.71–12.49, t = 0.07, df = 21, p = 0.95).

3.3. Aggregate Prevalence of Suicide Plans in Children and Adolescents

The aggregate lifetime prevalence of suicide plans was found to be 9.9% (95% CI: 5.5–17.0%).
The result is demonstrated using the forest plot, as shown in Figure 4. There was a signiﬁcantly high
level of heterogeneity across the included studies (I2 = 99.35, p < 0.001). The aggregate 12-month
prevalence of suicide plans was found to be 7.5% (95% CI: 4.5–12.1%). There was a signiﬁcantly high
level of heterogeneity across the included studies (I2 = 99.82, p < 0.001). The result is demonstrated
using the forest plot, as shown in Figure 4. There was no evidence of publication bias (intercept = 15.24,

3.7. Subgroup Analyses Based on School Attendance

A higher aggregate lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts is found amongst young people who
attended school full-time as compared to young people from the mixed group of education consisting
partial and non-school attendees (6.7% (95% CI: 5.3–8.4%) vs. 4.3% (95% CI: 2.7–6.7%)). The aggregate
prevalence of suicide attempts in the past 12 months for full-time school attendees (5.6%, 95% CI:
4.2–7.3%) was found to be higher than partial and non-school attendees (2.1%, 95% CI: 1.3–3.6%).

The aggregate lifetime prevalence of suicide plans was found to be 12.4% (95% CI: 8.5–17.8%)
in young people who attended school as compared to 5.1% (95% CI: 2.6–9.9%) from partial and
non-school attendees. Similarly, the aggregate 12-month prevalence of suicide plans was also higher in
the school-attending group (10.3%, 95% CI: 7.6–13.7%) as compared to partial and non-school attending
group (3.1%, 95% CI: 1.8–5.2%).

The aggregate lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation
were found to be higher in the school-attending group as compared to the partial and non-school
attending group (19.5%, 95% CI: 15.0–25.0% vs. 13.9%, 95% CI: 8.5–22.1%) and (14.6%, 95% CI:
11.8–18.0% vs. 12.4%, 95% CI: 7.7–19.5%) respectively.

Both the lifetime and 12-month aggregate prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury were higher
in the school-attending group as compared to the partial and non-school attending group (22.8%,
95% CI: 17.1–29.8% vs. 19.0%, 95% CI: 9.7–33.7%), and (21.5%, 95% CI: 15.0–30.0% vs. 8.0%, 95% CI:
2.4–23.3%) respectively.

There was a higher aggregate lifetime and 12-month prevalence of deliberate self-harm in the
school-attending group (15.3%, 95% CI: 11.7–19.9%) compared to the partial and non-school attending
group (10.4%, 95% CI: 6.6–15.9%).

The aggregate lifetime prevalence of suicide plans was higher in non-Western (12.9%, 95% CI:
6.7–23.3%) than Western countries (7.6%, 95% CI: 3.9–14.3%). Similarly, the aggregate past 12-month
prevalence of suicide plans was higher in non-Western (10.3%, 95% CI: 7.6–13.7%) than Western
countries (3.1%, 95% CI: 1.8–5.2%).

The aggregate lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation was higher in non-Western (18.7%, 95% CI:
12.5–26.9%) than Western countries (17.6%, 95% CI: 12.7–23.8%). The aggregate 12-month prevalence
of SI was higher in non-Western (15.2%, 95% CI: 12.6–18.1%) than Western countries (13.0%, 95% CI:
10.5–16.1%).

The aggregate lifetime prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury was higher in non-Western countries
(32.6%, 95% CI: 20.0–48.5%) than Western countries (19.4%, 95% CI: 14.2–25.8%). The aggregate
12-month prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury was similar between in non-Western (19.1%, 95% CI:
9.3–35.3%) and the Western countries (19.7%, 95% CI: 10.4–34.2%).

The aggregate lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-harm was higher in Western countries (14.2%,
95% CI: 10.7–18.6%) than non-Western countries (12.8%, 95% CI: 8.5–18.7%). The aggregate 12-month
prevalence of deliberate self-harm was higher in non-Western countries (25.2%, 95% CI: 16.8–36.0%).
than Western countries (8.5%, 95% CI: 5.5–12.8%).

3.9. Subgroup Analyses Based on Developing and Developed Countries

The lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts in developed (6.1% 95% CI: 4.3–8.5%) and low and
middle-income countries (6.0% 95% CI: 4.1–7.7%) were similar. However, the past 12-month prevalence
of suicide attempts was higher in low and middle-income countries (6.9% 95% CI: 4.8–9.6%) than
developed countries (2.8% 95% CI: 1.9–4.0%).

The lifetime prevalence of suicide plans was higher in developing (12.9% 95% CI: 6.7–23.3%) than
developed countries (7.6% 95% CI: 3.9–14.3%). Similarly, the 12-month prevalence of suicide plans was
higher in low and middle-income countries (10.3% 95% CI: 7.6–13.7%) than developed countries (3.1%
95% CI: 1.8–5.2%).

The lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation was higher in developing (17.7% 95% CI: 11.1–27.0%)
than developed countries (17.3% 95% CI: 12.0–24.4%). The 12-month prevalence of suicide ideation
was higher in low and middle-income countries (15.9% 95% CI: 13.5–18.6%) than developed countries

3.11. Meta-Regression Analyses

For suicide attempts, mean age (B = 0.0812, z = 2.12, p = 0.034) was identiﬁed as signiﬁcant
moderator that contributed to heterogeneity between studies. For suicidal plan, mean age (B = 0.20,
z = 5.63, p < 0.001) was identiﬁed as signiﬁcant moderator that contributed to heterogeneity between
studies. For SI, mean age (B = −0.0087, z = −0.28, p = 0.78) was a non-signiﬁcant moderator.
For non-suicidal self-injury, mean age (B = 0.11, z = 1.77, p = 0.08). was a non-signiﬁcant moderator.
Fordeliberate self-harm, mean age (B = 0.01, z = 0.33, p = 0.74) was a non-signiﬁcant moderator.

For suicide attempts, the proportion of females (B = 1.86, z = 1.05, p = 0.29) was a non-signiﬁcant
moderator. For suicidal plan, the proportion of females (B = −0.36, z = −0.14, p = 0.89) was a
non-signiﬁcant moderator. For suicidal ideation, the proportion of females (B = 0.77, z = 0.63 p = 0.53)
was a non-signiﬁcant moderator. For non-suicidal self-injury, the proportion of females (B = −0.29,
z = −0.25, p = 0.81) was a non-signiﬁcant moderator. For deliberate self-harm, the proportion of females
(B = −1.79, z = −0.85, p = 0.4) was a non-signiﬁcant moderator.

4. Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst meta-analysis that analyzed suicidal and self-harm
phenomena based on 686,672 young people worldwide. The key ﬁndings are summarized as follows.
non-suicidal self-injury was most frequent with aggregate lifetime and 12-month prevalence of 22.1%
and 19.5% respectively. Suicidal ideation was second most frequent with aggregate lifetime and
12-month prevalence of 18% and 14.2% respectively. Deliberate self-harm was third most frequent with
aggregate lifetime and 12-montnh prevalence of 13.7% and 14.2% respectively. Suicidal plan ranked
fourth with aggregate lifetime and 12-month prevalence 9.9% and 7.5% respectively. Suicide attempt
was least frequent with aggregate lifetime and 12-month prevalence of 6.0% and 4.5% respectively.

This meta-analysis found that the aggregate lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was higher in
Western (6.5%, 95% CI: 4.7–9.0%) than non-Western countries. There are several reasons to explain
higher prevalence of suicide attempts among young people in western countries. First, substance
abuse appeared to have aﬀected suicide rates of young males in Western countries [129]. Second,
high suicide rates among young indigenous people in Western countries have been attributed to
internalised anger and despair related to social disruption and disempowerment [130]. Third, young
people in Western countries could have more access to suicide means, including ﬁrearms. In contrast,
the aggregate lifetime prevalence of suicide plans, suicide ideation and non-suicidal self-injury were
higher in non-Western countries than Western countries. This ﬁnding suggests that young people
in non-Western countries could have thought about suicide but did not attempt suicide. Attempted
suicide is illegal in some of the non-Western countries including Bangladesh, Hungary, India and
Japan, though in Japan it is not punishable [129]. The legal implication could deter suicide attempts in
some of the non-Western countries.

This meta-analysis found that non-suicidal self-injury had the highest aggregate lifetime and
12-month prevalence worldwide. Non-suicidal self-injury is deﬁned as the intentional destruction of
one’s own body tissue without suicidal intent [27]. Examples of non-suicidal self-injury, including
self-laceration, skin scratching, burning and hitting. Klonsky et al. proposed functional theories that
explain the reasons for non-suicidal self-injury in young people [131]. The reasons include alleviation
of negative emotion, self-punishment, self-directed anger, and expression of distress. Klonsky et
al. highlighted the misconception that non-suicidal self-injury is always a symptom of borderline
personality disorder [132]. For young people with engaging non-suicidal self-injury, a psychological
intervention which aims at building positive emotion, reducing self-directed anger and promoting
more adaptive way to express distress may reduce the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury.

A recent study found that the 12-month prevalence rates of youth self-harm in low and middle-
income countries were comparable to high-income countries. This meta-analysis with a larger sample
size showed that children and adolescents from low- and middle-income countries with lower income
had a higher aggregate 12-month prevalence of deliberate self-harm than children and adolescents
from developed countries with higher income. Previous research reported that non-suicidal self-injury
appeared to be more common among Caucasians than non-Caucasians [133]. Our meta-analysis found
that the 12-month prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury was highest in Australia which has 74.3% of
the population who are Caucasians [134].

The subgroup analysis yielded several interesting ﬁndings. The aggregate lifetime and 12-month
prevalence of suicidal and self-harm behavior were higher in full-time school attendees as compared
with partial and non-attendees. School attendees are more likely to be exposed to risk factors, including
academic stress and school bullying. Academic stress leads to anger, anxiety, helplessness, shame, and
boredom [135]. A previous study found that skin picking, which causes skin damage was positively
correlated with academic stress and trait anxiety was a predisposing factor [136]. The other risk
factors faced by school attendees are peer victimization, which reﬂects the experience of overt (e.g.,
hitting, pushing), reputational (e.g., spreading rumors), or relational aggression from peers (e.g., being
excluded, gossiped about) [137,138]. Vergara et al. (2019) found that peer victimization was associated
with the frequency of past month non-suicidal self-injury thoughts and past month non-suicidal
self-injury behaviors [139]. The aggregate lifetime and 12-month prevalence of suicidal and self-harm
behavior were higher in developing and non-western countries.

We found that the lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation, the 12-month prevalence of suicide
attempts and suicide ideation were highest in Africa. This could be due to the fact that large numbers of
African children and adolescents were exposed to adverse childhood experiences [140]. Young people in
developing and non-western countries are more likely to be exposed to adverse childhood experiences
including alcohol abuse [141], lack of access to care for mental health problems, orphanage, and
early parental death [142], human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) infection [142] and violence against
children and adolescents [143]. Interventions to reduce African children and adolescent suicidality
include those improving family functioning, reducing poverty, mitigating the impacts of HIV and
the provision of eﬀective mental health services for adversity-exposed children and adolescent [140].
As the infrastructure for mental health service is still developing, the main challenge is to reach out to
children and adolescents in low and middle-income countries and educate them to handle suicidal
and self-harm behaviors. Electronic health (E-health) was found to provide a cost-eﬀective solution
in mental health [144]. As the use of smartphones becomes increasingly prevalent and aﬀordable,
more children and adolescents in low and middle-income countries can own a smartphone device and
download health-related applications [17]. Proof of concept feasibility studies and randomized trials
should be conducted in low and middle-income countries to determine that smartphone applications
are eﬃcacious to reduce suicidal and self-harm behavior in children and adolescents before their actual
implementation [145].

The lifetime and 12-month prevalence of suicide plans and DSH were found to be highest in
Asia. Asian children and adolescents face more academic-related stress due to the competitiveness

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 4581

in the education system, and getting poor grades in the examination have been found to bear two
major signiﬁcant sources of anxiety and depression amongst Asian children and adolescents [146].
Willingness to seek help was found to be a protective factor against suicidal and self-harm behavior for
Asian children and adolescents [15]. Nevertheless, help-seeking from peers may not be beneﬁcial [147].
Children and adolescents may not receive the help that they require, as peers often might be poorly
equipped to provide appropriate advice.

Meta-regression found that age was a critical moderator that explains for heterogeneity for
a lifetime and 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts and suicide plans. Children and young
adolescents were less exposed to suicide risk factors as compared with older adolescents [148]. Older
adolescents are predisposed to speciﬁc risk factors associated with suicidal behaviors, including
baseline interpersonal problems in one’s social circle [149], psychiatric disorders [148], and STD-related
risk [150]. Meta-regression also found that gender was not a vital moderator that explains for
heterogeneity of the prevalence of suicidal and self-harm behavior. This ﬁnding may challenge the
gender paradox, which suggests signiﬁcant epidemiological diﬀerences in suicidal and self-harm
behaviors between adolescent females and males [151]. A previous study found that there were
no gender diﬀerences in family problems and school problems which are well-known risk factors
associated with suicidal and self-harm behavior in young people [152].

The strengths of this meta-analysis include an extensive search in identifying a large number of
articles on suicidal and self-harm behaviour in 686,672 children and adolescents, adherence to the
guidelines, the inclusion of meta-regression and subgroup analysis as well as lack of publication bias [28].
Nevertheless, this meta-analysis has several limitations. First, this meta-analysis classiﬁed suicidal and
self-harm phenomena into ﬁve sub-categories and not able to study their inter-relationship. Klonsky et
al. proposed that non-suicidal self-injury may be an essential risk factor for suicidal behaviour [132].
Future study is required to study the inter-relationship between suicidal behaviour, deliberate self-harm,
and non-suicidal self-injury in young people. Second, we could not classify dliberate self-harm as
suicidal and non-suicidal deliberate self-harm. Future research is required to understand the diﬀerences
between young people who attempt suicidal and non-suicidal deliberate self-harm.

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, this meta-analysis found that the three most common suicidal and self-harm
behaviors were non-suicidal self-injury (aggregate lifetime and 12-month prevalence of 22.1% and
19.5% respectively), suicidal ideation (aggregate lifetime and 12-month prevalence of 18% and 14.2%
respectively) and deliberate self-harm (aggregate lifetime and 12-month prevalence of 13.7% and
14.2% respectively). The aggregate lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was higher in Western than
non-Western countries, in contrast, the aggregate lifetime prevalence of suicide plans, suicide ideation
and non-suicidal self-injury were higher in non-Western countries than Western countries. Suicidal
and self-harm behavior was higher in children and adolescents who were full-time school attendees
and those who live in developing countries. Meta-regression analyses showed that the mean age of
participants was a signiﬁcant moderator that contributed to heterogeneity for a lifetime and 12-month
prevalence of suicide attempts and suicidal plans. Psychological interventions targeting self-harm
and suicidal behavior, social interventions targeting adversities in low- and middle-income countries,
and electronic—health interventions to reach out to children and adolescents may reduce the global
prevalence of suicidal and self-harm behavior in children and adolescents.
