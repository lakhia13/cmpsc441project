Self-regulation (SR) is an important human function that relates to quality of life in multiple
domains including mental health. Previous studies have found important correlates of low
SR including impulsivity and poor emotional regulation; however, underpinnings of low
SR are incompletely understood. Individuals low in SR frequently engage in maladaptive
behaviors (substance abuse, procrastination, etc.) despite negative consequences. This
phenomenon suggests that impaired learning from errors and punishments may be
important mechanisms underlying low SR. Consistently, previous studies observed
impaired error processing in a wide spectrum of individuals with low SR and impaired
learning from errors and punishments in SR-related disorders. We also note a possible
role for poor emotional regulation and refer to concepts suggesting that engaging in
maladaptive behaviors may serve as short term emotion regulation strategies aimed at
avoiding or alleviating negative affect. We speculate on transdiagnostic factors underlying
poor SR. We propose that
impaired error processing (possibly related to striatal
functioning) may prevent subjects with low SR from learning from errors and punishments
and thus learning better SR skills or tendencies. Additionally,
impaired coping in
emotionally challenging situations, possibly related to prefrontal-cortical functioning, may
lead to maladaptive avoidance. Moreover, maladaptive behaviors may be reinforced by
the temporary decreases in negative affect and rewarding values of behaviors. Given
existing knowledge gaps, we call for more extensive research and describe possible
directions and challenges for future studies.

Learning From Punishments and Self-Regulation

INTRODUCTION

Self-regulation (SR) is an important human ability or tendency,
with the former relating more to cognitive functioning and
the latter more to behavioral traits. Levels of SR diﬀer across
individuals and correlate with quality of life in many domains
including mental health (1). Thus, the topic is gaining attention
among researchers in diﬀerent ﬁelds of science. Previous studies
have found multiple correlates of low SR including impulsivity
and poor executive functioning and emotional regulation (2).
Nonetheless, an incomplete understanding of underpinnings
of low SR persists. Here we explore the notion that impaired
learning from errors and punishments may underlie poor SR, and
maladaptive avoidance may result from and perpetuate low SR.

People make many decisions regarding their actions, some of
which are perceived at the time or later to be in error and may
lead to negative consequences. For most people, such negative
consequences serve as punishments and lead to learning and
acting diﬀerently in similar future situations. However, people
with low SR may frequently engage in maladaptive behaviors
(e.g., substance abuse, procrastination, binge eating, gambling,
etc.) despite negative consequences. Such data suggest that these
individuals may have impaired mechanisms of learning from
failures and punishments.

The topic of punishment and avoidance learning has arguably
been receiving more attention recently (3, 4). While some human
studies have focused on avoidance in relation to anxiety disorders
(5) and relatively few experimental papers have investigated
learning from punishments and/or avoidance learning in relation
to broadly understood SR, some data suggest
that subject
groups low in SR may learn less from errors and punishment
(6). These studies complement a more extensive behavioral
and neuroimaging research in SR, impulsivity, substance use
disorders and behavioral addictions (2, 7–12).

In the following sections, we ﬁrst review studies suggesting
error-processing may be impaired in a range of individuals
with low SR. Next, we summarize data relating impaired error-
processing to less eﬀective learning from punishments. We
then describe studies demonstrating impaired learning from
errors and punishment in SR-related disorders and behaviors
(in addictive disorders and procrastination). We also consider
a role for poor emotional regulation and suggest that short-
term avoidance of negative emotions may be a mechanism
motivating people to engage in the maladaptive behaviors that
may result in long-term negative consequences. Based on striatal
and prefrontal systems, we propose a transdiagnostic model
connecting impaired coping and learning from errors and
punishments with tendencies to engage in maladaptive behaviors.
Finally, we describe the need for more extensive research and
suggest some possible future directions.

What Is Self-Regulation?
Following (2), we consider SR in a broad sense as, “the
intrinsic processes aimed at adjusting mental and physiological
state adaptively to context.” SR “encompasses cognitive control,
emotion regulation, and top-down and bottom-up processes
to
that alter emotion, behavior, or cognition to attempt

strategic/deliberative as well as
enhance adaptation (. . . )
reactive/automatized processes and their reciprocal inﬂuences.”
This broad deﬁnition encompasses also self-control deﬁned
as “top-down aspects of SR” (2). From a clinical perspective,
individuals with low SR often engage in maladaptive behaviors
like substance abuse, problematic gambling, procrastination,
excessive gaming, binge eating and other behaviors, and they will
be a focus of the present considerations.

While punishment, negative motivation and negative aﬀect
may have diﬀerent underpinnings and associations, they may also
share features relevant to SR. As such, we will consider these
processes generally, while noting some unique psychological and
neurobiological underpinnings.

ERROR PROCESSING

Error processing is often measured using speciﬁc tasks (e.g.,
Go/No-go, stop-signal or ﬂanker) and assessment of error-
related brain activity often employs EEG or fMRI approaches.
Commission of an error results in activation of a network of
brain regions including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC);
see (13) for a meta-analysis. Multiple studies of substance
additions (involving cannabis, opioid, cocaine, or tobacco use)
and behavioral addictions (involving gambling or gaming)
suggest diminished error-related ACC activity measured with
fMRI or as lower amplitude of error-related negativity (ERN) in
EEG studies; see (14) for a meta-analysis. Interestingly, however,
in people with alcohol dependence, increased ERN was found,
possibly in relation to higher anxiety (15). Diminished error-
related brain activity has also been found in people with criminal
recidivism (16), procrastination (17, 18), and high impulsivity
(19). These results suggest impaired error processing may link
transdiagnostically to multiple groups with low SR.

Measurement of startle reactions after errors and correct trials
suggests that errors are aversive (20). Amplitude of the ERN
component related to degree of startle, consistent with a recent
study in which assessments of error sensitivity (i.e., the fear of
making mistakes) was correlated with ERN measures in children
(21). These results suggest that errors may be less salient and
arousing in individuals with lower ERNs. A study of impulsivity
employing a ﬂanker task with separated reward and punishment
conditions found impulsive subjects to exhibit particularly low
ERN components in punishment trials (22). Together these
results suggest monitoring diﬃculties, especially in punishment
contexts, and/or impaired processing of aversive values of errors
and punishments in individuals with low SR.

Noteworthy errors can also be interpreted as conﬂicts between
the assumed goals and the obtained situations [e.g., (23)], and
conﬂicts have also been proposed to represent aversive signals
(24). In light of the theory of expected value of control (25),
the activity of ACC may be interpreted as a more general
signal regulating cognitive control in demanding situations. This
could suggest that individuals characterized with lower error-
related ACC activity could also show cognitive control deﬁcits
in other situations. A recent review (26) has noted correlations
between neural correlates of error processing (ERN amplitudes)

Learning From Punishments and Self-Regulation

and multiple measures of cognitive control. The measures,
however, did not assess performance related to learning from
errors. Taking the above-mentioned results together, one may
hypothesize that lower ERNs and lower SR may concurrently
relate to impaired learning from errors and punishments.

LEARNING FROM ERRORS AND
PUNISHMENTS

Individual diﬀerences exist relating to tendencies to learn from
rewards or punishments. A probabilistic cognitive reinforcement
learning task used in one study (27) had two stages: learning and
inference. In the learning phase, participants were presented with
three pairs of stimuli (AB, CD, EF, one pair at a time), were to
choose one of the stimuli from a pair, and were provided with
feedback. Choosing A resulted in reward in 80% of trials and
in punishment with 20% probability, while stimulus B had the
opposite contingency. In the CD pair, the probabilities were 70
and 30%, and in the EF pair they were 60 and 40%. During the
learning phase, participants learned to choose A over B; however,
to check whether they had learned to pursue rewards (choose A)
or to avoid punishments (avoid B), a second phase of the task
was conducted. During the inference phase, participants again
were to choose one of two stimuli, but the stimuli were mixed
in diﬀerent pairs (i.e., AC, AD, AE, AF and BC, BD, BE, BF)
and no feedback was provided. Analysis of performance from the
inference stage provides insight into whether participants show
biases toward learning from rewards (more frequent choices of
A) or punishments (more frequent avoidance of B). The authors
recorded EEG during the task and found that learning from
punishments correlated with ERN amplitudes. Unfortunately,
no self-regulation-related questionnaires were employed in the
study. However, together with information presented above, the
results suggest that subjects with low SR, and thus low ERNs,
would show decreased learning from punishments. Several recent
studies support this possibility.

An fMRI study employing a spatial paired-associate learning
task suggests impaired learning from errors in people who
use cannabis (28). In this study, participants were instructed
to remember and recall associations of numbers with spatial
locations on the screen. After a ﬁrst round of recall, subjects
were presented with the correct numbers, and, if they were
they could improve their performance in a
unsuccessful,
second round of recall. The proportion of corrected errors
was signiﬁcantly lower in individuals who used cannabis vs.
those who did not. Neuroimaging results revealed signiﬁcantly
lower error-related brain activity in several regions including
the ACC in individuals who used cannabis. Moreover, the ACC
was implicated in a group-by-error-type interaction (group:
cannabis use vs. non-use; error type: corrected vs. repeated).
The interaction suggested higher ACC activity in the non-using
group during processing of errors that were later corrected. These
results suggest impaired error processing and learning from
errors in relation to cannabis use, although disentangling whether

impaired learning from errors could have led to cannabis abuse
or vice versa would require further studies.

A monetary version of this task, allowing manipulation of
the quantity of the monetary outcomes and to separate rewards
and punishments, was used to investigate cigarette smoking (29).
The study revealed that non-smoking subjects learned better than
smoking subjects from small rewards and large punishments.
fMRI results showed no error-related group diﬀerences in the
ACC. The smoking group, however, showed higher activity
of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during
recall and during re-encoding of errors corrected in the second
round. The authors noted that a “greater need for attentional
control, or reduced eﬃciency in translating DLPFC activation
into attentional control” may be evident in individuals who
smoke cigarettes.

Impaired learning from punishments has been suggested
in opioid addiction during an acquired equivalence task (30).
During the ﬁrst phase of the experiment, subjects were to learn
by trial and error associations between antecedent stimuli and
consequences. Importantly, learning of associations of two of
four antecedent stimuli was reward-based (positive feedback and
points gained for correct choices and no feedback for incorrect
choices) and learning of the other two was punishment-based
(no feedback for correct choices and negative feedback and
points lost for incorrect choices). Relative to healthy comparison
subjects, opioid-addicted participants needed more trials and
committed more errors to reach a desired outcome while learning
from punishments. However, no signiﬁcant group diﬀerence was
found in reward-based learning. The authors concluded that a
“selective deﬁcit in learning from punishment could contribute to
processes by which addicted individuals continue to pursue drug
use even at the cost of negative consequences.”

We have conducted a behavioral study where students high
and low in procrastination performed probabilistic reversal
learning tasks with separate reward and punishment conditions
(31). During the reward condition, participants were to
repeatedly choose between two stimuli, where one had higher
(75%) and the other had lower (25%) probabilities of monetary
reward. Participants were instructed to maximize gains. From
time to time, the stimulus-reward contingencies reversed (the
previously better stimulus became worse and vice versa). In
the punishment condition, the situation was analogous, and
participants were instructed to minimize losses. Analysis was
based on the Rescorla-Wagner model
(32) as applied to
human data (33). The model permits calculation of learning
rates (i.e., rates of change of conviction about stimuli-reward
contingencies) and exploitation-exploration balance of each
participant in each condition (reward/punishment). The analysis
revealed signiﬁcantly lower learning rates in students high
in procrastination regardless of condition. This group also
demonstrated less exploration (or more persistence). A group-
by-condition interaction indicated greater persistence in highly
procrastinating subjects during the punishment condition. These
results suggest that individuals high in procrastination are less
ﬂexible in learning than those low in procrastination, especially
in punishment contexts.

Learning From Punishments and Self-Regulation

Taken together, the above-mentioned results suggest impaired
learning from errors and punishments across diagnostic
boundaries in individuals low in SR.

MALADAPTIVE AVOIDANCE AND
IMPAIRED EMOTIONAL REGULATION

The experiments described in the previous section confront
subjects with choices and do not allow for or assess avoidance.
Employing diﬀerent experimental paradigms could assess
avoidance behaviors that may better resemble real-life situations.
Relatively few such studies have been conducted, with several
described below.

In one study of heroin-dependent and non-dependent control
subjects, participants were asked to perform an escape-avoidance
task in the form of a computer game in which they controlled
a spaceship with the goal of earning points by shooting enemy
spaceships (34). During the ﬁrst twelve “acquisition trials,” a
warning signal announcing a bomb coming was periodically
displayed for 5 s. Appearance of a bomb resulted in a reduction of
points unless subjects hid their spaceship in a “safe box.” During
the next twelve “extinction trials,” no bomb appeared after the
warning signal. Women performed signiﬁcantly worse on the
task, and group diﬀerences were found only in male subjects.
Heroin-dependent males scored signiﬁcantly fewer points than
control subjects because they spent signiﬁcantly more time
hiding in the safe box during the warning signal and a good while
after the “bomb period,” during both acquisition and extinction
trials. This study suggests that heroin-addicted vs. non-addicted
males present exaggerated avoidance behavior that may result in
reduced opportunities to obtain rewards.

A study employing the same task in alcohol-dependent and
healthy men (35) led to similar and diﬀerent results. Alcohol-
dependent men escaped the bomb situation more often than
healthy men. They also tended to spend more time hiding during
the warning signal in the acquisition but not in the extinction
trials. However, alcohol-dependent men scored more points in
total as they shot signiﬁcantly more enemy spaceships than
healthy control men, especially during the extinction phase. The
authors interpreted the results as, “supporting the idea that both
positive and negative reinforcement are important components
underlying addictive behaviors.”

important
consideration in addictions. We use the term maladaptive
avoidance as reﬂecting managing stressful situations by not
addressing them directly, but by averting attention from them
(c.f. “avoidance coping” in APA Dictionary) (36), and this may
in turn eventually lead to negative consequences including more
stress and negative emotions. Whether behaviors observed in
the above-mentioned experimental studies are suitably modeling
real-life maladaptive avoidance may be subject to interpretation
and further investigation; however, a role for maladaptive
avoidance in individuals characterized by poor SR (including
those with addictions) was proposed decades ago (37, 38). In
related models, engaging in maladapitve or addictive behaviors
(e.g., substance abuse, gambling, proctrastination, binge eating)

may serve as a short-term emotion-regulation strategy aimed
at avoiding or alleviating negative aﬀect
[consistent with
negative reinforcement motivations and self-medication models
of addictions (39), among others (8, 40)]. Previous studies
using self-report measures support the notion of engaging in
potentially addictive behaviors like substance use (41), gambling
(42), procrastination (43), and internet use and gaming (44, 45)
for avoiding or alleviating negative mood states.

The described preference to obtain short-term rewards or
relief over avoiding possibly larger long-term punishments in
people with low SR may also may be interpreted in terms of
steep delay discounting or a tendency to value immediate future
events higher than more distant ones. Indeed, a recent meta-
analysis of delay discounting in addictive behaviors found a
small but highly signiﬁcant correlation (46). Interestingly, delay
discounting was correlated with procrastination when measured
with questionnaires (47, 48), but not when measured with tasks
(49). Most previous studies focused however on delayed reward
discounting, and did not include punishments. Future studies
should therefore examine delayed punishment discounting, and
also consider whether there may be causal relationships between
delay discounting and maladaptive avoidance.

suggest

The above-mentioned results

that maladaptive
avoidance may represent a mechanism involved in disorders
characterized by low SR. Maladaptive avoidance tendencies may
reﬂect strategies developed to compensate for poor coping in
response to challenging situations (for example, to decrease
stress when exams approach, students could play computer
games instead of studying). Alternatively, both maladaptive
avoidance and impaired learning from errors and punishments
may indicate impaired cognitive and behavioral control during
emotionally challenging situations in which negative emotions
and/or threat of punishment are experienced or anticipated.

DISCUSSION AND POSSIBLE
MECHANISMS

SR failures related to negative aﬀect may result from imbalances
between subcortical and frontal regions; e.g., insuﬃcient frontal
top-down control “either due to particularly strong impulses
or when prefrontal function itself is impaired” (50). Indeed,
both lack of reward and receipt of punishment have led to
activation of the right DLPFC in healthy subjects (51). These
ﬁndings suggest increased behavioral control in such situations.
According to the theory of expected value of control (25),
cognitive control is implemented by the lateral PFC in response
to ACC signaling a potential need for it. Therefore, it may be
predicted that activity of these prefrontal brain regions related
to punishment or negative aﬀect could diﬀer in individuals high
and low in SR. Indeed, abstinent cocaine-dependent participants
showed hypoactivity of the ACC and right DLPFC in relation
to punished errors in the Go/No-go task (52). We have found
similar results (diminished ACC and right DLPFC activity during
punishment condition in the Go/No-go task) in individuals high
in procrastination (17). These ﬁndings are in line with prior
theories (50) and suggest that impairment of prefrontal control

Learning From Punishments and Self-Regulation

by punishment threat or negative emotions may operate for
many subject groups characterized by low SR. Note, however,
that the previously mentioned study (29) showed higher DLPFC
activity in tobacco-smoking individuals during re-encoding of
later-corrected errors, possibly reﬂecting higher diﬃculty and/or
eﬀort needed to correctly perform in the task, or impaired
mechanisms of regulation of intensity of implemented control
[c.f. (25)].

Prefrontal-striatal mechanisms linked to SR may be amenable
implications. Both
to interventions, with transdiagnostic
regulation of emotion and regulation of motivation (e.g.,
craving in addictive disorders) have been implicated in groups
characterized by low SR. Among individuals who smoke tobacco,
regulation of craving has been found to involve prefrontal
control over striatal cue responsiveness (53). Prefrontal regions
(PFC, ACC) and circuitry (a fronto-cingulo-parietal network)
were less activated and engaged, respectively, in individuals with
internet gaming disorder vs. those without during emotional
regulation (54). Recently, both impaired regulation over
responses to primary rewards and addictive cues have been
reported in internet gaming disorder (55), and stimulation of the
right DLPFC enhanced both regulation of craving and negative
emotions in individuals with internet gaming disorder (56).
Taken together and in line with prior theories of internet gaming
disorder (57) and other addictive behaviors (8, 58), these ﬁndings
suggest that interventions targeting increased prefrontal control
over subcortical emotions/motivations may help multiple groups
with low SR.

Concerning the balance between subcortical and frontal
regions, dysregulation of dopaminergic circuits may be one
mechanism underpinning impaired reward, punishment, and
error processing, and thus underlie impulsivity, addictions and
possibly low SR in general (59–62), although dopamine may play
a more central role in some disorders than in others (63–65).
At least two non-exclusive dopamine-related mechanisms may
underlie aspects of low SR.

First, a “No-Go” pathway could be deﬁciently functioning in
low SR as has been proposed as one element in some models
of addiction (66) and could reﬂect higher striatal and lower
prefrontal activity. However, addictive behaviors have also been
linked to lower striatal activation [e.g., in reward anticipation in
substance use and gambling disorders (67), with similar ﬁndings
in binge eating disorder (68, 69) and internet gaming disorder
(70)]. In several of these studies, blunted striatal activation was
linked to increased impulsivity (71–73), suggesting a relationship
to SR. These ﬁndings are in line with reward deﬁciency models of
addiction (74) and suggest more complex etiologies relating to SR
in addictive disorders. Blunted ventral striatal activation during
a prospect phase of reward and loss processing has been linked
to disadvantageous decision-making in people with and without
gambling disorder, suggesting another route by which reward and
loss processing may link to SR impairment (75). Although some
models suggest that striatal dopamine may underlie aspects of
human addictions (76), ﬁndings may be strongest for stimulant
use disorders (63), and even in such disorders, dopamine receptor
availability may show diﬀerential relationships with measures of
disease severity (77).

When considering the involvement of the striatum in SR,
one should be mindful of complexities involving regions of
the striatum and how they may relate to SR,
including
changes within individuals over time both developmentally and
from life experiences including psychopathology (78, 79). For
example, data suggest that the ventral striatum may be more
linked to impulsive behaviors and dorsal striatum to more
habitual behaviors, with these regions components of diﬀerent
parallel cortico-striato-pallidal-thalamo-cortical circuits that are
involved in diﬀerent stages of disorders (e.g., addictions, impulse
control disorders) characterized by impairments in SR (79–
84). Given these data, a shift from more ventral to dorsal
striatal involvement has been proposed for addictions as they
become more instantiated (84). More recently, a study of
healthy adults performing a naturalistic maze-navigation task
identiﬁed functionally segregated regions of the ventral striatum
that separately encode speciﬁc aspects of performance [eﬀort
activation, movement initiation and eﬀort discounting of rewards
(85)]. Furthermore, opposing patterns of activation related to
eﬀort activation and discounting were associated with striatal
encoding of eﬀort during eﬀort-based decision-making. The
authors suggested that the dorsomedial region of the striatum
that has been previously understood as being linked to action may
rather be involved in assessing cost of eﬀort, raising questions
regarding prior interpretations of striatal “reward” signals. Taken
together, the ﬁndings indicate that more research is needed to
examine involvement of speciﬁc striatal regions and circuits in
studies of the neurochemical and neurocircuitry underpinnings
of SR. Furthermore, additional circuitry should be considered,
consistent with recent models of addiction (8, 40).

Second, considering the diminished error-related ACC
activity, it could be hypothesized that the errors are less salient
in low SR individuals and thus impede learning on errors. Early
data (86) suggested that error-related ACC activity inﬂuenced
learning not to repeat erroneous behaviors, and this may in part
reﬂect dopamine-dependent reinforcement signals from the basal
ganglia. This view was supported by data from patients with
Parkinson’s disease participating in a probabilistic reinforcement
learning task (87) similar to the one described above (27).
Unmedicated Parkinson’s patients, considered characterized by
low dopamine,
learned better based on punishments than
on rewards; application of dopamine-replacement medications
reversed this pattern, suggesting that lower levels of dopamine
may support D2-like-receptor-dependent “No-Go” learning
based on errors and punishments, while high levels of dopamine
may shift the balance toward D1-like-receptor-related “Go”
behaviors (87). This interpretation is consistent with results
of correlations between ERN amplitudes and learning from
punishments in healthy subjects (27). This leads to speculation
that people with lower ERNs and lower tendencies to learn
from punishments may be characterized by higher levels of
striatal dopamine, consistent with ﬁndings suggesting positive
correlation between impulsivity and striatal dopamine measures
(88, 89). Buckholtz and colleagues suggested that high levels
of striatal dopamine in impulsive subjects may result from
lower levels of D2/D3 autoreceptors in the substantia nigra
and ventral tegmental area leading to stronger dopamine cell

Learning From Punishments and Self-Regulation

FIGURE 1 | Schematic hypothetical transdiagnostic model of self-regulation behaviors and disorders in relation to impaired coping and learning from errors and
punishments. Differences between high SR (blue arrows) and low SR (orange arrows) individuals may involve brain reactions to negative affect and punishments. In
individuals high in SR, negative affect and punishments may lead to increased activity of prefrontal control regions (ACC, DLPFC) and increased cognitive and
behavioral control. In individuals low in SR, ACC and DLPFC activity in emotionally challenging situations may be relatively lower and result in impairment of cognitive
and behavioral control. In individuals high in SR, errors may be processed as more salient events and lead to increased monitoring and control, supporting correction
of errors in the future, leading to more rewards and learning of self-regulation. In individuals low in SR, learning from errors and punishments may be impaired. Errors
may be processed as less salient and aversive events and not result in increased monitoring and control, potentially leading to repeating of errors. Eventually however
errors may result in punishments and negative affect and further decline of cognitive and behavioral control. Both because of error-processing and diminished control,
individuals low in SR may preferentially engage in maladaptive behaviors. The behavioral pattern may be reinforced by the relief and rewarding value of substitute
behaviors, eventually preventing individuals low in SR from learning self-regulation.

activity and enhanced release of dopamine which could in turn
increase impulsivity and promote “Go” behaviors (88). However,
given inconsistent ﬁndings and complications of synthesizing
information across studies [e.g.,
from Parkinson and non-
Parkinson populations that may show important dopamine-
related diﬀerences given the pathophysiology of the disorder and
other factors (90, 91)], additional research is necessary.

Summing up, in emotionally challenging situations prefrontal
activity in individuals with low SR may be insuﬃcient to
eﬀectively regulate emotional and motivational drives involving
the striatum and other regions, and this may lead to diﬃculties
in coping with negative situations. Additionally, individuals with
low SR may not learn from errors and punishments, and this
may relate to diﬀerences or impediments in error processing.
Together, these mechanisms may impede coping in negative
situations, hinder learning from such situations and impair
learning SR (Figure 1).

Such maladaptive behaviors may be reinforced over time. In
an fMRI study employing a probabilistic reinforcement learning
task with separated rewards and punishments (51), the authors
showed that both obtaining rewards and avoiding punishments
lead to activation of the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC).
Given that the mOFC is a component of the ventromedial PFC
that has been implicated in processing rewarding outcomes (92),
the ﬁndings suggest that avoidance of aversive outcome may be
rewarding. Similar conclusions were made in a diﬀerent study
employing a repeated acquisition approach-avoidance learning

task and showed, among other regions, activations in anterior
and posterior cingulate and ventral striatum both for rewards
and avoidance of aversive outcomes (93). These studies showed
that reward and avoidance learning rely largely on common brain
networks, consistent with meta-analytic ﬁndings (94). Therefore,
negative reinforcement (i.e., avoidance of punishment) may lead
to consolidation of avoidance behaviors including maladaptive
avoidance. Moreover, engaging in maladapitve behaviors (e.g.,
substance abuse, gambling, gaming) may be rewarding in and
of themselves and thus additionally reinforce such behavioral
patterns (Figure 1).

Summary and Future Directions
In this manuscript, we discuss possible
transdiagnostic
mechanisms underlying poor SR. Impaired coping in emotionally
challenging situations, related to decreased prefrontal activity,
may promote avoidance of such situations in individuals with low
SR. Moreover, impaired error processing may prevent individuals
with low SR from learning from errors and punishments and
impede eﬀective correction of faulty behaviors and learning of SR
itself. Additionally, maladaptive behaviors may be reinforced by
short-term decreases in negative aﬀect and by rewarding values
of behaviors, leading to more persistent engagement (Figure 1).
Whether the model is valid and is transdiagnostic should be a
subject of future studies, which may involve several challenges.
First, regarding learning from errors and punishments, future
studies may beneﬁt from novel tasks (ideally applicable in

neuroimaging studies) as many probabilistic reinforcement
learning tasks often do not show between-group diﬀerences in
task performance and require modeling approaches to show
diﬀerences in learning strategies. Second, new experimental
tasks, better mimicking real-life situations, should be developed
to address learning of avoidance. Ideally, such tasks should
allow participants a choice to avoid engagement in aspects of
the task. They should also allow for distinguishing between
learning of adaptive and maladaptive avoidance. Such human
avoidance research tasks may encounter challenges that should
be considered (95). Future studies should also check whether
punishments, punishing contexts and negative aﬀects evoked
in diﬀerent ways may lead to similar or diﬀerent neuronal
and behavioral eﬀects. Future research could also refer to the
theory of expected value of control and test which of the
proposed components of cognitive control may be particularly
impaired in individuals low in SR: estimation of expected
outcomes, regulation of intensity of control, or monitoring of
performance (25). Ideally, future research will address proposed
mechanisms in a broad range of disorders characterized by
low SR including substance use disorders, behavioral addictions,
binge eating disorder, and other conditions, as well as in other
relevant behavioral dimensions including procrastination and
high impulsivity.

function of neurochemical systems underlying motivational
drives and cognitive control. Neuromodulatory approaches may
be well-suited to increase prefrontal control over subcortical
drives, particularly given the ability to target prefrontal cortical
regions using transcranial direct current
stimulation and
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Limitations
Our proposed model should be considered cautiously. The
understanding of individual diﬀerences, especially concerning
SR,
in processes underlying learning based on errors and
punishment and avoidance learning is still developing; therefore,
the model may currently be considered speculative. Existing data
do not typically permit dissection of causes from consequences
(e.g., of substance abuse); nevertheless, we believe the model

is relevant to SR impairments. In considering a transdiagnostic
mechanism underlying low SR, we considered together many
disorders and behaviors characterized by low SR. In doing so, the
model does not incorporate all mechanisms that may contribute
to low SR,
for example delay discounting or motivational
processes, neither does it include factors relating, for example,
to eﬀects of speciﬁc substances. Noteworthy, we relate the
results of the reported studies to learning of SR, repetitive
engagement
in maladaptive behaviors, and their long-term
negative consequences, while the studies investigated almost
exclusively short-term processes. Thus, it is imaginable that the
experimental situations do not fully reﬂect real-life processes,
especially with respect to preferring short-term rewards over
avoiding of possibly larger long-term punishments, and further
research in this area would likely improve understanding of
mechanisms and help to reﬁne the model. We also simpliﬁed
and limited brain considerations largely to the striatum and PFC,
and we largely did not discuss roles for particular subregions and
other parts of the brain. We also did not discuss the broader range
of neurochemical/neurotransmitter systems that may contribute
to SR. However, we believe that these simpliﬁcations permitted
proposing a model for how impaired coping under negative
aﬀect and impaired learning from errors and punishments may
operate as transdiagnostic mechanisms underlying poor SR. We
hope that future studies will test the proposed model, lead to
the development of more detailed models and facilitate clinical
advances related to poor SR.
