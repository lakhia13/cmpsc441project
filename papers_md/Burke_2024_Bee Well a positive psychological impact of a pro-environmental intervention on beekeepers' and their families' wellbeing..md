Bee Well: a positive psychological 
impact of a pro-environmental 
intervention on beekeepers’ and 
their families’ wellbeing

Bees  are  excellent  pollinators  and  serve  an  essential  environmental  purpose. 
However, little is known about the wellbeing impact of bees on humans. This 
research addressed the knowledge gap concerning the impact of beekeeping 
on  the  wellbeing  of  beekeepers  and  their  families,  focusing  on  the  often-
overlooked psychological, emotional, and social dimensions. Thirty farmers in 
Ireland participating in the Let it Bee project, aimed at promoting biodiversity and 
water source protection, were provided with bee hives. Twelve participants were 
interviewed to explore the effects of beekeeping on their wellbeing. Thematic 
Analysis was employed to analyze the data, revealing five central themes. (1) The 
centrality of pride in accomplishing environmental and community objectives in 
the farmers’ beekeeping activities; (2) the evolving sense of togetherness with 
nature,  family,  and  community  throughout  the  project;  (3)  a  profound  sense 
of  contributing  significantly  to  the  greater  good;  (4)  the  recognized  value  of 
beekeeping  for  beekeepers’  psychological  growth,  flow,  and  relaxation;  and 
(5)  the  opportunity  for  beekeepers  to  leverage  their  character  strengths.  The 
implications of these findings are discussed within the framework of their impact 
on environmental conservation, healthcare policymaking, and implications for 
research and practice.

Introduction

The  beneficial  impact  of  honeybees  on  human  health  benefits  ranges  from  disease 
prevention to therapeutic applications (Lima et al., 2021; Nainu et al., 2021). Additionally, 
honeybees significantly contribute to the attainment of various United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals, particularly in the realms of food security and biodiversity (Patel et al., 
2021). Their symbiotic relationship with nature renders them vulnerable to environmental 
pollutants affecting water, soil, and earth, necessitating global community efforts to safeguard 
their wellbeing (Smart et al., 2016; de Jongh et al., 2022). In Ireland, public sentiment reflects 
concerns, with 88% of individuals expressing dissatisfaction with the government’s efforts to 
preserve bee populations (NBDC, 2018). Despite emerging research highlighting the potential 
negative impact of managed bees on wild bee populations (Iwasaki and Hogendoorn, 2022), 
the critical role of bees in fostering positive health outcomes for both humans and the planet 
remains integral (UNEP, 2022).

In  addition  to  the  environmental  and  human  health  benefits, 
beekeeping has recently garnered attention as a potential source of 
emotional,  psychological,  and  social  wellbeing.  Case  studies 
examining the lives of beekeepers during the COVID-19 pandemic 
highlight  the  positive  impact  of  online  social  connections  among 
beekeepers,  mitigating  feelings  of  loneliness  and  enhancing  social 
resources during periods of self-isolation (Alton and Ratnieks, 2022). 
This social aspect is similar to mindfulness practices, offering stress 
relief, anxiety prevention, and depression mitigation as beekeepers 
find  solace  in  observing  bees  at  work  in  their  gardens.  Moreover, 
creativity  emerges  as  an  outcome  of  beekeeping,  as  beekeepers 
ingeniously  utilize  bee  produce.  Although  the  literature  describes 
various wellbeing behaviors facilitated by beekeeping during the crisis, 
its primary objective is to assess how beekeeping aids in coping rather 
than fostering long-term wellbeing.

Despite the increasing recognition of beekeeping’s potential 
impact on wellbeing, to authors’ knowledge, only two studies have 
explicitly  explored  this  phenomenon.  A  survey  involving  192 
farmers and focus groups with 111 farmers in Vietnam revealed 
improved  family  relations  and  increased  community  respect 
following a beekeeping intervention (Yap et al., 2015). Another 
study surveyed 86 Italian beekeepers and conducted interviews 
with  23,  identifying  positive  emotions,  psychological  flow, 
amazement, and social connection as key outcomes of beekeeping 
(Whitaker, 2023). Notwithstanding their valuable insights, these 
insects)  and 
studies  adopt  entomological  (the  study  of 
anthropological (the study of the origins of human society and 
cultural  development)  perspectives, 
lacking  a  dedicated 
psychological framework. The current research aims to address 
this  gap  by  providing  an  in-depth  examination  of  beekeepers’ 
emotional, psychological, and social experiences, utilizing specific 
wellbeing  frameworks  deriving  from  Positive  Psychology  (the 
study  of  wellbeing  processes,  outcomes  and  characteristics)  to 
assess the broader societal impact of beekeeping on wellbeing.

The current study

The  susceptibility  of  Ireland’s  water  bodies  to  pollution 
primarily  emanates  from  agricultural  practices,  exemplified  by 
instances such as slurry spillage in rural areas. This phenomenon 
has led to a catastrophic decline in biodiversity, emerging as the 
predominant threat to Irish water bodies, leaving only 0.6% of the 
nation’s rivers classified as pristine (DHPLG, 2018). The National 
Biodiversity Plan highlights Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, and 
habitat loss as the principal threats to EU protected habitats (NPWS, 
2017). Adherence to existing environmental regulations alone is 
insufficient to reverse this concerning trend. Although scientific 
knowledge  has  progressed  significantly  in  addressing  these 
challenges,  the  translation  of  scientific  insights  into  actionable 
community and individual measures remains a formidable task. 
Recognizing this, the National Federation of Group Water Scheme 
initiated the National Groundwater Source Protection pilot program 
in  County  Roscommon  in  2019.  This  comprehensive  initiative 
encompassed various components, including providing 30 farmers 
with beehives, training, and mentoring to foster environmentally 
friendly farming practices and cultivate a heightened appreciation 
for nature. Other program strands involved initiatives to safeguard 

water  bodies,  preserve  wild  bees,  reduce  pesticide  application, 
implement nature-based solutions for water body protection, wild 
bee preservation, and the creation of riparian habitats to enhance 
biodiversity and nutrient capture.

An  illustrative  impact  example  from  the  program  involves  a 
farmer who received beehives. In response, the farmer planted 4,500 
native hedge plants and established a native apple orchard on their 
farm to support the bees. He encouraged neighboring farmers to do 
the same. Thus, one of them planted 1,000 native hedge plants, while 
another established a wild meadow covering a 3,600 sq. m area. This 
cascade of positive changes occurred in response to a farmer receiving 
beehives. These collective actions had demonstrable positive effects on 
water  quality,  biodiversity,  and  the  overall  climate  within 
the catchment.

Farmers are often characterized as “accidental environmentalists” 
due to their engagement in pro-environmental behaviors motivated 
by  various  non-ecological  factors,  including  the  health  and 
wellbeing  of  their  families  (Marr  and  Howley,  2019).  Evidence 
indicates  a  correlation  between  farmers’  symptoms  of  mental 
illness, such as depression, distress, and suicidal ideation, and farm-
related stressors such as droughts or crop failure (Batterham et al., 
2015).  Despite  this,  the  concept  of  wellbeing,  construed  as  the 
presence of positive psychological resources, has been overlooked 
in farming and environmental research (Saxby et al., 2018; Burke 
et  al.,  2023).  Consequently,  the  current  research  endeavored  to 
evaluate  the  impact  of  the  Let  it  Bee  biodiversity  project  on  the 
wellbeing of farmers and their families, recognizing the potential 
bidirectional  relationship  between  pro-environmental  behaviors 
and wellbeing.

Positive psychology perspective

Positive  psychology  (PP)  represents  a  paradigm  within  the 
scientific study of human wellbeing that focuses on elucidating what 
is  right  with  individuals,  as  opposed  to  pathology-oriented 
perspectives (see Burke, 2021 for a review). The conceptual trajectory 
of  inquiry  within  this  domain  has  undergone  a  transformation, 
initially cantered on the examination of positive attributes, processes, 
and  institutions  (Seligman  and  Csikszentmihalyi,  2000).  This 
trajectory  has  evolved  to  encompass  an  acknowledgment  of  the 
positive consequences arising from adverse states, and prompting an 
awareness of the requisite conceptual and methodological intricacies 
involved in integrating positive psychological perspectives with other 
realms of research (Lomas and Ivtzan, 2016; Lomas et al., 2021).

This  stands  in  contrast  to  traditional  wellbeing  frameworks 
informed by medical perspectives, which emphasize the absence of 
diseases or infirmities, such as depression or anxiety (WHO, 2023). 
Wellbeing, as conceived from the vantage point of positive psychology, 
delves  into  emotional,  psychological,  and  social  resources.  These 
resources not only act as preventive factors against mental illness and 
mood disorders but also contribute to the promotion of flourishing 
and the development of wellbeing resources (Schotanus-Dijkstra et al., 
2019).  Flourishing,  in  this  context,  is  defined  as  the  pinnacle  of 
emotional, social, and psychological functioning (Keyes, 2002). The 
resources  constituting  wellbeing  from  the  positive  psychology 
perspective  serve  as  the  underpinning  for  fostering  psychological 
resilience and a meaningful life.

Various models and measures of flourishing have been proposed, 
with the Mental Health Continuum by Keyes (2002) being the most 
prevalent, exhibiting robust validity and providing substantial data on 
the  impact  of  flourishing  on  wellbeing  (Iasiello  et  al.,  2022).  The 
Mental  Health  Continuum  encompasses  two  primary  theories  of 
wellbeing: (1) Psychological Wellbeing, drawing on Ryff (1989, 2014) 
concept  of  eudaimonia  (living  a  virtuous  life),  and  (2)  Subjective 
Wellbeing, rooted in Diener (2012) concept of Subjective Wellbeing 
underpinned by hedonism (experiencing more pleasure than pain in 
life).  Additionally,  it  incorporates  a  model  of  Social  Wellbeing 
proposed by Keyes (1998). Recently, an alternative model emphasizing 
living a psychologically rich life, leading to optimal functioning, has 
been  introduced  (Oishi  and  Westgate,  2022).  These  theories 
collectively  represent  the  positive  psychological  perspective  on 
wellbeing,  reflecting  a  multifaceted  approach  that  encompasses 
diverse  wellbeing  components,  culminating  in  the  overarching 
outcome of flourishing.

Despite  widespread  reports  of  happiness,  only  a  minority  of 
individuals experience flourishing, and this state offers protection 
against  mood  disorders  and  further  symptom  development 
(Schotanus-Dijkstra et al., 2019; Burns et al., 2022). Flourishers are at 
significantly lower risk of a major depressive episode compared to 
languishers  (individuals  reporting  low  levels  of  emotional  and 
psychological functioning) and those moderately well (individuals 
reporting mixed levels of emotional and psychological functioning) 
(Keyes, 2002). Flourishing, however, exhibits fluidity, as evidenced by 
a  50%  decline  in  flourishing  over  a  decade,  with  subsequent 
implications  for  mental  health  outcomes  (Keyes  et  al.,  2010). 
Interventions grounded in the positive psychology framework have 
the potential to elevate the population’s health by fostering higher 
levels  of  optimal  functioning,  thereby  reducing  the  incidence  of 
mental health issues (Huppert, 2005).

In summary, the Bee Well project sought to examine the wellbeing 
impact of pro-environmental initiatives by investigating the effects of 
the Let It Bee biodiversity project on farmers and their families. In light 
of the limited scholarly attention within the realm of positive psychology 
concerning this subject, the present study aims to make a distinctive 
contribution to the expanding body of research aimed at improving 
wellbeing. Furthermore, this contribution extends to the broader field 
of environmental research, encompassing the exploration of diverse 
sources and ramifications of pro-environmental interventions, such as 
wellbeing, with the overarching objective of environmental preservation 
and a collective commitment to climate protection.

Method

This qualitative research project was conducted over the period 
from February to June 2023, following rigorous ethical considerations. 
Ethical  approval  was  obtained  from  the  RCSI  (Royal  College  of 
Surgeons in Ireland) ethics committee, aligning with the Charter of 
Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The research adhered to 
ethical guidelines outlined in the European Convention on Human 
Rights and its supplementary Protocols, as well as the Declaration of 
Helsinki and the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity. 
Compliance  with  the  EU  General  Data  Protection  Regulation 
(Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (GDPR) governed the use and transfer of 
pseudonymized participant data.

Participants

The study involved a cohort of 12 farmers, comprising ten males 
and two females. Age distribution included five participants aged 60 
and above, four aged 50–59, two aged 40–49, and one participant aged 
18–29. In terms of farm size, three participants owned small farms, 
three  assessed  their  farms  as  medium-sized,  and  six  managed 
large farms.

Procedure

The  research  design  encompassed  two  key  components:  (1)  a 
pre-interview survey and (2) one-to-one semi-structured interviews.

Pre-interview survey

Before the semi-structured interviews, participants completed a 
brief survey regarding their involvement in the Let it Bee project. This 
survey collected demographic data (age, gender, and farm size) and 
provided an avenue for participants to share narratives about their 
engagement in the Let it Bee project. Specifically, participants they 
were asked 5 questions about the project, which they assessed on a 
5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. 
The questions stated: (1) The Let it Bee project made my life (a) more 
enjoyable, (b) more meaningful, (c) more profitable, (d) more stressful; 
(2)  the  project  helped  me  connect  with  my  community;  (3)  The 
project has improved the quality of my family’s life; (4) The project has 
improved biodiversity in my area; (5) The project has improved water 
quality in my area. The objective of asking these questions was to 
establish a foundational context for participants, affording them the 
opportunity to engage in reflection regarding the influence of bees on 
various aspects of their lives. This preliminary grounding served as a 
prelude  to  eliciting  participants’  personalized  perspectives  of  the 
observed wellbeing impact. Descriptive analysis of the survey data was 
conducted using SPSS (version 27).

Interviews

In-depth  “walking”  interviews  were  employed  to  explore  the 
impact  of  the  Let  it  Bee  project  on  farmers’  wellbeing  and  their 
families. This innovative data collection method involved researchers 
and participants engaging in conversation while walking together, 
facilitating  the  collection  of  narratives  and  stories  related  to  the 
research topic (O’Neill and Finnegan, 2020). This approach aimed to 
deepen the understanding of farmers’ experiences within their natural 
habitat, where they typically feel most at ease.

The  interview  schedule  comprised  questions  relating  to  (1) 
participants’ involvement in the Let it Bee project (why they decided 
to  do  it,  how  their  family  reacted  to  it,  what  obstacles  they  have 
experienced and what were the outcomes of their struggle), (2) the 
impact that the project had on them, (3) the impact that the project 
had on their family. The prompts included such questions as whether 
Let it Bee project changed their relationships with people, impacted 
their  priorities  in  life,  changed  their  health  in  any  way  and  what 
attitudes or behaviors it altered (if any).

All interviews were recorded using two smartphone recording 
applications as a precautionary measure in the event of a technological 
failure.  The  interviews  were  conducted  by  both  authors  and 
subsequently transcribed by one author. The anonymization of all data 
occurred during the transcription process. Preceding and following 
each interview, both authors actively participated in reflective practice, 
using  a  notebook.  Subsequent  to  each  interview  session,  they 
dedicated  time  to  articulate  and  deliberate  upon  their  reflections, 
encompassing observations, cognitive impressions, preconceptions, 
and emotional responses evoked during various junctures. At the end 
of  each  data-collection  day,  additional  reflective  insights  were 
incorporated  into  their  respective  reflective  diaries,  and  the  data 
gleaned from their individual notes was referred to at the analytical 
phase of the research. The rich, detailed, multisensory data obtained 
from the walking interviews underwent analysis using a combination 
of inductive and deductive Thematic Analysis (Braun and Clarke, 
2021). Following the input of data into the MAXQDA software (2022), 
the preliminary coding process was undertaken by one researcher, 
while  the  subsequent  coding  and  developing  initial  themes  were 
carried out by the second researcher. This sequence was succeeded by 
a  three-hour  meeting  during  which  all  identified  themes  were 
discussed and mutually agreed upon.

Results

Part 1: pre-interview survey

The preliminary phase of the research involved the administration 
of  a  survey  before  conducting  interviews,  aiming  to  assess  the 
influence of the Let it Bee project on participants’ wellbeing and their 
perceptions of associated environmental changes. The survey results 
were  categorized  into  three  distinct  groups:  (1)  wellbeing,  (2) 
environment, and (3) financial, as detailed in Table 1.

The majority of participants expressed sentiments of enjoyment 
and  meaning  derived  from  beekeeping,  viewing  it  as  a  means  of 
interpersonal connection. While two participants reported finding 
beekeeping stressful, the prevailing sentiment among others did not 

TABLE 1  Pre-interview survey results (N  =  12).

align  with  this  perspective.  Interestingly,  only  five  participants 
acknowledged  a  positive  impact  on  their  overall  quality  of  life. 
Concerning  the  environment,  a  consensus  emerged  among  most 
participants  affirming  that  beekeeping  has  contributed  to  the 
enhancement  of  biodiversity  in  their  respective  areas,  with  some 
noting observable improvements in water quality. It is noteworthy that 
a majority of participants did not report financial gains from their 
beekeeping endeavors.

Part 2: interviews

The qualitative analysis of interview data unveiled five prominent 
themes: (1) pride, (2) togetherness, (3) greater good, (4) value, (5) 
character strengths (Table 2 and Figure 1).

Pride

Every participant conveyed a sense of pride intricately connected 
to their beekeeping endeavors, stemming from diverse sources. Some 
participants took pride in the quality of their produce.

“A friend from football called in and she’d get a jar of honey, she’d 
say it was the best honey and she’d call again for more” (Sorcha, 
Pos. 48).

Conversely,  others 

found  pride 

in 

contributing 

to 

community health.

“Locals have rung me up looking for honey because they had kids in 
the house who had asthma” (Walter, Pos. 52).

Participants also expressed pride in the environmental impact of 

beekeeping activities.

“There were berries (on the trees). We never had that, we have it 
now and it’s all down to the bees” (Oisin, Pos. 92).

Additionally, some participants took pride in the collective efforts 
of their community, highlighting instances where service users from 
a local Mental Health hospital contributed to the project by crafting 
bee-hotels.

“The people who were making them would say: we have five of them 
ready when are you taking them. They became very emotional when 
they were doing it, and it was something different” (Walter, Pos. 89).

Consequently,  the  pervasive  sentiment  of  pride  resonated 
throughout all interviews, influencing diverse facets of farmers’ lives.

Togetherness

The  theme  of  togetherness  revolves  around  beekeepers 
establishing a sense of unity with their families, community, fellow 

beekeepers, nature, and the bees. This overarching theme encompassed 
five  distinct  subthemes  that  emerged  under  the  category  of 
togetherness,  (1)  connection,  (2)  engagement,  (3)  confidence,  (4) 
kindness, and (5) support.

Connection

Each  participant  consistently  reported  experiencing  a 
heightened  connection  to  nature  and  bees,  surpassing  previous 
engagements with the care of cattle or the cultivation of crops. This 
connection  transcended  mere  observation;  participants  actively 
listened  to  and  observed  bees,  fostering  a  profound  sense  of 
oneness. Some participants detailed a synchronization with bees to 
the extent that the insects’ emotional states influenced their own; 
when bees exhibited agitation, participants similarly experienced 
distress,  and  conversely,  calmness 
in  the  bees  elicited  a 
corresponding  tranquility  in  the  participants.  This  deepened 
connection prompted participants to adopt a perspective aligned 
with that of the bees, fostering a mutual understanding. Here is an 
example of this bee-human symbiosis resulting from the established 
connection is provided:

“You’d look at the hive of bees, at the entrance see what they're doing, 
and you can tell a lot about the weather” (Colm, Pos. 21).

Participants also established connections with local beekeepers; 
consequently, individuals experiencing loneliness connected with  
others.

“So, you make friends (…). That is probably good for your mental 
health, a positive thing for a lot of people” (Eamon, Pos. 130).

Selected participants have opted to join beekeepers’ clubs, thereby 
expanding their social network and discovering a community with 
whom they could establish deeper connections.

“There are some really lovely people, they don't impose themselves 
on you, and would help you in the club” (Raymond, Pos. 134).

Beekeepers  established  connections  with  strangers  who,  upon 
discovering their involvement in beekeeping, stopped their cars to 
inquire. They also engaged more with neighbors with whom they 
traditionally  exchanged  only  greetings.  Since  acquiring  bees, 
neighbors regularly approached them with enquiries about bee-related 
matters, seeking guidance on farming practices to ensure the wellbeing 
of the bees. The presence of bees has emerged as a catalyst for initiating 
conversations,  facilitating  numerous  participants  in  establishing 
connections within their community.

“My  neighbor  up  the  road  rang  me  one  day,  she  wanted  to  go 
spraying briars and asked me what I think of it, if I didn’t have the 
beehives, she wouldn’t have rang me” (Walter, Pos. 48).

Ultimately, participants cultivated deeper connections with their 
families. Grandparents forged bonds with their grandchildren, who 
now associated any bee sighting with their grandparents’ beekeeping 
endeavors. Parents articulated a commitment to enhanced quality 
time  with  their  children,  focusing  on  tending  to  the  bees  and 
distancing themselves from digital devices. For parents with adult

children, the shared challenge of beekeeping provided a new avenue 
for connection and collaboration within the familial unit.

reinforcing  the  communal  aspect  of  their  presence.  Additionally, 
participants extended these acts of kindness by sharing honey with 
their family members and friends.

“We probably spend more time together, a lot of time harvesting 
honey” (Sorcha, Pos. 22).

Engagement

Numerous participants emphasized that beekeeping evolved 
into an engaging communal activity. It transcended mere social 
connections  by  fostering  shared,  profound  interest  in  bees, 
enabling individuals to elevate their relationships without self-
consciousness.  Participants  dedicated  considerable  time  to 
discussions  and  interactions  cantered  around  this  shared 
fascination. An illustrative example involves a childless participant 
who actively involved his niece in beekeeping, leading to joint 
activities such as sharing books, viewing bee-related videos, and 
harvesting  honey  together.  Parents  with  underage  children 
recounted  their  children’s  heightened  engagement,  expressing 
interest  in  joining  beekeepers’  clubs  for  adults.  Beekeepers, 
irrespective  of  their  typical  reading  habits,  demonstrated  an 
inclination  to  purchase  books  as  part  of  their  commitment  to 
expanding their knowledge about bees.

“I got a suit for her when she's coming down during the summer. 
We  spend  time  looking  at  them  and  seeing  what  they're  doing” 
(Ciaran, Pos. 37).

Confidence

Beekeepers  articulated  a  notable  increase  in  their  personal 
confidence. Specifically, one participant disclosed a history of mental 
health issues and shared that tending to the bees had significantly 
enhanced his happiness and confidence, fostering a belief in his ability 
to  contribute  meaningfully  to  both  the  community  and  the 
environment. Other participants highlighted the positive effects of 
beekeeping on their children, noting an observed increase in their 
children’s self-assurance. Being recognized as beekeepers at school 
provided their children with a distinct identity, resulting in frequent 
requests for them to speak about their beekeeping experiences within 
the school community.

“There is a huge change. They were sitting in the classroom, and they 
couldn’t talk about anything. They are not into football (…) but now 
they have something to talk about in the class. And they would stand 
up  and  everyone  would  sit  and  listen,  including  the  teachers.  It 
builds their confidence hugely.” (Colm, Pos. 46).

Kindness

The  majority  of  participants  highlighted  the  benevolence 
engendered  by  bees  within  the  community.  Beekeepers  actively 
engaged in acts of kindness, exemplified by the distribution of honey 
jars to their neighbors. This altruistic gesture was rooted in the belief 
that  the  bees  were  communal  entities,  contributing  to  the  overall 
wellbeing of the community rather than serving individual beekeepers. 
Notably,  the  bees  utilized  community  gardens  for  pollination, 

“I wouldn’t put a monetary value on it either. It’s a gift. A gift that 
you won't get everywhere because it's a pure natural gift” (Brian, 
Pos. 54).

Ultimately, a considerable number of beekeepers engaged in 
reciprocal  acts  of  kindness  toward  one  another.  Drawing 
inspiration from the bees’ model of a harmonious society, they 
sought to contribute to their human “hive” in a manner analogous 
to  the  bees’  communal  collaboration.  This  demonstrated  an 
alignment between the behavior observed in bee societies and the 
reciprocal  kindness  practiced  within  the  human  community 
of beekeepers.

“The  gift  of  nature  (...)  so  that  there  is  a  sense  of  community” 
(Bridget, Pos. 88).

Support

Participants marveled at the reciprocal support evident within 
their beekeeping network. This support extended beyond financial 
transactions,  with  beekeepers  willingly  assisting  each  other  in 
situations  where  bee-hives  faced  challenges  without  expecting 
remuneration.  The  support  network  operated  through  various 
channels, including regular interactions during network meetings and 
communication  through  phone  calls  to  discuss  issues  related  to 
bee-hives. Additionally, participants highlighted the sense of support 
received from the broader community, particularly in the context of 
environmental initiatives aimed at enhancing the survival of bees. 
Notably, this support also encompassed the engagement of families 
fully involved in beekeeping activities.

“It is nice to impart knowledge to others I wouldn’t be anywhere 
unless I had good mentors behind me” (Brendan, Pos. 31).

Value

The  thematic  focus  on  value  in  the  context  of  beekeeping 
encapsulated  three  central  themes:  (1)  growth,  (2)  flow,  and  (3) 
restoration.

Growth

journey  cantered  around 

The  majority  of  beekeepers  expressed  their  commitment  to  a 
lifelong  educational 
intricate 
understanding of bees. While the learning trajectory proved steep for 
some and less challenging for others, all participants acknowledged 
the significance of continuous learning, fostering the growth of their 
expertise in beekeeping.

“It's a skill you can't learn from a book. (...) It was a new thing in 
the evenings to do. I don't go football and or anything like that it's 
like another bit of hobby” (Colm, Pos. 6).

Flow

Numerous participants elaborated on their encounters with a state 
of  flow,  noting  the  phenomenon  of  losing  track  of  time  and  self-
awareness  while  tending  to  bees.  One  farmer  disclosed  spending 
entire Saturdays engrossed in beekeeping to the extent of forgetting to 
eat lunch. Parents shared anecdotes of their children becoming deeply 
engrossed  in  beekeeping,  leading  them  to  lose  themselves  in  the 
activity and spend extended periods at the beehive instead of watching 
the TV or playing online games.

“All  you  do  is  think  about  the  bees,  focus  on  the  task”  (Sorcha, 
Pos. 78).

Restoration

The  majority  of  participants  discussed  the  rejuvenating 
significance of beekeeping, highlighting its capacity to elicit a surge 
of  positive  emotions.  These  emotions  encompassed  feelings  of 
serenity, calmness, awe, and unadulterated happiness while observing 
the industrious activities of the bees. One participant articulated the 
act of turning to beekeeping as an escape during tumultuous periods 
at home, describing how it facilitated a process of cantering oneself 
and  recuperating  from  the  challenges  posed  by  the  demands  of 
daily life.

“You just go down and take a couple of hours (…) it's a relaxing 
couple of hours” (Walter, Pos. 28).

Greater good

The thematic element of “Greater Good” surfaced consistently 
throughout  all  participant  interviews,  delineating  the  beekeepers’ 
capacity  to  go  beyond  individual  perspectives  and  recognize  the 
transcendent  nature  inherent  in  the  practice  of  beekeeping.  This 
theme comprises two subthemes, (1) meaning, and (2) perspective.

Meaning

Participants recognized that beekeeping surpassed a mere leisure 
pursuit  centered  on  honey  production,  embodying  a  profound 
significance that extended to their ecological impact. Prior to engaging 
in beekeeping, individuals aspired to make a positive contribution to the 
environment yet were uncertain about how to do it. Beekeeping allowed 
them to contribute meaningfully to the environmental protection.

“They (the neighbors) are not into bees - they do that (…) for the 
next persons" (Colm, Pos. 113).

Perspective

Several participants highlighted a transformative shift in their 
perspectives facilitated by their interaction with bees. This experiential 
learning from bees encompassed insights into leading a virtuous life, 
conservation of resources, and fostering a connection with nature. 
Additionally,  participants  acknowledged  gaining  valuable  lessons 
from bees about societal dynamics, leading to a heightened awareness 
of both commendable practices and areas for improvement in their 
own actions.

“They are very fascinating if you look at what they do, they way they 
organize themselves it’s a bit like there is no one in charge but they 
are all in charge it is the way that society should work, but it doesn’t” 
(Raymond, Pos. 13).

Character strengths

The overarching theme derived from this study indicated that the 
care of bees has provided farmers with an opportunity to leverage 
their individual character strengths, irrespective of what they were. 
Individuals requiring reconnection with nature found the space to 
achieve this through beekeeping. Those inclined towards training and 
educating others utilized their strengths by actively participating in 
bee  clubs  and  teaching  others  beekeeping  skills.  Furthermore, 
individuals possessing leadership skills had an opportunity to use 
them  by  leading  the  change  in  their  community.  Consequently, 
beekeeping emerged as a facilitator for farmers to realize their optimal 
potential, experience a sense of accomplishment within the area they 
were good at and become the most refined version of themselves.

“(In my) trade, the detail is important, you know, when you’re 
doing something, you’re doing it and you’re not thinking about 
the next job or something else. (…) When I’m with bees I kind of 
like to block out everything else that's going on in my mind and 
sort of concentrate on what I’m doing” (Padraic, Pos. 17).

Discussion

“The awareness of the environment has come much more to the fore; 
we  have  to  be  more  aware  of  what  is  happening  to  the  climate 
anyone that is involved in farming” (Walter, Pos. 56).

Numerous  participants  articulated  their  engagement  in 
beekeeping as a facet of their legacy, aiming to contribute to a 
more  sustainable  world  for  subsequent  generations.  Their 
motivation  was  rooted  in  a  desire  for  younger  individuals  to 
recognize  their  efforts  in  environmental  preservation.  A 
grandparent expressed a wish for their grandchildren to reflect 
upon the bees and acknowledge the substantial contribution they 
made to the bees’ survival over the years.

This study represents a pioneering exploration into the positive 
psychological  implications  of  beekeeping  on  the  wellbeing  of 
beekeepers and their families. The theme of “Togetherness,” previous 
research highlighted beekeeping as a source of fostering a happier 
family connection, emphasizing positive interactions with bees and 
sharing produce with loved ones (Alton and Ratnieks, 2022; Whitaker, 
2023). However, the current research expanded upon these family 
benefits by highlighting intergenerational interest sparked by bees, 
uniting parents with children, grandparents with grandchildren, and 
uncles  with  nieces.  The  resulting  connections  equipped  young 
individuals  with  beekeeping  skills,  diverting  their  attention  from 
digital  devices,  fostering  confidence  through  participation  in

beekeeping clubs, and allowing them to share knowledge within their 
school  community,  thus  contributing  to  positive  youth  identity 
development (Tsang et al., 2012).

involves 

Furthermore, this study constituted the initial exploration of a 
phenomenon termed as “positivity resonance” occurring between 
humans  and  animals.  Positivity  resonance 
the 
co-experience of positive emotions among humans, encompassing 
non-verbal  and  biological  synchrony  (Wells  et  al.,  2022). 
Preliminary investigations propose that this process correlated with 
reductions in depressive symptoms, loneliness, and illness-related 
symptoms, along with enhancements in psychological flourishing 
(Major  et  al.,  2018).  Additionally,  it  fosters  pro-social  behavior 
(Zhou et al., 2022) and contributes to a heightened sense of life 
meaning  (Prinzing  et  al.,  2023).  The  present  study,  uniquely, 
identified a comparable psychological manifestation of positivity 
resonance between humans and bees, when farmers reflected on 
how  the  bees’  emotional  experience  influenced  theirs  and  vice 
versa. Further enquiry is imperative to delve into this phenomenon 
at a biological level, clarifying the similarities and distinctions in 
wellbeing outcomes associated with positivity resonance between 
humans and between humans and bees. This discovery may pave 
the  way  for  future  research  endeavors  investigating  positivity 
resonance between humans and the broader animal kingdom as a 
mechanism  creating  the  impact  of  animals  and  insects  on 
human wellbeing.

In alignment with previous research demonstrating reciprocity as 
an  outcome  of  beekeeping  (Whitaker,  2023),  this  study  revealed 
community support for participants, transcending mere reciprocity 
and family support. The evidence suggested that beekeepers felt fully 
supported by the community in ensuring the survival of their bees. 
Neighbors actively changed farming practices, cultivated meadows for 
the bees, erected fences supporting the project, and planted apple 
orchards.  This  community  support  extended  beyond  expected 
reciprocation,  prompting  further  investigation  into  the  factors 
influencing this phenomenon in relation to bees and the potential role 
of other project- or community-related factors.

The  current  research  expands  on  the  notion  of  reciprocity  by 
introducing kindness as a prominent theme. Participants perceived 
bees not as personal possessions but as communal entities, prompting 
acts of kindness such as gifting neighbor’s jars of honey or providing 
natural  medicine  to  community  members  with  ailments.  The 
participants’ high valuation of their unique produce accentuated the 
significance of the positive impact derived from their acts of kindness. 
Drawing  on  a  systematic  review  indicating  positive  wellbeing 
outcomes  for  the  giver  (Curry  et  al.,  2018)  and  stress  reduction 
associated with acts of kindness (Fryburg, 2021), it is plausible that 
participants’ lower stress levels in beekeeping are linked to the positive 
effects of sharing honey.

Regarding the theme of “Value,” the current research aligns with 
previous  studies  demonstrating  psychological  growth,  flow,  and 
restoration as outcomes of beekeeping (Yap et al., 2015; Whitaker, 
2023). A noteworthy distinction arises between psychological flow 
and  restoration,  with  the  former  occurring  during  challenging 
situations  where  individuals  can  employ  their  skills.  Conversely, 
restoration  involves  a  state  of  relaxation  allowing  for  attention 
deactivation  and  recovery,  such  as  observing  bees.  Both  states 
contribute differently to wellbeing outcomes and need to be further 
researched in the context of beekeeping.

A novel contribution of the present study involves the “Greater 
Good” theme, specifically the perspective-changing aspect resembling 
psychological  richness  (Oishi  and  Westgate,  2022).  Participants, 
influenced by observing bees and their ideal society, exhibited altered 
behavior and perspectives towards others. This psychological richness, 
usually associated with experiences like travel, club memberships, or 
sports (Oishi et al., 2021), is now extended to beekeeping. Further 
research  is  essential  to  compare  the  impact  of  beekeeping  on 
psychological richness with other activities, particularly in the context 
of  environmental  sciences,  given 
link  with 
pro-environmental behaviors (Wei et al., 2023).

its  established 

This  study  the  first  to  demonstrate  how  beekeeping  enables 
participants to leverage their character strengths, a factor associated 
with higher reported levels of wellbeing (Lee et al., 2020). Beekeeping 
facilitated  the  effective  use  of  strengths,  whether  through  leading 
change, teaching beekeeping, or expressing kindness when sharing bee 
produce. This demonstrated the diverse ways in which beekeeping 
positively impacted individuals based on their character strengths. 
Given that strength use is associated with psychological flourishing 
(Hone et al., 2015), an ability for farmers to engage their strengths 
through beekeeping can become a source of improved wellbeing.

The current study represented a pioneering effort to examine 
the influence of beekeeping on key facets of wellbeing within the 
frameworks of flourishing, as conceptualized by Positive Psychology 
research.  Notably,  the  elements  corresponding  to  PERMA 
(Seligman, 2011), the Mental Health Continuum (Keyes, 2002), and 
Psychological Richness (Oishi and Westgate, 2022) were evident in 
the beekeeping experiences of farmers. Over the years, a range of 
Positive Psychology Interventions have been created to enhance 
these dimensions of wellbeing (e.g., Pawelski, 2020; Burke et al., 
2023). The  results  of  this  study  showed  that  beekeeping  has  the 
potential to emerge as a Positive Psychology Intervention, thereby 
assisting individuals and their families in reinforcing psychological, 
emotional, and social well-being while concurrently contributing 
to environmental improvement.

Implications for policy and practice

The present study represents a significant contribution to the field 
of climate and environmental science, particularly in clarifying the 
impact  of  pro-environmental  behaviors  such  as  beekeeping  on 
beekeepers’ and their family’s wellbeing. This contribution holds the 
potential for changing the conceptual framework for integrated land 
and landscape management, as envisioned by the Irish-government-
funded initiative, An Foram Uisce (2021). The change could relate to 
the  powerful  impact  of  wellbeing  as  an  outcome  of  not  only 
beekeeping but potentially other pro-environmental actions, which 
need to be considered alongside environmental research findings.

In  contrast  to  the  prevailing  perspective  that  predominantly 
emphasizes  the  personal  burdens  and  anxieties  associated  with 
environmental  protection  (e.g.,  eco-anxiety),  the  current  research 
diverges by accentuating the personal advantages individuals accrue 
through  active  participation  in  pro-environmental  programs. 
Consequently, these findings offer a novel perspective that could serve 
as  a  motivational 
toward 
pro-environmental  actions,  emphasizing  the  personal  benefits 
associated with engaging in climate-related initiatives.

Limitations

In spite of its manifold advantages, the extant research exhibits 
three principal limitations. Primarily, the non-generalizability of the 
sample  necessitates  future  investigations  encompassing  a  more 
expansive cohort of beekeepers to corroborate the present findings. 
Secondly, the Let it Bee initiative was designed to incentivize farmers 
to enhance water quality in the region. This clear objective may have 
potentially magnified the eudaimonic outcomes of the study for all 
participants.  Subsequent  research  endeavors  should  consider  the 
wellbeing  impact  of  beekeepers  with  other  motivations  for 
engagement. Lastly, the current enquiry exclusively gauged the impact 
on family wellbeing from the vantage point of beekeepers, prompting 
a recommendation for future investigations to scrutinize the outlooks 
of individual family members.

In conclusion, this study is the first to explore into the wellbeing 
ramifications of beekeeping from a positive psychological standpoint. 
The  innovative  findings  contribute  to  environmental  research  by 
clarifying the interconnections between pro-environmental activities 
and emotional, social, and psychological wellbeing. Moreover, these 
findings  establish  a  foundation  for  further  examination  of  the 
potential role of beekeeping in improving the wellbeing of individuals 
and their respective families.
