problems in Nepal: a scoping review

Abstract 
Introduction:  Globally, 10–20% of children and adolescents suffer from mental disorders, with half of all them start-
ing by the age of 14 and three-quarters before the age of 25. In Nepal, 40% of the population is younger than 18 years 
of age, and as such there is a large proportion of the population that is at risk of developing a mental disorder. There 
has been a recent recognition of child and adolescent mental health problems in Nepal, although prior to this it had 
remained almost invisible on the health agenda. In response to growing concern, there is a need to conduct a review 
on children and adolescent mental health problems in Nepal.

Objective:  To review the existing studies on child and adolescent mental health problems in Nepal.

Methodology:  A scoping review approach was used to identify studies on child and adolescent mental problems in 
Nepal. A search of Medline and PubMed databases for articles published from the database inception to August 2018 
was conducted.

Results:  Ten papers were identified, and they all together included 7876 participants. Two studies reported on Post 
traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) and described a prevalence of 10.7% to 51% of earthquake-affected children 
and adolescents in the Kathmandu district of Nepal. Another study reported that 53.2% of former child soldiers met 
the cut-off score for PTSS. Two school surveys found that the prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems in 
school children ranged between 12.9 and 17.03%, whereas a study on emotional and behavioural disorders in home-
less children reported a prevalence of 28.6%. The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) was estimated to be 
as high as three in every 1000 persons in Nepal by one study. The clinical prevalence of anxiety disorders was reported 
ranging from 18.8% to 24.4% while that of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was 10–11.7% in various 
clinical samples of children and adolescents.

Conclusion:  Only a few studies on the prevalence of child and adolescent mental health in Nepal have been con-
ducted. Clearly, there is a need for better study design and larger studies to understand more fully the prevalence of 
child and adolescent mental health disorders in Nepal, in order to adequately plan public health services accordingly.

Introduction
Child and adolescent mental disorders are common and 
linked  to  pre-mature  death  and  serious  dysfunction  in 
adult  life  [1].  About  half  of  all  mental  disorders  start  by 
the age of 14 years and three-quarters before the age of 25 
[1, 2]. Worldwide prevalence rates of child and adolescent

mental disorders are around 10–20%, with similar types 
of disorders, such as anxiety disorder, behaviour disorder 
and  mood  disorders  seen  across  cultures  [2].  Nepal  is  a 
low-income  country  with  a  total  population  of  approxi-
mately 20 million, of whom 40% (12 million) are younger 
than  18  years  of  age  [3,  4].  The  Ministry  of  Health  and 
Population of Nepal estimates that about 15–20% of this 
population  (2–3  million)  may  suffer  from  some  form  of 
mental disorder [4, 5].

Mental  health  is  shaped  to  a  great  extent  by  social, 
economic  and  environmental  factors  [6].  Exposure  to  a

range  of  environmental  adversities  increases  the  risk  of 
disorders  in  children  through  the  biological  embedding 
of  environmental  risk.  Poverty,  a  lower  social  position 
in  society,  war  and  exposure  to  violence  in  neighbour-
hoods  have  all  been  shown  to  have  negative  influences 
on the development of child psychopathology [7]. Unfor-
tunately,  many  more  children  and  adolescents  in  Nepal 
are exposed to such factors, and often more so than their 
peers in high income countries. For example, almost half 
(41.6%) of all children in Nepal are living under multidi-
mensional poverty as measured across health, education 
and  living  standards  [8].  Children  from  poorer  back-
grounds  are  likely  to  have  a  greater  exposure  to  child 
labour, exploitation and human trafficking, domestic vio-
lence  and  sexual  abuse  [4,  9–12].  Moreover,  the  chang-
ing family structure due to divorce, separation from joint 
family  to  nuclear  family,  parental  neglect  and  parental 
substance abuse also put children at a higher risk of psy-
chosocial and mental health problems [12].

Natural  disasters  like  earthquakes,  floods,  and  land-
slides are common in Nepal [13, 14]. The massive earth-
quake  of  2015  directly  affected  1.7  million  children  in 
Nepal  [13].  Such  disasters  lead  to  displacements,  disap-
pearances, injuries and death affecting families, children 
and their mental well-being. Despite this, child and ado-
lescent mental health problems and disorders have been 
unacknowledged for many years in Nepal.

Only  recently,  has  there  been  greater  importance 
given  to  identifying  and  treating  mental  disorders  in 
children [4, 5]; however, the magnitude of child and ado-
lescent mental problems in Nepal is still not clear. There 
are  many  reasons  for  this,  including  the  absence  of  a 
child  and  adolescent  mental  health  policy,  poor  child 
and adolescent mental health services (there is only one 
outpatient  child  and  adolescent  mental  health  clinic  in 
the whole country and no inpatient facilities), as well as 
an  acute  shortage  of  child  and  adolescent  psychiatrists 
and  allied  professionals  (only  one  child  and  adolescent 
psychiatrist in the whole country). Furthermore, no spe-
cialized  postgraduate  training  in  child  and  adolescent 
psychiatry  is  available  in  Nepal  and  limited  research  is 
performed  [4,  15–18].  The  Government  of  Nepal  has 
allocated less than 1% of its total health budget for men-
tal  health;  child  and  adolescent  mental  health  services 
receive a negligible portion of this amount [18, 19].

This  paper  aimed  to  provide  an  overview  of  child  and 

adolescent mental health problems in Nepal.

Methodology
This study used a scoping review approach and employed 
the  following  inclusion  criteria:  any  type  of  study 
reporting  on  mental  health  disorders  in  children  and 

adolescents,  conducted  in  Nepal,  published  in  Eng-
lish  or  Nepali.  Two  databases  (PubMed  and  Medline 
were  searched  from  their  inception  to  August  2018, 
using  terms  ‘mental  disorder’,  ‘child  and  adolescent’  and 
‘Nepal’).  Titles  and  abstracts  were  examined  using  the 
inclusion criteria, after which full articles were retrieved.
According  to  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  System-
atic  Review  and  Meta-Analyses  Extension  for  Scoping 
Review  Guideline  (PRISMA-ScR),  the  critical  appraisal 
of the included studies is an optional item [20]. However, 
we  performed  the  critical  appraisal  taking  into  account 
that  it  will  help  to  consider  the  methodological  quality 
of  the  included  studies  while  interpreting  the  findings 
from  those  studies.  For  critical  appraisal,  the  methodo-
logical  quality  assessment  tool  of  the  National  Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Quality Assessment 
Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies, [21] and the Guidelines 
for  evaluating  prevalence  studies  [22]  were  used.  Given 
that,  this  was  a  comprehensive  scoping  review,  and  not 
a  systematic  review,  one  reviewer  performed  the  qual-
ity  assessment,  and  another  co-author  later  confirmed 
it. There were no articles excluded based on the quality 
criteria.

Results
Study selection

The initial online search produced 38 articles. Duplicates 
were removed and this reduced the number of articles to 
28. The titles and abstracts of these 28 studies were then 
reviewed, and 18 were excluded because they were either 
not related to mental health disorders, and/or they were 
not  related  to  mental  health  disorders  in  children  and 
adolescents,  and/or  were  not  conducted  in  Nepal.  As 
such,  10  studies  were  identified  that  met  the  inclusion 
criteria (see Fig. 1).

General description
Most  of  the  studies  (n = 7/10)  were  population  studies 
conducted in the community setting [23–26] and schools 
[27–29].  Most  of  the  studies  were  cross-sectional  in 
nature [23, 25–27] and one was a cross-sectional cohort 
study [24]. The sample size of these studies ranged ranged 
from 126 to 4098 (Tables 1 and 2). 

Critical appraisal within sources of included studies

Only  two  studies  [23,  29]  were  of  good  quality,  six 
remaining being scored as “poor quality” [25, 26, 28, 30–
32] and two were of fair quality [24, 27] (Additional file 1: 
Table S1).

In  terms  of  sampling  method,  only  two  studies  used 
probability-sampling  technique  [23,  29]  while  remain-
ing  eight  used  convenient  sampling  technique  [24–28,

cation,  power  description,  or  variance  and  effect  esti-
mates  [29].  Only  four  studies  used  validated  criteria 
for  data  collection  [23,  24,  27,  28]  The  quality  scores 
of  the  included  studies  are  shown  in  Additional  file  1:

More  information  will  now  be  described  about  each 
of the ten studies, including the screening tool used, the 
prevalence rates reported, and the context of the study.

The Gorkha Earthquake‑Post Traumatic Stress Symptoms 
(PTSS)

Following  the  massive  earthquake,  also  known  as  the 
Gorkha earthquake, in 2015 that directly affected 1.7 mil-
lion children and adolescents, two studies assessed post-
traumatic  stress  symptoms  (PTSS)  among  children  and 
adolescents using the child PTSD symptom scale (CPSS) 
[23, 27]. The CPSS is a psychological screening tool that 
comprises  a  set  of  signs  and  facilitates  the  recognition 
of  PTSS.  One  study  was  conducted  in  the  Kathmandu 
district in a community setting [23] while another study 
was conducted in schools in the Kathmandu and Sindu-
palchowk districts [27]. The rate of PTSS in Kathmandu 
district reported in these two studies was 10.7% [27] and 
51%  [23],  respectively.  The  rate  of  PTSS  in  Sindupal-
chowk district was 39.5% [27].

Former child soldiers‑PTSD symptoms, depression 
and anxiety

One  cohort  study  assessed  mental  health  problems,  i.e. 
symptoms  of  PTSD,  depression  symptoms  and  anxi-
ety  symptoms  among  former  child  soldiers  in  compari-
son with children never conscripted to an armed group. 
The study found that more child soldiers were above the 
cut-off  scores  for  each  mental  health  scale  compared 
with  never  conscripted  children.  PTSD  symptoms  were 
assessed  using  CPSS;  it  was  found  that  the  percentage 
of former child soldiers meeting cut-off scores for PTSD 
symptoms  was  55.3%  (n = 78)  vs.  20%  (n = 28)  among 
never-conscripted  children.  Similarly,  depression  symp-
toms  were  assessed  using  the  Depression  Self  Rating 
Scale (DSRS); 53.2% (n = 75) of former child soldiers vs. 
24.1% (n = 34) of never-conscripted children met the cut-
off  score  for  depression  symptoms.  Anxiety  symptoms 
were assessed using the Screen for Child Anxiety Related 
Emotional  Disorders  (SCARED-5);  the  proportion  of 
children meeting the cut-off score was 46.1% (n = 65) in 
former child soldiers vs. 37.6% (53) in never-conscripted 
children [24].

Children and homelessness—emotional and behavioural 
disorders

One  of  the  studies  assessed  emotional  and  behavioural 
problems  among  homeless  children  and  adolescents 
(n = 126).  This  study  conducted  the  assessment  in  two 
stages. At the first stage, emotional and behavioural prob-
lems  were  assessed  using  the  Child  Behaviour  Checklist 
(CBCL), while in the second stage, a diagnosis was made 
by psychiatrist using DSM-IV-TR criteria The prevalence 
of  emotional  and  behavioural  problems  among  home-
less  children  was  28.57%  (26.31%  in  boys  and  30.43%  in 
girls)  based  on  the  CBCL  and  23.01%  (21.05%  in  boys 
and  24.63%  in  girls)  based  on  the  final  diagnosis.  Anxi-
ety  disorders  were  more  common  in  girls  (13.04%)  than 
boys  (3.5%),  while  conduct  disorders  were  more  com-
mon  among  boys  (8.77%)  than  girls  (4.34%).  Depression 
was present only among girls (7.24% vs. 0%) while ADHD 
(3.5%  vs.  0%)  and  Oppositional  Defiant  Disorder  (5.26% 
vs.  0%)  were  present  only  among  boys  as  assessed  by 
DSM-IV-TR criteria [25].

Community and school‑based studies—autism, emotional 
and behavioural problems and ADHD

Heys et al. translated, adapted and tested the acceptabil-
ity  of  a  Nepali  language  version  of  a  screening  tool  for 
autism  (Autism  Quotient-10).  Using  this  tool,  they  esti-
mated  the  prevalence  of  autism  in  rural  Nepali  children 
aged 9–13 years. Fourteen out of 4098 children scored > 6 
out of 10, indicative of elevated autistic symptomatology,

of  which  13  also  screened  positive  for  disability.  This 
study  estimated  the  prevalence  of  autism  as  being  three 
per 1000 children and adolescents [26].

Two of the ten reviewed studies assessed emotional and 
behavioural  problems  among  school  attending  adoles-
cents  using  the  Paediatric  Symptoms  Checklist  [28,  29]. 
Emotional  and  behavioural  problems  ranged  between 
12.09%  [28]  and  17.03%  [29].  The  rate  of  internalising 
problems  in  one  of  the  school-based  studies  was  44.6%, 
while  that  of  externalising  problems  was  30%.  Attention 
deficit  hyperactivity  problem  was  present  among  25.8% 
of school-attending adolescents [29].

Clinical studies‑autism, emotional and behavioural 
problems and ADHD

Rimal et al. [30] assessed developmental and behavioural 
problems  among  children  in  a  clinical  setting.  Standard 
screening and assessment tools, i.e. the Strength and Dif-
ficulty  Questionnaire  (SDQ),  Spence  anxiety  scale  and 
Vanderbilt rating scale for attention deficit hyperactivity 
problem  were  used.  The  most  common  problems  were 
speech and language delay (22.4%), behavioural problems 
(21.2%),  anxiety  problem  (18.8%)  and  attention  deficit 
hyperactivity problem (10%) [30].

Rimal  et  al.  [31]  also  assessed  the  rate  of  Attention 
Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD)  via  ADHD  rat-
ing  scale  with  diagnostic  criteria  consistent  with  DSM-
IV  classification  and  associated  co-morbidities  among 

school  children.  The  study  found  an  ADHD  prevalence 
of  11.7%.  The  most  common  co-morbidities  were  sleep 
problems  (29.3%),  learning  difficulties  and  anxiety  dis-
orders (24.4% each), oppositional defiant disorder (22%), 
speech delay (14.6%) and autism spectrum disorder (12%) 
[31].

Risal et al. [32] conducted a retrospective study to iden-
tify psychiatric disorders in patients below 18 years of age 
who presented to a psychiatric out-patient unit. The diag-
nosis made by the psychiatric consultant using ICD crite-
ria reported that dissociative disorders (15%) and seizure 
disorders  (15%)  were  the  most  common  diagnoses,  fol-
lowed  by  depressive  disorder  and  intentional  self-harm 
(13.8% each) [32].

Discussion
This paper has provided an overview of child and adoles-
cent  mental  health  problems  in  Nepal.  Only  ten  eligible 
studies were identified. Among these, seven were popula-
tion studies, while three studies assessed clinical samples.
There  is  a  small  but  growing  evidence  base  on  child 
and  adolescent  mental  health  problems  and  disorders 
in  Nepal  [23–32].  Unfortunately,  all  studies  were  rela-
tively  small. The  most  common  mental  health  problems 
assessed  among  children  and  adolescents  of  Nepal  as 
found  in  this  review  are  PTSS  symptoms,  followed  by 
emotional  and  behavioural  problems.  Likewise,  children 
and  adolescents  exposed  to  the  aftermath  of  the  recent

earthquake,  those  involved  in  war,  as  well  as  homeless 
and  school-going  children  are  the  most  well-studied 
groups so far.

The  rate  of  PTSS  symptoms  among  earthquake-
affected  children  and  adolescents  of  the  Kathmandu 
district  reported  in  this  review  varied  greatly  (10.7%  to 
51%).  These  wide  variations  could  be  due  to  differences 
in methodology. The study that reported a higher rate of 
PTSS  was  conducted  among  both  children  and  adoles-
cents  [23],  while  the  study  that  reported  a  lower  preva-
lence assessed only adolescents [27]. Likewise, there was 
difference  in  the  study  settings  in  these  two  studies,  as 
one  of  the  studies  was  a  community-based  study  that 
adopted  multistage  cluster  sampling  and  including  800 
earthquake-affected children and adolescents [23], while 
the  other  was  a  school-based  study  conducted  in  three 
schools and including 440 adolescents [27]. However, the 
prevalence rate of PTSS symptoms (51%) is similar to the 
prevalence rate of 47.7% among children 3 months after 
a major earthquake in Turkey [33] and to the prevalence 
rate  of  44%  among  children  1  year  after  a  major  earth-
quake in China [34].

The  prevalence  of  emotional  and  behavioural  prob-
lems  among  sheltered  homeless  children  was  28.57% 
[25], which is in the range of the rates of 24% to 40% in a 
meta-analysis on mental illness in homeless children [35]. 
Consistent with previous studies, this study showed that 
internalising  problems  are  more  common  in  girls  than 
boys,  and  the  opposite  for  externalising  problems  [35, 
36].

Heys  et  al.  estimated  that  the  prevalence  of  autism 
was 0.3% [26], which is lower compared to the estimated 
prevalence of 1.89% in South Korea [37]. This difference 
might  be  due  to  differences  in  methodology.  The  study 
in Nepal used the AQ-10 screening tool in 4098 children 
and adolescents while the study in South Korea used the 
Autism  Spectrum  Screening  Questionnaire  in  55,266 
children and adolescents.

The  prevalence  of  psychosocial  problems  among  ado-
lescents  in  a  school-based  sample  ranged  from  12.09  to 
17.03%  [28,  29]. This  prevalence  is  similar  to  the  rate  of 
14.3%  found  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa  school  age  children, 
as shown by one the meta-analysis [38].

The prevalence of ADHD in one of the hospital-based 
studies  in  Nepal  was  10%  [30],  which  is  similar  to  the 
rate of 11% among children in a hospital-based study in 
Uganda  [39].  However,  this  is  less  than  the  prevalence 
of  20.3%  among  children  in  a  hospital-based  study  in 
India [40].

The studies included in this review were not free from 
limitations. Only two out of ten studies were rated as of 
good  quality.  Most  of  the  included  studies  were  cross-
sectional  and  descriptive  in  nature,  conducted  with 

small  samples  collected  through  convenient  sampling 
techniques  and  different  settings;  therefore,  the  find-
ings  of  the  study  cannot  be  generalised  to  the  entire 
population  of  children  and  adolescents  of  Nepal.  In 
addition,  most  of  the  screening  tools  used  for  these 
studies  were  not  validated  for  use  in  a  Nepalese  con-
text,  which  might  be  also  be  considered  as  a  threat  to 
both the internal and external validity of the study find-
ings.  Very  few  population  studies  have  studied  men-
tal  health  problems  and  disorder  among  children  and 
adolescents  in  Nepal,  so  this  scoping  review  included 
the  available  clinical  studies  conducted  to  assess  com-
mon mental disorders among children and adolescents 
in  clinical  samples.  Hence,  the  findings  from  clinical 
studies included in this scoping review should be inter-
preted cautiously as they do not provide an estimate of 
actual disease prevalence in the general population.

Strength and limitation of the study

According  to  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  scoping 
review that has provided an overview child and adoles-
cent  mental  health  problems  in  Nepal.  This  study  has 
also  provided  the  quality  assessment  of  the  included 
studies.  However,  the  search  was  limited  to  only  two 
databases for convenience and therefore some relevant 
studies might not have been identified. However, given 
the dearth amount of literature on this important topic, 
these findings remain useful.

Implications of the study

The  findings  of  this  study  have  implications  for  pol-
icy  initiatives  and  service  delivery.  Given  the  context 
of  Nepal  where  there  is  a  lack  of  child  and  adolescent 
mental health plan and policy, the findings of the prev-
alence  of  child  and  adolescent  mental  health  problem 
in  this  study  suggest  that  there  is  a  need  of  child  and 
adolescent  mental  health  policy  and  plan  in  the  coun-
try.  Policy  makers  and  service  delivery  should  explore 
and  implement  evidence-based  approach  for  promot-
ing and protecting child and adolescent mental health. 
They  should  create  a  competitive  mental  health  work-
force that can address the existing child and adolescent 
mental health problems.

Conclusion

1.  The  existing  literature  demonstrates  that  mental 
health  problems  and  disorder  are  common  among 
the  children  and  adolescents  of  Nepal.  However, 
methodological  variations,  poor  quality  and  con-
straints across those studies make it difficult to reach 
firm  conclusions  on  the  true  prevalence  of  mental 
health disorders in children and adolescents in Nepal 

Chaulagain et al. Int J Ment Health Syst           (2019) 13:53

and suggest a huge research gap in the field of child 
and adolescent mental health in the country.

2.  There have been no national level prevalence studies 
on child and adolescent mental health problems and 
disorders in Nepal.

3.  More  research  that  is  robust  is  required  to  assess 
the prevalence of child and adolescent mental health 
problems and disorder.

4.  Future research should use total population or repre-
sentative  sample  and  valid  screening  and  diagnostic 
tool and contribute toward providing the true preva-
lence of different child and adolescents mental health 
problems and disorder in the country.
