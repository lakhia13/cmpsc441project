However, change in the quality of the voice may also
be the first sign of a wide variety of systemic, neurologi-
cal, and structural disorders.2 6 Early and subtle laryngeal
manifestations may be the result of a variety of systemic
illnesses including bacterial, viral, and fungal infection,
rheumatoid
gastro-
oesophageal reflux, and vascular and cardiac disease.2 6
Isolated change in the voice may also indicate early
lower motor neurone disease (for example, Parkinson’s
disease, myasthenia gravis, or benign hereditary “essen-
tial” tremor) or focal upper motor neurone lesions.2 6
Structural lesions on the vibrating edge of the vocal folds
affect their mass, regularity of vibration, and adduction.
These structural changes can be the result of many fac-
tors including voice abuse (vocal nodules, vocal fold
haemorrhage),
papillomatosis),
inflammatory irritants (Reinke’s oedema, contact granu-
lomas), congenital malformation (laryngeal web, laryn-
gomalacia), and malignancy.2 6 7

The science of diagnostic laryngeal or voice patho-
logy has been revolutionised in the past 20 years.2 7 8
Technological advances in laryngeal examination and
vocal function have led to a more precise understand-
ing of the function and dysfunction of the vocal tract.7 8
Fibreoptic endoscopy enables extensive examination
of the laryngeal structures during all types of vocal
activity (for example, speaking, singing, and shouting).
Applying the principles of stroboscopy (a means of
“sampling” images to create the visual illusion of “slow-
ing down” the movement) to the endoscopic examina-
tion allows detailed observation of the membranous
layer of the vocal folds during phonation.2 7 Voice
pathologists use other instrumental and perceptual
techniques to measure a wide range of aspects of voice
production including vocal
frequency, amplitude,
stability, range, regularity, and aerodynamic efficiency.8
These advances in voice clinics and voice laborato-
ries have resulted in greater accuracy of diagnosis and
better selection of treatment.2 7 8 Appreciation of the

extends beyond the primary aim of establishing a his-
tological diagnosis and incorporates a wide variety of
techniques to restore or improve the disordered
voice.2 7 Voice therapy remains the treatment of choice
for most non-organic and some organic voice
pathology.8 9 One achievement of recent research in
voice pathology has been the establishment of level II
evidence to support the efficacy of voice therapy for
the most common disorders.1 9

Despite all of these advances, clinical research in
voice pathology still remains in its infancy. The tools of
diagnosis and functional measurement are now ready
for rigorous application to the clinical field.8 For exam-
ple, the impact of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease,
illness on voice
inhalatory steroids, and mental
disorders are largely unknown.2 6 Equally, the tech-
niques of differential diagnosis for less common disor-
ders such as laryngeal dystonia, superior laryngeal
nerve paralysis, and organic tremor remain controver-
sial.2 6 Furthermore, the pathophysiology of laryngeal
disorders such as papillomatosis, polypoidal degenera-
tion, and paradoxical vocal fold movement are poorly
understood.2 6 The efficacy of surgical techniques to
improve voice quality (phonosurgery) remains largely
unevaluated.8 Clinical research needs to complement
the growth in clinical services. Several postgraduate
specialist
research degrees now exist, and some
doctoral students with a clinical background are being
attracted into the field. Hopefully with an appropriate
in
academic infrastructure in place these issues
research in voice pathology will begin to be addressed.

Social anxiety disorder

social anxiety disorder

T he hallmark of

is
extreme and persistent fear of embarrassment
and humiliation.1 People with this condition
(which is also known as social phobia) often avoid par-
ticipating in social and public activities, such as public
speaking, social gatherings, or meetings. Whereas nor-
mative social anxiety may serve to focus attention and
prevent inappropriate behaviour, the intense symp-

toms of social anxiety disorder, by definition, interfere
with functioning or cause marked distress.

Differentiation of social anxiety disorder from
other phobic disorders was first validated by its charac-
teristic age of onset in the mid-teens and greater ratio
of men to women.2 Although once believed to be
uncommon, social anxiety disorder was found to be the
third most prevalent psychiatric disorder in the US

national comorbidity survey,3 and most studies in
Europe and North America have found a 7-12%
lifetime prevalence in the community and higher rates
in primary care samples.4

Despite increasing recognition of social anxiety
disorder as common, impairing, yet treatable, it often
remains undiagnosed.4 The reticence and shame that
are intrinsic to social anxiety disorder inhibit help
seeking. Persons usually come for treatment only after
years of suffering and may present initially with a com-
plication, such as major depression or alcohol abuse.
Clinicians can encourage patients to discuss their
symptoms by including a brief query into social anxiety
or avoidance in a review of systems assessment.

In feared situations, patients with social anxiety dis-
order typically experience self consciousness, embar-
rassment, and difficulty speaking. Autonomic arousal
symptoms, such as blushing, sweating, trembling, and
palpitations, are sometimes prominent. Thoughts
often dwell on inferiority to others, desire to flee, and
anticipated negative evaluation by others. Weeks of
anticipatory anxiety may precede a social event, with
self deprecating thoughts and demoralisation in its
aftermath.

Persons with the generalised subtype of social
social
anxiety disorder, defined by fear of most
situations,1 are most
likely to seek
treatment, and have been studied most in clinical trials.5
Patients with the non-generalised form are typically
comfortable in informal social settings but experience
distressing or impairing anxiety attacks during public
speaking or performance.1 The anxiety related symp-
toms of social anxiety disorder may take the form of a

to social cues. With its trait-like early onset, pervasive-
ness, and high chronicity, social anxiety disorder may be

the pathologically
extreme form of the continuum of social anxiety present
in the community.

conceptualised as

The best established treatments for social anxiety
disorder are cognitive behaviour therapy and sero-
tonin reuptake inhibitors. Cognitive behaviour therapy
addresses a dysfunctional cycle in which avoidance of
feared situations diminishes opportunities for social
growth and reinforces fears, which in turn lead to fur-
ther avoidance. The therapist works in the here and
now to help the patient identify fears and avoidance,
develop more productive coping thoughts and behav-
iours, and systematically confront feared situations
while using new coping techniques. Controlled studies
show clinical
improvement over 12-16 weekly ses-
sions,6 with gains usually persisting after discontinua-
tion of therapy.7

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the best
established drug treatment for social anxiety disorder,
with controlled trials showing efficacy for paroxetine,
sertraline, and fluvoxamine.8 Doses typically used for
depression seem adequate, but many patients will
require a longer 12 week trial to establish clear out-
come. Drug treatment should continue for 6-12 months
after response, and some patients may require longer
treatment to maintain gains.7 Alternative drugs include
the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine, which has
been shown to be effective in several controlled trials but
is usually reserved for patients who do not respond to

other treatment. This is due to the need for dietary
restrictions and risk of hypertensive reaction.6 The
newer
inhibitor
moclobemide has seemed effective for social anxiety
disorder in some but not all controlled trials.9 The
benzodiazapines clonazepam and bromazepam and
novel anticonvulsant gabapentin have been shown to be
efficacious in single controlled trials. (cid:1) adrenergic block-
ers have not differed from placebo in efficacy for
treatment of generalised social anxiety disorder, but they
seem to be useful taken on an as-needed basis in
treatment of the non-generalised subtype. No Cochrane
reviews of social anxiety disorder have been undertaken.
Twin and family studies show substantial genetic
and environmental contributions to social anxiety dis-
order.10 Studies of toddlers exposed to novel stimuli
have suggested that behavioural
inhibition coupled
with autonomic reactivity characterise a relatively

social anxiety in adolescence.11 Parenting that
is
overprotective yet critical may contribute to the devel-
opment of
in vulnerable
children. Several neurotransmitter systems, including
dopamine and serotonin, manifest differences in social
anxiety disorder, and subcortical fear circuitry involv-
ing activation of the amygdala may be hypersensitive
and easily conditioned to social stimuli.12

social anxiety disorder

As social anxiety disorder has gained recognition
as a common, impairing, and treatable condition, more
attention has focused on improving detection of
serious cases in the community. Earlier identification of
symptomatic individuals holds promise for prevention
of long term dysfunction and complications.
