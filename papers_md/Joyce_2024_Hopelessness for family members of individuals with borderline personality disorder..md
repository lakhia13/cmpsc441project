Abstract
Family  members  and  loved  ones  of  individuals  with 
Borderline  Personality  Disorder  (BPD)  can  experience 
high levels of distress. Types of distress reported by fam-
ily members include burden, grief, depression, guilt, and 
powerlessness.  Hopelessness  is  a  construct  that  has  re-
ceived little attention despite its potential relevance for this 
group. This study sought to examine, and assess potential 
change  in,  hopelessness  among  individuals  attending  a 
12- week Family Connections (FC) program. Participants 
were 75 family members, 29 men and 46 women. Most par-
ticipants  were  parents  (n = 43;  57%).  Data  were  collected 
at four time- points and outcomes included hopelessness, 
burden,  and  grief.  The  majority  of  participants  (82%) 
reported  scores  within  the  ‘minimal’  or  ‘mild’  ranges  of 
hopelessness  before  the  FC  program.  A  greater  propor-
tion of participants in the 60–70 year age group reported 
scores in the ‘moderate/severe’ category when compared 
with younger age groups. The mean hopelessness score for 
all  participants  before  FC  was  4.61  which  is  considered 
mild. There was no significant difference in hopelessness 
scores after program completion. Although mean scores 
increased at both 3- month and 12- month follow- ups, they 
continued to remain in the ‘mild’ category. Hopelessness 
scores in the current study are similar to those reported 
in  previous  studies,  although  no  significant  change  was 
found after FC completion. Concepts of personal vs. situ-
ational hopelessness should be considered, as well as the 
relevance of assessing personal hopelessness for this par-
ticipant  group.  Further  research  is  needed  to  determine 
the relationship between family member hopelessness and 
index client wellbeing.

borderline personality disorder, family connections, family members, 
hopelessness, significant others

Borderline  Personality  Disorder  (BPD)  is  a  mental  health  diagnosis  characterized  by  a  per-
vasive  pattern  of  instability  in  interpersonal  relationships,  self- image,  affect,  and  marked 
impulsivity (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). BPD typically features patterns of cog-
nitive, emotional, and behavioral dysregulation that often manifest in self- harm and suicidal 
behavior (Koerner et al., 2020; Kuo et al., 2006). BPD is challenging both for individuals who 
experience these difficulties and for family members/significant others. Family members of in-
dividuals with BPD commonly report feeling overwhelmed and traumatized by the behaviors 
that frequently accompany BPD such as suicide attempts, intense anger, and self- injury, which 
result  in  highly  stressful  and  chaotic  situations  for  the  person  with  BPD  and  their  families 
(Hoffman et al., 2007).

Previous research has found that family members of individuals with BPD experience higher 
levels of psychological and somatic distress than the general population (Scheirs & Bok, 2007). 
Carers of young people with BPD features have reported elevated levels of distress and higher 
levels of negative experiences related to their caregiving role when compared with general pop-
ulation adults or carers of young people with other serious illnesses such as eating disorders 
or psychosis (Cotton et al., 2022; Seigerman et al., 2020). Types of distress reported by family 
members include burden, grief, depression, guilt, and powerlessness (Bailey & Grenyer, 2014; 
Ekdahl  et  al.,  2011;  Hoffman  et  al.,  2005).  A  systematic  review  which  examined  the  experi-
ence  of  carers  of  individuals  with  personality  disorder  reported  elevated  burden,  grief,  im-
paired empowerment, and mental health problems including depression and anxiety (Bailey & 
Grenyer, 2013). Five out of the six studies in that review focused on carers of individuals with 
BPD, making the findings particularly relevant to the current study.

Hopelessness has also been identified as a potentially relevant construct for family members of 
individuals with BPD. The distinctive characteristics of BPD, such as intense emotion dysregula-
tion and interpersonal conflict, provide a basis for understanding why caregivers of individuals 
with BPD may experience heightened levels of hopelessness. Hopelessness was first examined in 
this population in a study by Hoffman and colleagues whereby the relationship between family 
members' knowledge about BPD and levels of burden, depression, and hopelessness was assessed 
(Hoffman et al., 2003). It was found that more knowledgeable family members reported greater 
feelings of hopelessness, though overall as a group, participants reported a mean score within the 
‘mild’ category of severity on the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). A later qualitative study with 
family members found that prolonged hopelessness was one of five key areas identified as central 
to life with their relative (Buteau et al., 2008). Multiple failed attempts at treatment, unsatisfac-
tory  support  systems,  and  both  emotional  and  financial  exhaustion  were  noted  as  reasons  for 
family members' despair that their life and the lives of their ill relative may never improve (Buteau 
et al., 2008). The possibility that hopelessness could be a relevant construct for this population 
was also raised in an interventional study by our research group when anecdotal evidence from 
family members led us to consider that hopelessness may be a relevant construct worthy of further 
investigation (Flynn et al., 2017). It was also found that depression scores among family members 
in  that  study  were  lower  than  those  reported  in  earlier  similar  studies  conducted  by  Hoffman 
et al. (2005, 2007). We hypothesized that cultural variance in attitudes towards depression in an 
Irish context may have influenced individuals' responses, and that hopelessness might be a more 
meaningful construct to investigate in this population, as well as being a potentially more socially 
acceptable one to endorse. Most recently, a phenomenological study examining the experiences 
of caregivers of individuals diagnosed with BPD found that emotional distress including hope-
lessness  impacted  various  aspects  of  the  caregiver's  life  and  functioning  including  their  physi-
cal health and ability to focus on work (Meshkinyazd et al., 2020). Participants also expressed 

FAMILY PROCESS 
 
|  2137

concerns about the negative stigmatization in society associated with a BPD diagnosis, leading to 
further feelings of shame and hopelessness.

Despite its potential relevance, hopelessness has received little attention in studies involving 
family members of individuals with BPD. A recent systematic review of interventions for family 
members and carers of individuals with BPD (Guillén et al., 2020) lists hopelessness as an outcome 
measure in only one of 11 studies. That study, by Miller and Skerven (2017), evaluated a family- 
oriented Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) program called Family Skills, in which participants 
reported a mean hopelessness score within the ‘mild’ category of severity at pre- treatment. The 
majority of participants (63%) reported scores within the lowest category of severity (‘minimal’). 
A reduction in hopelessness scores was reported at post- treatment and there was an increase in 
the proportion of participants scoring within the ‘minimal’ category (72%). Clinical significance 
of the statistical change was investigated but most participants were unclassifiable due to having 
scores within what the authors describe as a ‘functional’ range at pre- treatment.

While these studies demonstrate the impact that caring for a loved one with BPD can have on 
family members, there is a lack of support programs available for this group. This contrasts with 
family programs developed for relatives of individuals with psychiatric disorders other than BPD, 
which have taken a valued role in treatment settings (Hoffman et al., 2005). Family Connections 
(FC) was the first education and support program to be designed specifically for family members 
who have a relative with BPD (Hoffman et al., 2007). FC is a 12- week manualized skills training 
and support program designed to meet the needs of family members by providing: (a) education 
about BPD and family functioning, (b) individual and family skills to help with managing one's 
own negative reactions, and building better and more satisfying relationships, and (c) social sup-
port from other group members who have lived through similar experiences and are living with 
similar scenarios (Hoffman & Fruzzetti, 2007). FC is the most researched program for family 
members of individuals with BPD (Guillén et al., 2020, 2022) with studies reporting reductions in 
burden, grief, and depression, and increases in personal mastery (Flynn et al., 2017).

While FC does not explicitly target hopelessness, there is a clinical rationale for anticipat-
ing that each of the three foci of FC would decrease hopelessness. Through the provision of 
up- to- date and accurate psychoeducation about BPD, it is likely that inaccurate myths about 
the  prognosis  of  BPD  would  be  dispelled.  This  may  help  to  instil  hope  of  recovery  among 
the  family  members'  relative  with  BPD.  FC  also  teaches  family  members  mini  DBT  skills. 
In  the  practical  application  of  these  skills,  family  members  may  then  be  able  to  change  the 
course of interpersonal interactions with their loved one with BPD, thus moving the relation-
ship transactions in a healthier direction. As healthier transactions develop, family member 
hopelessness may decrease. Finally, FC attempts to foster support among participants. The 
unique support which participants frequently report they receive through FC fosters a sense 
of authentic validation. This validation from other participants can help family members to 
become more emotionally regulated and subsequently improve their own capacity for interper-
sonal problem- solving. This can set the context for family members becoming more hopeful.

As there has been minimal research on hopelessness in family members of individuals with 
BPD,  and  no  FC  study  that  has  included  a  measure  of  hopelessness,  we  sought  to  examine 
levels  of  hopelessness  among  individuals  attending  a  FC  program.  We  also  aimed  to  assess 
potential change in hopelessness scores from pre-  to post- FC, as well as at two follow- up time- 
points up to 12- month post program completion.

health service in Ireland between February 2014 and January 2019. All FC programs were de-
livered in- person. Family members had to be 18 years or older to participate in FC. Attendees 
were primarily nominated by their relative/significant other with BPD (the index client) who 
was engaged with the community mental health service within which the study was conducted. 
One or more family members could be nominated for the FC program. The FC programs were 
facilitated by two clinician leaders trained in FC, and where feasible, a family member who 
had completed FC Leader Training as well.

Participants

Participants recruited for this study were attendees at the six cohorts of the FC program in 
Cork,  Ireland  during  the  timeframe  outlined  above.  They  were  a  family  member,  or  a  sig-
nificant other, of individuals with severe emotion and behavior dysregulation who may have 
received a diagnosis of BPD (for clarity, the family member experiencing emotion and behavior 
dysregulation will be referred to as the index client). A total of 75 participants consented to 
participate, ranging in age from 22 to 70 years, with more than half aged 40–59 years. They 
are comprised of family members (parents, children, or siblings) and other significant people 
in their lives (spouses, partners, or friends). The majority of participants (57%) were parents. 
Demographic information of participants is provided in Table 1.

Measures

The measures used in this study were the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Burden Assessment 
Scale, the Grief Assessment Scale, the Personal Mastery Scale, and the Revised Centre of 
Epidemiologic  Studies  Depression  Scale.  All  are  self- report  questionnaires.  They  are  in 
line with previous research on FC (e.g., Hoffman et al., 2005, 2007), with the addition of 
the Beck Hopelessness Scale. Outcome measures mostly matched those utilized in previous 

FAMILY PROCESS 
 
|  2139

FC studies to allow for comparison across studies. The listed measures (except for the BHS) 
were  originally  selected  by  the  FC  developers  as  they  were  commonly  used  measures  in 
the schizophrenia caregiver research (Hoffman et al., 2007). This consistency has allowed 
comparisons across caregiver groups. The current study added a measure of hopelessness, 
prompted  by  the  anecdotal  information  about  the  relevance  of  this  construct  noted  by 
Flynn et al. (2017).

The Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS; Beck & Steer, 1988) is a 20- item scale that measures 
participant's levels of hopelessness. Scores range from 0 to 20 and are categorized according to 
four levels of severity (Minimal: 0–3; Mild: 4–8; Moderate: 9–14; and Severe: 15–20). The scale 
demonstrated good internal reliability in this study (α = 0.91).

The Burden Assessment Scale (BAS; Reinhard et al., 1994) was used to measure the con-
struct of burden, which measures subjective and objective burden. The internal reliability of 
the BAS subscales in this study was 0.89 for objective burden and 0.86 for subjective burden.

The Grief Assessment Scale (GAS; Struening et al., 1995) is a 15- item scale that measures 
an  individual's  current  feelings  of  grief.  The  scale  demonstrated  good  internal  reliability 
(α = 0.94).

The Personal Mastery Scale (PMS; Pearlin et al., 1981) is a 7- item scale that measures partic-
ipants perceived level of coping. The scale demonstrated good internal reliability in the current 
study (α = 0.76).

The Revised Centre of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES- D; Radloff, 1977) is a 
20- item scale that measures individuals' levels of depressive symptoms experienced. The scale 
demonstrated good internal reliability in this study (α = 0.90).

Participants were also asked the following questions about their relative/ significant other 
(index client): the frequency of contact on a weekly basis; the timeframe of their BPD diagnosis 
(if applicable); what kind of treatment, if any, the index client was receiving; and the length of 
time the index client had been receiving treatment.

Procedure

All individuals who participated in FC programs in Cork, Ireland between February 2014 and 
January 2019 were invited to participate in this study. Individuals were invited to participate 
in the research study either prior to or during the first session of the FC program. Potential 
participants were briefed on the details of the study and provided with information leaflets. 
Written informed consent was obtained for those who opted into the study. Participants com-
pleted the pre- program questionnaires during the first session of the FC program or within the 
first 2 weeks of the program start date if completing the questionnaires at home. At time- point 
2, participants completed the questionnaires in the final session of FC or within 2 weeks of pro-
gram completion. There were two follow- up data collection time- points for participants who 
completed  FC:  3 months  and  12 months  after  program  completion.  At  both  follow- up  time- 
points, participants were contacted by telephone. Where participants were willing to continue 
to participate, address details were obtained so that the questionnaires could be sent via post 
for completion at home. Participants were asked to return the completed questionnaires within 
a week of receiving them using the prepaid envelope provided.

Data analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data at each time- point and outcome meas-
ures were summarized by their mean and standard deviation. T- tests and analyses of variance 
were used to assess sex, age and relationship type differences in the baseline outcome measures.

Linear mixed- effects models were used to assess differences in the outcome measures from 
pre-  to post- FC. Linear mixed- effects models utilizes all available data at each time- point, ir-
respective of missing data for participants at different time- points. Pearson product- moment 
correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the relationship between constructs. IBM 
SPSS Versions 27 and 28 and Stata Version 15 for Windows were used to analyze the data.

Ethics approval and consent to participate

All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the 
Cork Teaching Hospitals. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Figure 1 provides the timeline of FC programs and number of participants in each cohort, as 
well as the flowchart of participants. Forty- nine of 75 participants completed FC. The pro-
gram drop- out rate was 35%.1 Reasons for drop- out included work schedule conflicts, family 
commitments such as childcare, and  participants' family member (index  client)  disengaging 
from their treatment program. On some occasions, particularly when drop- out happened early 
in the program, the reason for drop- out was unknown.

Of the 75 participants who took part in this study, 73 participants completed questionnaires 
at time- point 1. There were incomplete or ambiguous answers on the BHS for a further two 
participants resulting in available data for 71 participants at time- point 1. Descriptive statistics 
for the BHS for those 71 participants are presented in Table 2.

The mean score for all participants at the beginning of FC was 4.61 which is in the ‘mild’ 
category. Most participants (82%) scored in the ‘minimal’ or ‘mild’ categories of hopelessness 
prior to FC.

Descriptive statistics for hopelessness scores according to demographic variables and other 
potential related factors such as timeline of the index client's diagnosis are outlined in Table 3. 
The proportion of participants reporting hopelessness scores in the ‘moderate/severe’ category 
at pre- FC was similar for men and women. A greater proportion of those in the 60–70 year 
group reported scores in the ‘moderate/severe’ category when compared with other age groups. 
In terms of the type of relationship to the index client, only parents and spouses/partners re-
ported scores in the ‘moderate/severe’ category.

Of the 49 participants who completed FC, data were available at both pre-  and post- FC pro-
gram for 46. As there was variation in hopelessness scores within the sample at pre- FC, and scores 
from participants who dropped out could alter results, descriptive statistics for participants who 
completed FC only are provided in Table 4. For participants who completed FC, the mean hope-
lessness score at the beginning of FC was 4.85 which is in the ‘mild’ category. The mean score at 
post- FC reduced to 4.58 but remained within the same category of severity. Most participants 
(78%) reported scores in the ‘minimal’ or ‘mild’ categories of hopelessness at the beginning of 
FC. This was similar at the end of the FC program (76%). Although the number of participants 
reporting scores in the ‘severe’ category at pre- FC was low (n = 4), this reduced to two participants 
at post- FC. Data were available for 34 participants at 3- month follow- up and 22 participants at 
12- month follow- up. Although mean scores increased at both 3- month and 12- month follow- up, 
they continued to remain in the ‘mild’ category. The proportion of participants reporting scores 
in the ‘moderate’ and ‘severe’ categories of hopelessness was largest at 12- month follow- up.

 1As all individuals who participated in the FC program took part in the research study, drop- out rates for FC and the study are the 
same.

*p < 0.001.

Women reported higher scores than men on all measures except for personal mastery. T- 
tests were conducted to explore the observed sex differences and found significantly higher 
levels of total burden (t (70) = −1.98, p < 0.05) and grief (t (71) = −2.19, p < 0.05) for women 
in comparison to men. There was a medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.49 and 0.53 for bur-
den and grief respectively). Mean scores varied across outcome measures according to age 
group and relationship to index client (Table 5). One- way between- group analyses of vari-
ance  found  a  significant  difference  in  personal  mastery  scores  (F  (4,  68) = 2.68,  p = 0.04) 
and hopelessness scores (F (4, 66) = 2.60, p = 0.04) across age groups. Post- hoc comparisons 
using the Tukey HSD test indicated that 60–70- year- olds reported significantly lower per-
sonal mastery scores (M = 17.77, SD = 3.44) when compared with 40–49 year olds (M = 21.55, 
SD = 3.58).  The  observed  difference  in  hopelessness  scores  between  60–70- year- olds 
(M = 7.61,  SD = 5.82)  and  40–49- year- olds  (M = 3.10,  SD = 3.95)  approached  significance. 
The effect sizes were large (eta squared = 0.14). There were no differences in scores accord-
ing to index client relationship.

Linear mixed- effects models were used to estimate the mean at pre- FC and the mean change 
from pre-  to post- FC. Mean scores were estimated as adjustments were made for sex and age. 
Significant differences were found from pre-  to post- FC for objective burden, subjective bur-
den, total burden, grief, and depression (Table 6).

The  relationship  between  the  constructs  examined  in  this  study  was  also  investigated. 
Pearson product–moment correlation coefficients were obtained and are presented in Table 7. 
There was a strong, positive correlation between hopelessness and depression with higher lev-
els of hopelessness associated with higher levels of depression. A strong, negative correlation 
was  found  between  hopelessness  and  personal  mastery  where  higher  levels  of  hopelessness 
were associated with lower levels of mastery. There were medium correlations between hope-
lessness and burden and grief.

DI SC US SION

The main aim of this study was to examine levels of hopelessness in family members attending 
a FC program and to assess potential change in scores from pre- to post- FC, and at two follow-
 up time- points. We found that most participants reported either ‘minimal’ or ‘mild’ levels of 
hopelessness prior to participating in FC. Participants who reported scores in the ‘moderate’ 
or ‘severe’ categories were either parents or spouses/partners. When examined by age group, a

greater proportion of those aged 60–70 years reported scores in the ‘moderate/ severe’ category 
in comparison to younger age groups. For participants who completed FC, mean hopelessness 
scores at post- FC were similar to that reported at pre- FC and remained within the same cat-
egory of severity (mild). Significant reductions were noted from pre-  to post- FC on measures 
of burden, grief, and depression.

This study was partially prompted by the hypothesis that a sample of family members and 
significant others of those with severe emotion and behavior dysregulation in an Irish health 
service setting, who may have received a diagnosis of BPD, may experience significant levels 
of hopelessness. While this hypothesis was derived from clinical observations as well as from 
previous studies in the area (Buteau et al., 2008; Flynn et al., 2017), it was not upheld by the 
data. A ‘mild’ level of hopelessness was reported at pre- FC. It was further hypothesized that 
hopelessness levels may be impacted by participation in the FC program. However, partici-
pants remained within the same category of hopelessness  at  post- FC and at both follow- up 
time- points. It is possible that hopelessness of family members in relation to their loved one 
with BPD may need to be conceptualized or measured differently. The BHS measures personal 
hopelessness.  This  is  distinct  from  situational  hopelessness.  The  strong  correlation  between 
hopelessness and depression in this study provides a further indication that levels of personal 
hopelessness are being assessed by the BHS. Perhaps family members experience hopelessness 
in relation to their loved one's suffering which is not captured by the BHS, and this warrants 
further consideration.

Sex of participants did not appear to impact hopelessness scores. However, both age and 
family relative type appeared to have some bearing on levels of hopelessness. Participants in 
older age groups tended to have higher hopelessness scores. This may be related to having a 
longer- lived experience of observing their loved one suffer from chronic emotion and behavior 
dysregulation. In terms of family member type, parents and partners tended to have higher 
hopelessness scores than friends or other family members. None of the participants who were 
siblings, friends, or adult children of those with BPD scored above 9 on the BHS. It's possible 
that parents and partners are more closely and directly involved in the individual's life, and 
that their higher hopelessness scores may reflect the interconnectedness and reciprocity of in-
dividual functioning and family functioning. It is worth considering that with a larger sample 
size, these observations may have been significant.

The findings from this study are in contrast to Miller and Skerven (2017) who found their 
family- oriented  DBT  skills- based  program  led  to  a  decrease  in  hopelessness  levels  over  the 
course of the program. It is unclear why there was a decrease in hopelessness scores following 
participation in Miller and Skerven's DBT skills- based program but not in FC. It is noteworthy 
though that the sample sizes in both Miller and Skerven's study and the current study were 
relatively small so the findings may be sensitive to large changes by individual participants. As 
an example of this, Miller and Skerven highlight that the magnitude of change on the BHS for

two participants was notable where one participant obtained a BHS score of 19 at pretreatment 
and a 0 at posttreatment while the other obtained a score of 12 at pretreatment and a score 
of 4 at posttreatment. Large changes in scores for individual participants in a small sample 
may  overinflate  the  results  so  caution  should  be  exercised  when  interpreting  the  results  of 
both studies. In the first study of hopelessness by Hoffman et al. (2003), more knowledgeable 
family members reported greater hopelessness. Those findings would suggest that there may 
be no change or indeed an increase in hopelessness scores following a support program that in-
cludes psychoeducation about BPD. It is also possible however that the significant advances in 
evidence- based interventions for individuals with severe emotion and behavior dysregulation 
in the past 20 years since Hoffman et al.'s study have changed the direction of the relationship 
between knowledge about this presentation and hope.

It is plausible that many of the skills taught in FC have the capacity to impact hopelessness, 
either directly or indirectly. From a clinical perspective, relationship mindfulness, radical ac-
ceptance, and opposite to emotion action could be helpful to this end. When considering the 
lack of change in hopelessness scores from pre-  to post- FC, perhaps participants didn't get to 
a place of skills generalization where readily drawing on these skills in complex circumstances 
was possible. However, it is more likely that the controlling variables for hopelessness in family 
members lie outside of FC, and that it is closely connected with index client outcomes or other 
factors in their lives. Research linking family member outcomes with outcomes for the index 
client are necessary to illuminate this further.

It is possible that the minimal levels of hopelessness in our sample is linked with factors 
associated  with  the  timing  and  stage  of  treatment  of  their  family  member.  The  majority  of 
participants in this study had family members who had recently completed DBT, who were 
actively availing of DBT at the time, or who were on a waitlist for DBT. It is unknown if fam-
ily members whose loved one is not engaged with or referred to an evidence- based treatment 
might experience higher levels of hopelessness.

This study advances the understanding of hopelessness in family members of individuals 
with  BPD.  While  earlier  studies  initially  drew  attention  to  the  possible  importance  of  this 
construct (e.g., Buteau et al., 2008; Hoffman et al., 2003), this was the first study specifically 
designed  to  quantitatively  analyze  the  hopelessness  construct  with  this  group  and  to  study 
its trajectory before and after a FC program and at follow- up. Recommendations for future 
research which may further enhance our understanding of hopelessness for family members 
are outlined later.

The inclusion of outcome measures used in previous FC studies allowed us to identify if the 
profile of participants in this study was similar to that of participants in previous research. 
The results showed that participants' levels of grief and burden at baseline were similar to that 
reported by Hoffman et al. (2005, 2007). These findings lend evidence to suggest that the pro-
file of participants across studies was similar.

A limitation of this study is that it was a quasi- experimental study without randomization or 
a control group. Future research to further investigate hopelessness in family members should 
include a randomized design so the potential impact of the FC program on hopelessness scores 
can  be  further  examined.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  while  the  linear  mixed- effects  model 
utilized data collected at each time- point to examine the treatment effect on all outcome mea-
sures, the descriptive analyses conducted on the BHS were conducted only with participants 
who completed the program. This was done in an effort to accurately represent participants' 
trajectories regarding hopelessness over the course of the program. In doing so, however, the 
number of participants for whom comprehensive findings on the BHS were available is small.
While  we  descriptively  explored  hopelessness  scores  in  relation  to  whether  participants 
loved one was in treatment, as well as how far along in their treatment program they were, we 
commenced gathering this information later in our overall data collection. A limitation of this 
study is that we did not have sufficient power to examine the possibility that participants who

| 

may not have a loved one engaged with treatment may report higher levels of hopelessness. It 
will be important in future research to examine hopelessness of caregivers and the potential 
relationship to the degree of recovery of their loved one in treatment. However, it is still worth 
considering the possibility that minimal levels of hopelessness may be indicating that family 
members were only marginally affected by their living experiences with their loved one who 
experience emotion and behavior dysregulation.

A limitation of this study is not recording whether participants and their family member 
with BPD were living together. Although information on the frequency of contact with par-
ticipants' family member with BPD was captured, Miller and Skerven (2017) noted that the 
experience  of  living  with  a  family  member  with  BPD  may  have  different  effects  on  family 
members depending on factors such as severity of BPD or BPD- related behaviors, family mem-
bers' resilience factors and social support. It would be important in future research to gather 
information on living arrangements, as well as the listed factors, to provide further contextual 
information for participant scores on outcome measures.

In  this  study,  family  members  were  typically  nominated  for  FC  by  the  index  client  with 
BPD. This is different from the typical international protocol for accessing FC where family 
members access the program via the National Education Alliance for Borderline Personality 
Disorder (NEABPD) and is independent of their loved one accessing mental health services. In 
addition, most of our sample (77%) reported daily contact with their loved one with BPD. We 
do not know if daily contact is related to hopelessness, but it may be useful for further research 
to investigate this. It would also be relevant to examine hopelessness for individuals who access 
FC independent of their family with BPD and to compare their outcomes with those who are 
nominated by their family member.

It is also possible that family members opting into a support program such as FC may al-
ready be open to the possibility of change and may be more hopeful than those who opt not 
to attend. Future research might explore levels of hopelessness in family members/ significant 
others who engage in a support program such as FC with those who decide not to.

At this point, the mechanisms of change in FC have not yet been investigated. Study of the 
same, in due course, will inform our thinking about the potential for FC to impact hopelessness.
Contrary to clinical observations and previous research, this study found family members/
significant others of individuals with BPD reported minimal levels of hopelessness. Further 
research focusing on situational hopelessness needs to be conducted before any firm conclu-
sions can be drawn in relation to levels of hopelessness in this population. Older participants, 
parents,  and  partners  reported  higher  levels  of  hopelessness.  Further  research  with  larger 
numbers would allow a more detailed exploration of these factors. It is also recommended that 
future larger scale research would further address the relationship between hopelessness and 
demographic and treatment factors outlined.
