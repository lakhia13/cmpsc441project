Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition that affects a person’s ability to socialize and communicate with others. People with ASD can also present with restricted and/or repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities. The term “spectrum” refers to the degree in which the symptoms, behaviors and severity vary within and between individuals. Some people are mildly impaired by their symptoms, while others are severely disabled.

Based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suveillance, an average of1 in every 598-year-old children in the U.S. have ASD. Boys arefour timesmore likely than girls to develop symptoms of ASD. Children across across demographic and socioeconomic groups experience ASD. Awareness  and improved screening methods have contributed to the increase in diagnoses in recent years.

For most, symptoms of ASD often start to appear during the first three years of life (though a small percentage of people might not receive a diagnosis until later in life). Typically, developing infants are social by nature. They gaze at faces, turn toward voices, grasp a finger and even smile by 2-3 months of age. Most children who develop autism have difficulty engaging in everyday human interactions.

Not everyone will experience symptoms with the same severity, but most people with ASD will have symptoms that affect social interactions and relationships. ASD can also causes difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication and preoccupation with certain activities. Along with different interests, children with ASD generally have different ways of interacting with others. Parents are often the first to notice that their child is showing unusual behaviors. These behaviors can include failing to make eye contact, not responding to his or her name or playing with toys in unusual, repetitive ways.

Symptoms of autism can include impairments to social interaction & communication, and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. More specific symptoms are outlined below:

The learning, thinking and problem-solving abilities of people with ASD can range from gifted to severely challenged. Some people with ASD need a lot of help in their daily lives. With a thorough evaluation, doctors can make a diagnosis to help find the best treatment plan.

Scientists have not discovered a single cause of autism. They believe several factors may contribute to this developmental disorder.

There is no medical test that can determine the possibility of developing autism. Specialists make the diagnosis after screening for social and communication difficulties, and repetitive or restricted behaviors.

Diagnosing autism is often a 2-stage process. The first stage involves general developmental screening during well-child checkups with a pediatrician. Children who show some developmental problems are referred for more evaluation. The second stage involves a thorough evaluation by a team of doctors and other health professionals with a wide range of specialties. At this stage, a child may be diagnosed as having autism or another developmental disorder. Typically, children with ASD can be reliably diagnosed by age two, though some may not be diagnosed until they are older.

Types Of ASD Screening InstrumentsSometimes the doctor will ask parents questions about the child’s symptoms to screen for autism. Other screening instruments combine information from parents with the doctor’s own observations of the child. Examples of screening instruments for toddlers and preschoolers include:

For more information on these screening tools, please visit theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

Given that ASD is a developmental condition that begins early in life, having a cascading effect on developmental milestones, there is no known cure. But there is effective treatment available. Treatment options include:

A child with autism may have co-morbid disorders. Some of those disorders are:

Treatment plans for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are tailored to each person’s unique needs. These can consist of medications, therapy or both. Many therapists work closely with autistic individuals using a variety of therapies to help increase social and communication skills.

Educational and behavioral approaches are often a main feature of the overall treatment plan for children. Most health care professionals will implement an early intensive behavioral intervention, involving the child’s entire family in education and training. In some early intervention programs, therapists come into the home to deliver services. Other programs deliver therapy in a specialized center, classroom or preschool. Types of therapy may include:

Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA).ABA is one of the most researched behavioral therapies for autism. It teaches children positive behavior while discouraging the negative. A child, for example, may be directed to hand his therapist a pencil. If he does, he will receive a reward, such as praise or a small toy. If he doesn’t, he will receive a prompt, such as the therapist moving his hand to the pencil.

Floor time.This therapy targets speech, motor or cognitive skills through its focus on emotional development through interactive play between parents and children. Overall, it aims to help children learn a number of developmental skills, including interpersonal interaction, emotional thinking and advanced communication.

Education and development.Most children with autism respond well to highly structured, specialized treatment, especially in a school setting. Teachers and parents should discuss how to develop a plan that works best for the child’s needs. Suggestions may include:

There are no FDA-approved medications for the core symptoms of ASD. Two antipsychotic medicines, Aripipazole and Resperiodone, have been approved for irritability associated with autism. Other off-label medications are best used in combination with psychotherapy and other interventions. They should target specific symptoms with an outcome to measure their effectiveness. Please consult a psychiatrist on the best medication plan for the individual.

CAM, known as integrative medicine, looks at other factors that can have a positive influence on the symptoms of ASD.

Managing the symptoms of autism can be difficult. If you or your child is struggling, there is help. NAMI and NAMI affiliates are there to provide you with support for you and your family and information about community resources.

ASD often poses a challenge to a person’s ability to interact in society. Lack of education and stigma leaves many people unable to understand that this is a medical disorder. Even for adults, the negative associations others make are more damaging than the symptoms themselves. Fortunately, there are options:
