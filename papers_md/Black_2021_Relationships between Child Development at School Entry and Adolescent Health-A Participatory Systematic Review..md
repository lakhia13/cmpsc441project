Abstract: The relationship between child development and adolescent health, and how this may be
modiﬁed by socio-economic conditions, is poorly understood. This limits cross-sector interventions
to address adolescent health inequality. This review summarises evidence on the associations
between child development at school starting age and subsequent health in adolescence and identiﬁes
factors affecting associations. We undertook a participatory systematic review, searching electronic
databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ASSIA and ERIC) for articles published between November 1990
and November 2020. Observational, intervention and review studies reporting a measure of child
development and subsequent health outcomes, speciﬁcally weight and mental health, were included.
Studies were individually and collectively assessed for quality using a comparative rating system
of stronger, weaker, inconsistent or limited evidence. Associations between child development and
adolescent health outcomes were assessed and reported by four domains of child development
(socio-emotional, cognitive, language and communication, and physical development). A conceptual
diagram, produced with stakeholders at the outset of the study, acted as a framework for narrative
synthesis of factors that modify or mediate associations. Thirty-four studies were included. Analysis
indicated stronger evidence of associations between measures of socio-emotional development and
subsequent mental health and weight outcomes; in particular, positive associations between early
externalising behaviours and later internalising and externalising, and negative associations between
emotional wellbeing and later internalising and unhealthy weight. For all other domains of child
development, although associations with subsequent health were positive, the evidence was either
weaker, inconsistent or limited. There was limited evidence on factors that altered associations.
Positive socio-emotional development at school starting age appears particularly important for
subsequent mental health and weight in adolescence. More collaborative research across health and
education is needed on other domains of development and on the mechanisms that link development
and later health, and on how any relationship is modiﬁed by socio-economic context.

1. Introduction

Inequalities in many child health outcomes are increasing in the UK and the health
of those living in its most disadvantaged areas are amongst the worst in the developed
world [1]. Some of the roots of health inequality are thought to be in early childhood
with socio-economically driven inequalities in child development persisting across the
life course, negatively impacting people’s future health, wellbeing and life chances, and

perpetuating health inequalities into adulthood [2]. Evidence that the early years, or the
ﬁrst “1000 days”, is a critical period of development [3,4] (together with health economics
research in this ﬁeld [5]) has meant that the early years have become a prime area for public
policy and public health investment in many high-income countries including the UK [6].
All of the countries of the UK provide early childhood programmes, which aim to
improve outcomes for children by supporting optimal health and development through
access to services such as early education and care, between the ages of 0–4 years or
pre-school [7]. There is evidence that programmes which support child development
in readiness for school can improve cognitive and non-cognitive skills [8]. There is also
evidence that positive cognitive development on starting school is associated with aca-
demic achievement by age 13 years [9] and positive socio-emotional development by age
10 years [10]. Non-cognitive skills, such as social skills and self-regulation on starting
school, are also associated with later academic success and psychosocial outcomes in sub-
sequent years of childhood and early adolescence [11]. There is less evidence for whether
and how child development, or interventions to support child development, are related
to subsequent health in childhood. For example, there is limited evidence on the effect
of early child development programmes (such as attending pre-school, accessing health
services and parenting programmes) on adolescent health, with one systematic review
ﬁnding little to no effect of early childhood programmes on later child health, although
with some evidence for obesity reduction, greater social competence, improved mental
health and crime prevention [12]. A review of Sure Start (a UK early years programme from
1999 to 2017, for families with children under the age of four years and targeted in more
disadvantaged areas) found that access to Sure Start was associated with fewer childhood
hospitalisations for infections and injury [13]. Potential mechanisms proposed for this
association were: the provision of information to parents and changing parents behaviour,
leading to a safer and more nurturing home, and to reducing externalising behaviour in
children, leading to less ﬁghts or dangerous activities [13].

To better understand whether and how child development at school starting age is
associated with subsequent health in childhood requires a clear understanding of what
is meant by “child development”, reliable measures of child development, and also the
development and testing of conceptual frameworks or theories regarding the relationships
between child development and later adolescent health. In terms of deﬁning what we
mean by child development, this is contested academic and policy terrain and, as such, is
difﬁcult to deﬁne. For some, child development is understood through a narrow focus on
cognitive education, whereas for others it is about broader life skills, including conﬁdence
and social competencies [14]. In English health and education policy, child development
has tended to be deﬁned in the former, relatively narrow manner, with, for example, child
development at school starting age understood through a speciﬁc composite measure
of a child’s personal, social and emotional, physical, cognitive, and communication and
language development, termed “school readiness” [15]. Internationally, school readiness,
when considered more broadly, has been seen as a viable strategy to reduce inequalities in
learning and development gaps at the start of formal education [16]. However, how it is
deﬁned and used in England has been criticised as reductionist, with school readiness used
as a performance and accountability measure, resulting in a narrowing of the curriculum,
marginalisation of children who fail to achieve required levels of development through
grouping by ability, and subjugation of teachers and schools to meet targets [17]. Moving
beyond targets to understanding child development more broadly, as an ongoing devel-
opmental process in a social context [18], is important if we are to develop interventions
to support equitable health and development. Therefore, we consider “child develop-
ment” in this review as any measure of child development which encapsulates a process
of change in what a child is capable or able of doing, or in how they are feeling. There is
no existing framework for characterising different aspects or measures of child develop-
ment. Therefore, in this review we use four over-arching domains of child development:
socio-emotional development, cognitive development, language and communication, and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11613

3 of 36

physical development. These domains broadly encompass the areas of learning within
the early years curriculum in England [15]. We see these categories as potentially useful
despite the described shortcomings of England’s composite measure, “school readiness”.
Conceptualising child development in this way provides a platform for learning about
the relationships between speciﬁc domains of child development (using a range of child
development measures) and subsequent health.

Understanding whether and how child development and adolescent health outcomes
are related presents opportunities for interventions to improve health and reduce health
inequalities at an important time in the life-course, adolescence. There is evidence that
health in adolescence is on the causal pathway to socio-economic status (SES) in adulthood
by enabling “selection” into education [19]. Therefore, focusing on health in this period is
critical to enable children to optimise their subsequent educational outcomes for wellbeing
and employment opportunities. Informing interventions requires evidence not just on
associations between child development and adolescent health but also on the effect of
socio-economic circumstances on any associations found. In our protocol we outlined
pathways by which socio-economically driven health inequalities may manifest (family
stress, material living circumstances and parental health behaviours) and also possible
direct pathways (social and cognitive) between child development and subsequent health.
This provides a conceptual framework for the review. To inform interventions on any
of these pathways there is a need to identify factors which may explain, and the socio-
economic circumstances which may modify, the associations between child development
and adolescent health. This requires a public health lens and, as far as we are aware, no
review has analysed the evidence on relationships between different dimensions of child
development and adolescent health outcomes or assessed the factors which may shape
the relationships.

In summary, there is evidence that aspects of child development at school starting
age are associated with later academic success, but less is known about whether and how
particular dimensions of child development inﬂuence health outcomes in adolescence. This
gap in understanding limits cross-sector interventions to improve adolescent health and
reduce health inequality. This review addresses this gap by undertaking a participatory
systematic review to: (1) synthesise evidence on the relationship between child develop-
ment at school starting age (3–7 years) and subsequent health in adolescence (8–15 years)
and (2) identify factors that shape the relationship.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Protocol Registration

The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020210011) and pub-
lished [20]. The review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Reporting
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 Statement [21,22]; the checklist
available in additional ﬁle 1. Any deviations from protocol are stated and explained in the
relevant sections.

2.2. Review Questions
• What are the associations between measures of child development recorded at school

starting age (3–7 years) and subsequent health in adolescence (8–15 years)?

• What are the effect modiﬁers (socio-economic factors) of this relationship? (This will

identify factors which alter the strength of the observed associations.)

• What are the mediators of this relationship? (This will identify factors or set of factors

(pathways) which explain the observed associations.)

2.3. Deﬁnition of Terms

Child development is deﬁned as a developmental process incorporating measures of
development that record changes within a child’s cognitive or physical development, or
language and communication, or socio-emotional development.

2.4. Study Design

The design for this study was a participatory systematic review, involving engagement

with national and local stakeholders across health and education sectors.

Stakeholder Engagement to Design the Conceptual Diagram

The lead reviewer held discussions with stakeholders to develop a conceptual model
of the relationship under study. This process is described in full in the study protocol [20].
Their views, together with a scoping review of the evidence, led to an initial conceptual
diagram (available in additional ﬁle 2). This diagram highlights the main pathways by
which socio-economically driven health inequalities manifest; family stress, material living
circumstances and parental health behaviours [23]; and also illustrates possible direct
pathways (knowledge/literacy and social/cognitive) between child development and
education and subsequent health. The diagram acted as a framework for the review,
providing initial categories for extracting and analysing evidence from published studies.

2.5. Eligibility

Studies needed to include children, some or all of whom were aged between 3 and
15 years, in high-income country settings deﬁned as a member country of the Organisation
for Economic and Co-operation and Development (OECD). Exposures were characteristics
of child development at school starting age (3–7 years), deﬁned as: cognitive or physical
development, or communication and language, or socio-emotional development. Pri-
mary outcomes were health and wellbeing outcomes, reported between the ages of 8 and
15 years: speciﬁcally, weight, mental health and proxy measures such as dietary habits and
behaviour and measures of wellbeing. Secondary outcomes were academic outcomes of
academic tests and proxy measures such as executive function during the outcome age
of interest. Secondary outcomes were only included if they were found in a study with
a primary outcome of interest. Executive function was included as a secondary outcome
of interest because it allows for the regulation, control and management of learning, and
thus appears an important link between child development and academic outcomes. In
addition, executive function is a good predictor of academic achievement [24]. Studies that
provided data on associations between the exposures and outcomes in the age period of
interest, and additionally those that provided evidence on mechanisms, were required.
The population and context, exposure, outcomes and study designs are described in full in
the published protocol [20] and summarised in relation to inclusion and exclusion criteria
in Table 1.

2.6. Search Strategy

Cross-sectional studies, conference abstracts,
books, dissertations, or opinion pieces.

We searched four electronic databases for articles published from November 1990
to November 2020: MEDLINE (OVID), PsycINFO (OVID), ASSIA (ProQuest) and ERIC
(EBSCO). We also searched the reference lists from all included articles for additional
eligible articles. Further relevant literature was identiﬁed through stakeholder discussions.
Grey literature searching was undertaken by searching relevant organisations’ websites.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11613

The search strategy was informed by a scoping review of the literature and focused on
terms relating to child development, school readiness and adolescent health. The search
strategy is available in additional ﬁle 3.

2.7. Study Selection and Data Extraction

Retrieved citations were uploaded to EndNote and duplicates removed. Titles and
abstracts were screened by ﬁve reviewers against the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
A 10% sample of papers was independently checked by two reviewers and inter-rater
reliability was 86%. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion between the reviewers,
so that a consensus was reached. The full texts of papers were read in the second stage
of the screening process, by ﬁve reviewers, to produce a ﬁnal list of papers for full text
review. The ﬁnal list of papers included was exported to excel to be assessed for the
data extraction process. The lead reviewer extracted data for those articles that met the
inclusion criteria in full. Reasons for exclusion were recorded and a list of excluded papers,
together with the reason, is available in additional ﬁle 4. Data extraction was undertaken
solely by the lead reviewer using a bespoke form (additional ﬁle 5), which had been
trialled on a sample of different sources, and a sample of 10% was second checked. The
following data were extracted: author and year, study design, analysis method, country
and setting, participants, exposure measure and age, exposure measurement instrument,
outcome measure and age, outcome measurement instrument, association and effect size,
mechanism (studied and proposed), and factors which moderate the association, strengths
and weaknesses.

2.8. Quality Assessment

Our protocol stipulated the use of Liverpool Quality Assessment Tool (LQAT) [26].
However, it was found that LQAT was insufﬁciently detailed for this review. Therefore,
in a deviation from protocol we adapted a tool appropriate for the study designs used
in previous systematic reviews [27,28]. The methodological quality of each observational
study was assessed for risk of bias and clarity of study description to assign studies to one
of three categories of methodological quality: high, moderate or low, using the template in
additional ﬁle 6. Speciﬁcally, studies were assessed against 12 criteria within the following
categories: study population, study attrition, data collection and data analysis with each
pertaining to validity, precision or informativeness. In line with the recommendations
of Cochrane [29], studies were not scored, and instead a narrative indication of quality
(using +, − and ? against each criteria) was made based on all criteria, with criteria
pertaining to validity and precision carrying a greater weight in guiding overall quality.
Quality assessments were undertaken by the main author and a 10% sample independently
assessed by a member of the review team. In all cases the overall assessments of quality
made by the reviewers were consistent.

In addition to assessing the quality of each individual paper, the overall strength of
evidence for papers grouped by outcome and domain was assessed, e.g., mental health
outcomes and the socio-emotional domain of child development. Within these groupings
the overall ﬁndings were graded as providing either: stronger evidence (generally con-
sistent ﬁndings in higher quality studies); weaker evidence (generally consistent ﬁndings
in one higher quality study, or in multiple lower quality studies); inconsistent evidence
(inconsistent ﬁndings across multiple studies); or very limited evidence (a single study).
This method draws on techniques used by Hoogendoom [27] and Baxter [30,31].

2.9. Data Synthesis

As per the protocol, we undertook a narrative synthesis using the SwIM guidelines [32]
(additional ﬁle 7) to guide reporting. This was in anticipation of heterogeneity in the variety
of exposures, analysis methods and outcomes in the studies. Each study was assessed and
associations between exposures and outcomes recorded as either “positive”, “negative”
or “no association”. Studies were grouped by outcome and, within this, organised by

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11613

7 of 36

exposure domain and tabulated to illustrate both the associations and assigned quality.
The groupings for the outcome measure were undertaken by allocating the measure into
either mental health, obesity or academic outcomes. The grouping for exposure measures
was an inductive process involving an interpretation of the way child development had
been understood and measured in each included paper, and then classifying and allocating
these into a particular domain of child development; namely, a socio-emotional domain,
cognitive domain, language and communication domain, physical domain or multiple
domains. This was a subjective process because, as indicated in the introduction, there is
no existing framework for understanding child development and characterising measures
of child development.

An overall rating on the strength of the evidence for each grouping (studies allo-
cated within each domain of child development for each outcome: weight, mental health,
academic) was derived as described in the quality assessment section. The results for fac-
tors which mediate or moderate associations between child development and subsequent
health in adolescence (review question 2) was synthesised in relation to the conceptual
diagram (additional ﬁle 2) of the relationship (produced with stakeholders at the outset
of the review). Factors were classed as either mediators (those that explain associations)
or moderators (those that alter the strength of associations) and assigned to a pathway
(grouping of factors): family stress, knowledge/literacy, social/cognitive, material living
and parent health behaviours. The overall ratings on the strength of the evidence for each
domain and outcome, and stakeholder discussions, were used to inform a ﬁnal diagram of
the relationship between child development and adolescent health.

3. Results
3.1. Literature Results

Following the screening of 10,657 retrieved citations, 34 articles were included in the
review. See Figure 1 for PRISMA diagram illustrating the study selection process. Fifty-two
studies were excluded on full text review; the list of studies excluded, with the reason, is
available in additional ﬁle 4.

3.2. Study Design and Setting

Of the 34 included studies there were 32 prospective longitudinal studies [33–64], one
retrospective longitudinal study [65] and one meta-analysis [66]. Detailed descriptions of
the included studies are available in additional ﬁle 8. Of the 34 studies, 14 were set in the
United States [35,36,39,43,45,47,49–51,56–59,64], seven in Canada [38,46,52–55,63], ﬁve in
Australia [34,41,44,48,62], three in the UK [40,42,61], three in The Netherlands [33,37,65],
one in Denmark [60] and one in which the countries included in the analysis were not
explicitly stated [66].

3.3. Sample Size and Participant Characteristcs

The total number of children in included studies in the review was 69,152 (48%
female, in those where sex was reported). Participants were recruited from pre-birth
(through mother’s pregnancy) to age 12 years, with the majority recruited between the
ages of 4–6 years, at pre-school or kindergarten. Across the studies recruitment took place
between 1986 and 2009. The majority of the children were enrolled in existing longitudinal
studies, were mainly Caucasian and from a mix of socioeconomic backgrounds. Six studies
focused on socioeconomic disadvantage; three were of children from socio-economically
disadvantaged families recruited from child care centres [50] or Head Start programmes
(early years services to support low-income children and families in the US) [39,58], two
studies oversampled for greater socioeconomic risk [51,61] and one oversampled for non-
marital status [47]. A further two studies had children from majority low income [42]
and low to middle income families [49]. There were three studies in which children from
socioeconomic disadvantage were less well represented [34,38,52]. Children were assessed
either in their own homes, pre-school or school apart from in two studies where lab-based

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11613

assessments were made [46,51] and two where routinely collected healthcare data was
used [61,65].

3.4. Studies Identiﬁed across Different Domains of Child Development (Exposures) and
Adolescent Outcomes

Studies were found that focused on all domains of child development, namely:
socio-emotional development, cognitive development, language and communication,
and physical development. Table 2 illustrates the number of studies within each do-
main and the related adolescent outcome measure(s). Table 3 provides a summary of
the main study characteristics and describes the exposures by domain of child devel-
opment, outcomes and how they were measured. The main domain of child devel-
opment studied in included papers was socio-emotional development with 24 stud-
ies [33–35,37–39,42,44–48,50,53,54,56–60,62,64–66]. Exposures included behaviours such
as internalizing and externalizing behaviours, social competence, emotion knowledge,
emotional wellbeing, emotional reactivity and peer relations. Exposures within the socio-
emotional domain were generally measured using the relevant sections of standardized
instruments such as the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), the Social Behaviour Question-
naire (SBQ) or the Strengths and Difﬁculties Questionnaire (SDQ), with a mixture of child
report, teacher report and parent report across the studies.

The overall ratings on the strength of the evidence for each domain and outcome, and stakeholder discussions, were used to inform a final diagram of the relationship between child development and adolescent health.  3. Results 3.1. Literature Results Following the screening of 10,657 retrieved citations, 34 articles were included in the review. See Figure 1 for PRISMA diagram illustrating the study selection process.

Study Design and Setting Of the 34 included studies there were 32 prospective longitudinal studies [33–64], one retrospective longitudinal study [65] and one meta-analysis [66]. Detailed descrip-tions of the included studies are available in additional file 8. Of the 34 studies, 14 were set in the United States [35,36,39,43,45,47,49–51,56–59,64], seven in Canada [38,46,52–Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11613

Four studies [40,51,52,63] had an aspect of cognition as the exposure of interest,
namely: mathematics skills, executive control, foundational cognitive ability, verbal abil-
ity/literacy and Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Executive control refers to a set of cognitive
processes necessary for cognitive control of behaviour and was measured by observing
tasks. Verbal ability was measured using literacy tests, mathematics skills by number
knowledge tests or standardized assessments relating to the relevant country’s curriculum,
and foundational cognitive ability and IQ by standardized instruments.

Two studies [36,43] had language and communication as the main exposures and a
further study [52] included language as one of multiple exposures. Exposures included
receptive and expressive vocabulary. These were measured using the relevant sections of
standardised assessments such as the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test.

Two studies [49,55] incorporated exposures in the physical domain of child de-
velopment. Exposures included fundamental movement skills (balance, agility, hand-
eye co-ordination) and participation in structured and unstructured physical activity.
These were measured by either parent report or assessment of skills by assessors in the
child’s home.

Two studies [41,61] measured across all domains of child development and education.
One study assessed the component parts of teacher-rated school readiness in relation
to the country’s early development instrument and one focused on child development
in all domains in a health visitor check as a composite measure. In the main, studies
analysed the effect of the exposure at a certain time point on an outcome at one later time
point. However, two studies repeated measures at subsequent ages to assign children to a
trajectory for the exposure of interest [38,58] and four studies repeated measures to study
trends over time [43,48,57,64].

3.5. Quality Assessment

Thirty-three of the 34 included studies were assessed using the methodological assess-
ment tool for observational studies, available in additional ﬁle 6. One study, a meta-analysis,
was assessed using AMSTAR (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews). Results
of the quality assessment process for all included studies is available in additional ﬁle 9.
Ten were rated as low, 16 moderate and eight high in methodological quality. High implies
a low risk of bias, moderate implies a moderate risk of bias and low quality implies a high
risk of bias.

As outlined in quality assessment section of the methods, conﬁdence in cumulative

3.6. Narrative Synthesis

There was a range of exposures and outcomes reported across the included literature.

Studies were organised by outcomes and grouped as follows:
•

“Mental health related symptoms”—this incorporated: internalising symptoms (gen-
eral, depression, anxiety, loneliness and self-esteem), externalising (general and ‘delin-
quency’), socio-emotional behaviour problems, social competence, wellbeing, self-
harm and suicidal ideation.
“Weight, diet and physical activity”—this incorporated: BMI, overweight/obese,
sports participation, unhealthy weight attitudes, and healthy dietary habits.
For secondary outcomes, the group included executive function and outcomes from
academic tests.

•

•

Within these above groupings, studies were subsequently organised by exposure and

by each domain of child development as follows:
• Domain: Social and emotional development. This was further subdivided to aid

analysis, as follows:

(cid:35)
(cid:35)

(cid:35)

Internalising—internally focused behaviour such as inhibition and withdrawal.
Externalising—externally focused behaviour such as aggression, attention
problems, hyperactivity and “delinquent” behaviour.
Emotional—internal factors such as social competence, emotion knowledge,
pro-social, co-operative and self-regulation skills. External factors such as
peer relations, parent-child relationships, teacher-child relationships, socio-
emotional climate of school/pre-school setting.
Temperament—negative emotionality, emotional reactivity and persistence.

•

•

(cid:35)
Domain: Language and communication. This comprised the ability to listen, understand
and speak. Exposures included: receptive and expressive vocabulary. Receptive relates to
understanding of words and expressive relates to the ability to use words for expression.
Domain: Cognitive development. This comprised mathematics skills, executive control,
foundational cognitive ability, verbal ability/literacy and Intelligence Quotient (IQ)
Domain: Physical development. This involved fundamental movement skills (balance,
agility, hand-eye co-ordination) and participation in structured and unstructured
physical activity
• Multiple domains.

•

A summary of the evidence on associations between exposures (domains of child
development) and outcomes is presented in Figure 2. Each annotation does not always
represent a study in its entirety as many studies analysed multiple exposures and outcomes.

3.7. Primary Outcomes
3.7.1. Mental Health
Summary of Associations between Child Development and Mental Health

Positive development on starting school is associated with subsequent positive mental
health. There is stronger evidence for associations between the socio-emotional domain
of child development and later mental health, weaker evidence for the cognitive do-
main, inconsistent evidence for language and communication and limited evidence for
physical development.

Summary of Associations between Socio-Emotional Development and Mental Health

Eighteen studies analysed associations between a socio-emotional exposure of child
development and later mental health [33,35,38,39,42,44–47,50,53,56,57,59,60,64–66]. All
associations highlighted that positive socio-emotional development is good for subsequent
mental health, apart from ﬁve studies where no associations were found for some expo-
sures and outcomes studied [39,42,50,60,65]. The evidence is stronger for exposures of
externalising behaviour and emotional wellbeing at school entry, weaker for exposures of
internalising behaviour and limited for exposures relating to temperament.

Exposure of Internalising Behaviours at School Entry and Subsequent Mental Health

Eight studies analysed the relationship between early internalising behaviour and
later mental health [33,39,47,50,53,60,65,66], highlighting weaker evidence for positive
associations with internalising outcomes and limited evidence for positive associations
with externalising outcomes. Of these, six studies analysed the association between early
internalising and later internalising behaviours, with two studies of moderate quality
showing positive associations [33,47], one high quality study where no association was
found [39], and one low quality study, of 56 children, where no association was found
with depression symptoms [50]. Speciﬁcally, anxious-fearful behaviour is associated with
later emotional difﬁculties as reported by parents [60] in a study of moderate quality.
Behavioural inhibition is associated with anxiety but this evidence was from a lower
quality review [66]. Evidence on the relationship between early internalising and later
externalising behaviours was scant; only limited evidence was provided, with two studies
not studying that relationship speciﬁcally [47,53] and one study where no association was
found between early emotional and behaviour problems and later externalising [65].

Exposure of Externalising Behaviours at School Entry and Subsequent Mental Health

Nine studies were found on the relationship between externalising behaviours and
later mental health [33,38,39,45,47,50,53,60,65], highlighting stronger evidence for positive
associations with both internalising and externalising outcomes. Of these, seven studies
analysed the associations between early externalising and later internalising, with six stud-
ies showing positive associations and one study where no association was found. There was
evidence of positive associations between general externalising behaviour problems [33,39]
and later internalising symptoms, and speciﬁcally aggression [60] was associated with later
internalising symptoms. However, although two studies showed no association between
hyperactive behaviour [60] or inattention [65] and later general internalising symptoms,
one high quality study of 2000 children did evidence an association between these be-
haviours and later anxiety symptoms [38]. One study, of lower quality, evidenced that
disruptiveness was associated with later depression symptoms and loneliness [53].

Similar to internalising symptoms, whereby the continuity of association was found
for early and later symptoms, the same is true for externalising symptoms, whereby early
problems are associated with externalising at a later age. However, the evidence is stronger
with two studies of moderate quality evidencing associations between general externalis-
ing [47], inattention and behaviour problems [65] and later general externalising symptoms,
with a further study evidencing a relationship between poorer social competence with
peers in mid-childhood and earlier behaviour problems [45]. Speciﬁcally, disruptiveness
was associated with delinquency in one low quality study [53].

Exposures of Emotional Wellbeing at School Entry and Subsequent Mental Health

Nine studies were found on the associations between a child’s emotional wellbeing
and later mental health [35,38,39,42,44–46,57,64] with stronger evidence found for the asso-
ciation with internalising outcomes and weaker evidence for externalising outcomes. A
child’s emotional wellbeing, in terms of social competence, emotional knowledge (the abil-
ity to identify and label emotions), self-regulation and prosociality (behaviour intended to
beneﬁt others), appears beneﬁcial to later health in adolescence. Negative associations were
found between early social competence and internalising and externalising problems [35].
In two high quality studies, associations were found for emotional knowledge [39] and
prosocial skills [38] and later anxiety, with increasing emotional knowledge and prosocial
skills both associated with less anxiety symptoms. A child’s ability to co-operate, a particu-
lar prosocial skill, highlighted mixed results in one study [42], with increasing co-operation
associated with less externalising but no association found with internalising problems.
Self-regulation problems, in terms of ability to control behaviours, attention, thinking,
social interaction and emotions, were subsequently associated, in adolescence, with an
increase in the risk of self-harm ideation and behaviour, suicidal ideation, school truancy,

mental health problems, smoking and alcohol use, and violent and property crime [44].
When self-regulation problems reduced, from age 4–5 to 6–7, the association between these
adolescent outcomes and earlier self-regulation problems was no longer found [44].

In relation to the child’s emotional wellbeing in the context of relationships or setting
speciﬁc (external factors), studies were found on: mother–child attachment, relationship
with parents, teachers, and peers (victimisation), and the socio-emotional climate in a
pre-school setting, and all proved important for positive mental health in adolescence.
A small study of 68 children, rated low quality, evidenced that disorganised maternal
attachment at pre-school age was associated with greater depression and anxiety symptoms
and lower self-esteem in early adolescence [46]. A positive relationship with parents, in
terms of closeness, was associated with less loneliness, particularly for father–daughter
relationships [64]. In one low quality study, a good quality relationship with teachers
and a positive socio-emotional climate in a pre-school setting were both associated with
improved social competence in mid-childhood [45]. With regard to relations with peers,
one study evidenced that early and increasing peer victimisation was associated with
depression symptoms and aggression [57].

Exposures of Temperament at School Entry and Subsequent Mental Health

Two studies were found on the association between temperament and later mental
health highlighting limited evidence of a negative association, with higher levels of certain
traits associated with worse outcomes. These studies investigated child temperament, in
terms of negative emotionality and emotional reactivity (the former refers to the propensity
to react with negative emotions and the latter relates to the intensity of emotion) [56,59] and
both were of moderate quality. One showed an association between negative emotionality,
emotional reactivity and depression symptoms [56] and one between emotional reactivity
and internalising and externalising symptoms [59].

Summary of Associations between Language and Communication, Cognitive
Development, Physical Development, and Multiple Domains and Mental Health

Eight studies analysed the associations between exposures relating to either language
and communication, cognitive development, physical development or multiple domains
of child development and later mental health. All associations highlighted that positive
development across all of the domains of child development are good for subsequent
mental health. There was weaker evidence for the effect of cognitive skills and the positive
effect of cognitive development appears to alter with age. The evidence for associations
between language and communication and later mental health outcomes was inconsistent
in relation to internalising and externalising outcomes. There was limited evidence for
both physical development and measures incorporating multiple domains.

Exposures within the Language and Communication Domain and Subsequent
Mental Health

The results for the effect of language and communication skills on later mental health
symptoms was inconsistent with two studies investigating these associations [36,43]. One
study of 129 children evidenced that language skills at pre-school age predict internalising
but not externalising behaviour problems in adolescence. Conversely, one low quality
study of 74 children did ﬁnd an association between good language skills (receptive
and expressive language) and less externalising problems, namely, conduct problems but
not hyperactivity.

Exposures within the Cognitive Domain and Subsequent Mental Health

Three studies analysed the effect of cognitive skills on later mental health symp-
toms, [40,51,63] with weaker evidence found. One study found that deﬁcits in executive
control predicted depression and anxiety symptoms and clinical level of depression [51].
The same study showed that foundational cognitive ability did not predict these outcomes.
One high quality study showed an association between cognition, measured as IQ, and
depression symptoms with an increased IQ in early childhood associated with less depres-
sion symptoms at age 11 [40]. However, by age 13–14 the association reversed. The loss
of protective effect of cognition was also found in relation to the effect of cognitive skill
(measured as mathematics skills and verbal ability) on internalising symptoms, whereby a
protective effect seen at age 12-13 was reversed or had no associated effect at age 14–15 [63].

Exposures within Physical Development Domain and Subsequent Mental Health

There was limited evidence for the effect of physical development on later mental
health related symptoms. One lower quality study, in which time between exposure and
outcome was one year, found that structured physical activity was associated with less
depression symptoms in boys, whereas unstructured physical activity was associated with
more depression in girls [55].

Exposures Incorporating Multiple Domains and Subsequent Mental Health

Two studies provided evidence across multiple domains [41,61]. One study evidenced
that all components of school readiness (as part of a model of early years data), measured by
UK health visitors before starting school, predicted socio-emotional behaviour problems in
early adolescence [61]. An Australian study which investigated the relationships between
all domains of school readiness and wellbeing at the end of primary school found that all
domains were negatively associated with internalising symptoms, whereas only physical
and socio-emotional development were positively associated with overall wellbeing [41].

3.7.2. Weight, Diet and Physical Activity Outcomes
Summary of Associations between Child Development and Weight

Positive development on starting school is associated with subsequent healthy weight
related outcomes. There is stronger evidence for the socio-emotional domain of child de-
velopment, and limited evidence for language and communication, cognitive and physical
domains of child development.

Summary of Associations between Socio-Emotional Development and Weight

Five studies analysed the associations between a socio-emotional measure of child
development and later weight diet or physical activity outcomes [37,44,48,54,62]. All
associations highlighted that positive socio-emotional development is good for subsequent
weight-related outcomes, apart from one study where mixed associations were found
for exposures of certain temperamental traits and later weight related outcomes. The
evidence is stronger for exposures within the emotional wellbeing domain, speciﬁcally
self-regulation skills, with weaker evidence found for exposures of externalising behaviour
and no evidence found for internalising behaviour.

Exposures of Externalising, Emotional Wellbeing and Temperament and
Subsequent Weight

In relation to externalising, speciﬁcally aggressive behaviour, one higher quality study
found a positive association with higher BMI [37] and one of moderate quality found an
association with higher rate of change in BMI but in girls only [48]. In relation to self-
regulation, one higher quality study [44] evidenced that early problems in self-regulation
(ability to control attention, behaviour and emotion at age 4–5) were associated with being
overweight or obese in adolescence but that a change in self-regulation (less problems)
at a later age (age 6–7) had no effect on the association. Another study highlighted that
increasing self-regulation skills (measured as class room engagement) were associated with
lower BMI and increased sports participation [54]. Additionally, this study evidenced that
emotional distress (a measure of self-regulation) was associated with less sports participa-
tion. In relation to temperament, one higher quality study [62] looked at the associations
between the traits of persistence sociability and negative reactivity, and later BMI and
weight attitudes and behaviours, and found that persistence decreased the risk of obesity
and overweight, sociability increased the risk of overweight but not obesity, and negative
reactivity was not associated with either. In relation to weight attitudes and behaviours,
all three traits were associated with restrained eating habits in adolescence, with lower
persistence and higher negative reactivity or sociability associated with restrained eating
and use of unhealthy weight management strategies.

Summary of Associations between Domains of: Language and Communication, Cognitive,
Physical Development, Multiple Domains and Weight

There was limited evidence on associations between the domains of language and com-
munication, cognitive skills, and physical development, and later weight-related outcomes.
One study, which looked at evidence on a range of school readiness skills and later wellbe-
ing measures, evidenced that receptive vocabulary was associated with healthier dietary
habits [52], with increasing receptive vocabulary predicting reduced sweet snack intake and
increased dairy intake. The same study [52] evidenced that increasing mathematics skills
predicted increasing involvement in physical activity, providing limited evidence for an
association between cognitive skills and later weight-related outcomes. There was limited
evidence on the association between physical development and weight-related outcomes,
with one lower quality study ﬁnding no association between fundamental movement skills
and later involvement in physical activity [49]. One study evidenced that all components
of school readiness (as part of a model of early years data), as measured by UK health
visitors before starting school, predicted overweight and obesity in early adolescence [61].

3.8. Secondary Outcomes
3.8.1. Academic Tests and Executive Function
Summary of Associations between Child Development and Academic Outcomes

Four studies analysed associations between a domain of child development and later
academic outcomes: three in relation to socio-emotional development and one in relation
to cognitive development. All associations highlighted that positive development is good
for subsequent academic outcomes. The evidence is stronger for exposures within the
socio-emotional domain, speciﬁcally self-regulation skills and less behaviour problems,
with weaker evidence found for exposures within the cognitive domain of child devel-
opment. There were no studies found looking at the association between language and
communication or physical development and academic outcomes.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11613

25 of 36

Exposures within the Socio-Emotional and Cognition Domains and Subsequent
Academic Outcomes

There were two studies found on associations between socio-emotional development
and the secondary academic outcomes, both of higher quality [34,44]. One studied the
effect of behaviour risk (a composite of poor sleep, emotions and inattention) on adolescent
executive function and found that poorer behaviour is associated with lower executive
function [34]. Another study highlighted that self-regulation problems are associated
with reduced scores on numeracy and literacy tests in adolescence [44]. An additional
study [58] investigated the effect of an intervention targeting socio-emotional functioning
and language emergent literacy skills in pre-school, through comparing the impact of
executive function trajectories on academic test results of children in the intervention group
compared to those who were not. This study showed that socio-emotional and language
programmes improved executive function and academic outcomes for children with the
lowest executive function trajectory. There was limited evidence on associations between
early cognitive skills and later academic outcomes, with one study showing a positive
association between kindergarten mathematics skills and later academic outcomes [52].

3.9. Factors Affecting Relationships

Summary of ﬁndings on factors affecting associations (mediation and moderation)
Limited evidence was found on factors affecting associations. Some evidence, however,
was found on factors affecting associations between socio-emotional development and
subsequent mental health and academic outcomes. The factors are discussed in relation to
the pathways identiﬁed in the initial conceptual model devised with stakeholders. Factors
were found in relation to family stress, knowledge/literacy and social/cognitive pathways.
No factors were found that pertained to the material living or parent health behaviour
pathways. All of the ﬁndings within this section fall into the category of limited evidence
as all of the factors described were found in single studies only.

3.9.1. Mediators

Six studies included data on mediating variables: ﬁve related to studies focusing on
mental health outcomes [35,36,46,53,56] and one relating to academic outcomes [34]. None
of the studies that focused on weight as an outcome included data on mediation. Factors
mediating associations between socio-emotional development and mental health were
self-esteem, type of internalising or externalising in mid-childhood, and relationships with
teachers and friends. Factors mediating associations between socio-emotional development
and academic outcomes were approaches to learning and attentional regulation.

3.9.2. Moderators

Seven studies included data on variables to test for moderation effects on associa-
tions between exposure and outcome: ﬁve in relation to mental health [38,40,47,59,64],
one in relation to weight [62] and one in relation to academic outcomes [58]. Factors
moderating associations between socio-emotional development and mental health were
household chaos and parenting. Household chaos had a negative effect, and aspects of
parenting had a positive effect on the associations between the socio-emotional domain
of child development and mental health outcomes. A factor found to moderate the asso-
ciation between socio-emotional development and academic outcomes was trajectory of
executive function.

3.9.3. Factors Pertaining to the Family Stress Pathway—Moderating Associations between
Child Development and Mental Health

This pathway incorporates factors related to stress in the home, which can affect par-
enting ability, parenting style and consequently child health and development. Household
chaos and aspects of parenting were identiﬁed as moderators of the relationship between
the socio-emotional domain of child development and later mental health symptoms.
Household chaos was found to disproportionately affect children with higher emotional
reactivity resulting in greater internalising problems [59]. This effect was not found for
household income; that is, level of emotional reactivity made no difference to the impact
of income on adolescent emotional and behaviour problems. This implies that the impact
of low income on adolescent mental health is pervasive and not amenable to individual
interventions promoting self-regulation (in terms of emotional response to events) but
that interventions of this type might support how children respond to household chaos.
Three studies analysed the moderating role of aspects of parenting on the relationships
between socio-emotional measures and later mental health related symptoms [38,47,64],
with all ﬁnding positive effects of aspects of child/parent relationships on adolescent
outcomes. Two studies found a protective effect of relationships with fathers on continuity
of behaviour problems. One found a protective effect for fathers’ positive engagement
on the continuity of earlier to later internalising and externalising behaviour problems,
and for those in the greatest poverty, fathers’ positive engagement was associated with a
reduction in the continuity of internalising problems from age 5 to 9 years [47]. The authors
hypothesize that this is due to development of secure attachment and the development
of emotional and behavioural regulation skills. Another looked at the moderating role
of parent–child closeness on the continuity of loneliness from age 6–11 years and found
that as parent–child closeness increased, loneliness reduced and this relationship was
particularly strong for girls and their fathers [64]. Another study looked at the moderating
role of maternal parenting practices, warmth and discipline, on the relationship between
behavioural characteristics of; inattention, hyperactivity, aggressiveness and low prosocial-
ity and trajectory of anxiety in children between the ages of 6 and 12 years [38]. It found
that a lack of maternal warmth increased the association between hyperactivity and anxiety.
It also found that high level of maternal discipline (rules and controlling child’s behaviour)
increased the probability of belonging to the high anxiety group.

3.9.4. Factors Pertaining to the Knowledge/Literacy Pathway—Moderating and Mediating
Associations between Child Development and Academic Outcomes

This pathway relates to the way knowledge and literacy can lead to behaviours that
can be positive for wellbeing [67]. Two studies analysed factors within this category, both
on the relationship between the socio-emotional domain and later academic outcomes.
One highlighted a moderating role of executive function on the relationship between
an intervention to improve socio-emotional and language emergent skills and later aca-
demic outcomes, and found that the effect of the intervention was higher in children with
low executive function in the intervention group resulting in better academic outcomes
compared to controls [58]. Another highlighted attentional regulation and approaches
to learning as mediators, partially explaining the relationship between child behaviour
(composite of sleep, emotional dysregulation and inattention/hyperactivity) and later
executive functioning.

3.9.5. Factors Pertaining to the Social/Cognitive Pathway—Mediating Associations
between Child Development and Mental Health

This pathway relates to the inﬂuence of individual experiences, the actions of others
and environmental factors that provide the social context for learning to inﬂuence health
behaviours [68]. Five studies analysed mediators pertaining to this pathway and all
in relation to mental health related symptoms: four in relation to the socio-emotional
domain [35,46,53,56] and one from the language and communication domain [36]. In
relation to the socio-emotional domain of child development and later mental health there

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11613

27 of 36

is limited evidence that self-esteem, type of internalising or externalising in mid-childhood,
and relationships with teachers and friends all play a role in explaining the relationship.
One study evidenced the role of self-esteem, which partially mediated the relationship
between emotional wellbeing (measured as parental attachment) and depression but not
anxiety [46]. Two studies highlighted the role of relationships: one with peers [53] and
one with teachers [56]. In relation to peers, peer rejection and number of friends in mid-
childhood mediated the relationship between disruptiveness at age 6 and depression at age
13 years, with peer rejection also mediating the relationship between disruptiveness and
loneliness. Relationships with teachers (closeness and conﬂict) also appear important, with
one study analysing the effect of child–teacher relationships on the relationship between
negative emotionality at age 4, emotional reactivity at age 7 and depression symptoms at
age 11–12 years [56]. This study found that teacher-child conﬂict mediated the relationship
between emotional reactivity and depression symptoms, with children higher in emotional
reactivity having more depression symptoms, and this was partially explained by conﬂict
with teachers (teacher reported).

3.9.6. Factors Pertaining to Child Characteristics—Moderating Associations between Child
Development and Weight and Mental Health

Sex moderated the association between socio-emotional domain of child development
and weight outcomes, with worse outcomes for girls. Age moderated the association
between the cognitive domain of child development and subsequent mental health, with a
protective role of positive cognitive development on mental health in early adolescence
reversing in mid-adolescence.

Two studies analysed the effect of age on the relationship between cognition and later
depression symptoms, and found that age reversed the protective effect of cognition on
early adolescent (age 11) mental health by age 13–15 years [40,63] but that this reversed
again at age 17 for females [40]. This study also found that pubertal status mimicked the
relationship by age but that this was stronger for females. The loss of the health protective
effect of cognition may be due to exam pressures at certain time points or, for females,
biological hormonal changes. Sex was the only factor studied in relation to weight. One
study evidenced that girls with higher aggression cores throughout childhood had a higher
rate of change in their BMI [48]. Another study highlighted that girls higher in sociability
in early childhood had a greater fear of weight gain at age 14–15 years [62].

3.10. Conceptual Model/Diagram Development

A summary of ﬁndings and revised conceptual model was discussed with stakehold-
ers and a ﬁnal diagram of the relationships, as informed by this systematic review, was
discussed and agreed—see Figure 3. Factors which were not found in the review but were
deemed important by stakeholders are highlighted on the diagram. These included neigh-
bourhood factors, such as community engagement and community environment, which
stakeholders felt could create conditions conducive for optimal health and development.
Political and system factors were also identiﬁed, such as short political cycles not giving
policy sufﬁcient time to embed and effect change, and regulators focusing narrowly on
academic outcomes rather than broader social and emotional wellbeing, which dictates the
focus of a school. The stakeholder group identiﬁed these factors as potential moderators of
the relationships between child development and health.

4. Discussion

This review asked the questions: what are the associations between child development
and adolescent health, and what factors explain or alter the associations. The review clearly
shows that positive development on starting school is good for later health outcomes, but
that the evidence is stronger for relationships between some domains of child development
than others, with gaps in the evidence base across domains. In relation to mental health
outcomes, there is stronger evidence for associations between socio-emotional development
and later mental health, weaker evidence for associations with cognitive development,
inconsistent evidence for language and communication, and limited evidence for physical
development. In relation to adolescent weight, there is stronger evidence for associations
with children’s socio-emotional development and limited evidence of relationships with
language and communication, cognitive development or physical development. In relation
to secondary (academic) outcomes, there is stronger evidence for associations with socio-
emotional development, limited evidence for an association with cognitive development
and no evidence found for an association with language and communication or physical
development. In relation to what factors explain or moderate the associations, the evidence
identiﬁed in this review is largely limited to factors shaping the relationship between socio-
emotional development and mental health and academic outcomes with factors pertaining
to the pathways of family stress, knowledge/literacy and social/cognitive.

Our ﬁndings build upon the existing limited evidence that attendance at pre-school (a
proxy for good child development) is associated with positive mental wellbeing and healthy
weight in adolescence [12], and provides detail on which domains of child development
are associated with these positive health outcomes. Supporting the existing literature, we
found positive relationships between both cognitive and socio-emotional development
(such as self-regulation and social competence) on mental health and academic outcomes in
early adolescence [9–11], with stronger evidence found for socio-emotional development.
Additionally, we identiﬁed evidence of a negative relationship between socio-emotional
wellbeing and unhealthy weight. The review provided a test of our conceptual model and
we found that the evidence base was lacking for some of the proposed pathways between
child development and later health.

Undertaking this review highlighted a complexity in classifying the rich and broad
literature that exists on child development. In consequence, the review had to embed an
inductive process of interpretation of how included studies had understood and measured
child development. Using a classiﬁcation system of four domains of child development
to aid analysis of a very broad concept enabled us to categorise a multitude of measures
of child development within this system. This complexity and the need for interpretation
is perhaps unsurprising given that the ﬁeld of child development spans the disciplines of
psychology, sociology education, biology, genetics and public health. That a classiﬁcation
system for understanding child development does not exist is in itself a ﬁnding of our
review. Our classiﬁcation of four domains of child development adds to the literature,
providing a framework for other researchers to use and to critique.

Our ﬁndings show that conceptualising child development into domains of develop-
ment matters because different aspects of development seem to have different impacts on
later health outcomes. Understanding this can help to inform public health interventions
in childhood. For example, in our review, we found that socio-emotional development
when children start school has the most evidence for subsequent impact on adolescent
health, in terms of mental health and healthy weight, and as such could be a focus for
intervention. The ﬁndings in relation to mental health are to be expected, with much
literature highlighting the continuity of early problems with socio-emotional functioning
and later onset of mental health conditions [69]. The evidence is stronger for early external-
ising behaviours and their impact on both internalising and externalising behaviours in
adolescence, and this is supported by wider literature [70,71]. A ﬁnding of this review is
that there is more evidence that behaviours such as aggression and hyperactivity pose a risk
to future mental health than anxious/withdrawn behaviour, particularly for externalising

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11613

30 of 36

outcomes. This ﬁnding should be interpreted cautiously because it may be that early
internalising behaviours, compared to externalising, are more likely to resolve by early
adolescence [72], or it may be that internalising is harder to identify, whereas externalising
behaviours are more obvious and easier for parents and teachers to report, which could
lead to less associations being observed for internalising behaviours and consequently
less associations found [39,70]. The ﬁnding that emotional wellbeing was more closely
associated with later internalising may be because emotional stability promotes regula-
tion and mood stability leading to less internalising [73], but other studies have found
that emotional wellbeing (in terms of regulation skills) is associated quite strongly with
both internalising and externalising, but particularly so for internalising after the early
years [74].

The ﬁndings in relation to stronger evidence on the associations between socio-
emotional development and weight add to a growing ﬁeld of evidence exploring this rela-
tionship, with evidence of co-development and temporal associations in mid-childhood [75],
evidence of obesity having a detrimental impact on socio-emotional behaviour [76], and
evidence on associations between social competence and weight with social competence
reducing the odds of later overweight [77]. From this review, emotional wellbeing and, in
particular, self-regulation skills, appear to be important factors to study in this complex
relationship between socio-emotional development and weight. However, other develop-
mental pathways in the development of obesity, such as physical activity and cultural and
social factors, are important to consider alongside self-regulation development [44].

More evidence is needed on how adolescent health outcomes are shaped by other
domains of child development, particularly the impact of language and communication,
and cognitive and physical development at school starting age. Evidence on these domains
are important for engaging health and education sectors to work together because edu-
cation and health services share a common goal for optimal developmental potential of
children [78]. This evidence would help the development of a shared understanding and
provide a platform from which to develop the context and settings that may work best
for optimal health and development of children, regardless of their stage of development
when starting school. Including executive function as an exposure and outcome in this
review allowed for inclusion of any evidence on the bi-directional relationship between
executive function and health [79]. The analysis of secondary outcomes of academic tests
and executive function highlight the importance of socio-emotional development on these
outcomes (health improves executive function). Conversely, the protective effect of cog-
nitive skills (measured as executive control) on adolescent mental health highlights that
executive function improves health. However, age appears to be an important factor in this
latter relationship, with the protective effects of cognition on mental health being reversed
or no associations found in mid-adolescence [40,63], and this warrants further research.

Understanding the impact of domains of child development on later health has
important policy implications in relation to reducing inequalities, and in relation to a
policy extension beyond the ﬁrst 1000 days. In relation to reducing inequalities, our review
highlights a strong relationship between socio-emotional development and later health.
Applying a public health lens to “child development” helps to understand exactly what it
is that pre-school provision or early years centres may need to focus on if we are to improve
adolescent health and wellbeing. Re-invigoration of early childhood programmes such
as Sure Start, with a renewed focus on socio-emotional development, may be one area of
policy improvement, particularly if we are to focus on their longer-term potential to reduce
inequalities [80].

In addition, arguably a policy shift is required, which extends beyond the ﬁrst
1000 days, to understand and support optimal development throughout childhood and
into adolescence [81], to address the consequences of inequalities in child development
as children age and because adolescence is a signiﬁcant period of development and an
important period in the life course [82]. If we are to maximise the opportunities conferred
by education as a platform to improve public health and reduce health inequalities [83],

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11613

31 of 36

policy that incorporates a life course approach to healthy development is needed, and this
requires cross-sector collaboration.

Fostering collaboration to inform policy on reducing child and adolescent health
inequalities beyond the ﬁrst 1000 days requires more research on how development and
education translates into health throughout childhood, and on the effect of socio-economic
circumstances on this relationship. Findings in relation to the factors that explain or al-
ter associations between child development and subsequent health were limited in this
review, with all ﬁndings pertaining to single studies. The most evidence was within the
social-cognitive pathway with self-esteem, relations with peers and teachers all providing
some explanation for the relationship between socio-emotional development and subse-
quent mental health outcomes, and this can inform interventions for optimal health and
development through the primary school years. Surprisingly, in relation to the original
conceptual diagram designed with stakeholders, there was no literature found on mate-
rial living circumstances, parent health behaviours, community factors, and political and
system factors. To some extent this was because the studies controlled for the effect of
income, housing, parental education and parent health behaviours. However, this presents
a problem because we need to know more about how these elements of socio-economic
circumstance affect the associations under study in this review. For example, we know
that children from more deprived backgrounds experience poorer health and development
than their more afﬂuent peers [7]. If we are to pragmatically intervene to improve the
health and development trajectory of children in more deprived circumstances, and reduce
the attainment and health gap, we need to understand exactly how poverty, household
circumstances and home environments affect learning and the co-development of educa-
tion and health. This requires the design of public health research that respects agency
but more clearly theorizes children within their social and economic context [84], so as to
encapsulate socio-political cultural and familial environments because, in many ways, this
is what “deﬁnes” child development in practice, over and above genetic make-up.

In addition to collaborating to produce more evidence on individual, home or school-
level interventions to mitigate against poor development, interventions at system level are
required to tackle prevention earlier so that children reach a good stage of development,
and to reduce inequalities in development measures upon starting school. This requires
evidence in relation to macro-determinants such as political and system factors, e.g., ad-
dressing poverty, the role of regulators in generating a target-driven culture that focuses
attention on academic achievement, a political system not conducive to cross-departmental
perspectives or action, and a system which stiﬂes innovation and creativity. Larger studies,
such as natural experiments or evaluations of existing policies, are needed that perhaps
compare areas with different working systems or policies to identify any particular cul-
tures or practices that are conducive to promoting positive trajectories for the health and
development of children. The participatory element of this research identiﬁed some of
these macro-determinants, identifying a gap between research and practice. This ﬁnding
highlights the need to bring research and practice closer together [85] through listening to
views and experiences of those working in service roles, at the system level and/or with
children. It is hoped that this method can help to inform future research by highlighting
what is evidenced in the literature, but also bringing to light views from lived experience,
which may not be captured in any published evidence but could steer future research.

The strengths of this review are in its systematic design aiming to incorporate all
relevant studies to answer the research question and in its engagement with a stakeholder
group to steer the review and engage research with practice. The involvement of a sample
of stakeholders raises the potential for biases to be introduced by selection of stakeholders
with particular views, opinions or experiences. The use of replicable and transparent
systematic review methods helps to minimise this risk. The research question was broad.
This limited the search strategy in incorporating all possible terms to address the breadth
of the research question and this may mean that some evidence was not found. Another
limitation is that the secondary outcomes were only included where they were found in

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11613

papers that also encompassed the primary outcome. This likely means that the associations
found are underestimated. Including any paper with the secondary outcomes would have
led to an unmanageable number of papers and, given that the focus of the review was
health outcomes, it steered the decision on only including secondary outcomes where
relevant in understanding any temporal dynamics to the relationship under study. The
grouping of child development measures, used for data synthesis, could be seen as both a
strength and a weakness: a strength in that it allowed for the classiﬁcation of a range of
child development measures into developmental domains, and a limitation in that it was a
subjective process and, as such, is open to critique.

5. Conclusions

Positive socio-emotional development at school starting age appears particularly
important for subsequent mental health and weight in adolescence. There are gaps in
the evidence about what factors affect the relationships between child development and
subsequent health, in particular, the effect of socio-economic factors. More collaborative
research across health and education is needed to develop and deﬁne appropriate mea-
sures of child development across key domains of child development, and also on the
relationships and mechanisms between domains of development, particularly cognitive,
language and communication, and physical development, and later health, in the context of
socio-economic inequality. This requires the design of public health research that respects
agency but more clearly theorizes children within their social and economic context [84],
so as to encapsulate socio-political, cultural and familial environments. Research designed
using longitudinal cohorts could be one way forward here and be considered in future
work on this topic. This theoretically informed research and knowledge is imperative to
inform interventions to address health inequalities in mid-childhood and adolescence.
