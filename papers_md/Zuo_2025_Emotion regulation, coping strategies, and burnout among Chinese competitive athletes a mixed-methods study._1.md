Emotion regulation, coping strategies, 
and burnout among Chinese competitive 
athletes: a mixed-methods study

Jianling Zuo1 and Yibing Bai2*

Abstract
This mixed-methods study explored the relationships between emotion regulation, coping strategies, and burnout 
among 286 Chinese competitive athletes (aged 18–28, 54% female) from diverse sports and competition levels 
across China. Quantitative data, collected via the Trait Meta-Mood Scale, Brief COPE Inventory, and Reduced 
Exhaustion Depression and Reduced Accomplishment Scale, revealed that emotional clarity and repair, alongside 
adaptive coping strategies (e.g., positive reframing, emotional support), were negatively associated with burnout, 
while maladaptive strategies (e.g., denial, self-blame) were positively linked to burnout. Mediation analyses 
indicated that coping strategies, such as positive reframing and denial, partially mediated the emotion regulation-
burnout relationship. Qualitative interviews with 23 athletes identified four themes: (1) Emotion Regulation as a 
Dynamic Process, (2) The Interplay of Coping Strategies, (3) The Lived Experience of Burnout, and (4) The Social 
Construction of Resilience and Vulnerability. These findings highlight the complex interplay of emotion regulation, 
coping, and social support in mitigating burnout, suggesting that interventions should enhance adaptive strategies 
and foster supportive environments to promote athlete well-being.

Introduction
Burnout  in  competitive  sports—defined  by  emotional 
and  physical  exhaustion,  a  diminished  sense  of  accom-
plishment,  and  detachment  from  training  and  competi-
tion  [1,  2,  3]—poses  a  widespread  challenge  for  athletes 
at  all  levels.  This  condition  jeopardizes  mental  health, 
undermines  performance,  and  reduces  engagement  [4, 
5].  In  China,  the  issue  is  especially  critical.  Intense  ath-
letic demands, driven by policies aimed at global success,

significantly  heighten  the  risk  of  burnout.  This  context 
calls for a deeper exploration of its causes and preventive 
measures tailored to these unique pressures [6, 7].

Research  consistently  ties  burnout  to  chronic  stress-
ors,  including  rigorous  training  schedules,  unrelenting 
performance  expectations,  and  limited  personal  control 
[8,  9].  These  pressures  often  reflect  a  persistent  imbal-
ance  between  the  demands  placed  on  athletes  and  the 
resources available to meet them [10, 11, 12]. Yet, not all 
athletes  respond  the  same  way.  Individual  differences  in 
managing  stress—particularly  through  emotion  regula-
tion  and  coping  strategies—play  a  pivotal  role  in  deter-
mining  who  thrives  and  who  falters  under  such  strain 
[13, 14, 15, 16].

Emotion  regulation,  the  ability  to  manage  how  emo-
tions  are  experienced  and  expressed  [17],  is  a  key  fac-
tor  in  reducing  distress  and  fostering  resilience  [18,  19, 
20]. Athletes skilled in maintaining emotional clarity and 
repairing  their  mood  tend  to  experience  less  burnout; 
these abilities help sustain motivation and well-being [21, 
22]. However, simply being aware of one’s emotions with-
out the tools to manage them can backfire. This may lead 
to increased rumination and anxiety, potentially worsen-
ing burnout [23, 24].

Coping strategies—the thoughts and behaviors athletes 
use to handle stress [25]—also shape burnout outcomes. 
Adaptive  approaches,  such  as  problem-focused  cop-
ing (e.g., planning) or positive reframing, are linked to a 
lower  risk  of  burnout  [26,  27].  In  contrast,  maladaptive 
strategies like denial or self-blame often amplify exhaus-
tion  and  negativity  [13,  28].  While  these  findings  are 
compelling, few studies have examined how emotion reg-
ulation and coping strategies work together to influence 
burnout, especially among Chinese athletes. Cultural and 
social  dynamics  may  uniquely  affect  stress  responses  in 
this population.

This  gap  underscores  the  need  to  investigate  how 
these  two  factors  interact  to  influence  burnout  in  Chi-
nese  competitive  athletes.  Understanding  their  interplay 
could pinpoint specific processes to target in prevention 
and intervention efforts. While surveys and standardized 
scales have been valuable for identifying broad patterns, a 
mixed-methods approach promises deeper, more contex-
tualized insights. By adding qualitative data, researchers 
can  uncover  personal  narratives  that  reveal  how  indi-
vidual  experiences,  training  environments,  and  cultural 
norms intersect with statistical trends.

With  this  in  mind,  the  present  study  adopts  a  mixed-
methods  design  to  explore  the  relationships  among 
emotion  regulation,  coping  strategies,  and  burnout  in  a 
sample  of  Chinese  competitive  athletes.  The  quantita-
tive  phase  measures  various  aspects  of  emotion  regula-
tion and coping to assess their contributions to burnout, 
adjusting  for  demographic  variables.  The  qualitative 
phase  then  enriches  these  findings  by  examining  how 
athletes  articulate  their  emotional  experiences,  develop 
coping  strategies,  and  perceive  the  onset  and  progres-
sion  of  burnout.  By  blending  these  approaches,  this 
study seeks to offer a nuanced perspective on the factors 
that  either  shield  athletes  from  burnout  or  heighten  its 
impact.  Ultimately,  these  insights  aim  to  guide  tailored, 
context-specific  interventions  and  advance  the  broader 
conversation on athlete well-being in China.

Literature review
Theoretical framework: self-determination theory (SDT)

This  study  is  grounded  in  Self-Determination  Theory 
(SDT [29]), which posits that individuals have three basic 

psychological  needs—autonomy,  competence,  and  relat-
edness—central  to  motivation  and  personality  develop-
ment  [30,  31].  Autonomy  refers  to  feeling  in  control  of 
one’s  actions,  competence  to  feeling  effective,  and  relat-
edness to feeling connected to others. When these needs 
are satisfied, individuals experience intrinsic motivation, 
characterized by enjoyment and volition, which enhances 
performance,  well-being,  and  persistence—particularly 
relevant  in  competitive  sports  [32,  33,  29].  However, 
unmet  needs  can  lead  to  stress  and  motivational  deple-
tion, increasing burnout risk [34].

Athletes  with  satisfied  needs  are  more  likely  to  be 
intrinsically  motivated,  buffering  against  stress  and 
reducing  burnout  [35,  32,  36],  whereas  those  feeling 
pressured  or  unsupported  may  face  diminished  moti-
vation  and  greater  burnout  risk  [14].  SDT  also  distin-
guishes between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, with 
autonomous  extrinsic  forms  (e.g.,  identified  regulation, 
where  activities  are  valued)  linked  to  better  well-being 
than controlled forms (e.g., external regulation, driven by 
rewards [30, 29, 31]).

Building  on  this,  our  study  examines  how  emotion 
regulation and coping strategies interact with motivation 
and  psychological  needs  to  influence  burnout.  Effective 
emotion regulation supports autonomy and competence 
by  sustaining  motivation  under  pressure  [37].  Adaptive 
coping,  such  as  positive  reframing  and  seeking  support, 
fosters  need  satisfaction  and  reduces  burnout  [36].  We 
hypothesize  that  athletes  with  strong  emotion  regula-
tion  and  adaptive  coping  will  better  satisfy  their  needs, 
enhancing  intrinsic  motivation  and  lowering  burnout 
[14, 34]. Those with poor regulation or maladaptive cop-
ing, however, may face unmet needs and increased burn-
out  risk  [28].  Through  SDT,  this  study  aims  to  deepen 
understanding  of  burnout  factors  and  inform  interven-
tions  for  promoting  athlete  well-being  and  sustainable 
sporting experiences.

Athlete burnout

Athlete burnout has become a critical concern in sports 
psychology,  manifesting  as  a  multifaceted  syndrome  of 
emotional  and  physical  exhaustion,  reduced  sense  of 
accomplishment, and sport devaluation [1, 5]. This con-
dition  threatens  athletes’  mental  health,  performance 
quality, and career longevity, driven by chronic stressors 
inherent  in  competitive  sports,  such  as  intense  training 
loads,  performance  pressures,  and  limited  control  over 
one’s  athletic  path  [38,  3].  Personal  factors,  like  perfec-
tionism,  amplify  susceptibility,  as  athletes  with  perfec-
tionist  tendencies  often  face  heightened  self-imposed 
pressure and an unyielding drive for excellence [13].

Smith’s  (1986)  Cognitive-Affective  Stress  Model  pro-
vides a foundational lens, suggesting burnout stems from 
a  persistent  mismatch  between  perceived  demands  and 

Zuo and Bai BMC Psychology         (2025) 13:1147 resources,  triggering  stress  appraisal  and  subsequent 
emotional  and  physical  responses  [12].  Raedeke  and 
Smith  (2001)  reinforced  this,  finding  that  athletes  with 
elevated  perceived  stress  reported  more  burnout  symp-
toms, emphasizing the pivotal role of cognitive appraisal 
[11].  Research  identifies  key  predictors,  including  over-
training,  competitive  anxiety,  and  insufficient  recovery 
[39],  while  social  support  serves  as  a  buffer,  lowering 
burnout risk [40, 14]. Conversely, a lack of support con-
sistently  heightens  burnout  symptoms,  highlighting  the 
need for a supportive athletic environment.

Beyond performance deficits, burnout’s impact extends 
to well-being. Affected athletes often experience depres-
sion,  anxiety,  and  diminished  quality  of  life  [4].  This 
sometimes  leads  to  sport  dropout—a  significant  loss  for 
both individuals and organizations [9]. Interventions typ-
ically  target  stress  management,  recovery,  and  balanced 
lifestyles.  Mindfulness-based  approaches  reduce  symp-
toms  by  fostering  present-moment  focus  [41].  Auton-
omy-supportive coaching also aligns sport with personal 
values  to  curb  burnout  risk  [34].  Glandorf  et  al.’s  (2023) 
systematic  review  links  burnout  to  mental  health  chal-
lenges  like  depression,  anxiety,  and  insomnia,  alongside 
reduced life satisfaction [8]. Crowell and Madigan (2022 
[42])  and  Olsson  et  al.  (2021  [43])  pinpoint  perfection-
ism—particularly  fear  of  negative  evaluation—as  a  key 
driver, amplifying stress and negative self-perceptions.

The  connection  to  physical  health  is  less  straightfor-
ward. Glandorf et al. (2023 [8]) noted mixed evidence for 
direct  effects.  However,  burnout  may  indirectly  impair 
health  by  decreasing  motivation  for  sleep,  nutrition, 
or  recovery  practices,  potentially  weakening  immunity 
and  raising  injury  risk.  Further  longitudinal  research  is 
needed  to  clarify  these  links,  focusing  on  markers  like 
immune  function  and  sleep  quality.  Protective  factors 
include  emotional  intelligence  (EQ).  EQ  bolsters  stress 
management  and  resilience  through  self-awareness  and 
social  skills  [44].  Supportive  coaching  that  emphasizes 
mastery goals and open communication is also protective 
[45].  Intrinsic  motivation  and  engagement  also  mitigate 
burnout.  They  foster  persistence  and  flow  states—opti-
mal  experiences  of  immersion—that  sustain  a  positive 
outlook [46].

In  conclusion,  athlete  burnout,  with  its  profound 
implications  for  mental  and  potentially  physical  health, 
demands  a  multifaceted  response.  Addressing  perfec-
tionism,  enhancing  emotional  intelligence,  cultivating 
supportive  coaching,  and  nurturing  intrinsic  motivation 
are  essential  strategies  to  build  resilience  and  prevent 
burnout, ensuring athletes maintain well-being and a sus-
tainable relationship with sport.

Emotion regulation

Emotion regulation, the ability to influence how we expe-
rience and express emotions [17, 23], stands as a key fac-
tor in mental fitness. It goes beyond suppressing negative 
emotions  to  strategically  managing  them  for  well-being 
and  performance.  Research  consistently  underscores 
cognitive  reappraisal—reframing  situations  to  adjust 
their  emotional  impact—as  an  effective  strategy.  It  is 
linked  to  reduced  negative  affect  and  greater  resilience 
[18,  47].  In  contrast,  suppression,  often  used  to  push 
emotions  aside,  tends  to  increase  physiological  stress 
and  emotional  strain  [48].  This  skill  extends  its  impact 
to  performance.  Athletes  adept  at  regulating  emotions 
under  pressure  perform  better  and  recover  faster  from 
setbacks  [19].  Similarly,  students  with  adaptive  regula-
tion strategies face less academic stress and achieve more 
[49], demonstrating its value across challenging contexts. 
Emotion  regulation  also  shapes  interpersonal  relation-
ships. Effective regulators enjoy more satisfying connec-
tions [50]. Reappraisal enhances conflict resolution [51], 
while  chronic  suppression  correlates  with  relational  dif-
ficulties [52].

The neural basis of emotion regulation involves the pre-
frontal cortex (PFC), which modulates amygdala activity 
during  reappraisal  to  temper  emotional  reactivity  [53, 
54].  Interventions  like  mindfulness-based  programs  and 
cognitive-behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  bolster  these  skills, 
fostering  resilience  through  present-moment  aware-
ness  and  healthier  reappraisal  habits  [55,  56].  In  sport 
psychology,  emotion  regulation  is  pivotal  in  preventing 
burnout—a  syndrome  of  exhaustion,  reduced  accom-
plishment, and sport devaluation [1]. Self-Determination 
Theory (SDT) frames this link, showing that athletes with 
intrinsic motivation and autonomy, supported by strong 
regulation,  experience  lower  burnout  [35,  32,  22].  Con-
versely,  those  driven  by  extrinsic  pressures  struggle  to 
manage emotions amid setbacks, increasing burnout risk 
[32].

Coping  strategies  further  influence  this  relationship. 
Adaptive  methods  like  problem-solving  and  social  sup-
port  mitigate  stress  and  burnout  [57,  58].  Maladaptive 
tactics  such  as  avoidance  or  rumination  intensify  emo-
tional  exhaustion  [58].  Interpersonal  emotion  regula-
tion highlights team dynamics. Supportive climates with 
emotionally adept teammates boost enjoyment and com-
mitment [22], creating a ripple effect of resilience. Mind-
fulness  training  offers  additional  promise.  It  enhances 
regulation  and  reduces  burnout  through  emotional 
acceptance [59, 60], especially in high-pressure situations 
where maintaining focus is critical.

In  conclusion,  emotion  regulation  equips  athletes  to 
navigate  the  emotional  demands  of  competitive  sport. 
By  fostering  intrinsic  motivation,  adaptive  coping,  sup-
portive  team  environments,  and  mindfulness,  coaches 

Zuo and Bai BMC Psychology         (2025) 13:1147 Page 4 of 16

and psychologists can strengthen these skills, enhancing 
performance and safeguarding mental well-being against 
burnout.

Coping strategies

Coping strategies, fundamental tools for managing stress 
and  navigating  life’s  challenges  [61,  25],  are  central  to 
psychological well-being. Research identifies two primary 
types:  problem-focused  and  emotion-focused.  Problem-
focused  coping  directly  addresses  stressors  through 
actions  like  planning,  seeking  information,  or  develop-
ing  skills  [26,  62],  consistently  linked  to  reduced  stress 
and  stronger  problem-solving  abilities  [63,  27,  64].  For 
controllable  stressors,  such  as  an  overwhelming  work-
load, this proactive approach is often most effective [65]. 
Conversely, emotion-focused coping manages emotional 
responses  via  strategies  like  social  support,  relaxation 
techniques, or cognitive reframing [66, 25, 67]. While less 
optimal for addressable stressors [68], it proves valuable 
when  stressors  are  unchangeable,  with  social  support 
notably enhancing resilience and reducing distress [69].

Effective stress management relies on flexibility. It inte-
grates both coping types to match specific stressors [70]. 
Studies  demonstrate  that  combining  problem-focused 
efforts, such as creating schedules, with emotion-focused 
tactics,  like  deep  breathing,  yields  better  outcomes  [71, 
72,  73].  Beyond  stress,  coping  influences  health  out-
comes.  Adaptive  strategies  improve  quality  of  life  and 
lower  distress  in  chronic  illness  [74,  75,  76,  77,  78].  In 
workplace  settings,  problem-focused  coping,  including 
time management and colleague support, boosts satisfac-
tion and curbs burnout [79, 80]. Maladaptive approaches 
like  avoidance  or  denial,  however,  increase  stress  and 
impair  performance  [81,  82,  83].  Cultural  factors  also 
shape  coping  preferences.  Collectivist  cultures  favor 
social support, while individualist ones emphasize prob-
lem-solving [84, 86], highlighting the need for culturally 
sensitive interventions.

For  athletes,  coping  strategies  are  critical  in  prevent-
ing  burnout—a  state  of  emotional  exhaustion,  cynicism, 
and  reduced  accomplishment  [1].  High  stress  strongly 
predicts  burnout  [15,  85],  underscoring  the  importance 
of  effective  coping.  Emotion  regulation  enhances  this 
process,  with  strategies  like  reappraisal  and  acceptance 
enabling  athletes  to  stay  composed  under  pressure  [87, 
88].  Problem-focused  coping,  such  as  seeking  solutions, 
reduces burnout risk [89, 28], whereas avoidance height-
ens  it  [28].  Perfectionism  adds  complexity:  self-oriented 
perfectionism  can  motivate  adaptive  coping  or,  through 
self-criticism,  exacerbate  burnout,  while  socially  pre-
scribed perfectionism, tied to external pressures, consis-
tently increases risk via anxiety and avoidance [89].

Motivation  and  team  dynamics  further  influence  this 
interplay,  with  intrinsic  motivation  and  hope  buffering 

stress  through  adaptive  coping  [90,  91,  92].  Supportive 
team  climates,  encouraging  communication  and  col-
laboration,  also  bolster  well-being  [88].  In  conclusion, 
coping  strategies  are  indispensable  in  combating  athlete 
burnout.  Promoting  problem-focused  coping,  a  growth 
mindset,  supportive  teams,  and  intrinsic  motivation 
equips  athletes  to  manage  stress  and  thrive  in  competi-
tive sports.

Methods
Participants

To  ensure  a  representative  sample  of  China’s  diverse 
athletic  population,  this  study  recruited  286  competi-
tive  athletes  through  collaborations  with  various  sport-
ing  organizations  across  different  provinces,  including 
Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Sichuan. We employed a strati-
fied sampling strategy to ensure adequate representation 
of  athletes  from  each  province.  Specifically,  we  collabo-
rated  with  provincial  sporting  organizations  to  identify 
eligible athletes and invite them to participate. To achieve 
a balanced gender distribution, we set recruitment quo-
tas for male and female athletes in each province.

These  athletes,  with  an  average  age  of  21.0  years 
(SD = 3.2)  and  ranging  from  18  to  28  years  old,  hailed 
from a balanced mix of genders (54% female, 46% male). 
To  capture  the  full  spectrum  of  training  demands  and 
competitive  pressures,  participants  were  recruited  from 
a variety of individual and team sports. Basketball (25%), 
Track  and  Field  (18%),  Swimming  (15%),  Gymnastics 
(12%),  and  Badminton  (10%)  were  the  most  prominent, 
with  other  sports  such  as  Volleyball,  Table  Tennis,  and 
Soccer making up the remaining 20%. Competition level 
also  varied,  with  15%  competing  at  the  national  level 
(championships or provincial teams), 30% at the regional 
level  (regional  competitions  or  provincial  leagues),  and 
55% at the city/provincial level within organized training 
programs.  All  participants  met  the  following  inclusion 
criteria: (a) aged between 18 and 28 years; (b) a minimum 
of one year’s experience in competitive training (average 
5.2 years, SD = 2.1, range 2–10 years); (c) currently injury-
free; (d) no history of diagnosed mental health disorders; 
and  (e)  actively  participating  in  organized  training  pro-
grams  and  competitions  at  the  city/provincial,  regional, 
or  national  level.  Athletes  who  were  unable  to  provide 
informed  consent  or  who  did  not  complete  the  full  bat-
tery of questionnaires were excluded from the study.

In addition to the 286 athletes who participated in the 
quantitative  phase  of  the  study,  a  subset  of  23  athletes 
was purposefully selected for semi-structured interviews. 
These athletes were chosen to represent a range of emo-
tion  regulation,  coping  strategies,  and  burnout  profiles, 
as  identified  in  the  quantitative  data.  This  purposive 
sampling  strategy  aimed  to  maximize  the  diversity  of 

Zuo and Bai BMC Psychology         (2025) 13:1147 Page 5 of 16

perspectives  and  experiences  captured  in  the  qualitative 
data.

The study protocol, adhering to ethical guidelines out-
lined by the Chinese Psychological Society, was approved 
by  the  Institutional  Review  Board  of  Hebei  North  Uni-
versity. Written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants,  and  the  study  procedures  ensured  partici-
pant confidentiality and anonymity throughout.

Instruments
Quantitative measures

To  assess  emotion  regulation,  the  Trait  Meta-Mood 
Scale (TMMS) developed by Salovey et al. [93] was used 
in  its  standard  three-subscale  form,  consisting  of  Emo-
tional  Attention,  Clarity,  and  Repair.  This  30-item  self-
report  questionnaire  measures  individuals’  typical  ways 
of attending to, clarifying, and repairing their emotions. 
Each subscale reflects a distinct aspect of emotion regu-
lation,  with  higher  scores  indicating  greater  use  of  that 
dimension.  The  TMMS  has  demonstrated  strong  inter-
nal  consistency  (Cronbach’s  alpha > 0.80)  and  construct 
validity  in  various  populations,  including  athletes  [94]. 
In this study, Cronbach’s alpha for Emotional  Attention, 
Clarity, and Repair ranged from 0.82 to 0.86.

Coping  strategies  were  assessed  using  the  Brief  COPE 
Inventory [95]. This 28-item measure comprises 14 sub-
scales, capturing different coping approaches: active cop-
ing,  planning,  positive  reframing,  acceptance,  humor, 
religion,  using  emotional  support,  using  instrumental 
support,  self-distraction,  denial,  venting,  substance  use, 
behavioral  disengagement,  and  self-blame.  Participants 
rated the frequency with which they employed each strat-
egy  on  a  4-point  Likert  scale  ranging  from  1  (I  haven’t 
been  doing  this  at  all)  to  4  (I’ve  been  doing  this  a  lot). 
The  Brief  COPE  is  a  widely  used  and  psychometrically 
sound  instrument  with  established  reliability  and  valid-
ity  across  diverse  samples  [95,  96].  In  the  present  study, 
Cronbach’s  alpha  ranged  from  0.71  to  0.84  for  the  Brief 
COPE subscales. While some values in the lower end of 
this  range  are  moderate,  they  are  consistent  with  prior 
research using this instrument. This is often attributed to 
the inherent brevity of its subscales, many of which con-
tain  only  two  items;  internal  consistency  estimates  like 
Cronbach’s  alpha  are  known  to  be  lower  for  scales  with 
fewer items [95].

Athlete  burnout  was  assessed  using  the  Reduced 
Exhaustion  Depression  and  Reduced  Accomplishment 
Scale (RED-A) by Raedeke and Smith [11]. This 10-item 
measure  specifically  targets  the  three  core  dimensions 
of  athlete  burnout:  emotional  exhaustion,  cynicism,  and 
reduced  sense  of  accomplishment.  Scores  on  each  sub-
scale  range  from  0  to  10,  with  higher  scores  indicating 
greater levels of burnout. The RED-A has been validated 
for  use  with  athletes  and  demonstrates  good  internal 

consistency  and  convergent  validity  with  other  burn-
out  measures  [97].  In  this  study,  Cronbach’s  alpha  for 
the  RED-A  subscales  were  0.85  for  emotional  exhaus-
tion,  0.78  for  cynicism,  and  0.81  for  reduced  sense  of 
accomplishment.

Qualitative instrument

In  addition  to  these  questionnaires,  a  semi-structured 
interview guide was developed to explore athletes’ expe-
riences with emotion regulation, coping, and burnout in 
more  depth.  The  interview  guide  included  open-ended 
questions about:

  • Emotion regulation strategies: “Can you describe 
how you typically manage your emotions during 
challenging competitions?”

  • Coping strategies: “What are some of the coping 
strategies you find most helpful when dealing with 
setbacks or pressure?”

  • Experiences of burnout: “Can you describe any 
experiences you’ve had with feeling burned out 
in your sport?” If the athlete indicated they had 
experienced burnout, the interviewer followed up 
with: “How did it affect your training, performance, 
and overall well-being?” If not, the interviewer asked: 
“What do you think has helped you avoid feeling 
burned out?”

  • Connections between emotions, coping, and 

burnout: “Can you share any specific examples 
of how your emotions and coping strategies have 
influenced your overall experience in your sport, 
particularly in relation to stress or burnout?”

Procedures

Participants  in  the  quantitative  phase  of  the  study  com-
pleted a battery of questionnaires online. A secure online 
platform  was  used  to  ensure  data  privacy  and  confiden-
tiality.  Participants  were  provided  with  a  unique  link  to 
access the questionnaires, which they could complete at 
their own convenience, either at their training facilities or 
at  home.  Clear  instructions  were  provided  at  the  begin-
ning of each questionnaire, and participants were able to 
contact the research team via email or phone if they had 
any  questions  or  concerns  during  the  completion  pro-
cess. The questionnaires were self-administered, allowing 
athletes  to  respond  at  their  own  pace  and  in  a  comfort-
able environment.

Following the completion of the quantitative phase, the 
23  athletes  selected  for  the  qualitative  phase  were  con-
tacted by a member of the research team to schedule an 
interview.  Interviews  were  conducted  in-person  at  the 
athletes’  training  facilities,  in  a  private  room  to  ensure 
confidentiality and minimize distractions. The interviews 
were conducted by trained research staff who followed a 

Zuo and Bai BMC Psychology         (2025) 13:1147 semi-structured  interview  guide.  The  interviewer  began 
by  establishing  rapport  with  the  athlete  and  explaining 
the  purpose  of  the  interview.  The  interviewer  then  pro-
ceeded with the interview questions, allowing for flexibil-
ity to probe further into interesting or relevant responses. 
All interviews were audio-recorded with the participants’ 
permission and later transcribed verbatim for analysis.

Data analysis

Data analysis for the quantitative phase of the study was 
conducted using SPSS (version 28). Descriptive statistics 
were  calculated  for  all  variables,  including  means,  stan-
dard  deviations,  and  frequencies.  To  examine  the  rela-
tionships between emotion regulation, coping strategies, 
and  athlete  burnout,  Pearson  correlation  coefficients 
were calculated. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis 
was employed to assess the predictive power of emotion 
regulation and coping strategies on athlete burnout, con-
trolling  for  demographic  variables  such  as  age,  gender, 
and type of sport.

Following  the  recommendations  of  Hayes  [98],  PRO-
CESS  macro  (version  4.0)  was  used  to  test  the  mediat-
ing  role  of  coping  strategies  in  the  relationship  between 
emotion  regulation  and  athlete  burnout.  Specifically,  we 
tested  a  parallel  mediation  model  with  multiple  media-
tors to examine the indirect effects of emotion regulation 
on  athlete  burnout  through  various  coping  strategies. 
Bootstrapping with 5,000 resamples was used to generate

95%  confidence  intervals  for  the  indirect  effects,  as  rec-
ommended by Hayes and Preacher [99].

The  qualitative  data  from  the  semi-structured  inter-
views  were  analyzed  using  thematic  analysis  [100]. 
Interviews  were  transcribed  verbatim  and  then  system-
atically  coded  to  identify  recurring  themes  and  patterns 
related to emotion regulation, coping strategies, and ath-
lete  burnout.  The  coding  process  involved  an  iterative 
approach,  with  two  researchers  independently  coding 
the transcripts and then comparing and discussing their 
codes to ensure consistency and reliability. Any discrep-
ancies  were  resolved  through  discussion  and  consensus. 
Data collection for the qualitative phase continued until 
theoretical saturation was achieved. This was determined 
when  no  new  codes  or  themes  emerged  from  succes-
sive  interviews,  indicating  that  additional  data  collec-
tion  would  likely  yield  redundant  information  regarding 
the  core  constructs  of  emotion  regulation,  coping  strat-
egies,  and  burnout  experiences  among  the  athletes.  For 
instance, after 18 interviews, the rate of new theme emer-
gence slowed considerably, and by the 23rd interview, no 
entirely  new  conceptual  categories  were  identified.  The 
identified  themes  were  then  organized  into  a  coherent 
narrative that captured the key findings from the qualita-
tive data.

Findings
Quantitative section

Descriptive statistics for the key study variables are pre-
sented in Table 1, which includes the three emotion reg-
ulation  subscales  of  the  TMMS  (Emotional  Attention, 
Clarity,  Repair),  coping  strategies  from  the  Brief  COPE, 
and the burnout dimensions from the RED-A.

To  examine  the 

interrelationships  between  emo-
tion  regulation,  coping  strategies,  and  athlete  burnout, 
we  first  conducted  correlational  analyses.  As  shown  in 
Table 1, several TMMS subscales were positively associ-
ated  with  adaptive  coping  strategies.  Specifically,  Emo-
tional  Attention  was  positively  associated  with  Active 
Coping  (r = .52,  p < .001),  indicating  that  athletes  who 
pay  more  attention  to  their  emotions  tend  to  use  more 
direct,  problem-focused  strategies.  Emotional  Atten-
tion was also positively associated with Planning (r = .48, 
p < .001),  Positive  Reframing  (r = .60,  p < .001),  and  Using 
Emotional  Support  (r = .55,  p < .001).  Clarity  was  posi-
tively correlated with Planning (r = .45, p < .001), Positive 
Reframing (r = .58, p < .001), and Acceptance (Brief COPE 
subscale)  (r = .40,  p < .001).  Repair  showed  positive  asso-
ciations  with  Using  Emotional  Support  (r = .42,  p < .001) 
and Using Instrumental Support (r = .38, p < .001).

Conversely,  maladaptive  coping  strategies  such  as 
Denial  and  Self-Blame  were  positively  associated  with 
Emotional  Exhaustion 
(r = .35,  p < .001  and  r = .42, 
p < .001,  respectively)  and  Cynicism  (r = .28,  p < .01  and

r = .35,  p < .001,  respectively).  These  initial  findings  sug-
gest  that  the  way  athletes  manage  emotions  and  stress 
plays a role in how burnout symptoms unfold.

We  further  investigated  these  relationships  through  a 
hierarchical  multiple  regression  analysis,  controlling  for 
demographic variables (age, gender, and type of sport) in 
Step 1. Table 2 presents the regression results.

In  Step  1,  the  demographic  variables  explained  5% 
of  the  variance  in  burnout  (R²  =  0.05,  F(3,  282) = 4.85, 
p < .01).  Being  older  and  female  was  associated  with 
higher burnout. After adding the three TMMS subscales 
in Step 2 (Emotional Attention, Clarity, and Repair), the 
model significantly improved (ΔR² = 0.21, p < .001), with 
Clarity  and  Repair  showing  negative  associations  with 
burnout, whereas Emotional Attention was not a signifi-
cant predictor at this stage. In Step 3, adding the 14 cop-
ing  strategies  (Brief  COPE  subscales)  brought  the  total 
explained variance to 44% (ΔR² = 0.18, p < .001). Among 
the  coping  strategies,  Planning,  Positive  Reframing,  and 
Using Emotional Support were negatively linked to burn-
out, whereas Denial, Venting, and Self-Blame were posi-
tively linked to burnout.

A  subsequent  mediation  analysis  using  PROCESS 
macro  (version  4.0)  examined  whether  coping  strategies 

mediated  the  relationships  between  emotion  regulation 
dimensions  (Clarity,  Repair)  and  burnout.  Table  3  sum-
marizes the significant indirect effects:

Findings  indicated  that  Positive  Reframing  partially 
mediated  the  inverse  relationship  between  Clarity  and 
burnout,  suggesting  that  athletes  who  clearly  identify 
their  emotions  may  be  more  likely  to  reinterpret  stress-
ful experiences in constructive ways. Meanwhile, Denial 
and  Self-Blame  emerged  as  mediators  of  the  negative 
association between Repair and burnout; in other words, 
athletes who struggle to recover from negative emotional 
states  may  rely  more  on  maladaptive  coping,  escalating 
their burnout risk. These results underscore the indirect 
yet pivotal role of coping in shaping how emotion regu-
lation  capacities  translate  into  lower  or  higher  burnout 
among competitive athletes.

Qualitative section

Thematic analysis of the semi-structured interviews, fol-
lowing  the  six-phase  approach  outlined  by  Braun  and 
Clarke (2006), yielded four overarching themes that pro-
vide  deeper  insights  into  the  quantitative  findings:  (1) 
Emotion Regulation as a Dynamic Process, (2) The Inter-
play  of  Coping  Strategies,  (3)  The  Lived  Experience  of 
Burnout,  and  (4)  The  Social  Construction  of  Resilience 
and Vulnerability.

Emotion regulation as a dynamic process

The interviews revealed that emotion regulation is not a 
static  trait  but  rather  a  dynamic  process  that  unfolds  in 
response to the ongoing demands and challenges of com-
petitive sports. Athletes described actively engaging with 

Zuo and Bai BMC Psychology         (2025) 13:1147 Page 8 of 16

their  emotions,  utilizing  a  combination  of  cognitive  and 
behavioral  strategies  to  monitor,  evaluate,  and  modify 
their  emotional  responses.  This  dynamic  process  was 
characterized by both proactive and reactive strategies.

Proactive emotion regulation involved anticipating and 
preparing for emotionally challenging situations. Athletes 
described  using  techniques  like  mental  imagery,  goal 
setting,  and  self-talk  to  manage  their  emotions  before 
and  during  competitions.  For  instance,  a  national-level 
badminton  player  shared,  “Before  a  big  match,  I  always 
take  some  time  to  visualize  myself  on  the  court.  I  pic-
ture  myself  staying  calm  and  focused,  even  if  I’m  facing 
a tough opponent or the crowd is loud. This helps me to 
control  my  nerves  and  play  my  best.”  (Athlete  21).  This 
athlete’s proactive use of mental imagery highlights how 
athletes can prepare themselves emotionally for challeng-
ing situations.

Reactive  emotion  regulation 

involved  responding 
to  emotions  as  they  arose.  A  regional-level  basketball 
player  explained  how  he  uses  reappraisal  to  manage  his 
frustration  after  a  missed  shot:  “When  I  miss,  I  used  to 
get really down on myself. But now, I try to reframe the 
situation.  I  tell  myself  that  missing  a  shot  is  part  of  the 
game, and that it’s more important to focus on the next 
play and what I can learn from the mistake.” (Athlete 8). 
This athlete’s ability to reappraise setbacks demonstrates 
the  adaptive  nature  of  reactive  emotion  regulation. 
Another  athlete,  a  national-level  swimmer,  spoke  about 
the  importance  of  accepting  difficult  emotions:  “Some-
times I feel overwhelmed by the pressure to perform. In 
the past, I would try to push those feelings away, but I’ve 
learned  that  it’s  better  to  acknowledge  them  and  accept 
that it’s okay to feel that way. It actually helps me to move 
forward.” (Athlete 12).

However, the regulatory process was not always a clear 
choice between a successful adaptive strategy and a mal-
adaptive one. Many athletes described being in ambigu-
ous,  transitional  states  where  they  struggled  to  apply 
coping  skills  effectively.  This  “messy  middle  ground” 
highlights the difficulty of managing persistent stress. For 
example, a regional-level volleyball player who was strug-
gling with confidence after being benched explained:

“My  coach  told  me  to  ‘focus  on  the  process’  and  stay 
positive, and I tried. I really did. I’d do the self-talk, you 
know,  ‘You’ve  got  this,  you’ll  get  back  out  there.’  Some 
days  it  would  help  me  get  through  practice.  But  other 
days,  it  just  felt  hollow,  like  I  was  lying  to  myself.  So  I’d 
end  up  just  putting  on  my  headphones  and  blasting 
music on the way home, trying to not think about it at all. 
It wasn’t really denial, but it wasn’t exactly facing it either. 
I was just… stuck in the middle, trying to function.” (Ath-
lete  15).  This  narrative  captures  an  ambiguous  regula-
tory state, where an athlete attempts an adaptive strategy 
(self-talk) but, finding it only partially effective, shifts to 

a  more  neutral,  numbing  strategy  (distraction)  without 
fully committing to avoidance or denial.

Nevertheless,  not  all  athletes  with  strong  Repair  skills 
consistently  managed  their  emotions  effectively.  A 
national-level  gymnast  described  struggling  after  a  sig-
nificant setback: “I’m usually good at getting over things 
quickly,  but  after  bombing  that  routine  at  nationals,  I 
couldn’t let it go. I kept pushing it out of my mind, pre-
tending  it  didn’t  happen,  and  that  just  left  me  feeling 
more  drained  and  distant  from  the  sport.”  (Athlete  14). 
This  athlete’s  avoidance  of  emotional  processing  reflects 
a  reliance  on  Denial,  which  may  heighten  burnout  risk 
despite generally effective Repair abilities.

The  effectiveness  of  these  strategies  varied  depending 
on  the  individual  athlete,  the  specific  situation,  and  the 
nature  of  the  emotions  involved.  However,  athletes  who 
demonstrated greater emotional awareness and flexibility 
in their emotion regulation approaches tended to report 
lower levels of burnout and greater well-being. This find-
ing  aligns  with  the  quantitative  results,  which  showed  a 
significant negative association between emotion regula-
tion and burnout.

The interplay of coping strategies

Athletes described utilizing a diverse repertoire of coping 
strategies to navigate the stressors and challenges of com-
petitive  sports.  The  interviews  highlighted  the  interplay 
between  different  coping  strategies,  with  athletes  often 
employing  a  combination  of  problem-focused,  emotion-
focused, and avoidance-focused coping.

Problem-focused  coping  involved  taking  active  steps 
to  address  the  source  of  stress.  A  city/provincial-level 
track  and  field  athlete  explained  how  she  uses  planning 
to manage her demanding training schedule: “When I’m 
facing a difficult training regimen, it can feel overwhelm-
ing.  So  I  break  it  down  into  smaller,  more  manageable 
goals.  This  helps  me  stay  motivated  and  focused,  and  it 
feels less daunting.” (Athlete 3). This athlete’s use of plan-
ning demonstrates how problem-focused coping can help 
athletes manage challenges effectively.

Emotion-focused coping involved regulating emotional 
responses  to  stress.  Athletes  described  using  strategies 
like seeking social support, positive reframing, and emo-
tional  expression  to  manage  their  feelings.  A  regional-
level  gymnast  emphasized  the  importance  of  social 
support: “When I’m feeling stressed or anxious before a 
competition,  I  talk  to  my  teammates  or  my  coach. They 
always listen and offer support, which helps me feel bet-
ter  and  more  prepared.”  (Athlete  17).  This  athlete’s  reli-
ance on her social support network highlights the role of 
emotion-focused coping in managing stress.

Avoidance-focused 

involved  disengaging 
coping 
from  the  stressor.  A  national-level  swimmer  admitted 
to  occasionally  using  avoidance  to  cope  with  pressure: 

Zuo and Bai BMC Psychology         (2025) 13:1147 Page 9 of 16

“Sometimes, when the pressure gets really intense, I just 
try to ignore it and pretend it’s not there. It’s like I’m try-
ing to escape from it all for a little while. But I know that’s 
not  always  the  best  way  to  deal  with  things  in  the  long 
run.” (Athlete 12). This athlete’s awareness of the limita-
tions of avoidance-focused coping underscores the com-
plexities of coping in high-pressure environments.

Athletes  also  revealed  how  maladaptive  coping  could 
emerge  even  among  those  with  adaptive  tendencies.  A 
regional-level  track  athlete  noted:  “I’m  usually  pretty 
good  at  staying  positive,  but  when  I  don’t  hit  my  times, 
I  start  thinking  it’s  all  my  fault—like  I  didn’t  train  hard 
enough or I’m just not cut out for this. That self-criticism 
wears  me  down  and  makes  it  tougher  to  keep  going.” 
(Athlete  7).  This  experience  shows  how  Self-Blame  can 
creep  in  despite  generally  strong  emotion  regulation, 
potentially linking Repair efforts to increased burnout.

The  qualitative  data  revealed  that  the  effectiveness 
of  coping  strategies  depended  not  only  on  the  type  of 
strategy  used  but  also  on  the  context  and  the  individu-
al’s needs. While problem-focused and emotion-focused 
coping were generally associated with positive outcomes, 
avoidance-focused coping tended to be less effective and, 
in some cases, even detrimental. This finding aligns with 
the  quantitative  results,  which  showed  that  changes  in 
coping  strategies  moderated  the  relationship  between 
emotion regulation and burnout.

The lived experience of burnout

The interviews provided rich insights into the lived expe-
rience of burnout among athletes. Burnout was described 
as  a  multifaceted  phenomenon  encompassing  physical, 
emotional,  and  cognitive  exhaustion,  as  well  as  feelings 
of  cynicism,  detachment,  and  reduced  accomplishment. 
Athletes’  narratives  revealed  the  pervasive  impact  of 
burnout on various aspects of their lives, including their 
athletic  performance,  relationships,  and  overall  sense  of 
self.

A regional-level swimmer described the emotional toll 
of  burnout:  “It’s  like  a  feeling  of  emptiness  and  disillu-
sionment. It’s like I’ve lost my passion for the sport, and 
nothing seems to matter anymore. I used to love compet-
ing,  but  now  it  just  feels  like  a  chore.”  (Athlete  5).  This 
athlete’s  experience  highlights  the  emotional  exhaustion 
and loss of motivation that often accompany burnout.

Another  athlete,  a  national-level  badminton  player, 
described  the  cognitive  impact  of  burnout:  “When  I’m 
burned  out,  I  feel  like  I’m  on  autopilot.  I’m  just  going 
through  the  motions  in  training,  and  I  don’t  have  the 
same energy or enthusiasm. It’s hard to focus, and I make 
careless mistakes that I wouldn’t normally make.” (Athlete 
21). This athlete’s experience demonstrates how burnout 
can affect cognitive functioning and performance.

A  city/provincial-level  gymnast  shared  how  burnout 
affected her relationships: “When I’m feeling burned out, 
I  tend  to  withdraw  from  my  friends  and  family.  I  don’t 
feel  like  socializing,  and  I  just  want  to  be  alone.  It’s  like 
I’m  putting  up  a  wall  between  myself  and  the  people  I 
care  about.”  (Athlete  17).  This  athlete’s  experience  illus-
trates the social isolation that can result from burnout.

The  qualitative  data  also  highlighted  the  individual 
variability in the experience of burnout. A national-level 
track and field athlete described a sudden onset of burn-
out: “It was like flipping a switch. One day I was feeling 
fine, and the next day I was completely drained. I had no 
energy,  no  motivation,  and  I  just  wanted  to  quit.”  (Ath-
lete  19).  In  contrast,  a  regional-level  basketball  player 
described a more gradual decline: “It was a slow burn. I 
started to feel more and more tired, and my performance 
started  to  slip.  It  took  me  a  while  to  realize  that  I  was 
burned out.” (Athlete 10). This variability underscores the 
importance  of  individualized  approaches  to  prevention 
and intervention.

The social construction of resilience and vulnerability

The interviews revealed the significant role of the social 
environment  in  shaping  athletes’  experiences  of  emo-
tion regulation, coping, and burnout. The qualitative data 
highlighted the social construction of resilience and vul-
nerability, with athletes’ interactions with coaches, team-
mates, family, and friends influencing their ability to cope 
with stress and adversity.

Supportive  relationships  were  described  as  a  crucial 
protective factor against burnout. Athletes who felt sup-
ported  by  their  social  network  reported  feeling  more 
confident,  motivated,  and  resilient  in  the  face  of  chal-
lenges.  A  city/provincial-level  basketball  player  spoke 
about  the  positive  influence  of  his  coach:  “My  coach  is 
like a mentor to me. He pushes me to be my best, but he 
also understands when I need support. He creates a safe 
space for us to talk about our struggles, and he always has 
our  backs.  I  know  I  can  always  count  on  him.”  (Athlete 
10).  This  athlete’s  experience  demonstrates  how  a  sup-
portive coach can foster resilience and well-being.

Conversely,  unsupportive  or  negative  relationships 
were  identified  as  contributing  factors  to  burnout.  Ath-
letes who felt pressured, criticized, or neglected by their 
social network reported feeling more vulnerable to stress 
and burnout. A national-level track and field athlete con-
fided in the interviewer about the pressure she felt from 
her  parents:  “I  feel  like  my  parents  put  a  lot  of  pressure 
on me to succeed. They mean well, but they don’t always 
understand  the  challenges  I’m  facing,  and  it  makes  me 
feel isolated and alone.” (Athlete 19). This athlete’s experi-
ence highlights how unsupportive relationships can con-
tribute to feelings of vulnerability and burnout.

Zuo and Bai BMC Psychology         (2025) 13:1147 Page 10 of 16

Another athlete, a regional-level swimmer, spoke about 
the  negative  impact  of  comparing  herself  to  others  on 
social  media:  “Sometimes  I  scroll  through  social  media 
and see other swimmers who seem to be doing so much 
better than me. It makes me feel inadequate and like I’m 
not  good  enough.  It’s  a  constant  reminder  of  my  short-
comings.” (Athlete 5). This athlete’s experience illustrates 
how  social  comparison  can  contribute  to  negative  self-
evaluation and vulnerability.

These  findings  underscore  the  importance  of  creat-
ing positive and supportive social environments for ath-
letes. Coaches, teammates, family members, and friends 
can  play  a  vital  role  in  fostering  resilience  and  protect-
ing athletes from burnout. By providing encouragement, 
understanding,  and  a  safe  space  for  athletes  to  express 
themselves, they can help athletes navigate the challenges 
of competitive sports and maintain their well-being.

Overall,  the  qualitative  findings  enrich  the  quantita-
tive  mediation  results  by  showing  how  athletes  with 
strong Repair skills may still experience burnout through 
maladaptive  coping.  For  example,  Athlete  14’s  use  of 
Denial  after  a  competition  failure  and  Athlete  7’s  ten-
dency toward Self-Blame despite adaptive efforts mirror 
the  indirect  effects  identified  in  the  mediation  analysis 
(Table  3),  where  Denial  and  Self-Blame  link  Repair  to 
higher  burnout. These  narratives  highlight  the  complex, 
context-dependent  nature  of  emotion  regulation  and 
coping among competitive athletes, reinforcing the need 
for interventions that target both adaptive and maladap-
tive strategies.

Discussion
The current study employed a mixed-methods approach 
to  explore  the  intricate  relationships  between  emo-
tion  regulation,  coping  strategies,  and  burnout  among 
Chinese  competitive  athletes.  Quantitative  findings 
revealed  that  specific  dimensions  of  emotion  regula-
tion,  particularly  emotional  clarity  and  repair,  along-
side  adaptive  coping  strategies  like  positive  reframing 
and  emotional  support,  were  strongly  linked  to  reduced 
burnout  levels.  In  contrast,  maladaptive  strategies  such 
as denial and self-blame showed a significant association 
with  increased  burnout  symptoms,  including  emotional 
exhaustion  and  cynicism.  Complementing  these  results, 
qualitative  insights  provided  a  deeper  understanding  by 
illuminating  the  dynamic  nature  of  emotion  regulation, 
the  interplay  of  various  coping  methods,  and  the  lived 
experiences  of  athletes  facing  burnout.  This  cohesive 
narrative  integrates  these  findings  with  existing  litera-
ture, clarifies their theoretical implications, and proposes 
practical strategies to mitigate athlete burnout, ensuring 
a smooth flow of ideas with effective transitions.

Emotional  clarity,  defined  as  the  ability  to  recognize, 
label,  and  understand  one’s  feelings  [93],  emerged  as 

a  key  protective  factor  against  burnout.  This  capacity 
underpins  adaptive  self-regulation,  enabling  athletes  to 
quickly detect distress signals and respond appropriately 
[17,  47].  When  athletes  accurately  interpret  their  emo-
tional  states,  they  can  address  performance  setbacks  or 
interpersonal  conflicts  constructively.  This  reduces  con-
fusion  and  prevents  burnout  escalation  [101].  Similarly, 
emotional  repair—the  ability  to  recover  from  negative 
affective states—proved equally vital. Techniques such as 
reframing adverse events or engaging in positive self-talk 
[19] empower athletes to shift away from spiraling nega-
tivity. By focusing on strengths or controllable solutions, 
they  effectively  counteract  emotional  exhaustion  and 
cynicism [54], mirroring findings from resilience studies 
in  workplace  settings  where  high  emotion  repair  corre-
lates with fewer burnout symptoms [79].

Interestingly,  the  role  of  mood  awareness,  or  Emo-
tional  Attention,  presented  a  more  complex  picture 
than  expected.  Our  finding  that  it  did  not  directly  pre-
dict burnout (β = 0.03, p > .05) seems to contradict litera-
ture  suggesting  awareness  is  a  foundational  component 
of  regulation.  However,  we  hypothesize  that  emotional 
attention  operates  as  a  “double-edged  sword,”  where  its 
effect  on  burnout  is  conditional  on  an  athlete’s  other 
regulatory skills—a possibility that a simple linear model 
may not capture. Specifically, high emotional attention in 
the  absence  of  strong  emotional  clarity  and  repair  skills 
may be counterproductive. Without the ability to under-
stand  and  manage  emotions,  paying  close  attention  to 
them can devolve into maladaptive rumination, where an 
athlete gets “stuck” on negative feelings of failure or anxi-
ety without a clear path forward [24, 102]. This obsessive 
focus  can  amplify  distress  and  deplete  the  very  mental 
resources  needed  to  prevent  burnout.  Conversely,  when 
high  emotional  attention  is  paired  with  strong  clarity 
and repair abilities, it likely facilitates adaptive emotional 
processing,  allowing  an  athlete  to  accurately  diagnose 
and  respond  to  their  feelings.  This  suggests  that  emo-
tional attention is not beneficial in and of itself, but only 
when it serves as the first step in a successful regulatory 
sequence. Future research should therefore explicitly test 
for  an  interaction  effect,  examining  whether  emotional 
repair  and  clarity  moderate  the  relationship  between 
emotional attention and burnout.

Transitioning  to  coping  strategies,  the  study  high-
lighted  the  protective  power  of  adaptive  approaches. 
Positive  reframing  stood  out  as  a  critical  mechanism, 
enabling  athletes  with  strong  emotional  clarity  to  rein-
terpret  stressors  constructively,  thereby  preserving  psy-
chological  resources  for  performance  [49]  and  shielding 
against  persistent  stress  [26].  Likewise,  social  and  emo-
tional  support  served  as  a  vital  buffer,  offering  athletes 
avenues to vent concerns, gain perspective, and feel vali-
dated  [27].  The  Brief  COPE  subscale  ‘Using  Emotional

Support’ demonstrated a significant negative association 
with burnout (β = − 0.14, p < .05), underscoring its stand-
alone  protective  effect.  Although  not  tested  as  a  media-
tor,  this  direct  influence  suggests  potential  for  future 
studies  to  explore  whether  social  support  mediates  or 
moderates  the  emotion  regulation-burnout  link,  enrich-
ing theoretical models.

In  contrast,  maladaptive  coping  strategies  like  denial 
and  self-blame  intensified  burnout  symptoms.  Denial 
might  provide  temporary  respite  but  ultimately  hinders 
proactive  problem-solving  [68].  Self-blame,  meanwhile, 
fuels  self-criticism  that  undermines  confidence  and 
heightens  negative  affect  [13].  These  patterns  align  with 
prior research linking such strategies to increased drop-
out rates, mental distress, and reduced performance [9]. 
Athletes trapped in cycles of self-criticism after poor per-
formances often fail to seek support or develop solutions, 
exacerbating their challenges [103].

The  mixed-methods  framework  enriched  this  analy-
sis by offering a holistic view of emotion regulation and 
coping  in  daily  athletic  life.  Qualitative  data  revealed 
athletes  employing  proactive  strategies—such  as  visual-
izing success or using self-talk to boost confidence—that 
echo cognitive-behavioral techniques [41, 55]. These pre-
emptive  measures  buffer  emotional  disruptions,  prepar-
ing  athletes  to  tackle  competitive  pressures  with  clarity. 
Conversely,  reactive  strategies  like  mindfulness-based 
acceptance proved effective during acute stress [104, 56], 
allowing athletes to reframe setbacks as growth opportu-
nities.  Crucially,  the  interviews  also  captured  the  mess-
ier  reality  of  this  process,  illustrating  the  transitional  or 
ambiguous  states  where  athletes  attempted  adaptive 
strategies that felt only partially successful, leaving them 
feeling  ‘stuck  in  the  middle’  (Athlete  15).  Interviews 
further  showcased  the  fluidity  of  coping,  with  athletes 
blending  problem-focused,  emotion-focused,  and  avoid-
ance-based tactics to suit specific contexts [70, 71]. This 
highlights  the  value  of  a  versatile  coping  “toolkit”  over 
rigid approaches [28].

Social  environments  played  a  pivotal  role  in  shaping 
burnout  trajectories.  Supportive  coaches,  teammates, 
and families acted as critical buffers [40, 22], reinforcing 
athletes’  competence  and  worth  [14].  However,  to  fully 
understand  these  dynamics,  it  is  essential  to  interpret 
our  findings  through  a  specific  Chinese  cultural  lens,  as 
suggested  by  cultural-contextual  models  of  coping  [84]. 
Key  cultural  values,  such  as  collectivism,  the  concept 
of  “face”  (面子,  miànzi),  and  high  familial  expectations, 
likely influence the psychological processes we observed. 
For  example,  the  strong  link  between  self-blame  and 
burnout may be amplified in a collectivist context where 
individual  failure  can  be  perceived  as  letting  down  the 
team  or  family,  thereby  causing  a  collective  loss  of  face. 
This  pressure  can  lead  athletes  to  harshly  internalize 

setbacks  rather  than  attribute  them  to  external  factors. 
Similarly,  the  role  of  social  support  in  collectivistic  cul-
tures  can  be  complex;  while  support  is  highly  valued, 
explicitly  seeking  help  for  emotional  struggles  may  be 
avoided  to  maintain  group  harmony  or  to  not  appear 
weak  [86].  This  cultural  script  could  explain  why  some 
athletes  in  our  interviews  struggled  in  silence,  and  why 
those who did find a safe space to share concerns found 
it so profoundly protective. Furthermore, our qualitative 
theme  of  pressure  from  parents  and  peers  reflects  the 
immense emphasis on collective success within the high-
performance  Chinese  sporting  system  [6,  7].  Success  is 
often  viewed  not  just  as  a  personal  achievement  but  as 
a  reflection  of  family  honor,  repaying  parental  sacrifice. 
While  this  can  be  a  powerful  motivator,  it  transforms 
performance  into  a  heavy  obligation,  increasing  the  risk 
of  emotional  exhaustion  when  expectations  are  not  met 
[60].  These  cultural  interpretations  do  not  change  our 
core findings but enrich them, suggesting that the path-
ways  between  emotion  regulation,  coping,  and  burnout 
are not universal but are shaped by deep-seated cultural 
values and social structures.

Notably, 

the  final  hierarchical  regression  model 
explained  45%  of  burnout  variance,  reflecting  the  com-
bined  influence  of  emotion  regulation,  coping,  and 
demographics  [103,  32].  This  substantial  figure  aligns 
with theoretical frameworks of emotion regulation [101] 
and  coping  [26,  27],  indicating  that  targeted  interven-
tions—like cognitive-behavioral training or psychoeduca-
tion—could markedly reduce burnout risk. These results 
also resonate with Self-Determination Theory [29], which 
posits  that  environments  promoting  autonomy,  com-
petence,  and  relatedness  fortify  athletes  against  chronic 
stress [32, 35].

Demographic  differences  further  nuanced  these  find-
ings,  with  older  and  female  athletes  exhibiting  higher 
burnout  rates,  consistent  with  prior  studies  [39,  15]. 
Older  athletes  may  grapple  with  cumulative  training 
loads,  injuries,  or  external  demands  [105],  while  female 
athletes  face  sociocultural  pressures  and  structural  dis-
parities [35]. These patterns emphasize the need for tai-
lored  stress-management  programs  by  age  and  gender 
[106],  with  future  research  probing  interactions  with 
competition level or traits like perfectionism [13].

Ultimately,  this  study  advances  our  understanding  of 
how  emotion  regulation  and  coping  strategies  converge 
to influence burnout in Chinese competitive athletes. By 
weaving  together  quantitative  and  qualitative  evidence, 
it underscores the importance of prevention efforts that 
account for individual differences in regulatory skills and 
coping styles, as well as the wider social and cultural con-
text. This integrated perspective clarifies how to identify 
at-risk  athletes  and  equip  them  with  psychological  tools

to  maintain  performance,  well-being,  and  a  rewarding 
athletic career.

burnout, reinforce coping strategies, and ensure that ath-
letes receive timely support.

Implications

A  more  effective  approach  to  reducing  burnout  among 
competitive athletes involves integrating emotional regu-
lation training, adaptive coping strategies, social support, 
and culturally attuned interventions into existing training 
programs.  Rather  than  merely  encouraging  athletes  to 
“stay positive,” interventions should prioritize developing 
emotional  clarity  and  repair  by  equipping  athletes  with 
concrete  strategies  for  recognizing  and  labeling  their 
emotions,  identifying  negative  thought  patterns,  and 
implementing  rapid  recovery  techniques.  Guided  reap-
praisal exercises, for instance, can help athletes shift their 
perspective  on  stressful  situations  in  real  time,  allowing 
them  to  manage  performance-related  anxiety  and  emo-
tional  setbacks  more  effectively.  This  approach  is  par-
ticularly  beneficial  for  those  who  experience  persistent 
negative  moods  or struggle to recover  emotionally from 
poor performances.

Alongside  emotional  regulation 

training,  athletes 
should  be  encouraged  to  cultivate  a  diverse  and  flex-
ible  repertoire  of  coping  strategies  that  can  be  adapted 
to  different  stressors.  Coaches,  sport  psychologists,  and 
trainers can facilitate structured workshops that empha-
size  both  problem-focused  and  emotion-focused  cop-
ing. This ensures that athletes can respond effectively to 
anticipated challenges as well as unpredictable setbacks. 
By incorporating practical skills drills—such as develop-
ing  contingency  plans  for  high-stakes  competitions  or 
practicing  immediate  cognitive  reframing  of  mistakes—
athletes  can  learn  to  apply  these  strategies  instinctively 
under pressure. Encouraging a problem-solving mindset 
while  also  promoting  constructive  emotional  expres-
sion can enhance resilience and reduce the likelihood of 
athletes  resorting  to  avoidance-based  coping,  which  has 
been linked to higher burnout.

Beyond  individual  coping  strategies,  the  role  of  social 
support  in  mitigating  burnout  cannot  be  overstated. 
Creating a team environment that fosters open commu-
nication and mutual encouragement may serve as a pro-
tective  buffer  against  both  acute  and  chronic  stressors. 
Implementing  peer-based  check-in  sessions,  where  ath-
letes can safely share their concerns, may help normalize 
discussions  around  emotional  struggles  and  encourage 
proactive stress management. Furthermore, coaches who 
model  supportive  and  nonjudgmental  feedback  can  cre-
ate  an  atmosphere  in  which  athletes  feel  comfortable 
seeking  assistance  early,  rather  than  suppressing  their 
struggles.  Simple  strategies,  such  as  incorporating  brief 
one-on-one check-ins during intense training cycles, can 
provide  valuable  opportunities  to  identify  early  signs  of 

The findings of this study also highlight the importance 
of  considering  cultural  and  demographic  nuances  when 
designing  interventions  for  burnout  prevention.  Given 
that many Chinese athletes experience unique pressures 
related  to  social  comparison,  familial  expectations,  and 
the  collectivist  nature  of  their  sporting  environments, 
targeted  educational  sessions  for  parents  and  key  stake-
holders  could  help  mitigate  these  stressors.  Educating 
families on how to provide motivational support without 
excessive  pressure  may  help  athletes  develop  a  healthier 
relationship  with  competition.  Additionally,  screen-
ing  older  athletes  or  those  transitioning  from  junior  to 
senior levels may be critical in identifying individuals at 
a heightened risk for chronic stress and burnout. Imple-
menting  interventions  that  align  with  cultural  values, 
such  as  group-based  mindfulness  sessions  or  team-ori-
ented  coping  strategies,  may  enhance  engagement  and 
effectiveness.  By  tailoring  interventions  to  the  specific 
psychological and social realities faced by athletes, sport 
organizations  and  practitioners  can  take  meaningful 
steps toward reducing burnout while fostering long-term 
well-being and sustained performance.

Limitations and future directions

A key limitation of this study is the cross-sectional design 
of  the  quantitative  phase.  As  a  result,  the  relationships 
identified,  particularly  within  the  mediation  model, 
should  be  interpreted  as  associations  rather  than  causal 
pathways. While our analysis suggests that coping strat-
egies  may  explain  the  link  between  emotion  regulation 
and  burnout,  we  cannot  confirm  the  direction  of  these 
effects. For instance, it is plausible that heightened burn-
out could lead athletes to adopt more maladaptive coping 
strategies  over  time.  To  establish  causality  with  greater 
confidence, future research should adopt stronger meth-
odological designs.

A longitudinal study, for example, could track athletes 
at multiple points throughout a competitive season. Such 
a  design  would  allow  researchers  to  determine  tempo-
ral  precedence—that  is,  whether  changes  in  emotion 
regulation  and  coping  strategies  consistently  precede 
changes  in  burnout  symptoms.  Furthermore,  an  experi-
mental  approach,  such  as  a  randomized  controlled  trial 
(RCT),  would  provide  the  most  rigorous  test  of  causal-
ity.  Researchers  could  design  an  intervention  that  trains 
one group of athletes in adaptive coping skills (e.g., posi-
tive  reframing)  and  compare  their  burnout  levels  post-
intervention  to  a  control  group  that  did  not  receive  the 
training. This would offer direct evidence of the strategy’s 
protective effect.

A second methodological limitation concerns the mea-
surement of coping strategies. In terms of measurement,

lifespan  perspective,  conducting  comparative  studies  to 
map how the risk factors for burnout and the most effec-
tive coping strategies evolve from an athlete’s early career 
through to retirement.

Furthermore,  while  our  discussion  now  explores  the 
influence of the Chinese cultural context, a key limitation 
is  that  we  did  not  formally  measure  cultural  variables. 
Our  interpretations  of  how  values  like  collectivism  or 
face-saving may affect our findings are therefore theoreti-
cal. Future research should address this by including vali-
dated scales of cultural values to quantitatively test their 
role as potential moderators in the relationship between 
stress, coping, and burnout. This would allow for a direct 
examination  of  how  these  cultural  factors  shape  psy-
chological  resilience  in  elite  athletes  and  would  help  in 
designing more culturally-attuned interventions [84].

Finally, the sample size of the study warrants consider-
ation. For the quantitative component, while our sample 
of  286  athletes  was  sufficient  to  detect  the  significant 
relationships  reported,  a  larger  sample  would  increase 
statistical  power  and  provide  more  stable  estimates  for 
our  complex  mediation  model.  Regarding  the  qualita-
tive  interviews,  our  sample  of  23  athletes  allowed  us  to 
reach thematic saturation on the primary research ques-
tions,  as  no  new  overarching  themes  emerged  in  the 
final  interviews.  However,  we  acknowledge  that  a  larger 
sample would be required to explore thematic variations 
across different subgroups with confidence. For example, 
our  current  sample  is  likely  insufficient  to  fully  capture 
potential  differences  in  the  burnout  experience  between 
athletes  in  individual  versus  team  sports  or  across  Chi-
na’s  diverse  regional  training  cultures.  Future  research 
using  large-scale,  multi-site  designs  is  needed  to  verify 
our quantitative findings and conduct more fine-grained 
analyses of these important subgroup experiences.

we  acknowledge  that  certain  Brief  COPE  subscales 
yielded  moderate  internal  consistency  estimates  in  our 
sample.  This  presents  a  trade-off:  the  Brief  COPE  was 
chosen  for  its  ability  to  assess  a  wide  range  of  coping 
strategies  with  minimal  burden  on  participants,  but  the 
cost of this breadth is the brevity of its subscales. There-
fore,  the  findings  related  to  the  coping  strategies  mea-
sured  by  these  specific  subscales  should  be  interpreted 
with  appropriate  caution,  as  they  may  be  subject  to  a 
greater  degree  of  measurement  error.  Future  research 
could build on our findings by employing a more focused 
approach,  using  longer,  more  robust  scales  for  the  spe-
cific  coping  strategies  (e.g.,  positive  reframing,  denial) 
that  our  study  identified  as  significant  mediators.  This 
would provide a more reliable assessment and allow for a 
deeper analysis of their role in the burnout process.

A  third  methodological  point  is  that  our  analytical 
approach focused on mediation rather than moderation. 
While our findings help explain how emotion regulation 
influences  burnout  through  coping,  we  did  not  explore 
for  whom  or  under  what  conditions  these  relationships 
might  be  stronger  or  weaker.  The  inclusion  of  modera-
tion analyses, as the reviewer noted, would have allowed 
us  to  identify  important  boundary  conditions  for  these 
effects. For example, it is plausible that sport type acts as 
a moderator, where the link between maladaptive coping 
and  burnout  is  stronger  for  athletes  in  individual  sports 
(e.g., swimming, gymnastics) compared to those in team 
sports,  who  may  benefit  from  shared  responsibility  and 
built-in  peer  support.  Similarly,  variables  like  compe-
tition  level  or  gender  could  moderate  these  pathways. 
Future research should therefore incorporate moderation 
analyses to test these potential interaction effects, which 
is a critical next step for developing interventions tailored 
to the specific needs of different athlete subgroups.

A  further  limitation  involves  the  study’s  demographic 
scope.  Although  the  23  interviews  provided  rich,  con-
textual  insights,  a  larger  qualitative  sample  could  reveal 
more  variability.  More  pointedly,  our  focus  on  athletes 
aged  18–28,  while  representing  a  critical  developmental 
period  of  peak  competitive  pressure,  means  our  find-
ings may not be generalizable to athletes at other career 
stages. We agree with the reviewer that younger adoles-
cent  and  older  professional  athletes  face  distinct  chal-
lenges  that  likely  influence  their  emotional  and  coping 
responses.  For  instance,  adolescent  athletes  must  navi-
gate  the  pressures  of  identity  formation  alongside  aca-
demics and sport, and their coping repertoires are often 
still  developing  and  more  reliant  on  external  support 
from  coaches  and  parents.  In  contrast,  veteran  profes-
sional athletes may grapple with stressors such as perfor-
mance  decline,  career-transition  anxiety,  and  managing 
family  responsibilities,  which  demand  different  coping 
strategies.  Future  research  should  therefore  adopt  a
