Note from the editor

The authors have confirmed that they obtained ethical approval for 
this retrospective analysis from the University Hospitals Coventry & 
Warwickshire NHS Trust R&D Committee. The authors make clear 
in their paper that their findings represent only an initial evaluation 
with a very small sample and that further study is essential. 

Fibromyalgia and attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder

DOI: 10.7861/clinmed.Let.23.1.3

Editor – We appreciate the RCP concise guideline on fibromyalgia 
(FMS),1 but are disappointed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) is not mentioned. Anxiety and depression are mentioned 
but these may be merely symptoms secondary to underlying 
disorders (eg post-traumatic stress disorder, ADHD, autism), and we 
risk oversimplifying the psychological part of the biopsychosocial 
model. Several studies show that ADHD (either formally diagnosed 
or implied by positive screening tests) is prevalent in patients with 
FMS: 44.7% in a South African study,2 24.5% in an Italian study,3 
32.3% in a Spanish study,4 25% in a study undertaken in the 
Netherlands,5 and 29.5% in a Turkish study.6 Symptoms of ADHD 
correlate with severity of FMS.7 Bou Khalil et al8 suggest how the 
psychopathology of ADHD may predispose to FMS. Patients with 
suspected but unconfirmed FMS may be likely to have similar rates 
of ADHD.

As early as 1998, Krause et al9 noticed that some patients with 
ADHD had FMS and that treatment with stimulants could help both 
conditions. Despite the absence of randomised controlled trial evidence, 
it remains likely that treating comorbid ADHD improves quality of life, 
if not FMS directly. It is interesting to note10 that methylphenidate 
improves tolerability of pain in ADHD (without FMS). The RCP guidelines 
are aimed at generalists, who are responsible for referring to mental 
health services: it would be important not to miss a common treatable 
comorbidity. FMS may also be associated with prior PTSD11 and 
autism,12 which may benefit also from specific interventions.

Physicians, and commissioners, may note that ADHD is common in 

other 'physical' conditions,13 particularly chronic fatigue syndrome, 
and hypermobility spectrum disorders, which are also associated with 

FMS. Further, physicians may be interested to know that ADHD is 
associated with autonomic dysfunction such as postural orthostatic 
tachycardia syndrome (POTS), functional bowel disorders, functional 
urinary disorders such as enuresis, migraine, and other conditions.
