ABSTRACT
Introduction  Self- harm and suicidal behaviour represent 
major global health problems, which account for significant 
proportions of the disease burden in low- income and 
middle- income countries, including Ghana. This review 
aims to synthesise the available and accessible evidence 
on prevalence estimates, correlates, risk and protective 
factors, the commonly reported methods and reasons for 
self- harm and suicidal behaviour in Ghana.
Methods and analysis  We will conduct a systematic 
review reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses statement 
(2009) recommendations. Regional and global electronic 
databases (African Journals OnLine, African Index Medicus, 
APA PsycINFO, Global Health, MEDLINE and PubMed) 
will be searched systematically up to December 2021 
for observational studies and qualitative studies that 
have reported prevalence estimates, correlates, risk and 
protective factors, methods and reasons for self- harm 
and suicidal behaviour in Ghana. The electronic database 
searches will be supplemented with reference harvesting 
and grey literature searching in Google Scholar and 
ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global for postgraduate 
dissertations. Only records in English will be included. 
The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (2018) will be used 
to assess the methodological quality of included studies. 
Meta- analysis or narrative synthesis or both will be used, 
contingent on the extent of heterogeneity across eligible 
observational studies.
Ethics and dissemination  Considering that this is a 
systematic review of accessible and available literature, 
we will not seek ethical approval. On completion, this 
review will be submitted to a peer- reviewed journal, be 
disseminated publicly at (mental) health conferences 
with focus on self- harm and suicide prevention. The 
important findings would also be shared with key national 
stakeholder groups in Ghana: Ghana Association for 
Suicide Prevention, Ghana Mental Health Authority, Ghana 
Psychological Association, Centre for Suicide and Violence 
Research, Accra and the Parliamentary Select Committee 
on Health.
Prospero registration number  CRD42021234622.

INTRODUCTION
According  to  the  WHO,  self- harm  (‘inten-
tional  self- inflicted  poisoning  or 
injury, 
which may or may not have a fatal intent or 
outcome’)1 and suicidal behaviour (‘a range 
of  behaviours  that  include  thinking  about 

Strengths and limitations of this study

 ► This  is  the  first  country- level  systematic  review  of 
the prevalence, correlates, risk and protective fac-
tors,  methods  and  reported  reasons  for  self- harm 
and suicidal behaviour in Ghana.

 ► This protocol has been reported in accordance with 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review 
and Meta- Analysis (PRISMA) Protocol guidelines.
 ► A  senior  information  specialist  will  contribute  to 
the development of the search strategies to ensure 
specificity, sensitivity and replication across all se-
lected databases.

 ► On completion, the review will be reported accord-
ing  to  the  recommendations  of  the  PRISMA- 2009 
statement.

 ► The  criminal  status  of  attempted  suicide  in  Ghana 
and the lack of routinely collected data on (attempt-
ed) suicide in the country are likely to limit the key 
findings of this review.

attempting 
represent  major  global  health  problems 
that  account  for  significant  proportions  of 
the  global  disease  burden  annually,  partic-
ularly,  in  low  and  middle- income  countries 
(LAMICs),  including  Ghana.3  In  2016,  self- 
harm  was  ranked  among  the  top  12  causes 
of death among persons aged 10–24 years in 
sub- Saharan Africa,4 and about 77% of global 
suicides in 2019 were recorded in LAMICs.5

Nonetheless, as observed in some LAMICs,6 
attempted suicide is still a crime and remains 
highly  stigmatised  in  Ghana,7  8  Section  57:1 
of  Ghana’s  Criminal  Code  provides  that 
‘a  person  who  attempts  to  commit  suicide 
commits  a  misdemeanour’,7  but  there  are 
growing efforts by various stakeholder groups 
and  organisations  in  the  country  towards 
getting the Parliament of Ghana to consider 
repealing  the  antisuicide  law.  To  date,  only 
one  national- level  systematic  review  on 
‘mental health research in Ghana’, published 
nearly a decade ago, is available,9 but without 
specific primary focus on self- harm or suicidal 
behaviour  in  the  country.  Also,  two  recent

regional  systematic  reviews  related  to  self- harm  among 
young people10 and suicide in the general adult popula-
tion11 have included data from Ghana. Even though these 
two regional reviews posit self- harm and suicidal behaviour 
as possible important public health challenges in Ghana, 
none  of  them  provides  a  relatively  whole  picture  of  the 
phenomena within and across the general population of 
the country exclusively in one report. This is the gap in 
knowledge  that  the  current  review  seeks  to  contribute 
evidence to address. Notably, emerging evidence suggests 
that  Ghana  is  showing  potential  in  the  contribution  of 
published literature on the phenomena of self- harm and 
suicidal behaviour.10 11

Thus,  it  is  timely  to  consider  performing  a  systematic 
review that integrates and synthesises the evidence exclu-
sively  from  Ghana  on  self- harm  and  suicidal  behaviour. 
Potentially, the body of evidence from a carefully planned 
and  performed  country- level  systematic  review  will,  in 
part,  better  inform  the  ongoing  (de)criminalisation 
debates and antistigma campaigns and provide a research- 
informed basis for the development of contextually rele-
vant and culturally sensitive intervention and prevention 
programmes in the country. Also, a country- level system-
atic  review  of  the  current  nature  can  be  informative  in 
mapping  out  areas  of  self- harm  and  suicidal  behaviour 
that require initial or expansive research attention.

Ghana  is  an  Anglophone  West  African  country  with 
an  estimated  population  of  30.9  million.12  The  country 
is  heterogeneous  regarding  ethnic  groupings,  language 
and  religion.  About  71.2%  of  Ghanaians  identify  as 
Christians,  17.6%  as  Muslims,  5.2%  as  African  Tradi-
tional  Religion  adherents  and  5.3%  without  any  reli-
gious  affiliation.13  The  country  is  categorised  as  having 
a  medium  human  development  index  (rank  of  138), 
with  a  life  expectancy  of  64.1  years  as  of  2019.14  It  is  a 
lower  middle- income  country.15  In  terms  of  the  sustain-
able  development  goals,  Ghana  has  an  index  score  of 
65.4%, with a global ranking of 100 out of 166 countries. 
Ghana has the most comprehensive mental health legis-
lation  across  Anglophone  West  Africa,16  17  but  there  are 
still fundamental challenges with implementation, nega-
tive  public  attitudes  and  access.  For  example,  the  three 
psychiatric hospitals in the country are all located within 
two  regions  in  the  south—out  of  the  16  regions  of  the 
country;  only  2.8%  of  persons  requiring  mental  health 
services are able to access professional care.18 The most 
recent crude estimate by the WHO indicates that 6.6/100 
000 population (women=177; men=1816) died by suicide 
in  Ghana  during  2019.5  The  country  is  generally  faced 
with  an  acute  shortage  of  mental  health  professionals, 
and mental health facilities and services are significantly 
underfunded.18–20  In  Ghana,  the  psychiatrist  to  popu-
lation  ratio  is  0.058  per  100  000  population,  and  0.065 
psychologists per 100 000 population—which is less than 
enough  compared  with  the  WHO  benchmark  of  one 
psychiatrist/100 000 population.21

Prior to designing and developing this review protocol, 
we  searched  key  systematic  review  repositories  and 

2

protocol  registers,  including  the  International  Prospec-
tive  Register  of  Systematic  Reviews  (PROSPERO),  the 
Cochrane  Library,  Joanna  Briggs  Institute  Database  of 
Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports and the 
Campbell Collaboration. We also searched peer- reviewed 
journals such as BMJ Open and BMC Systematic Reviews, and 
the  key  electronic  databases  selected  for  this  review,  to 
identify  same  or  similarly  worded—recently—published 
prospective  or  completed  systematic  reviews,  specifically 
on self- harm and suicidal behaviour in Ghana. However, 
we  found  no  such  (prospective  or  completed)  reviews; 
thus,  no  national- level  systematic  review  exclusively 
focused on self- harm and suicidal behaviour in Ghana has 
been published.

Objectives
The objectives of this review will be to:
 ► Describe  the  reported  prevalence  estimates  of  self- 
harm and suicidal behaviour (ideation, planning and 
attempt) in Ghana.

 ► Describe  the  methods  and  means  of  self- harm  and 
suicide attempt that have been reported in Ghana.
 ► Examine  the  reported  motivations/reasons  for  self- 

harm in Ghana.

 ► Identify  the  known  common  correlates,  risk  and 
protective  factors  and  associated  key  sociodemo-
graphic  factors  of  self- harm  and  suicidal  behaviour 
(ideation, planning and attempt) in Ghana.

METHODS
The  development  of  this  systematic  review  protocol 
is  being  reported  in  accordance  with  the  Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis 
(PRISMA) Protocol guidelines.22 Notably, on completion, 
the reporting of this systematic review will be guided by 
the community- agreed statement of the PRISMA- 2009.23 
The  title  and  key  information  about  the  design  and 
methods  of  this  proposed  systematic  review  have  been 
registered on the PROSPERO database.

Eligibility criteria
Table 1 summarises the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
that will guide the selection of potentially eligible records.

Outcomes
Potentially  eligible  studies  must  have  assessed  or 
measured  self- harm  or  suicidal  behaviour  (ideation, 
planning  or  attempt)  as  outcome  in  any  age  group  in 
Ghana.  Considering  the  criminal  status  of  attempted 
suicide in Ghana and the lack of routinely collected offi-
cial  data  on  suicide  in  the  country,  we  anticipate  that 
eligible  prevalence  studies  on  suicidal  deaths—where 
available—are likely to be based on medicolegal autopsy 
studies  or  police  records,  which  are  often  less  reflective 
of the true scope of the problem in the general popula-
tion.24 Specifically, eligible studies must report evidence 
that addresses at least one of the objectives of this review: 
(a)  reported  period  prevalence  (lifetime,  12-  month, 
6- month or 1- month) estimates of self- harm and suicidal

 ► Primary studies conducted within non- clinical 
contexts (ie, general population, community, 
school- based, households/neighbourhoods, 
homeless context, street- connected settings, 
correctional facilities etc.) in Ghana.

 ► Clinic- based studies conducted in Ghana 

focused on self- harm or suicidal behaviour as the 
main presenting condition.

 ► Participants sampled from Ghana regardless 
of age, gender, sexual or gender orientation, 
occupational group, religious groupings, health 
status, or ‘alternative’ subcultures (eg, cult 
groups, Goth, Emo, Metallers, Punk).

 ► Participants in eligible studies who have had 
personal experiences of self- harm or suicidal 
behaviour.

 ► Studies focused on self- harm or suicidal 

behaviour, but participants selected from a 
geographical context outside Ghana.

 ► Cross- national studies involving Ghana but with 
study results not disaggregated by country.
 ► Studies involving participants who report no 
personal experience of self- harm or suicidal 
behaviour.

Study designs

 ► Primary studies with focus on self- harm or 

suicidal behaviour which address at least one 
of the four specified objectives of this review 
using observational study designs or qualitative 
approaches.

 ► Systematic reviews
 ► Studies based on the same dataset reported in an 

earlier publication included in this review.
 ► Full text of identified records unavailable or 
inaccessible, even after contacting authors.

 ► Publications/reports in English language.
 ► Peer- reviewed publications, unpublished records 
based on data, preprints, and postgraduate 
theses.

 ► Non- English language records.
 ► Grey literature such as undergraduate theses, 
editorials, commentaries, opinion pieces, 
correspondence and articles not based on data.

Prevalence

 ► Studies must specify time frames within which 

prevalence of self- harm and/or suicidal behaviour 
was assessed.

 ► Time frame of prevalence estimates cannot be 
determined, even after contacting authors.

 ► Study reports with no clear indication of sample 

size and population denominator.

Definition and 
measurement of 
self- harm and/or 
suicidal behaviour

 ► Studies with clear definitions of self- harm 

 ► Studies focused on intentional self- harm with 

and (specific) suicidal behaviour, in addition 
to specific measurement, means of case 
identification, or assessment.Only self- reported 
prevalence estimates of outcomes will be 
considered for inclusion.

behaviours (eg, eating disorders, smoking, drink- 
driving, etc.).

 ► Studies focused on unintentional injuries, suicide 

bombing, or euthanasia/mercy killing.

 ► Prevalence studies based on family reports.

behaviour in Ghana, (b) methods and means of self- harm 
and  suicide  in  Ghana,  (c)  motivations/reasons  for  self- 
harm  in  Ghana  and  (d)  correlates,  risk  and  protective 
factors and key sociodemographic factors associated with 
self- harm  and  suicidal  behaviour  in  Ghana.  Potentially 
eligible studies estimating the prevalence of self- harm or 
suicidal behaviour must have specified the time frame or 
period of prevalence and clearly identified their method 
of assessment. Eligible prevalence studies will be consid-
ered  for  inclusion  if  they  have  a  clear  indication  of  the 
sample  size  and  population  denominator.  Clinic- based 
(accident  and  emergency/outpatient/inpatient  depart-
ment)  prevalence  studies  will  be  excluded  due  to  the 
inherent bias in selection of patients and patients’ access 
to clinical care that could skew results artificially.25 26 For 
the same reason, studies reporting evidence of prevalence 

based  on  medicolegal  autopsy  studies  or  police  records 
will be excluded.24 27

Definition and measurement of outcomes
Studies  with  clear  definitions  of  self- harm  or  suicidal 
behaviour  (ideation,  planning  and  attempt)  will  be 
considered for inclusion. Although we anticipate eligible 
studies  to  distinguish  between  suicidal  self- harm  and 
non- suicidal  self- harm  in  their  findings,  we  are  mindful 
to include all acts that meet the WHO definition of self- 
harm  applied  in  this  review—which  does  not  require  a 
specific intent.1 28 We will adopt this position because the 
literature  is  replete  with  debates  about  the  clarity  and 
usefulness (or otherwise) of the distinction between self- 
reported  suicidal  and  non- suicidal  acts  of  self- harm,29 
which  can  be  particularly  problematic  in  a  country  like

Ghana,  where  attempted  suicide  is  a  crime  and  where 
different  languages  may  not  clearly  reflect  the  distinc-
tion.7 30 Furthermore, we will include all acts that meet the 
WHO definition of self- harm applied in this review, as all 
acts of self- harm (regardless of attribution and intention) 
are associated with increased risk of death by suicide.1 2 30 
Thus, we will include all studies where it is clear that self- 
harm  (regardless  of  apparent  intent),  suicidal  ideation, 
suicidal planning or attempted suicide was the question 
that participants were asked.

Additionally,  specific  measurement  or  means  of  case 
identification/assessment (including self- report measures 
or diagnostic instruments) should have been reported by 
potentially eligible studies:
 ► assessment using a standardised clinician rating based 

on medical documentation or clinical interview.
 ► Clinic- based  diagnostic  case  ascertainment  at  admis-
sion  or  by  inspecting  medical  records,  clinical  chart 
reviews or other.

 ► Assessment based on interviews that were constructed 
ad hoc for the study or interviews for which validation 
data are available.

 ► Assessment by a self- report single item.
 ► Assessment  by  a  self- report  multiitem  questionnaire 
for  which  validation  data  or  psychometric  informa-
tion are available or unavailable.

Prevalence studies that access data from family will be 
excluded: only self- reported estimates will be considered 
for inclusion.

Types of study
This review will consider for inclusion primary studies that 
have used observational study designs (ie, cross- sectional 
studies,  case–control  studies  and  cohort  studies).31  32 
Evidence on prevalence estimates and associated factors 
of  self- harm  and  suicidal  behaviour  (ideation,  planning 
and  attempt)  will  be  drawn  mainly  from  the  eligible 
observational  studies.  Primary  studies  using  qualitative 
methods  (eg,  interviews,  focus  groups,  psychological 
autopsy  studies,  media  content  analyses,  retrospective 
analyses of clinical records) will be considered for inclu-
sion  to  provide  evidence,  mainly,  on  the  reported  moti-
vations/reasons  and  methods/means  of  self- harm  and 
attempted  suicide.  Besides  elaborating  self- reported 
motivations/reasons for self- harm and suicidal behaviour, 
eligible qualitative studies may also shed additional light 
on the roles that specific correlates, risks and protective 
factors play in relation to self- harm and attempted suicide. 
A study will be excluded if the data had been reported (in 
a relatively sufficient detail, including larger sample size) 
by an earlier or recent study based on the same data set. 
Peer- reviewed publications based on postgraduate theses 
will  be  considered  for  inclusion,  but  the  theses  will  be 
consulted for further methodological details.

Participants
This review will consider for inclusion studies that involve 
children,  adolescents  and  adults,  regardless  of  gender, 

4

sexual  orientation,  occupational  group  or  religious 
groupings  sampled  from  Ghana.  Participants  in  eligible 
studies must have had personal experiences of self- harm 
or suicidal behaviour (ideation, planning and attempt).

Study setting
This  review  will  include  studies  conducted  in  Ghana  or 
within any of its 16 administrative geographical regions. 
Specifically,  potentially  eligible  studies  must  have  been 
conducted  within  clinical  or  non- clinical  contexts, 
including  schools,  households,  community,  homeless 
contexts,  street- connected  settings,  rural,  periurban  or 
urban settings.

Information sources
We  will  develop  search  strategies  for  eligible  literature 
using  medical  subject  headings  (MeSH)  and  text  words 
related  to  self- harm,  suicidal  behaviour  and  Ghana.  We 
will search six electronic databases: two regional- specific 
databases (African Journals OnLine (AJOL) and African 
Index  Medicus  (AIM))  and  four  global  databases  (APA 
PsycINFO, Global Health, MEDLINE and PubMed). The 
electronic database search will be supplemented with grey 
literature (ie, postgraduate dissertations and preprints). 
We  will  search  ProQuest  Dissertations  &  Theses  Global, 
and  Google  Scholar  for  postgraduate  dissertations.  For 
preprints,  we  will  search  the  Social  Science  Research 
Network,  medRxiv,  Research  Square  and  Open  Science 
Framework. Additionally, we would search the references 
of key papers to harvest or chase the citations of poten-
tially  eligible  papers;  we  would  use  Social  Science  Cita-
tion  Index,  Science  Citation  Index  and  Google  Scholar 
(‘Cited by’ function) to search relevant forward citations 
of  key  papers.  Beyond  the  database  searching,  we  will 
contact authors of at least two eligible papers, requesting 
for  copies  of  relevant  unpublished  papers  from  their 
personal records to be screened for inclusion. We will use 
the ‘Similar articles’ feature in PubMed and the ‘Related 
articles’ function in Google Scholar to locate additional 
studies.  All  searches  will  be  limited  to  studies  reported 
in  English  and  involving  human  subjects.  English  is  the 
formal language of Ghana and scientific works from the 
country are published in English. The anticipated comple-
tion date of this review is March 2022. Thus, the searches 
will  be  limited  to  the  year  of  inception  of  the  selected 
databases,  first,  up  to  December  2020,  then  updated  to 
December 2021, towards the end of the review.

Search strategy and process
Our  specific  literature  search  strategies  will  be  created 
with  the  assistance  of  a  senior  information  specialist 
with  expertise  in  systematic  review  searching  on  health 
topics  related  to  LAMICs.  Our  search  strategy  would 
include  keywords,  truncation,  Boolean  logic  operators 
(AND,  OR,  NOT)  and  MeSH  terms  as  relevant  to  and 
appropriate  for  each  selected  database  (eg,  (self- harm 
OR  self- poisoning  OR  self- injur*  OR  attempted  suicide 
OR  suicid*)  AND  (Ghana  OR  Accra  OR  Kumasi  OR 

Quarshie EN- B, et al. BMJ Open 2021;11:e053144. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053144Tamale)).  The  geographic  search  filter  would  include 
‘Ghana’  and  names  of  the  16  regions  and  capital  cities; 
these would include both earlier and current names. After 
a prototype, APA PsycINFO search strategy is developed 
and  finalised,  it  will  be  adapted  to  the  subject  headings 
and  syntax  of  the  other  databases  (AJOL,  AIM,  Global 
Health,  MEDLINE  and  PubMed).  The  APA  PsycINFO 
search  strategy  will  be  developed  first  with  input  from 
the  review  team  and  then  peer  reviewed  by  the  senior 
information specialist providing technical advice for this 
review. Appendix 1 shows the draft APA PsycINFO search 
strategy.  The  reporting  of  our  searches  will  be  guided 
by  the  Statement  for  Reporting  Literature  Searches  in 
Systematic  Reviews  (PRISMA- S).33  Three  authors  (EN- 
BQ, KOA and JA- A) will run the searches and one author 
(ENBQ)  will  compile  the  search  results  and  eliminate 
duplicates.

Study records
Data management
EndNote  (V.X9.3.3)  will  be  used  to  collate,  handle  and 
manage  the  results  of  the  database  searches,  to  remove 
duplicates of records and to access the full text of poten-
tially eligible studies. Notably, the selected databases will 
be searched individually, but the results will be combined 
before removing duplicates.

Selection process
Two reviewers (KOA and JA- A) will independently screen 
the titles and abstracts of the identified records within the 
lens  of  the  prespecified  eligibility  criteria.  We  will  then 
screen the full text of potentially eligible studies for inclu-
sion, also guided by our prespecified eligibility criteria for 
the review. We will refer to published protocols of eligible 
studies and associated online supplemental materials or 
contact authors of eligible studies (that are not available 
online) through telephone or email correspondence for 
additional  relevant  information  or  missing  information, 
where  the  authors  are  unable  to  reach  consensus,  the 
specific  papers  will  be  referred  to  a  third  reviewer  (EN- 
BQ) for resolution.

Data collection process and data items
We  will  design  an  extraction  form  to  record  relevant 
information  from  eligible  studies.  The  extraction  form 
will  include  information  about  authors,  year  of  publica-
tion,  setting  of  study  (clinic- based  or  non- clinical,  etc), 
sampling and sample size, study design, outcome measure-
ment, key findings and study quality score. Following the 
definitions  and  nomenclature  of  self- harm  and  suicidal 
behaviour guiding, this systematic review, the extraction 
of  information  on  self- harm,  will  include  self- poisoning 
and self- injury; and suicidal behaviour will include suicidal 
ideation, suicidal planning, suicidal attempt and suicide. 
Two reviewers (KOA and JA- A) will independently extract 
data  from  the  included  studies  and  the  extractions  will 
be  referred  to  a  third  reviewer  (ENBQ)  for  complete-
ness  and  accuracy  check.  The  review  team  will  resolve 

Open access

discrepancies  through  consensus  for  accuracy  check  of 
included  studies.  We  will  also  contact  study  authors  of 
eligible  studies  for  additional  information  and  accuracy 
check—where necessary—to resolve uncertainties.

Risk of bias in individual studies
Two  reviewers  would  independently  use  the  Mixed 
Methods  Appraisal  Tool  (MMAT- 2018).34  35  The  MMAT- 
2018  is  robust  for  assessing  and  describing  the  meth-
odological  quality  of  different  kinds  of  study  designs: 
qualitative  research,  randomised  controlled  trials,  non- 
randomised  studies,  quantitative  descriptive  studies  and 
mixed  method  studies.34–36  The  MMAT- 2018  has  three 
reviewer rating options: ‘yes’ (there is clear information 
related  to  the  criterion),  ‘no’  (there  is  no  information 
related to the criterion), or ‘can’t tell’ (reported informa-
tion related to the criterion is unclear or inappropriate). 
Where reviewers are unclear (can’t tell), authors will be 
contacted  for  clarification.  No  study  will  be  excluded 
based on quality rating.

Data synthesis
Meta- analysis or narrative synthesis or both will be used, 
contingent  on  the  extent  of  heterogeneity  across  the 
eligible  observational  studies  (reporting  prevalence  and 
associations). The I2 statistic would be used to assess the 
extent of heterogeneity across the eligible prevalence and 
association  studies  (I2  value  of  zero=no  heterogeneity; 
≤25%=low  heterogeneity;  50%=moderate  heterogeneity 
and ≥75% = substantial heterogeneity).37–39 If zero or low 
heterogeneity is obtained, the prevalence estimates would 
be pooled in meta- analysis based on random effects model 
using Jamovi programming software package (V.1.8.1). If 
necessary, sensitivity analysis will be performed to assess 
risk of bias—to identify possible sources of heterogeneity 
(in this case, the analysis will be limited to only included 
studies  with  low  risk  of  bias).  Where  appropriate,  we 
will  conduct  subgroup  analysis—for  example,  based  on 
gender/sex, design of study or age groupings—to ensure 
that comparable studies are only those that have similar 
effect measures.

However,  where  there  is  substantial  heterogeneity 
across  eligible  studies,  the  three- step  approach  to 
narrative  synthesis  would  be  followed  to  synthesise  the 
evidence  drawn  from  the  eligible  studies40:  ‘(1)  organ-
ising the description of the studies into logical categories, 
(2)  analysing  the  findings  within  each  of  the  categories 
and  (3)  synthesising  the  findings  across  all  included 
studies’.  Median  values  and  associated  IQRs  would  be 
used to present the prevalence estimates. Also, tables and 
graphical displays (including forest plots) would be used 
to support the narrative synthesis or qualitative summary, 
although  meta- analysis  would  not  be  performed.40  41 
Where the eligible observational studies (reporting prev-
alence  and  associations)  are  sufficient,  we  will  consider 
including only studies that present data as OR and adjust 
for  confounding  factors  (eg,  age,  sex,  etc).  However, 
considering  that  Ghana  is  now  showing  potential  in

contributing  published  data  on  self- harm  and  suicidal 
behaviour, we anticipate including all types of data. The 
exploratory nature of this review and the high possibility 
of  accessing  a  limited  number  of  studies  will  make  the 
inclusion of all types of data useful. Again, the three- step 
approach  to  narrative  synthesis  would  also  be  followed 
to synthesise the evidence drawn from the eligible qual-
itative studies (on reported reasons/motivations for and 
means of self- harm and suicidal behaviour).40

Patient and public involvement
No patient involved.

DISCUSSION
When completed, this review will be the first to provide a 
holistic systematic account of the accessible and available 
evidence  on  the  prevalence,  correlates,  risk  and  protec-
tive factors, methods and reported reasons for self- harm 
and suicidal behaviour across the general population of 
Ghana.  More  importantly,  we  anticipate  that  evidence 
of this review will, among other things, serve as a useful 
resource contributing to the evidence base informing the 
push for the repeal of the antisuicide law in Ghana.

However, when pooling included studies within a meta- 
analysis,  we  anticipate  the  possibility  of  substantial  vari-
ation  across  records,  which  may  create  a  challenge  for 
meaningful  synthesis.  This  could  be  due  to  the  broad 
approach  guiding  this  systematic  review;  but  we  believe 
that  a  broad  approach  affords  much  value,  including 
subgroup analysis exploring the differences and similar-
ities in terms of correlates, risk and protective factors of 
self- harm and suicidal behaviour.

The quality of the evidence reported by eligible studies 
will  be  assessed,  which  could  be  useful  for  designing 
future  research.  Potentially,  the  evidence  of  this  review 
will help in mapping out which domains and (vulnerable) 
groups  require  self- harm  and  suicide  research  atten-
tion;  for  example,  children  aged  12  years  and  younger, 
patients  presenting  with  non- communicable  chronic 
medical conditions and persons in correctional facilities. 
Relatedly,  the  results  of  this  review  can  inform  targeted 
and  universal  intervention  and  prevention  programmes 
in Ghana. Broadly, we anticipate that this review’s findings 
will  be  relevant  and  of  interest  to  persons  in  academia, 
researchers,  the  clinical  community  and  health  policy-
makers in Ghana.

Amendments

described in this protocol are anticipated, in the event of 
necessary protocol amendments, we will provide the date 
of  each  amendment.  Also,  we  will  describe  the  needed 
change(s)  and  the  rationale  in  this  section  (Amend-
ments). Changes will not be included in the protocol. All
