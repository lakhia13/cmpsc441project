IMPORTANCE: Documenting Americans’ stress re-
sponses to an unprecedented pandemic and their degree
of adherence to CDC guidelines is essential for mental
health interventions and policy-making.
OBJECTIVE: To provide the first snapshot of immediate
impact of COVID-19 on Americans’ stress, coping, and
guideline adherence.
DESIGN: Data were collected from an online workers’
platform for survey research (Amazon’s Mechanical Turk)
from April 7 to 9, 2020. The current data represents the
baseline of a longitudinal study. Best practices for ensur-
ing high-quality data were employed.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who are 18 years of age or
older, living in the USA, and English-speaking were eligi-
ble for the study. Of 1086 unique responses, 1015 com-
pleted responses are included.
SETTING: Population-based.
MAIN OUTCOMES: Exposure to and stressfulness of
COVID-19 stressors, coping strategies, and adherence to
CDC guidelines.
RESULTS: The sample was 53.9% women (n = 547), with
an average age of 38.9 years (SD = 13.50, range = 18–88),
most of whom were White (n = 836, 82.4%), non-Hispanic
(n = 929, 91.5%), and straight/heterosexual (n = 895,
88.2%); 40% were currently married (n = 407), and
21.6% (n = 219) were caregivers. About half (50.5%) en-
dorsed having at least “mostly” enough money to meet
their needs. Respondents’ locations across the USA
ranged from 18.5% in the Northeast to 37.8% in the
South. The most commonly experienced stressors were
reading/hearing about the severity and contagiousness of
COVID-19, uncertainty about length of quarantine and
social distancing requirements, and changes to social and
daily personal care routines. Financial concerns were rat-
ed most stressful. Younger age, female gender, and care-
giver status increased risk for stressor exposure and
greater degree of stressfulness. The most frequently

Key Points Question: How are Americans responding to COVID-19 in
terms of stressors, coping, and adherence?

Findings: Americans have high COVID-19 stress exposure and some
demographic subgroups appear particularly vulnerable to stress effects.
Subgroups less likely to adhere to CDC guidelines (e.g., men, younger
adults) may benefit from targeted information campaigns.

Meaning: The documented high levels of stress and suboptimal
adherence to CDC guidelines may guide public health and mental health
interventions and inform policy-making.

reported strategies to manage stress were distraction,
active coping, and seeking emotional social support.
CDC guideline adherence was generally high, but several
key social distancing and hygiene behaviors showed sub-
optimal adherence, particularly for men and younger
adults.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Americans have high
COVID-19 stress exposure and some demographic sub-
groups appear particularly vulnerable to stress effects.
Subgroups less likely to adhere to CDC guidelines may
benefit from targeted information campaigns. these
findings may guide mental health interventions and
inform policy-making regarding implications of specific
public health measures.

T he rapid emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the

USA and subsequent state and federal prevention mea-
sures now in place have dramatically altered daily behavior,
with a substantial impact on the physical, mental, social, and
financial well-being of the population. Nationwide, individ-
uals must navigate school closures, employment insecurity,
and changes in social behavior that likely have major adverse
effects on their mental health and ability to cope. Indeed, the
Centers for Disease Control1 has emphasized the need for all
individuals to manage stress and protect their mental health
during this extremely uncertain time, recognizing that in-
creased stress may lead to maladaptive behaviors to cope with
stress and anxiety.

Time-sensitive research has identified diverse stressors in
previous geographically limited quarantines, including fears
of infection, disruptions to work/learning, and daily self-care
routines, in addition to lack of access to reliable information
and resources.2 However, little is known about these stressors
in the midst of an ongoing, open-ended, universally experi-
enced pandemic. Several studies in China suggested only
modest impacts on stress during the early months of the
pandemic in late 2019 and early 2020.3, 4 For example, less
than one-third of one national sample in China reported ele-
vated stress.5

Perhaps compounding the stress of COVID-19, the CDC
and many government agencies have issued guidelines regard-
ing social distancing and hygiene. Yet during crises, seeking
social support is often one of the most adaptive ways to cope
with stress.6 Thus, many of the very recommendations pro-
vided by the CDC to prevent the spread of COVID-197 may
reduce critical social supports necessary for well-being.6, 8
Many other strategies for coping with stress, such as active
coping to alleviate problems, have been shown to be helpful
during a crisis; others, such as substance use coping, have been
found universally maladaptive, and for still others, such as
distraction, their utility may depend on the context.9, 10

Very little information is available regarding adherence to
COVID-related CDC guidelines to prevent the spread of this
disease. One Chinese study reported varying levels of adher-
ence to five recommended behaviors: always wash the hands
after touching contaminated objects (66.6%), always wear a
mask regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms
(59.8%), always cover the mouth when coughing and sneez-
ing (57.4%); always wash the hands with soap (56.5%), al-
ways wash the hands immediately after coughing, sneezing, or
rubbing the nose (41%), and always avoid sharing utensils
during meals (40.5%).5 In that study, social distancing adher-
ence was not assessed.

This paper presents the first national US survey results of
Americans’ experiences in social isolation in early April 2020,
including the specific stressors they encountered, the types of
coping they employed to manage these stressors, and the extent
to which they adhered to current CDC guidelines. Further,
exploratory analyses describe how demographic characteristics
relate to people’s responses to the pandemic. Such information
may be critical to interventionists seeking to alleviate adverse
mental health effects of isolation as well as to policy-makers in
weighing the implications of specific public health measures.

METHODS

Data Collection

All study materials were approved by the University of Con-
necticut IRB (X20-0057) as an exempt protocol. Participants
from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) online worker pool
gave consent prior to completing baseline questionnaires on
the impact of COVID-19 on daily life using an anonymous,
longitudinal design based on best practices.11 At each
timepoint, participants receive a $2 incentive. Data presented
here include results from the baseline survey collected be-
tween April 7 and 9, 2020, approximately 3 weeks after
quarantines began rolling out across the USA.

MTurk. After removing duplicates and incomplete or substan-
dard responses, the final baseline sample reported here includes
1015 cases (see the “Analysis” section for details). MTurk
workers are more diverse than typical student or online forum
samples and fairly representative of larger populations, includ-
ing the USA.12–14 Evaluations of the reliability and validity of
MTurk have found data to be high-quality, replicable, and valid
across comparisons with frequently used academic platforms
and student and professional samples.12, 15, 16 Underscoring the
utility of this platform for health research, a review of 35 health
and medical studies that compared MTurk responses with re-
sponses from data obtained from other sources concluded that
the MTurk responses were “largely comparable.”17

Key Measures

Demographics. Participants reported on their location by
state, student enrollment/employment status, financial security
(“Do you have enough money to meet your needs,” rated from
1 (“not at all”) to 5 (“completely”), whether they were a
primary caregiver for a dependent, partner status, gender,
sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, and age. For descriptive
purposes, states were categorized into four distinct regions of
the USA based on divisions used in the US Census18 (West,
Midwest, Northeast, and South).

COVID-19 Stressors. Based on previous work during SARS
and the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, we created
an assessment of COVID-19 stressors (based on 2, 3, 19). This
novel measure assesses whether individuals experienced each
of 23 stressors in the past week, and for those experienced,
ratings of the degree of stressfulness of each from 1 (“not at all
stressful”) to 5 (“extremely stressful”).

CDC Guideline Adherence. Participants rated their degree of
adherence (from 0 to 100% of the time) over the past week
with each of 15 items regarding social distancing behavior,
health behavior, and hygiene recommendations based on
public guidance to prevent the spread of COVID-19 issued
by the CDC in March of 2020.7

Coping. The survey included the COPE substance use/active
coping/self-distraction/behavioral disengagement/humor (18
items),20 which asked about how individuals had been coping
with “COVID-19-related stressors” over the past week on a 4-
point Likert scale ranging from 1 (“I haven’t been doing this at
all”) to 4 (“I’ve been doing this a lot”).

Sample

Analysis

Individuals who are 18 years of age or older, live in the USA,
and are English-speaking were eligible for the study. We re-
ceived 1086 unique responses to the baseline study online using

Univariate analyses (mean/median, standard deviation,
and percentages) and bivariate analyses (chi-square, inde-
pendent samples t test, bivariate correlation) are reported.

A priori power analysis with a two-tailed alpha set to .05
suggested that a sample size of N = 1050 would provide
80% power to detect small (d = 0.20) group differences in
groups imbalanced at a 3:1 ratio and approximately 90%
power to detect small (d = 0.20) group differences in
groups equally balanced at a 1:1 ratio (the same logic
applies to h’s, effect sizes for categorical comparisons).
Best practices for withholding payment and removal of
participants from a dataset include subjective inattentive-
ness, such as abnormally quick response times, psycho-
metric antonyms, or those deemed as substandard work.16,
21, 22 A close examination of the raw dataset revealed
twelve sets of completed duplicate responses and 59 re-
sponses completed in under 10 min (less than half of the
expected time for the survey, based on pilot testing).
Duplicate responses were deleted, retaining the first com-
pleted response; responses completed in less than 10 min
were also excluded from the analyses presented below to
ensure high response quality. The final dataset consisted
of 1015 unique participants. Likely due to MTurk’s policy
that participants submitting incomplete data may not re-
ceive incentive, all included participants completed 100%
of the survey; missingness for all items was < 1%. Due to
these extremely low rates of missing data, list-wise dele-
tion was used for analyses below. Data cleaning and
primary study analyses were conducted in SPSS (version
26); standardized effect sizes were calculated in R (ver-
sion 3.6.2). For parsimony, only significant standardized
effect sizes are reported in the text below; given the
considerable statistical power afforded by this large sam-
ple, effect sizes for statistically non-significant group dif-
ferences are very small to negligible (e.g., d or h < 0.20).

RESULTS

Our sample was fairly equal in gender (n = 547, 53.9%
females), with an average age of 38.9 years old (SD =
13.5, range = 18–88) and most participants identifying as
White (n = 836, 82.4%), non-Hispanic (n = 929, 91.5%),
and straight/heterosexual (n = 895, 88.2%); 40% were
currently married (n = 407), and 21.6% (219) reported
being a caregiver. About half (50.5%) of participants
endorsed having at least “mostly” enough money to meet
their needs. Participants reported current locations across
the USA (ranging from 18.5% in the Northeast to 37.8%
in the South). Sixty-two participants (6.1%) reported feel-
ing ill, having a fever, or testing positive for COVID-19
during the past week. Demographics are reported in great-
er detail in Table 1.

participants (all two-tailed p’s < .05). Two-tailed independent samples t tests were used for categorical group comparisons; bivariate correlations were
used for continuous predictors (age and financial needs met) to retain maximal variance. Average stress appraisals apply only for participants who
endorsed experiencing each item; participants who did not endorse a given item did not report on stress appraisals. Standardized effect sizes differ by

reading/hearing about the severity and contagiousness of
COVID-19 (96.6%), uncertainty about length of quaran-
tine and social distancing requirements (88.3%), and
changes to social (83.7%) and daily personal care
(80.1%) routines. Individuals who reported financial strain
appear to be at a particular risk for stressor exposure
during the COVID-19 pandemic (particularly infection-
related risk as well as lack of job security and lack of
resources). Age, gender, and caregiver status were also
important predictors of stress exposure across several do-
mains (Cohen’s h for all significant effects ranging from -
0.11 to - 0.43; r’s ranging from - 0.07 to - 0.37). Of note,
participants who cared for dependents were much more
likely to experience past-week changes in caregiving de-
mands related to COVID-19 (h = 1.02, 95% CI [0.90,
1.14], p < .001). Of the stressors experienced, the most
stressful was loss of job security or income (M = 4.09, SD
= 0.96), risk of a loved one’s illness (M = 3.65, SD =
1.01), stigma related to being high risk (M = 3.53, SD =
0.96), loss of job/education (M = 3.52, SD = 1.18), and
lack of access to information (M = 3.50, SD = 1.09).

Similar to trends in stress exposure, women appraised
events as significantly more stressful than did men across
multiple domains, including infection-related risk, change
to daily activities, and resource insecurity (d’s ranging
from − 0.15 to − 0.47). Caregivers reported significantly
greater stress appraisals primarily in relation to infection-
related risk as well as moderately greater stress regarding
perceived stigma of being quarantined or working in a
high risk context (d = 0.53, 95% CI [0.01, 1.05], p = .04;

all other significant d’s for caregivers ranged from 0.17 to
0.40). Non-specific to domain, younger participants and
those with fewer resources also reported a high number of
stressors as more stressful than did older, better-resourced
participants (significant r’s range from − .09 to − .23 for
age; from − .15 to − .39 for financial resources), sexual
minority participants were more stressed by rumination
and co-worry with others (d = 0.27, 95% CI [0.01,
0.54], p = .04), and non-White participants experienced
more stress related to symptom self-monitoring (d = 0.28,
95% CI [0.02, 0.54], p = .03).

COMMON COPING STRATEGIES

The most common coping strategies were distraction,
active coping, and seeking emotional social support
(Table 3). Female gender was associated with greater use
of multiple emotion-focused strategies such as distraction,
emotional and religious support, and less use of humor
(d’s range from 0.22 to − 0.31). Caregivers similarly
reported greater emotion and religious support coping,
but also exhibited significantly greater use of active strat-
egies and instrumental social support seeking (d’s range
from = 0.16 to 0.21). Younger participants, sexual minor-
ities, and those with greater financial instability generally
reported greater use of less productive strategies, includ-
ing substance use, behavioral disengagement, and humor,
all with very small to medium effect sizes (significant d’s

ADHERENCE TO CDC GUIDELINES: SOCIAL
DISTANCING AND HEALTH BEHAVIOR/HYGIENE

Adherence to CDC guidelines was generally fairly high,
but uneven (Table 4). Respondents reported a high aver-
age level of compliance with several aspects of social
distancing, including avoiding eating out or gathering at
bars/restaurants (95.10%) and avoiding visiting nursing
homes (94.38%), although these rates may be a result of
municipal restrictions to essential businesses. Lower but
still robust adherence was noted for social distancing (e.g.,
discretionary travel (89.74%), keeping 6-ft distance
(87.42%)) and hygiene (e.g., touching face (77.87%),
cleaning/disinfecting (74.68%)). Across adherence items,
older age, female gender, and financial security were the
most consistent predictors of adherence to CDC

guidelines, with other significant predictors emerging at
the item level (e.g., heterosexual status predicting more
daily cleaning of surfaces) albeit with very small to small
effect sizes (significant d’s range from − 0.13 to − 0.39;
r’s range from .06 to .17).

CONCLUSION

This study is among the first to present reports of stress and
coping responses to COVID-19 in the USA and adherence to
CDC guidelines. Similar to prior studies of COVID-193 and
SARS19 in China, people in the USA reported experiencing
many stressors in all aspects of their lives: in addition to nearly
universal reports of stress over the spread of the disease,
uncertainty and changes in routines were highly prevalent.
Although reported less frequently, financial concerns (worry
over job security and lack of resources) stand out as among the
most stressful.

Distraction, the most commonly reported coping strategy, is
often used following major traumatic events (e.g., 9/11)23 and
can be helpful in situations of low control.24 Perhaps relying
on distraction reflects limitations in what people can do given
social distancing practices (including shelter in place and non-
essential business closures in many communities). Frequent
use of active coping and emotional support–seeking strategies
are encouraging, even if much of it is likely telemediated.
Overall, reported coping strategies indicate that people are
employing many adaptive coping strategies to manage their
stress.

Rate of adherence with CDC guidelines overall seems quite
high compared with general population adherence to other
types of public health guidelines (e.g., 25), but an expected
level of adherence in acute situations such as the current
pandemic has no precedent upon which to draw. Additionally,
some of the reported behaviors indicate a potentially worri-
s o m e l a c k o f a d h e r e n c e t o c r i t i c a l C D C
guidelines—particularly for men and younger adults.

Limitations of the current study must be acknowledged.
Generalizability is limited by the composition of our sam-
ple of MTurk workers. While men and women are rela-
tively equally represented among MTurk workers, are, on
average, slightly younger than the US population as a
whole (88% of workers are under 50 compared with
66% of employed adults) and better educated (51% of
workers have college degrees compared with 36% of US
adults over 18); about 3/4 of MTurk workers are White
and non-Hispanic compared with 66% of the US popula-
tion.13, 14, 26 While the sample cannot be characterized as
nationally representative, these results offer valuable in-
sight into early indicators of risk and vulnerability to
COVID-19-related stressors. The measures used in this
study were also very brief and therefore excluded many
likely important factors. Although adequately statistically
powered, results should be interpreted with caution given
some of the small effect sizes; these results warrant repli-
cation with longer instruments and multivariate modeling.
Our findings may inform future policy and interventions
particularly given that they suggest heightened vulnerability in
key subgroups. Specifically, we draw attention to the need for
future work to identify and support caregivers, younger adults,
and other minority and disadvantaged groups (e.g., sexual
minority and lower-resourced individuals), as these segments
of our sample indicated higher stress, lower compliance with
prevention behaviors, and/or less adaptive coping strategies.
Based on responses to previous disasters, expectations are of
substantial long-term mental health problems.27 These data,
collected as the COVID-19 pandemic was gaining steam
nationally, underscore the need for more resources to help
individuals create healthy and safe coping responses as the
virus continues to spread as well as the need to prepare for
increased demands for mental health services long after the
pandemic is brought under control.

Finally, we note that reading/hearing about the severity
and contagiousness of COVID-19 was by far the most
c o m m o n l y e xp e r i e n c ed s t r e s s o r
i n o u r s am p l e ,
underscoring that COVID-19 is spreading in the context
of a social-media environment that rapidly connects the
global population to ongoing messages about the virus.
The same environment, however, may create the condi-
tions for effective online communication and dissemina-
tion of resources to help those who are particularly vul-
nerable to cope more adaptively in the coming months. 28
