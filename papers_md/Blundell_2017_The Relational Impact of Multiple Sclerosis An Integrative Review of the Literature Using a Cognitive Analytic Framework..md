Abstract  This integrative literature review uses cognitive 
analytic therapy (CAT) theory to examine the impact of a 
chronic  illness,  multiple  sclerosis  (MS),  on  relationships 
and  mental  health.  Electronic  searches  were  conducted  in 
six medical and social science databases. Thirty-eight arti-
cles met inclusion criteria, and also satisfied quality crite-
ria. Articles revealed that MS-related demands change care 
needs and alter relationships. Using a CAT framework, the 
MS literature was analysed, and five key patterns of relating 
to  oneself  and  to  others  were  identified.  A  diagrammatic 
formulation  is  proposed  that  interconnects  these  patterns 
with  wellbeing  and  suggests  potential  “exits”  to  improve 
mental  health,  for  example,  assisting  families  to  minimise 
overprotection.  Application  of  CAT  analysis  to  the  litera-
ture  clarifies  relational  processes  that  may  affect  mental 
health  among  individuals  with  MS,  which  hopefully  will 
inform  how  services  assist  in  reducing  unhelpful  patterns 
and improve coping. Further investigation of the identified 
patterns is needed.

Introduction

In  the  United  Kingdom,  approximately  15  million  people 
live  with  chronic  illness  (Department  of  Health  [DOH], 
2012).  Chronic  illness  occurs  in  the  context  of  an  indi-
vidual’s  social,  domestic  and  working  lives,  often  causing 
disruption and increasing mental distress. Social support is 
considered  vital  to  effective  coping,  and  families  have  an 
important  role  to  play  in  supporting  adjustment  (Fisher  & 
Weihs,  2000);  however,  chronic  illness  can  threaten  rela-
tionships,  causing  distancing  and  deterioration  (Rolland, 
1999),  thereby  exacerbating  levels  of  distress.  Ameliorat-
ing relationship breakdown and stress may support positive 
health outcomes, but to achieve this, coherent understand-
ings  of  how  chronic  illness  influences  relationships  are 
needed. In this paper, the relational consequences occurring 
for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) will be explored in 
more detail, and a cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) frame-
work  will  then  be  applied  to  make  explicit  the  impact  of 
relational changes upon mental health.

MS  is  a  demanding  neurological  condition,  whose 
symptoms can create a need for social support over a long, 
and  uncertain,  trajectory  (Gulick,  1994).  Symptoms  can 
be  many  and  varied  in  severity,  visibility  and  presence, 
and  can  change  over  time.  MS  typically  onsets  in  early 
adulthood  when  childrearing  and  career  development  are 
key  developmental  tasks.  As  a  chronic,  unpredictable  and 
progressive  condition,  MS  affects  family  and  social  life. 
Among  persons  with  multiple  sclerosis  (pwMS),  there 
is  a  high  incidence  of  comorbid  depression  and  anxiety 
(Korostil  &  Feinstein,  2007;  Sollom  &  Kneebone,  2007), 
and pwMS who believe that MS negatively influences their 
family life are at higher risk for depression (Leonavičius & 
Adomaitienė,  2012).  Poor  negotiation  of  illness-imposed 
relational  changes  may  damage  the  relationships  most

needed to cope well with MS and subsequently negatively 
affect  the  long-term  emotional  wellbeing  of  pwMS  and 
their family members. In order to explore these issues fur-
ther,  it  is  proposed  that  use  of  an  approach  such  as  CAT, 
which  seeks  to  understand  relational  problems  and  their 
interaction with wellbeing, may be helpful.

Cognitive Analytic Therapy

CAT  (Ryle,  1995)  is  a  form  of  psychotherapy  concerned 
with understanding learned patterns of interaction individu-
als  have  developed  with  themselves  and  with  others,  and 
how such patterns connect with psychological distress. This 
review  uses  CAT  theory  and  concepts  to  elucidate  rela-
tional  issues  that  may  affect  the  medical,  social  and  psy-
chological  management  of  MS.  CAT’s  focus  on  mapping 
out relational sequences enables the development of a clear 
conceptual organisation of patterns observed. A clear con-
ceptualisation will facilitate transfer of research knowledge 
into practice to inform care and treatment. CAT is relevant 
to  MS  because  it  has  demonstrated  efficacy  and  utility  in 
understanding  relational  issues  and  ameliorating  distress 
with a range of health conditions (e.g., asthma: Chapman, 
Walker, Cluley, & Fabbri, 2000; Walsh, Hagan, & Gamsu, 
2000;  brain  injury:  Rice-Varian,  2011;  diabetes:  Fosbury, 
Bosley,  Ryle,  Sonksen,  &  Judd,  1997;  medically  unex-
plained symptoms: Jenaway, 2011) and mental health diag-
noses (e.g., anorexia nervosa, anxiety disorders, dementia, 
depression,  personality  disorders,  psychosis:  Ryle  &  Kerr, 
2002).  As  far  as  we  are  aware,  this  will  be  the  first  paper 
that  applies  CAT  thinking  and  principles  to  make  clini-
cally relevant sense of published literature on relationships 
in  general,  as  well  as  among  individuals  with  MS  more 
specifically.

According  to  CAT,  key  relational  patterns  are  learned 
in  early  life  experiences  and  form  a  repertoire  that  is  re-
enacted in adult relationships. This repertoire is conceptu-
alised as consisting of reciprocal roles (Ryle, 1995). Each 
reciprocal  role  is  comprised  of  a  parent-derived  (power-
ful) and child-derived (vulnerable) position. Some recipro-
cal  roles  are  maladaptive,  and  identifying  these  brings  an 
opportunity for change and a potential reduction in distress. 
To be clear, in the context of this review, we are not stating 
that  MS  relational  patterns  are  learnt  in  early  childhood; 
rather, we assert that in the context of living with MS, pat-
terns  will  often  mirror  parent–child  positions  due  to  the 
fact that chronic illness often leaves individuals feeling vul-
nerable and powerless.

Once  reciprocal  roles  are  identified,  a  sequential  dia‑
grammatic  reformulation  (SDR;  Ryle  &  Kerr,  2002)  is 
developed. An SDR is a graphic representation of a written 
formulation  that  maps  out  a  client’s  difficulties  and  main-
taining  cycles,  i.e.,  cycles  of  repeated  interaction  with  the 

self and others that cause stress and negatively impact well-
being. SDRs are used to help identify and plan “exits” from 
unhelpful  relational  patterns.  In  a  CAT  framework,  “exit” 
points are potential opportunities to change behaviour and 
thinking,  which  can  free  a  client  from  being  caught  up  or 
“trapped”  in  maladaptive,  stress-causing  relational  roles 
and behavioural patterns. Through therapy, clients learn to 
recognize and take advantage of opportunities to exit from 
and  avoid  maladaptive  cycles  of  behaviour  and  thereby 
enhance functioning and wellbeing.

We  will  develop  an  SDR-derived  diagram  for  MS  that 
summarises the literature. Through the use of CAT, we pro-
pose  that  specific  unhelpful  patterns  of  relating  to  others 
will  be  revealed  that  maintain  distress,  alongside  helpful 
patterns that can have the opposite beneficial effect.

Aims

This  review  aims  to  develop  a  coherent  understanding  of 
how MS influences relational functioning and wellbeing. It 
applies the conceptual underpinnings of CAT to refine that 
understanding  and  to  develop  a  diagrammatic  formulation 
of  the  patterns  identified  which  will  highlight  exits  from 
unhelpful patterns. In this way, targets for clinical interven-
tion will be revealed from the literature.

Integrative Review

In  order  to  develop  as  rich  an  understanding  as  possible 
of  the  relationship  factors  in  MS,  we  used  an  integrative 
methodology  to  review  literature  on  the  relationships  of 
individuals with MS, namely how they relate to themselves, 
their  loved  ones,  and  society.  Integrative  reviews  combine 
evidence from experimental and non-experimental research 
in order to develop a fuller understanding of a phenomenon 
of  concern  (Whittemore  &  Knafl,  2005).  Following  the 
problem  identification,  literature  search  and  data  evalua-
tion stages, the final stages in an integrative review are data 
analysis  and  presentation.  Data  must  be  extracted,  coded 
and compared in order to identify themes. Data were syn-
thesised using a CAT framework and are presented within 
that framework.

Method

Search Strategy

Database searches were carried out on Ovid MEDLINE(R), 
Web  of  Science  (WoS),  PsycINFO,  Cumulative  Index  to 
Nursing  and  Allied  Health  Literature  (CINAHL),  Pub-
Med and International Bibliography of the Social Sciences 
(IBSS)  to  identify  relevant  studies  on  MS.  Articles  were 

1 3318 

J Clin Psychol Med Settings (2017) 24:316–340

searched from the inception of each database to July 2014. 
Relevant  articles  were  also  drawn  from  reference  lists  or 
the  “Related  Citations”  function  on  PubMed.  The  search 
strategy and screening process are illustrated in Fig. 1.

The following terms were combined for searching with a 

limit of “English language only” where possible:

“Multiple Sclerosis”
AND (relationships OR impact)
AND (family OR spouse OR identity OR social support)

Articles  were  included  if  they  provided  specific  infor-
mation  about  the  effect  of  MS  on  relationship  with  sense 
of self and/or relationships with others and the issues that 
can  arise  (thoughts,  feelings,  behaviours).  Excluded  pub-
lications  included  those  not  directly  relevant  to  the  topic, 
medical  articles,  case  studies,  book  chapters,  non-English 
language publications, and those addressing paediatric MS.

Data Evaluation

Article  quality  was  assessed  using  checklists  adapted  for 
this particular review from those used by Bogosian, Moss-
Morris,  and  Hadwin  (2010).  Tables  1  and  2  detail  the 
checklists  that  were  used  to  assess  quantitative  and  quali-
tative studies, respectively. For each study, the first author 
(JBJ)  rated  each  checklist  item  as  either  positive  or  nega-
tive;  the  total  number  of  positives  was  subsequently  cal-
culated,  and  this  score  was  used  to  assign  an  overall  rat-
ing of good (G), medium (M) or poor (P) quality. Table 3 
illustrates  the  scores  required  for  quality  classifications. 
Twenty-eight  studies  were  classified  as  good  quality  and 
ten  as  medium.  The  second  and  third  authors  indepen-
dently rated two randomly selected articles each. These rat-
ings were directly compared with those of the first author. 
Whilst overall quality ratings did not differ, seven instances 
of  inter-rater  disagreement  were  found  across  the  four

patterns  of  relating  to  self  and  others  as  revealed  by 
behaviours, thoughts, and feelings reported in the context 
of relational interactions. Initially, annotations were made 
in article margins of words used to describe: the nature of 
relationships, how individuals were left feeling by others, 
and  how  others  were  experienced  as  behaving.  JBJ  sub-
sequently  collated  the  large  number  of  relational  words 
generated.  Through  discussion,  the  authors  gradually 
grouped  and  formed  clusters  of  these  relational  words, 
synthesised  them,  and  generated  a  smaller  set  of  terms 
that  captured  major  relational  themes  across  all  the  arti-
cles.  From  this  smaller  set,  pairs  of  themes  were  jointly 
constructed that mirrored CAT reciprocal roles (see Ryle, 
1995).  Although  CAT  has  a  set  of  common  childhood-
derived reciprocal role patterns (Ryle & Kerr, 2002), the 
labels for these reciprocal roles are not fixed, and so they 
can be adapted to the language of each individual client. 
JBJ “verified” the final set of pairings by checking it was 
grounded  in  and  evidenced  by  article  data  as  each  arti-
cle  was  read  again.  Resultant  themes  and  diagrammatic 
formulation  were  discussed  with  a  psychologist  work-
ing  therapeutically  with  pwMS  and  an  accredited  CAT 
practitioner.

Structure for Data Presentation

In  this  paper,  descriptive  and  quality  data  regarding  the 
included articles will be presented first. We will then pro-
vide  an  overview  of  the  article  content  making  reference 
to the tabular data provided. Finally, we will expound our 
innovative  CAT  informed  synthesis  of  the  literature,  dis-
cussing the five common relational responses we have iden-
tified,  here  called  reciprocal  roles.  CAT  understands  that 
relational  patterns  are  enacted  in  intimate  and  wider  rela-
tionships,  so  both  will  be  discussed  from  the  perspectives 
of pwMS as well as family members. The evidence for the 
different  relational  patterns  will  be  presented  in  turn,  and 
their connection with wellbeing considered with the aid of 
an SDR-derived diagram.

The  literature  concerning  relationships  between  pwMS 
and  others  (i.e.,  partners,  children,  wider  family,  friends, 
acquaintances,  healthcare  professionals,  strangers  and 
society  as  a  whole)  was  considered,  and  results  will  be 
presented using CAT reciprocal roles. Table  4 categorizes 
the  studies  in  this  review  according  to  type  of  participant 
studied,  e.g.,  whether  pwMS  or  a  specific  type  of  other. 
Of  the  six  types  of  participant  samples,  the  majority  of 
studies  were  pwMS  (n = 18).  Studies  also  investigated  the 
unique experiences of family members, and some looked at 
pwMS  concurrently  with  their  relatives.  Five  studies  used 
quantitative methods, obtaining data via surveys and ques-
tionnaires; four of these were cross-sectional and one com-
pared  questionnaire  data  at  two  time  points  (Pakenham  & 
Cox,  2012;  Row  5  of  Table  7).  The  methodology  of  most 
of  the  qualitative  studies  can  be  classified  as  belonging 
to  one  of  5  well-known  methods  (see  Table  5  for  a  brief 
description of these methods). However, some studies used 
methods  uncommon  in  psychological  research,  or  did  not 
provide  sufficient  information  in  their  methods  section  to 
allow  classification.  For  example,  the  method  section  of 
Courts,  Newton,  and  McNeal  (2005;  Row  7  of  Table  6) 
hints at inductive thematic analysis but it is not stated. The 
most frequently used methodology was inductive thematic 
analysis (ITA; n = 10), followed by interpretative phenom-
enological  analysis  and  by  constant  comparative  analysis 
(n = 5, respectively). ITA, is a widely-used qualitative ana-
lytic method, yet it is notoriously hard to characterise as all 
qualitative  methods  are  trying  to  identify  themes.  In  gen-
eral, ITA involves descriptively “coding” answers for issues 
of interest to the research question. The approach is “induc-
tive”  because  the  themes  that  develop  from  linking  codes 
are intimately bound with the data they represent; labels are 
not  forced  onto  the  data  based  on  theory.  As  indicated  in 
Table 5, there is substantial overlap with other methodolo-
gies. For example, in all methods, to develop broader level 
themes, initial codes are reviewed and compared with oth-
ers iteratively.

There  were  no  clear  differences  between  the  data  pro-
vided by good versus medium quality studies. Additionally, 
there  were  no  clear  differences  between  the  data  provided 
by  quantitative  versus  qualitative  studies,  although  the 
qualitative studies do provide more detailed information on 
the lived experiences of pwMS and their loved ones. How-
ever, we will not focus further on any differences between 
quantitative  and  qualitative  studies;  the  purpose  of  this 
integrative study is to combine and synthesize information 
from studies of both types rather than focus on differences 
between them.

Key Findings

The findings displayed in Tables 6 and 7 highlight that MS 
can  negatively  affect  independence  by  creating  a  need  for 
care over a long period of time. Although the nature of the 
extra  care needed may vary, there was  clear evidence that 
roles  changed;  MS  meant  partners  and  children  became 
“caregivers” (In Table 6 see: Row 13, Esmail et al., 2010; 
Row 16; Hughes et al., 2013; Row 17; Irvine et al., 2009; 
Row  18;  Jonzon  &  Goodwin,  2012;  Row  19;  Koch  et  al., 
2002;  see  also  Row  1  of  Table  7;  Green  &  Todd,  2008). 
In  romantic  relationships,  partners  no  longer  offered  and 
received  care  equally,  and  mutuality,  that  is  a  sense  of 
shared activities, values, and emotional closeness (Park & 
Schumacher, 2014), could be lost. Not only was this change 
challenging  for  loved  ones,  but  pwMS  felt  they  were  a 
burden (In Table 6 see: Row 12, Esmail et al., 2007; Row 
26; Olsson et al., 2005). Many domains of life changed, or 
were affected, and such effects were particularly influenced 

by  symptom  severity.  The  literature  revealed  families  and 
pwMS  could  respond  in  different  ways  to  this  increasing 
need  for  care,  and  these  data  are  drawn  upon  for  the  con-
ceptual CAT analysis.

wellbeing.  Whilst  the  focus  in  the  diagram  is  on  conse-
quences  for  pwMS,  in  the  following  text  we  note  experi-
ences of significant others too.

The  uppermost  rectangle  in  Fig.  2  summarizes  chal-
lenging features that MS poses for pwMS and their family 
members and caregivers. The middle cross-section of Fig. 2 
displays five rectangles representing the five reciprocal role 
relationships identified between pwMS and others (that are 
also  enacted  with  oneself)  that  are  important  for  under-
standing the psychosocial consequences of MS. The lower 
third of Fig. 2 displays pwMS’ emotional and behavioural 
responses to four reciprocal role patterns leading to poten-
tially negative psychological consequences for pwMS, and 
one  relational  pattern  with  more  beneficial  consequences. 
The  thin-line  arrows  that  form  connective  paths  between 
components  of  Fig.  2  are  shown  as  two-sided  arrows  to 
highlight the bidirectional causal paths that are considered 
likely to characterize the relationships between components 
shown in Fig. 2. The large arrows with superscripts depict 
possible  exit  points  from  unhelpful  interaction  cycles, 
which  also  are  potential  points  for  professional  interven-
tion. This component of Fig. 2 will be further explained at 
the end of the "Results" section.

Overprotective–Controlled Reciprocal Role

Dependency  was  uncomfortable  for  many  pwMS,  even 
infuriating  (In  Table  6  see:  Row  9,  Dyck,  1995;  Row  10; 
Edmonds  et  al.,  2007a;  Row  17;  Irvine  et  al.,  2009;  Row 
32; Reynolds & Prior, 2003; In Table 7 see Row 1; Green 
&  Todd,  2008).  Although  partners  were  considered  vital 
for  support  (physical,  emotional,  financial),  MS-induced 
changes in dependence meant care could become overbear-
ing,  which  caused  relational  strain  and  tension.  The  influ-
ence and/or presence of MS could become overemphasised 
by  family  members  (Grytten  &  Måseide,  2006;  Row  15 
of  Table  6),  and  when  this  happened,  pwMS  felt  more  ill 
(see also Olsson et al., 2011; Row 28 of Table 6). They felt 
infantilised  and  pitied,  that  the  expectations  others  had  of 
them were low and that they were no longer given responsi-
bility (In Table 6 see: Row 27, Olsson et al., 2011; Row 31; 
Power, 1985). Partners of pwMS desired to be supportive, 
but partners also recognised they could be hypervigilant to 
difficulties  and  overprotective  (Courts  et  al.,  2005;  Row  7 
of  Table  6).  PwMS  believed  partners  did  not  like  watch-
ing them struggle with tasks, and so would intervene pre-
maturely.  Overinvolvement  of  family  could  lead  pwMS  to 
withdraw, which resulted in isolation (Grytten & Måseide, 
2006; Row 15 of Table 6) and added to overwhelming feel-
ings. Overprotection seemed to be either a family’s attempt 
to be supportive, or a method for managing their own anxi-
ety. Rather than being experienced as supportive by pwMS, 
well-meaning  interventions  often  had  an  opposite  effect;

Intrusive–Intruded Upon Reciprocal Role

MS  intruded  into  the  lives  of  pwMS,  their  friends  and 
family.  A  number  of  aspects  of  MS  were  experienced  as 
intrusive,  demanding  and  overwhelming,  not  least  the 
unpredictability  of  symptoms.  Women  expressed  feeling 
that  MS  “had  captured”  their  body,  which  had  become 
untrustworthy  and  left  them  feeling  powerless  (Olsson 
et al., 2008; Row 27 of Table 6). Concerns about managing 
particularly troublesome symptoms like fatigue and bowel 
dysfunction  invaded  everyday  life;  social  events  or  excur-
sions had to be planned (In Table 6 see: Row 22, Malcom-
son  et  al.,  2008;  Row  23;  McClurg  et  al.,  2012),  and  life 
could no longer be spontaneous (Mozo-Dutton et al., 2012; 
Row 24 of Table 6). PwMS could not participate as before; 
employment was restricted and roles that helped form iden-
tity could not be performed (In Table 6 see: Row 9, Dyck, 
1995;  Row  14;  Galushko  et  al.,  2014;  Row  24;  Mozo-
Dutton  et  al.,  2012;  in  Table  7  see  Row  2;  Hakim  et  al., 
2000),  which  was  accompanied  by  a  sense  of  loss.  Assis-
tance was necessary at times to manage symptoms, but this 

intrusion into personal space by services could be difficult 
(In Table 6 see: Row 5, Bowen et al., 2011; Row 9; Dyck, 
1995; Row 27; Olsson et al., 2008).

MS also affected motherhood, even intruding into deci-
sions  about  becoming  a  parent  (Table  6  see:  Row  20, 
Kosmala-Anderson  &  Wallace,  2013;  Row  29;  Payne  & 
McPherson,  2010).  Women  reported  a  tension  between 
wanting  to  be  an  “ideal  mother”  and  needing  to  conserve 
energy  to  look  after  their  own  health  (Payne  &  McPher-
son, 2010; Row 29 of Table 6). Many parents were acutely 
aware  that  their  children’s  educational  performance  and 
wellbeing  were  affected  by  parental  MS  (Green  &  Todd, 
2008; Row 1 of Table 7). When MS intruded on their abil-
ity  to  be  a  “good  mother”  or  fulfill  their  duties,  women 
were left feeling guilty and devastated (In Table 6 see: Row 
26, Olsson et al., 2005; Row 32; Reynolds & Prior, 2003). 
Women did not want to lose their care provider role (Payne 
&  McPherson,  2010;  Row  29  of  Table  6),  but  MS  posed 
“an ever present threat of turning partners and children into 
caregivers”  (Reynolds  &  Prior,  2003,  p.  1236;  Row  32  of 
Table 6).

Symptoms  meant  pwMS  required  greater  levels  of 
assistance,  yet  requests  for  support  could  be  perceived  as 
demanding  by  family  members.  Increased  responsibilities,

especially  social-emotional  and  instrumental  tasks,  could 
overwhelm  children,  and  the  children’s  needs  could  be 
overlooked  as  they  had  to  assume  parental  or  adult-like 
roles.  Caregiving  encroached  upon  play,  and  guilt  and 
worry  made  it  hard  for  children  to  enjoy  life  at  times  (In 
Table  6  see:  Row  18,  Jonzon  &  Goodwin,  2012;  Row 
33;  Turpin  et  al.,  2008;  In  Table  7  see  Row  5;  Pakenham 
&  Cox,  2012).  MS  was  also  a  constant  source  of  worry 
for  partners  and  other  relatives  (In  Table  6  see:  Row  2, 
Bogosian et al., 2009; Row 6; Bowen et al., 2011; Row 6; 
Cheung  &  Hocking,  2004;  Row  25;  Mutch,  2010).  Rela-
tives shared their own feelings and problems less, and the 
relatives’  own  needs  became  side-lined  (In  Table  6  see: 
Row 1, Boeije et al., 2003; Row 2; Bogosian et al., 2009; 
Row 25; Mutch, 2010). Partners felt they lost control over 
their lives; they needed space yet often suffered in silence 
as  social  support  felt  “out  of  reach.”  These  feelings  were 
overwhelming  for  family  members  (In  Table  6  see:  Row 
1, Boeije et al., 2003; Row 7; Courts et al., 2005; Row 8; 
DesRosier  et  al.,  1992;  Row  13;  Esmail  et  al.,  2010).  MS 
dictated partners’ social lives as activities were planned to 
accommodate  physical  symptoms,  or  did  not  happen  (In 
Table 6 see: Row 2, Bogosian et al., 2009; Row 4; Boland 
et al., 2012; Row 7; Courts et al., 2005).

Ignoring–Neglected Reciprocal Role

When  symptoms  limited  participation  and  care  needs 
increased,  pwMS  reported  that  friendships  “drifted,”  and 
activities  that  were  once  shared  were  no  longer  enjoyed 
together, resulting in them feeling “left behind,” neglected 
and  separated  from  others  (In  Table  6  see:  Row  14, 
Galushko et al., 2014; Row 19; Koch et al., 2002; Row 24; 
Mozo-Dutton  et  al.,  2012;  Row  27;  Olsson  et  al.,  2008; 
Row 30; Ploughman et al., 2012). Social interactions could 
leave pwMS feeling unimportant, under scrutiny and disbe-
lieved (Olsson et al., 2011; Row 28 of Table 5); pwMS felt 
others  lacked  awareness  about  the  impact  of  “hidden”  yet 
debilitating  symptoms  like  fatigue  (Green  &  Todd,  2008, 
Row 1 of Table 7; Olsson et al., 2005, Row 27 of Table 6). 
Sometimes families denied or ignored the existence of MS 
and/or its consequences, even refusing to talk about the ill-
ness (In Table 6 see: Row 28, Olsson et al., 2011; Row 31; 
Power,  1985;  In  Table  7  see:  Row  4;  Özdemir  &  Aşiret, 
2011). This “violation of self” (Grytten & Måseide, 2006, 
p. 200; Row 15 of Table 6) left pwMS feeling invalidated 
and  negatively  impacted  pwMS’  wellbeing.  The  reason 
for others’ refusal to acknowledge MS was not stated, but 
it  may  relate  to  the  intrusive  nature  of  MS;  perhaps  they 
wish  to  avoid  being  burdened  by  complaints  and  requests 
for help, or they may desire to minimise embarrassment by 
not drawing attention to points of difference such as visible 
MS symptoms or obvious changes in abilities.

Loved  ones  of  pwMS  also  felt  that  friends  and  family 
did not recognise or understand what they face (In Table 6 
see:  Row  1,  Boeije  et  al.,  2003;  Row  2;  Bogosian  et  al., 
2009;  Row  5;  Bowen  et  al.,  2011;  Row  7;  Courts  et  al., 
2005; Row 18; Jonzon & Goodwin, 2012). Children of par-
ents with MS reported others have minimised their experi-
ence of having to cope with a parent’s MS (Bogosian et al., 
2011;  Row  3  of  Table  6),  and  caregiver  daughters  noted 
their  own  needs  felt  invisible;  they  wanted  more  support 
and  acknowledgement  of  their  role  (Jonzon  &  Goodwin, 
2012; Row 18 of Table 6).

PwMS and caregivers felt ignored and neglected by ser-
vices; they felt they had to “fight for everything” in relation 
to  accessing  care;  waits  were  too  long,  concerns  were  not 
taken seriously and consultations were too short (In Table 6 
see:  Row  11,  Edmonds  et  al.,  2007b;  Row  14;  Galushko 
et  al.,  2014).  Staff  changes,  service  inconsistency  and 
inflexibility,  alongside  a  lack  of  coordinated  care,  exacer-
bated the feeling that their needs were neglected (In Table 6 
see: Row 6, Cheung & Hocking, 2004; Row 11; Edmonds 
et al.,  2007b; Row 30; Ploughman et al., 2012).  At times, 
health and social care staff lacked empathy and were “use-
less” or poorly trained in dealing with MS (In Table 6 see: 
Row 2, Bogosian et al., 2009; Row 6; Cheung & Hocking, 
2004), leaving relatives worried, frustrated, and reluctant to 
request  support  (In  Table  6  see:  Row  6,  Cheung  &  Hock-
ing, 2004; Row 30; Ploughman et al., 2012). Relevant reli-
able  information  about  MS,  especially  related  to  specific 
concerns  like  childbearing  and  bowel  dysfunction,  was 
desperately  wanted,  but  pwMS  and  caregivers  felt  it  was 
not available and that they were deserted, unsupported and 
“fobbed off” by health professionals (In Table 6 see: Row 
5,  Bowen  et  al.,  2011;  Row  11;  Edmonds  et  al.,  2007b; 
Row  14;  Galushko  et  al.,  2014;  Row  20;  Kosmala-Ander-
son  &  Wallace,  2013;  Row  22;  Malcomson  et  al.,  2008; 
Row 23; McClurg et al., 2012; Row 26; Olsson et al., 2008, 
2011;  Row  27;  Row  30;  Ploughman  et  al.,  2012).  PwMS 
expressed  reluctance  to  raise  the  issue  of  bowel  dysfunc-
tion,  feeling  that  it  was  a  “dirty  secret”  even  in  a  medical 
setting  (McClurg  et  al.,  2012,  p.  16;  Row  23  of  Table  6). 
Having  experiences  being  ignored  and  invalidated  left 
pwMS and their families feeling neglected, powerless and 
even hopeless.

Rejecting–Rejected Reciprocal Role

Many  changes  brought  by  MS  were  resented  (In  Table  6 
see:  Row  16,  Hughes  et  al.,  2013;  Row  31;  Power,  1985; 
Row 33; Turpin et al., 2008); in particular, family members 
wanted to resist the caregiver role enforced by MS, and to 
assert and retain their identity as a husband, wife, or daugh-
ter  (In  Table  6  see:  Row  1,  Boeije  et  al.,  2003;  Row  16; 
Hughes  et  al.,  2013;  Row  18;  Jonzon  &  Goodwin,  2012). 

1 3334 

J Clin Psychol Med Settings (2017) 24:316–340

Familial  responses  to  changed  abilities,  the  changed  need 
for care, and the intrusive and overwhelming nature of MS 
could  be  experienced  by  pwMS  as  hostile  or  unkind  (In 
Table 6 see: Row 21, Kralik et al., 2003; Row 31; Power, 
1985). Such circumstances can exacerbate feelings of con-
flict and distancing in a relationship, especially when part-
ners have different coping styles (Boland et al., 2012; Row 
4, Table 6). While outright “rejection” by family was rarely 
reported, MS has been associated with relationship break-
down  (In  Table  6  see:  Row  13,  Esmail  et  al.,  2010;  Row 
14; Galushko et al., 2014; In Table 7 see Row 3; McCabe 
et  al.,  1996).  MS  affects  sexual  functioning  (see  Schmidt, 
Hofmann, Niederwieser, Kapfhammer, & Bonelli, 2005 for 
a review), and women reported that partners do not under-
stand  their  experience  of  sex  in  the  context  of  MS  (e.g., 
Esmail  et  al.,  2007;  Row  12  of  Table  6),  which  caused  a 
relational barrier.

The  literature  revealed  that  pwMS  could  reject  them-
selves.  MS-related  bodily  changes,  especially  those  that 
are  visible,  can  “violate”  one’s  sense  of  personal  dignity 
(Olsson  et  al.,  2008;  Row  27  of  Table  6).  Such  changes 
could seriously shake self-esteem, and self-confidence, and 
caused  some  pwMS  to  feel  they  are  not  the  same  person 
they once were (In Table 6 see: Row 17, Irvine et al., 2009; 
Row  21;  Kralik  et  al.,  2003;  Row  22;  Malcomson  et  al., 
2008; Row 23; McClurg et al., 2012; Row 27; Olsson et al., 
2008; In Table 7 see Row 1; Green & Todd, 2008). A body-
self  separation  has  been  reported  with  pwMS  seeing  their 
body as an adversary that could no longer be relied upon; 
individuals  felt  useless  and  like  a  “failure”  (In  Table  6 
see:  Row  24,  Mozo-Dutton  et  al.,  2012;  Row  27;  Olsson 
et  al.,  2008).  Furthermore,  pwMS  who  were  interviewed 
about bowel dysfunction (McClurg et al., 2012; Row 23 of 
Table  6)  viewed  their  body  as  having  let  them  down  and 
stigmatised  them;  their  body  became  a  source  of  disgust, 
which influenced their readiness to engage in social interac-
tion. They feared derision and embarrassment if they had a 
bowel accident, and therefore avoided going out (McClurg 
et al., 2012).

PwMS’  social  involvement  was  influenced  by  the  atti-
tudes  of  others,  and  not  just  the  logistics  of  organising 
trips;  pwMS  felt  others  seemed  uncomfortable  or  embar-
rassed  in  their  presence  (Green  &  Todd,  2008,  Row  1  of 
Table  7;  Irvine  et  al.,  2009,  Row  17  of  Table  6).  Women 
felt  they  would  be  and  were  avoided  or  ignored  (Olsson 
et al., 2008, Row 27 of Table 6), and family noticed a reluc-
tance or refusal to socialise (In Table 6 see: Row 2, Bogo-
sian et al., 2009; Row 31; Power, 1985). Half of Özdemir 
and  Aşiret’s  (2011;  Row  4  of  Table  7)  participants  felt 
uncomfortable  socially,  feeling  anxious,  insecure,  jealous, 
ashamed  and  worthless.  While  pwMS  may  reject  interac-
tions  with  others  to  protect  themselves,  there  were  also 
physical  barriers  which  precluded  involvement  in  social 

activities, such as poor wheelchair access (In Table 6 see: 
Row 7, Courts et al., 2005; Row 14, Galushko et al., 2014; 
Row  32;  Reynolds  &  Prior,  2003;  In  Table  7  see:  Row  4; 
Özdemir & Aşiret, 2011). Reynolds and Prior (2003; Row 
32  of  Table  6)  identified  social  discrimination  and  stig-
matization as common features of living with MS; pwMS 
expressed anxiety about using devices such as wheelchairs 
as  others  can  relate  to  the  disability  instead  of  the  person 
(Ploughman  et  al.,  2012;  Row  30  of  Table  6).  Adolescent 
children  reported  frustration  with  how  others  treated  their 
MS  parent,  e.g.,  staring,  patronising,  completely  ignoring 
(Bogosian et al., 2011; Row 3 of Table 6). PwMS expressed 
feeling rejected by a society that values individual contribu-
tions; they felt they had lost “normal” adult status and did 
not have the same worth as others (In Table 6 see: Row 27, 
Olsson  et  al.,  2008,  2011;  Row  28;  Row  32;  Reynolds  & 
Prior,  2003).  While  families  may  channel  their  frustration 
into advocacy or activism (Hughes et al., 2013; Row 16 of 
Table 6), pwMS can be left feeling dejected and wanting to 
disengage.

Accepting–Supported Reciprocal Role

The  unhelpful  patterns  of  relating  noted  above  emerge 
from  the  increased  need  for  care,  but  dysfunction  is  not 
the whole story; pwMS also report positive relational out-
comes.  The  literature  revealed  one  key  helpful  recipro-
cal role pattern, accepting–supported, and as shown in the 
right-hand side of Fig. 2, this reciprocal role can positively 
affect wellbeing.

The  caregiver  role  was  embraced  by  some  loved  ones 
(Hughes et al., 2013; Row 16 of Table 6), and gender dif-
ferences were observed in how this manifested itself. Men 
were “protectors” and “enablers” helping their wives con-
serve energy, making sure their wives engaged in activities 
that  promoted  self-worth,  such  as  helping  them  be  moth-
ers  and  manage  parental  responsibilities  (In  Table  6  see: 
Row 7, Courts et al., 2005; Row 29; Payne & McPherson, 
2010). Women were “advocates,” obtaining necessary sup-
ports while encouraging their husband’s independence, and 
keeping their husbands involved (see also Bogosian et al., 
2009; Row 2 of Table 6). Both sorts of behaviour appeared 
accepting  and  encouraging,  but  the  perceptions  of  pwMS 
were not investigated. In the face of MS-related adversity, 
couples  found  they  could  still  admire  and  respect  each 
other,  work  as  a  team,  feel  committed  to  each  other,  that 
they  were  in  it  together,  and  had  become  better  commu-
nicators (In Table 6 see: Row 4, Boland et al., 2012; Row 
13; Esmail et al., 2010; Row 25; Mutch, 2010). PwMS felt 
useful and involved through contributing and trying to help 
whenever possible, assisted by loved ones being open to re-
negotiating task allocation (In Table 6 see: Row 1, Boeije 
et al., 2003; Row 4; Boland et al., 2012; Row 16; Hughes 

1 3J Clin Psychol Med Settings (2017) 24:316–340 

335

et al., 2013; Row 29; Payne & McPherson, 2010; Row 31; 
Power, 1985). Supporting each other brought balance back 
into  relationships  and  facilitated  ongoing  participation  in 
family life, which was hugely valued by pwMS.

Positive reactions and affirmation from loved ones were 
a highly valued source of hope that enabled pwMS to cope 
with MS (In Table 6 see: Row 17, Irvine et al., 2009; Row 
21; Kralik et al., 2003; Row 22; Malcomson et al., 2008). 
Understanding  and  acceptance  in  the  face  of  changes  in 
sexual functioning also was very important (In Table 6 see: 
Row  12,  Esmail  et  al.,  2007,  2010;  Row  13).  Women  felt 
changed in the eyes of their partners, e.g., “I’m not the girl 
he  married,”  and  they  needed  to  feel  valued  regardless  of 
MS (In Table 6 see: Row 17, Irvine et al., 2009; Row 19; 
Koch  et  al.,  2002).  Self-acceptance  was  challenging  for 
pwMS, but engaging in activities that provided a sense of 
personal continuity was helpful, and slowly, the self was re-
negotiated  with  MS  integrated  as  one  part  of  the  self  (In 
Table  6  see:  Row  24,  Mozo-Dutton  et  al.,  2012;  Row  32; 
Reynolds & Prior, 2003). Over time the changed body was 
accepted,  and  recognising  its  frailty,  pwMS  nurtured  and 
worked with their body and dealt with limitations imposed 
by  MS  (Kralik  et  al.,  2003;  Row  21  of  Table  6).  PwMS 
managed  their  symptoms,  and  were  able  to  do  important 
things like being with family; mothers found creative solu-
tions  to  cope  with  any  MS-imposed  limitations  (Payne  & 
McPherson,  2010;  Row  29  of  Table  6).  Acceptance  was 
not  synonymous  with  “giving  in”  or  “giving  up.”  Instead, 
acceptance  meant  constantly  adjusting  and  adapting  while 
trying  to  keep  life  as  normal  as  possible;  it  meant  living 
with MS while maintaining a sense of fighting it (In Table 6 
see: Row 12, Esmail et al., 2007; Row 14; Galushko et al., 
2014; Row 24; Mozo-Dutton et al., 2012; Row 27; Olsson 
et al., 2008; Row 29; Payne & McPherson, 2010; Row 30; 
Ploughman et al., 2012; Row 32; Reynolds & Prior, 2003).

Accepting  MS  also  meant  asking  for  and  letting  others 
help,  which  was  a  proactive  choice  “to  take  part  in  life” 
(Olsson et al., 2008, p. 423; Row 27 of Table 6). Support 
from  services  helped  maintain  independence,  and  access 
to an array of providers gave security (In Table 6: Row 9, 
Dyck,  1995;  Row  30;  Ploughman  et  al.,  2012).  Two-way 
communication  with  health  professionals  was  vital,  and 
while  some  literature  suggests  that  such  positive  experi-
ences may be in a minority (Malcomson et al., 2008; Row 
22  of  Table  6),  two-way  communication  with  profession-
als left pwMS feeling reassured, listened to, and taken seri-
ously (In Table 6: Row 20, Kosmala-Anderson & Wallace, 
2013;  Row  28;  Olsson  et  al.,  2011;  Row  30;  Ploughman 
et  al.,  2012).  Being  accepted  and  understood  in  this  way 
was accompanied by a sense of relief.

(In Table 6: Row 28, Olsson et al., 2011; Row 32; Reynolds 
& Prior, 2003). New friendships could develop too, and MS 
support groups could be a source of support where “every-
body understands and everybody knows” (In Table 6: Row 
17, Irvine et al., 2009, p. 4; Row 28; Olsson et al., 2011). 
Loved ones also needed someone to listen (In Table 6: Row 
2,  Bogosian  et  al.,  2009;  Row  8;  DesRosier  et  al.,  1992; 
Row 18; Jonzon & Goodwin, 2012), and the availability of 
a good support network (parent, family, and friends) medi-
ated the impact of parental MS for adolescents: ‘You can’t 
underestimate  how  much  family  helps’  (Bogosian  et  al., 
2011, p. 435; Row 3 of Table 6).

The SDR‑Derived Diagram: Getting Out of Negative 
Cycles

Figure  2  displays  how  the  reciprocal  role  patterns  that 
emerged out of the analysis of the literature may fit together 
in  ways  that  affect  wellbeing,  either  positively  or  nega-
tively. With patterns mapped out in this way, points of exit 
are  more  easily  identified.  Exits  afford  opportunities  for 
individuals  to  stop  being  trapped  in  dysfunctional  cycles 
of  behaviour  and  relating.  At  each  large  arrow  in  Fig.  2, 
there is a potential for something to be done differently, i.e., 
to  exit  and  avoid  looping  back  into  unhelpful  cycles.  All 
behavioural  expressions  of  the  accepting–supported  recip-
rocal role noted above are considered exits from unhelpful 
patterns,  and  further  to  this,  we  will  now  discuss  specific 
exit points shown in Fig. 2.

a‑Exits

The four large arrows with a‑superscripts highlight the real-
ity that an increase in pwMS’ need for care has the poten-
tial to elicit responses from caregivers and family members 
that are over-protective, intrusive, ignoring, or rejecting in 
nature  and  that  these  relational  styles  have  negative  inter-
personal and psychosocial consequences for pwMS. Nega-
tive  reactions  from  significant  others  can  increase  dis-
tress  whereas  supportive  reactions  can  assist  adjustment 
(In  Table  6:  Row  21,  Kralik  et  al.,  2003;  Row  27;  Olsson 
et al., 2008; Row 31; Power, 1985), so whenever there are 
changes in care needs, these must be named and discussed 
to enable families and pwMS to meet the related challenges 
and  minimise  negative  outcomes.  At  times,  this  process 
may necessitate support from responsive, accessible health 
care teams.

b‑Exits

Supportive  and  accepting  social  relationships  were 
important  for  pwMS;  it  felt  good  to  be  welcomed  by  old 
friends in the same way as they were before MS appeared 

On  the  left  side  of  Fig.  2,  two  large  arrows  with  b-super-
scripts  focus  on  two  types  of  overbearing  care,  i.e.,  over-
protective care or intrusive care, which can leave the “done 

1 3336 

J Clin Psychol Med Settings (2017) 24:316–340

to” person feeling controlled by or intruded upon by others. 
Such  experiences  are  likely  to  negatively  impact  pwMS’ 
wellbeing.  Although  overbearing  care  may  be  well-inten-
tioned,  caregiver-pwMS  dyads  may  need  help  negotiating 
what support is actually needed and wanted; partners may 
need to learn to not intervene too soon. Some pwMS may 
need to learn to “speak up” in tactful ways, to vocalise that 
even  if  tasks  take  twice  as  long,  the  sense  of  accomplish-
ment they experience is helpful to them (Irvine et al., 2009; 
Row 32 of Table 6). When MS intrudes, pwMS may need 
support  to  adapt  activities  or  find  alternative  meaningful 
occupations,  which  can  help  maintain  quality  of  life  and 
self-esteem (Reynolds & Prior, 2003; Row 32 of Table 6). 
With respect to helping caregivers behave in ways that are 
less  controlling  and  less  intrusive,  family  members  may 
need  support  and  encouragement  to  take  time  for  them-
selves,  to  step  back  and  take  breaks  that  allow  them  to 
reflect upon and more effectively manage their own behav-
iours in ways less likely to elicit negative consequences, for 
themselves and for their loved one with MS.

c‑Exits

The  lower  portion  of  Fig.  2  displays  an  arrow  with  a 
c-superscript  that  focuses  directly  on  pwMS’  behaviours 
that relate to managing emotional pain and counterproduc-
tive reactions that worsen pwMS’ wellbeing. Key strategies 
when feeling overwhelmed are talking and sharing feelings, 
yet pwMS often cope by talking to themselves, as reported 
by almost half of McCabe et al.’s sample (1996; Row 3 of 
Table  7).  Clear  communication  regarding  difficulties  and 
feelings  is  important  (In  Table  6:  Row  11,  Esmail  et  al., 
2007; Row 22; Malcomson et al., 2008) but not easy to do; 
in  fact,  women  with  MS  reported  their  emotional  experi-
ence feels invisible (Blundell Jones, Walsh, & Isaac, 2014). 
Psychological  interventions  could  be  designed  to  help 
pwMS and their families deal more effectively and success-
fully with relational patterns that otherwise might ensnare 
pwMS  in  cycles  of  interpersonal  behaviour  that  further 
decrease pwMS’ morale and self-esteem.

d‑Exits

Arrows  with  d-superscripts  in  Fig.  2  focus  on  familial 
responses to MS that are more negative in nature, namely, 
ignoring  or  rejecting  interaction  patterns,  which  are  very 
likely  to  have  adverse  effects  on  pwMS’  wellbeing.  To 
reduce  the  prevalence  of  these  types  of  reciprocal  roles, 
services could support education for caregivers and family 
members regarding MS so that understanding and acknowl-
edgement  of  difficulties  is  more  prevalent  in  pwMS- 
caregiver/family  relationships.  Both  pwMS  and  their  fam-
ilies  feel  that  others  need  to  be  more  informed  about  MS 

(Courts  et  al.,  2005,  Row  7  of  Table  6;  Green  &  Todd, 
2008;  Row  1  of  Table  7),  and  so  programs  that  increase 
awareness  and  understanding  at  a  societal  level  may  be 
beneficial.  Within  the  family  itself,  denial,  or  incomplete 
acknowledgement of each other’s perspectives, experiences, 
and emotions leaves pwMS and their family members feel-
ing  misunderstood  and  rejected  in  their  interactions  with 
one  another.  One  strategy  to  address  this  problem  would 
be  to  support  pwMS  and  their  families  to  more  success-
fully share their experience with one another. Esmail et al. 
(2010; Row 13 of Table 6) noted the importance of a safe, 
open environment for communication where both partners, 
one  with  MS  and  the  other  healthy,  can  address  issues  as 
they arise and be able to deal with anything that is brought 
to  the  table.  Families  may  require  support  from  providers 
to  develop  such  open  communication  particularly  if  it  is 
something they have struggled with historically.

Discussion

This  integrative  review  has  examined  the  impact  of  MS 
on  familial  and  social  relationships  and  the  links  between 
reciprocal  role  patterns  in  relationships  and  wellbeing. 
Whittemore and Knafl (2005, p. 550) note that the goal of 
data analysis is to provide “a thorough and unbiased inter-
pretation of primary sources, along with an innovative syn-
thesis of the evidence.” Our application of CAT theory has 
met this goal; the theory provided a useful way of concep-
tualising a body of published literature on the effects of MS 
on social relationships among pwMS, caregivers, and fam-
ily  members  that  has  clinical  relevance.  CAT  highlighted 
five patterns of relational behaviour within the data set, and 
the  SDR  approach  enables  clinicians  to  consider  practical 
implications and offer interventions for relationship issues. 
In this section, we consider service implications; provide a 
critical analysis of our approach; and consider future direc-
tions for research.

MS changes the physical body and influences not only 
how individuals with MS view and relate to themselves, 
but also how others view and relate to them. This review 
identified  five  reciprocal  roles  which  appear  intimately 
related  to  the  progressive  nature  of  MS,  which  creates 
a  need  for  care  that  increases  over  time,  makes  heavy 
demands on coping ability, and raises issues of depend-
ency  like  those  that  occur  with  other  chronic  illnesses 
(e.g.,  rheumatoid  arthritis:  Bury,  1982).  The  unpredict-
able nature of MS means that pwMS’ care needs can be 
highly  variable.  Increases  in  symptom  severity  can  be 
temporary, and relapses may be followed by remissions; 
or  symptoms  may  be  enduring  with  functional  losses 
and  progressive  deterioration.  Every  family  member  is 
touched  by  the  challenge  of  dealing  with  MS  (Bowen 

1 3J Clin Psychol Med Settings (2017) 24:316–340 

337

et  al.,  2011).  The  burdens  of  caregiving  can  create  dis-
tance  between  pwMS  and  their  loved  ones  (Grytten  & 
Måseide,  2006).  Relationships  among  family  members 
may  need  “remodelling”  (Lyons  &  Meade,  1995),  and 
if  relationship  changes  are  not  successfully  negotiated, 
stress  increases  and  mental  health  can  deteriorate  for 
pwMS, and for loved ones.

The  reciprocal  role  relationship  patterns  we  high-
lighted  make  a  difference  for  coping,  adjustment,  and 
wellbeing;  how  pwMS  and  their  families  respond  to 
the  increased  need  to  “be  cared  for”  underpins  the  link 
between  mental  health  and  chronic  illness.  Using  CAT 
terminology,  Walsh  et  al.  (2000,  p.  164)  noted  that 
chronic  illness  can  place  the  affected  individual  in  a 
child-like  relational  position  of  feeling  vulnerable  and 
lacking in control. Being “cared for,” can result in pwMS 
experiencing  painful  loss  of  one’s  sense  of  agency,  and 
loss  of  valued  roles.  If  painful.  If  others  (whether  fam-
ily  members,  friends  or  health  care  providers)  behave 
in  ways  that  are  perceived  as  rejecting  or  ignoring,  or 
if they “take over,” i.e., are over-protective or intrusive, 
there is increased emotional pain for the individual with 
MS.

The  literature  revealed  that  pwMS  can  feel  rejected, 
devalued,  and  infantilised,  and  individuals  sometimes 
manage  these  overwhelming  feelings  by  withdrawing 
from others, and become isolated. Beal and Stuifbergen 
(2007, p. 169) noted that “a sense of estrangement from 
others  often  accompanies  prolonged  illness.”  This  may 
be  related  to  a  pwMS’  sense  that  others  do  not  under-
stand  his  or  her  experience  of  illness.  With  reduced 
social  contact,  feelings  of  loneliness  and  hopeless-
ness  increase  and  the  wellbeing  of  pwMS  is  negatively 
affected.

Families are a potent force in pwMS’ adjustment to ill-
ness  (Power,  1985),  and  strong  social  support  networks 
are  widely  acknowledged  to  be  important  for  the  mental 
wellbeing of people living with MS (Patrick, Morgan, & 
Charlton, 1986); it is therefore vital that patterns in inter-
personal  relationships  be  considered.  This  review  high-
lighted  that  accepting  MS-related  changes  is  a  key  fac-
tor in exiting from unhelpful relationship patterns, and an 
important aspect of effective coping; however, due to the 
nature of their MS condition, pwMS emphasize that con-
stant  re-adjustment  and  re-acceptance  are  necessary.  It 
is unclear how much styles of family/couple functioning 
prior  to  MS  diagnosis  influence  interpersonal  responses 
to MS. It could be that some families have had an accept-
ing–supported  pattern  of  relating  to  one  another,  even 
prior  to  illness  onset.  It  is  also  possible  that,  at  a  cer-
tain point in the MS journey, for families that have good 
external support, this reciprocal role pattern may become 
the more dominant pattern.

Implications for Service Provision

While research has revealed that MS affects emotional well-
being (Honarmand & Feinstein, 2009) for a variety of rea-
sons, the role that relationships play cannot be overlooked. 
Just  as  the  physical  and  psychological  aspects  within  the 
individual  cannot  be  separated,  and  neither  can  individu-
als be divorced from the context of relationships in which 
she  or  he  lives.  These  factors  have  major  implications  for 
providing  services  for  pwMS.  MS  services  must  be  more 
holistic and integrate relatives into care. If MS service sys-
tems  consider  the  whole  family,  clinicians  will  know  how 
a family is functioning and be able to provide timely fam-
ily-based  interventions  when  there  are  difficulties  (Fisher 
& Weihs, 2000; Galushko et al., 2014). Rintell and Melito 
(2013)  suggest  that  as  part  of  standard  care,  pwMS  and 
their  families  should  be  offered  preventive  family  inter-
ventions  after  diagnosis.  Some  may  question  whether  ser-
vices should “interfere” with family life, but pwMS assign 
very  high  importance  to  meeting  psychosocial  needs  such 
as having good relationships with family (Koopman, Ben-
bow,  &  Vandervoort,  2006).  Moreover,  pwMS  have  indi-
cated  that  they  want  support  for  this  area  of  their  lives. 
Interventions are needed, therefore, that approach families 
as dynamic units, and that support couples and families to 
work  through  unhelpful  patterns,  to  re-find  mutuality,  and 
to  move  towards  relating  in  an  accepting–supported  way 
(Badr  &  Acitelli,  2005;  Uccelli,  2014).  That  said,  pwMS 
should  always  be  consulted  about  involvement  of  family 
members in their care, and conversations around such top-
ics must be handled sensitively.

Health  services  for  persons  with  chronic  illnesses  such 
as  MS  may  need  to  consider  routinely  employing  psycho-
logical  practitioners  to  provide  interventions  to  affected 
families,  couples,  and  individuals.  In  the  context  of  ever-
reducing budgets this may seem fanciful, but if we consider 
there is a 45% increase in healthcare costs when co-morbid 
mental health difficulties are present (Naylor et al., 2012), 
medical care cannot afford to be divorced from psychoso-
cial issues.

As living with MS is a continual process of adjustment 
and adaptation, families may need different types of support 
at different times. Considering the reciprocal roles revealed 
by our integrative review, we will highlight some examples. 
Caregivers may benefit from support and find a good bal-
ance between giving caring and self-care, which may help 
them  feel  that  MS  is  a  less  negative  and  intrusive  force 
in  their  lives,  and  thereby  reduces  strain  on  relationships. 
Efforts to support pwMS and family members to communi-
cate more effectively with one another and manage feelings 
will  be  beneficial.  MS  service  providers  must  make  sure 
that  “emotions  are  on  the  agenda,”  perhaps  using  yearly 
emotional  check-ups  (Blundell  Jones  et  al.,  2014)  as  part 

1 3338 

J Clin Psychol Med Settings (2017) 24:316–340

of annual medical reviews. Some families may need assis-
tance  to  minimise  unhelpful  overprotection,  while  pwMS 
may  need  support  to  assert  their  wishes  and  opinions 
regarding independence along with support for finding pat-
terns of successful daily activities that bolster self-esteem. 
A  delicate  balance  must  be  struck  between  independence 
and dependence, as well as a balance between acknowledg-
ing and ignoring of symptoms. Interventions that facilitate 
such balance and help people find their own solutions will 
positively influence wellbeing.

Limitations

By using CAT to interpret the results of this review, atten-
tion  has  been  given  to  ways  in  which  relationships  may 
need  remodelling.  In  this  way,  the  CAT  framework  has 
enabled  a  better  connection  between  the  literature  review 
and implications for providing clinical services. Neverthe-
less, our approach has limitations. A primary consideration 
is  whether  the  results  can  be  replicated;  whilst  familiarity 
with  CAT  would  be  required,  it  is  anticipated  that  similar 
overarching  themes  would  be  revealed.  Yet,  relationships 
are complex, and so there may be other pertinent issues or 
relational difficulties that have not yet been captured by the 
published literature. Although disease course has been rep-
resented in our review (i.e., the number of years living with 
MS is highly variable), there is a significant lack of longitu-
dinal studies on relationships and coping over time. There 
is  also  a  possibility  that  the  corpus  of  published  data  has 
been  influenced  by  researcher  selectivity  and  unintended 
bias.

In this review article, data pertaining to the experiences 
of multiple individuals was synthesised into a single SDR-
derived diagram that covers one illness, and as such speaks 
to  overall  themes  rather  than  the  intricacies  of  individual 
cases.  Shannon  and  Swarbrick  (2010)  consulted  service 
users to aid the development of a CAT framework for com-
mon  relational  patterns  in  Bipolar  Disorder;  similarly,  it 
will  be  useful  to  ascertain  how  those  with  MS  feel  about 
the  roles  we  have  highlighted  and  whether  or  not  those 
roles  automatically  apply  to  every  individual.  It  also  will 
be interesting to consider whether the relationship patterns 
we  have  highlighted  are  similar  or  different  to  those  for 
other  chronic  illnesses.  A  paper  documenting  experiences 
of  wives  of  chronically  ill  spouses  suggests  there  may  be 
overlap (Eriksson & Svedlund, 2006).

According  to  Murray  (1995),  MS  care  which  recog-
nises  both  neurological  and  psychosocial  issues  will  be 
most  effective.  A  condition  with  so  many  unpredictable 
and  progressive  physical  difficulties  means  psychosocial 
issues can easily be overlooked, and so MS care must strive 
to be holistic. Despite the aforementioned limitations, this 
review has illuminated potential relationship dynamics that 

may occur in MS and offers a viewpoint  from which spe-
cific support or interventions can be considered.

Conclusion

Due to the unpredictability and uncertainty of the MS dis-
ease course, along with the strain caused by symptoms, it is 
understandable  that  relationships  can  suffer.  Several  com-
mon patterns of relating were found that can either help or 
hinder  coping  and  adjustment  and  affect  wellbeing.  The 
relational  patterns  engaged  in  by  individuals,  loved  ones, 
friends,  and  society  in  relation  to  MS  are  important  to 
understand.  Such  understanding  improves  opportunities  to 
revise  unhelpful  relationship  patterns  and  ameliorate  their 
negative effects. CAT theory has provided a useful frame-
work  for  deepening  understanding  of  how  relationships 
are affected by chronic illness and has enabled links to be 
made more readily between a literature review and practice. 
The presentation of a CAT-informed diagrammatic formu-
lation  that  represents  how  patterns  interlink  has  allowed 
further consideration of patient-focused interventions. Psy-
chological  services  may  have  a  significant  role  to  play  in 
facilitating  understanding  and  supportive  relationships.  It 
will be valuable to ascertain the views of individuals living 
with  MS  regarding  the  reciprocal  roles  highlighted  in  this 
manuscript.
