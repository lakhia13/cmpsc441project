Abstract.  Head  and  neck  cancer  (HNc)  is  a  common 
malignant  disease  in  otorhinolaryngology;  however,  its 
pathogenesis remains to be fully elucidated. currently, the 
treatment  for  HNc  mainly  comprises  surgery  assisted  by 
other  methods,  including  radiotherapy,  chemotherapy  and 
immunotherapy. After surgical treatment, the laryngeal func‑
tion, and swallowing and breathing abilities of patients can be 
affected to a certain extent, and the loss of vocal ability can 
cause daily communication obstacles and affect the physical 
and mental health of patients. HNc recurrence makes retreat‑
ment  challenging.  Ferroptosis  is  a  type  of  iron‑dependent 
regulated cell death caused by plasma membrane rupture and 
lipid peroxidation, and its occurrence is related to HNc. The 
present review aimed to describe the organelles that influence 
ferroptosis, the factors that activate and inhibit ferroptosis, 
and the role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis, treatment and 
prognosis of HNc.

1. Introduction

Head and neck cancer (HNc) is the seventh most common 
type  of  cancer  worldwide,  and  head  and  neck  squamous 
cell  carcinoma  (HNScc)  occurs  mainly  on  the  mucosal 
surfaces of the oral cavity, sinus cavities, pharynx and larynx, 
accounting for >90% of HNc cases (1,2). Smoking, drinking 
and viral infection are the main risk factors for HNc (3). In 
recent years, the incidence of HNc has shown a downward 
trend due to the decline in tobacco use and improved treat‑
ment options (1,4). Early detection, screening, vaccination 
and follow‑up of HNc are essential factors affecting patient 
prognosis (5). currently, HNc treatment is comprehensive and 
is based on surgery. However, the treatment leads to various 
complaints/symptoms including swallowing and speech diffi‑
culties and loss of taste, which directly affect the quality of life 
of patients (6). compared with individuals with other localized 
diseases, patients with HNc have a poorer 5‑year survival 
rate and >50% of patients with HNC are first diagnosed with 
locally advanced disease (7). In total, <20% of patients experi‑
ence a long‑lasting response to targeted immunotherapies for 
HNc, even though these treatments have increased patient 
survival (4). Therefore, it remains essential to explore new and 
more effective treatment strategies for HNc.

Ferroptosis is an iron‑dependent non‑apoptotic form of 
regulated  cell  death  (Rcd)  driven  by  the  fatal  accumula‑
tion of excessive lipid peroxidation (LPO) and iron toxicity 
to  cell  membranes  (8‑11).  d ifferent  physiological  condi‑
tions and pathological stresses may trigger ferroptosis (12), 
and  it  is  considered  one  of  the  most  widespread  forms  of 
cd (13). There is a strong link between the occurrence and 
development of numerous diseases, including aging, neurode‑
generation, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer 
and ferroptosis (14). Ferroptosis is associated with multiple 
oncoproteins,  tumor  suppressors  and  oncogenic  signaling 
pathways, and multiple cancer‑related genes and signaling 
pathways are involved in ferroptosis  (13). different cancer 
types have varying sensitivities to ferroptosis (15). Inducing 
ferroptosis has the potential not only to inhibit cancer but also 
to promote its development (9). When ferroptosis‑promoting 
activity exceeds the capacity of the ferroptosis defense system, 
ferroptosis occurs in cancer cells, resulting in cancer suppres‑
sion. conversely, when the mechanism that inhibits ferroptosis 

2

exceeds the cellular activity that promotes ferroptosis, cancer 
cells  evade  ferroptosis,  thus  promoting  cancer  develop‑
ment and even metastasis (10). Therefore, exploring specific 
weaknesses in cancer cells that are susceptible to ferroptosis 
could contribute to more personalized targeted treatments for 
cancer (16), and the selective induction of ferroptosis could be 
a new strategy for cancer treatment (17). 

cystine‑glutamate  reverse  transporter  (system  Xc‑), 
composed of the transporter protein subunit solute carrier 
family 7 member 11 (SLc7A11) and the regulatory subunit 
solute carrier family 3 member 2 (SLc3A2), is an important 
target  for  regulating  ferroptosis,  and  its  activity  is  mainly 
determined  by  SLc7A11 (18).  SLc7A11  further  regulates 
the  synthesis  of  downstream  glutathione  (GSH),  which 
is  the  reducing  substrate  for  GSH  peroxidase  4  (GPX4) 
activity (19,20). GPX4, a selenium protein, is one of the impor‑
tant signaling molecules that inhibit ferroptosis (21,22). These 
ferroptosis regulators are involved in the invasion and migra‑
tion processes of HNScc cells, and their expression levels can 
serve as prognostic indicators for HNScc (23). For instance, 
ferroptosis can be inhibited by SLc7A11 and its expression 
level is positively correlated with the clinical stage of patients 
with HNScc (24). Glutamine blockade can increase the level 
of LPO and the Fe2+ concentration in cells and lead to the accu‑
mulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby promoting 
ferroptosis  in  HNScc  cells  (25,26).  High  expression  of 
GPX4 suppresses ROS and LPO levels, ultimately inhibiting 
the  sensitivity  of  HNScc  cells  to  ferroptosis. conversely, 
GPX4‑mediated  inhibition  of  ferroptosis  can  improve  the 
therapeutic efficacy for HNSCC (24,27). Increased expression 
of system Xc‑is associated with poor prognosis in HNScc. 
Knocking down system Xc‑induces ferroptosis in HNScc, 
while  IL‑6  reverses  ferroptosis  by  upregulating  system 
Xc‑through its involvement in LPO (28). Furthermore, ferrop‑
tosis can reverse drug resistance in HNScc cells or enhance 
their sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs (29). In addition to the 
aforementioned examples, there is a large number of reports 
related to ferroptosis and HNc. Therefore, further exploration 
of the role of ferroptosis in HNc may provide new insights for 
the diagnosis and treatment of HNc.

2. Ferroptosis

What is ferroptosis? Ferroptosis is defined as iron‑dependent 
Rcd  caused  by  unrestricted  LPO  and  plasma  membrane 
rupture (8). It was originally considered to be a metabolically 
regulated form of cd activated by small molecules (11,30). 
When  the  body's  defense  system  is  unable  to  detoxify 
ferroptosis‑promoting activity, the excessive accumulation 
of lipid peroxides on the cell membrane ultimately leads to 
cell membrane rupture and ferroptotic cd (9,30). Ferroptosis 
must fulfill the conditions of CD and LPO, and be rescued 
by ferroptosis inhibitors at the same time (21). Importantly, 
LPO without cd is different from ferroptosis, which requires 
careful distinction (21). The process of ferroptosis involves 
an increase in free radicals, fatty acids and enzymes associ‑
ated with LPO (31). Fe2+ reacts with lipid peroxides to form 
hydroxyl radicals, which further react with polyunsaturated 
fatty  acids  (PUFAs),  leading  to  the  accumulation  of  lipid 
peroxides (32). By LPO, hydroxyl radicals target and damage 

lipids in cell membranes (16). LPO leads to disruption of the 
integrity of cell membranes and makes them unstable (16). 
GSH  depletion,  reduced  cellular  uptake  of  cystine  and 
iron‑dependent LPO are the main features of ferroptosis (32), 
and  the  mechanism  of  its  occurrence  may  involve  mainly 
free radical chain reactions or enzymatic oxygenation (21). 
Free intracellular iron or iron‑containing enzymes react with 
oxygen  and  lipids  (generally  lipids  containing  PUFAs)  to 
promote the formation of membrane lipid peroxides, resulting 
in ferroptosis (33). 

Ferroptosis is dependent on intracellular iron and differs 
in nature from autophagy, pyroptosis and necroptosis (34,35). 
Ferroptosis does not involve cellular mechanisms that mediate 
apoptosis or necroptosis (30). Ferroptotic cells do not exhibit 
typical  apoptotic  features  such  as  chromatin  condensation 
or  the  formation  of  apoptotic  bodies,  but  usually  exhibit 
necrosis‑like morphological changes (11,22). Ferroptosis does 
not result in cytoplasmic or organelle swelling, or membrane 
rupture  (36). Morphologically, ferroptosis is characterized 
by  reduced  mitochondrial  volume,  broken  mitochondrial 
outer  membrane,  reduced  or  absent  mitochondrial  ridge, 
normal‑sized nucleus and no nuclear concentration (37). These 
abnormalities are caused by the loss of selective permeability 
of the plasma membrane due to the occurrence of membrane 
LPO and oxidative stress (12).

Organelles associated with ferroptosis. different organelles 
regulate different types of Rcd by sensing stress signals (38). 
Multiple  subcellular  organelles  are  involved  in  the  onset 
of  ferroptosis  and  generate  signals  associated  with  iron 
accumulation, lipid synthesis and LPO (38). Organelles such 
as  lysosomes,  the  Golgi  apparatus  and  mitochondria  are 
important sources of unstable iron (39). Mitochondrial ROS 
feed back to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), accelerating 
the unfolded protein response (40). Excessive accumulation 
of unfolded proteins leads to ER stress (ERS) (41). ERS acti‑
vates activating transcription factor 4, thereby upregulating 
the downstream core effector molecule glutathione‑specific 
γ‑glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (cHAc1) and enhancing its tran‑
scription. cHAc1 further degrades GSH, amplifying oxidative 
damage through a positive feedback mechanism (42). Excessive 
ERS makes ER difficult to restore its function, which leads 
to increased iron accumulation in cells, thereby affecting the 
oxidative stress state of cells and leading to ferroptosis (41). 
The ER is the initiating and most important site of LPO during 
ferroptosis (14,43). Inactivation of GPX4 and depletion of GSH 
can  trigger  LPO  of  the  ER  membrane.  Activation  of  LPO 
leads to the release of ca2+, which in turn causes mitochon‑
drial calcium overload, further amplifying oxidative stress, 
and ultimately inducing mitochondrial ROS production and 
subsequent ferroptosis (44). Following the commencement 
of  ferroptosis,  LPO  first  appears  in  the  membrane  of  the 
ER before it spreads to the membranes of other organelles 
and ultimately to the entire plasma membrane (39). The ER, 
which has a multifaceted role in the regulation of ferroptosis, 
can increase or decrease ferroptosis sensitivity through the 
PUFA  or  monounsaturated  fatty  acid  (MUFA)  pathways, 
respectively (33).

Mitochondria  are  metabolic  hubs  that  regulate  ferrop‑
tosis, and contain factors that both drive and defend against

ferroptosis  (45,46).  Mitochondrial  quantity  and  quality 
modulate the activity of ferroptosis inducers, and mitochon‑
dria regulate ferroptosis by influencing mitochondrial ROS, 
mitochondrial iron, mitochondrial dNA and the tricarboxylic 
acid cycle (38). Ferroptosis is induced by excessive ROS and 
Fe2+,  and  is  inhibited  by  intact  and  normal  mitochondrial 
function (47). Musashi‑2 deficiency can lead to intracellular 
redox imbalance, mitochondrial damage and Fe2+ accumula‑
tion,  thereby  inducing  ferroptosis (48).  When  ROS  causes 
the activation of heat shock protein 90α (Hsp90α), Hsp90α 
competitively binds to Kelch‑like EcH‑associated protein 1 
(Keap1), allowing nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 
(NRF2) to escape the binding of Keap1 and be released. NRF2 
is  then  transported  to  the  cell  nucleus  and  activates  the 
GPX4 pathway, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis (49,50). ROS 
interferes with cellular homeostasis and when iron homeo‑
stasis is disrupted, the expression of iron‑related proteins is 
altered (51,52). Mitochondria are also the site of synthesis 
of  metabolites  of  coenzyme  Q  (coQ  or coQ10),  which  are 
resistant to ferroptosis (33). In addition, mitochondria regulate 
ferroptosis  by  influencing  processes  including  amino  acid 
metabolism, lipid metabolism and energy metabolism (53). 

Mitochondria  differ  from  other  organelles  in  that  they 
possess  mitochondrial  dNA  (54).  Mitochondria  maintain 
cellular and organismal homeostasis by participating in ATP 
and ROS production, metabolic precursor synthesis, calcium 
regulation, immune signaling and apoptosis (54). However, 
mitochondria  are  highly  susceptible  to  dysfunction,  and 
oxidative stress is promoted by mitochondrial damage and 

dysfunction,  which  in  turn  contributes  to  ferroptosis (55). 
Ferroptosis occurs when there is an imbalance between lipid 
hydroperoxide  detoxification  and  accumulation,  and  envi‑
ronmental stresses may skew this imbalance in favor of lipid 
ROS accumulation (56). The accumulation of excess free iron 
within the mitochondrial membrane allows LPO of the mito‑
chondrial membrane, which also contributes to the occurrence 
of ferroptosis (Figs. 1 and 2) (57).

Mitochondria have complex functions. In addition to being 
important generators of ROS, mitochondria prevent ferrop‑
tosis by preserving oxidative defenses and the cellular redox 
equilibrium (58).  Mitochondrial  self‑regulation  (including 
mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial fusion and mitochondrial 
autophagy) affects ferroptosis, and metabolic imbalances in 
self‑regulation promote or inhibit ferroptosis (55). The mito‑
chondrial  pathway  influences  ferroptosis  in  multiple  ways 
and is linked to the treatment of ferroptosis‑related diseases. 
MitoTEMPO,  a  mitochondrial‑targeted  antioxidant,  can 
prevent mitochondrial LPO as well as maintain the integrity of 
mitochondria and epithelium (59). Mitoquinone acts as a ROS 
scavenger, maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, 
and the cell survival rate (60). Targeting the mitochondrial 
dynamic protein dynamin‑related protein 1 in combination 
with  ferroptosis  inducers  may  be  beneficial  for  the  treat‑
ment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (61). Therefore, more 
in‑depth studies on the role of mitochondria in ferroptosis are 
needed. It is esteemed that the mitochondrial pathway can be 
used to develop potential targets for innovative therapeutic 
interventions related to ferroptosis.

Lysosomes  promote  ferroptosis  mainly  through  the 
activation of autophagy, release of lysosomal cathepsin, and 
accumulation  of  lysosomal  iron  or  nitric  oxide  (38).  Fe2+ 
promotes LPO through the Fenton reaction, and the release of 
lysosomal iron may cause LPO to spread to other membrane 
systems (62). When cathepsin B is translocated from lysosomes 
to the nucleus, it can cleave dNA or histone H3, thereby poten‑
tially altering the expression of ferroptosis‑related genes (38). 
The Golgi apparatus influences the sorting and transport of 
cellular cargo during ferroptosis (38). Lipid peroxide genera‑
tion can be decreased by the Golgi‑associated small GTPase 
AdP  ribosylation  factor  1  (Fig. 1) (63).  The  sensitivity  to 
ferroptosis varies depending on the fatty acids contained in 
the lipid droplets (Lds) (33). The degradation and storage of 
LDs influence susceptibility to ferroptosis, with the number of 
Lds increasing in the early stages of ferroptosis but decreasing 
in the final stages (38). Peroxidase regulates ferroptosis by 
affecting lipid synthesis, redox homeostasis, as well as steroid 
and  peptide  hormone  biosynthesis  and  signaling  (38).  In 
addition, other organelles affect ferroptosis.

  The  development  or  function  of  different  organelles 
has different effects on the occurrence and development of 
ferroptosis. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the effects 

of  different  organelles  on  the  occurrence  of  physiological 
or pathological ferroptosis or the development of therapies 
related to ferroptosis.

Activation of ferroptosis.
PUFA‑containing phospholipid (PUFA‑PL) synthesis pathway. 
cellular membranes are composed of lipid bilayers, of which 
phospholipids are the fundamental building blocks (64). PUFAs 
integrate into the cell membrane and affect its fluidity and 
flexibility (16). The lipids that are most vulnerable to peroxida‑
tion during ferroptosis are PUFAs (65). The accumulation of 
PUFA oxides is a marker of ferroptosis (15). However, free 
PUFAs do not directly drive ferroptosis; they must be esteri‑
fied into membrane phosphatidylethanolamine or cholesteryl 
esters to become lethal upon peroxidation (16). The quantity 
and location of PUFAs in the phospholipid bilayer influence 
the cellular sensitivity to ferroptosis (36). PUFAs are activated 
by acyl coenzyme A synthetase long chain family member 4 
(AcSL4) (64). Among the AcSL family members, AcSL4 and 
AcSL3 have the strongest correlation with ferroptosis (21). 
AcSL4 is an important proferroptotic gene and the upregula‑
tion of AcSL4 is a marker of ferroptosis (15,66). AcSL4 is 
required for the execution of ferroptosis, and its expression 

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLEcULAR MEdIcINE  56:  184,  2025

5

determines  its  susceptibility  to  ferroptosis  by  shaping  the 
composition  of  cellular  lipids  (21,67).  AcSL4  links  free 
PUFAs with coenzyme A (coA) to produce PUFA‑coA (68). 
Lysophosphatidylcholine  acyltransferase  3  (LPcAT3) 
re‑esterifies PUFA‑CoA to phospholipids, which then generate 
PUFA‑PLs (69). PUFA‑PLs form phospholipid hydroperoxides 
(PUFA‑PL‑OOH) under the action of unstable iron and cata‑
lytic enzymes, ultimately leading to the accumulation of lipid 
peroxides and ferroptosis (Fig. 2) (32,64,70).

The PUFA‑PL synthesis pathway is also related to disease 
treatment. For example, AcSL4 promotes the sensitivity of 
human  pancreatic  cancer  cells  to  chemotherapy;  silencing 
AScL4 helps to weaken the invasive ability of breast cancer 
cells (71). In the Balb/c male mouse model of reproductive 
damage, di‑(2‑ethylhexyl) phthalate can alter the expression 
of AcSL4 in the testicular tissue of mice, further affecting the 
synthesis of PUFA‑PL and MUFA‑PL, potentially reshaping 
lipid  metabolism (72).  In  the  tamoxifen‑inducible  skeletal 
muscle‑specific LPCAT3 knockout mouse model, LPCAT3 
deficiency  prevented  the  accumulation  of  lipid  peroxides 
and 4‑hydroxynonenal (4HNE), while limiting the uptake of 
PUFAs into phospholipids limits the generation of lipid perox‑
ides (LOOH) (73). Therefore, establishing targeted treatment 
strategies based on the different target sites of the PUFA‑PL 
synthesis pathway may provide a new treatment option for 
related diseases. However, PUFA treatment alone is usually 
not sufficient to induce effective ferroptosis (68). This needs to 
be explored more thoroughly in future studies.

Iron  metabolism  pathway.  Iron  is  an  essential  chemical 
element involved in a variety of physiological and pathological 
processes in the body, and abnormalities in iron metabolism 
are involved in a wide range of diseases (74). Imbalances in 
iron metabolism (including absorption, utilization, storage and 
export) can lead to ferroptosis (11). Fe3+ binds to transferrin 
(TF), and subsequently binds to TF receptor protein 1 and 
forms a complex on the cell membrane, which then forms 
Fe2+ with the help of six transmembrane epithelial antigens 
of prostate 3 (69,75). Fe2+ is then delivered into the cytosolic 
labile iron pool (LIP) by transient receptor potential muco‑
lipin 1 or divalent metal transporter 1 (dMT1) (69). dMT1 is 
responsible for Fe2+ absorption in the intestine (74). The LIP is 
responsible for regulating cellular iron homeostasis (74). When 
the level of free iron in cells is high, LIP induces ferroptosis 
more frequently (65).

Ferric ion overload is the main cause of lipid ROS accumu‑
lation (76,77). ROS are generated mainly by excess Fe2+ through 
the Fenton reaction (78). Excess ROS produce oxidative stress 
when redox metabolism is disturbed (79). The redox state of 
the cell is altered by changes in the level of intracellular iron, 
which further affects LPO (74,80). LPO can be divided into 
two pathways: i) Nonenzymatic and ii) enzymatic LPO (78). 
Iron is usually involved in ferroptosis by initiating the nonen‑
zymatic Fenton reaction and acting as an important cofactor 
for arachidonate lipoxygenases (ALOX) and P450 oxidore‑
ductase (POR) (Fig. 2) (32). POR, a flavin protein, promotes 
ROS production and transfers electrons to cytochrome P450 
enzymes during LPO. POR also produces superoxide radicals 
that induce LPO and ferroptosis (70,78). Iron accumulation, 
and cytoplasmic and lipid ROS induction, are characteristics 

of ferroptosis (81). Notably, not all iron accumulation leads 
to ferroptosis and ferric ions are not the only conditions that 
induce ferroptosis (36,82). In addition to iron, metal ions such 
as zinc and copper can also induce ferroptosis under certain 
conditions (70). 

Iron metabolism is an important indicator for determining 
the occurrence of ferroptosis. Related inhibitors and inducers 
that regulate iron absorption and transport are not only common 
methods for studying ferroptosis, but also therapeutic strate‑
gies for certain ferroptosis‑related diseases (83). Ferroptosis 
inhibitors can regulate free iron levels, thereby protecting cells 
from the effects of ferroptosis (84). For instance, in the female 
Wistar rats spinal cord injury model, deferoxamine can chelate 
iron ions and inhibit the Fenton reaction, thereby inhibiting 
ferroptosis, which helps promote spinal cord injury repair (85). 
The  synthesis  of  polyamines  is  related  to  iron  overload  in 
ferroptosis. Polyamine supplements enhance the sensitivity of 
lung cancer cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy by inducing 
ferroptosis, which indicates that altering the response of cancer 
cells to ferroptosis may offer a new approach for cancer treat‑
ment (86). It is possible to overcome the resistance of sorafenib 
in  the  treatment  of  hepatocellular  carcinoma  by  altering 
the iron ions that affect the occurrence of ferroptosis in the 
in situ mouse model of liver cancer (87). The aforementioned 
examples fully demonstrate the feasibility of iron metabolism 
pathways in ferroptosis induction therapy strategies.

Inhibition  of  ferroptosis. Eliminating  lipid  peroxides  and 
maintaining cellular redox balance can antagonize ferrop‑
tosis (88). The inhibition of ferroptosis can be divided into two 
pathways: i) Inhibition of the activation system of ferroptosis 
and ii) enhancement of the inhibition system of ferroptosis. It 
is possible to influence or weaken the occurrence of ferrop‑
tosis  by  regulating  or  inhibiting  PUFA‑PL  synthesis,  iron 
metabolism and mitochondrial function. For instance, iron 
chelating  agents  such  as  deferoxamine  or  deferiprone  can 
prevent  the  transfer  of  electrons  from  intracellular  iron  to 
oxides, thereby inhibiting the activation of ferroptosis (89). 
Reducing the production of ROS and LPO by promoting the 
activity of the ferroptosis inhibition system may also inhibit 
the  occurrence  of  ferroptosis. common  ferroptosis  inhibi‑
tion systems include the GPX4‑GSH, ferroptosis suppressor 
protein  1  (FSP1)‑ubiquinone  (coQH2),  dihydroorotate 
dehydrogenase  (dHOdH)‑coQH2,  GTP  cyclohydrolase  1 
(GcH1)‑tetrahydrobiopterin  (BH4)  and  membrane‑bound 
O‑acyltransferase (MBOAT)‑1/2‑MUFA systems. The selec‑
tion criteria for these two approaches of inhibiting ferroptosis 
differ in terms of their focus on basic research and clinical 
application. In basic research, inhibitors are typically vali‑
dated through gene knockout or overexpression experiments 
to confirm their inhibitory phenotypes, and their target sites 
are identified in experiments (90,91). For example, lipocalin 2 
knockout reduces ferroptosis in lung cancer cachexia (92); high 
mobility group AT‑hook 2 overexpression inhibits ferroptosis 
in pancreatic cancer cells (93). In clinical applications, factors 
such as bioavailability, half‑life, side effects and ability to cross 
the blood‑brain barrier must be considered. These factors can 
ensure patient safety and reduce risks while providing treat‑
ment (94‑96). The screening of ferroptosis inhibitors for basic 
research and clinical application is detailed in Table I (97‑105).

GPX4‑GSH system. System Xc‑plays a role in transporting 
small molecular nutrients during ferroptosis (35,106). Since 
the light chain encoded by SLC7A11 is a specific subunit of 
system Xc‑, there is usually a positive correlation between its 
expression level and the activity of system Xc‑ (107). System 
Xc‑facilitates the exchange of cystine and glutamate across 
the plasma membrane, and when cystine enters the cell, it is 
reduced to cysteine (106). Ferroptosis is usually associated 
with the depletion of cysteine (108). cysteine is a key precursor 
of GSH synthesis and has an impact on GSH synthesis (70). 
GSH synthesis is slower during episodes of ferroptosis, and 
maintenance of GSH levels during this period is dependent on 
system Xc‑ (70).

GSH, a tripeptide composed of glycine, cysteine and gluta‑
mate, is the most abundant nonprotein thiol in mammalian 
cells (21). As a major endogenous antioxidant, GSH acts as an 
electron donor in the reduced state, and two molecules of GSH 
are oxidized and condensed to oxidize glutathione (21,22). 
GSH is a cofactor and preferred substrate for GPX4, an enzyme 
that converts toxic LOOH to benign lipid alcohols (21,33,109). 
GPX4 converts and reduces reactive PUFA‑PL‑OOH to nonre‑
active and nonlethal PUFA phosphatidyl alcohols (32), and 
GPX4 also converts phospholipid hydroperoxides (PLOOH) to 
the corresponding phospholipid alcohols, making it a key nega‑
tive regulator of ferroptosis (Fig. 3) (16). GPX4, at the center of 
ferroptosis control, is the only enzyme that is ubiquitous and 
capable of reducing LOOH (21). GPX4 functions as a PLOOH, 
and its expression or activity is influenced by GSH and sele‑
nium (16,22). GPX4 is universally expressed in vivo and its 
expression  is  directly  related  to  selenium  metabolism (21). 
Selenium, a key component of GPX4, is the most important 
trace element in ferroptosis inhibition (21). Selenocysteine is the 
active site of GPX4 and supplementation with the trace element 
selenium may help prevent tissue damage and disease associ‑
ated with ferroptosis (35). Several ALOX genes (particularly 
ALOX15) regulate GPX4 inhibition‑induced ferroptosis (78).

System Xc‑ and GPX4 are two targets of ferroptosis, and 
their inhibition effectively induces ferroptosis (35,110). Small 
molecule‑mediated  inhibition  of  cystine  input  by  system 
Xc‑leads to iron‑dependent LPO (107). Both components of 
the Xc‑inhibitory system can limit GSH synthesis, thereby 
inducing ferroptosis, which ultimately leads to reduced GSH 
synthesis  and  inactivation  of  GPX4 (34,35,68,106). direct 

inactivation of GPX4 drives ferroptosis independent of intra‑
cellular cysteine and GSH levels; thus, targeting GPX4 could 
be used to treat diseases associated with ferroptosis (35).

FSP1‑ CoQH2  system.  The  apoptosis‑inducing  factor 
mitochondria‑associated 2, also known as FSP1, acts as an 
antioxidant regulator during ferroptosis (22). It is a proapop‑
totic  gene  but  also  has  antiferroptotic  effects  (35).  The 
FSP1‑coQH2 system, which is independent of the GPX4‑GSH 
system, is considered the second ferroptosis inhibitory system 
that  effectively  prevents  LPO (111).  As  an  oxidoreductase 
localized in the plasma membrane, FSP1 converts coQ10 to 
its reduced form, coQH2, which prevents LPO and inhibits 
ferroptosis  in  the  cell  membrane  (Fig. 3) (32,101). coQH 2 
detoxifies  lipid  peroxyl  radicals  by  acting  as  a  lipophilic 
radical‑trapping  antioxidant (101). coQ  is  reduced  by  the 
oxidoreductase  FSP1,  which  is  dependent  on  both  FAd 
and  NAd(P)H  (33,112).  Lower  levels  of  coQ  impede  the 
re‑expression of FSP1, which may attenuate the inhibitory 
effect of FSP1 on ferroptosis (113). Vitamin K is a cofactor 
of FSP1 that prevents ferroptosis and works in the same way 
as coQ does (21). coQ and vitamin K have similar structures 
and functions, but coQ is more abundant in mammals than 
vitamin K is, and coQ is a major cofactor in FSP1‑mediated 
ferroptosis prevention (21). The inhibition of coQ10 can lead to 
mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and oxidative damage. 
conversely, supplementation with coQ10 effectively inhibits 
ferroptosis (96).

Τhe inhibition of FSP1 alone is generally not sufficient to 
induce ferroptosis due to the presence of GPX4 (21). However, 
the overexpression of FSP1 alone prevents ferroptosis (114). 
The antiferroptotic effect of FSP1 is associated mainly with 
cancer cells (21). FSP1 is expressed in various cancer types 
and prevents ferroptosis even in the absence of GPX4 (115). 
Inhibition of the FSP1‑coQ10‑NAd(P)H pathway may be a 
rational strategy for the treatment of tumors associated with 
ferroptosis (35). Previous research has shown that the expres‑
sion level of FSP1 is correlated with the prognosis and invasion 
of HNScc (23).

DHODH‑CoQH2  system. dHOdH  is  an  enzyme  involved 
in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines located on the outer 
surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane (101,116‑118).

Its activity is dependent on mitochondrial complex III func‑
tion  (117).  As  an  important  regulator  of  the  antioxidant 
response, dHOdH  clears  lipid  peroxides  from  cells (119). 
dHOdH  inhibits  ferroptosis  by  reducing  ubiquinone  to 
ubiquinol in the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 3) (118). 
Mishima et al (114) reported that dHOdH inhibitors increased 
sensitivity to ferroptosis via FSP1 inhibition. Mao et al  (101) 
reported that the inhibition of DHODH could significantly 
increase the coQ/coQH2 ratio, and that dHOdH inhibited 
ferroptosis by reducing coQ to coQH2 in mitochondria, and 
that the mode of action of dHOdH on the inhibition of LPO 
and ferroptosis may parallel that of mitochondrial GPX4 rather 
than cytoplasmic GPX4 or FSP1. The authors reported that 
dHOdH inhibitor treatment did not affect the expression of 
GPX4, AcSL4, SLc7A11 or GSH, and that dHOdH and FSP1 
may be two relatively independent systems involved in the 
inhibition of ferroptosis. Wu et al (120) reported that hypoxia 
significantly increased the expression level of the DHODH 
protein, and that knockdown of dHOdH under hypoxic condi‑
tions did not alter the level of LPO; furthermore, lipid peroxyl 
radicals significantly increased only when both DHODH and 
GPX4 were inhibited. These findings illustrate the balancing 
role of dHOdH and GPX4 expression in regulating ferroptosis 
homeostasis, and suggest that the involvement of dHOdH in 
pyrimidine synthesis may be more conducive to the mainte‑
nance of mitochondrial quantity and that dHOdH may play 
a  more  pronounced  role  than  GPX4  in  the  scavenging  of 
mitochondrial ROS.

GCH1‑BH4 system. GcH1, a rate‑limiting enzyme that cata‑
lyzes the synthesis of BH4, is a novel oncogene involved in 
inhibitory ferroptosis (121,122). BH4, a metabolic derivative 
of GcH1, selectively prevents phospholipid depletion of the 
two PUFA tails, further leading to lipid remodeling and inhibi‑
tion of ferroptosis (Fig. 3) (122). Two PUFA tail‑containing 
phospholipids are shielded from oxidative deterioration by 
BH4 (75).  BH4  contributes  to  the  maintenance  of  cellular 
redox homeostasis and antioxidant defenses, thereby inhibiting 
ferroptosis (70). BH4 also has the potential to protect cells 
from ferroptosis by increasing the levels of reductive coQ and 
directly reducing PUFA peroxidation (123). GcH1 not only 
prevents LPO via the BH4 pathway, but also leads to remod‑
eling of the lipid membrane environment, which increases 
the abundance of reduced coQ10 and depletes PUFA‑PLs that 
drive sensitivity to ferroptosis (14). Low expression of GcH1 
increases the susceptibility of cells to ferroptosis, whereas 
high expression of GcH1 increases their resistance (14). Thus, 
the GcH1‑BH4 system can be used as a prognostic indicator 
of  ferroptosis  sensitivity  (124).  Notably,  GcH1‑BH4  is  a 
regulator of ferroptosis inhibition independent of the GPX4 
system (124).

MBOAT1/2‑MUFA  system. There  appears  to  be  metabolic 
competition  between  MUFAs  and  PUFAs,  and  increased 
expression of MUFAs may affect the sensitivity of PUFAs 
to ferroptosis (125). Owing to their lack of bis‑allylic posi‑
tions, MUFAs have low oxidative activity, and can limit LPO

and ferroptosis (9,125). Stearoyl‑coA desaturase 1 (Scd1) 
is  an  enzyme  that  produces  MUFAs (126).  By  promoting 
the synthesis of Scd1‑mediated MUFAs, the mitochondrial 
transporter solute carrier family 25 member 22 contributes to 
the inhibition of ferroptosis (69,70,105). Saturated fatty acids 
(SFAs) are converted to MUFAs by Scd1 (105). Increased 
MUFA production and protection against ferroptosis are two 
benefits of SCD1 overexpression (9). SCD1 converts SFA to 
MUFA, which is further converted to MUFA‑coA with the 
help of AcSL3 (105,127).

Membrane‑bound  O‑acyltransferase  (MBOAT)  family 
genes are associated with lipid metabolism and are involved in 
lipid processing and modification within cell membranes (128). 
MBOAT1 and MBOAT2, which are transcriptionally induced 
by  estrogenic  and  androgenic  signaling,  respectively,  are 
ferroptosis repressors; they selectively transfer MUFAs to phos‑
pholipids to impede ferroptosis (129). MUFA‑PL is synthesized 
by MBOAT1 using oleoyl‑coA as a substrate (130). MBOAT2 
selectively  transfers  MUFAs  to  lysophosphatidylethanol‑
amine, inhibiting ferroptosis through phospholipid remodeling 
(Fig. 3) (105). Liang et al (105) reported that the inhibition 
of MBOAT1/2 promoted ferroptosis more effectively than the 
inhibition of Scd1 did. MBOAT1/2 prevents ferroptosis by 
reshaping phospholipids in a GPX4‑ and FSP1‑independent 
manner (105,131). There are >10 family members of MBOATs 
in humans (131), and their association with ferroptosis requires 
further research.

Regulatory network of ferroptosis. When the balance between 
the active and inhibitory systems of ferroptosis is disrupted, 
lipid peroxides accumulate on the cell membrane and even‑
tually lead to membrane rupture (32). The accumulation of 
lipid  peroxides  in  the  plasma  membrane  increases  plasma 
membrane tension, thereby activating mechanically sensitive 
cation channels. The opening of these channels leads to the 
influx of Ca2+ and Na+, and the efflux of K+. At the same time, 
the inactivation of the Na+/K+‑ATPase enhances the imbalance 
in ion flux. The loss of ion homeostasis and subsequent changes 
in transmembrane permeability result in cell rounding and 
plasma membrane rupture (132). during ferroptosis, nanoscale 
pores form in the cell membrane. The opening of these pores 
promotes the influx of ca2+ and water, leading to osmotic 
swelling and rupture of the plasma membrane. ca2+ influx 
can also activate the endosomal sorting complexes required 
for transport (EScRT)‑III complex, thereby further affecting 
the repair capacity of the plasma membrane (132). When the 
antioxidant system of GPX4 is damaged, PUFA‑PL oxida‑
tion leads to iron‑dependent accumulation of PLOOH, which 
disrupts the integrity of the lipid bilayer and, subsequently, the 
cell's defense ability against LPO weakens, resulting in uncon‑
trolled LPO. When the accumulation of lethal LPO exceeds 
the membrane's antioxidant defense and repair capabilities, 
related ion pumps or channels lose balance, disrupting ion 
homeostasis and ultimately leading to membrane rupture and 
ferroptosis (132,133).

Riegman et al (134) conducted experiments using HT1080, 
HeLa,  HAP1  chronic  myeloid  leukemia  and  McF7  breast 
cancer cells. The authors demonstrated that ferroptosis is a 
permeation process, and that ferroptotic cells become rounded 
and swollen before cell rupture, which may be caused by the 

opening of nanoscale pores in the plasma membrane. When the 
plasma membrane pores open, it allows the solute to exchange 
with  the  external  environment,  causing  the  cells  to  swell 
before death. This cellular swelling effect spreads between cell 
populations in a lipid peroxide‑ and iron‑dependent manner. 
Pedrera et al (135) validated the factors causing membrane 
rupture due to ferroptosis in cell models such as NIH‑3T3, 
HT‑1080, Mda‑157 and H441 cells. The authors demonstrated 
that the continuous increase of cytoplasmic ca2+ is one of the 
markers of ferroptosis before complete cell rupture. Following 
lipid oxidation, the increase of cytoplasmic ca2+ and plasma 
membrane decomposition, and the rise in cytoplasmic ca2+ 
also activates the EScRT‑III complex, which is involved in 
membrane repair. When the continuous increase in cytoplasmic 
ca2+ causes the cell to round up and the plasma membrane 
to completely collapse, the cell's repair mechanisms become 
overwhelmed, leading to membrane rupture.

In summary, there are various antioxidant systems within 
the body that work together to alleviate ferroptotic oxidative 
stress while preserving cellular homeostasis (39). Alterations 
in the internal environment are highly correlated with ferrop‑
tosis (70).  When  ferroptosis  occurs  in  a  single  cell,  it  can 
rapidly spread to neighboring cells (22). Ferroptosis spreads 
from one cell to another, but this process is not dependent on 
rupture of the plasma membrane. Instead, it may be dependent 
on the release of oxidized lipids from cells with intact plasma 
membranes, which can then cause ferroptosis in neighboring 
cells through cytosolic vesicles (14). The dynamic balance 
between the activation and inhibition systems of ferroptosis 
ensures the normal physiological function of the organism.

Oxidized  lipids,  ROS  and  LPO  are  the  basic  elements 
involved in the occurrence of ferroptosis (32). LPO affects 
mainly unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes, and its prod‑
ucts include LOOH, malondialdehyde and 4HNE, the levels 
of which are increased during ferroptosis (22). The metabolic 
pathways of different organelles in the cell (including mito‑
chondria, ER and peroxisomes) contribute to the regulation of 
ferroptosis sensitivity (33). Molecules that affect the composi‑
tion of intracellular lipids may also regulate ferroptosis (35). 
In conclusion, changes in important markers affecting the 
metabolic process of ferroptosis promote or inhibit the occur‑
rence of ferroptosis. 

Ferroptosis also involves epigenetic modifications such as 
histone modification, DNA methylation, non‑coding RNAs, 
chromatin remodeling and N6‑methyladenosine (m6A) (136). 
These modifications can dynamically regulate the expression 
and activity of key molecules involved in ferroptosis. m6A 
modification alters the mRNA stability of key genes such as 
SLc7A11, GPX4 and FSP1 through the coordinated action of 
methyltransferases, demethylases and related proteins (132). 
The key ferroptosis defense genes GPX4 and FSP1 can be 
silenced by dNA methylation, which may lead to changes in 
the expression levels of numerous genes regulating ferroptosis 
in  cancer  (136).  Ferroptosis  can  be  modified  by  histones 
through ubiquitination, acetylation and methylation. Histone 
modifications can regulate the expression of genes related 
to ferroptosis. Histone acetylation affects the transcriptional 
regulation of ferroptosis‑related genes and ferroptosis sensi‑
tivity. SLc7A11 can be epigenetically activated through the 
ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2B (132).

MicroRNA  (miRNA  or  miR)  regulates  ferroptosis  by 
inhibiting mRNA translation or promoting mRNA degrada‑
tion. miRNA can also influence iron metabolism processes to 
regulate ferroptosis. Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) typi‑
cally competes with miRNA for binding, thereby regulating 
the interaction between miRNA and its target mRNA, which in 
turn affects the expression of key genes involved in ferroptosis. 
LncRNA also interacts with proteins to regulate susceptibility 
to ferroptosis (132). Han et al (137)  demonstrated  that the 
lncRNA  LINc00239  can  interact  with  the  Kelch  domain 
(NRF2 binding site) of Keap1 to inhibit ferroptosis in colorectal 
cancer. Tao et al (138) demonstrated that the lncRNA zinc 
finger NFX1 type‑containing 1 antisense RNA 1 promotes 
ferroptosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma by regulating 
the miR‑185‑5p/SLc25A28 axis. Liu et al (139) demonstrated 
that  miR‑193a‑5p  can  target  GPX4,  and  that  inhibition  of 
miR‑193a‑5p or overexpression of GPX4 can reduce lipid ROS 
and Fe2+ levels in cervical cancer cells, thereby effectively 
inhibiting  ferroptosis. chen et al  (140)  demonstrated  that 
epigenetically upregulated NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 
family member 2 (NSUN2) binds to the mRNA of SLc7A11, 
catalyzes 5‑methylcytosine methylation and then recruits the 
specific recognition protein Y‑box‑binding protein 1 to form a 
stable protein‑RNA complex, thereby enhancing the stability of 
SLc7A11 mRNA and promoting the upregulation of SLc7A11 
expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. NSUN2 also 
makes  endometrial  cancer  cells  resistant  to  ferroptosis  by 
enhancing the stability of SLc7A11 mRNA. Hypoxia plays 
a  crucial  role  in  the  resistance  and  suppression  of  ferrop‑
tosis in cancer cells. Hypoxia inducible factor 1α activation 
upregulates SLc7A11 and GPX4, thereby enhancing cancer 
resistance to ferroptosis‑based therapies (141). These findings 
suggest that it is possible to regulate ferroptosis through arti‑
ficial intervention, which will help develop targeted therapies 
related to ferroptosis.

Current  detection  methods  for  ferroptosis. Both  cells  and 
mitochondria undergo morphological changes during ferrop‑
tosis, so it is possible to detect ferroptosis by observing these 
changes (142). Biomarkers of peroxides identified by liquid 
chromatography‑mass spectrometry are the preferred methods 
for detecting ferroptosis (129). Various small‑molecule fluores‑
cent probes are also widely used to detect indicators related to 
ferroptosis (129). The detection of the Fe2+ content and degree 
of LPO is an effective method for detecting ferroptosis (142). 
In addition, the expression of GSH, ROS, GPX4, AcSL4 and 
other related genes, mRNAs and proteins also contributes to 
the detection of ferroptosis (142). Ferroptosis and HNc‑related 
genes, such as ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) and Keap1, can not 
only detect the occurrence of ferroptosis in HNc, but also 
predict  the  prognosis  of  HNc (143).  However,  monitoring 
and identifying ferroptosis by detecting a single substance 
is not accurate (144). The specific markers associated with 
ferroptosis still need to be further explored.

3. Ferroptosis and HNC

Role of ferroptosis in carcinogenesis and treatment of HNC. 
Excessive cell proliferation or suppression of normal cd 
increases the incidence of cancer (15). Ferroptosis is involved 

in both health and cancer, and physiological ferroptosis may 
contribute to the elimination of deleterious cells to preserve 
tissue homeostasis and development, whereas pathological 
ferroptosis may be an important contributor to the develop‑
ment of cancer (38). Ferroptosis, a unique iron‑dependent 
form  of  Rcd,  has  dual  roles  in  cancer,  leading  to  either 
the  proliferation  or  elimination  of  cancer  cells  (145). 
Restricting the proferroptosis system, and stabilizing and 
overexpressing  the  antiferroptosis  system,  are  important 
mechanisms related to ferroptosis and cancer (9). The role 
of ferroptosis in carcinogenesis and cancer therapy is influ‑
enced  not  only  by  oncogenes  and  tumor  suppressors,  but 
also by the tumor microenvironment (TME) (22). The TME 
is a multifaceted ecosystem where tumor, immune, stromal 
and other cells coexist, and these cells interact to influence 
tumor  growth  and  progression  (10).  Various  cytokines 
secreted by different cells within the TME can promote or 
inhibit ferroptosis, and the sensitivity of the TME to these 
cytokines  also  differs (10).  Therefore,  ferroptosis  in  the 
TME has both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive 
regulatory effects on cancer cells (9). 

cancer cells undergoing ferroptosis release damage‑asso‑
ciated  molecular  patterns  (dAMPs)  (146).  The  role  of 
ferroptosis in cancer promotion or suppression depends on 
the release of dAMPs and the immune response triggered by 
ferroptosis in the TME (8). In certain cases, cancer cells stimu‑
lated by ferroptosis trigger dAMPs release, which enhances 
the procarcinogenic response of immunosuppressive cells (9). 
Impairment of ferroptosis in the TME can trigger immuno‑
suppression, which favors cancer cell proliferation (8). The 
development and function of immune cells may be hampered 
by dAMPs generated from ferroptotic cells during LPO, which 
results in plasma membrane rupture (39). dAMP release from 
ferroptosis may accelerate tumor growth by maintaining an 
inflammatory TME (22). However, ferroptosis also regulates 
the  release  of  dAMPs,  immunostimulatory  molecules  and 
cytokines by stimulating cancer cells, ultimately leading to 
enhanced anticancer immunity and cancer suppression (9). In 
conclusion, the effect of ferroptosis on the immunogenicity of 
cancer cells depends on the environment in which they are 
located (10). Thus, dAMP release is a double‑edged sword 
during ferroptosis, and rational induction would be useful for 
cancer prevention and treatment.

It  is  well  known  that  tobacco,  alcohol  and  HPV  are 
associated  with  the  occurrence  of  HNc.  cigarette  tar  can 
significantly reduce the expression of SLC7A11 and GPX4, 
thereby promoting ferroptosis. The mitochondria of tar‑treated 
macrophages exhibit specific ferroptosis morphological char‑
acteristics such as contraction, increased membrane density 
and reduction or disappearance of mitochondrial ridges (147). 
Alcohol consumption leads to the upregulation of transferrin 
receptor  expression,  and  also  reduces  the  expression  of 
hepcidin, ultimately resulting in iron homeostasis disorders. 
Frequent alcohol consumption causes mitochondrial damage 
and functional disorders, impacting their metabolic capacity 
and potentially preventing large‑scale ion transport. In this case, 
ferroptosis is activated due to iron overload disorder induced 
by frequent excessive alcohol consumption, generating a large 
quantity of iron‑dependent ROS (148). HPV can induce oxida‑
tive stress by promoting ROS production, further affecting the

occurrence of ferroptosis (Fig. 4) (149). HPV can also affect 
mitochondrial function, alter cystine and GSH metabolism, 
and make HNScc cells sensitive to ferroptosis (150).

Ferroptosis is also involved in the development process 
of  HNc.  The  inhibitory  effect  of  system  Xc‑can  induce 
ferroptosis in cisplatin‑resistant HNScc (143). AcSL4 not 
only promotes the malignant progression of nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma (NPc), but also induces ferroptosis in NPc cells 
to enhance radiosensitivity (151). High expression of GPX4 
mRNA and protein levels in HNc may be associated with its 
poor prognosis and radiation resistance (152). As a core regu‑
latory factor of ferroptosis, FTH1 is overexpressed in HNScc, 
which  is  associated  with  poor  prognosis  and  lymph  node 
metastasis of HNScc. Knocking down FTH1 can inhibit the 
metastasis of HNScc and the epithelial‑mesenchymal transi‑
tion (EMT) process (153). The ferroptosis‑related gene dNA 
damage‑inducible transcript 4 is overexpressed in HNScc, and 
it can reduce the level of ROS and thereby inhibit ferroptosis, 
which affects the proliferation, invasion, metastasis, EMT and 
metabolism of HNScc cells (Fig. 4) (154).

A deeper understanding of the ferroptosis mechanism in 
the development of HNc will facilitate the development of 
relevant biomarkers, construction of risk prediction models, 
screening  of  potential  therapeutic  targets,  improvement  of 
prognostic  assessment  methods,  management  of  high‑risk 
populations and advancement of precision medicine.

Ferroptosis  and  treatment  of  HNC.  Theoretically,  inhib‑
iting either pathway at the onset of ferroptosis could affect 

ferroptosis. However, multiple pathways influence the occur‑
rence of ferroptosis, and only by inhibiting the ‘culprits’ of 
pathological ferroptosis can the incidence of ferroptosis be 
effectively reduced. This is a key point for exploring thera‑
peutic targets related to ferroptosis. Ferroptosis occurs through 
multiple pathways, which also means that a variety of targeted 
drug therapies related to ferroptosis can be developed. The key 
points that hinder the activation or inhibition of ferroptosis 
may provide a theoretical basis for the study of targeted drugs 
related to HNc.

HNc is susceptible to ferroptosis induction, particularly 
in subpopulations that exhibit drug resistance, and inducing 
ferroptosis is a viable treatment for HNc (37,155). compared 
with normal cells, cancer cells are more dependent on iron 
and promote ferroptosis by increasing iron uptake, decreasing 
iron storage, limiting iron efflux and effectively killing cancer 
cells (24). These findings may contribute to the development of 
novel therapeutic options for HNc associated with ferroptosis. 
Iron metabolic pathways and ferritin phagocytosis are two key 
factors that regulate ferroptosis (15). Excess iron increases the 
risk of HNc, and promotes invasion and metastasis. Regulating 
iron  metabolism  can  increase  the  sensitivity  of  cancerous 
tissues (15,156); thus, interfering with iron absorption and 
metabolism may be a way to treat HNc. Lee et al (157) reported 
that the cytosolic iron chaperone poly(rc)‑binding protein 1 
(PcBP1) negatively regulates ferroptosis by inhibiting lipid 
synthesis and peroxidation, and that excessive iron accumula‑
tion leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in PcBP1‑inhibited 
cells. Knocking down PcBP1 may be a promising approach to

promote ferroptosis in HNc cells. Roh et al (158) demonstrated 
that, by inducing iron‑dependent, ROS‑accumulated ferrop‑
tosis, artesunate specifically kills HNC cells but not normal 
cells, and that inhibition of the NRF2‑antioxidant response 
element (ARE) pathway reverses resistance to ferroptosis in 
drug‑resistant HNc cells and enhances artesunate sensitivity. 
Shin et al (159) reported that activation of the NRF2‑ARE 
pathway contributes to the resistance of HNc cells to GPX4 
inhibition, and that inhibition of this pathway reverses the 
resistance of HNc to ferroptosis.

GPX4  constitutes  the  strongest  defense  against 
ferroptosis  (11).  c ystine  promotes  both  GSH  and  GPX4 
synthesis (160). The inhibition of glutamine hydrolysis blocks 
cystine deprivation‑induced ferroptosis in HNc cells (35). 
Shin  et  al  (161)  reported  that  cystine  deprivation  led  to 
increased cd and induced ferroptosis in HNc cell lines, and 
that silencing of the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase gene 
reduced LPO and Fe2+ accumulation, which in turn inhibited 
ferroptosis. Therefore, exploring treatment options for HNc 
associated with ferroptosis is also important.

Ferroptosis  sensitivity  and  HNC  microenvironment. 
Ferroptosis is associated with immune activity in the TME. In 
addition to affecting the number and function of immune cells 
themselves, ferroptosis can also influence macrophage polar‑
ization to regulate the immune microenvironment. In addition, 
dAMPs released by ferroptotic cells themselves, once recog‑
nized by immune cells, can trigger inflammatory responses in 
the TME (162). changes in the metabolism of HNc cells lead 
to elevated levels of PUFAs in the lipid membrane, thereby 
making HNc cells sensitive to LPO toxicity closely related to 
ferroptosis (46). downregulation of GPX4 expression renders 
cells more sensitive to ferroptosis (163). Epigenetic modifica‑
tions of ferroptosis‑related genes, such as dNA methylation 
and histone modifications, can also affect the susceptibility of 
HNc cells to ferroptosis (164). chung et al (162) demonstrated 
that inflammation and immune‑related features are closely 
related to ferroptosis in HNSCC. Their findings indicate that 
ferroptosis inducers modulate the TME to inhibit the growth 
of  HNScc  and  make  anti‑Pd‑L1  antibodies  sensitive  to 
the treatment of HNScc. Lee et al (165) demonstrated that 
E‑cadherin expression in HNc can regulate susceptibility to 
ferroptosis, and this regulatory effect is influenced by cell 
density. Additionally, miR‑200 family inhibitors, 5‑azacytidine 
and cadherin‑1 can also regulate the sensitivity of HNc cells 
to ferroptosis. cai et al (166) demonstrated that the combina‑
tion of triptolide and erastin can reduce the tumorigenicity of 
NPc and inhibit the expression of SLc7A11, increasing the 
sensitivity to ferroptosis. The aforementioned examples illus‑
trate that there are numerous factors influencing ferroptosis in 
the HNC microenvironment. Artificial intervention in these 
influencing factors can induce or inhibit the occurrence of 
ferroptosis, thereby further aiding in the treatment of HNc.

Immunotherapy associated with ferroptosis in HNC. When 
HNc  invasion  and  metastasis  occur,  drug  resistance  often 
occurs  (164).  Ferroptosis  is  associated  with  the  immuno‑
logically active state of HNScc (162). Immunotherapy has 
clear advantages in the anticancer process (167). Ferroptosis 
recruits and activates immune cells at the site of cancer, which 

contributes  to  anticancer  immunotherapy  (12).  Targeting 
ferroptosis‑associated metabolism in cancer may increase the 
effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy (168). Loss of immune 
function  and  promotion  of  leukocyte  subpopulation  death 
are two immunological characteristics of ferroptosis (144). 
The  proferroptotic  activity  of  the  immune  system  has  the 
potential  to  reduce  cancer  incidence  and  mortality  (169). 
Immunotherapy  resistance  may  be  overcome  by  inducing 
ferroptosis (170). Yuan et al (171) reported that Keap1 muta‑
tions are relatively common in HNScc, and that a mutation in 
or lack of Keap1 inhibits ferroptosis in HNScc by increasing 
NAd(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) levels through 
NRF2 activation. The authors also reported that NQO1 is a key 
target in mediating ferroptosis resistance in Keap1‑deficient 
tumors. Lee et al (165) reported that ferroptosis susceptibility 
in HNc cells can be epigenetically reprogrammed by EMT, 
which helps combat ferroptosis resistance.

Ferroptosis  induces  impaired  anticancer  immunity 
in  immune‑stimulating  cells  such  as  natural  killer  and  B 
cells (10). The number and function of immune cells can be 
affected by ferroptosis (162). Ferroptosis in cancer cells can 
be  triggered  by  T‑cell‑derived  signal  transduction  mole‑
cules (17). cd8+ T cells and neutrophils promote cancer cell 
ferroptosis by secreting interferon γ (IFN‑γ) and transferring 
myeloperoxidase‑containing particles, followed by the release 
of immunostimulatory signals from ferroptotic cancer cells, 
which promotes the maturation of dendritic cells (dcs), the 
activation of M1‑polarized macrophages, and the enhance‑
ment of intratumoral T‑cell infiltration and activity (10). IFN‑γ 
released  by cd8+  T  cells  downregulates  the  expression  of 
SLc3A2 and SLc7A11, and inhibits cystine uptake by cancer 
cells (Fig. 5) (168). The inhibition of ferroptosis in cd8+ T cells 
enhances their anticancer function in vivo  (172). However, 
IFN‑γ alone does not directly trigger ferroptosis (56).

The  survival  and  proliferation  of  cancer  cells  may 
be  related  to  the  transport  activity  of  system  Xc‑  (106). 
Intracellular GSH levels may be increased by upregulation of 
system Xc‑expression, leading to cisplatin resistance in HNc 
cells (164). cisplatin is a commonly used chemotherapeutic 
agent for the treatment of HNScc, but it has a high rate of 
resistance (24). cd8+ T cells can block system Xc‑via IFN‑γ, 
leading to a decrease in cystine and GSH, which contributes 
to an increase in the sensitivity of cancer cells to cisplatin 
chemotherapy (142). Lee et al (173) reported that inhibition of 
glutaredoxin 5 (GLRX5) promotes ferroptosis in HNc cells 
and enhances the sensitivity of HNc cells to sulfasalazine (an 
inhibitor of system Xc‑). Their study suggested that inhibition 
of GLRX5 overcomes chemotherapy resistance in HNc by 
promoting ferroptosis.

Immune cells in the TME can be affected by ferroptosis 
through the activation of dcs (174). The differentiation and 
maturation  of  dcs  can  be  affected  by  ferroptotic  cancer 
cells (175), which can release certain phospho‑LPO products 
that impede dc maturation, which in turn affects the ability 
of dcs to cross‑present antigens (10). The different effects of 
ferroptotic cancer cells and dcs are related to the stage of 
ferroptosis; for example, in the early stage of ferroptosis, cancer 
cells  trigger  the  maturation  of dcs.  However,  in  the  later 
stages of ferroptosis, their ability to promote dc maturation is 
diminished (10). In addition, ferroptosis is closely associated

with a wide range of immune cells, including macrophages, 
fibroblasts, and B, plasma and mast cells. Therefore, a compre‑
hensive exploration of its immune role in HNc could aid in the 
development of immunotherapies related to HNc. Ferroptosis 
involves a variety of immune cells in the pathogenesis of HNc, 
and their coexistence affects the proliferation and progression 
of HNc cells. The association between ferroptosis and immune 
cells in HNc is currently not well understood. Therefore, a 
deeper understanding of the function of ferroptosis in different 
immune cells is needed.

Ferroptosis combined with conventional therapies in HNC. 
Promoting ferroptosis may increase the fragility of ferroptosis, 
which is beneficial for targeted cancer treatment (11). Selective 
manipulation of ferroptosis to destroy mutated cancer cells is 
beneficial for cancer treatment (34). The treatment of cancer 
should not only consider the selective eradication of cancer 
cells but also minimizing damage to normal cells (9). Rcd is 
an ingenious way to specifically target cancer cells and enhance 
the efficacy of drug‑induced CD while simultaneously reducing 
adverse effects on normal cells (9). Inducing ferroptosis to 
target cancer sites can kill cancer cells while keeping normal 
cells intact (161,176). Inhibition of ferroptosis prevents cancer 
development, inhibits cancer progression and attenuates the 
side effects of conventional therapies for cancer (9). different 
forms of conventional cancer therapies can trigger ferroptosis. 
Therefore, the use of ferroptosis induced by these therapies 

could further increase the effectiveness of cancer treatment. 
This approach has been shown to have synergistic effects and 
be well tolerated in preclinical models (11). The combination 
of ferroptosis inducers and conventional therapies has great 
potential in cancer treatment (11). Targeting ferroptosis may 
provide new treatment options for tumors that are difficult to 
treat with conventional therapies (11). 

Radiation can trigger ferroptosis by stimulating LPO (177). 
Ferroptosis may also lead to normal tissue damage caused by 
radiation therapy (10). Ferroptosis inducers may also synergize 
with chemotherapeutic agents to inhibit cancer cell prolifera‑
tion in HNc (8). drugs that target ferroptosis can improve the 
efficacy of radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy for 
cancer treatment (8). Therefore, the combination of ferroptosis 
with conventional treatment has the potential to increase the 
efficacy of treatment for HNc while reducing the adverse 
effects of conventional therapies.

Role of ferroptosis in the prognosis of HNC. currently, despite 
notable advances in targeted drug therapy and tumor immu‑
notherapy for HNc, the prediction of HNc prognosis remains 
inadequate. Seeking new prognostic markers for HNc remains 
one of the research directions that need to be explored. Effective 
prognostic assessment can reduce the probability of recurrence, 
metastasis and deterioration of HNc. Individualized treatment 
plans and effective prognosis assessment tests are conducive to 
promoting the development of the field of precision oncology.

detecting  the  intermediate  metabolites  of  the  ferroptosis 
promotion or inhibition system after the treatment of HNc is 
helpful for evaluating the prognosis of HNc. chen et al (178) 
demonstrated that tribbles pseudokinase 3 (TRIB3) can reduce 
the levels of Fe2+ and cellular LPO, thereby inhibiting ferrop‑
tosis in HNScc cells. Targeting TRIB3 to increase ferroptosis 
in HNScc cells may effectively inhibit cancer progression, 
suggesting that TRIB3 is a potential prognostic marker and 
therapeutic target for HNScc. Jia et al (179) constructed a 
prognostic model for ferroptosis in HNSCC. Their findings 
indicate that heat shock protein family A member 5 is associ‑
ated with poor prognosis in patients with HNScc, and high 
levels of autophagy‑related gene 5 expression may be linked 
to low overall survival in patients with HNScc. High expres‑
sion of glucose‑6‑phosphate dehydrogenase in HNScc may 
be associated with lymph node metastasis and prognosis, and 
aurora kinase A may serve as a therapeutic target and prog‑
nostic marker related to ferroptosis in HNScc (Fig. 4). These 
findings suggest that ferroptosis plays an important role in the 
prognosis of HNScc.

4. Conclusions and outlook

Ferroptosis is a double‑edged sword. On the one hand, it 
can stop the spread of disease; on the other hand, uncon‑
trolled ferroptosis can lead to uncontrolled cellular damage 
as well as inadequate immune responses. Therefore, careful 
consideration  is  needed  to  determine  the  need  to  inhibit 
or  activate  ferroptosis.  careful  evaluation  of  treatment 
strategies is needed to determine the optimal duration of 
treatment, therapeutic dose and indications during the appli‑
cation of ferroptosis to HNc treatment. However, a series of 
issues, such as whether ferroptosis produces drug resistance 
and/or off‑target effects, and how to improve selectivity in 
the treatment of HNc, are worthy of careful consideration. 
Since ferroptosis plays a dual role in the occurrence and 
development of cancer, how to utilize its advantages and 
avoid its disadvantages is one of the key factors for exploring 
its  application  in  the  treatment  of  HNc.  Specifically,  a 
series of problems needs to be solved through continuous 
research. For example, it may be possible to develop specific 
ferroptosis inhibitors that can effectively treat HNc, and 
selectively  induce  ferroptosis  during  HNc  treatment. 
Whether  combining  ferroptosis‑related  HNc  treatments 
with  existing  HNc  treatments  may  produce  improved 
outcomes, as well as how the adverse effects of ferroptosis 
in the treatment of HNc can be avoided, are questions to be 
addressed by future research. It may be possible to develop 
predictive biomarkers to accurately predict the response of 
HNc to the induction of ferroptosis. 

To  address  current  challenges,  future  research  should 
prioritize  the  following  directions:  i)  drug  resistance  and 
off‑target effects: Systematic studies are needed to determine 
whether ferroptosis inducers or inhibitors induce resistance or 
off‑target effects. High‑throughput screening approaches may 
identify compensatory pathways, while nanoparticle‑mediated 
delivery may enhance selectivity; ii)  combination therapy: 
The synergistic effects of ferroptosis modulators with conven‑
tional  therapies  (such  as  radiotherapy,  chemotherapy  and 
immunotherapy) should be evaluated in preclinical models. 

For  example,  ferroptosis  inducers  may  overcome  cisplatin 
resistance by depleting GSH in HNc, but this effect needs to 
be validated in vivo; iii) predictive biomarker development: 
Lipidomics  and  transcriptomics  can  identify  biomarkers 
(such as AcSL4 expression levels and LPO levels). clinical 
validation  of  these  biomarkers  is  critical  for  translational 
applications; and iv) homeostasis restoration: Studying the 
interaction  between  ferroptosis  and  cellular  homeostasis 
(such as autophagy and ERS) may reveal new drug targets to 
mitigate adverse effects.

Future research priorities should include the following: 
i) Strengthening mechanistic studies to elucidate the regula‑
tory pathways of ferroptosis in HNc subtypes; ii) preclinical 
trials  combining  ferroptosis  modulators  with  standard 
treatments; and iii) standardized detection methods for quan‑
tifying ferroptosis in clinical samples. By addressing those 
points, ferroptosis modulation has the potential to develop 
into a precision medicine tool for HNc. However, a deeper 
understanding of the role of ferroptosis in HNc needs to be 
obtained in future studies. A comprehensive understanding 
of the role of ferroptosis in HNc induction and inhibition 
can help improve strategies for HNc treatment. With respect 
to the potential dual regulatory role of ferroptosis in HNc, 
future studies should aim to shed light on this emerging area. 
However, further research is still needed to answer remaining 
questions  related  to  ferroptosis.  For  example,  GPX4  is  a 
steward gene and its absence is irreversible. Therefore, anti‑
ferroptosis drugs can temporarily inhibit cd and ferroptosis 
may still occur once these drugs are discontinued (21). This is 
still a challenge that needs to be addressed. It may be possible 
to  improve  the  current  understanding  of  diseases  while 
using ferroptosis to control their progression. clarifying the 
association between cell homeostasis and ferroptosis may 
contribute to the development of drugs that inhibit cd or new 
ways of restoring cell homeostasis. clarifying the mechanism 
and application of ferroptosis allows us to utilize or engineer 
ferroptosis to selectively kill unwanted and abnormal cells 
to treat diseases, which is a promising option. The diseases 
and mechanisms associated with ferroptosis are still being 
explored, and more in‑depth studies may lead to a clearer 
understanding  of  the  association  between  ferroptosis  and 
HNc, and the development of highly effective therapeutic 
regimens related to ferroptosis.
