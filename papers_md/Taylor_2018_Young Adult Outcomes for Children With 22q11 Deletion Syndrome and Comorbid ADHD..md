Abstract

Background 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a common microdeletion syndrome associ-
ated with a variety of negative health, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral outcomes. 22q11DS is
comorbid with many psychiatric disorders including attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD). The current study aimed to investigate the cognitive, behavioral, and functional outcomes
that a childhood ADHD diagnosis predicts to in adulthood. Methods This longitudinal study fol-
lowed 52 individuals with 22q11DS over 9 years. Childhood ADHD was operationalized both cate-
gorically (Diagnostic and statistical manual - 4th edition (DSM-IV) ADHD diagnoses) and dimen-
sionally (inattentive and hyperactive–impulsive symptoms) and was tested as predictors of young
adult outcomes. Results As young adults, children with 22q11DS þ baseline ADHD had more
parent-reported executive dysfunction and lower levels of clinician-rated overall functioning than
those with 22q11DS yet without ADHD. Dimensional symptoms of ADHD in childhood did not predict
young adult outcomes. No self-report differences emerged between those with and without baseline
ADHD. The majority (82.4%) of individuals with 22q11DS þ baseline ADHD were never treated with
an ADHD medication. Conclusions A categorical diagnosis of ADHD in childhood predicted a
greater variety of worse outcomes than dimensional levels of ADHD symptoms. Despite the signiﬁ-
cant impact of comorbid ADHD in 22q11DS, evidence-based treatment rates were low.

Key words: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome; ADHD; developmental delay; longitudinal.

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), also known as
velo-cardio-facial syndrome,
is the most common
identified microdeletion syndrome and is caused by an
interstitial deletion from chromosome at the 22q11.2
band. In most cases, 22q11DS is caused by a deletion
of 3 million base pairs of DNA encompassing 40–50
genes. The majority (90%) of 22q11.2 deletions are de
novo (Shprintzen et al., 2005). 22q11DS is relatively
common, occurring in (cid:2)1:5,950 births (Botto et al.,
2003). Heart malformations and cleft palate are com-
mon characteristics of 22q11DS; yet, not all individu-
als demonstrate either
(Shprintzen, 2000). Many
individuals with 22q11DS have cognitive impair-
ments, with IQs generally 1–2 SDs below the mean for

age (Antshel et al., 2007). While a specific mechanism
has not been definitively identified, several of the
genes that are deleted on one copy of chromosome
22q11.2 are thought to contribute to cognitive impair-
ments observed in 22q11DS (Philip & Bassett, 2011).
In addition to cognitive impairments, 22q11DS is
associated with a variety of psychiatric comorbidities.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), ma-
jor depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, oppositional
defiant disorder, and autism spectrum disorder are all
comorbid with 22q11DS (Schneider et al., 2014).
Further, individuals with 22q11DS are at increased
risk for psychiatric comorbidities in adulthood, in par-
ticular schizophrenia (Schneider et al., 2014). These

is limited principally by the short follow-up period
(3 years).

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

Need for Current Study

ADHD is one of the most prevalent comorbid disorders
in individuals with 22q11DS (Schneider et al., 2014).
Approximately 4–12% of children without 22q11DS
are diagnosed with ADHD (Spencer, Biederman, &
Mick, 2007). The prevalence rate of ADHD in
22q11DS is roughly 5-fold higher (30–40%) than the
prevalence rate of ADHD in the general population
(Schneider et al., 2014). In non-22q11DS cross-sec-
tional samples, ADHD negatively affects academic, oc-
functioning (de
cupational,
Schipper et al., 2015). Longitudinally, children with
ADHD are at greater risk for difficulties in late adoles-
cence and early adulthood, including school failure,
emotional difficulties, dysfunctional relationships, legal
problems, substance abuse, and occupational difficul-
ties (Spencer et al., 2007). Thus, an ADHD diagnosis is
a concern both in childhood and young adulthood.

social, and emotional

In the only longitudinal study to date that has inves-
tigated ADHD in 22q11DS, Antshel and colleagues
(2013) followed children with 22q11DS both with
and without ADHD into adolescence. The develop-
mental trajectories of those with 22q11DS were com-
pared with control children with ADHD. Results
indicated that children with 22q11DS and ADHD
(22q11DS þ ADHD) experienced largely similar longi-
tudinal trajectories to control children with ADHD.

pharmacotherapy use in the 22q11DS population may
explain this finding (Tang et al., 2014).

pathic ADHD (Hurtig et al., 2007), major depression
predicted ADHD persistence in the 22q11DS popula-
tion (Antshel et al., 2013). Overall, this study pro-
vided evidence that childhood factors that predict
ADHD persistence in non-22q11DS populations pre-

The persistence of ADHD into adulthood has been em-
pirically supported, both dimensionally along a contin-
uum representing elevated symptoms and as a
categorical diagnosis (ADHD vs. non-ADHD) (Faraone
et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the developmental trajecto-
for children with ADHD are heterogeneous
ries
(Spencer et al., 2007). Efforts to understand develop-
mental trajectories are needed, especially in populations
of children with ADHD and an additional childhood
developmental disorder (like 22q11DS). ADHD is fre-
quently comorbid with other childhood developmental
disorders besides 22q11DS (Spencer et al., 2007).

syndrome

Investigating adult outcomes of childhood ADHD
in developmentally delayed populations is important
for several reasons. First, this information can be clini-
cally useful and provide guidance about longitudinal
outcomes for clinicians and parents. For example,
ADHD is comorbid with a variety of other genetic,
medical, and neurodevelopmental conditions, includ-
ing fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome, and
Klinefelter
(Lo-Castro, D’Agati, &
Curatolo, 2011). However, we know little about the
longitudinal course of ADHD in 22q11DS. Second,
lower intelligence predicts ADHD persistence and
impairments in adulthood (Faraone et al., 2015); yet,
most studies on ADHD exclude those with an IQ <80
(Mackenzie & Wonders, 2016). Thus, we do not
know the longitudinal outcomes of individuals with
ADHD who have IQs <80. Third, given that many
youth with developmental delays are inattentive and
restless (Lo-Castro et al. 2011), there is risk for both
overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of ADHD in these
children (Antshel, Phillips, Gordon, Barkley, &
Faraone, 2006). Following children with ADHD and
developmental delays longitudinally would ultimately
inform clinical practice by elucidating the extent to
which a childhood ADHD diagnosis is a meaningful
predictor of adult outcomes.

Antshel and colleagues’ (2013) examination of the
longitudinal course of ADHD in the 22q11DS popula-
tion suggests that childhood ADHD in 22q11DS is of
concern into adolescence, but the functional conse-
quences of childhood ADHD into young adulthood
are, as of yet, unknown. Rather than focus on ADHD
diagnostic continuity from childhood into adulthood,
this study investigated whether behavioral and func-
tional outcomes would worsen over time for children
with 22q11DS and ADHD. Based on the idiopathic

638

ADHD literature, we hypothesized that a childhood
ADHD diagnosis in 22q11DS (22q11DS þ baseline
ADHD) would predict to poorer behavioral and func-
tional outcomes in young adulthood compared with
those with 22q11DS, yet no ADHD (22q11DS only)
even after controlling for childhood levels of these var-
iables. Aim 1 tested this hypothesis by examining
whether a categorical diagnosis of childhood ADHD
predicted behavioral and functional outcomes
in
adulthood for children with 22q11DS. Given the con-
troversies about ADHD diagnoses in individuals with
developmental disorders (Antshel et al., 2006), Aim 2
tested this hypothesis by examining whether continu-
ous, dimensional measures of childhood ADHD symp-

comes in adulthood. Others (Neely, Green, Sciberras,

both categorical and dimensional approaches is partic-
ularly important for youth with neurodevelopmental
disorders.

Participants
This 9-year longitudinal study followed individuals
with 22q11DS every 3 years; thus, four time points
(baseline, Year 3, Year 6, and Year 9) were included
in the larger study. Children with 22q11DS were ini-
tially recruited from a large academic medical center
in the northeastern United States during the years
2002–2005. All families that met inclusion criteria
agreed to participate. Only those children with a fluo-
rescence in situ hybridization-confirmed deletion of
22q11.2 were included. Children with an identifiable
genetic disorder (other than 22q11DS) or children
with an identifiable neurological condition (e.g., trau-
matic brain injury, preterm birth) that is known to af-
fect cognitive or psychiatric function were excluded
from participation. For the current project, only par-
ticipants who had Time 4 (young adult) data and who
also had baseline data were included. Our total sample
consisted of 52 children with 22q11DS (28 males). At
baseline, the average age of individuals with 22q11DS
was 12.2 years (SD ¼ 2.3), and at Time 4, the average

Sample Representativeness
Given that we imposed strict participation criteria (re-
quiring both baseline and Time 4 data), not all partici-
pants in the larger study are included in our analyses.
Thus, we compared our study subsample with all indi-
viduals who participated at baseline: participants in
the current study did not differ on any relevant Time 1
sociodemographic measures, including participant age

F(1, 78) ¼ .003, p ¼ .963, gender X2
(1) ¼ .061,
p ¼ .831 or socioeconomic status F(1, 78) ¼ 2.01,
p ¼ .165. Likewise, participants in the current project
did not differ from those from the larger project on
any relevant social and cognitive measures, including
baseline adaptive functioning F(1, 78) ¼ .531, p ¼ .792
or IQ F(1, 78) ¼ .316, p ¼ .664. Thus, the current
study participants appear to be representative of the
larger project sample.

ADHD Status
At baseline (childhood), 23 of the 52 individuals with
22q11DS met formal Diagnostic and statistical man-
ual - 4th edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for
ADHD based on a structured psychiatric interview
with the participants’ parents. This prevalence rate
(44%) is similar to what others have reported in the lit-
erature (Schneider et al., 2014). Sex differences between
the two 22q11DS groups approached significance, X2
(1) ¼ 3.68, p ¼ .055 in that more males were diagnosed
with ADHD. Age differences existed between the two
22q11DS groups at both baseline, F(1, 51) ¼ 4.00,
p ¼ .050, and young adulthood, F(1, 51) ¼ 4.13,
p ¼ .047. At
participants with
22q11DS þ baseline ADHD were slightly younger than
those with 22q11DS only. Given the age differences be-
tween the two 22q11DS groups, analyses comparing
the two 22q11DS groups will control for the effects of
age. Please see Table I for descriptive data.

(BASC-PRS) (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 1992).

Our young adult outcome variables were chosen a
priori based on the idiopathic ADHD literature, which
emphasizes that children with ADHD often lose their
diagnosis in adulthood, yet remain symptomatic and
impaired (Faraone, Biederman, & Mick, 2005).

Parent Report Measures
Time 1 BASC-PRS
The BASC-PRS (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 1992) is a
measure of parent-reported behaviors of children and
adolescents rated on a four-point frequency scale from
“Never” to “Almost always.” Responses are orga-
nized into nine clinical scales (Aggression, Anxiety,
Attention Problems, Atypicality, Conduct Problems,
Depression, Hyperactivity,
and

Caregiver Rating Form is a 297-item questionnaire
rated on a three-point scale: 2 (usually), 1 (sometimes
or partially), 0 (never), for which parents were asked
to rate their adult child’s ability to independently per-
form behaviors

Clinician-Rated Measures
Time 4 Global Assessment of Functioning
The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) (APA,
2000) is a clinician-rated global measure of function-
ing ranging from 0 to 100. Clinicians use the GAF to
subjectively rate patients on their social, academic, oc-
cupational, and psychological functioning, with higher
scores representing better functioning.

Time 4 Premorbid Adjustment Scale, Total Score
The Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS)
(Cannon-
Spoor, Potkin, & Wyatt, 1982) is an interview-based,
clinician-rated instrument used to assess functioning.
The Total PAS score incorporates items pertaining to
sociability, withdrawal, peer relationships, education,
employment, establishment of independence, social–
personal adjustment, degree of interest in life, and
global assessment of highest
functioning
achieved thus far. These items contribute to the adult-
hood PAS Total score. Clinician ratings on PAS are
scored on a 0–6 Likert scale, with 0 indicating typical

adjustment and 6 indicating severe impairment. For
the current study, only the adulthood PAS Total score
was used.

Self-Report Measures
Time 4 BRIEF-A
The BRIEF-A self-report version (Roth et al., 2006)
was used to assess self-report of executive functioning
in his/her everyday environment. Please see above for
description of the BRIEF-A. The decision to adminis-
ter both parent and self-report versions of the BRIEF-
A is supported by the moderate association noted
between parent- and self-report of global executive
functioning (r ¼ .34) and the stronger associations in
the 22q11DS-only group (r ¼ .52) relative to the
22q11DS þ baseline ADHD group (r ¼ .16). For the
current study, only the BRIEF-A self-report GEC in-
dex was used.

Time 4 Adult Self-Report
The Adult Self-Report (ASR) (Achenbach & Rescorla,
2003) scale was used to assess the young adults with
22q11DSs’ opinions of their symptoms and function-
ing. The ASR consists of 123 statements that the adult
indicates whether the behavior is not true, somewhat
or sometimes true, or very or often true. These state-
ments then load onto eight scales. Raw scores are
transformed into T-scores for results interpretation.
For the current study, only the Internalizing and
Externalizing Composite T-scores were used.

Time 4 Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report
The Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report
(SAS-SR)
(Weissman, 1999) is a 54-item self-report scale that
measures adjustment in social role areas: work, social,
and leisure activities; relationships with extended fam-
ily; and role as a spouse or partner, parental role, and
role within the family unit. Mean scores are trans-
formed into T-scores, whereby higher scores indicate
more social impairment. For the current study, only
the SAS-SR Total was used.

Procedures
Informed consent and assent were attained from
parents and participants. At all
four periods, a
doctoral-level examiner administered all psychological
tests to participants in a quiet room. Parents com-
pleted all parent-report rating scales in a separate
room. The same measures were administered to all
participants and their parents.

Planned Analyses
To investigate Aim 1 (categorical childhood ADHD
diagnoses predict poorer young adult outcomes), and
reduce Type 1 error rates, two omnibus multivariate
analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) of young adult

variables were used with ADHD as the independent
variable. One MANCOVA used self-reports (SAS-SR,
BRIEF-A, ASR) of young adult outcomes as dependent
variables, and age as a covariate. A second
MANCOVA used parent/clinician reports (BRIEF-A,
VABS-II, PAS, GAF) of young adult outcomes as de-
pendent variables, and age and available baseline par-
ent/clinician reports as covariates. To investigate Aim
2 (dimensional ADHD symptoms predict to poorer
outcomes in adulthood), stepwise regression analyses
were computed entering baseline levels of the self and
parent/clinician-report outcome variables in Step 1. In
Step 2, parent report of child hyperactivity–impulsiv-
ity and inattention were entered simultaneously.

Statistical Power
Based on previous research on 22q11DS and ADHD
(Antshel et al., 2013), we predicted moderate effect
size differences for young adult outcomes between
individuals with 22q11DS with and without child-
hood ADHD (Aim 1). Assuming 80% power to detect
differences, two groups, two repetitions of the four re-
peated measures, a correlation across repeated meas-
ures of .3, and an alpha level of .05, a sample size of
46 was needed to attain adequate statistical power for
our self-report MANCOVA. For the parent/clinician-
report MANCOVA, a sample size of 59 was needed,
because of the two repetitions of the six repeated
measures. Thus, our Aim 1 self-report report analyses
are adequately powered, whereas our parent/clinician
analyses are slightly underpowered.

Based on the extant ADHD research, which indi-
cates childhood ADHD symptom severity levels are a
predictor of adult outcomes with large effect sizes
(Lara et al., 2009), we predicted a large effect size for
our Aim 2 analyses. Assuming 80% power to detect
differences, two predictors, and an alpha level of .05,
a sample size of 42 was needed to attain adequate sta-
tistical power. Thus, our Aim 2 analyses are ade-
quately powered.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to use a longi-
tudinal design to predict young adult outcomes in chil-
dren with 22q11DS þ baseline ADHD. Our childhood
ADHD prevalence rate (44%) is consistent with what
others have reported in 22q11DS (Schneider et al.,
2014).

tive
with
parents
22q11DS þ baseline ADHD reported that their young
adult child had more executive dysfunction than did
parents of young adults with 22q11DS only. Likewise,
clinicians rated young adults with 22q11DS þ baseline
ADHD as having lower levels of overall functioning in
young adulthood after controlling for baseline func-
tioning. In this way, differences between the two
22q11DS groups became more pronounced over time.
No group differences emerged on any self-report data.
When considering ADHD symptoms dimensionally,
after controlling for baseline levels of variables, parent
report of childhood ADHD symptoms did not predict
any clinician or parent report variables of adult func-
tioning. Similarly, parent report of childhood ADHD
symptoms did not predict young ASR.

Others (Neely et al., 2016) have suggested that us-
ing both categorical and dimensional approaches to
psychopathology is particularly important for youth

with neurodevelopmental disorders. For predicting to
young adult functional outcomes in 22q11DS, consid-
ering childhood ADHD as a categorical condition was
a better predictor of young adult outcomes than a di-
mensional perspective. This finding argues against the
inattention and hyper-
notion that symptoms of
activity–impulsivity are intrinsic to 22q11DS and
therefore not worthy of further assessment or treat-
ment. Our data suggest that such elevated symptoms,
although common in individuals with 22q11DS
(Ousley, Rockers, Dell, Coleman, & Cubells, 2007),
may reflect a diagnosis of ADHD. Moreover, impair-
ment secondary to ADHD symptoms is a criterion in
the Diagnostic and statistical manual - 5th edition
(DSM-5) (APA, 2013), and our data suggest that
assigning a childhood ADHD diagnosis is meaningful
and prognostic in youth with 22q11DS. If ADHD di-
agnoses were simply assigned to those with more se-
vere ADHD symptoms, results in the dimensional
analyses would have mirrored the categorical analyses.
In contrast, a childhood diagnosis of ADHD (and not
simply levels of ADHD symptoms in this population)
was predictive of outcomes in 22q11DS.

Our data are also consistent with longitudinal re-
search on idiopathic ADHD that suggests that childhood
ADHD is associated with young adult outcomes includ-
ing executive dysfunction (Biederman et al., 2007) and
lower
independence (Barkley,
Fischer, Smallish, & Fletcher, 2006). Thus, our results of
ADHD in the context of developmental delays mirror
the idiopathic ADHD research results (which often ex-
clude those with IQs < 80 from participation).

levels of

While two group differences emerged between the
two 22q11DS groups in young adulthood, multiple
young adult measures were not different between the
two groups. Likewise, no self-report differences on any
young adult variable emerged between the 22q11DS
groups. Although some young adult outcomes are nega-
tively affected by the presence of childhood ADHD,
multiple other outcomes are not impacted significantly
by ADHD. Rather, having developmental delays, as is
common in 22q11DS (Antshel et al., 2007), appears to
be more impactful toward predicting young adult out-
comes in some domains.

Parent and Young Adult Perceptions
Parent report and self-report of functioning were mod-
erately associated with each other, yet were more
strongly related in the 22q11DS-only group. Parents
report more concerns about functioning than young
adults with 22q11DS, both with and without ADHD.
While parent and child reports of child functioning of-
ten differ (Kolko & Kazdin, 1993), young adults with
22q11DS do not perceive themselves as experiencing
difficulties when compared with their same aged
peers. One possible explanation for this finding may

be related to cognitive immaturity (Milich, 1994).
Cognitive immaturity has been forwarded as a hypoth-
esis to explain the positive self-perceptions that exist
in ADHD (Owens, Goldfine, Evangelista, Hoza, &
Kaiser, 2007). Our 22q11DS sample, both with and
without ADHD, had mean IQs in the Borderline range
for age. Thus, it is possible that developmental delays
led to poor self-monitoring, which led to parents
reporting
self-report.

However, others (Swanson, Owens, & Hinshaw,
2012) have encouraged researchers not to assume that
parents are correct (and children are incorrect).

ADHD Treatment in 22q11DS
The majority of individuals with 22q11DS þ baseline
ADHD were never treated with an FDA-approved
ADHD medication. Our low ADHD treatment rates are
consistent with previous evidence that suggests low treat-
ment rates (between 60 and 80% are not treated) for
22q11DS and comorbid psychiatric disorders (not spe-
cific to ADHD) (Tang et al., 2014). In 22q11DS, parents
made decisions to not pursue an FDA-approved ADHD
medication for their child with ADHD. There are likely
a variety of reasons for these decisions. Future research,
using a qualitative design, should investigate the phar-
macotherapy decision-making processes for parents of
youth with 22q11DS þ baseline ADHD. In conjunction
with previous research that stimulant medication is safe
and effective for use in individuals with 22q11DS
(Gothelf et al., 2003), these results indicate that the low
rate of treatment in this population merits further con-
sideration. Comorbid ADHD affects clinician and
parent-report variables of adult functioning above and
beyond the effects of developmental delays inherent to
22q11DS, yet may still be undertreated.

Limitations

While many of our analyses would not have survived
a Bonferroni correction, our effect sizes are uniformly
large, and we used MANCOVA designs (reducing the
chance of type I error). Thus, we believe that these
results likely represent the most robust differences be-
tween 22q11DS groups. Other real differences (with
small to medium effect sizes) may exist, yet did not
reach the p < .05 criterion. The lack of an IQ-matched
control group is an additional limitation. Thus, the
these results to 22q11DS þ baseline
specificity of
ADHD is not presently known.

Future Directions and Conclusion

Comorbid childhood ADHD as a categorical diagnosis
is a significant predictor of parent report of executive
dysfunction and clinician ratings of functioning 9-
years later and predicted more young adult outcomes

dimensionally. This suggests that DSM-5 Criterion D
(impairment secondary to ADHD symptoms) is partic-
ularly important to consider in youth with developmen-
tal delays. Further research is needed to understand the
mechanisms that may be responsible for these concern-
ing long-term trajectories. Considering environmental
factors (e.g., family, peer group) and the interaction of
these factors with biological variables will likely prove
most informative. Despite several significant negative
with
long-term outcomes, most
22q11DS þ baseline ADHD were never treated with an
FDA-approved medication. Given the low rate of phar-
macological
for this population, despite
some evidence for the efficacy (Gothelf et al., 2003), fu-
ture research should consider how best to increase the
use of ADHD evidence-based interventions, both phar-
macological and nonpharmacological, in 22q11DS.

individuals

treatment

In the idiopathic ADHD literature, parental lack of
knowledge and misconceptions about ADHD and
poor symptom recognition are barriers to treatment
for children with ADHD (Bussing, Zima, Gary, &
Garvan, 2003). These barriers may also affect children
with 22q11DS þ baseline ADHD. For example, low
knowledge of ADHD and poor symptom recognition
may exist in 22q11DS via diagnostic overshadowing.
In diagnostic overshadowing, symptoms of one condi-
tion (ADHD) are ascribed to a secondary condition
(22q11DS) (Jopp & Keys, 2001). If a condition is not
believed to exist or be valid, that condition is less
likely to be treated (O’Brien, Kifuji, & Summergrad,
2006). Further, parents of individuals with 22q11DS
report concerns about cardiac effects and fear in-
creased risk of psychosis as a function of stimulant use
(Green et al., 2011), despite some evidence to suggest
that stimulant medication is safe and effective for use
in this population (Gothelf et al., 2003). Future re-
search should consider the barriers for ADHD treat-
ment in the 22q11DS population as well as how to
address these barriers.

In summary, ADHD predicts several poor outcomes
above and beyond the negative outcomes associated
with 22q11DS. To the extent that ADHD remains
undertreated and underresearched in 22q11DS, a sig-
nificant portion of individuals with 22q11DS may en-
dure several negative long-term outcomes that may be
potentially modifiable with treatment.
