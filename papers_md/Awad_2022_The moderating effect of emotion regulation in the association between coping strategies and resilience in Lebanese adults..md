Abstract 
Objectives:  To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Coping Strategies Inventory–Short Form and investigate 
the relationship between coping strategies and resilience, taking into consideration the moderating role of emotion 
regulation.

Methods:  This cross-sectional study was carried out between May and July 2022. A total of 387 participants was 
recruited through convenience sampling through several areas in Lebanon governorates. The data was collected 
through an online questionnaire containing the following sections: sociodemographic information about the partici-
pants, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and Coping Strategies Inven-
tory–Short Form.

Results:  The confirmatory factor analysis results confirmed the four-factor structure of the Coping Strategies Inven-
tory–Short Form, with no measurement invariance across gender. In individuals with high problem-focused engage-
ment and emotion-focused engagement, lower expressive suppression was significantly associated with more resil-
ience. In individuals with high problem-focused disengagement, having high expressive suppression was significantly 
associated with less resilience.

Conclusion:  The current study provides novel and distinct findings regarding the relationship between emotion 
regulation, coping strategies and resilience in all of their dimensions. Furthermore, the present results provide insight 
on how a population under extreme stress receives and reacts to its reality.

Background
Emotion  regulation  isn’t  just  the  ability  to  control  or 
change one’s emotions but the capacity to handle experi-
ences that may be stressful or arousing in a manner that 
is effective with a flexible range of adaptive emotions [1]. 
Two  strategies  related  to  emotion  regulation  have  been

identified:  reappraisal,  which  is  the  modification  of  an 
experience’s  meaning  in  order  to  change  the  emotional 
response  eventually  and  suppression,  which  consists  of 
inhibiting behavioral and emotional reactions to a certain 
experience  [2].  These  two  strategies  have  different  tim-
ings as reappraisal happens at the beginning of emotion 
generation while suppression happens after the emotions 
are generated [3].

Emotion  regulation  is  also  the  capacity  to  guide  emo-
tions in both negative experiences that trigger stress and 
anxiety  as  well  as  positive  experiences  that  produce  joy 
and  excitement  [4].  In  contrast,  coping  strategies  are

actions that are employed to manage and reduce negative 
emotions that arise from negative experiences [5]. Simi-
larly  to  emotion  regulation,  coping  strategies  also  have 
two  dimensions  that  can  be  differentiated:  engagement 
coping strategies meant to restrict the effects of a nega-
tive experience in order to protect psychological wellbe-
ing while disengagement coping strategies aim to avert a 
negative experience and decrease its negative effects [6]. 
It is important to note that engagement coping strategies 
are  more effective in promoting psychological wellbeing 
but disengagement coping strategies are associated with 
worse psychological wellbeing according to the literature 
[6]. In a previous study, a notable observation was made: 
the type of coping strategy employed varied according to 
the  problem  encountered  [7];  this  introduces  the  prob-
lem-focused coping strategy, which is investigated in this 
study. Problem-focused coping consists of making efforts 
and behaving in a way that stop or change negative situ-
ations  [8].  On  the  other  hand,  emotion-focused  coping 
targets  efforts  towards  stopping  or  changing  emotional 
responses to negative events [8].

Within  the  same  realm,  resilience  can  be  defined  as  a 
measure to deal with negative experiences such as stress 
and  anxiety,  and  therefore  can  be  considered  as  a  tactic 
to  cope  [9].  In  essence,  resilience  is  the  capacity  to  pro-
ceed  adaptively  despite  encountering  a  negative  experi-
ence [10]. Previous research has shown that resilience is 
relative, with some people having better abilities to deal 
with  adversity  and  subsequently  increasing  the  prob-
ability  of  surviving  effectively  and  thriving  in  life  [11]. 
In  this  context,  it  has  been  concluded  previously  that 
coping  strategies  significantly  promote  higher  resilience 
[12].  Inversely,  implicating  resilience-focused  programs 
increased  the  employment  of  effective  coping  strate-
gies [13]. Furthermore, emotion regulation in a way that 
cultivates  positive  emotions  increased  resilience  in  the 
future when encountering negative situations [14]. It has 
been  suggested  previously  that  the  association  between 
emotion  regulation  and  resilience  has  been  overlooked 
[15], suggesting that the relationship needs to be further 
explored.  More  specifically,  reappraisal  was  associated 
with  resilience  as  individuals  who  scored  high  on  reap-
praisal  were  more  likely  to  be  resilient  to  psychological 
stress  [16].  Furthermore,  positive  cognitive  reappraisal 
was  positively  correlated  with  resilience  [17].  As  for  the 
suppression dimension, it was negatively correlated with 
resilience [18].

Some  evidence  suggests  that  emotion  regulation 
and  coping  strategies  overlap  in  some  aspects  while 
still  remaining  independent  [19].  Another  study  found 
that  problems  in  emotion  regulation  were  a  predictor 
of  all  dimensions  of  coping  strategies  including  prob-
lem-focused  and  emotion-focused  engagement  and 

disengagement  [20],  indicating  that  failure  to  engage 
in  emotion  regulation  might  have  been  associated  with 
employment  of  coping  strategies.  Findings  suggest  that 
achieving progress on both emotion regulation and cop-
ing  strategies  is  essential  for  avoiding  or  reducing  the 
negative  effects  of  stressful  situations  [21],  further  con-
firming  the  benefits  of  emotion  regulation  for  psycho-
logical  wellbeing.  Within  the  same  context,  emotion 
regulation moderated the relationship between stress and 
wellbeing [22]. Emotion regulation also played a moder-
ating  role  between  maladaptive  psychological  variables, 
anxiety  and  insomnia  [23].  These  results  suggest  that 
emotion  regulation  could  potentially  be  a  moderator 
between various psychological variables.

Emotion regulation, coping strategies and resilience are 
tactics used to deal with experiences of all kinds. When 
evaluating the situation of the Lebanese people, it is more 
than  obvious  that  the  experience  faced  by  the  collective 
is extremely negative. On top of that, this small country 
has  been  recently  paralyzed  by  many  tragedies  includ-
ing the COVID-19, and the fourth of August Beirut port 
explosion, the world’s most powerful non-nuclear explo-
sion  [24].  In  a  study  done  on  988  Lebanese  citizens, 
findings  showed  that  63%  of  Lebanese  young  adults  are 
highly dissatisfied with their country, which cripples their 
flourishing  in  life  [25],  as  opposed  to  individuals  living 
in  European  or  Northern  American  regions  where  life 
is  possibly  less  challenging.  Furthermore,  Lebanon  has 
been going through the worse economic crisis in its mod-
ern  history  with  the  rapid  deterioration  of  the  national 
currency,  one  of  the  highest  inflation  rates  in  the  world 
and the lack of resources such as electricity and fuel. Not 
only  does  it  make  the  topic  of  this  study  interesting  but 
could  provide  insight  on  how  the  Lebanese  people  are 
still able to move forward with their lives in an adaptive 
way  that  maintains  relative  psychological  wellbeing.  For 
that  reason,  the  aim  of  the  current  study  was  to  evalu-
ate the psychometric properties of the Coping Strategies 
Inventory – Short Form and investigate the relationship 
between coping strategies and resilience, taking into con-
sideration the moderating role of emotion regulation.

Methods
Study design

This  cross-sectional  study  was  carried  out  between 
May and July 2022, enrolling a total of 387 persons. The 
research team initiated the contact with friends and fam-
ily members they know; those people were asked to for-
ward  the  link  to  their  friends  and  family  members.  The 
link  was  shared  among  participants  and  sent  to  all  dis-
tricts/governorates of Lebanon (Beirut, Mount Lebanon, 
North  Lebanon,  South  Lebanon,  and  Bekaa)  through

social networks, using the snowball technique. Excluded 
were  those  who  refused  to  fill  out  the  questionnaire. 
There were no fees for participating in the study.

Minimal sample size calculation

According  to  the  G-power  software  [26],  a  minimum  of 
316 students was deemed necessary to have enough sta-
tistical  power,  based  on  a  5%  risk  of  error,  80%  power, 
 f2 = 2.5% and 10 factors to be entered in the multivariable 
analysis.

Questionnaire

The  questionnaire  used  was  anonymous  and  in  Arabic, 
the  native  language  in  Lebanon;  it  required  approxi-
mately 10 to 15 min to complete. The questionnaire con-
sisted  of  three  parts.  The  first  part  of  the  questionnaire 
included  an  explanation  of  the  study  topic  and  objec-
tive,  a  statement  ensuring  the  anonymity  of  respond-
ents.  The  participant  had  to  select  the  option  stating  I 
consent  to  participate  in  this  study  to  be  directed  to  the 
questionnaire.

The second part of the questionnaire contained sociode-
mographic  information  about  the  participants  (age,  gen-
der,  region  of  living,  marital  status  and  education  level). 
The  Household  Crowding  Index  (HCI),  reflecting  the 
socioeconomic status of the family [27], is the ratio of the 
number  of  persons  living  in  the  house  over  the  number 
of rooms in it (excluding the kitchen and the bathrooms).
The third part included the scales used in this study:

Connor‑Davidson resilience scale (CD‑RISC)

The  CD-RISC,  validated  in  Lebanon  [28],  comprises  10 
items [9, 10], each of which are scored on a 5-point scale 
ranging  from  0  (not  true  at  all)  to  4  (true  nearly  all  of 
the time). Examples of items include, “I am able to adapt 
when  changes  occur”  and  “I  am  not  easily  discouraged 
by  failure.”  Higher  scores  on  the  CD-RISC-10  indicate 
higher  levels  of  resilience.  In  this  study,  the  Cronbach’s 
alpha value was 0.88.

Emotion regulation questionnaire

Validated in Lebanon [29], it is composed of 10 items that 
measure whether a respondent uses cognitive reappraisal 
or  expressive  suppression  to  regulate  their  emotions. 
Answers  options  varied  between  1  (strongly  disagree) 
and 7 (strongly agree). Higher scores reflect a larger use 
of  the  concerned  emotion  regulation  strategy  [30].  In 
this study, the Cronbach’s alpha values were 0.91 for the 
cognitive reappraisal subscale and 0.84 for the expressive 
suppression subscale.

Coping strategies inventory–short form (CSI‑SF)

The  16-item  CSI-SF  evaluates  four  coping  strategies 
defined  by  two  binary  dimensions:  problem-focused  vs. 
emotion-focused  and  engagement  vs.  disengagement 
[31].  These  strategies  are  combined  into  four  subscales: 
problem-focused  engagement;  problem-focused  disen-
gagement;  emotion-focused  engagement;  and  emotion-
focused disengagement. Answers options varied between 
1 = “Never”, 2 = “Seldom”, 3 = “Sometimes”, 4 = “Often” 
and  5  =  “Almost  Always”.  Higher  scores  reflect  a  larger 
use  of  the  concerned  coping  strategy.  In  this  study, 
the  Cronbach’s  alpha  values  were  as  follows:  problem-
focused  engagement  (0.83),  problem-focused  disengage-
ment  (0.78),  emotion-focused  engagement  (0.73)  and 
emotion-focused disengagement (0.75).

Translation procedure

The  forward  and  backward  translation  method  was 
applied to the CSI-SF. The English version was translated 
to  Arabic  by  a  Lebanese  translator  who  was  completely 
unrelated to the study. Afterwards, a Lebanese psycholo-
gist with a full working proficiency in English, translated 
the  Arabic  version  back  to  English.  The  initial  English 
version and the second English version were compared to 
detect and later eliminate any inconsistencies.

Statistical analysis

We had no missing data since all questions were required. 
A  confirmatory  factor  analysis  (CFA)  was  administered 
based on maximum likelihood estimation in SPSS AMOS 
v.24. For this purpose, the normed model chi-square (χ²/
df ), the Steiger-Lind root mean square error of approxi-
mation  (RMSEA),  the  Tucker-Lewis  Index  (TLI)  and 
the comparative fit index (CFI). Values ≤ 3 for χ²/df, and 
≤ 0.06  for  RMSEA,  and  0.90  for  CFI  and  TLI  indicate 
good fit of the model to the data [32, 33].

To  examine  gender  invariance  of  coping  strategies 
scores,  we  conducted  multi-group  CFA  [34]  using  the 
total  sample.  Measurement  invariance  was  assessed 
at  the  configural,  metric,  and  scalar  levels  [35].  Con-
figural  invariance  implies  that  the  latent  coping  strate-
gies  variable(s)  and  the  pattern  of  loadings  of  the  latent 
variable(s)  on  indicators  are  similar  across  gender  (i.e., 
the unconstrained latent model should fit the data well in 
both  groups).  Metric  invariance  implies  that  the  magni-
tude of the loadings is similar across gender; this is tested 
by comparing two nested models consisting of a baseline 
model and an invariance model. Lastly, scalar invariance 
implies  that  both  the  item  loadings  and  item  intercepts 
are  similar  across  gender  and  is  examined  using  the 
same  nested-model  comparison  strategy  as  with  met-
ric  invariance  [34].  Following  the  recommendations  of 

 Awad et al. BMC Psychology          (2022) 10:296 

Page 4 of 10

Cheung  and  Rensvold  [36]  and  Chen  [34],  we  accepted 
ΔCFI ≤ 0.010  and  ΔRMSEA ≤ 0.015  or  ΔSRMR ≤ 0.010 
(0.030 for factorial invariance) as evidence of invariance 
[37].

The SPSS software v.25 was used for the statistical anal-
ysis. Cronbach’s alpha values were calculated for all scales 
and  subscales.  The  resilience  score  was  considered  nor-
mally  distributed  since  the  skewness  (= 0.096)  and  kur-
tosis  (=-0.252)  values  varied  between  − 1  and  + 1  [38]. 
The  Student  t  was  used  to  compare  two  means  and  the 
Pearson test was used to correlate two continuous varia-
bles. The moderation analysis was conducted using PRO-
CESS MACRO v3.4, model 1 taking each coping strategy 
score  as  an  independent  variable,  cognitive  reappraisal/
expressive  suppression  as  moderators  and  resilience  as 
the dependent variable. Results adjusted over age, gender, 
marital  status,  education  level  and  household  crowding 
index. p < .05 was deemed statistically significant.

Results
Sociodemographic and other characteristics of the sample

Three  hundred  eighty-seven  participants  participated 
in this study, with a mean age of 26.17 ± 11.47 years and 
58.4% females. Other descriptive statistics of the sample 
can be found in Table 1.

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the coping strategies 
scale

The  CFA  indicated  that  fit  of  the  four-factor  model 
of  the  coping  strategies  scale  was  acceptable:  χ2/
df = 332.07/98 = 3.39,  RMSEA = 0.079  (90%  CI  0.069, 
0.088),  SRMR = 0.063,  CFI = 0.902,  TLI = 0.880.  The 
standardized factor loading are summarized in Table 2.

Gender invariance

As  reported  in  Table  3,  all  indices  suggested  that  con-
figural,  metric,  and  scalar  invariance  was  supported 
across gender.

Bivariate analysis of factors associated with resilience

The  results  of  the  bivariate  analysis  of  factors  associ-
ated with resilience are summarized in Tables 4 and 5. 
The results showed that higher problem- and emotion-
focused  engagement  and  cognitive  reappraisal  were 
significantly  associated  with  more  resilience,  whereas 
higher  problem-  and  emotion-focused  disengagement, 
and  expressive  suppression  were  significantly  associ-
ated with less resilience.

The details of the moderation analysis of cognitive reap-
praisal/expressive  suppression  taken  as  moderators  in 
the  associations  between  coping  strategies  and  resil-
ience,  are  summarized  in  Table  6.  In  persons  with  high 
problem-focused  engagement  (Fig.  1),  lower  expres-
sive  suppression  was  significantly  associated  with  more 
low  (Beta = 0.24,  t = 2.007,  p = 0.045), 
resilience  at 
moderate  (Beta = 0.45,  t = 4.540,  p < 0.001)  and  high 
(Beta = 0.65,  t = 4.589,  p < 0.001)  expressive  suppression 
levels.  Moreover,  in  persons  with  high  problem-focused 
disengagement,  having  high  expressive  suppression 
was  significantly  associated  with  less  resilience  (Fig.  2) 
at 
t = 3.788;  p < .0.01),  moder-
ate  (Beta = − 0.72,  t  =  −  6.80,        p  < .0.001)  and  high 

(Beta = − 0.54, 

low 

(Beta = − 0.91; t = − 6.477, p < 0.001) levels of expressive 
suppression levels. In persons with high emotion-focused 
engagement  (Fig.  3),  lower  expressive  suppression  was 
significantly associated with more resilience at moderate 
(Beta = 0.29,  t = 2.715,  p = 0.007)  and  high  (Beta = 0.49, 
t = 3.025,  p = 0.003)  levels  of  expressive  suppression 
levels.

Discussion
Role of emotion regulation in general

It  has  been  previously  established  that  cultural  particu-
larity  plays  a  monumental  role  in  the  emotional  regula-
tion  strategies  that  are  adopted  by  individuals  [39].  A 
previous  study  assessing  emotion  regulation  between 
two different countries found that the Lebanese sample’s 
emotion  regulation  tendencies  reflected  collectivistic 
values  and  approaches  emphasizing  social  interaction 
[39].  In  comparison,  the  other  sample  from  the  United 
Kingdom  showed  less  emotion  focus,  such  as  emotion-
focused  engagement,  which  was  perceived  as  typical  for 
societies where individualism is prevalent and social rela-
tionships are less common than in Lebanon [39]. Overall, 
differences in emotion regulation are present even among 
countries  from  the  same  region  such  as  Northern,  East-
ern and Southern Europe [40]. Such emotion regulation 
variations can even be found between Western Asian and 
Eastern  Asian  countries  [41].  This  further  confirms  that 
emotion regulation varies cross-culturally.

Moderating effect of emotion regulation 
between problem‑ and emotion‑focused engagement 
and resilience

In individuals with high problem-focused engagement 
and  emotion-focused  engagement,  lower  expressive 
suppression  was  significantly  associated  with  more 
resilience.  Problem-focused  engagement  refers  to  tak-
ing action to resolve a problem [42] and minimize the 
psychological  repercussions  of  a  negative  experience. 
Meanwhile,  emotion-focused  engagement  consists  of 
efforts  to  alter  emotional  responses  towards  certain 
events with the aim of minimizing the negative effects 
caused  by  it.  A  previous  study  found  that  focus  on 
both problem-focused regulation and emotion-focused 
regulation  produces  optimal  results  when  it  comes

to  emotion  regulation  interventions  [43].  Research 
has  shown  that  active  strategies  such  as  engagement 
emotion  regulation  are  more  likely  to  produce  posi-
tive psychological outcomes and less likely to produce 
negative  psychological  outcomes  [42].  Furthermore, 
higher suppression was connected with less responsive 
behavior [44], which is in accordance with the current 
results where lower suppression is connected to higher 
engagement.  Therefore,  it  can  be  inferred  that  proac-
tive  behavior  such  as  problem-focused  engagement, 
emotion-focused  engagement  and  less  suppression 
are  more  likely  to  be  associated  with  more  resilience, 
which  have  a  higher  probability  of  protecting  psycho-
logical wellbeing.

Moderating effect of emotion regulation 
between problem‑focused disengagement and resilience

Moreover,  in  individuals  with  high  problem-focused 
disengagement,  having  high  expressive  suppression  was 

Table 5  Correlations of continuous variables with resilience

significantly  associated  with  less  resilience.  Problem-
focused disengagement can be defined as aiming to solve 
a problem through the avoidance of a negative situation. 
Disengagement was found to be less effective in problem 
solving  and  subsequently  less  likely  to  produce  positive 
outcomes  [45].  Also,  higher  expressive  suppression  was 
associated  with  negative  emotional  consequences  [46]. 
Similarly,  another  study  showed  that  suppression  was 
related  to  higher  negative  emotion  and  lower  positive 
emotion  [30].  More  importantly  for  the  current  study, 
suppression  was  associated  with  ineffective  regulation 
of  emotions  according  to  previous  results  [47].  As  can 
be  deduced  from  the  results  discussed,  disengagement 
and  suppression  have  a  positive  relationship  and  both 
are related to worse psychological outcomes. This can be 
considered in accordance with the current results where 
high problem-focused engagement and high suppression 
were  related  to  less  resilience.  It  was  found  that  engag-
ing  in  positive  emotions  is  associated  with  developing 
higher  resilience  when  encountering  negative  situations 
[14]. Furthermore, effective emotion regulation was posi-
tively correlated with resilience [48]. As previously men-
tioned,  disengagement  strategy  for  emotion  regulation 
are less effective and associated with worse psychological 
variables [6]. Resilience is an adaptive tactic to deal with 
negative experiences and therefore, it can be considered 
rational  that  our  study  results  indicated  that  problem-
focused disengagement and high expressive suppression, 
which  are  related  to  worse  psychological  outcomes,  are 
associated with less resilience.

Clinical implications

Emotion  regulation  can  significantly  influence  how 
individuals  react  to  daily  life  events,  whether  positive 
or negative. The current results shed light on the nature 
of the relationship between emotion regulation, coping 
strategies  and  resilience,  which  in  turn  help  clinicians 
determine  how  a  certain  population  most  likely  reacts

tailor interventions that would be most effective for the 
Lebanese  population,  in  this  case.  Furthermore,  they 
might  be  able  to  identify  how  certain  profiles  react  to 

negative  situations  based  on  the  variables  at  hand  and 
avoid unpleasant responses such as violent or emotion-

Limitations

First,  the  data  was  collected  through  an  online  sur-
vey,  which  might  produce  response  bias.  Second,  the 

current study is cross-sectional and therefore causation 
cannot  be  inferred  regarding  the  relationship  between 
variables. Third, the lack of studies assessing the mod-
erating  role  of  emotion  regulation  between  coping 
strategies  and  resilience  affects  the  ability  to  compare 
the  current  results  with  previous  ones.  In  addition, 
information  bias  might  occur  due  to  the  use  of  self-
report measures to assess the variables evaluated. Fur-
thermore,  despite  the  fact  that  some  fit  indices  in  the 
CFA results might have a poor fit to the data, these cut-
off values should not be interpreted rigidly [49, 50] and 
2  and  between 
values  between  3.01  and  5.00  for  χnormed
0.08  and  0.10  for  RMSEA  can  indicate  acceptable  but 
mediocre fit to the data [51,  52]. Accordingly, the Ara-
bic  version  of  the  short  form  of  the  coping  strategies 
inventory  might  be  considered  a  valid  instrument  for 
the  assessment  of  coping  strategies  among  Lebanese 
adults.  Finally,  it  is  important  to  mention  the  possibil-
ity of residual confounding bias because other variables 
that might affect resilience were not considered in this 
study.

Conclusion
The  current  study  provides  findings  regarding  the  rela-
tionship  between  emotion  regulation,  coping  strate-
gies  and  resilience  in  all  of  their  dimensions.  Not  only 
does  this  introduce  novel  results  but  also  offers  precise 
inferences  relating  to  each  emotion  regulation  aspects,

different coping strategies and distinct elements of resil-
ience  within  the  Lebanese  population.  Furthermore, 
the  present  results  provide  insight  on  how  a  population 
under extreme stress receives and reacts to its reality.

Future perspectives
This  study  is  the  first  of  its  kind  within  the  Lebanese 
population, to the best of our knowledge. For that reason, 
it  might  inspire  the  replication  of  such  an  investigation 
involving  different  populations,  especially  in  countries 
in the region that don’t suffer from the same stressors as 
the Lebanese ones. This is important in order to inquire 
more  about  the  role  of  the  environment  as  well  as  the 
individual  characteristics  of  people.  Additionally,  a  lon-
gitudinal study on the same population could clarify the 
variability  of  such  strategies  and  reactions  as  situations 
change and progress.
