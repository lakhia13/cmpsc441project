Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)1 is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by 
difficulties in social communication and the presence of repetitive behaviors, unusually 
strong and sometimes unusual interests, and sensory hyper and hypo-sensitivities. 
Epidemiological estimates2 suggest a global autism prevalence of 1/100 with precise 
estimates ranging from 1.09/10,000 to 436.0/10,000. The wide variation in estimates reflects 
community-specific differences in access to services, awareness, and sociodemographic 
factors; for example, one recent survey of a racially and ethnically diverse caregiver cohort 
(n = 744) reported that Latinx and multiracial caregivers were significantly more likely 
than African-American/Black, White, and Asian parents to report that their autistic child 
had support needs that were unmet3,4. Some 33% of autistic individuals have co-occurring 
intellectual disability2; thus, approximately two-thirds of autistic individuals have cognitive 
abilities that are broadly commensurate with chronological age.

Adult outcomes in autism.

The transition into adulthood for autistic individuals is a difficult one, even in comparison 
to outcomes for other developmental disabilities5-8. The educational system provides 
many forms of support; after exiting school at age 18 or 21 years, autistic adults 
struggle significantly with underemployment or unemployment9, non-independent living 
arrangements10, unmet service needs10, psychiatric comorbidities11, and a lack of 
meaningful social relationships and loneliness5. One study reported that more than 50% 
of autistic adolescents were not engaged in either employment or educational activities

during the two year period following high school graduation5. Some American parents 
have described this difficult experience as “falling off the cliff”12, reflecting the sudden 
suspension of services upon which they previously relied.

Most autism research focuses on childhood and adolescence; only limited research has 
quantified the experiences and outcomes of autistic adults. Reviewed below, this research 
includes studies that code and quantify broad outcomes, that typically measure multiple 
outcome variables, such as occupation, friendships, independent living, and physical health, 
and activities, and collapse these into a global outcome score. Other research examines 
trajectories of change, typically by focusing on a small number of focal outcome variables.

Broad outcomes in cohorts of adults.

Studies have used a global outcomes rating, including employment, living situation, and 
friendships developed by Howlin13, and modified by Gillespie-Lynch 14. Results of these 
studies suggest that most autistic adults were “very dependent”; few lived alone, had 
close friends or permanent employment; stereotyped behaviors and interests persisted into 
adulthood. More than half of individuals with ASD who had left high school in the 
past 2 years reported no participation in employment or education6. Social isolation was 
described as a particularly prevalent and painful concern, with one-half to two-thirds of 
adults with autism reporting no real friendships 13,15,16. In a 2008 study, few individuals 
(4%) are described as having a “very good” outcome; some 17% had good outcomes, and 
the remainder had fair to very poor outcomes10. Social isolation, stress, depression, and 
anxiety were frequent concerns even with high IQ; see17 for a review. There is evidence 
that these difficulties tend to increase with age in ASD 18,19. Some negative outcomes are 
mitigated by higher family income, better adaptive skills in activities of daily living, fewer 
behavioral issues and co-occurring psychiatric conditions, milder autism symptoms, and lack 
of intellectual disability 5,6,9,11,20,21. Even so, adult outcomes of individuals diagnosed in 
the 1970s and 1980s (forming the bulk of the scant evidence base) are often poor22. While 
evidence is too limited to draw firm conclusions, research hints at improvement in global 
outcomes over time, as shown in Table 1. For example, the most recent reports suggest 
positive outcomes in approximately half of participants23.

Longitudinal changes.

Research conducted in the early 2000’s examined developmental change for individuals with 
a childhood diagnosis of autism. Piven and colleagues described adult outcomes in n = 38 
autistic individuals with high IQ, reporting that communication and social abilities were 
more likely to improve compared to repetitive and stereotyped behaviors24. Psychiatric, 
behavioral, and health difficulties were common; however, 13% of these individuals no 
longer met criteria for ASD (though still had unspecified “significant impairments”). 
Research by Turner, Stone, and colleagues 25,26 followed 48 children diagnosed at age two 
years to follow-up at ages four and nine years. They found that 38% no longer met criteria 
at age four, and that earlier age at diagnosis was a predictor of this outcome, suggesting 
earlier treatment is more effective. In a different sample of 25 children followed until age 
nine years, 88% retained the ASD diagnosis, and IQ scores were over 70 for 72% (and

in the average range or higher for 56%); this was a significant improvement from age 
two years. An estimated 32% of participants had conversational language skills, 56% had 
multiple words but were not able to engage in conversational exchanges, and 12% had 
very limited productive speech; none of the participants who were verbal at age two years 
fell into the limited speech group at age nine. A study of 80 children followed over 10 
years, conducted in India,23 indicated that 80% had fluent verbal skills; 43% had spoken 
abilities with significant challenges; 25% had meaningful friendships; and 46% displayed 
age-appropriate adaptive abilities. Fountain and colleagues followed a very large cohort 
of children (n = 6975) from ages two to 14 years and identified six distinct statistical 
trajectories 27. One group, comprising 10% of the sample, displayed a very steep trajectory, 
with significant delays at time one and age-appropriate levels of functioning by age 14 years. 
These individuals were more likely to have been white and non-Latinx, and to have parents 
with more education. Altogether, results of more recent studies suggest that most autistic 
children make meaningful gains in functioning. The variability in outcomes reflects the 
timing of treatment onset (with better outcomes when treatment is initiated at younger ages), 
as well as individual differences in communication skills, milder autism symptoms, higher 
cognitive abilities, stronger adaptive skills, and parental involvement in intervention28.

One of the strongest predictors of better outcomes is engagement in early intervention 
(EI). Most such interventions are grounded on the principles of applied behavioral analysis 
(ABA); current approaches (e.g., Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention, EIBI29, and the 
Early Start Denver Model (ESDM)30 are designed to address developmentally appropriate 
and socially relevant treatment goals, and are oriented towards a child’s own interests 
and choices. These approaches aim to motivate a child to participate and engage with 
the interventionist via play, home routines, naturalistic teaching, and structured learning 
environments; most are highly flexible and responsive to a child’s current behavior and 
affect. Related Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI)31 incorporate a 
mixture of both therapist-led and child-initiated approaches; these include programs such as 
Incidental Teaching32, Social Communication/Emotional Regulation/Transactional Supports 
(SCERTS)33, Enhanced Milieu Teaching34, Joint Attention, Symbolic Play, Engagement 
& Regulation (JASPER)35 and Early Achievements36; see Waddington, van der Meer and 
Sigafoos (2016) for more detailed description.37 Children in both ESDM and EIBI programs 
make significant gains in general cognitive ability after one year, with average gains in 
Developmental Quotient of 7.8 points (ESDM) or 14.8 points (EIBI), with no significant 
difference between the two approaches28. A systematic review of EIBI intervention studies 
compared to “care as usual” found significant gains in spoken language with a mean 
effect size of g = 0.26 and a confidence interval of 0.11 to 0.42 38; effects were largest 
when parents and clinicians collaborated in the intervention. While there more double-blind 
randomized treatment trials are needed, the evidence clearly demonstrates that gains are 
greater when individuals participate in EIBI.

The results of outcomes research describing individuals diagnosed in earlier decades may 
not generalize fully to individuals who are diagnosed now. We know that effective early 
detection tools have led to steady decreases in the current age at diagnosis. For example, 
the MCHAT-R 41,42 is a 23-item parent report checklist that can be completed in 5–10 
minutes, ideally during pediatric well-child visits. When paired with a follow-up phone call

for cases that fail the written screening, the MCHAT has excellent reliability (α = .85), with 
a positive predictive value (sensitivity) of .80 and a negative predictive value (specificity) 
of .99. Effective early screening leads to earlier diagnosis and thus to earlier engagement in 
behavioral intervention. Indeed, epidemiological work suggests that, currently, significantly 
more autistic children are being identified early (defined as prior to age 4 years) than in the 
past, with significant changes observed during the period of 2002 to 2016 43. Children were 
four times more likely to be identified by age 48 months in 2016, compared to 2002, with 
the largest increases observed for cases without concurrent intellectual disability (ID). Of 
course, the median age of diagnosis varies widely from state to state in the U.S., from (e.g.) 
36 months in California to 63 months in Minnesota44, due to differential access to services 
45.

More recent outcomes research.

Given significant changes in the timing of diagnosis and the provision of early intervention 
and other services, updated information about long-term and adult outcomes in ASD is 
of high interest. A recent meta-analysis reported that 20% had ‘good’ outcomes, with 
typical or near-typical social lives and satisfactory school/work functioning, 31% had a fair 
outcome, and 48% had a poor outcome 46. Outcomes were defined as follows: “very good” 
indicated a high level of independence; “good” indicated that some degree of support in 
daily living was required; “fair” indicated some degree of independence, where support 
and supervision was needed, but not placement outside the home; “poor” indicated that 
residential placement and a high level of support was needed; and “very poor” indicated a 
need for high-level institutional care. These findings represent an improvement compared to 
older studies. An extended longitudinal study followed autistic individuals from 2-13 years 
to ages 29-64 years47. Measures of language and cognitive abilities suggested stability or 
some improvement in 75%, but ongoing difficulty in language for 23%. Regarding aging 
in autism, a recent study found no evidence for heightened risk of cognitive decline or 
dementia in autistic adults without ID48. Several groups have been following individuals 
who were diagnosed with ASD prior to age 5 years, using gold-standard measures, into 
adulthood, with strongly positive outcomes. Anderson and colleagues 39 saw 85 autistic 
children diagnosed with ASD at age two years when those children were age 19 years. 
Of these, 62% had verbal IQ (VIQ) scores under 70, and 38% had VIQ scores of 71 or 
higher, and 9% no longer met criteria for ASD. These latter individuals were more likely 
to have had early behavioral intervention, and to have shown a reduction in repetitive and 
stereotyped behaviors between two and three years.

Loss of the autism diagnosis (LAD).

Although autism is generally assumed to be lifelong, there is evidence that 3 - 25% 
of children who meet clear diagnostic criteria for ASD will enter the typical range of 
cognitive, adaptive and social skills by adolescence, displaying no symptoms of autism49. 
Mukaddes and colleagues 40 described a sample of 39 children who met clear diagnostic 
criteria at age two years, but who no longer met criteria, according to expert clinical 
judgement, at age six years. Gillberg et al. reported that individuals who moved off the 
spectrum were largely free of other psychiatric disorders11 though there were increased

rates of psychiatric comorbidity. One study has followed individuals who were rigorously 
diagnosed early in development, who had no detectable symptoms of ASD by the time 
of adolescence50; a series of papers describing these individuals has examined multiple 
domains of functioning, and reported that individuals who had lost the ASD diagnosis 
(LAD) were generally indistinguishable from their non-autistic peers. Studied domains 
include social skills 51, personality and traits of the “Broader Autism Phenotype” 52, 
academic skills 53, standardized assessments of language 54, and experimental assessments 
of subtle pragmatic language skills 55-57. Executive Global Executive Composite scores as 
reported by parents using the BRIEF 58 were in the clinical range for significantly more 
autistic participants (50%) compared to LAD (4%) and non-autistic (0%) peers59. On direct 
assessment using the D-KEFS60, all executive functioning scores for LAD individuals were 
in the average range (though they had lower scores than non-autistic peers on measures of 
impulsivity, set-shifting, problem-solving, working memory, and planning). While present in 
childhood, restricted and repetitive behaviors in LAD individuals had resolved at the time 
of study61. Our recent work indicates that LAD individuals maintain their non-ASD status 
in adulthood67, according to brief impressions during the first few minutes of an interaction, 
and according to gold-standard expert clinician diagnoses. LAD young adults display 
heterogenous language outcomes (see also68); while most have structural (morphosyntactic) 
abilities that are in the average range or higher, they display significantly more language 
impairments than non-autistic peers 69,70.

A study of psychiatric profiles indicated equivalent lifetime prevalence of psychiatric 
diagnoses in LAD and autistic groups 62; while concurrent diagnoses persisted in the autism 
group, they waned in the LAD group, leaving the latter with elevated rates only of ADHD 
(inattentive or combined types) and specific phobias. Consistent with findings of meaningful 
syndromic overlap between ADHD and autism at both behavioral and genetic levels63, 
there is evidence that autism can “evolve” into ADHD, with age-appropriate social and 
communication skills alongside impairments and delays in executive function and adaptive 
skills64. Recent work by our group finds that, as young adults, LAD individuals have 
elevated rates of depression and anxiety relative to their neurotypical peers65, suggesting 
a relatively greater vulnerability to other psychiatric conditions in those with a history 
of autism; ongoing work is examining the role of treatment, but the predictors of this 
vulnerability are unknown to date. A careful ascertainment of internalizing disorders is 
warranted, given their higher prevalence in autistic young adults; estimates suggest that 
23-37% of autistic young adults experience depression66.

Neural functioning in LAD.

Although behaviorally indistinguishable from typically developing peers, functional 
neuroimaging results suggest that “normalized” behavior in LAD individuals reflects the 
action of compensatory neural systems71. Results of a functional MRI study performed 
during a sentence comprehension task indicated similar activations in frontal and temporal 
regions (left middle frontal, left supramarginal, and right superior temporal gyri) and 
posterior cingulate in LAD and autistic participants, where both differed from neurotypical 
peers. In addition, the LAD group had heightened activation in left precentral/postcentral 
gyri, right precentral gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, right supramarginal gyrus, left

superior temporal/parahippocampal gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, and cerebellum. 
These results suggested that in the context of highly typical language abilities, brain 
functioning differed.

Predictors of positive long-term outcomes.

Acquiring useful language by age five years is often listed as a predictor of positive 
outcomes in ASD; for example, in a study of 119 children, producing first words (other than 
“mama” or “dada”) by age 24 months was a particularly strong predictor of better outcomes 
early in life 72. Important predictors of clinically or functionally meaningful adolescent and 
adult outcomes, such as higher IQ scores and age-appropriate and unimpaired social and 
language abilities, include age-appropriate or higher cognitive abilities; relatively stronger 
verbal and motor imitation skills; better pretend play; milder earlier symptoms; and stronger 
motor skills; see Helt et al. for a review49. Note that earlier age of diagnosis, earlier 
engagement in intervention, and quicker response to intervention, are each associated with 
more age-appropriate outcomes and greater reductions in deficits and impairments. The 
presence of seizures, intellectual disabilities, and genetic syndromes are predictors of greater 
developmental delays and more ASD symptomatology in the long term. Interestingly, gender 
is not an important predictor of long-term outcomes.

Neurodiversity perspective.

What does a change in diagnostic status mean for an individual’s functioning and well-
being1? Advocates of the neurodiversity perspective have argued that autistic individuals 
need support and acceptance, rather than treatment and change, and that autism should 
be treated as a continuum of abilities rather than a categorical condition (as it is under 
the medical model). This argument is compelling given the enormous heterogeneity in 
abilities and long-term outcomes that characterizes autism as a clinical condition. Social 
impairments can range from an apparent disinterest in others (including family members), 
to a desire to socialize but with poor social judgment. Language abilities can range from 
a complete lack of spoken language with very limited comprehension, to language that is 
fluent and structurally within the normal range, but with poor pragmatic abilities. Cognitive 
functioning can encompass severe disability to the superior range. Repetitive behaviors and 
stereotyped interests encompass both debilitating self-injurious behaviors and idiosyncratic 
but functional strong interests.

While the neurodiversity approach to autism as a continuum of abilities rather than a clinical 
diagnosis is appealing for these and other reasons, we argue that the categorical medical 
model presents important practical advantages 73. Relevant constructs are the notions of 
impairment and distress, which are central to DSM definitions of disorders; thus, in a 
DSM diagnosis of an anxiety disorder but not in “everyday anxiety” individuals struggle 
to function and feel pervasive, disabling distress due to their symptoms. Following this 
logic, if LAD individuals display no symptoms, experience no functional impairments, 

1Note that studies of LAD individuals focus on an individual’s clinical strengths and challenge; the goal is to understand individual 
profiles of strengths and weaknesses, not to reduce access to services.

and experience little or no distress, they no longer fall into the diagnostic category of 
autism. Autistic self-advocates and others have argued that calling the loss of an ASD 
diagnosis a “positive outcome” implies that meeting criteria for the diagnosis is ipso facto 
a negative outcome74. We agree that society needs to accommodate both the strengths and 
weaknesses of autism and other neurodiverse conditions; the primary goal of diagnosis 
and intervention should not be the loss of the ASD diagnosis, but rather, maximizing 
an individual’s autonomy, relationships, and daily living skills (including the ability to 
participate in employment or activities outside the home), in a manner that is consistent 
with an individual’s preferences and interests 75. We believe that the LAD outcome reflects 
one such positive outcome. We also note that services that support autistic individuals are 
sometimes helpful to all. For example, a qualitative interview study of autistic adults and 
their experiences in the healthcare system 76 reported concerns about logistical barriers 
to accessing services (e.g., insurance, fees, transportation); concerns about the clinical 
environment (e.g., wait times, sensory qualities, and anxiety-provoking procedures); and 
concerns about health-care provider knowledge about autism, communication and rapport, 
individualized care, and approaching the relationship as a partner. Improving clinical care in 
these dimensions would better serve not just autistic individuals, but everyone.

Conclusions.

Because of the enormous heterogeneity in long-term and adult outcomes It would be 
clinically irresponsible to promise a particular prognosis to a child diagnosed with autism 
early in development. That said, the results reviewed here indicate that, because of 
success in earlier screening and diagnosis, and provision of early behavioral interventions, 
autistic children can currently anticipate more positive outcomes than their counterparts 
in past decades, including the possibility of losing the diagnosis altogether. Clinicians 
can encourage parents to engage children in treatment and intervention, with the realistic 
expectation that many children will achieve significant independence later in life; as 
our group’s work indicates, a significant minority will function at the level of their non-
autistic peers in adulthood, and can realistically hope to engage in meaningful social 
relationships, daily activities, and to be healthy and happy. Individuals who receive 
earlier behavioral interventions are likely as adults to display age-appropriate skills, fewer 
social communication challenges, and fewer repetitive behaviors or interests that present 
difficulties to those individuals. One important caveat is the likelihood of anxiety and 
depression symptoms in young adulthood for autistic individuals. Clinicians can recommend 
with confidence that individuals and families consider early behavioral interventions as a 
critical component of developmentally appropriate care77.

Key Points:

•

•

•

Research on autistic adults suggests significant heterogeneity in outcomes. A 
significant proportion of individuals struggle with intellectual disability and 
limited communication skills.

Of the 67% who have age-appropriate cognitive skills, around half are 
expected to attain a college education, and 25% are likely to hold a full-time 
job.

Outcomes have been improving over time, in part because of earlier diagnosis 
and earlier intervention. Indeed, an estimated 10-20% are expected to lose all 
symptoms of autism by adolescence.

Synopsis

Research on autistic adults suggests significant heterogeneity in outcomes. A significant 
proportion of individuals struggle with intellectual disability and limited communication 
skills. Of the 67% who have age-appropriate cognitive skills, around half are expected 
to attain a college education, and 25% are likely to hold a full-time job. Outcomes 
have been improving over time, in part because of earlier diagnosis and earlier 
intervention. Indeed, an estimated 10-20% are expected to lose all symptoms of autism 
by adolescence.

Clinical Care Points

Producing first words (other than “mama” or “dada”) by age 24 months is a 
strong predictor of better childhood outcomes in autism.

The best predictors of adult outcomes are early diagnosis, early engagement 
in intervention, milder early symptoms, and quicker response to intervention. 
Other important predictors of positive adult outcomes are higher IQ scores, 
using verbal communication in childhood, motor skills, motor imitation skills, 
pretend play, milder earlier symptoms. The effect size of early intervention 
on later outcomes is of large magnitude, though more randomized controlled 
trials are needed.

Parents and caregivers seek guidance on maximizing communication abilities, 
social relationships with peers, adaptive skills, managing challenging 
behaviors and, in the long term, a child’s prospects for employment, 
education, independence, and having a family. In addition, families prioritize 
access to early intervention and other critical supports; the financial means to 
cover these supports is a significant stressor for many families.

Adult outcomes are improving over time, due to earlier diagnosis and 
engagement in intervention. Reflecting input from community stakeholders, 
clinical priorities of adults include improving access to informed and 
individualized health care, management of highly prevalent co-occurring 
psychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, and ADHD, and 
promoting broader social acceptance of autistic behaviors.
