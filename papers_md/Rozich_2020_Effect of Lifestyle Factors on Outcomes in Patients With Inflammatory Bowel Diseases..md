Abstract

Various lifestyle factors including physical activity and obesity, stress, sleep and smoking may 
modify risk of developing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In patients with established IBD, 
these lifestyle factors may significantly impact natural history and clinical outcomes. Recreational 
exercise decreases risk of flare and fatigue in patients with IBD. In contrast, obesity increases the 
risk of relapse, and is associated higher anxiety, depression, fatigue and pain and higher healthcare 
utilization. Obesity also modifies pharmacokinetics of biologic agents unfavorably and is 
associated with higher risk of treatment failure. Sleep disturbance is highly prevalent in patients 
with IBD, independent of disease activity, and increases the risk of relapse and chronic fatigue. 
Similarly, stress, particularly perceived stress rather than major life events, may trigger 
symptomatic flare in patients with IBD, though it’s impact on inflammation is unclear. Cigarette 
smoking is associated with unfavorable outcomes including risk of corticosteroid-dependence, 
surgery and disease progression in patients with Crohn’s disease; in contrast, smoking does not 
significantly impact outcomes in patients with ulcerative colitis, though some studies suggest that 
it may be associated with lower risk of flare. The effect of alcohol and cannabis use in patients 
with IBD is inconsistent, with some studies suggesting cannabis may decrease chronic pain in 
patients with IBD, without a significant effect of biological remission. While these lifestyle factors 
are potentially modifiable, only a few interventional studies have been conducted. Trials of 
structured exercise and psychological therapy including mindfulness-based therapies such as

The global incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is rising, with 
steep increase in incidence in newly industrialized countries.1 Various lifestyle factors 
besides diet including physical activity (and obesity) and smoking have been implicated in 
the recent epidemiological trends in the risk of developing IBD, and have been covered 
elsewhere.2, 3 This review focuses on how important lifestyle factors – physical activity (and 
obesity), smoking, alcohol consumption and cannabis use, sleep, and stress – affect the 
natural history and outcomes in patients with established IBD, and how modifying lifestyle 
may improve IBD outcomes. The impact of diet and dietary modification in patients with 
established IBD has been covered elsewhere.

PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND OBESITY IN PATIENTS WITH IBD

Physical activity and exercise may be associated with decreased risk of developing IBD, 
particularly Crohn’s disease (CD). However, the development of IBD, particularly presence 
of active symptoms, impairs patients’ ability to exercise and participation in sports activities.
4, 5 In survey studies, approximately 50% patients report that IBD moderately or 
significantly impacted their fitness.4 One of the consequences of lack of exercise is obesity. 
Approximately 15–40% adult patients with IBD are obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 
kg/m2) and an additional 20–40% are overweight, with a comparable distribution of obesity 
in CD and ulcerative colitis (UC).6

Impact of Physical Activity and Obesity on Natural History of IBD

Physiologically, the benefits of exercise in boosting immune response and reducing pro-
inflammatory cytokines is well known.7 Voluntary exercise in animal models of chemical-
induced colitis have also shown to mitigate symptoms and reduce inflammatory burden.8 
However, there have been limited studies on the impact of physical activity and exercise on 
the natural history of IBD. Most cross-sectional studies have focused on how IBD disease 
activity may negatively impact ability to exercise, and are confounded by disease severity. In 
a prospective cohort study of 1857 patients with IBD, Jones and colleagues observed that 
higher level of exercise was independently associated with 24–32% lower risk of 
symptomatic relapse over 6 months among patients in remission.9

Obesity, in contrast, has been associated with a lower prevalence of clinical remission and 
higher anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain and inferior social function scores on PROMIS 
measures, as compared to non-obese patients with IBD.10 Longitudinal studies suggest that 
obesity may negatively impact clinical course and healthcare utilization (Table 1). In a large 
internet-based cohort study of 7296 patients with IBD (4748 patients with CD, 19.5% obese; 
2548 patients with UC, 20.3% obese), Jain and colleagues observed that obesity was

independently associated with increased risk of persistent disease activity or relapse in 
patients with CD (class II or III obesity vs. normal BMI: OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.30–2.68) and 
UC (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.75–5.17), with a dose-response relationship.10 In a propensity 
score-matched, nationally representative cohort study of 42,285 patients with IBD (12.4% 
obese), Nguyen and colleagues observed that obese patients with IBD had a higher annual 
burden and costs of hospitalization, as compared to non-obese patients.11 Besides overall 
obesity, visceral adiposity has been more consistently associated with adverse outcomes in 
patients with IBD. High visceral adipose tissue volume was associated with increased risk of 
penetrating or stricturing complications (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.9), hospitalization (OR, 
1.9; 95% CI, 1.2–3.4) and shorter time interval to surgery (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0–2.0), after 
adjusting for age and BMI in a pediatric cohort of patients with CD.12 High visceral fat area 
has also been associated with increased risk of recurrence of CD after surgical resection.13

Impact of Physical Activity and Obesity on Treatment Response and Surgery in IBD

There have been limited studies on how usual physical activity may modify pharmacologic 
treatment response in patients with IBD. Biologically, exercise has been shown to reduce 
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), which may conceivably augment response to TNFα 
antagonists though this has not been studied.14 Physical fitness is associated with superior 
outcomes after major surgery, including abdominal surgery. Several randomized trials and 
meta-analyses have also demonstrated the benefit of physical exercise prehabilitation, 
including aerobic exercises and/or resistance training in reducing post-operative morbidity 
and pulmonary complications in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.15, 16

In contrast, population pharmacokinetic studies of all biologic agents used in IBD have 
identified high body weight as a risk factor associated with increased drug clearance, 
resulting in shorter half-lives and low trough drug concentrations.6 This effect might be 
related to impaired absorption of subcutaneously administered agents, rapid proteolysis and 
to a ‘TNF-sink’ phenomenon with higher inflammatory burden due to adipose tissue in 
obese patients. Kurnool and colleagues observed that each 1kg/m2 increase in BMI was 
associated with 4% increase in the risk of treatment failure, 8% increase in the risk of 
surgery or hospitalization and 6% lower odds of achieving endoscopic remission in a cohort 
160 biologic-treated patients with UC, with comparable effects seen with fixed-dose 
therapies and weight-based agents.17 In a prospective cohort of adalimumab-treated patients 
with CD, Bultman and colleagues observed that over one-third of patients were dose-
escalated to weekly adalimumab within a median 5 months of initiating therapy, and BMI 
was the only independent predictor of dose escalation.18 However, in a post-hoc analyses of 
clinical trials of infliximab in IBD, demonstrated no association between obesity and short-
term clinical remission and mucosal healing in infliximab- or placebo-treated patients.19, 20 
In a systematic review of 54 cohorts including 19,372 tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) 
antagonist-treated patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (23% obese), 
Singh and colleagues observed that patients with obesity had 60% higher odds of failing 
therapy (OR,1.60; 95% CI,1.39–1.83), with a dose-response relationship; each 1kg/m2 
increase in BMI was associated with 6.5% higher odds of treatment failure.19 Whether a 
similar negative effect of obesity on response to targeted small molecule inhibitors, such as 
tofacitinib, is unclear.

Intra-abdominal surgeries in patients with obesity are both technically challenging and are 
associated with higher rates of post-operative complications than surgeries in patients with a 
normal BMI. In a systematic review, Makino and colleagues observed longer operative 
times, an increased likelihood of conversion to open procedures, more comorbidities, a 
higher risk of postoperative complications (in particular wound infection) and a longer 
length of hospital stay in obese patients undergoing colorectal resection compared to 
individuals who were not obese.21 Two aspects of surgery that might be particularly 
challenging in patients with IBD merit special mention. First, obesity makes creating a 
stoma challenging due to stomal retraction, higher rates of complications such as parastomal 
hernia, mucocutaneous separation and stoma prolapse. Second, the mesentery of patients 
with obesity tends to be foreshortened by the mesenteric fat, making it more challenging to 
create a J-pouch in patients with UC. Obesity increases risk of short-term postoperative 
complications in patients undergoing ileal pouch–anal anastomosis, although long-term 
outcomes might be comparable to those in patients without obesity in experienced centers.22

Can Structured Exercise Interventions and Treating Obesity Help IBD?

Several small studies have evaluated the impact of diverse structured exercise interventions, 
including cardiovascular training, strength training, yoga, and mind-body therapies, on 
outcomes in patients with IBD, albeit or poor methodological quality and short duration of 
follow-up.14 These studies have generally demonstrated improvement in overall fitness, 
increase bone mineral density and reduction in stress and anxiety. However, they have 
variably demonstrated modest benefits in IBD-related clinical disease activity or 
biochemical markers of inflammation. Experts have recommended maintaining an active 
lifestyle with moderate intensity endurance and resistance exercise in an enjoyable activity 
at least 30 minutes per day, three times per week in patients with mild to moderately active 
IBD.14

Though there are no interventional studies of intentional weight loss in IBD, trials of diet 
and/or lifestyle-induced weight loss in other autoimmune diseases suggest improvement in 
disease outcomes with weight loss. In trials in obese patients with psoriasis, those 
randomized to weight loss intervention were 2.9 times more likely to achieve remission, 
compared to those without intervention (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.39–6.13).23 In a randomized 
trial comparing low calorie or free-managed diet in 126 patients with psoriatic arthritis 
starting anti-TNF therapy, Di Munno et al observed that regardless of type of intervention, 
patients who achieved ≥5% weight loss were 4.2 times more likely to achieve clinical 
remission, as compared to those who experienced <5% weight loss.24 Similar benefits with 
weight loss in obese patients with IBD are conceivable. Case series have shown that bariatric 
procedures in selected morbidly obese patients with IBD result in improvement in disease 
activity after weight loss.25 Diet and lifestyle modifications to achieve weight loss may be 
challenging in IBD patients due to active gastrointestinal symptoms and a high prevalence of 
comorbid irritable bowel syndrome. Endoscopic bariatric interventions are currently 
contraindicated in patients with IBD; pharmacological weight loss interventions are 
attractive. A phase 2 clinical trial an FDA-approved weight loss medication, phentermine-
topiramate in obese biologic-treated patients with UC is ongoing.

SLEEP AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN PATIENTS WITH IBD

Sleep disturbance is prevalent in patients with IBD. Between 47% and 82% of patients with 
IBD report disrupted sleep, night-time awakenings and nonrestorative sleep as compared 
with one-third of the general population.26, 27 In a large study of 3173 patients with IBD, 
60% reported sleep disturbance at baseline.28 Strongest risk factors for sleep disturbance 
were depressive symptoms and active disease, with female sex, smoking and diagnosis of 
CD (vs. UC) also being associated with sleep disturbance. The relationship between sleep, 
sleep disturbance and IBD is bi-directional. Active disease is invariably associated with poor 
sleep quality. In a prospective study, all patients with symptomatically active IBD had poor 
sleep quality, as compared to 73% patient with quiescent disease.27 This includes more 
awakenings, longer sleep latency and reduced stage 3 sleep using electroencephalographic 
recordings, compared to patients with quiescent disease and healthy controls. Even among 
patients with quiescent disease, patients with IBD have inferior sleep quality as compared to 
healthy controls, similar to patients with irritable bowel syndrome, with prolonged sleep 
latency, greater sleep fragmentation, shorter sleep duration and greater use of sleep aids. 
Rates of sleep disturbance are higher in patients with objective evidence of inflammation, 
independent of symptoms.29

Circadian Misalignment in Patients with IBD

Circadian homeostasis maintains the sleep-wake cycle and plays a key role in preserving 
healthy immune function.30 Disruption of this process, or circadian misalignment, can 
promote inflammatory diseases such as IBD. Contributors to circadian misalignment 
including social jet lag (discrepancy between innate circadian rhythms and actual sleep time 
due to social obligations), sleep debt (difference between average sleep duration during the 
work week and work-free days) and chronotype (a person’s biological inclination to sleep 
during a certain time of day). Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that, as compared to 
healthy controls, patients with IBD have higher social jet lag and sleep debt.31 Moreover, 
this circadian misalignment has been associated with more aggressive CD with stricturing 
and fistulizing behavior, and CD-related surgery.

Impact of Sleep Disturbance on Natural History and Outcomes in IBD

Prospective cohort studies have demonstrated the negative impact of sleep disturbance on 
risk of relapse and impaired quality of life in patients with IBD. In a cohort study, 
Ananthakrishnan and colleagues observed that sleep disturbance was independently 
associated with 1.6 to 2-fold higher risk of disease flare over 6m in 651 patients with CD in 
clinical remission at baseline.28 In contrast, they did not observe any significant association 
between sleep disturbance and subsequent risk of relapse in patients with asymptomatic UC. 
Poor sleep quality is also a significant contributor to fatigue observed in patients with IBD. 
In a prospective, population-based Manitoba IBD cohort study, fatigue was a common 
symptom reported in 72% patients with active disease and 30% patients with inactive 
disease.26 In these patients, poor sleep quality was independently associated with fatigue, in 
both patients with active and inactive IBD. Similarly, Borren and colleagues observed that 
sleep disruption in patients with inactive IBD is associated with persistent fatigue.32 A

positive feedback loop might exist whereby active disease leads to poor sleep that in turn 
worsens inflammation, with both factors leading to fatigue.

Can Improving Sleep Hygiene Improve Outcomes in Patients with IBD?

Treating active IBD with pharmacotherapy has been associated with improved sleep hygiene 
in patients with IBD. However, it remains unclear how improving sleep hygiene impacts 
outcomes in patients with IBD. No clinical trials have evaluated whether structured 
interventions to improve sleep quality decrease the risk of clinical relapse and improve 
objective measures of inflammation in patients with IBD. However, it is conceivable the 
improving sleep hygiene would improve fatigue and quality of life in patients with IBD. 
Experts recommend systematic evaluation of sleep hygiene in patients with IBD with 
fatigue.33, 34 Patients with poor sleep quality should be screened for comorbid conditions 
like obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome and insomnia and educated on sleep 
hygiene. Patients with persistent sleep disturbance should be referred to a sleep specialist for 
potential pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy.

STRESS IN PATIENTS WITH IBD

In contrast to psychiatric illnesses like depression and anxiety, stress is broadly defined as 
threat to a steady state of homeostasis in an individual’s life, and implicates both a stressor 
(i.e., an environmental demand) and an individual’s physiological and emotional response to 
the stressor.35 Stress is pervasive in modern lifestyle with approximately 60% of Americans 
reporting stress. Exaggerated response to a stressor may be functionally disruptive and 
evolve into a psychiatric illness; conversely, in a patient with anxiety, stress perception may 
be disproportionate to environmental demand. While the negative impact of major 
psychological comorbidities on disease activity and healthcare utilization in patients with 
IBD is increasingly being recognized, the impact of daily stressors and perceived stress on 
disease course and outcomes in patients with IBD is less clear.36 Pathophysiologically, stress 
has been demonstrated to negatively impact gastrointestinal function and increase gut 
permeability through its impact on the immune, endocrine and nervous system.

Impact of Stress on the Natural History and Outcomes in Patients with IBD

Patients with chronic health conditions, like IBD, have higher prevalence of stress than the 
general population, in common domains of finances, work and family. Stress, particularly 
‘perceived stress’, can impact IBD disease activity. Early retrospective case-control studies 
have variably suggested that major stressful life events may lead to a higher risk of 
developing IBD, though were limited by recall bias.37, 38 More importantly, measuring stress 
based only on occurrence of life events captures burden of conventional stressors and not an 
individual’s response to it, often referred to as ‘perceived stress’. Prospective cohort studies 
have suggested that high perceived stress in the preceding 3–6 months may be associated 
with an increased risk of symptomatic flares.39–42 In a survey study of 600 patients in the 
population-based University of Manitoba IBD Research Registry, high perceived stress in 
the preceding 3 months, as measured by the Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale, and not 
occurrence of a major life event or negative mood, was associated with 2.4-fold higher odds 
of developing a flare, based on clinical disease activity indices.39 However, perceived stress

was not associated with increased fecal calprotectin, as a biomarker of inflammation, 
suggesting that the impact of stress may be mediated through it’s impact of gastrointestinal 
function and not necessarily an abnormal immune response.43 In a comprehensive 
prospective cohort study evaluating clinical, biological and psychosocial parameters 
predictive of clinical relapse in 101 patients with quiescent CD, Bitton and colleagues 
observed that besides conventional factors of high-risk phenotype (elevated C-reactive 
protein, presence of fistulizing disease), patients with high perceived stress and ineffective 
avoidance coping had a shorter time to relapse.44 Besides the impact of an acutely stressful 
event, chronically high perceived stress is independently associated with a higher risk of 
relapse. In a prospective cohort study of 62 patients with UC followed over 5 years, 
Levenstein and colleagues observed that high long-term (>2y) perceived stress tripled the 
risk of UC flare.45

The relationship between stress and IBD symptoms is bidirectional. Approximately 30% 
patients with symptomatic IBD report higher rates of perceived stress due to their IBD; in 
contrast, patients with IBD who are asymptomatic are significantly less likely to report stress 
due to their IBD.46

Can Decreasing Stress Improve Outcomes in Patients with IBD?

Stress management is challenging, with the pervasive nature and diverse settings and sources 
of stress. RCTs of psychological therapy including cognitive behavioral therapy, 
mindfulness-based therapies such as meditation and yoga, and gut-directed hypnotherapy 
have not been shown to be effective in decreasing perceived stress in patients with IBD.47 
While these therapies may improve quality of life and depression over a short-term, they 
have not been shown to significantly improve disease activity or decrease risk of clinical 
relapse.

SMOKING IN PATIENTS WITH IBD

Cigarette smoking has been associated with an increased risk of developing CD, particularly 
in Western countries, although with a lower risk of developing UC across all regions.2 
Continued smoking, smoking cessation and nicotine replacement may variably modify 
outcomes in patients with established IBD.

Impact of Smoking on Outcomes in IBD

Crohn’s Disease—Smoking has consistently been associated with a more severe 
phenotype, complicated behavior and adverse outcomes in CD.48–50 In a recent Spanish 
registry-based cohort of 3224 patients with CD, current smokers were more likely to have 
ileum-dominant CD, perianal disease and stricturing phenotype. Smoking has also been 
associated with progression from inflammatory to penetrating or stricturing behavior.51 In a 
meta-analysis of 33 high quality cohort studies with ~11,000 patients with CD, To and 
colleagues observed that, compared with non-smokers, smokers had 56–85% increase CD 
flares, a nearly twofold increase in clinical recurrence after surgery, a 54–68% increase in 
the need for first surgery and a twofold increase in rates of second surgery.52 Smoking has 
been associated with higher corticosteroid use, corticosteroid-requiring disease flares and

corticosteroid-dependency.53 Smokers also achieve higher 6-thioguanine nucleotide levels as 
compared to non-smokers, though it has not been consistently associated with higher 
effectiveness of thiopurines.54, 55 In the TOPPIC trial comparing mercaptopurine vs. placebo 
for preventing recurrence of CD after surgery, mercaptopurine was effective in decreasing 
risk of clinical recurrence only in patients who were smokers; no benefit was observed in 
non-smokers.56 However, smoking has not been shown to modify response to biologic 
therapy.57, 58

Ulcerative Colitis—Unlike CD, smoking does not negatively impact clinical outcomes in 
patients with established UC and may potentially be protective against adverse outcomes. In 
a nationally representative study of 6754 patients with UC (13% smokers at diagnosis), 
Blackwell and colleagues observed no significant difference in risk of severe UC flare 
requiring corticosteroids, corticosteroid-dependency and need for thiopurines between 
smokers, ex-smokers and non-smokers.59 In a meta-analysis of 16 high quality cohort 
studies, there was no significant difference in risk of UC flare (smokers vs. non-smokers: 4 
studies; OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.65–2.44), colectomy (5 studies; OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.62–1.26), 
proximal disease extension (4 studies; OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.20–1.66) and development of 
pouchitis in patients with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (3 studies; OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.21–
1.53).60 In contrast, a 2015 meta-analysis of 20 observational studies in patients with UC, 
including case-control studies, smokers had a lower risk of colectomy, as compared to non-
smokers (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33–0.91).61

Impact of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes in IBD

Crohn’s Disease—Smoking cessation appears to mitigate risk and adverse outcomes 
associated with smoking in patients with CD. In a prospective cohort study of 899 patients 
with CD (474 non-smokers, 59 quitters) followed over 29 months, Cosnes and colleagues 
observed that risk of disease flare, corticosteroid exposure, and treatment modification was 
comparable between quitters and never smokers, and was significantly lower as compared to 
continued smokers.62 In another population-based inception cohort study of 749 patients 
with CD who were smokers at diagnosis, 44% quit within 2 years of CD diagnosis.53 As 
compared to persistent smokers, those who quit smoking were less likely to be 
corticosteroid-dependent on follow-up, though rates of intestinal resection were not 
different. Meta-analyses have also suggested no significant differences in former vs. never 
smokers in risks of disease flare, initial and repeat surgery in patients with CD.52

Despite evidence on the detrimental effects of smoking, and beneficial effects of smoking 
cessation in patients with CD, smoking prevalence remains high, with many patients being 
unaware of the detrimental effects of smoking on CD course and outcomes.63 While passive 
education on smoking cessation may not be helpful, structured smoking cessation programs 
involving individual counseling, nicotine replacement, and/or pharmacotherapy have been 
effective in helping patients with CD quit, and may improve disease outcomes.64

Ulcerative Colitis—Anecdotally, patients have associated quitting smoking with 
triggering a flare of UC, though it has been challenging to establish a true temporal 
relationship in robust clinical studies. In a case-control study of 32 patients with UC who

quit smoking after diagnosis, matched with nonsmoker and continuing smoker controls, 
Beaugerie and colleagues observed that patients who quit smoking were more likely to have 
active disease, be hospitalized, and require treatment with steroids and immunomodulators.
65 More recent systematic studies have failed to demonstrate the negative impact of quitting 
smoking in patients with UC. In a UK population-based cohort, there was no significant 
difference in rates of flares requiring corticosteroids, corticosteroid-dependence, UC-related 
hospitalization or colectomy between patients who quit smoking within 2 years of UC 
diagnosis vs. persistent smokers, though crude rates of corticosteroid use and thiopurine use 
was higher in those who quit smoking.59 In a meta-analysis, To and colleagues found no 
significant difference in risk of colectomy between ex-smokers, current smokers, and never 
smokers.60

Impact of Nicotine Replacement in UC

With the protective association between smoking and risk of UC, nicotine replacement 
therapy has been studied as adjunctive therapy in patients with UC. Early clinical trials of 
high-dose transdermal nicotine (>15mg/d) in non-smoking patients with mild to moderately 
active UC despite mesalamine therapy suggested benefit in inducing clinical remission, but 
not in maintaining remission, over placebo;66, 67 however, it was not as effective as low dose 
prednisone.68 Nicotine enemas, 6mg/d were not effective in inducing remission in patients 
with distal UC.69 Treatment-limiting side effects are common with nicotine, which leads to 
withdrawal of therapy, and hence, is not recommended for routine management.70 It’s role in 
modern management of UC, with availability of multiple immunosuppressive therapies has 
not been evaluated.

ALCOHOL AND CANNABIS USE IN PATIENTS WITH IBD

Alcohol Use in IBD

Alcohol has not been linked definitively as either a risk factor for development of IBD71, 72 
or to any specific adverse outcomes.73, 74 Two separate meta-analyses, one each for CD and 
UC, found no association between alcohol consumption and risk of developing CD (6 
studies; OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.68–1.08) or UC (9 studies; OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.65–1.39).72, 75 
However, 30–60% patients with IBD often voluntarily avoid alcohol.76, 77 Survey studies 
have variably suggested either subjective worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms or no 
change in clinical disease activity or biomarkers of inflammation with alcohol consumption.
76, 78 Magee and colleagues observed that dietary intake of wine and beer, but not spirits, in 
patients with UC across disease spectrum, is significantly associated with worse endoscopic 
disease activity.79 In a prospective cohort study of 183 patients with UC in remission, Jowett 
and colleagues observed that higher intake of alcoholic beverages, particularly sulfite-
containing beverages, was associated with a 2.4-fold higher risk of clinical relapse.80 
However, these findings have been inconsistent. In an experimental study in 23 patients with 
IBD in remission, moderate intake of alcohol (1–3 glasses for red wine per day for 1 week) 
was not associated with clinical relapse, and in fact, was associated with a significant decline 
in fecal calprotectin.81 Overall, it seems that moderate alcohol consumption may be safe in 
patients with IBD.

Cannabis Use in IBD

Page 10

Approximately 10–20% patients with IBD are active cannabis users, though this is probably 
underestimated with increasing legalization across North America.82 In survey studies, 
chronic abdominal pain and prior abdominal surgery were associated with 3.5 to 5-fold 
higher odds of marijuana use, with self-reported improvement in pain, cramping and 
diarrhea, and increased appetite, with marijuana.83, 84

Small interventional studies have suggested that cannabis use may improve IBD-related 
symptoms in patients with CD. In the first RCT of cannabis in 21 patients with active CD, 
Naftali and colleagues demonstrated that, as compared to placebo, smoking 2 cannabis 
cigarettes per day for 8 weeks was associated with significantly higher rates of clinical 
response (decline in Crohn’s disease activity index [CDAI] by 100 points) (90% vs. 40%, 
p=0.03) and numerically higher rates of clinical remission (CDAI <150; 40% vs. 10%, 
p=0.11); however, cannabis use was not associated with any significant change in 
biochemical markers of inflammation.85 A subsequent RCT of low-dose oral cannabidiol 
(CBD) RCT of 19 patients with active CD from the same group of investigators, failed to 
demonstrate any positive effect in clinical and biochemical parameters.86 In a placebo-
controlled trial in patients with active UC on mesalamine, Irving and colleagues assessed the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily oral CBD for 10 weeks.87 They observed no 
significant difference in rates of clinical remission (CBD vs. placebo: 28% vs. 26%), 
although there were considerable protocol deviations, with 90% patients receiving CBD 
extract reporting treatment-related adverse events. In contrast, Naftali and colleagues 
observed that smoking 2 cannabis cigarettes per day for 8 weeks was associated with clinical 
and endoscopic response, but no biochemical response, in an RCT of 28 patients with 
moderate to severely active UC. While there is considerable enthusiasm for the potential 
benefit of cannabis, particularly in the patient community, long-term effect of cannabis in 
these patients with IBD is unknown. In the general population, long-term use of cannabis is 
associated increased risk of addiction to other substances, diminished life achievement, 
increase in motor vehicle accidents, symptoms of chronic bronchitis, abnormal brain 
development in a younger population, psychiatric disturbances, depression, and anxiety, and 
risk of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome in frequent cannabis users.88 At this point, there is 
very limited evidence to inform the routine use of cannabis in patients with IBD.

In summary, several modifiable lifestyle factors play a vital role in the course and outcomes 
of patients with IBD. Figure 1 summarizes key findings on impact of these lifestyle factors 
in patients with established IBD. Well-designed prospective cohort studies to better 
understand their impact on the natural history and randomized interventional studies of 
lifestyle factor modification are warranted to augment the effectiveness of current 
pharmacological therapies. In the meantime, a conscious and deliberate assessment of these 
lifestyle factors is warranted for every patient with IBD, and serves as a key aspect in 
engaging patients in adjunctive self-management of their disease.
