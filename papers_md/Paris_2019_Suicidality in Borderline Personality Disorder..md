Abstract: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with suicidal behaviors and self-harm.
Up to 10% of BPD patients will die by suicide. However, no research data support the eﬀectiveness of
suicide prevention in this disorder, and hospitalization has not been shown to be useful. The most
evidence-based treatment methods for BPD are speciﬁcally designed psychotherapies.

Keywords: suicide suicidality personality disorder; borderline personality disorder; self-harm

1. Introduction

This review is based on a search with the key words “borderline personality disorder” and “suicide
or suicidality” in MEDLINE and PsycINFO of all articles since 2000 (along with some important older
articles). This review focuses on articles that are most relevant to the following questions:

(1) What suicidal behaviors are seen in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD),

and what is their motivation?

(2) What is the risk for death by suicide in BPD?
(3) Is there evidence for the value of hospitalizing suicidal BPD patients?
(4) What are the most evidence-based treatments for suicidal BPD patients?

2. Suicidal Behaviors in BPD

As deﬁned by the DSM-5 [1] and by the ICD-11 [2], personality disorders (PDs) are characterized
by abnormal patterns of inner experience and behavior. These aﬀect cognition, emotion, interpersonal
functioning, impulse control, are inﬂexible and pervasive, lead to clinically signiﬁcant distress or
impairment, are stable and of long duration, and have an onset in adolescence or early adulthood.
Personality disorders are common in practice, and can be found, above and beyond other diagnoses,
in up to 45% of all outpatients [3]. Of these, BPD is by far the most researched category due to the
clinical challenges it presents.

BPD is associated with a wide range of psychopathology, including unstable mood, impulsive
behaviors, as well as unstable interpersonal relationships [1]. BPD patients have a mean of three
lifetime suicide attempts, mostly by overdose [4].

Self-harm behaviors (i.e., non-suicidal self-injury) (NSSI) [5], are also common in BPD. NSSI usually
presents as superﬁcial cuts to the wrists and arms. However, NSSI is not suicidal in intent; BPD
patients have problems with emotional regulation and cut themselves addictively to reduce painful
inner states [6]. Cutting relieves emotional tension, but does not reﬂect a wish to die [7].

While drug overdoses can sometimes be life threatening, these behaviors vary greatly in nature
and intent. They usually occur following stressful life events, and patients describe their motivation
as a wish to escape [7]. Most incidents reﬂect ambivalent motivation, involving small quantities of
medication and/or calling signiﬁcant others for help. Even when potentially fatal overdoses occur,
patients often contact people who are in a position to intervene.

It has long been established that suicide attempters and completers are separate but overlapping
populations [8]. In a large-scale follow-up of attempters seen in an emergency room (ER), only about
3% eventually died by suicide [9]. Most repetitive attempts occur in young women, and decrease with
time [10].

3. Death by Suicide in BPD Patients

Follow-back research has found that suicide occurs in up to 10% of BPD cases [11,12].
However, lower rates (3%–6%) have been reported in prospectively followed cohorts [13–15].
These discrepancies could reﬂect less-severe suicidality in patients who agree to be followed in
research studies.

By and large, suicides in BPD occur later in the course of the illness and follow long courses of
unsuccessful treatment [16]. A 15-year follow-back study found that the mean age at suicide to be 30 [12],
while a 27-year follow-up reported a mean age of 37, with a standard deviation of 10 [11]. Thus, patients
are not at their highest risk of suicide when they are young and frequent visitors to the ER.

Even so, patients with BPD do kill themselves. Psychological autopsy methods, which involve
post-mortem interviews with families, have examined the frequency of this diagnosis in death by
suicide [17–19]. In these studies, PDs were present in about half of the cases under the age of 35, with
BPD being the most common category.

A meta-analysis by Pompili et al. [20] noted that suicidality is “more alarming” in young people,
with a high level of suicidal behaviors. Yet the great majority of BPD patients eventually improve over
time [16], and those who die by suicide tend to be those who fail to recover.

Males with BPD have a diﬀerent pattern. Nearly a third of youth suicides, most of whom are
male, can be diagnosed with BPD by psychological autopsy [17]. Other studies of BPD patients who
died by suicide also show a preponderance of males [21]. Few of these patients were in treatment at
the time of their death.

4. Hospitalization for Suicidality in BPD Patients

Many BPD patients have courses of treatment marked by multiple failed suicide attempts.
These treatments are associated with multiple trials of psychotherapy, multiple prescriptions, repeated
emergency room visits, and hospitalization for suicide attempts and threats [22]. Yet the research
literature on the management of suicidality in BPD does not provide evidence-based guidelines for the
prevention of death by suicide [23].

It has long been known that clinicians lack algorithms that can predict a fatal outcome in major
mental disorders with any accuracy. As summarized in an article in The Lancet [24], in spite of a large
body of research on suicide prediction, there is still no eﬀective algorithm that can be used in practice
to predict suicide. At best, clinicians are left with guidelines that may be commonsensical, but that lack
empirical support.

However, the absence of evidence for prevention has not changed practice in managing BPD.
Speciﬁcally, many patients are admitted to hospital when they attempt or threaten suicide. It is
understandable that clinicians want to err on the safe side, but the absence of controlled data prevents
us from concluding that hospital stays oﬀer an eﬀective method of suicide prevention. Admission for
suicidal threats was recommended by the American Psychiatric Association guidelines for the treatment
of BPD [25]. However, these guidelines, which have never been updated, were based on clinical
opinion, and not on data showing that hospital admission has a preventive eﬀect.

Repeated hospitalization for suicidal threats and attempts can also be counter-productive,
since it interferes with out-patient treatment, and makes it impossible for patients to remain in the
workplace [26–28]. It can also lead to a kind of “regression”, with an increase of symptoms based on
the behavioral reinforcement of suicidal behavior. Linehan [6] recommends not admitting patients for
suicidality beyond an overnight hold in a crisis.

5. Evidence-Based Treatments for BPD

We now know that well-structured ambulatory treatment, using methods speciﬁcally developed
for BPD, is an eﬀective intervention for most BPD patients. The most extensively investigated treatment
is dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) [6], whose eﬃcacy has been conﬁrmed by randomized clinical
trials [29,30]. The main outcomes are reductions in overdoses, in emergency room visits for suicidality,
reduced frequency of self-harm, and reduced hospital admissions. DBT speciﬁcally aims to modify the
regulation of emotion, teaching patients how to regulate negative emotions in ways other than cutting
or overdosing [6].

Several other psychotherapy methods have also been tested in randomized clinical trials:
mentalization-based therapy [31,32]; transference-focused psychotherapy [33]; schema-focused
therapy [34]; and standard cognitive therapy [35].

All these methods target the aﬀective instability (emotion dysregulation) that characterizes
BPD [6,36], as well as impulsivity [37]. Emotion dysregulation accompanied by a lack of control
over impulses makes patients more likely to turn to suicidal actions, and the frequency of suicide
attempts is strongly related to these traits [10]. Thus, all methods of psychotherapy attempt to teach
patients to stand outside their emotions, to self-reﬂect before acting on them, and to develop a better
understanding of interpersonal conﬂict.

By and large, all psychological treatments that are well-structured and speciﬁcally designed
for BPD patients are superior to standard clinical management. A Cochrane report [38] as well as a
systematic meta-analysis [39] have summarized this evidence, supporting the conclusion that speciﬁc
forms of psychotherapy for BPD are eﬃcacious. These methods are usually provided in out-patient
settings, and do not require hospital admission. As noted by Zanarini [40], BPD patients need to “get a
life”, which means therapists must work actively to involve them with life goals, such as career and
social networks.

In contrast, the eﬃcacy of pharmacological agents in BPD is not well established. No clinical trials
have documented remission of the disorder with successful drug treatment, and a Cochrane report did
not ﬁnd suﬃcient evidence to prescribe any drug for patients with BPD [41]. Recent research has also
shown that anticonvulsant mood stabilizers are not eﬃcacious [42]. There is some evidence for the use
of antipsychotics for short periods [43]. A similar conclusion has been reached by the UK National
Institute on Clinical Excellence [44]. Unfortunately, it has long been observed that most BPD patients
are often on multiple medications, including antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and/or neuroleptics [22],
and this practice does not seem to have changed. These interventions do not require hospital admission.
There is also no evidence that pharmacological regimes are eﬀective for suicide prevention.

6. Implications for Practice

One of the most unique aspects of BPD is chronic suicidal ideation [27]. Patients with mood
disorders can be suicidal when depressed, but usually put these ideas aside when they go into remission.
In contrast, BPD patients may consider suicide on a daily basis for months to years, and only go into
remission much later. Suicidal ideas will vary in intensity over time, waxing when life events are
stressful, and waning when they are not.

Yet by themselves, suicidal thoughts are too common to be useful in predicting suicidal actions.
But while patients with suicidal behaviors have a statistically higher risk, one cannot predict who
is most likely to die by suicide. Deaths by suicide are rare events relative to attempts, which is
why large-scale follow-up studies have found that algorithms based on risk factors fail to predict
who will die by suicide [45,46]. The problem is false positives (patients who ﬁt a proﬁle but never
kill themselves).

Most patients with BPD, despite having suicidal thoughts for long periods of time and multiple
suicide attempts, never kill themselves. Thus, the level of alarm created by patients with BPD who
present in clinics and ERs with suicidal ideas is not necessarily justiﬁed, even when threats are dramatic

Medicina 2019, 55, 223

or blood-curdling. Clinicians need to work on making these patents more functional, and should not
be distracted from these therapeutic tasks by suicidality.

Needless to say, chronic suicidality can be draining for therapists, and no one wants to lose a
patient in this way. Yet in BPD, suicidality “goes with the territory” [47], and most patients cannot be
treated without accepting a calculated risk [48]. Moreover, recommending ER visits and hospitalization
reinforces the very behaviors they are designed to treat [6].

Hospitalization has not been supported by evidence, and when suicidality is chronic, admission
to hospital provides only temporary relief; most patients continue to have suicidal ideas after discharge.
While some research describes intensive treatment in hospital [49], similar programs could be oﬀered
on an out-patient basis. To avoid the harm of repetitive admissions, one might prefer day treatment,
which oﬀers the advantages of admission (intensive treatment by an experienced team) without its
disadvantages, and has some supporting evidence for its eﬃcacy [31]. Unfortunately, day programs
usually have waiting lists and are not useful in a crisis.

In practice, BPD patients are commonly held in ERs (or admitted to wards) when they threaten
suicide, cut themselves, or overdose. These choices are partly determined by a fear of litigation.
However, to minimize the risk of lawsuits, clinicians can ensure careful record keeping, consult
frequently with colleagues, and get families involved early on in treatment [50].

Based on current evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that we should treat suicidal patients with
BPD on an out-patient basis using specialized forms of psychotherapy. Psychopharmacology remains
adjunctive and optional. Hospital admission can be justiﬁed by either a near-fatal attempt (requiring a
re-evaluation), or a micro-psychotic episode (requiring pharmacological intervention) [27]. Since we
have no ﬁrm evidence that death by suicide in BPD can be prevented, we should focus on providing
existing evidence-based psychological treatments designed for this challenging population.
