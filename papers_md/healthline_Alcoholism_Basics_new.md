Alcohol use disorder is a medical and mental health condition that involves being unable to stop or reduce alcohol use despite it having negative consequences on life and daily functioning. AUD may negatively affect:

- relationships with friends, family, coworkers, and acquaintances

- physical and mental health

Alcohol use disorder can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms and impact.

If you’re experiencing (or a loved one is experiencing) alcohol use disorder, know that help is available.

### Why aren’t the terms “alcohol abuse” and “alcoholism” used anymore?


Alcohol use disorder has been known by a variety of terms, including alcohol abuse and alcoholism. Today, it’s referred to as alcohol use disorder.

Outdated terms can contribute stigma and judgment, and imply that it is a choice a person is making. While use of a substance may be voluntary at first, substance use disordercan impaira person’s judgment, decision making, memory, and behavior control over time.

Alcohol use disorder is a medical and mental health condition with identifiable causes and risk factors. The change in terminology reflects this. Like many other health conditions, substance use disorder disrupts the usual functioning of organs in the body, has serious harmful effects, and may be preventable and treatable.


## What are the symptoms of alcohol use disorder?


Alcohol use, including heavy or habitual alcohol use, may not necessarily be alcohol use disorder.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR), to receive a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, a person has to have at least two of the following symptoms within 12 months:

- Consuming alcohol in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended

- Having a persistent desire or making unsuccessful efforts to reduce or manage alcohol use

- Spending “a great deal of time” on activities needed to obtain alcohol, use alcohol, or recover from its effects

- Craving alcohol, or having a strong urge to use alcohol

- Repeated alcohol use resulting in failure to fulfill major obligations at work, school, or home

- Continuing alcohol use despite persistent or recurrent social or relationship problems caused or exacerbated by its effects

- Giving up or reducing important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of alcohol use

- Repeatedly using alcohol in situations in which it is physically hazardous

- Continuing to use alcohol despite knowledge of having a persistent or repeated physical or psychological problem likely to have been caused or worsened by alcohol

- Having alcohol tolerance, which means having either:A need for significantly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or the desired effectA significantly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol

- A need for significantly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or the desired effect

- A significantly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol

- Experiencing withdrawal, which may include either:Experiencingalcohol withdrawal syndromeUsing alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as abenzodiazepine) to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms

- Experiencingalcohol withdrawal syndrome

- Using alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as abenzodiazepine) to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms

The number of symptoms you have determines the severity:

- Mild:2 to 3 symptoms

- Moderate:4 to 5

- Severe:6 or more


## What are the stages of alcohol use disorder?


Alcohol use disorder typicallydevelops in stages. Theseinclude:

- Stage 1 or binge/intoxication stage:During this stage, the brain begins to link the pleasurable and rewarding experience of alcohol with cues. This develops and strengthens alcohol use as a habit.

- Stage 2 or withdrawal/negative effect stage:During this stage, the person feels they need alcohol use to relieve discomfort and emotional pain.

- Stage 3 or preoccupation/anticipation stage:During this stage, a person develops deficits in their executive functioning, which is the part of the brain responsible for judgment and decision making.


## What causes alcohol use disorder?


Alcohol use disorder develops over time from habitual drinking.

Habitual drinking causes changes in the brain that can make it harder to stop regular alcohol use.

Some factors may increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder. Thesecan include:

- young age at first alcohol use

- history of trauma, including physical, sexual, or emotional abuse

- mental health conditions, including anxiety anddepression

- family historyof substance misuse or substance use disorder,especially in a parent

- history of using other substances

- loneliness and bereavement

- engaging in binge drinking

The National institutes of Health (NIH) definesbinge drinkingas a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to0.08%(or 0.08 grams of alcohol per deciliter) or higher. This typically corresponds to drinking in two hours or less:

- 5 of more drinks for males

- 4 or more drinks for females

The threshold is lower in females because they typically have proportionally less water in their bodies. There isn’t data available on determining BAC in people outside of the gender binary.


## What are the complications of alcohol use disorder?


Alcohol use, especially the habitual and heavy alcohol use associated with alcohol use disorder, can have negative health effects.

Possible complications can include:

- withdrawal symptoms when not drinking, including shaking, nausea, and vomiting

- tremors(involuntary shaking) the morning after drinking

- lapses in memory (blacking out) oralcohol-related dementia

- alcohol-induced liver damage, includinghepatitisorcirrhosis

- alcohol-related ketoacidosis, which affects your body’s ability to produce insulin

- erectile dysfunction

- pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas

- traumatic injuries related to alcohol use


## Considering your relationship with alcohol use


Sometimes it can be hard to find the line between alcohol use and misuse. The following questions may be helpful in considering your relationship with alcohol use.

- Do you need to drink increasingly more over time to feel the effects of alcohol?

- Do you feel guilt about your drinking habits?

- Do you becomeirritable or violent when you’re drinking?

- Do you have problems at school or work because of drinking?

- Do you think it might be better if you reduced your alcohol use?

If you would like to reduce your alcohol use but aren’t sure where to get started, it’s best to talk with a healthcare professional. Engaging in heavy, habitual alcohol use may make withdrawal symptoms likely if you stop suddenly. Some of these symptoms can be dangerous. A doctor can help assess your situation and recommend treatment to reduce these symptoms.

TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)define heavy drinking as:

- more than eight drinks per week for females

- more than 15 drinks per week for males

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines heavy alcohol use as binge drinking onfiveor more days in the past month.


## Do you need a professional diagnosis to get help?


You don’t need a professional diagnosis to get help for alcohol use disorder.

However, a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder may provide access to additional resources to support your recovery and care, which may include:

- support in reducing or stopping alcohol use

- medical treatment for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, if needed

- monitoring your overall health

- treatment for alcohol-related health conditions

A health professional may use a questionnaire that assesses alcohol use disorder to help diagnose alcohol use disorder.

Typically, a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder doesn’t require a diagnostic test. However, a doctor may order blood work to check your liver function if you have symptoms of liver disease.


## How is alcohol use disorder treated?


Treatment for alcohol use disorder usually involves support and medical care to help you reduce your intake of alcohol or stop drinking altogether.

Treatment may occur in stages and can include:

- Detoxification:This involves stopping alcohol use and taking steps to prevent or manage withdrawal syndrome, if needed. It’s usually recommended to completealcohol detoxificationwith medical supervision.

- Medications:Medications can limit the pleasurable and rewarding effects of alcohol to help you reduce your alcohol use.

- Behavioral treatment:Support groupsand 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) can support and reinforce your recovery from alcohol use disorder.

- Medical treatment:Doctors help treat health problems associated with alcohol use disorder.

- Therapy or counseling:Talk therapy, likecognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for addiction, can help you understand and address any emotional issues or history that may contribute to developing alcohol use disorder.

Medications for alcohol use disordermay include:

- naltrexone (ReVia), which blocks certain receptors in the brain associated with the pleasurable response to consuming alcohol; in combination with counseling,naltrexonemay help decrease the craving for alcohol

- acamprosate, a medication that can help re-establish the brain’s original chemical state before alcohol dependence

- disulfiram (Antabuse), a drug that causes physical discomfort (such as nausea, vomiting, and headaches) whenever the person consumes alcohol

- topiramate (Topamax), adrugthat can help to decrease the rewarding effects of alcohol use; however, this use is consideredoff-label drug use

You may need to seek treatment at an inpatient facility if youralcohol use disorderis severe. These facilities provide 24-hour care as you detox from alcohol.

Once you’re well enough to return home, you usually continue treatment on an outpatient basis.

Recovery from alcohol use disorder may not be linear. But help is available.


## What is alcohol withdrawal syndrome?


Stopping or reducing heavy alcohol use suddenly and without medical support can result inwithdrawal syndrome. It is a collection of symptoms that develop when the central nervous system attempts to adapt to the lack of alcohol after becoming habituated to it.

Doctors may treat withdrawal syndrome with medication or supportive care and monitoring. This may include medications likebenzodiazepinesorbarbiturates(off-label), which require close monitoring and reassessment.

Alcohol withdrawal can cause symptoms that may include:

- nausea and vomiting

- increased heart rate

- irritability and confusion

- high blood pressure

- excessive sweating

Some people may experience a more serious type of withdrawal syndrome calleddelirium tremens (DT). It can be life threatening. It may include more severe forms of the above symptoms as well as:

- visual hallucinations, or seeing images that don’t exist

- tactile hallucinations, such as having a sense of itching, burning, or numbness that isn’t occurring

- auditory hallucinations, or hearing sounds that don’t exist
