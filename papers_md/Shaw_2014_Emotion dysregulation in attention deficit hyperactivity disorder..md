Abstract

It has long been recognized that many individuals with ADHD also have difficulties with emotion 
regulation but lack of consensus on how to conceptualize this clinically challenging domain 
renders a review timely. The authors examine the current literature using both quantitative and 
qualitative methods. Three key findings emerge. First, emotion dysregulation is prevalent in 
ADHD throughout the lifespan and is a major contributor to impairment. Second, emotion 
dysregulation in ADHD may arise from deficits in orienting towards, recognizing and/or 
allocating attention to emotional stimuli; these deficits that implicate dysfunction within a striato-
amygdalo-medial prefrontal cortical network. Third, while current treatments for ADHD often 
also ameliorate emotion dysregulation, a focus on this combination of symptoms reframes clinical 
questions and could stimulate novel therapeutic approaches. Three models to explain the overlap 
between emotion dysregulation and ADHD are considered: emotion dysregulation and ADHD are 
correlated but distinct dimensions; emotion dysregulation is a core, diagnostic feature of ADHD; 
and the combination constitutes a nosological entity, distinct from both ADHD and emotion 
dysreguation alone. The differing predictions from each model can guide future research into this 
much-neglected population.

Introduction

It has long been recognized that emotion dysregulation is common in individuals with 
neurodevelopmental disorders, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). 
Indeed, in the early conceptualization of ADHD as reflecting ‘minimal brain damage’, 
emotion dysregulation was placed above inattention among the cardinal symptoms (1). Only 
by DSM-III did emotional symptoms became an ‘associated feature’ rather than a diagnostic 
criterion of ADHD. Renewed interest in this overlap makes a review timely. Here, we 
consider the overlap of emotion dysregulation with ADHD, focusing on prevalence, 
pathophysiology and treatment.

In line with previous theorists, we define emotion regulation as an individual's ability to 
modify an emotional state so as to promote adaptive, goal-oriented behaviors (2). It 
encompasses the processes that allow the individual flexibly to select, attend to, and appraise 
emotionally arousing stimuli. These processes trigger behavioral and physiological 
responses that can be modulated in line with goals. Emotion dysregulation arises when these 
adaptive processes are impaired, leading to behavior that defeats the individual's interests. 
We define it as encompassing; emotional expressions and experiences that are excessive in 
relation to social norms and context-inappropriate; rapid, poorly controlled shifts in emotion 
(‘lability’); and the anomalous allocation of attention and to emotional stimuli. Here, we 
focus on the clinical expression of emotional dysregulation as irritability, which is often 
linked with reactive aggression and temper outbursts (3-5).

Emotion dysregulation is a dimensional trait that is not unique to ADHD; rather, it undercuts 
the traditional divide between internalizing and externalizing diagnoses and indeed may 
partly explain their high correlation (6). For example, a study which contrasted 105 irritable, 
emotionally dysregulated children with ADHD against 395 non-irritable ADHD children 
found increased rates not only of Oppositional Defiant Disorder but also Depression and 
Dysthymia (7).

Emotion dysregulation is also not synonymous with any single DSM-5 disorder. For 
example, of the three symptoms clusters in Oppositional Defiant Disorder-angry/irritable 
mood, defiant behavior and vindictiveness- only the first plausibly reflects dysregulated 
emotions (8). In its extreme form, emotion dysregulation is likely to emerge as a major 
etiological factor behind the frequent, severe temper outbursts and irritability of the new 
DSM-5 diagnosis, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder. However, emotion 
dysregulation is a dimensional entity, not a categorical diagnosis, and here we consider the 
full spectrum of emotion dysregulation within ADHD, not just extremes. We thus include 
individuals with emotion dysregulation who do not meet criteria for any DSM diagnoses 
beyond ADHD.

We focus on emotion dysregulation itself, rather than on diagnoses that may include 
emotion dysregulation and be comorbid with ADHD. We do so because it is a simpler 
symptom construct that is familiar to clinicians and, consistent with the Research Domain 
Criteria initiative, may be more readily tied to underlying neurobiological mechanisms.

Methods

We conducted a literature search for relevant articles published before January 1st 2013 
(details in Supplementary Material). Studies were categorized according to topic: (1) 
prevalence; (2) pathophysiology; and (3) treatment. Quantitative syntheses using pooled 
effect sizes were possible for studies of three related literatures: aggressive behavior (9-20), 
emotion recognition (12, 21-36) and delay aversion (35, 37-50). Remaining studies were 
reviewed qualitatively.

Section 1: Prevalence

Childhood—Most epidemiological research has focused on children and finds a strong 
association between ADHD and emotion dysregulation (35, 51-56)(Table 1). A population 
study of 5326 youth found mood lability in 38% of children with ADHD, a ten-fold increase 
over population rates (51). Elevated rates were found in non-comorbid ADHD children and 
equaled the rates seen in children with non-comorbid Oppositional Defiant Disorder. 
Research on the Child Behavior Checklist ‘dysregulation profile’ based on parent-reported 
problems with mood and aggression in youth who also have attention problems, shows 
community rates of 1-5%, compatible with high rates of emotion dysregulation among those 
likely to have ADHD (57). Clinic-based studies in youth with ADHD report similar 
prevalence estimates of emotion dysregulation of between 24% to 50%.

Reactive aggression may reflect emotion dysregulation (5). Our meta-analysis found 
consistent elevation in aggressive behavior in ADHD versus non-ADHD populations, 
associated with a large effect size (1.92, CI 0.95 to 2.89) - Figure 1A. In the general 
population, the correlation is higher between aggression and hyperactivity-impulsivity 
(0.60-0.83) than between aggression and inattention (0.20-0.56) (6). In clinics emotion 
dysregulation is commonly associated with either symptom domain (52, 56).

Importantly, behaviors reflecting emotion dysregulation can be reliably provoked among 
those with ADHD using paradigms that induce frustration (Supplemental Table 1). Children 
with ADHD show more negative affect and temper outbursts than comparison subjects 
during challenging tasks. This consistency is notable as different paradigms and behavioral 
measures were employed.

Infancy and early childhood—Modest correlations (0.10-0.37) are reported between 
infantile temperamental characteristics such as being fussy, angry, or difficult to control, and 
ADHD arising later in childhood (58-62) (Figure 2 and Supplemental Table 2). A 
longitudinal study of 7,140 children, found that while temperamental emotionality at age 3 
predicted comorbid ADHD and internalizing disorders at age 7, activity level predicted 
comorbid ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (63). A second longitudinal study 
found that infants who developed hyperactive symptoms alone did not differ

temperamentally from typical infants, whereas those who ultimately developed both ADHD 
and aggressive symptoms were uncooperative and irritable from infancy onwards (64). In 
short, a difficult early temperament with prominent negative emotionality is modestly linked 
with later ADHD combined with emotion dysregulation.

Longitudinal studies—Most studies following children with ADHD into adulthood have 
not considered emotion dysregulation per se but focused on DSM-IV diagnoses and find 
increased rates of adult disruptive and antisocial disorders and, less consistently, mood and 
anxiety disorders (65). One study defined emotion dysregulation as a moderate elevation 
(>1SD and <2SDs) on the combined Child Behavior Checklist subscales of Attention 
Problems, Aggressive Behavior and Anxious/Depressed subscales (66). Such emotion 
dysregulation in 79 children with ADHD was associated four years later with more 
psychiatric comorbidities, greater social impairment and ADHD persistence, compared to 98 
subjects with ADHD without emotion dysregulation and 204 controls. A population-based 
study of 2076 children found that those matching the Child Behavior Checklist 
‘dysregulation profile’, had increased rates of anxiety disorders and disruptive behavior 
disorders in adulthood compared to non-dysregulated children (67).

Adult studies—Earlier concepts of adult ADHD included emotion dysregulation as a 
defining feature (68). This has been supported to some extent by recent clinic-based studies 
reporting impairing emotion dysregulation in between 34-70% of adults with ADHD, 
although population based studies are needed (69-73)–Table 1. Aggressive behaviors are 
also prominent. In a population study contrasting 950 adults with diagnosed or likely ADHD 
against 20,000 unaffected adults, those with ADHD had higher self-ratings of interpersonal 
conflict and negative, conflictual social ties (69). Other cross-sectional studies have 
compared of adults who have remitted from their childhood ADHD against those who have 
not. In such a comparison, 55 adults with persistent ADHD showed higher rates of emotion 
dysregulation (42-72%, depending on specific symptoms) than 80 adults with remitted 
ADHD (23-45%), although both groups differed from healthy subjects (70). This suggests a 
degree of developmental coherence: as symptoms of ADHD improve, so may emotion 
dysregulation.

Impairment—The combination of ADHD and emotion dysregulation represents a major 
source of impairment. In a study of 1,500 children, emotional problems had a greater impact 
than hyperactivity and inattention on well-being and self-esteem (74). Individuals with 
ADHD and emotion dysregulation were significantly more impaired in peer relationships, 
family life, occupational attainment and academic performance than those with ADHD 
alone (75) and this held after controlling for comorbid disorders, including Oppositional 
Defiant Disorder (76).

In summary, emotion dysregulation is found in around 25-45% of children and between 
30-70% of adults with ADHD. It represents a major source of impairment and presages a 
poor clinical outcome.

Section 2: Pathophysiology

We now consider psychological and neural processes that might underpin the overlap 
between ADHD and emotion dysregulation. Informed by recent models, we draw a 
distinction between (1) ‘bottom-up’ processes that support or influence emotion regulation 
and (2) ‘top-down’ processes, such as the allocation of attention to emotionally arousing 
stimuli (77, 78). Most studies reviewed this section have either excluded individuals with 
comorbid diagnoses including Oppositional Defiant Disorder or controlled for these 
comorbidities, ensuring the anomalies pertain to ADHD per se rather than other disorders 
(Table 2).

‘Bottom-up’ psychological mechanisms—We consider two processes affecting 
emotion regulation: orienting to emotionally salient stimuli and the evaluation of signals for 
reward. In order for emotion to be regulated, posterior attention systems must both detect 
salient stimuli and signal that control is needed (77, 79). Evidence suggests anomalies in 
early orienting to emotional stimuli in ADHD. In healthy individuals, affectively charged 
stimuli receive enhanced early sensory encoding, detectable by electrophysiological 
markers. Two studies found that this effect is reduced in adults with ADHD when viewing 
positive, though not negative stimuli (80, 81); this would be expected to cause over-
perception of negative stimuli. These studies further linked these early processing deficits 
with self-rated emotional lability. Additionally, whereas the startle reflex is typically 
accentuated by precursive positive and attenuated by negative stimuli, this effect is lost in 
adults with ADHD, further evidence of abnormal early processing of emotional stimuli in 
ADHD (82). Likewise, the rapid and accurate recognition of emotions in human faces or 
voices is central to well-regulated behavior; emotional misperception is linked with aberrant 
emotional responses and misperception can itself result from emotion dysregulation (83, 84). 
Studies on emotion labeling find moderate impairments in ADHD, our meta-analysis giving 
an effect size of 0.65 (CI 0.48 to 0.81)–Figure 1B.

The evaluation of emotionally salient stimuli has also been studied in relation to the 
evaluation of signals for potential reward. A preference for small, immediate rewards over 
larger, delayed ones, even when such choice defeats one's own goals and desires, is held to 
be a hallmark of impulsivity, reflecting an aversion to delayed reward (85, 86). Our meta-
analysis found that ADHD was also moderately associated with this preference (effect size 
of 0.6, CI 0.4 to 0.79), albeit with considerable heterogeneity in results (35, 37) (–Figure 1C. 
This style of reward processing can be construed as a contributor to emotion dysregulation 
as it may reflect anomalous activity in limbic regions pivotal in emotion processing. 
Equally, the preference for immediate, small rewards might also reflect failures in ‘top-
down’ regulatory mechanisms such as the ability to hold longer-term goals in mind, or to 
exert cognitive control to suppress the arousing value of immediate incentives (78, 87, 88). 
Thus, anomalies in reward evaluation provides further, albeit indirect, evidence for 
dysregulation of emotion systems in ADHD.

‘Top-down’ regulatory processes—Parasympathetic response is considered one gauge 
of regulatory functioning (89). In typically developing children, autonomic nervous system 
function tracks the valence of emotional stimuli and task demands, with greater top down

regulatory activity when stimuli are negative rather than positive (89). In children with 
ADHD this ability to adjust top down regulation in response to different emotional stimuli 
was partially lost, based on physiological indicators of regulation.

Another way to assess the recruitment of regulatory resources is to consider the allocation of 
attention itself to emotional stimuli. Just as emotion regulation requires the ability to recruit 
autonomic responses, it also relies on the ability to direct attention towards or away from 
emotional stimuli so as to maintain emotional homeostasis or maintain focus on a goal (90). 
This ability can be assessed by incorporating an affective dimension into a cognitive 
paradigm. For example, in the emotional Stroop task, individuals must deflect attention 
away from the emotional properties, such as emotional expression, and attend to a non-
emotional feature, such as eye color. This manipulation exacerbates the performance deficits 
already evident in ADHD suggesting that performance drops off more steeply than it does in 
typical individuals under emotional challenge (91, 92).

Finally, given that ADHD is associated with poor higher order cognitive control even in the 
absence of emotionally salient stimuli, what role does poor cognitive control play in emotion 
dysregulation in ADHD? Evidence suggests a modest connection but not isomorphism. For 
example, in 49 boys with and without ADHD, cognitive control, indexed by response 
inhibition, accounted for 11% of the variance in ‘dysregulated’ behavior during a frustrating 
task (93). A larger study of 424 children with ADHD and their siblings found that, while a 
range of neuropsychological variables correlated with emotional lability this link was not 
direct but mediated almost entirely by the severity of ADHD symptoms (37).

In summary, emotion dysregulation in ADHD may arise from deficits at multiple levels. 
These range from abnormal early orienting to emotional stimuli, particularly with regard to 
negative stimuli and reward valuation through an inability to recruit top-down regulatory 
effort or attention in response to emotional stimuli. Meantime, deficits in cognitive 
processes, including working memory and response inhibition may contribute to emotion 
dysregulation, but they do not seem to alone explain its presence in ADHD.

Neural mechanisms: Here, we again employ the division between regions mediating 
‘bottom-up’ responses to emotional stimuli - specifically the amygdala, ventral striatum and 
orbitofrontal cortex- and ‘top-down’, cortical regions controlling the allocation of attentional 
resources in emotionally arousing contexts (77, 94). In ADHD, functional imaging studies 
have yielded disparate findings, possibly because of differences in tasks, sample 
characteristics and limited power to detect effects in smaller studies but nonetheless some 
themes emerge- Table 2 and Figure 3.

Amygdala activation during emotion processing has received some research attention in 
ADHD. The larger studies find amygdala hyperactivation in ADHD, during both the 
subliminal perception of fearful expressions and while subjects rated their fear of neutral 
faces, although results are mixed (24, 29, 95-98)-Table 2 and Supplemental Material. 
Amygdala hyperactivation has also been reported in ADHD during the processing of 
delayed rewards, perhaps consistent with the delay aversion found in some behavioral 
studies (38, 99-101). Deficits in early processing of visual emotional stimuli and in the

modulation of the startle reflex, described above, also suggest amygdala dysfunction in 
ADHD. These functional deficits align with reports of amygdala structural abnormalities in 
ADHD, including surface morphology and dopamine receptor density (102).

The orbitofrontal cortex, which has rich interconnections with the amygdala, thalamus and 
multiple cortical regions, is pivotal in emotion regulation and reward representations (77, 
103). Some data suggest orbitofrontal anatomic anomalies (104) and abnormal activation 
during the anticipation and receipt of rewards in ADHD. There is also decreased 
connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, reflected in a loss of the typical 
correlation between the volumes of these structures (102).

The ventral striatum is the third important ‘hub’ in the ‘bottom-up’ circuitry, partly by virtue 
of its role in mediating positive affect and reward processing (105). Functional 
neuroimaging studies find reduced ventral striatum responsiveness in ADHD during the 
anticipation (and receipt) of rewards, thus contributing to aversion to delay- Table 2. By 
examining brain activity at rest, two groups have reported in ADHD both increased 
functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal/ventromedial 
prefrontal cortex and decreased connectivity between these regions and cortical attentional 
control regions (106, 107). Thus evidence suggests dysfunction in a network encompassing 
the amygdala, ventral striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex that processes emotional stimuli and 
is implicated in emotion regulation.

With regard to cortical regions, in healthy subjects the addition of an emotional dimension to 
cognitive tasks usually boosts ‘top-down’ prefrontal cortical activation (particularly in 
ventrolateral, medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortical regions) and diminishes 
subcortical activity (77). These patterns are partly lost in ADHD. Specifically, when 
negative stimuli are added to a working memory task, performance deficits in ADHD are 
associated with hypoactivation in prefrontal ‘control’ regions, including ventrolateral, 
orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices. However, when positive stimuli are used, 
ADHD subjects show hyperactivation in these regions (91). Similarly, two independent 
studies using the emotional Stroop task found hypoactivation in ADHD in right medial and 
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex while processing negative distractors but hyperactivation in 
left medial prefrontal cortex while processing positive distractors (92, 108). Such work 
represents the first stage in charting the neural basis of dysregulated attentional control in 
ADHD in the presence of emotional stimuli.

In summary, emotion dysregulation in ADHD implicates dysfunction in the amygdala, 
ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex, which could be regarded as the ‘bottom-up’ 
contributor. Regions at the interface of cognition and emotion (medial and ventrolateral 
prefrontal cortex) may underpin the abnormal allocation of attention to emotional stimuli 
and could thus be regarded as the major ‘top-down’ contributor to emotion dysregulation 
within ADHD (Figure 2). Higher cortical centers involved in motor control (supplementary 
motor areas, motor cortex), monitoring for salient stimuli (temporoparietal junction, frontal 
operculum) and in shifting attention flexibly (frontal eye fields, intraparietal sulcus) may 
play a more indirect role (109). The exact balance of symptoms stemming from ADHD and 
emotion dysregulation within an individual may depend on the degree to which each neural

network or level is compromised. We predict that dysfunction at the cortical nexus between 
cognition and emotion (medial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) would be strongly 
associated with symptoms of both ADHD and emotion dysregulation. If however, an 
individual has dysfunction that is more focused in ‘higher’ more lateral prefrontal/parietal 
cortical regions, then in that individual symptoms of ADHD such as inattention would 
predominate over emotion dysregulation. Conversely, an individual with predominately 
(para) limbic dysfunction may exhibit mainly symptoms stemming from emotion 
dysregulation.

Etiological factors: It has been proposed that the combination of ADHD and emotion 
dysregulation defines a distinct genetic group. In support, one group found that the siblings 
of probands with both ADHD and emotion dysregulation also had significantly elevated 
rates of this combination, although this has not been replicated (52, 110, 111). The Child 
Behavior Checklist defined dysregulation profile is highly heritable (67%) (112) and studies 
have suggested candidate genes (113). Turning to environmental factors, high levels of 
parental criticism and hostility have been linked both with the development of conduct 
problems in children with ADHD, and with the development of childhood ADHD in 
preschoolers with behavioral problems (114, 115). A plausible hypothesis is that failures of 
parental emotion regulation, reflected by high expressed hostility contribute to the 
development of emotion dysregulation in children with ADHD.

Section 3: Treatment

The management of emotion dysregulation within ADHD presents formidable therapeutic 
challenges partly because clinical trials in ADHD either fail to assess change in emotion 
regulation or do so as a secondary outcome. Psychostimulants are highly effective in treating 
Oppositional Defiant Disorder comorbid with ADHD (meta-analyses given at http://
www.nice.org.uk/CG72). However evidence for psychostimulant efficacy on emotion 
dysregulation within ADHD is more limited (Supplemental Table 3). Two randomized, 
placebo-controlled studies in children with ADHD found psychostimulants reduced 
emotional lability and irritability. In adults, several studies find that the beneficial effects of 
psychostimulants on emotion dysregulation parallel the improvement seen in hyperactivity 
and impulsivity. However, two randomized controlled trials comparing amphetamine against 
placebo found no beneficial medication impact on a broad range of emotional problems and 
some studies find amphetamine preparations increase irritability and lability (116).

Among individuals with ADHD, psychostimulants also improve emotion recognition (80), 
and normalize both the startle modulation by affective stimuli (82) and performance on the 
emotional Stroop task (92). This behavioral normalization is accompanied by normalization 
of underlying neural activity (80, 82, 92).

Among the non-stimulant treatments, improvement of emotion regulation on atomoxetine 
paralleled improvement in core symptoms of ADHD among adults (71). Mood stabilizers 
have yielded mixed results. A trial of lithium for children with severe mood dysregulation, 
most of whom had ADHD, was negative (117). However, a comparison of behavior therapy 
combined with either divalproex or stimulants found that the use of divalproex was more

efficacious in children with severe aggressive behavior, most of whom also had ADHD 
(118). A further study found that among 30 children with ADHD whose aggression did not 
respond to open-label psychostimulant treatment and behavioral therapy, the addition of 
divalproex resulted in significantly higher rates of remission compared to placebo (119). The 
use of atypical antipsychotic medications for the combination of ADHD, emotion 
dysregulation and aggression still lacks a clear evidence base.

While cognitive and behavioral psychotherapies have limited impact on core symptoms of 
ADHD, there is preliminary evidence that interventions which specifically target emotion 
dysregulation are efficacious, which we consider as a future direction for research (120, 
121).

The available literature suggests the following treatment approach. Psychostimulant 
treatment of the core symptoms of ADHD is often linked to a beneficial effect on emotion 
dysregulation and should be considered the first line of treatment. Atomoxetine also appears 
effective for symptoms of ADHD and emotion dysregulation. Adjunctive behavioral 
modification in children is reasonable as this combination is effective in those with mixed 
internalizing and externalizing symptoms, many of whom will be emotionally dysregulated 
(51, 122). Group based psychotherapy in adults with ADHD which bolster emotion 
regulation skills show promise but require replication (121). Lacking an evidence base for 
second-line pharmacological approaches to emotion dysregulation in ADHD, treatment will 
largely be guided by the presence of comorbid illnesses. For example, for the patient with 
ADHD and depression, in whom emotion dysregulation is often prominent, serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors combined with psychostimulants is reasonable (123).

Section 4: Conceptual models

We now discuss three models, whose proponents can be characterized as ‘lumpers’, who 
view emotion dysregulation as an integral component of ADHD; ‘splitters’, who view the 
combination as defining a distinct entity; and ‘diplomats’ who view symptoms of ADHD 
and emotion dysregulation as correlated but ultimately dissociable dimensions (Table 3). 
Current evidence is insufficient to choose decisively among these models, partly because 
few studies have been designed to address specifically the question of why emotion 
dysregulation is so prominent in ADHD. However, this framework generates testable 
hypotheses that stimulate future research.

The first model posits that emotion dysregulation is a core, defining feature of ADHD that is 
as central to the disorder as hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention and harks back to 
earlier conceptualizations of ADHD (124). Emotion dysregulation is seen as an expression 
of the same neurocognitive deficits that underpin other symptoms of ADHD, and Occam's 
razor dictates that it is unnecessary to invoke additional emotional processing deficits. The 
model is parsimonious and recognizes the close associations between cognitive and 
emotional regulation systems. However, as noted above, the overlap between ADHD and 
emotion dysregulation is far from complete: many with ADHD do not show impairing levels 
of emotion dysregulation (55-75% of children and between 30-70% of adults with ADHD). 
Additionally, the evidence for widespread (para) limbic dysfunction in ADHD, and 
associated deficits in emotional processes, might argue against a reductionist model of

emotion dysregulation in ADHD as another expression of purely cortico-striatal-cerebellar 
dysfunction. This model also predicts that treatments that ameliorate core symptoms would 
have an almost equal impact on emotion dysregulation, which seems to occur in adulthood, 
but less clearly in childhood.

The second model holds that the combination of ADHD and emotion dysregulation defines a 
distinct entity (110, 111). This model has been generated largely on the basis of genetic 
findings of familial co-segregation of ADHD and emotion dysregulation, although evidence 
on this point is mixed (52, 110). This model could imply both a distinct neurocognitive 
etiology and clinical course for those with the combination of ADHD and emotion 
dysregulation, a possibility that warrants further testing.

The third model holds that symptoms of ADHD and emotion dysregulation are distinct but 
correlated dimensions, each underpinned by partly overlapping but dissociable 
neurocognitive deficits. This model has much in common with the concept of multiple but 
overlapping pathways to ADHD (94, 109). This model is supported by the significant but 
modest correlations between symptoms of ADHD and emotion dysregulation reviewed 
earlier; the symptom domains commonly co-exist but are far from completely overlapping. 
Similarly, modest correlations have been reported between deficits in emotional processes –
such as deficits in emotion recognition and frustration tolerance- and the executive 
dysfunction often held to be a core feature of the disorder (35, 37). Longitudinal data 
reviewed earlier also suggest modest links between the course of ADHD symptoms and 
emotion dysregulation in early childhood, and perhaps in adulthood, consistent with a model 
of correlated, but distinct symptom dimensions.

Future research directions

Phenomenology and pathophysiology

Refinement of the phenotype is needed, as emotion dysregulation in individuals with ADHD 
is likely to have a number of clinically important components, such as irritability and mood 
lability (4, 51). It will be important to operationalize each component, develop consensus 
measurement techniques, and perform longitudinal studies to define how the developmental 
trajectories of the components interact with each other and with the dimensions of ADHD. 
Pathophysiological studies should include individuals lying along the spectrum of emotion 
regulation abilities, but perhaps oversample those most at clinical need, lying at the extreme 
of dysregulation. Such work would allow direct links to be made between emotional 
dysregulation in ADHD and the underlying neural anomalies- a link that has been made in 
relatively few studies.

Future functional imaging studies should include a broad range of tasks of emotion 
regulation, defining the neural bases of the ability to reinterpret the meaning of emotional 
stimuli, the adaptive suppression of ongoing emotional responses and the ability to employ 
strategies such as distancing oneself from emotionally arousing materials (77). We predict 
that emotionally dysregulated individuals with ADHD would lose the coordinated increase 
of medial prefrontal/anterior cingulate cortex and altered amygdala activation that underpins 
many forms of emotion regulation.

To what extent do individuals with ADHD develop emotional dysregulation for different 
reasons than those with other disorders? Could ADHD-specific symptoms or cognitive 
aberrations be related to emotional dysregulation? ‘Mind wandering’ is one candidate 
cognitive mechanism. It is typically measured as interference in tasks of cognitive control 
and appears to be related to a failure to deactivate the so-called default mode network of the 
brain, a deficit also found in ADHD (125). Importantly, mind wandering appears to lead to 
transient dysphoric mood and vice versa (126). Testing the links between attentional lapses 
and emotion dysregulation, and the possible mediating role of the default mode network 
may be a promising research avenue.

There is evidence in ADHD of an altered structural and functional maturation of the 
prefrontal cortical regions that support ‘top-down’ emotion regulation (127). Could 
disrupted developmental trajectories be particularly pronounced among those both ADHD 
and impaired emotion regulation? Our model predicts a disruption to the white matter tracts 
such as the uncinate fasciculus that connect limbic regions including the amygdala, 
hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex and these tracts can be assessed using diffusion tensor 
imaging.

Behavioral genetic data on twins could parse out the degree to which ADHD and emotion 
dysregulation share genetic or environmental risk factors. This could be achieved by re-
analysis of existing data sets which include measures of irritability and other relevant traits. 
Studies of environmental risk factors have focused on familial characteristics but could also 
define the characteristics of a child's peer group that confer vulnerability to emotion 
dysregulation.

Is a two-pronged pharmacological approach aimed at both the symptoms of ADHD and 
those of emotion dysregulation more effective than psychostimulants alone? This question is 
being examined among children with severe mood dysregulation (most of whom have 
ADHD) by trials that use both psychostimulants and serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(clinicaltrials.gov NCT00794040; NCT01714310). The use of SSRIs is grounded in pre-
clinical studies showing that the modulation of serotonergic tone impacts on the processing 
of emotionally charged stimuli and clinical studies showing efficacy in promoting emotion 
regulation in other disorders (128).

Other agents show promise. Postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists such as guanfacine 
treat core symptoms of ADHD and oppositionality (129). In healthy adults, guanfacine 
reverses the bias to respond less accurately to negative compared to positive emotional 
stimuli, partly through boosting activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (130). 
Given the interactions between the lateral prefrontal cortex and the ventral/medial prefrontal 
cortical regions linked to emotion regulation, guanfacine emerges as a potential ‘emotion 
regulator’ in ADHD. Modafinil, which inhibits dopamine and norepinephrine transporters 
and decreases ϒ-aminobutyric acid also shows promise as a treatment for ADHD (131). In 
healthy adults, modafinil decreases amygdala activation during the viewing of fearful 
stimuli and boosts prefrontal cortical activation during executive functions (132). Again, this 
profile points to a drug with possible benefit for ADHD and associated emotion

dysregulation. Dietary interventions can be considered as there appears to be benefit from 
omega-3-fatty acid supplementation in ADHD (120). Given that low levels of omega-3-fatty 
acids are associated with electrophysiological anomalies during emotion processing in 
ADHD, might emotion dysregulation in ADHD also benefit from supplementation (133)?

Which psychotherapies are promising? Cognitive therapy can help individuals with ADHD 
to recognize and label emotions accurately, to challenge emotions which are not context 
appropriate, and to cope with intense negative emotional reactions (121). These skills have 
been augmented with mindfulness training that promotes a nonjudgmental, present-centered 
focused awareness of emotions. This approach, derived partly from dialectical behavior 
therapy for disorders with prominent emotion dysregulation such as borderline personality 
disorder, is currently being assessed in adults with ADHD (68). Improving executive 
functions such as working memory and planning abilities helps core ADHD symptoms in 
adults, but future studies should also ask if these cognitive interventions also improve 
emotion regulation (121). Similarly, it has been argued that parent-led ‘games’ can boost a 
pre-schooler's executive skills and might prevent later ADHD (134, 135). Might such early 
intervention also promote emotion regulation?

What of interventions that target not just the individual with ADHD but their social context? 
For example, there is a strong rationale for family based interventions to decrease negative 
family dynamics and thus perhaps enhance emotion regulation in both the parent and child 
with ADHD (114). A novel approach leverages a child's peer group as a therapeutic ally 
(136). Children with ADHD often form cliques with disruptive others, and classroom 
interventions might promote alliances with less disruptive children who can perhaps better 
model emotion regulation.

Conclusion

Since Still described the ‘morbid excitability’ of children with ADHD, the presence of 
emotional dysregulation in ADHD has been well recognized. Recent advances in the 
behavioral, neuroimaging and genomic sciences hold the promise that our renewed focus on 
this overlap will result in an understanding of the underlying pathophysiological 
mechanisms and stimulate novel treatment approaches.

Figure 1. 
Forest Plots With Standardized Mean Difference between the ADHD and control groups, 
effect size and homogeneity statistics are given. (A) Aggression: more aggressive behavior 
is seen in the ADHD groups (the effect size for the Abikoff study (ref 11) of boys was 14). 
(B) Emotion recognition deficits are seen in ADHD; (C) Reward processing here is 
measured by the tendency to immediate small rewards over larger, delayed ones. The 
ADHD participants show a tendency to prefer immediate, small rewards. Further details are 
given in Supplemental Material.

Neural circuits implicated in emotion dysregulation in ADHD. The circuitry which 
underpins deficits in early orienting to emotional stimuli and their perception is shown in 
red. Regions which interface between emotional and cognitive circuits, allocating attention 
to emotional stimuli are show in green. Circuitry implicated in cognitive control, motor 
planning and attention is shown in blue. (OFC=orbitofrontal cortex; VLPFC=ventrolateral 
prefrontal cortex; ACC= anterior cingulate cortex; PFC=prefrontal cortex).
