Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic mental illness characterized by changes in mood that alternate
between mania and hypomania or between depression and mixed states, often associated with
functional impairment. Although effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are
available, several patients with BD remain symptomatic. The advance in the understanding of the
neurobiology underlying BD could help in the identiﬁcation of new therapeutic targets as well as
biomarkers for early detection, prognosis, and response to treatment in BD. In this review, we discuss
genetic, epigenetic, molecular, physiological and neuroimaging ﬁndings associated with the neuro-
biology of BD. Despite the advances in the pathophysiological knowledge of BD, the diagnosis
and management of the disease are still essentially clinical. Given the complexity of the brain and the
close relationship between environmental exposure and brain function, initiatives that incorporate
genetic, epigenetic, molecular, physiological, clinical, environmental data, and brain imaging are
necessary to produce information that can be translated into prevention and better outcomes for
patients with BD.

Introduction

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe and chronic psychiatric
illness that affects approximately 1-4% of
the world
population.1 It is characterized by changes in mood that
alternate between mania and hypomania or between
depression and mixed states, often associated with
functional impairment.1-3 Although depressive symptoms
typically predominate in individuals with BD, the clinical
diagnostic hallmark is the presence of manic or hypo-
manic episodes.4 During episodes of mania or hypoma-
nia, the patient may present symptoms related to elevated
mood, including euphoria, feelings of greatness, hyper-
increased sexual activity, decreased need for
activity,
sleep, risky behaviors, irritability, and aggression. Con-
versely, episodes of depression are characterized by anhe-
donia, sadness, vegetative symptoms, and psychomotor

retardation. Mixed episodes manifest as simultaneous
states of mania and depression.4 About 14-59% of the
individuals with BD report suicidal ideation5; 25 to 50%
attempt suicide, and almost 20% die due to suicide.6
Moreover, BD is also associated with increased risk of
mortality by other medical conditions, such as cardiovas-
cular disease, diabetes mellitus, external causes of injuries,
and respiratory diseases. Life expectancy is decreased by
9 years on average in individuals with BD as compared with
the general population.7

Despite the demonstrated efﬁcacy of several drugs to
treat BD, lithium (Li) is the only drug considered as a mood
stabilizer by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). More
than 70 years have passed since this salt was ﬁrst
proposed as a mood stabilizer. Li is effectively used in
BD for maintenance and treatment of acute mania
episodes; however, it has a modest antidepressant action.8

Anticonvulsants such as valproate (VPA) and carbamaze-
pine are also used to treat BD. Additionally, some typical
(e.g., haloperidol and chlorpromazine) and atypical anti-
psychotics (e.g., aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, que-
tiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, and asenapine) have also
shown efﬁcacy.9-11 Of note, the treatment of depression
in BD is particularly challenging, as several drugs used
for treating depressive symptoms, such as selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), can induce a switch
to hypomania or mania. Thus, these drugs are usually
combined with Li for acute treatment and maintenance of
bipolar depression.12 It is noteworthy that patients with
BD commonly face residual mood symptoms, cognitive
and functional impairment, psychosocial disability, and
decreased quality of life even with the best treatment
available.13,14

BD has been suggested as a progressive condition,
and the delay in diagnosis as well as inappropriate treat-
ment can result in repeated mood episodes, persistent
subthreshold symptoms, development of co-morbidities,
and progression of the disease with cognitive impairment
and functional decline.15-17 The term ‘‘neuroprogression’’
has thus been conceptualized as the pathological rewiring
of the brain that takes place in parallel with the functional
and clinical deterioration that may occur in the course of
BD; according to this concept, different stages of BD are
associated with distinct neurobiological underpinnings.18-23
Indeed, studies have shown that structural brain changes
and cognitive deﬁcits are not consistently found at illness
onset, and appear to become more evident with chronicity
and recurring episodes.24-27 Moreover, neuroprogression
seems to be related to the cumulative effects of immune
dysfunction, enhanced oxidative stress, neurotrophic sup-
port breakdown, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impairment
of cellular resilience.20,21,28,29 Neuroprogression has been
also associated with lower responsiveness to treatment,
especially with Li and cognitive behavioral therapy.30-32 In
this sense, Post et al.33 have suggested that multiple
episodes may lead to permanent alterations in neuronal
activity, which may translate into greater liability to relapse
and poorer treatment response. Of note, such a progres-
sive feature does not seem to be present across all
patients, with some not experiencing as much cognitive or
functional impairment as others.34 This poses the particular
challenge of identifying speciﬁc subgroups of susceptible
patients, which may require a deeper understanding of the
biological basis of BD.

Although numerous factors and mechanisms have
been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of BD, its
deﬁnitive etiopathology remains unknown. Nonetheless, it
is believed that the etiology of BD involves an interaction
between multiple genetic, neurochemical, and environ-
mental factors (Figure 1).35 Not only would a deep under-
standing of the neurobiology of BD support the discovery
of new targets for effective pharmacological and non-
it would also facilitate the
pharmacological
identiﬁcation of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and
response to speciﬁc treatments. The last years have
witnessed great progress in the understanding of BD
pathophysiology. For instance, several
lines of thought
have led us to believe that BD is associated with

chemical, and environmental factors plays a role in the onset
and progression of BD.

neuroprogression, and that over time recurrence may
exacerbate subsequent episodes, which are accompa-
nied by functional and cognitive impairment.20,36-38 An
underlying hypothesis is that changes in neuroplasticity,
with a decrease in neurotrophic factors combined with
mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inﬂammation,
circadian rhythm abnormalities, and biological aging accel-
eration, could be associated with the worsening of mood
episodes, refractoriness to treatment, cognitive impair-
ment, and functional disability.20 This article seeks to
discuss studies addressing the neurobiological mechan-
isms of BD, providing an overview of genetic compo-
nents, major signaling pathways, biochemical changes,
and neuroimaging ﬁndings associated with this disorder.

Genetics and epigenetics of bipolar disorder

Evidence suggests that BD presents a very strong genetic
component, with twin studies showing heritability rates
(i.e., the extent to which the disorder can be explained by
genetic factors) as high as 70-80%.39,40 The strength of
this genetic component is also supported by the increased
risk of BD noted in ﬁrst-degree relatives of patients,
including offspring.41 The risk of BD is signiﬁcantly higher
in children of parents diagnosed with BD vs. offspring
of control parents42,43; indeed, a plethora of signs and
symptoms may accompany such familial risk even in the
absence of a full-blown diagnosis of BD.44-48 This familial
aggregation suggests a potential relevance of both inheri-
ted genes, which can be tested by molecular genetic
analyses, and the ‘‘inherited’’ familial environment, which
is also known to be potentially impaired in the face of
parental psychopathology.49,50

In the search for relevant BD-related genes, several
genome-wide association studies (GWASs) conducted
in the past years have identiﬁed multiple loci with a
small effect that may account for heritability,51-62 including
30 recently discovered loci encoding ion channels, neu-
rotransmitter transporters, and synaptic components.63
None of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),

however, has been shown to present high penetrance or
a large effect size, a ﬁnding that is consistent with the
complex multifactorial model that is believed to underlie
the genetics of BD and other psychiatric disorders. More-
over, the difference in heritability rate calculated through
twin studies (70-80%) and that calculated based on
molecular genetics ﬁndings (approximately 30%) is quite
large, suggesting a role of other markers or mechan-
isms.64 These may include gene-by-gene interactions,
rare genetic markers (current GWASs only assess
interac-
‘‘common’’ alterations), gene-by-environment
tions, and epigenetic markers.

Epigenetic mechanisms encompass several pathways
that can mediate gene-by-environment interactions and
modulate gene expression and activity without altering
the DNA sequence. These include, among others, DNA
methylation, histone modiﬁcations, chromatin remodeling,
and the actions of noncoding RNAs. Several of these
have been suggested to play signiﬁcant roles in BD
pathophysiology, especially DNA methylation.65-67 In
addition, several epigenetic alterations that may underlie
risk/resilience mechanisms have been described in youth
at high risk of BD, such as offspring of BD parents.68,69
Speciﬁcally, DNA methylation is a fairly stable epigenetic
alteration that has been implicated in BD pathogenesis
and progression,69-71 as well as in the mechanisms of
action of several drugs used to treat patients.65,72-74 DNA
methylation in promoters is typically associated with the
repression of gene expression and may underlie at least
some of the transcriptomic changes reported for BD in
multiple tissues.75-79 Moreover, several preclinical and
clinical studies have shown that early-life traumatic expe-
riences can induce stable methylation alterations that
into adulthood, suggesting epigenetic-based
persist
alterations as mediators of the clinical effects of early
adversity.80-82

Interestingly, one of the mechanisms by which methy-
lomes have been shown to interfere with BD phenotype
is the modulation of biological aging processes. Patients
with BD have been shown to present several clinical
markers that are suggestive of premature aging, including
a higher rate of age-related conditions and faster cog-
nitive decline, with previous reports suggesting shortened
telomere length compared to controls.83-85 More recently,
a marker of biological aging based solely on DNA
methylation levels (‘‘epigenetic age’’ or ‘‘DNA methylation
age’’)86 has been used to explore the aging processes in
BD, and the results suggest accelerated epigenetic aging
in the blood and brain of BD patients compared to
controls.71,87 Recent evidence that the epigenetic clock
can be pharmacologically reversed in humans88 offers
an interesting treatment possibility for the modulation of
premature aging in BD.

In addition to DNA methylation, noncoding RNAs have
also deserved much attention, including gene expression
modulators such as microRNAs, long noncoding RNAs,
and others.89 Several alterations in the levels of micro-
RNAs and long noncoding RNAs have been detected in BD
samples, some of which have been validated by indepen-
dent studies.90,91 Recent studies have also suggested
that noncoding RNAs may function as clinically relevant

Braz J Psychiatry. 2020;42(5)

peripheral biomarkers when assessed from neuron-
derived extracellular vesicles, which are currently being
investigated in BD patients.92,93 Altogether, these studies
suggest an important role for noncoding RNAs in BD
pathophysiology, and also their potential as an important
diagnostic and prognostic tool.

Changes in neuroplasticity and neurotrophic
signaling

Neurotrophic factors comprise a group of proteins respon-
sible for regulating neuronal survival processes, neuronal
growth, synaptic formation, and cellular plasticity at the
central and peripheral nervous systems. Nerve growth
factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurotrophin-3
(NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) are the most common
neurotrophic factors studied in psychiatric disorders.
However, BDNF is undoubtedly the most studied neuro-
trophin in BD. Neurotrophins are a speciﬁc type of neuro-
trophic factor, and members of this family include BDNF,
NGF, NT-3, and NT-4. Neurotrophins bind and activate
a speciﬁc family of tyrosine kinase (Trk) receptors, thus
the central nervous system
promoting modulation of
(CNS). There are three speciﬁc Trk receptors: NGF binds
to TrkA; BDNF and NT-4 bind to TrkB; and NT-3 binds to
the TrkC receptor.94

The strong interest in BDNF and other neurotrophins
in BD was triggered by the discovery that antidepressants
and mood stabilizers could act on these molecules,
modulating their signaling pathways. Preclinical studies
have shown that the chronic use of antidepressants and
mood stabilizers, such as Li and VPA, can increase NGF,
BDNF, and GDNF levels in the rat brain.95-98 Currently, a
range of studies show decreased levels of BDNF and its
receptor TrkB in both blood and brain of patients with
BD.99-103 Additionally, a BDNF gene polymorphism that
replaces a valine for a methionine (i.e., valine replacing
methionine) at codon 66 (Val66Met) has been repeatedly
associated with BD.104 A previous study also demon-
strated decreased plasma NGF levels in patients with
BD.105 Another clinical study showed that NT-3 and
NT-4 are elevated in the depressive phase of BD,106
possibly indicating an attempt by the organism to defend
itself against cellular stress. In turn, Barbosa et al.107
demonstrated decreased NT-3 and NT-4 levels in the
manic phase of BD. Given that neurotrophins are essen-
for neuronal
tial
is assumed
that
the viability of nerve cells can be affected by a
persistent reduction of these molecules in the nervous
system.

function and survival,

it

As in clinical studies, preclinical research has demon-
strated that amphetamine (AMPH) or ouabain-induced
manic behaviors in rats decrease BDNF, NGF, and GDNF
levels in the brain of animals.95,98 Additionally, decreased
levels of BDNF, NGF, and GDNF followed depressive-like
behaviors in an animal model of depression induced by
maternal deprivation or chronic mild stress.108 A previous
preclinical study suggested that neuroadaptations induced
by chronic administration of dextroamphetamine (d-AMPH)
might mimic neuroprogression in BD, because the brain is

primed for both the manic and depressive episodes which
are characteristic of BD. In that study, the authors showed
that d-AMPH withdrawal induces depressive- and anxious-
like behaviors in rats, as well as a sensitization to manic-
like behaviors.
In line with this, d-AMPH sensitization
decreased the levels of BDNF, NGF, and GDNF and
increased the levels of NT-3 and NT-4/5 in the brain of
rats.109

Together, these clinical and preclinical studies suggest
changes in neurotrophic factors as an attractive molecular
mechanism to explain the decreased cellular plasticity
observed in BD, along with other mechanisms descri-
bed in detail in the next sections. The hypothesis is that
changes in neuroplasticity, including alterations in neuro-
trophic signaling, could be associated with brain damage,
which in turn worsens mood episodes and ultimately
induces cognitive and functioning deﬁcits in patients
with BD.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress

Mitochondria are organelles that are responsible, both
directly and indirectly, for cellular functions such as energy
production; they also function as sources of cellular growth
substrates and play crucial roles in oxidative/nitrosative
stress, cell resilience and cell death.110-112 In the brain,
mitochondria are critical for the modulation of neuronal
activity, short- and long-term neuronal plasticity, cellular
resilience, and behavioral adaptations, mainly through
actions on long-term potentiation, the hallmark process
of learning and memory.112-115 For more than 50 years,
multiple studies have highlighted mitochondrial dysfunction
as a common pathway in BD pathophysiology, triggered by
mechanisms such as impaired oxidative phosphorylation,
shift to glycolytic production of energy, general decrease in
energy, and abnormalities in the morphology and intracel-
lular distribution of mitochondria.116 The ‘‘mitochondrial
hypothesis’’ suggests that BD is triggered, at least in part,
by mitochondrial dysfunction, which can be intimately
linked to a wide range of processes associated with
treatment outcomes and disease progression or severity,
including inﬂammation, oxidative stress, stress response
systems, and accelerated aging.

A considerable number of studies in the literature has
shown an increase in lactate levels and a reduction in
intracellular pH (ipH) in the brain of patients with BD,
possibly indicating altered mitochondrial function and a
glycolytic shift consistent with impaired mitochondrial
metabolism in BD.116-120 Glycolysis-only adenosine tri-
phosphate (ATP) production has been shown to be
powerless to maintain normal levels of Na+/K+-ATPase
activity in neurons, inducing a large calcium inﬂux into
neurons, followed by glutamate excitotoxicity and neu-
ronal apoptosis, both of which play a central role in
neurodegeneration.121 Mallakh et al.122 propose that both
manic and depressed states in BD could be caused by
Na+/K+-ATPase dysfunction – a small reduction in Na+/
K+-ATPase activity in the brain would lead to a hyper-
excitable state (mania) by bringing the resting potential of
neurons closer to the threshold for activation and increas-
in turn,
ing the duration of neurotransmitter release;

539

a further reduction in Na+/K+-ATPase function would
bring the resting potential even closer to the threshold for
activation, decreasing the amplitude of the action poten-
tial and resulting in inhibition of neurotransmitter release
(depression).122
An additional

link between mitochondrial dysfunction
and BD is supported by data demonstrating that patients
with BD present signiﬁcantly lower levels of phospho-
creatine (PCr) (a high-energy compound) and adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) and decreased PCr peak area per-
centage, suggesting regional hypometabolism in all three
mood states.123 Additionally, the PCr peak area percen-
tage was observed to be decreased in the left frontal lobe
of patients during the depressive state, as well as in the
lobe during manic/euthymic states.124,125
right
Moreover, previous studies have shown that patients
with BD present lower levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA),
which is thought
to represent a surrogate marker for
impaired mitochondria, along with a negative correlation
between NAA/creatine + PCr or NAA levels and illness
duration.126-129 Taken together,
these studies provide
indirect evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction may play
a role in illness progression.20

frontal

Several clinical and animal studies have reported
alterations in various energetic metabolism components,
including downregulation of nuclear mRNA molecules and
proteins involved in the Krebs cycle, electron transport
chain (ETC) I-IV complexes, and creatine kinase, as well
as a marked decrease in the activity of ETC complexes
and Krebs cycle enzymes.130-143 Together, these studies
suggest a reduced ability to oxidize NADH and FADH and
transfer electrons to ubiquinone in BD, resulting in reac-
tive oxygen species (ROS) production through an increase
in the rate of electron leakage by ETC complexes.

More recent attention has focused on the maintenance
of a healthy mitochondrial pool, which is critically regu-
lated by the dynamics and turnover of the mitochondrial
population. A damaged mitochondrion may segregate its
damaged components into subcompartments and divide,
whereas a healthy mitochondrion with a potential heal-
thier membrane will continue to participate in fusion and
ﬁssion cycles. Depolarized damaged mitochondria are
often degraded through mitophagy via the PTEN-induced
kinase 1 (PINK1)-Parkin pathway.144 Thus, these dyna-
mic processes of mitochondrial fusion, ﬁssion, transport,
and turnover enable recruitment of healthy mitochondria
to subcellular compartments with high demands for ATP;
disruptions in any of these processes will
lead to mito-
chondrial pathology, cellular dysfunction, and neurological
defects.145 Previous research ﬁndings into mitochondrial
morphology have shown that prefrontal cortex neurons
the postmortem brain from patients with BD and
of
peripheral cells from living BD patients display morpho-
logical abnormalities (more mitochondria of smaller size)
and an abnormal pattern of clumping and marginaliza-
tion in the intracellular distribution of mitochondria.146 By
drawing on the concept of mitochondrial quality control,
recent studies have demonstrated that patients with BD
present an imbalance in mitochondrial ﬁssion and fusion
toward ﬁssion, followed by a decrease in the levels of
mitophagy proteins and increase in caspase-3 protein

G Scaini et al.

levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggest-
ing that, in patients with BD, the number of damaged
mitochondria exceeds the capacity of mitophagy, and
apoptosis becomes the dominant pathway to minimize
tissue damage.147,148

Moreover, numerous studies have provided evidence
of
increased ROS production and oxidative stress in
patients with BD. Replicated evidence has documented
alterations in multiple aspects of oxidative stress regula-
tion, including the production of ROS and reduced anti-
oxidant capacity. Meta-analyses have shown signiﬁcantly
greater levels of lipid peroxidation markers, DNA/RNA
damage, and nitric oxide in BD.149,150 However, mixed
results regarding two of the primary antioxidant enzymes,
glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase
(SOD), have been reported in BD, followed by a meta-
analysis that did not reach statistical signiﬁcance for the
comparison of GPx and SOD activity levels in individuals
with BD vs. controls.149 Conversely, a recent study by
Das et al.151 showed that, although glutathione levels did
not differ in BD and controls, there was a positive, BD-
speciﬁc correlation between lactate and glutathione levels,
indicating a physiological association between the antiox-
idant system and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Several

investigators have reported that excessive
oxidative stress in pathological conditions induces point
mutations and may result in large deletions of mitochon-
drial DNA (mtDNA) due to restricted DNA repair ability
and the absence of histones in mitochondria. Regarding
BD, there is an inconsistency in mtDNA copy number
(mtDNAcn) studies that could be attributed to the diversity
in clinical features, tissue types, and ethnicity.71,152-155 A
recent meta-analysis identiﬁed no signiﬁcant differen-
ces in mtDNAcn exhibited by BD patients or controls,
while an Asian-speciﬁc meta-analysis for BD-mtDNAcn
studies revealed signiﬁcantly lower mtDNAcn in patients
with BD, with a low level of heterogeneity.155 Moreover,
mtDNAcn was inversely correlated with the number of
relapses of manic episodes.154 A possible mechanism
for the lower levels of mtDNAcn could be related to DNA
polymerase gamma (POLG) dysfunction due to oxida-
tive stress.
recent studies have demonstra-
individuals with BD present downregulation
ted that
of POLG,
the replicative polymerase responsible for
maintaining mtDNA, as well as downregulation of the
DNA repair enzyme, 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1
(OGG1).156,157

In fact,

The accumulating evidence reviewed above delineates
multifaceted mitochondrial dysfunction as a pathological
factor in BD. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction, apop-
tosis, and non-methylated mtDNA can activate Toll-like
receptors and lead to spontaneous inﬂammasome activa-
tion, stimulating cytokine production and inducing rapid
activation of the immune system.

Immune-inﬂammatory imbalance and kynurenine
pathway

Immune dysfunction in BD is supported by pre-clinical
and clinical evidence showing elevated levels of pro-
including interleukin-4 (IL-4),
inﬂammatory cytokines,

Braz J Psychiatry. 2020;42(5)

interleukin-1beta (IL-1b), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necro-
sis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-
2R), and soluble receptor of TNF-type 1 (STNFR1), among
others, in patients compared to controls.158-164 A recent
systematic review has suggested an important role for
acute inﬂammatory response during mania and depres-
sion, with the elevation in proinﬂammatory cytokines
seemingly restored after remission of symptoms.118 In
addition,
further ﬁndings in BD have also described
signiﬁcant negative associations between inﬂammatory
markers and general cognitive abilities, as well as neuro-
anatomical alterations.165-169 However, another systematic
review claims that an absolute conclusion cannot be
reached regarding the presence of neuroinﬂammation in
BD, since the ﬁndings are not consistent.170

Several different mechanisms have been proposed
immune dysfunction in BD,171
to explain the role of
including changes in blood-brain barrier, cell death-
induced release of damage-associate molecular patterns
immune activation, genetic mecha-
with consequent
nisms, dysfunction of the gut-brain axis, and a role of the
kynurenine pathway. Activation of the kynurenine path-
way by cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-g) and
TNF-a is described as one of several contributors to
psychiatric pathogeneses. Kynurenine metabolites med-
iate immune-inﬂammation and neurodegeneration and
can lead to neurotoxicity and impaired neurotransmis-
sion. The enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1)
converts tryptophan into kynurenine and is activated by
inﬂammatory cytokines. Kynurenine is then metabolized
into hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid in microglia,
and into kynurenic acid (KYNA) in astrocytes. Hydro-
xykynurenine and quinolinic acid are N-methyl-D-aspar-
tic acid (NDMA) agonists and increase the production
of free radicals, while KYNA, an N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor antagonist, has neuroprotective effects
but also leads to cognitive deﬁcits and psychosis when in
higher levels.172-174

A previous study showed an imbalance toward the
neurotoxicity path derived from kynurenine metabolism,
as evidenced by decreased levels of KYNA, in addition
to increased hydroxykynurenine/kynurenine ratio in BD
compared with healthy controls.175 The higher hydro-
xykynurenine levels may correlate to cognitive dysfunc-
tion not only in the acute phases of BD, but also in
euthymic periods.27 Recent evidence shows that KYNA
levels in cerebrospinal ﬂuid represent a biomarker for
psychotic episodes in BD. This higher risk of developing
psychosis may be explained by enhanced dopaminergic
transmission due to increased brain KYNA concentra-
tions.176 Conversely, decreased peripheral KYNA and
unchanged KYNA levels were observed in the CNS in BD
patients during the depressive phase.177

Abnormalities in kynurenine metabolism resulting
from the inﬂammatory response displayed in mood dis-
orders may also contribute to the structural (volume
reduction) and functional alterations observed in the
hippocampus and amygdala.175,178 One possible exp-
lanation for this process is dendritic atrophy in the
context of the neurotoxicity occurring in unmedicated
patients with BD.178

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis

In addition to the genetic component
involved in the
pathogenesis and pathophysiology of BD, it is known that
nongenetic factors, such as psychosocial stress, can
trigger the development of mood disorders.179 The hypo-
thalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis is the primary
mediator of the biological response to stress. Abnormal-
ities in this system have been associated with the clinical
course of BD180 and may contribute to increased risk of
clinical relapse following an intense psychosocially stres-
sful event,181 although the underlying mechanisms involved
in these associations remain essentially unknown.180

A meta-analysis has demonstrated that BD is related
to a more prominent activity level of the HPA axis, as
evidenced by increased basal cortisol, postdexametha-
sone (PDEX) cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) levels, along with a higher response to the
dexamethasone (DEX)/corticotropin releasing hormone
(CRH) test.182 The alterations described in HPA axis
activity vary according to the clinical phase of BD.
Although the hyperactive HPA axis seems more promi-
nent during the manic phase, it may persist during clinical
remission because euthymic BD patients also display
higher levels of cortisol.182 The clinical heterogeneity of
the depressive phase may explain the conﬂicting ﬁndings
related to HPA axis activity, with high cortisol levels found
in melancholic depression and normal or low cortisol
levels associated with atypical depression.183,184

Particularly interesting is the study by Fries et al.70
showing that patients with BD, particularly at a late stage
of
illness, presented increased salivary PDEX cortisol
levels followed by reduced ex vivo glucocorticoid receptor
(GR) responsiveness and increased basal protein levels
of FK506-binding protein 51, a cochaperone known to
desensitize GR, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Moreover, individuals with BD presented increased meth-
ylation at the FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene,
suggesting a dysfunctional negative feedback of the HPA
axis and impaired GR responsiveness due to increased
FKBP51 levels and increased FKBP5 intronic methyla-
tion. In this same study, the authors suggest that, as BD
progresses, there is decreased resilience to stress and a
higher risk of new mood episodes, since stress resilience
and coping mechanisms are primarily mediated by the HPA
axis. High levels of PDEX cortisol may also be involved in
the mechanism of increased late-stage BD recurrence.
Therefore, DEX suppression test results and HPA axis
hyperactivity may have prognostic value in BD.70

Furthermore, the hyperactive HPA axis correlates with
an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction185 and is known
to have neurotoxic effects on the hippocampus that can
later predispose to dementia.186 Lee et al.187 described
that patients with BD with poorer cognitive performance
had higher levels of serum cortisol, as well as a signiﬁcant
correlation between cognitive function after 24 weeks of
standard treatment and longitudinal changes in cortisol
levels,
reinforcing the hypothesis that serum cortisol
may be involved in the psychopathological mechanisms
of cognitive decline in BD. Moreover, some evidence
suggests that an abnormal HPA axis may explain the

increased number and size of corticotrophs, leading to the
larger pituitary volume found in neuroimaging studies of
patients with BD vs. healthy controls.188 Interestingly,
some HPA alterations seem to be a trait predisposing to
mood disorders – it was demonstrated that ﬁrst-degree
relatives of subjects with BD had elevated baseline
cortisol
levels and alterations in the response to the
DEX/CRH test.189-191 Accordingly, a previous study with
offspring of parents with BD showed that these at-risk
children have epigenetic alterations that can modulate GR
responsiveness and the HPA axis,69 ultimately suggest-
ing a biological mechanism by which the stress axis may
be compromised in BD and in at-risk subjects.

Circadian rhythm abnormalities

indicating that

Sleep disturbances commonly occur in BD and are part of
the diagnostic criteria for BD. Normally, there is reduced
sleep during manic episodes, and insomnia or hyper-
somnia during depressive episodes.4,192 Dampened and
shifted circadian rhythms may explain some of
the
sleep disturbances frequently reported by patients with
BD.193-195 Indeed, circadian dysregulation is associated
with BD both during acute episodes and during inter-
episode periods,
these disruptions in
circadian rhythms may represent biological markers of
the BD.196 Actigraphy studies have demonstrated that
individuals at risk for BD exhibit a lower relative ampli-
tude of the rest-activity cycle, and more sleep irregularity
than controls.197 Notably, variability in the sleep-wake cycle
has been shown to predict the onset of depressive epi-
sodes among people with inter-episode BD.198 Similarly,
patients with BD have been shown to present lower activity
levels, also in addition to sleeping longer, taking longer to
fall asleep, spending more time in bed and awake in the
middle of the night, and showing a more variable pattern
of sleep-wake cycles. Data from several studies have
suggested that patients also exhibit more considerable
intra-daily variability and lower inter-daily stability, as
well as relative amplitude of
the rest-activity cycle
relative to controls.199

Additionally, one of the most commonly reported rhythm-
related ﬁndings in BD is a signiﬁcantly higher prevalence of
evening chronotypes.200-204 In individuals with BD, even-
ingness has also been associated with earlier age of onset,
rapid-cycling course, and other factors such as reduction in
the peak of the melatonin secretion at night.202 Mondin
et al.205 showed that patients with BD with evening
preference had lower levels of IL-6, TNF-a and thiobarbi-
turic acid reactive substance (TBARS), suggesting that
chronotype may affect
interleukin and oxidative stress
levels in BD. Furthermore, population-based studies
have demonstrated that the eveningness chronotype is
more common in cyclothymic individuals, especially
those with at
least one prior episode of depression,
and some, but not all, temperament studies that are
putatively linked to risk of BD (hyperthymic tempera-
ment) show a higher prevalence of this chronotype in
at-risk populations.206

Moreover, the secretion of melatonin and cortisol also
follows a circadian pattern. Evidence has indicated that

G Scaini et al.

people with BD exhibit melatonin secretion abnormalities,
suggesting that differences in the amount and timing of
melatonin secretion may reﬂect different mood states.
During the manic episode, high levels of melatonin were
observed during the day, with an advanced nighttime
peak,207 whereas reduced levels and a later onset of
melatonin secretion have been reported in bipolar depres-
sion compared with unipolar depression, and in euthymic
phases of BD compared with matched controls.208,209
Similarly, 24-h cortisol secretion is signiﬁcantly higher in
patients with BD than in controls, independent of the clinical
phase (manic, depressive, or euthymic).210 These ﬁndings
are consistent with the observation of increased GR mRNA
in the hippocampus and amygdala in patients with BD
compared with those in controls.211

In the past few decades, several genetic association
studies have demonstrated a link between multiple
circadian genes and BD, such as CLOCK, ARTNL1,
CSNK1e, PER3, NPAS2, NR1D1, TIMELESS, RORA,
RORB, and GSK3b. All had modest associations with
BD, supporting a polygenic heritability through which
multiple genes additively contribute to the risk of
BD.212-220 Although GSK3b is considered a likely can-
didate gene, no association has been reported between
BD and the GSK3b gene polymorphism. However, the
frequency of a copy number variant
the
GSK3b locus was higher in individuals with BD than in
controls.221,222

(CNV) at

In BD, the circadian genes PER3, REV-ERBa, and
GSK3b were associated with an early age of disease
onset, and the CRY2, CLOCK, ARNTL2, TIMELESS, and
CSNK1e were related to rapid BD cycling and/or high
disease recurrence.223-226 These ﬁndings are consistent
is
with the observation that an early age of onset
associated with more severe circadian disruptions, such
as eveningness and sleep quality. Thus, speciﬁc circadian
genes may be signiﬁcant in a particular BD subgroup (early
onset). Furthermore, these ﬁndings suggest that variations
in some circadian genes may explain the high sensitivity to
rhythm changes observed in BD and may be associated
with disease onset or relapse.196 Additionally, chronotype
and genotype association studies in BD showed that the
3111T/C CLOCK variant is associated with an extreme
night chronotype, and one nonsynonymous PER3 coding
SNP and two CSNK1e intronic SNPs were associated with
the night chronotype in BD patients.212,220

Circadian genes have also been implicated in bipolar-
like behaviors in animal models. The most notable
example is the behavior of mice with an exon 19 exclusion
in the CLOCK gene, which represents a valuable model
of mania.227 These ClockD19 mice display hyperacti-
vity, increased exploratory drive, lowered depression-like
behavior, higher impulsivity, abnormal sleep/wake cycles,
and increased reward response. ClockD19 mutant mice
show a craving for rewarding stimuli similar to patients
with BD in the manic state.228,229 The manic behavior
of CLOCK mutant mice can be reversed by treatment with
Li or by restoring a functional CLOCK gene in the ventral
tegmental area.230 Another mouse model
involving cir-
cadian genes includes transgenic mice that overexpress
GSK3b and show a manic-like phenotype.231

Neuroimaging ﬁndings in bipolar disorder

In one of

The ﬁrst studies using computed tomography (CT) have
shown structural abnormalities as signiﬁcantly larger
ventricular-to-brain ratios in groups of
individuals with
BD compared with controls.232 Following the pioneering
study (among others) of Pearlson & Veroff,232 cumulative
evidence produced by CT and magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) have shown changes in neuroanatomic struc-
tures associated with BD.
the ﬁrst reviews
concerning volumetric structural neuroimaging in BD,
Soares and Mann described a larger third ventricle and a
smaller cerebellum, as well as periventricular hyperinten-
sities in BD patients, the latter also found in the elderly
with unipolar depression.233 More recently, the ENIGMA
Working Group, which includes 28 international groups,
showed reduced bilateral cortical thickness in the frontal,
temporal, and parietal regions of patients with BD, espe-
cially the left rostral middle frontal cortex, left fusiform
gyrus, and left pars opercularis. The authors also found
an association between the duration of illness with cortical
thickness, and increased cortical thickness with the use
of Li. A history of psychosis in patients with BD was
associated with reduced surface area in the right caudal
anterior cingulate cortex and left inferior temporal gyrus
compared with patients without psychosis.234 Regarding
the volume of brain regions associated with mood regu-
lation and reward, some studies showed smaller amyg-
dala and hippocampus and a larger striatum, although
contrasting ﬁndings have also been found.235-238 The
integration of MRI with machine learning methods to
distinguish between patients with BD and healthy con-
trols, as well as for clinical stratiﬁcation, was investigated
the algorithm had up
by Mwangi et al., showing that
to 70% of accuracy and higher probability scores for those
in the late-stage category (more than 10 total
lifetime
manic episodes including hospitalizations).239 This poten-
tial impact of machine learning techniques in the evalua-
tion of individuals with BD was extensively explored in
a systematic review by Librenza-Garcia et al.240 Of
51 studies included, 38 applied machine learning to dis-
criminate between BD and healthy controls or other psy-
chiatric disorders, especially with neuroimaging data.240
For instance, Fung et al.241 investigated psychiatric diag-
nosis accuracy using a support vector machine (SVM)
algorithm with brain cortical thickness and surface area
data. The authors found that structural brain differences
between individuals with BD and major depressive
disorder were able to discriminate these psychiatric
disorders with 74.3% (adequate) accuracy (sensitivity:
62.5%; speciﬁcity: 84.2%).241 More recently, a Big Data
Task Force from the International Society for Bipolar
Disorders has expanded this literature review and dis-
cussed issues to be addressed in machine learning-based
studies,
including the main barriers for applying these
techniques and strategies to approach them.242

Since human behavior, including cognition, emotion,
and social
interaction, reﬂects complex neural circuit
communication,243 the signs and symptoms we observe
in individuals with psychiatric disorders could be under-
stood as the manifestation of different brain circuitry

imaging (DTI)

dysfunction.244 Diffusion tensor
is a
neuroimaging technique used to evaluate white matter
ﬁber tract connectivity between different regions, both
proximal and distal.245 A review246 of DTI studies in sub-
jects with BD showed a consistent decrease in fractional
anisotropy (FA) values in patients, especially in the fronto-
limbic tracts and corpus callosum. As part of the ENIGMA
network, Favre et al.247 investigated white matter abnorm-
alities in patients with BD compared to healthy controls.
The authors found white matter microstructure alterations
principally within the cingulum, the main pathway in the
limbic system, and in interhemispheric connectivity by
the corpus callosum.247 Thus, DTI studies have shown
consistent abnormalities in regions associated with emo-
tional regulation as well as in structures that integrate these
regions interhemispherically.

Foley et al.,248 based on previous studies from the
literature, have investigated whether fractional anisotropy
in the uncinate fasciculus distinguished participants
with BD-I from those with BD-II and healthy controls.
The results showed signiﬁcantly decreased FA in the
uncinate fasciculus in patients with BD-I compared with
both healthy controls and BD-II patients, suggesting a
distinction in the pathophysiology of BD subtypes. Mahon
et al.249 used DTI to identify white matter biomarkers of
genetic risk. To achieve their aim, the authors evaluated
participants with BD, unaffected siblings of individuals
with BD, and healthy controls. The results showed that FA
within the right temporal lobe of unaffected siblings was
signiﬁcantly different, and intermediate in relation to parti-
cipants with BD and healthy controls, suggesting a bio-
marker for genetic risk of BD.249

Using speciﬁc cognitive and emotional tasks, functional
MRI (fMRI) methods allow the investigation of neural cir-
cuitry associated with distinct behaviors. Using a cogni-
tive control task, Smucny et al.250 evaluated whether a
continuum exists in the underlying neural circuitry across
participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and BD and
healthy controls. The authors found a linear trend in the
task-associated dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
and superior parietal cortex (SPC) response among the
three groups, with participants with schizophrenia show-
ing more severe dysfunction and those with BD an
intermediate pattern. These ﬁndings show that, despite
the different categorical diagnoses, individuals with schizo-
phrenia and BDs may share some neurobiological char-
acteristics.250

Functional neuroimaging studies with BD patients have
found connectivity dysfunctions in neural circuits asso-
ciated with emotion processing, emotion regulation and
reward processing.251 Patterns of amygdala activation
and connectivity during emotion processing tasks were
compared between individuals with BD and unipolar
depression by Korgaonkar et al., with both groups in
remission.252 The ﬁndings demonstrated lower connec-
tivity of the amygdala with the insula and hippocampus
and of the amygdala with the medial orbitofrontal cortex in
patients with BD.252 Individuals with BD also presented a
lower modulatory effect of the DLPFC on the amygdala
during emotion regulation tasks compared with healthy
controls.253 In a review, Nusslock & Alloy suggest that

hypersensitivity to reward-relevant cues is related to hypo/
manic symptoms, especially excessive approach motiva-
tion and psychomotor hyperactivation, representing a risk
trait for BD.254 Acuff et al.255 compared reward processing
circuitry among offspring of bipolar parents, offspring of
parents with non-BD disorder, and offspring of healthy
parents during a reward processing task using fMRI. The
results showed that offspring of parents with BD had lower
functional connectivity between the right ventral striatum-
left caudal anterior cingulate in response to loss; and higher
functional connectivity between the right pars orbitalis-left
and right orbitofrontal cortex in response to reward,
indicating potential neural markers for the risk of BD.255
Despite the impressive advances in technology and
interesting neuroimaging ﬁndings associated with a psy-
chiatric diagnosis,247 as well as the response to treatment
and risk identiﬁcation,255,256 there is still no direct clinical
application of brain imaging at this moment in psychiatry.

Conclusion, challenges, and perspectives

the current

The use of tools and technologies that can positively
affect mental health parameters using translational
approaches still faces several challenges, particularly in
the case of BD. First, there is no biomarker with signiﬁcant
biological and clinical validation in BD, which complicates
diagnosis and hinders the development of new drugs.
Second,
literature highlights an important
limitation of the existing evidence – most studies are still
cross-sectional, and thus capable of identifying associa-
tions but not causal relationships or longitudinal patterns
of development. Third, BD involves heterogeneous symp-
tomatology, various comorbidities, and cognitive impair-
ment, as well as a wide range of genetic and environmental
factors. Similarly to other psychiatric disorders, BD is
diagnosed based on purely clinical criteria and history
taking,
interviewing, and behavioral observation; and
overlaps pathophysiologically with numerous other dis-
orders.64,257-260 In this context, the translation of biological
ﬁndings in BD to the clinical setting is still highly complex,
and there is still a long way between translating these initial
ﬁndings into approved therapies for patients.261

As discussed in the present article, brain-imaging studies
have shown evidence of change in regional activity, func-
tional connectivity, neuronal activity, and bioenergetics
associated with BD, while past research on animals and
human models have added mechanistic evidence on
bioenergetic dysfunction,
inﬂammation, oxidative stress,
as well as abnormalities in signaling networks, HPA axis,
and circadian rhythm (Figure 2).
In addition to its
complexity, brain function is constantly inﬂuenced by
environmental exposure, which can be associated not
only with the risk of mental illness but also resilience and
protection.262 It is not surprising that all of these changes
are involved in the neurobiology of BD, a disease with a
complicated clinical course involving manic, depressive,
mixed, and euthymic episodes.

In addition, studies providing insights into how parti-
cular brain abnormalities lead to one, not another speciﬁc
clinical presentation, and the interaction between immune
and neurochemical alterations and cognition are needed

Figure 2 Summary of recent research on neurobiological mechanisms of BD. Multiple biochemical pathways, not all of which
are shown here, interact simultaneously to cause cellular damage. Mitochondrial dysfunction in BD pathophysiology is based
on changes affecting oxidative phosphorylation, energy production, increased formation of ROS, mitochondrial DNA damage,
membrane permeability, Ca+2 imbalance, and impairment in mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. These alterations can
lead to increased apoptosis and NLRP3-inﬂammasome activation. However, this relationship may be bidirectional, wherein
mitochondrial dysfunction can increase inﬂammatory factors, and inﬂammation can induce ROS production and mitochondrial
dysfunction. Inﬂammation, also reported in BD, is responsible for the activation of enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), leading to the skewing of the kynurenine metabolic balance toward increased
neurotoxicity. Moreover, inﬂammatory mediators and stress mechanisms activate the HPA axis resulting in secretion of
corticosteroids from the adrenal cortex. In BD, the negative feedback of cortisol to the hypothalamus and pituitary components
is thought to be impaired, leading to continual activation of the HPA axis and excess cortisol release. Cortisol receptors become
desensitized, leading to increased activity of pro-inﬂammatory immune mediators and downregulation of neurotrophic factors
such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Besides, corticosteroids are secreted rhythmically, displaying ultradian and
circadian patterns, and CLOCK-related genes directly regulate glucocorticoid receptor expression. Circadian rhythms also play
a role in mitochondrial functioning by regulating biogenesis, ﬁssion/fusion, and mitophagy. These alterations could initiate a
vicious cycle where multiple systems and mechanisms exacerbate and accelerate cellular damage, synaptic dysfunction, and
impaired neurogenesis, resulting in progressive structural brain changes and cognitive decline thought to contribute to the
neuroprogression of BD. 3-HK = 3-hydroxykynurenine; ACTH = adrenocorticotropic hormone; BD = bipolar disorder; BDNF =
brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Ca = calcium; CRH = corticotropin releasing hormone; Fis-1 = mitochondrial ﬁssion 1 protein;
FKBP51 = FK506-binding protein 51; GR = glucocorticoid receptor; HPA = hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal; IDO = indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase;
IL = interleukin; KMO = kynurenine 3-monooxygenase; NMDA = N-methyl-D-aspartate; OXPHOS =

for a better understanding of the neurobiology of BD.
The step towards accurate biomarker identiﬁcation in
psychiatry, including those for BD, will probably require
the integration of different sources of evidence. Multidis-
ciplinary research on a single cohort of patients will have
more power to increase understanding of BD biology than
independent genomic, cell biology, brain imaging, and
clinical studies. Moreover, the improvement of technolo-
gies related to neuroimaging is undoubtedly a promis-
ing measure for advancing the study of neural circuits
involved in BD. Finally, longitudinal cohort studies using
multimodal and standardized techniques are essential to
increase the understanding of BD.
