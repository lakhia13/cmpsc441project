Personality disorders, including borderline personality disorder, are diagnosed based on a:

- Detailed interview with your doctor or a mental health professional.

- Mental health evaluation that may include completing a series of questions.

- Medical history and exam.

- Discussion of your symptoms.

A diagnosis of borderline personality disorder usually is made in adults — not in children or teenagers. That's because what may appear to be symptoms of borderline personality disorder in children or teenagers may go away as they get older and mature.

Borderline personality disorder is mainly treated using psychotherapy, which also is known as talk therapy. But medicine may be added. Your doctor also may recommend that you stay in the hospital if your safety is at risk.

Treatment can help you learn skills to manage and cope with your condition. You also should be treated for any other mental health conditions that often occur along with borderline personality disorder, such as depression or substance misuse. With treatment, you can feel better about yourself and have a stabler, more fulfilling life.

Talk therapy is a basic treatment approach for borderline personality disorder. Your mental health professional may adjust the type of therapy to best meet your needs.

Talk therapy seeks to help you:

- Focus on your ability to function.

- Learn to manage emotions that feel uncomfortable.

- Reduce your impulsiveness by helping you note feelings rather than act on them.

- Work on making relationships better by being aware of your feelings and those of others.

- Learn about borderline personality disorder.

Management of borderline personality disorder mainly focuses on making sense of moments that are emotionally hard by thinking about what happened in your relationships that led to those moments. Good mental health management tends to include a combination of individual therapy, group therapy, family education and medicines for related conditions.

Types of talk therapy that have been found to be effective include:

- Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT).DBTincludes group and individual therapy designed to treat borderline personality disorder.DBTuses a skills-based approach to teach you how to manage your emotions, handle distress and understand relationships better.

- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).CBThelps you change your beliefs that come from distorted ways of seeing things. It also can help with relationship issues. The goal is to learn to pinpoint negative thoughts and cope with those thoughts. This treatment can reduce mood swings and make you less anxious. It also can make it less likely that you'll harm yourself or attempt suicide.

- Schema-focused therapy.Schema-focused therapy focuses on changing negative thought patterns.

- Mentalization-based therapy (MBT).MBThelps you note your thoughts and feelings and see things differently.MBTstresses thinking before reacting.

- Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem-Solving (STEPPS).STEPPSis a 20-week treatment program where you work in groups that include your family members, caregivers, friends or significant others.STEPPSis used in addition to other types of talk therapy.

- Transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP).Also called psychodynamic psychotherapy,TFPaims to help you learn about your emotions and issues relating to others by creating a relationship between you and your therapist. You then apply what you learn to other situations.

The Food and Drug Administration hasn't approved any drugs specifically to treat borderline personality disorder. But some medicines may help with symptoms. And some medicines can help with conditions that occur with borderline personality disorder, such as depression, impulsiveness, aggression or anxiety. Medicines used to treat these conditions may include antidepressants, antipsychotics or mood-stabilizing drugs.

Talk to your doctor or mental health professional about the benefits and side effects of medicines.


### Hospitalization


At times, you may need to be treated in a psychiatric hospital or clinic. Staying in the hospital also may keep you safe from harming yourself or help you talk about thoughts or behaviors related to suicide.


### Recovery takes time


Learning to manage your emotions, thoughts and behaviors takes time. Most people improve greatly, but some people always struggle with some symptoms of borderline personality disorder. You may have times when your symptoms are better or worse. But treatment can make it easier to function and help you feel better about yourself.

You have the best chance for success when you work with a mental health professional who has experience treating borderline personality disorder.

- Manage strong emotions by practicing coping skills, such as the use of breathing techniques and mindfulness meditation.

- Set limits for yourself and others by learning how to express emotions in a manner that doesn't push others away or make you feel abandoned or unstable.

- Don't assume what people are feeling or thinking about you.

- Reach out to others with borderline personality disorder to share your experiences and what you've learned.

- Build a support system of people who can understand and respect you.

- Keep up a healthy lifestyle, such as eating a healthy diet, being physically active and taking part in social activities.
