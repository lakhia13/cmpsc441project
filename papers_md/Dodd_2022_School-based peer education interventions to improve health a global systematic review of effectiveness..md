Abstract 
Introduction:  Peer education, whereby peers (‘peer educators’) teach their other peers (‘peer learners’) about aspects 
of health is an approach growing in popularity across school contexts, possibly due to adolescents preferring to seek 
help for health-related concerns from their peers rather than adults or professionals. Peer education interventions 
cover a wide range of health areas but their overall effectiveness remains unclear. This review aims to summarise the 
effectiveness of existing peer-led health interventions implemented in schools worldwide.

Methods:  Five electronic databases were searched for eligible studies in October 2020. To be included, studies 
must have evaluated a school-based peer education intervention designed to address the health of students aged 
11–18-years-old and include quantitative outcome data to examine effectiveness. The number of interventions were 
summarised and the impact on improved health knowledge and reductions in health problems or risk-taking behav-
iours were investigated for each health area separately, the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess quality.

(52.2%) showed evidence of effectiveness, 8/67 (11.9%) showed mixed findings and 24/67 (35.8%) found limited or 
no evidence of effectiveness. Of the 11 papers reporting peer educator outcomes, 4/11 (36.4%) showed evidence of 
effectiveness, 2/11 (18.2%) showed mixed findings and 5/11 (45.5%) showed limited or no evidence of effectiveness.

Discussion:  School-based peer education interventions are implemented worldwide and span a wide range of 
health areas. A number of interventions appear to demonstrate evidence for effectiveness, suggesting peer education 
may be a promising strategy for health improvement in schools. Improvement in health-related knowledge was most 
common with less evidence for positive health behaviour change. In order to quantitatively synthesise the evidence

Introduction
Ensuring  good  health  and  wellbeing  amongst  school-
aged  children  is  a  global  public  health  priority  and  the 
contribution  schools  can  make  to  this  goal  is  increas-
ingly  recognised  [1].  Worldwide,  we  have  seen  a  rise  in 
peer education interventions over recent decades [2]. For 
example,  a  survey  in  England  revealed  that  62%  of  pri-
mary and secondary schools had offered a peer-led inter-
vention in 2009 [3]. Peer-led interventions within school 
settings  are  popular  for  many  reasons,  including  the 
important role peers play within the lives of young peo-
ple, a perception that this approach involves relatively few 
resources,  and  the  more  even  balance  of  authority  than 
in  teacher-led  lessons  [4]. The  use  of  peer  educators  for 
health improvement has also been linked with the impor-
tance of peer influence in adolescence [5]. This is a time 
of  increased  social  development  and  peer  attachments 
are  central  to  young  people’s  development,  particularly 
during adolescence [5, 6]. Further, there is evidence that 
young  people  are  more  likely  to  seek  help  from  infor-
mal sources of support such as friends in comparison to 
adults  [7],  and  of  older  students  being  perceived  as  role 
models by their younger peers [8]. Benefits are also likely 
to exist for peer educators themselves, including oppor-
tunities  to  develop  confidence  and  leadership  skills,  as 
well  as  many  schools  rewarding  peer  educators  with  a 
qualification or endorsement for their participation [9].

Existing  peer  education  interventions  cover  a  wide 
range  of  health  areas,  including  mental  health,  physical 
health, sexual health, and a general promotion of healthy 
lifestyles including eating habits and smoking prevention 
[10–13]. There is also variation in the format or delivery 
of  peer-led  interventions  including  1:1  peer  mentoring, 
peer  buddy  initiatives,  peer  counselling,  and  peer  edu-
cation  [14–17].  This  review  focuses  specifically  on  peer 
education,  which  typically  involves  the  selection  and 
training of ‘peer educators’ or ‘leaders’, who subsequently 
relay  health  related  information  or  skills  to  younger  or 
similar  aged  students  in  their  school,  known  as  ‘peer 
learners’ or ‘recipients’.

Summary of related reviews

The  current  literature  on  peer  education  indicates  a 
mixed evidence base regarding its effectiveness.

Ten previous reviews were found concerning health-
related  peer  education  among  young  people  [10,  12, 

18–24]. Of these, six concerned sexual health/HIV pre-
vention,  two  concerned  health  promotion/education 
more broadly, one focused on substance abuse and one 
focused on mental health.

Kim  and  Free’s  review  concerning  sexual  health  [21] 
found  no  overall  effect  of  peer  education  on  condom 
use,  mixed  findings  on  sexually  transmitted  infec-
tion  (STI)  prevention,  and  positive  findings  regarding 
improvements  in  knowledge,  attitudes  and  intentions. 
Siddiqui  et  al.  [20]  reviewed  peer  education  pro-
grammes  for  promoting  the  sexual  and  reproductive 
health  of  young  people  in  India,  revealing  large  varia-
tions in the way peer education is implemented as well 
as  mixed  effectiveness  findings  and  limited  effects  of 
behaviour  relative  to  knowledge.  Maticka-Tyndale  and 
Barnet  [22]  compiled  a  review  into  peer-led  interven-
tions  to  reduce  HIV  risk  among  youth  using  a  narra-
tive  synthesis,  and  found  that  peer  interventions  led 
to  positive  change  in  knowledge  and  condom  use,  and 
had some success in changing community attitudes and 
norms,  but  no  significant  findings  for  effects  on  other 
sexual behaviours and STI rates. By comparison, Tolli’s 
review  [12]  regarding  the  effectiveness  of  peer  educa-
tion  interventions  for  HIV  prevention  found  no  clear 
evidence  of  peer  education  effectiveness  for  HIV  pre-
vention,  adolescent  pregnancy  prevention  or  sexual 
health promotion in young people of member countries 
of the European Union.

Mellanby  et  al.  [23]  reviewed  the  literature  compar-
ing peer-led and adult-led school health education and 
identified  eleven  studies.  Seven  of  these  studies  found 
peer-led  to  be  more  effective  for  health  behaviour 
change than adult-led and three of these studies found 
peer-led to me more effective for change in knowledge 
and  attitudes.  Harden  et  al.  [24]  identified  64  peer-
delivered  health  interventions  for  young  people  aged 
11 to 24 in any setting (i.e. not restricted to school set-
tings),  with  only  12  evaluations  judged  to  be  method-
ologically  sound.  Of  these  12,  7  studies  (58%)  showed 
a  positive  effect  on  at  least  one  behavioural  outcome. 
This  review  concluded  an  unclear  evidence  base  for 
peer-delivered health promotion for young people.

MacArthur et al’s [19] investigation of peer-led inter-
ventions  to  prevent  tobacco,  alcohol  and/or  drug  use 
among  young  people  aged  11–21,  comprised  a  meta-
analysis, pooling 10 studies on tobacco use, and found 
lower  prevalence  of  smoking  among  those  receiving

the peer-led interventions compared with controls. The 
authors  also  found  that  peer-led  interventions  were 
associated  with  benefit  in  relation  to  alcohol  use,  and 
three studies suggested an association with lower odds 
of cannabis use.

A  recent  systematic  review  by  King  and  Fazel  of  11 
school-based  peer-led  mental  health  interventions  stud-
ies  revealed  mixed  effectiveness  [10].  Some  studies 
showed  significant  improvements  in  peer  educator  self-
esteem  and  social  stress  [25],  but  one  study  showed  an 
increase in guilt in peer educators [26]. Two studies also 
found  improvements  in  self-confidence  [27],  and  qual-
ity  of  life  in  peer  learners  [28],  but  one  study  found  an 
increase  in  learning  stress  and  decrease  in  overall  men-
tal health scores [26]. The review concluded there is bet-
ter  evidence  if  benefits  for  peer  educators  compared  to 
peer  learners.  The  summary  above  of  previous  system-
atic  assessments  of  the  peer  education  approach  reveals 
a limited evidence base for school-based peer education 
interventions. Only two reviews were included regarding 
school-based peer education, one of which occurred over 
20 years ago [23], while the other [10] was more narrowly 
concerned with mental health outcomes.

Despite  the  widespread  use  of  peer-led  interventions, 
the  evidence  base  across  all  health  areas  still  remains 
limited  and  little  is  known  regarding  their  overall  effec-
tiveness  in  terms  of  changing  behaviours  or  increas-
ing  health-related  knowledge  and/or  attitudes.  Due  to 
the  limited  evidence  base  of  peer  education  interven-
tions, this review is broad in scope and will cover global 
peer  education  interventions  covering  all  health  areas. 
Although some peer education interventions are targeted 
towards specific populations, this review focuses on uni-
versal  interventions  available  to  an  entire  cohort  of  stu-
dents (for example whole class or whole year group). The 
review  aims  to  summarise  the  effectiveness  of  existing 
peer-led health interventions in schools. This is a review 
of quantitative data; the qualitative peer education litera-
ture will be published in a separate review.

Methods
We  followed  the  PICO  (Population,  Intervention,  Com-
parator  and  Outcome)  format  to  develop  our  research 
question. We completed the systematic review in accord-
ance  with  the  2009  PRISMA  statement  [29]  and  regis-
tered it with PROSPERO (CRD42021229192).

Search strategy and selection criteria

Five electronic databases were searched for eligible stud-
ies: CINAHL, Embase, ERIC, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. 
The  list  of  search  terms  (see  Supplementary  Materials) 
were developed after scanning relevant literature for key 
terms. Searches took place during October 2020.

Once  the  search  terms  had  been  agreed  amongst  the 
study  team,  pilot  searches  were  run  to  check  that  key 
texts  were  appearing.  Search  terms  were  subsequently 
refined  and  this  process  was  repeated  until  all  key  texts 
appeared.  Search  strategies  such  as  truncations  were 
used to maximise results. No restrictions were placed on 
publication date, country or language.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

To be included studies had to be concerned with school-
based  peer  education  interventions  designed  to  address 
aspects  of  the  health  of  pupils  aged  11–18 years  old.  We 
are  interested  in  this  age  group  in  particular  as  it  is  a 
period  when  peers  take  on  a  particularly  important  role 
in young people’s lives. Peer education interventions con-
cerned  with  health  are  defined  here  as  interventions  in 
which school-aged children deliver the education of other 
pupils for the purposes of improving health outcomes or 
awareness/literacy  relating  to  health,  including  knowl-
edge,  behaviours  and  attitudes.  Interventions  must  have 
taken place within a school, during school hours and must 
be universal, i.e. not targeted towards a specific sub-group 
of students or students with a particular health condition.
Where  comparators/controls  existed,  they  had  to 
include  non-exposure  to  the  interventions  concerned, 
exposure to a differing version of the same intervention, 
or exposure to the intervention within a substantially dif-
fering context.

Papers were excluded from data synthesis if they satis-

fied any of the following criteria:

1)  Peer  education  interventions  only  concerned  academic 

outcomes (e.g., reading and writing achievement).

2)  Interventions concerning anger management, behav-

ioural problems, or social skills.

3)  Interventions  concerning  traffic  safety,  health  and 

safety, avoidance of injuries, or first aid.

4)  Interventions  concerning  cultural,  social  or  political 

awareness (e.g., media literacy).

5)  Interventions in which health outcomes are second-
ary to other outcomes (e.g., interventions focused on 
reading that indirectly improve self-esteem).

6)  One-to-one mentoring interventions.
7)  Conference  abstracts,  research  briefings,  commentar-
ies, editorials, study protocol papers and pre-prints.

Primary outcome(s)

1)  Improvements in health, including health awareness 
and understanding as indicated by responses to ques-
tionnaires.

2)  Reductions in health problems or risk-taking behav-

iours.

or peer learners.

Data extraction, selection and coding

Two reviewers independently screened all papers accord-
ing  to  the  inclusion  criteria  above  using  the  Rayyan 
online  review  platform.  In  cases  where  the  reviewers 
were uncertain, or where the decision was disputed, the 
decision  was  discussed  and  agreed  among  the  wider 
research team. Two reviewers (SD and EW) then divided 
the  papers  between  them  and  independently  extracted 
the  data,  discussing  and  queries  that  arose  with  each 
other and the wider team.

Data extraction included the following:

1)  Bibliographic  details  –  authors,  year  of  publication, 

nation in which intervention was carried out

2)  Aims of the study
3)  Description of study design
4)  Sample size and demographic characteristics.
5)  Context  into  which  the  intervention  is  introduced 
(characteristics  of  the  school  involved,  the  area  in 
which  the  school  is  located,  characterisations  of  the 
student body, relevant policy considerations).

6)  Description  of  intervention  (including  duration  of 

intervention).

7)  Outcome measures (measurement tools, time points 

of data collection).

8)  Data concerning improvements in health.

Quality appraisal

We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) to 
assess quality of reporting procedures. This tool consists 
of  five  specific  quality  rating  items  depending  on  study 
design (qualitative, quantitative randomized, quantitative 
non-randomized,  quantitative  descriptive  and  quantita-
tive  mixed  methods). There  are  5  quality  questions  spe-
cific to each study design, so all papers are rated between 
0  to  5.  The  following  ratings  were  used  to  summarise 
study  quality;  0–1  indicating  poor  quality,  2–3  indicat-
ing average quality and 4–5 indicating high quality. Two 
reviewers  (SD  and  EW)  completed  quality  ratings  on 
each  paper  and  discussed  any  discrepancies  between 
them.

Examples  of  randomized  design  quality  questions 
included  items  such  as:  “Is  randomization  appropriately 
performed? And “Are the groups comparable at baseline?” 
Examples  of  non-randomized  design  quality  questions 
included  items  such  as:  “Are  the  participants  represent-
ative  of  the  target  population?”  and  “Are  there  complete 
outcome data?”

EW and SD completed data synthesis. Due to the volume of 
studies, and the large number and heterogeneity of outcome 
measures,  in  order  to  summarise  effectiveness,  we  created 
the following scoring system to indicate effectiveness:

Significant  effects  are  effects  where  there  was  an 
improvement in health-related outcomes either after the 
peer education intervention, or when compared to a con-
trol group, with a p value of <0.05. Due to the volume of 
studies and varied follow-up periods, we looked at effec-
tiveness at first follow-up, which in the majority of papers 
was immediately post-intervention.

Results
A  total  of  2125  articles  were  identified  after  the  initial 
search  and  73  articles  were  eligible  for  inclusion  (see 
Fig. 1 for a flow diagram of the search). Study designs of 
the  73  articles  were  as  follows:  23  were  controlled  trial 
designs  (15  cluster  or  group  randomised,  6  randomised 
controlled  and  2  non-randomised).  15  used  randomi-
sation  methods  but  were  not  controlled  trials  and  the 
remaining 35 studies used uncontrolled non-randomised 
methods  comparing  intervention  with  a  comparison 
group or using a pre-post survey.

Health and geographical areas

The 73 quantitative papers included in this review dem-
onstrated  a  wide  range  of  health  areas.  The  majority  of 
papers  evaluated  interventions  aimed  at  sex  education/
HIV  prevention  (n  = 23),  promoting  healthy  lifestyles 
(n  = 17)  and  reducing  alcohol,  smoking  and  substance 
use  (n  = 16).  Fig.  2  illustrates  number  of  papers  per 
health  area  by  peer  learner  or  peer  educator  outcome 
focus and Table 2 illustrates a summary of proportion of 
health areas, overall effectiveness and quality ratings.

Papers  mainly  focussed  on  peer  learner  outcomes 
(67/73,  91.8%),  with  only  six  papers  (8.2%)  focussing 
solely  on  peer  educator  outcomes  and  only  five  papers 
(6.8%) reporting on both peer learner and peer educator 
outcomes. The majority of papers that focussed on peer 
educator  outcomes  were  those  concerned  with  sex  edu-
cation (n = 4) and mental health (n = 3).

Papers  typically  reported  knowledge,  attitude  and/or 
behavioural  outcomes.  Of  the  73  papers,  42/73  (57.5%) 
reported knowledge outcomes, 43/73 (58.9%) reported atti-
tude  outcomes,  35/73  (47.9%)  reported  behavioural  out-
comes and 13/73 (17.8%) reported behavioural intentions.

As  well  as  a  broad  range  of  health  areas,  the  papers 
included  in  the  review  also  spanned  several  different 
countries (Fig. 3).

We  have  summarised  the  results  first  by  student  type 

and then by health area.

Four papers had a randomised design comparing inter-
vention vs. control or ‘peer educators vs. classmates’ one 
of  which  was  a  cluster  randomised  controlled  trial.  The 
remaining  7  papers  used  non-randomised  intervention

Results by health area
Sex education/HIV prevention

Twenty-three studies concerned sex education/HIV pre-
vention  [30–52].  9/23  studies  had  a  randomised  design 
with  the  8  studies  comparing  peer-led  to  teacher-led 
or  ‘lessons  as  usual’  and  one  study  comparing  peer-led 
with  nurse-led.  14/23  involved  non-randomised  designs 
comparing  intervention  vs.  control  or  a  pre-post  sur-
vey  design.  Studies  covered  a  wide  geographical  range, 
among  which  there  were  7  US  studies,  but  also  stud-
ies  from  Canada,  UK,  Africa,  South  Africa,  Turkey  and 
Greece.

Of  the  twenty-three  papers,  21  reported  peer  learner 
outcomes,  4  papers  reported  peer  educator  outcomes, 
with 2 papers reporting on both peer educator and peer 
learner  outcomes.  The  mean  number  of  participants 
across the studies was 2033 (range: n = 106–9000).

8/23  (34.8%)  of  studies  showed  evidence  of  effective-
ness,  and  all  studies  demonstrating  effectiveness  con-
sisted  of  knowledge  and  attitude  outcomes  rather  than 
behavioural change.

Only  4/23  studies  were  rated  high  in  quality  (two  of 
which  showed  evidence  of  effectiveness),  whilst  the 
majority  of  studies  were  rated  medium  quality  (15/23) 
and 4/23 rated as low quality.

Healthy lifestyles (exercise, nutrition, oral health, health 
information)

Seventeen  studies  reported  interventions  addressing 
healthy  lifestyles  [53–69].  Of  these  papers,  ten  used  a 
randomised  controlled  trial  design  primarily  comparing 
peer-led vs. teacher-led or ‘lessons as usual’, but two oral 
health  papers  also  used  a  dentist-led  condition.  Seven 
papers  used  non-randomised  research  designs  compar-
ing intervention vs. control or a pre-post survey design.

The  most  common  focus  was  nutrition  and  exercise, 
but  interventions  also  covered  oral  health,  accessing 
health  information  online  and  interventions  taking  a 
more  general  approach  to  health  improvement.  Regard-
ing  geographical  spread,  5/17  papers  reported  interven-
tions carried out in the USA, with Australia, China, India 
and UK represented by two papers per country.

Sixteen  of 

the  seventeen  papers  reported  peer 
learner  outcomes,  and  only  one  reported  peer  educator 

outcomes.  The  mean  number  of  participants  per  inter-
vention was 1245 (range: n = 76–4576).

7/17 papers in this health area were shown to be effec-
tive, 8/17 were found to be ineffective, and 2/17 showed 
mixed  results.  In  other  words,  less  than  half  (41.1%) 
showed  evidence  of  effectiveness.  Of  the  studies  dem-
onstrating  effectiveness,  the  outcomes  largely  centred 
around knowledge and attitudes, but one study did dem-
onstrate positive behaviour change [62].

Over half of the studies (9/17) were rated as high qual-
ity,  4/17  were  rated  medium  quality  and  4/17  low  qual-
ity. Of the studies showing evidence for effectiveness, 4/7 
(57.1%) were rated as high quality.

Alcohol, smoking, substance use

Sixteen  papers  were  classified  within  the  category  of 
alcohol,  smoking  and  substance  use  [70–85].  Ten  of 
these papers had a randomised design (including 3 clus-
ter  randomised  controlled  trials)  comparing  peer-led 
(intervention)  vs.  teacher-led  (control).  Six  papers  were 
non-randomised and used either a pre-post survey design 
or intervention vs. control. The 16 papers varied in qual-
ity with six rated ‘high quality’, seven rated ‘medium qual-
ity’, and three rated ‘low quality’. Studies took place across 
more than 10 countries with one study being conducted 
internationally. The mean number of participants across 
all studies was 2165 (range: n = 105–10,730).

Fifteen  papers  evaluated  the  effect  of  the  intervention 
on peer learner outcomes and only one paper evaluated 
the effect of the intervention on peer educator outcomes. 
8/16 (50%) papers showed evidence of effectiveness. 2/16 
(12.5%)  papers  showed  mixed  findings  and  6/16  (37.5%) 
showed  little  to  no  evidence  for  effectiveness,  including 
the  peer  educator  outcome  paper.  Of  the  eight  papers 
demonstrating evidence for effectiveness, only four (50%) 
were rated as high quality.

Of the studies demonstrating effectiveness, there was a 
combination of knowledge, attitude and behavioural out-
comes, but more evidence for positive changes in knowl-
edge and attitude.

Mental health and well‑being

Six  studies  assessed  mental  health  and  well-being  [27, 
86–90].  This  category  was  inclusive  of  common  men-
tal  health  problems,  self-harm  and  suicide  prevention 
as  well  as  broader  topics  such  as  self-esteem  and  social 
connectedness.  Four  of  the  six  studies  used  non-ran-
domised  pre-post  survey  designs  and  two  studies  used 
randomised  design,  one  of  which  was  a  cluster  ran-
domised controlled trial.

Of  the  six  studies,  5/6  explored  peer  learner  out-
comes, 3/6 explored peer educator outcomes, 2 of which 
explored both peer learner and peer educator outcomes.

The  average  sample  size  across  the  seven  mental  health 
studies was 1118 (range: n = 50–4128).

Study  quality  was  mixed,  with  two  studies  rated  as 
high  quality,  three  medium  quality  and  one  low  qual-
ity.  Outcome  measures  largely  consisted  of  knowledge 
and  attitude  questionnaires,  help-seeking  behaviour  and 
help-seeking  confidence  as  well  as  condition-specific 
measures  including  body  satisfaction  and  self-report  of 
emotional and behavioural difficulties.

The majority of mental health studies (5/6) were rated as 
showing evidence for effectiveness and one study was rated 
ineffective.  Of  the  studies  demonstrating  effectiveness, 
only one reported positive behaviour change (help-seeking 
behaviours)  and  this  behaviour  changed  was  observed  in 
peer educators as opposed to peer learners [86].

Disease prevention

Four  studies  assessed  outcomes  relating  to  disease  pre-
vention  [91–94]  which  included  hepatitis,  tuberculosis, 
cervical  cancer  and  blood  borne  diseases.  All  four  stud-
ies  focused  on  peer  learner  outcomes  and  one  study 
also included peer educator outcomes. Three of the four 
studies  were  non-randomised  pre-post  survey  designs 
and one study was randomised. The average sample size 
across the four studies was 2116 (range: 1265–2930).

Three  out  of  the  four  studies  (75%)  showed  evidence 
for  effectiveness  and  one  study  showed  mixed  results. 
No  studies  were  rated  as  high  quality,  three  were  rated 
medium and one was rated low.

Outcomes  were  largely  knowledge  or  intention  based. 
Studies  showing  effectiveness  mostly  related  to  knowl-
edge,  intentions  and  attitudes  and  one  study  did  find  a 
positive change in behaviour [93].

Asthma

Five  included  studies  assessed  asthma  interventions  [95–
99]. 4/5 of these were randomised trials and one study used 
a non-randomised pre-post survey design. Average sample 
size across all studies was 427 (range: n = 203–935). Three 
studies took place in Australia and two in the US. All papers 
evaluated  the  impact  of  the  intervention  on  peer  learner 
outcomes with none focussing on peer educator outcomes.

4/5  studies  showed  evidence  for  effectiveness  with 
only one study showing no evidence for effectiveness. All 
studies  were  rated  as  medium  quality.  Measures  ranged 
from asthma knowledge, quality of life, school absentee-
ism, asthma attacks at school and asthma tests. Effective-
ness was largely observed for knowledge outcomes, there 
was less evidence for asthma attacks or symptoms.

Bullying

Two studies conducted in Italy assessed bullying by eval-
uating the ‘NoTrap!’ anti-bullying intervention [100, 101]. 

The first study rated as high quality, evaluated two inde-
pendent  trials  and  focussed  on  peer  learner  outcomes 
(n  = 622;  n  = 461).  This  study  found  significant  reduc-
tions  in  victimization,  bullying,  cybervictimization  and 
cyberbullying and was rated as high quality. The second 
study,  rated  as  medium  quality,  focussed  on  peer  edu-
cator  outcomes  (n  = 524)  and  used  a  non-randomised, 
pre-post  survey  design  but  overall,  only  showed  some 
evidence  of  effectiveness  amongst  males  in  terms  of 
reduced victimization and increased prosocial behaviour 
and social support. No evidence was found for effective-
ness among females.

Discussion
Peer  education  interventions  to  improve  student  health 
cover a wide variety of topics and are used globally. This 
review aimed to summarise the results from peer educa-
tion  health  interventions  in  secondary  school  students 
(aged  11–18-years-old),  which  were  universal  (rather 
than  targeted  interventions  of  sub-groups  of  students) 
and carried out at school.

Due  to  the  heterogeneity  of  findings,  range  of  health 
areas,  types  of  studies  and  diversity  of  outcome  meas-
urements  used,  it  was  not  possible  to  perform  a  meta-
analysis  or  formal  data  synthesis  to  assess  effectiveness. 
However, some broad conclusions can be made. A num-
ber of interventions appear to demonstrate evidence for 
effectiveness  which  indicates  that  peer  education  inter-
ventions can be an important school-based intervention 
for health improvement. Asthma interventions appeared 
to  be  particularly  effective.  In  terms  of  outcome  meas-
ures, the strongest evidence was for a positive change in 
knowledge and attitude measures, but there was less evi-
dence overall for health behaviour outcomes which sup-
ports previous findings [20, 22].

Although  many  studies  did  demonstrate  positive 
results,  findings  overall  were  very  mixed  and  several 
studies were of poor quality. In addition to the shortcom-
ings picked up on by our quality appraisal, many papers 
lacked  methodological  detail  and  clarity  regarding  the 
intervention  procedure,  particularly  in  regard  to  how 
peer educators were selected and trained, which seems to 
be an important factor in those studies that found posi-
tive results and was also emphasised in a previous review 
[10].  Further,  there  were  widespread  problems  of  data 
reporting  including  noting  ‘significant’  results  without 
providing  any  measure  of  effect  size  or  between-study 
variability.  Other  problems  included  selective  report-
ing  of  results,  such  as  selective  emphasis  on  anomalous 
positive  results,  or  only  revealing  measures  of  statistical 
significance  in  the  case  of  positive  effects.  Interestingly, 
there  did  not  appear  to  be  a  relationship  between  study 
quality  and  findings,  given  that  several  studies  rated  as 

Dodd et al. BMC Public Health         (2022) 22:2247 

Page 9 of 13

effective were rated both high and low quality with a sim-
ilar  picture  for  studies  showing  mixed  effectiveness  and 
ineffectiveness.

In terms of frequency of health areas covered, our find-
ings  are  similar  to  a  recent  ‘review  of  reviews’  of  peer 
education for health and wellbeing which found that the 
majority  of  reviews  focused  on  sexual  health  and  HIV/
AIDS interventions [13]. This previous review focused on 
both children and adults, however, in line with our find-
ings, it found mixed effectiveness and considerable diver-
sity in methods, findings and rigour of evaluation. It was 
particularly  noted  that  details  of  peer  educator  training 
were  rarely  provided  in  HIV/AIDS  interventions  which 
supports  our  findings.  Notably,  however,  the  quality  of 
studies was actually highest for peer education programs 
in HIV/AIDS, which differed to our review which found 
few  studies  rated  as  high  quality.  This  discrepancy  may 
be  due  to  the  different  measures  used  to  assess  quality. 
Like  our  study,  this  review  concluded  that  each  health 
area  showed  some  promising  results,  but  also  pointed 
to a need for higher levels of quality and rigour in future 
evaluations.

Despite the rising prevalence in mental health difficul-
ties, there were relatively few studies focused on mental 
health  outcomes,  particularly  more  general  preventative 
approaches  to  mental  health  and  well-being,  with  many 
of  the  included  studies  focusing  on  suicide  preven-
tion,  self-harm  or  specific  disorders.  However,  many  of 
mental  health  studies  included  in  this  review  showed 
evidence  for  effectiveness,  suggesting  peer  education 
approaches  for  mental  health  should  be  further  studied 
and evaluated.

Another key finding of our review is that papers tended 
to  focus  more  on  peer  learner  outcomes  and  therefore 
impacts  of  peer-led  interventions  on  peer  educators 
themselves  appear  to  be  under-explored.  This  has  been 
reported  by  previous  reviews  [10]  and  highlights  the 
importance of examining and comparing both peer edu-
cators’ and learners’ outcomes within studies. In this con-
text, we found more evidence of peer learners benefitting 
from  the  interventions,  with  55.2%  of  studies  showing  a 
positive effect, versus only 36.4% for peer educators. This 
contrasted with a previous review of mental health inter-
ventions  that  concluded  peer  educators  seemed  to  yield 
more  benefits  from  participating  in  the  interventions, 
possibly due to the attention they are given during train-
ing and throughout the programmes [10].

Although  common  measures  existed  across  studies, 
including health knowledge, health intentions, and health 
behaviours,  many  studies  used  novel  or  unvalidated 
measurements,  indicating  a  need  for  more  standardised 
health literacy measures and a need for future validation 
work  in  this  area.  This  supports  two  systematic  reviews 

carried  out  in  2015,  firstly  a  review  of  health  literacy 
measures  which  found  a  lack  of  comprehensive  instru-
ments to measure health literacy and suggested the need 
for  the  development  of  new  instruments  [102],  and  sec-
ondly a review of mental health literacy measures which 
found  a  number  of  unvalidated  measures  and  lack  of 
measures that measured all components of mental health 
literacy concurrently [103].

Although  there  are  a  number  of  existing  reviews 
summarising  the  extent  to  which  peer  education  may 
improve young peoples health, the literature is still lack-
ing  on  why  peer  education  is  effective  within  the  quan-
titative  literature.  It  remains  unclear  which  mechanisms 
involved  in  peer  education  lead  to  its  effectiveness  (or 
ineffectiveness).  Although  many  peer  education  stud-
ies  are  grounded  in  theory  such  as  Diffusion  of  Innova-
tion Theory [104] and Bandura’s Social Cognitive/Social 
Learning  Theory  [105,  106],  the  literature  is  lacking  a 
more nuanced analysis of the mechanisms through which 
peer  education  improve  young  people’s  health.  This  is 
therefore a key area for future research.

A recent review of peer education and peer counselling 
for health and well-being highlights how peer education 
interventions  are  inherently  difficult  to  quality  control 
and evaluate [13], partly due to what makes peer educa-
tion  attractive;  peer  education  defies  the  conventions  of 
traditional formal education and allows young people to 
learn  by  more  unstructured  means,  in  more  ‘real  world’ 
ways,  benefiting  from  meaningful  examples  and  conver-
sations  with  their  peers.  Although  there  are  an  increas-
ing  number  of  well-designed  peer  education  studies 
[13],  new  evaluation  methods  may  be  needed  given  the 
complexity  and  multi-component  nature  of  peer-educa-
tion  approaches  (i.e.,  training,  more  informal  teaching 
approaches and informal diffusion of knowledge).

Limitations
Despite  our  review  being  comprehensive,  we  acknowl-
edge  certain  limitations.  ‘Peer  education’  is  a  complex 
and  widely  contested  term  and  therefore  how  studies 
described  their  approach  varied  substantially.  This  may 
have  meant  some  relevant  studies  were  not  picked  up 
from our initial search. A previous review [10] also noted 
this potential limitation, with unclear and heterogeneous 
methods  precluding  meta-analysis.  Therefore,  a  consen-
sus  on  how  to  define  ‘peer  education’  and  using  stand-
ardised  measures  to  assess  effectiveness  would  facilitate 
more definitive synthesis of the evidence. Another poten-
tial  limitation  of  our  approach  is  that  we  only  searched 
scientific  databases,  and  therefore  could  have  missed 
important evidence in the grey literature as we retrieved 
a  relatively  small  number  of  initial  records  (n  = 2125). 
Despite  this,  given  the  wide  variety  of  study  type,  age 

 Dodd et al. BMC Public Health         (2022) 22:2247 

Page 10 of 13

range,  health  area  and  country  reviewed,  this  suggests 
our search strategy was fairly robust, and yielded results 
that were representative of the breadth in the current lit-
erature base.

This review focussed on universal peer education interven-
tions  delivered  within  the  secondary  school  setting  during 
school  hours.  Further  research  could  explore  the  effective-
ness of varying forms of peer education including 1:1 men-
toring,  more  targeted  (not  universal)  interventions,  as  well 
as  peer  education  interventions  in  other  settings  including 
youth clubs or community and local organisations.

Due  to  the  breadth  of  this  review,  we  did  not  conduct 
a  detailed  comparison  between  knowledge,  attitude  and 
behavioural outcomes, however the studies demonstrating 
effectiveness  tended  to  show  positive  change  on  knowl-
edge and attitude outcomes, but less evidence was seen for 
positive  behavioural  change. This  is  in  line  with  previous 
reviews  which  have  suggested  that  peer  education  bet-
ter improves health knowledge but often does not lead to 
behavioural gains [13, 107]. To this vein, it remains unclear 
the differential impact on behavioural intention and actual 
performance  of  behaviour,  and  therefore  we  urge  future 
researchers  to  measure  outcomes  relating  to  knowledge 
and  attitude,  intentions,  and  actual  behaviour  in  order 
to  synthesise  the  evidence  in  a  more  standardised  way. 
Although  the  literature  is  heterogeneous,  there  is  avail-
able data to conduct distinct analysis on different outcome 
measures (knowledge, attitude and behaviour) to create a 
more nuanced understanding of each health area.

Given the large number of studies and variation in out-
come  measures  (behaviour,  knowledge,  attitude),  this 
review  focussed  on  findings  at  first  follow-up  (usually 
immediately after intervention) and therefore the effective-
ness findings are not likely to represent longer-term effects 
of  peer  education  interventions,  which  would  require 
further  research.  In  addition,  due  to  the  low  number  of 
optimally  designed  randomised-controlled  trials  identi-
fied,  our  review  could  not  meaningfully  compare  results 
between  randomised  and  non-randomised  studies.  How-
ever, as more high quality trials continue to be published 
in this growing area of research, a future review could be 
conducted  that  looks  into  the  effect  of  randomisation  on 
young  people’s  outcomes.  Our  results  also  focused  on 
p-values rather than effect sizes due to the large variabil-
ity in how and what studies measures, future researchers 
should aim to agree on more standardises ways of measur-
ing outcomes to enable better synthesis.

Conclusion
To  conclude,  school-based  peer  education  interven-
tions  occur  worldwide  and  span  a  number  of  health 
areas. A number of interventions appear to demonstrate 

evidence  for  effectiveness,  suggesting  peer  education 
may  be  a  promising  strategy  for  health  improvement  in 
schools.  However  overall  evidence  for  effectiveness  and 
study  quality  are  mixed.  Improvement  in  health-related 
knowledge  was  most  common  with  less  evidence  for 
positive  health  behaviour  change.  In  order  to  synthesise 
the  evidence  and  make  more  confident  conclusions,  it 
is  imperative  that  more  robust,  high-quality  evaluations 
of  peer-led  interventions  are  conducted  and  that  stud-
ies follow reporting guidelines to describe their methods 
and results in sufficient detail so that meta-analyses can 
be  conducted.  In  addition,  further  research  is  needed 
to  develop  understanding  of  the  intervention  mecha-
nisms that lead to health improvement in peer education 
approaches as well as more focussed work on standardis-
ing and validating health literacy and behaviour measure-
ment tools.

Pre‑registration

This 
review  was  pre-registered  on  PROSPERO: 
CRD42021229192.  One  deviation  was  made  from  the 
original protocol which was the use of a different quality 
appraisal tool. Initially we had planned to use the Cana-
dian  Effective  Public  Health  Project  Practice  (EPHPP) 
Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies and the 
Critical  Appraisals  Skills  Programme  (CASP)  checklist 
for  qualitative  studies.  The  authors  instead  used  a  com-
bined mixed methods tool (the Mixed Methods Appraisal 
Tool; MMAT) for both quantitative and qualitative stud-
ies.  This  was  due  to  the  large  volume  and  variation  of 
studies which meant there were benefits to using a single 
brief quality check tool across all included studies, allow-
ing us to standardise scores across study types. The quali-
tative studies will be discussed in a separate realist review 
on key mechanisms of peer education interventions.
