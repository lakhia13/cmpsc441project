Health-Care Provider Burnout

Robert Lippy, PhD, ABPP, CDR, MSC, USN

Naval Center for Combat and Operational Stress Control, San Diego, California

Presented at the 56th AmSECT International Conference, San Diego, California, May 1, 2018.

Bob Groom: I just want to say, we’re incredibly indebted
to those that serve in our military like our next two
speakers. Those that sacriﬁce and give up their time and
also endure stresses and things that pale in comparison to
what we encounter.

We’re able to enjoy our daily lives as free because they’re
out doing the bidding of our country in our place. We’re
just really grateful to them, and our next two speakers fall
into that category. The stress that we experience is real, but
I think that some of the stresses that they experience in
service make ours just pale in comparison, but we can really
learn from that.

Our next speaker is Commander Robert Lippy, who is a
clinical psychologist who began his career in the Navy in
1989 as an electronics technician. After 4 years, he received
an Reserve Ofﬁcer Training Corps (ROTC) scholarship to
Oregon State University and he obtained a bachelor of
science degree in psychology. He was commissioned to serve
as a surface warfare ofﬁcer after his time at Oregon State.
Later on, he went to do graduate and postgraduate
studies at the Uniformed Services University of Health
Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. He also went on to do
postgraduate work there following that. From 2008 to 2011,
he was stationed here in San Diego. In 2010, he was
deployed to Afghanistan. He currently serves as the deputy
director of the Naval Center for Combat and Operational
Stress Control. The aim of that group is to optimize psy-
chological readiness, so what a great speaker to come to us.
He’s received numerous awards: Meritorious Service
Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, Navy Achieve-
ment Award, and the Global War on Terrorism Awards.
It’s my pleasure to invite him to come up to speak to us
about health-care provider burnout.

Robert Lippy: Well, good morning everyone. Thank you
for that introduction. And again, thank you AmSECT for
inviting me to this conference. I’ll admit as of a few weeks
ago, I didn’t really know too much about your profession,
so I’ve learned quite a bit and I’m appreciative of that.

I am a Navy clinical psychologist and my current position
is as the Deputy Director of the Naval Center for Combat
and Operational Stress Control. We are a part of the Navy
Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. Having said that, I do not
speak for the Navy Surgeon General or for Navy Medicine;
this presentation reﬂects my personal views only. I also
have no ﬁnancial conﬂicts with this presentation to disclose.
I want to start out by talking a little bit about the concept
of burnout. Burnout is not a new topic. It has been studied
dating back to the 1970s. However, one of the most pre-
eminent contemporary researchers on this topic is a re-
searcher by the name of Dr. Christina Maslach. She’s been
studying this for quite a while, and most researchers and
others use her deﬁnition of burnout.

Dr. Maslach has divided burnout into three domains.
The ﬁrst domain is emotional exhaustion and reﬂects the
most conventional view of burnout, which has to do with
feeling emotionally overextended and exhausted by one’s
work. It is feeling taxed and fatigued with a general lack of
energy for one’s work.

The second domain, depersonalization, has to do with a
lack of feeling or impersonal response toward one’s clients
or patients. It is a cynicism and negative attitude one de-
velops toward one’s clients. Obviously, similar to emotional
exhaustion, this is not a good thing. Dr. Maslach’s third
domain is called personal achievement. In the case of
burnout, this domain refers to feeling a lack of personal
achievement and a general worsening self-conﬁdence that
develops.

Dr. Maslach then created a self-report questionnaire,
appropriately called the Maslach Burnout Inventory or
MBI, to measure these domains of burnout. The MBI is
one of the most commonly used measures of burnout, and
in particular within the health-care profession. This self-
report scale consists of 22 questions scored from 0 to 6
measuring the three burnout domains. Some examples of
items on this questionnaire include the following: “I feel
emotionally drained from my work,” “I have accomplished

P5

P6

many worthwhile things in this job” (reverse scored), and
“I doubt the signiﬁcance of my work.”

Next, I would like to brieﬂy discuss how common
burnout is in the general population and within the health-
care ﬁeld. The study we use here tells us that about 28% of
the U.S. workforce experiences burnout. I like to think of
this percentage as a baseline for comparison to different
groups. The study we used here found the burnout rate
among physicians to be approximately 38%, which is higher
than the general U.S. population ﬁgure. Now, in my ﬁeld of
mental health, studies have found burnout rates from 21 to
67%, a relatively wide range. If averaged out, the rate of
burnout in mental health professionals would appear to
also be higher than that 28% average.

Now shifting to a few studies of military populations, I
want to highlight an army study from 2005 that took place in
a deployed setting. If you recall that was around the height of
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As you can see from this
slide, the rates of burnout were high with around 45% of
providers working in a primary care setting, 33% of mental
health providers, and about 15% of all provider types.

In preparation for this presentation, I searched for
burnout prevalence rates that were more meaningful to this
group of perfusionists. Unfortunately, I did not ﬁnd any
studies of perfusionists. Therefore, I tried to look at areas
that may be closely related to your ﬁeld. I found that some
research has been conducted on anesthesiologists and
found that the burnout rate was about 10 to 42%, which
when averaged out would appear to be somewhat close to
the general population rate of 28%. Given that perfu-
sionists work with surgeons, I looked for studies of that
particular group. The study cited here found rates of 30 to
38%, which is again higher than that baseline U.S. work-
force rate, and similar to the overall rate among physicians
of 38%.

One might conclude from these studies that ‘burnout is
relatively common, and since lots of folks experience it,
what is the big deal?’ Well, these next few slides hopefully
address the “so what’s the big deal?” question. So, what are
the costs and consequences of burnout? Well, as you can
see from this slide, burnout leads to an overall decrease in
quality of care. It can also lead to an increase in medical
errors, not good!

I think it makes intuitive sense how patient satisfaction
can be affected when you consider a provider who has
developed a cynical attitude towards one’s clients. Burnout
also can affect treatment outcomes. We also know that
burnout can affect health-care on a systems level. Research
has found that burnout correlates with higher rates of
absenteeism, job turnover, and as a result of those things,
can lead to decreased access to care. Burnout has also been
found to negatively correlate with overall job performance,
as well as job satisfaction. The bottom line to all of these
things is increased health-care costs.

J Extra Corpor Technol. 2019;51:P5–P9

If the fact that burnout can affect the care you provide
your patients as well as the health-care system is not
motivating, then I hope the fact that burnout can affect one
on a personal level will be motivating. Listed on this slide
are a few individual consequences of burnout to include
higher rates of depression, anxiety, lower quality of life,
lack of empathy, difﬁculty sleeping, substance abuse, and
poor physical health. Motor vehicle crashes is an interesting
and concerning correlate of burnout, as is marital problems.
So, you can see that burnout can have a broad impact. It can
and does impact patient care, the health-care system, and
our own physical and mental health.

Now, I have some questions for the audience. I want you
to think back in the past year and using the ARS live voting
system answer the following question: “Have you experi-
enced any of the following burnout symptoms?” Let’s start
with ﬁrst burnout domain of emotional exhaustion. Re-
member this domain reﬂects that general conception of
feeling burned out, having a lack of energy or feeling fa-
tigued as it relates to your job as a perfusionist. (Pause,
waiting for the audience to vote.) Okay, please stop it there.
As you can see the rates are pretty high.

Let’s move on to the next domain: depersonalization.
Again, think back over the past year, “Have you experienced
a sense of unfeeling, or an impersonal response toward your
clients? A negativity or cynicism? A general lack of em-
pathy?” (Another pause, waiting for the audience to vote.)
Okay, it looks like the voting has mostly been completed, so
we will stop it there and move on to the next question.

Again, thinking back over the past year, “How much
have you felt a sense of low personal accomplishment? In
other words, have you felt you were not as competent as
you would like to be, maybe not as successful as a perfu-
sionist as you might like to be?” (Another pause, waiting
for the audience to vote.) Okay, it looks like we have
reached a consensus there, so on to the next slide please.
Given the results of the voting we just witnessed I am
curious what the audience thinks of those rates. To me,
these results could be a bit surprising given what we learned
in the previous presentation about perfusionists generally
enjoying their work. I noticed a similarity with the previous
studies about mental health providers. It would appear that
although we all enjoy what we do, that work comes at a
cost, which is that despite high satisfaction, we are still
susceptible to burnout.

Now, I would like to switch gears and talk brieﬂy about a
couple of projects that we’ve been involved in at our Naval
Center for Combat and Operational Stress Control. One is
a survey of my community of navy psychologists. The
second one is a staff wellness survey we conducted right
here in San Diego at our Naval Medical Center, San Diego,
that surveyed the entire hospital.

With regard to the navy psychologist survey, our com-
munity is relatively evenly split between active duty and

HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER BURNOUT

P7

civilian psychologists. However, on this survey, most of the
respondents were active duty. The breakdown is listed
there, O-3 is a Lieutenant, O-4 a Lieutenant Commander,
O-5 and O-6 are Commander and Captain, respectively. So,
from these demographics, you can see that the majority of
our respondents were relatively lower ranking psycholo-
gists. You can see the average time practicing psychology
was approximately 6 years.

In this survey, we used the Maslach Burnout Inventory
discussed earlier. We found a high percentage, 41%, on the
emotional exhaustion domain. On the depersonalization
subscale, we found lower rates. And on the personal
achievement subscale, we ﬁnd high rates, again a good
thing. If we compare this to the audience survey results
earlier, I think it is somewhat similar. Most perfusionists
and navy psychologists tend to experience a high amount of
personal achievement, low depersonalization, but a fair
amount of emotional exhaustion.

The second survey here as I mentioned was conducted at
our Naval Medical Center, San Diego, in 2017. This is our
big hospital up on the hill here. It’s actually our largest
hospital in the Navy. As you can see we again used the
Maslach Burnout Inventory. I am not going to go into much
detail on the demographics of the sample other than to say
it was a relatively representative sample of the hospital
population.

On the personal achievement subscale, the majority
reported a medium to high sense of personal achievement.
On the depersonalization scale, we found a low amount
reported. And then on the emotional exhaustion scale,
respondents reported a high amount, with 38% in the high
range of the scale.

One of things that we looked at in this study was the
comparison between active duty and civilians respondents.
We did that because we often expect differences in these
two groups. The reason this is an area of particular interest
to us is because as Mr. Groom pointed out earlier, our
active duty population experience some unique challenges.
For example, deployments and long separations from
family. Also, there is an inherent expectation for our active
duty to take on a lot of collateral duties, so we wanted to
look at some of those differences.

One of the things we discovered from this particular
survey is that our active duty staff report that they perform
best when their work is exciting, rewarding, and they have a
good work–life balance. On our civilian side, we found that
they perform best when they have opportunities for pro-
motion and are satisﬁed with their collateral duties. Our
providers perform best when they have general job satis-
faction and experience minimal work–family conﬂict.

The main takeaways from these two studies is that there
appears to be higher levels of emotional exhaustion within
our navy psychologists and at Naval Medical Center, San
Diego, but despite that both groups report higher levels of

Personal Achievement than the general U.S. population
samples. It is a bit of an interesting phenomenon that we
tend to feel more burned out, but at the same time, there is
a lot of satisfaction from what we do.

Now that we learned a bit about the prevalence of
burnout and some of its consequence, I am going to shift
gears again and discuss what we can do to try and prevent
burnout. What follows are just a couple of the projects that
we’ve been involved in at my place of work at the Naval
Center for Combat Operational Stress Control.

The ﬁrst program is called Caregiver Occupational Stress
Control or CgOSC for short. This is a program that was
developed about 3 or 4 years ago. It’s based on evidence
informed stress management principles. The CgOSC
program starts with a 4-day train-the-trainer course. My
staff members at NCCOSC have trained teams at almost all
of our Navy hospitals throughout the world. The process is
that we teach a small cohort of health-care providers who
then return to their hospitals and train their own staff. One
of the important facets about this particular program is that
it involves pre-clinical
interventions. As a psychologist
that’s something that we really stress, is that this isn’t a
clinical tool. That is to say, this program is not about
treating clinical disorders. The general principle is to train
staff on how to recognize signs of stress and burnout within
themselves and teach them some basic stress management
skills and then to recognize those same signs within their
peers and assist their peers in managing their stress levels.
I would like to brieﬂy discuss some of the key compo-
nents of the CgOSC program. As I mentioned one key
component is learning various individual stress manage-
ment skills such as deep breathing, problem solving, pos-
itive thinking, and living according to important values. We
teach people how to develop personalized self-care plans.
We also teach our leaders actions they can take to help
mitigate stress in their subordinates, as well as how to
intervene when someone is in acute crisis, as well how to
bolster individual resilience in their subordinates.

We also teach staff how to conduct stress assessments of
units within their organization. When units, individual de-
partments, or clinics are experiencing high rates of burnout or
stress, they can elect to have CgOSC team members come
into the unit and conduct an assessment of the unit’s strengths,
weaknesses, and then provide actionable recommendations
on how to improve that unit’s overall morale and resilience.
The foundation of the CgOSC program is something we
call the stress continuum. The purpose of the stress con-
tinuum is to give everyone a common language for under-
standing and describing stress levels. I like to think of the
stress continuum as a continuum of psychological health.
The left far end of the continuum is the green zone and
reﬂects the goal where we want to be. When we are in the
green zone we are physically and mentally healthy, ready,
nourished, getting good sleep, etc.

The reality is that we do not stay in the green zone for
inherently experience daily
very long because we all
stressors that push us into the yellow or reacting zone. The
yellow zone is likely where the majority of people spend a
large amount of time, which means it is entirely normal to
be in the yellow zone. Signs of being in the yellow zone
include irritability, sleep problems, concentration prob-
lems, and perhaps getting into arguments. Again, re-
member that it is completely normal to experience yellow
zone stress levels.

Moving to the right on the stress continuum, if a par-
ticular stressor persists or you experience a signiﬁcant acute
stressor that can actually push you into the orange/injured
zone. This is where it’s starting to become more serious and
individuals may begin experiencing clinical mental health
symptoms like panic attacks, nightmares, shame, guilt, or
blame.

On the far right of the stress continuum is the red/ill zone.
If the same stressor or stressors continue to persist without
intervention or an individual experiences a signiﬁcant
traumatic event, then that may push the individual into the
red/ill zone. That’s really this clinical zone that you start to
get into the realm of formal mental health treatment, which
involves treatment of clinical conditions that may have
developed such as post-traumatic stress disorder, which Dr.
Kraft is going to talk about here shortly. But, also things
like major depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.

The chart running along the bottom of the stress con-
tinuum reﬂects levels of responsibility for intervention. We
as individuals are most responsible and in the best position
for keeping ourselves in the green and yellow zones. As we
start to move up the continuum, as our stress increases,
then we may need the assistance of our peers or our family
to help recognize our increasing stress and help intervene
on our behalf to help get us back into the yellow and green
zones. When we get into the orange and red zones, is when
it will likely require the help of a professional caregiver to
help restore our psychological health.

This slide lists some signs of burnout broken down into
ﬁve domains: mind, body, spirit, social, and behavioral.
Please notice the parallel of these signs with the orange and
red zones of the stress continuum. Within the mind domain,
you should notice some of the things we have already
talked about, such as anxiety, irritability, sadness, guilt, and
depression. Within the body domain, signs of burnout can
include body complaints, sleep problems, and fatigue. In
the spiritual domain, burnout can lead to questioning one’s
faith, helplessness, or hopelessness. Social domain signs
can include withdrawing or interpersonal conﬂicts. ‘Pre-
senteeism’ means zoning out in a conversation. And then,
you can see lots of examples of burnout within the be-
havioral domain.

Now it’s time to do some more audience polling. How
many of signs of burnout just listed have you experienced in

J Extra Corpor Technol. 2019;51:P5–P9

the past month? Please ﬂip back to that last slide and now
as you look at the slide, think back in the last month, and
now count how many of those burnout signs/symptoms that
you experienced, even to a small degree. Once you have
that ﬁnal number, please vote. (Pause, while audience
votes.) It appears just about everyone has voted. I want to
say I appreciate your honesty. Although this is anonymous,
it still takes some courage to admit that you may be ex-
periencing some of these.

When I reviewed the new guidelines, I noticed that one
involved ‘on call duty.’ Therefore, that was something that
myself and Mr. Groom were interested in learning more
about. So, please vote “Yes” if you felt like your ‘on call
duty’ has contributed to burnout. (Pause, while audience
votes.) Looks like we’ve reached the steady state there, so
80% of those who voted felt like being on call contributed
to some burnout.

And then, the other new guideline that I read about is for
8 hours of rest for every 16-hour consecutive work period.
The question is “how much do you adhere to that guide-
line?” Responses include “Always or most of the time,”
“Some of the time,” or “Nearly none of the time.” (Pause,
while audience votes.) Very interesting.

I am going to wrap up this presentation by brieﬂy dis-
cussing some of the individual resilience topics that we
teach as part of our CgOSC program that I previously
discussed. Everything that we teach here is not new or
novel. These are all evidence-informed principles in the
ﬁeld of psychological health, resilience, and stress man-
agement. Some of the more common skills that we’re
teaching are basic optimism and ﬂexible thinking. Some-
thing that we ﬁnd is that many individuals just get stuck in
these ruts of having very negativistic thinking, which can
have negative emotional consequences.

Mindfulness is another basic, but highly effective resil-
ience skill. Just by a show of hands, how many folks are
familiar with mindfulness or have heard of it? Okay, some.
That’s actually encouraging. Mindfulness is focused at-
tention on the present moment in a non-judgmental way. It
sounds very simple, but I can tell you, it’s very hard to do
and actually quite complex. All of these skills here, and I’ll
emphasize the word skills, are things that just like any skill
can be learned. And like any other skill, the more you
practice them the better you get at them. Mindfulness is one
of those that takes a lot of practice.

We also teach positive coping. We talk a little bit about
control, which involves learning when and how to change
things versus understanding that we can manage our stress
better by accepting things that are outside our control.
Again, these are just some examples of the topics that we
teach that are designed to expand individual resilience
skills.

We also teach people about Self-Care. Self-care is dif-
ferent than self-pampering, which includes things like

HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER BURNOUT

P9

eating chocolate, drinking beer, or ‘vegging out’ and
watching your favorite TV show. Certainly, those things
feel good and can help us control some of our stress.
However, self-care represents more of a deliberate action.
It’s actually developing the self-care plan that balances
what you already do with a few things that are good for you
that you may not be that inclined to do. What is a self-care
plan? It’s a systematic approach to identifying warning
signs of stress and burnout in those four self-care domains.
We mentioned those earlier. To be self-aware, which is a
must for self-care involves identifying your strengths and
weaknesses. They’ll help you understand your reactions in
speciﬁc and overall stressful situations. The idea here is not
to eliminate stress but actually to help you manage stress
rather than being overwhelmed by your emotions.

One of the nice things about these various resilience
skills that I just mentioned is that they are all very portable.
In other words, they are all skills that you can do almost
anywhere, in any place, and at any time. Compared to say
something like golf, which although a deliberate action that
could be very relaxing to someone, still requires a certain
time, place, and props to do it.

The other key to developing a self-care plan is to make a
commitment to yourself. It also involves a break in the
conspiracy of silence. This is something that we ﬁnd we’re
all susceptible to. We get stressed and we feel like we have
to hold that in and not talk with others. I admit as a psy-
chologist, I’m probably biased that talking actually is very
helpful.

The second program that we developed at our Naval
Center for Combat and Operational Stress Control is called
Mind Body Resilience Training (MBRT). This program
has a lot of overlap with our CgOSC program, but it has a
few differences. Whereas the CgOSC program is designed
primarily for use within our hospitals and our health-care
providers, MBRT was actually designed to be used by any
sailor or marine in the operational environments where
they work, our assault ships here in San Diego just last year.
MBRT was actually born out of the request from a
Commanding Ofﬁcer on one of the ships in San Diego to
develop a training program to help them become more
resilient. That request was a unique watershed moment for
us because historically, our operational commanders focus
almost exclusively on operational issues such as weapons
systems and tactics and how to keep their ship materially
ready. However, our line commanders are now starting to
realize that without resilient sailors and marines, they

cannot fully execute their mission. Therefore, from a
medical/psychological perspective, it is very exciting to see
our operational colleagues now really taking these prin-
ciples to heart and asking for resilience programs like these.
So, I just brieﬂy want to highlight some of the compo-
nents of the MBRT program. You can see some of the
overlap with our CgOSC program. But some of the unique
components of MBRT include mindfulness, meditation, as
well as communication skills. We talk about problem-
solving, and we actually talk about values because your
values can also affect your resilience level.

We also include a couple of optional modules in MBRT.
One module is all about the importance of sleep and sleep
hygiene. The other module is all about leadership and how
effective leadership positively affects stress management.
The MBRT program, like the CgOSC program, uses a
train-the-trainer model. In this case, we teach members of
operational units, who then go back and teach these skills
to their unit members. We also encourage units to tailor
MBRT based on their unique operating environments. For
example, on a ship, we don’t expect them to teach the full
MBRT program in a full day and teach this to everyone on
the ship and then to practice this every day. That’s just not
practical. So, we give them the tools we say, “Adapt this to
your environment.” Our preliminary results from this are
promising. We found that the sailors who have gone
through MBRT like the program, understand the material,
and are taking these concepts and practicing them and
noticing beneﬁts from it.

The last module is about leadership. That’s an important
component. I am sure many of the audience members are
leaders in your ﬁeld. Leadership has a key component in
preventing burnout. This topic emphasizes good leadership
principles, such as being empathic and being a good
communicator. It also includes valuing the people that
work for you, providing them that positive feedback, and
being transparent about the organization.

Well, that concludes my presentation. However, I have
one last question which is “Given what I’ve talked about
this afternoon, are you committed to building a self-care
plan to help balance your work–life demands?” (Pause,
while audience votes.) Looks like the votes are in. Thank
you again very much for your time and I hope you learned
something from this presentation.

Bob Groom: Thank you Commander Lippy. That was
outstanding and we’ll bring you up in a little bit for
discussion.
