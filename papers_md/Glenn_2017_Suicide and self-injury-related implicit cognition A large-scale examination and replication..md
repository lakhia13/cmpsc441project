Abstract

Suicide and self-injury are difficult to predict because at-risk individuals are often unable or 
unwilling to report their intentions. Therefore, tools to reliably assess risk without reliance on self-
report are critically needed. Prior research suggests that people who engage in suicidal and 
nonsuicidal self-injury often implicitly (i.e., outside conscious control) associate themselves with 
self-harm and death, indicating that self-harm-related implicit cognition may serve as a useful 
behavioral marker for suicide risk. However, earlier studies left several critical questions about the 
robustness, sensitivity, and specificity of self-harm-related implicit associations unaddressed. We 
recruited a large sample of participants (N=7,015) via a public web-based platform called Project 
Implicit Mental Health to test several hypotheses about self-harm-related implicit associations 
using the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Participants were randomly assigned to complete one of 
three self-harm IATs (Self + Cutting using picture stimuli, Self + Suicide using word stimuli, Self 
+ Death using word stimuli). Results replicated prior studies demonstrating that self-harm-related 
implicit associations were stronger among individuals with (vs. without) a history of suicide 
attempt and nonsuicidal self-injury. Results also suggested that self-harm-related implicit 
associations are robust (based on internal replication), are sensitive to recency and severity of self-
harm history (e.g., stronger associations for more recent and more lethal prior suicide attempts), 
and correlate with specific types of self-harm behaviors. These findings clarify the nature of self-
harm-related implicit cognition and highlight the IAT's potential to track current risk for specific 
types of self-harm in ways that more fixed risk factors cannot.

Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for more deaths than by all 
interpersonal violence combined (Nock, Borges, & Ono, 2012). In the United States, suicide 
is responsible for over 40,000 deaths each year (1.6% of all mortality), making it the 10th 
leading cause of death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). In addition, the 
lifetime rate of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI; self-harming behavior performed with no 
intent to die) is estimated at 5-6% among adults (Swannell, Martin, Page, Hasking, & St 
John, 2014). Although rarely lethal in itself, NSSI can cause severe lasting damage to body 
tissue and also is a robust predictor of future suicide attempt, even greater than many other 
well-established risk factors, such as depression and anxiety (Asarnow et al., 2011; 
Wilkinson, Kelvin, Roberts, Dubicka, & Goodyer, 2011).

Despite the serious nature and relatively high prevalence of self-harm (a term we will use to 
encompass self-harming behaviors both with and without intent to die), clinical 
psychological science has not yet produced the tools to accurately measure and predict 
suicidal thoughts and behavior. Much of the difficulty in doing so can be attributed to the 
near universal reliance on self-report, which is a crucial source of information for assessing 
suicide risk but also is limited for several reasons. First, unlike for other less sensitive or 
stigmatized behaviors, those at greatest risk may be intentionally motivated to conceal their 
thoughts (e.g., to avoid or gain release from hospitalization). Indeed, one study found that 
78% of inpatients denied suicidal thoughts during the last verbal communication they had 
prior to killing themselves (Busch, Fawcett, & Jacobs, 2003). Second, people may lack the 
ability to accurately assess the factors impacting their current risk, either due to the transient 
nature of suicidal thoughts or a lack of conscious awareness (Wilson, 2009). As such, there 
is an urgent need for risk assessment tools that do not exclusively rely on, and can serve to 
supplement, self-report.

To overcome limitations of self-report, researchers have attempted to identify objective 
markers of suicide risk using behavioral tools, such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT; 
Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). The IAT is a computer-administered implicit 
measure that is intended to tap into attitudes operating more automatically, i.e., outside of 
conscious control and at a different level of processing, than explicit measures (Fazio & 
Olson, 2003). Major advantages of the IAT are that it is brief, easy to administer, and less 
susceptible to social desirability bias than explicit self-reports (Greenwald, Nosek, & Banaji, 
2003). Indeed, a meta-analysis of studies using the IAT across a wide variety of social 
domains found that the IAT was incrementally predictive beyond self-report, especially so 
for socially sensitive topics such as racially discriminatory behavior (Greenwald, Poehlman, 
Uhlmann, & Banaji, 2009). Although there is debate in the social psychology literature 
regarding the strength and significance of the IAT's predictive validity and its ability to 
reliably predict behaviors on an individual level (e.g., for a recent exchange on this topic, see 
Greenwald, Banaji, & Nosek, 2015 and Oswald, Mitchell, Blanton, Jaccard, & Tetlock, 
2015), prior research has consistently supported the notion that implicit association 
measures provide unique information above, and at least partially distinct from, explicit self-
report.

Several recent studies have suggested that the IAT can be used to measure implicit cognition 
about self-harm and, in doing so, may help to improve the prediction and prevention of this

behavior. These initial studies have suggested that self-harm IATs measuring the extent to 
which people associate NSSI and death/suicide with the self can both distinguish those 
engaging in self-harm from non-self-harming control participants and be used to improve the 
prediction of future self-harm above and beyond other well-known predictors (Cha et al., 
2016; Glenn, Kleiman, Cha, Nock, & Prinstein, 2015; Nock & Banaji, 2007a; Nock & 
Banaji, 2007b; Nock et al., 2010; Randall, Rowe, Dong, Nock, & Colman, 2013).

Although findings to date suggest that measures of implicit cognition can be used as 
behavioral markers that increase our ability to identify those at greatest risk for self-harm, 
several key questions remain regarding the measurement of self-harm-related implicit 
cognition. The greatest limitation of prior studies in this area is that they have used relatively 
small samples. It is well-documented that studies with low statistical power can lead not 
only to a failure to detect a true effect, but also to a reduction in the likelihood that any 
significant effect is representative of the true effect in the population (Button et al., 2013). 
This is especially concerning in the study of suicidal and self-injurious behaviors, where the 
outcomes of interest can involve serious human injury or death. Thus, it is imperative to 
have an accurate estimate of the magnitude and nature of the associations between implicit 
cognition and different forms of self-harm. The primary aim of this study was to collect data 
on the association between self-harm-related implicit cognition and a history of engaging in 
self-harm. Consistent with recent recommendations regarding the importance of sufficiently 
powered studies as well as replication of observed effects (Button et al., 2013; Nosek, Spies, 
& Motyl, 2012; Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom, van der Maas, & Kievit, 2012), we 
sought to collect data from a large unselected sample of participants, and to replicate all tests 
conducted to assess the reliability of our findings.

Prior studies suggest that implicit cognition about self-harm differs between those who 
engage in this behavior and those who do not; however, a vital and unanswered question is 
the extent to which implicit cognition about self-harm is malleable and changes over time. 
Although there is some debate about the nature of observed malleability in the IAT literature 
(e.g., attitude malleability vs. measurement malleability; Han, Czellar, Olson, & Fazio, 
2010), numerous studies have shown that the IAT can track attitudinal change (although 
often weakly; Joy-Gaba & Nosek, 2010) and show change over treatment in clinical 
populations (e.g., Teachman, Marker, & Smith-Janik, 2008; Teachman & Woody, 2003). We 
do not yet know whether implicit self-harm attitudes change over time. The finding that 
implicit associations with self-harm differ as a function of recency of behavioral engagement 
(e.g., how long ago one attempted suicide) would indicate the IAT's potential capability to 
track history of self-harm and, by extension, imminence of risk (given more recent 
engagement may mean higher current risk). A related question about self-harm-related 
implicit cognition is whether it is associated with the frequency or severity of self-harm 
behavior.

Due to small sample sizes and a limited number of IAT versions administered per study, no 
studies have yet addressed the issue of the self-harm IAT's ability to distinguish between 
specific types of self-harm (e.g., with vs. without intent to die). One prior study found that a 
self-injury IAT using NSSI pictures differentiated between individuals with a prior suicide 
attempt, those with prior suicide ideation but no attempt, and those with no history of

ideation or attempt (Nock & Banaji, 2007b). However, given the high comorbidity between 
suicide ideation/attempts and NSSI, it is not clear whether self-harm in general, or suicidal 
thoughts and behaviors (or NSSI) specifically, explain these prior findings demonstrating 
group differences. Better understanding the specificity of the associations between different 
versions of the IAT and specific self-harm behaviors would allow us to tailor IATs to 
produce the strongest effects within a given population and thereby maximize their utility as 
risk assessment tools.

The purpose of this study was to test the magnitude and nature of the associations between 
self-harm-related implicit cognition and engagement in self-harm to answer four open 
questions: (1) do self-harm-related implicit cognitions differ between those with vs. without 
a history of different forms of self-harm (replicating the results from earlier studies)?, (2) do 
these effects differ by recency of self-harm?, (3) do these effects differ by frequency or 
severity of self-harm?, and (4) is there specificity between different versions of the IAT and 
specific forms of self-harm (e.g., suicidal vs. nonsuicidal)? We tested these questions by 
collecting data from a large, unselected sample of participants via a publicly accessible, 
web-based platform called Project Implicit Mental Health (PIMH), and examined the 
robustness of the findings by internally replicating all analyses.

Method

Participants

Measures1

Participants were 7,015 adult volunteers who consented to participate and completed at least 
one IAT at the Project Implicit Mental Health (PIMH) research website 
(www.ImplicitMentalHealth.com) between March 2012 and October 2014. The PIMH 
website allows users to explore mental health-related IATs. Participants included in this 
study are those who chose to complete a Self-harm IAT and were randomly assigned to one 
of three IATs (described below): Self-Injury (n=2,332), Death (n=2,298), and Suicide 
(n=2,385). Demographic characteristics by IAT subsample are provided in Table 1. Adult 
participants who consented but did not complete an IAT (n=2,905) were excluded from 
analyses. Part way through data collection (i.e., after 776 consenting participants), the 
consent form was updated to include a question regarding the participant's age; individuals 
under the age of 18 (n=169) also were excluded due to minors’ inability to give informed 
consent.

Sociodemographics—Sociodemographic information was collected from participants, 
including age, ethnicity, race, education, and country of residence.

Implicit cognition—Implicit cognition about self-harm was measured using the IAT (IAT; 
Greenwald et al., 1998), a task that uses reaction times when classifying different stimuli to 
measure the automatic mental associations they hold between concepts and attributes (e.g., 
suicide = me). Three different self-harm IATs used in prior studies were examined: the Self-

are not central to current hypotheses or were reported elsewhere. Those data are available upon request from the corresponding author.

Injury IAT, Death IAT, and Suicide IAT, each of which used the standard IAT structure to 
measure the extent to which participants associated self-harm-related constructs (i.e., death/
suicide and self-injury) with the self (see Appendix for complete stimulus sets).

During the IAT, participants sort words (or images) one at a time into superordinate 
categories presented in the top left and right corners of the screen by pressing corresponding 
keys on the keyboard. For example, in one critical category pairing condition, participants 
may see death + me paired in the upper left corner and life + not me paired in the upper right 
corner. As stimuli related to each of these four categories appear one at a time in the center 
of the screen, participants sort them as quickly as possible into their superordinate categories 
by pressing a key on the left of the keyboard (“E”) for death or me words (e.g., “dead,” 
“self,” “suicide,” “myself”) and a key on the right (“I”) for life or not me words (e.g., 
“alive,” “them,” “thrive,” “their”). They then complete an analogous sorting task for the 
other critical category pairing condition in which life + me are paired together and death + 
not me are paired together. We followed the standard 7-block IAT structure and scoring 
procedure (Greenwald et al., 2003), and calculated a D score for each person on each IAT in 
which positive scores represent a stronger association between self-harm and self (e.g., faster 
responding when death and me are paired to the same key relative to when life and me are 
paired), and negative scores represent a stronger association between non-self-harm and self.

Self-harming thoughts and behaviors—Participants’ history of self-injurious thoughts 
and behaviors was assessed using an abbreviated (20-item) self-report version of the Self-
Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI; Nock, Holmberg, Photos, & Michel, 
2007). Questions assessed history of nonsuicidal self-injury (“Have you ever done anything 
to purposely hurt yourself without wanting to die [for example cutting or burning your 
skin]?”), suicidal thoughts (“Have you ever had thoughts of killing yourself?”), suicide plans 
(“Have you ever actually made a plan to kill yourself?”), and suicide attempts (“Have you 
ever made an actual suicide attempt, where you wanted to kill yourself, even just a little?” 
and, to identify the subset of attempts requiring medical attention, “If you have ever 
attempted suicide, did any attempt result in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had to be 
treated by a doctor or nurse?”). Individuals were asked to rate the frequency of each 
behavior within their lifetime, the past year, and the past week. The interview version of the 
SITBI, which uses the same wording as this self-report version, has shown strong test-retest 
and interrater reliability, as well as concurrent validity in US, German, and Spanish samples 
(Fischer et al., 2014; García-Nieto, Blasco-Fontecilla, Yepes, & Baca-García, 2013; Nock et 
al., 2007). Further, these items are very similar to those included in the most widely-used 
self-report measures of the same constructs (e.g., Youth Risk Behavior Survey [YRBS], 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS], World Mental Health Composite 
International Diagnostic Interview [WMH-CIDI] Suicide Module). Participants were also 
asked about current desire to harm oneself and desire to die as part of managing current risk 
(see Procedure).

Notably, while we recognize the limits of relying on self-report measures of these behaviors, 
prior research suggests participants are more comfortable and willing to report sensitive 
information online (e.g., Shapiro, Chandler, & Mueller, 2013). Therefore, we believe the 
anonymous nature of the study actually makes it less likely that participants’ responses were

influenced by efforts at impression management compared to clinical or lab settings (where 
participants might fear their responses could lead to unwanted interventions or 
hospitalization).

Procedure

After launching the PIMH website, we posted links to it on the main Project Implicit site 
(www.ProjectImplicit.com) and our academic websites, and we referenced it in academic 
and public talks and in news stories about the topics assessed by the PIMH tests. Participants 
visiting the PIMH site were presented with informed consent agreements, which included: 
information regarding PIMH's privacy policy, mental health resources, and contact 
information for the primary investigators.

Following informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to complete one of the 
three IATs (Self-Injury IAT, Death IAT, or Suicide IAT), sociodemographic questionnaire, 
and SITBI in a random order. After the final task, participants were shown the first 
debriefing page, with information regarding the purpose of the study. Participants were then 
given the option of viewing their IAT feedback on the following page (e.g., “Your responses 
show that you sorted words much faster when CUTTING and ME were paired on the same 
key (relative to CUTTING and NOT ME), which suggests that you may have a strong 
implicit association between self-injury and yourself.”). If an individual responded to any 
item regarding current desire to die/hurt oneself with “extremely,” he or she received a 
special note on the first debriefing page: “Your responses on the survey you filled out 
suggest that you may want to hurt yourself or die. We are concerned that you are having 
these thoughts. We encourage you to contact someone who can help you cope with these 
thoughts and with any stressful events that may have caused them.” Additional mental health 
resource information was provided below this note. This study was approved by the Harvard 
University, University of Virginia, and University of Washington institutional review boards.

Data Analytic Plan

All implicit association measures were scored following recommendations from Greenwald 
et al. (2003). Scoring algorithms create an IAT D score, which is the difference between 
response latencies for the two critical category pairing conditions, divided by the standard 
deviations across all blocks. The D score is conceptually similar to a Cohen's d effect size. 
Based on these scoring guidelines (e.g., cut points to exclude data with high error rates or 
too many fast trials2), we excluded the following: 269 (11.5%) participants’ Self-Injury IAT 
data, 256 (11.1%) participants’ Death IAT data, and 261 (10.9%) participants’ Suicide IAT 
data. Exclusion rates were comparable to previous web-based IAT studies (see Nosek et al., 
2007, for the typical range of exclusion rates).

Prior to performing analyses, all study variables were checked for missing data, normality, 
and outliers. To adjust for moderate positive skewness among IAT D scores, a log 
transformation (with the addition of a constant of 2.58 so that the lowest value was equal to 

2Specifically, IAT scores meeting any of the following criteria were excluded: (a) missing all trials from a block; (b) greater than 10% 
of trial reaction times faster than 300 ms overall; (c) greater than 25% of trial reaction times faster than 300 ms in any critical block; 
(d) greater than 30% trial errors overall; (e) greater than 40% trial errors in any critical block.

1) was performed. To adjust for moderate positive skewness among the NSSI and suicide 
attempt frequency variables (restricted to participants reporting lifetime NSSI and suicide 
attempt, respectively, only), log transformations were performed. In each case, the resulting 
transformed data closely approximated a normal distribution (skewness between −2 and +2) 
and were used in all statistical analyses (Nolan, Heinzen, & Weathersby, 2008). Figures 
reflect participants’ untransformed IAT D scores in order to retain the conceptual meaning of 
the D score (e.g., score greater than zero indicates stronger association between self-harm 
and the self compared to non-self-harm and the self).

Median absolute deviation (MAD) was used to identify extreme outliers in the IAT D score 
and frequency of self-harming behaviors variables. MAD is a more robust dispersion 
statistic than standard deviation, which is particularly influenced by outliers, and offers an 
alternative to traditional outlier detection practices (Leys, Ley, Klein, Bernard, & Licata, 
2013). Following Leys et al. (2013), the following cases with a MAD of 3 or more were 
identified from the variables for final analyses: 1 (<0.1%) of IAT D scores overall, 29 (0.9%) 
of NSSI lifetime frequency, and 11 (0.7%) of suicide attempt lifetime frequency. To reduce 
their influence, outliers were reassigned values of the closest most extreme non-outlier 
(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). Subsequent results did not significantly change when analyses 
were performed with and without outliers included; therefore, we included the outliers in our 
analyses. Internal consistency of the IAT was very high; the Spearman-Brown corrected 
split-half reliability, determined from D scores calculated separately for odd and even trials, 
was r(6628)= .91, similar to other IATs administered previously using a similar platform 
(rs=.89-.92; Greenwald & Nosek, 2001).

Following data reduction and cleaning, preliminary analyses were performed to test whether 
demographic differences existed among the entire sample based on lifetime presence of self-
harm (i.e., NSSI, suicide ideation, suicide attempt) using chi-square tests for categorical 
measures and t tests for continuous measures. We then conducted analyses to test each of our 
four research questions.

First, we tested whether self-harm-related implicit cognition differs between those with vs. 
without a history of self-harm (i.e., NSSI vs. no such history; suicide attempt vs. no such 
history) using independent samples t tests. To provide additional context regarding the 
degree to which the IAT is predictive of group status based on self-harm history, receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed as follow-up analyses for IATs 
exhibiting the strongest effects. In addition to determining the area under the curve (AUC) 
for each ROC plot, four additional terms were calculated: sensitivity (proportion of 
participants with an actual history of self-harm correctly identified by the IAT [i.e., D score 
> 0]), specificity (proportion of participants without a history of self-harm correctly 
identified by the test [i.e., D score < 0]), positive predictive value (proportion of individuals 
with a positive test who were correctly classified as having a history of self-harm), and 
negative predictive value (proportion of individuals with a negative test who were correctly 
classified as having no history of self-harm). To perform these calculations, IAT scores were 
dichotomized using a cut point of 0 to indicate neither an association between self-harm and 
the self (D score > 0) nor between non-self-harm and the self (D score < 0), a similar 
approach to those used in prior studies (e.g., Nock et al., 2010; Randall et al., 2013).

Second, we tested whether implicit associations between self-harm and the self differ as a 
function of recency of participants’ engagement in self-harm using factorial ANOVAs and 
post hoc comparisons. Specifically, for NSSI, we performed a 4 (NSSI recency group: past 
week NSSI, past year but not past week NSSI, lifetime but not past year NSSI, no lifetime 
NSSI) × 3 (IAT version: Self-Injury IAT, Death IAT, Suicide IAT) independent factorial 
ANOVA with both NSSI recency group and IAT version as between-subjects factors with the 
interaction term included in the model. For suicide attempt, a 3 (suicide attempt recency 
group3: past year attempt, lifetime but not past year attempt, no lifetime attempt) × 3 (IAT 
version) independent factorial ANOVA with both suicide attempt recency group and IAT 
version as between-subjects factors. IAT version was entered as a factor to examine whether 
the pattern of associations within the self-harm recency groups differed as a function of 
specific IAT.

Third, we tested whether the IAT was associated with frequency and severity of self-harm. 
Zero-order Pearson correlations were calculated examining the relations between implicit 
associations and lifetime frequency of NSSI, lifetime frequency of suicide attempt, and 
lifetime frequency of severe attempts (i.e., those requiring medical attention). Given the 
majority of participants had neither a lifetime history of NSSI nor a lifetime history of 
suicide attempt, correlations were performed only among lifetime self-injurers or attempters. 
We also tested whether IAT effects differed by severity of suicidality by comparing results 
across three groups: lifetime suicide attempt, lifetime suicide ideation (but no attempt), and 
neither lifetime ideation nor attempt, using one-way ANOVAs.

Fourth and finally, we examined the extent to which performance on different versions of the 
IAT maps on to specific types of self-harm behaviors. To do so, we created subgroups of 
participants who engaged in: only NSSI (i.e., no history of suicide ideation or attempt) or 
only suicide ideation or attempts (i.e., but never NSSI) and tested whether differences on the 
Self-Injury IAT were specific to the former and differences on the Death and Suicide IATs 
were specific to the latter.

Due to the benefit of a very large sample size and the unique opportunity for internal 
replication, we split our dataset (6,229 participants) in half using random selection and 
conducted our planned analyses on the first sample (i.e., Sample 1; N=3,115) and then 
conducted identical confirmatory analyses on the second sample (i.e., Sample 2; N=3,114) 
to cross-validate our results (Wagenmakers et al., 2012). Alpha was set at .05 for all two-
tailed significance tests and post hoc pairwise comparisons were adjusted using Bonferroni 
correction for all analyses.

Results

Sociodemographic Differences Based on Self-Harm History

Across participants in Samples 1 and 2, lifetime self-injurers (M=25.41, SD=8.75) were 
significantly younger than non-injurers4 (M=29.85, SD=12.39), t(5958)=16.21, p<.001, 
d=0.42, but lifetime suicide attempters (M=26.89, SD=10.29) were not significantly younger 

3Past week attempters were not treated as a separate group given only 33 participants attempted suicide during the past week.

than suicide non-attempters (M=27.47, SD=10.84). Women had higher rates of NSSI 
(64.3%) than men (44.3%), χ2(1, N=5945)=213.65, p<.001, φ=.19, and suicide attempt 
(32.9%) than men (19.7%), χ2(1, N=5913)=111.21, p<.001, φ=.14. Hispanic/Latino 
participants had a higher rate of suicide attempt (33.5%) than non-Hispanic/Latino 
participants (28.2%), χ2(1, N=5442)=6.35, p=.012, φ=.03, but there was no significant 
difference in rate of NSSI between Hispanic/Latino (56.4%) and non-Hispanic/Latino 
participants (58.1%), χ2(1, N=5470)=0.76, p=.384, φ=.01. White participants had a higher 
rate of NSSI (59.5%) compared to non-Whites (53.4%), χ2(1, N=5896)=15.66, p<.001, φ=.
05, and non-White participants had a slightly higher rate of suicide attempt (30.9%) 
compared to Whites (28.1%), χ2(1, N=5864)=4.04, p=.044, φ=.03.

To ensure that any observed effects were not due to the sociodemographic differences noted 
above, we created case-control subsamples that were matched on age, gender, race, and 
ethnicity (with cases being those with a history of each type of self-harm and controls those 
with no such history) and conducted all study analyses on these sociodemographically 
equivalent groups. Results were the same for these matched samples (results available upon 
request), suggesting that group differences on the IAT are not the result of observed 
sociodemographic differences between self-harm and non-self-harm participants. Therefore, 
all analyses reported subsequently are from original non-matched samples.

Between-Group Differences in Implicit Cognition

Results revealed the hypothesized between-group differences on the Self-Injury IAT, Death 
IAT, and Suicide IAT (i.e., higher scores for those with vs. without a history of self-harm; 
see Table 2). The largest effect size in the NSSI vs. control (no history of NSSI) comparison 
was observed on the Self-Injury IAT (d=0.81), whereas the largest effect size in the suicide 
attempter vs. control (no attempt history) comparison was observed on the Suicide IAT 
(d=0.54), suggesting that effects were strongest when IAT stimuli matched the specific target 
behaviors. The Self-Injury IAT was the only IAT version in which lifetime self-injurers and 
suicide attempters had a positive score (indicating a stronger identification with self-injury 
than non-injury), whereas these self-harm groups had less negative scores than their 
respective controls on the Death IAT and Suicide IAT (indicating a weaker identification 
with life, but not a stronger identification with death than life) (see Figure 1A and 1B). As 
shown in Table 2, results from the replication sample confirmed these findings.

When predicting lifetime presence of NSSI, the Self-Injury IAT produced an area under the 
curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.69-0.75, p<.001), indicating moderate accuracy. The 
dichotomized Self-Injury IAT, using a cutoff score of 0, produced fair sensitivity (53%) and 
negative predictive value (59%), and strong specificity (82%) and positive predictive value 
(82%). When predicting a lifetime history of suicide attempt, the Suicide IAT produced an 
AUC of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.60-0.67, p<.001), indicating only fair accuracy. The dichotomized 
Suicide IAT score produced poor sensitivity (27%), fair positive predictive value (47%), and 
strong specificity (87%) and negative predictive value (73%). AUCs were slightly larger in 

4This is consistent with prior studies, which report higher rates of lifetime NSSI in younger respondents than older respondents (e.g., 
Swannell et al., 2014), likely due to a combination of problems with memory/reporting bias in adults and increasing rates of NSSI over 
the past few decades.

were otherwise similar.

Recency of Behavior and Self-Harm-Related Implicit Cognition

Examination of these effects as a function of time revealed that IAT scores were consistently 
higher for those who had engaged in self-harm more recently (see Figures 1C and 1D). In 
the case of NSSI (Figure 1C), a 4 (NSSI recency group) × 3 (IAT version) independent 
factorial ANOVA revealed significant main effects of NSSI recency group, F(3, 
2=.14, and IAT version, F(2, 3005)=124.64, p<.001, ηp
3005)=161.10, p<.001, ηp
hoc pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences between each group, such that 
participants who engaged in NSSI during the past week (n=283) had the strongest implicit 
associations (vs. past year, p<.001), followed in order by past year NSSI (n=706; vs. lifetime 
NSSI, p<.001), lifetime NSSI (n=761; vs. no lifetime NSSI, p<.001), and no history of NSSI 
(n=1267). Post hoc comparisons between IAT versions revealed that effects for the Self-
Injury IAT were stronger (i.e., larger association with self-harm) than those for the Death 
IAT and Suicide IAT (both p<.001), which also significantly differed from one another but to 
a weaker degree (p=.005). On balance, the significant but negligible effect size of the NSSI

comparisons between IAT versions revealed that self-harm-related implicit associations on 
the Self-Injury IAT were stronger (i.e., larger association with self-harm) than for the Death 
IAT and Suicide IAT (both p<.001), and the Death IAT was slightly stronger than the Suicide

Frequency and Severity of Behavior and Self-Harm-Related Implicit Cognition

Among self-injurers, lifetime frequency of NSSI was significantly correlated with all three 
IATs and most strongly with the Self-Injury IAT (r=.39) (see Table 3). Among suicide 
attempters, lifetime frequency of suicide attempt was significantly correlated with the Death 
IAT(r=.12), but not the Suicide IAT or Self-Injury IAT, and the number of lifetime attempts 
requiring serious medical attention was not significantly correlated with any of the IATs. As 
shown in Table 3, results from the replication sample confirmed the strong correlation 
between lifetime frequency of NSSI and the Self-Injury IAT. However, correlations between 
lifetime frequency of suicide attempt and IAT scores were stronger in the replication sample. 
Among attempters, lifetime frequency of suicide attempt was significantly correlated with 
the Death IAT (r=.27), and, unlike in the initial sample, also with both the Suicide IAT (r=.
12) and Self-Injury IAT (r=.14). Unlike in the initial sample, the number of lifetime attempts 
requiring serious medical attention was significantly correlated with the Death IAT (r=.25).

In terms of severity of suicidality, one-way ANOVAs comparing participants with a lifetime 
suicide attempt (n=868), lifetime suicide ideation without attempt (n=1611), and neither 
lifetime ideation nor attempt (n=512) demonstrated an overall difference among groups on 
the Self-Injury IAT, F(2, 990)=34.66, p<.001, η2=.07, Death IAT, F(2, 980)=33.90, p<.001, 
η2=.07, and Suicide IAT, F(2, 1012)=47.24, p<.001, η2=.09. Post hoc pairwise comparisons 
revealed that for all three IATs, lifetime attempters had stronger self-harm-related implicit 
associations than lifetime ideators (all ps<.001-.002), and lifetime ideators had stronger self-
harm-related implicit associations than those without any lifetime suicide ideation or suicide 
attempt (all ps<.001). These results indicate the self-harm IAT's ability to specifically isolate 
participants with more severe suicide histories (suicide attempt vs. ideation).

Results from the replication sample confirmed these findings. One-way ANOVAs comparing 
participants with a lifetime suicide attempt (n=852), lifetime suicide ideation without 
attempt (n=1581), and neither lifetime ideation nor attempt (n=552) were significant for the

revealed significant differences such that lifetime attempters had stronger implicit 
associations than lifetime ideators for the Self-Injury IAT and Suicide IAT (both ps<.001; for

without any lifetime suicide ideation or attempt for all three IATs (ps<.001).

Specificity of Self-Harm-Related Implicit Cognition

Lastly, we examined the specificity of associations between performance on the IAT and 
distinct types of self-harm. After removing those with a lifetime history of suicide ideation 
and/or attempt from the sample, we found significant differences between those with a 
lifetime history of NSSI (n=112) and those without a history of NSSI (n=398) on the Self-
Injury IAT, t(168)=3.75, p<.001, d=0.58, but not on the Death IAT, t(158)=1.93, p=.055, 
d=0.31, or Suicide IAT, t(178)=0.69, p=.489, d=0.10, indicating that those engaging in NSSI 
had an implicit identification with NSSI but not with death or suicide. In separate analyses, 
after removing participants with a history of NSSI from our sample, we found significant 
differences between those with lifetime suicide ideation and/or attempt (n=861) and those 
with no such history (n=398) on both the Death IAT, t(400)=4.38, p<.001, d=0.44, and 
Suicide IAT, t(433)=4.33, p<.001, d=0.42, but not on the Self-Injury IAT, t(420)=1.84, p=.
066, d=0.18, indicating that those with a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors had a 
weaker implicit identification with life, but not an implicit identification with NSSI.

Results from the replication sample largely confirmed these findings. After removing suicide 
ideators and attempters from the sample, those with a history of NSSI (n=128) differed 
significantly from those without a history of NSSI (n=424) on the Self-Injury IAT, 
t(173)=5.26, p<.001, d=0.80, and, unlike in the initial sample, also on the Suicide IAT, 
t(199)=2.87, p=.005, d=0.41, but not the Death IAT, t(174)=1.76, p=.081, d=0.27. After 
removing those with a history of NSSI, suicide ideators and attempters (n=832) differed 
significantly from those with no suicide history (n=424) on the Suicide IAT, t(459)=4.37, p<.
001, d=0.41, and Death IAT, t(398)=3.52, p<.001, d=0.35, but not the Self-Injury IAT, 
t(393)=1.77, p=.077, d=0.18.

Discussion

This study provided important evidence of replication and novel findings about implicit self-
harm associations. First, people with a history of suicide attempt and NSSI had a stronger 
implicit identification with self-harm (i.e., a stronger association between self-harm and the 
self) than those with no such history – replicating the results from earlier, smaller studies on 
this topic. Second, implicit associations about self-harm tracked the recency of self-harm 
behavior, such that the more recent the self-harm, the higher the scores on the IAT. Third, 
implicit associations about self-harm were stronger, in general, among those with more 
frequent and more severe self-harm, although not all of these effects replicated across both 
samples. Fourth, the results of this study yielded evidence for specificity, such that when 
excluding from analyses participants with a history of suicidal thoughts or behaviors, 
between-group differences for those who did vs. did not engage in NSSI were largest for the 
Self-Injury IAT and were non-significant for the Death IAT and, in the initial sample, the 
Suicide IAT. Likewise, when excluding from analyses participants with a history of NSSI, 
between-group differences for those who did vs. did not have a history of suicidal thoughts

and behaviors were largest for the Suicide IAT and Death IAT, and were non-significant for 
the Self-Injury IAT. Several aspects of these findings warrant additional comment.

There has been increasing scientific and clinical interest in recent years in the use of 
measures of implicit cognition to learn about cognitive processes associated with suicidal 
and nonsuicidal self-injury. Prior studies have shown that scores on self-harm IATs not only 
distinguish between those engaging vs. not engaging in self-harm but also predict future 
self-harm above and beyond other established predictors. However, small sample sizes 
among these studies have limited our ability to more precisely clarify the association 
between implicit associations and self-harming behaviors. The current study utilized a large-
scale web-based platform as a means to replicate prior laboratory and hospital results and to 
recruit the numbers of participants necessary to address several novel questions.

First, we found that individuals with a lifetime history of NSSI and suicide attempt associate 
self-harm more strongly with the self than do those without a history of self-injury and 
attempt, respectively. These results not only replicate prior laboratory and hospital studies 
demonstrating similar group differences for NSSI (Nock & Banaji, 2007a) and suicide 
attempt (Nock & Banaji, 2007b; Nock et al., 2010), but also indicate the feasibility of 
disseminating the self-harm IAT across a variety of settings given that it can be successfully 
self-administered and remains valid even for less controlled environments (e.g., online). IAT 
versions utilizing stimuli more specific to the target behaviors assessed produced the 
strongest effects, such that the largest effect size in the NSSI vs. control comparison was 
observed on the Self-Injury IAT and the largest effect size in the suicide attempt vs. control 
comparison was observed on the Suicide IAT. The fact that specific words related to suicide 
methods (Suicide IAT) produced stronger effects for lifetime suicide attempt than general 
words related to death (Death IAT) suggests that self-harm IATs are strongest when 
assessing behavioral constructs precisely. When using the IAT to predict the presence of past 
self-harm, its false negative rate was low but its sensitivity to detecting a history of self-harm 
performed only moderately well, especially for suicide attempts.

Second, these results raise the possibility that implicit associations may not be stable traits 
but rather are more malleable or state-dependent, decreasing with time since the most recent 
self-harm engagement. Performance on the Self-Injury IAT achieved considerable temporal 
resolution for NSSI, distinguishing between participants who self-injured during the past 
week and those who self-injured during the past year (but not past week). Whereas 
longitudinal data are necessary to draw firm conclusions, these findings provide some 
preliminary indication that the IAT may serve as a way to assess imminence of current risk 
given its capability of tracking one's recent history of self-harm. Nonetheless, we reiterate 
that caution is needed given a similar pattern of results could be observed even if implicit 
cognitions were more stable in nature (e.g., those with stronger implicit cognitions tend to 
act on such cognitions more often and thus have typically experienced self-harm more 
recently). Third, we found that self-harm-related implicit associations typically were 
stronger among those with more frequent and severe histories of self-harm. The Self-Injury 
IAT was most strongly correlated with lifetime frequency of NSSI, and although correlations 
for suicide attempt frequency were weaker than NSSI, the Death IAT demonstrated the 
strongest implicit associations for frequency of suicide attempt history (i.e., lifetime

frequency for both total and medically serious attempts, though results for medically serious 
attempts did not hold across both the initial and replication samples). We also found that 
implicit associations with self-harm were associated specifically with suicide attempt (i.e., 
not explained by suicide ideation) and were strongest on the Suicide IAT, indicating the 
IAT's ability to differentiate those with particularly severe suicide histories.

Lastly, we found evidence of specificity between different IAT versions and types of self-
harm. The Self-Injury IAT most strongly differentiated those with vs. without a history of 
NSSI (excluding those with a history of suicide ideation or attempt), and the Suicide and 
Death IATs most strongly differentiated those with vs. without a history of suicide ideation 
or attempt (excluding those with NSSI history). Those with a history of NSSI had 
consistently elevated scores on the Self-Injury IAT but not the Death or Suicide IATs 
(though results were significant for the Suicide IAT in the replication sample), suggesting 
that implicit associations among self-injurers are associated with NSSI specifically and not 
self-harm generally. Similarly, those with a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors were 
consistently elevated on the Suicide IAT and Death IAT but not the Self-Injury IAT, 
indicating the Suicide/Death IAT's ability to capture suicide history independent from NSSI 
history. Future research is needed to gain even greater clarification of the IAT's precision.

Clinical Implications

These findings have important implications for both researchers and clinicians. Prior 
laboratory and hospital studies have established the IAT's ability to uniquely predict future 
self-harm behaviors above and beyond known risk factors, as well as clinician and patient 
self-report. Many robust risk factors for suicidal behavior, such as depression, have high 
sensitivity but poor specificity for predicting future behaviors (i.e., most suicide attempters 
have a history of depression but very few depressed individuals go on to attempt suicide). 
This study and others have shown that the self-harm IAT not only has good sensitivity but 
even better specificity (Nock et al., 2010), suggesting the IAT has unique predictive value 
not captured by other known risk factors. The fact that this study replicated prior main 
findings and found that self-harm-related implicit associations may be temporally malleable 
indicates the feasibility of validly administering the IAT across diverse, less controlled 
settings, and the IAT's ability to track current self-harm risk in a way that more fixed risk 
factors cannot. As such, the IAT may be a tool that clinicians and patients can use remotely 
on an ongoing basis as a means to gather more information about one's risk of NSSI or 
suicide attempt. Examples include follow-up assessments completed by patients at home 
between outpatient visits, or tracking risk for the increasing number of patients using 
eHealth interventions such as computer-based cognitive behavior therapies. Given its 
sensitivity to temporal patterns, the IAT also may serve a critical function to assess ongoing 
risk for patients following hospital discharge (e.g., following a suicide attempt) given 
research showing that individuals are at especially heightened risk during the first year 
following a suicide attempt (Hawton & Fagg, 1988).

To maximize the IAT's clinical utility, these results suggest it may be most useful for 
researchers and clinicians to tailor IAT stimuli to the specific target behaviors of interest. 
Specifically, there is a clinical advantage to having two separate IATs: (1) a Self-Injury IAT

to assess potential presence and risk of NSSI, and (2) a Death/Suicide IAT to assess potential 
presence and risk of suicide attempts. The Self-Injury IAT produced strong and specific 
effects when assessing NSSI history, and the Death/Suicide IATs may be a preferred means 
to assess suicide attempt given its stronger ability to differentiate suicide attempt from either 
suicide ideation or comorbid NSSI. For example, the Suicide IAT could be used in the 
emergency department prior to making decisions regarding discharge with high-risk suicidal 
patients, especially considering the IAT's resistance to faking (Greenwald et al., 2009). An 
interesting future direction would be to compare picture vs. word stimuli for suicide-related 
stimuli to see whether a similar pattern emerges and/or effects are even stronger (e.g., 
suicide images vs. words). It may even be possible to personalize self-harm IATs to the level 
of individual stimuli, such as using pictures of pills for individuals with a history of 
overdose. Also, results showing that past suicide attempters had stronger associations with 
life than death/suicide suggests it will be clinically necessary to determine cut points based 
on relative, rather than absolute, associations with self-harm.

Taken together, these results indicate the self-harm IAT's utility in measuring implicit 
associations outside of conscious control and the promise that this tool holds for assessing 
suicide risk with greater precision. It is important, however, to view implicit cognition about 
self-harm not as a panacea for assessing suicide risk but rather as one measure that, in 
conjunction with other important factors or markers, can increase the accuracy of risk 
assessments. Future work is needed to develop methods to combine available data (e.g., IAT 
and clinician- and patient-reports) in a clinically useful way. When such progress is 
achieved, the IAT represents a well-validated measure to include in the battery.

Limitations and Conclusion

Several limitations of the current study should be noted. First, these data were collected 
cross-sectionally; therefore, self-harm associations could only be shown to predict group 
status (i.e., self-reported past self-harm) rather than future behaviors. Although prior studies 
with smaller samples have demonstrated the IAT's ability to predict future self-harm above 
and beyond other well-known predictors (e.g., past suicide attempt; Nock et al., 2010), large-
scale longitudinal studies that assess participants at multiple time points are needed to make 
temporal predictions between self-harm-related implicit cognition and behavior. Specifically, 
such studies could clarify whether frequency of self-harm leads to increases in the strength 
of implicit cognition, whether stronger implicit cognitions about self-harm lead to greater 
engagement in or more severe self-harm behaviors, and the extent to which implicit 
associations significantly predict future self-harm beyond already established predictors.

Second, although these results are consistent with prior laboratory studies using community 
samples, it is important to note that our study sample was not representative of the general 
population and contained higher rates of self-harm than is commonly found in non-clinical 
populations (e.g., 58% participants had lifetime NSSI vs. 13% reported prevalence among 
young adults; Swannell et al., 2014). Participants with a history of self-harm, or 
psychopathology in general, may have self-selected into the study (e.g., more likely to visit 
the site, complete the study tasks after consent, or choose to complete the self-harm vs. other 
non-self-harm-related IATs on the site) due to personal experience or interest in self-harm.

Therefore, interpretation of these results should be made with caution and may be limited to 
participants with a history of self-harm behavior or those with more prior exposure to self-
harm-related concepts or stimuli. Even so, these findings support the IAT's potential utility 
given those with a history of self-harm are at heightened risk for future engagement and thus 
are the very individuals for which better assessment tools are especially needed.

Third, participants were placed into past self-harm groups based on self-report to, in some 
cases, single items (e.g., lifetime suicide attempt). Although measures utilizing single-item 
questions to assess history of self-harm have been shown to be reliable (Nock et al., 2007) 
and the anonymous nature of the self-report makes it less likely to be subject to impression 
management, it is possible that participants would be categorized differently based on a 
more comprehensive interview. Mitigating this concern, a recent study directly testing this 
issue found that only 11% of participants who endorsed a single-item measure asking about 
a past suicide attempt engaged in behaviors that, as determined by coders, would not be 
considered an actual suicide attempt (Millner, Lee, & Nock, 2015).

Fourth, given that participation in the study was anonymous, it is possible that some 
participants took the IAT multiple times; however, the very large sample size minimizes the 
chances that such repeat participants significantly affect these results.

Fifth, the current study focused primarily on behavioral outcomes of self-harm (i.e., suicide 
attempt and engagement in NSSI). Although the ability to examine self-harming behaviors, 
as opposed to using proxies for such behaviors only (e.g., suicidal thoughts), is a strength of 
this work, future studies could examine other types of self-harming thoughts and behaviors
—such as suicide plans and intent—to elucidate their respective implicit associations with 
different IAT variants.

Although the current study provides strong evidence for the validity and potential clinical 
utility of the IAT, further research is needed to develop clinical assessment tools that are able 
to integrate risk factors and behavioral markers as a means to reliably identify individuals at 
risk. Given that clinical judgment of suicide risk is fraught with practical challenges of 
integrating knowledge of numerous risk factors and individual circumstances, actuarial 
approaches to suicide risk assessment that include implicit cognition measures provide 
tremendous promise in the critical goal of helping those at risk of hurting themselves.

General Scientific Summary

Tools to objectively and reliably assess risk of suicide and self-injury are critically 
needed given the serious limitations of self-report in this domain. This study supports the 
clinical potential of using measures of implicit associations (associations that are difficult 
to consciously control) between the self and death or self-harm to detect more recent and 
severe histories of self-harm, and to differentiate between distinct types of self-harm. 
These associations may ultimately help identify who is at most imminent risk for future 
self-harm behaviors.
