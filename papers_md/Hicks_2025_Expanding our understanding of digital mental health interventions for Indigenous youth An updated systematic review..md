Abstract
Past research has examined available literature on electronic mental health interventions for Indigenous youth with men-
tal health concerns. However, as there have recently been increases in both the number of studies examining electronic
mental health interventions and the need for such interventions (i.e. during periods of pandemic isolation), the present
systematic review aims to provide an updated summary of the available peer-reviewed and grey literature on electronic
mental health interventions applicable to Indigenous youth. The purpose of this review is to better understand the pro-
cesses used for electronic mental health intervention development. Among the 48 studies discussed, smoking cessation
and suicide were the most commonly targeted mental health concerns in interventions. Text message and smartphone
application (app) interventions were the most frequently used delivery methods. Qualitative, quantitative, and/or
mixed outcomes were presented in several studies, while other studies outlined intervention development processes
or study protocols, indicating high activity in future electronic mental health intervention research. Among the ﬁndings,
common facilitators included the use of community-based participatory research approaches, representation of culture,
and various methods of motivating participant engagement. Meanwhile, common barriers included the lack of necessary
resources and limits on the amount of support that online interventions can provide. Considerations regarding the stan-
dards and criteria for the development of future electronic mental health interventions for Indigenous youth are offered
and future research directions are discussed.

Introduction

Indigenous youth are exposed to many elements that
increase their risk for negative mental health outcomes.
Colonial legacies (e.g. assimilation, gendered violence,
dispossession of land and resources)1 have historically
and continually shaped the lives of Indigenous youth.
More broadly, colonialism (i.e.
the guiding force that
created political and economic inequalities) has been dis-
cussed as a social determinant of health that has led to
various unjust life situations.2 For example, Indigenous
populations are more likely to experience decreased
housing quality,3 unstable housing,4 and food security,5
as well as increased household crowding,6 poverty,7 sub-
stance use,8 and sexual violence9 than non-Indigenous
populations. Indigenous youth, speciﬁcally, are overrepre-
sented in child protection and youth justice systems and
are more likely to experience neglect and abuse, as well

as poor outcomes in areas of health, education, and
social development, when compared to non-Indigenous
youth.10 As such, Indigenous youth have been noted as
constituting a ‘high-risk group’ for emotional and psycho-
logical difﬁculties.10 With the accumulation and intersec-
tion of many of these risk factors,11 there is a clear need for

interventions that speciﬁcally support the mental health of
Indigenous youth.

Indigenous youth have experienced barriers to mental
health care for decades. Barriers to accessing mental health
services for Indigenous young people included inconsistent
access to mental health services,12,13 lack of awareness of
services,11 and discomfort in seeking help from services
due to concerns about conﬁdentiality, shame, fear, language
or literacy difﬁculties, and racism14 (for a review, see Brown
et al.15). Retaining mental health service providers within
rural or remote communities is also difﬁcult,12 and this low
retention of staff can then lead to higher caseloads for the
remaining staff.16 As Indigenous communities can be geo-
graphically isolated, there are limited options for supervision
and training for service providers, which can result in novice
practitioners feeling pressured to practice far beyond their
capabilities.17 During the COVID-19 pandemic, populations
who are the most vulnerable (i.e. Indigenous youth) were left
behind when it came to accessing the rapidly developing,
innovative, wellness and self-care virtual services that were
being designed to meet the needs of the general population.18
Conventional mental health supports (i.e. face-to-face care)
were also no longer able to meet the increased volume of
need for support,19,20 and in many circumstances, in-person
support was no longer an option.19,20 Thus, adaptation and
transformation of mental health care options were greatly
needed,18 especially for Indigenous youth who had long
been facing such barriers to care.

Electronic mental health (e-MH) interventions have been
suggested as a method to circumvent health care disparities,
including service costs, accessibility, and stigma-related
barriers.21 e-MH refers to mental health services and infor-
mation that are either delivered or enhanced through the
Internet and/or other similar types of technology.22 A
recent meta-analysis found telehealth interventions (includ-
ing modalities such as video-conferencing and mobile
health apps, etc.) to be equally or more clinically effective
when compared to usual care.23 As well, telehealth did
not compromise the effectiveness of care when compared
forms of health service delivery.23
to conventional
Culturally appropriate care can also be easily integrated
into e-MH interventions,24 making them particularly rele-
vant for use by Indigenous youth who strongly beneﬁt
from the inclusion of culture in care.25 Telehealth has
also been found to enhance culturally appropriate care by
allowing for care to be provided within supportive environ-
ments, such as Indigenous-run primary healthcare pro-
grams, instead of within mainstream healthcare programs,
and by reducing burdens associated with traveling and dis-
locating from community and family.26 As well, literature
suggests that young people may be more likely to
respond to, and prefer, alternative service delivery strategies
offered via e-MH interventions (e.g. video conferencing;
and Internet-based applications).27 In addition to being an
option for reducing geographical barriers to care, e-MH

interventions may have additional utility as they might
help Indigenous youth feel more comfortable and/or moti-
vated to engage in technology-based services.

Some reports have examined the use of e-MH interven-
tions to support the well-being of Indigenous youth during
the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Walker
et al.28 examined articles identifying existing and expected
mental health outcomes associated with COVID-19 for
Indigenous young people and found that, while digital tech-
nologies can help build strong cultural identity, enhance con-
nections to community, and improve mental, social, and
emotional well-being outcomes, there are still great inequities
in accessibility to digital technology for Indigenous young
people. The authors advocated for more targeted policy
and funding to promote Indigenous young people’s
access to digital well-being services.28 Relatedly, a review
of Strudwick et al.29 digital interventions to support the
mental health of individuals living in Canada during the
COVID-19 pandemic brieﬂy highlighted the lack of digital
resources available that are speciﬁc to Indigenous peoples
and communities.29 These reviews demonstrate the potential
of e-MH interventions for Indigenous youth, but also demon-
strate some key barriers in terms of intervention accessibility.
Several reviews have been conducted to examine the
impact of e-MH interventions for Indigenous populations
more broadly,30–35 but there is still a need for more literature
pertaining to e-MH services for Indigenous youth speciﬁc-
ally,36 speciﬁcally around the facilitators and barriers to
e-MH intervention implementation. Recent efforts to sum-
marize the available e-MH services for Indigenous youth
thus far have offered preliminary ﬁndings but noted that
further research is needed to conﬁrm those ﬁndings.37
Povey et al.38 currently examining more speciﬁc aspects of
e-MH interventions for Indigenous youth (i.e. best practices
for engaging youth in the development and evaluation of
e-MH resources), however, an updated review of
the
broader considerations pertinent to e-MH interventions for
Indigenous youth was still needed as (a) the literature on
these interventions has increased and (b) the need for these
interventions options have also increased throughout the
COVID-19 pandemic. As well, as the First Nations Mental
Wellness Continuum Framework (FNMWCF)39 and the
Integrated Life Course and Social Determinants Model of
Aboriginal Health (ILCSDAH)40 both highlight the import-
ance of interventions that extend beyond the individual and
into the family and community interventions to improve
health outcomes, this review will also aim to include e-MH
interventions that work to improve outcomes for Indigenous
youth via the inclusion of family and community members.

Study purpose

This study aimed to provide an updated systematic review of
the literature describing the implementation of e-MH inter-
ventions designed for/with Indigenous youth. We sought to

capture any new and relevant studies that had been put forth
since the previous study37 and to summarize relevant charac-
teristics, facilitators (i.e. factors that increase intervention
development, implementation, and accessibility), and barriers
(i.e. factors that decrease intervention development, imple-
mentation, and accessibility) of e-MH interventions that

were reported. Throughout the Introduction above, various
telehealth and
terms related to e-MH interventions (i.e.
digital technologies) have been/are used interchangeably.
Throughout the rest of this article, we try when possible to
be consistent with the term “e-MH intervention,” however,
we also use language reﬂected within individual papers (i.e.

922

“mobile interventions” and “web-based programs”). In doing
so, we are aiming to provide the best summary possible of
available e-MH interventions, regardless of cross-study dif-
ferences in terminology.

The present study is also process-based rather than
outcome-based. More speciﬁcally, this systematic review
was not conducted to thoroughly review aspects of
outcome measures (e.g. efﬁcacy for various outcomes).
Instead, only basic counts and descriptions of outcomes
are reported, and processes used to develop e-MH interven-
tions for Indigenous youth were the focus, as this type of
information would be valuable for future researchers, stake-
holders, and/or communities looking to develop or adapt
e-MH interventions for their own contexts. With this goal
in mind, considerations for standards and criteria that can
be used to inform new development e-MH interventions
for Indigenous youth were provided based on how often
various processes occurred in the literature reviewed and
how well they addressed known barriers to intervention.

Method

A preliminary review of literature from 19 databases was
completed by one reviewer. This review included grey lit-
erature and relevant reference lists. Building upon our ori-
ginal search string,37 we conducted this preliminary
review of the literature to identify any new terminology
that would support our search aims. Our original search
string included 24 terms but was expanded to include add-
itional terms from Povey et al.38 recently published system-
atic review protocol, which will examine the various
methods used to involve Indigenous youth in the develop-
ment and evaluation processes of e-MH interventions.38
These original and additional search terms can be found
the bottom of Table 1. Following this preliminary
at
review, a systematic review of these databases was com-
pleted by one author from 29 April 2021 to 25 June
2021, beginning with an initial title and abstract screening,
and followed by a full-text review. Table 1 also includes the
databases and grey literature sources examined. Figure 1
describes the number of studies included in the ﬁnal
in accordance with the most recent Preferred
review,
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Reporting Items
Analyses (PRISMA) standards.41 Tables 2 and 3 include
data related to population, intervention, comparisons, and
outcomes. Finally, a two-eyed seeing framework was
used to interpret the literature, which allowed for standards
and criteria to be developed while considering both
Indigenous methodologies, ways of knowing, and knowl-
edge, in combination with Western science.42

Inclusion criteria

Articles were included in this review if they described any
type of e-MH intervention designed to improve the mental

wellbeing of Indigenous youth. Articles were also included
in this review even if the participants included in the studies
were not Indigenous youth, and this was to ensure that we
captured e-MH interventions designed to improve the
mental wellbeing of Indigenous youth via their support net-
works (e.g. family members, community members, health-
care workers, etc.), as seen in the FNMWCF39 and the
ILCSDAH40 discussed above. Articles also had to be avail-
able in English and be published between 1 January 2000
and 1 June 2022. Youth was deﬁned as being between 12
and 30 years of age. While Consolidated Standards of
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) best practices indicate that
only those sources that meet a particular threshold of
quality should be evaluated in a systematic review, this
was not completed as several studies would have been
removed. This is in alignment with a framework by Short
et al.90; all studies were included if they met the inclusion
criteria.

Results

Study characteristics

Forty-eight articles were included in this review, 38 of
which were updated from the previous review.37 Figure 2
provides a visual of the increase in studies over the past
few years. Table 2 describes 30 studies that aimed to
support youth/young adults within the deﬁned age range,
while Table 3 describes 18 studies that included participants
within the deﬁned age range as well as participants older
than the deﬁned age range. Throughout each section in
the results, studies from Table 2 will be referred to as
“youth-speciﬁc studies” and studies from Table 3 will be
referred to as “broader studies.”

section, the aim of this article is not to thoroughly review or
evaluate e-MH intervention outcomes (e.g. effectiveness
and efﬁcacy). Therefore, only broad categories of research
approaches are reported to gain a sense of the type of
research occurring within this area. A wide variety of
research approaches were used both youth-speciﬁc and
broader. Figure 5 provides a visual count of studies

one of the 18 total broader studies.83 Other studies reported
on the design and development of interventions (rather than
reporting qualitative or quantitative approaches) and this
occurred for seven out of the 30 total youth-speciﬁc
studies.38,46,55,59,61,62,70 No broader studies shared the

Intervention development. Processes for e-MH intervention
development and adaptation also ranged widely. Figure 6
provides a visual count of studies by the development
process used. Almost half (n = 14) of the 30 youth-speciﬁc
studies developed novel e-MH interventions designed specif-
ically for Indigenous youth/young adults,45–48,50,53–56,65,69–72

studies75,77 opted to translate pre-existing in-person inter-
ventions developed for Indigenous youth/young adults
into e-MH interventions for

adults. Four of the youth-speciﬁc studies opted to develop
e-MH interventions for Indigenous youth/young adults
from pre-existing e-MH interventions that had been initially
developed for non-Indigenous populations.44,60,61,68 Seven

existing e-MH interventions designed speciﬁcally for
Indigenous youth. One youth-speciﬁc study examined a

ventions.59,62,77
Iterative processes were also used to
consult, review, and revise previously existing e-MH inter-
ventions to become more culturally appropriate61,68,72,73,82
or age appropriate38 for target participants. Some of these
studies included software developers46 and media organiza-
tions62 who supported the development of several drafts of
the intervention as well.

Several types of participant groups (e.g. stakeholders
and individuals with experience working with AI/AN
youth51; expert reference groups such as service provi-
ders77; community advisory boards70 and groups86) were
included in the co-design process. Longer lengths of the
research projects (e.g. two years,81 three years,61 and ﬁve
years62) were highlighted by researchers to allow for the
incorporation of a wide array of perspectives and experi-
ences in the intervention design process.61 Studies varied
in the levels of involvement of participants throughout the
study with this process ranging from communities electing
to participate in all stages of the study49 to others who were
only involved in some stages. This level of involvement
was also dependent on client variables, such as the level
of preparedness to provide critical feedback.46

Several studies also noted the importance of establishing
and preserving relationships with partnering communi-
ties.50,53,65,67,70–72 Researchers noted that these partner-
success50 and provided
ships were key to project
opportunities to demonstrate relational accountability with

also incorporated,46,77,78,84 with a few studies including

actors86;

On a more conceptual level, several studies noted the
importance of incorporating cultural values48–50,59,67,70,77
and cultural norms67,80 into interventions. Participants in
one study requested that intervention videos not include
“romanticized Native imagery,” and instead situations that
are relatable to them (e.g. familiar scene locations, and char-
acters that American Indian youth would typically turn to
for help61). Authors also concluded that the inclusion of

Beyond intervention content, studies also included cul-
turally tailored aspects in their
research design. For
example, some studies incorporated culturally tailored
assessments (e.g. quizzes,59 survey items,76 and overall
study measures87), while others included a comparison
arm in the design that was culturally tailored,59 or used cul-
turally relevant frameworks while conducting study ana-
lyses.45 Another study noted cultural considerations in
terms of compensation for participants and highlighted
their efforts to indigenize the process of accessing federal
grant funds for their project (e.g. ensuring that incentive
relevance was not questioned at
level;
ensuring incentives were received before participation).55

the institutional

Enhancing participant engagement. Studies outlined several
targeted recruitment methods to support engagement (e.g.
via Mā ori radio station advertising45; via e-Newsletters, list-
servs, conferences, print postcards, tribal epidemiological
centers, websites, Native social media inﬂuencers, and
Native student centers at schools and universities67). The
use of interfaces that youth were familiar with, such as
social media platforms (e.g.
Instagram, Snapchat, or
TikTok)38,46,67,88 and/or web-based-platforms previously
used for online classes59 was also reported to facilitate
youth engagement.

Methods of incentivization. Several types of incentiviza-
tion strategies (e.g. access to a mobile phone and cellular
plan53; access to additional computer time44; and gift
cards or monetary reimbursements67,72,86) were used to
support engagement. Access to requested therapy (e.g.
nicotine replacement
therapies) and facilitator support
were also offered.59 With respect to randomized control
trial designs, making the intervention be made available
to all clients interested in the service, rather than just to
those who were randomly allocated to the intervention
arm was suggested as well.83 For example, one study
found the use of a pre-randomized controlled design (i.e.
Zelen design) to minimize false hopes, resentment, and con-
tamination in the control group participants.53 The Zelen
pre-randomization design method allowed participants to
initially consent to providing observational data and then
provided them with an opportunity later
further
consent

intervention.

Enabling participant autonomy. Interventions that pro-
vided participants with opportunities for choice and auton-
omy also appeared to support participant engagement. One
study highlighted that participants were interested in being
able to deﬁne their own problems and solutions while using
an app,84 while another highlighted the fact that their app
did not provide opportunities for personalization as a limi-
tation.46 Other studies found that the use of open-ended
sharing allowed for participants to set their own health
and well-being priorities, and to engage at
their own
comfort levels.53,54 Methodologies that honored participant

Functional considerations. App use was supported by easy
sign-up processes52 and clear navigation52,84 within apps.
Customization of content (e.g. interactive videos)59 and of
problems/solutions to work on84 were also identiﬁed as
functional considerations that facilitated greater ownership
and engagement with app interventions in future iterations
of the technology. For text message-based interventions,
several studies provided recommendations for message
frequency.49,67,83 Recommendations
interactivity
included requiring more active engagement from users,49
using open-ended weekly text messages,53 using a “Call
to Action” within text messages,67 allowing for open-ended
sharing options,75,76 encouraging anonymous use,38,84,86
and using a high message frequency.83

and

Developing interventions for those who support youth. Other
studies examined interventions that could improve mental
systems more broadly by increasing
health support
support and facilitating skill-building for “natural helpers”
(i.e. peers, parents, and trusted adults) within communi-
ties.38 Online role-play training simulations were used
to increase participants’ capacity to support youth in
psychological distress.61 Several interventions also noted
providing training and support
for mental health
workers,61,71,77,85 which supported the iterative design
process during intervention development61 and raised
awareness of validated electronic mental health tools that
are responsive for target communities.85 Additional inter-
ventions were used to support frontline workers while in
session,77 and to support the development of practitioner
knowledge and skill via professional-to-professional case
consultation.71

hinder an iterative design process62 and lead to changes
in the intervention’s focus, target population, and interven-

tainable once developed, unanticipated costs associated
with development (e.g. conducting needs analysis, receiv-
ing ongoing feedback from subject matter experts and end
users, conducting beta testing)43 also hindered study
success.

Access. Several other studies noted access to technology
as a limiting factor.38,49,53–55,67,68,70,76,84,85 Access to the
required
(e.g. mobile
phones54 or devices with proper storage capacity for the
intervention49) was a noted barrier, as was the fragility of
devices used.77 Access to technology was noted as a
reason that participants decided to opt into a study76 and
loss of access to technology was a reason that participants
opted out.67 One62 study found that, while several partici-
pants in this study did not own a phone, the majority of par-
ticipants felt that having a mobile phone would be helpful
as it would support their access to resources beyond just
the presented intervention (i.e. access to health care;
forms of
access to emotional, mental, and spiritual
support during crisis; access to emergency text alerts,
such as those for shelter opening during extreme weather
or for notiﬁcations of “bad batch” incidents; and access to
opportunities for privacy).54 The authors noted that this
lack of phone ownership must be understood within
the context of colonization and the intersectional barriers
that
it has caused (e.g. substance use, poverty, and
incarceration).54

Difﬁculty connecting to the Internet or having access to
data was also a barrier,38,49,54,55,59,77,83–85 particularly in
rural and remote areas.55,59,77 High costs and existing
debt with service providers were reported to prevent parti-
cipants from maintaining regular cellular connectivity.53,84
Suggestions for navigating these barriers included provid-
ing mobile data plans for youth,55 providing a free,
one-time download for required apps,53,64,84 and engaging
with community organizations that may already have
access to the internet (e.g. schools).55

Intervention scope. e-MH interventions alone may not be
sufﬁcient to holistically address user needs,38,49,52,69,77,83,84
and could be used in conjunction with other services or
supports,49,52,83,84 particularly for those with co-morbid
or complex mental health needs. Some participants
expressed concerns regarding the extent of support that
can be obtained from a single app in scenarios where
more intensive supports are needed (e.g. ongoing patterns
of family violence52) or where mental health concerns are
caused by broader historical factors, such as coloniza-
tion.84 In one study, individual-focused apps promoting
behavioral change had relatively small effects at
the
population level, suggesting that such options may have
a low impact (irrespective of the degree of participation
from the target population) in the absence of structural
interventions.49

were reported to encourage use. Parents reported concerns
maintaining youth safety in an online environment, relating
to cyberbullying and inappropriate content or advice on
unmonitored boards.52 Similarly, addressing aspects of
conﬁdentiality, anonymity, and privacy were reported to
help maximize engagement.71 Literacy and language differ-
ences were identiﬁed as barriers to intervention use by par-
ticipants,84 while lack of knowledge regarding e-MH
interventions (e.g. understanding effectiveness and applic-
ability of resources for speciﬁc target populations) was
identiﬁed as a barrier by healthcare workers.85

Discussion

The aim of this review was to provide an updated summary
of the literature on e-MH interventions for Indigenous
youth conducted to date. This review shows an increase
within this research area as evidenced by the jump from
10 studies previously37 to 48 studies presently. This
increase brings the need for reﬂection on facilitators and
barriers to implementation processes of e-MH interven-
tions, and for the creation of standards/criteria considera-
tions to support future development.

frequently reported types of

The most common mental health concerns targeted in
studies in this review were smoking cessation and suicide
prevention. Text messages, apps, and websites were the
most
technology used.
Quantitative outcomes were reported most often (i.e.
within 16 studies), contrasting the reporting of quantitative
outcomes in the previous report (i.e. within three studies).37
This review also found more protocol/proposal reports than
our previous (12 vs. 2, respectively), supporting the conclu-
sion that the number of studies within this research area is
expanding. The inclusion of the “design and development”
study outcome category can similarly be taken as evidence
for a growing area of research. The most common process
for developing an intervention was to create a novel inter-
vention, however, additional development methods were
used, such as developing e-MH interventions from previ-
ously existing in person interventions for
Indigenous
youth. Iterative development (i.e. working group consulta-
tions, community engagement
in treatment adaptations,
etc.) was also commonly used, and was noted to be beneﬁ-
cial as it allows for cumulative and targeted efforts to meet
the needs of the Indigenous youth the interventions are
designed to serve.

participatory

Several facilitators were noted to support e-MH inter-
vention development and implementation. Incorporating
community-based
approaches
throughout was found to be important; namely, including
participants in the co-design process,38,46,48–53,55,59,61,62,64,

surface-level details of the interventions, such as in the lan-
guage used and images included, and in the deeper level
details of the intervention, such as the cultural contexts
and values communicated. Including aspects of culture
throughout various points in the research design process
(e.g. culturally appropriate incentives, assessments, and
comparison study arms) also facilitated intervention
development.45,55,59,76,87

Various methods of motivating participant engagement,
such as the use of targeted recruitment methods (e.g. radio
station advertisements, word of mouth, and positive-toned
Facebook Ads), modern communication mediums (e.g.
familiar social networks such as Instagram or TikTok,
familiar school websites), and aspects that support partici-
pant autonomy (e.g. opportunities for personalization,
open-ended sharing, and sharing of participant expertise)
also supported intervention development. Functional con-
siderations
relating to accessibility (e.g. easy-to-use
methods for app navigation and customization) and level
of required interactivity (e.g. bi-directional and dynamic
messaging) within the e-MH intervention platforms were
also important factors considered throughout the develop-
ment process. Finally,
the development of support for
those who support Indigenous youth (e.g. community
members and primary care providers) was also a reported
facilitator.38,43,61,71,77,85 This style of approach is valuable
because it extends beyond the individual user of e-MH
intervention and provides resources that can be used to
support Indigenous youth from a community level.

Several barriers were also noted to hinder e-MH inter-
vention
implementation. Notably,
several studies reported having limited access to the
research.38,43,49,

53–55,62,67,68,70,76,83–85 Insufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources were
commonly reported, as well as insufﬁcient access to the

(e.g. cellular networks and Wi-Fi networks). To bypass
these barriers, researchers suggested creating apps that
only require one-time downloads. Another broad category

interven-
tions.38,49,52,69,77,83,84 This limitation was prominent for
youth with more severe mental health concerns, suggesting
the need for these types of supports to be used in tandem
with in-person care. Indigenous youth using e-MH inter-
ventions face challenges that are far beyond the scope of
a single app (e.g. intergenerational trauma and reconnection
to culture) and thus, these supports must be provided in
tandem with policies and programs that will also support
structural and system-level change. Finally, additional

Consideration

Description of consideration and supporting data

1. Include partnering communities at their

preferred level of involvement throughout
the co-design process

2. Provide opportunities for iterative feedback

3. Tailor both surface-level (e.g. visuals) and deeper-level

(e.g. values) content to youth needs within their current
community contexts

4. Design interventions within interfaces that youth

are already familiar with

5. Provide the necessary ﬁnancial, technological, and

organizational resources to complete
the intervention

6. Consider e-MH intervention features and aspects
of study design that are currently being used to
increase engagement

(cid:129) Several studies collected participant feedback throughout the
design, development, and testing processes to ensure that the
e-MH intervention met the speciﬁc needs and preferences of
the youth

(cid:129) A variety of participants were involved in this process, including
youth and community members (e.g. health care workers,
family, and elders) who commonly support youth
(cid:129) Studies vary in levels of involvement from partnering
communities, so communities should be consulted to
determine their preferred level of involvement in e-MH
intervention development

(cid:129) Several studies used feedback to culturally adapt previously

existing interventions

(cid:129) Building upon iterations of interventions in this way will likely
lead to more targeted and collaborative efforts on intervention
development, as well as improved relational accountability with
target communities

(cid:129) Culturally relevant images, videos, language, auditory

components, and overall aesthetics were commonly used to
make interventions more appealing to young people

(cid:129) Culturally relevant contexts and values were also included to
better reﬂect the experiences of the youth and to provide
holistic healing mechanisms for Indigenous mental health

(cid:129) Several studies involved Indigenous media experts (i.e.
Indigenous-owned ﬁlm crews, Indigenous actors, and
Indigenous graphic designers) to bolster youth engagement

(cid:129) Using pre-existing friendship and social networks (e.g.

Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok) or platforms used to support
online learning (e.g. class website) can improve intervention use
as youth are already familiar with these contexts

(cid:129) Such online platforms likely became more relevant/familiar to
youth throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, as they may have
been required to shift more socializing and learning online
(cid:129) Several studies noted that inadequate funding can be a barrier

(cid:129)

to intervention success; funding needs for all areas of
intervention development must be considered
Inadequate access to required technology was also a barrier, so
project organizers must ensure that participants have access to
both the technological devices and the internet access and/or
cellular connectivity required for the intervention

(cid:129) Training, support, and organizational policies should also be

provided for primary care providers to ensure e-MH
intervention use can occur without overburdening the
workload

(cid:129) Features of e-MH interventions such as open-ended text

messaging and storytelling have previously been used to bolster
youth engagement

(cid:129) Considerations regarding the technological competence and
general literacy of the target group should also be given

(cid:129) Aspects of the research design that can be modiﬁed to improve
engagement should also be considered, such as including
relevant and timely incentivization and using culturally
appropriate assessments/overall study measures

Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare 31(7)

Description of consideration and supporting data

(cid:129) Several studies noted that e-MH interventions alone may not be
sufﬁcient for a variety of reasons (e.g. higher therapeutic needs;
needs that require support far beyond the scope of an app)
(cid:129) Depending on the target of the e-MH intervention, developers

must decide whether their app can be a stand-alone
intervention (e.g. preventative care measures) or an
intervention that is used adjunctively with additional established
treatment options/within the context of broader structural
changes

(cid:129) Development of support for those who support youth can also
be considered during the development of interventions for
youth

barriers identiﬁed included low levels of both IT and
general literacy,49,52,83–85 as well as aspects of the research
designs used (e.g. small samples and short trial durations),
which should also be considered when developing and
implementing future e-MH interventions.

Future directions
Standards and criteria considerations for future development of
e-MH interventions for Indigenous youth. Beyond summariz-
ing study characteristics, facilitators, and barriers, the ﬁnal
purpose of this updated systematic review was to provide
considerations for standards and criteria that can be used
to inform the processes for e-MH intervention develop-
ment. The practices that occurred most often in the literature
were considered in tandem with the known facilitators and
barriers for Indigenous youth accessing e-MH care to gen-
erate tangible suggestions for those looking to develop
e-MH interventions in the future. The ﬁndings of this
review are bolstered by several of the recommendations
from the previous review.37 Our seven considerations for
standards and criteria of e-MH intervention development
from this review are presented in Table 4.

Future reviews needed. To better understand the types of
e-MH research that are currently ongoing and if the ﬁeld is
growing (i.e. via the availability of protocol studies), the cat-
egories of outcomes within studies were brieﬂy summarized.
Future systematic reviews should further examine speciﬁc
e-MH intervention outcomes to better understand the effect-
iveness of these methods. Speciﬁcally, reviewers could
examine e-MH intervention effectiveness for apps designed
to promote overall well-being among Indigenous youth,
which may promote Indigenous views of holistic wellness.
Additional review topics within the realm of e-MH interven-
tions may examine which modalities best support user
engagement, why developers opt to create novel interven-
tions vs. adapting previously existing ones, and which

factors best facilitate the integration of e-MH intervention
with additional interpersonal and societal supports.

Conclusion

There has been an increase in published studies and protocols
for eMH interventions used to support the mental wellness of
Indigenous youth since our previous examination.37 As this
research becomes more available, there is a greater need for
further summarizing of the types of concerns targeted, technol-
ogy used, outcomes reported, and processes included for devel-
opment. Consideration must also be given to the factors that are
known to help or hinder youth engagement with these e-MH
interventions, and these facilitators and barriers should be
addressed in iterative rounds of collaborative research to
ensure the speciﬁc mental health needs of the targeted popula-
tion are met. To help meet these needs, we have provided seven
considerations relevant to future research examining e-MH
interventions designed to support Indigenous youth, which
build upon those provided by Toombs et al.37 Future research
should continue to support the iterative development of e-MH
interventions and should aim to ﬁll gaps that currently exist
within this area.
