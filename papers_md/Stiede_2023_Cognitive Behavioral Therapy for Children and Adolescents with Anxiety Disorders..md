Anxiety disorders—such as specific phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, 
and separation anxiety disorder—are the most common class of psychiatric conditions 
among children and adolescents, with estimated lifetime prevalence rates between 15% and 
30% before adulthood.1,2 Comorbidity among different anxiety disorders in youth is high,3 
and comorbid mood and externalizing disorders are also common.4 Further, children and 
adolescents with anxiety disorders often experience significant functional impairment in 
educational, social, and familial domains, which lead to continued impairment in adulthood 
and increased economic burden.1,5 The distress and impairment experienced by youth with 
anxiety disorders underscores the need for evidence-based interventions for these conditions. 
As reviewed below, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has strong theoretic foundations, 
comprises core treatment components informed by theory and practice, and has substantial 
research support that highlight it as the gold standard treatment of childhood anxiety 
disorders.

COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL MODEL OF CHILDHOOD ANXIETY

The cognitive behavioral model of child anxiety describes anxiety as a tripartite construct 
consisting of physiologic, cognitive, and behavioral components.6 Maladaptive cognitive 
patterns (eg, excessive worry, dysfunctional beliefs, obsessions) lead to the subjective 
experience of anxiety, which prompts maladaptive behaviors intended to reduce such anxiety 
(eg, avoidance, reassurance-seeking).7 Physiologic arousal (eg, somatic symptoms) plays an 
important role in this process, wherein a child’s physiologic arousal can trigger maladaptive 
thoughts that contribute to anxiety (eg, “My heart is beating fast, which means something 
is wrong”). Both theory and empirical evidence underscore the following cognitive and 
behavioral factors that precipitate and maintain child anxiety.

Cognitive Factors

Page 2

Theories of cognitive processing propose that cognitive biases contribute to the development 
and maintenance of childhood anxiety disorders.8 First, children with anxiety disorders 
attend more heavily toward threatening information than neutral or positive information 
(ie, attention biases).9 Second, children with anxiety disorders are predisposed to making 
negative or threatening interpretations of neutral or ambiguous stimuli (ie, interpretation 
biases). Greater levels of interpretation biases are associated with more severe anxiety 
symptoms,10 especially when the content of ambiguous stimuli matches the anxiety 
subtype.11 Interpretation biases are also stable over time and predict changes in anxiety.12 
Third, children with anxiety disorders are more likely to encode and recall threatening 
information over neutral or positive information (ie, memory biases).13 These cognitive 
biases independently and additively contribute to anxiety problems in youth.14

The expectancy model of anxiety15 posits that fear and avoidance are a function of 
one’s expectations of, and sensitivity toward, a feared outcome. Anxiety sensitivity—the 
predisposition to interpret physical, cognitive, and social consequences of anxiety as 
threatening (eg, temperature changes, mind-racing, or other people noticing one’s anxious 
responses) — is a cognitive factor that contributes to the development and maintenance 
of anxiety disorders in youth.15,16 Anxiety sensitivity is associated with anxiety symptom 
severity in children and adolescents,17 and youth with anxiety disorders report greater 
levels of anxiety sensitivity than nonanxious youth.18 Anxiety sensitivity precedes and 
prospectively predicts anxiety symptoms across time,19 further highlighting its contribution 
to the development of anxiety disorders.

Behavioral Factors

Behavioral factors also play a significant role in reinforcing problematic anxiety. 
Learning theory20 proposes that anxiety develops through several learning-related pathways, 
including aversive classic conditioning, observational learning or modeling, and information 
transmission.21 When a neutral stimulus is paired with an aversive event, that neutral 
stimulus becomes capable of eliciting an anxiety response—a process known as aversive 
classic conditioning. For example, a child bitten by a dog may pair dogs (ie, neutral 
stimulus) with being bitten (ie, aversive event); as a result, the child generalizes their fear 
to all dogs, and thus any dog may elicit a phobic response. Children can also acquire fears 
vicariously through observational learning. A child who observes their parents’ trepidation 
at approaching a new group of people may indirectly learn that such social encounters are 
dangerous, which can contribute to the development of social anxiety symptoms. Finally, 
children can acquire fears indirectly although verbal information received from others.22

Once fear learning has been established, avoidance behaviors maintain this learned fear. 
When children with anxiety disorders encounter a feared stimulus, and consequently 
experience anxiety, their instinctive response is to avoid this feared stimulus. Such avoidance 
provides temporary relief from anxiety and thus is negatively rein-forced (ie, more likely to 
occur again). However, when children repeatedly undergo this process, they learn to think 
that the feared stimulus is in fact dangerous, and that they are incapable of handling the

anxiety it provokes. Over time, anxious responses can become entrenched and increasingly 
severe.

CORE TREATMENT ELEMENTS OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY 

FOR CHILDHOOD ANXIETY

Although some CBT programs for anxiety are disorder-specific (eg, Social Effectiveness 
Therapy for Children),23 CBT programs have typically adopted a broad approach that 
targets a range of anxiety disorders (eg, Coping Cat).24 Although detailing individual CBT 
programs is outside the scope of this review, an overview of the core treatment elements 
commonly shared across treatment programs is offered.6,25

Psychoeducation

At the beginning of treatment, children and caregivers are provided psychoeducation about 
the nature of anxiety, anxiety disorders, the CBT model, and treatment details. An emphasis 
is placed on developing rapport with children and their parents in the first session because 
therapeutic alliance predicts positive treatment outcomes.26 They are taught that anxiety 
is a normal response to perceived threats and serves an evolutionary purpose of keeping 
us safe. Anxiety disorders, however, are characterized by anxiety that is out of proportion 
to the actual situation and interferes with the child’s day-to-day functioning (eg, a “faulty 
fire alarm”).24 Psychoeducation about anxiety disorders is shared to normalize the child’s 
experience. An overview of the CBT model is presented, with a focus on the interactions 
between the child’s physiologic sensations, thoughts, behaviors, and feelings. Finally, details 
of the treatment are outlined to set clear expectations and explain the rationale behind 
treatment.

Anxiety Management Strategies

Emotional awareness training—The goal of emotional awareness training is for 
children to recognize somatic, behavioral, and cognitive cues of anxiety so that they use 
other anxiety management techniques more effectively. Children are taught strategies to 
recognize their anxiety, distinguish anxiety from other feelings, and use the Subjective Units 
of Distress Scale (SUDS) to rate anxiety severity, which is often rated from 0 (no anxiety) to 
10 (maximum anxiety).

Relaxation training—Given the role of physiologic arousal in anxiety, relaxation training 
is commonly included in CBT programs. Diaphragmatic breathing exercises and progressive 
muscle relaxation may be taught to decrease physiologic arousal. However, recent research 
suggests that relaxation training may be a less central component of CBT for childhood 
anxiety disorders.27

Problem-solving—Children are taught to problem-solve anxiety-provoking situations 
using a step-by-step process: identify the problem, generate multiple solutions, evaluate 
the costs and benefits of each solution, choose and implement the best solution, and 
assess the outcomes. Typically, solutions generated during this process include variants of

Exposure

avoidance behaviors or “approach behaviors” (ie, facing the feared situation). Children learn 
to evaluate the pros and cons of these behaviors, in favor of choosing approach behaviors.

Cognitive restructuring—Consistent with cognitive theories of childhood anxiety 
disorders, children are taught to identify maladaptive cognitions that contribute to their 
anxiety and balance these with more adaptive thoughts. To help generate alternative 
thoughts, children systematically ask themselves a series of questions to assess and 
challenge overestimation of threat (eg, “How likely is the worst-case scenario?”) and 
overestimation of negative consequences (eg, “How bad would it actually be?”). Children 
may be assigned a thought log for in-between sessions, in which they record situations that 
triggered anxiety, automatic negative thoughts, alternative thoughts, changes in SUDS, and 
their behavioral responses.

Exposure is the key active ingredient in CBT for childhood anxiety disorders.28 Exposure 
techniques are based on extinction learning principles, or that repeated presentations 
of a feared stimulus without a negative outcome would result in extinction of a fear 
response.27,29 Recently, the inhibitory model of learning has been proposed to explain the 
process of change during exposures. The inhibitory model of learning argues that, rather 
than unlearning their fear, through exposure to their feared situation across diverse contexts, 
children learn new information (eg, “that spider probably will not bite me, and even if it 
does, I will be able to handle it”) that inhibits the fear (eg, “That spider is going to bite me 
and that would be really bad!”).30

Children and clinicians collaboratively develop an exposure hierarchy, which lists a series 
of feared situations in order of the child-perceived difficulty. Exposures can be imaginal (an 
exposure involving the imagination, such as writing a story or drawing a picture), in vivo 
(an exposure done while interacting with the actual feared situation), or a combination of 
the 2. Although determining exposures is a collaborative process, clinicians must ensure that 
the child’s core fear is being targeted. The first exposure chosen should be one that the 
therapist expects the child can reasonably handle, such that it is likely to be successful and 
provide the child a mastery experience. Mastery can be enhanced by practicing the same 
exposure several times to test whether the feared outcome occurs and by showing children 
that they can tolerate the distress that they previously perceived as unbearable. To facilitate 
engagement, clinicians can also propose exposure tasks that youth may find enjoyable, such 
as having children order food from their favorite restaurant if they have social anxiety.

Habituation-based exposures are typically conducted in a graduated fashion, from easier 
exposures to harder exposures. Although this may be more palatable for the child, it is 
not necessary for positive outcomes, assuming the child is willing to attempt exposures 
that evoke different levels of anxiety. The child and clinician may instead choose to move 
between easier and harder tasks or combine exposures in creative ways; this approach 
may improve outcomes by facilitating generalization of inhibitory learning.31 That said, for 
children who are reluctant to try more difficult exposures, progressing from easier to more 
difficult is one strategy that may help facilitate engagement.

Clinicians monitor child-reported SUDS throughout exposures. Habituation-based models 
of exposure recommend a common rule-of-thumb that an exposure continues until the 
child reports at least a 50% reduction in SUDS from baseline, to ensure that habituation 
has occurred. Inhibitory learning models of exposure, however, recommend that exposures 
only need to continue until the child’s expectation (eg, that something bad will happen) is 
violated and inhibitory learning occurs.31 Regardless of the exposure duration, clinicians 
must ensure children are not using maladaptive coping strategies, both overt (eg, looking 
away from the feared stimulus) and covert (eg, mentally disengaging). To ensure children are 
practicing and generalizing their learning to other situations, exposure exercises are given as 
homework, and a reward program can be used to reinforce exposure homework completion.

Relapse Prevention

Near the end of treatment, clinician, children, and caregivers consider how children will 
handle anxiety-provoking situations in the future. Termination occurs not when the child 
is able to tolerate situations facilitated by the clinician but rather when the child becomes 
adept at generalizing their skills to various situations independently. Following termination, 
“booster sessions” may also be offered at increasingly wide intervals, to ensure therapeutic 
gains are maintained posttreatment.

RESEARCH SUPPORT FOR COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR 

CHILDHOOD ANXIETY

CBT—exposures in particular—is the gold standard for treating anxiety disorders in 
children, as supported by empirical evidence.25,32–35 Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
demonstrate its efficacy, with recovery rates posttreatment ranging between 47% and 
66%35 and response rates ranging between 57% and 60%.36–38 CBT for childhood anxiety 
disorders also shows acceptability and safety, with no adverse effects and lower dropout 
rates than pharmacotherapy or pill placebo.34

Comparisons with Waitlist Control

Meta-analyses consistently show that CBT outperforms waitlist or no treatment controls 
in terms of improvement in primary anxiety symptoms.34,39 CBT is more than 4 times 
more likely to increase remission and treatment response than waitlist or no treatment.34 
Brief, intensive, and concentrated versions of CBT also outperform waitlist controls at 
posttreatment.32

Comparisons with Active Treatment

Evidence of the superiority of CBT to other active treatments is promising. A meta-
analysis found that CBT outperformed attention control (eg, psychoeducation for family 
members, relaxation, therapist support).39 Although this meta-analysis found that CBT 
did not significantly differ from treatment-as-usual, there was significant heterogeneity 
between trials,39 which indicates that these results should be interpreted with caution. 
Brief, intensive, and concentrated CBT outperform attention control (eg, education/support, 
nondirective therapy) at posttreatment but do not significantly differ from other active

treatment conditions (eg, eye movement desensitization reprocessing therapy).32 With 
regard to pharmacotherapy, CBT outperforms fluoxetine alone and sertraline alone, and 
the combination of CBT and sertraline outperforms either treatment alone as well as 
placebo.34 Finally, a meta-analysis examining the effect CBT for childhood anxiety on 
secondary outcomes found that, in comparison to active control (eg, another treatment, 
self-monitoring, attention placebo, treatment-as-usual), CBT led to greater improvements in 
depressive symptoms and general functioning.40

Key Ingredients

Although typical CBT protocols begin with anxiety management strategies (ie, emotion 
awareness, relaxation training, cognitive restructuring), recent dismantling studies suggest 
that exposure is the key ingredient contributing to positive treatment outcomes.28,41 Anxiety 
management strategies alone are not associated with improvements in anxiety symptoms and 
may even be negatively associated with improvements in functioning.28,41 In the seminal 
Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study, the introduction of exposure and cognitive 
restructuring accelerated children’s improvement in symptoms; in contrast, the introduction 
of relaxation techniques had little impact.42 Further, more time devoted to difficult 
exposures (rather than easy or moderate) and increased child compliance and mastery 
within exposure sessions has been linked to better outcomes.43 Relatedly, introduction of 
cognitive skills may slow down treatment progress.44 A meta-analysis of RCTs comparing 
CBT conditions to no-treatment control found that more in-session exposure was associated 
with larger effect sizes (ie, larger difference between CBT condition and no-treatment 
control), and inclusion of relaxation training was associated with smaller pretreatment to 
posttreatment effect sizes.27

Family Involvement in Treatment

Family accommodation (ie, parents modify their behavior to help children avoid/decrease 
distress from anxiety) has been linked to increased symptom severity, impairment, and 
worse treatment outcomes for childhood anxiety disorders; therefore, several CBT programs 
have included parents in treatment.45,46 Past studies have shown mixed results regarding 
the increased efficacy of including parents in child anxiety treatment45,47; however, these 
studies may not have emphasized certain types of family involvement (eg, parental 
involvement focused on contingency management).48 In contrast, when family involvement 
specifically targets parental accommodation, as has been the case in obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD), it seems that including families bolsters outcomes.49 Accordingly, stand-
alone parent-based treatments aimed at decreasing family accommodation have shown 
noninferiority to individual child CBT among children with non-OCD anxiety disorders,50 
although comparison to family-based CBT is needed. Further, a meta-analysis that compared 
family CBT to child-only CBT found that parent–child interventions were most effective 
in treating anxiety disorders in children.51 Parental involvement may be more important for 
girls, younger children of either sex, and children with anxiety comorbid with ADHD.52,53 
Overall, parental involvement is likely an important element of CBT for childhood anxiety 
disorders.

Innovation in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Delivery

Recent CBT research has examined digital mental health interventions to improve access 
and efficiency of treatment.54 A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of telehealth versus face-
to-face CBT interventions for anxiety disorders in youth and adults found no differences 
in anxiety symptom reduction, therapist-reported or client-reported working alliance, or 
client satisfaction between the 2 treatment-delivery modalities.55 In the studies reviewed, 
participants had a primary diagnosis of OCD or generalized anxiety disorder, so future 
research is needed to generalize these findings to all anxiety disorders. Additionally, a meta-
analysis of computer-based programs that deliver CBT for youth anxiety, such as BRAVE56 
and Woebot.57 found that computer-based CBT yielded similar effects compared with active 
treatment controls (ie, face-to-face CBT or treatment as usual). Of the 24 studies in the 
meta-analysis, 10 interventions were self-guided, whereas 14 were guided by a therapist or 
researcher, which included telephone and/or email contact with participants, chat sessions, 
or face-to-face guidance during module completion. Methodological limitations in this 
literature, such as primarily using self-report measures for outcome data and inappropriate 
handling of missing data, necessitate additional research.58 Further, several studies have 
demonstrated improvements in anxiety symptoms after virtual reality exposure therapy 
(VRET).59 Gutiérrez-Maldonado and colleagues60 (2009) showed better treatment outcomes 
for children in VRET compared with wait-list control, whereas St-Jacques and colleagues61 
(2010) demonstrated similar outcomes between VRET and CBT-based in vivo exposure. 
However, future controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed.59 Finally, mobile apps 
are another tool that could be used as adjuncts to CBT treatment to help monitor homework 
compliance and guide exposure implementation. Anxiety Coach and SmartCat are 2 mobile 
apps that have demonstrated preliminary effectiveness as adjuncts to treatment.62,63

Predictors of Treatment Outcomes

Identifying predictors of treatment outcomes inform efforts to personalize CBT for 
childhood anxiety disorders. Poorer treatment outcomes are predicted by greater anxiety 
severity at baseline, comorbid externalizing symptoms/disorders, and a primary diagnosis 
of social anxiety disorder.64 Comorbid depression, parental psychopathology, and parental 
anxiety may also predict poor treatment outcomes but this evidence is less consistent.64 
Other predictors of poorer treatment outcomes for anxiety-disordered children undergoing 
CBT have included female gender65 and higher levels of caregiver strain.66

Practice Guidelines

Consistent with empirical evidence, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent 
Psychiatry’s Clinical Practice Guidelines33 provides a Level 1 recommendation (ie, the 
strongest recommendation) for CBT in treating children and adolescents with social anxiety, 
generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, panic disorder, and specific phobia.33 Similarly, 
based on a review of 111 treatment outcome studies, the Society for Clinical Child 
and Adolescent Psychology’s practice guidelines identify CBT as a “well-established” 
evidence-based treatment (ie, the strongest level of empirical support) for youth with anxiety 
disorders.25

Limitations

Page 8

Although extensive, the literature of RCTs for CBT in treating childhood anxiety disorders 
is limited by inconsistent or limited reporting of outcome measures, long-term effects of 
CBT, and clinically relevant variables (eg, demographic information).34,35 Further, relatively 
few RCTs include children outside the 7 to 14-year age range, compare CBT with 
active treatment conditions, examine inpatient or intensive outpatient settings, assess for 
adverse effects, or examine adaptations of CBT (eg, technology-assisted CBT, parent-based 
CBT).34,35 Finally, given that RCTs are commonly conducted in controlled settings with 
highly trained and closely supervised therapists, less is known about reproducibility of these 
outcomes in routine care.35

CASE VIGNETTE

Sarah was a 13-year-old girl who presented for treatment with her mother because of 
worries related to completing school assignments and being late for events, and anxiety 
associated with eating in front of others and speaking with unfamiliar adults.a When 
completing homework, Sarah wanted her parents in the same room to respond to her 
reassurance-seeking questions regarding schoolwork. In addition, Sarah worried about being 
late to school and other activities, such as basketball practice. Further, Sarah struggled with 
eating in front of people because she feared judgment. Instead of eating lunch at school, 
she would eat small snacks throughout the day when others were not watching. Finally, she 
never ordered food for herself at restaurants, and at stores, she asked her mother to go to 
self-checkout to avoid talking with store clerks.

After a comprehensive evaluation, Sarah was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder 
and social anxiety disorder. A family-based CBT treatment plan was implemented, 
which included an initial assessment of symptoms, functional impairment, and family 
accommodation. Sarah was hesitant to speak with the therapist during the initial session, 
so most of the first session was focused on building rapport by playing a game and 
discussing her hobbies. Sarah and her mother were also provided with psychoeducation, 
which included an explanation of the development and maintenance of anxiety symptoms 
and the impacts of avoidance and reassurance seeking. Further, the therapist discussed the 
CBT treatment model using developmentally appropriate language. A motivational reward 
program was implemented, in which Sarah earned tokens for attending sessions, completing 
out-of-session homework, and participating in sessions.

In subsequent sessions, Sarah and her mother developed an exposure hierarchy with the 
therapist, which included a list of potential exposure exercises that Sarah rated on a 0 to 
10 SUDS rating scale (Table 1). Sarah started with easier exposure exercises, with most 
exposures implemented in session before being completed for homework. For instance, 
Sarah ate in front of the therapist in session before completing her at-home exposure of 
eating in front of her family at dinner. The therapist also introduced a thought log (Table 
2), in which Sarah tracked the triggers, thoughts, and behaviors associated with her anxiety 

aThis case was based on the combination of several children with anxiety disorders that were treated in our clinical work. It was 
intended to show how CBT is administered in practice. The case is not based on a specific patient.

symptoms. She was taught how to identify anxious thoughts and replace them with more 
realistic alternative thoughts.

Most of the treatment sessions involved the following format: (1) review exposure 
homework from the previous week, (2) discuss the thought log from the previous week (for 
situations in which Sarah struggled to develop more realistic counter thoughts, the therapist 
used collaborative questioning to help generate alternative thoughts), and (3) complete an 
in-session exposure exercise. During exposures, Sarah understood not to use her cognitive 
restructuring techniques, and the therapist reminded her to focus on the feared situation. 
Throughout treatment, the therapist encouraged Sarah’s mother to coach Sarah during the 
in-session exposure exercises to help prepare them for exposure practice at home. The 
therapist also talked with Sarah’s mother about the importance of not accommodating at 
home (eg, leaving for school and basketball practice early, providing Sarah with reassurance 
about schoolwork, ordering for her at restaurants).

However, as the exposure exercises became more challenging, Sarah’s parents were hesitant 
to complete certain exposures, such as mom not helping Sarah with her homework and 
showing up to school 5 minutes late. A parent-only session was scheduled to explore 
how parents’ anxiety may be related to hesitancy in completing the more challenging 
assignments. Parents reported that they felt guilty because not accommodating Sarah’s 
requests in these situations led to distress and increased anxiety. Psychoeducation related 
to maintenance of anxiety symptoms was reviewed, and the therapist discussed how these 
accommodations can help reduce Sarah’s anxiety and distress in the short term but often 
lead to more problems in the long term. The therapist also reviewed Sarah’s progress in 
treatment, which was partially associated with her parents decreasing their reassurance and 
accommodations in different situations.

As treatment progressed, Sarah’s anxiety symptoms gradually decreased, and she avoided 
fewer situations at school and home. This led to less functional impairment in school, social, 
and familial domains. At the end of treatment, Sarah was able to eat lunch with her friends, 
complete schoolwork independently, and communicate with adults in social settings. Sarah 
faced her feared situations that she had previously avoided, and she discovered that her 
feared outcomes did not occur during the exposure exercises. Toward the end of treatment, 
sessions were spaced 2 to 3 weeks apart, and relapse prevention was discussed with Sarah 
and her parents. The therapist reviewed the techniques Sarah learned in treatment and helped 
prepare her in the event future increases in anxiety symptoms occur.

DISCUSSION

Anxiety disorders are frequently diagnosed in children and adolescents and can lead to 
impairment in multiple domains.1,5 CBT is the gold standard treatment of childhood 
anxiety disorders, with support from empirical evidence and practice guidelines.25,33,35 
Further, dismantling studies have shown that exposures are a core component of CBT 
for childhood anxiety disorders as anxiety management strategies alone are not associated 
with improvements in anxiety symptoms.28,41 The section below reviews several important

components regarding delivery of CBT for childhood anxiety disorders and discusses ways 
to overcome challenges associated with treatment.

Importance of Exposures

As detailed above, exposures is a key ingredient for positive treatment outcomes in CBT 
for childhood anxiety disorders.28,41,44 However, it has been found that therapists who treat 
children with anxiety disorders rarely used exposures because of unsubstantiated negative 
beliefs related to the safety, tolerability, and ethicality of exposures.67,68 Other techniques, 
such as thought stopping and replacing negative thoughts with positive distraction, were 
used more often. This is unfortunate because such strategies may lead to avoidance of 
anxiety, which prolongs therapy and decreases treatment effectiveness.69 Further, when 
exposures were delivered in treatment, they were typically patient self-directed instead of 
therapist-assisted, which tends to be less useful.68 Fortunately, negative clinician beliefs 
related to exposures are amendable. Didactic trainings for therapists that include experiential 
learning and patient testimonials related to exposures have been shown to decrease these 
negative beliefs.70 Dissemination of CBT treatment should continue to emphasize the 
rationale for and safety of exposures to clinicians.

Addressing Clinical Complexities

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders typically have comorbid psychiatric 
conditions, such as other anxiety, mood, and externalizing disorders.3,4 These comorbidities 
often lead to additional complexities and challenges; therefore, thorough assessment, 
case conceptualization, and treatment planning are critical for best treatment outcomes. 
Clinicians should assess how comorbidities may affect treatment and consider whether to 
treat comorbidities simultaneously or sequentially to the primary anxiety disorder. Weisz and 
colleagues71 (2012) indicated that incorporating free-standing modules from other evidence-
based treatments for comorbid conditions may lead to enhanced outcomes. CBT for youth 
anxiety has also been adapted for certain conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder. 
Behavioral Interventions for Anxiety in Children with Autism, which includes core CBT and 
modules for social skills, disruptive behaviors in school, and OCD-specific behaviors, has 
led to moderate treatment effect sizes.72,73

Additionally, clinicians should adapt CBT treatment depending on the age of the 
child or adolescent. For instance, CBT with preadolescents should include increased 
parental involvement, with developmentally appropriate child psychoeducation and behavior 
management skills training for parents. Clinicians also must consider the unique 
developmental needs of adolescents and tailor treatment accordingly. Further, several 
programs have been developed for young children74 and adolescents with anxiety75 that 
tailor to their specific needs.

Recommendations for Clinicians

CBT is the most well-established treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety 
disorders, with support from a strong literature base that demonstrates significant 
improvements in anxiety symptoms and impairment after treatment. Based on the literature

presented above, the following recommendations regarding anxiety disorder treatment of 
youth are offered:

•

•

•

Use a multimethod, multi-informant assessment to develop a case 
conceptualization and treatment plan designed to fit the needs of the diverse 
population of youth with anxiety disorders.

Exposure exercises tailored to the child or adolescent’s presenting concern 
should be a core component of treatment.

Evaluate for possible clinical complexities and developmental needs when 
personalizing CBT for youth with anxiety.

KEY POINTS

•

•

•

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an empirically supported 
psychotherapeutic treatment of childhood anxiety disorders.

Exposure therapy is the active component underlying the efficacy of CBT for 
childhood anxiety disorders.

Clinicians using CBT for childhood anxiety disorders should incorporate a 
thorough assessment, case conceptualization, and treatment plan that adapts 
to the needs of all patients.

CLINICS CARE POINTS

•

•

•

At the beginning of treatment, do not assume that standard CBT will 
be effective for each child; assess for possible clinical complexities or 
developmental needs that may need to be addressed in treatment.

When completing exposures with youth, remind them to focus on the feared 
situation and avoid providing reassurance.

When developing an exposure hierarchy, include feared situations with a 
varied degree of child-perceived difficulty and avoid only including exposures 
with high or low levels of difficulty.
