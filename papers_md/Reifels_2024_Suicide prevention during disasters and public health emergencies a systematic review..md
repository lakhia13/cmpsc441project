disasters and public health 
emergencies: a systematic review

Background:  Disasters  and  public  health  emergencies  increasingly  affect 
populations  around  the  world,  posing  significant  wide-ranging  challenges  for 
societies as well as for effective public health and suicide prevention. Intervention 
research is essential to inform evidence-based responses. Yet, despite evident 
public  concern  and  growing  research  interest  in  heightened  suicide  risks  and 
impacts, little is known about effective suicide prevention interventions in these 
contexts. We conducted a systematic review to examine the outcomes of suicide 
prevention strategies implemented in disasters and public health emergencies.

Methods:  We  searched  five  databases  (Medline,  Embase,  PsycINFO,  Web  of 
Science,  PTSDpubs)  from  inception  to  December  2022  for  peer-reviewed 
quantitative  studies  that  reported  relevant  intervention  outcomes  (changes  in 
the frequency of suicide, suicide attempts, self-harm) for populations affected 
by disasters and public health emergencies. We assessed the quality of eligible 
studies using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies, and distilled 
review findings through narrative synthesis. The study protocol was registered 
with PROSPERO (CRD42021276195).

Results: Ten eligible and mostly observational studies were included in this review, 
which  examined  a  range  of  universal,  selective,  and  indicated  interventions. 
Three of five studies of interventions in public health emergencies indicated the 
potential effectiveness and buffering effects of generic disaster related mental 
health support, access to urban parks, as well as the beneficial role of video-
enabled tablets in facilitating treatment access and outcomes. Similarly, three 
of  five  studies  of  interventions  in  disaster  contexts  provided  evidence  of  the 
beneficial role of universal economic security measures, national gun laws and 
buy  back  schemes,  and  volunteer-delivered  mental  health  support.  Overall, 
four of six studies with favorable outcomes examined interventions specifically 
deployed in disaster or public health emergency contexts, whereas two studies 
examined ongoing existing interventions. Three studies, respectively, of suicide 
prevention  focused  interventions  or  generic  interventions  reported  favorable 
outcomes. The quality of included studies was variable, with two studies being 
rated  as  ‘strong’,  four  studies  rated  as  ‘moderate’,  and  four  studies  rated  as 
‘weak’.

Conclusion: Notwithstanding the limited scope and variable quality of published 
evidence,  our  review  findings  highlight  the  breadth  of  interventions  that  have 
been applied in such contexts with some success. There is a need for further 
research  on  effective  interventions  and  intervention  adaptations  to  inform 
evidence-based  suicide  prevention  responses  to  disasters  and  public  health 
emergencies.

1 Introduction

2 Methods

Suicide  is  a  major  global  public  health  concern  that  calls 
for  effective  and  concerted  preventive  intervention  (1).  Each 
year, approximately 700,000 people die by suicide (2). Suicide 
is  a  complex  phenomenon  which  is  influenced  by  a  range 
of  contextual  factors  that  include  prevailing  social,  socio-
economic, and environmental conditions. These can no longer 
be  relied  upon  as  immutable  or  enduring,  and  are  rather  in 
themselves  often  subject  to  ever  more  rapid  change  and 
disruption (3, 4).

Disasters and public health emergencies (such as pandemics 
and epidemics) are increasingly affecting populations around the 
world  (5,  6),  with  significant  wide-ranging  implications  for 
societies,  human  livelihoods,  health,  and  wellbeing,  as  well  as 
public health (7). Many established proximal and contextual risk 
factors  for  suicide  (8,  9),  such  as  adverse  life  events,  losses, 
financial stressors, social isolation, reduced social support and 
healthcare access, are present or elevated in the wake of disasters 
(10) and public health emergencies (11). While suicidal behavior 
trajectories can vary following disasters (with some indications 
of  an  early  drop  and  delayed  increase  pattern)  (12),  overall 
suicide  rates  have  been  found  to  increase  among  whole 
populations and male subpopulations (13).

Suicidality has also been of significant public concern during 
protracted public health emergencies, such as prominently in the 
unfolding Covid-19 pandemic (14). National suicide rates did not 
increase in the first 15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (15, 
16).  Yet,  systematic  reviews  and  expert  guidance  highlight  a 
continued  need  for  vigilance  (17)  in  view  of  elevated  distress 
levels  among  affected  populations  (18),  rising  self-harm 
presentations among young people (19), heightened suicidality 
risk  among  COVID-19  patients  (18),  increased  demand  for 
non-acute  support  services  (20,  21),  and  strain  on  frontline 
healthcare  workers  (22).  All  of  these  have  implications  for 
targeted suicide prevention efforts during these challenging and 
disruptive circumstances (23).

Although  the  broader  evidence  base  for  effective  suicide 
prevention approaches across the spectrum of universal, selective, 
and  indicated  interventions  is  consolidating  (24,  25),  little  is 
known about the outcomes of suicide prevention activities during 
disasters and public health emergencies. In fact, much research 
to date has focused on the epidemiology of suicidality in such 
contexts,  while  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  research  on 
inform  evidence-based  suicide 
interventions  (18,  26)  to 
prevention  responses  (27).  What  types  of  routine  existing 
or 
interventions 
have  been  found  to  be  effective  in  such  contexts  therefore 
remains  an  open  question.  To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first 
systematic review to examine the outcomes of suicide prevention 
strategies  implemented  in  the  context  of  disasters  and  public 
health emergencies.

This  systematic  review  is  presented  following  the  Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
(28)  and  the  review  protocol  was  prospectively  registered  with 
PROSPERO (CRD42021276195).

2.1 Eligibility criteria

Studies meeting the following eligibility criteria were included:

 •  Population: Populations affected by disasters (marked by natural, 
technological  hazards)  or  public  health 
infectious 

(including  epidemics,  pandemics, 

human-induced, 
emergencies 
disease outbreaks)

 •  Intervention: Any type of strategy, program, intervention with an 
explicit  focus  on  suicide  prevention  or  postvention  (or  other 
intervention  reporting  suicidality/self-harm  outcomes)  for 
populations affected by disasters or public health emergencies
 •  Context: New, existing, or adapted suicide prevention strategies, 
programs, interventions implemented in the context of disasters 
and public health emergencies (including rapid or slow onset 
events, and protracted emergencies)

 •  Outcomes: Changes in the frequency of suicide attempts, suicide 

deaths, or self-harm (reported by any measure)

 •  Study design: Quantitative studies (or quantitative components 

of mixed-method studies)

 •  Comparator: Intervention studies including any comparator (e.g., 

before/after, by sub-group, by intervention type)

 •  Article  type:  English 

language,  peer-reviewed,  empirical 

studies, human

Exclusion criteria:

 •  Context: Euthanasia, assisted dying, warfare, armed conflict, civil 

unrest, economic crisis

 •  Outcomes: Non-suicidal self-injury, suicidal ideation, composite 

suicidality measures

 •  Study design: Qualitative studies
 •  Article  type:  Commentaries,  editorials,  conference  abstracts, 

dissertations/theses, grey literature

2.2 Information sources

We  searched  five  literature  databases,  Medline  (Ovid),  Embase 
(Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Web of Science (Clarivate), and PTSDpubs/
PILOTS (ProQuest), and conducted additional reference list screening 
of  selected  review  papers  and  forward  citation  searches  of  relevant 
study protocols.

2.3 Search strategy

All databases were initially searched on 14 January 2022 (from 
database inception to search date), and the entire search was updated 
on 7 December 2022. The searches used a combination of MeSH terms 
and  database  specific  key  words  regarding  the  three  domains  of 
outcome (suicidality and self-harm), context (disaster, public health 
emergency, infectious disease outbreak), and intervention. Full search 
strategies for all databases and definitions of key terms are included in 
the Supplementary Material.

2.4 Selection process

A two-stage record screening and study selection process was 
undertaken  by  two  researchers,  using  EndNote.  First,  two 
researchers  (LR,  KK)  independently  screened  the  titles  and 
abstracts of records to identify potentially eligible studies. Second, 
two researchers (LR, KK) independently assessed the full texts of 
potentially  eligible  studies  against  the  review  inclusion  and 
exclusion criteria to identify studies to be included in the review. 
Any disagreements were resolved through discussion or referral to 
a third researcher (KA).

2.5 Data extraction and synthesis

One researcher (LR) extracted the following data from included 
studies using a piloted data extraction tool (set up in MS Excel), and 
all data were checked by a second researcher (KK):

 •  Study characteristics (title, primary author, journal, publication 

year, study aim, design, language)

 •  Sample characteristics (sample size, mean age, age range, gender, 

ethnicity, country, study period)

 •  Type of disaster exposure (disaster type, year, exposure measure)
 •  Intervention characteristics (intervention type, modality, setting, 

timing relative to disaster, new/existing/adapted)

 •  Outcome measures (for suicide, suicide attempts, self-harm)
 •  Results (main findings, effect sizes, limitations)

Study  findings  were  distilled  through  narrative  synthesis 
(including  tabulation  and  grouping  by  context  and  intervention 
subgroups). Substantial study heterogeneity (regarding interventions, 
outcome measures, target populations, and settings) precluded formal 
meta-analysis and calculation of pooled effect estimates.

2.6 Study quality appraisal

We used the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies to 
assess the methodological quality of the included studies (29). The 
instrument  includes  six  components  (selection  bias,  study  design, 
confounders, blinding, data collection methods, and withdrawals and 
dropouts) to be scored as strong, moderate, or weak. A study was rated 
‘strong’ if none of its components was rated ‘weak’. A study was rated 
‘moderate’ if one of the components was rated ‘weak’, and it was rated 
‘weak’ if two or more of its components were rated as ‘weak’ (29). The 

instrument also assesses the integrity of the intervention and analyses 
(e.g.,  appropriate  statistical  methods).  Two  researchers  (KK,  KA) 
independently assessed the quality of the included studies. There was 
substantial agreement between the two researchers (κ = 0.64), and they 
resolved  any  disagreement  by  discussion,  or  by  referral  to  a  third 
researcher (LR).

3 Results

3.1 Study selection

The study selection process is presented in the flow chart diagram 
(Figure  1).  Database  searches  yielded  a  combined  total  of  12,061 
records. Following removal of 4,707 duplicates, 7,354 records were 
initially screened by title and abstract, leading to the exclusion of 7,234 
records.  Full-text  eligibility  assessment  of  120  remaining  reports 
resulted  in  the  exclusion  of  109  reports  (including  45  reports  not 
constituting  empirical  studies,  37  reports  not  examining  relevant 
outcomes, 18 reports reflecting ineligible article types, 5 reports not 
examining an intervention, and 4 reports lacking a relevant context). 
Additional reference list and forward citation searches identified 5 
potentially eligible reports, which were excluded at full-text assessment 
at these did not meet the inclusion criteria. Ultimately, 11 reports 
relating to 10 studies were included in the systematic review (30–40). 
Of the two reports referring to the same study (38, 39), only the most 
recent was considered (38), as the other did not provide additional 
relevant data.

3.2 Study characteristics

Table 1 presents the characteristics of included studies, published 
between the years 2008 and 2022. In terms of geographical location, 
five of the ten studies were conducted in Asia (India, Japan, South 
Korea), two studies, respectively, in North America (Canada, U.S.A.) 
and Oceania (Australia), and one study in Europe (U.K.). Five studies 
examined interventions in the context of public health emergencies 
(Covid-19 pandemic, 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, 2015 Middle 
East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS epidemic), while the other five 
studies  focused  on  disaster  contexts  (marked  by  mass  shootings, 
tsunamis, or multiple hazards). Most study designs were observational 
in nature, including cohort studies, time series, or interrupted time 
series analyses, and only one study adopted a randomized controlled 
trial design.

The examined intervention types included psychiatric hospital 
treatment,  disaster  related  mental  health  support,  video-enabled 
tablets, CBT-skills training, and varied universal measures (including 
national gun laws and buy back scheme, a suicide prevention act, 
economic security measures, as well as urban parks). Interventions 
were  either  ongoing  existing  measures  (30,  31,  34,  37,  40)  or 
specifically deployed in disaster contexts (32, 33, 35, 36, 38). Some 
interventions included an explicit focus on suicide prevention (31, 33, 
34, 37), whereas other generic interventions did not (30, 32, 35, 36, 38, 
40). Target groups for interventions were whole populations (30, 34, 
36, 38), people in disaster affected areas (33, 35), rural veterans (31), 
psychiatric hospital patients (40), school students (37), and bereaved 
tsunami survivors (32).

Studies reported intervention outcomes in terms of suicide (30, 
33–35), firearm suicide (36, 38), suicide attempts (31, 32, 37), and 
self-harm (40). Study comparators included pre/post comparisons (34, 
36, 38), different hospital ward types (40), affected versus non-affected 
areas (33, 35), control groups not receiving the intervention (31, 32, 
37), and variations in per capita park area (30).

3.3 Intervention outcomes

3.3.1 Outcomes by context

Of  the  five  studies  examining  interventions  in  public  health 
emergency contexts, three observational studies reported a reduction 
in suicides and suicide attempts (30, 31, 33), one observational study 
provided mixed results (40), and one RCT found the intervention not 
effective in reducing suicide attempts (37). Specifically, the study by 
Orui et al. (33) examined suicide rates during the Covid-19 pandemic 
in  areas  that  had  previously  been  affected  by  the  Japanese  triple 
(earthquake, tsunami and nuclear) disaster, and which continued to 
receive ongoing disaster mental health support, by comparison to 
unaffected areas not receiving such support. This study found that the 
suicide related standard mortality ratio rose to 1.20 in unaffected areas 
during  the  pandemic  and  remained  relatively  stable  at  0.98  in 
intervention areas, indicative of a possible buffering effect of existing 
support.  The  study  by  Kim  et  al.  (30)  reported  that  urban  parks 
functioned as a mitigator of increasing suicide rates in the 2009 H1N1 
pandemic in that with every 1m2 per person increase in park area, the 
suicide rate per 100,000 people decreased by 0.38. The study by Gujral 
et al. (31) found that escalated distribution of video-enabled tablets 
among  rural  US  veterans  during  the  Covid-19  pandemic  was 

associated  with  increased  mental  health  service  use  and  a  22% 
decrease in the likelihood of suicide behavior. Challinor et al. (40) 
monitored  self-harm  incidents  among  patients  of  different  secure 
psychiatric  hospital  wards  during  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  Study 
findings indicated that a higher self-harm incidence during the initial 
pandemic stage particularly on high-dependency personality disorder 
wards (which coincided with the first lockdown and ward containment 
measures), subsided thereafter (coinciding with the safe resumption 
of treatment as usual). Finally, the RCT conducted by Klim-Conforti 
et al. (37) during the Covid-19 pandemic indicated no benefits of 
CBT-skills training in reducing suicide attempts among urban school 
students  when  compared  to  a  control  group  not  receiving 
the intervention.

Three of five studies examining interventions in disaster contexts 
provided encouraging results (32, 35, 38) while two studies provided 
no evidence of intervention effectiveness (34, 36). The interrupted 
time series study by Chapman et al. (38) indicated a step change and 
accelerated decline in annual firearm suicides with the introduction 
of the national gun laws and buyback scheme in the wake of Australia’s 
worst mass shooting. By contrast, the time series analysis by Lee et al. 
(36) conducted in the same disaster context provided no evidence of 
a structural break in firearm suicide growth rates around the time of 
the  intervention.  The  cohort  study  by  Matsubayashi  et  al.  (35) 
examined economic security measures and suicide rates in the context 
of  the  Japanese  triple  disaster,  finding  that  a  per-capita  increase 
in local government expenditure was associated with a decrease in the 
suicide  rate  among  men.  The  interrupted  time  series  study  by 
Nakanishi  et  al.  (34)  conducted  in  the  same  context  provided  no 
evidence that suicide trends were interrupted by the introduction of a 
national suicide prevention Act. Finally, the cohort-analytical study by

Vijayakumar et al. (32) examined volunteer delivered mental health 
support among bereaved tsunami survivors, reporting significantly 
less  suicide  attempts  in  the  intervention  group  compared  to  a 
control group.

3.3.2 Outcomes by intervention

Only two of five studies examining ongoing existing interventions 
(i.e., urban parks and video-enabled tablets) (30, 31) and four of five 
studies  of  interventions  specifically  deployed  in  disaster  or  public 
health  emergency  contexts  (i.e.,  gun  laws  and  buyback  scheme, 
economic security measures, disaster mental health interventions, 
volunteer delivered mental health support) (32, 33, 35, 38) reported 
findings indicative of intervention effectiveness. Similarly, three of five 
studies,  respectively,  examining  suicide  prevention 
focused 
interventions (31–33) or generic interventions (30, 35, 38) reported 
reductions in suicidality outcomes. Two studies which examined the 
same universal intervention (gun laws and buy back scheme), using 
varying time series designs, provided contradictory results in terms of 
intervention effectiveness (36, 38).

3.4 Study quality

The study quality assessment is outlined in the Supplementary Material. 
The overall quality of included studies was variable, with two studies being 
rated as ‘strong’ (34, 38), four studies rated as ‘moderate’ (30, 33, 35, 36), 
and four studies rated as ‘weak’ (31, 32, 37, 40). The quality domains rated 
most  strongly  across  studies  were  selection  bias  and  data  collection 
methods. Four studies with overall ‘weak’ quality ratings were each rated 
‘weak’  on  two  quality  domains  in  terms  of  blinding  (31,  32,  37), 
confounders (32, 40), selection bias (37), data collection methods (40), or 
withdrawals and dropouts (31).

4 Discussion

This  systematic  review  identified  10  studies  which  reported 
changes  in  suicidality  outcomes  associated  with  interventions 
conducted in the context of disasters and public health emergencies. 
Taken together, the limited scope of published evidence, variable study 
quality, and diversity of interventions and contexts precluded firm 
assessments  of  intervention  effectiveness.  Yet,  our  review  findings 
provide several valuable insights that can help to inform future suicide 
prevention practice and research in these increasingly pervasive and 
challenging contexts (41).

Overall, our findings highlight the breadth of interventions that 
have been applied and studied in these contexts (including explicit 
suicide prevention and generic interventions, ongoing existing and 
specifically  deployed  interventions,  across  the  full  spectrum  of 
universal,  selective,  and  indicated  intervention).  Notwithstanding 
evidence limitations, the included studies provided some indication 
of  favorable  intervention  outcomes  in  the  context  of  pandemics 
and disasters.

Two  cohort  studies  of  moderate  quality  provided  preliminary 
evidence  of  potentially  mitigating  effects  of  urban  parks  (30)  and 
ongoing disaster mental health interventions (33) on suicide rates 
during pandemics. Yet, neither study design permitted firm causal 
attribution or fully accounted for relevant confounders. A third cohort 

study indicated that escalated distribution of video-enabled tablets 
among veterans during a pandemic improved mental health service 
engagement  and  reduced  suicidal  behavior  (31).  Whilst  rating 
positively on several quality domains, this study did not account for 
blinding  and  dropouts.  By  contrast  to  the  broader  evidence  on 
effective school-based suicide prevention (42, 43), the study adopting 
the  most  robust  RCT  design  (but  of  weak  overall  quality  due  to 
potential selection bias and blinding concerns) found school-based 
CBT-skills training not to be effective in reducing student suicide 
attempts during a pandemic (37). Findings of a fourth cohort study 
remained  inconclusive  but  indicated  fluctuations  in  the  self-harm 
incidence among secure psychiatric hospital patients in alignment 
lock  down 
with  adapted  service  delivery  during  pandemic 
restrictions (40).

Within disaster contexts, two cohort studies (32, 35) highlighted 
that  increased  economic  security  measures  in  terms  of  local 
government spending were associated with decreased suicide rates 
among men, while volunteer delivered mental health support was 
associated with decreased suicide attempts among bereaved survivors. 
Two  studies  examining  the  same  national  gun  laws  and  buy  back 
scheme  provided  contradictory  results,  with  one  study  of  strong 
quality (and backed by two reports) indicating positive effects (38), 
whereas the other study of moderate quality and employing a differing 
analysis did not (36). Reduced suicide rates previously associated with 
the introduction of national suicide prevention programs and acts (44, 
45), were not observed during disasters (34).

It is noteworthy that studied interventions included hardly any 
designated suicide prevention interventions specifically designed for 
disasters or public health emergencies (33). Nevertheless, findings 
provided some indication of potential suicide prevention co-benefits 
of  generic  universal  interventions,  such  as  gun  laws,  economic 
security measures, and green spaces. While broader disaster mental 
health  intervention  frameworks  and  guidelines  exist  (46),  these 
currently provide little guidance on suicide prevention. In the absence 
of an evidence base for designated interventions in such contexts, it 
therefore remains reasonable to assume that generic evidence-based 
suicide prevention interventions that have been effective under other 
circumstances (24, 25) should also have the best chance of unfolding 
those impacts during disasters and public health emergencies. Yet, 
the reasons for why their impacts and effectiveness may be hampered 
in  these  contexts  are  manifold,  including  the  destructive  and 
disruptive nature of disasters and pandemics that can simultaneously 
affect  and  overwhelm  many  realms  of  society,  and  which  may 
necessitate nimble adaptations in suicide prevention programs or 
services (23). In fact, four interventions showed some evidence of 
planned reactive adaptations in these contexts (31, 33, 35, 40) that 
were either aimed at temporarily decreasing the scale and changing 
the mode of delivery to reduce virus transmission and ensure health 
and safety during pandemics (33, 40), or at increasing the overall 
scale,  access  and  reach  of  interventions  during  pandemics  and 
disasters (31, 35). Beyond adaptations to ensure the continuity, access 
and  safety  of  existing  interventions,  the  timing  of  designated 
interventions also deserves consideration within a broader public 
health approach, as systematic reviews indicate the need for a long-
term perspective in view of commonly delayed suicidality increases 
(12) and protracted secondary stressors in such contexts (47). The 
integration  of  designated  provisions  to  recognize  and  address 
heightened suicide risks in disaster mental health frameworks (46,

48) and pandemic response plans (49) is key to advancing future 
preparedness and responses.

Several intervention studies with favorable outcomes addressed 
known risk and protective factors for suicide of relevance to disasters 
(10) and public health emergencies (11) through mechanisms aimed at 
enhancing economic security, health care access, means restriction, 
psychosocial support, and green space access of affected populations. 
Research  on  the  effectiveness  of  ongoing  existing  or  adapted 
interventions as well as the development of event-specific interventions 
specifically targeting relevant risk and protective factors of suicide in 
these contexts therefore provide promising avenues to advance the field.
Research is essential to strengthen the evidence base on effective 
interventions (26) and inform evidence-based responses (27), but can 
also  be  challenging  to  conduct  (50,  51)  and  itself  be  disrupted  by 
disasters and pandemics, as was evident in one instance (37). While 
conducting robust gold standard RCTs may not always be feasible in 
these  circumstances,  well-controlled  cohort  studies  and  time  series 
analyses provide feasible research methods that afford a level of rigor. 
When researching the impacts of ongoing interventions, findings can 
also  be  harder  to  interpret,  as  the  onset  of  a  disaster  essentially 
constitutes  a  new  secondary  exposure  or  intervention,  which 
complicates  the  interpretation  of  primary  intervention  effects.  It  is 
therefore essential that studies clearly capture the nature and level of 
disaster  exposure  among  affected  target  populations  and  settings. 
Research on adapted interventions will equally benefit from clearly 
documenting  intervention  adaptations  (52,  53)  and  from  assessing 
adaptation outcomes (54) along with overall effectiveness outcomes (55).

4.1 Study limitations

Study findings should be considered in light of certain limitations 
regarding the available evidence and review process. These include the 
limited scope of published evidence and variable quality of studies. 
Importantly, many observational study designs did not permit firm 
casual  attribution  of  intervention  effects.  Considerable  study 
heterogeneity (regarding interventions, target groups, and contexts) 
also precluded formal quantitative synthesis and meta-analysis.

The  systematic  review  process  was  based  on  a  comprehensive 
literature search and rigorous study selection strategy but limited to 
peer-reviewed literature and quantitative empirical studies published 
in English. It did not consider grey literature, qualitative studies, or 
non-English  language  publications.  It  is  further  possible  that  the 
search strategy may have missed some relevant studies (e.g., of routine 
interventions continuing throughout disasters and pandemics) if these 
did not make explicit reference to such contexts. While publication 
bias  was  not  formally  assessed,  it  is  conceivable  that  intervention 
studies that were either interrupted by such events or which produced 
negative or less favorable results in such contexts, were less likely to 
be published, and were therefore not available for this review.

5 Conclusion

interventions that have been applied in such contexts with some 
success.  There  is  a  need  for  further  research  on  effective 
interventions  and  intervention  adaptations  to  inform  evidence-
based  suicide  prevention  responses  to  disasters  and  public 
health emergencies.
