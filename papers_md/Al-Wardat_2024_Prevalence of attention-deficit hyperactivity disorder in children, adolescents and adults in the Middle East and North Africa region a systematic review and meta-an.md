ABSTRACT
Objectives  To systematically estimate the overall 
prevalence of attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) in children, adolescents and adults across the 
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
Design  Systematic review and meta- analysis conducted 
according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta- analyses (PRISMA) statement.
Data sources  Medline and Scopus databases were 
comprehensively and systematically searched between 
1990 and February 2023.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies  We included 
all cross- sectional or cohort studies that diagnosed 
ADHD using validated diagnostic tools (eg, Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition 
criteria, ADHD rating scales and ADHD diagnostic 
interview) or non- validated tools (eg, brain imaging 
techniques, computerised cognitive tests and quantitative 
electroencephalography).
Data extraction and synthesis  Two reviewers performed 
the data extraction independently using standardised data 
collection sheet. Newcastle- Ottawa Scale was used to 
assess the quality of the included studies. Individualised 
and pooled event rate and upper and lower limit at 95% CI 
were calculated according to the ADHD cases and the total 
sample size using a random- effect model. The subgroup 
prevalence analyses according to ADHD subtypes, gender, 
MENA country and age were also performed.
Results  A total of 63 articles met the inclusion criteria 
involving 849 902 participants. The overall prevalence of 
ADHD was 10.3% (95% CI 0.081 to 0.129). The prevalence 
rate ranged from 1.3% (Yemen) to 22.2% (Iran). Subgroup 
analyses showed that the prevalence in adults was 13.5 
and 10.1 in children and adolescents. Males exhibited 
significantly higher prevalence compared with females as 
these were 11.1% and 7%, respectively. Attention- deficit 
subtype was significantly the most prevalent (46.7%) 
compared with hyperactivity/impulsivity (33.7%) and 
combined types (20.6%).
Conclusion  The overall prevalence of ADHD was high in 
the MENA region. It is crucial to allocate more attention 
and resources towards the prevention and treatment of 
ADHD in children, adolescents and adults within the region.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ This review includes a large number of studies con-
ducted within different countries in the MENA region, 
enhancing the representation of MENA populations, 
cultures  and  contexts  which  might  enhance  the 
generalisation of the results.

 ⇒ These  study  methods  obviously  highlight  the  need 
for  future  research  improvements,  including  com-
prehensive  gender- specific  assessments,  focused 
studies on ADHD in adults and categorisation of age 
variations for adolescents.

 ⇒ This study acknowledges and emphasises the high 
heterogeneity  among  the  included  studies.  This 
demonstrates a commitment to transparently inter-
pret  findings  while  encouraging  more  consistency 
in  methodology  and  diagnostic  criteria  in  future 
research.

 ⇒ The study’s inability to identify gender differences in 
ADHD subtypes could have limited the understand-
ing of how presentation may vary between genders.
 ⇒ Pooled prevalence data for adolescents without ac-
counting  for  potential  age- related  variations  might 
have oversimplified the analysis of ADHD prevalence 
across different age groups.

INTRODUCTION
disorder 
Attention- deficit 
(ADHD)  is  a  neurodevelopmental  disorder 
in  childhood  and  adolescence.  ADHD  is 
characterised by three primary traits: inatten-
tion,  hyperactivity  and  impulsivity.  Indeed, 
ADHD  is  widely  recognised  as  one  of  the 
leading  reasons  for  children  being  referred 
to  mental  health  clinics  and  rehabilitation 
services.1  2  Children  diagnosed  with  ADHD 
often  face  challenges  in  maintaining  focus, 
demonstrating self- control, managing impul-
sive  behaviours  and/or  displaying  an  excess 
of physical activity.2 3 The presence of hyper-
activity,  which  is  a  prominent  symptom  of

ADHD, might contribute to psychological and social diffi-
culties for a child within their home, school and commu-
nity,  leading  to  a  sense  of  incompatibility.1–3  According 
to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders,  Fifth  Edition  (DSM- 5),  the  core  feature  of  ADHD 
is  a  collection  of  behaviours  that  could  disrupt  social 
functioning.1–3  Instances  of  these  behaviours  include 
increased  motor  activity  in  inappropriate  situations, 
excessive fidgeting, engaging in fingerplay and excessive 
talkativeness.3 These social challenges might significantly 
impact  daily  life  functional  abilities  including  personal 
and educational aspects of individual life.1 4–8

trouble 

following 

ADHD  can  be  classified  into  three  primary  subtypes: 
attention  deficit,  hyperactive- impulsive  and  combined 
types.5  The  attention- deficit  subtype  is  characterised  by 
difficulties  sustaining  attention,  being  easily  distracted 
and  struggling  with  organisation  and  task  completion.5 
Adolescents  and  adults  with  this  subtype  may  appear 
forgetful,  have 
instructions  and 
exhibit a tendency to daydream or become lost in their 
thoughts.4  5  9  The  hyperactive- impulsive  subtype,  on  the 
other hand, is usually marked by high levels of activity, rest-
lessness and difficulty remaining still or quiet.5 10 Adoles-
cents and adults with this subtype often exhibit impulsive 
behaviours  such  as  speaking  out  of  turn,  interrupting 
others and engaging in improper or impulsive decision- 
making.10 Finally, the combined type, the most common 
ADHD  subtype,  usually  involves  a  combination  of  both 
attention- deficit  and  hyperactive- impulsive  symptoms.10 
Individuals  with  the  combined  type  might  experience 
difficulties  with  attention,  hyperactivity  and  impulsivity 
across  various  settings,  leading  to  functional  challenges 
in academic, social and/or personal domains.5 10

Previous studies have assessed the prevalence of ADHD 
across  various  countries,  specific  regions  and  globally. 
These  studies  have  incorporated  child,  adolescent  and 
adult populations. It is important to mention that ADHD 
global prevalence ranged between 5.9% and 12.4%. More 
recently,  a  global  estimation  of  ADHD  and  its  related 
subtypes  revealed  an  overall  prevalence  of  7.6%  in  chil-
dren and adolescents.11 Specifically, the prevalence of the 
attention  subtype  was  33.2%,  the  hyperactive- impulsive 
subtype  was  30.3%  and  combined  ADHD  was  observed 
at  31.4%.11  Additionally,  a  previous  systematic  review 
reported  that  the  global  prevalence  of  persistent  adult 
ADHD from childhood was 2.58%, and the prevalence of 
symptomatic  adult  ADHD  was  6.76%.12  Furthermore,  a 
recent umbrella review found that the global prevalence 
of ADHD in adults was estimated at 3.10%.13 In a recent 
systematic  review,  Aljadani  et  al  reported  that  the  preva-
lence  of  ADHD  among  Saudis  was  12.4%.14  Addition-
ally,  three  previous  studies  estimated  the  prevalence  of 
ADHD in Arab Gulf countries, Arab countries and Africa 
between 5.9% and 10.5%.9 14 15 Despite these accumulated 
evidence and variations in ADHD estimated prevalence, 
it is well known that its prevalence might be influenced 
by various factors such as gender, culture, environment, 
socioeconomic  status  and  demographics.16  17  Extensive 

2

prior  research  has  consistently  documented  marked 
gender  differences  in  the  prevalence  of  ADHD  and  its 
various subtypes.12 18–21 Notably, males exhibited a partic-
ularly higher probability of receiving clinical diagnoses of 
ADHD compared with females, with male- to- female prev-
alence ratios varying within the range of 2:1 to 10:1 across 
studies.22–24

The prevalence of ADHD differs significantly between 
childhood/adolescence and adulthood, as evidenced by 
global  estimates  and  insights  from  previous  systematic 
reviews  and  meta- analyses.12  21  25  Diverse  cultural  and 
methodological  factors  could  have  contributed  to  the 
wide  range  of  prevalence  rates  identified  in  the  litera-
ture targeted childhood and adolescence populations.26 
Prevalence variation between genders further highlights 
the complexity of understanding ADHD.20 22 Assessment, 
diagnostic tools and data sources, including self- reported 
information  and  medical  records,  have  also  introduced 
more  prevalence  variability.27  In  adulthood,  global  esti-
mates of ADHD are generally lower than younger popula-
tion, ranging from 2.5% to 2.58%, with ongoing debates 
on the manifestation of symptoms and potential underdi-
agnosis in females.12 The transition to adulthood brings its 
own set of challenges, including diverse assessment meth-
odologies and persisting gender differences, highlighting 
the  need  for  more  appropriate  analyses  adopting  stan-
dardised  diagnostic  criteria  for  a  better  comprehensive 
understanding of ADHD prevalence across lifespan.12 28 29
To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that esti-
mated the overall prevalence of ADHD in the Middle East 
and North Africa (MENA) region. The MENA region is 
characterised by its consistent and unique cultural, social 
and  environmental  factors,  which  suggests  a  different 
prevalence  of  ADHD  and  its  characteristics  compared 
with  other  world  regions.  Most  of  the  MENA  countries 
are at medium to high population growth and fertility.30 
MENA population is primarily young, with over half of the 
population  under  the  age  of  25  years.30  Understanding 
the  estimated  prevalence  of  ADHD  and  its  characteris-
tics in the MENA region could be crucial for identifying 
the  scope  of  this  disorder  and  informing  appropriate 
interventions  and  healthcare  planning.  Therefore,  the 
primary  purpose  of  the  present  systematic  review  and 
meta- analysis  was  to  estimate  the  overall  prevalence  of 
ADHD in children, adolescents and adults, as well as to 
examine  gender  differences  in  ADHD  prevalence  and 
explore  the  distribution  of  different  ADHD  subtypes 
within the MENA population.

METHODS
Search strategies
This  study  was  performed  according  to  the  Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- analyses 
(PRISMA)  statement.31  A  comprehensive  electronic 
search was conducted to identify articles in two databases 
(PubMed  and  Scopus).  We  used  the  World  Bank’s  defi-
nition to encompass the MENA region, which comprises 

Al- Wardat M, et al. BMJ Open 2024;14:e078849. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2023-07884920  countries  with  an  estimated  population  of  approxi-
mately  355 million.  The  MENA  region  includes  Algeria, 
Bahrain,  Djibouti,  Egypt,  Iran,  Iraq,  Israel,  Jordan, 
Kuwait,  Lebanon,  Libya,  Morocco,  Oman,  Qatar,  Saudi 
Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Palestinian 
territories  and  Yemen.32  The  following  keywords  were 
used  to  search  the  literature:  attention- deficit  hyperac-
tivity disorder, ADHD, prevalence, epidemiology, Middle 
East, North Africa, MENA and each of the names of the 
MENA  countries  (Algeria,  Bahrain,  Egypt,  Iran,  Iraq, 
Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, 
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates 
and  Yemen).  A  full  list  of  search  terms  and  strategies  is 
presented in online supplemental table S1. The manual 
search  was  conducted  also  by  two  authors  (MA- W  and 
ME) to collect any potential paper that was not imported 
through the search term in all the databases.

Eligibility criteria
We  included  studies  that  met  the  following  criteria:  (1) 
cross- sectional or cohort studies published between 1990 
and February 2023, (2) diagnosed ADHD using validated 
diagnostic tools (eg, DSM- 5 criteria, ADHD rating scales 
and  ADHD  diagnostic  interview)  or  non- validated  tools 
(eg,  brain  imaging  techniques,  computerised  cogni-
tive 
tests  and  quantitative  electroencephalography; 
we  included  studies  that  did  not  report  the  diagnostic 
criteria), (3) provided the prevalence of overall ADHD or 
its  subtypes,  (4)  comprised  independent  samples  with  a 
relatively large sample sizes (n>100) and (5) published in 
peer- reviewed journals in English. The exclusion criteria 
were  as  follows:  (1)  studies  with  duplicate  or  overlap-
ping  data,  (2)  studies  without  full  text  and  (3)  reviews, 
case reports, editorials, letters to editors and conference 
abstracts. In cases where multiple studies used the same 
population, the study with the highest number of partici-
pants was selected.

Data extraction and quality assessment
Two  authors  performed  the  data  extraction 
inde-
pendently,  using  standardised  data  collection  sheet  to 
obtain  the  following  information:  (1)  characteristics  of 
the study (the name of the last author, publication year, 
year of data collection, country and type of the study), (2) 
diagnostic tools (reported screening for ADHD in adult-
hood/adolescence, self- reported screening for ADHD or 
clinical  interview),  (3)  diagnostic  criteria  used  for  diag-
nosis  (DSM- III,  DSM- IV  and  DSM- 5),  (4)  characteristics 
of the participants (sample size, age range and gender) 
and  (5)  overall  prevalence  of  ADHD  according  to  both 
genders and the prevalence of ADHD subtypes.

Quality assessment
Two  authors  (MA- W  and  ME)  independently  rated  the 
quality  of  each  study  using  the  Newcastle- Ottawa  Scale 
(NOS),  a  commonly  used  tool  for  evaluating  observa-
tional studies with a score range of 0–9.33 The NOS scale 
assessed  the  sample  selection  (maximum  of  four  points 

Open access

for  cohort  studies  and  three  points  for  cross- sectional 
studies),  comparability  of  sample  groups  (maximum  of 
two points) and outcome (maximum of three points for 
cohort studies and one point for cross- sectional studies).33 
A  higher  score  indicates  a  better  research  quality.  In 
cases of disagreements or uncertainty, a third researcher 
(KAA)  was  consulted  for  discussion  and  resolution.  If 
both  authors  had  any  disagreements,  the  third  author 
calculated the average of the quality assessment.

Statistical analyses
Meta- analysis was performed using comprehensive meta- 
analysis  software  V.4.  Individualised  and  pooled  event 
rate and upper and lower limit at 95% CI were calculated 
by taking the ratio of the ADHD cases to the total sample 
size.  The  random- effect  model  was  adopted  due  to  the 
variation  of  sampling  methods  and  sample  sizes  in  the 
included studies. The analysis of ADHD subtypes was also 
performed.  Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  for  the 
prevalence  according  to  gender  (male  versus  female), 
MENA country and age (children versus adults). Hetero-
geneity in effect size was examined by calculating the I2 
index.34

Patient and public involvement
Due  to  its  design,  patients  and/or  the  public  were  not 
involved  in  the  design,  or  conduct,  or  reporting,  or 
dissemination plans of this research.

RESULTS
Study selection
The  database  search  resulted  in  a  total  of  1206  articles. 
After eliminating duplicate entries, 761 titles and abstracts 
were reviewed. Out of these, 166 studies were considered 
relevant  and  assessed  in  full  text.  A  total  of  97  studies 
were excluded for different reasons: two studies had over-
lapped  samples;  35  studies  recruited  samples  that  were 
composed entirely of individuals with ADHD; 24 articles 
had no appropriate study design including case studies, 
letters to editors and conference abstracts; 18 studies had 
no adequate data (did not report overall and/or subtype 
prevalence  of  ADHD);  18  articles  were  not  in  English 
language (figure 1). Finally, 63 articles involving 849 902 
participants were included in the meta- analysis (as shown 
in  PRISMA,  figure  1).35–97  The  studies  and  participant 
characteristics are reported in online supplemental table 
S2.

This meta- analysis pooled 63 original articles, including 
a  total  of  849 902  participants  (88.89%  children  and 
adolescents  (age  range  3–18  years)  and  11.11%  adults 
(age range 17–70) years).35–97 Two studies were published 
before  2000  period,  whereas  20.63%  of  studies  (13 
studies)  were  published  between  2000  and  2010,  and 
76.20% of studies (48 studies) were published after 2010. 
The  analysis  included  data  from  15  countries:  Iran  (19 
studies,  30.15%),  Egypt  (8  studies,  12.69%),  Jordan 
(2  studies,  3.17%),  Saudi  Arabia  (10  studies,  15.87%),

self- reported screenings of childhood ADHD, and 20.4% 
(n=29) used self- reported screenings of adolescent/adult 
ADHD.  43  studies  adopted  validated  diagnostic  criteria, 
with the following breakdown: DSM- 5 (3 studies), DSM- 
III (1 study), DSM- III- R (3 studies), DSM- IV (33 studies), 
DSM- IV and International Classification of Diseases 10th 
Revision (ICD- 10) (2 studies), DSM- IV- TR (1 study) and 
DSM- V  (1  study).  However,  20  studies  did  not  report 
the  diagnostic  criteria  used.  Overall,  the  quality  of  the 
included  studies  was  high  according  to  NOS98  (online 
supplemental table S3). It is important to mention that all 
included studies scored 5 or higher on the NOS, except 
for  one  study,97  which  scored  4  according  to  the  NOS. 
Despite the lower score, we decided to include this study 
in  our  review  and  analysis  due  to  its  significance  as  the 
sole available study from Algeria.

Pooled prevalence
Overall prevalence of ADHD
The overall prevalence of ADHD in children, adolescents 
and  adults  (63  studies  and  a  sample  of  850 250  individ-
uals) was calculated at 10.3% (95% CI 8.1 to 12.9), with 
high  heterogeneity  (I2=99.85)  (online  supplemental 
table S4).

Proportion of ADHD subtypes among those with ADHD
19 studies suggested that the overall prevalence of ADHD 
subtypes  (including  attention  deficit,  hyperactivity/
impulsivity and combined types) among children, adoles-
cents  and  adults  with  ADHD,  from  a  sample  of  461 596 
individuals,  was  34.7%  (95%  CI  34.2  to  35.1)  (online 
supplemental  table  S5).  Notably,  these  findings  demon-
strated  considerable  heterogeneity  across  the  studies 
(I2=97.97). Of all individuals with ADHD, the estimated 
proportions of the ADHD subtypes were 46.7% (95% CI 
45.8  to  47.5)  for  attention  deficit,  33.7%  (95%  CI  33.7 
to 32.9) for hyperactivity/impulsivity and 20.6% (95% CI 
19.9 to 21.3) for the combined types. The heterogeneity 
across  the  included  studies  was  high  (I2=94.80)  (online 
supplemental table S5).

Overall prevalence of ADHD by MENA country
19  studies  have  shown  that  the  overall  prevalence  of 
ADHD  in  Iran  was  22.2%  (95%  CI  21.9  to  22.5).  The 
pooled estimated prevalence in Tunisia was 14.3% (95% 
CI  12.2  to  16.7).  The  pooled  estimated  prevalence  was 
equal in Egypt (12%; 95% CI 11.1 to 12.9), Iraq (12.9%; 
95% CI 11.6 to 14.3), Israel (12.6%; 95% CI 12.5 to 12.8), 
Jordan (12.1%; 95% CI 11.1 to 13.2) and Palestine (12%; 
95% CI 9.7 to 14.6). The estimated prevalence of ADHD 
in Lebanon was 6.7% (95% CI 5.4 to 8.2), and in Oman, it 
was 8.8% (95% CI 7.6 to 10.2). The prevalence of ADHD 
was also similar in Qatar (9.2%; 95% CI 8.6 to 9.8) and the 
United Arab Emirates (9.2%; 95% CI 8.4 to 10.1). Addi-
tionally,  the  pooled  prevalence  in  Algeria  was  3%  (95% 
CI 1.0 to 8.9), Saudi Arabia was 3.2% (95% CI 3.1 to 3.2), 
Yemen was 1.3% (95% CI 0.8 to 2.1), and in Sudan, it was 

Open access

9.4% (95% CI 7.7 to 11.4). The heterogeneity across all 
studies was high and ranged between I2=0 and I2=99.755.

Overall prevalence of ADHD by age and gender
The pooled prevalence of ADHD in adults (included four 
studies) was 13.5% (95% CI 8 to 20), with high heteroge-
neity across studies (I2=94.98). The pooled prevalence of 
ADHD in children and adolescents (included 59 studies) 
was  10.1%  (95%  CI  7  to  12),  with  high  heterogeneity 
across studies (I2=99.86) (online supplemental table S5).
Related  to  gender,  31  studies  showed  that  the  overall 
prevalence of ADHD in females was 7% (95% CI 3.9 to 
14.4), while in males, it was 11.1% (95% CI 6.9 to 17.4), 
with high heterogeneity across studies (I2=99.77) (online 
supplemental table S5).

The  subgroup  pooled  analysis  based  on  gender  sepa-
rately within children and adolescents based on 29 studies 
showed that the prevalence of ADHD in females was 7.6% 
(95% CI 3.9 to 14.2), while in males, it was 17.3% (95% 
CI  8.6  to  31.9).  In  addition,  the  subgroup  pooled  anal-
ysis based on gender separately for adults based on four 
studies showed that the prevalence of ADHD in females 
was 8.6% (95% CI 2.5 to 25.6), while in males, it was 12.3% 
(95% CI 5.9 to 23.9) (online supplemental table S5).

DISCUSSION
The  main  aim  of  these  systematic  reviews  and  meta- 
analyses  was  to  estimate  the  prevalence  of  ADHD  in 
children,  adolescents  and  adults  in  the  MENA  region. 
Overall, 10.3% of children, adolescents and adults were 
found to have ADHD in the MENA region. Particularly, 
the overall prevalence of ADHD in children and adoles-
cents  was  10.1%  and  in  adults  was  13.5%.  We  noticed  a 
significant  variation  in  the  prevalence  of  ADHD  among 
different  countries,  with  rates  ranging  from  1.3%  in 
Yemen to 22.2% in Iran. The variability in ADHD preva-
lence across different MENA countries may be attributed 
to  several  factors.  These  might  include  methodolog-
ical  discrepancies,  variations  in  the  age  of  the  children 
studied,  perinatal  complications,  differences  in  assess-
ment  tools  for  measuring  ADHD,  gender  distribution 
among  participants,  cultural  influences,  socioeconomic 
status  of  families  and  the  presence  of  other  concurrent 
mental and neurological disorders.99 100 It is not surprising 
to observe such variations given the complex interplay of 
these potential contributing factors.

The overall prevalence of ADHD in the current meta- 
analysis  (10.3%)  aligns  closely  with  previous  studies 
conducted in Arab and African populations,9 14 15 100 which 
reported a range of ADHD prevalence between 1.3% and 
16%.  However,  these  previous  studies  did  not  pool  the 
data from Iran or Israel and did not include a large sample 
size  like  in  this  current  study.  In  this  review,  there  were 
22  studies  conducted  in  Iran  and  Israel.  It  is  important 
to  note  that  Israel  and  Iran  exhibit  notable  differences 
in terms of culture and various related factors compared 
with Arabic MENA countries. Based on the latest findings

from  a  study  conducted  in  2023  to  estimate  the  global 
prevalence  of  ADHD,  the  prevalence  of  ADHD  among 
children aged 3–12 years was 7.6%, while among adoles-
cents aged 12–18 years, it was found to be 5.6%.11 These 
figures  indicate  a  slightly  lower  worldwide  prevalence 
compared  with  our  own  findings  in  the  MENA  region. 
In this current study, the estimated prevalence of ADHD 
in  adults  stands  out  as  notably  higher  than  the  globally 
pooled  estimates  for  this  respective  age  group.  Indeed, 
the global estimates for adults with ADHD typically range 
from  2.5%  to  2.58%.12  19  101  Even  when  considering  less 
conservative  estimates,  such  as  symptomatic  adult  with 
ADHD at 6.76%,12 the prevalence rates identified in the 
current review were significantly elevated compared with 
the world estimates.

Indeed,  there  are  several  potential  reasons  for  these 
discrepancies in the estimated prevalence in the MENA 
region. We observed that two of the included studies from 
Iran reported a relatively higher prevalence of ADHD.35 41 
Notably,  both  studies  were  community  based;  however, 
there  were  distinctions  in  their  sampling  methods.  In 
the case of Salmanian et al, the study sample comprised 
1000 participants randomly selected from all provinces of 
Iran.35 This method of selective enrolment, which aimed 
for a geographically diverse representation, might explain 
the relatively higher prevalence of 32.9% observed in this 
study.  Conversely,  Ghanizadeh  et  al  estimated  the  preva-
lence of ADHD to be around 32.34%.41 It is essential to 
note that this study’s sample was recruited from the child 
and  adolescent  psychiatric  clinic  in  the  Fars  region  of 
Iran. The authors reported that the clinic received refer-
rals from various geographical regions, including urban, 
suburban and rural communities surrounding the medical 
centre  in  Fars,  as  well  as  some  neighbouring  provinces. 
Importantly, this clinic’s sample was unselected, implying 
that the children were referred for a general psychiatric 
evaluation  rather  than  for  an  evaluation  of  any  specific 
disorder.  Therefore,  both  studies  may  have  contributed 
to the overall increase in the prevalence of ADHD in the 
MENA region, as indicated by our pooled analyses.

Furthermore,  the  majority  of  the  population  is  young 
in  the  MENA  region  which  could  have  increased  the 
odds  of  having  more  ADHD  cases.30  The  variability  in 
ADHD diagnostic criteria included in our study empha-
sises  the  importance  of  relying  on  standardised  diag-
nostic criteria, such as the DSM or the ICD.1 23 Moreover, 
diagnosing  ADHD  is  characteristically  challenging,  as 
specialists  may  tend  to  either  overdiagnose  or  underdi-
agnose  the  condition.27  29  However,  different  regions 
and  healthcare  settings  might  apply  these  criteria  with 
varying levels of accuracy and consistency. For example, 
we noted that studies with higher prevalence rates tend to 
cover a broader age range, such as 5–18 years, compared 
with  those  with  a  more  limited  age  scope.  Specifically, 
seven studies within the dataset investigated ADHD prev-
alence  across  a  wider  age  spectrum,  ranging  from  5  to 
18 years. Interestingly, the reported prevalence for these 
studies  was  extremely  high,  ranging  between  32%  and 

6

40%.35  45  57  58  60  62  71  82  Furthermore,  we  observed  that 
studies using different versions of the DSM show varying 
prevalence  rates.  The  included  studies  using  DSM- IV, 
DSM- IV- TR,  DSM- III,  and  DSM- 5  exhibit  different  prev-
alence rates. Different diagnostic criteria may have been 
applied to different age groups, potentially contributing 
to  the  variations  reported  in  ADHD  prevalence  in  our 
study. Thus, we speculated that the choice of DSM version 
may impact ADHD diagnostic criteria and, subsequently, 
its prevalence rates.

The cultural beliefs and attitudes towards mental health 
and  ADHD  could  also  have  impacted  the  identification 
and reporting of ADHD cases in the MENA region. Addi-
tionally, cultural norms and expectations might influence 
the  perception  of  ADHD  symptoms,  possibly  leading  to 
different prevalence rates.102 The MENA region consists 
of  multiple  countries  with  diverse  cultural,  social  and 
economic  contexts.102  103  Prevalence  rates  might  vary 
significantly  between  different  countries  within  the 
region due to regional- specific factors.102 103

The  findings  from  this  analysis  provide  significant 
insights into ADHD prevalence among children, adoles-
cents and adults, shedding light on gender- based differ-
ences. In adults, the overall prevalence was estimated at 
13.5%  across  four  studies,  notably  higher  than  previous 
estimates  of  2.5%–6.9%.101  104  105  Gender- specific 
subgroup analysis within the adult population from these 
studies indicated rates of 8.6% in females and 12.3% in 
males.  These  findings  reveal  substantial  variations  from 
previously  reported  rates.12  18  19  Moving  to  the  younger 
demographic,  among  59  studies,  the  combined  ADHD 
prevalence for children and adolescents was estimated at 
10.1%.  Within  this  group,  the  analysis  based  on  gender 
from 29 studies highlighted rates of 7.6% in females and 
notably higher rates of 17.3% in males. Particularly, the 
prevalence of ADHD in children and adolescents in the 
MENA  region  appeared  to  be  significantly  higher  than 
in other parts of the world, as evidenced by a 2018 study 
estimating  prevalence  between  2%  and  7%.23  However, 
our  findings  align  well  with  the  previous  study  that 
reported  global  prevalence  rates  of  11.4%  among  chil-
dren  aged  6–12  years  and  8%  among  12–18- year- olds.23 
These rates are consistent with our observed prevalence 
rates,  although  variations  could  be  attributed  to  the 
use of different diagnostic criteria from the DSM in the 
included  studies.  This  study  also  emphasised  significant 
gender- based differences in ADHD prevalence, especially 
higher  in  males  than  females,  consistent  with  previous 
findings in Africa.9 However, it is crucial to note the high 
heterogeneity  across  our  studies,  suggesting  potential 
variations  in  sample  characteristics  and  methodologies. 
This  heterogeneity  emphasises  the  complex  nature  of 
ADHD and highlights the necessity for further research 
in the MENA region to comprehend the factors contrib-
uting to gender- based prevalence differences.

The  results  of  this  study  indicated  that  among  chil-
dren,  adolescents  and  adults  with  ADHD,  the  preva-
lence of all ADHD subtypes (including attention deficit, 

Al- Wardat M, et al. BMJ Open 2024;14:e078849. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2023-078849hyperactivity/impulsivity and combined types) was 34.7% 
of  all  individuals  with  ADHD  in  the  MENA  region.  In 
accordance  with  prior  meta- analytic  studies,  our  meta- 
analysis confirms that the predominantly attention- deficit 
subtype prevalence (46.7% out of the total ADHD prev-
alence)  remains  the  highest  of  all  ADHD  subtypes.9  99 
Certainly, the continual prevalence of the attention- deficit 
subtype within the spectrum of ADHD may have contrib-
uted significantly to the increased frequency of its occur-
rence.106 This suggests that the sustained presence of this 
subtype  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  the  overall  higher  preva-
lence of ADHD. However, previous studies indicate that 
the  attention- deficit  symptoms  of  ADHD  display  a  rela-
tively  stable  pattern  over  time,106  107  whereas  the  other 
subtypes  of  ADHD,  such  as  hyperactive- impulsive  symp-
toms,  are  more  susceptible  to  developmental  changes 
and tend to decrease over time (although the sensation 
of restlessness may persist).99 106 107 Within our study, the 
hyperactivity/impulsivity  type  of  ADHD  emerged  as  the 
second most prevalent subtype, with the combined type 
following closely behind. Indeed, these results are in line 
with the previous meta- analysis conducted in Africa.9 The 
variation in findings could be attributed to methodolog-
ical differences among the studies included in this meta- 
analysis,  as  well  as  the  presence  of  diverse  cultural  and 
demographical  factors  influencing  ADHD  in  children 
and adolescents.

Indeed, the results of this meta- analysis provide insights 
into the prevalence of ADHD across several countries in 
the  MENA  region.  The  findings  reveal  significant  vari-
ability in ADHD estimated prevalence rates, highlighting 
the importance of considering regional differences. The 
highest  prevalence  was  observed  in  Iran,  with  approxi-
mately  30.1%  of  the  adolescents  and  adults  affected  by 
ADHD.  Tunisia  had  the  second  highest  prevalence  at 
14.3%,  followed  by  Iraq,  Israel,  Jordan  and  Palestine, 
all with estimates ranging from 12% to 12.9%. Lebanon 
and  Oman  had  relatively  lower  prevalence  rates,  with 
estimates of 6.7% and 8.8%, respectively. Qatar and the 
United  Arab  Emirates  shared  similar  prevalence  rates 
of 9.2%. Algeria and Saudi Arabia had lower prevalence 
rates,  both  around  3%,  while  Yemen  had  a  prevalence 
rate  of  1.3%.  Sudan  had  a  higher  prevalence  rate  of 
9.4%. It is important to note that there was considerable 
heterogeneity across all the studies, indicating potential 
variations  in  methodology,  sample  characteristics  and 
other  factors  influencing  the  reported  prevalence  rates. 
Among the MENA countries included in this study, it is 
important to note that there was no study from Bahrain, 
Djibouti, Kuwait, Morocco, Libya or Syria estimating the 
prevalence of ADHD. These findings emphasise the need 
for further comprehensive research in the MENA region 
to explore the underlying factors contributing to the vari-
ability  in  ADHD  prevalence  across  all  MENA  countries 
and  to  develop  tailored  interventions  and  support  for 
individuals with ADHD.

Limitations and recommendations
This  study  has  several  limitations  to  be  considered 
in  future  research.  First,  the  study  lacks  the  ability  to 
identify  gender  differences  in  ADHD  subtype  preva-
lence  within  the  MENA  region.  Future  research  should 
conduct  more  comprehensive  assessments  considering 
gender  variations.  Second,  the  estimated  prevalence  of 
ADHD in adults relied on four studies only, highlighting 
the need for more focused research on ADHD in adults 
in the MENA region. Third, the pooled prevalence data 
for  children  and  adolescents  (aged  3–18  years)  do  not 
account for potential age variations within this range due 
to unclear categorisation in the included studies. Future 
studies should address this by providing a detailed anal-
ysis  of  ADHD  prevalence  across  different  age  groups 
within  the  adolescent  population  in  the  MENA  region. 
Fourth,  the  predominantly  cross- sectional  design  of  the 
included  studies  hinders  the  establishment  of  causality, 
emphasising the need for longitudinal studies to explore 
risk  factors,  protective  factors  and  the  trajectory  of 
ADHD  over  time  in  the  MENA  region.  Fifth,  20  studies 
in the analysis did not report specific diagnostic criteria 
for  identifying  ADHD,  highlighting  the  importance  of 
clearer  reporting  in  future  research.  Finally,  the  high 
heterogeneity  among  the  included  studies  emphasises 
the  need  for  caution  in  generalising  across  the  MENA 
region.  Future  research  should  strive  for  consistency  in 
methodology and diagnostic criteria to improve compa-
rability  and  reduce  heterogeneity  in  ADHD  prevalence 
studies.  Additionally,  a  comprehensive  large- scale  study 
across  multiple  MENA  countries  is  recommended.  The 
limited  inclusion  of  assessments  from  both  parents  and 
teachers constrains the depth of exploration into ADHD 
prevalence  in  children  and  adolescents.  Inconsistencies 
in  reporting  practices,  such  as  reliance  on  self- reports, 
further  complicated  ADHD  prevalence  interpretation 
in  this  study.  Future  research  is  encouraged  to  adopt 
comprehensive reporting, including both self- reports and 
informant reports. While this systematic review aimed to 
comprehensively identify evidence on ADHD prevalence 
in  the  MENA  region,  its  limitation  to  English  language 
studies  suggests  a  need  for  future  research  to  include 
studies  published  in  languages  commonly  used  in  the 
region  (Arabic,  Hebrew,  Persian  and  French).  Despite 
these limitations, the included studies demonstrated high 
quality  according  to  the  NOS.  At  any  rate,  this  study  is 
valid and added significant contributions as the first and 
the  most  comprehensive  attempt  to  characterise  ADHD 
in the MENA region.

Conclusion
Overall, the prevalence of ADHD (10.3%) was high in both 
children  and  adolescents  (10.1%)  and  adults  (13.5%), 
being  significantly  higher  among  males  compared  with 
females.  The  predominantly  attention  deficit  (46.7% 
of  total  prevalence)  was  the  most  prevalant  subtype  of 
ADHD followed by hyperactivity/impulsivity type (33.7% 
of  total  prevalence)  and  combined  type  (20.6%  of  total

prevalence). The prevalence rates of ADHD varied across 
different countries in the MENA region, emphasising the 
need  for  further  research  and  targeted  interventions  to 
address  the  high  prevalence  of  ADHD  in  children  and 
adolescents.  Finally,  it  is  crucial  to  allocate  more  atten-
tion and resources towards the prevention and treatment 
of  ADHD  in  adolescents  and  adults  within  the  MENA 
region.  Future  studies  are  recommended  to  conduct 
more  comprehensive  cross- sectional  investigations  that 
include  data  from  multiple  countries  within  the  MENA 
region. These future studies should employ standardised 
assessments  for  diagnosing  ADHD,  ensuring  consistent 
and  accurate  identification  of  individuals  with  ADHD. 
Furthermore,  it  is  advisable  to  conduct  interventional 
studies exploring the efficacy of various ADHD treatment 
approaches efficacy.
