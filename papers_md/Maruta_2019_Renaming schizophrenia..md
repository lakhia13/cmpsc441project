Abstract

The movement towards renaming of schizophrenia in Japan started in 1993 upon receipt of a
letter by The National Federation of Families with Mentally Ill in Japan addressed to the board
of Japanese Society of Psychiatry of Neurology (JSPN), requesting to rename schizophrenia as
the then-official term for the condition, Seishin-Bunretsu-Byo, or ‘mind-splitting disease’, was
humiliating. A committee was established within JSPN to address the issue, public comments
were collected, a new name ‘Togo-Shitcho-Sho’ (‘disintegration disorder’) was approved in
2002, and in 2005, the new name was adopted in the Revised Mental Health and Welfare
Act. This paper describes the process of renaming, and also the current situation in Korea,
Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Malaysia, where Chinese characters are used. Also, it presents
alternative names for schizophrenia that have been suggested in the process of two research
projects conducted by the authors and also additional candidates suggested by others.

Introduction

The prevalence of schizophrenia is estimated to be approximately 1% and around the world 24
million people are said to suffer from the illness. The condition initially coined as Dementia
Praecox by Kraepelin was renamed as Schizoprenie, or schizophrenia, by Bleurer, and the term
has been used for over a century now. However, this term schizophrenia has been revisited
recently for a possibility of renaming.

The renaming movement in Japan
In Japan, as a corresponding translation for schizophrenia, Seishin-Bunretsu-Byo (‘mind-
splitting disease’) was approved in 1937 by a committee for psychiatric terminology within
Japanese Society for Psychiatry and Neurology (JSPN), and it has been used since then.
However, The National Federation of Families with Mentally Ill in Japan (NFFMIJ) wrote a
letter in 1993 to the President of JSPN, requesting to rename the condition on the ground
that ‘the term Seishin-Bunretsu-Byo is humiliating’. In response to this letter, JSPN started
to organise a subcommittee and a special committee designated move forward with renaming
(Table 1) (Sato, 2006, 2008).

This committee established criteria to use when considering the new name: the new name
should (1) not result any social disadvantage to patients, (2) reflect the concept of schizophre-
nia, (3) not intend to stand for a disease entity but syndrome, (4) be easy to understand and (5)
be distinguished from other disorders. This committee met frequently, and they narrowed
down the possibilities to three candidates: Togo-Shitcho-Sho (‘disintegration disorder’),
Sukizofurenia (‘schizophrenia’ spelled out according to the Japanese writing system) and
Bleurer’s disease. JSPN members were asked to comment on those three candidates, and at
the JSPN General Assembly, Togo-Shitcho-Sho received the final approval. The new term
was publicly introduced at
the XIIth International Congress of World Psychiatric
Association, and a month later, the Japanese government officially endorsed this as well.

However, it took 3 more years to have the Japanese Mental Health and Welfare Law reflect
the change. To change the disorder name already used in the laws, it was necessary to dem-
onstrate how much awareness the proposed term has gained and the effects that the new term
is expected to have on various departments of the Japanese government. To provide evidence,
two research projects were conducted by the Health Labour Sciences Research Grants in Japan
(Sato, 2004; Ono, 2004).

It has come to be widely known that Japan re-named schizophrenia, but less known is the
fact that schizophrenia was re-conceptualised. Sato (Sato, 2008) reports that, along with the
renaming from ‘mind-split disease’ to ‘disintegration disorder’, the following changes were
made:

(cid:129) Schizophrenia is a syndrome, not a disease (i.e., discontinuation from the conceptualisation

of dementia praecox).

(cid:129) It is delineated by specific clinical symptoms, rather than vulnerability of brain.
(cid:129) The illness and personality are assessed in separate dimensions, rather than in combination.

The NFFMIJ demanded to rename the disease.

The JSPN formed a subcommittee for renaming.

Activities of the subcommittee included reviews; surveys of patients, members, and councillors of the Society; symposia; workshops; and
panel discussions.

The JSPN formed a special committee for renaming the disease. Its activities included survey of the NFFMIJ members, public comment
collection from the general public, and public hearings.

The board of directors of the JSPN approved renaming to ‘Togo-Shichou-Syo’.

The board of trustees and general members of the JSPN approved the new name.
The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) notified the nation of the new disease name.
A research project supported by a Health and Labor Sciences Research Grant from the MHLW investigated the status and effects of permeation.

2005

The new disease name was officially announced through the Revised Mental Health and Welfare Act enforced in the following year.

(cid:129) Its aetiology is dysregulation of neurotransmitter system and
heterogeneity in heredity is observed, rather than simply
‘unknown’.

(cid:129) The overall severity of the condition is milder than before.
(cid:129) Its course and outcomes is ‘recovery in more than a half’ instead

(cid:129) Informed consent and psychoeducation for the patients are

of ‘progressive and poor’.

‘easy’, not ‘difficult’.

(cid:129) Recommended treatment is now a combination of medication

and psychosocial therapy, rather than medication alone.

The situation in Asian, Europe countries and the USA

Movement of renaming is observed in other Asian countries
where Chinese characters are also in use. The Korean term for
schizophrenia had been ‘Jeongshin-bunyeol-byung’ (‘mind-split
disorder’), which was changed in 2012 to ‘Johyun-byung’ (‘attune-
ment disorder’) by Korea Psychiatric Association (Lee and Kwon,
2011; Lee et al., 2013). Behind this change was discrimination
against the affected patients and caregivers and also mental health
professionals due to the old term. In addition, the old term was
often confused with dissociative identity disorder. Commenting
on the new term, Lee et al. (2013) report that ‘Johyeon literally
means “to tune a stringed musical instrument”. In the context
of schizophrenia, attunement is a metaphor for tuning the strings
of the mind.’

In Taiwan, Taiwanese Society of Psychiatry decided to rename
the term from ‘Jing Shen Fen Lie Zheng’ (‘mind-split disease’) to
‘Si Jue Shi Tiao Zheng’ (‘dysfunction of thought and perception’).

Hong Kong seems to be entertaining the possibility of renam-
ing; neither China nor Singapore seems to (Sartorius et al., 2014).
There are researchers proposing to consider renaming schizo-
phrenia in Europe and America as well, which seems to suggest
an increasing interest in renaming. This may be partially motivated
by publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) by the American Psychiatric
Association and upcoming publication of
the International
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 11th
Revision (ICD-11) by the World Health Organization. Of note,
the ICD-11 is expected to be approved at the World Health
Assembly in May 2019, but schizophrenia is not planned to be
renamed.

In the Netherland, an organisation called Anoiksis (a com-
pletely consumer-run association of people who have chronic
psychoses or schizophrenia) is actively promoting renaming of
schizophrenia. Information regarding how users are approaching
renaming is scant, but it is noteworthy how similar the movement
in the Netherland is to the process in which renaming of schizo-
phrenia in Japan started with NFFMIJ, the organisation run by
users (George and Klijn, 2013a, 2013b).

Alternative names for schizophrenia that have been
suggested in the process of two research projects
conducted by the authors and also additional
candidates suggested by others

The authors have conducted two surveys regarding renaming of
schizophrenia (Maruta and Iimori, 2008; Maruta et al., 2014;

posed candidate terms suggested by others are summarised in
Table 2.

Conclusion

The movement of renaming schizophrenia originally started in
Japan and other Asian countries has attracted international inter-
est. Schizophrenia is among key disorders of all mental disorders,
which may explain the high interest.

Some people are for renaming and others are against it. The
significance of renaming is to reduce the stigma associated with
the term schizophrenia and ultimately contribute to removing
in mental health care. Within Chinese
obstacles that exist
character-using countries including Japan,
it is quite possible
that the initial translation (i.e., a translation that stands for ‘mind-
split disease’) was inappropriate to begin with. Back then when
that term was proposed, the concept of informed consent did
not exist, and the viewpoint of how the disorder name might
affect the patients, families and society was lacking while the
translation was done, and scientific knowledge regarding the
pathology was extremely limited. Today the situation is different.
While the aetiology of schizophrenia is yet to be discovered, the
environment surrounding schizophrenia has changed to a large
extent.

When choosing a new term, it is important to involve the
patients and families who suffer the consequences of the illness
in addition to the mental health professionals, inviting them to
state their opinions. They also agree that, in addition to the new
term, new conceptualisation of the illness must follow, according
to our research. In order to reduce stigma, education about the
illness to the public seems critical.

It may take time, but it seems important to promote psychi-
atric care that encourages interest in renaming, aims to reduce

stigma against schizophrenia and ultimately facilitates hope for
the patients and families.
