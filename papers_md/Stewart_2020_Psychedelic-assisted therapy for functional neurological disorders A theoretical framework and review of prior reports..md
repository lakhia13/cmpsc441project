Abstract

Functional	 neurological	 disorders	 (FNDs),	 which	 are	 sometimes	 also	 referred	 to	 as	

psychogenic  neurological  disorders  or  conversion  disorder,  are  common  disabling 

neuropsychiatric	 disorders	 with	 limited	 treatment	 options.	 FNDs	 can	 present	 with	

sensory  and/or  motor  symptoms,  and,  though  they  may  mimic  other  neurological 

conditions,  they  are  thought  to  occur  via  mechanisms  other  than  those  related  to 

identifiable  structural  neuropathology  and,  in  many  cases,  appear  to  be  triggered 

and	sustained	by	recognizable	psychological	factors.	There	is	intriguing	preliminary	

evidence to support the use of psychedelic-assisted therapy in a growing number of 

psychiatric	illnesses,	including	FNDs.	We	review	the	theoretical	arguments	for	and	

against	exploring	psychedelic-assisted	therapy	as	a	treatment	for	FNDs.	We	also	pro-

vide an in-depth discussion of prior published cases detailing the use of psychedelics 

for	 psychosomatic	 conditions,	 analyzing	 therapeutic	 outcomes	 from	 a	 contempo-

rary neuroscientific vantage as informed by several recent neuroimaging studies on 

psychedelics	and	FNDs.

Human experiences with psychedelics long predate knowledge 

of their molecular nature. Among the earliest archeologically docu-

mented consumers of psychedelic agents were aboriginal communi-
ties of northeastern Mexico and Trans-Pecos Texas.26 Radiocarbon 

dating  demonstrates 

that 

these  communities  used  peyote, 

Lophophora  williamsii,  the  mescal  bean  Sophora  secundiflora,  and 

the  Mexican  buckeye  Ungnadia  speciosa  as  far  back  as  circa  8500 
BCE.27  Alongside  plants,  fungi  are  also  natural  sources  of  psyche-

delic chemicals, psilocybin-containing mushrooms being among the 

best-known examples. Such mushrooms are of major significance to 
indigenous traditions associated with Mesoamerica.28

The  unifying  pharmacological  property  of  the  classical  psyche-
delics	appears	to	be	agonism	of	serotonin	2A	(5-HT2A)	receptors.29 

Elucidation of this mechanism began with the discovery of serotonin 
in	the	mammalian	brain	in	the	1950s30 and recognition of the struc-

tural  similarity  between  serotonin  and  lysergic  acid  diethylamide 
(LSD).31 While the exact interaction between psychedelics and the 

serotonergic  system  was  unclear  for  some  time,  the  development 

of  subtype-specific  serotonin  antagonists  narrowed  focus  on  the 

with  life-threatening  cancer.  In  the  two  larger  studies,  continued 
benefit was seen in 60%-80% of patients at 6 months48-50; a recent 

follow-up to one of those studies found effects to be sustained at 
4.5 years.51 Promising preliminary results have also been observed 
with  psilocybin-assisted  psychotherapy  in  alcoholism,52  smoking 
cessation,53  obsessive  compulsive  disorder,54and  treatment-refrac-
tory major depression.55,56 There is interest in psychedelic-assisted 

therapy as a potential treatment for a number of other disorders in-
cluding  anorexia  nervosa,57  bipolar  disorder,58  chronic  pain,59  and 
cocaine addiction.60

Some  feel  the  introduction  of  psychedelic-assisted  psycho-

therapy  marks  the  beginning  of  a  new  era  in  the  field  of  psychia-

try.  However,  it  remains  a  topic  of  debate  whether  the  subjective 

changes in consciousness induced by psychedelics can be dissociated 

from  the  underlying  biological  changes  with  regard  to  their  thera-

peutic efficacy. Whereas the therapeutic effects of traditional psy-

chopharmaceuticals are considered to be a direct result of changes 

in  neurotransmitter  levels  and  downstream  signaling  pathways  in 
the context of continued dosing,61 psychedelics may be capable of 

5-HT2A  receptor,  the  blockade  of  which  was  found  to  inhibit  be-

producing  benefits  that  long  outlast  their  direct  pharmacological 

havioral effects of various psychedelics in rats and, in later studies, 

to block the effects of psilocybin and LSD on subjective perceptual 
experience in humans.3,32-35

A key step in inaugurating the study of psychedelic compounds 

in  academic  research  was  the  synthesis  of  LSD  by  Swiss  chemist 

Albert	Hofmann	in	1938.	Though	initially	labeled	as	being	of	no	par-

ticular	interest	by	the	pharmacology	division	at	Sandoz	Laboratories,	

Hoffman	 resynthesized	 LSD	 in	 1943,	 inoculating	 himself	 with	 the	

molecule in the process by accident. This experience, along with a 

purposeful ingestion a few days later, revealed the mind-altering ef-

fects of LSD and provided the first hints that it may be of relevance 
to the study and treatment of psychiatric disease.36

amplitudes as measured by magnetoencephalography were similarly 
impacted by cuing.129 While the Bayesian explanation of functional 

sensory  symptoms  may  be  more  intuitive,  this  model  can  be  used 

to explain functional motor symptoms as well. The argument made 
by  Edwards  and  colleagues11  is  that  the  primary  deficit  underlying 

weakness of three limbs which resolved with LSD-assisted psycho-

functional  motor  symptoms  is  one  of  the  abnormal  proprioceptive 

therapy. In the discussion of his report, Baker comments, “It is im-

beliefs which are then fulfilled by a motor response or, in the case 

possible to state how much was drama and suggestion vs how much 

of functional weakness, a lack of motor response. In the proposed

ranging  from  common  optical  illusions,  to  biases  in  worldview,  to 

various  psychiatric  disease  states  such  as  depression  and  obses-
sive-compulsive disorder.77 The basic premise is similar to the model 
for	 FNDs11:  heavily  weighted  prior  expectations  lead  to  top-down 

suppression  of  bottom-up  influences  resulting  in  cognitive  distor-
tions that are not easily overcome by conflicting input.67,75

While	not	a	functional	neurological	disorder	per	se,	in	a	1963	article,	

Thomas  Ling  and  John  Buckman  describe  the  case  of  a  47  year  old 

Scottish  woman  with  frequent  and  severe  urinary  urgency  which  was 

limiting her daily activities. Her symptoms had onset suddenly 11 years 

prior when she found herself alone in a railway car with a young man. 

While he did not threaten her in any way, she found herself in a state of 

panic which was accompanied by a strong urge to urinate. This urge to 

urinate,  which  the  patient  refers  to  by  the  euphemism  “penny  spend-

ing,” became a frequent occurrence which persisted over the subsequent 

years,	 as	 did	 a	 worsened	 generalized	 anxiety—this	 despite	 counseling

In  each  of  three  sessions,  she  was  given  50-75  mcg  of  LSD  with 

20-30	mg	of	methylphenidate.	Over	the	course	these	sessions,	both	her	

urinary and anxiety symptoms significantly lessened, with continued im-

provement in the months that followed. The patient wrote the following 

in a progress report 4 months after completing treatment:

My urge to ‘spend pennies’ has gone and I can now go 

out quite freely. It is a wonderful feeling of release. I 

still get thoughts about my old penny business, but I 

can laugh at it. The episode in the railway carriage is 

clear to me, and the understanding has made me feel 

so  different  about  sex.  The  urge  to  ‘spend  a  penny’ 

was a substitute for my sexual feelings, which I always 

felt	were	wrong,	and	they	were	tied	up	together.	For	

the first time in my life, I can let myself go in sex, and 
our marriage is much happier 99.
