Abstract

Objectives—Elucidating the biological mechanisms involved in Attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) has been challenging. Relatively unexplored is the fact that these mechanisms 
can differ with age.

Methods—We present an overview on the major differences between children and adults with 
ADHD, describing several studies from genomics to metabolomics performed in ADHD children 
and in adults. A systematic search (up until February, 2016) was conducted.

Results—From a PRISMA flow-chart, a total of eligibility 350 studies from genomics and 
metabolomics were found for cADHD and 91 for aADHD. For children, associations were found 
for genes belonging to dopaminergic (SLC6A3, DRD4, MAOA) and neurodevelopmental 
(LPHN3, DIRAS2) systems and OPRM1 (Yates Corrected p=0.016; OR=2.27 95%CI:1.15–4.47). 
Studies of adults have implicated circadian rhythms genes, HTR2A, MAOB and a more generic 
neurodevelopmental/neurite outgrowth network (BCHE, SNAP25, BAIAP2, NOS1/NO, KCNIP4, 
SPOCK3; Yates Corrected p=0.007; OR= 3.30 95%CI:1.33–8.29). In common among cADHD 
and aADHD, the most significant findings are for oxidative stress proteins (MAD, SOD, PON1,

adiponectin.

Conclusions—Through a convergent functional genomics, this review contributes to clarify 
which genetic/biological mechanisms differ with age. The effects of some genes do not change 
throughout lifetime, whereas others are linked to age specific stages. Additional research and 
further studies are needed to generate firmer conclusions that might someday be useful for 
predicting the remission and persistence of the disorder. Although the limitations, some of these 
genes/proteins could be potential useful biomarkers to discriminate cADHD versus aADHD.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common syndrome characterized by 
excessive inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity (Faraone et al. 2015). Although it had 
long been considered a disorder of childhood, 65% of affected children continue manifesting 
symptoms into adulthood (Faraone, Biederman, Mick 2006).

The ADHD prevalence was estimated 5.3% in childhood (Polanczyk et al. 2007; Polanczyk 
et al. 2014; Willcutt 2012) and 2.5–4.9% in adulthood (Ramos-Quiroga et al. 2014a; Simon 
et al. 2009). Although many clinical features are similar in ADHD children and adults, 
adults have less symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity and more inattentive symptoms 
(Volkow and Swanson 2013). Furthermore some structural brain findings differentiate 
ADHD in children and adults (Shaw et al. 2013). These data suggest potential differential 
etiological pathways for children and adults.

Data about the heritability of ADHD in children and adults had been inconsistent, with some 
suggestion that heritability is higher in children (75–90%) (Faraone and Mick 2010) 
compared with adults (30%–50%) (Boomsma et al. 2010; Kan et al. 2013; Larsson et al. 
2013) and other studies supporting greater heritability in adults (Biederman et al. 1995; 
Biederman et al. 1996; Faraone, Biederman, Monuteaux 2000; Faraone et al. 2000). A more 
recent review suggests that the heritability of ADHD in adults and in childhood is better 
explained by rater effects (Brikell, Kuja-Halkola, Larsson 2015).

From the linkage and candidate gene (CGA) to genome-wide association (GWA) studies, the 
ADHD community has made real breakthroughs. 40% of ADHD’s heritability is due to a 
polygenic liability consisting of many common variants (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms 
SNPs) (Lee et al. 2013) along with rare deletions and insertions (Copy Number Variants 
CNVs) (Williams et al. 2012; Martin et al. 2015).

The identification of biomarkers may facilitate the differential diagnosis of ADHD. The 
results of a recent meta-analysis of childhood ADHD studies identified some potential 
peripheral biomarkers linked to monoaminergic pathways and to the HPA axis (Scassellati et 
al. 2012).

To date, relatively unexplored is the fact that the biological mechanisms involved in ADHD 
can differ with age. By using a convergent functional genomics, Here we present an 
overview on the major significant differences between child ADHD (cADHD) and adult 
ADHD (aADHD), describing several studies from genomics (linkage and CGA, SNPs/
CNVs-GWA, expression studies) to metabolomics carried out in cADHD and in aADHD. 
We sought to delineate which genes and proteins are common and distinct to these two age 
groups of ADHD persons.

This review presents the results structured in two main paragraphs: -Genomics subdivided in 
a) linkage studies, b) in candidate gene association studies where each specific pathway was 
evidenced, c) in genome-wide association studies according to SNPs and CNVs, d) 
expression studies in peripheral systems and -Metabolomics where biochemical studies in 
peripheral tissues were described. Each of them performed in ADHD children and adults.

Detailed information on literature search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria and statistical 
analyses are reported in supplementary material.

As indicated in the PRISMA flow-chart, a total of eligibility was 350 studies from genomics 
and metabolomics for cADHD and 91 for aADHD (Figure 1). Table 1 and Figure 2 
reassumed the results obtained from genomic and metabolomic studies. Summary of 
positive/negative findings and statistical results for common and specific pathways in 
cADHD and aADHD are in Tables S1 and S2 respectively.

Linkage studies in ADHD children and adults—Since 2002, there have been 14 
linkage studies performed for cADHD, including 11 GW-linkage analyses (Li et al. 2014). 
However, few loci were implicated and the only regions showing a meta-analytic 
significance were 16q23.3 (Zhou et al. 2008) (CDH13, T-cadherin 3) and 5p13 (Ogdie et al. 
2006) (SLC6A3, dopamine transporter). One study reported associations to three SNPs in 
LPHN3 (latrophin-3) locus, the 4q13.1 (Li et al. 2014). Moreover 9q22 (DIRAS2, GTP-
binding RAS-like 2) and 9q33 (ASTN2, astrotactin 2) were associated to cADHD (Li et al. 
2014).

In adults, two studies were conducted on pure aADHD, one of them pointed to 16q23.3 as a 
disease gene harboring region (Lesch et al. 2008).

Candidate gene association studies in cADHD and aADHD

Dopaminergic system—SLC6A3. A frequently studied variant is a 40bp variable 
number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism located in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-
UTR). Gizer et al.’s meta-analysis reported an association between the 10R allele and 
cADHD (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009). Another VNTR in intron 8 widely investigated is 
the 30-bp repeat sequence. The 6R allele was associated with cADHD by meta-analysis

(Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009). Some studies indicated associations of the haplotypes formed 
by the 10R allele of the 3′UTR and the 3R allele of the intron 8 or the 10-6 with increased 
risk for ADHD (Gao et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014). Other single polymorphisms have been 
investigated: rs6347 (exon 8) and rs40184 (intron 13) were not associated, whereas rs27072 
(3′UTR) was associated to cADHD (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009).

The association of the 9-6 haplotype and the 9-9 genotype with aADHD was confirmed by a 
meta-analysis of 1,440 cases and 1,769 controls, and in single successive studies on 9R risk 
allele (Franke et al. 2012). A new allele 9.5R was detected and found associated to aADHD 
(Hasler et al. 2015). Moreover de Azeredo et al. (2014) reported that rs2652511 in the 
promoter region was a risk factor for aADHD. Notwithstanding these positive results, others 
supported negative findings (Table S1).

Dopamine receptor DRD4. Most association studies examined a highly polymorphic VNTR 
in the third exon, which presents 2 to 11 copies of a 48-bp repeat sequence. The 7R allele 
has been consistently associated with cADHD (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009; Smith 2010; 
Wu et al. 2012). Recently, rare variants and non-synonymous mutations in the VNTR region 
of the 7R allele have been identified in ADHD subjects (Grady et al. 2003), suggesting 
presence of allelic heterogeneity. Meta-analyses of other polymorphisms in/del (Gizer, 
Ficks, Waldman 2009; Wu et al. 2012) and rs747302 (Wu et al. 2012) showed negative 
results. Contrasting results were obtained by two meta-analyses for the rs1800955 (Gizer, 
Ficks, Waldman 2009; Wu et al. 2012). A small number of association studies focused on 
other SNPs in the promoter region of DRD4, such as −615A/G and −376C/T showed 
negative results (Wu et al. 2012). Different haplotypes showed prevalently associations with 
cADHD (Gao et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014).

Contrasting results were obtained for the association of the VNTR and aADHD (Franke et 
al. 2012). A large meta-analysis in 1608 aADHD patients and 2358 controls was negative for 
this polymorphism as well as for the promoter 120-bp insertion/deletion, however evidence 
for association of a haplotype formed by the 4R allele and the long (L) allele was observed 
(Sanchez-Mora et al. 2011). A different distribution of the 6R allele was found in aADHD 
(Hasler et al. 2015). Negative results were also obtained (Table S1).

Dopamine receptor DRD5. A highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat (CA)n, located in 18.5 
kb at the end of the 5′ flanking region, has been the most studied DNA variant. The 148-bp 
allele was associated with ADHD according to meta-analyses (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009; 
Wu et al. 2012). However, considering other studies, no associations were found in cADHD 
but also in aADHD (Table S1).

Dopamine receptor DRD3. Two meta-analyses (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009; Wu et al. 
2012) of the functional polymorphism in exon 1 Ser9Gly (rs6280) were negative. Additional 
studies on other polymorphisms/haplotypes showed exclusively negative findings (Table 
S1).

Similar conclusions were obtained in aADHD (Franke et al. 2012; Table 1S).

Dopamine receptor DRD2. The results from the first meta-analysis (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 
2009) were negative for TaqIA restriction site (rs1800497) polymorphism. Successive meta-
analyses showed positive results (Wu et al. 2012; Pan et al. 2015). Further evidences 
consisted in negative studies for other polymorphisms/haplotypes (Table S1).

Similar conclusions were obtained in aADHD (Franke et al. 2012; Table S1).

Dopamine Receptor DRD1. A single and multiple marker analysis in 322 cADHD, 533 
controls and in 196 nuclear ADHD families provided evidence for the contribution of DRD1 
to cADHD (Ribases et al. 2012). This association was confirmed in a replication sample. A 
meta-analysis on rs4532 showed no association (Wu et al. 2012). Studies on other 
polymorphisms/haplotypes reported additional associations with this gene (Table S1).

In 211 aADHD and 533 controls, DRD1 was not found associated to aADHD (Ribases et al. 
2012).

Serotoninergic system—Serotonin transporter SLC6A4. Results of a meta-analysis 
(Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009) indicated an association between ADHD and the functional 
5HTTLPR 44-bp insertion/deletion “long” allele. In addition to the 5HTTLPR, a 17-bp 
repeat in intron 2 (STin2) and a SNP in the 3′ UTR (rs3813034) of SLC6A4 have been 
studied in relation to cADHD with no associations (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009). 
Additional studies on other polymorphisms/haplotypes reported positive results (Table S1).

In adults, a meta-analysis of 5HTTLPR did not support a major role (Landaas et al. 2010). 
Subsequent studies were negative (Franke et al. 2012; Table S1).

Serotonin receptors. The HTR1B’s meta-analysis of the G861C (rs6296) indicated an 
association with G allele (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009). However the gene as whole resulted 
not associated to cADHD (Table S1). Concerning the Serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A), a 
meta-analysis (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009) indicated no association for three 
polymorphisms (rs6314, rs6313, rs6311). More recently other SNPs and haplotypes were 
associated to cADHD (Table S1).

In adults, positive and negative results were found for HTR2A and HTR1B genes 
respectively (Franke et al. 2012; Table S1).

Other serotonin receptor genes HTR1A, HTR1D, HTR1E, HTR1F, HTR2B, HTR2C, 
HTR3A, HTR3B, HTR4, HTR5A, HTR6, HTR7 showed prevalently negative results in 
cADHD and aADHD.

Noradrenergic system—Norepinephrine Transporter SLC6A2. A frequently studied 
SNP (rs5569 or G1287A) located in exon 9 was not associated with cADHD in a meta-
analysis (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009). No association was also observed between cADHD 
and rs2242447 (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009). More recently associations were reported 
with specific haplotypes also in relation to sex and subtypes (Table S1).

Alpha-2A-adrenergic receptor, ADRA2A. Two meta-analyses confirmed no association with 
ADHD and the A-1291 C to G variant creating an MspI site in the promoter region (Gizer, 
Ficks, Waldman 2009; Shiffrin et al. 2013). Similarly rs553668 and rs1800545 were not 
associated with cADHD (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009). Associations were observed with 
some haplotypes (Table S1). ADRA2C. For this gene a lacking of association was found 
(Hawi et al. 2013). Further studies confirmed this finding (Table S1).

There has been no evidence of association for these three genes with aADHD ( Table S1).

Metabolic enzymes—Catechol-O-methyltransferase, COMT. Meta-analyses indicated no 
association between ADHD and the most popular marker Val156Met (Gizer, Ficks, 
Waldman 2009; Sun et al. 2014; Lee and Song 2015). Further studies on other 
polymorphisms/haplotypes indicated prevalently negative results.

Dopamine beta-hydroxylase, DBH. Many studies focused on a TaqI restriction 
polymorphism (rs2519152) and the results from meta-analysis showed no association 
between the A2 allele and cADHD (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009). Meta-analyses of 
rs1611115 and rs1108580 did not detect associations (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009). Further 
studies on other SNPs/haplotypes found positive and negative findings (Table S1).

In aADHD, contrasting results with a tendency toward negative results were obtained for 
COMT and positive for DBH (Franke et al. 2012; Table S1).

Monoamine oxidase, MAO. Negative results were obtained according to meta-analysis 
(Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009) but considering more recent studies, the data were prevalently 
positive for MAOA gene (Table S1). Fewer studies were conducted for MAOB, but they did 
not support its involvement in cADHD (Table S1).

Instead, in 188 aADHD patients and 400 controls, MAOB was associated with aADHD 
(Ribases et al. 2009a).

Tryptophan hydroxylase, TPH. For TPH1, a meta-analysis of the silent A to C substitution in 
intron 7 (rs1800532) indicated no association to cADHD (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009). For 
TPH2, no meta-analytic associations were found for rs1843809 and rs1386493. Further 
studies for both genes showed prevalently negative results (Table S1).

In adults, a recent meta-analysis of 1,636 cases and 1,923 controls reported no associations 
for rs17794760 in TPH1 and for rs7305115, rs7963717, rs4760818, rs1386496, rs4760820 
in TPH2 (Franke et al. 2012; Table S1).

Dopamine decarboxylase, DDC. More papers reported associations of this gene with 
cADHD (Table S1).

In 188 patients and 400 controls, Ribases et al. 2009a found a strong association with 
aADHD.

Tyrosine hydroxylase, TH. Ribases et al. 2012 reported an association of rs2070762 with 
cADHD. In contrast, other studies showed negative findings (Table S1).

In aADHD, the same authors showed no association.

Butyrylcholinesterase, BCHE. A study showed an association with aADHD (Jacob et al. 
2013).

Synaptosomal vesicles system—Synaptosome Associated Protein 25kDa, SNAP-25. 
rs3746544 was found associated to cADHD according to meta-analysis (Gizer, Ficks, 
Waldman 2009). Meta-analyses of rs362987 (intron 4), rs363006 (intron 6) and rs1051312 
(3′UTR) were negative (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009). In addition associations were 
identified between other polymorphisms or different combinations of haplotypes and 
cADHD. In Asian population, an association was found between 1065G>T and cADHD 
(Gao et al. 2014) (Table S1).

Herken et al. 2014 detected a significant association of the MnlI polymorphism with 
aADHD and with symptom severity in the Turkish population. This result was not confirmed 
in Olgiati et al. 2014. Other studies showed contrasting results (Table S1).

Other SNARE genes. Guan et al. (2009) assessed SYP (Synaptophysin), STX1A (Syntaxin 
1A), SYT1 (Synaptotagmin 1) and VAMP2 (Vesicle-associated membrane protein 2) and 
found that SYP was associated with cADHD in a Chinese population. Liu et al. (2013a) 
replicated this result in a larger sample of Han Chinese subjects. Other studies showed 
prevalently negative findings. The gene CPLX2 (complexin 2) was investigated in Sanchez-
Mora et al. (2013a) with a significant association (Table S1).

In adults, STX1A was associated in two studies (Sanchez-Mora et al. 2013a; Kenar et al. 
2014) and VAMP2 and SYT2 according to Kenar et al. (2014) and Sanchez-Mora et al. 
(2013a) respectively. The complex as whole showed no association with aADHD (Table S1).

Neurodevelopmental network/neurite outgrowth—Brain derived neurotrophic 
factor, BDNF. Two meta-analyses found no association of the functional Val66Met (rs6265) 
with cADHD (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 2009; Lee and Song 2015). Specific haplotypes or 
other polymorhisms were associated with cADHD (Table S1).

Three studies investigated the association with aADHD, including a meta-analysis of 1,445 
cases and 2,247 controls. The results showed just one positive finding (Franke et al. 2012; 
Table S1).

Other neurotrophins. Studies of other genes belonging to this family showed an association 
between CNTFR (ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor), NTF3 (neurotrophin 3) and NTRK2 
(neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor) in cADHD (Ribases et al. 2008). Other studies 
showed negative results for CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor), CNTFR and NTF3. Two 
negative findings were observed for NGF (Nerve Growth Factor) (Table S1).

In aADHD, one study reported an association with CNTFR but not with NTF3 (Ribases et 
al. 2008). The same study found association with NGF.

LPHN3. The first association was observed in a genetic Paisa isolate and was confirmed in a 
2,627 cases, 2,531 controls and 1,202 relatives from five different populations. Additional 
positive associations were found, even more recently (Hwang et al. 2015) (Table S1).

One case-control studies on large samples reported a significant association of several 
polymorphisms (43 SNPs) and aADHD (Ribases et al. 2011). Other studies did not support 
this finding (Arcos-Burgos et al. 2010; Sanchez-Mora et al. 2015a).

BAI1-associated protein 2, BAIAP2 and other cerebral lateralization genes. A study showed 
that BAIAP2 was associated with cADHD in Han Chinese descents (Liu et al. 2013b). These 
results were not confirmed in a Caucasian cADHD population (Ribases et al. 2009b).

In aADHD, BAIAP2 was found to be associated in two Caucasian populations (Ribases et 
al. 2009b).

DIRAS2. Reif et al. (2011) conducted an association study in 166 families with a ADHD 
child and 420 controls. The results showed an association of a promoter specific haplotype 
block.

In adults, a meta-analysis of rs7854469, rs16906711, rs1331503, rs1412005 and of the risk 
haplotype ACGCTT performed in four populations showed associations for rs1412005 and 
for the risk haplotype only in German population (Reif et al. 2011).

CDH13. An association study indicated positive findings of rs11150556 to cADHD 
(Salatino-Oliveira et al. 2015), no confirmed in Gomez-Sanchez et al. (2016).

Mavroconstanti et al. (2013) identified seven coding variants none of them showed 
associations with aADHD. Further negative results were obtained (Salatino-Oliveira et al. 
2015).

Catenin (Cadherin-Associated Protein), Alpha 2, CTNNA2. No associations were found for 
the rs1339502 and cADHD and aADHD (Salatino-Oliveira et al. 2015).

Kv Channel Interacting Protein 4, KCNIP4. Two SNPs showed association with cADHD in 
171 families, whereas six SNPs and haplotypes showed association with aADHD in 594 
patients and 974 controls from Germany (Weiflog et al. 2013).

Sparc/Osteonectin, Cwcv And Kazal-Like Domains Proteoglycan (Testican) 3, SPOCK3. 
Associations of rs7689440 and rs897511 was observed in 624 aADHD and 536 controls 
(Weber et al. 2014).

Nitric Oxide Synthase-1, NOS-1, Nitric Oxide (NO). The rs478597 was not associated to 
cADHD (Salatino-Oliveira et al. 2016).

Two variants of the NOS1 (exon 1c, 1f VNTR) were genotyped in aADHD reporting no 
association (Kittel-Schneider et al. 2015). In other studies, the exon 1f was found associated 
to aADHD (Franke et al. 2012; Table S1).

Microtubule-Associated Protein 1B, MAP1B. The rs2199161 was not associated to cADHD 
and in aADHD (Salatino-Oliveira et al. 2016).

Protein kinase G, PRKG1. In 125 nuclear families with aADHD patients, the C2276T 
(3′UTR) was not associated (De Luca et al. 2002).

Integrin, Alpha E (Antigen CD103, Human Mucosal Lymphocyte Antigen 1; Alpha 
Polypeptide), ITGAE/ITGA11. No association of this gene was found with cADHD (Laurin 
et al. 2008).

Disrupted In Schizophrenia 1, DISC1. rs11122330, rs6675281, rs11122319 were associated 
to cADHD (Kayyal et al. 2015).

In adults, one positive study was performed in Spain and Norwegian populations (Jacobsen 
et al. 2013).

Circadian rhythms—CLOCK, PER2, Melatonin, Cortisol. An over transmission of the T 
allele (rs1801260) of the CLOCK (Circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) gene was 
observed in both Taiwanese and British cADHD (Xu et al. 2010). Negative results were 
obeserved for PER2 (Period Circadian Clock 2) (Table S1).

An association of rs1801260 was found in Caucasian aADHD (Kissling et al. 2008).

Other systems—Opioid Receptor, Mu 1, OPRM1. An association was observed in 
cADHD (Drtilkova et al. 2008).

Contrasting results were obtained in aADHD (Table S1).

Zinc Finger Protein 804A, ZNF804A. Xu et al. 2013 reported no association of rs1344706 
with cADHD in UK and Taiwanese samples.

Similar results in aADHD (Landaas et al. 2011).

Glutamate Receptor, Metabotropic 7, GRM7. Contrasting results were found with cADHD 
(Table S1).

In aADHD, one negative finding was available for GRM7 (Akutagava-Martins et al. 2014a).

Genome wide Association studies (GWAs)

Common Variants: SNPs-GWAs—In cADHD, seven GWAs and one meta-analysis 
were performed (Hawi et al. 2015). In aADHD, two were conducted (Lesch et al. 2008; 
Sanchez-Mora et al. 2015b).

CDH13. SNPs at this gene ranked among the top results in two SNPs-GWAs in cADHD 
(p=10−5) (Hawi et al. 2015).

In 343 aADHD and 304 controls, the findings provide significant results (p=10−6) (Lesch et 
al. 2008).

NOS1. One study showed an association (p=10−6) in cADHD (Lasky-Su et al. 2008).

GRM5. For this gene an association (p=10−6) was observed for cADHD (Hinney et al. 
2011).

KCNIP4 (Neale et al. 2008) (p=10−5), SPOCK3 (Neale et al. 2008) (p=10−5), PRKG1 
(Neale et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2013) (p=10−7), Glypican 5/6 (GPC5/6) (Hinney et al. 2011) 
(p=10−5), ITGAE/ITGA11 (Yang et al. 2013) (p=10−5). Significant associations were 
reported.

ASTN2 (p=10−7), CTNNA2 (p=10−6), GPC5/6 (p=10−8), MAPB1 (p=10−6), ITGAE/
ITGAE11 (p=10−7) showed associations to aADHD (Lesch et al. 2008).

Rare Variants: CNVs-GWAs(Hinney et al. 2011)—To date ten CNVs-GWAs have 
been published for cADHD (Hawi et al. 2015). In aADHD, two studies were available 
(Akutagava-Martins et al. 2014b; Ramos-Quiroga et al. 2014b).

GRM5. It has been demontrated that GRM5 and GRM7 were among the genes affected by 
CNVs. The same authors detected again an overrepresentation of CNVs affecting GRM5 
and GRM1, GRM7, GRM8 in cADHD (Hawi et al. 2015; Table S1). Akutagava-Martins et 
al. 2014b did not confirm this association.

In adults, a higher CNVs frequency was detected in aADHD for GRM1,5,8 (Akutagava-
Martins et al. 2014b).

DRD5. Lionel et al. (2011) found an overlapping with DRD5 locus and cADHD probands 
which was absent in controls.

BCHE. Elia et al. (2010); Lesch et al. (2011); Lionel et al. (2011) gave evidence for a 3q26.1 
deletion and among the involved genes, BCHE showed the stronger association in cADHD.

CDH13. One study reported a deletion in one patient with cADHD, affecting part of this 
gene (Lionel et al. 2011).

CPLX2 (SNARE), ASTN2 were found associated to cADHD (Lionel et al. 2011).

CTNNA2. A deletion was reported in cADHD (Elia et al. 2010).

HTR1B, COMT, DISC1. CNVs were involved in these genes in aADHD (Ramos-Quiroga et 
al. 2014b).

Expression studies in peripheral systems in cADHD and aADHD—DRD4. 
Taurines et al. (2011) reported that the concentrations of blood DRD4-mRNA and not of 
DRD5 and TPH1 were lower in cADHD compared to controls. In another study the 
expression levels of SLC6A3, DRD4 and DRD5 were different between patients and 
controls (Xu et al. 2015).

SLC6A3, DRD5, TPH1, SNAP25. In a pilot study in aADHD, some authors demonstrated 
that combining the gene expression levels of these genes as predictors resulted in sensitivity 
and specificity of over 80% (Grunblatt et al. 2012).

Circadian rhythms (CLOCK, PER2, Melatonin, Cortisol). Alterations in circadian rhythms 
were observed in aADHD, with loss of PER2 and melatonin expression in patients (Baird et 
al. 2012).

microRNAs (miRNAs). Kandemir et al. (2014) reported, in 52 cADHD patients, that 
miRNA 18a-5p, 22-3p, 24-3p, 106b-5p and 107 levels were decreased whereas miRNA 
155a-5p were increased in patients. Sanchez-Mora et al. (2013) evaluated the contribution of 
one SNP in the miR-96 target site at HTR1B and eight tagSNPs within the region containing 
this miRNA in 695 aADHD and 485 controls from Spain. Associations were observed 
between rs2402959 and rs6965643 of miR-96.

Metabolomics

Peripheral protein levels in cADHD and aADHD—BDNF. No difference with 
controls was found in serum levels in an Italian cADHD patients (Scassellati et al. 2014) 
whereas higher plasma levels were associated in Asian population (Shim et al., 2008).

Corominas-Roso et al. (2013) found serum levels lower in aADHD compared to controls.

NGF. Guney et al. (2014) reported that the serum NGF levels of the cADHD patients were 
higher than those of the controls.

NOS1, NO. NO activity for cADHD patients was different than those of the controls (Ceylan 
et al. 2010; Ceylan et al. 2012). Contrasting results were obtained in aADHD (Table 1S).

Circadian rhythms (CLOCK, PER2, Melatonin, Cortisol). Cortisol rhythms significantly 
phase delayed in the aADHD group (Baird et al. 2012). Contrasting results were observed 
for cortisol and for melatonin (Table S1).

Reduced salivary levels of cortisol were observed also in cADHD (Scassellati et al. 2012).

Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs). More negative results were observed for the serum 
arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels in 
cADHD as compared to controls (Scassellati et al., 2012).

Similarly, in adults studies confirmed no alterations in AA, DHA, EPA (Table S1).

Oxidative stress proteins (MAD, SOD, PON1, ARES, TAS, TOS, OSI). Prevalently positive 
results were observed in ADHD adults and children for molecules belonging to the oxidative 
stress system (MAD Malondialdehyde; SOD Superoxide Dismutase; Paraoxonase PON1; 
Arylesterase ARES) and the total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS) and 
oxidative stress index (OSI) (Table S1).

Kynurenine Pathway (Tryptophan, kynurenine, Kynurenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine). 
Same positive and negative results were obtained for this pathway both in cADHD and 
aADHD (Table S1).

Adiponectin. Two positive studies were available in aADHD (Mavroconstanti, Halmoy, 
Haavik 2014) and cADHD (Ozcan et al. 2015).

Discussion

Consistently with a developmental twin study where different sources of additive genetic 
variance accounted for the expression of ADHD in childhood and adulthood (Chang et al. 
2013), our review found some divergence in findings between cADHD and aADHD, which 
suggests differential etiological pathways for different age ranges.

Through a convergent functional genomic approach and statistical analyses, the results 
(Figure 2, Table 1) indicate that SLC6A3, DRD4, MAOA, LPHN3, DIRAS2 and OPRM1 
are specific for cADHD (p=0.016; OR=2.27 95%CI:1.15–4.47, Table S2) whereas circadian 
rhythms genes, MAOB, HTR2A, BCHE, SNAP25, BAIAP2, NOS1, KCNIP4, SPOCK3 are 
specific for aADHD (p=0.007; OR=3.30 95%CI:1.33–8.29, Table S2). Moreover we 
detected some genes in common: MAD, SOD, PON1, ARES, TOS, TAS OSI, followed by 
DISC1, DBH, DDC, microRNA and adiponectin (Table S2).

Specific genes

Longitudinal designs suggest that hyperactive/impulsive ADHD symptoms decrease with 
age (Biederman, Mick, Faraone 2000; Larsson, Lichtenstein, Larsson 2006). Given that 
expression levels of genes can differ across different stages of development (Elia and Devoto 
2007; Langley et al. 2009), the contribution of some risk alleles/proteins to ADHD may not 
be constant across the life course. Such a pattern would be consistent with the developmental 
twin study of Chang et al. 2013.

Our results indicate that three dopaminergic genes, SLC6A3, DRD4 and MAOA, are 
specifically associated to cADHD. The list of ten candidate genes showing replicated 
evidence of association with cADHD (Hawi et al. 2015) includes SLC6A3 and DRD4. 
These data add further weight to the dopamine hypothesis where a dysregulation of 
dopaminergic neurotansmission is due to dopamine deficit in ADHD (Genro et al. 2010). 
Recently a hypothetical signature of genetic and biochemical markers that, someday, might 
be useful for diagnosing ADHD in childhood has been suggested (Faraone, Bonvicini, 
Scassellati 2014; Scassellati and Bonvicini 2015). This signature includes SLC6A3, DRD4 
and MAOA, which is consistent with our conclusions. In aADHD MAOB, which encodes 
the enzyme that metabolizes dopamine, was more strongly associated. This could suggest a 
differential effect of this pathway with SLC6A3, DRD4, MAOA being more implicated in 
cADHD and MAOB in aADHD.

The differential effect of these genes has some precedent in the literature. A well-known 
example are two meta-analytic findings. One associates, even though not significant after 
Bonferroni correction, the 9R allele of the 40bp SLC6A3 VNTR with aADHD (Bonvicini,

Faraone, Scassellati 2016), another associates the 10R to cADHD (Gizer, Ficks, Waldman 
2009). One hypothesis about this difference is that, because DAT1 density decreases during 
life and ADHD symptoms are known to change during adolescence, the differential 
association of DAT1 with ADHD might reflect changing requirements on the dopaminergic 
system during life, probably influenced also by the functional effect of this polymorphism, 
with the 9R allele associated to increased in vivo DAT activity (Faraone et al. 2014).

Moreover, the DRD4 7R allele is associated with cortical thickness trajectories in early 
development but this association was no longer found around 16–18 years of age (Shaw et 
al. 2007; Shaw et al. 2013).

Finally, MAOA and MAOB were associated differentially to cADHD and aADHD 
respectively (Ribases et al. 2009a), confirming our results.

Further evidence of specific associations with cADHD comes from some genes linked to 
neurodevelopmental network such as LPHN3 and DIRAS2. In particular they are involved in 
synaptic plasticity, neurite outgrowth (LPHN3), and are expressed in those structure 
involved in working memory, error detection and executive control (DIRAS2), impaired in 
ADHD. LPHN3 is in the list of ten candidate genes showing replicated evidence of 
association with cADHD (Hawi et al. 2015).

In aADHD, other systems have been associated to this adult form; in particular circadian 
rhythms genes, HTR2A, and a more generic neurodevelopmental/neurite outgrowth 
represented by BCHE, SNAP25, BAIAP2, NOS1, KCNIP4 and SPOCK3 genes. These 
specific associations could reflect a certain versatility of these genes throughout the lifespan, 
first with a less significant role on early brain development and a larger role later in the 
lifecycle.

A recent review (Coogan et al. 2016) reported several studies supporting that circadian 
timekeeping appears to be altered in ADHD. One interesting facet of such alterations is the 
relatively strong concordance between different studies indicating phase delays associated 
with exclusively aADHD as assessed by endocrine, molecular, activity, sleep, and 
psychometric parameters. Although the significance of the observed phase alterations and 
desynchronisation of rhythms observed in ADHD is not fully understood, these may provide 
novel important therapeutic targets.

BCHE, SNAP25, BAIAP2, NOS1, KCNIP4 and SPOCK3 are as whole implicated in the 
neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity and neuronal proliferation/differentiation systems that 
were already demonstrated to be involved in ADHD by the bioinformatic analyses of 
Poelmans et al. 2011 and Hawi et al. 2015. These mechanisms, which are believed to 
underpin processes relevant for ADHD such as cognitive performance, attention, learning 
and memory formation, could be linked to a potential differential effect in the developing 
(LPHN3 and DIRA2) and adult (BCHE, SNAP25, BAIAP2, NOS1, KCNIP4, SPOCK3) 
brain. BAIAP2 was meta-analitic associated to aADHD (Bonvicini, Faraone, Scassellati 
2016). The list of ten candidate genes showing replicated evidence of association with 
ADHD included SNAP25 and NOS1 (Hawi et al. 2015). SNAP25 plays an important role in 
axonal growth, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release, acting in essential steps for

wiring the nervous system. NOS1 influences cadherin systems and plays a direct role in 
neurite outgrowth. As reported in Poelmans et al. (2011) several of these proteins appear to 
be under control of the stimulants methylphenidate and amphetamine that are used to treat 
ADHD symptoms. Both stimulants have been shown to stimulate neurite outgrowth and 
directly or indirectly regulate the expression and/or funtion of several genes/proteins 
implicated in this network.

In summary, these data suggest that specific genetic and biological mechanisms can differ 
with age and suggest differential effects for dopaminergic and neurodevelopmental/neurite 
outgrowth systems in cADHD (SLC6A3, DRD4, MAOA, LPHN3, DIRAS2) and in aADHD 
(MAOB, BCHE, SNAP25, BAIAP2, NOS1, KCNIP4, SPOCK3). Fewer studies were 
performed for KCNIP4, SPOCK3, and DIRAS2 genes. Given their important roles in brain 
(Table 1), further investigations are needed.

Common genes

The involvement of the oxidative stress system as major actor followed by some dopamine 
metabolism enzymes (DBH, DDC), DISC1, microRNA and adiponectin in cADHD and in 
aADHD strengthens the hypothesis that dysregulation of oxidative stress mechanisms as 
well as of dopamine metabolism are implicated in ADHD independently of age.

Research suggests that oxidative stress predispones to a diverse range of psychiatric 
conditions, including ADHD (Joseph et al. 2015). A meta-analysis concluded that measures 
of oxidative stress were elevated among ADHD patients both children and adults (Joseph et 
al. 2015). Our results confirm the involvement of this system throught lifespan. Validating 
the oxidative stress as a component of ADHD’s pathophysiology in children and adults with 
further studies, could be mandatory mainly because antioxidants might be useful for the 
treatment of ADHD.

More findings should be carried out on DISC1, a gene implicated in neuronal migration, 
neurite outgrowth and axon targeting during brain development.

This review has several limitations/comments: -to give the same weight to the different 
findings (single study and meta-analysis), we divided each meta-analysis available for a 
certain gene or protein, into single studies. Moreover, as the SNPs-CNVs-GWAS studies 
available for a gene showed mostly negative results for children, more genes resulted in 
associations with aADHD, -some genes implicated by our review should be replicated to 
yield definite conclusions: OPRM1, adiponectin, KCNIP4, SPOCK3, microRNA, DIRAS2, 
DISC1, ZNF804A, ASTN2, GPC5/6, kynurenine pathway, CTNNA2, MAP1B, ITGAE/
ITGA11, -all genetic studies performed in childhood and/or adulthood ADHD so far are 
characterized by a lack of power and their results have not provided genome-wide 
association hit or robust candidate gene, -considering the decrease in hyperactive/impulsive 
symptoms over the life cycle, future analyses of this symptom domain with the different 
genes at different age ranges could to be useful (Bralten et al. 2013).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that with a convergent functional 
genomics approach and statistical analyses contribute to clarify which genetic/biological

mechanisms associated with ADHD differ by age. There are some genes whose effects do 
not differ throughout lifetime, whereas others are linked to age specific stages. Additional 
research and further studies are needed to generate firmer conclusions that might someday 
be useful for predicting the remission and persistence of the disorder. Although the 
limitations and the needing to confirm these results, some of these genes/proteins could be 
potential useful biomarkers to discriminate cADHD versus aADHD.
