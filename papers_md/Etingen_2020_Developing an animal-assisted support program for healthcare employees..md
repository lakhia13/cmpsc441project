Abstract

Background: Employee burnout and its associated consequences is a significant problem in the healthcare
workforce. Workplace animal therapy programs offer a potential strategy for improving employee well-being;
however, research on animal therapy programs for healthcare workers is lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the
feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact of an animal-assisted support program to improve healthcare
employee well-being.

Methods: In this mixed-methods pilot intervention study, we implemented an animal-assisted support program in
a multidisciplinary healthcare clinic at a large VA hospital. The program included 20 sessions over 3 months, each
approximately 1-h long. Real-time mood data were collected from participants immediately before and after each
session. Participation rates were tracked in real time and self-reported at follow-up. Data on burnout and employee
perceptions of the program were collected upon completion via a survey and semi-structured interviews.
Differences in mood and burnout pre/post program participation were assessed with t-tests.
Results: Participation was high; about 51% of clinic employees (n = 39) participated in any given session, averaging
participation in 9/20 sessions. Mood (on a scale of 1 = worst to 5 = best mood) significantly improved from
immediately before employees interacted with therapy dogs (M = 2.9) to immediately after (M = 4.5) (p = 0.000).
Employees reported significantly lower levels of patient-related burnout (e.g., how much exhaustion at work relates
to interaction with patients) after (M = 18.0 vs. before, M = 40.0) participating (p = 0.002). Qualitative findings
suggested that employees were highly satisfied with the program, noticed an improved clinic atmosphere, and
experienced a reduction in stress and boost in mood.
Conclusions: Establishing an animal-assisted support program for employees in a busy healthcare clinic is feasible
and acceptable. Our pilot data suggest that animal-assisted programs could be a means to boost mood and
decrease facets of burnout among healthcare employees.

Background
Burnout in the workplace is characterized by depletion
of employees’ emotional resources and reduction of their
feelings of success and achievement [1]. Within the
healthcare setting, the experience of burnout among
employees is associated with a number of negative out-
comes, including poor mental [2] and physical [3] health,
increased absenteeism [4] and turnover intention [4, 5],
diminished job satisfaction [6], and decreased healthcare
quality and safety (e.g., more frequent medical errors,
reduced empathy toward patients, diminished patient
satisfaction) [6–15].

Evidence suggests that burnout

is highly prevalent
among healthcare employees, impacting more than half
of healthcare providers and staff [4, 5, 16–21]. These
high levels of burnout may negatively impact the quality
of patient care [22, 23] and lead to increased turnover
[24], which can result in resource strain for the system
and disrupt care continuity for patients.

One strategy for improving morale in the workplace
and protecting against the potential for burnout is offer-
ing animal-assisted support programs for employees.
Evidence suggests that such programs can have signifi-
cant positive impacts on employee well-being, and have
been associated with reductions in workplace stress and
absenteeism, and improvements in employees’ mood,
health, productivity,
job satisfaction, and work quality
[25–28]. Animal-assisted support programs have been
successfully offered in select work settings (e.g., office
settings, manufacturing, sales) [25, 26]; however, there is
limited literature to-date assessing the impacts of
animal-assisted support on the well-being of healthcare
employees working in clinical settings [29]. The objec-
tives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility, accept-
ability and preliminary impacts associated with offering
an animal-assisted support program for employees of a
multidisciplinary healthcare clinic.

Methods
Data and participants
Design
We completed a mixed-methods intervention pilot study
using an explanatory sequential approach (collecting and
analyzing quantitative followed by qualitative data). The
study ran from Spring 2018 to Spring 2019; animal-
assisted program sessions were held in late Summer/
early Fall of 2018.

Participants/setting
We implemented an animal-assisted support program in
a multidisciplinary healthcare clinic housed within a
large midwestern VA hospital. We invited all providers
and staff working in that clinic (n = 39) to participate.

Study design
Intervention/implementation strategies
To conduct the program visits for employees, we part-
nered with a community-based, all volunteer animal
therapy organization that had an existing relationship
with the hospital
for hosting animal-assisted support
visits with patients. Program planning was done in con-
junction with clinic leadership and employees, and lead-
ership of the animal therapy organization. We worked
with clinic employees to determine program logistics,
including where and when sessions would be held such
that the most employees possible would have an oppor-
tunity to participate. We worked with the animal therapy
organization to determine appropriate duration for the
visits and availability of volunteers to conduct visits
during the days and times indicated as most convenient
by the clinic employees.

We held 20 program sessions over the course of 3
months. Each session was approximately 1-h long and
was held in a centrally located conference room within
the clinic on Monday/Friday and Tuesday/Thursday on
alternating weeks, in the mid-afternoon (around lunch-
time). Employees participated in the sessions as their
schedule allowed; we did not standardize how long
employees were able to interact with the dogs nor what
activities they engaged in with the dogs (both of which
were at the employee’s discretion).

We used several strategies to support program imple-
mentation. Prior to program implementation, we distrib-
uted a ‘key facts sheet’ highlighting important information
about the program and an informational letter with pro-
gram details and dates to all clinic employees. We placed
a calendar on the door of the conference room indicating
visit dates, and coordinated with the hospital’s cleaning
staff to ensure they knew the room would need attention
after each visit. When the program was initiated, we sent
reminder emails to clinic employees and the dog handlers
reminding them of sessions. During each visit, we placed
additional signage outside of the conference room and at
the front desk to remind employees that we were holding
a visit at that time.

Data collection
We collected data pre-, during, and post-program
implementation:

Pre-implementation survey
We fielded a baseline survey with clinic employees to
gather information needed to refine and finalize program
logistics and collect baseline data on employee outcomes
(personal, work-related and patient-related burnout;
interest in program participation; convenient days/times
of day for participation; demographics). The survey
along with an informational letter was distributed during

Etingen et al. BMC Health Services Research          (2020) 20:714

a clinic meeting to all staff in attendance and copies
were also distributed to all clinic employees after the
meeting to ensure those not
the
meeting had the opportunity to participate. A reminder
survey was distributed 2 weeks later to optimize partici-
pation. The survey took approximately 5–10 min to
complete.

in attendance at

Session participation tracking and pre/post session
feedback
Participation rates were tracked in real-time by the study
staff. We worked with clinic leadership to ascertain the
total number of employees per shift. Participation was
also self-reported on the post-implementation survey. In
addition, each employee was asked to fill out a visual-
analogue scale [30] indicating their current mood imme-
diately before and after each of their interactions with
the therapy dog.

Post-implementation survey
Follow-up data on employee outcomes (e.g., personal,
work-related and patient-related burnout), program par-
ticipation (e.g., whether the respondent participated,
how many sessions they participated in), and employee
perceptions of the program were collected upon pro-
gram completion using the follow-up survey and semi-
structured interviews (see below). Post-implementation
survey distribution processes mirrored those used during
the pre-implementation survey.

Semi-structured key informant interviews
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key
stakeholders (e.g., clinic employees, dog handlers) to
examine perceptions of program feasibility and accept-
ability, and overall experiences. All clinic employees and
dog handlers were invited to participate in an interview.
Interviews were typically 30 min in duration, were audio
recorded, and subsequently transcribed verbatim.

Measures
The following key outcomes were assessed:

Participation
Observed participation rates comprised the proportion
of employees who participated in each session out of the
number of employees typically on that shift during the
day of the week we held that session. The overall pro-
portion of clinic employees who participated in the pro-
gram and the average number of sessions employees
participated in were calculated based on data provided
by respondents on the post-implementation survey.

Real-time mood
Real-time mood was measured using a visual-analogue
scale created specifically for use in this study. The scale
ranged from 1 = worst mood to 5 = best mood.

Burnout
Burnout was measured using the Copenhagen Burnout
Inventory (CBI), a valid and reliable measure of em-
ployee perceptions of burnout [31]. The CBI is com-
prised of 19 questions that map onto 3 types of burnout
(personal, work-related, and client (i.e., patient)-related
burnout). Higher scores indicate greater burnout.

Satisfaction and experiences
On the post-implementation survey, we asked partici-
pants to rate the extent to which they liked the program
(1 = not at all to 5 = to a very large extent), and to tell us
about their general experiences with the program using
an open-ended, short-answer question.

Semi-structured key informant interviews
We asked employees to comment on program feasibility
(e.g., issues related to program participation and space),
acceptability (e.g., issues related to program implementa-
tion and impacts on their work experience), and general
experiences with the program (e.g., perceptions of the
dogs and dog handlers, how participation impacted their
wellness and the general atmosphere of the clinic, their
interest in participating in such a program in the future,
and suggestions for improvement). We asked the dog
handlers about feasibility issues, including perceptions of
frequency and length of sessions and space, acceptability,
including issues related to program implementation and
setting, and general perceptions of the program, includ-
ing how they thought the program was received by clinic
employees.

Analyses
Adoption rates, real-time mood, burnout, and employee
perceptions of
the program were examined using
descriptive statistics. Differences in mood and burnout
before and after interacting with the therapy dogs were
assessed using t-tests. An alpha level of 0.05 was used to
determine statistical significance.

Qualitative data from the semi-structured key inform-
ant interviews was analyzed by two qualitative experts
using an inductive and deductive data-driven coding
approach [32, 33] to identify key themes. An initial list
of codes was created based on the major topics of inter-
est covered by the interview guide; inductive codes were
developed both within the deductive codes to reflect
additional themes that arose from the data (i.e., inductive
sub-codes) and separate from the deductive codes as war-
ranted by the data. Both qualitative experts coded each

transcript independently, and subsequently convened to
discuss codes and resolve any discrepancies until full agree-
ment was reached for each code. Open-ended responses on
the post-implementation survey detailing respondent’s
perceptions of the program were analyzed similarly.

Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Ver-
sion 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York). Qualitative
analyses were conducted using NVivo Version 12 (QSR
International Pty Ltd.). This study was approved by the
appropriate VA Institutional Review Boards.

Results
We received completed pre-participation mood scales fol-
lowing approximately 91% of employee encounters with
the animal-assisted support program and post-participation
mood scales from approximately 86% of encounters.
Twenty-two completed pre-implementation surveys (56.4%
response rate) and 16 completed post-implementation
surveys (41.0% response rate) were returned. We completed
10 key informant interviews (five with clinic employees and
five with dog handlers). A total of 12 different dog handlers
conducted visits for the study.

Survey participants were predominantly female, of white
race and non-Hispanic ethnicity, and included physicians,
nurses, individuals with other clinical responsibilities, and
non-clinical support staff (Table 1). Interview participants
were predominantly female, and represented a range of
position types (e.g., physicians, nurses,
individuals with
other clinical responsibilities, non-clinical support staff).
Survey, mood scale, and adoption tracking results are pre-
sented below. Qualitative findings from the semi-structured
interviews are included where appropriate,
to offer
additional insights. Quotes are attributed to an “employee”
generally to ensure anonymity among the small sample of
participants.

Table 1 Survey participant demographics

Implementation processes
Participation
Participation in the program was high; on any given day
we held a session, about 51% (range: 33–82%) of the em-
ployees working in the clinic (n = 39) participated (Fig. 1),
and survey responses indicated that employees (n = 15)
participated in 9 of the 20 visits on average (range: 1–18).
Interviews suggested that overall, employees were
satisfied with the number of visits, when visits were held,
and how long the therapy dogs were present during the
visits. The program scheduling gave them opportunities
to participate on days/times that their clinic schedule
allowed. The length of each session provided a window
of time that the employees could visit with the dogs, if
even for a few minutes. Some employees expressed that
they wanted to participate more often and/or spend
more time with the dogs, but were sometimes unable to
because of the busyness of the clinic.

Facilitators and challenges for implementation
The key informant interviews revealed a number of factors
that influenced employee perceptions about program im-
plementation. Interviewees reported that the space used
for the visits was somewhat small, but it was the best
option for this clinic on the floor where their employees
provide patient care. Additionally, employees indicated
that the proximity of the room enhanced program accessi-
bility by allowing them to jump in to interact with the dog
amid patient care/other clinic responsibilities, which was
convenient and made it easier to participate. Interviewees
also noted that it was helpful to have the visits in the same
room each session, and that the location was optimal
given it was nearby employee workstations but easily
avoidable for patients who may be leery of dogs. One em-
ployee noted that, because the room was used for many

other purposes as well as the program, it was important to
clean thoroughly after each visit.
Employees mentioned that

seeing the program
signage in highly visible areas increased awareness of
when the dogs were visiting and facilitated participa-
tion. Additionally, employees reported that the kick-
off meeting prior to program implementation and
emails sent by the research team in advance of dog
visits helped inform them of the program and when
to expect the dogs in the clinic.

Dog handlers also offered insights about program im-
plementation, providing suggestions for how to support
the dogs and handlers. Elements of the program imple-
mented by the research team that were helpful to dog
handlers included email reminders before each session,
detailed directions to facility, and particularly, an escort
from the lobby of the hospital to the clinic conference
room, which dog handlers noted made them feel wel-
comed. Dog handlers suggested that reminders about
the time necessary to park and interact with curious pa-
tients and others in the hospital en-route to the clinic
could also be helpful.

Program outcomes
Mood (Table 2)
Participating in the program significantly improved em-
ployee’s mood in real-time (t(316) = − 17.97, p = 0.000),
with average reported mood scores improving significantly

from immediately before the employees interacted with the
therapy dog (M = 2.9) to immediately after (M = 4.5). Anec-
dotally, interviews revealed that employees experienced a
positive mood boost from spending time with the dogs,
which in turn, affected how they approached their subse-
quent clinical responsibilities, as one employee expressed:

“. . .[the PUPPY program sessions] did definitely
improve my overall mood. So if I was seeing a Vet-
eran shortly thereafter, they would, of course, be the
beneficiary of that mood.”

Burnout (Table 2)
Employees reported significantly lower levels of patient-
related burnout (e.g., how much of one’s exhaustion at
work relates to interaction with patients) after (M = 18.0)
vs. before (M = 40.0) participating in the program (t
(36)=3.33, p = 0.002). Differences in average reported
personal (pre = 52.5 vs. post = 46.9, p = 0.40) and work-
related (pre = 53.7 vs. post = 48.0, p = 0.38) burnout were
not significant, but trended in the hypothesized direc-
tion. During the interviews, employees were asked to
describe how the PUPPY program affected their overall
work experience in the clinic. Employees felt that the
program offered a therapeutic break during their work-
day, which reduced mid-day burnout. As described by
one employee:

“. . .you might have a real busy day administratively
or with patients, and obviously doing mental health
as I do sometimes can be somewhat draining, and it
gave you just that great recharge that you would
need to kind of disconnect from your workday for a
short period of time, and then that recharge that
you need to go back in and start fresh and finish
your day.”

influencing even those staff members who did not have
much interaction with the dogs. For example, one em-
ployee stated in an open-ended survey response that
they “enjoyed how much [their] colleagues enjoyed [the
dogs]. It appeared to lift the morale on this unit.” For
those who did participate, the benefits extended beyond
the workplace and for some, followed them home. One
employee expressed:

Another employee described how participating in the
program reduced their
time,
highlighting the importance of offering the program for
multiple sessions:

levels of

“. . . I didn’t feel any effects in the beginning. But,
when I was a little more intentional about going to
the pet therapy, and kind of settling myself down
and participating a little bit with the animal and the
trainer, I really did see some benefits. . . It just took
me two or three, or four sessions to really kind of
get into it and feel like, let’s see if it really does
make a difference. And then when I really did make
a connection then I really looked forward to going.
And I was like, yeah, this really does help me feel a
little better. And this is for me.”

Satisfaction and experiences
Post-implementation survey data indicated that employee
satisfaction with the program and implementation was
high, with 71% of respondents (n = 14) reporting that they
liked the program to a very large extent and another 14%
to a moderate extent. Employees gave the program re-
sounding endorsements, reporting that the benefits were
far-reaching, both for the individual and the clinic as a
whole.
Interviewees similarly highlighted the positive
interactions they had with the dogs and dog handlers, ex-
pressing enjoyment from observing and petting the dogs
and chatting with the dog handlers.

Employees also noted that the program stimulated social
interaction and enhanced the atmosphere in the clinic,
reporting that there was “excitability among the staff”
when the dogs were in the clinic. Employees mentioned
that they would pop into each other’s offices on program
sessions days to encourage one another to visit with the
dog. From a dog handler’s perspective,
the program
offered an opportunity for coworkers to come together,
observing that “.. .you could just tell they were relaxing,
and chatting about other things, and not work.” Employees
also appreciated the respectful nature of the program,
noting the steps taken to ensure that having the dogs in
the clinic was not intrusive nor disruptive to workflow.
that

the
program had an unintended but positive indirect effect,

In addition, qualitative findings

suggest

“I think that it definitely contributed on some level
to my wellbeing or just decreasing my stress by a
little, and distracting me, or giving you an exposure
that. . .for some people who don’t have pets, [don't
get] to have. I went home and talked about the ani-
mals, brought pictures of the animals, so it added a
lovable dimension to my life. And I think that it’s
got potential to be something more, when you’re
really looking at that big employee wellness picture.
You know, it could really be beneficial.”

Importantly,

interviewees were appreciative that this
program was offered specifically to employees, with the
intention of improving staff well-being. One employee
articulated:

“. . .it helped me to realize that the VA was trying to
do something to help me. You know, because we’re
always really focused on helping the Vet[erans], and
making the Vet[erans] feel at home, and it was like,
oh, it’s nice that they’re thinking that we need to
take care of ourselves too, in order to do a good job
with our Vet[eran]s.”

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first
published accounts of the feasibility, acceptability and
preliminary impacts of using animal-assisted support
within a healthcare setting to improve workforce well-
being. This project provides the foundation for future
research, including effectiveness trials, by showing that
implementing this type of program in a busy clinic is
feasible, and the program is acceptable to healthcare
providers and staff. Additionally, our results strongly
suggest that offering an animal-assisted support program
to healthcare employees may be positively impactful on
workforce morale, which may in turn aid in improving
the quality of care and service they provide to patients
and ultimately, patients’ experience with care.

Notably, our results suggest that animal-assisted pro-
grams could be a means to boost mood and decrease
facets of burnout (specifically, patient-related burnout)
among healthcare employees. This is an important find-
ing, because
experiencing
patient-related burnout is associated with decreased job

performance [34] and turnover intention [35] among
healthcare workers. Accordingly, improving this particu-
lar aspect of burnout in tandem with mood may facili-
tate employees to have more positive interactions with
patients, which could improve a number of important
outcomes including patient satisfaction and experiences
with care.

We did not, however, find that program participation
significantly impacted work-related or personal burnout
among the employees in our sample. These findings may
signify that participating in an animal-assisted support
program impacts facets of burnout differently. It may
also, however, reflect the limited scope of our feasibility
pilot, including that our work was contained to one hos-
pital clinic and the resulting small sample size limited
the power of our study. Accordingly, we cannot be sure
that the lack of significant differences in two of our
burnout sub-scales was attributable to the intervention
not meaningfully impacting those aspects of burnout or
a lack of power to detect differences.

Historically, interventions designed to improve work-
place burnout have focused on the individual (e.g., bol-
stering individuals’ resiliency, strategies for personal
behavior change) [36, 37]. However, literature suggests
that organizational-level strategies may be preferable to
and more impactful
than these individually focused
methods [36], signaling that intervention efforts should
focus on programs that make the work environment less
stressful and more primed toward positive employee in-
teractions and experiences. While the animal-assisted
support program that we describe here does not ameli-
orate some organizational factors that lead to burnout
(e.g., staffing, workload), other aspects make it exactly
that – an organizational resource poised to improve the
employee experience and optimize the organizational cli-
mate of their unit. Importantly, the program allows for
flexible participation that can be adapted to most any
employee’s schedule.

Given the success of the program in this study, the im-
plementation process we used provides a solid foundation
for future efforts to implement employee-targeted animal-
assisted support programs in healthcare settings. We
found several strategies particularly helpful to our imple-
mentation efforts, including pre-implementation engage-
ment of end-users, providing ample information about the
program to employees before and during implementation,
and exercising flexibility with logistics. However,
it is
important to note that implementation of this type of
program is not one-size-fits-all. The scheduling and space
protocols we describe were specifically developed to re-
flect the clinic context in which we were working. Each
healthcare facility that embarks upon such a program
should coordinate with each of its clinics to determine
their preferences for scheduling and space, and to ensure

that their employees can participate in program sessions.
One possibility for clinics that do not have space available
to dedicate for the program is to make rounds with the
dog to people’s offices or hold the visits in more public
spaces in the hospital, such as lobbies.

Our results also highlight that employee perceptions
of such programs may evolve favorably over time and
with exposure, highlighting the importance of offering
multiple program sessions over time. In addition, it is
likely that, were a program like this to be discontinued
after some time,
its positive impacts would wear off,
further substantiating the need to offer program sessions
on an ongoing basis so its desired impacts have the
opportunity to be realized. One key question, which was
beyond the scope of the current study,
is how many
times (and how regularly) individuals would need to
participate in the program to reap benefit from it, as well
as how long individuals need to interact with the dogs
during any given session and whether there are certain
activities that participants can do during these interactions
that would be more impactful. Future research should
examine these important questions, including what the
right “dose” of such a program is for it to have optimal
effects and how long the benefits of participation last.

In order to optimize future program implementation
and facilitate larger scale roll-out, additional research is
needed to assess factors that influence program imple-
mentation in various healthcare clinics across facilities of
varying size and complexity. Future work might also
explore the feasibility of implementing employee-facing
animal therapy programs in facilities where these pro-
grams do not currently exist for patients, as well as the
factors that are associated with why the program may
positively impact facets of employee wellness and (as
mentioned above) what the right dose of the program is
to optimize its impact.

Limitations
The generalizability of our results may be limited as a
result of recall/social desirability bias of self-report visual-
analogue scale and survey data, as well as some factors
related to the composition of the employees working in
the clinic (i.e., female gender predominance), and that
clinics may differ in baseline satisfaction and cohesiveness.
In addition, we did not validate the visual analogue scale
used, including its appropriateness for a healthcare worker
population, and the utility of a 5-point scale to capture
mood (e.g., as opposed to a 10-point scale). Moreover, the
way that workflow and staffing is structured in this clinic
may impact generalizability of the implementation-related
information to other similar settings wherein staffing is
handled differently. Because not everyone likes dogs, this
program may not be appropriate for all employees; alter-

considered for individuals who do not wish to interact
with a dog. Of note, because of the quasi-experimental de-
sign used and the nature of our pre/post data, the analyses
presented were descriptive and as such, we cannot draw
causal inferences from them.

Conclusion(s)
Our data suggest that animal-assisted programs could be
a means to boost mood and decrease facets of burnout
among healthcare employees. The study further suggests
that establishing such a program for employees in a busy
healthcare clinic is feasible and acceptable to employees.
Based on these results, we believe that additional re-
search to establish the effectiveness of animal-assisted
support in improving healthcare employee wellness is
warranted. In particular, randomized controlled trials
are needed to systematically assess the impacts of this
type of program on healthcare employee outcomes and
identify factors that can influence their implementation.
