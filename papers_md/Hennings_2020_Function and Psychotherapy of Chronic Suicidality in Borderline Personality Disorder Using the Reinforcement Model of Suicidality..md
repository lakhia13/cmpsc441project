Function and Psychotherapy of
Chronic Suicidality in Borderline
Personality Disorder: Using the
Reinforcement Model of Suicidality

Although great advancements in evidence-based therapies, chronic suicidal patients with
borderline personality disorder (BPD) still challenge our mental health system. While BPD
patients continue suffering from distress and aversive emotions, therapists and relatives
feel often stunned and helpless when confronted with suicidality resulting in interruption of
therapies, repeated presentations to emergency rooms and referrals to hospitals.
Reviewing the current knowledge of the functions and background of non-suicidal self-
injury, we learned that reinforcement mechanisms play an important role to understand
why individuals act in deliberate self-mutilation. While individual motives for non-suicidal
ideations can differ, the principle
self-injury and suicidal behavior including suicidal
mechanisms appear to be transferrable. Elucidating the individual motives and function
of suicidal behavior is an important therapeutic step, giving us access to very central
maladaptive schemes and false believes that we need to address in order to reduce
chronic suicidality in BPD patients. This Perspective article aims to give a better idea of
what is behind and what are the differences between non-suicidal self-injury, suicidal
ideations and suicide attempts. It further integrates recent developments of behavioral
science in a reinforcement model of suicidality that can provide therapists a practical
armamentarium in their work with chronic suicidal clients.

INTRODUCTION

Suicidality is one of the most alerting and urgent symptomatology in mental health. It summarizes a
subset of psychopathological phenomena ranging from suicidal ideations (including thinking about,
considering and planning suicide) to ambivalent suicide attempt, suicide attempt and suicide (1, 2).
Across psychiatric disorders, risk factors for suicidal behavior such as childhood maltreatment, non-
suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and previous suicide attempts have been identiﬁed (3, 4). Nevertheless,
for various reasons [discussed in (5, 6)] the assessment of these factors (derived mostly from cross-

sectional studies) does not sufﬁciently help predicting suicide
risk in a patient at a given time (7). Further, suicide rates even
increased in some populations such as adolescent girls during
last years (5, 8). On the other hand, mental health care providers
often refuse treating suicidal individuals or refer clients that
become suicidal, with few evidence that treatment termination,
referrals, or even involuntary hospitalization are effective in
reducing suicide risk (6). Although we know, that the majority
of suicide ideators will never act on their thoughts (9), in clinical
practice, we do not have useful indicators (like fearlessness about
death, subjective pain tolerance, and objective pain persistence)
that help us to differentiate between suicide ideators and
attempters (10). Further, NSSI often co-occurs in individuals
with suicidal behavior, and although it is by deﬁnition not
intended to be suicidal, clinical differentiation and appropriate
managing can be demanding (3, 11). We further do not have
good evidence for any pharmacological approach that addresses
suicidality in these individuals (12). Consistently, patients with
borderline personality disorder (BPD) that are among the
individuals with the highest rates of chronic suicidal ideations
(SI), NSSI and repeated suicide attempts, experience both, highly
frequent hospitalizations and termination of treatment as a result
of their high suicidality (13, 14).

Hence, what is behind chronic suicidality? What are the
psychological mechanisms that maintain its chronicity? Can
we apply concepts that helped us understanding and treating
NSSI also for suicidal behavior? Can or should we do
therapy in suicidal patients at all? And if yes, what are
useful interventions?

Suicidality and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury
in Borderline Personality Disorder
NSSI (e.g., cutting, scratching, head banging, skin burning) is a
world-wide phenomenon that occurs not only in BPD (15).
Thanks to many studies and more precise deﬁnitions (i.e., “not
intended to die”; discussed in [16, 17)], we acquired a much
better understanding of the motives and background of NSSI
during last years, even leading to a distinguished diagnostic
entity in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental

Disorders, 5th edition (18). As highlighted in the recent
meta-analysis of Taylor et al. (19), we learned that NSSI can
have a wide range of underlying functions within an individual
(Table 1). We can distinguish intrapersonal functions like
emotional regulation and self-punishment (escape/avoidance
of internal states) from less prevalent interpersonal functions
inﬂuence and peer bonding (3, 11, 19).
like interpersonal
Similarly, the different psychic functions of NSSI have been
modeled by Nock & Prinstein (22) comparing positive

(i.e.,
negative (i.e., involves the removal of an aversive stimulus),
and automatic (i.e., intrapersonal; e.g., emotion regulation)
versus social (i.e., interpersonal; e.g., attention, avoidance-escape)

why patients repeatedly harm themselves - accepting necessity
intervention, subsequent conﬂicts with their
of surgical
relatives, and even stigmatizing scars on their skin. In
particular, NSSI reduces the activity of the amygdala while
functional connectivity to the superior frontal gyrus is
normalized in resting-state functional magnetic resonance
imaging (23). Clinically, aversive tension decreases
immediately after NSSI, and patients can think clearer again.
It is further assumed that NSSI activates the reward system
including the endogenous opioid system, presumably also the
endocannabinoid system (24). In a prospective clinical study of
frequently self-injuring BPD patients using continuous palmtop
assessment of emotional states, Houben et al. (25) have
impressively demonstrated the strong contingency between
the occurrence of an aversive emotional state and subsequent
NSSI. He further showed that beside the negative reinforcement
of NSSI to relief emotional pain, NSSI reliably predicts the next
aversive emotion (e.g., shame because having self-injured again/
failed resolving the stressful situation), and subsequently the
next and even further next NSSI during aversive emotional
states, entering a vicious circle of repeated NSSI up to several
times daily (25).

Clinically, we can use this background knowledge in therapy.
For example, behavioral analysis like the stimulus-organismic-

response-contingencies (SORKC or SORC) model of
reinforcement-consequence (26) can illustrate to the patient in
terms of psychoeducation that NSSI is a negative reinforcer
(reduction of aversive tension) increasing the probability of
NSSI in the next stressful situation. Most simply like in
Dialectic Behavioral Therapy (DBT), the therapist can explain
why it is necessary to stop NSSI and develop alternative means
(“skills”) to reduce aversive tension in order interrupt the reward
contingency received by NSSI (14).

Can Suicidality in Borderline Be
Conceptualized Similar to Non-Suicidal
Self-Injury?
Brown, Comtois, and Linehan (20) were among the ﬁrst
investigating the background of NSSI in comparison to suicide
attempts (SA). They found that in both cases, emotional
regulation was a predominant function. In a between-person
analysis, NSSI was more intended to generate feeling, self-
punish, express anger and even distract, while SA was
signiﬁcantly more often intended to make others better off.
Interestingly, self-punishment signiﬁcantly differed between
suicide attempters and non-suicidal self-injurers in the
between-persons comparison, but not in the within-person
comparison. The authors hypothesize that people who engage
in non-suicidal acts intend to self-punish with both suicidal and
non-suicidal parasuicide. Similarities and differences between
NSSI and SA are depicted in Table 1.

Nevertheless, suicide attempts are just one symptom of
suicidality and patients not conducting SA may still have
frequent suicidal ideations or occupy with death and suicide in
the internet and exchange suicide methods in social media (27).
Indeed, SA typically occur in a circumscribed (early) phase
during the course of BPD (28), whereas suicide ideations tend
to persist over years (29). Fatally, it also turned out that highest
suicide rates occur later in the course of the illness and follow
long courses of unsuccessful treatment (30), meaning that
patients are not at their highest risk of suicide when they are
young and frequent visitors to the emergency room (29). Thus,
working in therapy with chronic suicidality (beyond
management of NSSI and SA) appears to be mandatory in
order to prevent later suicides. At this point, the question rises
whether we can simply adapt the reinforcement model described
for NSSI to chronic suicidality? Can we assume similar
contingency consequences for the appearance of suicide
ideations in aversive emotional states? In other words:

Can Thoughts Be Modeled Like Behavior
in Psychotherapy?
When we work with behavioral analysis in psychotherapy, we
usually focus on (mostly) dysfunctional behavior, i.e., things that
we have done, that have some kind of positive or negative
consequences. As seen above, these consequences can reinforce
me to act similarly the next time: Cutting in a stressful situation,
e.g., will
immediately reduce aversive tension (negative
reinforcement) and may even give me the feeling of control
is being
over my emotions (positive reinforcement). But,

ideations really that different if these
absorbed to suicidal
suicidal thoughts give me a kind of perspective, relief or just the
idea that the current aversive situation will end? Chiles & Strosahl
report that adolescents that experience intense emotional pain in
response to internal (e.g., thinking of disabilities) or external
stimuli can feel a kind of relief from the emotional distress
when thinking about suicide (31). Similar to various behavioral
patterns assigned to Hayes's so-called Experiential Avoidance
(32), like NSSI, eating disorder or substance abuse that function
to escape, avoid or modify an experience, suicidality can be
regarded as a way to suppress emotions with suicide being the
ultimate attempt at controlling psychological pain (33, 34). It was
further Hayes (35), who integrated the obvious conceptual gap of
internal processes (cognition) and behavior in his Relational
Frame Theory (35) and, therapeutically, in the Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy (ACT) (32). Assuming, according to the
ACT theory, that human behaviors are functional, suicidality
including thinking of suicide can be regarded as “a learned
method of problem solving that involves escaping from or
avoiding intense negative emotions” (31). Hayes states, that
compared to classical reinforcement models (e.g., avoidance of
closed rooms in agoraphobia, or relief from obsessional thoughts
(e.g., contamination) by acting out compulsions (e.g., excessive
hand washing), the relief in these situations is not directly
conditioned (i.e., persons have not experienced that death
releases emotional pain). Instead,
individuals may have
constructed “if … then” verbal associations [like “If I die, the
bullying by my peers will stop” (36)]. This “verbal behavior”,
enters a long-term conditioning processes, and may have aversive
(negative) or appetitive (positive) consequences [see Murrell et al.
for overview (33)]. Thus, applying this model to chronic
suicidality in BPD, suicidal ideations (the verbal behavior) can
reduce hopelessness, helplessness or unbearable anger and act as a
negative reinforcer that will increase the probability of similar
suicidal associations in an upcoming situation that produce
similar aversive tension (Figure 1). The individual that
experience a relief from suicidal ideations may feel an even
bigger reinforcement value when he considers how, when, and
where suicide would occur (31), letting him researching suicide
methods in the internet, discuss suicide in online platforms, or
even, when he prepares a suicide by collecting pills, looking for an
appropriate place for hanging or a bridge to jump. The individual
who ideates suicide, “from this perspective, experiences the
ultimate reinforcement—a way to permanently and completely
control difﬁcult emotional experiences” (31).

Contagious Suicidality?
It is frequently observed (for example in acute psychiatric
settings) that BPD patients adopt dysfunctional behavior from
other BPD patients (e.g., cutting although not having cutting
before) indicating that the behavior must have a quite strong (at
least short-term) positive consequence (they ﬁnd out what helps
best or they feel connected to peers that understand their need)
(37, 38). One can speculate that exchange of suicide topics in
online platforms is a similar phenomenon where patients try out
different suicidal associations while discussing among each other.
Not only can a suicidal association in Hayes's sense act as a

Psychotherapy of Suicidality

FIGURE 1 | Chain analysis and stimulus-organismic-response-contingencies (SORKC) model of suicidal symptoms: A behavioral (chain) analysis of suicidal
symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, internet research, preparation of suicide) that occur after the boyfriend of Jess questioned their relationship (cue, S). Jess instantly
is surprised and fears losing Pete (primary emotions directly related to the situation; grief would be likely also). The ﬁrst emotions disappear rapidly while Jess's
maladaptive cognitive schemes (O) get activated (her interpretation of the situation against the background of her childhood experiences). These judgements in turn
activate secondary emotions (like helplessness, hopelessness, panic) causing signiﬁcant distress. Of note, these transitions from primary emotions to secondary
emotions can be very fast letting patients even not notice their primary emotion at all (14). Thinking of suicide, the visit of suicide chats in the internet and suicidal
communication with peers (R) calms Jess down and gives her a kind of feeling of control and hope (“I could escape,” “There is a way out,” “I must not suffer”). This
contingency between psychological pain and relief (K/C) acts as a strong negative reinforcer (¢-) that increases the likelihood of suicidal ideations in the next situation
of distress. On the other hand, long-term (i.e., after the immediate relief of pain) emotions like feeling of insufﬁciency, shame or loneliness occur (“I can't live alone,”
“I am incapable in relationships,” “Anybody likes me,” “I am alone in the world”) that support in turn the assumptions/maladaptive schemes. The vicious cycle of
reinforcement of suicidality and repeated conﬁrmation of central cognitive/emotional schemes results in long-lasting, recurrent, chronic suicidality.

negative reinforcer as described above (e.g., relief of pain), the
exchange itself may become a kind of addictive behavior. In his
theory of suicide addiction, Tullis (21) nicely describes these
observations in his patients: Contemplating suicide can be
pleasurable in some people, or, at least can be a break from
psychological pain. Suicidal thoughts or behavior can be a form
of self-medication in these individuals and reliving previous
suicide attempts in thought or imaging death can become a
ritual (or even trance-like) behavior providing a sense of control
and an optional way out of pain. In his patients, Tullis further
observed a calming sensation during suicidal thinking (up to a
“rush,” “high,” “thrill,” “exhilaration”), they developed a
tolerance to the effects of suicidal thoughts over time and
engaged in compulsive rituals and behaviors, including secretly
collecting and hoarding paraphernalia for suicide, characteristics
we observe similarly in addictive disorders. Hence, these
behavioral observations support the hypothesis that in some
individuals, occupation with suicide is pleasurable, reduces pain
and becomes “a way of life” (39) - psychologically spoken, are
object to reinforcement and contingency loops.

Judgments and Beliefs Are the Toxic
Ingredients of the Reinforcement Model
of Suicidality
When we look out for a new approach addressing suicidality in
BPD, then working with the background and motives becomes

vital in the proper sense. In the language of behavioral analysis, it
is the organism variable that determines how we rate and react
upon upcoming stimuli (40, 41). Besides biological factors, the
organism variable is largely inﬂuenced by experiences we made,
messages we became when we were a child or parent models we
had (42). Similar to our clinical example in Figure 1, suicidal
adolescents and BPD frequently share believes of being
worthless, inadequate, rejected or blameworthy resulting from
invalidation or traumatization (33, 42). Typical examples in these
cases are: “I can't live alone,” “I am false,” “I don't have a place in
the world,” “I am bad,” “I can't handle it.” They are robust
convictions of themselves and the outside world or automatic
thoughts (43) that become activated (in their conscious mind)
through internal or external cues (e.g., when they are or feel
offended, disappointed, rejected, lonely,…). As shown recently,
dependent of the severity of BPD, aversive emotional states can
then highly contingently linked to a speciﬁc dysfunctional
behavior (e.g., intense anger after being offended, or NSSI after
being disappointed) (44).

Using behavioral analysis, the therapist may elucidate
reinforcing contingencies within the vicious chain of cues,
activated faulty believes and subsequent suicidal ideations. He
further can look for more adaptive behavioral alternatives or
identify possible obstacles that inhibit the application of
functional behavior. Typical obstacles can be, e.g., intensive
emotions of fear, shame or guilt, or faulty believes and
assumptions (e.g., “I am a looser,” “I have no right”) (14). The

Psychotherapy of Suicidality

latter is probably the most important aspect that helps
understanding the background and function of suicidality in
these patients.

Similar to the reinforcer model of NSSI described above, we can
speculate that the conﬁrmation of central schemes together with the
reinforcement of suicidal ideations stabilizes the dysfunctional
system of chronic suicidality. Conversely, in NSSI on the other
hand, the rapid dynamic of the next aversive emotional states
directly after NSSI exempliﬁed in the Houben study (25) acts as a
punishment in the behavioral sense, resulting presumably in an
earlier fade out of self-injuring behavior after some time (as
frequently observed in the courses of BPD), while chronic
suicidality persists.

Interventions Deduced From the
Reinforcement Model of Suicidality
Addressing the motives and psychic function behind suicidal
behavior depending on speciﬁc situations (or triggers) may be
a ﬁrst, but potentially very powerful step in the therapeutic
work with suicidal BPD patients. They may feel a substantial
validation by going through their individual behavioral
analysis and by understanding their own reinforcement
mechanisms (Figure 1). As described by Murrell (33),
normalization of suicidal ideations or behavior with respect
to the individual's situation (“If I were in this situation, I would
think/feel similar.”) and in comparison to others (“Many
people at your age have had serious thoughts about killing
themselves – it isn't that uncommon or weird.”) can reduce
shame (about not getting along with the challenges of life, e.g.)
and helps establishing acceptability of discussing suicide in an
honest and genuine way. Working with faulty believes and
assumptions may be one of the most challenging, but on the
long run, inevitable approaches in psychotherapy of chronic
suicidality. Cognitive techniques as well as emotional exposure
in order to reach a cognitive and emotional reappraisal may be
applied here (14, 42). As proposed in ACT, so-called defusion
techniques (i.e., distancing and disconnecting techniques from
thoughts and feelings) can be a highly relevant addressing
negative judgements and believes, too (33). Given the high
invalidation
prevalence of traumatization and substantial
experiences in chronic suicidal individuals, exposure-based
trauma therapy has an important
impact on suicidal
symptoms and, according to recent developments in DBT for
posttraumatic stress disorder can (and most likely should) start
as soon as possible (45, 46). Within this confrontation, time for
the grieving process and ﬁnally acceptance of what has
happened in the past is inevitable. For this process, ACT and
the compassion-focused therapy provide useful assistance (32,
47). In parallel, it becomes important to establish alternative
non-suicidal behavior that at least at the beginning is
reinforced with help from the therapist. On the long run, the
goal is to establish a naturally reinforcing system, e.g., by using
values of the patient: building up and connection to a circle of
friends, feeling of conjointness by taking responsibility and
social integration (i.e., volunteering, taking care of a pet,…).
According to Hayes, also “verbal behavior” can enter such

long-term conditioning processes, like “If I live, my parents
might get to see me graduate from college someday,” or “If I
kill myself, it would really hurt my family to go to my funeral”
[taken from (33)]. Without claiming completeness, the
Supplemental Table gives an overview of possible
interventions that can be derived from the behavioral
analysis of reinforcement (Supplemental Table 1). These
interventions comprise standard behavioral techniques as
described in DBT, ACT, and compassion-focused therapy,
including validation techniques, psychoeducation, cognitive
techniques, emotional regulation, and the development of
alternative behavior and skills. The proposed approaches are
mostly adapted to the clinical example depicted in Figure 1,
but they may be transferred also to other BPD patients with
chronic suicidality.

DISCUSSION

We have seen that similar to NSSI, suicidal ideations and
behavior can have various motives and functions. Overall,
these functions appear to have in common to signiﬁcantly
reduce mental pain, be it by reducing aversive tension, by
giving an idea of a way out of the current situation, or by
giving a sense of control of difﬁcult emotions (like guilt, shame,
intense anger). Thus, it appears plausible that reinforcement
mechanism as presented here are substantially involved not only
in NSSI, but also in chronic suicidality. Intriguingly, a recent
functional MRI study strongly substantiates this concept from a
neurobiological perspective using autobiographic transcripts to
recall patients' previous suicidal episodes: In this paradigm,
mental pain triggering suicidal behavior is associated with
decreased prefrontal activity whereas planning and acting out
suicidal
impulses (in mind) in response to mental pain is
associated with increased activity in the medial prefrontal
cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the hippocampus
suggesting that goal-directed suicidal behavior is associated
with a reduction of mental pain (48).

Nevertheless, there is still a big gap in the literature delineating
the continuum from passive suicidal thoughts, ideations of dying or
being death to suicide attempt preparation and deﬁnite suicidal acts,
and the psychological function of each of these suicidal behaviors
may be very different within and between individual subjects.
Indeed, there is strong evidence from neurobiology, that NSSI, SI,
and SA have very distinct (and sustained) effects on the regulation of
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormonal axis, a system
that is essentially important in adaptation to challenging situations
in life. It has been shown, for example, that cortisol response in the
combined dexamethasone suppression/corticotropin releasing
hormone stimulation test is attenuated in both, past and recent
suicide attempters compared to suicide ideators or non-suicidal
patients in major depression (49). In another most recent study, the
interaction of a HPA axis response with psychosocial stress
differentially predicts suicidal behavior and ideations within 18
months, with, again, a lower cortisol response being associated
with suicidal behavior (50). Interestingly in this regard, epigenetic

Psychotherapy of Suicidality

mechanisms have been claimed to be involved in the neurobiology
of suicidality including the HPA axis regulation (51) which may
possibly explain some sustained effects observed in recurrent suicide
attempters. The meaning of these ﬁndings and its implementation
to psychological models of suicidality deﬁnitively needs further
investigation. The challenge of future research will thus be to
combine sophisticated methods form both, neurobiology and
psychology. In both cases, clear differentiation and deﬁnitions of
suicidal symptoms is of eminent importance.

From the clinical perspective too, a thorough assessment of all
degrees of suicidality becomes crucial for the therapist when
estimating the individual patient's risk to proceed from ideating
to acting in suicide during treatment. In particular, he wants to
know, which factors pushes the patient form ideation to suicidal
action. Fearlessness about death and pain tolerance occurs in
several suicide models as a factor differentiating suicide ideators
from attempters (3, 4, 9, 52, 53), and most robust predictors of
SA identiﬁed in studies may be closely related to these items as
they reﬂect a previous experience of loss of physical integrity
(e.g., NSSI, history of previous SA, childhood maltreatment).
They can indeed be helpful for the therapist estimating the
patient's individual risk of progression from ideation to
attempts, with connectedness being one of the most important
protective factor in this respect (52). Nevertheless, the reliability
of the prediction (i.e., the negative predictive value in this case)
may be too low to exclude a suicide risk, and the results of recent
studies have questioned the ability of such factors to robustly
distinguish suicide ideators from attempters across diagnostic
entities including student samples (10, 54–57). Further, what to
do in psychotherapy with BPD patients that are carriers of
suicide risk factors? The assessment of predictors alone does
not give an answer to this question. But, without doubt, these
patients in particular should be subject to a psychotherapy
addressing their suicidality. There is a common understanding
in third wave behavioral therapies [discussed in (42)], that new
behavior or alternative experience can only be learned or made
by the brain when it is done in the same or a similar situation that
normally would have cued the old (dysfunctional) behavior. In
other words, the patient needs to act (or think) differently in a
situation he normally becomes suicidal. And, at this point,
referral to a hospital would likewise not allow a new
experience (but will conﬁrm old assumptions: “I have failed
again,” “I can't handle it on my own,” “I am punished because I
behave badly,” “suicide is the best option”). Instead, the therapist
needs to assist him just then: In the real situation (e.g., during a
crisis), or in activated states of critical emotions (of whom the
therapist knows its link to the patient's suicidal behavior) in a
therapy session, the therapist needs to guide the patient to
regulate its emotions, reﬂect the situation and help applying
new behavior. For this purpose, the therapist may offer telephone
or online coaching, techniques of emotional regulation and stress
tolerance, as well as thorough behavioral analysis of suicidal
behavior and thinking. Nevertheless, this kind of work with
suicidal patients is demanding and indispensably needs a secure
frame also for the therapist. Apart from a common commitment
of both sides (“going the new way,” “ﬁnding a way to stay alive,”

“being ready for exposure”) the use of non-suicide contracts,
individual crisis plans and agreements about contingencies (what
happens after NSSI, SA, therapy-interfering behavior,…) have
been strongly recommended for the psychotherapy of chronic
suicidality in BPD (14).

Although we have learned a lot about suicidality during last years
and speciﬁc programs from different therapeutic schools including
behavioral and psychodynamic approaches (58) helped many
individuals, the implementation of validated anti-suicidal
interventions and suicide prevention for a larger number of affected
people is still needed. Educative suicide prevention programs using
the internet and social media have now been launched addressing the
need of low-threshold communication with individuals at risk and
further aiming to increase suicide-prevention-related knowledge (59,
60). Nevertheless, understanding the individual background of
suicidality takes time, a trustful therapeutic relation and non-
judgmental attitude of the therapist. The proposed reinforcement
model of suicidality applies basic behavioral techniques to chronic
suicidal BPD patients. It is not a new model. It integrates theoretic
concepts that helped us understanding related phenomena like NSSI
and suicide attempts. It further includes known interventions that
have been efﬁcient in suicidality and the treatment of BPD, such as
DBT and ACT. But, it especially stresses the role of reinforcement of
suicidal ideations and behavior, thus giving us tools to work with the
patient and to ﬁnd a shared commitment for planned interventions in
order to dissolve suicidal contingencies. Albeit, it is of vital importance
to further investigate the background of suicidality, especially with
respect to all forms of suicidal ideations and behavior in chronic
suicidal patients. Precise deﬁnitions and assessments appear to be
crucial in these studies. Further, many of the here mentioned
techniques have not speciﬁcally been tested upon its ability to
modify central dysfunctional schemes or reinforcements so far.
Modern neurobiological techniques like fMRI, neuroendocrinology
or epigenetics in combination with appropriate psychological
paradigms may help us to further prove our concepts, detect new
options for anti-suicidal interventions and hypothetically speciﬁcally
monitor therapeutic effects.
