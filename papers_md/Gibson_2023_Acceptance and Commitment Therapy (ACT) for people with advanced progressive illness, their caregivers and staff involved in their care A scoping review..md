Abstract
Background:  People  with  an  advanced  progressive  illness  and  their  caregivers  frequently  experience  anxiety,  uncertainty  and 
anticipatory grief. Traditional approaches to address psychological concerns aim to modify dysfunctional thinking; however, this is 
limited in palliative care, as often concerns area valid and thought modification is unrealistic. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is 
a mindfulness-based behavioural therapy aimed at promoting acceptance and valued living even in difficult circumstances. Evidence 
on its value in palliative care is emerging.
Aims: To scope the evidence regarding Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for people with advanced progressive illness, their 
caregivers and staff involved in their care.
Design: Systematic scoping review using four databases (Medline, PsychInfo, CINAHL and AMED), with relevant MeSH terms and 
keywords from January 1999 to May 2023.
Results: 1,373 papers were identified and 26 were eligible for inclusion. These involved people with advanced progressive illness 
(n = 14), informal caregivers (n = 4), palliative care staff (n = 3), bereaved carers (n = 3), and mixed groups (n = 2). Intervention studies 
(n = 15)  showed  that  Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  is  acceptable  and  may  have  positive  effects  on  anxiety,  depression, 
distress, and sleep in palliative care populations. Observational studies (n = 11) revealed positive relationships between acceptance 
and adjustment to loss and physical function.
Conclusion: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is acceptable and feasible in palliative care, and may improve anxiety, depression, 
and  distress.  Full  scale  mixed-method  evaluation  studies  are  now  needed  to  demonstrate  effectiveness  and  cost-effectiveness 
amongst patients; while further intervention development and feasibility studies are warranted to explore its value for bereaved 
carers and staff.

••

••

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy interventions are feasible and acceptable for people with advanced progressive 
illness; and may improve anxiety, depression, distress, sleep, and quality of life.
Evidence on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for people with advanced progressive diseases other than cancer is 
lacking; and there are very few studies on its use or value for bereavement support.

Implications for practice, theory or policy

••

••

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy has the potential to help manage psychological concerns in palliative care set-
tings, though further evidence of effectiveness is warranted.
Training for palliative care staff in the principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy could increase access to evi-
dence-based psychological support for people with advanced progressive illness.

Introduction

Palliative  care  is  an  approach  that  aims  to  improve  the 
quality of life of people who are facing problems associ-
ated  with  advanced  progressive  illness,  and  their  fami-
lies.1 Existential distress is frequently a concern for people 
with an advanced progressive illness, irrespective of cul-
ture or type of disease.1 Anxiety, worry, uncertainty, loss 
of  control  and  social  role  are  common.2–5  Some  people 
find  it  hard  to  engage  in  meaningful  activities  and  rela-
tionships,  may  lose  hope,  and  experience  anticipatory 
grief  .6,7  Regrets  can  occur  where  there  is  discrepancy 
between  how  people  want  things  to  happen  and  how 
they actually happen. These include regrets due to unfin-
ished role responsibilities and broken relationships.4,6

Caregivers of people with an advanced progressive ill-
ness  can  also  experience  depression,  anticipatory  grief, 
loneliness,  and  a  disturbance  in  their  sense  of  meaning 
and purpose.8 Increases in psychological symptoms such 
as anxiety and depression, as well as physical symptoms 
such as fatigue and pain due to their caregiver role is also 
common.9  Up  to  40%  of  caregivers  are  at  moderate  or 
high  risk  of  prolonged  grief  disorder  following  bereave-
ment.10 Bereavement support needs increased during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, with many people reporting severe 
grief  and  difficulties  accessing  support.11,12  Evidence 
based interventions that help patients and caregivers rec-
ognise and manage psychological distress in the context 
of deteriorating health and bereavement are vital for high 
quality palliative care.4,13

Staff  caring  for  people  with  an  advanced  progressive 
illness  are  at  risk  of  stress,  distress  and  burnout.  This  is 
partly due to the typical demands associated with work-
ing  in  healthcare  such  as  unmanageable  workloads  and 
staff  shortages,  but  also  because  of  regular  exposure  to 
death, grief and loss.14–19 Over one-third of palliative care 
physicians met the criteria for burnout during the COVID-
19 pandemic, further highlighting the need for interven-
tions to support mental wellbeing amongst staff.20

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a form 
of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy that has its roots in radi-
cal  behaviourism  and  emphasises  how  we  respond  to 

thoughts  and  feelings,  rather  than  trying  to  alter  the 
meaning of the situation as in traditional cognitive ther-
apy.21 It supports people to identify what is important to 
them, and to take action to enable them to live a life of 
meaning  and  value.22  Instead  of  focussing  on  emotion 
regulation  and  symptom  reduction,  Acceptance  and 
Commitment  Therapy  promotes  acceptance  of  difficult 
thoughts and feelings, and acting in ways that are aligned 
with meaningful and valued living, even in the presence of 
difficult  thoughts,  feelings  and  circumstances.23  This  dif-
ferent focus gives Acceptance and Commitment Therapy 
a clear rationale and potential to improve wellbeing and 
quality of life of those impacted by advanced progressive 
illness, including caregivers and staff.

The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy model con-
sists  of  six  interdependent  and  overlapping  processes. 
These processes are: (1) Acceptance – making space for 
challenging thoughts and emotions versus suppression or 
avoidance; (2) Defusion – stepping back from unhelpful 
thoughts  and  emotions  to  reduce  their  influence;  (3) 
Contact with the present moment – maintaining flexible 
awareness of the present versus being overly influenced 
by concerns about the past or future); (4) Self as context 
–  flexible  perspective  taking  on  our  own  self  narratives 
versus  being  dominated  by  a  rigidly  held  set  of  beliefs 
about who we are; (5) Values – identification of personal 
qualities  and  behaviours  for  a  meaningful  life  versus 
dominance  by  expectations;  (6)  Committed  Action  – 
effective  actions  guided  by  values  versus  inaction  or 
impulsivity.24

There is a rapidly growing evidence base for the efficacy 
of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in the treatment 
of a broad range of disorders and conditions, with recent 
systematic reviews describing its potential value for people 
with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, chronic illness, can-
cer  survivorship,  audiological  problems,  eating  disorders, 
neurodevelopmental disorders, autism, sleep disorders as 
well as student wellbeing.25–36 Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy  can  also  be  effective  in  improving  general  and 
work-related distress amongst health care professionals,37 
and  for  improving  depression  and  quality  of  life  amongst 
caregivers.28 However, despite the emerging evidence base 

1102 

Palliative Medicine 37(8)

for  the  effectiveness  of  Acceptance  and  Commitment 
Therapy  across  a  range  of  populations  and  contexts,  we 
identified  only  three  reviews  focused  specifically  on 
advanced  progressive  illness  or  bereavement.38–40  Two  of 
these reviews concluded that Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy may be beneficial in improving quality of life and 
alleviating  symptoms  of  anxiety  and  distress  amongst 
patients with advanced cancer38,39 However, both reviews 
excluded  studies  of  people  with  advanced  illnesses  other 
than  cancer,  and  considered  evidence  based  on  RCTs  or 
quasi-experimental studies only.38 Neither review sought to 
explore the potential value of Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy for caregivers or staff involved in the care of peo-
ple with advanced progressive illness. Consequently, given 
the emerging use of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy 
in palliative care41 and its potential to improve outcomes 
for patients, caregivers and staff, we sought to determine 
the scope of the literature on Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy  for  a  broadly  defined  palliative  care  population. 
We were keen to report on all types of evidence that might 
address and inform clinical practice, explore how research 
has  been  conducted,  identify  characteristics  related  to 
delivering  Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  in  this 
field,  examine  the  outcomes  that  have  been  evaluated, 
impacts reported and identify evidence gaps.

Aim and research questions

Our  aim  was  to  map  the  evidence  on  Acceptance  and 
Commitment Therapy for people with an advanced pro-
gressive  illness,  their  caregivers  (includes  family  mem-
bers),  and  staff  involved  in  their  care.  Specific  research 
questions were:

1.  What is the evidence for the feasibility, acceptabil-
ity,  and  effectiveness  of  Acceptance  and 
Commitment Therapy for people with a terminal 
or advanced progressive illness, their informal car-
egivers,  including  bereaved  caregivers,  and  staff 
involved with their care?

2.  How  has  Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy 
has been delivered in palliative care settings (for-
mat, duration, mode of delivery, content, facilita-
tion, barriers)?

3.  What types of research designs have been under-

taken and what outcomes have been measured?

Method

Design

A  systematic  scoping  review  was  undertaken,  guided  by 
the  Joanna  Briggs 
Institute  framework  for  scoping 
reviews.42 This type of review allows diverse types of evi-
dence to be mapped comprehensively to identify all evi-
dence in an emerging field.42 Scoping reviews are useful 

for examining broad areas to identify evidence gaps, clar-
ify  key  concepts  and  report  on  evidence  to  address  and 
inform  progress  in  a  topic  area.  The  PRISMA-ScR  guide-
lines  were  used  to  inform  the  reporting  of  the  review.43 
The  protocol  was  registered  on  the  Open  Science 
Framework registries: (https://osf.io/tpqax).

Eligibility criteria

We included studies regarding the use of Acceptance and 
Commitment Therapy for people with an advanced pro-
gressive illness, their caregivers or staff involved in their 
care (Table 1).

Types of sources

We considered empirical research studies published after 
1999  (when  Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  was 
first described in detail).23 This includes quantitative, qual-
itative, and mixed method studies; studies carried out in 
the  English  language.  We  excluded  reviews,  editorials, 
commentaries, case studies and dissertations below doc-
toral  level;  any  studies  which  did  not  specify  clearly 
whether  a  majority  (>50%)  of  the  population  had  an 
advanced  progressive  illness;  any  studies  where  the 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy based intervention 
focused  only  on  one  component  of  Acceptance  and 
Commitment Therapy (e.g. mindfulness); and any studies 
where  Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  was  not  a 
major component (<50%).

Search strategy

An  electronic  search  was  carried  out  in  Ovid  MEDLINE, 
PsychInfo,  AMED  and  CINAHL  covering  the  period  of 
January 1999 to 12th May 2023.The search was undertaken 
using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) 
and free text search terms for palliative care, Acceptance 
and  Commitment  Therapy  and  a  range  of  terms  for 
advanced progressive illnesses (See Supplemental File for 
Ovid MEDLINE search strategy). The terms used to retrieve 
the relevant papers were based on prior reviews and guid-
ance from the research team’s expertise in psychological 
therapies and palliative care. The terms were adapted fol-
lowing pilot searches and varied slightly depending on the 
requirements  of  the  database.  ProQuest,  ISRCTN  and 
ICTRP registries were searched to identify further relevant 
papers.  The  reference  lists  of  included  papers  and  the 
reviews  identified  were  hand-searched.  Finally,  all  cita-
tions  were  exported  to  Endnote  and  duplicates  were 
removed.

Data screening

Titles and abstracts were screened by one reviewer (TGW) 
and a sub-sample (25%) were independently reviewed by

a second reviewer (AF) to check consistency as the search-
ing progressed. Full texts were reviewed by one co-author 
(TGW)  and  a  sub-sample  (50%)  were  independently 
reviewed by a second (AF). Any queries were discussed by 
the full team to determine a definite list of studies.

Data extraction

Data were extracted by one reviewer (TGW) using a data 
extraction  protocol  developed  for  the  purpose  of  the 
study.44  A  second  reviewer  (AF)  reviewed  a  sub-sample 
(five papers) to help to ensure the accuracy and congru-
ency  in  the  data  extraction  process.  The  extracted  data 
was tabulated on an Excel spreadsheet according to the 
following: author(s), title, author(s) origin, year of publi-
cation, journal, study type, population, setting, methodol-
ogy,  intervention  format,  healthcare  professional  level 
and outcomes. Any uncertainty with data categorisation 
was reviewed by all co-authors. Due to the wide range of 
study methodologies and heterogeneous nature of data, 
and in keeping with the aims of a scoping review, quality 
appraisal was not carried out.42

Data analysis and synthesis

Based on our interest in scoping evidence on Acceptance 
and Commitment Therapy relevant to patients, caregivers 
and staff, we decided on a broadly deductive approach in 
order to map evidence for these groups. However, during 
the review process, it became clear that evidence could be 
usefully  categorised  as  pertaining  to  interventions  using 
Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy;  or  observation 
studies  describing  relationships  between  Acceptance  and 
Commitment  Therapy  components  and  outcomes  com-
monly assessed in palliative care. Consequently, we decided 
intervention  and  observational 
to  separately  report 

studies. Consequently. For intervention studies we reported 
data on key characteristics such as setting, mode of inter-
vention delivery, intervention format, outcomes assessed, 
enrolment  and  retention  rates  as  well  as  findings.  For 
observational  studies  we  reported  data  on  study  aim, 
methods, outcomes and key findings. To support integra-
tion,  quantitative  data  were  tabulated  and  analysed 
descriptively  in  MS  Excel.  All  studies  were  imported  into 
NVivo so any qualitative data could be analysed and syn-
thesised descriptively guided by the review aims (e.g. evi-
dence on intervention acceptability).

Results

Study selection

A  total  of  17,638  records  were  identified  from  the  elec-
tronic searches of databases, registries and hand search-
ing  reference 
lists.  Duplicates  were  removed  using 
Endnote resulting in 1,373 citations, a further 1,271 irrel-
evant  records  were  excluded  after  screening.  A  total  of 
102 articles were selected for full text review. Overall, 26 
studies were included (See Figure 1).

Overview of studies

Nearly half of the 26 studies included were conducted in 
the  USA  (n = 11;  42%),45–55  around  a  quarter  in  the  UK 
(n = 6; 23%)56–61 and a quarter in Australia (n = 6; 23%).62–
67  Articles  identified  were  published  from  2012  to  2023 
(see  Supplemental  File:  Figure  1).  The  publication  rate 
accelerated  during  that  time,  with  the  highest  number 
being published in 2020 (n = 5). Of the 26 papers included, 
interventions  studies16,46,48,49,52–55,57,60–63,66,68

The  majority  of  articles  examined  Acceptance  and 
Commitment Therapy for patients (n = 15; 58%).16,47–50,52–
54,57,58,60,65,67,69 Of these, 10 papers were focused on peo-
ple  with  advanced  cancer.16,47,49,50,52–54,57,58,60  Four  were 
focused  on  Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  for

and one staff.61

Settings. Four  of  the  15  intervention  studies  (27%) 
described  interventions  in  hospitals16,53,62,63,  eight  (53%) 

Gibson Watt et al. 

1105

described interventions in home settings.46,48,49,52,55,61,66,68 
One intervention was delivered in both the hospital and 
community  (7%)54  and  one  was  hospice-based  (7%).57 
One paper described an intervention delivered in a hos-
pice, therapist’s clinic or home (7%).60 See Supplemental 
File: Figure 5.

Intervention mode of delivery. Most interventions evalu-
ated  were  individual  focused  (n = 8;  53%)46,49,52–54,60,63,68; 
three were group57,62,66, four were mixed (see Supplemen-
tal  File:  Figure  6).16,48,55,61  Interventions  were  most  com-
monly  delivered  in  person  (n = 5,  33%),46,53,57,60,62  or  by 
telephone  (n = 5;  33%)48,49,52,55,68  (see  Supplemental  File: 
Figure 7).

Types of professionals delivering acceptance and commit-
ment therapy interventions. Nearly half of the evaluated 
interventions  (7/15;  47%)  were  delivered  by  specialists 
such as clinical psychologists.16,52–54,57,60,61,63,66,68 A further 
three  (20%)  were  delivered  by  social  workers,48,49,55, 
three  (20%)  were  delivered  by  clinical  psychology  stu-
dents.53,63,68  One  was  delivered  by  an  MSc  student  and 
supervised by a clinical psychologist (7%)46 (see Supple-
mental File: Table 2).

Intervention  content. All  interventions  incorporated  the 
six core Acceptance and Commitment Therapy processes. 
Four  combined  Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy 
with another intervention – traditional CBT,54 Coping Skills 
Training,52  Problem-solving  Skills  Training.62  The  studies 
used a variety of media, with five studies providing home-
work in the form of audiobooks,52,66 online modules,16,61 
DVDs54 and booklets52,63,66 (Table 3).

For treatment integrity, four of the intervention studies 
intervention  fidelity  with  developed 
(27%)  assessed 
checklists  to  ensure  adherence  to  the  treatment  proto-
col48,49,55,66, four other studies carried out informal fidelity 
checks.52,54,57,61 Three of the papers stated that in future 
research they would develop fidelity checklists.46,60,61

Duration  and  frequency  of  interventions. Total  duration 
of the interventions varied from 15 min to 12 h (Table 3). 
The longest intervention consisted of 12 weeks of 1 h in-
person  sessions  delivered  in  hospital  to  people  with 
advanced  cancer.53  The  shortest  duration  was  a  one-off 
individual  phone  call  (15–60 min)  for  informal  caregiv-
ers.68  Intervention  sessions  ranged  from  15  to  120 min: 
in-person  based  sessions  (60–90 min)  and  technology-
based  sessions  (45–120 min).  Group-based  sessions 
lasted longer than the individual-based sessions. Two of 
the papers did not specify the duration of their interven-
tion sessions (13%).46,63

The frequency of the interventions ranged from one-
off63,68 to 12 sessions.53 The 12-session study adopted an 
individual in-person mode of delivery.53 Two thirds of the 

papers  delivered  weekly  sessions  (n = 10)46,48,49,54,55,57,60–
62,66 with three delivering booster sessions a month after 
the last session.57,62,66

Data  collection  points  during  interventions. Most  inter-
vention  studies  (n = 14/15)  collected  outcome  data  pre 
and  post  intervention.16,46,48,49,52–55,57,60–63,66  Ten  of  these 
further  assessed  their  outcomes  1–12 months  after  the 
intervention was delivered.16,46,48,49,53–55,61–63

Outcome  measures  reported  in  intervention  studies. A 
range  of  physical  and  psychological  outcome  measures 
were  assessed  (see  Supplemental  File:  Figure  8/9).  Psy-
chological  flexibility  was  assessed  in  nearly  all  papers 
(n = 12; 80%),46,48,52,53,55,57,60–63,66,68, four of these used the 
AAQ-II to assess psychological flexibility.55,60,63,66 Other key 
outcomes  assessed  included  anxiety  (n = 6),16,52–54,63,66 
depression  (n = 6),16,52–54,63,66  distress  (n = 7),48,52–54,57,60,62 
valued  living  (n = 7)46,52,55,60,63,66,68  and  pain  interference 
(n = 5).16,46,48,49,52

Feasibility  and  acceptability  of  acceptance  and  commit-
ment  therapy. Six  of  the  15  intervention  studies  exam-
ined  feasibility  and  acceptability  as  one  of  their  stated 
outcomes.16,52,55,60,61,63  Enrolment  rates  varied 
from 
19-82%. The studies reporting the lowest levels of recruit-
ment involved participants recently referred to a hospice 
service in the UK (19% of those eligible consented),57 and 
an  intervention  involving  parents  with  elevated  stress 
symptoms  with  a  child  admitted  to  hospital  for  a  life-
threatening  illness  or  injury  (25%  consented).  Recruit-
ment was highest (82%) in a study involving patients with 
Stage  III  or  Stage  IV  ovarian  cancer,  in  which  eligible 
patients were informed about the study during their rou-
tine  clinic,  and  the  intervention  was  scheduled  to  take 
place  alongside  their  routine  appointments  to  minimise 
travel  and  time  requirements.53  Across  all  interventions 
studies,  retention  rates  ranged  from  26-88%.  Retention 
was  highest  (88%)  for  a  study  which  used  an  individual 
telephone  based 
lasting 
45 min, removing barriers of in-person intervention such 
as illness and travel.52 It lowest for a study involving six-
session  online  group  intervention  for  in  parents  of  chil-
illness.62  Detailed  data  on 
dren  with  a 
enrolment and retention data can be found organised by 
participant population in Table 4 in Supplemental File 1.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy results in improve-
ments  in  a  range  of  outcomes,  though  some  improve-
ments were not statistically significant (Supplemental File: 
Table 3). No studies identified negative or adverse impacts 
of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.

Sleep  interference. Three  studies  showed  improve-
ment in sleep interference, two RCTs reporting statistically 
significant  improvements.49,54  One  study  did  not  show 
any improvements with sleep interference post interven-
tion.49

Psychological flexibility. Nine studies reported improve-
ments  in  psychological  flexibility,  though  only  two  RCTs 
reported  statistically  significant  improvements.53,66  The 
remaining studies showed improvements that were not sig-
nificant: pre/post study designs (n = 5)46,52,57,61,62 and RCTs 
(n = 3).48,55,63  The  qualitative  study  reported  comments  of 
participants showing increased psychological flexibility.68

Anxiety. All of the studies which measured anxiety 
showed improvements (n = 6), although only two RCTs 
improvements.53,54 
reported  statistically  significant 
The  other  studies  showed  improvements  that  were 
not  significant,  pre/post  designs  (n = 2)16,52  and  RCTs 
(n=2).63,66

Depression. All of the studies (n = 6) which measured 
depression showed improvements, only two RCTs showed 
statistically  significant  improvements.53,54  Two  pre/post 
studies16,52,  two  RCTs63,66  showed  improvements  that 
were not significant.

Distress. Six studies showed improvements in distress, 
with three RCTs showing statistically significant improve-
ments53,54,60, three pre/post studies showing not statisti-
cally significant improvements.52,57,62

Valued  living. Six  studies  showed  improvements  in 
valued  living  post  intervention,46,52,60,63,66  although  only 
one RCT showed statistically significant improvements.66 
Two pre/post studies46,52, two  RCTs  showed non  statisti-
cally  significant  improvements.60,63  The  qualitative  study 
showed  that  a  number  of  participants  post  intervention 
had  an  increased  awareness  of  values  in  life  and  were 
living  in  accordance  with  personal  values.68  One  study 
showed no improvements in valued living post interven-
tion.55

Pain interference. Only two of five of the studies exam-
ining pain interference showed improvements (40%), one 
pre/post  study52  and  one  RCT16  showed  improvements 
that were not significant. Three studies found no change; 
two RCTs48,49, one pre/post study.46

Fatigue  interference. Four  studies  reported  improve-
ments  in  fatigue  interference,  of  these  only  one  RCT 
improvements.49  The 
showed  statistically  significant 
remaining  three  studies,  two  RCTs54,55,  one  pre/post 
design52  described  improvements  that  were  not  statisti-
cally significant.

Quality  of  life. Three  studies  showed  improvements 
in quality of life add53,55,57, one study reported significant 
improvements.53 and one pre/post study57 and one RCT55 
described  improvements  that  were  not  significant.  One 
pre/post study showed minimal change to quality of life 
post intervention.61

Other  outcome  measures. Two  studies  described 
improvements  in  grief  and  anticipatory  grief  post  inter-
vention,46,63 though these were not statistically significant, 
and one was a PhD study involving only two participants. 
One pre/post study reported improvements that were not 
significant in mindfulness post intervention, but this was 
not statistically significant.62

There  was  heterogeneity 

in  outcome  measures 
throughout  the  studies,  many  outcome  measures  were 
only reported in one study (Supplemental File: Figure 2). 
Four  studies  described  statistically  significant  improve-
ments  in  outcomes  post  intervention;  emotional  con-
trol,53 
thought  suppression,53  post-traumatic  stress 
symptoms66 and worry.54

Qualitative  evidence  exploring  the  effectiveness  of 
Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  showed  that  car-
egivers found the intervention helped them to cope with 
negative emotions and thoughts.68 Also, the intervention 
helped  the  caregivers  become  more  aware  of  their  per-
sonal values.68 The caregivers expressed ambivalent feel-
ings  towards  the  peer  support  and  content  of  feedback 
from the counsellor.

Findings from observational studies (n=11). Eleven obser-
vational papers were identified.45,47,50,51,56,58,59,64,65,67,69 The 
most  frequently  assessed  outcomes  were  acceptance 
(n = 6)45,47,50,58,64,65  and  valued 
living47,50,51,64,67,69  both 
assessed in six studies (see Table 5).

Acceptance. Several papers found that higher accept-
ance was associated with statistically significant improve-
ments  in  anticipatory  grief,64,65  anxiety,65  depression,65 
physical function58 and low levels of burnout and stress.56 
There  was  also  an  association  between  higher  accept-
ance scores and greater levels of work engagement, job 
satisfaction  and  wellbeing  in  staff.56  A  cross-sectional 
questionnaire  study  of  people  approaching  end  of  life 
in  an  inpatient  palliative  care  unit  reported  that  accept-
ance  was  a  significant  predictor  of  reduced  anticipatory 
grief over and above depression and anxiety, suggesting 
that acceptance-based interventions could play an impor-
tant role in ameliorating suffering relating to anticipatory

grief.65  A  doctoral  thesis  reported  that  therapists  used 
acceptance and commitment therapy and positive adjust-
ment  in  their  practice  for  patients  following  bereave-
ment.59

Valued living. Statistically significant interactions were 
found between mindfulness, committed action and self-
care  behaviours.69  One  study  found  that  avoidance  and 
low  importance  of  values  in  bereaved  populations  was 
correlated with bereavement difficulties.51 Unexpectedly, 
in one study higher scores of valued action were signifi-
cantly correlated with higher scores of physical pain and 
death attitudes.67

Grief  and  anticipatory  grief. Higher  acceptance  was 
statistically  significantly  associated  with  lower  anticipa-
tory grief.65 Also, increased acceptance and valued living 
was  statistically  significantly  associated  with  improve-
ments in adjustment to loss amongst bereaved university 
students.64

Discussion

This  is  the  first  review  to  comprehensively  map  the  evi-
dence on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for peo-
ple with an advanced progressive illness and their formal 
and informal caregivers. To date, most research has been 
conducted in the U.S, most studies have involved patients, 
and most interventions have been community-based, and 
delivered in-person or via telephone. Our findings suggest 
that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is acceptable 
to people with an advanced progressive illness and those 
involved in their care. Across all studies, Acceptance and 
Commitment Therapy interventions were feasible to eval-
uate,  at  least  in  the  short  term.  Nearly  all  intervention 
studies  described  improvements  in  distress,  anxiety, 
depression,  and  psychological  flexibility,  though  not  all 
improvements were statistically significant, often due to 
underpowered studies. No negative impacts of Acceptance 
and Commitment Therapy were reported in any interven-
tion  study.  Observational  studies  described  significant 
associations between core Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy  processes  such  as  acceptance  and  key  psycho-
logical outcomes including adjustment to loss.

Overall,  recruitment  to  Acceptance  and  Commitment 
Therapy intervention studies generally appeared feasible, 
with most studies reporting recruitment rates of at least 
one-third  of  those  eligible.  Challenges  associated  with 
recruitment and retention of participants in palliative care 
studies are widely recognised, with factors such as dete-
riorating  health,  feelings  of  being  overwhelmed,  and 
fatigue, all contributing to low levels of recruitment and 
retention.71,72  Gatekeeping  is  also  an  issue  with  ‘fear  of 
burdening vulnerable patients’ the most reported reason 
for gatekeeping among healthcare professionals.73 In this 

scoping review, recruitment was lowest in an intervention 
study  recruiting  participants  during  the  period  in  which 
they  had  just  been  referred  for  hospice  care57  –  a  time 
during  which  patients  can  feel  heightened  levels  of  dis-
tress, while professionals may be more likely to gatekeep 
as they focus on clinical care. In contrast, recruitment was 
highest where the intervention took place alongside rou-
tine  appointments,  minimising  the  need  to  travel  and 
reducing overall research burden.53 Strategies to improve 
recruitment include having research staff on-site, limiting 
burden  by  running  intervention  alongside  routine  care, 
offering flexibility around location and timing of participa-
tion,  engaging  patient  representatives  in  the  design  of 
recruitment  strategies,  and  working  closely  with  health-
care  professionals  and  leaders  to  promote  research 
engagement.71–73

support 

This review provides strong evidence that Acceptance 
and Commitment Therapy is acceptable in palliative care 
settings.  In  most  intervention  studies,  attrition  was  low 
during intervention delivery, with most studies reporting 
retention  rates  of  75%  or  higher.  Evidence  regarding 
acceptability  resonates  with  findings  from  a  recent  UK 
national survey which reported that 41% of hospice psy-
chological 
teams  use  Acceptance  and 
Commitment Therapy to support patients and families.41 
This suggests that even though evidence is still emerging, 
practitioners find Acceptance and Commitment Therapy a 
valuable  psychological  approach  in  palliative  care.  This 
could be due to its logical fit with the needs of patients 
with advanced progressive illness, or the strength of evi-
dence for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in other 
health populations, or it could be due to the finding that 
training  in  Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  has 
benefits  for  both  therapeutic  skills  and  for  personal 
wellbeing.74–76

We  found  preliminary  evidence  that  Acceptance  and 
Commitment  Therapy  is  effective  in  improving  key  psy-
chological  outcomes  for  patients,  carers  and  palliative 
care  staff.  Following  Acceptance  and  Commitment 
Therapy,  participants  in  most  studies  reported  improve-
ments  in  psychological  flexibility,46,52,53,55,57,61–63,66,68  anxi-
ety,16,52–54,63,66 
and  depression.16,52–54,63,66  Although 
preliminary,  these  findings  reflect  the  benefits  of 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy reported for other 
populations,  including  people  with  mental  health  prob-
lems  and  chronic  pain.26,77  Evidence  for  benefits  of 
Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  on  physical  out-
comes such as fatigue, sleep and pain was limited. Weak 
effects for pain interference were found, with half of the 
papers  assessing  pain  showed  no  change  post  interven-
tion.16,48,49 Findings in palliative care populations broadly 
align  with  findings  from  a  review  of  Acceptance  and 
Commitment Therapy for chronic pain, which found sig-
nificant effects of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy 
on  pain  acceptance,  but  no  impact  on  pain  severity.77

Overall, given the small sample sizes, focus on feasibility 
and acceptability over efficacy and effectiveness in many 
studies,  and  use  of  pre-post  designs,  further  research 
examining 
the  effectiveness  of  Acceptance  and 
Commitment  Therapy  on  key  psychological  and  physical 
outcomes in palliative care populations is warranted.

There is existing evidence that acceptance is an impor-
tant element for a good death and a facilitator in the pro-
vision  of  end-of-life  care.78  Findings  from  observational 
studies  in  this  scoping  review  supports  the  view  that 
acceptance is a key process in palliative care. Acceptance 
was  associated  with  improved  anxiety,65  depression,65 
death  acceptance,64  lower  anticipatory  grief64,65  and 
mobility.58 Greater acceptance was also linked with higher 
levels of work engagement, job satisfaction and wellbeing 
in palliative care staff.56 In Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy,  acceptance  describes  a  willingness  to  open-up 
and make room for difficult thoughts and emotions, when 
this  helps  the  person  accomplish  something  they  care 
about.  It  is  viewed  as  an  active  choice  that  involves 
decreasing the effort that one exerts to control or regu-
late  inner  experience,  and  actively  experience  things  as 
they are.52–54,57,60,62 For instance, acceptance may involve 
a willingness to experience difficult thoughts and feelings 
associated with an advanced progressive illness in the ser-
vice of communicating preferences regarding future care 
and  plans.  This  contrasts  with  experiential  avoidance 
which might involve attempts to reduce or avoid unwanted 
inner experiences when doing so has a negative impact on 
functioning, or may get in the way of doing what is impor-
tant  and  most  valued.  Promoting  acceptance  amongst 
people  with  an  advanced  progressive  illness,  and  their 
carers,  may  support  better  communication  and  clarity 
around future care preferences. Recent evidence from a 
feasibility study points to the acceptability of Acceptance 
and Commitment Therapy to address advance care plan-
ning needs of depressed and anxious adults with advanced 
cancer.16  Further  research  on  this  relationship 
is 
warranted

In this scoping review, short or flexibly delivered inter-
ventions  resulted  in  greater  participant  retention.16,48,49 
Brief  psychosocial  interventions  have  been  found  to  be 
effective  in  improving  clinically  relevant  outcomes  for 
people receiving palliative care.38,79 Illness stage is also an 
important  consideration,  with  shorter,  flexible  interven-
tion formats being essential for those using hospice ser-
vices  and  closer  to  the  end  of  life.  We  identified  two 
hospice-based interventions studies in this review. In one 
study,  4  of  10  participants  recruited  died  during  the 
study57 in the other, only 8 of 20 (40%) allocated to the 
8-week intervention condition completed the 1.5 month 
follow-up due to death, feeling too unwell, feeling over-
burdened  and  related  reasons.60  Given  deteriorating 
physical health, earlier intervention is important for peo-
ple with an advanced progressive illness, and where this is 

not feasible, brief and flexible interventions, which do not 
overburden the person, need to be prioritised.

Strengths and limitations

is  the  first  comprehensive  review  focused  on 
This 
Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  in  palliative  care 
settings,  synthesising  evidence  for  people  with  any 
advanced  progressive  illness,  their  caregivers,  and  staff 
involved  in  their  care.  This  review,  which  draws  on  data 
from 26 research studies, extends the findings from a sys-
tematic  review  in  this  area,  which  summarised  findings 
from six studies involving people with advanced cancer.38 
Given the rapid growth in Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy  as  an  effective  psychological  intervention  for 
people with a range of conditions,29 this review is timely.

A number of limitations are noted. First, a high degree 
of  heterogeneity  in  relation  to  study  populations,  aims, 
intervention designs and format made some comparisons 
difficult. Secondly, the lack of control group in most stud-
ies limited the strength of evidence, such that only pre-
liminary  evidence  on  effectiveness  could  be  described. 
Thirdly,  as  most  intervention  studies  focused  on  people 
with  advanced  cancer,  conclusions  regarding  the  use  of 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for other popula-
tions was limited. As this was a scoping review, we focused 
on mapping the broad field rather than critically apprais-
ing  papers,  and  quality  appraisal  was  not  undertaken. 
Choices  regarding  study  inclusion  were  pragmatic,  and 
papers  in  languages  other  than  English  were  excluded; 
therefore, findings may be limited in the extent to which 
they apply across cultures.

Directions for future research

Of  the  26  studies  reviewed,  only  three  focused  on 
Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  for  bereavement 
support.  The  dearth  of  evidence  on  Acceptance  and 
Commitment Therapy for bereavement was also recently 
noted  in  a  systematic  review  on  managing  grief,  which 
only identified two studies.40 Future research is needed to 
explore  the  acceptability  and  value  of  Acceptance  and 
Commitment  Therapy  for  people  who  have  been 
bereaved.  Similarly,  only  two  studies  involving  palliative 
care  staff  were  identified,45,56  however  given  the  effec-
tiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in pro-
moting wellbeing in other occupational settings,37 further 
research examining Acceptance and Commitment Therapy 
for  palliative  care  staff  wellbeing  is  warranted.  Most 
patient studies involved people with cancer, so research 
involving people with other advanced progressive or life-
limiting illnesses is needed.

Interventions need to be scalable and cost-effective to 
implement,  so  future  feasibility  testing  of  interventions 
needs  to  incorporate  preliminary  economic  evaluation. 

Gibson Watt et al.

Similarly,  models  of  intervention  delivery  which  rely  on 
highly  specialist  staff  such  as  clinical  psychologists  for 
delivery  may  not  be  scalable,  so  research  is  needed  to 
adapt interventions so that Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy can be delivered by a wider range of profession-
als.  There  is  now  emerging  evidence  for  the  value  of 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy delivered online in 
other settings,26 so given the potential for online interven-
tions to increase access to psychological support, future 
evaluation  of  online  Acceptance  and  Commitment 
Therapy for palliative care is timely. Greater consideration 
of the acceptability and effectiveness of Acceptance and 
Commitment  Therapy  for  diverse  groups  and  cultures  is 
also recommended.

In terms of research design, efficacy, effectiveness and 
implementation  studies  involving  patients  and  carers 
need  to  be  prioritised.  Few  full-scale  evaluations  of 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to support patient, 
carers and staff wellbeing in palliative care settings have 
been  conducted,  so  evidence  regarding  effectiveness 
remains  uncertain.  Mixed  method  evaluation  studies, 
with  larger  sample  sizes  and  comparison  conditions  are 
needed. Hybrid effectiveness-implementation studies are 
also recommended to explore how delivery of the inter-
vention  can  be  scaled  up,  and  delivered  in  health  and 
social care contexts.80,81

Implications for clinical practice

Whilst this field of research and practice is still early in its 
development,  practitioners  can  be  reassured  that 
Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  has  a  relatively 
robust  evidence  base  in  many  related  areas  of  practice, 
such as organisational stress, caregiver stress, chronic and 
mental  ill  health.  This  review  provides  evidence  that 
Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  interventions  for 
people with advanced progressive illness are likely to be 
acceptable, and feasible to deliver, with preliminary evi-
dence  of  efficacy.  There  is  also  evidence  from  pre-trial 
cross-sectional studies that the processes targetted in the 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy model are related 
to  wellbeing  in  people  with  advanced  illness  and  there-
fore are logical intervention targets. Given the early stage 
of development of this field, it may be valuable for clini-
cians to routinely evaluate practice and identify unusual 
or boundary cases that could be written up as case studies 
to inform intervention development. Given the heteroge-
neity of delivery seen in this review, clinicians should be 
encouraged to explore and evaluate delivery methods in 
routine practice, in parallel with further research. In par-
ticular,  training  non  psychologists  /  non  psychotherapist 
to  deliver  elements  of  Acceptance  and  Commitment 
Therapy may be useful to address the relative scarcity of 
those professional groups, relative to others.

Conclusion

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is acceptable and 
feasible to deliver in palliative care settings. There is pre-
liminary  evidence  that  Acceptance  and  Commitment 
improves  anxiety,  depression  and  distress 
Therapy 
amongst those with advanced progressive illness, as well 
as  their  caregivers.  Full  scale  mixed  method  evaluation 
studies involving larger samples and a comparison group 
are  now  needed  to  demonstrate  efficacy,  effectiveness 
and cost-effectiveness. Further intervention development 
and feasibility studies involving staff and bereaved carer 
populations are warranted.
