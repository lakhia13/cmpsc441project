Design, Setting, and Participants—Ancillary observational analysis of a 4-year randomized 
controlled trial (baseline visit, August 2001–April 2004; last follow-up, April 2008) comparing an 
intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) with a diabetes support and education control condition 
(DSE) among 4503 US adults with body mass index of 25 or higher and type 2 diabetes.

Interventions—Participants were randomly assigned to receive the ILI, which included weekly 
group and individual counseling in the first 6 months followed by 3 sessions per month for the 
second 6 months and twice-monthly contact and regular refresher group series and campaigns in 
years 2 to 4 (n=2241) or the DSE, which was an offer of 3 group sessions per year on diet, 
physical activity, and social support (n=2262).

Main Outcome Measures—Partial or complete remission of diabetes, defined as transition 
from meeting diabetes criteria to a prediabetes or nondiabetic level of glycemia (fasting plasma 
glucose <126 mg/dL and hemoglobin A1c <6.5% with no antihyperglycemic medication).

Results—Intensive lifestyle intervention participants lost significantly more weight than DSE 
participants at year 1 (net difference, −7.9%; 95% CI, −8.3% to −7.6%) and at year 4 (−3.9%; 
95% CI, −4.4% to −3.5%) and had greater fitness increases at year 1 (net difference, 15.4%; 95% 
CI, 13.7%–17.0%) and at year 4 (6.4%; 95% CI, 4.7%–8.1%) (P<.001 for each). The ILI group 
was significantly more likely to experience any remission (partial or complete), with prevalences 
of 11.5% (95% CI, 10.1%–12.8%) during the first year and 7.3% (95% CI, 6.2%–8.4%) at year 4, 
compared with 2.0% for the DSE group at both time points (95% CIs, 1.4%–2.6% at year 1 and 
1.5%–2.7% at year 4) (P<.001 for each). Among ILI participants, 9.2% (95% CI, 7.9%–10.4%), 
6.4% (95% CI, 5.3%–7.4%), and 3.5% (95% CI, 2.7%–4.3%) had continuous, sustained remission 
for at least 2, at least 3, and 4 years, respectively, compared with less than 2% of DSE participants 
(1.7% [95% CI, 1.2%–2.3%] for at least 2 years; 1.3% [95% CI, 0.8%–1.7%] for at least 3 years; 
and 0.5% [95% CI, 0.2%–0.8%] for 4 years).

Conclusions—In these exploratory analyses of overweight adults, an intensive lifestyle 
intervention was associated with a greater likelihood of partial remission of type 2 diabetes 
compared with diabetes support and education. However, the absolute remission rates were 
modest.

Trial Registration—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00017953

DIABETES TRADITIONALLY HAS been considered a progressive, incurable condition 
wherein the best case scenario after diagnosis is tight metabolic and risk factor management 
to forestall vascular and neuropathic complications.1 This notion that type 2 diabetes is 
irreversible is supported by the strong association with genetics and family history, the high 
prevalence of microvascular complications, and the loss of beta cell mass and function 
frequently already present at diagnosis.2,3 Despite these observations, 16% of US adults who 
report a previous diabetes diagnosis take no hypoglycemic medications, and studies of 
bariatric surgery suggest that many diabetes cases among obese patients can indeed 
resolve.4–8 Patients diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes frequently ask their physicians 
whether their condition is reversible, and some physicians may provide hopeful advice that 
lifestyle change can normalize glucose levels. Ambiguity around the concept of reversibility 
led to a 2009 American Diabetes Association consensus statement that defined partial 
remission as hyperglycemia below the diagnostic level for diabetes in the absence of

antihyperglycemic medications and defined complete remission as a return to normal 
glucose levels in the absence of antihyperglycemic therapy.9 However, the rate of remission 
of type 2 diabetes that may be achieved using nonsurgical approaches has not been reported.

The Look AHEAD (Action for Health for Diabetes) study is perhaps the largest randomized 
controlled trial of an intensive lifestyle intervention among adults with type 2 diabetes to 
date.10 Although designed principally to examine the effect of weight loss on cardiovascular 
disease incidence, it is also a unique opportunity to examine the effect on control and 
progression of diabetes mellitus. We conducted an ancillary analysis of the Look AHEAD 
cohort to determine the association of an intensive lifestyle intervention with frequency of 
partial and complete remission of type 2 diabetes.

METHODS

Study Design, Sample, and Inclusion Criteria

Intervention

Look AHEAD recruited 5145 overweight adults aged 45 to 76 years with type 2 diabetes at 
16 US research centers and randomized them to either an intensive lifestyle-based weight 
loss intervention (ILI) or a diabetes support and education intervention (DSE).10–12 Yearly 
clinic visits were conducted over 4 years to assess health status, including glycemic status. 
Baseline eligibility criteria required a body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in 
kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 25 or higher (≥27 among those receiving 
insulin). Look AHEAD excluded participants with particularly high hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c) levels (>11%), blood pressure (>160 mm Hg systolic or >100 mm Hg diastolic), or 
plasma triglyceride levels (>600 mg/dL). Participants were also excluded if they were 
unable to perform a maximal graded exercise test or complete 2 weeks of diet and activity 
self-monitoring. All participants signed a consent form approved by their local institutional 
review board.

Details of the intervention have been described previously.10–12 In short, the ILI included 
weekly group and individual counseling in the first 6 months, followed by 3 sessions per 
month for the second 6 months and twice-monthly contact and regular refresher group series 
and campaigns in years 2 to 4. The ILI aimed to reduce total caloric intake to 1200 to 1800 
kcal/d through reductions in total and saturated fat intake and by increasing physical activity 
levels to a goal of 175 min/wk. Liquid meal replacements were provided to assist dietary 
goals. Participants in the DSE were offered 3 group sessions each year focusing on diet, 
physical activity, and social support. Medical care was provided by the participant’s 
physician independent of the Look AHEAD study. During periods of weight loss, ILI 
participants who were taking insulin, sulfonylureas, repaglinide, or nateglinide were asked 
to provide blood glucose measurement records so that Look AHEAD medical staff could 
determine if reductions in diabetes medications were needed to reduce their risk of 
hypoglycemia.

Assessments

Page 4

Self-reported behavioral and demographic risk factors along with measured height, weight, 
and fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c were assessed at a baseline clinic visit (August 2001–
April 2004) and yearly thereafter, with the fourth visit occurring between August 2005 and 
April 2008. Prescription medications were recorded by trained study technicians at study 
visits. A maximal graded exercise test was administered at baseline and a sub-maximal 
exercise test at years 1 and 4. Changes in fitness were computed as the difference between 
estimated metabolic equivalents at the point that the participants achieved 80% of age-
predicted maximal heart rate or a rating of perceived exertion of at least 16 (corresponding 
to a rating between “hard” and “very hard”) at baseline and at the subsequent assessment.

For these analyses, diabetes was defined as taking diabetes medications or having a fasting 
plasma glucose level of at least 126 mg/dL or HbA1c of at least 6.5%. (To convert fasting 
plasma glucose to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555.) Partial remission of diabetes was defined as 
a transition from meeting diabetes criteria to a prediabetes level of glycemia (ie, fasting 
plasma glucose level of 100–126 mg/dL and HbA1c of 5.7%–6.5%) with no 
antihyperglycemic medication. Complete remission was defined as transition from diabetes 
criteria to full normalization of glucose (fasting plasma glucose level <100 mg/dL and 
HbA1c <5.7%) with no antihyperglycemic medication.

Statistical Analyses

Descriptive statistics compared the characteristics of the ILI and DSE groups. Primary 
analyses compared the yearly prevalence of any remission (partial or complete remission) 
between participants in the ILI and DSE groups and estimated the prevalence of continuous, 
sustained remission for at least 2, at least 3, or 4 years. We constructed first-order binary 
Markov transition models to estimate the yearly transition probabilities in and out of 
diabetes status. We used multiple imputation to account for missing data elements at year 1 
(n=176 [3.9%]), year 2 (n=312 [6.9%]), year 3 (n=335 [7.4%]), and year 4 (n=405 [9.1%]). 
Imputation of the binary outcome of any remission was conducted using a propensity score 
approach that accounted for the longitudinal nature of the data.13 Imputations were 
performed for the DSE and ILI groups separately. The results from 100 imputed data sets 
were combined to obtain prevalence estimates for yearly remission as well as continuous 
sustained remission that accounted for both between-and within-imputation variability.

As a post hoc analysis based on the available cases (ie, without imputation), we examined 
the multivariate association of several predetermined demographic factors (age, sex, race/
ethnicity, education), health status factors (history of cardiovascular disease, 
antihypertensive use, insulin use), baseline risk factors (BMI, HbA1c, fitness), and 2 
intervention response variables (1-year weight change, fitness change) with any remission. 
Since descriptive analyses indicated that most cases of remission occurred between baseline 
and the year 1 visit and few occurred thereafter, we estimated the probabilities and odds 
ratios separately for cases of remission occurring in the first year and for those occurring 
between the first and fourth years. We also tested for interactions with intervention group 
and present the absolute probability of remission according to these variables for the full 
sample and by intervention group. All analyses were performed using SAS software, version

9.3 (SAS Institute Inc). A 2-sided P<.05 was considered statistically significant. Since 
diabetes remission was not a prespecified outcome of Look AHEAD, these analyses were 
exploratory in nature and no adjustment for multiple testing was applied.

RESULTS

From the original sample of 5145 adults randomized to Look AHEAD, we excluded 355 
individuals (6.9%; n=194 ILI and n=161 DSE) who had fasting glucose levels of less than 
126 mg/dL and HbA1c levels of less than 6.5% while taking no diabetes medications 
because they met our definition for non-diabetes at baseline (FIGURE 1). We also excluded 
287 participants (5.6%; n=135 ILI and n=152 DSE) who were missing relevant outcome 
data at all follow-up visits or who underwent bariatric surgery, leaving an analytic sample of 
4503 adults (n=2241 in the ILI group and n = 2262 in the DSE group) (Figure 1). 
Participants excluded because of this combination of factors tended to be younger and more 
obese and had lower fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels, yet were less likely to be 
taking diabetes or hypertension medications than the primary analytic sample (eTable 1; 
http://www.jama.com). The Look AHEAD study sample was predominantly middle-aged or 
older (mean age, 59 years) and of diverse race/ethnicity, education level, and medication 
status (TABLE 1). Median time since diagnosis was 5 years and the study sample was 
notably obese at baseline, with a mean BMI of 35.8.

Participants in the ILI group lost significantly more weight than DSE participants at year 1 
(−8.6% [95% CI, −8.9% to −8.4%] vs −0.7% [95% CI, −0.9% to −0.4%]) and at year 4 
(−4.7% [95% CI, −5.0% to 4.4%] vs −0.8% [95% CI, −1.1% to −0.5%]) (P<.001 for each) 
and had greater increases in fitness at both year 1 (20.6% [95% CI, 19.5%–21.8%] vs 5.3% 
[95% CI, 4.1%–6.4%]) and year 4 (4.9% [95% CI, 3.7%–6.1%] vs 1.5% [95% CI, −2.8% to 
−0.3%]) (P<.001 for each). The prevalence of complete remission (ie, glucose normalization 
without medication) was more common in the ILI group than in the DSE group across all 
years of the study (prevalence ratio, 6.6; 95% CI, 3.3–13.3; P<.001). However, the absolute 
prevalence was low, ranging from 1.3% (95% CI, 0.9%–1.8%) for ILI vs 0.1% (95% CI, 
0%–0.2%) for DSE (P<.001) in year 1 to 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3%–1.0%) for ILI vs 0.2% (95% 
CI, 0%–0.4%) for DSE in year 4.

In analyses based on multiple imputation, ILI participants were significantly more likely to 
experience any remission (partial or complete), with a prevalence of 11.5% (95% CI, 
10.1%–12.8%) during the first year, decreasing to 7.3% (95% CI, 6.2%–8.4%) during year 
4, compared with 2.0% (95% CIs, 1.4%–2.6% at year 1 and 1.5%–2.7% at year 4) in the 
DSE group at both time points (FIGURE 2) (P<.001 for each year). Accordingly, ratios of 
the prevalence of remission for ILI vs DSE ranged from 5.8 (95% CI, 4.2–7.9) in year 1 to 
3.4 (95% CI, 2.5–4.8) in year 4. The results from the complete case analyses were similar 
(Figure 2).

Among those who had a remission, about one-third in the ILI group returned to a clinical 
diabetes status each year (33.1% [95% CI, 27.4%–39.3%] in year 2; 33.8% [95% CI, 
27.9%–40.2%] in year 3; and 31.6% [95% CI, 25.3%–38.6%] in year 4) and close to half of 
those in the DSE group returned to a clinical diabetes status (52.4% [95% CI, 42.2%–

62.3%] in year 2; 45.9% [95% CI, 35.6%–56.6%] in year 3; and 43.8% [95% CI, 32.9%–
55.4%] in year 4).

The ILI group was significantly more likely to have continuous, sustained remission 
(FIGURE 3), as 9.2% (95% CI, 7.9%–10.4%) experienced at least a 2-year remission (vs for 
DSE, 1.7%; 95% CI, 1.2%–2.3%; P<.001) at some point during follow-up, 6.4% (95% CI, 
5.7%–7.4%) had at least a 3-year remission (vs DSE, 1.3%; 95% CI, 0.8%–1.7%), and 3.5% 
(95% CI, 2.7%–4.3%) had a continuous 4-year remission (vs DSE, 0.5%; 95% CI, 0.2%–
0.8%; P = .02) (Figure 3). The results from the complete case analyses were similar (Figure 
3).

In both univariate and multivariable analyses (based on available case analyses), any 
remission during the first year was significantly associated with fewer years since diabetes 
diagnosis, low BMI, low baseline HbA1c, not taking insulin, and greater 1-year weight loss 
(P<.001) (TABLE 2). A strong fitness improvement was also significantly associated with 
1-year remission in univariate analyses (P<.001), but this association was attenuated in 
multivariate analyses controlling for weight change and all the remaining factors. There 
were no significant interactions between any of these demographic and health status 
predictors and intervention condition on their effect on any remission, indicating that the 
association of the ILI with remission was generally consistent across different strata. The 
highest probabilities of 1-year remission occurred among intervention participants with less 
than a 2-year history of diabetes (21.2%; 95% CI, 18.0%–24.7%), more than 6.5% weight 
loss (16.4%; 95% CI, 14.5%–18.6%) or fitness improvements (15.6%; 95% CI, 13.3%–
18.1%), low initial HbA1c values (17.1%; 95% CI, 14.4%–20.3%), and not taking 
antihypertensive medications (15.2%; 95% CI, 12.3%–18.6%).

A similar set of predictors (<2-year duration of diabetes, a lower baseline HbA1c, large first-
year weight loss, and a large increase in fitness) was also associated with increased longer-
term remission (years 2–4). However, the absolute prevalence of remission through years 2 
to 4 was relatively rare; even among those with fewer than 2 years since diagnosis, average 
remission was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.8%–4.7%) for ILI compared with 1.9% (95% CI, 1.4%–
2.6%) among DSE participants (eTable 2).

COMMENT

The increasing worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes, along with its wide-ranging 
complications, has led to hopes that the disease can be reversed or prevented.14,15 These 
analyses of more than 4500 overweight adults with type 2 diabetes confirm that complete 
remission associated with an intensive lifestyle intervention, when defined by glucose 
normalization without need for drugs, is rare. However, partial remission, defined as a 
transition to prediabetic or normal glucose levels without drug treatment for a specific 
period, is an obtainable goal for some patients with type 2 diabetes. As many as 11.5% of 
lifestyle intervention participants had partial or complete remission within the first year of 
intervention and 7% had partial or complete remission after 4 years; these rates were 3 to 6 
times those of participants in the DSE condition. Perhaps more important, rates of any 
remission were notably higher (15%–21%) among persons with substantial weight loss or

fitness change, shorter duration of extant diabetes, or a lower HbA1c level at entry and those 
not using insulin.

The ability to eliminate all diabetes medications while maintaining subdiabetic levels of 
fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels should considerably reduce medication costs, 
related adverse effects, risks of hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemic symptoms.16,17 Prior 
studies of medication-based therapy have shown that the reductions in HbA1c and fasting 
glucose, if sustained, are likely to considerably reduce risks of microvascular 
complications.18,19 Moreover, the longer-term effect could also be enhanced if the 
improvements in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and systolic blood 
pressure levels observed in Look AHEAD also extend to a reduction in vascular 
complications.20 Of note, however, in October 2012, after 8 to 11 years of participant 
follow-up, the Look AHEAD intervention was stopped by the study sponsor when it was 
determined that the ILI did not decrease the occurrence of cardiovascular events, the 
primary trial outcome relative to the DSE group.21 Neither these results nor those of the 
other pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes of Look AHEAD have been published 
yet.

The absolute difference in rates of remission observed between the ILI and DSE (9.5 
percentage points at year 1; 5.3 percentage points at year 4) were somewhat less than the 
rate differences generally observed in diabetes prevention studies,22 as the Finnish and US 
prevention studies observed differences in cumulative incidence between intervention and 
control participants of 12 to 15 percentage points at 3 to 4 years.22–24 Similarly, a recent 
analysis of the US Diabetes Prevention Program found rates of 1-time remission from 
impaired glucose tolerance to normal glucose levels of 23% and 9% for intervention and 
control groups, or a 14-percentage-point difference.25 These findings, combined with our 
observations that remission was more common among adults with fewer years of diagnosed 
diabetes and lower initial HbA1c values, provide indirect evidence that intervention earlier in 
the natural history of diabetes leads to better outcomes, perhaps by preserving beta cell 
function and mass in the face of declining insulin action.3 This may influence the ongoing 
debate about population screening for prediabetes and diabetes, which remains controversial 
because of the lack of explicit evidence that earlier identification leads to better health 
outcomes.26,27

Studies of bariatric surgery have observed substantially larger weight loss and rates of 
partial and complete remission than Look AHEAD,6,7,28 ranging from 27% to 97% 
depending on the study, surgical approach, and follow-up period. However, long-term 
benefits on comorbidity have still not been clarified, and bariatric surgery is more invasive 
and, thus, is unlikely to be a first choice for the majority of people with type 2 diabetes.5–8 
Previous studies of both lifestyle and pharmacologic-based interventions have shown 
significant reductions in HbA1c levels and/or use of antidiabetic medications,29–32 but we 
are not aware of nonsurgical studies that have examined remission rates based on a 
combination of medication use and levels of glycemia.

The appropriate definition of diabetes remission remains an area of ambiguity and debate.9 
For these analyses, we adopted the American Diabetes Association’s definition,

achievement of glycemia below the diabetic range in the absence of active pharmacological 
treatment or surgical therapy. It could be argued, however, that remission according to 
glycemic and pharmacologic criteria does not address the underlying health of beta cell 
function and insulin action and, thus, cannot be used to define a cure for diabetes. Weight 
regain and failure to maintain changes in diet and physical activity may lead to a 
deterioration of glycemic control and recurrence of diabetes. We could not fully assess the 
length of remission in this report because our analyses were limited to 4 years of follow-up.

Our analyses were not conducted using a pure intention-to-treat approach, as participants 
who underwent bariatric surgery after randomization, had normal glucose levels at baseline, 
or were missing data were excluded from the analyses. This was a deliberate analytic 
decision based on the desire to estimate the absolute frequency of diabetes remission that 
could be attributed to lifestyle intervention. Including even a relatively small number of 
surgery cases could skew findings because of the high documented frequency of diabetes 
remission following surgery. This exclusion of surgery cases led to an analytic sample that 
was slightly older, was more likely to be male, and had worse glycemic control than the 
broader Look AHEAD study population.

There are additional limitations to our analyses. First, remission was not one of the intended 
primary objectives of the Look AHEAD study, making these analyses exploratory in nature. 
We did not adjust our P values for multiple comparisons, which could increase the type 1 
error rate. However, we found P<.001 for all of our main comparisons of remission rates, 
indicating our primary conclusions are robust. Second, the study population was not ideal 
for this analysis because half of the sample had at least 5 years of diabetes duration, 19% 
were using insulin, and many had high HbA1c values. These factors would likely make our 
findings an underestimate of the frequency of remission that may be achieved in a group of 
individuals identified earlier in their disease progression. Alternatively, Look AHEAD used 
a more intensive intervention than that commonly used in clinical and community settings, 
which may overestimate the effect. Third, this study had no assessment of post–glucose 
challenge beta cell function or insulin action to determine the mechanisms whereby lifestyle 
intervention may lead toward remission or normalization of glycemic level. This prevented 
us from evaluating the impact of the intervention on insulin resistance and also means that 
some of those who were classified as having remission would likely still be classified as 
having diabetes if the study had included an oral glucose tolerance test. Finally, we cannot 
rule out the possibility that the physicians of ILI participants were more likely to modify 
medications than the physicians of DSE participants or, alternatively, physicians were 
resistant to stopping medications such as metformin even if the glycemic levels of their 
patients were normal.

In spite of these limitations, this is the largest study to our knowledge to examine the 
association of a lifestyle intervention with type 2 diabetes remission. Our findings suggest 
that an intensive lifestyle intervention may be associated with a partial diabetes remission in 
a subset of patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly those whose diabetes is of short 
duration, who have lower HbA1c levels, and who do not yet require insulin therapy.
