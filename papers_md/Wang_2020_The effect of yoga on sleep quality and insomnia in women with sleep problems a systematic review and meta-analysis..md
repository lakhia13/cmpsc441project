Abstract

Background: To examine the effectiveness and safety of yoga of women with sleep problems by performing a
systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods: Medline/PubMed, ClinicalKey, ScienceDirect, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched
throughout the month of June, 2019. Randomized controlled trials comparing yoga groups with control groups in
women with sleep problems were included. Two reviewers independently evaluated risk of bias by using the risk of
bias tool suggested by the Cochrane Collaboration for programming and conducting systematic reviews and meta-
analyses. The main outcome measure was sleep quality or the severity of insomnia, which was measured using
subjective instruments, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), or objective
instruments such as polysomnography, actigraphy, and safety of the intervention. For each outcome, a standardized
mean difference (SMD) and confidence intervals (CIs) of 95% were determined.

Results: Nineteen studies in this systematic review included 1832 participants. The meta-analysis of the combined
data conducted according to Comprehensive Meta-Analysis showed a significant improvement in sleep (SMD = −
0.327, 95% CI = − 0.506 to − 0.148, P < 0.001). Meta-analyses revealed positive effects of yoga using PSQI scores in 16
randomized control trials (RCTs), compared with the control group in improving sleep quality among women using
PSQI (SMD = − 0.54; 95% CI = − 0.89 to − 0.19; P = 0.003). However, three RCTs revealed no effects of yoga compared
to the control group in reducing insomnia among women using ISI (SMD = − 0.13; 95% CI = − 0.74 to 0.48; P = 0.69).
Seven RCTs revealed no evidence for effects of yoga compared with the control group in improving sleep quality
for women with breast cancer using PSQI (SMD = − 0.15; 95% CI = − 0.31 to 0.01; P = 0.5). Four RCTs revealed no
evidence for the effects of yoga compared with the control group in improving the sleep quality for peri/
postmenopausal women using PSQI (SMD = − 0.31; 95% CI = − 0.95 to 0.33; P = 0.34). Yoga was not associated with
any serious adverse events.

Discussion: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that yoga intervention in women can be
beneficial when compared to non-active control conditions in term of managing sleep problems. The moderator
analyses suggest that participants in the non-breast cancer subgroup and participants in the non-peri/
postmenopausal subgroup were associated with greater benefits, with a direct correlation of total class time with
quality of sleep among other related benefits.

Background
Sleep problems are one of the most common medical
complaints. Lack of sleep is associated with significantly
decreased work performance, impaired daytime function,
and increased health care costs [1]. Sex-based differences
in sleep problems have been widely published and dis-
cussed across sleep articles. Insomnia is approximately
1.41 times more common in women than in men [2].
Female populations at certain stages in their life span
may be more vulnerable to insomnia. In these stages,
hormonal changes associated with hormones, such as
follicle-stimulating hormones (FSHs),
luteinizing hor-
mones (LHs), and progesterone, may play an important
role in influencing women’s sleep construction [3] dur-
ing adolescence [4], pregnancy and postpartum [5] or
menopause [6]. Several behavioral, psychological and
pharmacological treatments are available for insomnia,
however, their efficacy varies considerably. The evidence
of efficacy for cognitive behavior therapy is now well
established in many reviews [7, 8], but availability re-
mains poor. Pharmacotherapy remains the most com-
mon treatment
[9], although hypnotics have been
associated with many side effects, such as drowsiness,
cognitive impairment, dependence, tolerance and poor
long term efficacy [10].

Yoga has been widely adapted in the modern Eastern
and Western hemispheres in a variety of ways. Yoga is
an ancient form of exercise that focuses on strength,
flexibility, and breathing to boost physical, mental and
spiritual health [11]. There are many different styles of
yoga, such as Tibetan, Iyengar, and Hatha Yoga. Some
styles are more vigorous than others, whereas some may
have different areas of emphasis, such as posture or
breathing. The main components of yoga in Europe or
America are mostly associated with physical posture
(Asana) and breathing control (Pranayama) and medita-
tion (Dhyana) [11]. A trial in yoga for persistent fatigue
breast cancer survivors showed yoga is safe and effective
at improving fatigue severity, depressive moods, and
sleep quality [12]. Yoga is also characterized as a mindful
mode of physical activity. Mindfulness, as an important
improves sleep disturbance by
component of yoga,

increasing melatonin levels, reducing hyperarousal, and
addressing stress related cardiac and respiratory abnor-
malities [13].

The term “sleep quality” is commonly used in sleep
medicine. In 1989, Buysse et al. referred to sleep quality
as a “complex phenomenon that is difficult to define and
measure objectively” [14]. Good sleep quality is associ-
ated with better health, less daytime sleepiness, greater
well-being and better psychological functioning [15]. Re-
cently, sleep quality is defined as one’s satisfaction of the
sleep experience, integrating aspects of sleep initiation,
sleep maintenance, sleep quantity, and refreshment upon
awakening [16]. The National Sleep Foundation (NSF)
released the key indicators of good sleep quality, as
established by a panel of experts. They include increase
in sleeping time while in bed (at least 85% of the total
time), falling asleep in 30 min or less, waking up no
more than once per night and being awake for 20 min or
less after initially falling asleep. However, there was less
or no consensus regarding sleep architecture or nap-
related variables as elements of good sleep quality [17].
Poor sleep quality is one of the defining features of
chronic insomnia [18]. Although recent systematic re-
views and meta-analyses have assessed the efficacy and
safety of yoga in specific groups of women, such as those
with prenatal depression [19] and primary dysmenorrhea
[20] in different stages, evidence for the efficacy of yoga
in improving sleep quality and insomnia of women has
not yet been systematically assessed. Thus, the aim of
this review was to systematically evaluate and perform a
meta-analysis of the available data on the efficacy and
safety of yoga in terms of improving sleep quality and in-
somnia in women.

Methods
Before beginning the review, we followed the checklist
for systematic reviews in concurrence with the preferred
reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines
[21] and suggestions by the
Cochrane Collaboration for programming and conduct-
ing systematic reviews and meta-analyses [22].

Eligibility criteria
Types of studies
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), randomized cross-
over studies, and cluster randomized trials were all eli-
gible for this meta-analysis. No restrictions in terms of
language and countries were applied.

efficiency (SE), and wake time after
sleep onset
(WASO) [24]. Sleep quality is also sometimes mea-
sured from PSG and actigraphy. Among these objective
indices are measures such as sleep onset latency, total
sleep time, wake time after sleep onset, sleep efficiency,
and number of awakenings [25].

Types of participants
Studies that included women (aged ≥18 years) with sleep
problems were eligible. No restrictions on the ethnicity
and comorbidity of participants were applied.

Types of interventions
No restrictions regarding yoga type, form, structure, fre-
quency, duration or length of
intervention programs
were applied. Studies on cointerventions that included
yoga as a part of multicomponent interventions were ex-
cluded because it would be difficult to distinguish the ef-
fects of yoga from additional modalities. Studies in
control
interventions that compared yoga treatments
with nontreatment, usual care, wait-lists, and education
without active physical exercise programs were all
eligible.

Types of outcome measures
The primary outcome of this study was sleep quality.
To be included in this review, studies had to assess at
least one of the sleep quality measures by using stan-
dardized instruments and provide outcomes both at
the baseline and follow-up for primary outcomes. In
particular, instruments in question include subjective
measurements, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), or ob-
jective measurements, such as polysomnography (PSG)
and actigraphy. The PSQI score have been recom-
mended as a reliable, valid and standardized instru-
ment to measure and to identify quality of sleep. The
widely
Index
employed Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
(PSQI), provides a measure of global sleep quality,
including sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep
efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medica-
tion, and daytime dysfunction [14]. The seven compo-
nents of the PSQI are standardized of areas routinely
assessed sleep complaints with possible range of 0–21
points. A global PSQI score of 5 or higher provided a
sensitive and specific measure for poor sleep quality
[14]. The ISI score is a reliable and valid instrument to
quantify perceived insomnia severity. A global
ISI
score of 8 or higher is indicative of some degree of in-
somnia, while moderate insomnia has a score of 15–21
and severe insomnia with a score of 22–28 [23]. PSG
or actigraphy reports the most complete and precise
information on the construction and distribution of
sleep periods, such as total sleep time (TST), sleep

Secondary outcomes: The secondary outcome included
in this study was the safety of the intervention, which
was assessed as number of patients with adverse events
(AEs),
including serious adverse events or nonserious
events. Serious adverse events referred to those events

hospitalization, disability or permanent damage, con-
genital anomaly/birth defect, or the need for medical or
surgical
intervention to prevent any of the aforemen-
tioned outcomes [26]. All other adverse events were
regarded as nonserious.

Search methods
The search strategy comprised four electronic databases
from their inception through June 01, 2019: Medline/
PubMed, ClinicalKey, ScienceDirect, Embase, PsycINFO,
and the Cochrane Library. The literature search was
constructed around search terms for “yoga,” “women,”
and “sleep” and was adapted for each database as neces-
sary. The complete search strategy for PubMed was as
follows: (“yoga” OR “asana” OR “pranayama” OR “dhy-
ana”) AND (“women” OR “female”) AND (“sleep” OR
“sleep quality” OR “sleep disturbance” OR “insomnia”).
Additional reference lists of identified original articles or
reviews, the table of the contents of the Journal of Yoga
and Physical Therapy, and Journal of National Taiwan
Sports University were searched manually.

Retrieved articles were scanned independently to verify
their eligibility, and the entire text was assessed by two
reviewers. A conflict of reviewers’ opinions on inclusion
or exclusion of any article was discussed with a third re-
viewer to reach a consensus.

Data extraction and management
Two reviewers independently extracted data on design
(e.g., article setting, author/year, country of studies, and
sampling strategy), participants (e.g., age, body max
index, clinical characteristics, comorbid condition, and
overall sample size), interventions (e.g., yoga type, fre-
quency of sessions per week, duration of yoga interven-
tion, and total
intervention time), control
interventions (e.g., type, frequency, length, and duration),
and outcomes (e.g., outcome measures with sleep quality
and safety-related events). A conflict of reviewers’ opin-
ions was discussed with a third reviewer until consensus
was reached.

Risk of bias in individual studies
Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias
in each study. There were seven domains of assess-
ment for the risk of bias include in the following: (1)
random sequence generation, (2) allocation conceal-
ment, (3) blinding of participants and personnel, (4)
blinding of outcome assessment, (5) incomplete out-
come data, (6) selective reporting, and (7) other biases
using the Cochrane Systematic Review Manual risk of
bias assessment tool [22]. All domains were scored as
low risk, high risk, or unclear
risk of bias and
assessed individually. A risk of bias table was com-
pleted for each included study. A conflict of
re-
viewers’ opinions was discussed with a third reviewer
until consensus was reached.

Data assessment of overall effect size
A meta-analysis was conducted with Review Manager 5
software (Version 5.3, The Nordic Cochrane Centre,
Copenhagen) and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Soft-
ware using a random effects model if at least two studies
assessing this specific outcome were obtainable. For con-
tinuous
differences
(SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calcu-
lated as the difference in means between groups divided
by the pooled standard deviation. For studies that did
not report data with standard deviations, we calculated
these values from standard errors, confidence intervals,
or t-values. If adequate information was available, we
would plan to perform subgroup analysis. The p value of
the summary effect < 0.05 were regarded as indicating
statistical significance.

A negative SMD was provided a definition to display
the beneficial effects of yoga intervention compared with
the control
intervention for sleep quality outcomes.
Cohen’s categories were used to assess the significance
of the overall effect size, with SMD = 0.2–0.5: small ef-
fect size; SMD = 0.5–0.8: medium effect size; and SMD >
0.8: large effect size [27].

Moderator analyses
Moderator and meta-regression analyses were further
performed to identify possible reasons for interstudy

heterogeneity. The
analysis
prespecified covariates,
including outcome measure-
ment tools, participant type, study quality, study re-
gion, participant age, intervention duration and study
sample size.

Risk of publication bias
Risk of publication bias was evaluated for each meta-
analysis that included at least 10 studies. Funnel plots
generated using Review Manager 5 software was esti-
mated from individual studies against each study’s stand-
ard error. Publication bias was evaluated through visual
analysis, in which roughly the symmetrical funnel plot
signifies no evidence of high risk of publication bias [28].
Potential publication bias was evaluated using the
Egger’s Intercept Test, with p values < 0.05 signifying
significant bias.

Results
Literature search
The results of
the literature search and screening
process are summarized in Fig. 1. The literature search
totaled 1338 records; one additional record was retrieved
from the Journal of National Taiwan Sports University
in the Chinese language database [29]. In all, 1295 re-
cords were excluded because they did not meet all pre-
defined inclusion criteria or were duplicated. Forty-four
full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Twenty-five
were excluded because they were not randomized [29,
30], did not include relevant outcomes [31–37], did not
include only female participants [38–46], included yoga
as a part of a multimodal
intervention (or combined
with other intervention) [47–50], lacked adequate con-
trol [51], and did not include a form of yoga intervention
[52, 53]. Nineteen full-text articles with 1832 partici-
pants were included in the qualitative synthesis and were
included in the meta-analysis. All articles were published
in English.

Assessment of heterogeneity
Statistical heterogeneity between studies was analyzed
using the I2 statistics and the Cochrane chi-square. The
variance between studies was measured using the tau-
square (Tau2). The level of heterogeneity was classified
as I2 = 0–24%: low heterogeneity; I2 = 25–49%: moderate
heterogeneity;
substantial heterogeneity;
and I2 = 75–100%: considerable heterogeneity. Given the
low power of this test when only few studies or studies
with a low sample size are included in a meta-analysis, a
P value of ≤0.1 for the chi-square test was regarded as
indicating significant heterogeneity [22].

I2 = 50–74%:

Study characteristics
A total of 19 studies were considered eligible for
systematic reviews. Information regarding the charac-
teristics of the sample, yoga or control group inter-
ventions, outcome measures, and results are listed in
Tables 1 and 2.

Study and participant characteristics
Of the 19 RCTs that were included in Table 1, six
RCTs included healthy participants [60–63, 67, 69],
including nurses [67], teachers [69], and women in
the menopausal transition period or postmenopausal

period [60–63]. The other 13 RCTs included breast
[55, 57–59],
cancer patients undergoing treatment
breast cancer patients who had completed treatment
[12, 54, 56, 71], type 2 diabetes mellitus patients [68],
fibromyalgia patients [64], knee osteoarthritis patients
[66], restless leg syndrome patients [65], and patients
experiencing dysfunctional uterine bleeding [70].

Overall, the 19 RCTs included were conducted in
the United States [12, 54–60, 62, 63, 65, 66, 71],
Brazil [61, 64], India [69, 70], Iran [68], and China
[67]. Study participants were recruited from hospitals
[54, 55, 57, 58, 67, 68, 70, 71], outpatient clinics [59,
61] and schools [69]. The process of recruitment also
included using purchased lists and health-plan enroll-
ment files [62, 63] and multiple other mechanisms,

including flyers, newspaper advertisements, web-based
announcements, brochures, public health departments,
tumor registry systems, and doctor referrals [12, 56,
60, 65, 66]. One study did not reveal the source from
which participants were recruited [64]. Nineteen stud-
ies included in the systematic review displayed a base-
line of PSQI higher than 5 or ISI higher than 8,
indicating poor sleep quality or insomnia. The only
exceptions were two studies, with individual control
groups in each study displaying a baseline of PSQI
lower than 5 [69] or ISI lower than 8 [71]. The sam-
ple size ranged from 20 to 249 with a median of 96.
Participant’s mean age ranged from 29.8 to 71.9 years,
with a median of 50.1 years. All participants were
women.

Intervention characteristics
Of the 19 included studies in Table 1, three reported
using Iyengar Yoga [12, 60, 65]; two reported using
Hatha Yoga [56, 66]; two reported using Tibetan Yoga
[58, 61]; two reported using Restorative Yoga [54, 71];
one reported using Vini Yoga [63]; one reported using
Yoga Relaxation with MindSound Resonance Technique
[69]; one reported using yoga breathing exercise in warm
water [64]; and only seven RCTs revealed yoga programs
with postures, breathing, relaxation or mediation, with-
out defining a specific style of yoga [55, 57, 59, 62, 67,
68, 70]. All RCTs included yoga postures in their yoga
intervention; 16 RCTs included yoga breathing; 15 RCTs
included yoga relaxation; 12 RCTs included meditation;
and 7 RCTs included all contents with postures, breath-
ing, relaxation, and meditation for the yoga intervention
group [55, 57, 62, 67, 68, 70, 71]. The duration of yoga
interventions ranged from 1 week to 24 weeks, with a
median of 10 weeks; the frequency of yoga interventions
ranged from one to five weekly sessions of 45 to 120
min. Sixteen studies compared the yoga group with wait-
list control groups with no specific treatment; three
studies compared the yoga group with the control group,
including two studies for education groups [12, 65] and
one study for social support groups [59].

Outcome measures
All studies evaluated outcomes directly at the end of in-
terventions. All studies assessed the subjective or object-
ive measurements of sleep quality: 16 RCTs used the
PSQI; three RCTs used the ISI [61, 62, 71]; one RCT

used PSG [61]; and two RCTs used actigraphy [58, 63].
Safety-related events were reported in only two RCTs
[56, 62].

Risk of bias
Risk of bias in individual assessments
Graphical representation of the risk-of-bias assessment
is represented in Fig. 2. All studies had a high or unclear
risk of bias in at least one domain. All studies claimed to
be randomized; however, three studies did not reveal
their content and method of random sequence [54, 61,
68]. Twelve studies did not report methods applied to
perform adequate allocation [54, 55, 57–61, 63, 67–70].
Most studies offered no data material on blinding. Three
studies clearly reported that participants and personnel
were blinded [12, 59, 66]. Four studies clearly reported
that researchers and outcome assessments were blinded
[12, 56, 59, 66]. Six studies had insufficient data on attri-
tion rates [60–62, 64, 65, 68]. Twelve studies had a low
risk of selection reporting; only two studies had a high
risk of selective reporting due to several reported out-
come parameters not being revealed in study protocol or
duplicate publications reporting different results of the
same trial [61, 62]. Six studies had a high risk of other
potential sources of bias due to poor participant compli-
ance, intervention length, sample size or baseline differ-
ences [60, 64–66, 70, 71].

Publication bias

quality of women that involved yoga groups compared

Fig. 2 Risk of bias in individual studies. +, low risk of bias;?, unclear risk of bias; −, high risk of bias (a). Risk of bias for each criterion presented as
percentages across all included studies (b)

with control groups included 16 studies. The asym-
metrical shape of the funnel plot indicated that sub-
jective publication bias was detected (Fig. 3). Objective
publication bias was analyzed using Egger’s Regression
Test. Egger’s Test consists of the regression between
the accuracy of the studies and standardized effects,
which are weighted by the inverse of variance. Border-
line findings (P = 0.05) show objective evidence on
publication bias between precision and standardized
effects of studies in the present study, specifically sug-
gesting need for future studies to expound on the
issue.

Analysis of overall effects
Primary outcomes
The random effects model was applied to analyze the 19
RCTs outcomes by different sleep outcome measure-
ment tools. The meta-analysis of combined data con-
ducted with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, showed a
significant
in sleep problems (SMD = -
0.327, 95% CI = − 0.506 to − 0.148, P < 0.001). However,
significant heterogeneity existed among all the studies
(Q = 43.152, I2 = 58.287%, P = 0.001). Therefore, moder-
ator and meta-regression analyses were conducted to
further explore the determinants of the heterogeneity.

The meta-analysis revealed the effects of yoga com-
pared with the control group on the sleep quality and in-
somnia of women using the PSQI or ISI, as displayed in
Fig. 4. Sixteen RCTs revealed evidence for effects of yoga
compared with the control group in improving sleep
quality in women using the PSQI (SMD = − 0.54; 95%
CI = − 0.89 to − 0.19; P = 0.003). However, three RCTs
revealed no effects of yoga compared with the control
group in reducing the severity of insomnia in women
using ISI (SMD = − 0.13; 95% CI = − 0.74 to 0.48; P =
0.69). Two RCTs revealed no effects of yoga compared
with control group in improving sleep efficiency (SMD =
0.85; 95% CI = − 0.56 to 2.26; P = 0.26) or total sleep time
(SMD = − 0.06; 95% CI = − 0.26 to 0.13; P = − 0.59) in
women using actigraphy.

Secondary outcomes (safety)
Only two studies reported safety-related events. Two
events revealed in one study could potentially be attrib-
uted to yoga intervention: two women reported the re-
currence of chronic back and/or shoulder problems [56].
In another study, adverse events reported did not differ
between the yoga intervention group and the control
group (P = 0.41). These adverse events included muscle
aches and strains (6.7%, yoga group; 10.3%, control
group), low back pain (4.2%, yoga group; 3.1%, control
group), or changes in strength or sensation in arms and
legs (5.5% yoga group; 8.9% control group). Dropouts
were not regarded as being adverse events because they
did not explicitly show a possible reason or explanation
for dropout in the original study. No serious adverse ef-
fects were reported in the included studies.

Subgroup analyses
Participants were divided into two separate subgroups.
Meta-analyses revealed the effects of yoga compared with
the control group for women with breast cancer in Fig. 5.
Seven RCTs revealed no evidence for the effect of yoga
compared with the control group in improving sleep qual-
ity for women with breast cancer using the PSQI (SMD =
− 0.15; 95% CI = − 0.31 to 0.01; P = 0.5). Four RCTs re-
vealed no evidence for effects of yoga compared with the
control group in improving sleep quality for women
undergoing treatment for breast cancer (SMD = − 0.08;
95% CI = − 0.29 to 0.13; P = 0.45). Three RCTs revealed
no evidence for positive effects of yoga in terms of im-
proving sleep quality for women with breast cancer who
had completed treatment compared with the control
group (SMD = − 0.25; 95% CI = − 0.50 to 0.00; P = 0.05).

The meta-analysis showed evidence of the positive ef-
fects of yoga on sleep quality compared with control
groups for peri/postmenopausal women as displayed in
Fig. 6. Four RCTs revealed no evidence for effects of
yoga compared with control groups in improving sleep

quality in peri/postmenopausal women using the PSQI
(SMD = − 0.31; 95% CI = − 0.95 to 0.33; P = 0.34). Two
RCTs revealed no evidence for effects of yoga compared
with the control group in reducing severity of insomnia
in peri/postmenopausal using ISI (SMD = − 0.29; 95%
CI = − 1.23 to 0.65; P = 0.55).

Moderator analyses, meta-regression
Moderator analyses and meta-regression are presented
in Table 3. Significant factors in observed heterogeneity
were identified in yoga on sleep quality and insomnia in
women with sleep problems. Studies that used PSQI as
outcome measurement tool showed a greater reduction
in sleep problems than other studies that used other in-
struments as outcome measurement tools (Hedges’ g = −
0.369 vs. 0.031, P = 0.002). Participants without breast
cancer showed more improvement in sleep problems
than participants with breast cancer (Hedges’ g = − 0.522
vs. -0.148, P = 0.001). Studies without peri/postmeno-
pausal women showed more improvement in sleep prob-
lems than studies with peri/postmenopausal women
(Hedges’ g = − 0.419 vs. -0.084, P = 0.003). Regression
analyses revealed a positive correlation with total length
of class hours (p = 0.003), indicating that more total class
hours, increased the chance to have significant results.
Regression analyses revealed a negative correlation with
mean age (p = 0.003) and sample size (p = 0.032) of
study, indicating that the younger, and smaller sample
sizes were more likely to have significant results.

Sensitivity analyses
In the included studies with low risk of selection bias,
reporting bias, and other bias, the effect of yoga group
compared to control group on women sleep PSQI did not
change substantially, including random sequence gener-
ation bias (SMD = − 0.45; 95% CI = − 0.84 to − 0.11; P =
0.01; heterogeneity: I2 = 88%; χ2 = 107.43, P < 0.00001), al-
location concealment bias (SMD = − 0.77; 95% CI = − 1.37
to − 0.16; P = 0.01; heterogeneity: I2 = 88%; χ2 = 40.95, P <
0.00001), selective reporting bias (standard mean differ-
ence = − 0.59; 95% CI = − 1.10 to − 0.08; P = 0.02; hetero-
geneity: I2 = 88%; χ2 = 93.11, P < 0.00001) and other bias
(standard mean difference = − 0.53; 95% CI = − 1.03 to −
I2 = 86%; χ2 = 44.03, P <
0.04; P = 0.03; heterogeneity:
0.00001). The effect compared with the control group
remained significant in terms of sensitivity analyses of per-
formance bias, detection bias, or attrition bias after elimin-
ating high risk bias or uncertain risk bias of the studies.

insomnia, 19 RCTs revealed evidence for yoga improving
sleep problems in women (SMD = − 0.327, 95% CI = −
0.506 to − 0.148, P < 0.001). As shown in Fig. 4, 16 RCTs
meta-analysis suggests yoga can bring 1.2 points im-
provement in PSQI score (SMD = − 0.54; 95% CI = −
0.89 to − 0.19; P = 0.003). However, seven RCTs revealed
no evidence for yoga improving sleep quality in women
with breast cancer (Fig. 5, SMD = − 0.15; 95% CI = − 0.31
to 0.01; P = 0.5). Four RCTs revealed no evidence for im-
proving PSQI in peri/postmenopausal women (Fig. 6,
SMD = − 0.31; 95% CI = − 0.95 to 0.33; P = 0.34). Two
RCTs revealed no evidence for improving ISI in peri/
postmenopausal women (Fig. 6, SMD = − 0.29; 95% CI =
− 1.23 to 0.65; P = 0.55).

However, heterogeneity of effects were high across
all studies. In Table 3, our moderator analyses yielded
statistically significant differences, the effect of yoga
for improving sleep problems in non-breast cancer
subgroup, non peri/postmenopausal subgroup are su-
perior to breast cancer subgroup, peri/postmenopausal
subgroup.

Overall, the application of yoga was not associated
with worsening of sleep problems or increased ad-
verse effects. Only two studies explicitly assessed
safety-related nonserious adverse events. Yoga is most

likely a comparatively safe intervention in this popula-
tion. However, future RCTs should take more mea-
sures to ensure stricter reporting of adverse events
and reasons for dropouts.

Comparison with prior reviews
There was no systematic review available that explicitly
focused on yoga for improving sleep quality and insom-
nia in a specific gender. Ours is the first systematic re-
view and meta-analysis with 19 RCTs that to focus on
the effects of yoga on women with sleep problems. A
previous review published until February 2019 included
subgroup analysis of yoga on mind-body therapies on in-
somnia [72]. This recent review illustrated that yoga had
beneficial effects on subjective sleep quality in partici-
pants in all gender groups. Our meta-analysis with 16
RCTs uncovered evidence for the effects of yoga on the
sleep quality in women. Only six RCTs were found to
have overlapped with this previous review [58, 61, 62,
65–67]. Our meta-analysis also examined the potential
effect on specific subgroups, such as breast cancer and
peri/postmenopausal subgroups, with these subgroups
serving as potential factors in sleep quality effects (al-
though the result did not show any clear difference). Sig-
nificant subgroup differences were identified for the

Wang et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2020) 20:195 

Page 16 of 19

following participants types:
(peri/postmenopausal vs.
non peri/postmenopausal, breast cancer vs. non-breast
cancer). Results from the peri/postmenopausal subgroup
of women in our systematic review also agreed with pre-
vious published reports that suggested that yoga had no
significant effect on the severity of insomnia in middle-
aged women [73]. There were baseline differences be-
tween participants based on intervention assignment in
PSQI scores [62, 65]. This may have contributed to re-
sults displaying no significant effect in sleep quality in
the peri/postmenopausal subgroup of women. Yoga
seems to be effective for reducing total menopausal
symptoms including psychological, somatic, vasomotor
and in previous systematic review and meta-analysis
[74], but there is no direct answer in the study focusing
on reducing sleep problems. Future research should en-
sure more rigorous methodology and adequate sample
size concerning the effects of yoga on quality of sleep
improvement among the subgroup of peri/postmeno-
pausal women.

Compared to yoga intervention, previous systematic
reviews also indicate that programmed exercise im-
proved sleep quality in middle-aged women [73]. How-
ever, these reviews are also limited to high heterogeneity
of clinical evidence and failed to provide any specific
suggestions for exercise dosages or formats. Additionally,
other reviews included an overly wide range of nonphar-
macological interventions ranging from walking [75], tai
chi [76], qigong exercise [72] showing evidence of bene-
ficial effect in improving self-rated sleep quality. How-
ever, despite this, heterogeneity remained high due to
difference of interventions and target populations. Our
meta-analysis conducted to further explore the determi-
nants of the heterogeneity with subgroup analysis for
categorical moderators and continuous moderators to
find significant factors for observed heterogeneity.

External and internal validity
Major threats to external validity included the specificity
of variables of sampled participants and multiple yoga
types or styles. The majority of RCTs included partici-
pants from North America, South America, and Asia;
lacking studies from Europe and Africa. It might not be
as universally transferable to other areas.

There were several other limitations in this review: the
wide variety of diagnoses included; the inclusion of only
certain types of people or professions, such as nurses,
teachers, and peri/postmenopausal women; and patients
with breast cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, fibromyalgia
syndrome, osteoarthritis of the knee, restless leg syn-
drome, and primary dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The
interventions with different types or
heterogeneity of
relaxation, or
(postures, breathing,
yoga
styles of

mediation), and potential bias were included in this sys-
tematic review.

Other threat to internal validity was study bias. Only
few effects were robust against all potential bias. All of
our studies claimed to have applied randomization
methods; however, three RCTs failed to provide the de-
sign protocol of randomization. Some of the included
studies may not have been truly randomized. Erroneous
allocation concealment has been empirically revealed to
be a significant source of bias in RCTs [77]. Our in-
cluded studies only had a low risk or an unclear risk of
detection bias without high risk detection bias. The re-
sults of meta-analysis did no changed when studies ex-
cluded high risk or unclear risk reviews on selection bias
or reporting bias. The internal validity of the review ap-
peared to be limited but acceptable.

Strengths and weaknesses
This is the first and latest systematic review and meta-
analysis available on yoga for sleep quality and insomnia
in women. A large number of RCTs on female
population-related physiological and physiological co-
morbidities and risk factors in insomnia were included.
There were five primary limitations of this review. First,
subjective publication bias revealed in this review may
have been due to selective reporting bias, which means
that articles with negative findings may have not been
published or poor methodological quality of including
articles. We have applied Egger’s Test for objective pub-
lication bias in our review. Second, the participant char-
acteristics included in the review were heterogeneous;
subgroups were included to analyze the effectiveness of
different participant groups; and the small number of
RCTs limited data presentation. Third, the severity of
the sleep complaints and health status of participants
was not considered or individually listed in each study.
Baseline differences in PSQI scores were found between
intervention and control groups in three studies [56, 62,
65]. This may have led to heterogeneity. The fourth limi-
tation was the intensity, frequency, and duration of yoga
interventions were heterogeneous; short term applica-
tions of less than 1 month yoga intervention were found
in some studies [58, 64, 69]. Only four reviews reported
long-term follow up effects, ranging from 3 months to
12 months [55–58]. Lastly, lack of safety issue evaluation
including serious adverse events or nonserious events in
each study.

Implications for further research
This systematic review and meta-analysis was limited by
the low methodological quality of included studies. Fur-
ther RCTs should ensure rigorous methodology and
reporting, which would mean adequate sample size,
concealment,
adequate

randomization,

allocation

intention-to-treat analysis, and blinding of at least out-
come assessors [78]. Researchers for study interventions
may need to apply a standard protocol. Adequate report-
ing of safety issues with yoga intervention should be dis-
cussed in future randomized controlled trials. Evidence
was limited because few studies report safety-related ad-
verse effects. Most of the included studies failed to re-
port this aspect.

Conclusion
This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated
that yoga intervention in women has benefits compared
to non-active control conditions in term of managing
sleep problems. The moderator analyses suggested that
participants in the non-breast cancer subgroup or partic-
ipants in the non-peri/postmenopausal subgroup were
associated with greater benefits, with the longer total
length of class time, the more beneficial these practices
were.
