Abstract

Page 2

Background:  Exposure to surgery and anesthesia in early childhood has been found to be 
associated with an increased risk of behavioral deficits. While the US Food and Drug Association 
(FDA) has warned against prenatal exposure to anesthetic drugs, little clinical evidence exists 
to support this recommendation. This study evaluates the association between prenatal exposure 
to general anesthesia due to maternal procedures during pregnancy and neuropsychological and 
behavioral outcomes scores at age 10.

Methods:  This is an observational cohort study of children born in Perth, Western Australia with 
two generations of participants contributing data to the Raine Study. In the Raine Study the first 
generation (Gen1) are mothers enrolled during pregnancy, and the second generation (Gen2) the 
n=2024 children born to these mothers from 1989 to 1992 with neuropsychological and behavioral 
tests at age 10. In the primary analysis, six neuropsychological and behavioral tests were evaluated 
at age 10: Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM), McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular 
Development (MAND), Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), Symbol Digit Modality Test 
(SDMT) with written and oral scores, Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF) with 
Expressive, Receptive, and Total language scores, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) with 
Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total behavior scores. Outcome scores of children prenatally 
exposed to general anesthesia were compared to children without prenatal exposure using 
multivariable linear regression models adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates (sex, race, 
income, and maternal education, alcohol or tobacco use, and clinical diagnoses: diabetes, epilepsy, 
hypertension, psychiatric disorders, or thyroid dysfunction). Bonferroni adjustment was used for 
the six independent tests in the primary analysis, so a corrected p-value <0.0083 (p=0.05 divided 
by 6 tests, or a 99.17% confidence interval) was required for statistical significance.

Results:  Among 2024 children with available outcome scores, 22 (1.1%) were prenatally 
exposed to general anesthesia. Prenatally exposed children had higher/worse Externalizing CBCL 
scores (score difference of 6.1; [99.17% confidence interval (CI): 0.2 , 12.0] p=0.006) than 
unexposed children. Of six tests including eleven scores and subscores, only Externalizing CBCL 
scores remained significant after multiple comparisons adjustment with no significant differences 
found in any other score.

Conclusion:  Prenatal exposure to general anesthetics is associated with increased externalizing 
behavioral problems in childhood. However, given the limitations of this study and that avoiding 
necessary surgery during pregnancy can have significant detrimental effects on the mother and the 
child, further studies are needed before changes to clinical practice are made.

Introduction:

Millions of children receive anesthesia each year for surgical and diagnostic procedures. 
Questions have emerged about the safety of anesthetics in children given that exposure 
to anesthetic agents during brain maturation disrupts neurodevelopment in preclinical 
models,1–3 and early childhood exposure to anesthesia may be associated with

neurocognitive deficits later in life.4–6 Based on these concerns, the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) issued a warning in 2016 about the neurodevelopmental effects of 
anesthetic drugs in “children younger than 3 years or in pregnant women during their third 
trimester”.7 Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes following prenatal exposures however 
have yet to be evaluated in a clinical study and the recommendation from the FDA is 
based in large part on animal models. The scientific premise however is plausible as all 
general anesthetic drugs have been found to cross the placenta,8 and the prenatal period 
is characterized by high fetal sensitivity to neurotoxic agents throughout all trimesters of 
gestation.9 In addition the prenatal neurodevelopmental time period has specifically been 
associated with peak brain vulnerability in preclinical studies of anesthetic neurotoxicity.3,10 
The primary purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate whether prenatal exposure to 
general anesthetic agents due to maternal need for surgery and anesthesia during pregnancy 
is associated with differences in neuropsychological or behavioral survey scores at age 10. 
Additional secondary analyses were performed to explore the clinical significance of any 
score differences as well as the contribution of perinatal and postnatal factors that may occur 
after prenatal exposure.

Methods:

This study was approved by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board, with the 
requirement of written informed consent waived. Data collection and storage at each age 
was approved by Ethics Committees at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Princess Margaret 
Hospital, and the University of Western Australia.

The Raine Study Cohort:

The Raine Study is an established birth cohort in Perth, Western Australia with two 
generations of participants contributing data, the first generation (Gen1) who are the mothers 
enrolled during pregnancy, and the second generation (Gen2) consisting of their 2,868 
children born from 1989 to 1992.11 As part of the study, detailed demographic and medical 
data were collected prenatally and at birth from medical records and parental self-report. 
Children were assessed for the presence of medical illnesses at various ages after birth and 
had comprehensive neuropsychological testing performed at the age 10 follow-up.5

Prenatal Exposure:

Exposure was defined as maternal exposure to general anesthesia during pregnancy and 
was determined based on questionnaires completed by the mothers during two antenatal 
study visits at approximately 18 and 34 weeks of gestational age (GA). In the survey at 
18 weeks of GA, mothers were specifically asked, “Since you have been pregnant”, “Have 
you had a general anesthetic?” The mothers were asked to describe the operation as well 
as either the approximate date of the procedure or the GA of the child at the time. The 
same questions were asked on the 34 week survey, which specifically asked about general 
anesthesia in the time since the 18 week visit. (Supplemental Figure 1 and Figure 2) For 
the present study, the written survey responses were reviewed and abstracted from the 
original study questionnaires. Since there may be confusion on the part of the mothers 
regarding what may constitute a general anesthetic, the responses by the mothers were

independently reviewed. Consensus on the likelihood of the mother receiving a general 
anesthetic based on the type and timing of the procedure during gestation was reached in 
discussions between an obstetric anesthesiologist and two pediatric anesthesiologists, one of 
whom has first-hand knowledge of clinical anesthetic practices in Western Australia (R.L., 
C.I., and B. v. U.). For any operations where the likely type of anesthetic was unclear, 
advice was sought from additional obstetric anesthesiologists who administered clinical care 
in Western Australia during time period when the women were enrolled. Procedures were 
classified as 1) Likely general anesthetic, 2) Likely IV sedation, or 3) Unlikely to have 
required a general anesthetic or IV sedation. For the primary analysis, all maternal data 
forms that lacked information on the type of procedure were classified as “Unlikely to have 
required general anesthesia or IV sedation”.

Neurodevelopmental Outcomes:

A range of cognitive domains were evaluated using six directly assessed neuropsychological 
tests and parental surveys. Cognition was assessed by the Symbol Digit Modality Test 
(SDMT) and the Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM) with the SDMT assessing 
visual tracking, attention, and fine motor skills and generating written and oral scores, 
and the CPM measuring global cognitive performance, non-verbal intelligence, and 
visuospatial functions.12,13 Motor function was assessed using the McCarron Assessment 
of Neuromuscular Development (MAND) which evaluated both fine and gross motor tasks 
and generated a Neurodevelopmental Index Score.14 The Clinical Evaluation of Language 
Fundamentals (CELF) is a language test that assesses higher order semantic, grammatical, 
and verbal memory abilities and generates three scores. The CELF-R is the receptive 
language score measuring listening comprehension, CELF-E is the expressive language 
score tracking speaking ability, and the CELF-T represents total language ability.15 The 
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) is a receptive listening vocabulary test which also 
assesses language.16 Behavioral problems were measured by the Child Behavior Checklist 
(CBCL), a 118-item informant-report questionnaire evaluating internalizing problems such 
as depression and somatic complaints, as well as externalizing problems such as aggressive 
behavior and rule-breaking. In addition to internalizing and externalizing scores, the CBCL 
also generates a total behavior score.17 As opposed to the other neuropsychological tests 
in which higher scores show better performance, for CBCL, higher scores show more 
behavioral problems, with scores greater than 60 considered as clinical deficit.18,19 The 
CBCL tests were completed by the child’s caregiver and since they did not require the 
presence of the child for testing, were completed at a higher rate than other tests.

Statistical Analysis:

Children of mothers classified as being likely exposed to general anesthesia during 
pregnancy were classified as exposed and compared to children of mothers who reported 
no history of prenatal exposure to anesthesia. Crude mean scores for exposed and 
unexposed children were initially evaluated. As the primary analysis, multivariable linear 
regression was used to evaluate score differences after adjusting for demographic and 
clinical covariates (sex, race, maternal school level, income, alcohol or tobacco use during 
pregnancy, as well as the presence of any maternal clinical diagnoses: diabetes, epilepsy, 
hypertension, psychiatric disorders, or thyroid dysfunction). A Bonferroni adjustment was

used for multiple comparisons. The Bonferroni adjustment is known to be conservative, 
particularly when outcomes are correlated, which may jeopardize sensitivity to detect true 
signals.20 Given the high degree of correlation between scores and subscores for specific 
neuropsychological tests, in this study we considered there to be six independent tests, one 
for each of the six individual neuropsychological and behavioral tests evaluated. For this 
adjustment, the significance level (α) was 0.05 for the six independent tests. Therefore, the 
corrected p-value threshold for significance was set to 0.05/6 or p<0.0083 and a confidence 
interval of 99.17% was used for our primary analysis. This corrected p-value threshold 
of p<0.0083 was applied to the secondary analysis evaluating risk of crossing a clinical 
threshold. The mediation analysis was an exploratory analysis and a p-value threshold of 
p<0.05 was used.

Evaluation of Risk of Crossing a Clinical Threshold:

Two secondary analyses were performed to aid in the interpretability of the primary analysis. 
The first explores the clinical significance of any score differences found in the primary 
analysis by evaluating the increased risk of any child crossing an established clinical 
threshold for deficit. For CBCL, a frequently used clinical cutoff, including other studies 
evaluating children after exposure to anesthesia, is a score >60, which corresponds to a score 
that is 1 standard deviation worse than the normalized mean score in the population used 
to develop the instrument.18,19 For the other assessments where clinical deficit has been 
defined at various levels, in order to maintain consistency, scores worse than 1 standard 
deviation from the mean of the present population were defined as clinical deficit. In this 
analysis, multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios 
(aOR) of deficit.

Additional Descriptive Evaluations:

In order to evaluate whether children with prenatal exposure to general anesthesia had higher 
rates of comorbidity, healthcare utilization using a previously defined resource utilization 
variable in children with prenatal anesthetic exposure were reported.21 In order to evaluate 
neuropsychological and behavioral outcome scores based on the trimester of exposure, crude 
trimester specific scores were also reported based on the reported date or gestational age of 
exposure. Mothers who did not report specific dates of exposure were excluded from this 
analysis.

Sensitivity Analyses:

Missing covariates were initially coded as separate levels to maximize the total number 
of children included in the analysis, but as sensitivity analyses, complete case analyses 
were also performed. In our primary analysis, determination of general anesthetic exposure 
was based on the expert opinion of three reviewers. Since these reviewers did not have 
access to the anesthetic records, the determinations were made based on procedure type 
and gestational age of the child at the time of the procedure, and therefore there may 
be a risk for misclassification. This possibility was explored in an additional sensitivity 
analysis by repeating the primary multivariable linear regression analysis but changing the 
prenatal exposure variable to include any mother who reported receiving a general anesthetic

regardless of the documented procedure. In this analysis the threshold for significance was 
maintained at p<0.0083.

Analysis of Potential Mediators:

Surgery and anesthesia during pregnancy are associated with perinatal factors and 
complications and post-natal events which may affect long-term neurodevelopmental 
outcomes.22 If these factors occur after exposure and potentially as a result of the exposure, 
adjusting for these post-exposure variables may result in overadjustment bias.23 Therefore, 
to evaluate the association of these factors on outcomes that are significantly associated with 
prenatal exposure to general anesthesia, a mediation analysis was performed as a secondary 
exploratory analysis with perinatal and post-natal factors evaluated as potential mediators 
between prenatal general anesthetic exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes. In the 
outcomes showing a significant difference, the “total effect” of the prenatal exposure is the 
effect of the prenatal exposure on the outcome while ignoring the mediator variables.24 
This is the effect we estimated in the primary analysis, and is composed of the “direct 
effect” which is the effect of the exposure on the outcome that is not transmitted through 
the mediator and the “indirect effect” which is the effect that goes through the mediator. 
For outcomes not showing a statistically significant total effect, the importance of the 
indirect effect of a mediator is limited and therefore these outcomes were not evaluated. 
The potential mediators evaluated included factors in the child assessed at the time of birth 
such as prematurity, low birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation, maternal factors at 
the time of delivery such as need for caesarean section or epidural anesthesia use, as well 
as post-natal surgery prior to age 3 years old. Due to the presence of sparse data in some 
covariates, the mediation analysis was performed in children with complete covariate data 
(complete case analysis model). Despite this, sparse data was still found in the models 
evaluating prematurity as a mediator, and as a result, in those models, the maternal heart 
disease covariate was removed. We calculated “percent mediated” by dividing the mediated 
effect by the total effect of the exposure on the outcome. Since mediation analysis may be 
susceptible to bias in the presence of exposure-mediator interaction when this interaction 
is not included in the regression model, interactions between the mediator and exposure 
variables were included in all models.25 We report the “percent due to interaction”, which 
divides the average portion of the total effect that is attributable to interaction by the total 
effect.26 For additional details and assumptions made in the mediation analysis, please see 
Supplemental Methods. SAS 9.4 was used for all analyses with the mediation analysis 
performed using the CAUSALMED procedure.

The Raine Study cohort consists of 2868 live births in Western Australia from 1989 to 1992 
with mothers enrolled during pregnancy. Of these children, 45 had mothers who completed 
a survey at 18 or 34 weeks stating that they had received a general anesthetic during 
pregnancy. Upon review of the maternal procedures recorded on the survey forms, based on 
the likely anesthetic used for the maternal surgery, 30 children were judged to likely have 
had a prenatal exposure to general anesthesia, 1 was likely to have had a prenatal exposure 
to IV sedation, and 14 were unlikely to have had a prenatal exposure to general anesthesia

or IV sedation. (Figure 1) The surgical procedures performed on the expecting mothers were 
mostly minor in nature and took place at GAs ranging from 3 to 34 weeks. (Table 1) Most 
mothers reported either the date of surgery or the gestational age of the child. Some mothers, 
however, did not report a date and the only information regarding the timing of the operation 
was whether the survey form was filled during the 18 week or 34 week follow-up visit.

There were a total of 2024 children with some neuropsychological testing available at age 10 
years, of which 22 (1.1%) were likely exposed prenatally to general anesthesia, 1 (0.05%) 
was likely exposed prenatally to IV sedation, 7 (0.3%) were unlikely to have been exposed 
to general anesthesia or IV sedation despite a reported exposure, and 1994 (98.5%) had no 
reported prenatal exposure to general anesthesia. Mothers of children with prenatal exposure 
to general anesthesia were less likely to have a college or university degree and more likely 
to smoke cigarettes and use alcohol during pregnancy than mothers of children with no 
prenatal exposure to anesthetics. (Table 2)

Neuropsychological Test Score Differences between Prenatally Exposed and Unexposed 
Children:

Crude mean differences in test scores between prenatally exposed and unexposed children 
were evaluated. (Supplemental Table 1) After adjusting for demographic and clinical 
covariates using multivariable linear regression, compared to unexposed children, those with 
prenatal exposure to general anesthesia had significantly higher/worse Externalizing CBCL 
scores (score difference of 6.1; [99.17% confidence interval (CI): 0.2 , 12.0] p=0.006). 
(Figure 2) No significant differences were found in any other score.

Clinical threshold analysis:

In order to evaluate the clinical implications of these score differences, all scores were 
evaluated to see if they crossed a threshold for clinical deficit. Of the prenatally exposed 
children, 36.4% crossed a threshold for clinical deficit in CBCL Externalizing behavioral 
scores compared to 10.5% of children with no history of prenatal exposure. (Table 3) After 
adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates using multivariable logistic regression, 
prenatal anesthetic exposure was associated with an increased risk of clinical deficit in 
externalizing behavioral scores (aOR: 4.6; [99.17% CI: 1.3 , 16.0], p=0.001). No other 
outcome scores showed statistically significant differences following multiple comparisons 
adjustment. For some outcomes, no children with prenatal exposure to anesthesia were in the 
deficit range so those outcomes could not be evaluated.

Additional Descriptive Evaluations:

When evaluating comorbidity in these children after birth, children with prenatal exposure to 
general anesthesia had similar rates of healthcare resource utilization in the first 10 years of 
life when compared to children with no exposure to anesthetics. (Supplemental Table 2) In 
evaluating trimester specific exposures, the majority of exposures occurred during the first 
trimester with 10 or 13 children exposed in the first trimester and evaluated at age 10. For 
children exposed in the second trimester, 5 to 6 were evaluated at age 10, and for children 
exposed in the third trimester, only 2 were evaluated at age 10. The highest mean CBCL 
scores were seen in the children exposed in the first trimester. However, given the limited

sample size, no statistical tests were performed, and these results should be interpreted with 
caution. (Supplemental Table 3)

Sensitivity analyses:

When performing a complete case analysis, prenatally exposed children still had higher/
worse Externalizing CBCL scores (score difference of 6.7, [99.17% CI: 0.5 , 13.0] p=0.004) 
than unexposed children. Like the primary analysis, no statistically significant differences 
were found in any other score after multiple comparisons adjustment. As a sensitivity 
analysis we redefined prenatal exposure as any mother claiming that they had a general 
anesthetic during pregnancy regardless of their procedure type, which included mothers 
having dental and minor skin procedures which are unlikely to require general anesthesia. 
In this analysis, compared to unexposed children, exposed children were found to have a 
CBCL Externalizing score difference of 5.0, [99.17% CI: −0.1 , 10.2] p=0.010). After using 
this broader definition of prenatal exposure, the absolute adjusted mean score difference 
for CBCL Externalizing scores was not as large as that found in the primary analysis 
and was not statistically significant after multiple comparisons adjustment. (Supplemental 
Table 4) No other outcome scores were statistically significant after multiple comparisons 
adjustment.

Evaluation of potential mediators:

When evaluating the six potential mediators, in the children with prenatal exposure to 
general anesthesia, a higher rate of cesarean delivery (31.8% vs. 20.9%) and epidural 
anesthetic use (63.6% vs. 47.7%) was seen compared to children with no history of 
prenatal exposure. (Supplemental Table 5) The other variables were similar between the 
children with and without prenatal exposure. The percentage of the total effect mediated 
by each of these potential mediators was evaluated and none were found to be statistically 
significant. However, when evaluating the percentage of the total effect due to interaction, 
the interaction between C-section and exposure was found to be statistically significant 
(percent due to interaction: 73.1; 95% CI: [4.8 , 141.3] p=0.036). (Table 4)

Discussion:

Based on our results, prenatal exposure to general anesthesia due to maternal surgery 
during pregnancy was associated with worse childhood externalizing behavioral problem 
scores, and a 4.6 times increased risk of crossing a threshold for a clinically significant 
deficit in externalizing behavioral problems. No differences however were found in 
other neurocognitive domains. That the differences were found specifically in behavioral 
scores is consistent with other studies evaluating neuropsychological and behavioral 
outcomes in children after post-natal anesthetic exposures. In the (Pediatric Anesthesia 
NeuroDevelopment Assessment) PANDA study, the only outcomes showing significant 
differences were the CBCL Total and Internalizing scores which were worse in anesthetic 
exposed children when compared to their unexposed siblings.18 The Mayo Anesthesia 
Safety in Kids (MASK) study also identified significantly worse CBCL Total, Internalizing, 
and Externalizing scores, but only after more than one anesthetic exposure.19 The 
differences found in the PANDA study ranged from 2.7 to 3.2 points worse in the children

with a single anesthetic exposure while multiply exposed children in the MASK study had 
scores that were 2.9 to 4.8 points worse. The mean score differences found in the present 
study in the CBCL Total and Internalizing scores were 5.2 and 6.1 points worse (more 
than one half of a standard deviation), which is at least equivalent with those found in 
children with post-natal multiple exposures.19 The CBCL results from the PANDA and 
MASK studies however were not the primary outcomes in those studies and should therefore 
be interpreted with caution. The results from the present study however differ from those 
evaluating a cohort of children from the Raine Study with post-natal exposures. In a prior 
study, when evaluating children with post-natal exposures under the age of 3 years old, 
worse scores in language and abstract reasoning were found while no significant differences 
in behavior were identified.5

A secondary analysis was performed evaluating outcomes after trimester specific exposures. 
Given the small sample size, the conclusions that can be drawn from this are limited. 
However, it is worth noting that while the FDA only warns against third trimester 
exposures,7 in this cohort the highest/worst mean CBCL scores were actually found in the 
children with a first trimester exposure.

C-sections and epidural use were present at a higher rate in the prenatally exposed children, 
but the results of the exploratory mediation analysis found that the CBCL Externalizing 
score differences in prenatally exposed children could not be significantly attributed to any 
of the mediators. There was however significant interaction when evaluating C-sections, 
meaning that the association between CBCL Externalizing scores and prenatal exposure 
to anesthesia varied significantly based on whether the mothers received a C-section. 
Specifically, this association of worse scores with prenatal exposure was stronger among 
the children who had prenatal exposure and were delivered via C-section than those who 
had prenatal exposure and were not delivered via C-section. In evaluating the children with 
prenatal exposure and C-section delivery, 5 of the 6 C-sections occurred electively due to 
prior C-sections in the mother or the positioning of the baby. In this exploratory mediation 
analysis, a clear reason for this interaction could not be identified.

This study has a number of limitations. Since anesthetic exposures during pregnancy in 
women are a relatively uncommon occurrence, it is difficult to assemble a large cohort 
of prenatally exposed children with long-term neuropsychological follow-up. Therefore, 
the first limitation is the small sample size. Despite the limited number of children 
assessed, significant differences in long-term behavioral function were still identified 
that are consistent with other studies of post-natal anesthetic exposure.18,19,27 However, 
since statistical significance depends in large part on sample size, the lack of statistical 
significance on a given outcome does not preclude the presence of an effect in a larger 
cohort. Also, while the exploratory mediation analysis found an interaction between prenatal 
exposure and C-section, these results should be interpreted with caution given the limited 
number of children with both exposures, and the lack of multiple comparisons adjustment 
in this analysis. A second limitation is the inability to distinguish between the effects of 
the anesthetic medication or uterine perfusion, inflammation, and any other stressor that the 
fetus may be exposed to during the maternal surgery. Given the lack of an anesthetic record, 
the types and doses of anesthetic medications as well as any intraoperative complications are

unknown. While all procedures were relatively minor in nature, an additional consideration 
is that since these maternal exposures occurred between 1988 and 1992, the medications 
and monitoring techniques used in these mothers may differ from those commonly used in 
present day practice. Despite the differences in clinical practice over time, these results are 
still relevant as the behavioral outcome signal found can be used to inform future studies. 
Third, since the likelihood of general anesthetic exposure was judged based on maternal 
report of the type of operation performed, there is a possibility for misclassification. 
However, the results were consistent in a sensitivity analysis evaluating all mothers claiming 
to have had general anesthetic exposure with an expected bias towards a null effect. 
Misclassification could also occur if mothers were exposed to anesthesia after the 34 week 
gestational age interview and were therefore classified as unexposed. This would bias our 
results towards a null effect but would have a limited influence on our results as this 
likely only occurred in a very small number of women. Fourth, since the CBCL is reported 
by the parent, it may be at risk of subjectivity. Since behavioral and emotional issues 
may be seen in settings such as home or school, but may not manifest in the structured 
setting of a neuropsychological evaluation, parent reported behavioral measures are standard 
and validated components of neuropsychological evaluations.28 Fifth, multiple comparisons 
adjustment was performed in order to reduce the risk of making a Type I error (finding a 
difference when there should not be one), however by applying specific adjustment methods, 
particularly to outcomes that may be correlated, a Type II error (not finding a difference 
when there should be one) could also be made. In this study we evaluated six different tests 
with a total of eleven different scores and subscores, many of which were highly correlated. 
We applied a Bonferroni adjustment and assumed six independent tests. However, there is 
no consensus on the optimal method for multiple comparisons adjustment, and the method 
used in the current study may be at risk for either a Type I or Type II error. Finally, like any 
observational studies, there may be baseline differences in exposed and unexposed children 
and mothers. No differences in post-natal surgery and resource utilization in exposed 
and unexposed children was found, but mothers who received general anesthesia during 
pregnancy reported lower levels of education and higher rates of smoking and alcohol use 
during pregnancy. While some factors were accounted for, in any observational study there 
is a potential risk of unmeasured confounding in all of our analyses.

In 2016, the FDA issued a warning about the neurodevelopmental effects of anesthetic drugs 
in “children younger than 3 years or in pregnant women during their third trimester”. This 
warning, however, was not based on empirical evidence from studies of prenatally exposed 
children, but rather on data from studies of postnatally exposed children and models of 
prenatal anesthetic exposure in animals.29,30 The long-term effects of prenatal anesthetic 
exposure in children are difficult to assess because they require identifying women with 
exposure during pregnancy followed by a long duration of follow-up in the children. 
Prenatal exposure while relatively infrequent, has important implications for understanding 
a potential mechanism of anesthetic neurotoxicity. The gestational period in humans is 
characterized by high fetal sensitivity to neurotoxic agents.9 While some neurotoxicants 
only have an effect on children during specific windows of gestation, others have an impact 
throughout all three trimesters as well as into the postnatal period.9 In preclinical studies, 
prenatal anesthetic exposure of rodents equivalent to prenatal human exposure in the second

trimester, and prenatal exposure of non-human primates equivalent to prenatal human 
exposure in the third trimester have also resulted in neuronal cell death and behavioral 
changes.29,30 At this time, the FDA only warns against prenatal anesthetic exposures in 
the third trimester. Given that the potential mechanism behind anesthetic neurotoxicity 
and the exact window of vulnerability in children remain unclear, this recommendation is 
based more on a lack of published studies evaluating neurotoxicity after first and second 
trimester exposures as opposed to convincing evidence of the safety of anesthetic exposures 
in children during those time periods.

In this study, prenatal anesthetic exposures were associated with worse long-term behavioral 
scores in children. While these results provide evidence in support of the FDA warning 
against prenatal exposure, they also question whether only children exposed in the third 
trimester may be at risk of long-term neurodevelopmental effects. Despite these findings, it 
is important to note that since this study has limitations, and delaying or avoiding necessary 
surgery in pregnant woman can have significant detrimental effects on the mother and the 
fetus, no changes to clinical practice should be made until these results are confirmed by 
other similar studies.

Question:

Key points:

Is prenatal exposure to surgery and anesthesia associated with long-term 
neurodevelopmental deficits?

Findings:

Children with prenatal exposure to general anesthesia due to maternal surgery during 
pregnancy had more externalizing behavioral problems at 10 years of age compared to 
unexposed children.

Meaning:

This provides preliminary epidemiologic evidence that anesthetic exposure during 
pregnancy may be associated with a child’s long-term development.
