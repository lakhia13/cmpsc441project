## What is autism spectrum disorder?


Autism spectrum disorder is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a “developmental disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life.

## Why is NIMH studying autism?


People with autism have a wide range of symptoms, which can include differences in social and communication behaviors, intellectual disabilities, and other physical and mental health conditions. People with autism also have a wide range of health care and service needs. Research shows that access to needed services and supports early in life can promote people’s health and well-being over the long term.


## How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic?


We’re supporting research to better understand the full range of symptoms that people with autism may experience. This includes research to identify biological and behavioral characteristics that can help us understand a person’s symptoms, how their symptoms and needs may change over time, and which treatments, services, and supports they may benefit from.

We’re also supporting research to find better ways to meet the individual needs of people with autism. This includes research to improve early autism screening so that children with autism can be connected with appropriate services and supports as early as possible. This also includes research on supporting people with autism as they age, from childhood to adolescence and throughout adulthood. NIMH is also investing in research to better meet the needs of autistic people who have co-occurring mental health conditions.

NIMH supports theAutism Centers of Excellence Program, an NIH-wide initiative funding large-scale, multidisciplinary studies on autism spectrum disorder.
