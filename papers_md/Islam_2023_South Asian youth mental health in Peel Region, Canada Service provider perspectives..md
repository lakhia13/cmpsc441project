Abstract
The Peel Region of Toronto, Canada is home to over a third of the province’s South Asian population. Youth are at a
vulnerable time period in terms of their mental health. South Asian youth populations may face additional challenges
to their mental health such as acculturative stress, intergenerational conﬂict, and racism and discrimination. This quali-
tative study set out to understand the mental health concerns and service access barriers experienced by South Asian
youth populations in the Peel Region of Toronto, Canada from the perspective of mental health service providers. In-
depth semi-structured interviews were carried out with mental health service providers (n = 22) who work with
South Asian youth living in Peel Region. Thematic analysis was used to elucidate themes related to mental health stressors
and service access barriers experienced by youth. According to mental health service providers, South Asian youth navi-
gate a number of unique stressors related to the domains of culture, religion, and family dynamics, experiences of dis-
crimination, the impact of migration, beliefs around mental
illness and help-seeking, help-seeking trajectories and
therapy recommendations, and lastly, sex differences. Mental health service providers outlined steps needed to effectively
address the unique mental health challenges, best practice guidelines, and recommendations for working with South Asian
youth, families, and communities to provide a practical and nuanced overview on how a multi-level strategy for mental
health care can effectively meet the needs of South Asian youth populations.

Introduction

The South Asian diaspora (e.g., from South Asian countries
such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, or Nepal)
numbers at over 30 million people globally (Rai &
Reeves, 2008). Major South Asian diaspora communities
have settled in regions such as the Arabian Gulf, Uganda,
South Africa, the Caribbean, Australia, the UK, the US,
and Canada (Rai & Reeves, 2008). Canada experienced a
major inﬂux of migration of South Asian populations in
the 1960s and 1970s (Statistics Canada, 2005). Currently,
close to 2 million people in Canada are of South Asian
origin (i.e., with origins in South Asian countries or
Indo-Caribbean roots), making up the largest segment of
Canada’s racialized populations.
racialized
populations refer to “visible minority” or non-white popula-
tions (Li, 2003). Close to 60% of the nation’s South Asian
populations reside in Ontario and over a third (1,150,415)
of the province’s South Asian populations live in Peel
Region, one of ﬁve regions making up the larger

Brampton and Mississauga and the town of Caledon, and
has some of the highest percentages of South Asian popula-
tions in the Greater Toronto Area (e.g., 44% of
the
Brampton’s population and 23% of Mississauga’s popula-
tion is South Asian) (Statistics Canada, 2019). Close to
15% of people in Brampton speak only Punjabi at home,
while Urdu is the top non-ofﬁcial language (not English or
French) spoken in Mississauga (3%) (Peel Region, 2012).
The majority of South Asian immigrant populations
arrived in Peel Region after 1980 and their numbers have
been steadily growing (Region of Peel, 2012). Peel has the
highest percentage of youth aged 15–24 (14%) in the
larger metropolitan area. The region is also growing
quickly, with 20,000 new people settling in Peel each year
(Region of Peel, 2019, 2017).

As South Asian communities in Peel Region continue to
grow, there is a need to effectively address the mental health
needs and well-being of these communities, particularly for
youth (Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2016a;
Region of Peel, 2017). Exposure to a conﬂuence of phys-
ical, emotional, and social changes
(e.g., violence,
trauma, abuse, poverty, etc.) can make youth and young
adults vulnerable to mental health issues (World Health
Organization, 2020). By the age of 25, one in ﬁve
Canadians report a mental illness, and 70% report that
symptoms ﬁrst began in childhood (Mental Health
Commission of Canada, 2016b). Immigrant youth in par-
ticular are exposed to multiple risk factors for mental
health problems (Shakya et al., 2010). Linguistic barriers,
especially within the education system and labor market,
have been linked to mental health challenges facing new-
comer youth. Challenges such as income insecurity,
unemployment, underemployment, and precarious employ-
ment have signiﬁcant mental health implications for both
youth and their families (e.g., depression, family tensions,
and other mental health stresses) (Shakya et al., 2010).
Settlement stressors related to linguistic barriers, particu-
larly around navigating the Canadian education system
(the inability to establish friendships, difﬁculty following
and understanding the educator and curriculum, and bully-
ing), also position adolescents to be more susceptible to
experience stress, anxiety, and low self-esteem (Shakya
et al., 2010). However, immigrant and refugee youth have
some of the lowest rates of mental health service utilization
(Saunders et al., 2018), and are more likely to present with
their ﬁrst mental health crisis in the emergency department
compared to non-immigrants, which is associated with
poorer outcomes and can lead to gaps in continuity of
mental health care (Saunders et al., 2018).

Research focusing speciﬁcally on South Asian popula-
tions in Canada ﬁnds that
they have lower prevalence
rates of mental health service use (Grace et al., 2016;
Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2016a; Tiwari &
Wang, 2008). Gadalla (2010) found low utilization of
mental health services amongst South Asian populations,

where almost one-third of South Asians diagnosed with a
major depressive episode cited no access to available care
and had the lowest possible odds of seeking mental health
care compared to other ethnic groups (Gadalla, 2010).
This may be the result of a number of barriers that South
Asian populations face in accessing mental health services,
including inadequate awareness of services, settlement bar-
riers, lack of culturally sensitive approaches, stigma, lan-
guage barriers, unusually long wait times, and lack of
in the mental health system (Reitmanova &
trust
Gustafson, 2009; Saunders et al., 2018; Thomson et al.,
2015).

The Mental Health Commission of Canada (2015) has
suggested that improved services for immigrant, refugee,
ethnocultural, and racialized communities need to be built
across Canada using local data. Yet despite the growing
South Asian youth population in Peel Region, the vulner-
ability of youth in terms of mental health, and the consider-
able mental health service access barriers experienced by
South Asian populations, there is very little research explor-
ing the mental health concerns and service access barriers of
South Asian youth populations. Thus, this study sought to
carry out a mental health needs assessment of South Asian
youth in Peel at a systems level from the perspective of
mental health service providers. This study is part of a
larger multiphase study to understand the mental health
needs of South Asian youth. An already published leg of
the study examined interviews with South Asian youth
(Islam et al., 2017). Interviews with key informants such
as mental health service providers can offer added insight.
While youth interviews revealed many gaps within South
Asian families and communities, interviews with mental
health service providers can offer in-depth perspective
gaps within the mental health system. Considering the
the South
diverse and intersecting social
Asian diaspora, coupled with multiple experiences of
inequities navigating both the Canadian health care system
and society, an intersectional and social determinants of
health framework was employed to expand our understand-
ing of mental health inequities and highlight the limitations
of the mental health system in order to improve access to
mental health services for South Asian youth.

Methods

Theoretical frameworks

A social determinants of health approach emphasizes that
poorer health and mental health are the result of inequality,
rather than poverty. While poor social, material, and phys-
ical conditions affect the poorest the most, inequalities in
access to power and material resources affect health and
well-being such that the risks of poor mental health and
illness increase as groups experience greater
mental

370

inequalities along the entire social, economic, and political
gradient (Allen et al., 2014; Mikkonen & Raphael, 2010).
An intersectional lens (Crenshaw, 1989; Smith, 2011)
was applied to examine the ways in which the intercon-
nected and overlapping social
locations (ethnicity, sex,
class, religion, to name a few) of South Asian youth popu-
lations simultaneously intersect and compound within
systems, institutions, and processes to produce inequities
at both the micro (i.e.,
interpersonal/intrapersonal) and
macro level (structural barriers). These multiple structures
of inequalities intersect to produce hierarchical matrices
of domination (Hill Collins, 1990). We acknowledge that
these identities are both socially constructed and mutually
constitutive, shifting our focus towards issues of power,
privilege, and discrimination.

Research design and research questions

This exploratory qualitative study was carried out as part of
a larger multiphase study to understand the mental health
needs of South Asian youth. This study was designed to
answer the following research questions from the perspec-
tive of mental health service providers working with
South Asian youth populations:

1. What are the unique mental health concerns and
mental health service access barriers experienced by
South Asian youth?

2. Are there sex differences in mental health stressors

and help-seeking patterns?

3. What help-seeking trajectories do South Asian youth

take when seeking mental health care?

4. What best practice guidelines and recommendations
for
do mental health service providers offer
working with South Asian youth populations?

5. What recommendations for mental health system-
level change do mental health service providers
offer?

Sampling
As very speciﬁc criteria (having experience of working in
mental health care provision for South Asian youth in
Peel Region) was required for this study, purposive snow-
ball sampling was used to make data collection feasible,
by ﬁrst beginning with a small set of individuals selected
for their prominence and/or connectedness in the commu-
nity of providers serving this population and then expand-
ing further through their referrals and recommendations.
All participants were assured that participation was volun-
tary. Care was taken to accommodate their schedule and
select convenient meeting locations. Random sampling
was also employed through the use of recruitment ﬂyers
posted in public areas and sent by email to mainstream

(e.g., the Canadian Mental Health Association of Peel and
YMCA) and culturally speciﬁc mental health organizations
(e.g., Punjabi Community Health Services and Sayeda
Khadijah Centre, one of the largest mosques in Peel). The
recruitment ﬂyer was also posted on social media via
Twitter and on the Centre for Addiction and Mental
Health’s Evidence Exchange Network. Participant inter-
views took place from March to June 2015 and were con-
ducted at locations convenient for participants.

Rigor

In order to ensure rigor (Guba & Lincoln, 1981, 1982;
Lincoln & Guba, 1985), the recruitment process and inter-
views were offered in a variety of South Asian languages
(Punjabi, Urdu, Hindi, and Bengali) as well as English.
The positionality of the researcher was noted and revisited
throughout various stages of the research process in order to
capture initial reactions and emerging themes. The continu-
ous revisiting of one’s positionality (being both an insider
and outsider to this community) maintains trustworthiness
in the research outcome (themes) by grounding it within
the subjective perspectives and viewpoints of the services
providers while also avoiding investigative bias (Maher
et al., 2018; Nowell et al., 2017). The three ﬁrst authors ana-
lyzed the transcripts independently and conducted a process
of peer debrieﬁng to ensure consistency, and obtained con-
sensus in the analysis and interpretation before sharing it
with three senior supervisors for review and feedback.
The ﬁndings were relayed back to several participants to
ensure resonance. Member checking (Sandelowski, 1986)
was also carried out by presenting ﬁndings of this study
to both South Asian and other racialized audiences living
across Toronto in multiple community forums. All youth
and adults expressed that the ﬁndings resonated with their
life experiences. Moreover, while some time has passed
since this data was initially collected, the researchers have
continued member checking with mental health service pro-
viders and South Asian youth in Peel Region since data col-
lection, who assert
the issues raised in these key
informant
interviews still remain as pressing as ever.
While the COVID-19 pandemic has placed a greater spot-
light on the urgent need for accessible mental health care
and many are concerned over the long-term consequences
of online schooling and isolation felt by youth during the
pandemic,
the concerns raised by participants in this
study still remain relevant and the gaps in South Asian
youth mental health care still need to be addressed.

Interviews and focus groups

A semi-structured in-depth interview / focus group guide
was developed to investigate the study’s research questions,
using Harrell and Bradley’s (2009) interview guide. The
interview asked participants about the following topics:

pathways to care, mental health and recovery, barriers to
and facilitators of seeking mental health care, knowledge
of the mental health system and services, stigma, mental
health care experience, current practices, and recommenda-
tions. All participants in this leg of the study opted for inter-
views in English. Interviews lasted on average an hour and
a half and were audio-recorded. The mp3 ﬁles were tran-
scribed verbatim for analysis.

Data analysis

Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006, 2013) was used
to identify, analyze, and report patterns within the interview
transcripts guided by the research questions. Coding was
based on the research questions of interest. A constant com-
parative technique and iterative reﬁnement process were
used throughout. Qualitative analysis was done manually,
and codes were organized into subthemes and overarching
themes. Themes or patterns related to the ﬁve research
questions outlined above were searched for in the tran-
scripts. A thematic map was ﬁnalized, and detailed analyses
were written for each theme.

Ethics

Research ethics were submitted and approved by the Centre
for Addiction and Mental Health’s Research Ethics Board.
Written informed consent was obtained from all partici-
pants and verbal consent was additionally obtained prior

to audio recording the interviews. To ensure conﬁdentiality,
participants were asked to only use their ﬁrst names in the

working with youth with severe mental
Over 70% of the participants were women (16 out of 22).

The same semi-structured interview protocol was used
for both interview and focus group sessions. Thematic tri-
angulation of focus group and interview data was pursued
in this study to achieve analytical
richness (Denzin,
1978). When transcripts were analyzed, the themes that
emerged from the interview and focus groups converged.
Therefore the results are discussed together.

This study is unique in that the majority of participants
(over 75%) were from South Asian populations themselves
and most worked with South Asian youth within commu-
nity settings. All service providers practiced in Peel, and
some had experience working in other parts of Toronto,
such as Scarborough, Orangeville, and Etobicoke. Some
service providers were practicing in multiple locations at
the time of the interview. The participants ranged from
having 1.5 to 30 years of experience working with South
Asian youth (median 7.5 years; SD 7.1).

Major themes

Participants outlined six areas of uniqueness that mental
health professionals need to be aware of to better serve
South Asian youth populations: A) South Asian culture,
religion, and family dynamics, B) experiences of discrimin-
ation, C) impact of migration, D) beliefs around mental
illness and help-seeking, E) help-seeking trajectories and
therapy recommendations, and F) sex differences. The the-
matic map is summarized in Figure 1.

Mental health service providers pointed out barriers and
had recommendations for all levels of society, covering sys-
issues, as well as family- and
temic and structural
community-level barriers. Those who worked within a
mainstream hospital or clinical setting often had more
systemic-level barriers to share, while those who were com-
munity mental health workers had a rich understanding of
family-level barriers. No level was more emphasized than
others, and participants did not place blame upon youth.
Rather, a systems approach that requires a holistic and
multi-level effort to ensure the mental health of South
Asian youth was discussed in all interviews.

Culture, religion, and family dynamics. According to service
providers, South Asian youth growing up in Canada face
not only a generation gap but also an added layer of cultural
clash at home. As one mental health practitioner stated,
“First generation parents … just want to keep their family
together, like a fear of their children assimilating.”

South Asian parents may use parenting styles and discip-
line techniques, encouraging dependence and obedience.
Service providers shared that
the constant comparison,
judgment, and perfectionism are sources of stress for youth.

… culturally, South Asian youth have a lot more pressure
from their parents in terms of academics, just that perfec-
tionism is kind of required. So yes, I get a lot of kids
coming in with anxiety [and] some of them coming in
with depression. They just don’t know how to organize
their schedule and they feel overwhelmed. (School guid-
ance counselor)

Service providers recounted clients who struggle with
leading a “double life”—one life that is amenable to their
parents and another to their peers. This split identity is
the source of conﬂict and guilt for many youth. As one pro-
vider shared, “Parents want to impose their own values
while youth here have to face a completely different
culture/atmosphere in school … causing a clash between
the youth and parents.”

[Youth] lose their autonomy, [they feel] they are losing
their identity … and are struggling to recapture [their iden-
tity] and yet be respectful of their traditions and the parental
role. But we also have [youth] who were angry with their
their
parents,
privacy,
(Focus group, youth mental
health social worker)

[who they feel are] very intrusive of
their autonomy.

Several participants also noted that intimate partner vio-
lence (domestic violence) is prevalent in South Asian fam-
ilies and care needs to be taken to identify this stigmatized
issue. One school guidance counselor recounted, “… a
higher number of [my clients] were South Asians and
there was a lot of domestic violence.”

It was interesting to note that regardless of participants’
own religious afﬁliations, the vast majority of mental health
service providers emphasized the importance of faith-based
coping and spiritualty for South Asian youth and the need to
incorporate spiritual practices into therapy. The majority of
participants also recommended that mainstream and com-
munity mental health organizations need to build bridges
with faith leaders and places of worship in order to destig-
matize mental health and bring services into South Asian
communities: “Especially for South Asians who are very
spiritual, why not get them to attend the spiritual center
and help them there? If that is their comfort zone? That’s
they don’t do
huge. Our spiritual
that” (Social worker).

leaders and whatnot

Discrimination. Service providers were mixed on the experi-
ences of racism by South Asian youth in Peel. Several par-
ticipants felt that because of the high percentage of South
Asian populations in Peel, South Asians did not experience
racism, but rather faced issues such as class and caste dis-
crimination and shadeism within their own communities.
Shadeism is discrimination based on skin color, usually
within one’s own race. This discrimination sets up a dichot-

disadvantaging South Asians with darker skin color, and is
rooted in a long history of anti-blackness, colonialism, and
class discrimination. These issues can contribute to mental
health issues, such as bullying, as recounted by one guid-
ance counselor:

For example South Asian youth that are maybe from the
northern areas like Afghanistan may not face the same
issues as, say, a child who’s from Bangladesh … They do
often face prejudice based on the color of their skin …
where they are from … the language that they speak or
what they don’t speak. (School guidance counselor)

On the other hand, several service providers felt that in
addition to this discrimination, South Asian youth in Peel
also faced racism from the larger non-South Asian popula-
tion. Participants recounted that many South Asian youth
face discrimination and are bullied for being racialized as
South Asian or a religious minority, particularly if they
engage in visible religious practices (e.g., wearing a
turban or hijab) and that this often manifests in the young
person as anger or aggression.

Our South Asian population in Peel Region is large [in]
number, but in our schools we still face kids wearing
hijabs or turbans being bullied … Having the turban
pulled off by other kids and the teacher not understanding

374

why that is an issue … Kids bullying the girls to take off the
hijab to the point where the kids feel like you know “it
might not be safe for me to wear that” … Parents think
“Why aren’t you wearing it?” and the girls would be chan-
ging in and out of [their hijab at] school. The line of com-
munication, I ﬁnd,
is very severed sometimes. (Focus

by
Participants observed that the struggle to secure economic
integration means that new parents lack support, often
work multiple jobs, and are unable to devote time to
raising their children: “I think that for immigrant parents
they’re dealing with a lot … they only know what they
know at that point, based on their own limitations … that
impacts on their parenting, their decisions, and their avail-
ability” (Mental health practitioner, private practice).

Moreover, the struggle to secure economic integration
often leads to feelings of powerlessness for parents,
which manifests as impossibly high expectations. South
Asian youth struggle to ﬁnd their own identity amid the
crushing weight of these expectations and their parents’
need to project a certain image of “success” to their families
back home.

Family played a huge part in the stress that triggered some
of the depression and anxiety, especially around high
expectations. Parents were often ﬁrst generation here in
Canada so the young people … really felt that added pres-
sure you know, “My parents sacriﬁced their life,” “They
worked as a cab driver,” or “They gave up their dream so
I have to fulﬁll that,” and that puts a lot of weight on an
individual at that age when they are trying to ﬁgure out
who they are just in terms of their developmental stages.
They’re trying to ﬁgure out who they are in this world.
They have this added layer of you know my parents want
me to be this person. Another piece I found kind of interest-
ing … particularly [for] males, the pressure of what people
back home were also thinking. So extended family, whether
it’s grandparents, uncles, aunts. They were the family that
moved to the Western world and there’s a particular
image that’s meant to be maintained around that. (Mental
health practitioner, private practice)

Some participants mentioned that the immigrant outlook
on saving money, even when economically secure, can be
challenging for youth, who feel deprived when they
compare themselves to their peers:

… some of the parents are sort of okay ﬁnancially … But
that back home mentality that you have to save every
penny … we have to save, we don’t have enough! … It

really, really affects [youth]. It’s bad. They don’t go out
anywhere. They don’t get to go on school trips or get any-
thing. (Mental health counselor at place of worship)

Beliefs around mental illness and help-seeking and knowledge
of mental health. Mental health service providers felt that
certain beliefs regarding mental illness and help-seeking
may make accessing care challenging for South Asian fam-
ilies. The belief that marriage was a “cure” for mental
illness, especially for young women, was one concern
that participants raised:

[The community] will preach marriage as the ideal and the
solution to everything … I feel that healing does not exist as
a term sometimes … there are just too many quick ﬁxes and
not trying to understand what is actually going on here.
(Peer counselor, cultural-speciﬁc mental health helpline)

Parents are hesitant to seek help from mainstream ser-
vices, fearing breach of conﬁdentiality. They reported that
families are often concerned about projecting the image
of perfection and reluctant to seek care because a diagnosis
may sabotage their child’s chances for “success.” This was
also gendered, with parents fearing their daughters would
not marry and their sons would not ﬁnd employment.
One mental health counselor at a place of worship described
how some parents, after hearing their children are seeking
counseling, feel the need “to start hiding”: “[They fear
their children] will change … [that the counselor will]
turn [their children] against [them]—those are the fears.
And a fear of … telling personal stuff. They don’t
perhaps understand conﬁdentiality” (Mental health coun-
selor, place of worship).

Some youth and parents may also be distrustful of
Western psychiatry and the use of psychotropic medication.
South Asian families may hold beliefs of spiritual causation
of mental illness and attempt traditional healing or seek
treatment out of the country. One provider recounted a
client who told him that “psychiatric medications are a
tool of the jinn [spirits in Islamic spirituality].”

Service providers noted that if the youth is able to access
care, they will often encounter further barriers, such as
parents’ dismissal of the diagnosis. The family may be
unable to recognize the mental health issue as a chronic
condition that needs ongoing management and see it as a
result of common stressors that are part of adolescence
(e.g., academic pressure) instead.

… parents don’t agree with counseling; they ask, “What’s
this talk of feelings and mental health?” [Youth]
all
would love to come [for counseling] but they would have
to hide from their families and lie to them so it is difﬁcult.
(Mental health counselor, place of worship)

Islam et al.

375

If the family accepts the diagnosis, they may catastro-
phize by focusing on the illness and be unable to envision
recovery. For example, one hospital youth trauma social
worker said she was once asked by a mother, “Does it
mean my child is crazy?” The parents may insist that
mental health professionals “ﬁx” their child and not take
part in a collaborative recovery process. Service providers
reported that
the underdeveloped mental health system
and lack of mental health awareness in the family’s
country of origin also present problems, as the family is
unaware of family history of mental illness or reluctant to
disclose family issues. Community stigma and silence
over domestic violence and the overlay of toxic masculinity
with alcoholism in South Asian families also presents
challenges.

Service providers suggested that one area of opportunity
for mental health intervention is the deference South Asian
parents have for doctors. Psychoeducation and mental
health resource linking provided by the family doctor can
act as a potential area of intervention. Another key area of
uniqueness for South Asian youth is their connection with
their family and spirituality. Service providers recommend
that youth be reconnected with their family and faith as a
part of the recovery process. Participants felt that liaisons
with the South Asian community and mental health organi-
zations could help to break down mental health stigma.
Mainstream services can foster respect for South Asian
understandings and co-create mental health resources.
Community and faith spaces are often on the frontlines of
mental health work, and in the absence of culturally safe
models of care from mainstream organizations, community
spaces have taken the brunt of serving the community’s
needs without the funding and support mainstream organi-
zations receive. Rather than working in silos, mainstream
mental health organizations can build trust by building
bridges into areas where the community congregates.

So we have to think of where do families go for help before
they come here [to mainstream services]? Before they go to
a doctor, where do they go? Coz if [mainstream services]
are going to be respectful of [South Asian] religious
leaders and community leaders, then you’ve got to start
thinking of going into the community and bridge-building
somehow … offer to go in, start exploring what they are
telling families … what they are offering. (Focus group,
youth mental health social worker)

Lastly, service providers identiﬁed the lack of mental
health literacy and knowledge of mental health resources
available in Peel as a signiﬁcant barrier. Service providers
in the individual and focus group interview rated the
average level of mental health resource knowledge of
South Asian youth on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being no knowl-
edge at all and 5 being they are experts), and rated youth at a

poor level of knowledge with an average rating of 1.73 (SD
0.95).

Help-seeking trajectories and therapy
recommendations.
Service providers lent their insights on the varying trajector-
ies that South Asian youth take in seeking mental health
care. All service providers agreed that most youth ﬁrst
seek mental health information online (e.g., Google, blogs
/ video blogs, YouTube, social media, etc.) and then go to
their peers for advice.

Although all agreed that youth used online information
sources, younger service providers were more likely than
older respondents to recommend building on this tendency
by developing social media and online mental health tools
to reach youth.

[To ﬁnd mental health information, youth go] Online. They
try to self-medicate. They try to manage their depression
through Googling and online because they don’t want to
talk to other people about it. They want control over it. I
ﬁnd. So making sure that we have good information
online [is important]. (Focus group, children’s mental
health social worker)

After searching online, youth vary in their trajectories.
Some may conﬁde in their friends or parents, others may
seek counsel from a spiritual leader, while others go to
the school counselor. Much later, youth may arrive at the
doors of a community or mainstream mental health organ-
ization or professional’s ofﬁce. Generally, service providers
felt that South Asian youth took anywhere from six months
to a year to ﬁnally seek professional mental health care.

[Youth] usually don’t go to anyone and suffer on their own,
alone … The next step, if they have the conﬁdence to
approach their peer group … Then they may approach a
family friend or a parent … Some may go to the imam
[Muslim spiritual leader] at the masjid [mosque] … They
don’t usually ﬁnd that as useful because they already
heard the same thing from their parents. That is what my
clients say. (laughs) And then … someone will tell them,
there is counseling being offered at [the mosque], then
they will come to me … But I am usually the last person
to know, the last person they get to. (Mental health coun-
selor at place of worship)

Mental health service providers also mentioned add-
itional trajectories. Sometimes a precipitating event served
as a wakeup call for parents, such as their child being
involved in a crime, or failing or dropping out of school.
The parents sometimes opted to ﬁrst seek advice from the
family doctor rather than go to specialized mental health
services. Other times, the mental health issue led to a
point of crisis (e.g., suicide attempt or psychosis) which
then ﬁnally provided the impetus for the family to take

376

Transcultural Psychiatry 60(2)

their child to the emergency department to seek mental
health care. Service providers lamented the poor prognosis
associated with emergency department visits, which can
often be traumatic and impede continuity of care following
hospital discharge.

Service providers had varied recommendations for
therapy modalities when working with South Asian
youth. Some participants felt that Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy (CBT) was useful in helping youth brainstorm
and problem solve. Others felt that CBT and Dialectical
Behavioral Therapy (DBT) may work for South Asian
youth but family therapy work also needs to be included:
“I think systemic family therapy really works; I ﬁnd that
working with South Asian families, youth, CBT, DBT are
really useful
to reduce mental health symptoms and
harmful behaviors but you also have to do some family
work” (Youth program coordinator).

The inclusion of religiously integrated care was also
recommended, as faith-based coping is important to South
Asian youth. Lastly, several participants felt
that CBT
was not helpful for South Asian youth as it places too
much emphasis on the individual, invalidates emotions/
experiences, and silences personal stories. Therapeutic
approaches such as narrative therapy and mindfulness
were emphasized instead, for their ability to empower
youth. As one hospital social worker stated, “Narrative
takes a long time but it provides context and background
which is crucial.”

Sex differences. From their experience, service providers
identiﬁed key differences in the mental health concerns
that young South Asian men and women face. While
72% of the sample were women, both men and women
spoke about the importance of considering South Asian
constructions of gender roles and the different stressors
they place on young South Asian men and women.

I think there is a bit of difference in terms of challenges
faced by men and women. I feel like most of the females
are associated with a relationship issue and how to navigate
those … [for example] arranged marriage or love marriage.
For boys, it is substance-related [issues] that … [impact
their] mental health and wellbeing [and may be used as a]
coping strategy. (Focus group, children’s mental health
social worker)

stated, “Some enter into a marriage, [e]specially … young
South Asian females. There is a lot more pressure on
them, depending on culture and religiously.” As many
South Asian populations come from cultures and faith back-
grounds that emphasize abstinence before marriage, there is
a strong push to get married young.

In contrast, the major source of parental clash for young
South Asian men usually occurred over academic and
career success, facing extreme pressure to be a “success”
and to take on the “breadwinning role and support the
family” and live up to “that stereotype of what masculinity
is,” as one social worker who works with children stated
during a focus group. At the same time, service providers
felt that young South Asian men were coddled at home, par-
ticularly by their mothers, and conditioned to be overly
dependent. One mental health practitioner described how
young South Asian men struggle with a sense of “entitle-
ment” where they have grown up “being allowed to kind
of do what they’re doing, no limitations no sanctions, no
repercussions, no punishment.” One participant during the
focus group with social workers working with youth
illness expressed how some
living with severe mental
young men “struggle with expressing their independence
… because as a boy [they] never had to do … laundry or
cook for [them]selves.”

A few service providers emphasized the need to start
early intervention, helping parents to nurture the attachment
and mental health of infants and children to mitigate youth
mental health issues down the road. Several participants
also stressed the need to address the poor communication
between parents and children within South Asian families.
Communication breakdown often occurred around gender
roles and parental control, where young women clashed
with parents over dating/marriage and restrictions on their
social life, while young men were fed messages of toxic
masculinity which socialized them to believe that it is not
masculine to communicate emotions or feelings. In homes
struggling with alcoholism and binge drinking, young
South Asian men dealt with toxic masculinity and negative
role modeling from men in the family. Often, young South
Asian men turned to unhealthy coping mechanisms (e.g.,
substance use, violence, or pornography) to self-medicate
and numb the pain of their struggles. Young South Asian
men were less likely to conﬁde in someone about their
mental health issues.

According to service providers, young South Asian
women were more likely to be concerned about their iden-
tity, faced culture clash and family conﬂict over gender
roles and expectations for young women, and faced
extreme pressure and parental regulation in regards to mar-
riage. However, the extent to which young women faced
these pressures varied widely as a result of other social
identities, reﬂecting the importance of maintaining an inter-
sectional lens. As one social worker in the focus group

Youth often [talk to] their friends. Boys, however, are more
closed. Oftentimes they turn to alcohol and drugs to numb
the issue. This is generational and systemic. Males in the
family often engage in drinking and binge drinking or
drugs. This is common for South Asian males. They’ll
say, “Well, my dad and uncle drink. Why can’t I?” There
is a real need for education here. (Hospital youth trauma
social worker)

Islam et al.

377

In contrast, young South Asian women were more likely
to engage in self-harm (e.g., cutting) to deal with their pain.
In regards to therapeutic practice, service providers felt that
relationship and motivational counseling work well for
young South Asian women, while young South Asian
men need to be pushed more and challenged outside their
comfort zones during counseling.

Discussion
This study presents mental health service providers’ per-
spectives on the barriers South Asian youth face in trying
to access mental health care in Peel Region, Toronto,
Canada. In particular, the study ﬁndings reﬂect unique
insights from service providers of South Asian background,
many of whom are trying to bridge siloes between main-
stream mental health services and the culturally speciﬁc
mental health needs of diverse South Asian communities.
According to mental health service providers, South
Asian youth navigate a number of unique stressors related
to the domains of culture, religion, and family dynamics,
the impact of migration,
experiences of discrimination,
beliefs around mental
illness and help-seeking, help-
seeking trajectories and therapy recommendations, and
lastly, sex differences. The steps needed to effectively
address the unique mental health challenges, best practice
guidelines, and recommendations for working with South
Asian youth, families, and communities were outlined to
provide a practical, nuanced, and a frontline-based over-
view on how mental health care can effectively meet the
needs of South Asian youth populations.

Service providers identiﬁed an array of mental health
service access barriers experienced by South Asian youth
at the levels of family, community, and the mental health
system. These echoed the views of the South Asian youth
interviewed in another branch of this project (Islam et al.,
2017). Youth reported systemic barriers such as long wait
times, prohibitive fees, and the lack of culturally safe
mental health care provision, in addition to the family-level
barriers of mental health stigma and lack of mental health
literacy. In line with the ﬁndings of this study, a study
among South Asian youth living in the US also found
that mental health stigma and fears around breach of conﬁ-
dentiality were major barriers (Rastogi et al., 2014). South
Asian American youth also expressed that “helicopter par-
enting,” where parents micromanage their children’s lives,
prevented young people from seeking help as they feared
their parents would take control of their therapy (Rastogi
et al., 2014). A review of access barriers experienced by
South Asian families and youth in the US found similar bar-
riers to those uncovered in this study. Sharma et al. (2020)
reported that the mental health stressors associated with
acculturation and the pressure of being a part of a “model
minority,” mental health stigma, and the need to sensitively
navigate the parental and youth generations in South Asian

families were important to consider when working with
South Asian populations. Culturally adapted family
therapy and community-based approaches were recom-
mended to best engage South Asian youth and their families
in mental health care, which echoed many of the recom-
mendations put forth by the key informants in this study.
The multiple interlocking structures of discrimination and
stressors of migration, mental health, and South Asian iden-
tity were a key factor under investigation in this study.
South Asian youth living in South Asia were bullied most
often by peers of their own cultural group for differences
in caste and class (Craig et al., 2009; Rahman et al.,
2020). South Asian youth in Peel faced this type of bullying
in addition to being bullied by peers outside of their cultural
group, for example for wearing a turban or hijab. South
Asian populations in South Asia faced many of the same
barriers to mental health service access as South Asian
youth in Peel Region, such as mental health stigma, poor
interpersonal support, and difﬁculties in accessing mental
health services (e.g., unable to commute for therapy)
(Aggarwal, 2012). The preference to seek alternatives to
medical/psychiatric care was also observed in South Asia,
with people opting for community and/or spiritual therapy
(Rahman, 2007; Wasan et al., 2009). In this study, most
South Asian youth also went through several care options
(e.g., online, peers, trusted adult, school counselor, spiritual
leader) before seeking specialized mental health care.
Programs to decrease mental health stigma,
increase
mental health service access (for example through the use
of mobile technology), and increase mental health literacy
(Aggarwal, 2012) could all beneﬁt South Asian populations
living in South Asia as well as in the diaspora.

In addition to the mental health challenges that all youth
face, service providers identiﬁed key areas of uniqueness
for South Asian youth in the domains of culture (e.g.,
arranged marriage), religion, and experiences of discrimin-
ation (e.g., caste-based discrimination and shadeism spe-
ciﬁc to the South Asian context), family dynamics, the
impact of migration, and beliefs around mental illness and
help-seeking. South Asian youth interviewed in an earlier
leg of this study also identiﬁed acculturative stress and
intergenerational conﬂict as major sources of stress in
their lives (Islam et al., 2017). South Asian youth living
in the U.S. described cultural clash and intergenerational
conﬂict as major mental health stressors, especially in the
domains of dating and academic success (Rastogi et al.,
2014). In Asian families, family duty and pressure are
often emphasized over autonomy so that the family can
function as a unit, and this can lead to conﬂict between
parents and youth (Ekanayake et al., 2012; Tran et al.,
into great
2005). Service providers in this study went
detail about the sex differences in mental health concerns
experienced by South Asian youth, which were often con-
nected to differing gender roles and expectations. The use
of tools such as the Cultural Values Conﬂict Scale (Inman

378

Transcultural Psychiatry 60(2)

et al., 2001) may help clinicians and service providers better
assess the stress that South Asian youth undergo as they try
to negotiate gender role expectations.

language barriers,

South Asian immigrants struggling to achieve economic
integration in Canada face increased intergenerational
tension and isolation when their children begin to adapt to
the new culture and become strangers to them (Islam
et al., 2020, 2021; Shariff, 2009). There is strong evidence
that compounding layers of structural barriers and discrimi-
nations (racism in hiring processes, non-recognition of
international credentials,
information
barriers,
limited social connection and social support
system) prevent racialized and immigrant communities in
Canada from obtaining well-paid, meaningful employment
in their ﬁeld. As documented in our study, the powerless-
ness of under/unemployment often leads parents from
immigrant and racialized backgrounds to try to control
their children to hold onto what bit of power they have
left. Parents living out their unrealized dreams through
their children place extreme pressure on children to
succeed according to parental expectations. In addition,
working multiple jobs to make ends meet does not allow
for optimal parenting, which can compound and contribute
to youth mental health issues. This cultural clash and inter-
generational conﬂict, which is the major stressor for South
Asian youth (Islam et al., 2017), could be mitigated if the
barriers to economic integration were reduced for migrant
communities, for example through government programs
like job-matching, skills-bridging, and affordable childcare
(Access Alliance Multicultural Health and Community
Services, 2012; Premji & Shakya, 2017; Wilson, 2011)
and by offering culturally safe early childhood education
and parenting support programs (Karoly, 2010; Mental
Health Commission of Canada, 2013).

Results from this study show that service providers from
South Asian backgrounds, particularly those based in com-
munity settings, appear to have in-depth knowledge about
mental health stressors, needs, and service barriers facing
South Asian youth, including insights about how to make
mental health services more culturally safe. Policy/decision
makers within the mental health sector, including those
responsible for developing new interventions, need to
consult with service providers who work closely with vul-
nerable communities and/or are from within vulnerable
communities themselves. Many of the participants were
providers in community spiritual centers or services that
integrated mental health and spiritual care together.
Organizations like these can act as important bridging
sites. Working synergistically, mainstream mental health
organizations with their funding and resources can partner
with community and spiritual organizations, which are pro-
viding frontline mental health care and have built trust
within South Asian communities. They can work together
to provide care for South Asian youth populations.
Service providers emphasized the need to develop

culturally safe models of mental health care and, regardless
of their own personal religious beliefs, recommended that
spiritually integrated, holistic mental health care may be
the most effective for South Asian youth. The development
of culturally safe models of mental health care is also
recommended in Canada’s Mental Health Strategy
(Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2015). Rathod
et al. (2010) found that CBT can be impactful for racialized
communities when adapted to be culturally appropriate and
speciﬁc to patient needs. Religious adaptations of CBT
have been developed (Haque et al., 2016; Pargament
et al., 2000; Pearce, 2015) and, more speciﬁcally, CBT
has been adapted to meet
the needs of South Asian
Muslim populations (Naeem et al., 2015). In the present
study, one service provider noted that South Asian youth
often felt that their emotions/experiences were invalidated
by CBT. Recommendations were given for greater space
to share personal narratives within CBT and for consider-
ation of the interdependent nature of family life especially
for South Asian youth, rather than focusing solely on indi-
vidualistic behavioral change and goal-setting. Cultural
adaptation of CBT that incorporates elements of empower-
ment, narrative therapy, and mindfulness may be beneﬁcial
in working with South Asian youth.

Considering the common conﬂicts that South Asian fam-
ilies experience at home, counseling techniques aimed at
increasing communication and empathy between parents
and youth may be helpful. Furthermore, to provide cultur-
ally safe care suited to South Asian youth populations, sen-
sitizing therapy to conﬂicts experienced through the
acculturation process, adolescent ethnic identiﬁcation, par-
enting stress, and the roles and expectations placed upon
different family members needs to be considered (Shariff,
2009).

The impact of migration on youth mental health as a
result of acculturation and the stressors of the migration
and resettlement process begins long before adolescence.
Service providers recommended that an early childhood
mental health promotion approach be taken. In order to
effectively prevent youth mental health issues, the work
needs to start from birth. Parents need to be offered
mental health education at the hospital post-birth to foster
infant mental health care and positive parenting. The
Triple P – Positive Parenting Program® has been recom-
mended by the Public Health Agency of Canada as an
evidence-based best practice intervention for parents of
young children to adolescents (Public Health Agency of
Canada, 2013), and has been adapted for racialized and
low-income settings (Houlding et al., 2012; Public Health
Agency of Canada, 2013; Sanders et al., 2014; Triple P
Canada, 2021). Based on the recommendations from this
study, developing a culturally safe adaptation of
the
Triple P – Positive Parenting Program® tailored towards
South Asian families in Canada, which incorporates
modules on intergenerational conﬂict, cultural clash, faith-

based coping, and other unique factors, could be a powerful
mental health intervention for South Asian families.

Future research can carry out program evaluations of
mental health services that tailor their programming for
South Asian youth in Peel Region using the best practices
and recommendations outlined in this study. It would be
important to understand if such tailored programming is
more effective, has lower dropout rates, and higher rates
of recovery. Studies on the best methods for bridging
between mainstream mental health services and culturally
speciﬁc or
faith-based organizations doing frontline
mental health work would help to advance the ﬁeld.
Future research with South Asian families of youth in
mental health services to understand the barriers they
faced and the recommendations they have for improvement
would also be helpful.

interpretation of

This study has a number of limitations. This was a quali-
tative study of service provider perceptions, which may be
susceptible to recall bias. However, triangulation of infor-
mation was carried out with ﬁndings from the research pro-
ject’s previous phase with South Asian youth (Islam et al.,
2017), as well as through using both individual interviews
and focus groups to gather data. The majority of the
service providers identiﬁed as South Asian themselves
and worked within community settings, and as a result,
over-identiﬁcation and personal
their
clients’ experiences may have taken place. While cultural/
linguistic/religious matching can be a facilitator of mental
health care (Minnis et al., 2003; Rehman, 2007), it can
also serve as a barrier when the client worries that there
will be a breach of conﬁdentiality that can lead to gossip
and judgment from the community (Gulliver et al., 2010;
Islam et al., 2020). In such cases, optimal
therapeutic
rapport and trust may not be achieved and the client may
inhibited from openly sharing their experiences.
feel
However, the South Asian providers’ insider/outsider dual
positionality allowed them a more nuanced framing to
their insights. This insider/outsider aspect of the study is
also a unique strength in that most of the service provider
participants were from the communities that their clients
were from (in terms of region of origin, culture, ethnicity,
religion etc.) and working within community settings.

Conclusion

Most studies focus on mainstream providers/settings and
thus their key recommendations are limited to saying that
services need to be made more culturally sensitive and
highlighting the need for service providers from diverse
backgrounds. However, this study goes beyond cultural
appropriateness and covers mental health barriers that
persist even when South Asian mental health professionals
are providing care to South Asian youth within community
(e.g., mosques, culturally/religiously speciﬁc
settings
schools, etc.). Studies like this lay the groundwork to

the deeper

structural determinants and the
uncover
complex intersectional relationship between these determi-
nants that affect mental health and mental health care
access. This article provides service provider insights on
the need for a multi-level and culturally safe approach to
counseling and mental health intervention that considers
the unique stressors experienced by South Asian diaspora
families living in cosmopolitan cities like the Peel Region
of Canada.
