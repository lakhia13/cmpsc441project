Abstract
Narcolepsy is a rare, chronic, and disabling central nervous system hypersomnia; two forms can be recognized: narcolepsy 
type 1 (NT1) and narcolepsy type 2 (NT2). Its etiology is still largely unknown, but studies have reported a strong associa-
tion between NT1 and HLA, as well as a pathogenic association with the deficiency of cerebrospinal hypocretin-1. Thus, 
the most reliable pathogenic hypothesis is an autoimmune process destroying hypothalamic hypocretin-producing cells. A 
definitive cure for narcolepsy is not available to date, and although the research in the field is highly promising, up to now, 
current treatments have aimed to reduce the symptoms by means of different pharmacological approaches. Moreover, over-
all narcolepsy symptoms management can also benefit from non-pharmacological approaches such as cognitive behavioral 
therapies (CBTs) and psychosocial interventions to improve the patients’ quality of life in both adult and pediatric-affected 
individuals as well as the well-being of their families. In this review, we summarize the available therapeutic options for 
narcolepsy, including the pharmacological, behavioral, and psychosocial interventions.

Introduction

Narcolepsy is a severe, chronic, and rare disorder, classi-
fied by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders 
Third Edition (ICSD-III) [1] within the central disorders 
of hypersomnolence (CDH). Narcolepsy is categorized in 
narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) and in narcolepsy type 2 (NT2). 
NT1  is  biologically  marked  by  low  cerebrospinal  fluid 
hypocretin-1 levels (CSF hcrt-1), caused by the selective 
loss of hypothalamic neurons producing hypocretins, while 
NT2 is associated with normal levels of CSF hcrt-1 [1]. 
Narcolepsy core symptoms are excessive daytime sleepi-
ness (EDS), cataplexy, sleep paralyses, hallucinations, and

disrupted nocturnal sleep including frequent parasomnias. 
Cataplexy, defined as brief episodes of muscle atonia evoked 
by strong, mainly positive, emotions, is the pathognomonic 
symptom of NT1, while NT2 does not present with strictly 
defined cataplexy. Hypocretin-1 contributes to several func-
tions, including circadian rhythm regulation, arousal and 
appetite control, as well as mood and behavior modulation 
[2–4]. This neurotransmitter also influences serotonin, his-
tamine, dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate 
release [5, 6]. The hypocretin-producing cell destruction 
contributes to most of the symptoms of narcolepsy, includ-
ing EDS with sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs), and 
other symptoms reflecting exaggerated REM sleep pressure 
such as cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic/hypnopompic 
hallucinations, and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), 
all disclosing an intrinsic overlap between REM sleep and 
other states.

Narcolepsy onset usually occurs between 10 and 20 years 
of age, although the diagnosis is mostly established with a 
substantial delay (mean of 10–15 years). Narcolepsy, as a 
rare disease, has a prevalence that varies from geographical 
regions ranging from 0.02 to 0.06% in Europe and the USA 
[8], to 0.16–0.18% in Japan [7]. NT1 is considered more fre-
quent than NT2, both in adults and in children [9], although

real prevalence rates are missing and both disorders may be 
largely underestimated.

The etiology of narcolepsy is still unknown, but recent 
studies have suggested an autoimmune hypothesis. Indeed, 
NT1 is strongly associated with the human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA) DQB1*0602 allele and other genetic features point-
ing to a specific configuration of the immune system, and 
environmental risk factors, such as upper airway infections, 
may act as triggers leading to the destruction of hypotha-
lamic hypocretin-producing neurons [10]. On the other hand, 
the pathophysiology of NT2 is still unclear, and within this 
diagnosis, some subjects may be in a prodromic phase of 
NT1 (with subsequent appearance of cataplexy) [11].

NT1 is also associated with significant medical comor-
bidities, such as obesity, precocious puberty (in the child-
hood onset form), and cardiovascular problems [12], as well  
as  with  psychological  consequences  all  to  psychiat-
ric  diseases  [13].  Narcolepsy  has  a  severe  impact  on 
patients’ quality of life, with impairment in performance  
(e.g., at school, at work, at home) and psychosocial difficul-
ties [14]. Patients also report additional non-sleep related 
aspects (i.e., decreased sexual activity or memory com-
plaints) that negatively impact on disease perception and 
quality of life [15], and patients’ unmet needs could benefit  
from new multidisciplinary management strategies [16, 17]. 
Indeed, pharmacological symptom management per se may  
be insufficient to allow for normal everyday life, so behav- 
ioral therapies and interventions remain crucial.

This review seeks to offer clinicians an overview of the 
available pharmacological treatments for narcolepsy core 
symptoms (i.e., EDS and cataplexy) in adult and pediatric 
patients, and to provide a summary of some useful behavio-
ral and psychosocial interventions.

Methods

The  first  author  (CF)  performed  a  systematic  literature 
search by using different scientific databases and keywords 
combinations, and selecting references published or avail-
able online in the timespan between 1975 and December 
2020. The following scientific databases were used: Pub-
Med, Web of Sciences, and PsycINFO. The following key-
words were used alone and in combination to retrieve useful 
literature on narcolepsy treatment: narcolepsy, narcolepsy 
type 1, narcolepsy type 2, narcolepsy with cataplaxy, nar-
colepsy without cataplexy, treatment, pharmacotherapy, 
cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT), peer support, and 
counseling. The literature search provided a total amount 
of 4075 results from PubMed, 1716 from Web of Science, 
and 2344 from PsycINFO. The results obtained were then 
merged in order to avoid redundancies, and references were 
selected by applying the following criteria: (1) publication in 

English; (2) availability of full text; (3) exclusion of reviews 
on narcolepsy management, and of single case reports/stud-
ies; and (4) author judgement of clinical relevance. The final 
citation list was then narrowed down to 137 references. We 
classified drugs as first-line treatments on the basis of the 
available evidence (i.e. clinical trials) and approval by the 
authorities.

Pharmacological Treatment

Pharmacological treatment for narcolepsy is necessary to 
manage symptoms and to improve patients’ quality of life. 
Available treatments may act on one or multiple symptoms, 
namely, EDS, cataplexy, and disturbed nocturnal sleep. Given 
the diverse effect of the different drugs, the choice of a first-
line approach should consider the complexity of individual 
patients, the burden of each symptom, the occurrence of mul-
tiple symptoms in combination, and the potential comorbid-
ity/side effects taking into account sleep–wake habits and 
social patients’ needs. In this review, we will distinguish 
between first- and second-line approaches on the basis of the 
available evidence (clinical trials, registration by authorities). 
Indeed, studies directly comparing the effects of different 
drugs on EDS and cataplexy are lacking; thus, the choice of 
the initial treatment should rely on the possibility to access 
the drug, on clinical judgement (including side effects), and 
on active discussion with the patients. We suggest start- 
ing the treatment with monotherapy, thus preferring the use  
of drugs acting on multiple symptoms in NT1 (i.e., sodium 
oxybate or pitolisant), and adding treatment(s) should depend 
on clinical judgement including careful follow-up with dis-
cussions with patients and caregivers. We prefer a patient-
centered treatment decision (i.e., the choice to start with 
night-time versus daytime treatment) that takes into account 
individual habits and needs, so we do not suggest an a priori 
pharmacological treatment strategy.

For a number of drugs, and for the treatment of pediatric 
patients, approval is still pending at the European Medicine 
Agency (EMA) and/or at the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA). Moreover, some treatments (antidepressants), albeit 
not registered for narcolepsy, have been extensively used 
for decades and have proven efficacious, so they are still 
prescribed off-label.

In this review, we will try to summarize the main treat-
ments hitherto available for both adults and children with 
narcolepsy  and  the  recommendations  solely  for  adult 
patients with the aim of providing a practical guide for cli-
nicians. We provide, in three tables, an overview of the avail-
able pharmacological treatment for EDS in adults (Table 1), 
for cataplexy in adults (Table 2), and for EDS and cataplexy 
in children (Table 3).

EDS Pharmacological Treatment in Adults

Armodafinil

First‑Line Treatments

Modafinil

Modafinil is a weak inhibitor of dopamine reuptake that 
leads to an increase in extracellular dopamine. Although 
it has found that modafinil selectively stimulates wake-
generating sets in the hypothalamus [18], its mechanism 
of action is still largely unknown [19]. At the dosage of 
200–400 mg/day, modafinil improves subjective EDS and 
objective  vigilance  as  measured  by  sleep  latencies  on 
Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), a finding con-
firmed by positive changes at the Clinical Global Improve-
ment of Change (CGI-C) [20–24].

Modafinil treatment usually starts with 100 mg (in the 
morning) and can be titrated gradually to 200 mg in a split 
dose in the morning (at awakening and at lunch time). After 
several weeks, the dose can be increased to 200 + 200 mg 
[23, 24].

Approved by the FDA and EMA both for adult narcolepsy 
patients, modafinil is considered a good therapy because of 
a low addiction potential and mild side effects—generally 
headache, nausea, tension/anxiety, and insomnia [25–29]. 
Modafinil decreases the efficacy of oral contraceptives; thus, 
higher ethinylestradiol or alternative contraceptive methods 
are suggested [30].

Armodafinil is the active R-enantiomer of modafinil and has 
a longer half-life. Armodafinil has the effect of reducing 
EDS in narcolepsy with a significant improvement in both 
MWT sleep latencies (1.3 to 2.6 min) and in the Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score (3.8 to 4.1). [31]. Most com-
mon side effects include headache, nausea, dizziness, and 
decreased appetite. Armodafinil has been approved by the 
FDA in treating narcolepsy adult patients [20, 21]. Its rec-
ommended dosage should start with a single dose of 100 mg 
in the morning up to a maximum of 250 mg/day.

Pitolisant

Pitolisant is a selective H3 receptor competitive antagonist/
inverse agonist. Pitolisant acts at the presynaptic level by 
blocking the auto-inhibiting activity of histamine and H3R 
agonists on endogenous histamine release and leading to 
increased histamine release. Histaminergic neuron activity 
in the brain is involved in a large variety of functions, includ-
ing wakefulness, attention, and memory [32–35]. Pitolisant 
has proven to have a no lesser efficacy on EDS compared to 
modafinil [32] and has also proven efficacious in decreasing 
cataplexy [33, 34]. The efficacy on EDS has been assessed 
on subjective EDS (ESS improvement of 4–6 points), and 
on secondary outcomes, namely objective vigilance (MWT) 
and CGI-C. In adults, pitolisant has been approved by the

[36].

nocturnal sleep [37, 38]. For the more appropriate dosage 
and best effect on EDS, it is often necessary to wait several 
weeks in order to allow an individualized titration.

For pitolisant dosage, the EMA recommends a single-
dose intake during breakfast starting from 9 mg and titrat-
ing up to 36 mg/day in few weeks. The most effective dos-
age, prescribed by EMA, is commonly 36 mg/day, and its 
complete efficacy is reached in a couple of weeks, with 
little evidence of a clinical long-term efficacy. FDA has 
approved pitolisant at a lower dosage: starting from 8.9 mg/
day reaching 17.8 mg per day after 1 week. The maximum 
daily dosage for FDA is 35.6 mg, after 2 weeks. Pitolisant 
was generally well tolerated and showed low abuse potential. 
Commonly reported side effects were headache, insomnia, 
abdominal discomfort, nausea, and irritability [32, 33].

Sodium Oxybate or Gamma Hydroxybutyrrate

Sodium oxybate is the sodium salt of γ-hydroxybutyrate, 
an endogenous metabolite of the inhibitory neurotransmit-
ter GABA. Sodium oxybate is a gamma-hydroxybutyric 
acid B-subtype (GABAb) receptor agonist. GABAb recep-
tors within the central nervous system are diffused in the 
hypothalamus and basal ganglia. Although the mechanism 
of action of sodium oxybate is unclear, the drug showed a 
strong effect in promoting nocturnal slow-wave sleep, sup-
pressing REM sleep and leading to an overall improvement 
of sleep efficiency [37, 38]. Sodium oxybate has shown effi-
cacy in reducing subjective EDS and increasing objective 
alertness with a median increase of > 10 min at MWT [39, 
40]. Although the mechanism of action of sodium oxybate 
on EDS has not been elucidated, it may be related to the 
effect on nocturnal sleep as well as its biphasic dopaminergic 
activity with immediate suppression promoting sleep, and 
subsequent release promoting wakefulness. Sodium oxybate 
also showed efficacy on cataplexy [41, 42] and disturbed 

Sodium oxybate is available only in liquid form. The drug 
has a short half-life (40–60 min), and therefore should be 
taken in two doses per night. The dosage usually starts with 
4.5 g/night (split into two doses of 2.25 g the first at bed-
time, the second 2.5–4 h after the first intake, so the patient 
must be woken up to take the second dose) for 4 weeks and 
then progressively increasing 1.5 g/night per week to reach 
the target dosage of 6–9 g/night. According to this titration 
scheme, EDS improvements should appear in 4–8 weeks 
from the treatment start.

Side effects for this drug are nausea, dizziness/confusion, 
weight loss, enuresis, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. 
Some concerns are related to the potential interactions with 
other sedating drugs, to the possible depression of the res-
piratory drive in patients with sleep-related breathing dis-
turbances or lung comorbidities, to the possible misuse as 
a “date rape” drug, as well as to the important salt load that 
may have cardiovascular effects.

The FDA has approved sodium oxybate for adults and 
children narcolepsy patients over 7 years old in narcolepsy 
for the treatment of EDS or cataplexy, while the EMA has 
approved the drug for the treatment narcolepsy with cata-
plexy in adult patients, adolescents, and children from the 
age of 7 years [43, 44].

Solriamfetol

Solriamfetol (75 up to 150 mg/day) is a selective inhibitor 
of the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. This new 
treatment is different from other wake-promoting agents for 
its dual action. Moreover, it does not promote the release of 
monoamines as amphetamines, thus leading to lower risk 

10

C. Franceschini et al.

of abuse and withdrawal effects. Solriamfetol efficaciously 
reduced  subjective  EDS  (ESS),  and  improved  vigilance 
(MWT) with a dose–response effect [45, 46]. The effect was 
confirmed also in long-term clinical trials [47].

Solriamfetol has been approved for the adult treatment 
of EDS by FDA and EMA in adult patients with narcolepsy 
[48]. Commonly reported side effects include headache, 
nausea, diminished appetite, nasopharyngitis, dry mouth, 
and anxiety.

Second‑Line Treatments

Methylphenidate

When other wake-promoting agents show no effectiveness, 
methylphenidate represents a second-line option. Methyl-
phenidate increases dopamine and norepinephrine trans-
mission. Although widely used, only a few studies [49, 50] 
have reported significant differences in the methylphenidate 
effect on the ability to stay awake and active in narcolepsy 
patients. In clinical practice EDS improved within few days 
of  lowest  dose  administration  (10  mg),  while  a  dose  of 
60 mg and higher can be used to achieve a clinically mean-
ingful response [20, 21].

Methylphenidate has been approved for treatment in adult 
NT1 and NT2 patients by the EMA (but it is not registered 
in all EU countries) and the FDA.

Side  effects  of  methylphenidate  include  tachycardia, 
hypertension, sweating, palpitations, irritability, hyperac-
tivity, mood swings, weight loss, anorexia, and insomnia. 
Albeit mild, there are risks of abuse and dependence for 
methilphenidate.

The dosage starts with a dose of 10–20 mg in the morning 
at breakfast and additional 10–20 mg at lunch, to reach the 
maximum dosage of 60 mg, usually taken in 2–4 portions 
during the daytime [50].

FDA recently approved two different combinations: one 
associates amphetamine and dextroamphetamine (Adder-
all™), and another has amphetamine sulfate as the main 
active ingredient (Evekeo™).

Cataplexy Pharmacological Treatment 
in Adults

First‑Line Treatments

Sodium Oxybate

Sodium oxybate is recognized as an efficacious drug against 
cataplexy  [41,  42].  Several  clinical  trials,  including  data 
on a prolonged follow-up of 18 months, showed a signifi- 
cant decrease in cataplectic attacks after a few weeks of therapy  
with a dose-dependent effect [53–56]. Importantly, abrupt 
sodium oxybate withdrawal does not induce a rebound effect. 
The FDA has approved sodium oxybate for adults and children 
narcolepsy patients over 7 years of age for the treatment of 
EDS or cataplexy, while the EMA approved the drug for the  
treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy in adult patients, adoles- 
cents and children from the age of 7 years [43, 44].

Pitolisant

Pitolisant has proven efficacy in reducing daily cataplexy attacks 
[57]. A randomized double-blind and placebo-controlled trial 
conducted on 105 NT1 patients taking pitolisant disclosed an 
important decrease in cataplectic attacks [33], an effect con-
firmed in long-term studies [58].

In adults, pitolisant has been approved by EMA and FDA 
for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or 
cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy [36].

Second‑Line Treatments

Amphetamines and Other Therapeutic Options

Venlafaxine

Amphetamines are another treatment option for EDS [20, 
21]. They increase the concentration of dopamine and nor-
epinephrine, and are approved in some European countries 
[20]. Treatment with dextroamphetamine usually starts with 
10 mg, and therapeutic dosages may reach a maximum of 
60 mg per day [49]. Other options include selegeline and 
reboxetine [51, 52]. Amphetamines may induce not only 
common side effects (irritability, aggressiveness, insomnia, 
and hypertension) but also severe consequences (abnormal 
movements, cardiac arrhythmias, and psychotic symptoms) 
that make their use dangerous especially in patients with car-
diovascular comorbidity. Moreover, although rare in narco-
lepsy, amphetamines suffer from a risk of abuse [49, 51, 52].

Although it is not approved, venlafaxine is a selective sero-
tonine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor widely prescribed 
in NT1 patients, and only on the basis of clinical recom-
mendations it can be considered a first-line pharmacological 
approach [20, 21]. Venlafaxine has an effect as an anticata-
plectic that reaches its peak in few days. It is well tolerated 
and has some typical side effects: increased blood pressure, 
headache, dry mouth, nausea, and dizziness.

Its dosage starts with 37.5 mg reaching the maximum dose 
of 225 mg in the morning [60]. Patients should be advised 
that abrupt withdrawal can produce a severe rebound effect 
up to the occurrence of subcontinuous invalidating cataplexy 
episodes, a condition defined as “cataplectic status” [61].

Other Antidepressants: Fluoxetine, Citalopram, 
and Clomipramine

As second-line treatments for cataplexy in NT1, there are 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), especially 
fluoxetine (10–20 up to 60 mg/day) and citalopram (10–20 
up to 40 mg/day) [20, 21]. Common side effects are exci-
tation, gastrointestinal problems, insomnia, and sexual dif-
ficulties, and they should not be underestimated, because 
they can limit applicability in clinical practice [49, 59, 62, 
63]. As for venlafaxine, abrupt withdrawal can lead to a  
severe rebound effect [64]. Their use should considered  
with extreme caution by physicians especially when used 
with young patients.

Also, clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is used 
with a daily dosage that ranges from 10–25 up to 75 mg/
day. Since the 1960s, several observations have confirmed 
clomipramine effect on reducing cataplectic attacks, but the  
drug has not been officially approved by the EMA and the FDA  
[20, 21, 65–67]. Antidepressants (fluoxetine, citalopram, and 
clomipramine) have only been approved in Germany.

Clomipramine suffers from common side effects, such 
as dry mouth, sweating, constipation, diarrhea, tachycar-
dia, weight gain, hypotension, difficulty in urinating, and 
impotence.

EDS Pharmacological Treatment 
in Childhood

Nowadays, within all the EDS treatments, only sodium oxy-
bate has been approved by FDA and EMA for treatment in 
children and adolescents. The other treatments for pediatric 
patients are considered only at empirical level as off-label 
[68, 69].

Modafinil and Armodafinil

Both  the  treatments  are  used  off-label  by  physicians  for 
patients under the age of 16, because they have not yet been 
approved by the FDA for young people below the age of 
16 [20, 21]. For children, the daily dosage of modafinil and 
armodafinil is 50–400 mg/day in two doses at the morning to 
support children in school performance and after lunch, for 
after-school activities and homework. In case of sudden with-
drawal, modafinil does not cause EDS rebound. Commonly 
reported side effects in young patients are headache, nausea, 
and vomiting. Moreover, a single case of Stevens–Johnson 
syndrome has been reported in a patient taking modafinil 
[70]. Steven–Johnson syndrome is a delayed hypersensitiv-
ity reaction that develops from a few days to weeks after 
beginning the therapy, and it appears as red or purple skin 
rash that gradually spreads. The only piece of evidence is 

a level 4 study by Ivanenko and colleagues [71]. Modafinil 
therapy in children and adolescents contributes to a subjec-
tive improvement in EDS. Furthermore, the study showed 
objective improvement in the average sleep latency on the 
MSLT from a baseline of 6.6 ± 3.7 to 10.2 ± 4.8 min.

Pitolisant

Up to now, a few uncontrolled data have reported the effi-
cacy and safety of pitolisant in reducing EDS in children 
and adolescents. The dosage for children is 4.5 mg up to 
36 mg per day.

Minor side effects have been reported (insomnia, head-
ache, hot flushes, leg pain, and hallucinations), and all but 
insomnia were transient [72].

Sodium Oxybate

Sodium oxybate is used for NT1 treatment in children, for 
its effects on reducing EDS and cataplexy. The drug is used 
in monotherapy or in association with other stimulants [73]. 
Its efficacy on EDS and cataplexy has been demonstrated 
in 88% of NT1 children [44, 74], but sodium oxybate side 
effects maintain a high-risk ratio: sleep walking, sleep enu-
resis, exacerbation of sleep apnea, tremor, constipation, 
exacerbation of pre-existing depressive tendencies, weight 
loss, nausea, irritability, and episodes of sleep drunkenness. 
Abrupt drug withdrawal does not cause rebound effects [73]. 
Recent data have also shown a positive effect on sleep dis-
ruption and on REM sleep behavior disorder [74–76].

Administration of this treatment requires particular care. 
In fact, dispensation is made from central pharmacies, and 
before making out, the prescription clinicians and physicians 
have to register and train patients or their caregiver for proper 
use. This high level of care required for the drug assumption 
is due to the risk of misuse/abuse reported in several clinical 
cases. Therefore, the patient and his/her family need proper 
training before starting the treatment. It is recommended that 
a family member should be in attendance during the drug 
administration and should be responsible for storing the med-
ication in proper locked place. Given the liquid form of the 
drug and its salty taste, it can be administrated with addition 
of flavor. The right dosage varies from 2 to 8 g per night, and 
the drug should be given in two administrations: one before 
falling asleep and the other one 3–4 h after the first dose.

Amphetamines and Methylphenidate

Amphetamine (dextro-amphetamine) and andmethylpheni-
date enhance dopaminergic and norepinephrinergic activity 
[20, 21]. Both drugs are also used to treat attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder in children and adults. Recommended 
dosages are 2.5 to 20 mg twice a day for dextro-amphetamine 

12

C. Franceschini et al.

and 10 to 40 mg for methylphenidate. Their use in adults is 
supported by three phase 2 and four level 5 studies that sup-
port the effectiveness of those stimulants in treating EDS 
[21]. Side effects include tics, anorexia, headache, nervous-
ness, insomnia, and weight loss [77]. Their use in children 
below the age of six is not approved by FDA and is dis-
couraged in children with a diagnosed heart disease [78, 
79]. Moreover, while rare in narcolepsy, amphetamines and 
methylphenidate suffer from a risk of abuse.

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

Within SSRI, the most typically used agent is fluoxetine with 
a daily administration dosage of 10–30 mg [20, 21]. Com-
monly reported side effects are nervousness, insomnia, and 
tremor. As for other antidepressants, sudden drug withdrawal 
or irregular intake may induce a rebound of cataplexy up to 
“status cataplecticus” [83].

Cataplexy Pharmacological Treatment 
in Childhood

To date, only sodium oxybate has been approved by FDA 
and EMA as a treatment for cataplexy in children and ado-
lescents. Thus, the selection of medications in the pediatric 
population is based only on an empirical, off-label, basis [69].

Sodium Oxybate or Gamma Hydroxybutyrate

The information about sodium oxybate’s effect on cataplexy 
in childhood is included in the previous paragraph “EDS 
pharmacological treatment in childhood.”

Pitolisant

Immunotherapy

Findings reported associations that support an autoimmune 
mechanism underlying the onset of NT1 that suggest the use 
of immunomodulation therapy with intravenous immuno-
globulin G (IVIG) close to disease onset. Only a few studies 
[84–87] have analyzed IVIG therapeutic efficacy in early 
onset NT1cases. To date, the results have been controver-
sial due to the small sample size, open label design, and 
self-reported observations. However, an improvement in 
cataplexy frequency and severity, as well as in EDS, was  
reported,  but  further  data  are  required  to  exclude  the  
possibility of a spontaneous improvement in NT1 symp-
toms during the disease course [88]. Overall, despite some 
promising results, further studies should address the role of  
immunotherapy in NT1 [89].

Ongoing trials are evaluating the efficacy and safety profile 
of pitolisant in children, and to date, a slight improvement 
of cataplexy frequency and severity has been reported in 
children in an uncontrolled case series [72].

Selective Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors

Venlafaxine is commonly used against cataplexy with a 
dosage of 37.5–75 mg per day [20, 21]. Due to the high 
risk of suicide reported in adolescents, the administration 
of venlafaxine for adolescents and children must be strictly 
controlled [80]. In addition, side effects due to the interac-
tions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors include dizziness, 
headache,  and  insomnia.  Further  studies  are  warranted, 
given that only a few observational data are available with 
2-year follow-up [81, 82].

Tricyclic Agents

In addition, imprimine, clomipramine, and protryptiline are 
commonly used for control cataplexy. Their dosages are, 
respectively, 10–100 mg, 10–150 mg, and 2.5–5 mg per day. 
The most commonly reported side effects are dry mouth, 
blurring, drowsiness, orthostatic hypotension, and weight 
gain [20, 21].

Non‑pharmacological Treatment

Psychological difficulties are one of the main issues affecting 
narcolepsy patients, who often report a significantly lower 
quality of life [14, 90–92]. In fact, narcolepsy is associated 
with some difficulties including work performance, sexual 
activity [93], higher risk of car accidents [94], neuropsy-
chiatric alterations [95–100], and psychological disorders 
[97–101].

Non-pharmacological treatments are regularly used to 
manage EDS, either as an adjunct to drug therapy or as an 
alternative treatment. Several authors have reported that 
medications  alone  may  not  completely  resolve  EDS,  in 
particular about 15% of patients with narcolepsy depend 
on medications alone [98] and up to 54% of these patients 
require behavioral strategies [102–104].

Although only a little evidence on the effect of daytime 
napping on EDS in NT1 is available [105], the importance 
of cognitive and behavioral therapies for narcolepsy treat-
ment is fully recognized from a clinical point of view. The 
American Academy of Sleep Medicine is the only institution 
presenting treatments other than the pharmacological ones 
[20], while scheduled naps, sleep hygiene, balanced diet, 
and physical activities are within the clinical guidelines of 
associations of sleep medicine or neurology from several

countries. Among these, both the UK and European Asso-
ciation of Neurology for Europe, the American Academy of 
Sleep Medicine for North America, and the Brazilian Sleep 
Society [20, 21, 106, 107] agree on the importance of cogni-
tive and behavioral actions to contain narcolepsy symptoms, 
reduce the negative effects, and gain a better compliance 
with drug therapy. In particular, the guidelines proposed 
by the UK Consensuses [106] suggest a symptomatologic 
approach, focused on increasing the patient’s knowledge of 
his/her disease, integrated with psychological support, in 
planning scheduled naps, promoting regular nocturnal sleep 
duration, and helping with the management of work, the 
home and recreational activities.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Several countries recommend use of cognitive and behavio-
ral strategies as adjunctive treatment to reduce the patient’s 
dysfunctions, to obtain a better response, to and decrease the 
amount of drugs that need to be administered. Within behav-
ioral sleep medicine (BSM), cognitive behavioral therapy for 
insomnia (CBT-I) has gained prominence as an empirically 
supported treatment for chronic insomnia. Up to now, less 
attention has been paid to develop and validate methods for 
disorders related to the hypersomnia family.

The main goals of CBT are to apply strategies focused on  
the resolution of symptoms, identify, and modify dysfunc-
tional thought patterns with negative influence on behaviors 
and emotions. In particular, it is possible to help narcoleptic 
patients to identify and improve dysfunctional cognitions, 
enhance treatment adherence, take medications at the appro-
priate times, maintain good sleep hygiene, and take sched-
uled naps to address the psychosocial needs of such patients. 
This sort of therapy should be performed only by psycholo-
gists, interested in BSM, who graduated from a school with 
an AASM-accredited sleep program or with a teacher with 
experience  in  sleep,  and  who  completed  a  sleep-related 
internship at a local sleep clinic.

Currently, there is an insufficient number of clinical stud-
ies on patients with narcolepsy that present a standardized 
and unambiguous protocol on how to manage symptomatol-
ogy and its psychosocial functioning. Patients under CBT 
also receive help to manage the impact that narcolepsy has 
on their quality of life, ranging from emotional to social 
levels [108] and health-related stigma [109].

A randomized study reported that patients undergoing 
cognitive therapy showed significant improvements in the 
subjective perception of their quality of life (i.e., physi-
cal function, social function, vitality, and emotional role) 
and EDS, through self-reported measures (i.e., the ESS, 
Ullanlinna Scale, SF-36) [110–112]. The aim of this study  
was to evaluate whether a multicomponent (sleep satiation, 
nap training, cognitive restructuring, and problem-solving 

techniques) treatment could provide better results than the 
standard treatments alone (control group, 6 months, and 1 
year on treatment).

Other studies tried to assess how effective the cognitive 
measures  could  be  in  coping  with  narcolepsy  [113].  To  
estimate  the  extent  to  which  CBT—based  on  cognitive 
restructuring  intervention—was  effective,  these  authors 
measured  quality  of  life,  beliefs,  and  attitude  of  narco- 
lepsy patients, finding that patients under CBT had signifi-
cantly superior (p < 0.005) post-treatment assessment scores  
than the control and drug treatment groups.

Finally, Ong et al. have developed a novel CBT for hyper- 
somnia (CBT-H) in people with CDH and co-occurring 
depressive symptoms, using an online access model for 
delivery  and  assessment  [114].  At  baseline  and  post- 
treatment, 35 adults with a diagnosis of CDH were evalu-
ated with Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Infor-
mation System measures, ESS, and other patient-reported 
outcomes. Moreover, they received a six-section CBT-H, 
delivered individually or in a small group, using a tele-
health online platform by an expert psychologist therapist. 
Cognitive interventions were aimed at processing changes 
in personal identity or functional limitations that emerged 
due to symptoms of CDH. Topics included treating the 
stigma of CDH diagnosis, implications of CDH symptoms 
on self-perception, professional goals and interpersonal 
relationships, and specific coping skills to manage mood 
and anxiety, associated with the unpredictability of CDH 
symptoms.

Further research and clinical trial are needed to sup-
port the sporadic clinical evidence of CBT programs in 
narcolepsy.

Behavioral Treatment for EDS

Such techniques represent a useful tool for improving or 
controlling sleep disorder behaviors. Several studies have 
shown [20, 21] that planning two or three short (15–20 min) 
naps at specific times of the day (scheduled daytime naps) 
is  the  most  common  behavioral  recommendation  [102, 
115–119]. Naps should be short to avoid sleep inertia at 
reawaking [102, 105, 106, 115, 119–121].

Nevertheless, this is just an indication, since not every 
narcoleptic patient benefits from short naps [115] Indeed, 
some patients could benefit from longer naps [115]. Moreo-
ver, other studies have suggested an overall benefit in day-
time alertness, when scheduled naps are associated with 
regular nocturnal bedtime [102].

Another strategy for improving EDS is reaching sleep 
satiation through sleep extension. Based on the sleep homeo-
stasis theory, sleep satiation technique requires scheduled 

14

C. Franceschini et al.

extension of nocturnal sleep: for 2 weeks from 10.00 p.m. to 
6.00 a.m. [122]. This technique requires the detection of the 
behavior frequency: identifying the degree of sleepiness and 
filling in a sleep diary that determines the number of ses-
sions. After that, continuous 1-day episodes are scheduled 
without light–dark cues. Improvements that follow naps and 
scheduled nocturnal sleep extension can be clarified by this 
behavioral disposition.

Physical activity may also has a positive effect on EDS. 
Experimental studies (in mice) showed that wheel running 
increased wakefulness in not only hypocretin knockout, but 
also cataplexy [123]. A relationship between physical activ-
ity and quality of sleep was recorded in healthy adolescents. 
This led to the hypothesis that physical activity may stabilize 
the circadian rhythm, following the improvement in sleep 
quality, but the mechanism that explain this relationship 
remains under investigation.

In any case, an actigraphic study with NT1 children and 
adolescents detected that regular physical activity was asso-
ciated with significant differences in children’s sleepiness 
(lower subjective ESS-CHAD scores) and sleep/wake profile 
(fewer daily naps and less time asleep during daytime), but 
without triggering cataplexy [124].

In addition, narcoleptic patients also reported the utility 
of controlling their environment (e.g., avoiding hot rooms, 
keeping the room cool, seeking fresh air), engaging them-
selves in certain activities (e.g., being active in conversa-
tions, avoiding boring events, restricting evening events), 
and different physical activities (e.g., pinching oneself and 
clenching one’s teeth) on EDS management [103, 111].

Broughton and Murray reported the success of these self-
behavioral stimulations in six out of 13 patients [125]. Fur-
thermore, a survey evaluating the most common behavioral 
strategies found that daytime napping (86%), scheduled noc-
turnal sleep (i.e., bedtime and wake-up time, 76%), caffeine 
use (76%), physical exercise (57%), diet (50%), temperature 
manipulations (42%), chewing gum (30%), nicotine (23%), 
mindfulness (21%), and yoga (18%) were efficacious in man-
aging EDS [99].

However, no clinical trials have addressed the efficacy of 
behavioral approaches on EDS in narcolepsy, and therefore, 
further research is needed on patients.

Cognitive and Behavioral Treatment for Cataplexy

CBT  is  also  used  for  cataplexy  treatment,  particularly 
through systematic desensitization, that helps patients to find 
coping strategies to manage their emotions. This sympto-
matic strategy—an evidence-based therapy approach that 
combines relaxation techniques with gradual exposure to 
help overcome a particularly stressful condition—gradually 
reduces the impact of the emotional triggering stimulus by 
guiding the patient through situations where the frequency 

and intensity of this stimulus increase. To arrange the sys-
tematic desensitization technique, it is necessary for stress-
ful and hyperactivating stimuli (e.g., like a funny video), to 
be previously assessed by patients, confirming that they are 
triggers for cataplexy. Then, clinicians ask the patients, in a 
state of deeply relaxation, to figure in their mind the hyper-
activating stimulus, through the illustration of the situations 
in all their details [126].

Within the CBT approach, other procedures for cataplexy  
reduction are the emotional techniques (e.g., avoiding emo-
tional experience, excitement) for the management of symp-
toms and the stimulus satiation, in which the clinician main-
tains what reinforces the cataplectic behavior in the patient  
until it loses its effect [126]. In a qualitative study on the  
cataplexy  experience,  some  patients  reported  a  sort  
of ability to control the attacks by focusing on the inhibi-
tion/avoidance of the emotional triggers (such as laughter), 
or seeking support or trying to sit down, to avoid falling to 
the ground [127].

This approach should be performed only by a psycholo-

gist experienced in behavioral sleep medicine.

Counseling

Psychological  counseling  offers  a  space  to  improve  
symptom management and treatment for both patients and 
relatives, through proper education and information about 
the disease, particularly when the diagnosis has just been 
made. With psychological counseling patients can better 
understand how narcolepsy can change their life and accord-
ingly develop strategies to deal with it. Through psychologi-
cal counseling patients can be informed about all the avail-
able pharmacological and behavioral therapies (e.g., good 
sleep hygiene) and their outcomes, and finally other lifestyle 
factors that could affect the symptoms (e.g., the influence of 
alcohol on EDS) [128].

Furthermore, researchers are becoming increasingly 
aware of the importance of peer support, as a form of 
psychosocial support offered by someone with experien-
tial knowledge of the disease [128]. With peer support, 
patients can also face the sense of isolation, improve their 
knowledge and confidence in dealing with the symptoms 
[129], and positively influence each other’s hopes about 
the future, despite the limitations of the disease. Indeed, 
the support coming from sharing experiences with oth-
ers has been shown to be constructive also for patient’s  
family members [130–132]. However, finding peer sup-
port could be complicated when experiencing a rare dis-
ease [130–132], but there still are chances to recover, also 
thanks to all the associations that operate to bring the 
patients closer and fill this gap. Furthermore, the devel-
opment of new technologies may be of help to connect 
patients and peers.

In Italy, narcoleptic patients are grouped in the Asso-
ciazione Italiana Narcolettici ed Ipersonni (AIN onlus, 
http:// www. narco lessia. org/). The association now gives 
support  to  many  narcoleptic  patients,  representing  not 
only the opportunity to be in contact with other people 
who share the same condition but also a place where sleep 
experts can cooperate and share information about differ-
ent and specific case/symptoms, and thus improve their  
knowledge of the disease. This network was founded by  
the father of a young patient, after considerable efforts made  
to find a diagnosis and a cure. Today, the AIN is very active 
also at international level. Indeed, the AIN is working to 
spread the connections with other European narcoleptic 
patient associations, through eNAP, the new European Nar-
colepsy Alliance for Patient (https:// narco lepsy. eu/). Fur-
thermore, we report the website address of other important

In  summary,  the  following  intervention  is  proposed 
for patients with narcolepsy, to be adopted especially in a 
multidisciplinary sleep medicine center. The first choice is 
pharmacological treatment with the integration of behavioral 
strategies for EDS and night sleep management. For those 
patients with impaired quality of life, anxiety-depressive 
comorbidity, and serious consequences on emotional and 
working life, pharmacological treatment should be inte-
grated with a CBT treatment, focused on the cognitive and 
psychopathological consequences of narcolepsy. In addition, 
a counseling service and focus group therapy centered on 
peer support should be offered to increase the awareness of 
the disease condition, the patient’s personal esteem, and a 
proper management of drug therapy, in terms of safety and 
compliance to the medication therapy.

Child and Relatives

Narcolepsy has a major negative impact on the child’s social 
realm. Parents and caregivers facing child problems could 
undergo truly overwhelming stress levels, for the problems 
expressed that they cannot fully understand or detect.

Moreover, professional figures do not always offer enough 
support to the child, probably due to the rarity of the disor-
der and the consequent focus that physicians have to invest 
in the diagnostic and medical challenges. Encouragements 
mainly come from close family members who may be unpre-
pared to meet the child’s worries.

Kippola-Pääkkönen and colleagues studied the expecta-
tions and perceive support of children with narcolepsy after 
the pandemic influenza in Finland [133]. In their research, 
they proposed educational, psychological, and social inter-
ventions: lectures, individual psychosocial counseling, group 
discussions,  and  skill  training.  Also,  parents  completed 
a  baseline  (58)  and  a  final  (40)  questionnaire.  Findings 
reported that parents’ worries were focused on the impact of 
narcolepsy on coping skills and the limitation of their time 
as a couple. In addition, parents received most of the support 
from their partners (77%), then from sleep physicians (27%) 
or teachers and school educators (23%). Then, researchers 
recommended offering psychological support to patients also 
during the hospitalizations in order to help families obtain 
informal and professional support.

The 20–40% incidence of depressive symptoms in narco-
leptic pediatric patients [134] should encourage the scientific 
community to build a task force of experts that tries to under-
stand the most disabling aspects of childhood or adolescent 
narcolepsy, such as access to drugs, symptom management 
with peer and family, school management of scheduled naps 
or management of drug therapy during school trips, psycho-
pathological symptoms and their support, and support for 
families with access to peer help groups.

Conclusions

NT1 is a rare chronic disorder characterized by EDS, cata-
plexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and dis-
rupted night-time sleep [1]. For its diagnosis, multiple sleep 
latency test (MSLT) and polysomnography (PSG) are used 
[1, 36, 134]. The occurrence of hallucinations and sleep 
paralysis shifts in terms of frequency and impact in narco-
leptic patients. In some cases, sodium oxybate turned out to 
be effective in reducing the number of hallucinations during 
the day [135], but other therapies, such as venlafaxine, also 
have a good therapeutic effect [28].

A recent review of the literature on disrupted nighttime 
sleep in patients with narcolepsy has shown that noctur-
nal  sleep  is  characterized—both  in  PSG  and  subjective 

16

C. Franceschini et al.

reports—by frequent brief awakenings, awakenings, and a 
high level of light sleep, which is also associated with poor 
quality of sleep at night [135]. Sodium oxybate seems to be 
a gold standard treatment in consolidating nocturnal sleep 
[38, 74, 75].

Today, narcolepsy is still a complex disease, and despite 
new scientific discoveries about its pathophysiology, cur-
rently available treatments remain scarce and only sympto-
matic. Moreover, many drugs used in the clinical practice to 
cure children are still prescribed as “off-label” treatments.

Furthermore, new immune-modulating and hypocretin 
replacement treatments should be verified more systemati-
cally [89], especially in patients and children with recent-
onset narcolepsy in order to figure out their potential in treat-
ing the disease. Non-pharmacological interventions as well 
have been shown to contribute in helping patients and family 
members and to have a role in improving patients’ quality of 
life, so for the future, it is advisable that outcome measures 
and multicompetent interventions should be guaranteed to 
patients and their families [17, 105].

Recently, research to find proper treatments for rare disor-
ders has received a new attention from the European Union 
that has addressed programs and policies also to this area of 
health programs and policies, in order to balance attention 
between rare and common disorders (European Commis-
sion, 2014) [136].
