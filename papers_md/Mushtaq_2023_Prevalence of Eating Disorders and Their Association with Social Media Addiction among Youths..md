Abstract: Eating disorders and excessive attachment to social media are a matter of great con-
cern among youths. This study assessed the prevalence of eating disorders and their association
with social media addiction among youths. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted
on 350 participants aged 14–25 years. Two pre-validated tools were used, i.e., the Eating Attitude
Test and the Social Networking Addiction Scale. SPSS was used to analyze the data. Out of the
350 students, 42% had probable eating disorders, and 41.7% had social media addictions. The ﬁndings
revealed that the chances of having eating disorders were signiﬁcantly higher among youths who
lived in separate places, smoked, and had a family history of eating disorders (p ≤ 0.05). Furthermore,
the dieting domain displayed notably higher scores for youths living separately (p ≤ 0.05) and smok-
ers (p ≤ 0.01). Moreover, the scores for bulimia and food preoccupation were signiﬁcantly higher
among participants who were married (p = 0.038), were smokers (p = 0.027), and had a family history
of eating disorders (p = 0.001). Higher scores in the oral control domain were reported by females
(p ≤ 0.05) and severely obese youths (p ≤ 0.01). Moreover, social media addiction was signiﬁcantly
higher among students aged 18–21 (p ≤ 0.01). Spearman’s correlation revealed that social media
addiction has a weak positive relationship with eating disorders (r = 0.133, p ≤ 0.01), particularly
bulimia and food preoccupation (r = 0.173, p ≤ 0.001). This reﬂects the need to address the harmful
consequences of social media addiction that might raise the likelihood of developing eating disorders,
particularly bulimia nervosa.

1. Introduction

With the advancement of technology, social media platforms have taken center stage
in people’s lives. These web-based platforms enable users to build interactive online
communities and disseminate all types of information [1]. According to a report in 2023,
more than half of the world’s population actively uses social media [2]. In Pakistan, there
are almost 72 million active social media users, which is almost 30% of the population [3,4].
Given that youngsters are a part of the digital generation, the most frequent users of social
media are also youths. The amount of time that youths spend on social media has increased
signiﬁcantly due to the popularity of these platforms [1,5]. While social media has made it
convenient for people to interact and participate in social activities, it has also raised the
issue of the excessive usage of social media, posing signiﬁcant concerns [6,7].

When people become so involved in social media that they are distressed when they
cannot use it, it is referred to as social media addiction. The constant usage of these social
media platforms promotes addictive behavior among those who use them excessively [8].
This can lead to behavioral and psychological concerns and adversely affect an individual’s
mental, social, and emotional well-being [9]. Studies show that, among teenagers who use
social media, around 12% exhibit signs of social media addiction [10]. This addiction may
affect various aspects of life. One of the alarming concerns about social media addiction
is linked to disordered eating patterns among youths. Poor eating behaviors can lead
to a greater risk of eating disorders, along with severe psychological and physiological
repercussions [11]. Previous research has demonstrated that people who use social media
like Facebook are dissatisﬁed with their appearance and report a higher tendency toward
eating disorders [12,13].

Eating disorders can be deﬁned as mental health conditions characterized by severe
and irregular food-related practices that are detrimental to one’s physical and mental
health. These include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder [14,15].
Anorexia nervosa is a disorder characterized by an intentionally restricted intake of food
and persistent attempts to maintain a body weight less than one’s minimal normal weight
or a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 17.5 for one’s age and height. Bulimia nervosa is deﬁned
as recurring binge-eating episodes that are followed by recurrent purging, intense exercise,
or prolonged fasting at least two times a week for a period of 3 months. Another type of
eating disorder is binge-eating disorder, which is deﬁned by frequent binge eating without
characteristics like fasting, purging, or rigorous activity [16]. These various eating disorders
have the potential to result in numerous mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression,
substance abuse, personality disorders, and suicide attempts, as well as various medical
complications, including endocrine dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, anemia, and even
mortality [16,17].

Eating disorders have become a worldwide concern, particularly among young people.
The incidence of disordered eating has increased with time, especially among young women.
The prevalence of anorexia among female participants in Western countries has been found
to range from 0.1% to 5.7%. In Western countries, the prevalence of bulimia nervosa ranged
from 0.3% to 7.3% in females, while in males, it ranged from 0.3% to 2.1%. Among non-
Western female respondents, the prevalence of bulimia nervosa was around 3.2%. A steady
rise is observed in unusual eating habits in non-Western nations [18].

Globally, the younger generation is getting obese, which may also contribute to the
growing prevalence of eating disorders in this age group [19]. In addition, Bozkurt et al.
stated that young adults who are obese or have a higher BMI have a greater prevalence
of internet addiction [20]. Individuals who are addicted to the internet and social media
commonly have irregular dietary habits and are used to consuming snacks between meals,
leading to obesity [21].

A study regarding social media use indicated that men and women spent approxi-
mately 3 and 4 h, respectively, using social networking sites (SNSs). Most of that time was
spent lurking, which is looking through another user’s proﬁle without actually interacting
with them. This study also indicated that the use of social networking sites may be related
to body image (BI), self-esteem (SE), and eating disorder (ED) symptoms and concerns [22].
Researchers in France examined the connection of signs of internet addiction with
self-esteem, body image avoidance (the wish to avoid situations in which body shape is
conspicuous), and disordered eating. Around 10% of men and women were found to have
an internet addiction. The symptoms of an internet addiction for both males and females
were linked to body image avoidance. Two signiﬁcant predictors of an eating disorder
were social media addiction and body image avoidance [23].

Similarly, a study conducted in Australia reported that 51.7% of girls and 45% of boys
had disordered eating behaviors. Moreover, around 75% of girls and 70% of boys owned at
least one social media account. Instagram was found to be the most common social media

platform. A clear association existed between the usage of social media, DE cognitions, and
behaviors at a younger age than previously investigated [24].

The connection between eating disorders among young adolescent boys and girls
and social media has not been sufﬁciently explored in developing countries, especially in
Pakistan [25]. This phenomenon is important to explore so that factors leading to eating
disorders can be highlighted and awareness can be raised regarding the harmful aspects
of excessive social media use [26]. Therefore, the researchers who conducted this study
aimed to assess the prevalence of eating disorders and their association with social media
addiction among youths in Pakistan. In addition, the roles of demographic factors in
different eating disorders and social media addiction were explored.

2. Methods
2.1. Study Design

A descriptive cross-sectional study was employed to assess the prevalence of eating

disorders and their association with social media addiction among youths.

2.2. Study Setting and Respondents

This study was conducted in different schools, colleges, and universities of Pakistan.

The participants selected for this study were students aged 14–25 years.

2.3. Sample Size and Sampling Technique

The Raosoft® Sample Size Calculator was used for the calculation of sample size.
With a margin of error of 5% and a conﬁdence interval of 95%, the calculated sample size
was 382. However, 350 youths took part in the study, and the response rate was 91.6%.
The respondents from the study sites were chosen using a non-probability convenience
sampling method due to the non-availability of a sampling framework to the researchers.

2.4. Study Tools

A self-administered questionnaire was used comprising a demographic sheet and
two pre-validated tools. Demographic data included gender, age, BMI, marital status,
socioeconomic status (SES), institution, living place, smoking, and family history of eating
disorders. The following pre-validated tools were used.

2.4.1. Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26)

To assess eating disorder risk, a validated tool called the Eating Attitude Test was used.
It is a 26-item scale, with each item containing six response options. It has three subscales,
i.e., dieting, bulimia and food preoccupation, and oral control. The total score on this scale
ranges from 26 to 78. If the score on this tool is 20 or more, or if the BMI is less than the
speciﬁed criteria with regard to age, it indicates the presence of an eating disorder. The tool
was found to be reliable, with Cronbach’s alpha value of α = 0.91 [27].

2.4.2. Social Networking Addiction Scale

The second validated tool utilized for this study was the Social Networking Addiction
Scale, comprising 21 items. It is a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 being strongly disagree and
7 being strongly agree. The total score on this scale ranges from 21 to 147. The reliability
scores of the scale were found to be α = 0.88. A score greater than 84 indicates social
networking addiction [28].

2.5. Ethical Considerations

Research approval for the current study was obtained from the Ethical Committee
of the University of Central Punjab (UCP/ORIC/TDF/App#09/2022). Participation in
the study was voluntary. Formal informed consent was received from the participants,
assuring the anonymity and conﬁdentiality of their responses.

2.6. Data Analysis

After data collection and entry, the participants’ responses were analyzed using IBM
SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). Descriptive statistics, including frequency
tables, Mann–Whitney U test, Kruskal–Wallis test, and Spearman’s correlation (p ≤ 0.05),
were applied to analyze the differences or associations between the variables.

3. Results
3.1. Demographic Characteristics of Participants

Out of 350 participants, 44.9% (n = 157) were males, and 55.1% (n = 193) were females.
Thirty-nine percent of youths (n = 137) were aged between 14 and 17 years. Around sixty
percent of participants (n = 206, 58.9%) had a normal BMI. The majority of the students
(n = 333, 95.1%) were unmarried. Around ninety percent (n = 314, 89.7%) of the participants
belonged to the middle class. The data showed that half of the youths (n = 178, 50.9%) were
studying in universities. Approximately eighty-ﬁve percent of the respondents (n = 297)
were living with their families. Twenty-two out of three hundred and ﬁfty participants
(n = 22, 6.3%) reported smoking. A small percentage of the participants (n = 22, 6.3%)
reported having a family history of eating disorders (Table 1).

3.2. Assessment of Social Media Use among Youths

The results highlighted that 90.3% (n = 316) of the participants use the internet for
their education or work. Around ﬁfty percent of the youths (n = 161, 46.0%) reported that
Instagram was their most preferred social networking site. Almost thirty-eight percent of

Nutrients 2023, 15, 4687

3.3. Assessment of Eating Disorders and Social Media Addiction among Youths

The ﬁndings regarding eating disorders based on the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26)
highlighted that more than two-ﬁfths of the participants (n = 146, 41.7%) had a tendency
to develop eating disorders, out of which almost 60% were females, while the remaining
40% were males. A similar percentage of the recruited youth population (n = 147) was
found to have a social media addiction based on the Social Networking Addiction Scale, in
which 85 (57.8%) were females (Table 3).

3.4. Comparison of Overall Eating Disorders and Social Media Addiction across
Different Demographics

No statistically signiﬁcant differences (p > 0.05) were found in the scores of eating dis-
orders based on gender, age, BMI, marital status, SES, or institution. However, the tendency
toward eating disorders signiﬁcantly differed based on living place (p ≤ 0.05). Youths
living in separate places had a higher tendency to develop eating disorders. Moreover,
the tendency to develop eating disorders was signiﬁcantly higher in those who smoked
(p = 0.019). Moreover, those participants who had a family history of eating disorders
scored higher on the Eating Attitudes Test, which reﬂects a higher chance of developing
eating disorders (p = 0.014).

No statistically signiﬁcant differences (p > 0.05) were found in social media addiction
based on gender, BMI, marital status, social status, institution, living place, smoking, or
family history of eating disorders. However, the tendency toward social media addiction
signiﬁcantly differed based on age (p ≤ 0.01). Youths aged 18–21 years had higher scores
for social media addiction. A detailed description is given in Table 4.

3.5. Comparison of Different Domains of Eating Disorders across Different Demographics

No statistically signiﬁcant differences (p > 0.05) were found in the dieting domain
based on gender, age, BMI, marital status, SES, institution, or family medical history.
However, the tendency toward dieting signiﬁcantly differed based on living place (p ≤ 0.05)
and smoking status (p ≤ 0.01). Participants or students living in separate places scored
higher than those living in hostels or at home. Moreover, students who smoked scored
higher in the dieting domain in comparison to non-smokers.

No statistically signiﬁcant differences (p > 0.05) were found in the bulimia and food
preoccupation domain based on gender, age, BMI, socioeconomic status, institution, or
living place. However, the tendency toward bulimia and food preoccupation signiﬁcantly
differed based on marital status (p ≤ 0.05), smoking status (p ≤ 0.05), and family medical
history (p = 0.001). Youth participants who were married, were smokers, and had a family
medical history of eating disorders had a higher probability of developing bulimia.

No statistically signiﬁcant differences (p > 0.05) were found in the oral control do-
main based on age, marital status, socioeconomic status, institution, living place, smoking,
or family medical history. However, scores in the oral control domain signiﬁcantly dif-
fered based on gender (p ≤ 0.05). Females had higher oral control as compared to males.
Moreover, the tendency toward oral control signiﬁcantly differed based on the BMI range
(p ≤ 0.01). Severely obese youth scored higher in the oral control domain. A detailed
description is given in Table 5.

3.6. Assessment of the Relationship between Eating Disorders and Social Media Addiction

Social media addiction has a weak positive relationship with overall eating disorders
(r = 0.133, p ≤ 0.01). The association with the speciﬁc type of eating disorders revealed
that social media addiction has no signiﬁcant correlation with the dieting and oral control
domains. However, a weak positive relationship of social media addiction was found with
bulimia and food preoccupation (r = 0.173, p ≤ 0.001). These results indicate that higher use
of social media might lead to eating disorders, especially bulimia and food preoccupation
(Table 6).

4. Discussion

Eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa have emerged as a global
concern in the youth population. After substance abuse, eating disorders rank second in

Nutrients 2023, 15, 4687

8 of 13

the mortality rate of any mental health issue. The current study explored the relationship
between social media addiction and eating disorders, along with different contributing
factors. It investigated whether social media usage has a relationship with disordered eating
behaviors, aiming to generate interventions and promote healthier practices among youths.
The study included 350 students, with 44.9% (n = 157) males and 55.1% (n = 193)
females. Thirty-nine percent of the respondents were between 14 and 17 years old. Around
three-ﬁfths of the participants (n = 206) had a normal BMI. The majority were single (95.1%,
n = 333). Nearly 85% of the people (n = 297) in this study resided with their families. Only
6.3% (n = 22) of the respondents reported being smokers. Few participants reported having
a family history of eating disorders.

The present study revealed that almost half of the youths mostly use Instagram, and
38% of youth use the internet for 4–6 h daily, with a signiﬁcant amount of time spent on
social media. Similar results were found in another study in which Instagram was used
by more than 70% of adolescents, and around half of the study population reported daily
internet usage of more than 3 h [29]. Youngsters use social media for numerous purposes,
i.e., to interact with each other, to communicate and share ideas, to maintain relations with
friends, to make new friends, and to acquire new information for academic purposes [30].
One of the signiﬁcant reasons for the increased usage of social media among youths is the
lockdown period during COVID-19. Due to this, the internet and social media became
major sources for connecting with friends and relatives and receiving online education
from institutions. This could be the reason why youths are now even more engaged in
internet usage, mainly social media use [31].

The results highlighted that the tendency toward eating disorders is prevalent in
42% of the participants. Similar results were found for the prevalence of social media
addiction, indicating that a signiﬁcant proportion of the recruited youth population has a
social media addiction and a tendency to develop eating disorders. Of this 42% of youths,
almost 60% were females, while 40% were males. Similar studies conducted in Australia
revealed that a signiﬁcant number of young individuals reported signs of eating disorders,
of which 51.7% of girls and 45% of boys had disordered eating behaviors [24]. Another
study conducted on social media addiction in India revealed that 32% of the participants
had a SNS addiction [32]. Social media addiction is an excessive attachment to activities on
social networking sites that can hamper daily functioning. Excessive social media usage
can harm users’ biological, physiological, psychological, and social development. Due to
this addictive behavior, the lifestyle, perceptions, and habits of youths can be badly affected.
The prevalence of eating disorders and social media addiction is signiﬁcantly increasing,
not only in females but in males as well. This vulnerability to becoming addicted to social
media and the development of disordered eating could also be due to the possible lack of
parental control and monitoring of youths [32,33].

The results of the present study revealed that the prevalence of overall eating disorders
signiﬁcantly varied based on the youth’s living place (p ≤ 0.05). People living in separate
places had a higher chance of developing eating disorders. With the responsibility of
managing their meals, these students may be more susceptible to unhealthy or disordered
eating habits. The higher tendency toward eating disorders could also be attributed to
factors such as higher levels of stress, academic pressures, and limited control over food
choices [34].

The results also revealed that the tendency toward eating disorders signiﬁcantly
differed based on smoking status (p = 0.019), with smokers scoring higher compared to non-
smokers. These ﬁndings are consistent with a study conducted in the USA [35]. Smoking
may be a compensatory behavior, as appetite is suppressed by nicotine in cigarettes. It
also boosts the metabolism and could be a weight control strategy, thus contributing to
disordered eating behaviors. There may also be shared psychological factors, such as
impulsivity and negative body image, contributing to both smoking and disordered eating
behaviors [36].

Nutrients 2023, 15, 4687

Moreover, the presence of a family history of eating disorders also showed a signiﬁcant
difference (p ≤ 0.05), indicating a higher risk. Another study reported similar ﬁndings
that the chances of developing eating disorders are more than two-fold higher if there is
a family history of eating disorders [37]. The presence of a family history may indicate a
genetic predisposition, as certain genetic abnormalities and impulsive personality traits
have been associated with an increased susceptibility to developing eating disorders [38].
The present study also explored different domains of eating disorders. The results
revealed signiﬁcant differences in the dieting domain (categorized by restricted calorie
intake, low carbohydrates, and a desire to look slimmer) based on the living place (p = 0.012).
Youths living in separate places scored higher than those living in hostels or with families.
This could be due to a lack of parental guidance and excessive social media use, due to
which students could be more impressed by their friends or surroundings and aim to look
slimmer in order to be liked and appreciated by others [22]. Moreover, the tendency toward
dieting was higher in smokers (p ≤ 0.01) as compared to non-smokers. Similar ﬁndings
were quoted by another study, which highlighted that a greater dependence on nicotine
and a higher smoking rate were found in youths with eating disorders in comparison to
the control group. This could be attributed to the weight control desire in adolescents [36].
The tendency toward bulimia and food preoccupation (purging after consuming meals
and excessive thoughts about food) signiﬁcantly differed based on family medical history
(p = 0.001), indicating that students with a family history of eating disorders have a higher
likelihood of experiencing bulimia and food preoccupation. These results are consistent
with the ﬁndings of another study that a person has a 9.6 times higher chance of developing
bulimia nervosa if there is a family history of the disorder [39].

The results also indicate that the tendency toward bulimia and food preoccupation
signiﬁcantly differed based on marital status (p ≤ 0.05) and smoking (p ≤ 0.05). Students
who were married and were smokers had a higher probability of developing bulimia.
Another study conducted in Louisiana, USA, reported that bulimic symptoms and body
shape concerns were elevated in smokers. Almost 10% of smokers and 2% of non-smokers
reported higher scores on a bulimia-screening test. Furthermore, the percentage of smokers
reporting severe body shape concerns was double in comparison to non-smokers. Studies
suggest that impaired behavioral regulation, affective instability, impulsivity, and genetic
factors may be underlying factors for both smoking and bulimic symptoms. Many females
with bulimia nervosa were of the view that smoking is a very useful tool to control weight
and appetite [40].

Furthermore, oral control, which means the tendency to self-control eating, signiﬁ-
cantly differed based on gender (p ≤ 0.05), with females scoring higher. Similar results
were reﬂected in another study highlighting that female students, in comparison to males,
have a high prevalence of anorexia nervosa, of which oral control is a primary factor [41].
This is because females are less satisﬁed with their bodies, over-concerned about their
weight and shape, and more engaged in behaviors pertaining to body avoidance, due to
which they exhibit more oral control tendencies [42]. Moreover, it could also be attributed
to sociocultural factors such as societal pressures and unrealistic beauty standards, which
affect females more signiﬁcantly. Through social media platforms, females engage in inten-
sive and regular social comparisons, leading to reduced body satisfaction and disordered
eating [23].

The tendency toward oral control also signiﬁcantly differed based on the BMI range
(p ≤ 0.01), with severely obese individuals scoring higher in the oral control domain.
Deasai et al. also reported that undergraduate students in the USA who were obese were
more involved in dieting due to a desire to be thinner in comparison to their peers with
normal weight. Disordered eating is generally found to be more prevalent in overweight
youths [43]. This emphasizes the importance of considering BMI when examining and
addressing eating disorder tendencies among youth.

The study ﬁndings revealed that social media addiction scores were signiﬁcantly
different based on age (p ≤ 0.01). Students aged 18–21 scored higher for social media

Nutrients 2023, 15, 4687

addiction. This is because, in Pakistan, most youths at this age study in universities with
large social circles and social gatherings. The internet is easily accessible in universities and
at home due to study requirements. Excessive internet use can also lead to the excessive
use of social media during free time. Moreover, a lack of parental control at this age can
lead to social media addiction to stay up to date regarding the latest trends, inﬂuencers,
brands, etc.

Lastly, the present study concluded that a weak positive relationship existed between
social media addiction and eating disorders, particularly bulimia and food preoccupa-
tion (r = 0.173, p ≤ 0.001). These results suggest that overusing social media platforms
may lead to the emergence of disordered eating patterns. Other studies reported similar
results [15,22]. A similar study conducted in China showed that both male and female
internet addicts reported signiﬁcantly greater levels of eating disorder symptoms compared
to the control groups. These ﬁndings suggest that both male and female internet addicts
exhibit psychological traits associated with eating problems at considerably higher levels
than individuals without an internet addiction [44].

Regarding bulimia and food preoccupation, studies have shown that a relationship
does exist between SNS usage and bulimia. Due to increased exposure to social media,
advertisements, and brand promotions, pressure to reduce weight increases to be more cul-
turally ﬁt. This can precipitate numerous risk factors, like body avoidance, dissatisfaction,
dieting, or bulimic symptoms. Social media also greatly affects a person’s self-esteem when
people start comparing themselves with other users on social media. This can ultimately
lead to low self-esteem and dissatisfaction with life. It is proven by research that low
self-esteem is associated with poor eating behaviors and, eventually, eating disorders like
bulimia nervosa [45]. In order to reduce the incidence of eating disorders, there is a need
to address the possible detrimental effects of social media on people’s mental health and
encourage a healthier connection with social media.

However, there were certain study limitations. The study used self-report measures
to collect the data, which might have led to the over- or under-reporting of eating habits
and social media use, leading to the possibility of response bias. The researchers opted
for a cross-sectional study design due to time constraints and some resource limitations.
Lastly, the utilization of clinical assessments of eating disorders might improve the accuracy
of the ﬁndings.

5. Conclusions

More than 40% of the recruited youth population demonstrated a higher risk of
eating disorders and social media addiction, with comparative results in both males and
females. Social media addiction was found to have a weak positive relationship with eating
disorders, particularly bulimia and food preoccupation. These results suggest that a higher
risk of social media addiction may contribute to an increased likelihood of developing
eating disorders.

The study also identiﬁed several factors associated with eating disorders and social
media addiction. Living place, smoking status, and family history of eating disorders
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the tendency to develop eating disorders. On the other hand,
social media addiction was the most prevalent in youths aged 18–21 years. These ﬁndings
highlight the need to address how social media addiction can be prevented and to raise
awareness, educate, and promote healthy online behaviors to mitigate the potential negative
consequences of social media addiction, including the development of eating disorders in
people, especially youths.

6. Research Implications and Recommendations

The assessment of eating disorders and social media addiction holds profound sig-
niﬁcance in current times. When social media is rigorously used, it can jeopardize young
individuals’ mental and physical well-being. This study can raise public awareness among
youths regarding the harmful consequences of excessive social media use through targeted

Nutrients 2023, 15, 4687

11 of 13

advertisements, seminars, and counseling sessions aimed at youths in schools, colleges,
and universities. It can serve as a baseline for future investigations, facilitating deeper
exploration of the multifaceted factors driving eating disorders via social media. This
research gives a reality check to youths regarding eating disorder tendencies, which can
help to promote healthier lifestyles among adolescents, safeguard their long-term health,
and foster a more balanced relationship with digital media. It is recommended that the
authorities monitor social media platforms through content regulation. Collaborating with
the advertising industry to promote responsible advertising practices, such as portraying
diverse body types, can help reduce body dissatisfaction and eating disorders. It is also
essential to increase funding and accessibility to mental health support services, including
screening and treatment for eating disorders.

7. Future Directions

Future researchers can employ a mixed-methods study approach comprising self-
reported questionnaires and in-depth interviews to complement each other and provide
a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. Longitudinal research can also
be conducted to identify the long-term consequences of social media use and how it
inﬂuences the youth’s thinking patterns and ultimately leads to disrupted eating patterns.
Incorporating clinical evaluations and diagnostic criteria would allow for more accurate
identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of eating disorder symptoms.
