Abstract

Background: Noise phobia is a common behavior problem in dogs for which there

are limited treatment options.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of imepitoin in comparison to placebo

for the control of anxiety and fear associated with noise phobia in dogs.

Animals: Two hundred thirty-eight client-owned dogs with noise phobia were rec-

ruited in veterinary clinics.

Methods: This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial used a

predictable noise event as eliciting context, the traditional New Year's Eve fireworks

in Germany and the Netherlands. Owners began treatment 2 days before the antici-

pated noise event with administration of either imepitoin 30 mg/kg body weight

Q12h or placebo for 3 consecutive days. On New Year's Eve, owners noted their

observations of their dog's fear and anxiety behavior at 1600, 2200, 0020, and

0100 hours and scored the overall treatment effect on the following day.

Results: In the 16-item owner report of fear and anxiety signs, fear and anxiety

behaviors were significantly reduced under imepitoin treatment compared to placebo
(delta −6.1 scoring points; P < .0001). A significantly higher proportion of owners

reported a good or excellent overall treatment effect in the imepitoin group com-

pared to placebo (odds ratio 4.689; 95% CI, 2.79-7.89; P < .0001).

Conclusion: Imepitoin effectively controls fear and anxiety associated with noise

phobia in dogs.

Fear responses to noises are quite common in dogs with a prevalence
of up to 49%,1 with a relevant proportion showing nongraded extreme
responses to noises indicative of a phobia.2 Exposure to a phobic stimu-

a marked, persistent, and excessive fear of clearly discernible cir-

cumscribed objects or situations. The term phobia is derived from

human psychiatry, where it describes an irrational fear, and it is mainly

used to create a qualitatively distinct category for the purposes of psy-

Benzodiazepines, targeting GABAA (γ-aminobutyric acid, type A)

The cutoff point in the LSSS of 30 captures the essence of the
definition of noise phobia used in here, that is, that it is an “excessive
fear or anxiety of a sound”. Excessive can be considered to refer to

either the severity of signs (ie, at least 2 signs with most intense form

[score 5] every time the noise was heard [score 3]) or the number of

signs (ie, all 16 signs occur frequently [score 2] in the lowest intensity

[score 1]).

In addition, dogs had to be healthy or with a stable systemic dis-

ease, considered to be pain-free for at least 2 weeks before inclusion

(no painful condition or stable under pain management including med-

ication) and have been with the current owner for at least 1 year. The

owner had to agree that either he/she or another person familiar with

the dog would be with the dog on New Year's Eve, and this person

had observed a fear response in the dogs during previous fireworks.

Dogs suffering from generalized fears, as well as dogs on treat-

ment with behavior-modifying drugs in the previous 2 months were

excluded. Sedatives were permitted for a single occasion and for

purposes not related to behavior problems (eg, diazepam as a

preanesthetic) up to 2 weeks before the start of the treatment.

as well as dogs that had been treated to diminish signs of noise phobia

Dogs received either imepitoin at a dose of approximately 30 mg/kg

twice daily or visually identical placebo tablets. Dogs were adminis-

tered the appropriate amount of tablets orally twice daily at approxi-

mately 12 hours intervals starting 2 days before the day of anticipated

noise event. The first administration was in the morning of 29th

December, and the last administration was in the evening of 31st

December (ideally between 1800 and 2000 hours).

2.4 | Assessment of fear and anxiety-related
behaviors

The primary efficacy assessment of the study aimed to show if there

was superiority of imepitoin over the placebo. To assess this, 2 co-

primary efficacy variables were used.

The first primary efficacy variable was the owner's overall assess-

ment of the treatment effect on the fear and anxiety behavior of the

dog in response to fireworks on New Year's Eve, using a 5-point ordi-

nal score (Table 1). This assessment was done on January 1st, not ear-

lier than 6:00 AM This time point ensured a retrospective judgment for

the whole duration of the noise event.

The second co-primary efficacy variable was based on a detailed

16-item owner questionnaire, reporting the dog's fear and anxiety
signs. This questionnaire was modified from the LSSS11 by adopting

comitant disease, such as severely impaired hepatic function, severe

behavior (eg, dogs that had bitten people in the past, toddlers in the

home in the case of aggressive behavior toward people, aggression

Each investigator received a set of medication numbers and assigned

evaluations necessary for the analysis of the co-primary efficacy vari-

Imepitoin was well tolerated with no serious adverse events recorded

in this trial (a serious adverse event was defined as an unfavorable

observation, which results in death or life-threatening conditions, per-

sistent or significant disability, abortion or birth defects or requires

professional intervention). Reported adverse events were mostly mild

and transient and included ataxia, increased appetite, lethargy, emesis,

hyperactivity, and somnolence, all of which occurred at a higher fre-

quency in the imepitoin-treated group than in the placebo group

(Table 4). All other adverse events occurred either in similar frequen-

cases (≤2.5%).

Transient ataxia was the most commonly reported adverse event,

affecting 35.1% (40/114) of the imepitoin-treated cases, starting on

the first day of treatment, mostly between 30 minutes and 4 hours

after first drug administration. It resolved exponentially under contin-

Although noise phobia is most frequently associated with fireworks, it

is more than just a seasonal or sporadic issue, as affected dogs often
also react to a range of other noises such as thunder or gunshots.2,12

Although some dogs with noise phobia respond only to certain spo-

radically occurring noises, others have phobias against many noises

that may occur year round or to other, less salient, noises, such as
traffic and TV noises.1 Noise phobia could also represent 1 of several
expressions of a wider underlying anxiety problem.12 Accordingly,

treatment approaches should be tailored to the individual dog's prob-

lem and might consist of short acute pharmaceutical interventions for

occasional but predictably occurring events causing fear and anxiety

or long-term psychoactive medication either alone or in combination
with a short-acting anxiolytic when needed.12 In all cases, behavior

treatment, preferably by a specialist, would be ideal in combination
with psychoactive drugs to provide the best long-term effect.2

Because there is strong evidence that dogs with noise phobia gen-
eralize fear of 1 type of loud sudden noise to others,1,13 New Year

fireworks provide a good standardization of the eliciting context for

noise phobia more generally. Thus, this study provides evidence that

imepitoin is effective in reducing signs of anxiety and fear associated

with noise phobia in dogs.

Placebo-controlled trials are considered the best evidence for
anxiolytic treatments.14 Currently, only a third of owners with dogs
suffering from fear responses to noises seek treatment advice,1

despite the fact that noise phobia has negative effects on both health
and life span of dogs.15,16

Regarding the dose regimen, we aimed to establish an efficacious

blood concentration of imepitoin at the initiation of the noise event to

preemptively limit the fear and anxiety experience. Because titration

of the dose up to an efficacious level is not possible for sudden noise

dogs. For example, in a laboratory setting, a single dose of 20 mg
