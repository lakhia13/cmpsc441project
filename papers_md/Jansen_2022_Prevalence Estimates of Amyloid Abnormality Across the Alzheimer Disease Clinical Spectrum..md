Abstract

IMPORTANCE: One characteristic histopathological event in Alzheimer disease (AD) is cerebral 
amyloid aggregation, which can be detected by biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 
on positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Prevalence estimates of amyloid pathology are 
important for health care planning and clinical trial design.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of amyloid abnormality in persons with normal 
cognition, subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or clinical AD dementia and to 
examine the potential implications of cutoff methods, biomarker modality (CSF or PET), age, sex, 
APOE genotype, educational level, geographical region, and dementia severity for these estimates.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, individual-participant pooled 
study included participants from 85 Amyloid Biomarker Study cohorts. Data collection was 
performed from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2020. Participants had normal cognition, 
subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or clinical AD dementia. Normal 
cognition and subjective cognitive decline were defined by normal scores on cognitive tests, 
with the presence of cognitive complaints defining subjective cognitive decline. Mild cognitive 
impairment and clinical AD dementia were diagnosed according to published criteria.

EXPOSURES: Alzheimer disease biomarkers detected on PET or in CSF.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Amyloid measurements were dichotomized as normal 
or abnormal using cohort-provided cutoffs for CSF or PET or by visual reading for PET. 
Adjusted data-driven cutoffs for abnormal amyloid were calculated using gaussian mixture 
modeling. Prevalence of amyloid abnormality was estimated according to age, sex, cognitive 
status, biomarker modality, APOE carrier status, educational level, geographical location, and 
dementia severity using generalized estimating equations.

RESULTS: Among the 19 097 participants (mean [SD] age, 69.1 [9.8] years; 10 148 women 
[53.1%]) included, 10 139 (53.1%) underwent an amyloid PET scan and 8958 (46.9%) had an 
amyloid CSF measurement. Using cohort-provided cutoffs, amyloid abnormality prevalences were 
similar to 2015 estimates for individuals without dementia and were similar across PET- and

CSF-based estimates (24%; 95% CI, 21%−28%) in participants with normal cognition, 27% (95% 
CI, 21%−33%) in participants with subjective cognitive decline, and 51% (95% CI, 46%−56%) 
in participants with mild cognitive impairment, whereas for clinical AD dementia the estimates 
were higher for PET than CSF (87% vs 79%; mean difference, 8%; 95% CI, 0%−16%; P = .04). 
Gaussian mixture modeling–based cutoffs for amyloid measures on PET scans were similar to 
cohort-provided cutoffs and were not adjusted. Adjusted CSF cutoffs resulted in a 10% higher 
amyloid abnormality prevalence than PET-based estimates in persons with normal cognition (mean 
difference, 9%; 95% CI, 3%−15%; P = .004), subjective cognitive decline (9%; 95% CI, 3%−15%; 
P = .005), and mild cognitive impairment (10%; 95% CI, 3%−17%; P = .004), whereas the 
estimates were comparable in persons with clinical AD dementia (mean difference, 4%; 95% CI, 
−2% to 9%; P = .18).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that CSF-based estimates using 
adjusted data-driven cutoffs were up to 10% higher than PET-based estimates in people without 
dementia, whereas the results were similar among people with dementia. This finding suggests 
that preclinical and prodromal AD may be more prevalent than previously estimated, which has 
important implications for clinical trial recruitment strategies and health care planning policies.

Pathologic change in Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by cerebral amyloid 
aggregation, as indicated by amyloid biomarkers on positron emission tomography (PET) 
scans or in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).1,2 With emerging disease-modifying antiamyloid 
therapies, estimating the prevalence of amyloid abnormality in persons across the AD 
clinical spectrum is important to reduce screening failure rates and improve recruitment 
efficiency.3–5 Previous studies analyzed 56 Amyloid Biomarker Study cohorts to estimate 
age, sex, educational level, and apolipoprotein E (APOE; GenBank 348)–associated 
prevalence of amyloid abnormality on PET scans and in CSF in 7583 individuals without 
dementia and on PET scans in 1359 individuals with clinical AD dementia.6,7 Much more 
biomarker data have become available in recent years, providing the possibility of increasing 
estimate robustness and examining previously unaddressed factors that could alter amyloid 
abnormality prevalence estimates.

One such factor is the method for defining amyloid abnormality cutoffs. In a previous 
analysis, cohort-provided cutoffs were used; however, different methods to calculate 
amyloid abnormality cutoffs were applied.8–10 Moreover, values from a specific CSF 
amyloid-β 42 analysis tool appeared to have gradually increased over the past 2 
decades such that older available CSF amyloid–abnormality cutoffs may have been 
too conservative.11–13 Therefore, we recalculated the cutoffs using an unbiased mixture 
modeling approach and examined whether these adjusted cutoffs affected amyloid 
abnormality prevalence estimates. Furthermore, in a previous study, amyloid abnormality 
in persons with clinical AD dementia was assessed only with PET measures,7 whereas 
CSF measures are now available for this group in the Amyloid Biomarker Study. The large 
number of participants in this combined analysis of Amyloid Biomarker Study cohort data 
enabled us to study whether PET and CSF prevalence estimates differed in persons with 
both measurements. We also examined whether amyloid abnormality prevalence differed by 
geographical region or between individuals with mild, moderate, or severe dementia, which 
could be important factors to consider in trial planning.

In this study, we aimed to refine the 2015 results by estimating the prevalence of amyloid 
abnormality in persons with normal cognition, subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive 
impairment, or clinical AD dementia and examining the potential implications of cutoff 
methods, biomarker modality (CSF or PET), age, sex, APOE genotype, educational level, 
geographical region, and dementia severity for these estimates.

Methods

Participants

This cross-sectional study included participants from the 85 cohorts of the Amyloid 
Biomarker Study, an ongoing, world-wide data-pooling initiative that started in 2013.6,7 
A flow diagram of the included studies and participants is shown in eFigure 1 in the 
Supplement. None of the 85 included studies required evidence of amyloid abnormality as 
an eligibility criterion to enroll in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from 
all participants in each study, and data were deidentified by the respective cohorts. The 
study protocol for each cohort was approved by the local ethics committee at each site. The 
present study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Maastricht University 
Medical Center, which declared that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act 
(WMO) does not apply to the study and waived the informed consent requirement because 
deidentified data were used. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational 
Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.

The present pooled analysis consisted of 19 097 participants, of whom 9908 had normal 
cognition, which was defined by normal scores on cognitive tests and/or absence of 
cognitive complaints; 1524 had subjective cognitive decline defined by cognitive complaints 
without objective confirmation on tests; 5405 had mild cognitive impairment14,15; and 2260 
had clinical AD dementia. Clinical AD dementia was subcategorized as follows according 
to Mini-Mental State Examination scores (range 0–30, with higher scores indicating better 
performance): mild (score: ≥20; n = 1525), moderate (score: 11–20; n = 488), or severe 
(score: ≤10; n = 61). The characteristics of all cohorts are shown in eTable 1 in the 
Supplement, and an overview of data availability is provided in eTable 2 in the Supplement. 
Compared with the 2015 analyses of the Amyloid Biomarker Study cohorts, the present 
study included more people, with 7804 persons without dementia and 737 persons with 
clinical AD dementia from 29 new cohorts as well as 1205 additional cases from 10 cohorts, 
who also participated in the 2015 studies (which involved 812 persons without dementia and 
737 persons with clinical AD dementia).

Data collection was performed from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2020. Race and 
ethnicity data were not collected because this study used existing data, and many of the 
cohorts we analyzed did not collect this information.

Amyloid Abnormality Cutoffs

Amyloid measures per cohort are detailed in eTables 3 and 4 in the Supplement. We selected 
the biomarker modality that resulted in the greatest number of participants per cohort for the

primary analyses. Both PET amyloid and CSF amyloid were measured at baseline, and the 
interval between diagnosis and biomarker assessment did not exceed 6 months.

We calculated cohort-specific, data-driven cutoffs independent of diagnosis to ascertain 
amyloid abnormality using gaussian mixture modeling in those cohorts that provided 
continuous amyloid values. Gaussian mixture modeling–based cutoffs may better capture 
amyloid abnormality than clinical diagnosis–based cutoffs.12,13,16 We evaluated the number 
of distributions that provided the best fit on the data using the R function boot.comp 
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Next, we visually inspected the normality of 
distributions and chose the cutoff as the value where 2 fitted normal distributions intersected. 
When there were more than 2 distributions, we forced the data into 2 distributions or chose 
the cutoff of 2 of the 3 distributions after visual inspection (eTable 3 in the Supplement). 
When there was a single distribution, cohort-provided cutoffs were used.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive data were analyzed using independent-samples, unpaired, 2-tailed t tests 
for continuous variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables. Differences in observed 
percentages were analyzed using McNemar tests. Amyloid abnormality was the 
dichotomous outcome variable (normal or abnormal) in generalized estimating equations17 
using the genlin command in SPSS, version 26 (IBM). We assumed a logit-link function 
with an exchangeable correlation structure. The outcome of amyloid abnormality was 
defined using cohort-provided cutoffs and adjusted cutoffs.

We performed 6 analyses. First, we examined the prevalence of amyloid abnormality defined 
using cohort-provided cutoffs according to age, diagnosis, and biomarker modality, testing 
up to 3-way interactions with a forward selection method. Second, we repeated the analyses 
after cutoff adjustments. Third, we assessed the characteristics of participants who had 
discordant amyloid-positive results based on cohort-provided vs adjusted cutoffs. Fourth, 
we conducted separate analyses based on adjusted cutoffs to examine the dependencies 
on sex; educational level; APOE ε4 carrier status (carrier vs noncarrier); APOE genotype 
(ε2ε2, ε2ε3, ε2ε4, ε3ε3, ε3ε4, or ε4ε4); and geographical region of amyloid abnormality 
prevalence, which were tested with up to 3-way interactions with age, cognitive status, 
APOE ε4 carrier status, and biomarker modality using forward selection. Interaction terms 
were retained in the model if they appeared significant by the Wald statistical test; a 
2-sided P < .05 indicated statistical significance. From these separate analyses, we excluded 
small subgroups of participants with ε2ε2 (44 with normal cognition, 2 with subjective 
cognitive decline, 6 with mild cognitive impairment, and 1 with clinical AD dementia) and 
16 participants with subjective cognitive decline and ε2ε4. Among persons with clinical 
AD dementia, we examined the association of amyloid abnormality with APOE ε4 gene 
dose (0/1/2 alleles) instead of APOE genotype, because the ε2ε2 (0.2%), ε2ε3 (2.5%), and 
ε2ε4 (2.5%) genotypes were infrequent. Fifth, we investigated whether amyloid abnormality 
prevalence depended on mild, moderate, or severe AD dementia. Sixth, we assessed PET-
CSF concordance for participants who had values for both measurements available.

We performed all 6 analyses separately in persons without dementia (normal cognition, 
subjective cognitive decline, or mild cognitive impairment) and in persons with clinical

Results

AD dementia because the 2015 studies were also conducted in these groups separately6,7 
and because age and biomarker modality associations differed for these groups. Age was 
included as a continuous variable centered at the median (70 years). Educational level was 
dichotomized at the median (14 years). Cohorts were subdivided into geographical regions: 
North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Probabilities and 95% CIs that were estimated by generalized estimating equations were 
used in figures and tables. Statistical comparisons were reported at the mean age unless 
otherwise specified.

Of the 19 097 participants included in the study, 10 148 were women (53.1%) and 8949 
were men (46.9%) with a mean (SD) age of 69.1 (9.8) years. Participant characteristics 
according to cognitive status and biomarker modality are shown in Table 1. A total of 3858 
participants (20.2%) had missing data for APOE ε4 carrier status, 132 (0.7%) for sex, and 
1803 (9.4%) for educational level (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Participants with missing 
data were excluded from the respective subanalyses. Of the 19 097 total participants, 1571 
(8.2%) underwent both CSF and PET measurements. The characteristics of persons who 
underwent PET vs CSF measurement are shown in eTable 6 in the Supplement.

A total of 10 139 of 19 097 participants (53.1%) in 50 cohorts underwent an amyloid-PET 
measurement (26 quantitative reading, 23 visual reading, and 1 combined), and 15 of 26 
cohorts provided continuous amyloid load values. In addition, 8958 participants (46.9%) in 
51 cohorts had an amyloid-CSF measurement; 50 cohorts provided continuous values, and 2 
of these cohorts did not provide study-specific cutoffs.

Of the 50 cohorts with continuous CSF values, 27 showed a bimodal distribution, and 7 
showed 3 distributions. In 19 subsets, gaussian mixture modeling of CSF amyloid values 
did not show distinctive distributions such that the cutoffs could be determined; eTable 7 
in the Supplement shows methodological considerations for the cohorts without distinctive 
distributions. Compared with cohort-provided cutoffs, the adjusted cutoffs in the 34 cohorts 
with distinctive distributions were higher in 24 cohorts (n = 6299 participants; mean 
Innotest difference, 108.44 pg/mL), lower in 3 cohorts (n = 741 participants; mean Innotest 
difference, 48.24 pg/mL), and did not differ in 7 cohorts. Furthermore, 3832 participants 
(42.8%) had abnormal amyloid with cohort-provided cutoffs and 4467 participants (49.9%) 
had abnormal amyloid with adjusted cutoffs (mean difference, 7.1%; P < .001) (eTable 8 in 
the Supplement).

Of the 50 cohorts with PET values, 14 provided continuous PET values, 10 of which had a 
bimodal distribution and 4 did not show distinctive distributions because of small sample 
sizes (<28 participants). The difference between cohort-provided cutoffs and adjusted 
cutoffs was less than 0.1 SUVR (standardized uptake value ratio) for 7 cohorts (lower 
in 3 cohorts [n = 5055 participants], higher in 3 cohorts [n = 1275 participants], and no 
difference in 1 cohort [n = 279 participants]) and was less than 0.4 SUVR for 3 cohorts 
(lower in 2 cohorts [n = 312 participants] and higher in 1 cohort [n = 279 participants]). In

these 10 cohorts, 2174 participants (30.2%) had abnormal amyloid with the cohort-provided 
cutoff and 2146 participants (29.8%) had abnormal amyloid with the adjusted cutoff (mean 
difference, 0.4%; P = .07). Given this nonsignificant difference and the limited number 
of cohorts with continuous data, amyloid abnormality on PET scans was defined using 
cohort-provided cutoffs for quantitatively rated scans.

Amyloid Abnormality Prevalence in Normal Cognition, Subjective Cognitive Decline, and 
Mild Cognitive Impairment

With cohort-provided cutoffs for both PET and CSF measures, amyloid abnormality 
prevalence estimates in normal cognition, subjective cognitive decline, and mild cognitive 
impairment were similar to the 2015 estimates. Specifically, prevalence estimates increased 
with older age, were similar for participants with normal cognition and subjective cognitive 
decline at any age (mean difference, 2%; 95% CI, −7% to 2%; P = .31), were approximately 
25% higher in participants with mild cognitive impairment vs normal cognition and 
subjective cognitive decline (mean difference, 25%−27%; 95% CI, 19%−30%; P < .001), 
and were similar for PET and CSF (mean difference, 0% [95% CI, −4% to 4%; P = .99]; 
normal cognition: 24% [95% CI, 21%−28%]; subjective cognitive decline: 27% [95% CI, 
21%−33%]; and mild cognitive impairment: 51% [95% CI, 46%−56%]) (Figure 1; eFigure 
2A and eTable 9 in the Supplement).

With adjusted CSF cutoffs, CSF-based amyloid abnormality estimates were, on average, 
10% higher than PET-based estimates in persons with normal cognition (CSF vs PET mean 
difference, 9%; 95% CI, 3%−15%; P = .004), subjective cognitive decline (9%; 95% CI, 
3%−15%; P = .005), and mild cognitive impairment (10%; 95% CI, 3%−17%; P = .004) 
and were similarly associated with age compared with cohort-provided cutoffs (Table 2 and 
Figure 1; eFigure 2B in the Supplement). Given this association of biomarker modality 
with the prevalence of amyloid abnormality when adjusted CSF cutoffs were included, 
we included biomarker modality in further analyses. Table 3 shows observed amyloid 
abnormality prevalence.

Amyloid abnormality estimates had a steeper increase with age among APOE ε4 carriers 
than noncarriers, regardless of clinical diagnosis and biomarker modality (Figure 2A and 
B; eTable 10 in the Supplement). Similarly, APOE ε4ε4 carriers aggregated amyloid at 
the youngest age, followed by ε3ε4, ε2ε4, ε3ε3, and ε2ε3 (eFigure 3A and B, eFigure 
4 in the Supplement). The PET-based amyloid abnormality prevalence was 10% (95% 
CI, 4%−16%; P = .001) higher in ε3ε4 compared with ε2ε4 (normal cognition: 46% vs 
36%; subjective cognitive decline: 44% vs 34%; mild cognitive impairment: 66% vs 56%), 
whereas in the 2015 study, these groups had similar amyloid abnormality frequencies. Of 
the 44 APOE ε2ε2 carriers with normal cognition, 5 had an abnormal amyloid marker. 
In APOE ε4ε4 carriers, CSF-based estimates were 15% (95% CI, 5%−25%; P = .005) 
higher than PET-based estimates, whereas this difference was approximately 8% for the 
other APOE genotypes (modality × APOE P=.008). Sex was not associated with amyloid 
abnormality prevalence (PET in female vs male: normal cognition, 25% vs 25%; subjective 
cognitive decline, 27% vs 27%; mild cognitive impairment, 50% vs 50%; CSF in female 
vs male: normal cognition, 34% vs 33%; subjective cognitive decline, 36% vs 36%; mild

cognitive impairment, 60% vs 60%; P = .45), and there were no interactions between sex 
and age, diagnosis, biomarker modality, or APOE ε4 carrier status. Higher educational level 
was associated with higher prevalence of amyloid abnormality regardless of age, cognitive 
status, APOE ε4 carrier status, and biomarker modality (mean difference, 2%−3%; 95% CI, 
1%−5%; P = .001) (eFigure 5A and B in the Supplement). Amyloid abnormality prevalence 
was similar across geographical regions (eg, PET in normal cognition: North America, 24% 
[95% CI, 21%−29%]; Asia, 24% [95% CI, 16%−35%]; Europe, 24% [95% CI, 18%−31%]; 
Australia, 29% [95% CI, 27%−32%]; P = .12).

Amyloid Abnormality Prevalence in Clinical AD Dementia

With cohort-provided cutoffs, amyloid abnormality estimates were higher with PET vs CSF 
biomarkers (87% vs 79%; mean difference, 8%; 95% CI, 0%−16%; P = .04) and decreased 
with age (from 91% at age 50 years to 83% at age 90 years for PET vs from 84% at age 50 
years to 72% at age 90 years for CSF; P = .03) (Figure 1; eFigure 2A and eTable 9 in the 
Supplement).

With adjusted CSF cutoffs, CSF-based amyloid abnormality estimates increased and became 
similar to PET-based estimates (mean difference, 4%; 95% CI, −2% to 9%; P = .18; further 
analyses were not corrected for biomarker modality). The decrease of amyloid abnormality 
prevalence with older age became no longer significant (Table 2, Figure 1; eFigure 2B and 
eTable 11 in the Supplement).

APOE ε4 carrier status was associated with higher amyloid abnormality prevalence, 
with a mean prevalence of 80% for noncarriers, 87% for heterozygotes, and 97% for 
homozygotes (mean difference: noncarriers vs heterozygotes, 7% [95%CI,−7% to 21%; P 
= .33]; noncarriers vs homozygotes, 17% [95% CI, 7%−28%; P = .002]; heterozygotes vs 
homozygotes, 10% [95% CI, 4%−17%; P = .002]) (eFigure 6 in the Supplement). APOE 
ε4 noncarriers no longer showed a steeper decrease in amyloid abnormality than APOE 
ε4 carriers, as previously observed (age × APOE P=.37). Sex was not associated with 
amyloid abnormality (AD dementiain female vs male,86%vs85%;P = .47). The association 
of educational level with amyloid abnormality depended on age (age × education P = .02). 
Higher educational level was associated with higher amyloid abnormality prevalence at 
age 60 years (mean difference, 7%; 95% CI, 1%−13%; P = .02), whereas at older ages, 
educational level was not associated with amyloid abnormality (mean difference, 4%;95% 
CI,−1%to9%;P = .11)(eFigure 5 in the Supplement). Among persons with clinical AD 
dementia, amyloid abnormality prevalence was higher in Australia at 98% than in Europe 
at 84%, Asia at 85%, and North America at 85% (mean difference, 13%−14%; 95% CI, 
7%−24%; P = .002) (eFigure 7 in the Supplement). However, the number of participants 
with clinical AD dementia from Australia was relatively small (n = 107), with data from 
only 2 cohorts (1 population-based and 1 clinical) compared with 535 participants from 
8 North American cohorts, 242 participants from 5 Asian cohorts, and 1376 participants 
from 28 European cohorts. The prevalence of amyloid abnormality was similar across mild 
(85%; 95% CI, 81%−88%), moderate (88%; 95% CI, 84%−91%), and severe (87%; 95% CI, 
78%−92%) AD dementia cases; taking into account APOE ε4 carrier status, the prevalence 
rates for those with noncarrier status vs carrier status were 74% (95% CI, 68%−79%) vs

92% (95% CI, 89%−95%) for mild, 84% (95% CI, 73%−91%) vs 96% (95% CI, 92%−98%) 
for moderate, and 84% (95% CI, 64%−94%) vs 96% (95% CI, 88%−98%) for severe AD 
dementia (P = .17 vs P = .09) (eTable 12 and eFigure 8 in the Supplement).

CSF- vs PET-Based Prevalence in Individuals With Both Measurements

In 21 cohorts with amyloid abnormality measured by both CSF and PET biomarkers in 
the same individuals (n = 1571 of 19 097 [8.2%]), 83% of the individuals (1304) had a 
concordant amyloid abnormality status (eTable 13 in the Supplement for comparison of 
individuals with concordant or discordant status). Amyloid abnormality prevalence using 
adjusted CSF cutoffs in persons with normal cognition (n = 477) was 34% (95% CI, 
27%−42%) for CSF and 24% (95% CI, 17%−32%) for PET; in persons with subjective 
cognitive decline (n = 194), it was 31% (95% CI, 23%−40%) for CSF and 33% (95% CI, 
26%−41%) for PET; in persons with mild cognitive impairment (n = 627), it was 53% (95% 
CI, 46%−59%) for CSF and 53% (95% CI, 45%−61%) for PET; and in persons with clinical 
AD dementia (n = 273), it was 67% (95% CI, 52%−80%) for CSF and 81% (95% CI, 
68%−90%) for PET.

In a post hoc analysis, we compared amyloid abnormality estimates in cohorts with 
quantitatively vs visually rated PET scans but did not find a difference (mean difference 
quantitive vs visual in persons without dementia and those with dementia: 4% [95% CI, 
−6% to 13%; P = .46] vs 5% [95% CI, −2% to 12%]; P = .14).

Discussion

In this study, we estimated the prevalence of amyloid abnormality among 19 097 persons 
from 85 studies participating in the Amyloid Biomarker Study. Prevalence estimates based 
on cohort-provided PET and CSF cutoffs for participants with normal cognition, subjective 
cognitive decline, or mild cognitive impairment remained largely similar to the 2015 
estimates, which included fewer cases.6 The narrower CIs in the present study indicate 
more precise estimates especially in younger age groups. The CSF cutoff adjustment based 
on an unbiased gaussian mixture modeling approach identified 10% higher prevalence rates 
in persons without dementia, indicating that preclinical and prodromal AD may be more 
prevalent than previously estimated.

The higher prevalence of amyloid abnormality in individuals with normal cognition, 
subjective cognitive decline, or mild cognitive impairment, which was measured using 
adjusted CSF cutoffs compared with PET imaging, is in line with previous findings in 
individuals without dementia.18–21 This finding could mean that CSF assessment of amyloid 
abnormality is more sensitive than PET assessment. Because most PET studies applied a 
visual reading, which may be less sensitive than a quantitative reading,22,23 we compared 
differences in amyloid abnormality between the 2 methods but did not find a difference. In 
the subsample with both biomarker modalities available, CSF estimates were higher than 
PET estimates in persons with normal cognition only. The question of whether CSF-based 
estimates are more sensitive than PET-based estimates for amyloid abnormality among 
people without dementia should be explored in studies that use both modalities and monitor 
the point at which PET abnormality follows CSF abnormality.

In clinical AD dementia, amyloid abnormality prevalence was lower with cohort-provided 
cutoffs for CSF than for PET estimates, whereas after CSF cutoff adjustment estimates were 
similar, suggesting again that uncorrected cutoffs might be too conservative. In a direct 
comparison of PET to CSF in persons with dementia, more than 90% of the results were 
concordant and the prevalence of amyloid abnormality in CSF was lower than on PET scans. 
Although both PET and CSF measurements in persons with dementia were available from 
relatively few cohorts, this result may reflect lower production of soluble amyloid forms in 
CSF as opposed to cumulative amyloid burden measured with PET in the dementia stage.24–
26

The amyloid abnormality prevalence estimates in individuals without dementia are partly 
in line with the PET-based estimates from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of 
Aging (MCSA), which was not included in the Amyloid Biomarker Study.27 The PET-based 
estimates at age 85 years in individuals with normal cognition and subjective cognitive 
decline (38% and 41%, respectively, as shown in eTable 9 in the Supplement) were similar 
to that of the MCSA estimate (41%) at age 80 to 89 years. However, at age 50 to 59 years, 
the estimate was only 3% in the MCSA compared with 15% to 17% in the present study (as 
shown in eTable 9 in the Supplement). Also, the amyloid abnormality prevalence estimates 
in persons with mild cognitive impairment were much higher in this study than those in the 
MCSA: 34% vs 0% at age 50 to 59 years, and 65% vs 16% at age 80 to 89 years. These 
higher prevalence estimates may reflect the population-based design of the MCSA compared 
with the mostly research or clinical study settings of the present study.

Older age and APOE ε4 carrier status were associated with higher amyloid abnormality 
prevalence, in accordance with the 2015 results6,7 and with previous studies.28–30 The 
finding that the prevalence in APOE ε4 homozygous carriers started increasing first, 
followed by ε3ε4, ε2ε4, ε3ε3, and ε2ε3, fits largely with the previous findings.6,7 
In addition, we found approximately 10% higher prevalence of PET-based amyloid 
abnormality in ε3ε4 compared with ε2ε4, which is consistent with the protective effect of 
ε2.31,32 In clinical AD dementia, amyloid abnormality prevalence was also higher in APOE 
ε4 homozygotes than APOE ε4 heterozygotes. The 2015 study observed that the prevalence 
of PET-based amyloid abnormality in those with dementia decreased with age, particularly 
for APOE ε4 noncarriers.7 In the present study, however, this age-related decline was less 
prominent and no longer differed between APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers.

Sex was not associated with amyloid abnormality in any disease stage, which is in line with 
previous studies and the MCSA.6,7,33 Higher educational level was associated with a higher 
amyloid abnormality prevalence in persons without dementia, which is in accordance with 
previous findings.6,7 This finding can be explained by delayed expression of amyloid-related 
cognitive decline because of higher cognitive reserve.6,34,35

No associations were found between geographical location and amyloid abnormality in 
persons without dementia, indicating no ethnicity-based difference in amyloid pathology 
prevalence. The higher prevalence in persons with clinical AD dementia in Australia 
should be interpreted cautiously and further investigated because relatively few cases 
originated from this region. Dementia severity was not associated with amyloid abnormality

prevalence, which is in line with the notion that amyloid aggregation is an early marker that 
becomes abnormal years before dementia onset.20,36These estimates may guide health care 
planning, providing potential eligible patient population sizes for antiamyloid therapies, and 
recruitment strategies for clinical trials.

Strengths and Limitations

We combined data that were collected on persons across the AD spectrum within many 
cohorts in various settings and geographical locations. Studying individual participant-level 
data rather than aggregated data increased the statistical power to detect subgroup and 
interaction outcomes37; however, multiple cohorts also used different amyloid assessment 
methods, cutoff definitions, and study designs. The study showed that the potential bias 
introduced by these variations between cohorts might be reduced when using the same 
method to identify the cutoffs in CSF.12,13,16 Nonetheless, we could only apply this method 
to a subset of cohorts that provided continuous data, and some cohorts did not show a 
multimodal distribution.

The use of cohort-specific cutoffs to define abnormal amyloid for cohorts for which no 
data-driven cutoff could be calculated may have led to an underestimation of amyloid 
abnormality in these cohorts. We expect this potential underestimation to be limited 
given that the sample sizes for most of these Amyloid Biomarker Study cohorts included 
were small. Another limitation is the cross-sectional design of the study, which might 
underestimate amyloid abnormality as opposed to lifetime risk estimates. Furthermore, 
generalizability of the findings to the general population might be limited. In addition, 
persons with AD dementia were clinically diagnosed, and it remains unknown whether these 
diagnoses were correct on histopathological examination.

Conclusions

This study found that the prevalence of amyloid abnormality based on data-driven CSF 
cutoffs among persons with normal cognition, subjective cognitive decline, or mild cognitive 
impairment appeared to be 10% higher compared with cohort-provided CSF and PET 
cutoffs. The CSF- and PET-based estimates were similar for those with clinical AD 
dementia. Older age, APOE ε4 gene dose, and higher educational level were associated with 
higher prevalence of amyloid abnormality. These updated estimates suggest that preclinical 
and prodromal AD are more prevalent than previously estimated. The findings may be useful 
in health care planning, providing potential eligible patient population sizes for antiamyloid 
therapies, and in recruitment strategies for clinical trials.

Question

Key Points

What is the prevalence of amyloid abnormality assessed in cerebrospinal fluid or 
on positron emission tomography scans across the clinical Alzheimer disease (AD) 
spectrum?

Findings

This cross-sectional study of 19 097 individuals across the AD spectrum found that, in 
persons without dementia, the cerebrospinal fluid–based amyloid abnormality prevalence 
estimate that used data-driven cutoffs was 10% higher than the positron emission 
tomography–based prevalence estimate that used cohort-provided cutoffs.

Meaning

Findings from this study suggest that preclinical and prodromal AD may be more 
prevalent today than previously anticipated; these updated estimates may inform health 
care planning and recruitment strategies for clinical trials of AD therapies.

Figure 1. Estimated Prevalence of Amyloid Abnormality Based on Cohort-Provided Positron 
Emission Tomography (PET) Cutoffs and Adjusted Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Cutoffs and 
Based on Adjusted CSF Cutoffs, Cohort-Provided CSF Cutoffs, and Cohort-Provided PET 
Cutoffs by Biomarker Modality, Cognitive Status, and Age
In panel A, the solid lines represent the estimated prevalence of amyloid abnormality based 
on cohort-provided PET cutoffs, and the dotted lines represent the estimated prevalence 
based on adjusted CSF cutoffs. For the CSF modality shown in panel B, the solid lines 
represent the estimated prevalence of amyloid abnormality based on adjusted CSF cutoffs, 
and the dotted lines represent the estimated prevalence based on cohort-provided CSF 
cutoffs. For the PET modality, the solid lines represent the estimated prevalence based 
on cohort-provided PET cutoffs. Amyloid abnormality for cohort-provided PET cutoffs 
and adjusted CSF cutoffs in groups with normal cognition, subjective cognitive decline, 
and mild cognitive impairment was modeled using age (statistical significance: P < .001), 
biomarker modality (statistical significance: P = .004), and cognitive status (statistical 
significance: P < .001) as risk factors; amyloid abnormality in the group with Alzheimer 
disease (AD) dementia was modeled6,7 using age (statistical significance: P = .08) and 
biomarker modality (statistical significance: P = .18) as risk factors. Amyloid abnormality 
for cohort-provided CSF cutoffs in groups with with normal cognition, subjective cognitive 
decline, and mild cognitive impairment was modeled using age (statistical significance: P < 
.001), biomarker modality (statistical significance: P > .99), and cognitive status (statistical 
significance: P < .001) as risk factors; and in the group with AD dementia was modeled 
using age (statistical significance: P = .03) and biomarker modality (statistical significance: 
P = .02) as risk factors. Shaded areas indicate 95%CIs.

Figure 2. Estimated Prevalence of Amyloid Abnormality According to Cognitive Status, 
Biomarker Modality, Age, and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 Carrier Status
Amyloid abnormality (based on adjusted cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] cutoffs and cohort-
provided positron emission tomography [PET] cutoffs) in groups with normal cognition, 
subjective cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment was modeled using age 
(statistical significance: P < .001), cognitive status (statistical significance: P < .001), 
biomarker modality (statistical significance: P = .01), APOE ε4 carrier status (statistical 
significance: P < .001), and APOE ε4 carrier status by age (statistical significance: P < 
.001) as risk factors. Shaded areas indicate 95% CIs. Amyloid abnormality in the group with 
Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia was modeled using age (statistical significance: P = .23) 
and APOE ε4 carrier status (statistical significance: P < .001) as risk factors.
