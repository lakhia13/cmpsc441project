Abstract

Conduct Disorder (CD) is a psychiatric diagnosis characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern of behaviour in which
the basic rights of others and major age-appropriate social norms or rules are violated. Callous Unemotional (CU) traits are a
meaningful specifier in subtyping CD for more severe antisocial and aggressive behaviours in adult psychopathology; they
represent the affective dimension of adult psychopathy, but they can be also detected in childhood and adolescence. The
CU traits include lack of empathy, sense of guilt and shallow emotion, and their characterization in youth can improve our
diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic abilities. A strong genetic liability, in interaction with parenting and relevant
environmental factors, can lead to elevated levels of CU traits in children. We pointed out that CU traits can be detected in
early childhood, may remain stable along the adolescence, but a decrease following intensive and specialized treatment is
possible. We here provide a narrative review of the available evidences on CU traits in three main domains: aetiology
(encompassing genetic liability and environmental risk factors), presentation (early signs and longitudinal trajectories) and
treatments.

Background
Conduct Disorder (CD) is a psychiatric diagnosis charac-
terized by a repetitive and persistent pattern of behav-
iour in which the basic rights of others and major age-
appropriate social norms or rules are violated. CD is
among the most frequent clinical conditions in child and
adolescent mental health [1], with a host of social, emo-
tional, and behavioural problems with high costs for the
community. Aggressive
other
persons or animals or properties, as well as deceitful-
ness, theft or other severe violations of rules are the core
features of this disorder [2]. This category, although ne-
cessary for a diagnosis, cannot capture the complexity of
the clinical manifestations of CD, which are highly
heterogeneous in terms of clinical presentation (high or
low level of socialized behaviours, early or late onset,

with impulsive or proactive aggression, high or low rate
of comorbid affective disorders), outcome (remission or
chronicity) and response to treatments (good or poor
response to psychoterapy or pharmachotherapy) [3]. The
fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Health [2] (DSM-5) has defined a new specifier
for the CD diagnosis named “with limited prosocial
emotions” (LPE); this update should help clinicians and
researchers in reducing this heterogeneity, to improve
their diagnostic and prognostic abilities [4, 5].

Psychopathic traits, previously considered as a mean-
ingful
severe antisocial and
aggressive behaviours in adult psychopathology, have
been re-discovered as a relevant factor in subtyping CD
in youth [6]. The current concept of psychopathy comes
from Hervey Cleckley’s seminal paper, describing a
pattern of personality characterized by low levels of em-
pathy and sense of guilt, arrogance, superficial charm, ir-

Subsequent research, based on latent class analysis,
better disentangled this issue in three conceptually sepa-
rated, but
inter-correlated domains: an interpersonal
domain, consisting of grandiose-manipulative traits; an
affective domain, consisting of callous unemotional (CU)
traits; and a behavioural domain, consisting of daring-
impulsive traits [8]. The grandiose-manipulative domain
(also named narcissism) is characterized by verbal and
manipulative abilities, superficial charm, egocentricity
and glibness. The callous unemotional traits consist of
lack of empathy and remorse, with short-lived emotions.
The daring-impulsive domain (also named impulsivity or
psychopathy-related impulsivity) traits include irrespon-
sibility, proneness to boredom, novelty seeking and
antisocial behaviour. Previous research pointed out that
these domains are not exclusive of adult psychopath-
ology, but they can also be found in children and adoles-
leading

psychopathy,
firstly conceptualized by Forth and col-
leagues [10], and further supported by Frick [11] and
Lynam [12]. Subsequent studies [6, 13] confirmed that
the multidimensional structure of adult psychopathy is
detectable also in the adolescent populations. Further-
more,
these studies on children/adolescents strongly
suggested the association between psychopathic per-
sonality traits and conduct problems (CP), namely ag-
gression and law violation [14–16]. As said before,
the, DSM-5 [2] has consolidated this connection, con-
sidering the callous unemotional (CU) traits as the
LPE specifier for the CD. This specifier, defining a
specific subtype of patients with CD,
includes symp-
toms such as lack of remorse or guilt, callous lack of
lack of concern about performance, and
empathy,
shallow or deficient affect. About 12 to 46% of youth
with CD show significant CU traits [17–20]. The
presence of CU traits in children and adolescents
with CD defines a subclass of children characterized
by a poorer adolescence outcome both in clinical and
control samples [21], with increased risk for develop-
ing psychopathy in adulthood, with severe and per-
sistent antisocial behaviour [3].

However, these studies raise the issue of translating
the measures of CU traits into DSM-5 criteria of CD
with LPE. According to DSM-5, CU traits should be
present “persistently over at least 12 months and in
more than one relationship or setting” [2]. Therefore, it
is important to verify whether these features reflect the
child’s typical pattern of
interpersonal and emotional
functioning, and not sporadic occurrences in specific
situations.

Disentangling CD patients through an evaluation of
the presence of CU traits is a crucial component of the
assessment. However, clinical assessment of CU traits
may present specific caveats. Firstly, the stability of CU

traits is not well established, as not all the children pre-
senting these characteristics at the first evaluation will
continue to show them across childhood, and until early
adolescence [22–24]. Many factors may be implicated in
the development and maintenance of the CU traits,
although it is hard to separately test the specific contri-
bution of each element, i.e., genetic vs. environmental,
to the onset and progression of these traits. Children
grow up with their biological parents, thus they receive
the genetic heritage, but at the same time, they are
exposed to parents’ personality traits as well as to par-
enting strategies.

findings about

In the following sections, we narratively summarize
latest
the concept of psychopathy in
childhood, with a specific focus on their translation into
clinical work of health professionals facing with youth
with severe behavioural problems. The review will
specifically focus on CU traits, given their presence as
specifier in DSM-5 criteria of CD. Neuro-cognitive
markers, genetic and environmental influences on CU
onset will be explored, as well as their implications on
developmental trajectories and treatment strategies. We
will not cover neurobiological markers of CD and CU
traits or ways of assessment, and refer readers to other
reviews [9, 25, 26]. See Fig. 1 for a graphical representa-
tion of the concept of psychopathy in children, from a
personality-based as well as from a DSM-5 oriented per-
spectives. In the figure have also been resumed the main
instruments (self- or parent- report questionnaires) for
the evaluation of CU traits in childhood/adolescence; for
an extensive review see the work of Masi et al. [26].

Neurocognitive issues
Previous studies showed that altered neuro-cognitive
functions (e.g. intelligence, attentional network, process-
ing of external stimuli) may underlie dysfunctional
[27]. Similarly, many
features
personality disorder
studies have documented neuro-cognitive correlates of
psychopathy in children and adolescent.

In regard to intelligence, it is generally accepted that
grandiose manipulative (narcissism) domain is linked to
better performances in several cognitive areas, whereas
CU traits were negatively
associated with verbal
intelligence, creativity, practicality and analytic thinking;
finally, the daring-impulsive dimension was positively as-
sociated with measures of creativity, practicality, and
analytic thinking, but not with verbal abilities [28, 29].

In their extensive review Frick et al. [9] pointed out
that youth with CU traits show abnormalities in the pro-
cessing of punishment cues and in the affective empathy
(whereas data on cognitive empathy are more controver-
sial); also, there are clear meta analytic evidences that
antisocial personality is characterized by impairment in
the facial recognition of fear and sadness [30], but also

to other emotions and other way of expression (e.g.
vocal) [31]. Furthermore, it is evident that high CU traits
are associated with a less aversive way to interpret neu-
tral and negative stimuli [32]. It has been suggested that
the levels of CU traits are also associated with a general-
ized impairment in the natural allocation of attention to
emotionally salient stimuli
that results in cascading
errors in recognizing other people’s emotions [33]. All
these findings indicate an altered way of processing
emotions and external stimuli and may explain why
negative reinforcement could fail
in the treatment
process [32].

from 42% to 68% [35–39], and that a great part of
the stability in CU traits during development is genet-
ically driven [36, 40, 41]. These studies also indicate
that, in front of a large shared genetic effect between
the CD and the CU traits, the coexistence of specific
genetic influences for both the constructs suggests
the existence of a partially specific genetic aetiology
[35, 37, 38, 42, 43].

Other factors that may contribute to the onset and the
development of CU traits are represented by parents’
temperament and personality traits and by the parent-
child interaction.

Factors contributing to the onset and
development of CU traits
In 2014 Frick et al. [34], reviewed nine publications
about
the heritability of CU traits and found that
genetically accounted variations of CU traits ranged

Two recent studies involving 561 adopted children
and their biological mothers and adoptive families ex-
plored the first critical issue [44, 45]. In the first study
[44], temperament (fearlessness) of the biological mother

18 months; similarly, low affiliative behaviour of biologic
mothers directly predicted child CU behaviours, although
without any correlation with child affiliative behaviours
tested at 18 months. Furthermore, adoptive mothers with
highly positive parenting buffered the risk for developing
CU traits via fearlessness. In the second study [45], a spe-
cific heritable pathway to CU behaviour was suggested:
antisocial behaviour of the biological mother predicted
CU behaviours of the child in late toddler period. Further-
more, more positively reinforcing mothers buffered inher-
ited risk for early CU behaviours. These relevant studies
strongly suggest that positive parenting has an effect on
buffering genetic predisposition to develop CU traits.

The relation between parenting and CU traits develop-
ment is bidirectional [46]. If the association between
some features of dysfunctional parenting and the pres-
ence of CU traits in offspring has been supported by
previous research, on the other hand children showing
high CU traits can induce negative modifications in
parenting behaviour. Although few studies specifically
explored these mutual influences, preliminary evidences
suggest
that CU traits may be more predictive of
changes in parenting over time than parenting on
changes in CU traits [47, 48]. Some studies indicated
that the presence of CU traits in children with CD is as-
sociated with low warmth in parenting [49, 50], others
found harsh, inconsistent, and coercive discipline to be
highly associated with CP in youth with normative levels
of CU traits [50–55]. Viding, Fontaine, Oliver, & Plomin
[56], in their study on monozygotic twins, found that
negative parental discipline operates as a non-shared en-
vironmental risk factor for developing CP during the
transition to early adolescence, but not for the develop-
ment of CU traits.

However, studies investigating the association between
quality of parenting and prospective change in CU traits
in preschool samples have found that multiple domains
of parenting (positive parenting, parental
involvement,
and poor monitoring/supervision) uniquely predicted
changes in CU traits [47], and that high CU traits at ages
3–4 were predicted by parent harshness [57]. Other
studies have investigated the direct prediction of CU
traits by parenting in middle and late childhood. Loney,
Huntenburg, Counts-Allan, and Schmeelk [58] assessed
the intergenerational continuity of psychopathic traits,
and found that the association was mediated by parent-
ing. Parental-reported corporal punishment and child-
reported parental warmth/involvement predicted CU
traits, as children with low levels of anxiety who
reported low parental warmth showed increased CU fea-
tures 1 year later [59]. Other studies have related an in-
crease
to parental
psychological aggression and inconsistency [60], or to
poor supervision, physical punishment, and poor parent-

characteristics

child communication [61], or to maternal reports of
harsh parenting at age 4 [62]. On the contrary, Vitacco,
Neumann, Ramos, and Roberts [63] found that poor
parental monitoring and inconsistent discipline were
both related to impulsivity and narcissism, but not to
CU traits.

In a recent publication exploring developmental trajec-
tories of CU traits, youth with persisting high CU traits
had experienced more maternal harshness, low parental
knowledge, and monitoring compared to the moderate
or low CU youth groups [64]. More specifically, harsh-
ness increased significantly across groups from low to
high CU traits, and youth with low CU traits reported
higher parental warmth, but there were no differences
between the warmth reported by high compared to
moderated groups.

In a study about effects of positive and negative par-
enting practices on the levels of child CU in 126 Italian
children treated by a multi-modal approach including
parent-training, Muratori et al. [65] found that increased
levels of positive parenting predicted a decrease in the
levels of CU traits in children. In addition, low levels of
CU traits at the intermediate evaluation promoted an in-
crease of positive parenting 1 year later. In contrast to
previous studies [56], they found that negative parenting
practices are unrelated to the level of CU traits when
positive parenting is taken into account. Finally, Waller,
Shaw and Hyde [66] observed that
the presence of
fearlessness at 24 months predicted CU behaviours at
42 months, but only when parents exhibited low levels
of positive parenting. Furthermore, they showed that this
association had a lasting effect on the presence of CU
behaviour at 11–12 years. In summary, all these data
suggest that the trajectory of children at high risk for
CU behaviours could be modified by high levels of
positive parenting [67].

In addition to parenting, other environmental and so-
cial factors can influence the development of CU traits
and, in turn, parenting itself can be influenced by social
context (as it as been theorized in 1984 by Belsky [68]).
Recently, Waller et al. [67] applied Belsky’s model in re-
lation to the development of CU behaviour. They found
that parental warmth at age 2 uniquely predicted parent-
reported CU behaviour at ages 10–12, controlling for
both concurrent AB and early contextual risk factors
across domains [69]. In addition, there was a direct
association between neighborhood impoverishment and
higher CU behaviour at ages 10–12 and age 20. More-
over, contextual risk and maternal characteristics were
indirectly linked to later child CU behaviour by shaping
less warm parenting style. These data strengthen the
concept that a negative parenting style may enhance the
developing of CU behaviour and/or AB, particularly
among families with low socio-economic status [46, 67].

Tuvblad and colleagues’ study [70] on genetic and envir-
onmental determinants of the psychopathic personality in a
community sample of 5-year-old twins indicated that both
genetic and shared environmental influences are of import-
ance for psychopathy personality traits in childhood. Re-
garding the CU dimension, they found a moderate (25%)
genetic influence and a higher (48%) shared environmental
influence. Shared environmental risk factors include family
related factors (e.g., neglect, parental stressors) and context-
ual factors in the surrounding community.

A recent study from Kahn, Deatre-Deckard, King-
Casas and Kim-Spoon [71] has investigated the influ-
ences of both parenting and household environment on
the intergenerational similarity in CU traits. They found
a mediating role of hostile parenting in the association
between parent and adolescent CU traits, especially in
the context of high household chaos. They concluded
that there is a heightened vulnerability to intergenera-
tional transmission of these traits in a contest of house-
hold chaos that may exacerbate the effects of hostile
parenting on CU traits during adolescence.

A recent meta-analysis showed that low family socio-
economic status is associated with higher levels of
children’s antisocial behaviours, and indicated that this
relationship is stronger when CU traits are considered
as outcome variables [72]. Previous researches [39, 73]
consistently found that low family’s socio-economic sta-
tus is the most important predictor of high CU traits. In
the study by Muratori et al. [24] involving children with
disruptive behaviour disorder, a higher level of socio-
economic status at baseline was related to lower level of
CU traits. Markowitz et al. [74] extended their research
from the family to the neighborhood socio-economic
context, by comparing the associations between high-
CU traits and delinquency across adolescents living in
high-, medium- and low-income neighborhoods in a
non clinical sample. They confirmed the association be-
tween CU traits and delinquency;
they
found that
living in high-
income neighborhood hasn’t a protective effect on the
likelihood to engage in delinquency compared to the
moderate income, high-CU peer group. They also found
that neighborhood context has an effect on the type, ra-
ther than the extent, of delinquency in which high-CU
individuals are involved. In their sample CU traits were
more strongly predictive of violent delinquency in low-
income neighborhoods and of instrumental delinquency
in high-income neighborhoods. Waller et al. [64], found
that higher levels of exposure to violence predicted both
moderate and high CU traits trajectories, while no asso-
ciations were found between neighbourhood disorder
and CU traits trajectory.

for high-CU individuals,

furthermore,

Previous studies have also investigated the relations
between children/adolescents with high CU and peers

group (for an extensive review see [34], paragraph
“Parenting and Peer Risk Factors”).
In Barker and
Salekin’s study [75], experience of peer victimization at
age 10 predicted CU traits at age 13 in children with a
high score on a measure of irritability. Another charac-
teristic of children and adolescents with CD and high
CU traits may be a higher inclination to join with anti-
to
social and delinquent peers, and consequently,
commit crimes in groups [76], compared to children and
adolescents with CD but without CU traits [77]. How-
ever, Kerr et al. [78], suggest that adolescents with high
CU traits could be less likely influenced by deviant peers
group in putting into effect antisocial behaviours, but
conversely, they could have a role in influencing anti-
social behaviours of their group.

individual differences

Early signs and developmental trajectories
Although most of the studies about CU traits associated
to CD are focused on children and adolescents, more re-
cently the interest has been expanded to early childhood
and toddler age, in order to detect early sings of CU be-
haviours. The possibility of detecting the origins of CU
traits early in childhood is given by the emerging know-
ledge about
in empathy and
conscience as early as at the age of 2 or 3 years [79].
Consequently,
several measures were developed or
adapted to specifically assess possible precursors of CU
traits (for a review see [80]). Aim of these studies is a
timely identification of children at high risk of develop-
ing CD or antisocial behaviours,
in a developmental
phase with more malleable behaviour, when early inter-
ventions can be more effective [81]. In this earlier age,
“CU behaviours” is a more adequate definition rather
than “CU traits”, given the lesser evidences about their
stability over time [67].

Higher CU behaviours in children as early as 3 year-
old are related to lower guilt and empathy, more pro-
active aggression [67], and, perspectively, to CU traits in
late childhood [67, 82, 83].

In his seminal work about the neurobiological basis of
psychopathy, Blair [84] proposed that CU traits and be-
haviours emerge from a fearless temperament expressed
through low arousal to others’ distress and punishment,
leading to reduced learning about the consequences of
harmful behaviours, and increasing the risk of CU
behaviours. The measure of CU behaviours in children
focuses on the presence of lack of empathy and guilt, in
addition to a reduced emotional responsivity to others’
feelings or cues [21]. As a possible early indicator of CU
behaviours in the adoption study mentioned above,
Waller et al. [44] showed that the experimental observa-
tion of higher fearlessness and low affiliative behaviours
at 18 months were related to higher CU behaviours re-
ferred by adoptive mothers at 27 months.

Recently, Goffin et al. [85] published the results of a long-
term longitudinal study exploring early antecedents of CU
traits and their evolution in typically developing children
from toddler age to 12. They use observational measures to
score guilt (in breaking a valued object situation), empathy
(hurting the parent during play) and fearlessness in toddlers
and preschoolers, and related these findings tolater parent-
rated measures of CU traits and externalizing behaviours
during scholar and pre-adolescent age. They found that
children who were unconcerned to transgression (either
breaking objects or hurting others) early in development
exhibited higher CU traits in middle childhood. However,
those links were moderated by child’s early temperament,
being significant only in children high on fearlessness and
not in fearful ones.

The developmental stability of CU traits has been in-
vestigated in several studies. In their review, Frick et al.
[34] report a relative stability of CU traits from the age
of 3–4 years-old according to parent rating. Although
the CU trait levels tend to decreases across childhood
and adolescence in a large number of children, those
showing an elevated level of CU traits are at higher risk
for keeping them in older ages. Other longitudinal
studies have suggested that CU traits are relatively stable
across childhood, and from childhood to adolescence.
Dadds and colleagues [22] found moderate 1-year stabil-
ity estimates for features of callousness (r = .55) in a
community sample of young Australian children. Frick
and colleagues [86] reported high 4-year stability esti-
mates for parent ratings of callousness (interclass correl-
ation = .71) from late childhood to middle adolescence.
A more recent study of longitudinal invariance found
stability of CU was moderate
that
(r = .50, p < .001) during an 8-year period from child-
hood into adolescence among boys
[87]. Fontaine,
McCrory, Boivin, Moffitt, and Viding [73], using a
person-centered approach (growth mixture modeling),
showed that in children substantial decreases in CU
traits across development were more common than sub-
stantial increases (see also Frick et al., [86]).

the rank-order

Also, Klingzell et al. [88] investigated joint trajectories
of CU traits and conduct problems during early child-
hood in a community sample and found a close relation-
ship between them (e.g. CU and conduct problems tend
to decrease together or remain stable together) and with
fearlessness and psychopathic traits. Despite the differ-
ences in stability across studies, these estimates of stabil-
ity
reported for others
to those
psychopathological constructs [89].

Treatment
Conduct problems are usually highly impairing social,
familial, and school functioning, and a management of

this impairment is needed. Some specifiers, such as CU
traits (or LPE DSM-5 specifier), as well as early age of
onset of symptoms and comorbidities, should promote
more timely referrals, assessments, and possibly an in-
tensive treatment, and follow-ups.

The treatment of CP among children and adolescents
with CU traits has been explored in depth, but so far,
neither a proven psychological nor a definitive psycho-
pharmacological treatment is available [90]. A recent sys-
tematic review by Hawes, Price, and Dadds [91] showed
that CU traits were associated with increased risk for poor
post-treatment outcomes. However, recent research has
also suggested that children and adolescents with elevated
CU traits are not “untreatable” and that they can improve
with intensive treatments, tailored to the unique emo-
tional, cognitive, and motivational styles [92].

Some recent and promising treatments specifically focused
in ameliorating CU traits in the context of behavioural prob-
lems will be presented below and summarized in Table 1.

Coaching and Rewarding Emotional Skills (CARES)
Module is a brief emotional training program for assist-
ing empathy and emotional development
in young
children with CP and CU traits. The CARES module
was designed to be delivered to children between the
ages of 3.5 and 8 years with non-normative levels of CU
traits immediately after completion of parent manage-
ment training, and when CP have been reduced to below
clinical significance. CARES is the first targeted treat-
young children to ameliorate
ment designed for
empathy-related deficits in processing negative emotions
central to CU traits. The key treatment objectives of
CARES are: (a) to enhance attention to critical facial
cues signalling distress in child, parents and others, to
improve emotion recognition and labelling; (b) improve
emotional understanding by linking emotion to context,
and by identifying contexts and situations that elicit
teach prosocial and
child anger and frustration;
empathic behaviour through social stories, parent mod-
elling, and role play; (d) increase emotional labelling and
prosocial behaviour through positive reinforcement; (e)
and increase child’s frustration tolerance through model-
ling, role-playing, and reinforcing child’s use of learned
cognitive-behavioural strategies to decrease the inci-
dence of aggressive behaviours. Datyner et al. [93], in a
case study, provided initial support for the short-term
effectiveness of a brief adjunctive module to a PT inter-
vention, to address empathy and emotions recognition
deficits, and CU traits in children with CP + CU.

intervention for clinically referred
children with high CU traits. The ERT was partly based
on the MindReading [95] program originally developed
to train children with autism to accurately identify and
interpret emotional expressions in interpersonal con-
texts. Mind Reading is a reference framework covering
the entire spectrum of human emotions. Using the soft-
ware, people can explore over 400 emotions, seeing and
hearing each one performed by six different people. It
includes an Emotion Library, a Learning Centre and a
Game Zone. Studies showed that ERT produced signifi-
cant
improvements in affective empathy and CP in
children with CD and high CU traits [94]. The associ-
ation of ERT and PT seems to increase the level of recip-
rocated eye contact
[91], and this should lead to
enhancement of parent-child relationship.

Salekin et al. [96] tested a positive psychological inter-
vention, named Mental Models, to reduce the behaviour
problems in youth with higher CU traits. Using a com-
bination of motivational techniques, cognitive behaviour
training, and instruction on positive emotion, youth
received 12 didactic sessions. The intervention was
group-focused and included group sizes of four to 24
(mode = 6). The first group included all youth (n = 24),
and the group size was then reduced to six individuals
per group. The intervention involved a motivational
component, whereby youth were motivated to partici-
pate in treatment. This component included some dis-
cussions on brain development and the new neural
connections that can result through the process of active
learning. Each week, many of the exercises were geared
toward increasing positive emotions and positive ways of
interacting with other

Although these new interventions specifically devel-

promising, other more traditional treatments addressed
for behavioural problems are available [25]. The Coping

program, delivered in a group setting, and has been
developed using a contextual social–cognitive model as
a conceptual
framework for identifying intervention
objectives [97]. The contextual social–cognitive model
focuses on the contextual parenting processes, and on
children’s sequential cognitive processing in the develop-
ment and escalation of children’s behavioural problems.
The CopingPower-child component includes 36 group
sessions delivered over 12 months.
In addition, 16
parent sessions are delivered over the same period.
Parents also participate in small group sessions of five
families; usually one parent per family attends the
sessions. The child and his/her parent receive the
treatment on the same day.

A recent study [98] found that the Coping Power pro-
gram can lead to a significant decrease in CU traits, and
this reduction was maintained at the 1-year follow-up
evaluation. Authors hypothesized that the specific inter-
vention on parenting practices promoted the decrease in

therapy can improve emotion sharing with peers,
children’s understanding of other people’s emotions, and
consequently has a beneficial influence on their empathy
as well [99].

Regarding medications, a recent review [100] suggests
that methylphenidate and risperidone present the largest
effects on aggression, while other antipsychotics show
clinical efficacy on CD, but
this evidence is mainly
supported by open label trials. There is some low quality
evidence to support a small effect of mood stabilizers
and other agents. Nevertheless, antipsychotic drugs are
associated with meaningful adverse events
(namely
metabolic disturbances such as obesity, diabetes, dyslip-
idemia [101, 102] that requires great caution in their use
in childhood. No drug treatments specifically work for
CU traits, and they may be predictors of poor response
to pharmacological treatments in CD, although data are
still
inconclusive [100, 103]. We have recently shown
that a pharmacotherapy may constitute an important

Discussion
The aim of this paper was to provide a brief review of
the main features of childhood psychopathy, and specif-
ically on the CU traits, which represent its affective
dimension (e.g. which encompasses multiple deficits in
emotional processing). Paediatricians manage the health
of children and adolescents since their birth, including
behaviour and mental health issues, and, usually, they
are the primary care specialists who provide the first
contact for children and their families. Therefore, they
could represent the first step in identifying the presence
of CU traits, and the possible developmental pathways
to antisocial behaviours, and in promoting early inter-
ventions. Additionally, considering the caveats in clinical
assessment, paediatricians may help to identify the
“persistently over at least 12 months and in more than
one relationship or setting” DMS-5 criterion.

This and other reviews [21, 26, 46, 72, 79] clearly dem-
onstrate that CU traits are highly heritable, that a timely
identification is possible, since early years, and that they
are associated with identifiable environmental
risk
factors. Also, they can be targeted with specific interven-
tions, and, to some extent, partially modifiable. Well de-
signed longitudinal
and
intervention, mainly in clinical samples, are needed to
further
their
developmental
predictors, and how CU traits alone or interacting with
behavioural symptoms predict the outcomes.

studies, both naturalistic

trajectories,

delineate

Implications are straightforward. A thorough knowledge
of family interactions, easily available for paediatricians, is
crucial for early identification as well for a therapeutic

alliance with parents and children. Some of the existing
instruments can be possibly implemented in paediatric
settings [26], even if an easier and quicker questionnaire,
more suitable for a population based screen, is still lack-
ing. Further researches should fill this gap.

The identification of behavioural problems and CU
traits during childhood may be helpful to promote early
interventions. As pointed out in the paper, there are cur-
rently available some promising treatment programs,
specifically addressed for children and adolescents with
CD and high level of CU traits (e.g., Coping Power
Program, CARES, ERT, Mental Models), whose main
targets are the improvement of emotion recognition, the
enhancement of prosocial and empathic behaviour, and
the improvement of parenting skills. Well designed, ran-
domized trials should be the next step for evidence
based treatments directly targeting CU traits.

Conclusion
As a summary, we conclude that a strong genetic liability,
in interaction with parenting and relevant environmental
factors, can lead to elevated levels of CU traits; they can
be detected in early childhood, may remain stable along
the adolescence, but a possible decrease following inten-
sive and specialized treatment is possible. We maintain
that a strict collaboration among paediatricians, child psy-
chiatrists, clinical psychologists and all other professionals
devoted to child mental and physical health is needed to
early detection and management of these severely im-
paired patients.
