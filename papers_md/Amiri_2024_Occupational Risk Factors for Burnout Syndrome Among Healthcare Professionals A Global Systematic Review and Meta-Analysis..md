Abstract: Health professionals are disproportionately affected by burnout compared to other occu-
pational groups. This study aims to systematically review and meta-analyze thirteen occupational
risk factors related to burnout syndrome among health professionals globally. A comprehensive
literature search was conducted in August 2023. The protocol was registered in The International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), registration number CRD42023396081.
Using a random-effects model, this meta-analysis assessed the association between occupational
risk factors and burnout, reporting odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The meta-
analysis included 109 studies from diverse global locations. Key factors influencing burnout included
workplace bullying, job stress, and poor communication, with protective factors such as supportive
work environments, adequate staffing, and individual resilience. All risk factors examined showed a
significant positive relationship with burnout incidence. Workplace bullying was strongly associated
with increased burnout (OR 4.05–15.01, p < 0.001). Similarly, low job satisfaction and high job stress
were strongly associated with burnout, with ORs of 5.05 (95% CI 3.88–6.56, p < 0.001) and 4.21 (95%
CI 1.62–10.94, p = 0.003), respectively. The review findings highlight the importance of address-
ing these risk factors through enhanced supportive work environments and promoting personal
resilience strategies.

1. Introduction

Burnout syndrome is a condition characterized by the inability to effectively man-
age work-related stress, leading to three key elements: feelings of exhaustion or energy
depletion, increased mental distance or negative feelings towards one’s job, and reduced
professional efficacy [1]. The study of burnout has been primarily driven by Maslach, who
developed a widely used questionnaire that assesses burnout based on three components:
emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (D), and decreased personal accomplishment
(PA) [2,3].

Burnout syndrome is a widespread phenomenon across various occupational set-
tings [4], with a particularly important focus on the healthcare industry [5,6]. Studies have
found a significant prevalence of burnout syndrome among healthcare professionals [5–7],
with a global study reporting a prevalence rate of 67.0% [5]. Physicians are particularly

susceptible to burnout, with a 15-fold higher risk compared to other professionals [8].
Emergency physicians, in particular, have been found to have high rates of burnout, with
88.6% experiencing medium to high emotional exhaustion and 82.8% experiencing medium
to high depersonalization [9]. The global prevalence of burnout syndrome among nurses is
11.2% [10]. Healthcare professionals face unique stressors and challenges that contribute to
burnout. Experiencing intense situations, working long hours, having a high patient load,
and being exposed to trauma and suffering often all contribute to burnout [5–7]. Burnout
syndrome negatively impacts various job dimensions, physical health, and productivity
beyond the individual. Furthermore, burnout syndrome has been linked to a higher risk of
medical errors, highlighting the importance of proactive measures. The COVID-19 pan-
demic has further exacerbated burnout syndrome among healthcare professionals, leading
to a plethora of studies on this topic [11–14].

Various factors can contribute to burnout syndrome in health professionals, includ-
ing age, marital status, lack of control over work, job seniority, work shifts, and work
demands [15–21]. A broad range of studies have examined the risk factors of burnout syn-
drome in health professionals, and some of these factors have been examined [15,17,21–27].
Despite the large amount of literature about burnout syndrome among health pro-
fessionals and a detailed review of studies that have examined occupational risk factors
for burnout syndrome in this population, several issues emerged that provided the ba-
sis for this research. Firstly, no comprehensive global study has addressed occupational
burnout syndrome risk factors. What has been done has mostly focused on investigating
the prevalence of occupational burnout syndrome or has examined only some risk factors
of occupational burnout. Identifying the underlying factors of burnout syndrome can
increase insight and help make health policy more robust. In addition, we do not know
which occupational risk factors contribute the most to burnout syndrome, in other words,
the hierarchy of occupational risk factors for burnout syndrome in healthcare professionals.
In this study, thirteen occupational risk factors related to burnout syndrome are sys-
tematically reviewed and meta-analyzed, and a hierarchy of the most important causes are
presented. This research, therefore, aims to provide the most comprehensive and complete
analysis of occupational risk factors and burnout syndrome in health professionals.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Registration and Protocol

The research protocol was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards [28], as depicted in the PRISMA check-
list (Supplementary File S1). The protocol was registered in The International Prospec-
tive Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), registration number CRD42023396081
(Supplementary File S2).

2.2. Eligibility Criteria

The inclusion criteria for the current study included the following: (1) The study
population was health professionals. (2) Cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies
were eligible. (3) To reduce selection bias, a minimum sample size of 100 participants was
considered for each study. These studies were not eligible: (1) Studies whose population
was volunteers were not eligible. (2) Studies that did not report enough data to calculate
the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.

2.3. Information Sources

This research systematically searched three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and
Scopus) and manually searched one gray literature database (Google Scholar). To retrieve
more studies, the references of similar studies were checked. For the systematic search, a
keyword syntax was used for each database. The search in these databases was carried
out until August 2023, and all the manuscripts were included from the beginning of
their formation.

2.4. Search Strategy

This review was conducted following the PRISMA standards [29]. SA and MABK
conducted each stage of the review procedure separately. Both authors individually evalu-
ated each obtained record from the systematic and manual search using the predetermined
keywords (Supplementary S3). In addition, they independently performed the risk of bias
evaluation for each paper that was included (Supplementary S4). Disagreements between
SA and MABK were addressed and resolved through consensus or by engaging a third
reviewer, NM. Initially, data extraction was performed by one reviewer. However, this
procedure was later modified to incorporate independent verification by the second author.

2.5. Selection Process

First, the studies were stored in a file and screened based on the title and abstract.
All the authors participated in this process. After identifying potentially eligible studies,
all their full texts were collected. In the process of screening the articles, all the authors
worked independently. Regarding the final studies, the articles were screened interac-
tively. In general, screening included four components: population, exposure, comparison,
and outcomes.

2.6. Data Collection Process

Data was first extracted in August 2023. Each author synthesized a subset of eligible
studies and extracted the necessary data. This process was independent, but, in the end,
each mutually rechecked the extracted data from the other authors.

2.7. Data Items

The exposure variables in this research included a variety of occupational factors,
including job demands, working hours, job stress, job strain, social support at work,
job satisfaction, job control, job insecurity, workload, work–life imbalance, effort–reward
imbalance, violence at work, and workplace bullying. The definitions of each of these were
based on the definitions in the eligible articles. The outcome variable of interest in this
study was burnout syndrome. The measurement of this variable was also based on the
models briefly included in the Supplementary table (Supplementary S4).

2.8. Study Risk of Bias Assessment

In measuring the risk of bias, the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality
Assessment Tool [30,31] was used as a reliable tool that included four dimensions: selection
bias, confounders bias, data collection method bias, and withdrawals and dropouts bias
(Supplementary S5).

2.9. Effect Measures

In this research, the effect size used was an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.
The odds ratio and the standard error of the odds ratio were used to check for heterogeneity
and publication bias.

2.10. Synthesis Methods

Eligible studies were able to calculate the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval;
based on this, studies that reported the following indicators in the relationship between the
exposure variable and the outcome were included in the meta-analysis: odds ratio and 95%
confidence interval reported; or the Pearson correlation coefficient and sample size; or the
mean, standard deviation, and sample size in the case and control groups. The data were
converted to the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval by Comprehensive meta-analysis-3
software [32]. The standard error for the odd ratio was also calculated. This procedure
was performed for all levels of exposure variables. In the following, the heterogeneity
was checked using the heterogeneity chi-squared test and I2 [33,34]. Selection bias was
assessed as part of the analyses using a funnel plot, Egger’s test, and the trim-and-fill

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 1583

method [35–37]. “The ‘trim and fill’ method aims both to identify and correct for funnel
plot asymmetry arising from publication bias. The basis of the method is to (1) ‘trim’
(remove) the smaller studies causing funnel plot asymmetry, (2) use the trimmed funnel
plot to estimate the true ‘centre’ of the funnel, then (3) replace the omitted studies and their
missing ‘counterparts’ around the centre (filling)” [38]. “Egger’s test is commonly used to
assess potential publication bias in a meta-analysis via funnel plot asymmetry (Egger’s test
is a linear regression of the intervention effect estimates on their standard errors weighted
by their inverse variance)” [38]. In the review of publication bias, the number of 10 studies
was considered as a cut-off point [39].

3.1. Study Selection

Figure 1 depicts the screening process for the studies. The studies were screened step
by step. Finally, based on this study’s eligibility criteria, 109 studies [39–147] were selected,
listed in the Supplementary table (Supplementary S4).

5.2. Job Demand and Burnout Syndrome

In the relationship between job demand and burnout syndrome, 22 studies were
included in the meta-analysis, as shown in Figure 3. Based on the obtained result, the odds
ratio was equal to 3.14, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.56–3.86 (p < 0.001; Z = 10.91;
I2 = 82.43).

5.3. Workload and Burnout Syndrome

In the relationship between workload and burnout syndrome, 16 studies were included
in the meta-analysis, as shown in Figure 4. Based on the result, the odds ratio was equal to
1.97, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.09–3.55 (p = 0.024; Z = 2.26; I2 = 98.32).

5.4. Job Stress and Burnout Syndrome

Job stress incorporates the psychological and emotional response to workplace chal-
lenges and conditions. Job stress is influenced not only by structural elements like de-
mands and control but also by individual perceptions, coping mechanisms, and support
systems, reflecting an individual’s subjective appraisal of stressors and their impact on
well-being [148]. In the relationship between job stress and burnout syndrome, 15 studies
were included in the meta-analysis, as shown in Figure 5. Based on the result, the odds
ratio was equal to 4.21, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.62–10.94 (p = 0.003; Z = 2.95;
I2 = 99.17).

5.5. Low Social Support at Work and Burnout Syndrome

In the relationship between low social support at work and burnout syndrome,
15 studies were included in the meta-analysis, as shown in Figure 6. Based on the re-
sult, the odds ratio was equal to 2.04, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.77–2.35 (p < 0.001;

5.7. Job Control and Burnout Syndrome

Job control is one of the components of job strain. Based on Karasek’s job demands–control
model, job strain is the combination of high job demands with low job control [4,133,134]. In
the relationship between job control and burnout syndrome, 13 studies were included in

5.9. Effort–Reward Imbalance, Other Stressors, and Burnout Syndrome

Effort–reward imbalance is a mismatch between high efforts spent and low rewards
received at work. In the relationship between effort–reward imbalance and burnout syn-
drome, five studies were included in the meta-analysis, and the odds ratio was equal to
5.90, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.81–19.26 (p = 0.003; Z = 2.94; I2 = 98.38%). In the
relationship between job insecurity and burnout syndrome, two studies were included
in the meta-analysis; the odds ratio was equal to 1.34, with a 95% confidence interval of
1.16–1.55 (p < 0.001; Z = 3.93; I2 = 0%). Job strain, a related yet distinct concept from job
stress, refers to the structural imbalance between job demands and the degree of control
an individual has over their work [148]. While job strain is often an objective measure
based on workplace conditions, job stress is subjective and varies according to personal re-
silience and environmental factors [148]. In the relationship between job strain and burnout
syndrome, three studies were included in the meta-analysis; the odds ratio was equal to
3.03, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.45–6.33 (p = 0.003; Z = 2.95; I2 = 87.93%). In the
relationship between violence at work and burnout syndrome, four studies were included
in the meta-analysis; the odds ratio was equal to 2.58, with a 95% confidence interval of
1.99–3.33 (p < 0.001; Z = 7.18; I2 = 71.41%). In the relationship between workplace bullying
and burnout syndrome, five studies were included in the meta-analysis; the odds ratio was
equal to 7.79, with a 95% confidence interval of 4.05–15.01 (p < 0.001; Z = 6.14; I2 = 92.45%),
The relationship between these stressors and burnout syndrome is depicted in Figure 10.

6. Discussion

The prevalence of burnout varies significantly across different healthcare professions
and settings, ranging from 3.3% to 64.0% [9,15,70,102,117,119,121,130,151–153]. These find-
ings are consistent with previous studies reporting varying burnout rates across professions,
highlighting demographic factors such as age, gender, and marital status as significant
contributors to burnout levels [82,91,122]

In previous studies, health professionals are at high risk of burnout syndrome due
to emotional pressure and a work environment characterized by stress caused by dealing
with patients and the deaths of patients [154,155]. Another prominent factor influenc-
ing burnout in healthcare professionals is secondary traumatic stress (STS), a condition
arising from indirect exposure to trauma, such as through repeated encounters with pa-
tient suffering and death [156]. STS mimics symptoms of direct trauma, including anx-
iety, detachment, and intrusive thoughts, contributing to an intensified emotional toll
on healthcare workers [157]. Evidence suggests that professionals engaged in frequent
end-of-life care experience heightened STS, which exacerbates burnout [158]. Other work-
related factors, including workload, job stress, temporary work contracts, conflicts, ethical
decision-making, and occupational stress, have been identified as significant contributors
to burnout [14,70,72,94,100,107,119,120,138,159–161]. This is supported by studies examin-
ing the impact of job demands, lack of support, and workplace bullying on exacerbating
burnout levels [78,80]. However, while these studies shed light on the adverse effects of a
hostile workplace environment, the complex interplay between individual resilience and
organizational culture deserves further exploration. Nevertheless, these findings under-
score the importance of workload management strategies and the need for organizations to
implement measures to alleviate excessive work demands.

Similarly, workplace bullying, effort–reward imbalance, and low job satisfaction were
among the factors leading to burnout syndrome. As a result, these factors increased the risk

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 1583

12 of 21

of job burnout by nearly eight times, nearly six times, and almost five times, respectively.
Long working hours and lack of job security were factors at the bottom of the hierarchy
of occupational risk factors for burnout syndrome. While extended working hours and
employment stability are relevant, they are often secondary to more significant stressors,
such as workload demands and perceived lack of control [162,163]. Limited autonomy and
decision-making power weigh more heavily on the personal well-being and efficacy of
healthcare professionals and drive burnout more strongly than total work hours or worries
about job security [163,164]. These findings highlight the crucial role these occupational
risk factors play in the development of burnout syndrome among health professionals.
Addressing these workplace stressors is essential for fostering a supportive and safe work
environment conducive to staff well-being.

Burnout syndrome is considered a psychological phenomenon [164]. Therefore, many
factors may influence its psychological dimension. As a result, it comes as no surprise
that occupational risk factors contribute to burnout syndrome. Various mechanisms can
influence burnout syndrome depending on the investigated occupational risk factor. Stud-
ies have shown that occupational risk factors are associated with an increased risk of
depression, which is an important underlying factor in burnout syndrome [165–170]. It is
a vicious cycle and can lead to job inefficiency, reduced income, and sick leave, aggravat-
ing job burnout [171,172]. Burnout syndrome in health professionals is a consequence of
occupational risk factors and can negatively affect various job dimensions. Also, burnout
syndrome reduces physical health and productivity [173–175]. In contrast, protective
factors against burnout include supportive work environments, social support, healthy
lifestyles, and adequate coping mechanisms, which are crucial in mitigating burnout
levels [71,94,107,119–121,131]. Supportive leadership, adequate staffing, and good work–
family balance have also been identified as protective factors [60,136,176,177]. This com-
prehensive approach is supported by the work of Lee (2022), Peng et al. (2022), and Silva
et al. (2015), who found that resilience, communication competence, and social support
significantly reduce burnout levels [116,142,149]. These findings highlight the potential for
resilience-building interventions and organizational support structures to mitigate burnout
and promote staff well-being.

Research on burnout syndrome among health professionals has increased the impor-
tance of awareness about the mental health and well-being of this population. Based on
this, several countries, notably Sweden, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United
States, have implemented policies to address burnout among healthcare professionals by
improving workplace conditions, promoting peer mentoring, increasing mental health
resources, and implementing systemic reforms [163,178–180]. Health professionals must
pay more attention to burnout syndrome since it is associated with a higher risk of medical
errors [181,182].

The findings from this work have important clinical implications for healthcare pro-
fessionals. To promote healthcare professionals’ mental health and well-being, healthcare
organizations and policymakers must address the identified occupational risk factors.
Health professionals are at risk of burnout syndrome because of emotional pressure and
a stressful work environment. Interventions like enhanced workplace flexibility, staff
counseling services, resilience training, and peer-based support programs should be im-
plemented to help healthcare professionals cope with the emotional demands of their jobs
and provide them with emotional support and coping strategies. Other factors that con-
tribute to burnout syndrome are workplace bullying, effort–reward imbalance, and low job
satisfaction. Healthcare organizations must establish policies and mechanisms to prevent
workplace harassment and bullying like anonymous reporting lines, ombudspersons, and
leadership accountability systems. Healthcare professionals should be rewarded fairly
and appropriately for their efforts with performance-based rewards, career advancement
opportunities and enhanced wellness programs like family support services. There must
exist opportunities for them to develop professionally and achieve work–life balance like

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 1583

access to continuous education programs, research and innovation grants, and soft-skills
development initiatives.

Long working hours and job insecurity negatively impact burnout syndrome. To
mitigate these risk factors, healthcare organizations should optimize work schedules, im-
plement strategies to manage workload efficiently, and provide job security measures
including transparent job progression schemes, robust mentorship, streamlined commu-
nication, and task sharing and delegation systems. This study also addresses the psy-
chological dimension of burnout syndrome. As occupational risk factors can contribute
to depression, mental health support services should be integrated into healthcare set-
tings. Counselling, psychoeducation, and resilience-building programs should be provided
regularly to support mental health for healthcare professionals.

This study entails a comprehensive meta-analysis of occupational risk factors for burnout
syndrome. This research has limitations. Although most of the included studies used the
same scale to measure burnout syndrome, the difference between the scales is a source of het-
erogeneity in this study. This study’s results may have been influenced by the heterogeneity
in the results of most of the studies included in this study. There were insufficient studies
for each of the occupational and gender risk factors to analyze subgroups. Since most of the
studies in this research were cross-sectional, causal relationships cannot be drawn.

7. Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated a significant association be-
tween various occupational risk factors and burnout syndrome among health professionals.
Bullying at work, an imbalance between effort and reward, and low job satisfaction were
found to be the highest risk factors for burnout syndrome. Professionals should be made
aware of burnout syndrome, and policies should be implemented to examine their men-
tal health, specifically burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome should be prioritized in
health-related policies due to its potential consequences, including medical errors.
