Summary
Stigma may interfere with mental health service use. We
measured self-stigma and stigma-related cognitions (group
identification and perceived legitimacy of discrimination) at
baseline in 85 people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or
affective disorders. After 6 months, 75 (88%) had reported use
of mental health services. Controlling for baseline psycho-
pathology, perceived stigma and diagnosis, low perceived
legitimacy of discrimination predicted use of counselling/

psychotherapy. Strong group identification was associated with
participation in mutual-help groups. More self-stigma predicted
psychiatric hospitalisation. Cognitive indicators of stigma
resilience may predict out-patient service use, whereas self-
stigma may increase the risk of psychiatric hospitalisation.

Declaration of interest
None.

It has been claimed1 that stigma is a major barrier to mental health
service use and explains, among other factors such as accessibility
and quality of services, why many people choose not to participate
in treatment. However, empirical support for this assertion is scarce.2
We therefore examined the impact of self-stigma and stigma-related
cognitions on service use. In this context, perceived stigma refers to
the level of stigma people with mental illness observe in society (e.g.
‘The public thinks people with mental illness are stupid’); self-stigma
implies internalisation of public stigma, resulting in low self-esteem
(e.g. ‘I have a mental illness and therefore I am stupid’).

As baseline predictors of service use over 6 months, we
assessed self-stigma, the level of perceived stigma and two key
stigma-related cognitions that indicate resilience to stigma (low
perceived legitimacy of discrimination and strong identification with
the group of people with mental illness).3,4 Assuming that stigma
may affect the use of various services differently, we studied three
services: in addition to counselling/psychotherapy, we chose a more
empowering (mutual-help/peer-support groups run by consumers)
v. a more disempowering (psychiatric admission) service, and a
conservative design, controlling for baseline psychopathology.

Method

Eighty-five participants with mental illness were recruited from
centres offering out-patient mental health services in the Chicago
area.5 Of these, 75 (88%) completed the follow-up assessment
after 6 months, and 10 could not be contacted or were not willing
to participate. At follow-up, participants reported whether they
had used individual psychotherapy/counselling, mutual-help/
peer-support groups or psychiatric hospitalisation. Psychotherapy/
counselling was available in community clinics or day programmes
and was often limited in number depending on funding sources.
All participants gave written informed consent and the study
was approved by the institutional review boards of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and collaborating organisations. Mean
(s.d.) age of the 75 participants was 44.3 (9.8) years and 69% were
male; mean (s.d.) years of education was 13.6 (2.3). Over half (56%)
were African American and a third (35%) were White; a few
reported Hispanic/Latino (5%) or mixed/other (4%) ethnicities.
Axis I diagnoses were made using the Mini International Neuro-
Interview.6 Overall, 18 participants
psychiatric
(24%) had
schizophrenia, 21 (28%) had schizoaffective, 27 (36%) had

bipolar I or II, and 9 (12%) had recurrent unipolar major depressive
disorder. Also, 32 (43%) had comorbid current alcohol or substance
use disorder or dependence. On average, participants were first
diagnosed about 14.1 (s.d.=9.7) years ago and had been admitted
to psychiatric institutions about nine times (mean 8.8, s.d. = 13.5).
We measured self-stigma on the 10-item self-esteem decrement
subscale of the Self-Stigma of Mental Illness Scale7 (a = 0.88). The
level of stigma participants perceived in society was assessed using
the 12-item Perceived Devaluation–Discrimination Questionnaire8
(a = 0.85). Perceived legitimacy of discrimination is defined as
an individual’s perception that their ingroup’s lower status in
the social hierarchy is fair and legitimate. It was assessed with three
items adapted from Schmader et al9 (e.g. ‘Do you think it is justified
that people without a mental disorder have a higher status than
people with a mental disorder?’) (a = 0.82). Identification with
the group of people with mental illness was conceptualised by five
items adapted from Jetten et al10 (e.g. ‘I feel strong ties with the
group of people with mental illness’) (a = 0.85). General psycho-
the
pathology was assessed using a short 9-item version of
Symptom Check List–Revised11 (a = 0.82). For all scales, higher
scores represented higher levels of the measured constructs.

Results

For both psychotherapy/counselling
and mutual-help/peer-
support groups, we found a bimodal distribution: a large majority
of participants had either used the service continuously over 6
months or not at all. A small minority had used the service either
only once or for less than 6 months. For logistic regressions, we
categorised the use of each service as a dichotomous dependent
variable (using the service not at all/only once v. for 1–6 months).
Among 75 participants at follow-up, 52 (69%) had used individ-
ual counselling/psychotherapy, and 23 (31%) had used this service
once or not at all. Mutual-help/peer-support groups were used by
35 (47%), and 40 (53%) had used them only once or not at all.
Overall, 16 participants (21%) were admitted to psychiatric hospitals
over the follow-up period, whereas 59 (79%) were not.

Controlling for baseline levels of perceived stigma and psycho-
pathology, low perceived legitimacy of discrimination, but not
self-stigma or group identification, predicted use of counselling/
psychotherapy
(Table 1). Participation in mutual-help/peer-
support groups, on the other hand, was predicted by strong group

identification. High self-stigma at baseline predicted psychiatric hos-
pitalisation, independent of perceived stigma and psychopathology.
We then repeated the regression analyses to control for the
possible confound of diagnosis (schizophrenia/schizoaffective
disorder v. bipolar disorder/unipolar depression; and presence v.
absence of a current substance-related disorder as dummy-coded
variables). Diagnoses were not significant predictors in any of
the regressions (all P40.40), and all previously significant
predictors remained significant.

Discussion

We found evidence that self-stigma and stigma-related cognitions
predict service use among people with serious and chronic mental
illness, independent of baseline psychopathology, diagnosis and
the level of perceived stigma. Cognitions associated with resilience
to stigma (rejecting stigma as unfair; strong group identification)3,4
may facilitate use of out-patient services and be more relevant to
help-seeking than the level of perceived stigma per se. Increased
self-stigma, on the other hand, could be associated with reduced
willingness or ability to seek help, possibly leading to decreased
coping resources and thus to psychiatric hospitalisation as a last
resort. The time lag between baseline assessment of psychopatho-
logical symptoms and subsequent hospitalisation may explain the
lack of association between the two.

Limitations of our study should be considered. First, we did
not collect information on service use from sources other than
service users, and dichotomous dependent variables limited the
power of our analyses. Second, despite our longitudinal data, firm
conclusions on causality cannot be drawn because treatment
participation before baseline assessment may have influenced
stigma-related predictor variables. Third, our conclusions are
limited to people with serious and chronic mental illness who
already participate in mental health services. Finally, stigma-
related variables, accessibility, quality and use of services should
be investigated in different healthcare systems internationally.

Stigma-related factors appear to affect mental health service use.
High self-stigma could be a risk factor for psychiatric hospitalisation,
whereas strong group identification may encourage people with
mental illness to turn to peers for mutual help, thus increasing
empowerment. Research should investigate how initiatives
meant
to reduce self-stigma, public stigma and structural
discrimination can facilitate help-seeking.
