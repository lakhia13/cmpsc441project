Rating Scale for School-Age Children
With a Range of Linguistic and Social
Communication Skills

Purpose: Social communication or pragmatic skills are
continuously distributed in the general population. Impairment
in these skills is associated with two clinical disorders,
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and social (pragmatic)
communication disorder. Such impairment can impact a
child’s peer acceptance, school performance, and current
and later mental health. Valid, reliable, examiner-rated
observational measures of social communication from a
semistructured language sample are needed to detect
social communication impairment. We evaluated the
psychometrics of an examiner-rated measure of social
(pragmatic) communication, the Pragmatic Rating Scale–
School Age (PRS-SA).
Method: The analytic sample consisted of 130 children,
ages 7–12 years, from five mutually exclusive groups: ASD
(n = 25), language concern (LC; n = 5), ASD + LC (n = 10),
social communication impairment only (n = 22), and typically
developing (TD; n = 68). All children received language and
autism assessments. The PRS-SA was rated separately

using video-recorded communication samples from the
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Assessment
data were employed to evaluate the psychometrics of the
PRS-SA. Analysis of covariance models were used to
assess whether the PRS-SA would detect differences in
social communication functioning across the five groups.
Results: The PRS-SA demonstrated strong internal reliability,
concurrent validity, and interrater reliability. PRS-SA scores
were significantly higher in all groups compared to the
TD group and differed significantly in most pairwise
comparisons; the ASD + LC group had the highest (more
atypical) scores.
Conclusions: The PRS-SA shows promise as a measure of
social communication skills in school-age verbally fluent
children with a range of social and language abilities. More
research is needed with a larger sample, including a wider
age range and geographical diversity, to replicate findings.

S ocial (pragmatic) communication involves the use

of linguistic and nonlinguistic behaviors in socially
dynamic contexts to convey messages specifically

constructed to achieve a speaker’s intended purpose (Prutting,

traits that are rather normally distributed in the general
population (Constantino & Todd, 2003). Even mild varia-
tions from the norm in social communication skills may
result in significant functional impairment in forming and
sustaining peer relationships for youth with and without
autism spectrum disorder (ASD; Timler, 2018). Social com-
munication skills in school-age children are related to like-
ability (Place & Becker, 1991), emotional and behavioral
profiles (Helland & Helland, 2017), bullying, and mental
health in later life (Whitehouse et al., 2009). These diffi-
culties highlight the importance of detecting and treating
social communication impairment as soon as possible in
school-age children who may have missed earlier identifi-
cation (Whitehouse et al., 2009). One research-based mea-
sure of social (pragmatic) communication functioning, the

et al., 2019), may have promise for detecting social (prag-
matic) communication impairment but requires psychometric
assessment. This study examines psychometric properties
of the PRS-SA in a sample with diverse linguistic and so-
cial communication skills during middle childhood.

Social (pragmatic) communicative competence is a

complex interplay between social and cognitive knowledge,
ability to produce well-formulated linguistic utterances,
and successful tailoring of linguistic and nonlinguistic con-
tent and form to the social and linguistic context (Prutting,
1982). Pragmatics, which has its theoretical roots in phi-
losophy (Pierce, 1878) and linguistics (e.g., Grice, 1975),
refers to the rules that govern social use of language, in-
cluding discourse management (Grice, 1975), presupposi-
tion (Stalnaker, 1978), and speech acts (Austin, 1962;
Searle, 1969; Wittgenstein, 1958). It also encompasses as-
pects of linguistic (e.g., nonliteral language, multiple-meaning
words) and nonlinguistic (e.g., gesture, facial expression,
prosody) communication that impact the quality of social
communicative exchanges. All of these domains are repre-
sented in the PRS-SA.

Numerous studies have focused on identifying differ-
ences in social communication functioning in children with
developmental language disorder (DLD; S. L. Bishop et al.,
2017), social (pragmatic) communication disorder (SCD;
American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013), and ASD
(APA, 2013). DLD, not specified in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
(DSM-5; APA, 2013), is defined as impairment in one or
more of the following: phonology, morphology, syntax,
semantics, and pragmatics (S. L. Bishop et al., 2017).
Diagnostic criteria for SCD and ASD include impairment
in use of verbal and nonverbal communication, but only
ASD includes criteria for restricted and repetitive patterns
of behavior, interests, or activities (APA, 2013). All three
of these disorders are prevalent in the population. Lan-
guage disorders, as defined by the Children’s Communi-
cation Checklist–2 (CCC-2; D. V. Bishop, 2003), occur in
about 11% of 4- to 5-year-olds (Norbury et al., 2016). Al-
though prevalence studies of SCD per se are lacking, the
prevalence of pragmatic language impairment was 7.5%
in a community sample of nearly 1,400 kindergarteners
(Ketelaars et al., 2009). In individuals with language dis-
orders, prevalence rates of pragmatic impairment are higher,
ranging from 23% to 33% (Ketelaars et al., 2009). ASD af-
fects one in 54 children (Maenner et al., 2020). Given the
prevalence of pragmatic impairment (hereafter, social com-
munication impairment) across these disorders and the
impact of such impairment on short- and long-term func-
tioning, the importance of identification and treatment of
social communication impairment cannot be overstated.
In clinical practice, however, social communication skills
are rarely the first line of skills assessed (Timler, 2018). As
a consequence, social communication impairment may be
missed in children with or without language impairment
(Davies et al., 2016). Identifying social communication
impairment during childhood would afford access to ap-
propriate intervention, ultimately improving outcomes,

including school success, friendship building, psychoso-
cial well-being, and employability.

Clinical assessment of social communication behav-
ior must consider four domains (Roth & Spekman, 1984):
speech acts (communicative intentions such as greeting,
informing), discourse management (e.g., segues between
topics, turn length), presupposition (e.g., providing sufficient
information for the listener to infer meaning, tailoring the
formality to the relationship), and nonverbal communication-
related skills (e.g., gestures, eye contact, vocal tone). These
domains are integrated into the diagnostic criteria for SCD
and ASD, which are characterized by social communication
impairment (see Supplemental Material S1).

A variety of social communication assessment ap-

proaches and tools are available. The primary approaches
include informant report, formal direct assessment, and
structured observation (Norbury, 2014). A systematic re-
view of the literature identified nine social communication
measures (one interview, three direct assessments, five in-
formant report questionnaires) that are appropriate for
use with verbal school-age children (Yuan & Dollaghan,
2018). Of these measures, only one, the CCC-2, had at
least one item pertaining to each of the four domains iden-
tified in the DSM-5 as defining characteristics of SCD.
The CCC-2 is an informant (teacher, parent) report mea-
sure, considered a valid comprehensive communication
screener. To examine the relation between a child’s prag-
matic and structural language competencies, the CCC-2
provides for the calculation of a Social Interaction Devi-
ance Composite (SIDC). A negative score indicates that
social communication deficits exist above and beyond struc-
tural language deficits. While this is well conceived, Norbury
et al.’s (2004) large n study revealed that SIDC scores were
continuously distributed and did not distinguish children with
specific language impairment, SCD, or ASD. Another
widely used informant report measure is the Social Re-
sponsiveness Scale–Second Edition (SRS-2; Constantino
& Gruber, 2012). While the SRS-2 is designed to identify
the presence and severity of social impairment within
the autism spectrum, it reliably assesses social communica-
tion traits within the general population (Constantino &
Todd, 2003) and includes a subscale focusing on social
communication behavior (Constantino & Gruber, 2012).
In a study of SCD in first-degree relatives of an individual
with ASD and with language impairment, the SRS-2 Social
Communication Index (SCI) T score was comparable to
a formal direct assessment of social communication, the
Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language (CASL;
Carrow-Woolfolk, 1999; Nonliteral Language and Pragmatic
Judgment scales) in identifying SCD (Flax et al., 2019).

Informant report measures are of considerable value
in assessing social communication behavior in natural en-
vironments. Yet, several limitations exist. One pertains to
the quality of informant–child relationship. Even in parent–
child relationships with the highest rated quality, there are
increasing disagreements between parent report and child
self-report of child traits with increasing child age (Quitmann
et al., 2016). Furthermore, the reliability of parental report

of child characteristics may vary by parent socioeconomic
status, maternal education, and child behaviors (Moody
et al., 2017). In preschoolers with language delays, McCabe
and Marshall (2006) found only low to moderate correla-
tions between teacher and parent observations, suggesting
that, in children with developmental concerns, reliability
of reporting may be variable. Additionally, parents and even
self-reporters of social skills may not have the training to
identify specifics of the social communication errors that
are contributing to social difficulties. In ASD specifically,
there may be a difference between clinicians and parents
in the knowledge of skills and skill application expected in
typical conversational behavior occurring within dynamic
naturalistic communicative exchanges (Klin et al., 2005).
Additionally, accurate ratings of children’s social commu-
nication skills are challenging for lay raters, especially with
children with unclear diagnoses (Grzadzinski et al., 2016).
An alternative approach to measuring social com-
munication skills is through the use of formal direct as-
sessment tools (see reviews by Norbury, 2014; Timler &
Covey, 2021). Here, we mention only such assessment tools
that detected a difference in performance of children with
DLD, SCD, or ASD by more than 1 SD from the mean
of typically developing (TD) children (Timler & Covey,
2021). The best performing measure was the CASL-2
(Carrow-Woolfolk, 2017), normed for children ages 3 years
to 21 years 11 months. The CASL-2 has six subtests and
provides a Supralinguistic Index score. This measure focuses
on comprehension of idioms, nonliteral language, and double
meaning language; inferencing; and stating pragmatic lan-
guage rules for hypothetical situations. The CASL-2 detected
more than 1 SD from the TD mean for developmental
groups with DLD, SCD, and ASD. Other formal direct
assessment tools performed as follows in distinguishing the
abovementioned groups. The Clinical Evaluation of Language
Fundamentals–Fifth Edition (Wiig et al., 2013) and Social
Emotional Evaluation (Wiig, 2008) for ages 10 years to
12 years 11 months distinguished DLD and ASD groups
from a TD group. The Diagnostic Evaluation of Language
Variation–Norm Referenced (Seymour et al., 2005) distin-
guished TD and DLD groups. The Receptive, Expressive &
Social Communication Assessment–Elementary (Hamaguchi
& Ross-Swain, 2015) and Test of Integrated Language and
Literacy Skills (Nelson et al., 2016) differentiated only an
ASD group from a TD group. These measures differed in
the variety of social communication domains assessed
but mostly focused on nonliteral language and inferential
skills; none assessed discourse management skills.

Although formal direct assessments of social commu-

nication performance provide standardized stimuli that
specifically examine certain types of social communication–
related skills, they have inherent limitations due to the con-
textual dependency and dyadic nature of social communication
(Bacon et al., 2019; Norbury, 2014). In particular, such
assessments constrain the dynamic variation of events that
occur within dyadic exchanges where communicative part-
ners must apply their tacit knowledge of pragmatic rules to
generate appropriate social communication behavior (Volden

et al., 2009), thus limiting observation of a child’s discourse
management, presuppositional skills, diversity of illocu-
tionary acts, or nonlinguistic behaviors related to social
communication. Indeed, even children with ASD may not
score outside the normal range on a formal direct assess-
ment of social communication despite parent and teacher
reports of substantial challenges in social interaction and
peer relationships (Timler, 2014; Volden & Phillips, 2010).
The limitations of formal direct assessment tools may be
largely mitigated through semistructured (Prutting, 1982)
or structured observation (Norbury, 2014) where a more dy-
namic, conversational interaction provides the context for
assessing social communication behavior (Norbury, 2014;
Timler & Covey, 2021).

Observational approaches differ in the degree of gran-
ularity with which children’s social communication behavior
is documented. For example, the Analysis of Language Im-
paired Children’s Conversation (D. V. Bishop & Adams,
1989) employs a granular approach, providing a coding
schema for discourse participation, conversational domi-
nance, assertiveness, verbosity, responsiveness, and meshing
(appropriateness of responses). Another granular approach
was employed by Martin et al. (2018), using operationally
defined coding schema to identify frequency, duration, and
quality of communicative behavior in a conversational sam-
ple. A more rapid method, yielding less detailed informa-
tion, is to employ examiner-rated scales such as the Yale
In Vivo Pragmatic Protocol (Simmons et al., 2014), which
provides probes within a semistructured conversational ex-
change for discourse management, communicative function,
conversational repair, presupposition, and register. One lim-
itation of the Yale In Vivo Pragmatic Protocol is the lack
of evidence that it distinguishes children with social com-
munication impairment from TD children (Norbury, 2014).
A valid and reliable examiner-rated observational measure
is needed that can identify social communication impair-
ment. In this study, we examine the promise of the PRS-SA
for addressing this need.

The PRS-SA is an examiner-rated observational mea-
sure that offers a dimensional and developmental approach
to characterizing social communication skills of school-age
children and teens (adapted from an adult measure of social
communication; Landa et al., 1992) with or without known
developmental disability, including ASD (e.g., Klusek et al.,
2014). PRS-SA items align with the DSM-5 criteria for SCD
as shown in Supplemental Material S1 and are rated from
a semistructured social conversational sample between the
child and an examiner trained to reliability in rating the
PRS-SA items. Such conversation samples allow for obser-
vation and characterization of subtle components of social
interaction, such as discourse management, presuppositional
skills, and more. In a longitudinal study, the PRS-SA differ-
entiated 8- to 12-year-olds whose grouping (TD, social com-
munication delayed, ASD) had been defined at age of 3 years
(Greenslade et al., 2019) but psychometric data are lacking.
In the original PRS-SA (Greenslade et al., 2019), a

3-point scale was used to rate each item, requiring consid-
erable discernment to decipher the nuances distinguishing

Dillon et al.: PRS-SA Psychometrics 3479

ratings of 0, 1, or 2. While the 3-point scale generated a
continuous variable, a categorical-type rating was connoted,
where “0” represented generally appropriate social com-
munication behavior, “1” represented a slight variation
from the norm, and “2” represented a clear departure from
the norm. To align the rating system with the dimensional
nature of social communication, we replaced the 3-point
rating scale with a 7-point Likert scale and, for the first
time, examine the 7-point scale in this article. A 7-point
scale would permit rating of more subtle gradients in typi-
cality (or departures therefrom) than are afforded with a
3-point scale (Graham et al., 2012). Following the scale
model of Adamson et al. (2016), anchors are provided for
scores of 1, 4, and 7.

The main aim of this article is to evaluate the psycho-

metrics of the PRS-SA, revised for use of a 7-point scoring
system, in a middle childhood sample with diverse social
and language abilities. A secondary aim was to examine
whether this PRS-SA version differentiated overall social
communication functioning across groups operationally
defined by their social and linguistic functioning.

Method
Participants

The 130 participants (57.4% male), aged 7–12 years
(M = 9.31, SD = 1.60), were recruited from three partici-
pant pools: a prospective longitudinal study of children at
high or low familial risk for ASD, previously diagnosed with
ASD, and a cross-sectional sample of children recruited
from the community and from an outpatient clinical set-
ting. Twenty of these participants had been included in the
Greenslade et al. (2019) study. Inclusion criteria for this
study included being between ages 7 and 12 years, a na-
tive English speaker, having fluent speech (e.g., met cri-
teria for receiving Module 3 of the Autism Diagnostic
Observation Schedule [ADOS-G; Lord et al., 2000] or
ADOS-2; Lord et al., 2012), and having no missing data on
our two primary measures, Test of Language Develop-
ment (TOLD; Hammill & Newcomer, 2008; Newcomer
& Hammill, 2008) or ADOS (Lord et al., 2000, 2012).
Exclusionary criteria included birth weight of < 1,500 g,
severe birth trauma, head injury, prenatal illicit drug or
excessive alcohol exposure, and severe birth defects or a
known genetic disorder related to autism (e.g., fragile X
syndrome). Details about recruitment and proband ASD
diagnosis are described in (Greenslade et al., 2019). See
Table 1 for demographic information. Informed consent
and assent were obtained for all participants. This study
has been reviewed and approved by the institutional review
board.

Measures

ADOS

The ADOS (ADOS-G [Lord et al., 2000] and ADOS-2
[Lord et al., 2012]) is a semistructured, examiner-administered
assessment of autism-related behaviors. All participants in

the study received Module 3, intended for individuals with
fluent language. ASD classification is based on algorithm
scores across Social Affect and Restricted Repetitive Be-
haviors domains. Examiners administering the ADOS were
research reliable, were employed in an autism specialty
center, had at least 2 years of autism experience, and held
advanced degrees (master’s or doctoral degrees) in psychol-
ogy or speech-language pathology. ADOS data were used
by the examiner who performed the comprehensive assess-
ment as part of the process of determining clinical best
estimate (CBE) of ASD (see below) and for examining con-
current validity of the PRS-SA.

Our use of the ADOS to examine concurrent validity

of the PRS-SA was based on reports that the ADOS So-
cial Communication domain yields data relevant to social
(pragmatic) communication functioning. For example, Foley-
Nipcon et al. (2017) examined whether participants (ages
5.5–17.8 years) who met ASD diagnostic criteria when
using both the ADOS and Autism Diagnostic Interview–
Revised (Rutter et al., 2003), but not based on ADOS
Module 3 alone, would meet DSM-5 criteria for SCD.
Although the ADOS algorithm lacks an item addressing
the DSM-5 SCD A4 criterion, the percentages of such par-
ticipants meeting other SCD criteria were as follows: 89%
met Criterion A1, 89% met Criterion A2, and 100% met
Criterion A3 (Foley-Nipcon et al., 2017). Another research
group concluded that the ADOS Module 3 Social Com-
munication domain score provides a good representation
of adolescents’ (ages 8–12 years) social communication be-
havior based on its strong prediction of reciprocal social
communication behavior in peer-to-peer naturalistic inter-
actions (Qualls & Corbett, 2017).

For the concurrent validity analysis, we used the
ADOS Calibrated Severity Score Social Affect (CSS SA),
which provides comparability across ADOS modules and
the two versions of the ADOS (ADOS-G and ADOS-2). The
CSS SA ranges from 1 to 10; higher scores reflect greater
ASD symptom severity (Hus et al., 2014). Test–retest reli-
ability for the CSS SA for Module 3 is .782 (Choi, 2019).

TOLD

Participants received the primary (TOLD-P:4, ages
4–8.9 years; Newcomer & Hammill, 2008) or intermediate
(TOLD-I:4; ages 9–17.9 years; Hammill & Newcomer, 2008)
version as appropriate. Both versions are composed of six
subtests to measure: Sentence Imitation/Sentence Combin-
ing, Syntactic Understanding/Word Order, Morphological
Completion/Morphological Comprehension, Picture Vo-
cabulary, Relational Vocabulary, and Oral Vocabulary/
Multiple Meanings, which may be combined into a sum-
mary score, the Spoken Language Index (SLI). Both
TOLD versions generate the same composites, normed to
the same scale. Therefore, TOLD scores are comparable
across the full age range of the sample. Per the manual,
internal consistency is 71.4, test–retest reliability is 72.4,
and content validity is 57.1. The TOLD SLI score was
used to determine presence or absence of language concerns

(LCs) for purposes of grouping participants and to assess
concurrent validity.

SRS

The SRS and the SRS-2 (Constantino & Gruber, 2005,

2012; hereafter, SRS) are 65-item informant report mea-
sures of five domains of child behavior: Social Awareness,
Social Cognition, Social Communication, Social Motiva-
tion, and Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behavior. Higher
scores indicate greater degree of social impairment. The SRS
is normed for children aged 4–18 years and has been validated
for use with TD individuals, individuals with ASD, and
children having subclinical traits of autism and other devel-
opmental disorders. The SRS-2 has been used to identify
social communication impairments in individuals with di-
verse language abilities (ASD, SCD, and language impair-
ment). The SRS SCI T score and the CASL Nonliteral
Language and Pragmatic Judgment scales were compara-
ble in identifying social communication impairment (Flax
et al., 2019). A subsample of our participants had parent-
completed SRS/SRS-2 (n = 73, Mage = 109.67 months,
SD = 17.96) to assess convergent validity. We specifically
focused on the SCI T score given Flax et al.’s (2019) findings.

PRS-SA

The PRS-SA (Landa et al., 1992; Greenslade et al.,
2019) was designed to measure social (pragmatic) com-
munication skills in school-age children with at least phrase-
level expressive language. It consists of 23 primary items fo-
cused on specific social communication behaviors, along with
five summary items. The 23 primary items provide a means
of assessing speech acts (including social communicative in-
tents, such as greeting and sharing information, related to
the DSM-5 SCD Criterion A1), presupposition (includ-
ing inferencing; aligned with SCD Criteria A2 and A4),

discourse management (aligned with SCD Criterion A3),
and nonverbal communication (aligned with SCD Crite-
rion A4). To more adequately reflect the dimensional
nature of social communication, the PRS-SA rating sys-
tem was shifted from a 3- to a 7-point Likert-type scale
(1–7) for item-level scoring for this study. Scoring anchors
were set at 1 = no concerns, 4 = noticeable variation from
the norm but not clinically significant, and 7 = clinically sig-
nificant variation from the norm, significantly impeding ef-
fective communication. PRS-SA total score was calculated
by summing ratings for the 23 primary behaviors (possible
range of 23–161) where higher scores indicated greater so-
cial communication difficulties.

As in prior publications using the PRS-SA, ratings
were based on communication samples from the ADOS;
however, these ratings were made independently from ADOS
scoring. The PRS-SA items, their operational definitions, and
item-level rating schemes differ from those of the ADOS.
Use of the ADOS as a sampling method for observational
rating of social communication functioning has been en-
dorsed by social communication researchers (e.g., Norbury,
2014; Qualls & Corbett, 2017). Archived ADOS video re-
cordings were used to rate the PRS-SA. PRS-SA raters were
master’s or doctoral level psychologists trained to reliabil-
ity by first completing a didactic training on the PRS-SA
items with video examples (conducted by a speech-language
pathologist), completing consensus ratings with archived
video recordings of ADOS assessments, then achieving ≥

the comprehensive evaluation (and scored the ADOS) and
also rated the PRS-SA, a minimum of 2 months elapsed be-
tween events (range: 2 months to 11 years).

Social Communication Impairment Rating

Immediately after completing the PRS-SA, PRS-SA
raters evaluated presence/degree of social communication
impairment using a 3-point scale, where 0 indicated devel-
opmentally appropriate behavior, 1 indicated social communi-
cation difficulties but not clearly abnormal, and 2 indicated
clinically significant social communication impairment. Codes
of “0” and “1” were collapsed into a category of “no social
communication impairment.” A “2” served as the criterion
for classification as social communication impairment. This
rating did not contribute to the PRS-SA total score (described
above). Raters did not have access to the information needed
(e.g., age of onset of concerns about social communica-
tion impairment, medical records) to determine whether
children rated as a “2” met DSM-5 criteria for SCD.

Sample Groups Criteria

All participants completed a comprehensive assess-

ment, including the ADOS, language (TOLD), and cogni-
tive testing by a master’s or doctoral level psychologist or
speech-language pathologist who had attained research re-
liability on the ADOS and had at least 2 years of autism
diagnostic experience. Each child was assessed by a single
examiner. The PRS-SA was later rated using the commu-
nication sample from archived ADOS video recordings
completed as part of each participant’s comprehensive as-
sessment. Using data obtained from the comprehensive as-
sessment, along with the Social Communication rating that
was made by the PRS-SA rater, five groups were gener-
ated: ASD (n = 25), ASD + LC (n = 10), LC (n = 5), social
communication impairment only (SCIO; n = 22), or TD (n =
68). Criteria for the ASD group classification (n = 35) in-
cluded meeting the ADOS criteria for ASD or autism and
the DSM-IV or DSM-5 criteria for ASD and having a CBE
of ASD as determined by the examiner who administered
the ADOS as part of the comprehensive assessment. ASD
CBE considered the child’s ADOS, cognitive, developmen-
tal, and behavioral testing data. Criteria for LC included
scoring > 1 SD below the mean (< 85) on the TOLD SLI
(see Flax et al., 2019). Children meeting criteria for LC but
not meeting criteria for ASD (described above) were placed
in the LC group. Children with ASD who also met criteria
for LC were placed in the ASD + LC group. Criteria for the
SCIO group classification included receiving a rating of
social communication impairment by the rater of the PRS-SA
but not meeting criteria for ASD or LC. The TD group
classification required not meeting the above criteria for
ASD, LC, or social communication impairment and having
no other known developmental disorders.

Statistical Analysis

Our article proposes, first, to evaluate the psycho-
metrics of the PRS-SA. Internal consistency was examined

using Cronbach’s alpha and item–rest correlations. Con-
current validity was examined via a series of correlations
comparing PRS-SA total scores with other measures of
child social communication and language functioning. To
assess group differences, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
was employed to compare operationally defined groups
(see above) on total PRS-SA score, adjusting for child age
and sex.

PRS-SA Reliability

Four raters previously trained to reliability (> 80%

agreement with reliable ratings on four of five consecutive
training videos) rated the PRS-SA using the archived ADOS
communication samples. All raters had graduate degrees
(master’s or doctorate) in psychology and expertise in
autism and related disorders and were trained to ≥ 80%
reliability (as described above). For the current sample,
item-level interrater agreement on the 7-point scale was
achieved if raters’ scores were within 1 point of each other
(i.e., being 1 point above or below the “primary” rater’s
score for a given item; Adamson et al., 2016). A random
sample of 28 (21.5% of the sample) video recordings was
selected by an independent data manager for assessing
interrater reliability. Average weighted kappa of .831
(range: .4917–1.00) and average percent agreement of
96.36% (range: 88.96–100.00) were obtained. In two in-
stances, raters’ kappa coefficients fell below .50. In these
cases, the children exhibited low variability in item scores
(e.g., nearly all items had been scored 1). When there is a
limited range of item-level scores such as this, disagreement
between raters negatively impacts kappa despite nearly
perfect item-level agreement in scoring. Thus, percent agree-
ment on scores was also considered. Percent agreement
was always > 88%.

Comparison of 3- and 7-Point PRS-SA Versions

Twenty children (M = 10.17 years, SD = 2.66) from
the present sample had prior PRS-SA scores based on the
original 3-point scale (rated by previously trained and reli-
able raters who differed from raters who used the 7-point
scale) and were participants in the Greenslade et al. (2019)
study. Raters using the 7-point scale were blinded to PRS-SA
3-point scale ratings. Comparison of PRS-SA total scores
using the 7- and 3-point rating scales yielded Pearson cor-
relation of r = .871, p < .001, indicating a very strong rela-
tion between PRS-SA versions.

Internal Consistency

A measure of internal consistency and reliability was

conducted on the 23 primary PRS-SA items. Cronbach’s
alpha of .939 indicated a high level of interitem related-
ness. The alpha was not improved with the removal of any
item, so all items were retained in further analyses. Item–
rest correlations ranged from .37 to .76 (see Supplemental

3482 Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research (cid:129) Vol. 64 (cid:129) 3477–3488 (cid:129) September 2021

Material S2). This range is not surprising given the diver-
sity of skills that contribute to social (pragmatic) commu-
nication competence (e.g., linguistic, inferencing, nonverbal
communication, discourse management).

Concurrent Validity

To assess concurrent validity, a Pearson correlation
was conducted between children’s PRS-SA total score and
SRS SCI T score. The significant positive correlation (r =
.559, p < .001) indicates a moderate relation between social
communication skills as measured by the examiner-rated
PRS-SA and parent-rated child social communication skills
on the SRS.

As an additional measure of concurrent validity, a
Spearman rank-order correlation test was conducted using
children’s total PRS-SA score and ADOS CSS SA score
(r = .694, p < .001), indicating a moderate relation be-
tween the PRS-SA and a standardized measure of ASD
social communication symptoms.

The Pearson correlation test between PRS-SA total

score and the TOLD SLI identified a weak to medium sig-
nificant negative relation (r = −.398, p < .001). Higher TOLD
scores indicate higher levels of language performance,
whereas higher PRS-SA scores indicate more atypical social
(pragmatic) communication performance.

Group Analysis

ANCOVA by Language Level and ASD Status

Unadjusted scores for the PRS-SA (total score), TOLD
(SLI score), ADOS CSS SA, and SRS SCI T score are shown
in Table 2. An ANCOVA conducted to compare group’s
social communication (pragmatic) functioning, measured by
total PRS-SA score, covarying for chronological age and
child sex, was significant, F(4, 122) = 52.15, p < .001, ηp
2 =
.631. Given the small sample sizes of the two groups with
LC, this analysis was exploratory.

Bonferroni post hoc tests were conducted for group

comparisons (see Table 3). The TD group (M = 53.7, SD =
13.61) had significantly (p < .005) lower (less impairment)
PRS-SA scores than all other groups (means ranging from

76.7 to 100.8; see Table 2). The ASD group (M = 90.2,
SD = 14.5) differed significantly from the TD group only,
with greater scores on the PRS-SA, as expected (p < .001).
The SCIO group (M = 84.9, SD = 13.37) had significantly
higher scores than the TD group (p < .001), but significantly
lower PRS-SA scores than the ASD + LC group (M = 100.8,
SD = 13.5, p = .024). The LC group (M = 76.7, SD = 13.32)
had significantly higher scores than the TD group (p =
.012), but significantly lower scores than the ASD + LC
group (M = 100.8, SD = 13.5, p = .026). The ASD + LC
(M = 100.8, SD = 13.5) group had the highest level of
social communication impairment, as measured by the
PRS-SA, scoring significantly higher than the TD (p <
.001), LC (p = .026), and SCIO (p = .024) groups. A den-
sity plot of PRS-SA total scores, within each group, is shown
in Figure 1, with lines indicating the mean and standard
deviation of the PRS-SA for the TD group. Just under half
(two of five) of the LC group, 92% of the ASD group, 100%
of the ASD + LC group, and 86% of the SCIO group had
PRS-SA scores more than 1 SD above the TD mean.

Discussion

While variation in social communication skills is nat-

urally occurring in the general population, disruption in
social communication functioning can indicate a clinical
impairment, seen in ASD and SCD (APA, 2013). We evalu-
ated an examiner-rated observational tool, the PRS-SA, to
measure dimensions of social (pragmatic) communication
functioning in a sample of school-age children with a range
of linguistic and social communication functioning (includ-
ing children with and without ASD and children with and
without LCs based on standardized language assessments).
Interrater reliability for the scale was high, supporting us-
ability. The PRS-SA demonstrated strong internal consis-
tency as a unified scale. Evidence for concurrent validity
was obtained using other measures of social communica-
tion functioning (ADOS CSS SA and SRS SCI) and a
measure of structural language functioning (TOLD SLI).
As expected from the literature on social communication

(Ketelaars et al., 2009), there is some overlap of language
impairment and social communication impairment, but
not to a large degree, as indicated by the weak to medium
relation between a child’s overall language and social com-
munication skills (in a sample of verbally fluent children
and adolescents).

Results suggest promise for the viability of the PRS-SA

as a clinical measure of social communication. Indeed, with
the exception of the LC group, which consisted of only five
children, the distribution of PRS-SA scores for all other
clinical groups largely fell more than 1 SD above the TD
mean, indicating that the PRS-SA total score allows iden-
tification of children with social (pragmatic) communica-
tion impairments among a middle childhood sample with
a range of social communication and language function-
ing. Social communication impairment may exist indepen-
dently of ASD (APA, 2013) and independently of formal
linguistic impairment (Timler, 2018). Twenty-two (16.9%)
children in our sample had a social communication impair-
ment, without the presence of ASD or LC, suggesting they
may otherwise be overlooked for assessment and the possi-
ble benefits of a social intervention despite a measurable
ocial communication impairment, concerns that echo prior
discussions of social communication impairment (Norbury,
2014). The verbal fluency of these children may lead parents
and professionals to assume that development is on track,
resulting in low detection of social communication impair-
ment. Given the literature on risks associated with social
communication impairment throughout the life span, the
importance of identifying such impairment during the early
school years cannot be overstated. While our sample fo-
cused on middle childhood, the PRS-SA items are relevant
for verbally fluent children as young as 4 years of age, since
by that age children initiate and maintain topics, repair
communication breakdowns, adjust messages for context,
and so forth (Bauminger-Zviely & Shefer, 2021; Rollins,
1999). The PRS-SA permits a trained clinician to expedi-
tiously detect signs of social communication impairment in
an ecologically valid semistructured dyadic communicative
interaction.

There were few (n = 5) children in this study having
LC without meeting criteria for ASD. Two children with

LC scored more than 1 SD above the TD group’s PRS-SA
mean, suggesting these children also had pragmatic diffi-
culties. This is not surprising given the important role of
linguistic ability (e.g., vocabulary, syntax, and figurative
language skills) in producing finely tuned, topically con-
tingent utterances (Davies et al., 2016); gleaning the gist
of others’ discourse; producing sufficiently informative ut-
terances (Johnston et al., 1997); and using linguistic link-
ing devices to generate coherent discourse (e.g., Norbury,
2005). The percentage of children with LC scoring at least
one standardization above the TD mean on the PRS-SA
highlights the need for children to be assessed for social
communication impairment when even subtle social com-
munication differences are noted by parents or teachers,
especially when other language needs are present (Davies
et al., 2016; Timler, 2018).

Clinical Implications

Results of this study indicate that the PRS-SA has

promise for further investigation as an observational clini-
cal tool for assessing social communication and detecting
social communication impairment without requiring gran-
ular conversational or linguistic analysis. The moderate,
significant correlation with other measures of social commu-
nication, including a parent-rated (SRS) and an examiner-
rated measure of (ADOS) of social communication func-
tioning, supports the concurrent validity of the PRS-SA.
Additionally, that the PRS-SA is not redundant with these
other measures supports its contribution to the field. In-
deed, the ADOS-2 Module 3 has few items that assess prag-
matic aspects of social communication behavior (Yuan &
Dollaghan, 2018). When ASD is suspected, the PRS-SA is
not a substitute for a diagnostic assessment, which often in-
volves the administration of the ADOS-2.

The PRS-SA has added value to the field of speech-

language pathology and developmental disabilities. This
examiner-rated observational measure specifically focuses
on social (pragmatic) communication, is aligned with DSM-5
SCD criteria, and avoids the limitations of informant re-
port (having limitations related to reliability and accuracy)
and formal direct social communication measures (having

no to limited discourse management assessment). Routine
use of the PRS-SA as part of speech-language assessments
could permit detection of social communication impair-
ment and enable access to intervention during the wait for
further diagnostic workup. Through the observational pro-
cess (Adams & Bishop, 1989), the PRS-SA could be used
to document type and degree of variation from the norm
in social communication behaviors to guide selection of
social communication intervention targets. This is of value
since nonspecific social interventions are inadequate to
effectively promote children’s social growth (Yoder et al.,
2013).

The PRS-SA is intended for use by clinically certified

speech-language pathologists and licensed psychologists.
Training for the PRS-SA involves three components: (a) a
didactic component where the items and rating scale are
explicated using video exemplars, (b) explanation of key
strategies for conducting a semistructured interaction to
elicit a communication sample for rating the PRS-SA, and
(c) practice rating video-recorded examiner–child/youth
communication samples using the PRS-SA to support inter-
rater reliability attainment. When conducting semistructured
communication interactions, clinicians should establish a
standardized set of topics (e.g., vacations, favorite activities,

family traditions, mishaps, and adventures) and conversation-
starting materials focused on a range of themes (e.g., animals,
sports, and outer space) to examine topic initiation and
shifting skills, and conversational reciprocity. Preplanned
strategies/probes are useful for sampling all aspects of social
communication behavior related to SCD criteria in the
DSM-5, such as use of cliff-hangers (“I let my dog out one
day and he disappeared.”), requesting clarification, making
a few statements that require inferencing and humor, and
so forth. More information use of the PRS-SA may be ob-
tained by contacting the corresponding author.

Limitations

While this study shows promise of the utility of the

PRS-SA for detecting social communication impairment in
middle childhood, social communication behavior changes
with development and is affected by language level. There-
fore, more research is needed with a wider age span, from
diverse geographic regions and races, and larger samples
of children with diverse social and communication func-
tioning. Further research is also needed to assess the sta-
bility of social communication traits in children of various
ages. Such research likely will yield different cutoffs for

Dillon et al.: PRS-SA Psychometrics 3485

social communication impairment for different age groups
(Anagnostou et al., 2015). Relatedly, research on the PRS-SA
7-point scale is needed to assess sensitivity to intervention
response. Enrollment in the current study was dependent
on language level (e.g., meeting criteria for the ADOS
Module 3), rather than intellectual functioning. The liter-
ature provides evidence that language level, rather than in-
telligence scores, are related to social communication skills
(Constantino et al., 2003; De Marchena & Eigsti, 2016).
Future research will permit insights into the relation be-
tween cognitive functioning and social communication
functioning as assessed by the PRS-SA. In addition, future
work in a larger sample is needed to assess the factor struc-
ture of the PRS-SA; while PRS-SA items are designed to
measure social communication traits, subconstructs may
exist. While we present these findings as an important step
toward evaluating the clinical utility of the PRS-SA, we ac-
knowledge there are limitations to its clinical use in its cur-
rent form. For example, ratings are currently validated from
video-recorded ADOS samples, which are not always possi-
ble to obtain in school settings. Further work on the PRS-SA
for clinical use may address optimal methods of training to
promote interrater reliability.

Conclusions

Social communication skills have considerable impact
on children’s well-being across the life span. Currently, there
are limited observational examiner-rated tools for assessing
social communication impairment in a reliable and ecologi-
cally valid manner. Not surprisingly, children with and
without language impairments may be missed for social
communication impairments altogether (Davies et al.,
2016; Timler, 2018). The PRS-SA, an examiner-rated ob-
servational measure of social (pragmatic) communication
functioning, provides a total score that correctly identified
most cases of social communication impairment in a middle
childhood sample with diverse language and social abilities.
Use of the PRS-SA when concerns about communication
ability are first identified in school-age children could expe-
dite access to intervention during the often long wait for
diagnostic specialty assessments (e.g., ASD evaluations).
With more research, the viability and utility of the PRS-SA
as a clinical tool will be elucidated.
