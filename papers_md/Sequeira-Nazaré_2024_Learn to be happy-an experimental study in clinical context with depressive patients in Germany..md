Learn to be happy—an 
experimental study in clinical 
context with depressive patients 
in Germany

The increase in the number of people with mental disorders and the relapse rate 
of depressive patients give reason to constantly question and further develop 
psychotherapeutic interventions in order to stabilize therapy effects. Studies show 
that the art of living, described as the ability to lead a conscious and reflective life, 
can be learned and trained. The question arises as to what role the development 
of “art of living skills” have played in the treatment of depressed patients to date, 
and to what extent the targeted promotion of art of living within the framework 
of the therapy of depressed patients has an effect on the well-being and the level 
of depression that goes beyond this. The study is based on a mixed design. Study 
participants in the first experimental group (EG1, n  =  53) each received one session 
of 50  min psychotherapy per week for 4  weeks. The second experimental group 
(EG2, n  =  54) received psychotherapy equivalent to EG1 with additional life-skills 
reflection questions, which were to be answered every day and recorded in a 
diary. The control group (n  =  53) received neither therapy nor reflection questions. 
The art of living, degree of depression, and satisfaction with life were assessed 
before and after the 4-week therapy and in the follow-up after 3  months, and 
the effects were compared. There was a significant decrease in the depression 
score over the 4  weeks in both therapy groups. EG2 showed a greater decrease 
in depression over the 4  weeks. However, the difference did not persist over the 
3  months. Furthermore, in EG2 there was a significant increase in the Art of Living, 
Satisfaction with life, and Flourishing Scale over the 4  weeks, while in EG1 there 
was no change. However, the comparison in the follow-up after 3  months also 
shows that these effects could not stabilize. Overall, the results provide promising 
indications for integrating the art of living as a concept more strongly into the 
therapy of depressive patients. The question arises as to what long-term effects 
result from additional life skills stimulation and how the therapy effects gained 
can be stabilized over a longer period of time.

1 Introduction

In 2015, nearly one in four male and one in three female adults in Germany between the 
age of 18 and 79 suffered from a mental disorder (Gühne et al., 2015). Numerous studies prove 
the effectiveness as well as the long-term effect of psychotherapy with almost all medium to 
high effect sizes (Beutel et al., 2005; Ehrenthal, 2017; Franz et al., 2000; Huber et al., 2009). The 
relevance of psychotherapeutic support and research is increasing. Various effective factors 
can positively influence psychotherapy. These include, for example, a secure attachment style

of the patient as well as pursuing a profession, whereby the profession 
itself does not seem to have a significant influence (Herrmann and 
Huber,  2013).  There  are  also  contradictory  results  regarding  the 
duration of treatment (Borgart and Meermann, 1999) have found 
positive effects of treatment duration on treatment outcome, whereas 
other research, such as Fliege et al. (2002) and Franz et al. (2000) could 
not determine any influence of the treatment duration on the therapy 
success. One of the most important factors in psychotherapy is the 
patient-therapist relationship (Grawe, 1988). Herrmann and Huber 
(2013) investigated in a naturalistic study with 1,126 patients over 
2 years the effect factors of inpatient psychotherapy with the help of a 
symptom check list. The results clearly show that occupation, patient 
motivation and younger age have a positive influence on successful 
therapy. Inpatient psychotherapy usually involves a combination of 
different therapeutic measures. Psychodynamically or behaviorally 
oriented individual psychotherapy, group therapy, couple and family 
discussions, medical visits and creative procedures such as art therapy, 
music therapy and body therapy procedures (in individual and group 
settings) are combined (von Wietersheim et al., 2020). In a research of 
von Wietersheim et al. (2020) the effects of inpatient therapy were 
investigated on the basis of 577 patients. This showed that there was a 
significant reduction in depression scores between admission and 
discharge. Depressiveness at the 3-month catamnesis after discharge 
initially increased again somewhat, but fell back to the discharge value 
at the 12-month catamnesis.

Koen Demyttenaere reports that, from the patients’ point of view, 
a rapid restoration of a normal experience of positive emotions, such 
as enjoyment of life, motivation and interest, is more important than 
alleviating depressed mood (Abdol, 2017). The desire grows to support 
well-being and satisfaction with life (Seligman et al., 2006). In contrast, 
improvements in negative emotions and depressed mood are among 
the  most  important  goals  of  therapy  for  treating  physicians 
(Demyttenaere  et  al.,  2015).  The  importance  of  well-being  in  the 
context of mental disorders is supported by studies such as Wood et al. 
(2010) demonstrating that increased well-being reduces the risk of 
developing mental illness and has a symptom-relieving effect. Since 
the  loss  of  positive  emotions  cannot  be  measured  with  common 
depression  scales,  it  is  often  neglected  in  treatment  decisions. 
Therefore, it is important to pay attention to patient-centered therapy 
(Abdol, 2017). In a study of Kennedy et al. (2016), the effect of the 
drug agomelatine in depressed patients over a period of 6 months was 
shown. Compared to other antidepressants, this drug also influences 
anhedonia and thus the gain of joy of life. The results after treatment 
with agomelatine showed significant improvements for the domains 
work and social and family life (Stiefelhagen, 2017). Another study 
showed similar results, with depressed patients with severe anhedonia 
improving from an initial sum score of 93.1–19.8 after 12 weeks of 
therapy (Vinckier et al., 2017). According to Schmitz (2016), art of 
living  describes  a  good  way  of  dealing  with  the  self  as  well  as  a 
conscious,  self-determined  and  reflective  way  of 
living.  In 
psychotherapy it is worthwhile to deal with the art of living, because 
well-being  is  more  than  the  absence  of  illness  and  therefore  the 
treatment of depressive symptoms alone is not enough to be happy 
(Abdol, 2017). The components of the art of living include the self, the 
body, the soul, the environment and the mind. The latter includes the 
ability to reflect or self-reflect, which involves thinking about oneself, 
understanding one’s actions, examining them, evaluating them, and 
changing them if necessary (Christmann, 2003). From conclusions of 

self-reflection,  one  can  set  goals  for  the  future  that  fit  one’s  own 
abilities and competencies and through which one can change and 
develop.  Various  studies  indicate  that  the  ability  to  self-reflect  is 
related to increased well-being, and it is always crucial to generate 
alternative actions for the future (Lyubomirsky et al., 2011). Current 
studies  indicate  that  existing  treatment  approaches  have  not  yet 
succeeded  in  slowing  down  the  rapid  development  of  mentally  ill 
people  (Glied  and  Frank,  2009).  Initial  research  approaches  are 
yielding promising results for the application of positive interventions 
in clinical settings. For example, there is the application of so-called 
positive psychology interventions (PPI) (Sin and Lyubomirsky, 2009). 
These  are  exercises  on  topics  such  as  gratitude,  optimism,  or 
forgiveness. Moderators of the effect of depressive symptom relief with 
PPI are the current depressive status, the severity of the depressive 
episode, the age of the patient, and the format and duration of the 
interventions  (Bolier  et  al.,  2013).  The  assumptions  of  Positive 
Psychotherapy  (PPT)  are  built  on  the  fact  that  people  tend  to 
remember, notice, and expect negative aspects more than positive 
aspects,  which  gives  rise  to  negative  emotions.  This  tendency  is 
especially strong in depressed people. Because of this, exercises should 
be used to try to focus attention, memory and expectations on positive 
aspects (Seligman et al., 2006).

2 Methods

2.1 Study design and participants

The study is based on a two-factorial experimental mixed design, 
consisting  of  comparisons  between  three  groups  over  the  therapy 
period of 4 weeks and after 3 months, respectively. The experimental 
intervention, as an independent variable, was varied between groups. 
Study participants in the first experimental group (EG1) each received 
one session of 50 min per week of psychotherapy for 4 weeks. The 
second experimental group (EG2) received psychotherapy equivalent 
to EG1 and in addition life-skills reflection questions, which were to 
be answered every day and recorded in a diary. The control group 
(CG)  received  neither  therapy  nor  reflection  questions.  Exclusion 
criteria for all groups were being a minor and having a BDIV score 
below the cut-off score of 35. For the control group, all participants 
were required to not currently be in psychotherapeutic treatment. 
Group assignment was randomized. A total of 20 psychotherapists 
participated in the study as investigators, each treating patients from 
EG1 or EG2. In terms of repeated measures, art-of-living, level of 
depression, satisfaction with life, and flourishing were assessed before 
and  after  the  4 weeks  and  in  the  follow-up  after  3 months.  The 
questionnaires  used  were  the  Art-of-Living  Inventory  (AOL), 
Flourishing Scale (FS), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and Beck 
Depression Inventory V (BDI-V). With an effect size of ηp2 = 0.06 
(corresponds to an f of about.253) and a power of.8, a total of 156 
subjects was needed to determine a significant interaction effect with 
a mixed ANOVA with three groups and two measurements (α = 0.05). 
The sample of the two experimental groups consisted of voluntary 
patients  from  an  inpatient  psychiatric  clinic  and  from  different 
psychiatric  outpatient  clinics,  who  suffered  from  at  least  mild 
depression. The control group consisted of voluntary participants who 
were recruited via social media, among others, and who also suffered 
from at least mild depression (BDI ≥ 35). The total sample consisted

of 161 volunteer study participants, 58% female and 41% male. There 
was one gender-neutral person. In total, there were 53 individuals in 
EG1, 54 in EG2, and 53 in CG. The groups did not differ significantly 
in gender composition (EG1: 62% female; EG2: 67% female; CG: 47% 
female)  or  age  (EG1:  M = 44.17 years,  SD = 20.05 years;  EG2: 
M = 43.06 years, 
M = 40.98 years, 
SD = 20.05 years). In EG1, 62% had one or more pretreatments, in 
EG2, 61% and in CG 11%. In EG1, 47% of the study participants took 
medication,  in  EG2  50%  and  in  CG  0.04%.  The  youngest  study 
participant was 19 years old, and the oldest was 85 years old.

SD = 15.11 years;

2.2 Instruments

The  BDI  is  one  of  the  earliest  self-report  scales  for  recording 
depressive symptoms/screening depressive disorders. The Depression 
Questionnaire  (BDIV)  consists  of  a  total  of  20  items,  which  are 
measured using a five-point Likert scale (0 = never, 5 = almost always). 
Cronbach’s alpha is 0.95 (Schmitt et al., 2006).

The questionnaire on the art of living consists of a total of 11 
subscales with 35 items. It is the short form of a validated long-format 
questionnaire  consisting  of  131  items.  The  subscales  are  a  self-
determined  way  of  life,  self-knowledge,  enjoyment,  caring  for  the 
body,  positive  attitude  to  life,  reflection,  meaning,  serenity, 
optimization, coping, and social contacts. The items are measured 
using  a  six-point  Likert  scale  (1 = strongly  deviating,  6 = strongly 
agreeing). The Cronbach’s alpha for the full scale was 0.92 (Schmitz 
et al., 2022).

The  Flourishing  Scale  is  a  brief  eight-item  measure  of  the 
respondent’s self-perceived success in important areas of life such as 
relationships, self-esteem, purpose, and optimism. The scale provides 
a single psychological well-being score and can be used to provide 
useful feedback for how to improve one’s life and may stimulate self-
reflection.  The  items  are  measured  on  a  seven-point  Likert  scale 
(7 = strongly agree, 1 = strongly disagree). The test has a Cronbach’s 
alpha of 0.87 (Diener et al., 2010).

The  five-item  satisfaction  with  life  scale  is  used  to  measure 
satisfaction with life (Janke and Glöckner-Rist, 2012). According to 
Pavot et al. (1991), this is a multifactorial construct with affective and 
cognitive-evaluative  components.  The  affective  components  are 
characterized by the presence of positive and the absence of negative 
emotions. The cognitive-evaluative components consist of global and 
domain-specific  satisfaction  in  various  areas  of  life. The  items  are 
measured on a seven-point Likert scale (7 = strongly agree, 1 = strongly 
disagree) (Janke and Glöckner-Rist, 2012). Cronbach’s alpha is 0.85 
(van Beuningen, 2012).

way)? (3) What am I grateful for today? (4) Assuming I could relive 
the day, would I do something differently? If so, what would it be? 
Reflection on tomorrow: (5) Assuming I have all the power in the 
world tomorrow to do what I set out to do, what would it be? (6) How 
would I feel about it? and (7) How would people close to me notice 
that  I  was  doing  better?  Participants  of  EG2  had  to  answer  these 
questions every evening for a period of 4 weeks and write them down 
in a diary or similar.

2.4 Hypotheses

H1: The depression level of EG1 and EG2 decreases significantly in 
the before-after comparison over the 4 weeks, while the depression 
level in the control group remains stable.

H2: Art of living, sociopsychological well-being, and satisfaction 
with life increase significantly in EG1 and EG2 over the 4 weeks, 
while no changes are seen in the control group.

H3: Thereby, EG2 shows a significantly higher increase in life art, 
satisfaction with life and subjective psychological well-being over the 
4 weeks compared to EG1 and CG, as well as a significantly lower 
depression level.

H4: At the 3-month follow-up, depression and well-being scores of 
EG2 remain more stable than those of EG1.

2.5 Analysis

A one-factor ANOVA was first used to compare baseline scores. 
Across  the  three  groups,  the  groups  did  not  differ  significantly  in 
depression level F (2, 158) = 1.66, p = 0.194, while the group differences 
were  significantly  different  in  life  skill  variables  F  (2,  158) = 4.75, 
p = 0.010, Flourishing Scale F (2, 157) = 7.180, p = 0.001, and well-being 
F (2, 157), p = 0.003. In this regard, EG1 showed the lowest baseline 
scores at the descriptive level. To examine the extent to which variables 
changed within and between groups, multifactorial ANOVA were 
calculated  across  the  three  measurement  time  points,  with  group 
membership as the between-factor. Due to sphericity violation, the 
Greenhouse–Geisser  correction  is  reported.  Figure  1  shows  the 
changes in the groups in the variables collected. Because of differences 
in baseline values, post-hoc t-tests for independent samples were used 
to compare the difference values/effects between groups to answer the 

2.3 Procedures

Cognitive-behavioral  psychotherapy  in  an  individual  setting 
served as an intervention for EG1 and EG2. Contents of psychotherapy 
include psychoeducation, behavioral analysis, emotion management, 
and confrontation exercises (Härter et al., 2017). The EG2 was given 
additional reflection questions, which the experimenter had based on 
the book (Schmitz, 2016). These consisted of the following questions: 
Reflection on today: (1) What did I enjoy today (even if only in a very 
small way)? (2) What am I proud of today (even if only in a very small

hypotheses.  The  use  of  medication  (0 = no,  1 = yes)  and  previous 
psychotherapeutic treatment (0 = no, 1 = yes) as independent variables 
had no significant influence on the difference effects of the dependent 
variable at any time.

2.6 Correlations

Table 1 shows the correlations between the variables at time t0. As 
expected, the depression score measured by the BDI shows a negative 
correlation with satisfaction with life and life skill. In contrast, the 
Flourishing  scale  shows  almost  no  correlation  with  Depression. 
Furthermore,  depression  correlates  positively  with  the  number  of 
pretreatments and medication use.

3 Results

3.1 Hypothesis 1

The  descriptive  results  and  trajectories  are  shown  in  Figure  1. 
ANOVA across the three measurement time points with BDI score as 
the dependent variable proved significant in the main effect, F(1.49, 
232.33) = 32.56,  p ≤ 0.001,  np2 = 0.17.  As  seen  in  Figure  1,  both 
experimental  groups  record  a  drop.  Pairwise  comparison  of  mean 
differences within a group showed significant changes in EG1 and EG2 
over  4 weeks  (t0-t1),  EG1:  F(2,  155) = 12.84,  p = 0.023,  EG2:  F(2, 
155) = 51.27,  p < 0.001,  as  well  as  between  the  second  and  third 
measurement  (t1-t2),  EG1:  F(2,  155) = 12.84,  p < 0.001,  EG2:  F(2, 
155) = 51.  27, p < 0.001.  Comparing  the  changes  over  the  3 months 
(t0-t2),  these  also  proved  to  be  significant,  EG1:  F(2,  155) = 12.84, 
p < 0.001, EG2: F(2, 155) = 51.27, p < 0.001. Hypothesis 1, which states 
that the depression level in both therapy groups decreases significantly 
over the 4 weeks, can thus be confirmed. In the control group, however, 
there were no significant changes over the 4 weeks, F (2, 155) = 0.087, 
p = 0.686. Comparing the changes in the control group over 3 months, 
there were also no relevant effects F (2, 155) = 0.087, p = 0.836.

3.2 Hypothesis 2

Hypothesis  2  is  concerned  with  the  fact  that 

life  art, 
sociopsychological  well-being,  and  satisfaction  with  life  should 

increase significantly over the 4 weeks in EG1 and EG2. Art of Living: 
As seen in the graph of Figure 1, EG1 showed a slight decrease in life 
art  over  the  4 weeks,  while  EG2  showed  an  increase  in  life  art 
(Figure 2). In the analysis of variance, the main effect of repeated 
measures was found to be significant, F(1.11, 176.09) = 16.40, p < 0.001, 
np2 = 0.09.  The  increase  in  art  of  living  in  EG2  was  found  to 
be significant over the 4 weeks, F(2, 157) = 49. 76, p < 0.001. In contrast, 
the changes in EG1 F(2, 157) = 10. 41, p = 0.465 as well as in CG F(2, 
157) = 0.787,  p = 0.299  proved  not  to  be  significant.  Flourishing: 
ANOVA  revealed  the  main  effect  to  be  significant,  F(1.39, 
212.03) = 10.00,  p < 0.001,  np2 = 0.06  (Figure  3).  Over  the  4 weeks, 
neither EG1 showed significant F(2, 152) = 11.05, p = 0.171 nor the 
control group F(2, 152) = 0.078, p = 0.925. In contrast, the increase in 
EG2 proved to be significant F(2, 152) = 14.11, p < 0.001. Satisfaction 
with life: On the other hand, the ANOVA with satisfaction with life as 
dependent variable proved to be significant, F(1.55, 242.22) = 9.05, 
p ≤ 0.001, np2 = 0.06. The changes in satisfaction with life showed in 
EG1 F(2, 155) = 9. 707, p = 0.828 as well as in the CG F(2, 155) = 0.007, 
p = 0.924 also showed to be non-significant, while they were significant 
in EG2, F(2, 155) = 14.91, p < 0.001. In this regard, hypothesis 2 can 
be confirmed for the changes in art of living, Flourishing Scale, and 
satisfaction with life for EG2. In contrast, the normal therapy group 
(EG1) did not show significant improvements in any of the variables.

3.3 Hypothesis 3

To  compare  the  change  effects  between  groups,  Hypothesis  3 
predicts that EC 2 should have a significantly greater increase in life 
skills, sociopsychological well-being, and satisfaction with life over the 
4 weeks, as well as a significantly greater decrease in depression levels. 
Depression: The interaction effect measurement*repeat group of the 
main analysis proved significant, F (2.98, 232.33) = 9.65, p ≤ 0.001, 
np2 = 0.11  (Figure  4).  Tested  by  comparing  difference  scores,  the 
decline in EG2 proved significantly greater than in EG1 t(104) = 6. 12, 
p < 0.001, d = 1.21. However, both experimental groups differed from 
the  CG,  EG1,  t(157) = 4.02,  p < 0.001,  d = 0.63,  EG2,  t(104) = 5.50, 
p < 0.001,  d = 1.1.  Life  skill:  The  interaction  effect  measurement 
repetition*group  also  proved  significant  with  art  of  living  as  the 
dependent variable F(2.23, 176.09) = 5.7, p = 0.003, np2 = 0.07. Only in 
EG2 was there a descriptive increase in art of living, while art of living 
in  EG1.  This  difference  also  proved  significant 
decreased 
t(106) = −7.20,  p < 0.001,  d = 1.22.  The  art  of  living  increase  also

differed significantly from the CG results, t(105) = −7.42, p < 0.001, 
d = 1.16,  while  art  of  living  decreased  equally  in  EG1  and  CG, 
t(105) = −0.251,  p = 0.401,  d = −0.06.  Flourishing:  The  interaction 
between group and measurement time points proved to be significant 
F(2.77, 212.03) = 5.28, p = 0.002, np2 = 0.07. Both experimental groups 
recorded an increase in Flourishing scale, but the increase in EG2 over 
the 4 weeks proved to be significantly higher, t(102) = −2. 81, p = 0.003, 
d = 0.55.  While  EG2  also  differed  from  the  CG  over  the  4 weeks 
t(101) = 4.20, p < 0.001, d = 0.72, there were no significant differences 
between  the  CG  and  EG1,  t(105) = −  1.217,  p = 0.113,  d = 0.14. 
Satisfaction  with  life:  For  satisfaction  with  life,  there  was  also  an 
interaction  between  group  membership  and  repeated  measures, 
F(3.12, 242.22) = 5.34, p < 0.001, np2 = 0.06. Figure 1 graphically shows 
a strong increase in EG2 in satisfaction with life, which also proved to 
be statistically greater than in EG1, t(106) = −3. 17, p < 0.001, d = 0.61, 
as well as significantly larger compared to the CG, t(104) = −3.45, 
p < 0.001, d = 0.67. In contrast, the changes in EG1 did not differ from 
those in the control group, t(104) = −0.253, p = 0.400, d = 0.049. Thus, 
the results support the assumptions of hypothesis 3 in all variables. 

EG2 exhibits a significantly greater decrease in depression over the 
4 weeks.  While  EG1  does  not  differ  significantly  from  CG  in  the 
Positive Psychology variables, the effects of EG2 differ significantly 
from the other two groups.

3.4 Hypothesis 4

Hypothesis 4 assumes that the depression and well-being scores 
of  EG2  will  be  more  stable  than  those  of  EG2  at  follow-up  after 
3 months. The extent to which within-group effects change at 3 months 
follow-up was tested first, and then the change effects between groups 
were compared. Depression: The BDI showed a significant decrease 
within  both  experimental  groups  after  the  4 weeks,  EG1,  F(2, 
155) = 12.838, p < 0.001, EG2, F(2, 155) = 51.126, p = 0.049. However, 
the decrease in depression did not differ between the experimental 
groups between t1 and t2, t(104) = −1.12, p = 0.268, d = 0.22, nor did it 
differ across the comparison over 3 months t0 vs. t2, t(106) = 1.43, 
p = 0.156,  d = 0.28.  Both  experimental  groups  showed  overall 
significant results over the 3 months, compared to the control group, 
EG1,  t(159) = 4.73, p < 0.001, d = 0.84,  EG2, t(105) = 5.48, p < 0.001, 
d = 1.06. Satisfaction with life: In satisfaction with life, EG2 showed a 
significant  decrease  in  effects  at  follow-up  after  3 months,  F(2, 
155) = 14.91, p = 0.005, so that EG2 did not show a significant gain in 
satisfaction  with  life  in  the  comparison  between  t0  and  t2,  F(2, 
155) = 14.91, p = 0.585. EG1 showed a sharp decrease in satisfaction 
with life over the course, so that the patients had significantly lower 
satisfaction with life after the 3 months than at t0 F(2, 155) = 9.707, 
p ≤ 0.001.  The  comparison  of  the  mean  differences  of  t0  and  t2 
between  the  experimental  groups  proved  to  be  significant 
t(105) = −2.53,  p = 0.013,  d = 0.36,  so  that  EG2  could  record  a 
significant satisfaction with life gain compared to EG1. Changes in 
EG1 and EG2 over the 3 months were not different from changes in 
the  control  group,  EG1,  t(157) = 1.12,  p = 0.265,  d = 0.21,  EG2, 
t(103) = −0.49, p = 0.622, d = 0.65. Art of Living: In the art of living, 
EG2 also showed a significant decrease in effects at follow-up. F(2, 
157) = 49.76, p < 0.001, showing no significant differences in life skills 
when comparing t3 and t0, F(2, 157) = 49.76, p = 0.574. Descriptively, 
it even shows that EG2 have a lower life skill level after 3 months. In 
EG1, there is no increase in life skill at all, but there is a sharp drop in 
follow-up, which also proved significant, F(2, 157) = 10.412, p < 0.001. 
Here, the drop in life skill after the 4 weeks is not significantly different 
between the experimental groups, t(106) = −0.57, p = 0.570, d = 0.11, 
however, EG1 shows a significantly higher drop when compared to t0, 
t(106) = −2.4,  p = 0.019,  d = 0.45.  Comparing  the  changes  with  the 
control group over the 3 months, none of the experimental groups 
show significant differences from the control group, EG1, t(159) = 1.43, 
p = 0.154, d = 0.28, EG2, t(105) = −0.16, p = 0.873, d = 0.03. Flourishing: 
In EG2, the gained effects decrease significantly again after 3 months, 
F(2,  152) = 14.11,  p = 0.017,  as  well  as  in  EG1  F(2,  152) = 11.05, 
p < 0.001. Comparing t0 and t3, there is a strong significant decrease 
in  EG1  below  the  baseline  level  of  t0,  F(2,  152) = 11.05,  p < 0.001. 
Overall, the changes over the 3 months, t0-t3, are not different in EG1 
and EG2, t(104) = −1.25, p = 0.106, d = 0.25. In fact, both experimental 
groups  show  a  greater  decrease  in  the  flourishing  scale  over  the 
3 months  than  the  control  group,  EG1,  t(105) = 1.301,  p = 0.098, 
d = 0.233, EG2, t(103) = 0.304, p = 0.001, d = 0.59. Hypothesis 4 cannot 
be confirmed with respect to depression. Both groups show a further

decline at follow-up and do not differ significantly in the magnitude 
of the decline. Despite the decrease in effects after 4 weeks, EG2 could 
show a significantly higher satisfaction with life increase than EG1. 
Also, in the art of living, EG1 shows a significantly greater decline over 
the 3 months, so hypothesis 4 can be confirmed in terms of art of 
living and in terms of satisfaction with life.

4 Discussion

The results first show that in both therapy groups the depression 
level was significantly reduced over the 4 weeks, while the control 
group  remained  relatively  stable  over  all  three  measurement  time 
points,  as  expected.  Overall,  the  scores  of  all  dependent  variables 
(depression, art of living, flourishing as well as satisfaction with life) 
of EG2 were worse than those of EG1 before therapy, while at follow 
up EG2 is above EG1 in all variables. After 3 months, depressive scores 
continue to improve in both experimental groups, with EG1 showing 
a  higher  decline  at  the  descriptive  level.  In  comparison,  the 
improvement of EG2 flattens more after therapy. One reason for the 
higher therapy effects in EG2 could be the art of living intervention. 
This seems to lead to a stronger improvement of the depressive values 
during the therapy. It is possible that the improvement flattens out 
after the end of therapy, since no more intervention takes place, or that 
an extension of the intervention duration, e.g., 3 months instead of 
4 weeks, might be more effective. The question arises whether the 
progress curves of EG1 and EG2 converge during longer observation 
or how they change further. In a study of Leichsenring et al. (2008), 
depressive patients were examined before therapy, after the end of 
therapy and after 1 year with regard to their depressive scores. The 
results showed that the majority of the subjects showed the greatest 
effect increase after 1 year compared to the end of therapy. For future 
studies, it is important to compare the therapy effects over a longer 
period of time in order to classify the effects in the long-term course.
In the art of living, EG1 shows a slight decrease after 4 weeks and 
a sudden decrease after 3 months. The reason for this could be the 
focus of the treating psychotherapists and physicians on symptom 
reduction  (decrease  of  depression)  instead  of  the  restoration  of 
positive  emotions/joy  of  life  (Demyttenaere  et  al.,  2015).  In 
comparison, one sees a strong increase in art of living in EG2. Thus, 
dealing with questions that stimulate the art of living, embedded in a 
therapy,  could  actually  increase  the  art  of  living.  After  3 months, 
however, there is also an extreme drop in the art of living, which is 
even just below the initial value. The reason for this could be a short-
term deterioration in well-being, which is often found in patients after 
the end of therapy (Brakemeier et al., 2018). Some patients in the 
study reported after 3 months that the therapy had stirred up a lot in 
the aftermath and had thus led to a short-term worsening of symptoms 
and  subjective  well-being.  They  also  reported  that  the  therapist 
withdrawal  and  being  on  their  own  again  had  led  to  temporary 
worsening. However, most reported an improvement after overcoming 
the negative phase and after the “sore points” had been processed. 
Here, too, it would be interesting to observe the further course of 
events over a longer period of time.

In the positive variables of art of living, flourishing and satisfaction 
with life, EG1 shows no relevant improvements after 4 weeks and a 
sharp drop in follow-up after 3 months. This could be attributed to the 
focus of symptom reduction in depressed patients (Abdol, 2017). In 

comparison,  EG2  showed  a  significant  improvement  in  the  art  of 
living and satisfaction with life and flourishing after 4 weeks. Some 
patients reported that the questions stimulating the art of living were 
very  difficult  to  answer  at  the  beginning  and  were  initially  only 
answered  superficially,  with  effects  only  becoming  apparent  after 
prolonged  use.  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  the  art  of  living  itself  is  a 
learning  process  that  basically  takes  more  time.  It  is  possible  that 
patients need a subsequent therapy intervention that focuses on the 
training of the art of living in order to stabilize the effects.

This study has limitations. On the one hand, recruiting the test 
subjects was very difficult, since many patients were so stressed that 
it  was  an  additional  burden  for  them  to  have  to  fill  out  more 
questionnaires. Furthermore, there was a very high dropout rate, so 
that many only filled out the first questionnaire and were therefore 
not qualified for the study. The study was carried out in a paper pencil 
design  because  there  were  many  older  patients  who  would 
be overwhelmed with online questionnaires. As a result, however, 
there  was  massive  paperwork  and  the  patients  often  had  to 
be reminded to keep to the other measurement times. Because many 
different therapists took part in the study, it was possible to ensure 
objectivity with regard to the experimenter, but it was not possible to 
check exactly whether the respective therapists carried out the test 
procedure in a similar way or followed the regulations.

Overall, the present study provides a versatile impetus for further 
interventions and research to increasingly integrate the concept of art 
of living into psychotherapeutic work. Obviously, the art of living 
plays an important role in people’s well-being and can help depressive 
patients to increase their satisfaction with life during and after therapy. 
Furthermore, it would be interesting for future studies to extend the 
art of living interventions and change the questions or the art of the 
intervention like a video based intervention for example. Also it is 
possible  to  test  the  intervention  on  various  disorders  apart  from 
depression or to apply them in different therapeutic settings, e.g., in 
the context of a group therapy of depressive patients.
