Abstract: One of the greatest challenges in the domain of emotional regulation is comprehending
the functionality of strategies and their utilization in various social contexts. In this sense, this study
analyzes differences in the use and efﬁcacy of regulation strategies, particularly of interpersonal
strategies like altruism, social support, negotiation, mediation, regulation, and rituals, in samples
of workers (N = 687) and students (N = 959) from Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Spain, and Uruguay, and
athletes (N =144) from Spain. Participants answered questions pertaining to measures of affect
or emotional regulation (MARS and ERQ self-regulation scales and EROS heteroregulation), as
well as questions of a wellbeing scale (PHI) and questions related to emotional creativity (ECI),
humor styles (HSQ), and adjustment to stress. Athletes reported less emotional discharge, use
of humor, and affection, and greater confrontation and use of rituals than students and workers.
A congruent relationship was found between the use of functional strategies (like direct coping,
distraction, reevaluation, and active physiological regulation) and adjustment to stress, well-being,
and creativity. Seeking social support, negotiation, and, to an extent, altruism, conﬁrmed their
predicted adaptive character. Mediation and delegation did not conﬁrm their predicted adaptive
character. Rumination, social comparison, rituals, confrontation, and suppression were maladaptive
for workers and students, but the ﬁrst four strategies were functional for athletes, who display a
higher self-control and a more team-oriented and competitive emotional culture. Finally, the results
show that adaptive regulation strategies mediate the relationship between well-being and adjustment
to stress.

Affect is deﬁned as the subjective experience of the general emotional state, which can
be positive/pleasant or negative/unpleasant [1]. Emotional episodes typically result in a
mixture of emotions, while also reinforcing, creating, or relying on mood states [2]. Emo-
tions shape individuals’ subjectivity through the process of symbolic interaction between
identity, norms, and social values [3], and inﬂuence the behaviors that can be observed
in different social contexts. Despite emotions being conceived by researchers from very
different perspectives, there appear to be some key similarities among experts [4]. First,
emotions involve moderately related changes in domains such as subjective experience,

behavior, and physiological aspects. Second, they develop over time [5]. In this sense, the
Process Model of Emotion Regulation proposed by [4] provides a framework for under-
standing how emotions are generated and regulated, and how different components of
emotional responses interact with each other. According to this model, the sequence begins
with the appraisal of a psychologically relevant situation. The appraisal process determines
whether the situation is perceived as positive or negative, and whether it is relevant to
the individual.

Whether of one kind or another, these situations are e evaluated in terms of what
they mean to the individual based on their goals [6]. Finally, the model suggests that
emotions are important because of their relationship with prominent social beliefs [7] and
ethical decisions [8,9]. Current research concludes that emotions and cognitive processes
mutually inﬂuence each other and are co-determined by sociocultural processes [10–12]. In
this sense, there is an important consensus that emotions are not just individual, internal
experiences but are shaped by cultural norms, social contexts, and historical and political
circumstances [13].

2. Affective Regulation

Emotional regulation is a process considered necessary for optimal personal and
social adaptation [14]. Individuals who possess well-developed emotional competencies
to regulate their affectivity report having more positive relationships with others, exhibit
fewer antisocial behaviors, and are less prone to psychological disorders compared to those
who exhibit lower levels or lack such competencies [15]. While affect regulation refers to
the modiﬁcation of moods, emotional regulation refers to individuals’ capacity to modify
components of their emotional experience.

According to the Process Model of Emotion Regulation in [4], emotional regulation be-
gins when a person chooses between possible situations based on their probable emotional
impact. The model suggests that once an emotion is generated, it can be regulated through
various cognitive and behavioral strategies which modify the appraisal, physiological
arousal, and expression components of the emotional response. These strategies include
the following: (1) the modiﬁcation of the situation, which involves altering the situation to
modify its emotional impact; (2) attentional deployment, which involves focusing attention
on one aspect of the situation; (3) cognitive change, which involves modifying the meaning
attributed to the situation, according to which the potential emotional meanings would lead
to a new decision, resulting in the experience, behaviors, and physiological response ten-
dencies that deﬁne the emotion; and, ﬁnally, (4) modulation of affective response refers to
directly inﬂuencing the experience, behavior, or physiological components of the emotional
response after the emotion has been generated.

2.1. Goals of Affect Regulation

Regulation is considered functional if adaptive goals are achieved [16]. Different
motivations or goals for emotional regulation are important. First, arousal regulation
(which increases when people are bored or decreases when they are upset) and, second,
hedonic regulation, usually related to a decreased negative affect and improved positive
affect, are two basic goals related to affect valence and activation. Third, instrumental
or problem solution goals or task-related (or achievement outcomes) goals are important.
Fourth, goals of social integration or goals with belonging-oriented outcomes are relevant
in general and especially in the workplace. Other goals or motives are important, like
maintaining a positive self-image and defending self-esteem and cognitive motives, or
understanding emotions and affect [17,18]. Brieﬂy, affect regulation can be characterized by
the inclination to improve feelings and arousal, solve tasks successfully, defend self-esteem,
and understand and control experience, as well as to maintain or improve social integration.

2.2. Relational and Social Regulation Forms

Forms of regulation are important for all goals, but also particularly for social integra-
tion goals, which are those that are carried out through interactions with others. Here, not
only the search for social support, widely studied, but also forms of regulation that involve
mobilizing changes in social relationships can be integrated, like altruism, negotiation,
mediation, delegation, and public rituals.

As forms of regulation based on social relationships, seeking and giving social support,
as well as negotiation, have been studied. In particular, prosocial behavior or altruism
that increases well-being [19]. Negotiation is aimed at making a deal and proposing
a compromise with others, in order to reduce stress. Previous studies have identiﬁed
negotiation and altruism as frequently chosen regulation strategies that are associated with
adjustment [20].

Mediation and delegation are forms of regulation also linked to the use of social
relationships. Mediation seeks the intervention of third parties as intermediaries, while
delegation involves vicarious and indirect control through ﬁgures of higher status and
expertise, in which the instrumental resolution of the situation is delegated (e.g., to a
doctor, a teacher, or a more knowledgeable colleague). Mediation and delegation as indirect
forms of changing the situation through social relationships were more effective than direct
coping in situations with limited controllability [21]. However, the involvement of third
parties as mediators and delegation were rarely used in previous samples, and the latter
was not adaptive in the workplace [20].

Private and public rituals, as well as participation in social movements or social
participation, constitute forms of regulation that involve the use of social instruments. Both
private and public rituals have been associated with well-being in coping with collective
stressful events [22]. In the work environment, it was identiﬁed the use of collective or
public rituals as a regulation strategy [23] and there is evidence of their positive effects
in other areas [18,24]. Finally, participation in social movements, although it is a less
frequent form of coping, and is only applicable in situations of collective problems, can be
an adaptive way for the regulation of stress [25].

3. The Use of Humor as an Effective Regulation Strategy

Another form of regulation that relates to social relationships is the use of humor.
Styles of humour refer to how a person interacts with others using fun in interpersonal
communications [26]. Humor mitigates negative affect, and together with the expression of
affection o, constitutes a way of regulating feelings. Humor would aid in regulation through
physiological reactions, producing relief through the production of endorphins, similarly to
what occurs during physical activity [27]. Studies have shown that the activation of opposite
emotions that inﬂuences the use of affection and humor directly helps to increase positive
emotions and reduce negative ones [28]. Furthermore, humor can help to reinterpret
and react to stressors in a more positive way, reducing their impact and symptoms of
anxiety [27]. Research has also shown that humor reinforces adaptive regulation forms such
as reevaluation or de-dramatization and the search for social support through afﬁliative
humor [20]. Finally, there is a positive association between sense of humor, assertiveness,
and creativity [28].

4. Emotional Regulation and Creativity

As mentioned earlier, positive forms of regulation such as humor are associated
with creativity.
In general, creativity can be deﬁned as the ability to generate novel,
original, infrequent, and useful or adaptive responses to a problem or situation. In the
affective domain, creativity facilitates adaptive regulation. A personality trait linked to
this topic is called emotional creativity (EC). It is the ability to attend to and experience
complex emotions—rare or novel ones—in an authentic and adaptive way [29,30]. EC has
been associated with well-being and correlated with a higher adjustment after an intense
emotional experience. It has also been shown in university students to be a predictor

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6865

of intrinsic motivation and academic commitment [31]. This trait is related to divergent
thinking, the ability to be creative and original in emotional experiences, and emotional
regulation, speciﬁcally reinforcing adaptive reappraisal. Finally, motional creativity is
linked to creative performance [32].

In addition to this personality trait, forms of regulation such as humor, active physio-
logical regulation, regulated emotional expression, gratitude and self-reward, thankfulness,
and reappraisal facilitate creativity. The use of humor involves distancing, creative and
positive reformulation of events. Probably through affective and cognitive pathways, it
strengthens creativity or the generation of innovative responses [26]. Active physiological
regulation, which involves some kind of physical activity, increases positive affect and,
through it, creativity [33]. Regulated emotional expression increases creativity, probably
because it is related to greater abilities to analyze and delay the response, which allows
overcoming habitual responses [34]. Self-reward and thankfulness are associated with
creativity because they involve the interpretation of reality in an innovative way, where the
search for alternative positive stimuli helps to elaborate creative responses. Reappraisal as
distancing and changing perspective also reinforces creativity [35].

5. Wellbeing and Emotional Regulation

Research has shown that people who use more functional regulation strategies experi-
ence high psychological well-being [4,36]. Therefore, well-being measures are also impor-
tant to verify the functionality of emotional regulation strategies in different situations [37].
Speciﬁcally, some studies have focused on studying the relationship between regulation
strategies and psychological or eudaimonic well-being (which refers to the extent to which
individuals perceive their lives to be meaningful, purposeful, and fulﬁlling), while others
have also related them to measures of hedonic well-being (which refers to the subjective
experience of pleasure, happiness, and life satisfaction) [38].

For example, in a study conducted by [39] with 470 adults, positive reappraisal and
refocusing on planning were positively correlated with subjective and psychological well-
being. Additionally, rumination, catastrophizing, and self-blame were linked to poorer
well-being. In another study low suppression, low self-critical use of humor, and afﬁliative
humor were linked to higher levels of psychological well-being. Similarly, self-enhancing
humor and low suppression were associated with higher levels of happiness [40].

More recently, a study conducted by [18] analyzed different strategies of emotional
regulation [4] and its association with hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. The results
showed that maladaptive coping strategies, such as withdrawal and social isolation, and
suppression were associated with higher levels of negative affect or low hedonic well being.
Conversely, coping strategies such as social support, gratitude and self-reward, reappraisal,
as well as venting and regulated expression were found to be signiﬁcantly associated
with higher levels of positive affect. Similar results were found in the relationship of
strategies with psychological well-being. Speciﬁcally, suppression, social isolation and
withdrawal were associated with low psychological well-being., At the opposite, strategies
such as problem-directed action and planning, attentional deployment through distraction,
seeking social support, cognitive change by reappraisal, response modulation by active
physiological regulation, as well as venting and regulated expression, acceptance and
gratitude/self-reward, have been found to be positively correlated with psychological well-
being. However, as observed in previous studies, the functionality of emotional regulation
strategies and their relationship with well-being varies depending on the situations and
interactions that occur with others [37]. Therefore, it is essential to conduct more studies that
allow us to verify the functionality of emotional regulation strategies and their relationship
with well-being in different contexts.

6. Present Study

Based on the reviewed literature, the objectives and hypotheses of this study are
presented [31]. The shared objective was to compare how students, workers and ath-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6865

5 of 24

letes regulated emotions in the common domain of achievement or performance. In the
presentation of the instruments, it was emphasized that we were asking how people man-
aged emotions in the non-interpersonal and non-family environment, but in the area of
performance or achievement, i.e., studies, work, and competitive sports.

Hypothesis 1 (H1). Differences in the frequency and effectiveness of strategy use are expected to
be found between students, workers and athletes.

The relationship between forms of affect regulation with adaptive goals of emotional
regulation and well-being adjustment, health-related quality of life perception, humor,
emotional creativity, and creativity or innovation in responses given to face a conﬂicting
work situation will be contrasted. It is expected to ﬁnd a congruent relationship between
the use of functional strategies and the analyzed variables.

Hypothesis 2 (H2). Speciﬁcally, adaptive regulation is expected to be associated with stress adjust-
ment, well-being and health related quality of life, as well as with trait creativity and innovation—the
creativity trait is expected to be associated with creative performance in the form of innovative solu-
tion to a work conﬂict.

The specific effect of self and hetero-regulation strategies on adjustment will be examined,

with well-being as a distal predictor and the strategies themselves as mediating variables.

Hypothesis 3 (H3). Adaptive regulation strategies will mediate between adjustment and well-being;
with a direct relationship between both variables in students (see also [18]).

7. Method
7.1. Procedure and Participants

Students and athletes data was collected by paper and pencil scales. For the study with
employees, part of questionnaires were collected face-to-face and part online. Response
time of the scales was 30 to 40 min. For data collected by encrypted mail link response
rate was 30%. For face to face data response rate was close to 100% because they were
controlled samples.

For the study with employees (E1), participants were recruited by doctoral students
and professors of organizational psychology. Part of the questionnaires were collected
face-to-face and part online. An encrypted email was sent to the participants who accessed
a link to answer the survey. They could only reply once to the link that was sent to them—it
was not a free access link. This study includes N = 687 individuals (workers, undergraduate
and graduate students who work) from four countries: Brazil, Chile, Spain, and Uruguay,
participated in this study. Of those who reported working (29%), 47% worked full-time
and 53% worked part-time. Participants reported being professionals from different oc-
cupational ﬁelds (tourism, computer science, health care, teaching, administrative, civil
servants, mechanics, HR and commerce technicians). 57% of the sample reported being
female and 43% male, aged between 17 and 72 years (M = 30.77, SD = 10.87).

For the student’s study (E2), self-report paper and pencil scales were applied of
line or face to face collectively, after requesting informed consent, in a single session by
the researcher’s authors to young volunteers studying human sciences and education in
different Spanish speaking institutions, who answered individually by self-applying the
questionnaire. Participants were Spanish and Latin-American university students. The
study included 959 students from Chile, Cuba, Spain, and Uruguay, who reported having
completed high school or higher education [bachelor’s degree (64%), diploma (3%), degree
(22%), and master’s degree (1%)]. 72% reported being female and 28% male, aged between
16 and 46 years (M = 20.67, SD = 2.87). In this study, the validation of the MARS scale was
based on a ﬁrst sample of students (see [18]).

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6865

For the study with athletes (E3), the self-report paper and pencil instruments were
administered collectively, after requesting informed consent from the athletes who par-
ticipated voluntarily. The participants were asked to answer the questionnaires thinking
about the collective sport they most frequently practiced and in which they participated
in competitions. N = 144 Spanish individuals who engaged in sports as a professional
activity (athletics, cycling, football, rowing, rugby, surﬁng, basketball, others) participated
in this study, 78% were men and 22% were women, aged between 17 and 43 years (M = 22,
SD = 4.42). The validation of the MARS scale in sports was used in this study (see [24,37])
The inclusion criterion for all samples was to be of legal age and not to have cognitive
limitations. The researchers who sent the links or collected the questionnaires checked the
age and cognitive competence of each participant—who was personally known in each
case. The three studies were developed in parallel during the 2015–2016 academic years as
part of a research project on emotional regulation.

In this study, the validation of the MARS scale was based on a first sample of students (see [18]). For the study with athletes (E3), the self-report paper and pencil instruments were administered collectively, after requesting informed consent from the athletes who par-ticipated voluntarily. The participants were asked to answer the questionnaires thinking about the collective sport they most frequently practiced and in which they participated in competitions. N = 144 Spanish individuals who engaged in sports as a professional ac-tivity (athletics, cycling, football, rowing, rugby, surfing, basketball, others) participated in this study, 78% were men and 22% were women, aged between 17 and 43 years (M = 22, SD = 4.42). The validation of the MARS scale in sports was used in this study (see [24]; [37]) The inclusion criterion for all samples was to be of legal age and not to have cognitive limitations. The researchers who sent the links or collected the questionnaires checked the age and cognitive competence of each participant—who was personally known in each case. The three studies were developed in parallel during the 2015–2016 academic years as part of a research project on emotional regulation. 7.2. Instruments The following figure and table presents the variables and scales applied in the studies (see Figure 1 and Table 1).  Figure 1. Study model: dispositional variables (psychological well-being and health-related quality of life and trait emotional creativity), mediating variables (regulation) and criterion variables (ad-justment to stress and applied creativity or innovation as a solution to a labor conflict).

Fourth, styles of humor scales (HSQ) was applied only in study 2.  The study design sought to examine the relationship of affective regulation to stress adapta-tion and well-being, as well as the relationship of affective regulation to trait and perfor-mance creativity.

study 2. The study design sought to examine the relationship of affective regulation to
stress adaptation and well-being, as well as the relationship of affective regulation to trait
and performance creativity.

In this research, instruments related to affective regulation were used. In this section,
as a measure of affect regulation, the MARS scale [41,42] was responded to. A version
consisting of 64 items was applied (see Tables 2–5). Participants were asked to indicate
how often they performed the actions mentioned to regulate/manage stress situations in
the study, work, or sports context. The response scale was a Likert-type scale (0 = never to
6 = almost always). However, in the athlete’s studies, items of Altruism, Mediation, Nego-
tiation, Delegation, Social participation, Search for information and Passive physiological
regulation were not included—because they were not relevant for this domain.

Participants also answered the perception of adjustment in the mentioned episodes [17,40].
Here, the perceived functionality of the emotional regulation strategies was measured
through six items that asked to what extent the following goals had been achieved when
coping with stressful episodes at work: (1) decrease the intensity with which this emotional
experience was lived, i.e., to change from high emotional experience, i.e., to change from
high activation to calmness, relaxation calm, relaxation; (2) decrease displeasure, discomfort
or unpleasantness, i.e., change from displeasure to greater pleasure; (3) understand the
emotional experience of the situation; (4) to control or solve the problem associated with
the situation, i.e., to change to greater control over the situation; (5) to manage relationships
with other people, to change them for the better, to have a better relation (6) to improve
one’s self-image. Responses were given on a Likert-type scale (1 = little or no change
to 10 = change to a great extent). The reliability of the scale in the studies was highly
satisfactory (α = 0.95 × 101; α = 0.84 × 102; α = 0.90 × 103).

Other scales answered in this section by workers and student’s samples included the
Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) [43]. This scale assess individual differences
in two emotion regulation strategies: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression.
The scale consists of 10 items [e.g., when I want to feel more pleasant emotions, I change
what I am thinking] and is responded to on a Likert scale (1 = completely disagree and
7 = completely agree). The reliabilities were found to be acceptable in the studies in which
it was used (α = 0.74 and 0.69 × 101; α = 0.77 and 0.78 × 102).

Participants in the students and athlete’s samples answer the emotional inter-regulation
EROS instrument [44]. This scale of nine items evaluates individual differences in the regu-
lation of others’ emotions (or hetero regulation). A ﬁrst dimension composed of six items
evaluates the tendency to increase others’ positive emotions and decrease their negative
emotions [e.g., I did something pleasant or rewarding with others]. A second dimension

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6865

10 of 24

of three items evaluates the tendency to increase others’ negative emotions [e.g., I talked
to someone about their mistakes and limitations]. It is responded to on a Likert scale
(1 = completely disagree and 5 = completely agree). The reliability in improving and wors-
ening emotions was partially adequate in both studies (α = 0.76 and 0.61 × 102; α = 0.75
and 0.89 × 103).

Another section included in all studies consisted of measuring well-being and health-
related quality of life. General, eudaimonic, hedonic, and social well-being were mea-
sured using the Pemberton Happiness Index (PHI) [45]. This instrument, which contains
11 items [e.g., “I feel very satisﬁed with my life”], is responded to on a Likert-type scale
(0 = completely disagree and 10 = completely agree). The reliability was very adequate
in all three samples (α = 0.87 × 101; α = 0.87 × 102; α = 0.91 × 103). Health-related
quality of life was measured using the SF-36 health survey in the study 1 [46]. This instru-
ment is also responded to on a Likert-type scale. It includes a general health dimension
that asks about physical health (1 = excellent to 5 = poor; from 1 = completely true to
5 = completely false), a mental health dimension that asks about anxiety and depression
(1 = completely true to 6 = completely false), and a vitality dimension that asks about en-
ergy and fatigue (1 = always to 6 = never), in all cases during the last month. The reliability
in this study [E2] was satisfactory (α = 0.75 for general health, 0.82 for mental health, and
0.82 for vitality).

In the study 2 humor styles were also measured using the Humor Styles Questionnaire
(HSQ) [26]. This instrument consists of 32 items and four dimensions: afﬁliative humor
(α = 0.40 if item 29 is eliminated), self-enhancing humor (α = 0.68), aggressive humor
(α = 0.61 if item 23 is eliminated), and self-defeating humor (α = 0.70). Each dimension
contains 8 items. It is responded to using a Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree to
7 = strongly agree).

The study 1 measured emotional creativity as a trait and its indicators of creativity and
innovation in the ideation phase. Emotional creativity as a trait was measured using the
Spanish version of the Emotional Creativity Inventory (ECI-S) [30], which is composed of
17 items grouped into three dimensions: emotional preparedness or disposition (e.g., when
I have strong emotional reactions, I seek the reasons for my feelings); novelty or ability
to experience new or unusual emotions (e.g., I have felt a combination of emotions that
probably other people have never experienced), and effectiveness/authenticity (e.g., the
way I express and experience my emotions helps me in my reactions with other people).
Participants responded using a Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree). The
reliability of this study was very satisfactory (α = 0.83, E1).

Participants in the study 1 were then presented with a case of a workplace conﬂict [32]
and were asked to: (1) write about how they would feel in that situation, (2) how they
would regulate their emotions and those of others in this case, (3) what they would include
in a written proposal to the company’s management as solutions for improvement, and
(4) what other actions they would take—independently of the written proposal—to resolve
the workplace conﬂict. Using the CAT method [47], independent judges evaluated each
participant’s ﬂuency or number of ideas. They also evaluated the originality, effectiveness,
and authenticity versus conventional or socially desirable responses using a Likert scale
(5 = high, 1 = low). The correlations between the judges’ scores were signiﬁcant with
r(63) = 0.65 for effectiveness, r = 0.70 for originality, and r = 0.68 for authenticity [E1].

7.3. Data Analysis

All the scales used have been translated and validated in Spain and Latin America,
showing reliability and structural validity [32,48]. They are also formulated in standard
international Spanish. In addition, cross-cultural value studies such as the World value
survey show the existence of a shared Catholic European and Latin American cultural
value domain [49]. This justiﬁes in our opinion to carry out a general analysis. Relia-
bility analyses were carried out for each scale per sample. Means comparison between
samples of the use of regulatory strategies was carried out to contrast the exploratory H1.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6865

11 of 24

Analysis comparing how students, workers and athletes regulated emotions using only
Spaniards samples shows similar results to general ones. Means of regulation strategies
were compared between samples to explore differences between work, study and sport
contexts. Subsequently, regulation strategies were correlated with stress adjustment and
psychological well-being. Correlations between strategies with the variables of adjustment
to stress and well-being in all samples allows us to examine H2. In more exploratory
analysis, we examine the relationship of affect regulation with creativity in solving a work
conﬂict. In the sample of workers, trait creativity and creativity of work conﬂict resolu-
tion were correlated with regulation strategies. In the student sample, the relationship
between humor styles and regulation and criterion variables is examined. For a probability
of a Type I error of α = 0.05 and a probability of a Type II error (1 − β) of 0.80, and for
a typical effect size in social psychology of r = 0.21 [50] or of r = 0.24 [51] the required
sample size for correlation analysis is N = 176 and N = 134 respectively [52] so that our
samples meets the statistical power requirement. Finally, the mediational role of strate-
gies between psychological well-being and stress adjustment is carried out to examine H3.
A mediational analysis using Process was carried out in the student’s sample. For stu-
dent large sample basic multiple regression analysis prerequisites (homoscedasticity...)
were meet. Psychological well-being as global evaluation of person disposition is ar-
guable the cause (X variable) of strategies of coping (M or mediation variables) as well a
cause of adjustment to stress in the achievement domain (Y or effect or dependent vari-
able). Moreover, PWB correlated with both coping strategies and adjustment, and coping
with adjustment—meeting four steps that establish mediation X-M-Y are all correlated
(see Kenny https://davidakenny.net/cm/mediate.htm, accessed on 23 October 2022) [53].
However, recall that Hayes states that these correlations need not be signiﬁcant in order to
apply a mediational analysis. In our case, we only included variables that were signiﬁcantly
correlated in any case. Program was Hayes’s Process. Effect size estimation for mediation
was carried out as suggested by a reviewer with Kenny and another computer software.
Using Kenny MedPower https://davidakenny.shinyapps.io/MedPower/, accessed on
23 October 2022, a sample of 250 is required for power 0.80 or higher in the direct and
indirect coefﬁcients of a mediational analysis (for an estimated effect size 0.20). For a
probability of a Type I error of α = 0.05 and a probability of a Type II error (1—β) of 0.80,
and for a mediation coefﬁcient of r = 0.20, and supposing 10 covariables, a sample of
N = 276 is required—using https://xuqin.shinyapps.io/CausalMediationPowerAnalysis/,
accessed on 23 October 2022. So our sample meets the assumptions and statistical power
requirement for mediational analysis.

8. Results
8.1. Frequency and Effectiveness of the Use of Regulation Strategies for Each Analyzed Context

The results showed the frequency and effectiveness of affect regulation strategies
used in different domains. Figure 2 displays the affect strategy families that demonstrated
reliability levels above 0.65 in at least one of the three samples.

The strategies that have been found in previous studies to be dysfunctional or non-
adaptive (e.g., abandonment and suppression) show lower means than adaptive ones
(Figure 1 and Tables 2–5), demonstrating that people tend to report a functional proﬁle of
emotion regulation.

8.2. Modiﬁcation of the Situation and Social Relationships

This facet includes approach versus avoidance of social situations and relationships
(Tables 2 and 3). Analysis of variance examines exploratory H1. Athletes (E3) followed by
students (E2) use more instrumental coping and seeking instrumental and informational
support than workers (E1). Effect sizes were small, differences between groups explaining
between 1 and 2% of variance. In turn, student’s use more emotional support seeking
strategies than workers. In addition, students followed by worker’s report using talking
to someone who could give me advice and guidance more than athletes. The family of

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6865

behavioural disengagement and social isolation is used little as a strategy, differences
between groups are very small (Table 2). Regarding the other families or strategies of
social bonds (Table 3) there are no major differences in altruism and mediation. However,
students use more negotiation. The greatest difference between workers, students, and
athletes appears to be in the use of private and public rituals—group differences explain
27 and 6% of variance.

Figure 2. Facets and regulation families of Measure of Affect Regulation Styles, (MARS).

8.3. Attentional Deployment and Cognitive Change

By respect to Attentional Deployment and cognitive change (Table 4) athletes use
this facet more intensely than the other two groups. Speciﬁcally, the sample of students
alternating with athletes in some items versus workers are the ones who use distraction
the most- 12% and 19% of variance was explained. For example, while students seek to
do something entertaining, something that I really like and enjoy, athletes use thinking
about something else to distract myself from my feelings. Athletes, followed by workers,
show more use of the gratitude and self-reward strategy than students, except in doing
something special to reward and feel better, this strategy is more used by the last group.
Explained variance was 8.6%, 5% and 2,4% for items 28, 30 and 31 respectively. Athletes,
followed by workers, more than students, report using spiritual activities and reappraisal
as a form of regulation—but only in one item and explaining 1.8% of variance in the last
case. Athletes report performing more social comparison and students less, with workers
located between both groups in the use of this family of regulation—explained variance
was 2.5% and 9.2%.

8.4. Experience Modiﬁcation and Regulation of Emotional Response

Regarding experience modiﬁcation and regulation of emotional response (see Table 5)
workers report using the inhibition/suppression dimension mostly, followed by students
and workers using discharge- explained variance was low, around 1%. Compared to the
other two groups, athletes use this regulation strategy less. Regarding active physiological
regulation, it is athletes who report using this family of regulation the most, and students
who use it the least. Worker scores are in an intermediate position. Regarding passive phys-
iological regulation, workers mention using it more frequently than students—explained
variance was important around 5%. Finally, athletes—followed by students—report greater
use of confrontation as a regulation strategy than workers—explained variance was of
6.7% and 1.2%.

Analysis of variance examines exploratory H1. Athletes (E3) followed by students (E2) use more instrumental coping and seeking instrumental and informational support than workers (E1). Effect sizes were small, differences between groups explaining between 1 and 2% of variance. In turn, student’s use more emotional support seeking strategies than workers.

The greatest difference between workers, students, and ath-letes appears to be in the use of private and public rituals—group differences explain 27 and 6% of variance. 8.3.

8.5. Relationship between Adaptive Emotional Regulation, Well-Being, and Stress Adjustment

Correlation was carried out between strategies and adjustment to stress and wellbeing
to examine H2. Positive associations were found for functional strategies and negative
associations for dysfunctional strategies (italicized) as expected (Table 6). Of the forms of
social regulation that are based on mobilizing social relationship, in addition to seeking
social support, negotiation is shown to be adaptive in this study, as it is linked to both
adjustment and well-being in workers and students, and to a lesser extent, altruism,
which is associated with adjustment in both groups but not well-being. Participation is
associated with adjustment and well-being in students, while in workers it is negatively
associated with both. Rituals are adaptive in athletes but not in students and are negatively
associated with well-being in workers. Finally, mediation and delegation do not conﬁrm
their supposed adaptive character, and the latter is even negatively associated with well-
being in samples of workers and students.

The distraction strategy is positively associated with both adjustment and well-being
in students and athletes; acceptance is positively associated with adjustment in athletes and
with well-being in both groups. These are attentional reorientation and cognitive change
strategies, that are partially adaptive in this study. Rumination and social comparison are
non-adaptive strategies in students and workers, although they are positively associated
with adjustment and well-being in athletes (see Table 7).

to regulate emotional response is adaptive in workers and students. In turn, regulated
emotional expression is adaptive with adjustment in all three groups and with well-being
in students and athletes. Confrontation partially conﬁrms its negative association with
well-being, although this does not occur with discharge, which, contrary to expectations,
is associated with well-being in students. The results obtained conﬁrm part of the second

Finally, heteroregulation by improvement of emotions of others measured by
EROS-enhancement was related to adjustment and wellbeing, but only in one sample:
students: r = 0.21, p = 0.01, and athlete’s r = 0.03 n/s for adjustment; and students: r = 0.24,
p = 0.01, and athlete’s r = −0.07 n/s for well-being. Surprisingly, heteroregulation by
increasing others’ negative emotions was also related to adjustment and wellbeing in the
students sample—EROSnegative correlated in students r = 0.10, p = 0.05, and athlete’s
r = 0.04 n/s for adjustment; and students: r = 0.11, p = 0.05, and athlete’s r = 0.12 n/s for
well-being.

8.6. The Relationship between Adaptive Regulation Strategies, Humor Styles, Creativity, and
Innovation

Regarding humor styles, self-enhancing humor, showed stronger functionality as
expected, being associated with well-being—and reappraisal, although also with discharge.
The aggressive humor dimension, which is assumed dysfunctional, is effectively associated
with poorly adaptive strategies such as confrontation, delegation, passive physiological
regulation, and discharge. However, questioning the idea that aggressive humor is dys-
functional, in this study, it is associated with adaptive strategies such as seeking support,
distraction, self-reward, reappraisal, and altruism. Self-defeating humor was linked to
non-adaptive regulation strategies such as suppression, passive physiological regulation,
delegation, and confrontation. However, despite being non-adaptive, this humor style
was associated with reappraisal, active physiological regulation, and altruism, which are
positive regulation strategies (see Table 9).

Supporting the scale’s validity, there is an association between emotional creativity
(ECI-S scale) and creativity in response to a work conﬂict (E1). In turn, emotional creativity
as a trait is positively and signiﬁcantly associated with adjustment and strategies linked
to high well-being (direct coping, social support, re-evaluation, spirituality, information
seeking, active physiological regulation, regulated emotional expression), as well as with ac-
ceptance, social participation, and rituals. It is also positively associated with non-adaptive
strategies such as rumination, social comparison, and discharge, and negatively associated
with suppression. In this study, creativity, or innovation in the ideation phase as a response
to a work conﬂict is positively and signiﬁcantly associated with re-evaluation, active physi-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6865

ological regulation, and information seeking. It is negatively associated with suppression.
Finally, functional forms of regulation (direct coping, negotiation, reevaluation, active
physiological regulation) are positively and dysfunctional (abandon, rumination, passive
physiological, suppression) are negatively v associated to health-related quality of life in
workers (SF-36 scale).

8.7. Effect of Self-Regulation Strategies as Mediator Variables with Well-Being and Adjustment

To examine H3 mediational analyses [54] were performed with the sample of students,
using well-being as predictor, adjustment as the dependent variable (DV), and regulation
strategies by area as mediator variables (MV). Well-being and regulation strategies explain
28% of the variance in adjustment. Well-being is positively and indirectly associated with
adjustment through direct coping B = 0.023, SD = 0.0052, 95% CI [0.014; 0.035] and lower
psychological abandonment B = 0.023, SD = 0.0073, 95% CI [0.009; 0.038]. This association
is also observed through positive reevaluation B = 0.017, SD = 0.004, 95% CI [0.093; 0.028],
active physiological regulation B = 0.002, SD = 0.0017, 95% CI [0.0003; 0.0073], and reg-
ulated expression B = −0.0044, SD = 0.0023, 95% CI [−0.010; −0.001]. On the other
hand, well-being is negatively associated with adjustment through acceptance B = −0.0044,
SD = 0.0023, 95% CI [−0.010; −0.001] and discharge B = −0.0048, SD = 0.0022,

95% CI [−0.010; −0.0014]. The indirect effect is 0.0656 and explains 42% of the total
effect (see Figure 3).

9. Discussion

The three hypotheses postulated in this study were partially conﬁrmed. Differences
in the use and, to a lesser extent, the efﬁcacy of regulation strategies were found between
workers, students, and athletes. Dysfunctional regulation strategies such as rumination and
social comparison are maladaptive for workers and students but not for athletes, which
has also been shown in previous studies [18]. Moreover, maladaptive strategies in the
former two groups such as confrontation and suppression do not have negative effects on
athletes (H1).

There is a congruent relationship between the use of functional strategies and ad-
justment to stress, well-being, and health-related quality of life. This congruence is also
found to some extent in humor styles such as self-afﬁrmation, as well as in creativity, both
emotional and applied or innovation in the ideation phase to cope with a conﬂicting work
situation (H2). However, negative heteroregulation, that worsens the emotions of others, is
associated with well-being and personal adjustment in the student sample. This result may
suggest that attempting to inﬂuence the emotions of others, even critically, has positive
effects for the individual, reinforces self-esteem and personal self-efﬁcacy, even if it has
negative effects on others. However, this conclusion must be relativized because of the low
reliability of the scale.

Furthermore, it was conﬁrmed that adaptive regulation strategies mediate the re-
lationship between well-being and adjustment to stress (H3). It is possible to conclude
that the use of adaptive self- and hetero-regulation strategies facilitates adjustment and is
related psychological well-being. Conﬁrming their general adaptive nature, the following
strategies were associated with adjustment and well-being: direct coping, social support,
distraction, self-reward, gratitude, reappraisal, active physiological regulation, use of hu-
mor and affection, as well as regulated expression. On the other hand, low psychological
abandonment, low passive physiological regulation, and low suppression were associated
with adjustment and well-being. The results suggest that individuals who know and regu-
late their own emotions properly can be more effective in work, studies, and sports teams.
This is consistent with a recent meta-analysis showing the relevance of these emotional
processes in adaptive behavior in different contexts [55]. A state of high well-being has
horizontal inﬂuence between peers, and vertical inﬂuence through the leaders, helping to
create a positive group climate. Since moods tend to be contagious and/or transmitted in

Emotional creativity analyzes were performed on N = 104 workers and creativity or innovation in its ideation phase in the face of a labor conflict on N = 55. The humor style questionnaire (HSQ) was applied to N = 25 Chilean university students. E.C = emo-tional creativity. CL = labor dispute. AF = affiliative, AFF = self-assertive, HA = aggressive, ADD = self-deprecating. n.d. = no data. Dysfunctional or non-adaptive strategies in italics. Supporting the scale’s validity, there is an association between emotional creativity (ECI-S scale) and creativity in response to a work conflict (E1). In turn, emotional creativ-ity as a trait is positively and significantly associated with adjustment and strategies linked to high well-being (direct coping, social support, re-evaluation, spirituality, infor-mation seeking, active physiological regulation, regulated emotional expression), as well as with acceptance, social participation, and rituals. It is also positively associated with non-adaptive strategies such as rumination, social comparison, and discharge, and nega-tively associated with suppression. In this study, creativity, or innovation in the ideation phase as a response to a work conflict is positively and significantly associated with re-evaluation, active physiological regulation, and information seeking. It is negatively asso-ciated with suppression. Finally, functional forms of regulation (direct coping, negotia-tion, reevaluation, active physiological regulation) are positively and dysfunctional (aban-don, rumination, passive physiological, suppression) are negatively v associated to health-related quality of life in workers (SF-36 scale).  8.7. Effect of Self-Regulation Strategies as Mediator Variables with Well-Being and Adjustment To examine H3 mediational analyses [54] were performed with the sample of stu-dents, using well-being as predictor, adjustment as the dependent variable (DV), and reg-ulation strategies by area as mediator variables (MV). Well-being and regulation strategies explain 28% of the variance in adjustment. Well-being is positively and indirectly associ-ated with adjustment through direct coping B = 0.023, SD = 0.0052, 95% CI [0.014; 0.035] and lower psychological abandonment B = 0.023, SD = 0.0073, 95% CI [0.009; 0.038]. This association is also observed through positive reevaluation B = 0.017, SD = 0.004, 95% CI [0.093; 0.028], active physiological regulation B = 0.002, SD = 0.0017, 95% CI [0.0003; 0.0073], and regulated expression B = −0.0044, SD = 0.0023, 95% CI [−0.010; −0.001]. On the other hand, well-being is negatively associated with adjustment through acceptance B = −0.0044, SD = 0.0023, 95% CI [−0.010; −0.001] and discharge B = −0.0048, SD = 0.0022, 95% CI [−0.010; −0.0014]. The indirect effect is 0.0656 and explains 42% of the total effect (see Figure 3).  Figure 3. Relationship between well-being (measured with PHI) and stress adjustment in a sample of students (E2). Emotional regulation strategies are the mediators (MARS scale). The coefficients Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6865

both work teams and groups, when they are positive in a high well-being climate, they can
help mitigate negative situations in study, work, and sports groups [56]. When leaders are
in a good mood, team/group members are more positive and cooperate more [57]. These
aspects can facilitate their creativity [48,58].

In the following paragraphs we discuss, in detail, the difference in frequency of use of
the strategies between students, workers and athletes. We then examine their functionality
in each group. We differentiate in our discussion the three phases of Gross’s model:
situation modiﬁcation and social bonding, attention reorientation and cognitive change,
and ﬁnally, experience modiﬁcation and emotional regulation.

9.1. Differences between Groups on the Frequency of Strategies: Modiﬁcation of Situation and
Social Relationships

Regarding the facet of modiﬁcation of the situation and social relationships, it was
found that athletes use problem-solving and social support-seeking strategies (especially instrumen-
tal and informative) more than workers. The effect size was small, of eta squared 0.01 or 0.02,
equivalent to an r = 0.10 or 0.14 or d = 0.20 or 0.28. These results could be explained by
the fact that direct action (see items 04, 05 and 06 in Table 2) is possibly more frequent in
the professional sports context, although it is also expected to be commonly used in the
educational context and desirable in the workplace. Lower use of social support strategy in
the worker sample than in the student sample, is probably explained by the fact that the
work environment tends to be more concrete and focused on the individual than that of
sports—especially if it is cooperative or collective.

Students speciﬁcally seek more emotional social support, and express and discharge emo-
tions more intensely than the other two groups, as described below. This could be explained
by a more informal youth sociability and more horizontal social relationships. It is possible that
in work and high-performance sports contexts, more regulated interactions give less room
for expressive spontaneity.

Overall, students use more regulation forms that involve mobilizing social relationships in
line with more horizontal and spontaneous interactions that occur in the educational setting.
Speciﬁcally, students make relatively more use—than workers- of negotiation. In turn,
athletes make greater use of rituals as a regulation strategy than the other two groups.

9.2. Modiﬁcation of Situation and Social Relationships: Searching Social Support, Altruism and
Negotiation as Adaptive Strategies and Mediation and Delegation as Inadpative Strategies

The results show that direct coping, seeking social support, and low avoidance are adaptive
emotional regulation strategies. In addition, some forms of social regulation, like helping
and negotiating with others are effective forms of regulation. Altruism and negotiation
are associated with adjustment and well-being in students and workers. This result conﬁrms
that helping others allows individuals to move away from egocentrism and feel effective
and socially integrated [20]. Helping others, even if done “selﬁshly”, is effective [19].
Negotiation may be adaptive because it involves negotiating at a similar level of status and
reducing conﬂict.

Others forms of social regulation, like mediation and delegation are negatively associated
with adjustment in workers, but not in students. The results suggest that asking for a third-party
intervention in the work context is not functional, probably because it implies “breaking”
deﬁned roles. Delegating to others is also not adaptive in either group. In performance
or achievement contexts, delegating is associated with not directly taking control of the
situation, which can result in low levels of effectiveness and self-esteem.

9.3. Social Participation, Private and Public Rituals and Adjustment; Adaptives in Students and
Athletes Respectively

Social participation shows a positive association with adjustment and well-being
in students, while in workers, it is negatively associated with well-being. These results
suggest that despite the current weaknesses of the student movement, participating in
social movements has positive effects for students. As for workers, the low well-being in

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6865

18 of 24

relation to social participation could be explained by the weakness of the labor movement
and the cost it could have for salaried personnel.

While rituals are not adaptive in students and show a negative association in workers, they
are associated with well-being and adjustment in athletes. Evidence supports that the level of
collective ritual and its effects are potent in sports contexts where the use of amulets, lucky
signs, coordinated chants, and collective celebrations are behaviors of high frequency and
signiﬁcance [59]. It has been postulated that the use of private rituals is common for coping
with competition anxiety [60,61]. This study conﬁrms this approach, suggesting that using
rituals as a regulation strategy reduces anxiety and helps to focus on the task, allowing for
an improvement in performance.

Cognitive Change

Regarding the aspect of attention deployment and cognitive change, it was found that
students and athletes report using distraction more often than workers as a strategy. Athletes
use self-reward, gratitude, reevaluation, and social comparison more frequently than the other
two groups.

Workers and athletes use spiritual activities strategies more than students. This shows a

greater secularization in young people with higher education than in other groups.

Athletes reevaluate and self-reward more and have a higher attitude of gratitude than the
other two groups—and the effect size was medium high or important. The fact that this
group uses all forms of cognitive change and focus on activity corroborates what has been
found in other studies [62,63]. Although sport is found to be a source of greater satisfaction
and ﬂow than study and work [64], other results qualify this assertion [65]. It is possible
that in the study environment and some work contexts, it is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd and
use positive stimuli to reward oneself. Another explanation is that people may not know
how to use these regulation styles in the analyzed areas, even though they are familiar
with them.

9.5. Attentional Deployment and Cognitive Change: Reevaluation, Gratitude and Self-Reward as
Adaptive Strategies and Rumination and Social Comparison as Inadpative Strategies in
Workers and Students

Reevaluation, gratitude, and self-reward were associated with adjustment and overall well-
being in general, while distraction was only associated with these variables in students and
athletes. Distraction is not adaptive in the workplace probably because the cost of redirecting
attention by ignoring problems instead of focusing on them to solve them is probably
higher than in the other two areas.

Rumination and social comparison are non-adaptive strategies in students and workers,
although they are positively associated with adjustment and well-being in athletes in this and
other study [66]. Although workers report using social comparison at a moderate level,
it is negatively associated with well-being in this group. This last result is also found in
students. Remember that in general, social comparison has been shown to be a maladaptive
regulation strategy [18]. However, in a competitive context such as team sports, ruminating
on thoughts and comparing oneself to others seems to motivate one to perform and feel
better as a result.

9.6. Differences between Groups on the Frequency of Strategies: Experience Modiﬁcation and
regulation of Emotional Responses

In the facet of modiﬁcation of experience and emotional response, it has been found
that workers use more inhibition and suppression of emotions than students and athletes, probably
due to the greater demands for emotional self-control in the workplace. However, it is
important to remark that effect size was small.

Athletes are the ones who report using active physiological regulation more than the other two
groups, in line with the fact that the activity they engage in is predominantly physical—effect size
was strong and explained variance was 5% or more. Workers use this form of regulation at

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6865

19 of 24

an intermediate level, and also report using passive physiological regulation more than
students—effect size was small. This last result could probably be explained by age and
suggests that workers make a greater effort at regulation, although it may not be more
adaptive (in the case of passive regulation).

Students and workers report engaging in more discharge, but athletes confront more than
students and workers- effect size were from small to medium high. This probably reﬂects
the relative greater acceptance of expressiveness in the study/work environment and the
greater need for assertiveness and competitiveness in the sports ﬁeld.

9.7. Experience Modiﬁcation and Regulation of Emotional Response: Active Physiological Reaction,
Regulated Emotional Expression as Adaptive Strategies and Passive Physiological regulation and
Suppression as Inadaptive Strategy

Active physiological regulation shows its adaptive character and passive regulation
shows its dysfunctionality as expected. Regulated emotional expression is adaptive in all
three groups. Previous studies in this ﬁeld have shown that self-regulation and regulation
of others through suppression are associated with low emotional intelligence and poor
psychological adjustment [67]. These results are replicated in this study, except for the case
of athletes. While these strategies have been shown to be maladaptive in other studies,
it was found that both discharge and confrontation were associated with regulated expression of
emotions and adjustment in the sample of workers. These results suggest that direct but non-
aggressive expression of anger may be an adaptive strategy in the work environment [32].
On the other hand, the fact that venting is not dysfunctional in sports can be explained,
in part, because an ideal emotional proﬁle in sports included, among other traits, being
somewhat anxious and a little angry, consistent with the meta-analysis of [68] on sport
psychology and performance.

9.8. Modiﬁcation of Response of Emotions by Humor and Affection as Adaptive Strategy in
Workers and Students

Results show that the use of humor and affection is associated with adjustment and well-
being in workers and students, although not in athletes. This could suggest that the expression
of humor and affection plays different roles depending on the analyzed context. It is
possible that the sense of competition and commitment in sports leads to humor being
considered a distraction -as measured in this study- and that demonstrations of affection
are not desirable or are expressed differently in the context of competitive sports, studying,
and work. It is important to remember, in the same vein, that there was less acceptance
of expressiveness or discharge and greater confrontation in the sports ﬁeld than among
students and workers. Humor styles were also found to be associated with well-being.
Consistent with previous studies [69], in this study, self-enhancing humor was associated with
well-being. Aggressive humor was associated with non-adaptive coping strategies such as
confrontation and discharge, suggesting a social integration cost for this style. However,
this humor style was also associated with altruism, gratitude, and distraction, which help
to obtain social support. Its ambivalent nature can be explained by the fact that it is not
negatively associated with well-being. Self-defeating humor, which is usually associated
with distress neuroticism and low wellbeing [26], was found to be associated with non-
adaptive strategies such as suppression, passive physiological regulation, confrontation,
and delegation, which may explain its general association with distress. However, it was
also associated with reappraisal and active physiological regulation. The ambivalent nature
of self-defeating humor can be explained by the fact that this style focuses on internal
processes. Laughing at oneself as a detached critique can be adaptive, while coping with
stress through intense physical exercise can be an externalized form of coping. However,
the limitations of the sample size relativize these conclusions.

9.9. Adaptive Regulation like Reevaluation and Active Physiological Regulation Are Related to
Emotional Creativity and Creative Solution of Work Conﬂict

Regarding the relationship between regulation and creativity, it was found that reap-
praisal and active physiological regulation are associated with emotional creativity as a trait and
applied to a task. Emotional creativity trait is associated with innovative responses to solve
a labor conﬂict, conﬁrming that it predicts creative performance. The fact that emotional
creativity is associated with regulation strategies that also relate to well-being, and that
both indicators correlate with adjustment, suggests that creativity is adaptive and helps
people to successfully coping with stress and managing emotions. The results indicate
that, in a situation of labor conﬂict, people who give more creative responses did not
choose dysfunctional regulation strategies such as abandon or giving up, or acting as if
nothing happened. They also do not suppress their emotions and report more positive
reappraisal—which helps personal growth -, use greater active physiological regulation,
and information seeking. The results corroborate that low abandonment, ﬁnding the positive
side of the situation, physical activity, high trait emotional creativity, and low suppression make
up an optimal functioning proﬁle for creativity.

9.10. Wellbeing as Dispositional Variable Predicting Adjustment through Adaptive
Regulation—Direct Coping, Low Abandonment, Reappraisal, Active Physiological Regulation,
and Regulated Expression

The analyses conﬁrmed that well-being predicts an adaptive coping proﬁle, and that
these partially mediate between well-being and adjustment, explaining between 10 and 20%
of variance. The speciﬁc strategies that mediate between these variables are direct coping,
low abandonment, reappraisal, active physiological regulation, and regulated expression.
These conﬁrm their central role in emotional regulation. Well-being was associated with
greater acceptance and discharge, which in turn showed a negative effect on adjustment in
this analysis. That is, these strategies mediated negatively. The results suggest that students
with higher well-being tend simultaneously to express their emotions intensely while also
practicing self-control. Multivariate results suggest that, when eliminating the inﬂuence of
other adaptive regulation forms, these strategies (discharge and acceptance) have a negative
inﬂuence, e.g., if the inﬂuence of regulated expression of emotions is eliminated, discharge
itself does not help adjustment. Acceptance, if the inﬂuence of positive reappraisal is
eliminated, is not helpful either. These results were found with nuances in the other
two groups (mediational analysis not shown). For example, in workers, the effect of
well-being on adjustment was shown to be signiﬁcant through gratitude, low discharge,
and high reappraisal. In athletes, acceptance mediated positively between well-being
and adjustment.

As study limitations, it is noted that this is a cross-sectional study that prevents mak-
ing causal statements and that the samples were large but convenience samples. Another
limitation is that the reliabilities of some of the scales, like EROs worsening heteroregu-
lation scale and afﬁliative humor scales—in some of the samples in this study—are low.
MARS strategies such as behavioral avoidance and distraction in athletes, rumination and
active physiological regulation in students, showed reliabilities below 0.70, although not as
low as the previous ones. This limits the scope of the results of this study. Regarding the
results of humor and creativity, the small samples do not allow for generalizing the ﬁndings,
however, they are consistent with previous studies. Future studies need to consider these
limitations when comparing different nations and exploring whether regulation strategies
are inﬂuenced by cultural patterns.

10. Conclusions

In conclusion, it is noted that in general, an adaptive regulation proﬁle would be
formed by high direct coping, which would help people perceive and validate effective
actions. This proﬁle would also involve focusing attention on the positive, self-rewarding,
gratitude attitudes, distracting from the most negative and stressful aspects, and focusing
attention on rewarding stimuli. Not inhibiting emotions and expressing them in a regulated

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6865

21 of 24

manner is another component of the adaptive proﬁle, as well as thinking positively or
reevaluating the situation by distancing oneself from stress and extracting positive aspects
from what has happened. Regarding hetero-regulation, in general, adaptive tactics are
direct coping, reappraisal, and social support for managing the emotions of others. Peo-
ple like their leaders to motivate them and give positive feedback for a job well done.
The mentioned proﬁle of self and hetero-regulation can contribute to high well-being.
Speciﬁcally, this proﬁle should be examined in different samples and their speciﬁcities,
e.g., criticism and expression of dissatisfaction with the emotions of others in the sports
context are associated with well-being, suggesting that in that context, they are adaptive.
Training and intervention in the area of affective regulation should take into account the
predominance of functional emotional social inﬂuence on others, which contributes to
generating emotionally positive climates with low negativity.
