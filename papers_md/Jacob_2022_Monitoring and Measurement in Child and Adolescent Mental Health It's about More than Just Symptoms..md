Routine outcome monitoring (ROM) provides information to practitioners and others
providing healthcare support to demonstrate the impact of interventions and for service
evaluation. ROM usually takes the form of questionnaires that are regularly administered
to patients, from which healthcare professionals can gauge to what extent therapy is
progressing [1]. Such questionnaires can be used as clinical tools that may help facilitate
better collaborative practice; to extrapolate discussions about how a young person or family
sees progress and their experiences of the work with the practitioner [2]. ROM is widely
used in youth mental health services [2–5] although not without its challenges, including
limited resources, and lack of clinical “buy-in” [3,6–9]. The majority of ROM questionnaires
are standardized, comprising ﬁxed items that span difﬁculties identiﬁed by clinicians most
often focused on symptomology [10] and often speciﬁc to certain population groups, e.g.,
age range; learning disabilities; perinatal.

Evidence suggests that clinicians are less accurately able to predict patient outcomes
using clinical judgement alone, particularly when a patient is veering off a projected track
of progress [11,12]. It is also important to consider the differences between the use of
measures and the use of measures with feedback: of incorporating discussion about the
measurement questions, and areas of tracking focus, into the work with young people, and
families/carers, as relevant. The importance of using outcome measures in a considered
way is a matter of ethical concern and has been advised for a number of years [2]. This
is where the use of measures and the collection of data are conducted in a way that is
meaningful to the client and practitioner, and is not just a bureaucratic exercise, absent of
any discussion with the client. Further, central to this considered use of ROM is discussion
and focus on areas of outcome tracking that are important to the young person [10,13–15].
When used as part of collaborative practice, shared decision-making, and to empower
clients, the use of ROM has been perceived by clients as helpful, as a means to enhance
communication and to stimulate reﬂection [2,16]. Goal setting as ROM has been described
as a conduit for a shared understanding of difﬁculties and ways forward [17,18], and key
to young people feeling heard, valued and understood [2,18,19].

In a review of evidence regarding the impact of feedback from outcome measures on
treatment effectiveness, incorporating feedback from standardized measures into ongoing
therapy sessions with youth has been evidenced as useful in just over half of all cases [20].
Of particular importance was the use of feedback to ensure better outcomes for those who
are veering off a projected trajectory, and better outcomes are reported when feedback is
provided to both the practitioner and the patient [20]. In a meta-analysis from around the
same time, Tam and Ronan [21] found a small but signiﬁcant effect size of 0.20 (Hedges’s g)
for feedback with youth. However, the authors of both studies advise caution in interpreta-
tion due the considerable heterogeneity across the reviewed studies and outcome measures.
As far as we are aware, there have been no more recent reviews of the literature to further
these ﬁndings, and recent Cochrane reviews highlight a paucity of evidence generally in

both adult and youth settings [22,23]. Research to date has prioritized the experiences of
youth in the use of routine outcome measures, which is of paramount importance.

There are several examples of measurement-focused care worldwide e.g., [2,24–26].
However, these initiatives tend to focus on symptomology tracking, as opposed to more
complementary elements of change and improvement, such as functioning or empower-
ment. Whilst a focus on symptoms can be important, it will not be the principle area of
change for all. The challenges of relying heavily on symptomology are that other important
areas of outcome may be missed. For example, evidence demonstrates that widely avail-
able youth outcome measures do not capture the gamut of goals set by youth for focus in
therapy, including existential areas of improvement such as understanding oneself, being
independent or responsible, and increasing conﬁdence [14]. A recent systematic review also
reported that clients of all ages can experience ROM as suspicious, and limited in its ability
to fully capture their needs [16]. Further, focusing solely on only one area of change, namely
symptomology, runs the risk of over- or under- reporting levels of change; varied levels
of improvement have been demonstrated when focused on different areas of measure-
ment. Evidence suggests that only around 16% of youths report consistent cross-domain
improvement, and one in four young people have reported signiﬁcant improvements in
symptoms but not in functioning. Further, one in three young people reported signiﬁcant
goal progress but not signiﬁcant symptom improvement [27], and when goal data were
added to combined analysis of symptom-based outcome analysis, an increase in the overall
level of measurable improvement and a reduction in the no measurable change category
was reported for youths [28].

There are also issues with the inclusiveness of self-report measures in particular. As
text-based methods, these outcome measures could exclude some young people, either
due to cultural or linguistic reasons, or because they have learning disabilities. Such
examples include the propensity for standardized outcome measures to be developed
based on experiences, behaviors, and attitudes of young White people from the Global
North, which is underpinned by a general lack of research focused on young people in the
Global South [29], despite 85% of the world’s youth being in Global South countries [30].
Further, mental health and wellbeing measure questions have been found to not be age-
appropriate [31], and young people have raised challenges associated with the readability
of them [32], also highlighting the frequent disparities between chronological age and
reading age. These factors render a mismatch between standardized questions and many
young people’s understanding and interpretation of their own experiences, as well as the
understanding and interpretation of the data derived from the measures. The measurement
of patients who have experienced trauma is also often excluded from exploration (e.g., [33]),
or not adequately capturing relevant areas of outcome [34]. This further highlights the
importance of considering complementary areas and methods of ROM.

This Special Issue is focused on a wide range of ROM. This includes measurement consid-
erations for tracking quality of life (Krause et al.) and empowerment (Harju-Seppänen et al.),
contextualizing, and complexity factors (da Costa et al.), the exploration of goal setting for
use with young people who have experienced trauma (Law et al.), and who are receiving
mental health interventions in school (Duncan et al.), the exploration of mental and physical
health outcomes for children and young people with chronic physical health difﬁculties
(Hiremath et al.), and for those who use the dark web (Idelji-Tehrani et al.). Tying all
of these studies together, the clear need for additional monitoring outside of traditional
symptom tracking is required for youth mental health and wellbeing support. It has been
long recommended that individualized measures, or those that seek to explore a holistic
view of outcomes, are used alongside standardized symptom focused outcome measures
to ensure a breadth of information is explored [35–38]. By reﬂecting on the monitoring and
measurement in child and adolescent mental health through this wide range of methods
and approaches, we hope that this Special Issue furthers learning in the ﬁeld. Through this
multifaceted exploration of ROM, we hope it helps to promote reﬂection, which is useful at
all levels of service provision, from the use of measures by practitioners, to wider policy

and research considerations, retaining at the heart a considered focus on young people as
whole beings and with areas of important outcome measurement which reach beyond a
sole focus on symptoms.
