Although the beneﬁts of physical activity (PA) on mental well-being are well established, the vulnerability of women during
pregnancy and the postpartum period poses challenges in studying the effects of PA on postpartum depression (PPD). This study
investigated the association between total and domain-speciﬁc PA levels during pregnancy and postpartum depressive symptoms.
The study included 105 healthy pregnant women whose PA status was evaluated by the Serbian version of the Physical Activity
Questionnaire during Pregnancy (PPAQ-SRB) and their postpartum mental health by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the independent relationship between PPAQ-SRB scores and the prediction of
the PPD symptom occurrence. Our analysis revealed that the development of PPD symptomatology was associated with a lower
“Total PPAQ-SRB score” (odds ratio (OR) 0.81; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) [0.70–0.93]; p ¼ 0:03) and “Total Activity score” (OR
0.82; 95% CI [0.71–0.93]; p ¼ 0:03) as well as lower scores of light-intensity PA (OR 0.81; 95% CI [0.69–0.96]; p ¼ 0:013),
moderate-intensity PA (OR 0.82; 95% CI [0.71–0.94]; p ¼ 0:005), “Household/care” (OR 0.85; 95% CI [0.73–0.98]; p ¼ 0:028),
and “Occupational” activities (OR 0.80; 95% CI [0.78–0.95]; p ¼ 0:012Þ. Lower levels of light-to-moderate-intensity household and
occupational activities appeared to increase the risk of PPD, indicating the importance of circumstances under which PA is
performed. Hence, our ﬁndings indicate that PA during pregnancy can mitigate mood disorders in postpartum mothers. Moreover,
reduced participation in light-to-moderate-intensity household and occupational activities seemed to increase the risk of PPD.

1. Introduction

Postpartum depression (PPD) is a heterogeneous illness, both
in terms of manifested symptoms and the circumstances under
which they emerge [1, 2].

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-
Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) establishes a timeframe of 4 weeks
following childbirth as the threshold for identifying the post-
partum onset of PPD [3]. In contrast, the International Clas-
siﬁcation of Diseases-Tenth Revision (ICD-10) categorizes
mental disorders as related to the puerperium if they com-
mence within 6 weeks after delivery [4]. Moreover, a group of

experts from different countries assembled in Sweden previ-
ously proposed that the “postnatal onset” be deﬁned as a
period of 3 months post-birth. This was inﬂuenced by the
ﬁndings of Kendell et al. [5], showing that there is an elevated
risk of hospitalization for various psychiatric disorders within
the ﬁrst 90 days following childbirth. Recently, the modiﬁca-
tion from the diagnostic label “postpartum depression” in
DSM-IV to “peripartum onset” in DSM-Fifth Edition is based
on empirical ﬁndings indicating that approximately half of
the episodes of depression commonly referred to as PPD typi-
cally manifest before childbirth [6]. Accordingly, the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists deﬁnes perinatal

2

Depression and Anxiety

depression as the experience of both severe and moderate
depressive episodes during pregnancy or the ﬁrst year after
delivery [7].

Several epidemiological studies have been conducted world-
wide on the prevalence, course, and nature of PPD. A recent
study that included both a systematic review and a meta-
analysis found that the overall prevalence of PPD was 14.0%.
Furthermore, depending on the country’s income classiﬁca-
tion, the prevalence ranges from 5% to 26.3% [8]. According
to a previous study conducted in Serbia, 11.8% of postpartum
women had signs of PPD [9].

Psychopathology during and after pregnancy can be attrib-
uted to multiple interconnected factors. Moreover, the coexis-
tence of diverse risk factors is anticipated to enhance women’s
vulnerability to PPD. These include a positive family history of
affective disorders and other psychiatric illnesses [10, 11, 12,
13] and PPD [14], a personal history of previous depressive
episodes or other psychiatric illness [10], a personal history of
PPD [11], and premenstrual dysphoric disorder [15]; stressful
life events during pregnancy or in the early postpartum period
[12, 16]; feeling of depression or anxiety [12, 17]; and perceived
social isolation (or lack of social support) during pregnancy [18]
and having a low level of social support during the postpartum
[19, 20]. Additional potential risk factors associated with the
onset of depressive symptoms include cesarean delivery [21],
poor sleep patterns immediately before childbirth [22], height-
ened weight gain during the preceding pregnancy [23], multi-
parity [18], strained partner relationships [11], stress related to
impending childcare responsibilities, challenges in emotional
acceptance when faced with a newborn with an intense tem-
perament, and unplanned or undesired pregnancy [24].

Owing to the vulnerability of women during pregnancy
and the postpartum period, evidence-based interventions for
PPD are primarily conﬁned to pharmacotherapy, cognitive
and interpersonal supportive therapy, psychosocial support
through support groups, and complementary therapies [25].
The implementation of PA as an intervention is based on a
limited number of studies that could offer a certain level of
evidence for group exercise interventions and exercise counsel-
ing with the personal choice of exercise as an effective treat-
ment for reducing PPD symptoms. Therefore, in light of PA
intervention, the majority of randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) reviewed in a recently published meta-analysis found
improvements in postpartum depressive symptoms with 30
min of moderate-intensity activity performed three to ﬁve
times per week for 4–6 months [26]. Moreover, another dose–
response meta-analysis identiﬁed physical activity (PA) as a
potentially advantageous intervention to decrease the likelihood
of PPD, particularly since engaging in 90 min of PA per week
could effectively reduce the risk of PPD [27].

Our objective was to investigate the association between total
and domain-speciﬁc PA during pregnancy and PPD symptoms
in healthy Serbian women who had a vaginal delivery.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study Design. This study included 105 healthy women
between the ages of 18 and 40 who received perinatal and

obstetrical care at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic,
“Narodni Front,” in Belgrade, Serbia, from October 2020 to
March 2021.

2.2. Participants. Healthy women who had experienced uncom-
plicated singleton pregnancies were consecutively enrolled in
the present study. Women with multiple pregnancies (two or
more fetuses), women who underwent fertility treatment,
women with chronic diseases, gestational complications, sys-
temic, and/or local infections that could prevent the partici-
pant from being physically active during pregnancy, women
with a previous history of malignant, systemic, autoimmune,
or musculoskeletal disorders, liver and renal disease, restric-
tive lung disease, women with psychiatric disorders, and those
who did not speak Serbian ﬂuently were excluded. Parity was
deﬁned as the number of children ever born to a woman and
was categorized into three categories (0, 1, and ≥2). The study
was conducted according to the guidelines of the World Med-
ical Association’s International Code of Medical Ethics (Dec-
laration of Helsinki), and informed consent was obtained by
mothers before participating in the study. This research was
approved by the clinic’s ethics committee (decision number:
05006-2021-1525; date of approval: September 17, 2020).

2.3. Data Collection. A general questionnaire was designed to
collect sociodemographic and clinical information from par-
ticipants. PA during pregnancy was assessed using the Ser-
bian version of the Physical Activity Questionnaire during
Pregnancy (PPAQ-SRB) [28], and depressive symptom sever-
ity was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
Scale (EPDS) [29]. Both questionnaires have been linguisti-
cally adapted and standardized [29, 30].

The general questionnaire was related to sociodemo-
graphic characteristics (age, level of education, occupation,
marital status, and socioeconomic status), clinical character-
istics (general and reproductive health of the respondents,
previous and current pregnancies), and lifestyle (smoking,
alcohol consumption, and drug abuse).

The PPAQ-SRB was comprised of 33 questions in which
respondents reported the time spent participating in various
types of PA [28, 30]. A satisfactory level of reliability of the
PPAQ-SRB was achieved (Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient =
0.69, and interclass correlation coefﬁcient from 0.768 to 0.930)
[28, 30]. All participants were interviewed by a qualiﬁed inter-
viewer, and the answers were directly documented in the
questionnaire.

The questionnaire included questions about household/
caregiving, occupational and sports/exercise activities, trans-
portation, and inactivity. The PPAQ questionnaire is an
easy-to-use measurement tool as it assigns a value to each
activity, expressed in metabolic equivalents (METS), per
hour during the week. Participants reported the amount of
time spent on each activity per day or week during the cur-
rent trimester (response options ranged from 0 to 5, where 0
meant no PA at all, and 5 meant 3 or more hours a day). PA
was calculated by multiplying the duration of each of the
mentioned 30 PAs by the average weekly energy consump-
tion (MET·hr/week), according to the instructions of the
authors of the original version of the questionnaire [30].

METS are units used to assess metabolic activity (oxygen
consumption) during PAs; 1 MET for the needs of metabo-
lism at rest (basic life functions) is approximately 3.5 mL of
oxygen/kg/min [31]. The PA of participants was classiﬁed
into sedentary activity (<1.5 MET), low-intensity activity
(1.5 – <3.0 MET), moderate-intensity activity (3.0–6.0 MET),
and high-intensity activity (>6.0 MET) [30].

EPSD is a screening tool used worldwide for assessing
symptoms of PPD [32, 33]. The EPSD consists of 10 questions
that identify symptoms of depression in women during the
postpartum period. The speciﬁed scale is a self-assessment
scale that objectively assesses depressed mood and symptoms
of depression but does not establish a diagnosis of depression,
for which a clinical examination and evaluation by an expert
are necessary. The EPSD was adapted to the population of
pregnant women in the puerperium period in the study by
Odalovic et al. [29], where the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.84 and
0.83 in pregnant and postpartum women, respectively, indi-
cating good internal consistency of the Serbian version of
the EPSD.

The EPSD questionnaire was completed by a trained
interviewer, who interviewed the respondents by phone for
a period of 6–8 weeks after delivery. Each statement in the
questionnaire was evaluated on a four-point scale with
degrees from 0 to 3 and was related to the level of depression
in the last 7 days. The total score of the scale was obtained by
summing all answers to the questionnaire, and the answers
ranged from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating a greater
intensity of depressive symptoms. Score values <8 indicated a
low probability of experiencing symptoms of depression.
Scores from 9 to 11 were considered intermediate probabilities
for the existence of symptoms of depression. Values of 12–13
indicated a high probability of depression symptoms. A thresh-
old value of 14 was considered to indicate a high level of symp-
tomatic depression, that is, the probable existence of PPD. A
positive score (provided answers 1, 2, or 3 are marked) when
answering Question 10 indicates that one is at suicide risk [34].

2.4. Data Analysis. Descriptive statistical methods were used
to characterize patients’ sociodemographic and clinical data.
Continuous variables are presented as averages (Æstandard
deviation), and percentages are used for categorical variables.
The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare PPAQ-SRB
scores among persons with and without symptoms of PPD
because the data were not normally distributed. Univariate
logistic regression analysis (ULRA) and multivariate logistic
regression analysis (MLRA) were used to explore the rela-
tionship between PPAQ-SRB scores and PPD symptoms. An
MLRA was performed to adjust for potential confounding
factors. All p-values were based on two-tailed tests, and sig-
niﬁcance was set at p <0:05. All statistical analyses were
performed using Statistical Package software (version 23.0;
IBM Corp., SPSS Inc., NY, USA).

The observed prevalence of depressive symptoms among

respondents participating in the study was 10.5%.

3.3. Examining the Signiﬁcance of the Difference in PA
through PPAQ-SRB Scores Depending on the Occurrence of
PPD Symptoms. Women with symptoms of PPD had a sig-
niﬁcantly lower “Total score” of PPAQ-SRB (p<0:001) and
“Total activity (PA of light-intensity and above)” (p<0:001).
In addition, signiﬁcantly lower scores were observed for PA
of light-intensity (p ¼ 0:002), moderate-intensity (p<0:001),
“Household/care” (p ¼ 0:004), and “Occupational activities”
(p ¼ 0:008) in women with symptoms of PPD (Table 3).

3.4. Univariate and Multivariate Logistic Regression between
PPAQ-SRB Scores and the Occurrence of PPD Symptoms.
ULRA results showed a signiﬁcant association between
the occurrence of PPD symptoms and the “Total score” of
PPAQ-SRB (p ¼ 0:001) and “Total activities (PA of light-

intensity and above)” (p ¼ 0:001). Also, a signiﬁcant correla-
tion was found between PA scores of light- (p ¼ 0:006) and
moderate-intensity (p ¼ 0:003), as well as “Household/care”
(p ¼ 0:015) and “Occupational” activities (p ¼ 0:017), and the
occurrence of PPD symptoms. These associations remained
signiﬁcant after performing MLRA, which controlled for pos-
sible confounding factors (Table 4).

4. Discussion

In this prospective study following mothers during pregnancy
and up to 8 weeks after delivery, we found lower levels of
postnatal depression in more physically active women.

Our subjects who exhibited depressive symptoms spent
fewer MET hours per week and were less physically active
overall. Interestingly, our participants spent almost the same
number of MET hours per week being inactive suggesting

that mere inactivity is insufﬁcient for PPD development. The
lack of speciﬁc aspects of daily or weekly routines, as well as
their level of intensity, can be indicative of PPD. Speciﬁcally,
women with depressive symptoms in our study engaged in
fewer activities that required low to moderate effort and were
less active in both their households and work environments.
The results of our analysis showed that PA is a protective
factor against the development of signs of depression in post-
partum women. This is in accordance with previous reports
indicating that PA during pregnancy, compared to inactivity,
reduces the risk of developing PPD [27, 35, 36, 37]. Particu-
larly, studies conducted in Europe demonstrated a signiﬁcant
correlation between PA and reduced PPD risk [27]. A cross-
sectional Spanish study showed that pregnant women with
no signs of depression were much more active [38]. A large
French study by Van Der Waerden et al. [39] reported that
high total PPAQ scores were inversely associated with the
odds of depressive symptoms in the ﬁrst postpartum year.
Haßdenteufel et al. [40] showed that women who presented
a greater reduction in PA levels during the course of pregnancy
reported higher anxiety and depression symptom scores through-
out the 6-month postnatal period, indicating that a stable level
of total activity during pregnancy was signiﬁcantly associated
with a reduced probability of PPD occurrence. A Swedish
study by Ekelöf et al. [41] reported that a higher level of PA
during pregnancy was associated with a lower level of depres-
sive symptoms postpartum. Therefore, PA is an essential ele-
ment of a healthy lifestyle for women during childbirth [35].
Looking at PA intensity levels, our study showed that a
decrease in light-to-moderate-intensity PA was crucial for the
development of depressive disorders, as high-intensity levels
were low overall in both groups. A study conducted in Spain
revealed that women who performed moderate physical exer-
cise in an aquatic environment during pregnancy were at
lower risk of PPD than sedentary women [42]. Women who
performed ≥150 min/week of moderate to vigorous PA had a
signiﬁcantly lower risk of PPD symptoms compared to
those who did not accumulate any PA of at least moderate

intensity [43]. Furthermore, as this study was conducted
during the COVID-19 pandemic, unforeseen circumstances
such as lockdowns and movement restrictions may have con-
tributed to these results through the adoption of new habits
when it comes to being intensely active. Therefore, the
observed decline in light-to-moderate PA was signiﬁcant, as
moderate exercise is recognized as a potential protective fac-
tor associated with lower PPD symptom incidence during the
pandemic [44]. Kołomańska-Bogucka et al. [45] compared
the levels of light- and medium-intensity PA during late preg-
nancy before and after the onset of the pandemic. The study
revealed a decrease in both categories during the pandemic,
with particular emphasis on the impact of diminished light-
intensity PA as a predictor for the onset of PPD symptoms,
particularly during the pandemic. The authors reported that
patients diagnosed at risk of developing depressive disorders
had signiﬁcantly reduced overall mobility and lower MET
hours per week during the pandemic [45].

We did not observe signiﬁcant differences in sedentary
time between women with and without PPD, suggesting that
passive leisure time is not a predictor of PPD onset. This is
important because it contradicts the literature data, as it was
previously reported that this type of sedentary behavior in
the third trimester was associated with increased odds of
PPD occurrence [39]. Furthermore, a systematic review revealed
that higher sedentary behavior in the second trimester of preg-
nancy was likely to be associated with PPD and that longer
sitting time may increase the risk of PPD symptoms [46].

Most women in our study engaged in light-to-moderate-
intensity activities, either in their occupational or domestic
settings, as most were employed. Other studies investigating
domains of PA also yielded comparable outcomes, as the exam-
ined cohorts also spent most of their total PA in domestic set-
tings [38, 45] or both home and work environments [39].

Our results indicated that higher levels of PA in occupa-
tional settings were associated with a lower incidence of PPD
symptomatology. Similarly, another study demonstrated that
when assessing PA using the PPAQ during the postpartum

6

Depression and Anxiety

period, higher scores were associated with a reduced likeli-
hood of developing PPD [39]. The obtained outcome was
partly anticipated, as a literature review by Daley et al. [47]
highlighted that occupational PA could be a useful strategy in
lowering PPD occurrence. Occupational PA helps individuals
focus on events other than their speciﬁc life circumstances,
particularly daily hassles and stressful stimuli. Hence, the
“occupational” PPAQ domain of our cohort was signiﬁcant,
as its low scores were a major predictor of screening positive
for PPD. In contrast to our results, a dose–response meta-
analysis of 186,412 women reported that work activities con-
tributed to a greater risk of PPD [38]. Furthermore, our data
suggested that higher levels of domestic and household PA
were associated with lower EPDS scores. Recent investigations
have also conﬁrmed that household activities are the most
energy-consuming PA domain during pregnancy [38, 48].
The available literature offers heterogeneous results when
addressing high domestic activity as a risk factor for PPD
development. Studies have shown that higher levels of house-
hold or caregiving in the third trimester were exclusively
associated with increased odds of PPD [27, 39]. As lower
scores in this domain were a risk factor for PPD in our cohort,
the cultural aspects of PA habits were highlighted. Cultural
differences related to the importance of childcare and home-
care could impact new mothers’ views that could be further
reﬂected in this PPAQ domain, as there is generationally
established knowledge that a well-established home environ-
ment and sufﬁcient mother-care interactions have an impact
on children’s physical, cognitive, and social–emotional devel-
opment [49]. Scores in the sports/exercise domain were not
associated with PPD symptoms in this study. Studies that
used the PPAQ to evaluate this domain of PA in postpartum
women also found similar results, where a signiﬁcant correla-
tion between exercise alone during pregnancy and mental
health during postpartum was not evident [39, 40, 45]. This
contradicts the common notion, as a large meta-analysis
showed that sports activities were associated with relieving
symptoms [27]. When aerobic and strengthening exercises
were tested on mothers who did not exercise before pregnancy
and who initially had a positive score indicating the existence
of depressive symptoms during pregnancy, they showed a
major reduction in their EPDS score (below the score of 12,
used as a threshold for depression) during the postpartum
period compared with the control group that did not exercise
[50]. Coll et al. [51] reported that low compliance with the
exercise protocol, particularly among young and less-educated
women, could be one of the main reasons why PA has not
realized its full potential as a therapeutic and preventive inter-
vention for PPD. It is possible that women reduced or discon-
tinued their sports activities during late pregnancy, as it was
shown that sports/exercise domains contributed relatively little
to the total activity score, especially during the last trimester of
pregnancy [39]. However, there is a need for PA domain
exploration in further research, as a limited number of studies
have examined the impact of antenatal PA domains on PPD.
Strengths of our study include prospective design, the use
of reliable and valid assessment tools for evaluation of PA
during pregnancy and symptoms of PPD, and consideration

of a variety of important confounding factors such as age at
delivery, place of residence, employment, socioeconomic con-
ditions, BMI, and gestational weight gain. We determined the
frequency, duration, and intensity of each PA domain and
investigated their associations with PPD symptoms, which
have been rarely studied in this population.

On the other hand, this study has limitations as well,
including the use of self-report instruments to assess PA and
symptoms of PPD, which may introduce some degree of mis-
classiﬁcation. Although both questionnaires demonstrated
good measurement properties, clinical assessment of PPD
and PA measurements using an accelerometer or a heart
rate monitor could provide more objective estimates. Fur-
thermore, our ﬁndings may have been subject to residual
confounding because we were unable to assess additional
potential non-measured confounders, such as stress and
sleep quality. Finally, our study was conducted using a small
population from a single center with homogeneous charac-
teristics, which may limit the generalizability of our results.

5. Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is one of the very few studies exploring
the association between PA domains during pregnancy and
PPD symptoms. The results of our study are consistent with
previous studies showing that PA during pregnancy may
improve depressive mood and symptoms during the postpar-
tum period. In addition, lower levels of light-to-moderate-
intensity household and occupational activities were associated
with an increased risk of PPD, indicating that contextual fac-
tors may inﬂuence the way in which PA is correlated with
mood and well-being. Our ﬁndings may contribute to the
development of potentially viable strategies for preventing
depression in new mothers, as well as the reﬁnement of public
health recommendations regarding appropriate PA engage-
ment during pregnancy for postpartum mental health beneﬁts.
