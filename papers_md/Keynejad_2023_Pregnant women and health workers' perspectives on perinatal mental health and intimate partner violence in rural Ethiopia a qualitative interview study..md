Abstract 
Background  Mental health conditions are common during the perinatal period and associated with maternal, foetal, 
and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is an established bidirectional relationship between mental health condi-
tions and intimate partner violence (IPV), including during and after pregnancy. Mean lifetime prevalence of physical, 
sexual or emotional IPV exposure among women in rural Ethiopia is estimated to be 61% and may be even higher 
during the perinatal period. We aimed to explore the perspectives of women and antenatal care (ANC) health workers 
on the relationship between all types of IPV and perinatal mental health, to inform the adaptation of a psychological 
intervention for pregnant women experiencing IPV in rural Ethiopia.

Methods  We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 16 pregnant women and 12 health workers in the 
Gurage zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People’s Region of Ethiopia, between December 2018 and 
December 2019. We conducted thematic analysis of English-translated transcripts of audio-recorded Amharic-lan-
guage interviews.

Results  Participants contextualised IPV as the primary form of abusive treatment women experienced, connected 
by multiple pathways to emotional and bodily distress. Patriarchal norms explained how the actions of neighbours, 
family, community leaders, law enforcement, and government agents in response to IPV often reinforced women’s 
experiences of abuse. This created a sense of powerlessness, exacerbated by the tension between high cultural 
expectations of reciprocal generosity and severe deprivation. Women and health workers advocated a psychological 
intervention to address women’s powerlessness over the range of difficulties they faced in their daily lives.

Conclusions  Women and health workers in rural Ethiopia perceive multiple, interconnected pathways between IPV 
and perinatal emotional difficulties. Contrary to expectations of sensitivity, women and health workers were comfort-
able discussing the impact of IPV on perinatal mental health, and supported the need for brief mental health inter-
ventions integrated into ANC.

Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) recognises vio-
lence  against  women  as  a  major  public  health  concern, 
mostly  comprising  intimate  partner  violence  (IPV)  [1]. 
IPV  is  behaviour  by  an  intimate  partner  or  ex-partner, 
which  causes  physical,  sexual,  or  psychological  harm 
[1].  A  WHO  multi-country  study  [2]  of  24,000  women 
across 10 low, middle, and high-income countries found 
high  prevalence  estimates  of  physical  (13–61%),  sexual 
(6–59%), and psychological (20–75%) IPV.

IPV during pregnancy is associated with adverse health 
outcomes, including obstetric and neonatal risks, mental 
health  conditions,  suicide,  and  femicide  [3,  4].  Under-
standing  stakeholders’  perspectives  on  the  relationship 
between IPV and perinatal mental health is an important 
first  step  to  developing  and  adapting  interventions  inte-
grated into antenatal care (ANC).

A systematic review of 10 studies found a mean lifetime 
prevalence  of  any  IPV  in  Ethiopia  among  women  aged 
15–49 years  of  61%  [5],  constituting  48%  physical  IPV, 
40% sexual IPV, and 52% emotional IPV. A meta-analysis 
of eight studies (n = 2691 women) found a pooled preva-
lence of IPV during pregnancy in Ethiopia of 26% (confi-
dence interval (CI): 20–32) [6].

Frameworks of IPV

The  multi-level  forces  which  drive  IPV  in  diverse  con-
texts are captured by the integrated ecological framework 
[7].  Adopted  by  WHO  [8]  and  later  revised  to  reflect 
evidence-based  risk  factors  in  low  and  middle-income 
countries  (LMICs)  [9],  it  considers  ‘conflict  arena’,  rela-
tionship,  male  partner,  woman,  community,  and  mac-
rosocial  factors.  Drivers  of  IPV  perpetration  [10]  were 
reviewed by the ‘what works to prevent violence against 
women  and  girls?’  global  programme.  Structural  factors 
(poverty, gender inequality, and normalisation of violence 
in  social  relationships)  interacted  with  individual  and 
relationship  factors  (poor  communication,  poor  mental 
health, substance abuse, child maltreatment, and disabil-
ity) to drive IPV, exacerbated by armed conflict and post-
conflict conditions.

Perspectives on IPV in Ethiopia

Three  qualitative  studies  have  explored  IPV  in  Ethiopia 
with  stakeholders,  predominantly  community  members 
involved in responding to IPV. In Gondar, in-depth inter-
views and focus groups (n = 46) [11] found that IPV was 
sometimes considered a sign of love and rationalised by 
reference to religious teachings. The authors noted a dis-
tinction  drawn  between  acceptable  conflict  and  abuse, 
depending  on  perceived  severity  and  reasonableness.  A 
second focus group study [12] in East Wollega (n = 115) 
found  that  IPV  was  considered  a  justifiable  response  to 

confirmed  or  suspected  infidelity,  “failure  to  give  birth”, 
disobedience,  recurrent  disagreement,  and  “control-
ling  and  non-domestic”  behaviour.  All-male  arbitra-
tion  panels  encouraged  women  to  withdraw  cases,  and 
courts  demanded  extensive  evidence  to  convict  men.  A 
third  interview  and  focus  group  study  (n = 30)  in  Debre 
Tabor  [13]  found  that  the  concept  of  marital  rape  was 
often  disputed.  The  study  authors  attributed  the  sever-
ity of IPV to women’s “failure” to disclose it, indicating a 
cycle of blame which locates responsibility for IPV within 
women.

Finally,  two  studies  explored  IPV  during  pregnancy  in 
Jimma. In-depth interviews with 10 male and six female 
stakeholders  [14]  found  that  disadvantages  of  divorce 
were  cited  to 
justify  reconciliation  and  discourage 
reporting.  Women’s  affairs  office  staff  were  threatened 
by abusive partners and obstructed by courts. Ten semi-
structured  interviews  with  ANC  health  workers  [15] 
found  that  although  familiar  with  physical  health  and 
obstetric complications of IPV, clinicians did not discuss 
mental health impacts or psychological abuse.

Perinatal mental health in Ethiopia

Several  qualitative  studies  have  explored  women’s  expe-
riences  of  antenatal  and  postnatal  distress  and  depres-
sion  in  the  Southern  Nations,  Nationalities  and  People’s 
Region  (SNNPR)  of  Ethiopia.  In  the  Butajira  health  and 
demographic  surveillance  site,  25  in-depth  interviews 
and  five  focus  groups  were  conducted  with  community 
stakeholders  [16].  IPV  was  commonly  discussed;  some 
women  attributed  worsening  IPV  during  pregnancy  to 
their increased dependence on their partner. In the same 
sample  [17],  participants  linked  postnatal  distress  to 
socio-cultural difficulties. These included pressures in the 
postpartum  period  (including  expectations  to  perform 
specific  socio-cultural  practices),  worsening  financial  or 
marital  difficulties,  and  inability  to  access  help  due  to 
the  practice  of  postnatal  confinement.  Inability  to  earn 
money rendered postpartum women more dependent on 
partners,  increasing  the  risk  of  IPV,  resulting  in  distress 
and suicidal thoughts.

Qualitative  interviews  were  also  conducted  in  the 
Sodo  district  of  SNNPR  with  health  workers  and  preg-
nant  women  experiencing  depressive  symptoms  [18]. 
Women  described  somatic  manifestations  of  depression 
during pregnancy, in terms of exhaustion and headaches. 
Women and health workers conceptualised depression as 
a state of “thinking too much.” Life difficulties, reproduc-
tive  health  problems,  uncompassionate  care  in  labour, 
and  marital  conflict  were  all  cited  as  preoccupations  of 
women who were “thinking too much”.

Although  a  rich  qualitative  literature  has  explored 
IPV  and  perinatal  mental  health  in  Ethiopia  separately,

few  interview  studies  have  focused  on  the  relationship 
between women’s experiences of IPV and perinatal emo-
tional  difficulties.  To  inform  the  adaptation  of  a  brief 
psychological  intervention  for  rural  Ethiopian  ANC,  we 
sought to answer the following research questions.

1.  What  are  women’s  experiences  of  IPV  during  the 

perinatal period, in this context?

2.  What  are  women  and  health  workers’  perceptions 
of  emotional  difficulties  during  the  perinatal  period, 
and their relationship to IPV?

Methods
Setting

SNNPR  is  one  of  thirteen  regions  and  chartered  cities 
in  Ethiopia.  The  district  of  Sodo,  where  this  study  was 
conducted,  has  a  projected  population  of  161,097  [19]. 
Ethiopian  primary  care,  including  ANC,  comprises  sat-
ellite  ‘health  posts’  staffed  by  health  extension  workers 
(HEWs), health centres staffed by family doctors, nurses, 
midwives, and health officers, and primary hospitals.

Study design and methodological orientation

We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with preg-
nant  women  and  ANC  health  workers,  to  explore  their 
perspectives and experiences of IPV and its relationship 
to mental health. We adopted the interpretivist view that 
participants and researchers make subjective interpreta-
tions  of  the  social  world  through  their  lived  experience 
[20].  We  considered  our  research  an  inductive  process, 
grounded in the data, albeit influenced by our theoretical 
orientations.

Sample

We recruited health workers and pregnant women from 
health centres and health posts delivering ANC in Sodo 
and  neighbouring  Butajira,  to  triangulate  the  perspec-
tives  of  different  stakeholders  [21].  We  recruited  a  pur-
posive sample to capture the views of women of diverse 
age, religion, and educational levels, and of health work-
ers  of  diverse  age,  religion,  specialty,  qualifications,  and 
years  of  experience.  The  research  assistant  (RA)  asked 
health  workers  to  identify  pregnant  women  who  had 
reported symptoms of emotional distress, or whom they 
suspected could be experiencing IPV. Due to the absence 
of a formal IPV screening system, health workers identi-
fied potentially eligible women under their care based on 
knowledge  of  their  personal  circumstances.  Potentially-
eligible women were also identified from participants in 
an ANC survey who had reported depressive symptoms 
on  the  locally-validated  patient  health  questionnaire 
[22], and relationship difficulties on a five-item screening 

questionnaire [23]. We anticipated conducting a total of 
between 20 and 30 interviews, based on the literature in 
this  field.  We  determined  the  point  of  theoretical  satu-
ration  through  discussion  between  the  first  author,  last 
author,  and  the  RA  conducting  interviews,  once  the  RA 
noted  that  new  perspectives  were  not  being  raised  by 
participants  beyond  those  already  captured.  The  first 
and  last  author  agreed  the  point  of  theoretical  satura-
tion,  informed  by  the  breadth  of  perspectives  described 
in existing literature [24].

Inclusion criteria

Eligible  participants  were  required  to  be  female,  aged 
16 years  or  over,  pregnant,  conversant  in  Amharic,  able 
to understand the information (discuss the study with the 
RA and respond to questions about their interest in tak-
ing part), and giving informed consent.

We  did  not  formally  screen  women  for  IPV  exposure, 
to  keep  recruitment  as  inclusive  as  possible,  and  avoid 
excluding  women  experiencing  but  not  disclosing  IPV. 
Previous  qualitative  research  in  the  same  setting  which 
did  not  purposively  sample  women  experiencing  IPV 
found  that  it  was  frequently  described  by  participants 
[16–18].  We  therefore  considered  any  otherwise  eligi-
ble  pregnant  woman  to  meet  inclusion  criteria,  if  her 
ANC  health  worker  suspected  that  she  was  experienc-
ing IPV, or if she had endorsed relationship difficulties on 
the  aforementioned  ANC  survey.  Health  workers  were 
required to work in ANC, be conversant in Amharic, and 
give informed consent.

Exclusion criteria

Women  were  excluded  from  participation  if  they  were 
acutely unwell, requiring emergency treatment, or the RA 
noted  difficulty  in  them  understanding,  remembering, 
considering  the  advantages  and  disadvantages,  or  com-
municating their views about the information provided.

Informed consent

The RA provided eligible women and health workers with 
written  and  verbal  information  (uploaded  to  an  open-
access repository: Keynejad [25]) about the study, before 
inviting  them  to  give  written,  informed  consent.  After 
reading  the  information  sheet  or  having  it  read  aloud 
(if  unable  to  read),  participants  consented  by  signing  or 
making a thumbprint authorised by a secondary school-
educated, independent witness (if unable to write).

Ethical concerns

The  RA  ensured  that  women  understood  the  study  by 
providing  written  and  verbal  information  in  simple  lan-
guage  and  checking  their  understanding.  The  RA  was 
trained to identify verbal and non-verbal cues suggesting 

 Keynejad et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2023) 23:78 

Page 4 of 12

that  a  woman  might  not  feel  comfortable  with  or  inter-
ested  in  participating,  and  to  politely  cease  providing 
study information to such women. The information sheet 
explained that women’s responses would be anonymised 
but  excerpts  would  be  shared  with  others  and  used  to 
develop an intervention. The voluntary nature of partici-
pation  was  emphasised  throughout  and  could  be  with-
drawn at any time before writing up. This study received 
ethical approval from King’s College London Psychiatry, 
Nursing  and  Midwifery  Research  Ethics  Subcommittee 
(#HR-17/18–6063), and  Addis Ababa  University College 
of Health Sciences (#026/18/Psy).

Risk management

Interviews  followed  a  standard  operating  procedure 
(SOP; see 26) addressing researcher conduct and contact 
with  participants.  The  SOP  provided  guidance  on  how 
the  RA  should  respond  to  distress,  support  participants 
experiencing  IPV,  and  respond  to  any  risks  to  children 
and adults identified during interviews. The SOP guided 
the  RA  to  take  precautions  to  prevent  partners  learning 
about  a  woman’s  participation  (for  example,  reading  a 
leaflet she brought home), maintain confidentiality, seek 
consent to break confidentiality if required, and urgently 
discuss  concerns  with  a  nominated  clinical  contact  per-
son. The SOP included numbers for local services, to be 
provided  if  women  felt  safe  to  take  written  information 
home.

Interviewers

Recruitment, consent, and interviewing were conducted 
by  a  female,  master’s  degree-qualified  RA,  in  Amharic. 
We  trained  the  RA  using  WHO  clinical  and  policy 
guidelines  on  responding  to  IPV  [26].  The  RA  received 
regular  feedback  on  early  interviews,  on  responding  to 
verbal  cues,  and  exploring  unclear  points.  The  RA  kept 
field notes about interview interactions, which informed 
analysis.

Data collection and procedure

In-depth  interviews  were  conducted  in  a  private  health 
centre  room.  Interviewers  collected  basic  demographic 
information  and  followed  topic  guides,  which  were 
employed  flexibly  [25].  Topic  guides  addressed  relation-
ship  problems  and  violence  experienced  by  pregnant 
women, and perspectives on asking about mental health 
and IPV. Interviews also addressed participants’ perspec-
tives on a perinatal mental health intervention, which are 
reported in a separate study [27]. Participants were reim-
bursed 100 Ethiopian birr (£2.68), which was considered 
appropriate locally [28].

Data handling and protection

All  interviews  were  digitally  audio-recorded,  down-
loaded  onto  a  computer,  and  password-protected, 
before being emailed to experienced transcribers. Tran-
scribed,  password-protected  Amharic  interviews  were 
then emailed to translators, who emailed de-identified, 
translated interviews to the RA. Paper documents were 
stored in a locked cupboard.

Analysis

We  followed  the  six  phase  approach  to  thematic  anal-
ysis  [29].  First  author  RK  familiarised  herself  with  the 
data  by  reading  and  re-reading  transcripts  alongside 
field  notes,  noting  initial  ideas.  We  then  used  NVIVO 
[30]  to  systematically  code  the  dataset,  generating  ini-
tial  codes  and  collating  relevant  quotations.  Next,  we 
reviewed initial codes, gathered them into themes, and 
reviewed  themes  in  relation  to  constituent  quotations. 
We  refined  themes,  clarifying  names  and  definitions 
through abstraction and interpretation. In the explana-
tion phase, we referred back to our research questions 
while writing up.

Validation and reflexivity

For  triangulation  through  multiple  analysis  [21],  the 
research  team  worked  closely,  for  cross-cultural,  col-
laborative ‘sense-making’ [31]. RK selected a transcript 
from a pregnant woman and one from a health worker, 
which  were  particularly  rich  in  content.  AM  (inter-
viewer),  EF  (trial  coordinator),  and  TB  (post-doctoral 
researcher) independently familiarised themselves with 
the data and generated initial codes [29]). RK reviewed 
these  codes,  to  alter  or  elaborate  initial  codes.  We 
remained  reflexive  of  potential  differences  in  the  lived 
experiences of Ethiopian researchers and research par-
ticipants,  which  might  influence  our  interpretations. 
After  engaging  in  initial  explanation  by  sketching  out 
an  initial  diagram  displaying  relationships  between 
preliminary  themes,  RK  shared  her  analysis  with  AM, 
EF,  TB  and  CH  (a  UK  researcher  living  permanently 
in  Ethiopia),  before  online  coding  discussions,  which 
informed  iterative  revisions.  RK  used  reflexivity  to 
identify  personal  biases,  influenced  by  intersectional 
personal circumstances [32]. She used self-reflexivity of 
her  position  as  an  English-speaking,  female  researcher 
working in a high-income country where gender equal-
ity  is  advocated  but  not  always  achieved,  to  strive  for 
‘empathic neutrality’ in her interpretations [20].

We  did  not  pursue  respondent  validation  (‘member 
checking’)  of  our  interpretations.  Interviews  explored 
sensitive  subjects  and  there  was  potential  for  power 
imbalances  between  some  participants.  Respondent

validation  could  enable  more  vocal  respondents  to 
challenge  uncomfortable  interpretations,  which  accu-
rately represented lived realities [21].

We  remained  mindful  that  transcripts  were  English 
translations  of  conversations  in  Amharic.  We  recalled 
that  meaning  conveyed  through  spoken  language  incor-
porates  cultural  experiences  and  understandings  which 
cannot always be translated [33].

all  of  whom  were  female.  Median  age  was  26.5 years 
for women and 25 years for health workers. Interviews 
were  conducted  between  December  2018  and  Decem-

women) and 35 minutes (health workers).

Themes

Thematic analysis identified abusive experiences, patri-
archal norms, powerlessness, and emotional and bodily 
distress  as  themes.  Figure  1  displays  the  relationships

Theme 1: “He threatened to cut me into pieces” – intimate 
partner violence

Participants  (P:  pregnant  women,  HW:  health  workers) 
described a range of experiences that they considered to 
be abusive or reinforcing of abuse.

“He told me that no-one would help me” – abuse.
IPV was the most extensively elaborated subject across 
interviews.  Experiences  included  physical,  sexual,  psy-
chological  abuse,  and  coercive  control.  Women  men-
tioned the emotional impact of IPV infrequently, usually 
as a passing comment that “I feel bad” (P7, P9), or “I feel 
stressed”  (P7,  P16).  Some  health  workers  linked  IPV 
with  depression,  but  minimised  its  severity.  One  of  the 
most  experienced  health  workers  highlighted  inter-rela-
tionships  between  partners’  substance  use,  poverty,  and 
depression:

In  addition  to  her  being  physically  abused  by  her 
drunk  husband,  she  has  financial  constraints  … 
household  problems  and  she  is  responsible  to  raise 
the  children  too,  and  he  doesn’t  support  her...  His 
abuse  added  to  the  economic  problem  is  what

caused the depression.

HW1, HEW, 10–14 years’ experience.

Pregnant  women  and  health  workers  acknowledged 
that  some  women  were  at  risk  of  femicide  but  did  not 
discuss the emotional impact of experiencing life-threat-
ening  partner  violence.  One  woman  described  report-
ing  her  husband  to  the  police,  who  suggested  that  IPV 
and  even  femicide  were  justifiable  where  infidelity  was 
proven.  This  was  one  of  several  examples  of  IPV  being 
rationalised. Aggressive interactions with partners’ family 
members, and actions exacerbating or perpetuating IPV 
by women’s own relatives were also common. One preg-
nant  woman  described  how  her  mother-in-law  enabled 
IPV by giving her husband money for alcohol.

“He  will  feel  that  there  is  no  law”  –  ineffectual 

responses.

Participants described a hierarchy of responses to IPV, 
starting with their own and their partner’s family. When 
family  were  unable  to  help,  informal  help  was  sought 
from neighbours, village elders, or religious leaders. For-
mal support was sometimes sought from district women 
and child affairs offices, police, and, finally, the legal sys-
tem.  Women  described  how  authorities  enforced  incre-
mental pursuit of each step, creating a sense of impunity 
among perpetrators:

I  talked  to  his  family  …  They  took  the  issue  to  the 
[local office] … I went to the court … they told me to 
go  to  ‘female  and  youth  affairs’  …  she  told  me  that 
they  …  first  give  him  advice.  It  is  [later]  that  they 
will take him to court … If he gets advice … he will 
feel there is no law … [it] will not help at all.
P2, 30–34 years old.

Police  involvement  was  characterised  as  a  last  resort, 
but  only  provided  women  with  brief  separation  without 
consequences for the perpetrator. Women’s lack of finan-
cial  independence  made  prosecution  unfeasible,  rein-
forcing the implied futility of seeking help. Both recently 
qualified and experienced health workers expressed their 
powerlessness to safely respond to IPV:

In  rural  areas  like  this  one,  women  usually  have 
forced  sex  with  their  husbands  …  I  think  it  will  be 
another  problem  in  their  marriage  if  they  refuse  … 
It  is  difficult  for  me  to  propose  a  solution  …  [Hus-
bands] do that even when they are sober.
HW7, Midwife, 0–4 years’ experience.

Options  of  separation  and  divorce  were  mentioned, 
usually in hypothetical language. Barriers to leaving abu-
sive  partners  included  coercion  to  stay  or  return  by  vil-
lage elders, mediators, neighbours and friends.

Theme 2: “not... the end of the world if a husband beats his 
wife” – patriarchal norms.

Participants  described  how  perpetration  of  IPV  and 
other abuse was implicitly reinforced across society.

“They are dominated” – inequality.
Participants suggested underlying reasons for IPV, such 
as occupational inequality and gender unequal attitudes, 
including among women. Health workers described how 
gender  inequality  impacted  women’s  control  over  deci-
sions about marriage or healthcare (including contracep-
tion and termination of pregnancy). Several participants 
also stated that emasculation or men feeling undermined 
caused them to be violent:

He doesn’t want anyone to see him when he does the 
household chores... He advises the [children] or beats 
them up. He flogs them with his belt.
P5, 25–29 years old.

“Her husband should teach her to behave properly” – 
victim blaming.

The view that women’s behaviour may provoke IPV was 
common.  Some  participants  said  women  could  prevent 
IPV by not criticising their partner. Some justified IPV as 
an appropriate response to women accusing men of infi-
delity or arguing about money:

It will not be the end of the world if a husband beats 
his wife … [She] shouldn’t nag him about money … It 
is easy for women to make plans for fights when they 
are idle.
P10, 25–29 years old.

Participants  anticipated  community  judgement  for 
appearing to violate social norms of unity with one’s hus-
band.  Women  expressed  shame  about  people  knowing 
they were experiencing IPV, or admitting emotional dif-
ficulties and IPV to others. This made women reticent to 
“divulge secrets” to health workers, further compounding 
their  isolation.  Participants  emphasised  concerns  about 
confidentiality when accessing support, especially in rela-
tion to being gossiped about.

“They  are  not  conscious  when 

they  drink” 

– attribution.

IPV  was  commonly  attributed  to  situational  factors, 
such  as  men’s  alcohol  use,  rather  than  dispositional  fac-
tors.  Men  typically  drank  alcohol  after  earning  money 
from selling crops at market, provoking arguments about 
household  finances.  No  participants  explicitly  linked  a 
man’s  decision  to  drink  alcohol  with  his  responsibility 
for perpetrating IPV. Some participants minimised men’s 
responsibility  for  violence  while  intoxicated;  many  did 
not  question  the  imperative  to  drink  socially,  or  its  role 
in IPV:

He doesn’t want to distance himself from his friends 
…  He  acts  disruptively  only  when  he  comes  home 
drunk … he drinks whether he has money or not.
P9, 30–34 years old.

Participants  did  not  raise  the  possibility  that  some 
men  may  have  a  violent  disposition,  or  be  replicating 
behaviour  witnessed  between  their  own  parents  during 
childhood.

“She should be able to handle the situation wisely” 

– accommodation.

The  perception  that  it  was  women’s  responsibility  to 

manage their partner’s combativeness was common:

Women  could  exacerbate  the  problem  when  they 
fail to ignore their husbands … If a wife ignores her 
husband … he will stop... I think this will help her to 
avoid [conflict].
HW10, HEW, 10–14 years’ experience.

Women  were  often  advised  to  leave  their  partner’s 
immediate vicinity, for hours, days or weeks. Participants 
suggested that women should stay with neighbours, move 
rooms, or leave the home to temporarily avoid their part-
ner.  The  emotional  impact  of  regularly  accommodating 
IPV was sometimes implied, but not overtly expressed.

“I usually don’t ask them about that” – looking the 

other way.

Community members, health services, and authorities 
routinely  ignored,  rather  than  identified  and  addressed 
IPV.  Some  participants  minimised  the  acceptability  or 
likelihood of IPV during pregnancy, due to concerns for 
unborn  children,  or  women’s  vulnerability.  Some  HEWs 
and  midwives,  including  several  with  10  or  more  years’ 
experience,  reported  never,  or  infrequently,  treating 
women  experiencing  relationship  problems,  alongside 
idealistic statements about pregnancy and ANC. Several 
women  and  some  health  workers  said  asking  about  IPV 
would be acceptable, but does not happen. Lack of train-
ing was the primary reason given.

Theme 3: “She cannot do anything to protect herself” ‑ 
powerlessness

Abusive  treatment  and  its  reinforcement  by  perva-
sive  patriarchal  norms  left  women  feeling  powerless  to 
change their situation.

“If  I  take  my  children  …  it  will  be  very  difficult  for 

me” – entrapment.

Some  women  described  feeling  trapped  in  abusive 
relationships  because  of  concern  for  their  children, 
while others described children mediating between their 
parents.  Short  and  long-term  impacts  of  IPV  on  exist-
ing  children  were  rarely  mentioned.  Pregnancy  and  the 

welfare  of  existing  children  posed  barriers  to  women 
leaving  an  abusive  relationship.  Although  some  par-
ticipants  suggested  that  IPV  would  resolve  if  women 
ignored  abusive  partners,  others  described  it  worsening 
abuse. This form of entrapment highlighted how women 
received contradictory messages both encouraging asser-
tiveness and discouraging confrontation:

I pretend as if I didn’t see or hear what he did or said 
… He feels belittled when I don’t confront him when 
he  berates  me.  He  will  not  stop  lashing  out  …  if  I 
don’t confront him.
P16, 20–24 years old.

Participants did not describe any emotional impacts of 

women’s sense of entrapment.

“There is no way to escape” – hopelessness.
Hopelessness,  the  inevitability  of  death,  and  a  lack  of 
meaningful  options  were  commonly  expressed.  IPV  was 
often said to “have no solution”:

Even her child might be dead due to their conflict … 
There  is  no  way  to  escape…  Since  it  is  her  destiny, 
she will live with him ‘til the end of her life.
P3, 35–39 years old.

Some  women  expressed  the  inevitability  of  their  suf-
fering,  sometimes  in  de-humanising  terms  (“you  can  do 
whatever  you  like  with  me”  (P1)).  Occasionally,  women 
described  retaliating  physically,  indicating  a  hopeless 
disregard for their safety. Women described how shame, 
difficulty  verbalising  and  fear  of  exacerbating  IPV  made 
them  hopeless  about  disclosing  IPV  and  emotional 
difficulties:

I feel ashamed to speak to you because I am not edu-
cated like you … I just feel suffocated with fear.
P13, 25–29 years old.

Theme 4: “I don’t always feel happy … I feel sick” – emotional 
and bodily distress.

Participants elaborated on perinatal emotional difficulties 
much  less  extensively  than  IPV,  and  often  characterised 
distress in terms of, or alongside, physical symptoms.
“I am always anxious” – emotional difficulties.
Some  participants  raised  lack  of  knowledge  about 
perinatal  emotional  difficulties  as  a  barrier  to  disclosing 
symptoms to health workers. However, women reported 
anxiety,  stress,  and  depression,  which  they  attributed  to 
exhaustion, relationship conflict, unwanted pregnancies, 
or  to  no  reason.  Symptoms  raised  included  tearfulness, 
reduced  motivation,  poor  or  excessive  sleep  and  night-
mares, feeling numb, irritability, poor concentration, and 
rumination.  Two  women  described  suicidal  thoughts 

 Keynejad et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2023) 23:78

associated  with  shame  or  despair  about  current  or  past 
IPV:

I  sometimes  want  to  strangle  myself  to  death  … 
When  I  think  that  I  am  left  behind  [by  my  friends] 
… I have this idea of hurting myself … [Previously] I 
was hoping to die.
P14, 16–19 years old.

“I  go  to  the  health  facility  every  day”  –  physical 
symptoms.

Participants  associated  perinatal  emotional  difficul-
ties  with  adverse  obstetric  outcomes,  such  as  intrau-
terine  growth  restriction,  delivery  complications,  and 
stillbirth.  Persistent  perinatal  physical  symptoms  with-
out  identified  causes  were  commonly  described.  One 
health  worker  attributed  symptoms  to  stress  and  anxi-
ety,  managing  them  with  reassurance  after  ruling  out 
physical pathology. Another (HW3) described a woman 
with  “a  tendency  to  feel  dizzy  and  fall  down,  losing  her 
consciousness”  only  when  pregnant,  which  was  attrib-
uted  to  “getting  stressed  out”.  Some  women  were  pre-
occupied  with  physical  symptoms  and  their  perceived 
mechanisms:

I feel tired and there is a swelling around here, where 
my heart is … My neighbours … said that the umbil-
ical cord will wrap around the baby’s neck and choke 
it to death if I sleep like this.
P7, 30–34 years old.

Participants  did  not  link  persistent  perinatal  physical 

symptoms to experiencing IPV.

“Sadness has an impact on the baby” – responsibil-

ity for the unborn.

Women  perceived  themselves  to  be  responsible  for 
adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Worries about 
how emotional difficulties could impact their pregnancy 
included  miscarriage,  dying  in  childbirth,  coping  with  a 
new baby, and impacting the unborn:

A  mother’s  happiness  or  sadness  has  an  impact  on 
the baby … The baby is very small … I feel that the 
baby is suffering from my stress and grief.
P14, 16–19 years old.

Participants also described anxiety about physical and 
obstetric consequences of physical IPV. Adverse obstetric 
outcomes were attributed to distress caused by IPV, mak-
ing women still more anxious about the impact of anxiety 
on  their  unborn  child.  Participants  alluded  to  women’s 
distress in response to IPV impacting foetal well-being:

She  could  also  get  very  angry.  She  could  get  disap-
pointed. Since she is pregnant, her child also will get 
irritated in her womb.
P4, 23 years old.

Discussion
Our qualitative study in rural Ethiopia found that abusive 
experiences,  emotional  and  bodily  distress  were  com-
mon, and that pregnant women and health workers iden-
tified  important  relationships  between  them.  Contrary 
to  expectations  of  sensitivity,  participants  elaborated 
extensively on IPV. Emotional difficulties were discussed 
in  more  restricted  terms  than  IPV,  and  often  conceptu-
alised as part of wider bodily distress. Patriarchal norms 
explained  how  community  actions  in  response  to  IPV 
often  reinforced  women’s  experiences  of  abuse.  This  in 
turn created a sense of powerlessness to address IPV or 
change  their  situation  more  broadly,  exacerbating  wom-
en’s emotional and bodily distress.

Perinatal IPV

In  our  study,  IPV  was  reinforced  by  norms  and  experi-
ences at all levels of the integrated ecological framework 
[7].  Some  women  described  sporadic  instances  of  abuse 
which they perceived to be isolated events, often associ-
ated  with  their  partner  being  intoxicated  with  alcohol, 
interspersed  with  periods  of  positive  interaction.  These 
women often minimised their partner’s responsibility or 
the  severity  of  abuse.  Intermittent  reinforcement  within 
power-imbalanced  relationships  has  been  proposed  to 
foster  ‘traumatic  bonding’  [34].  Traumatic  bonding  may 
encourage women to return to abusive partners, because 
economic  and  legal  barriers  to  separation  are  com-
pounded by deprivation of the abusive attachment object.
Childhood  factors  associated  with  both  women’s  vic-
timisation  and  men’s  perpetration  of  IPV  in  the  revised 
ecological  model  [9],  such  as  witnessing  parental  IPV, 
were  not  mentioned.  This  was  despite  participants 
acknowledging that children were exposed to IPV in their 
own household, and evidence that childhood exposure is 
a risk factor for IPV perpetration in Ethiopia [35]. Previ-
ous research found that corporal punishment of children 
was  legally  and  culturally  acceptable  in  Ethiopia  [36], 
and  that  children’s  rights,  child  abuse,  and  child  protec-
tion were infrequently reported by Ethiopian media [37]. 
Future initiatives sensitising communities to IPV should 
therefore  also  address  impacts  of  abuse  on  children.  At 
the female partner level, women linked financial depend-
ence on their partners with IPV, as found by other quali-
tative studies from sub-Saharan Africa [38, 39].

Links  between  patriarchal  norms,  IPV,  emotional  dif-
ficulties, and cyclical community reinforcement of abuse 
supported  the  findings  of  the  global  ‘what  works’  pro-
gramme  [10].  Notably,  however,  participants  did  not 
mention  the  impact  of  armed  conflict,  despite  inter-
mittent  regional  unrest  in  Ethiopia.  Reasons  may  have 
included the sense that national and regional armed con-
flicts  were  not  of  direct  personal  relevance  to  women’s 

Keynejad et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2023) 23:78

lives,  the  chronic  nature  of  episodic  unrest  in  this  con-
text or, perhaps, failure to inquire about conflict outside 
the home in the topic guide. In terms of norms, IPV was 
often  justified  through  external  attribution  [40],  as  an 
appropriate  response  to  perceived  provocation.  This  is 
consistent  with  evidence  from  other  Ethiopian  studies, 
that  women  are  often  characterised  as  provoking  abuse 
(victim  blaming)  [13,  41].  Studies  from  Ethiopia  and 
other  sub-Saharan  African  countries  also  support  our 
findings that IPV was reinforced by a lack of community 
sanctions  [11,  42],  unequal  gender  norms  [17,  39,  43], 
and treating women as property [38, 39].

Community  norms  meant  that  women  were  expected 
to  adjust  their  behaviour  to  accommodate  IPV,  which 
is  consistent  with  findings  from  Ethiopia  [13]  and  other 
sub-Saharan African countries [38, 39, 43, 44]. Interviews 
highlighted  the  lack  of  substantial  legal  or  community 
repercussions  for  perpetrators  of  IPV,  as  reported  by 
other  qualitative  studies  with  women,  health  workers, 
and community stakeholders in Ethiopia [12, 14, 15].

In terms of neighbourhood factors, family involvement 
mirrored  abusive  intimate  relationship  dynamics,  com-
pounded by ineffectual responses, and coerced reconcili-
ation, as found in other qualitative studies in Ethiopia [12, 
14,  15].  At  the  macrosocial  level,  participants  described 
pervasive  gender  inequality,  consistent  with  Ethiopia’s 
low gender inequality index ranking [45].

Although  participants  mentioned  the  existence  of 
divorce  they  did  not  perceive  it  as  an  option  which  was 
realistic  or  attainable  for  women,  in  practice.  The  dif-
ficulty  of  separation  was  compounded  by  community 
action to return women to abusive partners, as reported 
by  other  Ethiopian  [11,  14]  and  sub-Saharan  African 
studies [38, 39, 42]. These findings support evidence that 
more  collectivist  societies  may  respond  differently  to 
IPV  than  individualistic  societies,  conserving  commu-
nity cohesion at the expense of the individual [9, 46]. Our 
findings  support  the  need  for  interventions  to  address 
IPV  at  all  levels  of  the  revised  ecological  framework, 
especially the often-neglected community and macroso-
cial factors.

Perinatal emotional difficulties

In keeping with a study of a different Ethiopian ANC set-
ting [15], we found that the impact of abuse on women’s 
mental well-being was identified infrequently. Emotional 
difficulties were often characterised as mild or transient, 
although  their  relationship  with  IPV  has  been  identified 
by other qualitative studies in this setting [17, 18], other 
regions  of  Ethiopia  [11],  and  other  sub-Saharan  African 
countries  [39,  42,  44].  Health  workers  focused  on  the 
impact  of  emotional  and  bodily  distress  on  the  preg-
nancy,  in  keeping  with  Ethiopian  evidence  that  ANC 

health  workers  considered  IPV-related  difficulties  out-
side their role [15]. This highlights the need for clinicians 
in ANC to be trained to ask about and respond, both to 
emotional difficulties and IPV in this context.

We  found  that  fear  of  community  judgement  for  per-
ceived  failure  to  comply  with  social  norms  exacerbated 
women’s  powerlessness,  emotional  and  bodily  distress. 
This was consistent with qualitative evidence that shame 
compounds  IPV  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  [42,  44].  Being 
gossiped about was a barrier to disclosure, making build-
ing  trust  and  confidentiality  an  important  priority  for 
intervention design.

Women  and  staff  often  expressed  powerlessness  to 
influence  IPV  or  change  their  broader  situation.  Amid 
pervasive  reinforcement  by  patriarchal  norms,  women’s 
powerlessness  led  to  feelings  of  entrapment  and  hope-
lessness:  potential  precursors  to  depression.  This  high-
lighted  the  importance  of  building  referral  pathways 
between  ANC  and  services  which  can  support  women 
experiencing IPV.

In Ethiopia, shame, humiliation, defeat or entrapment, 
fatalistic helplessness, and low self-efficacy in relation to 
an external locus of control were identified in relation to 
poverty  and  food  insecurity  [47].  The  authors  hypoth-
esised  that  these  processes  mediated  psychological 
distress. Deprivation was an auxiliary theme raised spon-
taneously by participants despite being outside the scope 
of our study. In very low-income communities, it may not 
be possible or appropriate to address emotional difficul-
ties  or  IPV  in  isolation;  a  syndemic  perspective  may  be 
more appropriate [48].

Several  participants  with  personal  experience  of  peri-
natal  emotional  difficulties  or  suicidal  ideation  associ-
ated  them  with  IPV,  consistent  with  Ethiopian  [17,  18] 
and other sub-Saharan African [49] qualitative research. 
However,  symptoms  of  bodily  distress  were  raised  more 
often than emotions, highlighting the importance of tai-
loring interventions to women’s explanatory models and 
idioms of distress .

Community  expectations  that  women  should  accom-
modate  IPV  was  linked  to  self-blame,  low  self-esteem, 
and  depressive  symptoms  among  some  participants, 
exacerbating  their  sense  of  powerlessness  still  further 
[34].  Victim  blaming,  by  attributing  responsibility  for 
IPV  to  women’s  perceived  deficiencies,  may  also  induce 
internal  attribution  [40].  Internal  attribution  to  unsta-
ble  factors  (such  as  ‘provoking’  IPV)  is  associated  with 
self-blame,  tolerating  abuse,  and  reduced  likelihood  of 
leaving.  Internal  attribution  to  stable  factors  (such  as 
one’s character) is associated with low self-esteem, hope-
lessness  and  helplessness,  increasing  risks  of  depres-
sion  [40].  These  findings  highlight  the  need  for  mental 
health  interventions  to  be  delivered  sensitively,  to  avoid 

 Keynejad et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2023) 23:78

compounding  self-blame,  and  to  strengthen  women’s 
self-efficacy.

Strengths

No  previous  studies  have  used  qualitative  methods  to 
explore the relationship between pregnant women’s men-
tal  health  and  experiences  of  IPV  in  Ethiopia  in  depth. 
The  existing  qualitative  literature  on  perinatal  mental 
health  in  Ethiopia  predominantly  used  focus  group  dis-
cussion  methods.  Our  comparatively  large  sample  of 
in-depth  interviews  with  a  diverse  sample  of  pregnant 
women  and  health  workers  of  varied  age,  religion,  and 
years  of  experience,  overcame  the  limitations  of  groups, 
such as capturing socially desirable responses, neglecting 
personal perspectives, and divergent viewpoints.

Limitations

The identification of some potentially eligible participants 
based on health workers’ knowledge of their circumstances 
could  have  over-sampled  women  experiencing  particu-
larly  visible  or  recurrent  IPV.  However,  we  also  recruited 
participants  disclosing  a  range  of  relationship  difficulties 
on  an  ANC  survey.  We  analysed  interview  transcripts  as 
English  translations,  rather  than  in  Amharic.  We  miti-
gated for this by attention to our own positionality through 
reflexivity, and thematic analysis by male and female Ethio-
pian researchers. Due to the paucity of studies focused on 
women’s perspectives, we did not interview men or other 
stakeholders. Exploring the experiences of a sub-sample of 
participants’ partners could have enhanced interpretation 
of our findings but could have posed safety risks.

Conclusions
Although  participants  were  familiar  with  IPV  and  peri-
natal  emotional  difficulties  experienced  by  women  in 
this  rural  Ethiopian  context,  they  did  not  consistently 
draw links between the two. Our study demonstrated the 
importance  of  IPV  to  emotional  difficulties  experienced 
by women in rural Ethiopia during the perinatal period, 
and  the  need  for  mental  health  interventions  to  address 
the  ways  that  IPV  impacts  women  at  different  levels  of 
the revised ecological framework.
