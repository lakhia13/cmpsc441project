Abstract

Background: Resistant bipolar disorder is a major mental health problem related to significant disability and overall cost. 
The aim of the current study was to perform a systematic review of the literature concerning (1) the definition of treatment 
resistance in bipolar disorder, (2) its clinical and (3) neurobiological correlates, and (4) the evidence-based treatment options 
for treatment-resistant bipolar disorder and for eventually developing guidelines for the treatment of this condition
Materials and Methods: The PRISMA method was used to identify all published papers relevant to the definition of treatment 
resistance in bipolar disorder and the associated evidence-based treatment options. The MEDLINE was searched to April 22, 2018.
Results: Criteria were developed for the identification of resistance in bipolar disorder concerning all phases. The search of the 
literature identified all published studies concerning treatment options. The data were classified according to strength, and 
separate guidelines regarding resistant acute mania, acute bipolar depression, and the maintenance phase were developed.
Discussion: The definition of resistance in bipolar disorder is by itself difficult due to the complexity of the clinical picture, 
course, and treatment options. The current guidelines are the first, to our knowledge, developed specifically for the treatment 
of resistant bipolar disorder patients, and they also include an operationalized definition of treatment resistance. They were 
based on a thorough and deep search of the literature and utilize as much as possible an evidence-based approach.

Keywords:   treatment resistant, refractoriness, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, bipolar disorder, evidence-
based guidelines, lithium, mania, mood stabilizers, treatment

Introduction

Aim of the Current Study 

Bipolar  disorder  (BD)  has  been  described  since  the  times  of 
Hippocrates  and  Areteus,  but  recently  the  subtypes  BD-I  and 
BD-II were proposed with a combined prevalence rate of up to 
2.4% (Merikangas et al., 2011). The treatment of BD is probably 
the  most  challenging  of  all  mental  disorders  with  the  unique 
characteristic that each phase needs a different treatment ap-
proach (Vieta and Goikolea, 2005).

Such  complex  mental  disorders  are  those  that  are  ex-
pected to benefit more by the development of treatment guide-
lines, which during the last few decades are becoming an ever 
more important part of medical reality. This is especially since 
the  translation  of  research  findings  to  everyday  clinical  prac-
tice  is  becoming  increasingly  difficult  with  the  accumulation 
of  complex  and  often  conflicting  research  findings,  which  are 
thereafter  also  included  in  meta-analysis.  Guidelines  aim  to 
assist  clinicians  but  also  policymakers  to  arrive  at  decisions 
concerning  the  treatment  and  care  of  patients.  They  set  the 
standard of care and training for health professionals, and they 
identify priority areas for further research since they are based 
primarily on the available evidence, but also, in areas where evi-
dence is not available, on expert opinion.

The 

literature  suggests  that  depression  rather  than 
mania  is  the  most  challenging  phase  (Manning,  2005).  If 
subsyndromal,  the  presence  of  residual  symptoms  impose  a 
greater  risk  of  relapse  (Keller  et  al.,  1992),  greater  disability, 
and poorer overall outcome (Tohen et al., 1990a,  1990b, 2006). 
Therefore, full remission and recovery should be the ultimate 
treatment goal. A significant proportion of patients, however, 
do not fully respond to treatment, and their long-term course 
is characterized by frequent relapses and residual symptoms, 
causing significant disability and functional impairment (Esan 
et al., 2017).

To  fulfil  this  need  for  expert  translation  of  research  find-
ings into clinical practice and for the benefit of patients, the 
International  College  of  Neuropsychopharmacology  (CINP) 
launched  an  effort  to  critically  appraise  the  literature  and 
provide guidance to clinicians in the form of a treatment algo-
rithm and guidelines as precise as the data allow. It is hoped 
that they will help the clinician to follow the state-of-the-art 
evidence,  thus  enabling  their  clinical  practice  to  be  based 
on  informed  decision-making  process. They  have  been  com-
missioned  by  the  CINP,  and  the  working  group  consisted  of 
experts  with  extensive  research  and  clinical  experience  in 
the  field  of  BD.  There  was  no  funding  from  any  source  for 
the  development  of  the  guidelines  and  the  activities  of  the 
working group.

All  the  members  of  the  working  group  were  psychiat-
rists who are in active clinical practice and were selected ac-
cording  to  their  expertise  with  the  aim  to  cover  a  multitude 
of  different  cultures.  All  of  them  were  involved  in  research 
and  other  academic  activities,  and  therefore  it  is  possible 
that through such activities some contributors have received 
income  related  to  medicines  discussed  in  this  guideline. All 
conflicts  of  interest  are  mentioned  at  the  end  of  this  paper, 
which is the introductory paper to the CINP BD guidelines. It 
should  also  be  noted  that  some  drugs  recommended  in  the 
guideline  may  not  be  available  in  all  countries,  and  labeling 
and dosing might vary.

This  project  has  already  developed  treatment  algorithms 
and  guidelines  for  BD  (Fountoulakis  et  al.,  2017a,  2017b,  2017c, 
2017d), and the next step would be to search for data in the area 
of BD resistant to treatment.

The  aim  of  the  current  study  was  to  perform  a  PRISMA  sys-
tematic review of the literature concerning (1) the definition of 
treatment resistance in BD, (2) its clinical and (3) neurobiological 
correlates,  and  (4)  the  evidence-based  treatment  options  for 
treatment-resistant BD.

Materials and Methods

The PRISMA method (Hopewell et al., 2008; Liberati et al., 2009; 
Moher et al., 2009) was followed in the search of the literature. 
We  searched  MEDLINE  to April  22,  2018  with  the  combination 
of  keywords  “refractory”  or  “refractoriness”  or  “resistant”  with 
“mania,”  “manic,”  “bipolar,”  “manic-depressive,”  or  “manic-
depression.” The PRISMA flowchart is shown in Figure 1.
The following inclusion criteria were utilized:

  1.  Papers in English language
  2.  Papers  reporting  specifically  on  BD,  not  on  affective  
disorders  in  general.  If  the  paper  concerned  affective  
disorders  in  general  then  there  should  be  a  specific  
elaboration on BD.

  3.  Concerning  the  definition  of  treatment  resistance  in  BD: 
any paper that included a description or any kind of defin-
ition.

  4.  Papers considering resistant bipolar depression on the basis 
of  failure  of  antidepressant  treatment  were  not  included. 
An exception was made for those specific antidepressants 
with a proven efficacy in the treatment of BD according to 
the CINP Bipolar Disorder Treatment Guidelines.

  5.  For  clinical  and  neurobiological  correlates  we  considered 

only papers with original data.

  6.  Concerning  treatment  options,  all  papers  with  original 
data,  systematic  reviews,  and  meta-analyses  as  well  as 
post-hoc analyses were included.

  7.  Case reports and case series (including retrospective chart 
reviews) were not included (either referenced as such or ac-
cording to the author’s judgement).

Relevant  review  papers  were  scanned  to  locate  additional 
studies  (Poon  et  al.,  2012;  Hui  Poon  et  al.,  2015;  Fountoulakis 
et al., 2017a; Grunze et al., 2018). The data concerning the treat-
ment of resistant BD were ranked according to the method pre-
viously developed by the authors (Fountoulakis et al., 2017d) and 
shown in Table 1.

Results

Definitions of Treatment Resistance in BD (n = 37)

There are several approaches to define “response,” “remission,” 
“recovery,”  “relapse,”  and  “recurrence”  in  mental  disorders. 
Although  these  definitions  have  been  used  in  observational 
studies  (Tohen  et  al.,  1990a,  1990b,  2003a,  2003b),  a  common 
starting point is that these definitions apply to patients who re-
ceived treatment with an adequate dosage of an effective treat-
ment modality for a sufficient duration of time. Patients unable 
to  tolerate  such  an  adequate  therapeutic  trial  for  any  reason 
as  well  as  noncompliant  patients  are  usually  considered  as 
“pseudorefractory” (Table 2).

Some  authors  suggest  that  the  basis  is  an  inadequate  re-
sponse  to  a  therapeutic  trial  of  lithium  or  an  inability  to  tol-
erate  lithium’s  side  effects  (Barton  and  Gitlin,  1987;  Aronson

Calabrese et al., 1999; Green et al., 2000). Others consider a dif-
ferent  definition  on  the  basis  of  nonresponse  to  carbamaze-
pine (Kramlinger and Post, 1989; Bauer, 1990; Schaff et al., 1993) 
or  valproate  (Calabrese  et  al.,  1999),  and  their  definition  of 
failure also included intolerance. A more restrictive definition 
of treatment resistance demands failure to respond to at least 

2  agents  (McElroy  et  al.,  1991;  Kimmel  et  al.,  1994;  Calabrese 
et  al.,  1996),  while  other  authors  defined  wider  degrees  of 
treatment nonresponse (tertiary resistance) (Vieta et al., 1998; 
Ciapparelli  et  al.,  2000;  Green  et  al.,  2000;  Suppes  et  al.,  2003; 
Sajatovic et al., 2006).

Table 1.  Summary of the method for grading data and recommendation on the basis of both efficacy and safety/tolerability

Grading on basis of efficacy

Level 1

Level 2

Good research-based evidence, supported by at least 2 placebo controlled studies of sufficient magnitude and good 

quality. In case of the presence of negative RCTs, positive RCTs should outnumber negative ones

Fair research-based evidence, from 1 randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial  
Also in case 1 or more trials exist, however, they fail to fulfil all the criteria above (e.g., very small sample size or no 

placebo control) as well as in case of positive meta-analysis alone

Level 3
Level 4
Level 5
Grading on the basis of safety and tolerability
Level 1

Some evidence from comparative studies without placebo arm or from post-hoc analyses
Inconclusive data or poor-quality RCTs
Negative data

Very good tolerability, few side effects that are not enduring, do not cause significant distress, and are not life-

Level 2

Moderate tolerability, many side effects that could be enduring, and cause significant distress but are not life-

threatening and do not compromise the overall somatic health of patient

threatening, although they could compromise the overall somatic health of the patient  

Agents with very good overall tolerability but with rare life-threatening adverse events, could be classified here only 

if the lethality risk can be essentially considered to be negligible with application of procedures and protocols (e.g., 
laboratory testing, titration schedules, etc.)

Level 3

Poor tolerability, many side effects that are enduring, cause significant distress, compromise the overall somatic 

health of patient, or are life-threatening  

Agents with moderate overall tolerability and rare, life-threatening adverse events should be classified here even in 

case the lethality risk can be essentially considered to be negligible with the application of procedures and protocols 
(e.g., laboratory testing, titration schedules, etc.)

Table  2.  Issues  to  be  addressed  in  order  to  label  a  patient  as  
“resistant”

1.  Correct diagnosis
2.  Disorder not secondary to an organic disorder
3.   Poor response to treatment not due to somatic or mental 

comorbidity

4.   Poor response to treatment not due to a somatic condition that 
might not constitute a disorder by itself (e.g., genetic factors, 
smoking, alcohol use, gender, race, etc.)
5.  Failure of therapy not due to nontolerability
6.   Patient complies with recommended treatment and poor 

response not a consequence of lack of adherence 

anticonvulsant, etc.) for at least 6 weeks on each agent in the ab-
sence of antidepressants or other mood-elevating agents (Sachs, 
1996).  For  resistant  bipolar  depression,  an  extrapolation  of  the 
definition  for  unipolar  to  bipolar  depression  would  be  appro-
priate,  which  means  no  remission  despite  2  adequate  trials  of 
standard antidepressant agents (6 weeks each), with or without 
augmentation  strategies  (Sachs,  1996).  However,  this  definition 
is  currently  not  supported  by  the  data  in  a  fundamental  way 
since  antidepressants  are  not  considered  to  be  efficacious  in 
the  treatment  of  bipolar  depression,  although  they  are  among 
the  most  commonly  used  agents  (Baek  et  al.,  2014;  Bjorklund 
et al., 2016; Kessing et al., 2016). Treatment-resistant mood cyc-
ling (resistance in the long term) was defined as continued cyc-
ling  despite  maximal  tolerated  lithium  in  combination  with 
valproate or carbamazepine for a period of 3 times the average 
cycle length, or 6 months, whichever is longer, in the absence of 
antidepressants or  other cycle-promoting agents (Sachs,  1996). 

This definition is not in accord with the data concerning the ef-
ficacious treatment of these conditions (Sachs, 1996).

The only attempt to grade treatment resistance of a stratified 
response/refractoriness  graduation  suggested  the  clustering  of 
resistant cases into 3 groups: (1) primary resistance, that is, inad-
equate response to a therapeutic trial of lithium (>0.7 mmol/L), 
valproate,  or  carbamazepine;  (2)  secondary  resistance,  that  is, 
inadequate response to sequential therapeutic trials of 2 mood 
stabilizers  or  an  antipsychotic  and  a  mood  stabilizer;  and  (3) 
tertiary  resistance,  that  is,  inadequate  response  to  sequential 
therapeutic trials of 3 agents: any antipsychotics, 2 mood stabil-
izers and an antipsychotic, 2 antipsychotics and a mood stabil-
izer, or 3 mood stabilizers (Keck and McElroy, 2001).

Another  definition  was  based  on  the  assumption  that 
lithium  at  serum  levels  of  0.8  mmol/L  or  greater  for  at  least  6 
weeks  should  be  the  first  line  of  treatment  for  bipolar  depres-
sion if a patient is not already on a mood stabilizer and if lithium 
fails,  the  addition  of  lamotrigine,  carbamazepine,  valproate, 
antidepressants  (not  tricyclic  antidepressants),  or  an  atypical 
antipsychotic such as olanzapine might be a reasonable second-
line options (Yatham et al., 2003a; Tohen et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 
2014). This is in partial agreement with the data currently avail-
able. In the STEP-BD study, treatment-resistant depression was 
defined as no response to treatment after 12 weeks of treatment 
or  a  well-documented  failure  to  respond  to  at  least  2  trials  of 
antidepressants  or  an  antidepressant  and  a  mood  stabilizer 
(Nierenberg et al., 2006).

A more sophisticated 4-level system for the staging of resist-
ance  from  resistance  to  a  single  agent  to  resistant  to  3  agents 
plus neurostimulation has  been  proposed,  but its  clinical rele-
vance  is  unclear  since  it  puts  the  emphasis  on  the  number  of

treatment  options  used  but  ignores  other  important  details, 
including  duration.  It  includes  the  following  stages:  Stage  I: 
failed  monotherapy  trial  of  lithium,  anticonvulsant,  or  atyp-
ical  antipsychotic  of  adequate  dose  and  for  adequate  dur-
ation (FDA-approved treatment based on mood episode); Stage 
II:  Stage  I  plus  failed  trial  of  combination  of  2  medications, 
lithium, or anticonvulsant and atypical antipsychotic; Stage III: 
Stage II plus failed trial of several different evidence-based ad-
junctive  pharmacological  compounds;  and  Stage  IV:  Stage  III 
plus  neurostimulation  (Gajwani,  2009).  Resistant  BD-I  or  BD-II 
depression was defined in a stepped way as failure to reach re-
mission with adequately dosed lithium (0.8 mEq/L) or to other 
adequate ongoing mood-stabilizing treatment, plus lamotrigine 
(50–200 mg/d) or with full dose (600 mg/d or more) of quetiapine 
as monotherapy (Pacchiarotti et al., 2009)

To  date,  the  International  Society  for  Bipolar  Disorders  no-
menclature and definitions are the most comprehensive and up 
to date and utilize both a syndromal (on the basis of DSM cri-
teria) and symptomatic (on the basis of rating scales) approach. 
These definitions recommend the use of incremental steps for 
symptom  improvement  (<25%,  25–49%,  50–74%,  75–100%)  to 
define  response.  They  propose  multiple  cut-off  points  for  the 
definition  of  remission,  with  the  most  stringent  being  <6  for 
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)-17 and Montgomery-
Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and <5 for the Young 
Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) in the case of depression and mania, 
respectively.  These  stringent  criteria  allow  for  inclusion  of 

subsyndromal  states  that  are  very  important  for  failing  func-
tional  recovery  in  BD  (7–14  in  HDRS  or  MADRS  and  8–14  in 
YMRS).  In  essence,  the  definition  of  subsyndromal  states  is 
utilized also for the definition of Treatment Emergent Affective 
Switch. Non-criterion symptoms that are commonly associated 
with BD (usually during the depressive phase) such as anxiety, 
panic attacks, irritability, hopelessness, avoidance, or cognitive 
dysfunction should not be included in the definitions. These au-
thors defined “recovery” as sustained remission after at least 8 
weeks  (Tohen  et  al.,  2009),  which  is  similar  to  the  approach  of 
the  AMA  (American  Psychiatric  Association,  2000).  A  modified 
version was proposed several years later (Fountoulakis, 2012).

Another  proposal  was  that  treatment-resistant  BD  should 
be  conceptualized  as  failure  to  respond  to  at  least  2  trials  of 
dissimilar  medication  with  presumably  adequate  doses  and 
durations within a specific phase of bipolar illness (manic, de-
pressive,  or  mixed)  or  for  “breakthrough”;  symptoms.  These 
symptoms should emerge despite previous apparently effective 
maintenance treatment. There do not refer to patients who are 
intolerant (In table 4, the grading of treatment options according 
to safety issues is shown) of a treatment regimen and because of 
this they refrain from treatment and also to the extent possible, 
they do not refer to those patients who are not adherent to re-
commended treatment (Poon et al., 2012).

Τhe  most  recent  attempt  was  to  define  treatment  resistance 
in terms of failure to reach sustained symptomatic remission for 
8 consecutive weeks after 2 different treatment trials, at adequate

therapeutic  doses,  with  at  least  2  recommended  monotherapy 
treatments or at least 1 monotherapy treatment and another com-
bination treatment. It also introduced the term “multi-treatment-
resistant BD” after failure of additional trials with at least 1 trial 
with an antidepressant, a psychological treatment, and a course of 
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (Hidalgo-Mazzei et al., 2019).

Considering  the  above,  the  International  Society  for  Bipolar 
Disorders definition is a good starting point, but the authors sug-
gest that additional considerations are necessary. The key points 
the therapist needs to consider before suggesting a patient might 
be treatment-resistant are summarized in Table 2. The proposed 
CINP definitions of response, remission, recovery, and resistance 
for BD are shown in Table 3. According to the authors of the cur-
rent paper, a key issue is that nonresponse should be considered 
only after treatment according to the best evidence available. At 
this time, the options recommended by the CINP guidelines for BD 
(Fountoulakis et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2017c, 2017d) and the CANMAT 
Guidelines (Yatham et al., 2018) provide the most up-to-date and 
comprehensive overview of treatment options.

Clinical Correlates of Treatment Resistance (n = 19)

A  number  of  studies  suggest  that  some  kind  of  progression 
occurs  over  the  long-term  course  of  the  illness,  and  this,  in 
turn,  contributes  to  treatment  resistance  (Berk  et  al.,  2011b; 
Fries  et  al.,  2012)  with  an  association  to  number  of  mood  epi-
sodes (Swann et al., 1999; Obrocea et al., 2002; Scott et al., 2006; 
Reinares et al., 2010; Berk et al., 2011a; da Costa et al., 2016) and 
hospitalizations (Nunez et al., 2018). This progression is not uni-
form (Swann et al., 1999; Scott et al., 2006).

Clinical  characteristics  of  treatment-resistant  patients 
are  the  frequent  presence  of  rapid  cycling  (37%),  other  forms 
of  cycling  (32%),  chronic  depression  (26%),  mixed  states  (6%)  
(Cole et al., 1993), and anxiety (Wooderson et al., 2014; Parker and 
Graham,  2017;  Nunez  et  al.,  2018).  Other  features  include  mel-
ancholia,  comorbidity  with  social  phobia,  current  suicidal  risk 
and severe intensity of current depressive episode (Mendlewicz 
et al., 2010), cognitive difficulties, and sleep disturbance (Kessler 
et al., 2013; Wooderson et al., 2014). However, some studies failed 
to identify such clinical markers of resistance (Vo and Dunner, 
2003; Amsterdam et al., 2016a; Sandu et al., 2017)

Other  features  that  might  distinguish  between  resistant 
and  nonresistant  BD  include  being  female,  older,  older  age  at 
illness  onset,  a  higher  incidences  of  family  depression,  lower 
likelihood of being gainfully employed, a higher number of life-
time  stressors,  medical  conditions,  a  different  personality  and 
temperament profile, and more regular use of benzodiazepines 
(Parker and Graham, 2017). It is believed that substance use and 
unhealthy lifestyle might contribute to treatment resistance, al-
though data are lacking (Schaffer et al., 2017).

It  is  important  that  those  clinical  variables  with  supposed 
value in predicting response or resistance to lithium treatment 
and  including  the  presence  of  elation,  grandiosity,  paranoia, 
irritability,  delusions,  and  hallucinations  did  not  predict  treat-
ment response to lithium (Miller et al., 1991).

Overall, the data are of low quality and it is unknown whether 

the clinical picture is useful in predicting treatment response.

Neurobiological Correlates of Treatment Resistance (n = 3)

Only  3  studies  reported  on  possible  neurobiological  correl-
ations  of  treatment  resistance  and  identified  family  history  of 
affective  disorder  (Cole  et  al.,  1993;  Parker  and  Graham,  2017) 
and  electroencephalographic  abnormalities  (Cole  et  al.,  1993) 
as risk factors, while neuroinflammation mechanisms seem to 
promote  the  progression  towards  treatment  resistance  (Bauer 
et al., 2017)

Treatment of Resistant BD 

Resistant Acute Mania (n = 62)

Double Blind Studies in the Treatment of Resistant Acute Mania (n = 26)
Valproate monotherapy (serum levels 50 and 100 mg/L), in 36 lithium-
resistant manic patients (including patients who could not tolerate 
lithium), produced a 54% decrease in scores on the YMRS in the val-
proate arm vs a 5% decrease in the placebo arm (Pope et al., 1991)

In  1  underpowered  study,  13  BD-I  and  15  BD-II  patients  re-
ceived  900–4800  mg/d  gabapentin,  lamotrigine,  or  placebo  in 
a  crossover  design  for  6  weeks,  and  at  endpoint  there  was  no 
difference  between  the  3  arms  (Frye  et  al.,  2000).  In  another 
study,  114  BD-I  outpatients  resistant  to  lithium,  valproate,  or 
their  combination  were  randomized  to  adjunctive  gabapentin 
(600–3600 mg/d) or placebo for up to 10 weeks, with placebo per-
forming better (Pande et al., 2000).

There  are  positive  data  on  add-on  phenytoin  in  patients 
resistant  to  haloperidol  treatment  (Mishory  et  al.,  2000)  and 
of  add-on  600–1200  mg/d  carbamazepine  or  oxcarbazepine  in 
patients  resistant  to  lithium  (Juruena  et  al.,  2009). The  second 
study was of poor quality. A study adding lovastatin to lithium 
was negative (Ghanizadeh et al., 2014).

In patients resistant to lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine, 
it  is  beneficial  to  add  olanzapine,  quetiapine,  aripiprazole,  or 
asenapine (Tohen et al., 2002; Sachs et al., 2004; Yatham et al., 
2007b; Vieta et al., 2008; Szegedi et al., 2012) but not ziprasidone, 
topiramate,  or  paliperidone  (Roy  Chengappa  et  al.,  2006; 

Fountoulakis et al. 

|  237

Berwaerts et al., 2011; Sachs et al., 2012a, 2012b). For patients re-
sistant to both lithium and carbamazepine monotherapy, their 
combination  was  reported  to  be  beneficial  (at  dosages  corres-
ponding to lithium levels 0.7–1.2 mmol/L and up to 1600 mg/d of 
carbamazepine) (Kramlinger and Post, 1989).

One  study  provided  inconclusive  data  for  risperidone 
(Yatham et al., 2003b) as the results were likely confounded by 
the effects of carbamazepine on serum levels of risperidone.

There was only 1 sham-controlled trial of ECT as adjunctive 
treatment to chlorpromazine (600 mg/d) in 30 acutely manic pa-
tients  and  supported  the  efficacy  of  ECT  with  a  faster  rate  of 
improvement (Sikdar et al., 1994).

One  placebo-controlled  4-week  random  controlled  trial  in 
180  acutely  manic  patients  supported  the  efficacy  and  safety 
of  allopurinol  (600  mg/d)  and  dipyridamole  (200  mg/d)  as  ad-
junctive  to  lithium  (Machado-Vieira  et  al.,  2008).  However,  a 
previous  study  was  negative  in  patients  resistant  to  lithium, 
valproic acid, carbamazepine, or atypical antipsychotic medica-
tions  (Fan  et  al.,  2012).  Findings  for  valproate  are  inconclusive 
(Fan et al., 2012; Jahangard et al., 2014).

Folic  acid  was  reported  useful  as  an  adjunct  to  valproate; 
however,  the  study  is  problematic  concerning  its  methods 
of  analysis  and  the  reporting  of  results  (Behzadi  et  al.,  2009). 
Valnoctamide  (the  valproic  acid  precursor)  plus  risperidone 
combination was more effective than risperidone plus placebo 
(Bersudsky et al., 2010), while a pilot 8-week study in 21 acutely 
manic  outpatients  on  the  usefulness  of  adjunctive  ramelteon 
states  failed  (McElroy  et  al.,  2011)  and  another  2  on  donepezil 
were negative (Eden Evins et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013).

Open Label Studies in the Treatment of Resistant Acute Mania (n = 23)
Treating  resistant  manic  patients  with  olanzapine  5–40  mg/d 
monotherapy resulted in remission in three-quarters of patients 
(McElroy et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2011), and several small studies 
support  the  efficacy  of  up  to  550  mg/d  clozapine  with  three-
quarters  of  the  patients  responding  after  prolonged  treatment 
(Kimmel  et  al.,  1994;  Calabrese  et  al.,  1996;  Ciapparelli  et  al., 
2000;  Green  et  al.,  2000). The  combination  of  aripiprazole  with 
clozapine in BD patients that failed to respond to other atypical 
antipsychotics returned a positive result in psychotic manic pa-
tients (Benedetti et al., 2010). Results concerning risperidone are 
equivocal (Sajatovic et al., 1996; Vieta et al., 1998)

Adding gabapentin or pregabalin (600–3600 mg/d) resulted in 
response in three-quarters of resistant manic patients (McElroy 
et al., 1997; Altshuler et al., 1999; Schaffer et al., 2013). Only one-
quarter  of  rapid  cycling  patients  responded  (Altshuler  et  al., 
1999). Adding  100–300  mg/d  topiramate  resulted  in  a  response 
rate  of  almost  60%  (Chengappa  et  al.,  1999; Vieta  et  al.,  2002b) 
but  titrating  up  to  1300  mg/d  did  not  increase  the  response 
(Calabrese et al., 2001). Adding leviracetam (500–1000 mg/d) pro-
duced response or remission in one-half of patients (Post et al., 
2005); data concerning verapamil (up to 240 mg/d) were negative 
(Barton and Gitlin, 1987) while for nifedipine 120 mg/d were un-
impressive (De Beaurepaire, 1992). Some positive findings exist 
for diltiazem (Silverstone and Birkett, 2000). Adding l-thyroxine 
to  lithium  or  carbamazepine  resulted  in  a  50%  response  rate 
(Bauer and Whybrow, 1990).

Three-quarters  of  resistant  manic  patients  respond  to  ECT 
(Perugi et al., 2017) with equal efficacy for unilateral vs bilateral 
ECT (Mukherjee et al., 1988), and bifrontal ECT was as efficacious 
as bitemporal ECT and better tolerated (Barekatain et al., 2008; 
Hiremani et al., 2008).

Meta-Analytic and Review Studies in the Treatment of Resistant Acute 
Mania (n = 13)

Meta-analytic studies also suggest that combination treatment 
is superior to monotherapy at the cost of more frequent adverse 
events;  however,  these  meta-analyses  do  not  distinguish  be-
tween add-on studies (which utilize patients resistant to mono-
therapy) and combination studies (which utilize general patient 
populations)  (Scherk  et  al.,  2007;  Smith  et  al.,  2007; Tarr  et  al., 
2011; Ogawa et al., 2014). Due to the insufficient evidence base, 
earlier reviews provide only vague conclusions (Gitlin, 2001, 2006; 
Keck and McElroy, 2001). Overall, there is a striking paucity of re-
search concerning resistant cases, and existing studies are small 
and  insufficiently  controlled  and  findings  remain  preliminary. 
ECT is generally considered as an option for resistant patients. 
In acute manic patients who are partial responders to lithium/
valproate/carbamazepine, adding an antipsychotic is a reason-
able  choice. Encouraging results have been reported by  adding 
aripiprazole,  clozapine,  and  pregabalin  in  resistant  mania  (Hui 
Poon et al., 2015). The analysis of the data for the cholinesterase 
inhibitors galantamine and donepezil as well as the glutamate 
receptor  antagonist  memantine  was  negative  (Veronese  et  al., 
2016).  One  meta-analysis  of  combination  studies  confirmed 
the higher rate of adverse events compared with monotherapy 
(Galling et al., 2015). One review of open studies supported the 
usefulness of clozapine (Li et al., 2015).

There are a few randomized controlled trials of ECT in mania, 
and they consistently report clinically meaningful efficacy, with 
a majority of pharmacotherapy-resistant patients responding to 
ECT.  Evidence  for  the  use  of  other  brain  stimulation  therapies 
in treating bipolar mood states is preliminary and limited (Loo 
et al., 2011; Versiani et al., 2011).

Conclusion Concerning the Treatment of Resistant Acute Mania
Controlled data suggest that in patients resistant (principally) 
to lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine, it is beneficial to add 
aripiprazole, asenapine, folic acid, quetiapine, or valnoctamide. 
The  next  choice  should  be  adding  haloperidol,  olanzapine,  or 
phenytoin  on  lithium,  valproate,  or  carbamazepine. The  data 
are  inconclusive  concerning  allopurinol,  carbamazepine,  clo-
zapine,  ECT,  leviracetam,  l-thyroxine,  oxcarbazepine,  and 
pregabalin.

In bipolar depressed patients who experience depression while 
under  lithium  treatment,  it  is  appropriate  to  add  lamotrigine 
(van  der  Loos  et  al.,  2009,  2010,  2011),  the  D2  antagonist 
L-sulpiride (Bocchetta et al., 1993), pramipexole (Goldberg et al., 
2004), or possibly oxcarbazepine (Juruena et al., 2009) but not im-
ipramine (Nemeroff et al., 2001). The data on adding paroxetine 
and  amitriptyline  are  equivocal  (Bocchetta  et  al.,  1993;  Bauer 
et  al.,  1999;  Young  et  al.,  2000;  Pilhatsch  et  al.,  2010;  van  der 
Loos  et  al.,  2010).  Imipramine  and  venlafaxine  might  pose  the 
patients  at  an  increased  risk  of  switching  without  a  superior 
benefit  compared  with  other  antidepressants  (Nemeroff  et  al., 
2001; Vieta et al., 2002a); however, 1 study suggests quite the op-
posite (Amsterdam et al., 2016b). One study suggested that the 
addition of lamotrigine to quetiapine treatment improved out-
comes, but folic acid seems to nullify the effect of lamotrigine 
(Geddes et al., 2016).

In  BD  patients  experiencing  depression  during  treatment 
with  lithium  or  valproate,  ketamine  or  lurasidone  could  be 
added. Lurasidone also improves anxiety (Loebel et al., 2014) and 
ketamine  improves  suicidality.  Response  to  a  single  ketamine 
infusion may appear within hours but does not last more than 
3  to  4  days  (Diazgranados  et  al.,  2010;  Zarate  et  al.,  2012;  Lally 
et al., 2014; Loebel et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015). One study reported 
negative  results  (Xu  et  al.,  2015).  Besides  reducing  suicidality, 
ketamine has been reported to be efficacious especially against 
anhedonia  (Lally  et  al.,  2014)  and  fatigue  (Saligan  et  al.,  2016). 
Repeated administration of ketamine studies have not been car-
ried in BD (Murrough et al., 2013; Phillips et al., 2019). There is 1 

According  to  controlled  data,  the  agents  not  recom-
mended  include  donepezil,  gabapentin,  lamotrigine,  lovastatin, 
paliperidone, 
and 
ziprasidone, while additionally, on the basis of open data, nifedi-
pine and verapamil are also not recommended (Table 5; Figure 2).

risperidone, 

topiramate, 

ramelteon, 

Mixed Episodes (n = 7)
Adding olanzapine or placebo to divalproex-resistant mixed pa-
tients for 6 weeks returned positive results both for the manic 
as well as for the depressive component (Houston et al., 2009). 

One  open  study  of  adjunct  gabapentin  (300–2000  mg/d)  re-
ported  an  almost  50%  response  rate  but  this  concerned  exclu-
sively the depressive component (Perugi et al., 1999).

There  were  no  randomized  trials  of  ECT  in  mixed  episodes 
(Loo et al., 2011). The results of open trials concerning the useful-
ness of ECT suggest that approximately 40% to two-thirds of pa-
tients responded and 30% remitted, and the response concerned 
both  the  manic  and  the  depressive  components  (Medda  et  al., 
2010, 2015; Perugi et al., 2017). One study concerning repetitive 
transcranial stimulation (rTMS) reported a lower response rate 
(around 40%) and response restricted to the depressive compo-
nent (Pallanti et al., 2014).

failed  study  with  lurasidone  as  add-on  to  lithium  or  valproate 
(Suppes et al., 2013, 2016).

An  underpowered  placebo-controlled  adjunctive  study  of 
aripiprazole  to  lithium  and  citalopram  was  negative  (Quante 
et al., 2010).

For a depressed episode during treatment with mood stabil-
izers,  it  is  not  beneficial  to  add  ziprasidone  (Sachs  et  al.,  2011; 
Patkar  et  al.,  2015).  Topiramate  and  levetiracetam  should  be 
avoided because of a risk of worsening depression and inducing 
suicidality (CIT0371). Imipramine and venlafaxine increased the 
risk of switching without superior benefits compared with other 
antidepressants (Sachs et al., 1994, 2011; Post et al., 2001, 2006; 
Shelton  and  Stahl,  2004;  Schaffer  et  al.,  2006;  Altshuler  et  al., 
2009; Saricicek et al., 2011).

The  data  are  negative  concerning  the  addition  of 
memantine  on  lamotrigine  (Anand  et  al.,  2012)  or  valproate 
(Lee  et  al.,  2014a,  2014b),  ketamine  on  ECT  (Abdallah  et  al., 
2012), lisdexamfetamine to treatment as usual (TAU) (McElroy 
et al., 2015), and agomelatine to lithium or valproate (Yatham 
et al., 2016).

A  study  in  85  patients  with  adjunctive  modafinil  (mean 
dosage  177  mg/d)  was  positive  without  switching  to  mania  or 
hypomania.  Response  and  remission  rates  were  higher  in  the 
modafinil group (44% and 39%) compared with the placebo group 
(23% and 18%) (Frye et al., 2007). However, modafinil could cause 
subclinical switches (Fountoulakis et al., 2008b). One published 
study  for  the  treatment  of  acute  BD-I  depression  with  adjunct 
armodafinil  (dosage  150  mg/d;  n = 128)  to  lithium,  valproate,  or 
olanzapine was positive (Calabrese et al., 2010, 2014). However, 2 
other studies were negative (Ostacher, 2014; Ketter et al., 2015).

One  small  study  on  pioglitazone  as  add-on  to  lithium 
in  bipolar  patients  without  diabetes  mellitus  was  positive 
(Zeinoddini et al., 2015). A trial of celecoxib (400 mg/d) was nega-
tive  in  the  treatment  of  depressive  or  mixed  episodes  (Nery 
et  al.,  2008).  One  study  with  add-on  pregnenolone  (titrated  to 
500 mg/d) was negative (Brown et al., 2014). While a very small 
report without an a priori defined primary outcome suggested 
that  adding  supraphysiologic  doses  of  levothyroxine  (L-T4)  to 
a  mood  stabilizer  improves  the  outcome  (Bauer  et  al.,  2016),  a 
previous, more complete report on the same placebo-controlled 
dataset was negative (Stamm et al., 2014). That study reported 
positive  findings  in  females  but  not  in  males.  A  small  quasi-
placebo-controlled  study  was  positive  concerning  the  addition 
of inositol (Chengappa et al., 2000).

A 24-week trial on the efficacy of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 1 g 
twice daily) adjunctive to usual medication in subsyndromal but 
treatment-resistant  depressive  symptoms  was  positive  (Berk 
et  al.,  2008);  however,  a  more  recent  study  was  negative  (Berk 
et  al.,  2019a,  2019b). The  data  on  omega-3  fatty  acids  are  con-
flicting and inconclusive (Stoll et al., 1999; Frangou et al., 2006, 
2007; Keck et al., 2006; Murphy et al., 2012). One negative study 
exists  concerning  S-adenosyl-L-methione  up  to  1400  mg/d 
(Murphy et al., 2014).

ECT  may  be  more  effective  than  pharmacotherapy  for 
treatment-resistant  bipolar  depression  (Schoeyen  et  al.,  2015) 
but TMS is poorly investigated in bipolar depression (Dell’Osso 
et al., 2009). Active deep TMS was superior to sham at end point 
(P = .03) but not at follow-up (Tavares et al., 2017). One study on 
transcranial direct current stimulation reported that the cumu-
lative response rates were higher in the active vs sham groups 
(67.6% vs 30.4%; P = .01) but not remission rates (37.4% vs 19.1%; 
P = .18) (Sampaio-Junior et al., 2018).

Sleep  deprivation  and  other  noninvasive  circadian-related 
interventions  could  be  useful  add-on  treatments  to  accelerate 

Fountoulakis et al.

and  sustain  the  antidepressant  response  (Wu  et  al.,  2009). 
A study on bright light therapy in bipolar depression was nega-
tive (Dauphinais et al., 2012), whereas other controlled studies 
were positive (Sit et al., 2018; Yorguner Kupeli et al., 2018; Zhou 
et al., 2018).

Open Label Studies in Treatment of Resistant Acute Bipolar Depression 
(n = 32)
One  study  reported  a  31%  response  rate  with  add-on 
levetiracetam titrated to a target dose of 2000 mg/d (Post et al., 
2005).  Another  study  supported  the  adjunctive  therapy  with 
diltiazem (Silverstone and Birkett, 2000).

Adding  bupropion  to  ongoing  treatment  after  4  weeks 
yielded  a  60%  response  (Erfurth  et  al.,  2002)  while  adding 
tranylcypromine in imipramine-resistant patients resulted in a 
75% response (Thase et al., 1992).

Resistant  depressive  patients  from  the  STEP-BD  trial  were 
randomly  assigned  to  open-label  adjunctive  treatment  with 
lamotrigine, inositol, or risperidone for up to 16 weeks without 
any  significant  between-group  differences.  However,  the  re-
covery  rate  with  lamotrigine  was  23.8%  vs  17.4%  with  inositol 
and  4.6%  with  risperidone  (Nierenberg  et  al.,  2006).  Another 
STEP-BD subgroup received adjunctive aripiprazole, but the re-
sponse rate was as low as 27% (Ketter et al., 2006).

Adjunctive gabapentin for 12 weeks (mean dose 1725 mg/d) 
resulted in a 55% response (Wang et al., 2002) and for 8 weeks 
with  mean  dosage  1270  ±  561  mg  in  a  42%  response  rate 
(Perugi et al., 2002). A third very small trial (n = 5) reported that 
all  patients  responded  to  adjunctive  gabapentin  (Altshuler 
et al., 1999).

Adding  lamotrigine  75–100  mg/d  resulted  in  an  approxi-
(Kusumakar  and  Yatham,  1997; 

mately  50–70%  response 
Nierenberg et al., 2006; Kagawa et al., 2014).

Adding levetiracetam up to 3000 mg/d resulted in 31% remis-
sion (Post et al., 2005). Approximately 23% of patients from the 
Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network long-term follow-up study 
responded  after  adding  8.7  mg/d  of  tiagabine  (Suppes  et  al., 
2002)  and  one-half  of  patients  responded  to  topiramate  (Vieta 
et  al.,  2002b).  Two-thirds  of  patients  responded  to  0.95  mg/d 
pramipexole (Lattanzi et al., 2002).

There  were  3  positive  papers  (2  on  the  same  dataset)  on 
the utilization of a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over 
40 min resulting in a 50% response (Rybakowski et al., 2013, 2017; 
Ionescu et al., 2015). One small study was positive for omega-3 
fatty acids (Chiu et al., 2005).

More than one-half of patients and two-thirds of those with 
BD-I  are  reported  to  respond  to  ECT  (Medda  et  al.,  2009,  2010; 
Perugi et al., 2012, 2017; Schoeyen et al., 2015) while one-fourth 
manifest remission (Medda et al., 2010). One study, however, re-
ported similar remission rates with an algorithm-based pharma-
cological  treatment  (34.8%  vs  30.0%)  (Schoeyen  et  al.,  2015). 
Another study with nonconvulsive electrotherapy reported 73% 
response and 55% remission rates (Regenold et al., 2015).

Early  rTMS  studies  reported  a  60%  response  rate  (Dell’Osso 
et al., 2009; Wozniak-Kwasniewska et al., 2015). One study of se-
quential  bilateral  rTMS  vs  sham  treatment  was  negative  with 
both  arms  having  a  10%  response  rate  (Fitzgerald  et  al.,  2016), 
but  another  with  high-frequency  repetitive  transcranial  mag-
netic  stimulation  reported  35%  response  and  30%  remission 
rates (Poleszczyk et al., 2018).

The  results  with  deep  brain  stimulation  in  a  very  small 
study  were  rather  poor  (<20%  acute  response  and  remission 
rates) (Holtzheimer et al., 2012), and similarly a study with deep 
(H1-coil) transcranial magnetic stimulation (deep TMS) vs sham

was superior at week-4 in HDRS but not at follow-up at week-
8.  There  was  no  difference  in  response  and  remission  rates 
(Tavares et al., 2017). An earlier H1-Coil rTMS study reported that 
two-thirds of patients responded and one-half of them remitted 
(Harel et al., 2011).

Total sleep deprivation plus light therapy for 1 week resulted 

in a 44% response in resistant patients (Benedetti et al., 2005).

Post-hoc, Review, and Meta-Analytic Studies (n = 48)
The  problems  in  the  literature  concerning  the  treatment  of 
resistant  bipolar  depression  are  described  in  several  reviews 
and meta-analytical studies. The overall conclusion is that the 
available hard data are extremely scarce and most of the strat-
egies remain essentially experimental; however, there seem to 
be  some  that  are  potentially  efficacious  and  promising  (Aan 
Het  Rot  et  al.,  2012;  Poon  et  al.,  2012;  Sienaert  et  al.,  2013;  Hui 
Poon  et  al.,  2015).  In  addition,  combination  studies  confirmed 
the higher rate of adverse events compared with monotherapy 
(Galling et al., 2015).

Existing  papers  suggest  minimal  effects  of  lamotrigine, 
risperidone, inositol (Parikh et al., 2010), or lurasidone (Sanford 
and  Dhillon,  2015)  and  that  the  addition  of  an  antidepressant 
does  not  increase  efficacy  (Parikh  et  al.,  2010;  Van  Lieshout 
and  MacQueen,  2010).  The  combination  with  best  data  in  re-
sistant  acute  bipolar  depression  is  lithium  plus  lamotrigine 
(Fountoulakis et al., 2012c). Antidepressant reviews provide con-
flicting conclusions (Gijsman et al., 2004; Sidor and Macqueen, 
2011; Vazquez et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013); 1 meta-analysis was 
negative  regarding  the  usefulness  of  galantamine,  donepezil, 
and memantine (Veronese et al., 2016) while another concluded 
that second-generation antidepressants produced a significant 
but  small  score  change  but  had  no  effect  in  response  and  re-
mission  rates. There  was  also  no  increased  risk  of  treatment-
emergent  mania  or  hypomania  during  the  acute  phase  while 
there was some risk in the long term (McGirr et al., 2016a).

Some  studies  support  the  efficacy  of  stimulants,  espe-
cially  modafinil  and  armodafinil  (Corp  et  al.,  2014),  ketamine 
(Corp  et  al.,  2014;  Fond  et  al.,  2014;  McGirr  et  al.,  2015),  and

One post-hoc study pooled the data from transcranial direct 
current  stimulation  (transcranial  direct  current  stimulation) 
trials  and  reported  significant  positive  results  (D’Urso  et  al., 
2017) while a review suggested that Vagus nerve stimulation is 
promising for bipolar depression (Cimpianu et al., 2017). Another 
review focused on surgical interventions but without any con-
clusion (Lipsman et al., 2010).

Conclusion  Concerning  the  Treatment  of  Resistant  Acute  Bipolar  
Depression
Controlled data suggest that in resistant bipolar depressive pa-
tients, it is beneficial to use lithium plus lamotrigine or adding 
lamotrigine,  modafinil,  or  pramipexole.  Ketamine  is  also  an-
other  option  but  carries  the  risk  of  transient  dissociation  and 
increased blood pressure. The data are inconclusive concerning 
L-sulpiride, amitriptyline, bupropion, clozapine, diltiazem, ECT, 
gabapentin,  l-thyroxine,  lurasidone,  NAC,  omega-3  fatty  acids, 
oxcarbazepine, paroxetine, pramipexole, sleep deprivation, TMS, 
tranylcypromine, and venlafaxine.

According to either controlled or open data, the interventions 
not recommended include agomelatine, aripiprazole, celecoxib, 
deep  brain  stimulation,  galantamine,  imipramine,  inositol, 
leviracetam, 
lisdexamfetamine,  memantine,  pregnenolone, 
S-adenosyl-L-methione,  topiramate,  and  ziprasidone  (Table  6; 
Figure 3).

BD Resistant to Maintenance Treatment (n = 49)

Double-Blind Studies in Maintenance Treatment of Resistant BD (n = 24)
A  small  study  supported  the  adding  of  phenytoin  to  TAU 
(Mishory et al., 2003) as did another small one for gabapentin 
(but  not  on  top  of  antipsychotics)  (Vieta  et  al.,  2006).  One 
study  suggested  a  beneficial  effect  of  clozapine  on  a  small 
subsample of nonpsychotic BD (Suppes et al., 1999). Data are 
equivocal for the addition of lamotrigine to lithium (van der 
Loos  et  al.,  2011)  and  negative  for  adjunctive  pramipexole 
to  TAU  in  stabilized  BD  patients  with  the  aim  to  improve 
neurocognition  (Burdick  et  al.,  2012).  Two  studies  suggest 
that Risperidone Long Acting Injectable (RLAI) on TAU signifi-
cantly  prolongs  the  time  to  relapse  (Macfadden  et  al.,  2009; 
Quiroz et al., 2010), as did adding aripiprazole (Marcus et al., 
2011)  or  ziprasidone  (Citrome,  2010)  to  lithium  or  valproate. 
Adding aripiprazole to lamotrigine did not improve long-term 
outcome  (Carlson  et  al.,  2012).  Patients  who  responded  to 
treatment  with  lithium,  valproate,  or  carbamazepine  plus 
antidepressants were more likely to maintain response with 
continuation of the combined treatment; however, those pa-
tients  who  manifested  only  a  partial  acute  response  were 
unlikely  to  further  improve  when  the  same  treatment  was 
continued  (Altshuler  et  al.,  2009).  Adjunctive  asenapine  to 
lithium or valproate was well tolerated for up to 52 weeks, but 
no  efficacy  data  were  reported  from  that  trial  due  to  lack  of 
statistical power (Szegedi et al., 2012).

One  trial  in  75  BD  patients  reported  that  NAC  treatment 
caused  a  significant  improvement  on  the  MADRS  score  com-
pared  with  placebo  (P = .002)  during  maintenance.  There  was 
no effect of NAC on time to a mood episode and no significant 
between-group differences in adverse events (Berk et al., 2008). 
Another study in 14 BD-II patients from the previous study re-
ported a superiority of the NAC group vs placebo in terms of re-
mission (P = .031) (Magalhaes et al., 2011a). Data were conflicting 
concerning  ramelteon  (Norris  et  al.,  2013;  Mahableshwarkar 
et al., 2017) and negative results for memantine in patients on 
valproate treatment (Lee et al., 2014b).

during the maintenance phase.

antiinflammatory  agents  (Rosenblat  et  al.,  2016).  A  meta-
analytic  study  supported  the  efficacy  of  dopaminergic  drugs 
(Szmulewicz  et  al.,  2017). The  review  of  pramipexole  data  sug-
gested that two-thirds of patients respond (Dell’Osso and Ketter, 
2013; Tondo et al., 2014).

The  meta-analysis  of  ketamine  studies  supported  its  effi-
cacy  but  also  suggested  the  data  are  conflicting  as  to  whether 
the  therapeutic  effect  extends  beyond  day  4  and  up  to  day  7 
(Sienaert  et  al.,  2013;  Caddy  et  al.,  2014;  Fond  and  Boyer,  2014; 
Fond  et  al.,  2014; Tondo  et  al.,  2014;  Coyle  and  Laws,  2015;  Lee 
et al., 2015; McGirr et al., 2015; Newport et al., 2015; Parsaik et al., 
2015; Romeo et al., 2015; Bobo et al., 2016; Kishimoto et al., 2016; 
Saligan et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2016; Kraus et al., 2017).

One meta-analysis was positive concerning the usefulness of 

light therapy (Tseng et al., 2016).

Reviews and meta-analyses are positive concerning omega-
fatty acids, but they do not include all trials (Sarris et al., 2012; 
Sylvia  et  al.,  2013;  Grosso  et  al.,  2014;  Ciappolino  et  al.,  2017). 
Another  meta-analysis  was  negative  for  adjunctive  inositol 
(Mukai et al., 2014) and another one supported the usefulness of 
clozapine (Li et al., 2015).

There  are  no  studies  with  adequate  methodology  on  ECT 
(Loo  et  al.,  2011; Versiani  et  al.,  2011).  One  meta-analysis  com-
pared the efficacy of ECT in unipolar vs bipolar depression and 
identified  6  relevant  studies.  It  reported  a  similar  rate  of  re-
sponse in both disorders (50.9% vs 53.2%) (Dierckx et al., 2012).

A  meta-analysis  of  rTMS  in  bipolar  depression,  although 
based  overall  on  a  smaller  number  of  participants,  supported 
efficacy (McGirr et al., 2016b).

There  are  some  studies  suggesting  that  there  is  a  role  for 
various nutritional supplements such as n-3 fatty acids (eicosa-
pentaenoic  acid  and  docosahexaenoic  acid),  chromium,  cho-
line, magnesium, and tryptophan alone or in combination with 
pharmacotherapies for the treatment of BD, but the data are of 
low quality (Sylvia et al., 2013).

Open-Label Studies in Maintenance Treatment of Resistant BD (n = 22)
Open  studies  support  the  usefulness  of  adding  clozapine 
(Suppes  et  al.,  1999;  Ciapparelli  et  al.,  2000,  2003),  gabapentin 
(Schaffer and Schaffer, 1999), lamotrigine (Calabrese et al., 1999), 
levetiacetam (Post et al., 2005), RLAI (Yatham et al., 2007a), and 
the  anticonvulsant  primidone  (Schaffer  et  al.,  1999)  with  ap-
proximately 30–40% of patients responding, while a higher than 
40%  response  rate  was  reported  for  olanzapine  (McElroy  et  al., 
1998; Vieta  et  al.,  2001),  higher  than  50%  with  L-thyroxine T(4) 
(Bauer  et  al.,  2002),  and  higher  than  70%  for  the  N-methyl-D-
aspartate antagonist memantine (Koukopoulos et al., 2010).

One-third of participants responded well to the combination 
of lithium plus valproate (Denicoff et al., 1997), but the BALANCE 
study neither supported nor refuted the superiority of the com-
bination  of  lithium  plus  valproate  over  monotherapy  (Geddes 
et al., 2002; Rendell et al., 2004; Investigators et al., 2010). Results 
were  somewhat  positive  also  for  the  combination  of  carba-
mazepine plus nimodipine, but negative for adding the calcium 
channel blocker verapamil (Pazzaglia et al., 1998). For overweight 
patients, adding topiramate (McElroy et al., 2000; Lykouras and 
Hatzimanolis,  2004;  Gabriel,  2007)or  zonisamide  (Wang  et  al., 
2008)  could  be  an  option.  However,  mood  destabilization  was 
observed in another study with the addition of zonisamide.

Using  maintenance  ECT  for  more  than  18  months,  with  a 
treatment at approximately monthly intervals, resulted in an up 
to 80% response rate (Vanelle et al., 1994).

Post-hoc, Review, and Meta-Analytic Studies (n = 10)
Meta-analyses support the efficacy of antidepressants added to 
mood stabilizers in the long-term treatment of bipolar patients 
without increasing risk of new manic/hypomanic episodes (Liu 
et  al.,  2017).  Ziprasidone  plus  lithium  or  valproate  treatment 
showed modest to moderate remission rates at week 24 based 
on  4  different  remission  criteria  in  terms  of  symptomatic  and 
sustained remission (Pae et al., 2012).

The addition of an atypical antipsychotic-antimanic agent in 
some BD patients might help to reduce suicidal ideation (Houston 
et al., 2006). Efficacy of NAC was also supported by 2 post-hoc ana-
lyses (Magalhaes et al., 2011b, 2013), which, however did not in-
clude more recent negative data. Two other studies supported the 
usefulness of RLAI (Bobo and Shelton, 2010) for the maintenance 
treatment of BD-I disorder in adults as an adjunct to lithium or 
valproate. One paper supported the usefulness of the dopamine 
agonist pramipexole (Dell’Osso and Ketter, 2013). Overall, the re-
view  papers  support  the  usefulness  of  ECT  (Vaidya  et  al.,  2003; 
Fountoulakis et al., 2012c), the combination of antiepileptics with 
antipsychotics (Fountoulakis et al., 2012c), and clozapine (Li et al., 
2015) for the maintenance treatment of resistant patients.

Conclusion Concerning Treatment for Resistant Patients During Main-
tenance Phase
Controlled data suggest that in resistant patients (principally to 
lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine), it is beneficial to add anti-
depressants,  RLAI,  aripiprazole,  or  ziprasidone  to  the  ongoing 
treatment.  The  next  choice  should  be  adding  gabapentin  or 
phenytoin. The data are inconclusive concerning clozapine, ECT, 
leviracetam, lithium plus lamotrigine or valproate, L-thyroxine, 
the  calcium  blocker  nimodipine,  olanzapine,  primidone, 
ramelteon, and the food supplements choline, chromium, mag-
nesium, n-3 fatty acids, and tryptophan.

agents 

It is important to note that the scarcity of the data does not 
permit a differential choice between agents and treatment op-
tions to prevent the relapse into a manic or depressive episode 
preferentially.

Resistant Rapid Cycling Cases (n = 10)
The  data  on  resistant  patients  with  rapid  cycling  course  are 
very few. Overall, they suggest that the combination of lithium 
plus divalproex for up to 16 weeks leads to only 14% stabiliza-
tion  with  no  additional  value  of  adjunct  lamotrigine  (Kemp 
et  al.,  2012).  One  small  trial  of  clorgyline  2.5–10.0  mg/d,  alone 
or in combination with lithium carbonate, was positive (Potter 
et  al.,  1982),  while  clozapine  was  found  to  be  less  efficacious 
in resistant rapid cycling patients (Suppes et al., 2004; Li et al., 
2015). On the contrary, lamotrigine as an add-on therapy exerted 
a similar effect in rapid and non-rapid cycling patients (Bowden 
et al., 1999). A small cross-over, double blind study was positive 
for adjunctive nimodipine (Pazzaglia et al., 1993).

Adding mexiletine 200–1200 mg/d led to 46% remission and 
15% partial response (Schaffer et al., 2000) while levothyroxine 
improved  only  depressive  symptoms  (Bauer  and  Whybrow, 
1990).  Vagus  nerve  stimulation  was  associated  with  a  38.1% 
mean  improvement  in  overall  illness  over  a  12-month  study 
period (Marangell et al., 2008). Adding chromium resulted in an 
acute response in one-third of patients, but only regarding de-
pression. The high drop-out rate made it impossible to test for 
maintenance efficacy (Amann et al., 2007).

Lithium Discontinuation-Induced Treatment Resistance (n = 10)
Treatment  resistance  possibly  induced  by  lithium  discontinu-
ation was suggested for the first time by Post et al following a 
systematic  life-chart  methodology  in  the  study  of  4  patients 
with BD in whom long periods (6–15 years) of effective lithium 
prophylaxis  were  followed  by  relapses  on  lithium  discontinu-
ation. Once the drug was reinstituted, it was no longer effective 
(Post  et  al.,  1992).  However,  the  reason  for  discontinuation  in 
these 4 cases was not reported, and the discussion of these cases 
clearly leaves room for a progression of the illness rather than a 
specific lithium-related cause as the most probable explanation.
Case  reports  and  selected  reviews  support  this  (Post  et  al., 
1993;  Bauer,  1994;  Murray,  1994;  Koukopoulos  et  al.,  1995;  Maj 
et al., 1995; Tondo et al., 1997; Post and Leverich, 2008; Post, 2012) 
but the arguments are scientifically weak.

The  only  existing  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  of 
the  literature  identified  the  existence  of  212  patient  data  rele-
vant to this question and the meta-analysis returned negative 
results, suggesting there is no convincing evidence that lithium 
is  less  effective  when  treatment  is  discontinued  and  restarted 
compared with uninterrupted treatment (de Vries et al., 2013).

Psychological Treatments (n = 21)
There are some but overall limited data of problematic quality 
concerning the usefulness of specific adjunctive psychotherapies 
(Reinares et al., 2014; Miziou et al., 2015).

Although  the  overall  data  for  the  long-term  efficacy  of 
cognitive-behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  either  as  monotherapy  or 
as add on to TAU are negative concerning relapse prevention, 
there are some positive results for the acute depressive phase 
in BD (Ball et al., 2006;  Scott et al., 2006;  Zaretsky et al., 2008; 
Costa  et  al.,  2011;  Gomes  et  al.,  2011;  Meyer  and  Hautzinger, 

Fountoulakis et al.

2012;  Gonzalez  Isasi  et  al.,  2014).  The  effectiveness  of  psy-
chotherapy  for  resistant  patients  was  reported  to  increase 
with  time,  and  this  improvement  was  not  significant  until 
12 months of follow-up (Gonzalez-Isasi et al., 2010, 2012; Isasi 
et  al.,  2010). A  post-hoc  analysis  suggested  that  CBT  could  be 
more effective than TAU in patients with less than 12 previous 
episodes but less effective in those with more episodes (Scott 
et  al.,  2006).  In  BD  patients  with  insomnia,  CBT  for  insomnia 
was  superior  to  psychoeducation  concerning  manic  relapses 
(Harvey et al., 2015).

The data on adjunctive psychoeducation suggest that com-
pared with TAU or nonspecific intervention, it prevents relapse 
to  both  poles  if  administered  to  patients  in  clinical  remission 
(Perry et al., 1999; Colom et al., 2003; Colom et al., 2009; Lobban 
et al., 2010; de Barros Pellegrinelli et al., 2013), but it has no ef-
fect  on  biological  rhythms  (Cardoso Tde  et  al.,  2015).  Again,  a 
post-hoc  analysis  suggested  that  patients  with  more  than  7 
episodes  did  not  show  significant  improvement  with  group 
psychoeducation  for  time  to  recurrence,  and  those  with  more 
than 14 episodes did not benefit from the treatment in terms of 
time spent ill (Colom et al., 2010). A systematic review confirmed 
the above (Bond and Anderson, 2015).

There are no data to support the usefulness of interpersonal 
and  social  rhythm  therapy,  family  focus  treatment,  intensive 
psychosocial  intervention,  cognitive  remediation  and  func-
tional  remediation,  mindfulness-based  interventions  (MBCT), 
or internet-based interventions in the treatment of resistant BD 
patients.

Overall,  there  are  limited  data  to  suggest  that  any  kind  of 
psychotherapy  is  useful  in  resistant  BD  patients;  some  data 
suggest that it could be useful in resistant patients at the early 
stages of the disorder.

Algorithm for Treatment of Resistant BD

A  visual  representation  of  the  recommended  steps  in  the 
treatment  of  resistant  cases  during  each  phase  is  shown  in 
Figures  2–4.  As  already  mentioned,  this  specific  algorithm  is 
based  on  the  materials  collected  to  develop  a  general  algo-
rithm  for  BD  by  the  CINP  (Fountoulakis  et  al.,  2017a,  2017b, 
2017c, 2017d).

The authors decided that although mixed episodes are not 
included  in  DSM-5,  it  would  be  important  to  include  a  guid-
ance option for them since some relevant data do exist. Also, 
they  decided  to  include  a  recommendation  for  adding  CBT 
and/or  psychoeducation  at  a  level  higher  than  the  evidence 
suggests,  because,  if  available,  they  could  be  added  without 
problems  to  existing  pharmacotherapy.  However,  the  recom-
mendation is that this addition should not interfere with the 
application of the algorithm itself, that is, the first step of the 
algorithm concerning pharmacotherapy should always be ini-
tialized  and  pseudo-resistance  should  have  been  ruled  out 
(Schaffer et al., 2017).

Discussion

The current guidelines are the first to our knowledge developed 
specifically for the treatment of resistant bipolar patients, and 
they  also  include  an  operationalized  definition  of  treatment 
resistance.

The  key  issue  is  the  definition  of “response,”  since  this  is 
a  prerequisite  for  the  definition  of “resistant.” There  are  sev-
eral  papers  defining  response,  remission,  and  resistance  in 
mental  disorders,  and  it  seems  that  all  the  definitions  are 

244

characterized  by  a  rather  narrow  and  vague  approach.  With 
BD, these definitions face a particular problem. They perform 
well with disorders with a predominantly linear course, char-
acterized  by  exacerbations  and  remissions  and  with  a  single 
major factor or constellation of symptoms (e.g., unipolar mel-
ancholic  depression).  They  also  perform  relatively  well  with 
complex disorders like schizophrenia that, in spite of the large 
variability of the clinical picture (to the extent it is possible 2 
patients  with  schizophrenia  not  sharing  a  single  symptom), 
their  treatment  is  more  or  less  unimodal  (antipsychotics) 
and the course of the disease is monotonous. In BD, however, 
the course is characterized by episodes of distinct clusters of 
symptoms while the resulting accumulated stress has a pro-
found  adverse  effect  on  neurocognition  and  general  func-
tioning with the neurobiology of the patient to change under 
the pressure of what is called “allostatic load,” leading eventu-
ally  to  treatment  resistance,  disability,  high  comorbidity,  and 
preterm mortality (Vieta et al., 2013).

When it comes to BD, things are quite different from other 
mental  disorders.  The  reliability  and  validity  of  usual  ap-
proaches are questionable because both the clinical picture and 
the  treatment  are  complex  and  interrelated.  Also,  the  course 
is  not  monotonous  but,  on  the  contrary,  it  manifests  with  un-
predictable  switches  with  a  complex  and  unique  relationship 
between  clinical  symptoms  and  impairment.  Another  issue  is 
the  problematic  interplay  of  the  clinical  picture  with  psycho-
metric scale scores when the longitudinal course of the disorder 
is  complex,  as  in  the  case  of  BD.  For  example,  the  use  of  the 
MADRS  scale  to  assess  response  to  treatment  with  a  tricyclic 
antidepressant could lead to erroneous conclusions in case this 
depressive BD patient becomes mixed or rapid cycling emerges. 
The  MADRS  will  probably  classify  him  as  being  a “responder,” 
but  whether  this  is  true  is  a  matter  of  debate. Accepting  sim-
plistic approaches cannot serve as a real solution.

The current study developed a definition of treatment resist-
ance in BD and an algorithm for its treatment. These were based 
on a thorough and deep search of the literature. During the last 
couple of decades, our knowledge concerning the treatment of 
BD has changed radically (Grande et al., 2016; Vieta et al., 2018), 
and  a  rather  narrow  therapeutic  effect  for  most  agents  is  ac-
cepted,  so  narrow  that  the  very  existence  of  the  term  “mood 
stabilizer” is under question. Further, the collapse of the “class 
effect”  approach  to  BD  treatment  (Rosa  et  al.,  2011)  raises  im-
portant  questions  as  to  which  patients  are  truly  resistant  and 
which were simply treated in a suboptimal way.

The  review  of  the  literature  suggested  that  there  are  some 
evidence-based  options  for  the  treatment  of  resistant  acute 
mania  but  much  fewer  for  the  treatment  of  resistant  depres-
sion,  mixed  states,  and  rapid  cycling  cases. Thus,  the  relative 
shortage of hard data (Poon et al., 2012) leaves the clinician in 
many cases with the heavy burden to decide on the basis of clin-
ical  experience  and  wisdom. The  current  treatment  guidelines 
on one hand rely on hard data; however, they provide a limited 
number of options for the treatment of a variety of cases, and 
without the ability to tailor treatment to the clinical picture and 
the specific needs of the individual patient. Future specific and 
targeted  research  is  essential  and  necessary  to  test  possible 
treatment approaches for resistant patients of all kinds.

Most  of  the  problems  concerning  the  interplay  of  clinical 
features with definitions of response and resistance, especially 
for  the  maintenance  phase,  have  been  discussed  elsewhere 
(Ghaemi et al., 2004; Fountoulakis, 2010; Vieta and Garriga, 2016; 
Fountoulakis et al., 2017b, 2017c, 2017d). Clinical wisdom is also 
of  high  importance  in  the  planning  of  long-term  treatment  of 

BD patients. In this frame, the concept of “predominant polarity” 
and the “polarity index” of a given agent are of great importance 
since  it  guides  the  clinician  to  tailor  treatment  to  the  specific 
needs  of  the  specific  patient  (Nivoli  et  al.,  2011;  Popovic  et  al., 
2012, 2013, 2014; Sentissi et al., 2019).

Better  knowledge  of  the  underlying  neurobiological  sub-
strate of treatment resistance in BD would be important, since 
the  failure  of  physiological  compensatory  mechanisms  over 
time, accompanied by neuroprogression and cross-sensitization 
of  episode  recurrence,  trauma  exposure,  and  substance  use 
could  constitute  modifiable  factors  both  in  the  prevention  but 
also in the treatment of such cases (da Costa et al., 2016). So far, 
however, our knowledge does not permit a reliable prediction or 
assessment of resistant cases since no neurobiological or clin-
ical  variables  have  proven  reliable  (Gonzalez-Isasi  et  al.,  2012). 
However, the observation that psychoeducation is preferentially 
efficacious  in  patients  with  less  than  7  episodes,  while  it  has 
no effect in those with more than 14 episodes, provides us with 
a first clue of the stages and the timetable of the development 
of resistance (Colom et al., 2010; Bond and Anderson, 2015; van 
der Markt et al., 2019). On the other hand, while the stage of the 
progression of the disorder has been proposed as a factor that 
should be taken into consideration in the planning of treatment 
especially in resistant cases (Passos and Kapczinski, 2017), in es-
sence  this  might  reflect  a  cyclical  logic  with  treatment  resist-
ance defining the stage and vice versa.
