Abstract: Paramedics commonly experience both poor sleep and mental health symptoms. Clarify-
ing whether sleep or mental health symptoms are a challenge prior to commencement of employ-
ment  is  important,  as  early  prevention  and  intervention  initiatives  during  training  could  support 
these workers. Paramedicine students (n=53) were included, with sleep disorder screening (obstruc-
tive  sleep  apnea,  insomnia  and  restless  legs  syndrome),  and  mental  health  outcomes  (depressive 
symptoms:  Patient  Health  Questionnaire-9,  and  anxiety  symptoms:  General Anxiety  Disorder-7). 
Data  were  analysed  using  robust  regression  models,  adjusted  for  age,  sex,  and  shift  work  status. 
Meeting criteria for a sleep disorder (n=21) was associated with higher scores for anxiety (8.2 [95% 
CI: 5.9–10.5] v 4.6, [3.4–5.8]) and depressive symptoms (11.1 [8.6–13.6] v 4.4 [3.1–5.7)] compared 
to those who did not meet the criteria for a sleep disorder (n=32). Depressive symptoms were lower 
in those with perceived control over sleep (5.2 [3.2–7.2] v 9.8 [7.7–11.8]). There was no interaction 
between sleep disorder risk and perceived control over sleep on mental health symptoms. Investiga-
tion  and  management  of  factors  contributing  to  low  perceived  control  over  sleep,  together  with 
early screening and management of sleep disorders, are likely to be important priorities to support 
paramedic student wellbeing prior to commencing shift work.

Introduction

Paramedics  provide  an  essential  health  service,  deliv-
ering  urgent  treatment  for  those  suffering  from  serious 
illnesses  and  injuries  around  the  clock1).  Paramedics  are 
registered  health  care  practitioners  who  provide  emer-
gency  care  to  acutely  ill  or  injured  persons  outside  of 
hospital. These workers have a physically and psychologi-
cally  demanding  role2–4),  as  they  are  frequently  exposed 
to  occupational  hazards  including  workplace  violence,

traumatic events, working in time pressured and unpredict-
able  environments,  as  well  as  shift  work  schedules1,  5,  6). 
Among  metropolitan  paramedics,  an  estimated  36.1%, 
24.6%  and  39.3%  of  paramedics  experience  depression, 
anxiety  and  stress  respectively4).  Paramedics  are  also  at 
increased  risk  of  other  mental  health  conditions  such  as 
post-traumatic stress disorder7), and burnout8). These risks 
have  implications  for  the  sustainability  of  the  workforce, 
and early interventions to support wellbeing in paramedics 
should be a priority1).

Identifying modifiable factors to improve mental health 
and  wellbeing  in  paramedics  is  important.  One  such  fac-
tor  which  is  not  commonly  considered  in  paramedics  are 
sleep  disorders. According  to  recent Australian  estimates,

paramedics  experience  clinical  sleep  disorders  such  as 
shift work disorder, insomnia, restless leg syndrome (RLS) 
and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) at higher rates than the 
general  population3,  9,  10).  Furthermore,  paramedics  who 
screened as high risk for OSA reported significantly higher 
depressive symptoms than those at low risk for OSA3). Ef-
fective treatments for these sleep disorders exist, however 
diagnosis  rates  are  low  in  the  community  more  broad-
ly11,  12),  and  shift  work  conditions  can  impact  effective 
diagnosis and treatment of these common conditions13).

Given  the  known  bi-directional  relationship  between 
sleep  disorders  and  mental  health14),  and  the  rate  of  un-
diagnosed  sleep  disorders  in  young  adults  in  the  general 
population11,  12),  there  is  a  need  to  better  understand  the 
relationship  between  sleep  disorders  and  mental  health 
before paramedics commence their employment. Pre-com-
mencement  (i.e.,  before  beginning  work  as  a  paramedic) 
levels of depression are a significant risk factor for the de-
velopment of sleep disorders such as shift work disorder5). 
Further,  when  night  shift  work  and  a  sleep  disorder  are 
combined,  young  adults  report  significantly  greater  anxi-
ety  symptoms11).  Understanding  the  relationship  between 
perceived  control  over  sleep,  sleep  disorders  and  mental 
health  could  provide  important  insight  into  the  impact  of 
low self-efficacy for seeking help for sleep problems15).

The  overarching  aim  of  the  current  study  is  to  investi-
gate  the  association  between  risk  for  sleep  disorders  and 
mental  health  outcomes  in  paramedic  students. The  aim 
will be addressed through three hypotheses:
  i) paramedic  students  who  meet  criteria  for  a  sleep 
disorder  will  exhibit  higher  mental  healths  symptoms 
compared  to  those  who  do  not  meet  the  criteria  for  a 
sleep disorder,

 ii) paramedic  students  with  perceived  lower  control  over 

their sleep will have poorer mental health, and

 iii) perceived  control  over  sleep  will  modify  the  associa-
tion  between  sleep  disorder  risk  and  mental  health 
symptoms.

Methods

Participants

Flinders  University  paramedicine  students  enrolled 
in  any  year  of  the  Bachelor  of  Paramedicine  degree  in 
May 2022 were invited to participate via email, in-person 
presentations  at  lectures,  and  an  advertisement  on  the 
online learning platform. As part of a larger study of sleep 
disorder  management  in  paramedicine  students,  students 
could  complete  a  general  survey  about  sleep  and  mental 

409

health  symptoms. The  present  study  utilises  the  Stage  1 
data, which was a cross-sectional, online survey available 
to any enrolled student. The survey was available for two 
weeks,  between  May  3  and  May  17,  2022  and  took  ap-
proximately 30 min to complete. 

Materials

Demographic  information  was  gathered  about  the  par-
ticipants’  age,  sex,  living  conditions,  study  arrangements, 
and type of work. For sex, participants were asked ‘what 
sex  were  you  assigned  at  birth?’,  and  response  options 
included  female,  male,  prefer  not  to  answer.  Participants 
were  also  asked  about  living  arrangements  (who  do  you 
live  with?),  employment  status  (do  you  currently  have  a 
full-time, part-time or casual job of any kind?), shift work 
(are you a shift worker?), study conditions (are you study-
ing part-time or full-time?), and year of degree (what year 
of  your  paramedic  studies  [full-time  equivalent]  are  you 
in?) and typical sleep duration on work days and days off 
(hr).

Sleep disorder risk

Participants  were  screened  for  three  common  sleep 
disorders: insomnia, OSA, and RLS. Participants who re-
turned a positive screening result for one or more of these 
sleep  disorders  (see  below)  or  self-reported  a  diagnosis 
of  any  of  these  disorders  were  coded  as  “at  risk”,  while 
participants  who  did  not  screen  positive  for  any  sleep 
disorder, or self-report a diagnosis of sleep disorder, were 
considered as “not at risk”.

Insomnia

The  Sleep  Condition  Indicator  (SCI)16)  was  used  to 
identify risk for insomnia. The SCI is an eight-item scale 
which assesses sleep problems against the Diagnostic and 
Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  disorders  (DSM-5)  criteria 
for  insomnia  disorder17).  Each  item  is  scored  on  a  five-
point scale (0–4), with total scores ranging from 0 to 32. 
Higher scores indicate better sleep. Scores ≤16 reflect the 
minimum criteria for insomnia16).

Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)

The Berlin Questionnaire18) was used as a screening tool 
for OSA, as it has previously been validated for assessing 
risk  of  OSA19,  20). The  questionnaire  consists  of  10  ques-
tions divided into three categories. Category 1 (five ques-
tions) addresses snoring and breathing cessation, category 
2  (four  questions)  addresses  symptoms  of  excessive  day-
time sleepiness, and category 3 (one question plus height 

SLEEP DISORDERS AND MENTAL HEALTH IN PARAMEDICINE STUDENTS410

and weight information) addresses body mass index (BMI) 
and  hypertension.  Information  about  the  participants’ 
height  and  weight  were  self-reported.  Positive  scores  in 
two or more categories indicate high risk for OSA18).

Restless legs syndrome (RLS)

The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group 
(IRLSSG)  criteria21)  were  used  to  identify  RLS  based  on 
the  diagnostic  criteria  of  the  International  Classification 
of  Sleep  Disorders  (ICSD-3)21). The  screener  consists  of 
five questions designed to identify an individual’s urge to 
move  their  legs;  any  discomfort  associated  with  the  urge 
to move their legs; whether the discomfort is relieved by 
movement; the extent of distress experienced; and whether 
sleep disruption occurs. A clinically significant RLS diag-
nosis  was  assigned  when  participants  reported  all  symp-
toms  and,  at  a  minimum,  experienced  these  symptoms 
once or twice a week.

Perceived control over sleep

The Sleep Practices and Attitudes Questionnaire (SPAQ) 
was  included  in  the  survey  to  investigate  behaviour  and 
attitudes about sleep. The SPAQ has been used previously 
to assess habitual sleep, behaviours associated with sleep 
and  sleep  problems,  sleep  hygiene,  social  and  environ-
mental  factors  of  sleep  and  beliefs  and  attitudes  about 
sleep22). Participants were asked to self-rate the degree to 
which they either agree or disagree with the statement “I 
have control over when and how much I sleep” (strongly 
agree, agree, unsure, disagree and strongly disagree). The 
outcome  was  dichotomised  to  “Perceived  control  over 
sleep” (those who responded strongly agree or agree) and 
“No  perceived  control  over  sleep”  (those  who  responded 
unsure, disagree and strongly disagree).

Mental health symptoms
Depressive  symptoms:  Patient  Health  Questionnaire 
(PHQ-9)

The  PHQ-9  is  a  validated  tool  for  identifying  depres-
sive  symptoms  in  the  general  population23)  and  consists 
of nine items, which correspond to the DSM-5 criteria for 
depression24). Scores range from 0–27, with 0–4 indicating 
no depressive symptoms, 5–9 mild depressive symptoms, 
10–14 moderate depressive symptoms, 15–19 moderately-
severe depression, and 20–27 severe depression23).

10, and 15, represent cut off points for mild, moderate, and 
severe anxiety, respectively. When compared to structured 
psychiatric  interviews,  the  GAD-7  is  considered  a  valid 
and reliable tool for identifying generalised anxiety disor-
der26).

Data analysis

Data  were  analysed  using  R27)  and  R  Studio28). To  ex-
amine between group differences in sociodemographic and 
mental health outcomes between i) students at risk of sleep 
disorder vs. those not at risk of sleep disorder and ii) stu-
dents who perceived control over their sleep vs those who 
did  not  perceive  control  over  their  sleep,  were  assessed 
using  t-tests  and  χ2  tests. As  the  mental  health  outcomes 
of interest (PHQ-9) and (GAD-7) are often non-normally 
distributed  in  accordance  with  previous  analyses11),  and 
the sample size is modest29), robust regression analysis30) 
using M estimates were conducted using the MASS pack-
age30).  First,  robust  linear  models  were  conducted  to  ex-
amine the effect of being at risk of sleep disorder (yes/no) 
and perceived control over sleep (yes/no) on mental health 
symptoms,  while  accounting  for  covariates  of  age,  sex 
(Male or Female), and shift working status (working shift 
work or not working shift work). Secondly, analysis of the 
potential modifying effect or perceived control over sleep 
on the association between sleep disorder risk and mental 
health symptoms was conducted utilising robust regression 
models  by  specifying  an  interaction  term  between  sleep 
disorder risk perceived control over sleep while adjusting 
for sex, age and shift working status. Additional analyses 
with inclusion of year of study and employment status in 
the  final  model  did  not  meaningfully  change  estimates, 
and are not reported due to the sample size.

Covariates  were  chosen  due  to  their  potential  relation-
ship  with  the  exposure  variables  and/or  outcomes  vari-
ables, and in accordance with previous studies11).

characteristics and mental health symptoms in the sample 
are  presented  in Table  1. The  majority  of  participants 
(94.3%) were enrolled in full-time study, and employment 
status was primarily causal (67.9%), with 24.5% (n=13) of 
employed  students  indicating  they  were  already  working 
shift work. The mean age (± standard deviation) of partici-
pants was 22.7 (± 8.0) yr.

Sleep disorder risk and mental health symptoms

Both  anxiety  and  depressive  symptom  scores  were 
higher, indicative of poorer mental health, in students who 
were  at  risk  for  a  common  sleep  disorder.  Specifically, 
being at risk for a sleep disorder (n=21, 38.2%) was asso-
ciated with higher anxiety scores (β=3.3, 95% CI: 0.7, 6.0, 
p=0.011)  and  higher  depression  scores  (β=6.0,  95%  CI: 
3.6, 8.4, p<0.001) compared those who were not at risk of 
sleep disorder (n=32, 60.4%; Table 1, and Fig. 1).

Perceived control over sleep and mental health symptoms

Paramedicine  students  who  perceived  they  had  control 
over  their  sleep  (n=31,  58.5%)  had  lower  scores  for 
depressive (β=−3.0, 95% CI:−5.4, −0.6, p=0.011) but not 
anxiety (β=−2.0, 95% CI:−4.6, 0.6, p=0.13) symptoms in 

adjusted models (Table 2). Considering recognised cut off 
points  for  the  PHQ-9,  on  average  participants  reporting 
perceived  control  over  their  sleep  met  criteria  for  mild 
depression,  whereas  those  with  low  perceived  control, 
were approaching criteria for moderate depression (Fig. 1). 
As  shown  in  Fig.  1,  on  average,  students  with  perceived 
control  over  sleep  did  not  meet  criteria  for  mild  anxiety, 
in  contrast  to  those  without  perceived  control  over  sleep 
whose scores, on average, met the threshold for mild anxi-
ety.

Sleep  disorder  risk,  perceived  control  over  sleep,  and 
mental health symptoms

To  determine  whether  perceived  control  modified 
the  association  between  sleep  disorder  risk  and  mental 
health  symptoms,  an  adjusted  model  including  a  sleep 
disorder*control  interaction  term  was  conducted.  Per-
ceived  control  over  sleep  did  not  modify  the  association 
between sleep disorder risk and either depressive (p=0.28) 
or  anxiety  (p=0.55)  symptom  scores  (Table  3). A  sig-
nificant  main  effect  of  sleep  disorder  risk  (p=0.011)  and 
perceived  control  over  sleep  (p=0.013)  remained  in  this 
model for depressive symptoms, but not for anxiety.

M EVANS et al.Discussion

Meeting criteria for a sleep disorder was associated with 
poorer mental health symptoms in paramedicine students, 
reflected as higher depressive and anxiety symptom scores. 
Further, students who perceived they had low control over 
their  sleep  reported  higher  depressive  and  anxiety  symp-
toms scores, but no moderation effect of perceived control 
over sleep was observed. Together, these findings suggest 
that underlying sleep disorder risk and low perceived con-
trol over sleep are associated with poorer mental health in 
paramedic students, which could potentially impact health 
and safety outcomes once they commence employment.

Students who met criteria for a common sleep disorder 
had moderate depressive and mild anxiety symptom scores 
compared to students who did not meet criteria for a sleep 
disorder. These  findings  are  consistent  with  findings  in 
practicing paramedics, where a relationship between poor-
er mental health and sleep disorders has been reported3, 10). 
Early  screening  and  management  of  sleep  disorders  may 
support improved outcomes. This is particularly important 
given  the  high  rate  of  undiagnosed  sleep  disorders  in  the 
broader population of young Australian adults12).

Our  reported  relationship  between  sleep  disorder  risk 
and both depressive and anxiety symptoms scores observed 
in  paramedicine  students  is  consistent  with  prior  research 
in representative samples of similarly aged young adults31, 
32).  In Australia,  20%  of  young  adults  meet  criteria  for  a 
sleep  disorder  that  requires  intervention12),  and  >80%  are 
undiagnosed11). Findings from young adults in the general 
population  suggest  that  many  do  not  perceive  a  problem 
with their sleep, despite meeting criteria for a sleep disor-
der12). This  may  impact  help  seeking  for  sleep  disorders; 
which  is  already  known  to  be  poor  in  broader  shift  work 
populations. This  is  concerning,  as  paramedic  students 
(and students entering healthcare more broadly) will most 
likely be required to work shift work, and the combination 
of  sleep  disorder  risk  and  shift  work  could  contribute  to 
increased  health  safety  risks.  Given  recent  longitudinal 
findings  suggest  that  paramedics  who  start  employment 
with poor sleep are at risk of poorer mental health early in 
their careers33), there is a strong case for intervening dur-
ing  the  tertiary  education  period  to  better  support  mental 
wellbeing in our future paramedic workforce.

Our  study  provides  new  insight  into  the  relationship 
between  perceived  control  over  sleep  and  mental  health 
symptoms  in  paramedic  students,  suggesting  that  lack  of 
perceived  control  over  sleep  may  not  only  impact  sleep 
opportunity,  as  seen  in  previous  studies34),  but  may  also 

413

be  related  to  mental  health  symptoms.  It  is  plausible  that 
these  represent  two  distinct  aspects  of  poor  sleep  health 
which  are  important  to  address  with  future  healthcare 
workers—that  is,  clinical  sleep  disorders,  and  broader 
psychosocial factors which influence sleep opportunities.

Paramedic work is associated with considerable occupa-
tional  demands  and  exposure  risk  (e.g.,  trauma  exposure, 
physical  demands,  interpersonal  conflicts,  exposure  to 
communicable illness, long hours etc)1), therefore it is un-
surprising that paramedic work is associated with changes 
in sleep35) and mental health outcomes3, 4). This pilot work 
addresses  the  limited  consideration  of  sleep  disorder  risk 
and  associations  with  mental  health  symptoms  in  para-
medic students to date. Studies of intern paramedics (i.e., 
those who have completed their studies and are beginning 
work  as  paramedic)  suggest  that  commencing  paramedic 
work with higher depression scores predicts a greater odds 
of  shift  work  disorder  risk5). Thus,  those  students  who 
begin  work  with  higher  depressive  symptoms  may  be  at 
increased risk when exposed to the additional stressors of 
paramedic work1). When considering our current findings 
that  some  students  may  have  pre-existing  sleep  disorder 
risk and mental health concerns before they transition into 
their  paramedic  roles,  our  study  points  to  an  opportunity 
to  intervene  on  sleep  and  sleep  disorder  risk  before  the 
transition  to  paramedic  work. This  could  include  educa-
tion, and potentially screening and management pathways, 
before the transition into ongoing employment3, 4).

These  findings  should  be  considered  in  light  of  some 
study limitations. Within the current cross-sectional work it 
was not possible to examine causal relationships between 
sleep  disorder  risk  and  mental  health  symptoms.  Future 
longitudinal studies are needed which explore sleep disor-
ders  and  broader  healthy  sleep  habits  prior  to  paramedic 
work  onset,  in  order  to  better  identify  the  emergence  of 
sleep disorder risk and mental health symptoms over time. 
Nonetheless, sleep disorders and mental health symptoms 
can  often  be  improved  by  the  same  treatments36–38)  and 
thus,  early  sleep  intervention  may  be  beneficial  for  this 
population. In the meantime, including education on sleep 
disorders,  social  and  behavioural  factors  related  to  sleep 
and  mental  health  as  part  of  undergraduate  paramedicine 
programs is likely to be beneficial, and has been suggested 
by early- and mid-career paramedics in Australia39). Given 
that  shift  work  is  a  largely  unavoidable  component  of 
paramedic  careers,  supporting  workers  to  identify  and 
manage poor sleep in these careers is important.

This  pilot  work  was  conducted  in  a  modest  sample  at 
one  tertiary  education  site,  and  may  not  be  generalisable 

SLEEP DISORDERS AND MENTAL HEALTH IN PARAMEDICINE STUDENTS414

to  other  paramedicine  student  populations.  Students  who 
completed this study were aware there was  a potential to 
be involved in a sleep screening and management interven-
tion, which may have prompted students with more severe 
sleep symptoms to self-select into the study. Recognising 
that the study design may have influenced findings, further 
research  with  a  broader  participant  base,  for  example  a 
cohort  study  with  paramedic  students  investigating  sleep 
and mental health, may be worthwhile in future.

The  present  study  did  not  investigate  potential  mental 
health  risk  factors  such  as  social  support,  family  history 
of  psychiatric  disease  and  trauma  exposure,  which  could 
be  considered  in  future  studies. We  also  were  not  able 
to  explore  associations  with  specific  sleep  disorders  due 
to  our  modest  sample  size.  Our  data  were  obtained  for 
this  study  through  validated  self-report  measures  which 
allowed  students  to  respond  anonymously,  and  sleep  dis-
order diagnoses were not confirmed by clinical interview. 
Future studies may consider structured clinical interviews 
and  objective  night-to-night  measures  of  sleep40)  to  as-
sess  both  sleep  disorders  and  mental  health  problems. 
Finally, we did not investigate why students felt that they 
lacked control over their sleep. Given the relationships we 
observed, further consideration of factors which influence 
perceived  control  over  sleep  will  be  required  in  order  to 
inform meaningful interventions.

Conclusion

The current study provides new insight into the associa-
tion between risk of sleep disorders, perceived control over 
sleep  and  mental  health  symptoms  in  paramedicine  stu-
dents. Poor sleep and mental health symptoms are known 
to  impact  young  working  adults,  which  is  concerning  for 
those  who  will  be  experiencing  additional  occupational 
risk factors which further disrupt sleep, such as shift work. 
Encouragingly, sleep disorders represent a modifiable risk 
factor for improving health and safety if adequately identi-
fied  and  treated.  Early  interventions  to  support  optimised 
sleep  and  mental  health  before  transition  to  employment 
are  likely  to  benefit  our  future  healthcare  workforce, 
including  paramedics.  In  order  to  provide  early  support 
for paramedicine students’ sleep and mental health, further 
research  into  the  relationship  between  sleep  disorders, 
perceived control over sleep, and mental health symptoms 
in paramedic students is recommended to inform feasible 
and  acceptable  management  approaches  for  this  group  of 
future shift workers.
