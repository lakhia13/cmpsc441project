School Avoidance From the Point of View  
of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry

Symptomatology, Development, Course, and Treatment

Martin Knollmann, Susanne Knoll, Volker Reissner, Jana Metzelaars, Johannes Hebebrand

SUMMARY
Background: A considerable percentage of children and 
adolescents who avoid school have mental illnesses. This 
article reviews the typical manifestations, classification, 
development, course, and treatment of school-avoiding 
behavior. 

Methods: Based on a selective review of recent literature, 
we present findings on the psychopathologically relevant 
features of school-avoid ing children and adolescents, 
 including psychiatric diagnoses, developmental, familiy-
related, and psychological test variables. The emphasis is 
placed on our own studies of the subject.

Results: Although the evidence from the studies that have 
been performed to date is not definitive, the available find-
ings show that school avoidance is associated with poor 
mental health and with unfavorable consequences onward 
into adulthood. Its causes include a number of individual 
and social stressors that place  excessive demands on the 
affected children and adolescents and lead them to avoid 
school as a coping attempt.

Conclusions: Many preventive and therapeutic interventions 
are now available, but the existing measures need to be 
better coordinated, and more effort needs to be directed to 
the early recognition and treatment of school-avoiding 
 behavior. Physicians should consider the possibility of 
mental illness. Rather than writing sick notes or prescribing 
mother-child treatments at health resorts, which rather 
tend to sustain the problem, they should refer patients 
promptly to a child and adolescent psychiatrist.

U p to 60% of students at secondary schools in Ger-

many report having avoided attending school for 
several  hours  or  even  a  whole  day  over  the  course  of 
their schooling so far (1). However, school avoidance 
gains importance in terms of child and adolescent psy-
chiatry only when it occurs to a notably greater degree 
and  is  accompanied  by  psychiatric  symptoms.  This 
 article aims to review the findings on the psychopath-
ologically relevant features of children and adolescents 
who  avoid  school.  In  view  of  the  available  recent 
 review  articles  (2–6,  e1)  and  the  scarcity  of  available 
data in Germany, the  emphasis lies on the more recent, 
mostly  English  language,  literature  and  the  results  of 
two of the authors’ own recent studies (7, 8).

Symptoms, classification, and prevalence
The term “school avoidance” (e2) is used in this article 
to  describe  absences  from  school  that  are  associated 
with  psychiatric  symptoms.  The  literature  further  dif-
ferentiates between truancy (deliberately not attending 
school) without anxiety symptoms and anxiety related 
school refusal (Figure 1). The latter is further subcat-
egorized  into  school  related  anxieties  (test  anxiety, 
 social  phobias)  and  separation  anxiety  (fear  of  being 
separated from a parent or loved carer) (Figure 1) (9). 
A  close  association  is  assumed  between  conduct 
 disorders and truancy on the one hand, and on the other 
hand between school refusal and anxiety disorder and 
other emotional disorders (2). There are indications that 
school  avoiders  may  have  symptoms  covering  the 
 entire  range  of  child  and  adolescent  psychiatric  dis-
orders  (8)  and  that  substantial  overlaps  exist  between 
school refusers and truants (Figure 1). A study that is 
representative for the US (10) found a greater extent of 
conduct disorders than of emotional disorders in truants 
 than in school refusers (and vice versa), but the highest 
rate of psychiatric disorders was seen in children with a 
mixture of truancy and school refusal. The frequency of 
psychiatric diagnoses differs depending on the type of 
sample  under  consideration  (clinical  sample:  up  to 
90%, representative samples: up to 24.5 %) (2).

It  is  difficult  to  estimate  the  prevalence  of  school 
avoiding  behavior  because  different  definitions  and 
data collection methods are in use (1, 2). Most authors 
assume  a  proportion  of  5%  to  10%  of  regular  school

Classification of school avoidance

avoiders in Germany, whose school absences reach “a 
substantial  extent”  (3,  11,  12).  School  avoidance  is 
 notably more common in adolescents than in children. 
Individual  studies  have  shown  that  boys  are  affected 
more  often  than  girls,  at  a  ratio  of  2:1  (2,  3).  The 
 highest rates of school avoidance are seen in secondary 
general  schools  (Hauptschulen)  and  schools  catering 
for  special  needs  (Sonderschulen)  (11),  but  no  school 
type  is  exempt  from  the  phenomenon.  The  current 
National Report on Education shows that the number of 
school leavers without a final graduation certificate in 
Germany  (in  2006:  about  76 000;  i.e.  about  8%  of 
every  year)  is  still  high  compared  with  the  rest  of 
 Europe  (13);  a  higher  proportion  of  these  youngsters 
may be assumed to avoid school. Although proportion-
ally  more  students  from  (im)migrant  families  leave 
school  without  graduating  (13),  no  clear  indications 
exist that school avoidance prior to school drop out is 
more  common  in  these  students  (1).  In  interpreting 
studies  with  positive  findings  in  this  regard  (e3,  e4), 
possible  confounding  by  socioeconomic  status  should 
be  considered (6, e5, e6).

Course
Most studies have shown an increase in school refusal 
between  the  5th  and  6th  as  well  as  the  10th  and  11th 
year  of  life.  By  contrast,  truancy  typically  occurs  for 
the  first  time  at  the  age  of  about  11  and  increases 
 between  the  13th  and  17th  years  of  life  (2,  10,  11). 

44 

Whereas  anxiety  related  school  refusal  dominates 
 during  childhood,  the  range  of  disorders  widens 
 substantially with the onset of adolescence (5). Truancy 
is prognostically associated with an increased risk for 
social problems, such as:

● School failure (odds ratio [OR]=4.6)
● Unemployment (OR=2.4)
● Drug misuse (OR=2.2)
● Delinquency (OR=4.0) (e7).
Anxiety  related  school  refusal  is  primarily  associ-
ated  with  the  continued  existence  or  development  of 
psychiatric disorders (OR=3.1) (14). 

Prognostically favorable factors include:
● Acute onset of symptoms
● Younger age at symptom onset
● Less time spent absent from school
● Early diagnosis and treatment
● Lower psychiatric morbidity
● Lesser extent of avoidance (15).
Conversely, the risk of symptoms becoming chronic 
increases  when  help  is  not  given  rapidly  and  the  so-
called protective factors are lacking (Box 1).

The  unfavorable  effects  of  school  avoidance  on 
children’s  or  adolescents’  further  development  are 
 obvious:  School  attendance  and  subsequent  employ-
ment are important to ensure not only their future finan-
cial  security  but  also  their  participation  in  social  life 
and activities, and to establish social contacts. School 
and employment further provide a useful and beneficial 
structure  for  people’s  daily  lives.  In  spite  of  these 
 obvious  connections,  studies  of  youth  unemployment 
have only rarely investigated the topic of school avoid-
ance in the subjects’ histories (16). In the context of the 
collaboration  project  “SUPPORT  25”,  unemployed 
people younger than 25 in whom psychiatric disorders 
are  suspected  are  offered  psychiatric  diagnosis  and 
 advice  at  short  notice  (7).  97.6%  of  those  examined 
(n=165, 96 female; mean age=21) had at least a psychi-
atric  Axis  I  disorder  according  to  ICD-10.  School 
avoiders—individuals  who  during  their  school  years 
remained absent from lessons for at least a month (30% 
of  the  participants)—significantly  more  often  left 
school without graduating and also sought psychiatric 
help before their 18th year of life more often. The trend 
was  also  for  school  avoiders  to  seek  psychiatric  care 
more  often  once  they  had  reached  legal  age  and  they 
more often displayed conduct disorders as per a retro-
spective  lifetime  diagnosis.  Further,  school  avoiders 
 responded more pessimistically to the question on the 
likelihood of finding a job and starting gainful employ-
ment within the coming 2 years. 

Development 
School refusal should not be reduced to medical or psy-
chological aspects but is always embedded in complex 
social conditions. The available findings give credence 
to the assumption that factors such as parenting style, 
relative poverty, living in socially disadvantaged areas, 
attitudes to schooling, and the school system itself all 
have an  influence (2, 6, 10, 17). Psychological models

of  the  development  of  school  avoidance  emphasize 
 interactions between family related, school related, and 
individual  variables.  For  truancy,  parallels  have  been 
shown  with  etiological  models  of  conduct  disorder 
(e8), for school refusal the parallels were with models 
of  the  development  of  anxiety  disorders  (9).  At  the 
same time, there are many common factors (Figure 2), 
which will be explained on the basis of relevant studies 
and  the  authors’  own  findings  from  a  sample  of  89 
 patients  (42  female;  mean  age=14.4).  These  patients 
 attended  a  child  and  adolescent  psychiatric  outpatient 
clinic  specializing  in  school  avoidance/refusal  (8). 
 Accordingly, school avoidance should be interpreted as 
a reaction to being overchallenged in the school, peer, 
and family contexts, which develops on a background 
of individual vulnerabilities. 

School context and peer context
Of  all  patients  in  the  authors’  own  sample,  11.2% 
 attended  a  school  for  children  with  special  needs 
 (Sonderschule),  34.8%  secondary  general  school 
(Hauptschule),  and  23.6%  comprehensive  school 
(Gesamt schule).  51.6%  had  repeated  a  class  at  least 
once. 61.8% had switched to lower-grade schools (with 
the exception of one case, where the student moved to a 
higher-grade  school).  These  data,  which  significantly 
differ from those of representative non-clinical samples 
(8), confirm other findings according to which school 
avoiders typically have a school career that is charac-
terized  by  failures  (1,  15,  17).  Further,  the  peer-
 relationships of school avoiders are often characterized 
by  conflict  (6,  10,  17).  Truants  often  have  contact  to 
 deviant  youth  groups  (18),  whereas  school  refusers 
often  have  problems  with   social  integration.  In  the 
authors’ own sample, 22.5% of patients describe them-
selves as victims of bullying; 33.7% were categorized 
as altogether poorly socially integrated. These data are 
roughly  consistent  with  those  of  international  studies 
(6, 19). Some studies have pointed out that, further to 
experiences  of  violence  or  social  exclusion,  another 
factor contributing to school avoidance may also be the 
subjective experience of the school atmosphere as bad 
(6, 17, e9). Factors that may play a part in this context 
include:

● School size and class size
● The  relationships  between  teachers,  principals, 

and students

● Cooperation between school and parents 
● Teachers’ monitoring of students’ absence (6, 17, 

e3).

stresses figured even more prominently (8, 19). Further 
familial risk factors include:

● Low socioeconomic status of the parents
● Unemployment
● Frequent relocations
● Low parental control
● Social isolation of the family
● Complex/convoluted  or  emotionally  distant 

family relationships

● Frequent family conflicts (5, 10, 11, 17, 19, e12).
In  truanting  children,  the  dominating  stress  factors 
are associated with low socioeconomic status, whereas 
school  refusers  tend  to  have  a  higher  proportion  of 
mentally ill parents (3, 10). Generally, school avoiders 
seem  to  be  exposed  to  more  stressful  life  events  (20) 
than others. 

Family context
The proportion of children who were affected by their 
parents’  separation  in  the  authors’  own  sample  was 
 significantly  higher  (60.5%)  than  in  representative 
samples  (about  19%)  (e10).  The  frequency  of  severe 
physical  (29.2%)  and  mental  (14.6%)  parental  illness 
(e11) in our sample also underlines the importance of 
family stresses. In comparable studies with populations 
of school avoiding patients from specialized child and

39.1%  of  the  authors’  own  patients  had  a  lower  than

association  merely  between  truancy  and  low  intelli-
gence  (17),  many  school  avoiders  have  reported 
 problems with school performance before they started 
avoiding school (19). This indicates potential cognitive

Case report of a female school refuser

Reason for presentation: A 14 year old female patient consulted a special mobile child and adolescent psychiatric service at 
a secondary general school (Hauptschule) for several problems: irregular school attendance (she missed roughly every other 
day, her performance had suffered, she reported performance anxieties), which the patient and her mother explained with 
strong somatization (nausea, vomiting, raised temperature, breathlessness without a physical cause), disturbed sleep, and bul-
lying at school. The symptoms were reported to have started in the girl’s 5th year at school.

Family history: Three close relatives had died within a year, including the girl’s father; the mother became severely ill; the fa -
ther had been an alcoholic and had been violent; the mother has had a new partner for a short while; several adult half-siblings 
on both the mother’s and the father’s side

Patient’s own history: The mother’s pregnancy was noticed only in the 6th month of gestation; the birth was uneventful; early 
feeding disorder; developmental milestones normal; from the age of 2 1/2 years the patient had visited a day nursery and inte-
grated well; started school at 6 years of age, performance good to moderate; a move into a different town necessitated a 
change in school; at the new school the patient was often picked on; another house move and change in school owing to the 
mother’s illness; 2nd year repeated; a third relocation into a new town, 3rd and 4th years attended at a new school; bullied by 
fellow students; move to secondary general school, poor social integration, bullying, start of school refusal; in 2008 the family 
moved to the mother’s new partner’s home and the patient changed school again (secondary general school), currently in her 
7th year

Diagnosis from psychological testing: Average IQ, self assessment (Youth Self Report, YSR) noticeable with regard to 
phys ical complaints, assessment by her mother (Child Behavior Checklist, CBCL) noticeable with regard to physical 
 complaints, anxiety/depres sion, social problems, aggressive behavior, anxiety and depression questionnaire normal. 

Suspected diagnoses: Somatoform disorder (F45.0V); specific phobic disorder (F40.2V).

Recommendation: Inpatient admission for more thorough diagnostic evaluation, initiating inpatient or outpatient psychothera-
peutic treatment

overchallenges  owing  to  misplacement  in  the  wrong 
type of school (17); in individual cases, above average 
intelligence  should  be  considered  (e13,  e14).  The  au -
thors’ sample also yielded indications from psychologi-
cal 
that  attention  deficit  disorders  may 
 contribute to the lack of success at school especially in 
truants; other studies have found that specific develop-
mental  disorders  of  scholastic  skills  contribute  to  the 
development of school avoidance (21).

testing 

Pre-existing  relevant  child  and  adolescent  psychi-
atric disorders may be assumed to contribute substan-
tially to the individual factors even before a child starts 
to avoid school (Figure 2). In their histories, 20.2% of 
patients in the authors’ sample had internalizing symp-
toms  and  23.6%  had  externalizing  symptoms  before 
starting to avoid school (8). Recent studies have shown 
that physical disorders such as asthma (6, e15) or obe -
sity (e16–e18) are associated with absenteeism.

Diagnosis and treatment
The  most  important  treatment  objective  in  school 
avoidance  is  the  resumption  of  school  attendance. 
 Doctor’s  sickness  certificates  for  any  psychosomatic 
complaints  (Figure  1)  are  contraindicated  because 
they  increase  school  avoidance  (by  legitimizing  the 
absence)  and  thus  contribute  to  making  it  a  chronic 
problem.

diagnostic  clue  is  the  occurrence  of  symptoms  in  the 
morning  or  even  on  the  preceding  evening  and  their 
 absence at weekends or during holidays. In individual 
cases, parents changed their doctors often in order to be 
able  to  obtain  repeated  sick  notes.  It  also  should  be 
time-
that  conducting 
borne 
 consuming, and costly physical diagnostic tests without 
including  psychological  factors  in  the  diagnostic 
 considerations  bears  the  risk  of  chronification  of  the 
problem.

In  child  and  adolescent  psychiatry,  the  diagnosis 
 includes—in addition to an extensive exploration of the 
child  and  its  parents/carers—a  psychological  test  for 
possible  intellectual  underchallenge  or  overchallenge 
and  specific  developmental  disorders  of  scholastic 
skills.  Questionnaire  methods  and  structured  clinical 
interviews  are  used  to  assess  the  key  symptoms  (21, 
e19) and to capture comorbid disorders. Kearney (22, 
e20, e21) distinguished between 4 functions of school 
avoidance:

● Attention seeking behavior/separation anxiety
● Avoidance of negative affect
● Positive reinforcement outside school
● Avoidance of exams and socially stressful situations.
These  points  should  be  captured  in  a  questionnaire 
(e21, e22) and used as supporting  information in treat-
ment selection. 

Pediatricians and primary care physicians should be 
familiar with the relevant symptoms (Box 2). The main

and family centered methods to reduce anxiety related

avoidance behavior (23, e23, e24). Several studies have 
shown  the  efficacy  of  cognitive  behavioral  ther-
apies—also  in  combination  with  antidepressant  drug 
treatment  (imipramine)  (3,  6,  e25).  To  date,  however, 
only  few  randomized,   controlled  evaluation  studies 
(evidence level Ib) have been conducted; superiority to 
other  treatments  and   increased  efficacy  if  the  parents 
are  included  has  not  been  consistently  shown  (3, 
e26–e28). For the treatment of truancy which is associ-
ated  with  dissocial   behaviour,  controlled  evaluation 
studies  are  lacking  to  date  (6).  In  view  of  the  often 
overlapping internalizing and externalizing symptoms, 
Kearney et al. (e29)  recommend integrated treatment of 
all  school  avoiders,  which  should  be  oriented  to  the 
functional profile of the school avoiding behavior. 

Especially  in  chronic  cases,  outpatient  treatment  is 
often not sufficient. In 20.2% of patients in the authors’ 
own sample, inpatient treatment or a combination of    in 
and  outpatient  treatment  was  recommended  (8).  A 
 recent  evaluation  study  has  shown  good  effects  9 
months  after  inpatient  treatment  had  been  concluded 
(e30).  Follow-up  studies  over  a  longer  time  period, 
however, have shown that at least one third of school 
avoiding patients display mental problems later in life 
(3, 6, 14, 24, e31–e33). Exclu sively psychiatric therapy 
is thus usually insufficient (6). For the individual case, 
a   support  system  should  be  established  that  should 
 include school, child and youth services, and pediatri-
cians  and  primary  care  physicians.  In  recent  years,  a 
multitude of such model projects has been implemented 
(e34).  In  2006,  the  German  federal  government  initi-
ated the program “Schulverweigerung – Die 2. Chance 
[School  Avoidance—A  Second  Chance]”  (25),  in 
whose context coordination posts were set up in more 
than  150  sites.  Case  managers  in  those  sites  establish 
contact with school avoiders; the primary objective is 
reintegration into school. If this is unrealistic then those 
affected are given the option of graduating outside the 
regular  school  system.  These  projects  have  not  been 
systematically evaluated to date. 

Conclusions and outlook
The  large  number  of  adolescents  who  leave  school 
without  graduating  underlines  the  need  for  political 
 action. The symptoms of school avoidance have to be 
taken very seriously in this context. The school system 
is  confronted  with  the  challenge  to  identify  such 
 students rapidly and initiate measures for their reinte-
gration.  In  order  to  execute  this  important  function 
properly,  schools  need  support.  The  authors  think  it 
would  be  ideal  for  affected  children  and  adolescents 
and their parents to be able to present to a team as early 
as  possi ble—with  the  team  consisting  of  an  indepen-
dent  teacher,  a  social  worker,  and  a  child  and  adoles-
cent psychiatrist. A task force of this kind could devel-
op  a  concept  for  reintegrating  the  patient  into  school 
while considering the interdisciplinary diagnosis, and it 
could  supervise  its  implementation.  Bearing  in  mind 
the high financial follow-on costs of school avoidance, 
the expense of such measures seems more than justified.

Pathogenesis of school avoiding behavior

BOX 2 

Reasons for presenting to a doctor and findings 
from the histories of patients with anxiety related 
school avoidance

Reasons for presenting to a doctor

Continuing physical symptoms that necessitate absence from school or occur in 
school: pallor, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache, stomach pains, chest 
pains, joint pains, backache, loss of appetite, diarrhea, need to urinate frequently. 
Onset of symptoms is often gradual without any definite reasons; occasionally 
abrupt onset of symptoms 

Medical history and findings

Complaints occur at certain times: in the morning, sometimes in the evening. 
They disappear or reduce in severity at weekends or during term breaks; parents 
may make a concerted effort to persuade their children to attend school; school 
attendance often most difficult after the weekend, less so on specific school days

Family history: May be positive for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, 
 somatoform and/or psychiatric disorders of the parents/carers. Family deaths? 
Relocations, other stressors?

Patient’s own history: Separation anxiety in kindergarten or on starting school, 
problems with school performance, sometimes occurring comorbidly with 
somato form disorder; changing school; family stressors, school or peer group; 
social isolation

Psychological/psychiatric finding: No pronounced antisocial behavior, occa-
sionally symptoms of depression or anxiety 

Compliance: Large differences between individuals and families in the extent to 
which they are willing to deal with the problem

This hypothesis should be tested and proved by means 
of relevant evaluations.

Physicians  should  be  familiar  with  the  physical 
symptoms and psychiatric disorders that are associated 
with  anxiety  related  school  avoidance  (Figure  1,  Box 
2).  If  initial  diagnostic  testing  for  physical  disorders 
does not yield any pathological findings or if the find-
ings  are  unclear,  then—rather  than  (or  in  parallel  to) 
further  time  consuming  and  costly  physical  investi-
gations  (risk  of  the  problem  becoming  chronic)—an 
 initial  exploration  of  psychiatric  disorders  should  be 
undertaken (leading questions: see Figure 1 and Box 2) 
and early referral to a child and adolescent psychiatrist 
should be instigated. Doctors’ sickness certificates and 
prescription  of  “Mutter  und  Kind  Kuren”  (a  medical 
service that is covered by the statutory health insurers 
and offers 3 weeks of residential care to mothers [and 
their children if these cannot be looked after at home]) 
increase  the  symptoms  and  are  contraindicated.  Child 
and  adolescent  psychiatrists  are  tasked  with  offering 
and establishing special consultations with short wait-
ing  times  for  school  avoiders.  The  effectiveness  of 
 mobile  consultations  at  schools  and  in  institutions 
 catering  for  young  people  should  also  be  studied. 
 Research is needed into the role of child and adolescent 
psychiatric  disorders,  psychosocial  and  school  related 
risk factors in the development of school avoidance and 
its effects in the medium and long term.

KEY MESSAGES

● School avoiding behavior can be categorized into 
anxiety related school refusal and truancy (often 
 accompanied by conduct disorders), but large overlaps 
exist between these two groups.

● The estimated prevalence of pronounced school avoid-
ance is 5–10%. It is unclear thus far how many of those 
affected have psychological impairments; a high rate of 
clinically relevant symptoms have been found in clinical 
samples.

● School avoidance usually develops from different stress 

factors that accumulate in the family setting (for 
example, separation of the parents), in school (for 
example, overchallenge), and in the peer context (for 
example, bullying), which in turn aggravate existing 
weaknesses (for example, specific developmental dis-
orders of scholastic skills)

● In view of the often chronic course of school avoidance, 
early diagnosis by child and adolescent psychiatrists is 
recommended. A referral should be made especially if 
school avoidance is accompanied by somatic com-
plaints of unknown origin (for example, stomach pains, 
nausea, headaches, dizziness).

● A doctor’s sickness certificate for psychosomatic com-

plaints and a prescription for a period of residential care 
for mothers and children are usually inadvisable, since 
these measures increase school avoiding behavior. In 
many cases, child and adolescent psychiatric treatment 
on an outpatient or inpatient basis is indicated in order 
to reduce anxiety related avoidance behaviors.
