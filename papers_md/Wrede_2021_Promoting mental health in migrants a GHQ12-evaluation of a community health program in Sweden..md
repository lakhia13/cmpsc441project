program in Sweden

Abstract
Background: Research increasingly highlight post-migration factors for migrants’ mental health status. We
investigated the association between participation in a health promotion program and changes in migrants’ mental
health, and if socio-demographic factors and length of time in the new home country, Sweden, influenced a
potential association.
Methods: A five-week health promotion program named ‘Hälsostöd’ [Health Support], led by community health
workers, was offered to migrants, primarily asylum seekers and newly arrived immigrants (N = 202). The framework
for the program was salutogenic psycho-education, which focused on health effects of migration experiences,
lifestyle and health, and the health care system. Mental health was measured at the start and end of the program.
We analysed this follow up by using the recommended clinical cut off (i.e. > 11 of maximum 36, with higher scores
indicating possible mental illness) in the 12- item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12). Chi Square
test was used to analyse statistical significance of changes, and multinomial logistic regression to analyse
associations to sociodemographic factors and length of stay in Sweden.
Results: The number of participants scoring above the clinical cut off after participation in the program (N = 79,
39.1%) was lower compared to the corresponding number before participation (N = 111, 55.0%), Chi Square = 10.17,
p < .001. The majority of the participants had no change 72.3 (N = 146), 21.8% (N = 44) had a positive change, yet
5.9% (N = 12) had a negative change, compared to before participation in the program. None of the investigated
sociodemographic factors showed to significantly influence the association. Length of stay in Sweden was trending,
with participants with longer stay being more likely to have possible mental illness.
Conclusion: We conclude that psycho-educative programs, similar to ‘Hälsostöd’, have potential for promoting
asylum seekers’ and newly arrived immigrants’ mental health as the evaluation showed a considerable number of
positive changes in participants. The result suggests the importance of offering immigrants health promotive
programs in close connection with arrival to the new home country. Future research should clarify under what
circumstances sociodemographic factors influence the effects of such programs.

Background
Between 2014 and 2017, Europe experienced an in-
creased number of asylum seekers, and Sweden, specific-
ally, received the most asylum applications ever noted in
2016 [1, 2]. A large proportion came from conflict areas
such as Syria, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Congo, Afghanisation,
and Iraq [3]. The health risks within this group vary
greatly depending on, among other things, the type of
conflict related experiences and the living conditions in
refugee camps. Consequently, the WHO Regional office
for Europe has emphasized refugee and migrant health
as a priority area [4].

Existing studies indicate substantial

levels of mental
distress in this group [5–8], with several studies repeatedly
recording higher rates of non-psychotic psychiatric disorders
like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression and
anxiety as well as low levels of subjective mental well-being
[8–10]. In Sweden, a population-based prospective cohort
study showed a 33% increased risk of hospitalized depressive
disorders in foreign-born compared to Swedish-born indi-
viduals [11]. A higher prevalence of PTSD, suicide, and
psychotic disorders among migrants, compared to native
Swedes has also been reported [12]. The causes of these ad-
versities are multifaceted and include traumatic experiences
both before and during the migration process. Increasingly,
researchers also highlight post-migration factors for the
prevalence of mental disorders [8, 10, 13, 14]. Such post-
migration factors may include chronic stress in a new host
country related to family members well-being [15], uncer-
tainty regarding residence permit [16], a new language and
social norms [9, 10, 17]. However, researchers have noted
that the heterogeneity within this group makes it difficult to
draw any all-embracing conclusions on health risks and ap-
propriate interventions (e.g. [6, 10]).

A recent review concluded that in epidemiological
studies on refugees the focus on PTSD needs to be
accompanied by an increased focus on common mental
disorders, e.g., depression and anxiety [18]. The same
review also concluded that there is a need for studies
assessing the efficacy of psychosocial
interventions in
migrants [18]. Due to the heterogeneity of this group,
there is also a need to further investigate the associations
between sociodemographic factors as well as the changes
in participants’ mental health before and after taking
part
in psycho-educative programs. Among the few
existing studies of such correlations, age and years in the
new country of residence have been shown to relate to
migrants’ mortality ratios as compared to native-born.
For example, a U-shape pattern was observed between
migrant’s age and mortality, with excess mortality at
young age, lower mortality at adult age and a similar
mortality with natives at older age [19]. A Swedish study
showed that refugees who resided in Sweden for ten
years or more were more likely to experience psychological

distress, compared to those who arrived more recently [20].
Other studies suggest granted residence permit as positively
associated with refugees’ mental health [16, 21].

Interventions

long-term psycho-educational

A societal response to mitigate health risks in this
group includes a strengthened focus on tailored interventions
with,
for example, trauma focused cognitive behavioural
therapy and multidisciplinary treatments [10, 17, 22–24]. In
reviews of such interventions [ibid.], authors conclude
that
interventions and
field oriented, pragmatic and multidisciplinary approaches
are needed to further improve refugee’s mental health.
focus on mental disorders

in
migrants with refugee background comprise both clinical
and health promotive interventions. Where more thera-
peutic interventions in clinical settings focus on severe
conditions like PTSD [24], health promotive interven-
tions rather focus on increasing subjective well-being
and preventing common mental disorders (e.g. depres-
sion and anxiety). Such salutogenic interventions, often
depart from the concepts of ‘sense of coherence’ [25]
and ‘coping’ [26], and aim to strengthen the participants’
health literacy, i.e. their ability to understand and benefi-
cially handle their own living situation [27].

With the goal to support the considerable number of
asylum seekers arriving in Sweden 2016, the Swedish
government expanded existing mental health promotive
programs and developed new ones in line with the
salutogenic theories mentioned above. One of the most
ambitious projects was ‘Hälsa i Sverige’
[Health in
Sweden] [28], a national program consisting of educa-
tion for health care staff, health care information di-
rected at immigrants, and ‘Hälsostöd’ [Health Support],
a five-session psycho-educative program aiming to promote
immigrant’s mental health. Of the various components of
the ‘Hälsa i Sverige’-project, the authorities within Region
Västra Götaland decided to primarily focus on ‘Hälsostöd’
(see Method for details).

Study aim and objectives
The aim of the current study was to investigate the ef-
fectiveness of the ‘Hälsostöd’ program on participants’
mental health status. The objectives were to (1) assess the
association between partaking in the ‘Hälsostöd’ program
and changes in participants’ mental health, and (2) to
assess if sociodemographic factors and time in Sweden
influenced such association.

Methods
Study setting and population
The ‘Hälsostöd’ program was initiated in May 2017 in
Region Västra Götaland, Sweden. At the time, 16,043
migrants were registered at the Migration Agency in this
region (4938 women and 11,105 men). Anyone with a
migrant background was welcomed to participate.

However, as the program started in response to the large
influx of refugees in this region, the main target groups
were asylum seekers and newly arrived immigrants with
milder mental health problems.

the

of attendees initiating the program were incomplete, the
program staff estimated that those who completed the
the
questionnaire, represented approximately 90% of
total attendees. Out of these 496, 319 also completed the
study questionnaire after the program. Consequently,
the study sample for the evaluation was 319 ‘Hälsostöd’
participants (see Table 1 for demographics). This means
that 177 dropped out between the first and second data
collection, equalling a 64% response rate. Most of the
dropouts were due to the target group’s mobility, i.e. re-
location to other geographical areas due to changes in

The aim of the ‘Hälsostöd’ program, which consisted
of five 2–3 h sessions (held once a week), is described in
its manual to: “strengthen a positive development of
mental health through providing the individual with
tools for coping with minor mental health issues”. The
sessions were led by community health workers, so
called health communicators, who themselves had mi-
grant backgrounds, some form of health care education
(e.g., nursing, pharmacy), additional training in group
dynamics and the ‘Hälsostöd’ content.

Around eight participants were included in each
‘Hälsostöd’ group. The program was held in the partici-
pants’ native language, in public venues such as libraries
and immigration centres, and was free of charge. Each
session had a specific topic: introduction; possible health
effects of migration; ways to identify and prevent stress
and depression; the health effects of lifestyle factors; and
the organization of the Swedish health care system. A
strong emphasis was placed on creating a safe space
where participants could talk freely about their experi-
ences and current situation. The role of
the health
communicators was to facilitate a trusting atmosphere,
to function as a bridge between the participants’ previ-
ous and current environment, and to adapt the health
messages to the respective cohort’s level of education,
needs, and interests. The intent was to encourage and
frame empowering discussions around set health topics
rather than to mediate unidirectional
information. In
sum, the program can be described as combining several
components of the salutogenic theory, a theory that
highlights promotion of mental health through increased
health literacy and ‘sense of coherence’ [25], and the op-
portunity to, together with peers, elaborate on personal
experiences [27].

Data collection and study procedure
The GHQ12, a shortened version of the General Health
Questionnaire, was developed to identify minor mental
health problems, e.g., symptoms of depression and anx-
iety or other symptoms in need of further clinical assess-
ment with the purpose of early identification of potential
psychiatric disorder [29]. It was available in Arabic, but
had to be translated (back-and-forth)
for Dari and
Somali. GHQ12 was chosen to evaluate this program as
it has been validated for identifying milder mental health
issues in many countries and populations [30–32], i.e. in
relation to such a heterogeneous group that was the
‘Hälsostöd’ target group. In addition, GHQ12 is not
niched on any specific diagnosis (such as e.g. PHQ9 for
depression), and, as it is short and clear, it is suitable for
a study population with varying levels of education and
stress symptoms (e.g. compared to WHODAS, SRQ20).

The Likert method was chosen for scoring GHQ as this
method enabled comparisons between subgroups in this
very diverse study population (see [33]). The use of a stan-
dardized cut off limit is useful for the assessment of need
of health care. It was set to > 11, as recommended, where
a higher score is understood as indicating mental health
problems in need of further clinical investigation [30, 34].
As the study population is considered a hard-to-reach
group, a decision was made to involve the health com-
municators in the recruitment to the study. To counter-
act possible disadvantages of not separating the study
recruitment entirely from the program implementation,
the last author trained the health communicators in
research ethics and principles for scientific validity,
including how it relates to the recruitment process. In
addition, either the first or last author was initially
present when the health communicators informed poten-
tial participants about the study and then followed up with
supervision until the respective health communicator was
considered to master the ethical, validity and administra-
tive aspects of recruitment.

Written information about the study was distributed
at health information sessions for newly arrived immi-
grants, at Integration centres’ pin boards and in Swedish
classes for immigrants. Those who were interested in
participating in the ‘Hälsostöd’ program and in the study
were invited to receive oral
information, by a health
communicator, in their native language one hour before
the first ‘Hälsostöd’ session. After the study information,
those who agreed to participate signed an informed con-
sent form (in Swedish plus native language), filled in the
questionnaire (native language), enclosed it in an envelope
and handed the sealed envelope to the health communica-
tors’ team leader, who delivered it to the research team.
Filling out the questionnaire was repeated after the fifth
and final ‘Hälsostöd’ session.

Variables
Outcome variables
In the present study, a positive change was defined as a
decrease in GHQ12 score from > 11 before program
participation to ≤11 after participation. The effect of
participation in the ‘Hälsostöd’ program has thus mainly
been measured in relation to a clinically significant
change (need/no need for further clinical investigation),
i.e. not in relation to mean or total score change.

Covariate variables
The following sociodemographic factors were included
(see Table 2): age (in years), gender (men, women,
other); education (years of education: 0–4, 5–9 or > 10
years); years in Sweden (< 1, 1–2, > 2 years); residence
status (asylum seeker, granted residence permit, other).

Statistical analyses
Both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis were
conducted. The total numbers (N) and percentages (%)
were used to present categorical variables. The means
(M) and standard deviation (SD) were used to describe
continuous variables. We calculated the mean and SD of
GHQ12 score both at baseline and after program partici-
pation. The frequencies of dichotomous directions of
changes in GHQ12 levels were calculated. The change
outcome was coded in three categories (positive change;
negative change; no change) using the recommended cut
off score for clinically significant changes (i.e. > 11).
Moreover, a Chi-square test (p < .001) was used to evalu-
ate the differences in GHQ12 > 11 at baseline compared
to after program participation.

The change categories (positive change, negative change,
no change).were applied in multinomial logistic regres-
sion, which modelled the above presented predictors in
relation to GHQ12 outcomes, for the purpose of answer-
ing the research question related to sociodemographic fac-
tors. The Somali and Persian groups were very small.
Hence, we excluded this data from further analysis. More-
over, we defined a cut off for program attendance to par-
ticipation in at least 60% of the program sessions (i.e. ≥3).
This because participation in only the first and last ses-
sion, in which measurements were administrated, would
not give a fair picture of the influence of the program con-
tent. The mean attendance of the included group was 4.50
sessions. Finally, a conservative approach, to only include
participants with no missing GHQ12 items, was chosen,
as dealing with solid data is of particular importance in
novel research areas. The final dataset included N = 202
cases (see Table 1 for demographics). IBM SPSS Statistics
25 was used as software for analyses.

Results
Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of those
‘Hälsostöd’ participants
that were included in the
analysis.

The descriptive analysis showed that

the mean of
GHQ12 score, for the study population, was higher be-
fore participation in ‘Hälsostöd’ (M = 12.74, SD = 6.83)
compared to after (M = 10.83, SD = 6.15). In addition, a
frequency analysis showed that 21.8% (N = 44) of the
participants had a positive change, 5.9% (N = 12) had a
negative change and 72.3% (N = 146) had no change
compared to before the program. To investigate poten-
tial clinical relevance of the observed change, we also
analysed the number of participants scoring > 11,
i.e.,
the cut off indicating a need for clinical investigation,
after participation compared to before. The number of
participants scoring > 11 after participation was lower
(N = 79, 39.1%) compared to the corresponding number
before participation (N = 111, 55%), Chi Square = 10.17,
p < .001). This result suggests that fewer participants had
symptoms of adverse mental health after the program.
Moreover, the majority did not deteriorate in mental
health over the study period. The majority rated a me-
dian of 7-point decrease on the GHQ12 measure. In the
negative change group, participants rated a median of 6-
point increase on their GHQ12 score. No statistically
significant
sociodemographic
factors and changes in mental health before and after
program participation were observed (Table 2).

Discussion
This study investigated migrants, mainly asylum seekers’
and newly arrived immigrants’, self-reported mental
health before and after participating in the five-week
health promotive program ‘Hälsostöd’. The main result
shows that the number of participants in need of further
clinical investigation for mental illness was lower after
the program compared to before. However, we did not
observe any statistically significant association between
investigated sociodemographic factors and outcome.

Psycho-educative programs that promote participants’
health literacy, i.e. their ability to understand, manage
and control their health development and the situation
they are in, arguably connect to Antonovsky’s theory of
‘sense of coherence’ (see [25]). According to the theory,
a sense of coherence promotes people’s use of their own
and the context’s resources when coping with stress and
tension [27]. The increased sense of coherence following
improved health literacy, an anticipated consequence of
the program, is a possible explanation of the observed
positive changes in participants’ GHQ12 scores. Although
using a different scale (Kessler), an evaluation of a similar
program aimed at Arab refugees found a comparable
decrease in general mental illness [35]. Our results add

to that finding by further underscoring the potential of
psycho-educative health promotion programs on mi-
grants’ mental health.

More so, efforts to bridge linguistic and cultural
barriers between refugees and health workers have been
revealed paramount in securing intervention effective-
ness [27, 36–38]. In this program, the health communi-
cators’ migrant background was intended to support
trust, empathy, and connection with the target group
[28]. Further research is needed on which aspects of
health communicators’ profile are essential
the
achievement of program objectives, yet the idea of iden-
tification connects to research on mechanisms behind
positive effects of psychotherapy, which clearly under-
scores personal factors. Although empathy and identifi-
cation are not enough to create clinical change,
it is
fundamental to human interaction and is described as
key to support patients’ and health promotion program
participants’ motivation towards co-creating positive
change [39, 40].

for

Previous research has shown that post-migration fac-
tors in the new host country (e.g. waiting for a residence
permit, un-employment,
low socioeconomic position)
impact and presuppose a deterioration in mental health
[17]. For example, hazard risks for ICD-10 nervous and
psychotic disorders steadily increases with each quarter
of waiting time for asylum and residence decisions [16].
A similar development could therefore be expected for
the participants in this program, which is why ‘No
change’ in mental health potentially could be viewed as a
positive outcome.

Our assumption that sociodemographic factors could
moderate the influence of the program on participants’
mental health was not supported by the study result.
None of the analysed sociodemographic factors (gender,
education, age, years in Sweden, and residence status)
showed any statistically significant associations with
mental health outcomes. The effect of years in Sweden
was trending, as participants with lesser years in Sweden
to a higher degree reported positive change in mental
health. We hypothesise that this trend could reflect the
negative influence of long waiting for asylum decisions
on applicants’ mental health [20, 22, 35]. Long waiting
for asylum decisions applied to the majority of the par-
ticipants in our study because of the intensified applica-
tion numbers in Sweden at the time, which led to
decisions taking up to several years.

A possible explanation of the null result is related to
adaptation of the program content to participants’ differ-
ent needs, as the pragmatism and flexibility of the per-
son leading this kind of group sessions are highlighted
as crucial for their quality (e.g. [22, 41]). It is possible
that the health communicators in this program, to an
unusually high degree, managed to satisfactorily meet

Wrede et al. BMC Public Health          (2021) 21:262 

Page 6 of 8

the varying profiles and needs of the participants. If they
managed, in accordance with program instructions, to
create a trusted environment that provided room for the
participants’ own migration narratives, and adapt the
program content to the participants’ level of education
and age, this could have levelled out the influence of
demographic factors, rendering the ‘Hälsostöd’ sessions
equally meaningful to all subgroups.

However, the null findings should be interpreted with
caution and it is possible that larger sample sizes of each
sub-group are needed to detect potential associations.
Additionally, the study population in this study was
more heterogeneous than in previous studies stating an
association between sociodemographic
and
mental health outcomes (e.g. [11]), a fact that could have
decreased their predictive value for the evaluation of this
program.

factors

Limitations
A few important limitations should be noted. Firstly, for
ethical and practical reasons, it was not feasible to in-
clude a control group. Consequently, conclusions about
causality are not possible, even though mental health
changes were observed in individuals and on group level.
To enable comparison, future studies could try including
a waiting list control, using the administration of self-
reports on mental health before program participation,
and/or additional measuring points, preferably with
long-term follow-ups. The latter was not possible in this
study because of limited project time frames and be-
cause many participants changed address or even left
the country during the study. Digital solutions may en-
able ways to keep connections to participants in future
studies. However, possible opportunities to include con-
trol groups and innovative ways of increasing the follow-
up period should be balanced with ethical considerations
due to the susceptibility of this group.

The dropout rate is a limitation, partly because it was
especially high for particularly vulnerable groups, i.e. the
Dari group and the asylum seeker group. Some of the
increased difference between ‘asylum seekers’
and
‘residence permit’, between T1 and T2, reflect that a few
participants received their residence permit during the
program and some moved to other regions. However,
some could also have dropped out because of a deterior-
linked to their challenging
ating mental health status,
situation. Taken together, the results of our study may
not fully apply to Dari and asylum-seeking participants.
Future studies should thus look closer on the health sta-
tuses of these groups in order to increase the under-
standing of what type of programs could be relevant for
promoting mental health in groups in exceptionally diffi-
cult social circumstances. Hence, we encourage future
evaluations of similar programs to specifically look at

possible subgroup differences and timing of the program
in relation to participants’
life premises, e.g. asylum
status.

Another limitation of this study is the fact that the
health communicators assisted in the information and
recruitment to the study. We cannot exclude bias effects,
particularly in relation to low educated groups needing
extensive explanations for understanding e.g. the Likert
scale logic. However, to make use of a trusted, native
speaker, i.e. the health communicators, was in our judg-
ment a necessary strategy to recruit participants to the
study. In addition, our sample may be subjected to selec-
tion bias as participating in the ‘Hälsostöd’ program
demanded a certain level of structure, energy, and social
engagement over five weeks. As was mentioned above,
members of the target group with deteriorating mental
health status may have had less possibility to complete
the program. Even so, several of the included study par-
ticipants reported high GHQ12 scores at the interven-
tions start, suggesting very poor mental health, but still
fulfilled the five sessions, which contests a general selec-
tion bias. The lack of screening for mental disorders be-
fore the program start enabled participants on all levels
of mental health to participate. Since the intervention
was not designed to have an effect on more severe men-
tal disorders, the inclusion of such cases in the study
sample might have lowered the positive change in aver-
age score. Finally, the specific contextual situation of
Sweden for asylum seekers and newly arrivals at the time
possibly limits the generalization of the results to other
settings and study populations.

Conclusion
Altogether, our study suggests that migrants’, specific-
ally asylum seekers and newly arrived immigrants’,
mental health can benefit from participating in a salu-
togenic psycho-educative health promotion program
lead by community health workers. This was shown by
positive changes in participants’ GHQ12 scores, mean-
ing a lowered proportion of individuals in need of fur-
ther clinical investigation. Previous research suggests a
need to further investigate association between sociode-
mographic factors and the mental health effect of
certain interventions. However, this evaluation did not
establish any such correlations which could be due to
the health communicators ability to effectively adapt to
each groups’ needs. Findings in this study suggest the
importance of offering refugees and other immigrants
tailored health promotive programs in close connection
with arrival in the new home country. The provision of
mental health and health literacy focused programs
could help reduce the disproportionate health chal-
lenges faced by migrants and refugees.

Hospital at Region Västra Götaland, Sweden (grants given to GP), and the
University of Gothenburg. These funding bodies had no role in the design of
this study nor collection, analysis, or interpretation of data. Open Access
funding provided by University of Gothenburg.

Availability of data and materials
The datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are not

the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Ethics approval and consent to participate
This study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee, Gothenburg,
Sweden (nr 528–17). Written consent was obtained from all individual
participants included in the study. Refugees, being a vulnerable group due
to their negative migration experiences and insecure residence status in the
new country, may hesitate to participate in studies exploring their
experiences and feelings. The use of health communicators with a migrant
background, speaking the same language as participants, for study
information and recruitment was therefore employed in this evaluation.
