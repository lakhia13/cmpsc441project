Abstract
Background  Although telemental health can make suicide prevention treatments more scalable and accessible, 
limited evidence demonstrates successful reductions in suicidality when interventions are administered through 
telehealth platforms. To address this limitation, the current work investigated the effects of two suicide prevention 
treatments – a clinician-guided Crisis Response Plan and a self-guided Safety Planning approach.

Methods  After completing the screening process, 82 participants with high suicide ideation and/or a lifetime history 
of suicidal behavior were randomly assigned across the two groups. Trained research clinicians administered the 
interventions using a videoconferencing platform. After the intervention delivery was complete, participants reported 
the therapeutic alliance they experienced with their clinician using an online survey. Participants also reported 
their overall suicidality 45 days after receiving the intervention. In addition, participants’ perceived usefulness of the 
received intervention and actual use of the plan were recorded. Linear and logistic regression models predicted 
how suicidality, perceived utility, and actual use of their intervention protocols varied depending on the high (Crisis 
Response Plan) versus low (self-guided Safety Planning) level of clinician-led collaboration the two treatments 
entailed.

Results  Both Crisis Response Plan and self-guided Safety Planning were found to lower suicidality after receiving 
them via telehealth services. At the same time, those who received the Crisis Response Plan (the more collaborative

form of therapy) reported experiencing a stronger therapeutic alliance with the clinician, utilizing the plan more often 
and perceiving it as more useful. These findings demonstrate the additional benefits of adopting a more collaborative 
approach because of its effectiveness and perceived utility, which has implications for suicide-related distress 
reduction in the short and long term.

Conclusions  Evidence from this randomized control trial suggests that Crisis Response Plan is a suitable candidate 
for delivering suicide prevention via telehealth platform because of its effectiveness in reducing suicidality and its 
collaborative approach to building a strong therapeutic alliance, perceived usefulness, and actual utility in everyday 
life.

Background
Every  year  approximately  700,000  individuals  die  due  to 
suicide, but it can be prevented with timely and effective 
treatments [1]. Despite advancements in telehealth, men-
tal  health  treatment  for  suicide  is  delivered  primarily  in 
person  within  clinical  settings.  Although  telehealth  can 
make  suicide  prevention  treatments  more  scalable  and 
accessible,  limited  studies  show  that  suicide  prevention 
treatment can be successfully implemented via telehealth 
[2]. To bridge this gap in understanding, the current work 
investigated  the  effects  of  two  suicide  prevention  treat-
ments delivered via telehealth services.

Advancements via telehealth

telecommunications  and 
Telemental  health  utilizes 
videoconferencing  platforms  to  boost  the  availabil-
ity  of  professional  mental  health  services  [3].  Innova-
tion  in  healthcare  via  telehealth  has  enabled  the  use  of 
videoconferencing  and  mobile  wireless  sensors,  giving 
patients more flexibility in receiving medical care [4]. An 
important  obstacle  that  telehealth  can  help  overcome  is 
the  geographic  distance  from  healthcare  and  the  issue 
of  transportation  and  mobility.  Indeed,  telehealth  has 
helped  reduce  costs  and  time  investment  related  to  in-
person hospital visits [4, 5]. A good example is the rural 
and suburban population, where access to health care can 
often be limited [6]. Patients in rural areas no longer need 
to  live  close  to  healthcare  providers  to  receive  services 
[7].  Another  huge  application  of  telehealth  was  during 
the  COVID-19  pandemic,  when  telehealth  was  the  pre-
ferred medium for providing healthcare during outbreaks 
[8,  9].  Overall,  telehealth  has  been  a  practical  and  cost-
efficient way to provide support during the pandemic.

Telehealth  is  becoming  a  useful  tool  for  receiving 
mental  health  services  specifically  [10].  Despite  the 
convenience  of  receiving  treatment  virtually,  originally 
designed  for  in-person  implementation  may  not  be 
effective  via  telehealth.  Focusing  specifically  on  suicide 
interventions,  it  is  possible  that  the  comfort  of  receiv-
ing  treatment  in-person  does  not  necessarily  transfer  to 

telehealth services. Additional research is therefore war-
ranted  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  suicide  prevention 
treatments delivered via telehealth. We particularly focus 
on videoconferencing platforms to deliver interventions.

Suicide prevention approaches

Among  suicide  prevention  protocols,  promising  candi-
dates for telemental health services are those treatments 
that  can  be  delivered  promptly  during  acute  moments 
when  a  crisis  may  be  emerging,  thereby  lowering  the 
suicidality  of  individuals.  Safety  planning  type  inter-
ventions  are  designed  to  address  acute  triggers  of  emo-
tional distress that could unfold into a suicide crisis [11, 
12].  Their  efficacy  in  reducing  suicide-related  distress  is 
attributed to reducing cognitive load, focusing away from 
personal triggers toward building connections with sup-
port systems, and facilitating autonomy and competence, 
thereby reducing impulsivity and suicidal behaviors [11]. 
Although  preliminary  evidence  suggests  safety  planning 
type  interventions  may  reduce  suicidal  behaviors  [12], 
the  overall  quality  of  supporting  evidence  is  low  [13], 
highlighting the need for further research. In the current 
study,  we  focus  on  two  types  of  utilized  interventions  – 
self-guided  Safety  Planning  [14]  and  Crisis  Response 
Planning (CRP) [15].

Self-guided  safety  planning  (SP;  [14])  is  a  structured 
tool that is modeled on the Safety Planning Intervention 
[16], a commonly used safety planning type intervention, 
but it is self-administered by the participant. Indeed, two 
forms of SPI exist, with one being more collaborative and 
the  other  being  self-guided  by  the  patient.  The  self-led 
Safety Planning Intervention uses a templated, fill-in-the-
blank  form  to  help  patients  identify  early  warning  signs 
of a suicidal crisis, relevant coping strategies, sources of 
social support, professional and crisis services, and strat-
egies for limiting access to possible suicide attempt meth-
ods [16]. A self-administered web-based digitized version 
of SPI has been developed to reduce mental health pro-
fessionals’  time  and  improve  the  standardization  of  the 
protocol [17]. Preliminary research with the self-directed, 

Lohani et al. BMC Health Services Research         (2024) 24:1389 Page 3 of 9

web-based  version  of  SPI  found  the  intervention  to  be 
feasible  and  acceptable  as  “an  adjunct  to  clinical  con-
tact”  [17].  Given  that  self-guided  SP  has  been  adapted 
in a web-based version with support for its effectiveness 
when  self-directed  by  the  patient,  it  is  a  good  interven-
tion to test for implementing suicide prevention support 
via telehealth and was thus selected in the current study. 
Indeed,  self-guided  safety  plan  templates  are  commonly 
utilized in real-world settings, such as emergency depart-
ments,  when  collaborative  and  time-consuming  treat-
ments  are  not  logistically  possible.  Self-guided  safety 
plans are utilized because they have been found to reduce 
suicide attempts among emergency department patients 
with  suicide  ideation  [18].  The  current  study  used  the 
same  approach  as  modeled  in  past  work  [14,  17].  Note 
that we also selected the self-guided safety plan approach 
based  on  clinician  descriptions  of  how  they  actually 
implement the intervention in their clinical work.

In  contrast  to  self-administered  interventions,  Cri-
sis  Response  Planning  (CRP)  [15]  involves  a  more  col-
laborative  approach  wherein  a  clinician  and  patient 
work  together  to  create  a  customized  plan  for  identify-
ing  and  effectively  responding  to  periods  of  heightened 
vulnerability  to  suicide.  The  plan  is  typically  written  on 
an  index  card  that  can  be  easily  accessed  by  the  patient 
when needed. CRP includes several key components: (1) 
personal  warning  signs  indicative  of  a  potential  suicidal 
crisis; (2) self-regulation strategies to manage or distract 
from emotional distress (e.g., distraction or calming); (3) 
thinking of personal reasons to live; (4) ways to seek sup-
port from others; and (5) access to professional and cri-
sis  services.  Multiple  randomized  clinical  trials  support 
the  effectiveness  of  CRP  in  reducing  suicidal  ideation 
and suicide attempts [19–21]. Randomized clinical trials 
using CRP-like approaches (e.g., “crisis cards” or “coping 
cards”) have shown similar reductions in suicide attempts 
(e.g  [22]).  A  recent  randomized  control  trial  testing  the 
effectiveness  of  CRP  delivered  via  telehealth  found  that, 
on average, CRP reduced suicide ideation during the two 
weeks after receiving therapy, thereby providing the first 
evidence supporting the effectiveness of a telehealth ver-
sion of CRP [21].

A  core  difference  between  CRP  and  self-directed  SP 
is the level of clinician-led collaboration that is available 
to  the  client.  Collaborative  approaches  are  suggested  to 
provide  the  support  needed  for  suicidal  individuals  to 
develop effective ways to handle their warning signs and 
avert  suicidal  crises  [23].  Another  element  of  clinician-
led  collaboration  is  nurturing  the  therapeutic  alliance 
being  built  with  the  patient.  Based  on  established  psy-
chotherapy research, a clinician-patient alliance could be 
a  key  determinant  of  desirable  therapy  outcomes  (for  a 
review, see [24]). A positive working alliance with the cli-
nician can act as a buffer for high-risk individuals, which 

may  in  turn  help  reduce  suicide  ideation  and  attempts 
[24,  25].  Thus,  interventions  specifically  focused  on 
developing  clinician-patient  collaboration  may  be  more 
effective in treating suicidality.

Presumably,  safety  planning-type  interventions  may 
be  more  effective  when  patients  perceive  their  estab-
lished  plan  (either  clinician-guided  or  self-guided)  to 
be  useful  in  managing  distress  and  may  actually  use  it 
in  their  everyday  lives  when  warning  signs  appear.  Tak-
ing  the  example  of  a  CRP  study,  80%  of  individuals  still 
had  their  plan  with  them  6-months  after  receiving  the 
interventions  [19],  suggesting  that  at-risk  patients  per-
ceived some value in having their plan with them to deal 
with  suicidal  urges.  Furthermore,  more  frequent  use  of 
CRP is associated with significantly reduced suicide ide-
ation  [19],  demonstrating  that  patients  must  perceive  it 
to be useful. However, it remains to be understood if the 
level of collaboration while developing the plan may sig-
nificantly affect the use of safety planning-type interven-
tions. Given that CRP is more collaborative, it is possible 
that patients may perceive it to be more useful than self-
guided  plans  like  SPI.  However,  no  previous  study  has 
directly  compared  patients’  perceptions  of  therapeutic 
alliance  or  treatment  usefulness  across  safety  planning-
type  interventions,  which  was  addressed  in  the  current 
study.

The current study

The  current  project  was  conducted  with  the  goal  of 
making  suicide  prevention  interventions  accessible  to  a 
national sample via telemental health approaches. A com-
pletely virtual platform was used to administer this study, 
with participants receiving all assessment and treatment 
via videoconferencing platforms and internet-based sur-
veys.  Notably,  there  are  several  ways  of  implementing 
safety planning-type interventions, including self-guided 
vs.  clinician-facilitated,  as  reported  in  multiple  studies 
[12,  26,  27].  This  was  the  motivation  to  investigate  how 
self-guided compared to clinician-led interventions effec-
tively reduce suicidality.

Specifically,  the  current  study  aimed  to  further  find-
ings from the past study [21] and address two goals. First, 
compare  the  therapeutic  alliance  experienced  by  clients 
undergoing  CRP  vs.  self-guided  SP.  The  strength  of  a 
working  alliance  may  be  an  inherent  mechanistic  differ-
ence between the two safety planning interventions that 
remains  to  be  directly  tested.  Given  the  collaborative 
nature of CRP [19, 20], it was predicted to have a higher 
clinician-based therapeutic alliance. Second, to compare 
the  effectiveness  of  telehealth-based  suicide  prevention 
treatments in reducing suicidality after 45 days of receiv-
ing  the  interventions.  Our  hypothesis  was  that  similar 
to the effects demonstrated in face-to-face interventions 
[14–16],  both  treatments  would  be  effective  in  lowering

suicidal  symptoms  when  received  via  telehealth  ser-
vices.  Given  the  collaborative  nature  of  CRP  treatment 
with  a  clinician-guided  approach  to  devising  a  mitiga-
tion plan for dealing with warning signs, we expected it 
to be perceived as more useful than self-guided SP by the 
participants.

Eligibility criteria

This  study  recruited  a  national  sample  from  the  United 
States.  Participants  were  recruited  nationally  by  adver-
tising  this  study  on  electronic  postings  on  online  public 
bulletin boards and newsgroups (e.g., Redditt, Facebook, 
etc.). The consort diagram (Fig. 1) presents the screening

pletely  online  intervention  study.  Participants  received 

The eligibility criteria included adults between the ages of 
18 and 50 who were able to communicate in English. In 
addition, to be eligible, individuals should have reported 
suicidal ideation in the preceding week (Scale for Suicidal 
Ideation; [28]) and as well as or, they may have a lifetime 
history  of  suicidal  behavior,  assessed  with  the  Self-Inju-
rious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview-Revised (SITBI-
R;  [29]).  The  study’s  exclusion  criteria  included  the

intervention after balancing for biological sex (female or 
male) and lifetime history of suicide attempts (none, one, 
or  two  plus).  The  first  author  randomized  the  partici-
pants  and  did  not  have  any  contact  with  or  information 
about participants to avoid biases.

Interventions
Crisis response plan

The  CRP  [15]  includes  a  collaborative  effort  between 
the  clinician  and  the  participant.  First,  the  clinician 
explained  the  purpose  of  CRP  intervention  and  pro-
vided  an  overview  of  the  handwritten  plan.  Next,  the 
clinician  invited  the  participant  to  make  a  collaborative 
plan to identify personal warning signs and strategies to 
deal with moments of crisis. The clinician plays an active 
role  in  guiding  the  participant  in  coming  up  with  rel-
evant options during each stage of the plan development. 
After  completing  the  plan,  the  participant  and  clinician 
reviewed the plan to check for unrecognized barriers to 
accomplishing  the  plan.  The  study  clinician  concluded 
the  session  by  encouraging  the  participant  to  utilize  the 
plan frequently.

Self-guided safety planning

This intervention involved the clinician giving the partic-
ipants a digital copy of the self-guided SP [14, 17] created 
using a Qualtrics platform and providing an overview of 
the plan. Given that this plan is self-guided, the clinician 
requested participants to complete the digital form them-
selves  but  ask  if  any  questions  came  up.  After  the  par-
ticipant  had  completed  the  plan,  the  clinician  reviewed 
it  to  ensure  its  suitability  for  accomplishing  the  goals  of 
self-guided SP. The clinician wrapped up the session after 
encouraging the participant to utilize the plan frequently.

Clinicians

All  clinicians  in  the  study  were  thoroughly  trained  in 
both  therapies.  Research  clinicians  included  a  licensed 
clinical  social  worker  (who  conducted  14  self-guided  SP 
and  10  CRP  interventions),  an  unlicensed  clinical  social 
worker (who was in training to become a licensed clini-
cal  social  worker  and  conducted  5  SP  and  4  CRP  inter-
ventions), a PhD student of counseling psychology (who 
performed 21 SP and 26 CRP interventions), and a post-
doc  counseling  psychologist  (who  conducted  1  SP  and 
1  CRP  interventions).  To  ensure  reliable  interventions 
across  research  clinicians,  fidelity  monitoring  was  per-
formed by a senior licensed clinician (JB) who reviewed 
the  interventions  for  all  research  clinicians.  In  addition, 
the research clinicians met each week for case consulta-
tion, fidelity monitoring, and supervision.

existence of any medical condition that would limit indi-
viduals’ ability to give informed consent. Furthermore, if 
individuals were receiving alternative therapies to suicide 
prevention, they were not eligible.

Measures
Scale for suicide ideation (SSI)

The  SSI  [28]  is  a  19-item  measure  that  is  used  to  assess 
the suicidality of individuals based on their wish to live, 
the  intensity  of  suicide  ideation,  and  suicidal  behavior 
in the previous week. Participants are asked to rate their 
experiences  on  a  3-point  Likert  scale.  A  composite  of 
the items is created, and the higher the score, the higher 
the intensity of suicidality. For the baseline SSI measure-
ment, the range of values ranged between 3 and 28 with 
good  Cronbach’s  alpha = 0.902.  For  the  45-day  follow-up 
assessment,  SSI  ranged  from  0  to  26  (descriptive  in  the 
Results section); Cronbach’s alpha = 0.868.

Working alliance

Participants  were  given  the  Working  Alliance  Inven-
tory—Short Form, a 12-item survey rated by the patient 
to assess the strength of the therapeutic alliance between 
the  participant  and  the  clinician  [30].  The  sum  of  all 
items is used to create a composite score, and the higher 
the score, the better the therapeutic alliance. The range of 
values was between 22 and 60 (M = 46.47, SD = 9.52) and 
had excellent reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.927).

Remembered the plan

All participants were also asked, “When you met with the 
therapist, you had worked on a plan that you could follow 
when a crisis may be developing. Do you remember that 
plan?”  Participants  reported  “Yes”  or  “No”  to  the  ques-
tion. This question was adopted from past work [19].

Adopted the plan

Adapted from past work [19], all participants were asked, 
“Have  you  used  that  plan  at  all  since  you  met  with  the 
therapist?”  Participants  reported  “Yes”  or  “No”  to  the 
question.

Perceived treatment usefulness

At  the  45-day  follow-up,  we  also  asked  participants  to 
rate  how  useful  the  intervention  they  received  was  for 
themselves.  Adapted  from  past  work  [31],  participants 
were  asked,  “How  useful  would  you  say  this  plan  was 
(0 = not at all useful, 10 = extremely useful)?”

Randomization

This  study  used  stratified  randomization  to  control  for 
confounding effects of biological sex and lifetime history 
of  suicide  attempts  due  to  their  known  effect  on  suicid-
ality.  Accordingly,  participants  were  randomized  to  the 

Lohani et al. BMC Health Services Research         (2024) 24:1389 Procedure

The  study  was  conducted  between  May  to  December  of 
2021.  All  study  procedures  were  conducted  using  tele-
mental  health-based  methods,  including  videoconfer-
encing  and  internet-based  surveys.  Those  who  were 
interested  in  the  study  were  given  an  online  screening 
survey  to  assess  preliminary  eligibility  to  be  considered 
for the study. See the consort diagram for details. Among 
those who agreed to participate in the study and did not 
have  any  exclusion  criteria,  their  suicidality  in  the  pre-
ceding week was assessed using the SSI [28]. The eligible 
participants completed the approved consenting process. 
They were randomized between the two interventions – 
Crisis  Response  Plan  and  Safety  Plan  Intervention.  Par-
ticipants received the intervention about two weeks after 
being  eligible  to  participate  in  the  study.  The  interven-
tions  were  received  completely  online  via  video  confer-
encing  format.  Right  after  the  participants  received  the 
intervention,  they  were  sent  a  survey  link  to  fill  out  the

Working  Alliance  Inventory  [30].  In  order  to  assess  the 
possible  prolonged  effect  of  the  intervention  received, 
participants  were  assessed  45  days  after  receiving  the 
intervention.  Follow-up  suicidality  was  assessed  again 
using  SSI  (that  was  experienced  by  participants  dur-
ing the preceding week). At the completion of the study, 
all  participants  received  supplementary  mental  health 
resources  for  additional  support.  All  surveys  were  con-
ducted online via the Qualtrics platform.

Data analysis plan

The analysis plan accounted for the experimental design, 
and  the  type  of  outcome  measure  was  assessed  (i.e., 
continuous  or  binary).  Suicide  ideation  (a  continuous 
outcome  scale)  was  assessed  at  baseline  and  follow-up 
(a  repeated  measure  factor),  while  the  intervention  was 
always a between-subjects factor. Thus, a mixed ANOVA 
was  conducted.  Another  outcome,  the  therapeutic  alli-
ance assessment was collected once right after the inter-
vention,  and  it  was  on  a  continuous  scale,  so  a  one-way 
between-subjects  ANOVA  was  run  to  examine  the 
effect  of  the  intervention.  The  perceived  usefulness  was 
assessed 45 days after the intervention, and the outcome 
was  continuous,  so  one-way  between-subjects  ANOVA 
was conducted. However, the plan recollection and treat-
ment adoption outcomes were assessed 45 days after the 
intervention.  Because  they  both  were  binary  outcomes, 
logistic regression models were run. RStudio was used to 
conduct all analyses.

The  Scale  of  Suicide  Ideation;  SSI  [28]  was  assessed  at

tion  over  time,  a  mixed  ANOVA  was  run  with  time  (2: 
baseline and follow-up) as the within-subject factor and 
treatment  (2:  CRP  vs.  self-guided  SP)  as  the  between-
subjects  factor  with  SSI  scores  as  the  outcome.  A  main 
2  = 
effect  of  time  was  found,  F(1,  56) = 10.21,  p = .002,  ηp
0.154.  The  two  treatments  had  no  significant  difference, 
2 = 0.003. The time x treatment 
F(1, 56) = 0.141, p = .708, ηp
interaction  was  not  significant,  F(1,  56) = 0.098,  p = .755, 
2  =  0.002.  This  implied  that  for  both  treatments  com-
ηp
bined,  the  suicidality  (via  SSI  scores)  reduced  from  pre-
treatment  (CRP:  M = 16.966,  SE = 1.135;  self-guided  SP: 
M = 17.793,  SE = 1.135)  to  follow-up  (CRP:  M = 13.793,

SE = 1.253;  self-guided  SP:  M = 13.931,  SE = 1.253)  after 
receiving treatment.

A comparison of the effect of CRP vs. self-guided SP on 
building therapeutic alliance via Telehealth

The two interventions were compared for their effect on 
building  therapeutic  alliance  (measured  via  the  Work-
ing  Alliance  Inventory  [30]).  A  one-way  ANOVA  was 
conducted  with  treatment  (2:  CRP  vs.  self-guided  SP) 
as  the  predictor  and  working  alliance  score  as  the  out-
come.  Those  participants  who  received  CRP  (M = 51.32, 
SE = 1.74)  reported  significantly  higher  scores  on  the 
Working  Alliance  Inventory  than  the  self-guided  SP 
group  (M = 43.45,  SE = 1.62),  F  (1,  52) = 10.934,  p = .002, 
η2 = 0.174.

A comparison of the effect of CRP vs. self-guided SP on 
recollection of the received treatment

A logistic regression model was also run to compare the 
effect  of  interventions  on  recollection  of  the  received 
treatment plan. The logistic regression model with treat-
ment  as  the  predictor  was  not  statistically  significant, 
χ2(1) = 0.439, p = .508. Both groups remembered the plan 
they developed during the intervention. For CRP, 83.87%, 
while  for  self-guided  SP,  89.65%  remembered  the  plan 
they had developed with their therapist.

A comparison of the effect of CRP vs. self-guided SP on 
adoption of treatment

Logistic  regression  was  also  run  to  determine  if  partici-
pants  had  adopted  their  treatment  plan  after  receiving 
the  intervention.  The  logistic  regression  model  was  sta-
tistically  significant,  χ2(1) = 4.408,  p = .036.  A  significant 
effect  of  treatment  type  was  found,  B(SE) = 1.163(0.568), 
Wald = 4.194,  p = .041.  The  odds  of  using  the  CRP 
approach were 3.20 times higher than for self-guided SP. 
For CRP, 77.42% of participants reported using the plan 
in  the  45-day  period.  However,  51.72%  of  participants 
used the plan for the self-guided SP condition.

A comparison of the effect of CRP vs. self-guided SP on the 
perceived usefulness rating of the treatment

To  compare  how  useful  the  participants  found  the  plan 
across  the  two  interventions,  a  one-way  between-sub-
jects  ANOVA  with  treatment  (CRP  vs.  self-guided  SP) 
as the predictor was significant, F (1, 58) = 5.962, p = .018, 
η2 = 0.093. The CRP plan was rated as significantly more 
useful  (M = 6.87,  SE = 0.526)  than  the  self-guided  SP 
(M = 5.07, SE = 0.516).

Discussion
Evidence-based telemental health options for suicide pre-
vention  can  provide  access  to  lifesaving  mental  health 
services in a timely manner. The current work evaluated 

the  effectiveness  of  two  common  safety  planning  thera-
pies,  CRP  versus  self-guided  SP,  when  administered 
through  a  telemental  health  platform.  Both  CRP  and 
self-guided  SP  were  found  to  lower  suicidality  (assessed 
by  the  standardized  and  commonly  adopted  Scale  for 
Suicide Ideation [28]) after receiving safety plan interven-
tions via telehealth. At the same time, those who received 
CRP  (the  more  collaborative  form  of  therapy)  reported 
experiencing  a  stronger  therapeutic  alliance  with  the 
clinician,  utilizing  the  plan  more  often  and  perceiving 
it  as  more  useful.  These  findings  demonstrate  the  addi-
tional benefits of adopting a more collaborative approach 
because  of  its  effectiveness  and  perceived  utility,  which 
has implications for suicidality reduction in the short and 
long term.

In  a  recently  published  study  [21],  it  was  found  that 
both  CRP  and  self-led  SPI  were  effective  in  reducing 
suicide  ideation.  Follow-up  data  were  collected  45  days 
from  participants  receiving  these  therapies  to  examine 
their  effects  beyond  immediate  impacts.  To  interpret 
the impact of collaborative vs. self-guided efforts, a com-
parison of participants’ perceptions and use of their sui-
cide prevention plan across the two safety planning-type 
interventions  was  made.  It  was  found  that  participants 
who developed the clinician-guided Crisis Response Plan 
utilized it about 3 times more than those who developed 
a self-guided Safety Plan Intervention. An explanation for 
this  could  be  the  perceived  higher  perceived  use  of  the 
CRP relative to self-directed SP. Furthermore, in line with 
our  hypothesis,  participants  rated  a  higher  therapeutic 
alliance with their telehealth clinician when they received 
CRP than the self-guided SP. A stronger therapeutic alli-
ance  early  in  therapy  can  have  a  robust  effect  on  at-risk 
individuals. For instance, previous work has found thera-
peutic alliances with clinicians to reduce suicide ideation 
and attempts [19, 24, 25, 31]. Collaborative interventions 
may  ease  the  cognitive  load  and  distribute  tasks  as  well 
as  feel  psychological  support,  all  of  which  are  found  to 
improve  psychological  outcomes  [19].  In  the  current 
study, no significant differences in suicidality were found 
across CRP vs. self-guided SP after 45 days of follow-up; 
however, it is possible that the benefits of CRP that led to 
a higher therapeutic alliance may be experienced imme-
diately  after  receiving  the  intervention,  or  in  the  short-
term, as well as longer-term impact (than assessed in the 
current work). Based on these results, additional research 
focused  on  understanding  how  various  approaches  to 
safety planning-type interventions (such as collaborative 
Safety Planning Interventions) can impact results is war-
ranted. Further work is also needed to systematically and 
dynamically  track  the  short  and  long-term  effects  post-
intervention to learn about the potential benefits of more 
collaborative interventions like CRP.

aging  suicidality  (e.g  [11]).  The  current  findings  show 
the  effectiveness  and  utility  of  CRP  and  given  its  rapid 
reduction  in  suicidality,  its  applicability  to  telemental 
health  services.  These  findings  are  particularly  relevant 
to communities that do not have access to reliable health 
services,  such  as  diverse,  underserved,  and  vulnerable 
populations  [5].  Rural  communities  are  quite  recep-
tive  to  telehealth  to  receive  mental  health  services  but 
still  face  challenges  in  receiving  proper  care  [6,  32,  33]. 
Therefore,  further  work  is  needed  to  overcome  barriers 
to  making  suicide  interventions  available  more  broadly 
via telehealth.

The  current  findings  should  be  interpreted  with  the 
following  limitations  and  future  directions  in  mind. 
First,  additional  information  about  the  frequency  of 
urges  or  warning  signs  would  be  helpful  in  understand-
ing the real-world utility of safety plans. Second, the cur-
rent study utilized adults with a cutoff of 50 years old to 
ensure that the participants were comfortable with a vid-
eoconferencing platform to receive therapy (to avoid it as 
a  confounding  variable).  Therefore,  the  findings  cannot 
be used to make inferences across the lifespan, and future 
work should extend this work to other age groups, such 
as  adolescents  and  individuals  from  historically  margin-
alized  backgrounds,  for  whom  suicide  is  a  major  cause 
of  mortality  [1,  34].  Similarly,  a  larger  representative 
sample would increase the generalizability and reliability 
of  these  findings. Third,  it  is  possible  that  having  differ-
ent  clinicians  provide  different  interventions  could  vary 
from  one  another,  especially  when  building  a  working 
alliance  with  the  participant.  However,  fidelity  monitor-
ing was conducted to ensure the quality of the interven-
tions  was  consistent.  Fourth,  the  current  findings  and 
past work recommends using a collaborative instead of a 
self-guided approach. However, implementation of safety 
planning has been found to vary widely across clinicians 
and  healthcare  settings,  and  this  study  considered  only 
two of potentially multiple clinical approaches. Thus, fur-
ther work is needed to examine other suicide prevention 
approaches. Finally, to make suicide prevention interven-
tions  via  telehealth  accessible  and  acceptable,  awareness 
and  engagement  at  the  community  level  are  integral  to 
overcoming the stigma around suicide and mental health 
support in general [4].

Together,  the  current  findings  are  encouraging  and 
suggest  that  both  CRP  and  self-guided  SP  can  be  effec-
tively transported to telemental health technology. At the 
same  time,  CRP  showed  additional  benefits  as  indexed 
by a higher therapeutic alliance, adoption, and perceived 
use  of  their  suicide  mitigation  plan.  Given  the  advance-
ments in telepsychiatry interventions, this is a promising 
finding  suggesting  that  CRP  can  be  delivered  via  tele-
health,  making  suicide  prevention  efforts  more  scalable, 

Page 8 of 9

cost-effective,  and  more  easily  accessible.  Furthermore, 
the results highlight the importance of collaboration and 
building a therapeutic alliance with the clinician to effec-
tively manage moments of emotional crisis, thereby low-
ering suicidality and improving everyday wellbeing.
