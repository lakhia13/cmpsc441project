Abstract: Dissociative disorders are a common and frequently undiagnosed group of psychiatric
disorders, characterized by disruptions in the normal integration of awareness, personality, emotion
and behavior. The available evidence suggests that these disorders arise from an interaction between
genetic vulnerability and stress, particularly traumatic stress, but the attention paid to the underlying
genetic diatheses has been sparse. In this paper, the existing literature on the molecular genetics
of dissociative disorders, as well as of clinically signiﬁcant dissociative symptoms not reaching
the threshold of a disorder, is reviewed comprehensively across clinical and non-clinical samples.
Association studies suggest a link between dissociative symptoms and genes related to serotonergic,
dopaminergic and peptidergic transmission, neural plasticity and cortisol receptor sensitivity, partic-
ularly following exposure to childhood trauma. Genome-wide association studies have identiﬁed
loci of interest related to second messenger signaling and synaptic integration. Though these ﬁndings
are inconsistent, they suggest biologically plausible mechanisms through which traumatic stress can
lead to pathological dissociation. However, methodological concerns related to phenotype deﬁnition,
study power, and correction for the confounding factors limit the value of these ﬁndings, and they
require replication and extension in studies with better design.

1. Introduction

Dissociative disorders represent an important group of psychiatric disorders occurring
in response to stress or trauma [1]. According to the American Psychiatric Association’s Di-
agnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), these disorders
are characterized by “a disruption of and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of con-
sciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control, and
behavior” [2]. The disorders in this group include depersonalization/derealization disorder,
dissociative amnesia, and dissociative identity disorder. The estimated lifetime prevalence
of these disorders is around 10% in general population samples [3–5], with higher rates be-
ing reported in patients seeking treatment for other psychiatric disorders [6,7] and in groups
exposed to trauma [8–10]. In addition to these discrete syndromes, clinically signiﬁcant
symptoms of dissociation occur in a wide range of other psychiatric disorders, including
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), personality disorders, somatic symptom disorders,
depression, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders [11]. Dissociative disorders tend to run
a chronic course [12], and are associated with elevated levels of disability, impaired quality
of life, a high economic cost, and a signiﬁcantly increased risk of suicide attempts [13,14].
In spite of the substantial burden associated with these conditions, patients suffering from
them often go undiagnosed and untreated [7,15]. This is due to several factors, including
variations in criteria across diagnostic systems [16], negative attitudes towards these disor-
ders among both the general public and mental health professionals [17,18], and therapeutic
pessimism arising from a paucity of evidence-based treatment approaches [19,20].

From a psychological perspective, research into the etiology of dissociative disorders
has centered on “post-traumatic” and “socio-cognitive” models; however, more recent
evidence suggests that neither model is completely satisfactory. Instead, these disorders
should be understood as involving impairments in multiple domains of mental functioning,
including self-regulation, reality testing, cognitive attributions, and higher-order cognitive
processes [21]. Neurobiological evidence converges with this perspective, suggesting that
dissociative disorders are best understood as belonging to a group of trauma-related disor-
ders which share certain key structural and functional abnormalities. These include grey
matter volume reductions in key limbic system structures, the dysregulation of prefrontal–
limbic circuitry, and the altered functioning of the hypothalamic–pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
axis [22]. These structural and functional alterations may underlie the multiple domains
of impairment identiﬁed in psychological research. A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed re-
ductions in the volume of hippocampus, basal ganglia and thalami, increased levels of the
neuropeptide transmitters oxytocin and prolactin, and reduced levels of the inﬂammatory
marker tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) as replicable biological markers of dissociative
disorders [23]. Attempts to integrate the results of biological and psychological research
into possible models of pathogenesis have already been made in the case of dissociative
identity disorders [24] and dissociative amnesia [25,26].

A key ﬁnding from empirical research is that dissociation is a frequent, but not
universal, response following exposure to a traumatic stressor. For example, around 20–25%
of individuals exposed to a disaster may experience transient dissociative symptoms, but
only a small proportion of them fulﬁll criteria for a later dissociative disorder [27]. Similarly,
a study of women who had been held captive and subjected to sexual violence by a militant
group found that only 41% met criteria for a dissociative disorder [28]. The ﬁnding that
dissociation is not an invariable result of traumatic stress, even when severe and prolonged,
suggests that some of this variation is due to an innate predisposition which is at least
partly genetic in origin [29,30]. This hypothesis is supported by the results of twin studies
which suggest that dissociation has a heritable component [31,32]. Understanding the
contributions of speciﬁc genetic factors to dissociative disorders, whether in terms of
monogenic, polygenic or epigenetic processes, would deepen our understanding of the
stress–diathesis equation in these disorders. The insights obtained from molecular genetic
data could potentially open the door to more effective forms of prevention and treatment,
including early intervention strategies following a mass traumatic event. The current paper
attempts to aid in this understanding by reviewing the scientiﬁc literature on the genetics
of dissociative symptoms and disorders.

2. Materials and Methods

The current review was conducted in line with the principles outlined in the PRISMA
guidelines [33]. A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Scopus and ProQuest literature
databases was carried out using the key search terms “dissociative disorder”, “dissociative
disorders”, “dissociative identity disorder”, “depersonalization”, “derealization”, and
“dissociative amnesia” in association with “genetic”, “gene”, “polymorphism”, “genome”,
“genome-wide”, “epigenetic”, “heritability”, and “inheritance”. All articles published up
to 31 March 2022 were included. The complete search strategy is provided in Table S1.

Papers were included in the review if they presented the results of genetic studies of
either (a) dissociative disorders, as deﬁned by DSM-5, or (b) clinically signiﬁcant disso-
ciative symptoms (“pathological dissociation”) either alone or in conjunction with other
psychiatric disorders, as measured using a standardized rating scale. A total of 588 citations
were retrieved through the above search. After the removal of 186 duplicate citations,
402 citations (title and abstract) were screened. At this stage, 255 citations unrelated to
the subject were excluded, and 147 papers were assessed for eligibility. Of these, only
17 met the criteria for inclusion in this review. To ensure that no citations were missed in
this process, the following precautions were taken: (a) citation lists from each database
were entered into individual data sheets and cross-checked against each other, and (b) the

Genes 2022, 13, 843

reference lists of all published studies were checked for relevant citations that may have
been missed in a standard search. No additional papers were included as a result of (b). An
outline of this process is provided in Figure 1 and complete details of reasons for exclusion
are provided in Table S2.

When planning this review, a specific problem was posed by studies of “non-pathological”
dissociative experiences, which can occur in healthy individuals and do not qualify for a
psychiatric diagnosis. While some authors consider these experiences to lie on a continuum
with dissociative symptoms or disorders [34,35], the majority of contemporary researchers
make a clear distinction between “normal” and “pathological” dissociation based on
psychometric data [36–38]. As only two studies of this phenomenon were included in this
review, their ﬁndings are discussed along with the rest of the included studies.

The quality of individual studies was assessed using the Q-Genie tool, which is an
11-item scale speciﬁcally developed to assess the quality of genetic association studies for
the purpose of a literature review or meta-analysis [39]. These guidelines include an item
covering the risk of bias, which is reported separately along with the total score for the
purposes of this review. For genetic studies containing a comparison group, study quality
was rated based on the total Q-Genie score as poor (≤35), moderate (36–45), or good (>45).
For studies without a comparison group, the corresponding cut-offs were: poor (≤32),
moderate (33–40), and good (>40). Bias was rated on a seven-point scale, with the following

To ensure that no citations were missed in this process, the following precautions were taken: (a) citation lists from each database were entered into individual data sheets and cross-checked against each other, and (b) the reference lists of all published studies were checked for relevant citations that may have been missed in a standard search.

categories: poor (1–2), good (3–4), very good (5–6), and excellent (7). Complete scores for
each article are provided in Table S3.

Due to the small number of relevant studies and signiﬁcant methodological hetero-

geneity, a formal meta-analysis was not carried out.

3. Results

A total of seventeen studies were included in the ﬁnal review [40–56]. The majority of
these were association studies involving a small number of predeﬁned genetic polymor-
phisms or genotypes, with or without a gene–environment interaction (G×E) component
(n = 12); there were three genome-wide association studies, one gene expression study, and
one study making use of polygenic risk scores. A complete description of these studies is
provided in Table 1.

3.1. Quality of the Included Studies

Q-Genie scores for each study are provided in the Supplementary Material. An exami-
nation of the total Q-Genie scores for each study found that nine studies were rated as “mod-
erate” in quality” [40,42,43,45,46,48,50,53,54], seven were rated as “good” [44,47,49,51,52,55,56],
and only one was rated as “poor” [41]. The mean Q-Genie score was 39.3 for studies
without a control group (n = 11) and 43.3 for studies with a control group (n = 6), indicating
an overall “moderate” quality of research in this ﬁeld.

When evaluating studies speciﬁcally in terms of bias, thirteen studies received a rating
of “good” and four studies were rated “poor”; no study received a rating of “very good”
or “excellent” when evaluated for sources of bias. The mean overall score for bias was 3.1,
indicating an overall “good” quality for the included studies.

An additional issue of concern was that several authors, particularly those of asso-
ciation and G×E studies, reported concerns related to study power sample size. Twelve
studies received a rating of “poor” (scores 1–2) on this item, and only four studies received
a score of “good” or “very good” (scores 3–5). The mean score on this item across all
included studies was 2.5, indicating signiﬁcant concerns related to study power.

3.2. Study Populations

None of the included studies focused on patients with a primary diagnosis of dis-
sociative disorder. Two studies were conducted in “normal” adults, with no medical or
psychiatric diagnosis, selected from the general population [46,54]. Five studies were con-
ducted in subjects considered to be “high-risk” or vulnerable, including participants from
socially and economically deprived backgrounds [47,52] and victims of trauma [41,45,49].
Three studies were based on samples from participants in biobanking programs who had
a wide range of medical or psychiatric diagnoses [51,55,56]. The remaining studies were
conducted in patients with a primary psychiatric diagnosis other than a dissociative dis-
order, including obsessive–compulsive and related disorders (OCD) [40,42], borderline
personality disorder [44,48], depression [50,53] and bipolar disorder (BD) [43]. The major-
ity of studies were conducted in adults, with only two studies focusing on children and
adolescents [41,52]. None of the studies involved a replication of current or past ﬁndings in
a separate study population.

Ethnicity and gender are important potential confounding factors in studies of neu-
ropsychiatric genetics [57–60]. Eight of the seventeen studies were conducted in samples
where an attempt was made to ensure a degree of ethnic homogeneity: seven studies
of subjects of Caucasian/European descent [40,42,45,49,51,55], and one each of Mexican-
American [53] and Japanese [54] descent. Three studies recruited only women in an attempt

Genes 2022, 13, 843

8 of 17

to correct for the inﬂuence of gender [47,48,50], while the remainder included both men
and women. In all studies with samples of mixed ethnicity or gender, attempts to correct
for these confounders were reported in the study methodology and results.

3.3. Deﬁnition of the Phenotype of Interest

A clear deﬁnition of the phenotype being studied in relation to genetic variants is es-
sential in psychiatric genetics, where the categorical diagnoses used in clinical practice may
not correspond to meaningful subtypes at the biological level [61]. Only three of the studies
included in this review used categorical diagnoses as the phenotype of interest, due to their
reliance on medical records, and in these studies dissociative disorders were “lumped”
together with anxiety and phobic disorders [51,55,56]. This signiﬁcantly limits the validity
of any conclusions that can be drawn from these studies with regard to dissociation alone.
In contrast, the majority of studies [40–48,52,54] measured total dissociative symptoms
using a standardized rating scale, such as the Dissociative Experiences Scale. Such psy-
chometric instruments provide a total score, a “cut-off” value indicating “pathological
dissociation” likely to be of clinical signiﬁcance, and sub-scale scores for distinct symptom
dimensions, such as amnesia and depersonalization/derealization. In theory, this should
allow for a more “ﬁne-grained” analysis of dissociative symptoms in relation to genotypes;
however, such an analysis was carried out only in a few of the included studies [46,54].
The remaining three studies measured only depersonalization/derealization symptoms
and did not examine other sets of symptoms; thus, their ﬁndings were applicable only
to this speciﬁc dimension of dissociative symptomatology [49,50,53]. As noted above, no
study including patients with dissociative disorders alone was identiﬁed for inclusion in
this review. A complete description of the rating scales used in each study is provided in

Twelve of the studies included in this review attempted to establish an association
between dissociation and either a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or a genotype
involving a limited number of polymorphisms or variants.

Six of these studies focused on genetic variants associated with the monoamine neu-
rotransmitters serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline, which are associated with stress-
and trauma-related disorders [62]. The most commonly studied variant (n = 4) was 5-
HTTLPR, a functional polymorphism of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter.
Two studies found an association between the “short” (s) allele of this polymorphism,
particularly the homozygous s/s genotype, and dissociative symptoms [42,46]; however,
two other studies failed to ﬁnd any association between this polymorphism and disso-
ciation [40,43]. An equally frequent subject of study was the COMT gene, encoding the
catechol-O-methyltransferase enzyme involved in the catabolism of dopamine and nore-
pinephrine. A study of adults involved in road trafﬁc accidents found an association
between a “pain-sensitive” COMT haplotype, involving four functional polymorphisms
(rs4633-rs4680-rs4818-rs6269 A_C_C_G), and dissociative symptoms [45], while a study
of healthy adults found an association between the COMT rs4680 (Val158Met) SNP and
both total dissociative and depersonalization/derealization symptoms [54]. However, as
in the case of 5-HTTLPR, negative results were obtained in two studies [40,43]. Studies of
other monoamine-related polymorphisms or variants, such as those involving the genes
for the dopamine type 4 receptor (DRD4), the dopamine transporter (DAT), the serotonin
type 1B and type 2C receptors (HTR1B, HTR2C), and the enzymes tryptophan hydroxylase
1 (TPH1) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) did not yield any signiﬁcant results with
reference to dissociation [40,43]

Among other variants studied using an association design, two functional polymor-
phisms (rs3800373, rs1360870) of the FKBP5 gene, encoding a protein that regulates gluco-
corticoid receptor sensitivity [63], were associated with dissociation during and after acute
physical injury in children [41]. Possible associations between three functional polymor-

Genes 2022, 13, 843

9 of 17

phisms (rs7607967, rs4371369, rs4387806) of the SCN9A gene, encoding a voltage-gated
sodium channel expressed in limbic system structures, were observed in women with
borderline personality disorder, but these ﬁndings were insigniﬁcant after statistical cor-
rection [44]. The Met allele of the rs6265 polymorphism of the BDNF gene, encoding
the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, was associated with lower levels of dissociation
in patients with bipolar disorder and their relatives [43]; this variant is associated with
a reduced susceptibility to post-traumatic stress disorder [64]. A study of the oxytocin
receptor gene (OXTR), which is associated with stress sensitivity, found an association
between homozygosity for the G allele of the rs53576 functional polymorphism in this gene
and dissociation, but this was not statistically signiﬁcant.

3.5. Gene–Environment Interactions

There is an increasing amount of evidence that trauma-related disorders arise from a
dynamic interaction between genes and the environment [65]. In line with this model, six
studies have examined the interaction between a speciﬁc genotype and exposure to adverse
environmental circumstances in relation to dissociation. Two studies, one of normal adults
and one of patients with OCD, found a signiﬁcant interaction between the 5-HTTLPR s/s
genotype, childhood trauma, and subsequent dissociative symptoms [42,46]; however, a
negative result for an s/s x childhood trauma interaction was noted in bipolar patients
and their relatives [43]. A study of patients with bipolar disorder and their relatives
found a signiﬁcant interaction between the COMT rs4680 Val allele, childhood trauma,
and dissociative symptoms [43]. A study of depressed and healthy women found that
the rs53576 G/G genotype of OXTR was associated with dissociative symptoms in those
with a history of unresolved childhood attachment [50]. Finally, two studies examined
a haplotype involving four functional polymorphisms (rs3800373, rs9296158, rs1360870,
rs9470080 C_A_T_T) of the FKBP5 gene. While this haplotype was associated with an
elevated risk of dissociation in low-income women with a history of childhood trauma [47],
it appeared to have the opposite effect in low-income adolescents; adolescents with this
haplotype had lower dissociative symptoms even when exposed to signiﬁcant trauma
from an early age [52]. No evidence of gene–environment interaction was observed for the
functional variants of the DRD4 or DAT genes in one of these studies [43].

3.6. Genome-Wide Association Studies

Three genome-wide association studies were identiﬁed in the literature. Only one of
these speciﬁcally examined dissociative symptoms followed trauma as a phenotype [49]. In
this study, no signiﬁcant associations were found; however, suggestive “peak” associations
were reported for the adenylyl cyclase 8 gene (ADCY8) and the dipeptidyl-peptidase 6 gene
(DPP6). The authors did not report any association between post-traumatic dissociation
and any of the genes identiﬁed through association studies, such as 5HTT, COMT or
FKBP5, though marginal associations were identiﬁed for FKBP5 and COMT which were
insigniﬁcant after statistical correction.

The two remaining genome-wide studies, based on large samples from biobanking
projects, did not study dissociative disorders or symptoms as a primary objective; they
examined a large number of groups of disorders affecting various organs and systems,
one of which was “anxiety, phobic and dissociative disorders”. One of these identiﬁed a
potential association between “anxiety, phobic and dissociative disorders” and a region
of chromosome 4 containing the amyloid beta precursor protein-binding family member
2 (ABPP2) gene [51]; the other did not report any signiﬁcant association for this group of
disorders [56].

3.7. Other Study Designs

Three additional studies on the genetics of dissociative disorders or symptoms did not

ﬁt into any speciﬁc category and are described here.

Genes 2022, 13, 843

In a study of a small sample of women hospitalized with borderline personality
disorder, an association was found between dissociative symptoms and the increased
expression of the interleukin-6 (IL6) gene. Subjects with higher levels of these symptoms
also had decreased expression of the following genes: interleukin 1-beta (IL1B), mitogen-
activated protein kinases-1, -3, and -8 (MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8), G-protein subunit
alpha-I2 (GNAI2), arrestin beta-1 and -2 (ARRB1, ARRB2), and cyclic AMP responsive
element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) [48].

In a study involving only subjects of Mexican-American ancestry, an analysis of
nineteen SNPs identiﬁed as associated with depression in earlier research were examined
in relation to various symptoms of depression. It was found that this speciﬁc set of SNPs
was associated with lower depersonalization/derealization symptoms in patients with
depression; however, this was not the primary objective of the study [53].

Using polygenic risk scores, a study of 10182 subjects of European descent participating
in a biobanking program found that the polygenic risk scores for both depression and
bipolar disorder were signiﬁcantly associated with the group of “anxiety, phobic and
dissociative disorders”, suggesting a potential genetic association between these groups of
disorders [56].

Speciﬁc details of the results of individual studies in terms of scores on standardized

rating scales are available in Table S4.

4. Discussion

When compared with other psychiatric disorders or symptom domains, dissociative
disorders and symptoms have been relatively under-studied from a genetic perspective.
When familial patterns were observed for these disorders, they were often explained exclu-
sively on the basis of psychological mechanisms, such as exposure to trauma or learned
behavior [66,67]. Family and twin-based genetic studies of dissociative disorder have
suggested that this condition has a substantial heritable component [31,32,68], but the
results of these studies were not consistent [69,70] due to methodological limitations and
the assumptions made when assessing patterns of inheritance. In contrast with these
earlier approaches, molecular genetic studies hold the promise of identifying the biological
mechanisms associated with vulnerability to dissociative symptoms and disorders with
increasing precision, thus allowing for a more accurate approach to diagnosis and man-
agement [22] as well as a deeper understanding of the place of dissociation in psychiatric
classiﬁcation [71,72].

In this review, preliminary evidence for an association between dissociative symptoma-
tology and variations in individual genes was identiﬁed. The genes implicated are related
to monoaminergic transmission (5-HTT, COMT), neural plasticity (BDNF), neuropeptide
receptors (OXTR), and the regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (FKBP5).
These genes have been associated with other stress- and trauma-related symptoms and
disorders [73–76], though results have not always been consistent. Studies in patients
with dissociative disorders or symptoms have also found indirect evidence of dysfunction
involving these systems. For example, dissociative symptoms are associated with a poorer
response to serotonergic antidepressants in patients being treated for other disorders [77,78];
the pharmacological manipulation of serotonergic transmission can induce dissociative
symptoms [79,80]; levels of noradrenaline and dopamine are found to be elevated in certain
dissociative states [81]; dissociative disorders are associated with higher levels of the neu-
ropeptides oxytocin and prolactin [23]; and pathological and non-pathological dissociative
experiences are associated with distinctive alterations in cortisol secretion [82]. While these
ﬁndings provide a certain degree of biological plausibility to the results of these single-gene
association studies, it is also important to note that these ﬁndings have not been replicated
consistently, and that these loci were identiﬁed as being unrelated to, or only marginally
associated with, dissociation in a genome-wide analysis [49]. It is therefore unlikely that
these variants account for a substantial proportion of the risk for dissociation, though a case

Genes 2022, 13, 843

11 of 17

could still be made for the role of gene–environment interactions with childhood adversity
in the case of the 5-HTT, COMT, OXTR and FKBP5 functional polymorphisms.

The results of genome-wide association studies suggest a possible association with
loci within the ADYC8, DPP6, and APBB2 genes. There is evidence linking variations
in these genes with other psychiatric disorders. ADCY8 codes for the enzyme adenylyl
cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate into cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP), a key second messenger for several neurotransmitters. It has been
associated with comorbid alcohol dependence and depression in women [83], obsessive–
compulsive disorder [84], and avoidance behavior related to mood disorders in an animal
model [85]. DPP6, which encodes a potassium channel subunit related to the excitability of
neuronal dendrites and synaptic integration, has been associated with tic disorder [86]. Both
ADYC8 and DPP6 have also been linked to brain development in childhood [84,87], which
may be of relevance to dissociative disorders associated with trauma-related alterations in
brain development [88,89]. In contrast, APBB2, which encodes an amyloid beta precursor-
binding protein, has been associated with dementia [90]. This ﬁnding is of equal interest
given the emerging evidence of a prospective association between trauma, traumatic stress-
related disorders, and subsequent dementia later in life [91]. Despite this supporting
evidence, it must be noted that no consistent or highly signiﬁcant ﬁnding has been reported
in the GWAS of dissociative symptoms or dissociative disorder; therefore, these results
should be interpreted with caution.

The interpretation of other study designs [48,53,55] is less straightforward. However,
evidence for increased IL6 gene expression is consistent with reports of elevated interleukin-
6 (IL-6) being associated with dissociative symptoms in depression [92] and with elevated
levels of IL-6 in other trauma spectrum disorders [93]. However, IL-6 levels measured
immediately after trauma did not appear to predict the course of subsequent trauma-
related disorders [94], suggesting that these alterations may appear later in the course
of the illness. Likewise, the polygenic association between dissociative disorders and
mood disorders is consistent with evidence of high levels of dissociative symptoms in
some patients with major depression; some researchers have considered the possibility of
a “dissociative depression” subtype associated with childhood abuse and a higher risk of
suicide attempts [95], which is consistent with a complex, shared genetic architecture for
these disorders.

Several methodological issues should be taken into account when appraising these
results. First, though the existing research is of acceptable quality with regard to sources
of bias, it is of only “moderate” quality overall, and signiﬁcant concerns exist with regard
to sample size and study power. None of the included studies involved patients with a
primary diagnosis of dissociative disorder. Several studies were carried out in patients with
another psychiatric diagnosis, introducing a substantial confounding factor. Association
studies generally focused on genes related to a limited number of neural or neuroendocrine
pathways, many of which are non-speciﬁcally associated with a wide range of psychiatric
disorders [96,97]. In gene–environment designs, only speciﬁc forms of environmental risk,
such as childhood abuse by parents or caregivers, were assessed; other relevant forms of
traumatic stress, such as bullying by peers, intimate partner violence, or sexual assault
after adolescence, were not investigated despite their relevance to dissociation [98–100].
In studies measuring dissociative symptoms, there was signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the
instruments used to measure symptom severity, as well as in the speciﬁc type(s) of symp-
toms being studied; in some cases, data on different dimensions of dissociation in relation
to the genotype was not analyzed, despite being available. In genome-wide association
studies, dissociative disorders were grouped together with anxiety and phobic disorders for
analysis in some cases. While this is an inherent limitation of using biobank data in which
patient diagnoses are coded using older classiﬁcatory systems, it reduces the speciﬁcity of
any reported ﬁndings with reference to dissociation, per se. Not all studies made attempts
to correct for confounding factors such as sex and ethnicity. Finally, none of the included
studies included a validation of their ﬁndings in a separate sample or population. Because

Genes 2022, 13, 843

12 of 17

of these limitations, it is possible that both false negative (due to low study power) and
false positive (due to variations in phenotype, multiple confounding factors, and a lack of
replicated associations) results may have been reported in individual studies. In practical
terms, this implies that the results reported here are in need of replication before they
can truly inform our understanding of the molecular processes underlying dissociative
disorders and symptoms.

There are also certain limitations inherent to this review. The retrieval of citations from
three speciﬁc databases may have led to the inadvertent omission of certain key studies.
The marked heterogeneity across studies and the lack of replicated ﬁndings for individual
associations precluded a formal meta-analysis, limiting the conﬁdence that can be placed
in the conclusions drawn above. The current review included only studies of dissociative
disorders or symptoms as deﬁned using current criteria; it is possible that conditions such
as somatoform and conversion disorders, though placed in separate categories in current
systems of classiﬁcation, may be genetically and neurobiologically linked to dissociation
and thus should be studied together [22,101]. As no study included patients with a primary
diagnosis of dissociative disorders, as mentioned above, one of the objectives of this review
could not be met. Finally, as the review was carried out by a single reviewer, there is a
possibility that certain relevant papers may not have been included, though attempts were
made to reduce this possibility to the maximum extent possible.

Despite these limitations, the existing evidence suggests the possibility of links be-
tween dissociative symptoms and speciﬁc genes related to monoamine transmission, neural
plasticity, hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis functioning, peptidergic neurotransmission,
second messenger signaling, and synaptic integration. Dissociative symptoms may arise
from an interaction between functional variants in these genes and early life adversity,
particularly childhood abuse. These ﬁndings require replication in larger and more ho-
mogenous samples, as do the more tentative ﬁndings linking dissociation to genes involved
in immune functioning. From a clinical perspective, it is possible that the pharmacological
manipulation of these pathways may result in the development of better treatments for
dissociative disorders. From a more fundamental perspective, there is a need to examine
the genetics of dissociation from the point of view of other biomarkers identiﬁed in the
literature. Potential genetic variants of interest that have not yet been studied include
the prolactin receptor [23], opioid peptide receptors [81], genes involved in cytokine sig-
naling [94], and genes involved in lipid metabolism [102]. Studies of gene–environment
interactions should move beyond the examination of childhood trauma to include both
subtler disruptions in attachment bonds [50] and the effect of traumatic stress later in life,
both at an individual level and in survivors of disasters or mass casualties. There is also
a need for enhanced genome-wide association studies involving either a more precise
deﬁnition of the “dissociative” phenotype, or an exploration of shared, “common” genetic
factors underlying the co-occurrence of dissociative and other disorders. Epigenetic studies
could lead to a more dynamic model of alterations in gene expression and their downstream
consequences in patients with clinically signiﬁcant dissociation [103]. Finally, studies of the
genetics of dissociation in relation to other trauma spectrum disorders, such as PTSD and
borderline personality disorder, would aid the identiﬁcation of shared and unique genetic
vulnerabilities for this group of disorders.

5. Conclusions

Despite the relatively small number of studies in this area, research on the molec-
ular genetics of dissociative symptoms and disorders has yielded clues pointing both
towards conventional, “stress-related” neural mechanisms and novel genetic loci of in-
terest. These results should be interpreted with caution in view of the methodological
limitations discussed. However, these ﬁndings provide a foundation that can be built upon
by further studies with more complex designs, and it is hoped that this will lead to a better
understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of this group of trauma-related disorders.
