Cyclothymic disorder is a mental disorder. It is a mild form ofbipolar disorder(manic depressive illness), in which a person has mood swings over a period of years that go from milddepressionto emotional highs.

The causes of cyclothymic disorder are unknown. Major depression, bipolar disorder, and cyclothymia often occur together in families. This suggests that these mood disorders share similar causes.

Cyclothymia usually begins early in life. Men and women are equally affected.

Symptoms may include any of the following:

- Periods (episodes) of extreme happiness and high activity or energy (hypomanic symptoms), or low mood, activity, or energy (depressive symptoms) for at least 2 years (1 or more years in children and adolescents).

- These mood swings are less severe than with bipolar disorder or major depression.

- Ongoing symptoms, with no more than 2 symptom-free months in a row.


## Exams and Tests


The diagnosis is usually based on your mood history. Your health care provider may order blood and urine tests to check for medical causes of mood swings.

Treatments for this disorder include mood-stabilizing medicine, antidepressants, talk therapy, or some combination of these three treatments.

Some of the more commonly used mood stabilizers are lithium and antiseizure medicines.

Compared with bipolar disorder, some people with cyclothymia may not respond as well to medicines.
