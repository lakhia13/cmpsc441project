In adults, muscle disease (MD)

is typically a chronic long-
Introduction:
term condition that can lead to a reduced quality of
life (QoL). Previous
research suggests that a psychological intervention, in particular Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy (ACT), may help improve QoL for individuals living with
chronic conditions such as MD.

Methods: This nested qualitative study was incorporated within a randomized
controlled trial which evaluated a guided self-help ACT intervention for people
living with MD to explore their experiences of the intervention. Semi-structured
interviews (n = 20) were conducted with those who had received ACT. Data were
analyzed via thematic analysis.

Results: There were four overarching themes. (1) Views on whether therapy
sessions would help with a medical condition: participants’ expectations regarding
ACT varied. Some participants were skeptical about mindfulness.
I was
able to look at things in a different way: participants described increased
meaningful activity, greater awareness of thoughts and emotions and acceptance
or adaptation to mobility problems. Some described improvement in the quality
of relationships and a sense of feeling free. (3) Treating the body and the mind
together: following the intervention participants noted that a holistic approach
to healthcare is beneﬁcial. (4) Intervention delivery: The remote delivery was
generally seen as helpful for practical reasons and allowed participants to speak
openly. Participants voiced a need for follow-up sessions.

Discussion: Overall, the intervention was experienced as acceptable. Suggested
improvements included de-emphasizing the role of mindfulness and adding
follow-up sessions.

Introduction

(MDs),

such as

the QoL of

Muscle diseases

limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, and inclusion body
myositis, are primary disorders of the muscle that can be acquired
or genetic. In the UK, MDs have an estimated prevalence of 29.5
per 100,000—equating to 110,000 children and adults (Carey
et al., 2021). Across 19 countries,
the combined prevalence
for all muscular dystrophies ranges from 19.8 and 25.1 per
100,000 person-years (Theadom et al., 2015). They are usually
chronic and progressive and are currently without a deﬁnitive
cure. They involve muscle wasting and weakness, which causes
insidious declines in mobility and physical functioning. Many
with MD eventually require mobility aides, including wheelchairs
and orthoses. MDs are also associated with chronic pain, sleep
disturbance, and fatigue (Merrison and Hanna, 2009; Della Marca
et al., 2013). Given these challenges, it is unsurprising that on
average people with MD experience reduced quality of life (QoL)
(Graham et al., 2011), and some experience anxiety and depression
(Kelly et al., 2022).
However,

individuals with MD is not only
aﬀected by disease severity or physical disability (Graham et al.,
2011, 2014; Burns et al., 2012; Rose et al., 2012). A wide
range of psychological variables, including illness beliefs (Graham
et al., 2013, 2014), coping methods (Ahlstrom and Sjoden, 1996;
Natterlund et al., 2001; Graham et al., 2014), and psychological
ﬂexibility (Graham C. D. et al., 2016), signiﬁcantly contribute to
QoL. This presents the possibility that interventions designed to
improve key psychological factors could improve QoL in MD, even
in the absence of disease-modifying treatments (Graham et al.,
2015). Given the limited research into psychological interventions
for MD, we set out to develop and trial a psychological intervention
for improving QoL in MD (Thompson et al., 2022). Among
candidate approaches, we chose Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy (ACT). ACT is designed to improve a psychological
process called “psychological ﬂexibility,” which,
in a previous
observational study in MD, was predictive of QoL (Graham C. D.
et al., 2016). Psychological ﬂexibility can be deﬁned as “[. . . ] the
capacity to persist or to change behavior in a way that includes
conscious and open contact with thoughts and feelings, appreciates
what the situation aﬀords, and serves one’s goals and values”
(McCracken and Vowles, 2014). Many have argued that ACT is
particularly suited to helping people live well with chronic diseases
such as MD (Graham et al., 2015), motor neurone disease (Gould
et al., 2015), and multiple sclerosis (Thompson et al., 2022). A
pragmatic beneﬁt of ACT is that it aims to help participants live well
in contexts where uncomfortable thoughts and emotions reﬂect an
objectively diﬃcult situation, such as living with a chronic disease
(Graham C. et al., 2016). ACT diﬀers from CBT in that it is
concerned with people’s relationship with thoughts rather than the
content of thoughts. ACT also includes acceptance-based emotion
regulation strategies, which are encouraged when acceptance of
diﬃcult feelings facilitates life-enriching activity (e.g., showing
willingness to experience the anxiety that accompanies using a
wheelchair, to facilitate traveling to meet friends for coﬀee).

Following a promising preliminary pilot case series of a
guided self-help intervention with people with MD (Graham

(LGMD), Becker’s muscular dystrophy

al., 2017), we undertook the

While the aforementioned quantitative data are important for

examining the experience of
those who participated in the
intervention. A qualitative study nested within a clinical trial
can oﬀer a greater understanding of the acceptability of the
intervention and other treatment eﬀects, intended or otherwise,
not captured by standardized quantitative measures. It can also
provide clues regarding barriers and facilitators to engagement
and key treatment processes (Lewin et al., 2009; O’Cathain et al.,
2014).

There have been several nested qualitative studies of
remote guided self-help ACT interventions
in long-term
health conditions—including people living with chronic pain
and carers of people living with cancer and dementia (Köhle
et al., 2017; Bendelin et al., 2020; Contreras et al., 2022). In
all, participants described making conscious changes to their
behavior in line with the ACT model. Experiences of

the pressure of having to work to a deadline (Bendelin et al.,

brief input from therapists. Some participants felt understood
and supported, whereas others had hoped for deeper, more
personalized discussions.

Intervention

To accommodate mobility issues, which could potentially
reduce engagement with therapy, we conﬁgured the intervention
for remote delivery as guided self-help. There is increasing evidence
for the eﬃcacy of remotely delivered interventions,
including
ACT, with a recent meta-analysis highlighting that self-guided
online ACT (delivered through telephone or website) produced
signiﬁcantly greater outcomes than waitlist controls at post-
treatment for variables including anxiety, depression, and quality of
life for a range of mental health diﬃculties (Klimczak et al., 2023).
The intervention was conceptualized for participants as oﬀering
them the opportunity to try out some “psychological skills” in
everyday life to see if these prove helpful. A series of four skills
was delineated to cover the breadth of psychological ﬂexibility
and presented to participants: mindfulness; unhooking (from
thoughts); follow your values; and take an observer perspective.
The intervention was delivered over 5 weeks and comprised four
booklets, audio ﬁles containing mindfulness exercises, and ﬁve
telephone or video calls delivered by a therapist trained in ACT (For
more details on the composition of the intervention, see Rose et al.,
2018, 2022).

Recruitment

To be eligible for the ACTMus, study participants had to be
adults (18 years and over) diagnosed with one of the following
MDs that has been present for more than 6 months: LGMD, BMD,
FSHD, or IBM. At the time of enrolment, they had to have reported
moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety and/or depression on
the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; scoring ≥7
for either the anxiety or depression subscales). Participants were
excluded based on the presence of health co-morbidities unrelated
to MD, or treatments or situations that could make participation
inappropriate (see Rose et al., 2018, 2022 for complete details).

For the nested qualitative study, all participants enrolled into
the ACTMus trial were given the option of providing their consent
to be contacted at the end of the study to discuss their experiences
with a member of the research team. They consented to this
being audio recorded so the research team could transcribe the
conversation and explore common themes.

Procedures and data collection

all

the

intervention,

Upon completion of

consenting
participants randomized to the ACT plus standard medical
care were contacted consecutively by a research assistant [RA
(VE)]. This process and the qualitative analysis occurred before the
trial data were analyzed (Rose et al., 2022). Enrolment continued
until the point of data saturation, the point that no new themes
were emerging.

The RA (VE) collected the qualitative data through semi-
structured interviews consisting of a set of open questions
and prompts (see Supplementary material) designed to elicit
participants’ perspectives on receiving ACT. The interview

began with questions focused on participants’ expectations pre-
intervention and experiences during and after the intervention. All
the interviews were conducted one-on-one by the same researcher
over the telephone and recorded. Interviews lasted between 30 and
60 minutes.

Interviews took place between January and November 2017 and
were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The RA who collected,
transcribed, and analyzed the qualitative data was not involved
in the development of the ACT intervention, nor its delivery,
but was involved in the recruitment and data collection of trial
participants. The RA had a master’s degree and attended additional
University-run training in NVivo. Further training and supervision
were provided by the other authors with experience in the ﬁeld.

Data analysis

The RA transcribed interviews verbatim. Transcripts were
analyzed using inductive thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke,
2006, 2021) using the software NVivo version 11 (http://www.
qsrinternational.com/). Analysis began on completion of the ﬁrst
few interviews and proceeded iteratively. To obtain familiarity
with the data, transcripts were read through several times by two
researchers (VE and CV). These two researchers identiﬁed initial
codes independently and met to resolve diﬀerences in coding.
They then extracted codes and transformed them into themes in
a recursive process. Once key themes were identiﬁed, they were
discussed within the wider trial management group and reﬁned.

It is important to acknowledge that although attempts were
themes via
made to improve the reliability and validity of
independent coding, the pre-existing experiences of the researchers
will naturally have shaped theme construction. The two analysts
(VE and CV) identify as white, female, and able-bodied and work
within the psychological ﬁeld. The analysts discussed potential
assumptions and biases to increase their own awareness of
themes such as their beliefs around the value of psychological
interventions, positions as individuals without chronic health
conditions, and ethnocentric lenses. Both analysts used notes and
reﬂective journaling to record ideas and enhance transparency in
decision-making processes.

Results

Participants

A total of 27 consenting participants were contacted to take
part. Five did not respond, one person stated they were too
busy, and one person agreed, but a convenient time could not
be arranged. As a result, a total of 20 (eight male, 12 female)
participated. The mean age of participants was 52.1 years (SD =
15.15, range 29–77 years of age). Participants had one of four
MDs (seven LGMD, nine FSHD, and four IBM). No participants
had BMD. The mean duration of MD was 16.98 years (SD =
11.21, range 5–47 years). The baseline rating on the HADS for
anxiety was a mean of 11.15/21 (SD =2.94, range 7–18), and for
depression, a mean of 8.4/21 (SD = 3.12, range 2–15). Higher scores
on the HADS demonstrate greater anxiety or depression, with a

demographic information is displayed in Table 1.

Findings from analysis

Four over-arching themes were identiﬁed. These themes,
alongside sub-themes, are mapped in Figure 1 and discussed in the
text in more detail.

Theme 1: views on whether therapy sessions
would help with a medical condition

The ﬁrst theme describes participants’ recollections of their
thoughts and expectations before receiving the intervention.
a

psychological
intervention could oﬀer to people with MD, as
one participant observed:

appeared to be unsure

about what

“I wasn’t really knowing what

to expect, or whether
a therapy-based sessions would help with a medical
condition” (P11).

As denoted in this quote, it appeared that most participants
were unclear about what therapy may involve and how it might help
(rather than being skeptical). Indeed, participants largely reported
having an “open mind” (P13): “I was just very curious really. I just
didn’t know what to expect” (P10).

How therapy might help

As discussed, at the outset of the intervention, the majority
of participants reported being unsure about what the intervention
would involve despite being open-minded. However,
there
appeared to be diﬀerent ideas about how it could be of help.

(a) Emotional support

The ﬁrst subtheme refers to participants who showed awareness
of the emotional challenges that can come with MD. For them, the
intervention provided hope as a new option for managing distress.
For example, one participant stated “It just seemed interesting to
me. . . because, sometimes I do struggle with the thought of the future
and everything like that” (P4).

Another participant felt they had reached a point where “I
needed something to help me or something that I thought could
help me” (P9). This quote suggests a sense of hopefulness—that
psychological support would be helpful. This was an undertone to
several participant accounts. For example, “I got quite excited about
it, hoping it was going to be some sort of um quite um in depth
therapy. . . which I thought I knew I needed at the time” (P14).

As such, these participants were optimistic about the prospect

of receiving a psychological intervention:

“We deﬁnitely need some sort of psychological help- it’s not
that easy to be positive, it’s not that easy to carry on with life
because there are loads of times when you are upset, when it
seems to be taking over your life” (P1).

Therefore,

this subtheme describes participants who had
insight
into the psychological challenges presented by MD
and expressed hope that the psychological intervention would
be helpful.

(b) Management of MD

The majority of participants perceived the intervention as

another method for managing their MD.

“I’ve got a condition that needs managing. And part of that

management is how I think about it all” (P8).

Frontiers in Psychology

Edwards et al.

10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1233526

FIGURE 1
Thematic map of results.

This is commensurate with medical narratives about managing
a chronic condition. However, there was intrigue regarding how
management could include the mind as well as the body: “It was
interesting to explore something more cognitive I suppose, as a form
of management for a muscle wasting condition” (P2).

The perceived aim of management was often described in
practical and proactive terms, with one participant describing how
they thought the intervention would involve “. . . coming up with
some ideas on how to deal with various kinda situations and that
diﬀerent sort of coping strategies and managing strategies” (P12).

Therefore,

this group of participants perceived that

the
intervention aimed to oﬀer “tools” to help them navigate life with
MD, which is in slight contrast to participants who expected in-
depth therapy to manage emotional challenges.

(c) I didn’t quite see how talking would help

The ﬁnal subsection of participants shared that they did not

know how talking therapy could help.

“I really didn’t know what to expect, I had an open mind
and think anything that’s going to help is worth going for. I didn’t
quite see how talking would help” (P13).

A couple of participants described doubt about the potential
utility of the intervention. For example, one participant stated they
were “probably skeptical when I ﬁrst started oﬀ. . . I was more of a
physical person than a mental-type person for helping things.”

This quote illustrates an uncertainty regarding how talking

therapy could beneﬁt individuals with a physical condition.

I’m not a mindfulness sort of person

Before starting the intervention, the mindfulness component of
the intervention could elicit strong, sometimes negative, reactions.
Participants who had previous experience with mindfulness
had strong responses regarding personal applicability: “I was
already aware that mindfulness is something that is not for me” (P7)
and “I’m not a mindfulness sort of person. . . I did try it once before
but it only lasted one session. Because I thought ‘God I can’t be doing
this”’ (P8).

Other participants did not have personal experience but viewed
mindfulness negatively as a fad: “. . . its become very much the ﬂavor
of the month. . . everyone talks about mindfulness don’t they its
everywhere” (P8). As such, mindfulness was met with cynicism:
“you hear about this mindfulness. . . you think trying all that’s a load
of rubbish so the hardest part was actually buying into it. And having
a go at it” (P3).

Interestingly, a participant who by contrast did have experience
with mindfulness also reported having to overcome preconceptions
to engage in the intervention: “I sort of had a certain arrogance to it
like oh I’ve already done this, I know all about this kind of thing. And
it took me a little bit of time to get over that arrogance and go well
actually well no you still need to do it and um focus on it” (P14).

Mindfulness therefore appeared to be a term that often
elicited strong preconceptions and assumptions. Furthermore,

Frontiers in Psychology

05

frontiersin.org

Edwards et al.

10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1233526

many participants who had tried mindfulness held strong views
about whether it was “for them” or not.

Theme 2: I was able to look at things in a different
way

The following theme outlines changes participants reported

after receiving the intervention.

(a) More self-aware

Participants reported that the intervention had helped them to

approach their thoughts and feelings in new ways.

This involved becoming more aware of values, thoughts,
and feelings. For example, “I am certainly more self-aware. I
have thought quite a lot about my values in life” (P19) and “I
think prior to the course I was ﬁnding myself drifting oﬀ into
other thoughts you know instead of working on one thought at a
time” (P15).

participant described how “It’s like a dog with a bone and
you worry about it and you keep going on and on and on
and she taught me to and the module taught me to sort of

their overarching goals and values. This awareness enabled them
to actively and consciously employ skills to “step back” and take
an “observer perspective” when problematic thoughts, feelings, or
urges were present.

(b) Actions and adjustments

There were numerous reports of participants re-initiating
activities that they had previously stopped due to the progression
of MD symptoms.

One participant described how “I’ve started going out more, I’ve
started going to the gym, I’ve started going to meeting people although
we’d stop for years” (P3).

“I was quite happy not to attend certain occasions because
I would struggle to get home or what’s happening if I fell over
or do they have stairs and all this stuﬀ. And then I managed to
get myself to go several places I really enjoyed and really had a
positive impact on my life” (P1).

Participants reported that they were able to participate more
fully in enriching activities by either making practical adjustments
to the activity itself or changing their approach to it, to focus more
on the process of the activity than the outcome.

“I do try and pace myself more which means you still get
tired but you don’t get exhausted so I think it helped on that sort
of pacing myself better” (P10).

“I think it’s rather [than] setting goals and not getting them
it’s now more moving towards them. If you don’t get there but
you move towards it all the while” (P3).

(c) Acknowledging but not surrendering

Participants reported a shift following ACT toward acceptance
of physical changes, which led to enabled participation in activities
they enjoy:

“You’ve just got to learn to accept it, you’ve got to adapt
and do things diﬀerently and that’s one I suppose of the new
challenges” (P15).

Acceptance was not a passive resignation but an active process
of facing diﬃculties (and potentially diﬃcult thoughts and feelings)
to undertake enriching activities: “I think it’s the acceptance that
possibly there are some things that you won’t be able to do so don’t
make yourself feel bad about them but you’ve got to look and say
‘well can I do it and if I can, can I do it in another way which makes
it better and easier for me?”’ (P6).

This was often described as a pivotal change that participants
experienced with ACT; as one participant put it, “I think the most
important part is acknowledging but not surrendering” (P8).

One participant had not disclosed their diagnosis to many of
their friends due to fears about over-burdening them but found
that opening up to these diﬃculties allowed them to reconnect with
friends and engage in social activities:

“You can’t just pretend that’s everything’s ﬁne can you, when
it’s not. And but you haven’t got to sort of go miserable about
it either—its worked out really well—I didn’t want to burden
anyone or feel guilty or anything and it hasn’t worked out like
that its worked out absolutely super. . . if I go see my friends I
ﬁnd it very diﬃcult to open doors and they do it without thinking
now because I’ve explained it to them so that was, as I say, that
was invaluable to me” (P10).

This participant described how the intervention helped them
to open up to the present situation [“I sort of tried to pretend it
wasn’t happening before but of course it is so I suppose that sort of
quite an important lesson isn’t it” (P10)]. Furthermore, in getting
closer to these diﬃcult thoughts and feelings, they were able to take
action and share their diagnosis, which ultimately allowed them to
continue with social activities (“I didn’t want to stop going out with
my friends so I told her and when she gets the coﬀees in she’ll get
me a straw I know that sounds a silly thing but the cups are usually
too heavy”). Thus, several participants reported that acknowledging
their MD allowed them to feel less stuck and engage more fully in
meaningful activities.

(d) You can still be you

This subtheme describes how many participants felt that they
had regained a sense of their identity during the intervention.

appearance, activities, and roles within the family or at work, often
leads people to experience changes or fractures in their sense of
self. However, through the intervention, they were able to reconnect
with their sense of identity:

Basically freeing up my time, free up my mind, free up my feelings—it
frees up everything” (P1).

Therefore, engaging with the intervention appeared to generate

a feeling of liberation for several participants.

“When you have your condition you kind of like think the
old person died and kinda having to make do with the new one. . .
but you know what I’ve actually always been there, you know, I’ve
been able to be myself and that is really really good” (P16).

For some, there were indications that MD led to reduced
conﬁdence or self-worth. However, as participants acknowledged
diﬃculties and made adjustments, this enabled a renewed sense of
self-esteem and self-worth. One participant describes the process
as: “acknowledging that you changed or that change in you but also
acknowledging you still have value, but you have to sort of readjust
your life to sort of enable yourself to do that and be the person you
can be, because that’s still within you” (P8).

Another participant who stood for most of the day at work
described not wanting to disclose diﬃculties with standing. They
shared that they “always thought I wouldn’t be able to do the job if
I didn’t stand and stuﬀ like that so I was torturing my legs, for no
reason” (P4). It seems that the intervention allowed them to think
more ﬂexibly and take an “authoritative view at work” (P4). They
described how their workstation was modiﬁed, which “let me accept
the fact that I can still do my job and I can still be me and I can still
do all the stuﬀ I normally do but I just need to adapt a little bit” (P4).
As such, for some participants, acknowledging diﬃculties and
making adaptions allowed them to reconnect to lost aspects of
themselves and regain a sense of identity and self-worth.

(e) Feeling more free

Many participants reported feeling freer or more motivated to

undertake activities following ACT:

“It kick-started me into being able to sort of to free myself
really and... not hold myself back, you know because I can’t walk
anywhere” (P8).

This sense of motivation or freedom was often described
using physical terms: “It sort of has made me a bit stronger”
(P6). Interestingly, these terms were used in conjunction with
psychological skills: “I found it very helpful and intriguing just the
way that, you can use your mind to move forwards” (P11).

There was also a sense that freedom could be obtained while
accepting the use of mobility aids: “going through this sort of enabled
me to understand that although the cost to me [of using mobility
scooter] was denial or my own sort of like thoughts of embarrassment
or ‘it isn’t me, I need to explain why I’m on it’ and all this sort of
malarkey that was a negative but the beneﬁts is its opened my life
up” (P8).

In addition to the physical freedom due to increased mobility,
some participants described a “release” from thoughts and feeling
“lightened” (P9). This appeared to be facilitated by defusion
techniques taught in the intervention that showed participants
methods to stop struggling with diﬃcult thoughts: “I found that this
unhooking thing has really stayed with me and it’s changing my life.

(f) Able to connect to others

Another by-product of engaging with the intervention was
an increased connection with others. Whilst some participants
reported no changes in the quality of their relationships following
the intervention, some reported increased quantity and quality of
interactions with loved ones:

“There was one weekend I managed to spend enough record
quality time with my family that my son said ‘oh what happened
mummy you look much more happy than other times”’ (P1).

“We’ve had some various tense moments between myself
and my wife because it gets both of us after a while because
I’m slowing changing my wife from being a full-time wife to a
part-time carer and maybe eventually to a full-time carer so
obviously there are diﬃculties for her. . . but I think things are
getting easier, obviously if I’m not depressed then the bad vibes
don’t spill over” (P15).

Alongside improved mood, participants described how feeling
more “relaxed” (P15) and more themselves, “I was able to laugh
and joke and be you know exactly how I was” (P16), increased their
ability to connect with others.

Theme 3: treating the body and mind together

Our third theme relates to participants’ accounts of what
they learned post-intervention regarding the importance of
being seen holistically as a person living with MD within
healthcare treatments.

(a) You have got to have ways of managing

This

subtheme describes participants’ accounts of

the
importance of recognizing the psychological aspect of MD and the
need for support in managing a long-term condition.

“I was ﬂoating around lost and not really knowing what to
do or having any tools to kind of help me get over this idea of
coming to terms of this long-term chronic wasting disease and
it was kind of swamping me a little bit and getting me quite
down” (P14).

For some who, before receiving the intervention, had not felt
a personal need for support, there was evidence of a change in
opinion following the intervention: “Personally I thought I was in an
okay place. I didn’t really see what beneﬁts it might bring but having
done it, I can see that maybe I wasn’t quite in that okay place and it
has brought more beneﬁts. So I think it’s been, it’s been very good and
I think it would help people.” (P6).

They noticed the beneﬁt of having coping skills through
receiving a “structure and a bag of tools” (P14). These tools were
viewed as helpful for navigating the physical challenges presented
by MD:

Frontiers in Psychology

10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1233526

“You can’t physically change us, you can’t physically make
life easier or better for us in that sense but psychologically you
can kind of help us manage ourselves a bit better and if you can
give us some tools that are useful for that then that’s absolutely
brilliant” (P12).

(b) Living well with symptoms

The majority of participants reported that they were able to
respond more eﬀectively to symptoms and therefore experience a
better quality of life alongside them, “The symptoms haven’t changed
particularly. It’s more in my mind, my mind-set has changed.” (P9).
Again, there appeared to be an acceptance of symptoms and
a commitment to acting in ways that would enhance activity and
minimize suﬀering: “I’m always gonna be in a certain amount of
pain during the day . . . what I can do now is, is manage the way that
I react to those pains. . . rather than pushing myself I’ll take a step
back and just deal with it. Rather than pushing myself and hurting
myself even more.” (P11).

One participant did provide an exception in reporting a change
in their symptoms, “Obviously your arms and legs are not going to
work how they used to, but because you’re more active, your muscles
are not as, how can I explain, tight or they’re I’d say they’re not as
bad” (P16).

Through increased activity, this participant appeared to notice
positive physical by-products of the intervention. However, for
most participants, symptoms remained and what changed was how
they were responding to, and living beyond, symptoms.

(c) I would like to see it running alongside the physical support

This subtheme describes accounts relating to the need for
psychological support as part of holistic healthcare. Participants
frequently emphasized that treatment should be holistic and focus
on “the body and the mind together as a human being” (P1).
For example, “sometimes when you’ve got a physical condition the
doctors just take that, and treat that, and forget that you know, a
bigger element of living with it is in your head” (P18).

It was widely reported that psychological support should be
“running alongside” physical support, as one participant described:

“We get physio and all sorts of other things which are
speciﬁcally aimed at your physical ability—nothing else is
targeted at mental ability, psychological ability to deal with
it” (P19).

One participant described how the intervention was a
refreshing approach as healthcare appointments usually involved
measuring physical decline as opposed to considering participants’
values and plans for the future:

“you go to your occupational health assessments and stuﬀ
like that and your, your constantly asked about how you are and
what you’re doing and all this stuﬀ and your kinda treated a
bit like cattle. So no one actually or nothing really comes along
and says ‘let’s get you moving forward again’. So it was a really
refreshing approach to actually be embracing the idea of looking
forward to the future. Because it’s something that for a while I’d
actually tried either to block out or not think about” (P4).

Theme 4: intervention delivery

The ﬁnal theme concerns participants’ thoughts on the speciﬁcs

of the intervention and its delivery.

(a) Importance of the telephone calls

The telephone calls were seen as a helpful, sometimes essential

component of the intervention:

“It wouldn’t’ve worked unless you’ve got somebody on the

other end of the phone” (P13).

Although one participant said they would have preferred
the intervention without the telephone calls as they found it
too much “pressure” (P2), others described telephone sessions
as helpful
for engagement and motivation: “It was a really
useful benchmark each week to know that I was going to do the
things but then there was going to be some sort of follow-up on
them” (P14).

Overall, the telephone calls were found to be helpful for
applying techniques in the intervention to real-life scenarios,
feeling understood, and providing a benchmark for completing and
reviewing goals.

(b) Mixed feedback on remote delivery

There were mixed experiences regarding the remote delivery
of the intervention. Some felt it would have been better face-to-
face: “. . . there’s just something about being able to see somebody’s
face” (P14).

Others felt that remote delivery was helpful due to convenience:
“. . . it’s basically because of the hassle. . . especially if you work, to take
a day oﬀ or a half day oﬀ you know it it’s losing the point this was great
it sort of ﬁt around my life” (P1).

There were also reports that remote delivery helped participants
to speak more openly with the therapist: “There’s a certain level of
anonymity over the phone and I think that for me personally that
helped me to be more open and honest” (P19). Similarly, another
participant said that “by not being able to see the person perhaps
you’re able to open up a little bit more.” (P13).

Therefore, participants reported both positive (convenience
and a helpful sense of anonymity) and negative (a sense of reduced
connection with the therapist) consequences of remote delivery.

(c) How do you keep it up?

This subtheme refers to concerns regarding the brevity of the
intervention. For some, the intervention seemed to end abruptly:
“How do you keep it up after receiving this last session with your
psychologist? And I think it’s a question as well for the other patients,
whether we have enough strength to do it or not to forget it” (P1).

Several described how further sessions or ongoing “check in’s”

may be required for the continued application of skills:

Frontiers in Psychology

Edwards et al.

10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1233526

“Obviously it’s therapy so it can’t go on forever you have to
deal with it in a way by yourself but you know I think every now
and again have a to have like a kind of a recap or refresh your
mind and have someone to talk to is helpful” (P7).

It was felt that continued support from a therapist may be

particularly helpful following setbacks:

“I think you will need to talk to me again if I have a nice big
fall or something but I haven’t had it for a while thank God but
that can usually be very upsetting to think and then how can I
move on from that” (P1).

These quotes demonstrate participants’

concerns about
whether they will be able to maintain eﬀective practice of the skills
following completion of the intervention, given the brevity of the
intervention and lack of ongoing contact with a therapist.

Discussion

This nested qualitative study provided additional information
on the experiences,
impacts, and acceptability of the guided-
self-help ACT intervention (Lewin et al., 2009; O’Cathain et al.,
2014). The randomized controlled trial of the intervention led
to moderate-to-large improvements in our primary outcome of
QoL, and also secondary outcomes, including mood (Rose et al.,
2022). The themes derived from the present study characterize
how these improvements were experienced in everyday life of
participants. Following ACT, participants described making several
conscious changes. This included increasing their levels of activity
to involve more activities they found personally meaningful, such
as going to the gym or social events. Such activity appeared
to be facilitated by other conscious changes, such as becoming
more aware of their thoughts and feelings and ﬁnding ways to
helpfully approach these experiences. For example, participants
described a greater willingness to accept the emotions and thoughts
that come with symptom progression, which enabled eﬀective
engagement with mobility aids. They described adapting their
approaches to undertaking activities they ﬁnd enriching. This
involved prioritizing, pacing, or focusing on the process of living
life consistent with their own values as opposed to simply focusing
on reaching goals.

In addition to these conscious changes in behavior, participants
mentioned some unexpected consequences following ACT. They
described renewed ways of disentangling their identity from that of
MD and beneﬁcial impacts on key close relationships. Participants
reported that everyday life included a quality of feeling more free,
suggesting the experience of an increase in the breadth of choices
available to participants. One participant reported experiencing
improvements in muscle function and pain, alongside the sense
that improvements in muscle function occurred via increases
in physical activity. Indeed,
in a randomized controlled trial
of cognitive behavior therapy for fatigue in MD, perhaps by a
similar mechanism, those receiving CBT showed improved muscle
composition following therapy, as assessed with MRI (Janssen et al.,
2016). Nonetheless, commensurate with the goals of the ACT
intervention here, the majority did not report improvements in
physical symptoms but rather expressed greater awareness that they
could live well alongside physical symptoms.

Psychological ﬂexibility is the change process speciﬁcally
targeted by ACT (Hayes et al., 2006). There was
some
suggestion that participants changed their behavior in ways
commensurate with psychological ﬂexibility. For
example,
some participants described a general process of doing more
activities they found fulﬁlling (engagement), with acceptance
of concomitant challenging experiences (openness) and greater
awareness of their thoughts, feelings, and choices (awareness).
However, this slightly contrasts with changes in questionnaire
measures of psychological ﬂexibility observed in the randomized
controlled trial where changes were of a small magnitude (Rose
et al., 2022). This discrepancy could be due to limitations of
quantitative measures of psychological ﬂexibility, which may
have accessibility/comprehensibility issues (Castle, 2019). It is
also possible that the sub-sample of participants included in this
qualitative study were those who experienced larger changes in
psychological ﬂexibility during the intervention.

This study provides further insight into the acceptability of the
intervention and clues for enhancing uptake and engagement when
implemented into clinical practice. Acceptability appeared to be
high among our participants. People with MD live with a condition
that in many instances comes with a high symptom burden and
few available treatments. Yet, they reported being able to make
meaningful changes—usually increases to their everyday activity—
via this psychological intervention. Many of these participants
suggested that psychological interventions should be included in
their overall care, such as to help with the impact of physical
symptoms. One might contend that such ﬁndings are to be expected
given participants in the qualitative study also volunteered to be
part of a trial of a psychological intervention. However, this ﬁnding
is consistent with a previous questionnaire study of treatment and
research needs in MD, where participants with MD highlighted a
need for support for living well with the condition via psychological
and associated interventions (Nierse et al., 2013). Since completing
this study, evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis
suggests that online ACT produced signiﬁcantly greater outcomes
than waitlist controls at post-treatment for anxiety, depression,
quality of life, psychological ﬂexibility, and all assessed outcomes
(i.e., omnibus eﬀect), which were generally maintained at follow-up
(Klimczak et al., 2023).

To enable access for those with mobility issues, the intervention
was conﬁgured as remotely delivered guided self-help. Participants
described generally positive experiences of remote delivery and
therapist contact. Consistent with qualitative evaluations of
remotely guided self-help ACT treatments with other health
conditions (Köhle et al., 2017; Bendelin et al., 2020; Contreras
et al., 2022), participants stated that contact with a therapist
was necessary. They valued interactions that provided space
for considering alternative perspectives on their experiences. In
addition, although some would have preferred to receive therapy
in person, the remote delivery was seen by many as beneﬁcial. This
was for practical reasons, such as ﬁtting sessions into a busy day or
keeping on track with therapy aims and goals. A surprising beneﬁt
of this remote delivery is that some found the apparent anonymity
helpful—stating that it meant they could be more open about
their experiences. Given the increasing use of remotely delivered
interventions, there is surprisingly limited research into the role of
anonymity and variables contributing to ways it might facilitate or
hinder the therapeutic relationship.

There was mixed feedback as to the brevity of the intervention
and participants’ ability to maintain engagement. The intervention
was conducted over 5 weeks, comprising self-help booklets and
corresponding brief telephone calls with a therapist (Rose et al.,
2018). Several participants reported concern about maintaining
the progress they had made during the intervention and said they
would have liked additional calls, asking whether “check-ins” could
be integrated into their annual healthcare review. Our quantitative
outcome data from the trial demonstrate a short-term impact of
the intervention, with QoL and mood signiﬁcantly better at 9
weeks. Our planned analysis of outcomes at 6 months will help
understand whether beneﬁts are maintained in the absence of
additional “check-ins.”

Participants’ pre-intervention expectations for receiving the
ACT intervention provide clues to improve uptake. The emphasis
on mindfulness as a part of the intervention appeared to elicit
strong reactions. Several participants communicated skeptical
attitudes toward mindfulness—seeing mindfulness as a fad—
while several others felt certain from previous experience that
mindfulness would not be helpful for them personally. Mindfulness
practice, such as centring exercises, is a frequently used ACT
method,
largely as a way of promoting the present-moment-
awareness aspect of psychological ﬂexibility. However, other
methods that do not require formal mindfulness practice can
be used to promote present-moment awareness. For example,
participants can be encouraged to consciously slowdown in emotive
or important circumstances—to notice their options and patterns
of
feelings, and action—or therapists can facilitate
conversations that involve attending to ongoing experiences in
granular detail (sometimes called “tracking” methods) (Villatte
et al., 2015; Hayes, 2019).

thoughts,

engaging with experiences. Other potential beneﬁts included the
disentangling of participants’ identity from MD, a better quality of
relationship with others, and a general sense of feeling freer. There
was a mainly positive evaluation of the remotely guided self-help
conﬁguration. While a small number would have appreciated in-
person sessions, many saw practical beneﬁts to the remote nature
of the intervention and found the sense of anonymity helpful
for talking more openly. The intervention was brief, and several
reported that follow-up sessions may have been helpful. Many held
negative preconceptions about the utility of mindfulness methods.
For future implementation, it is worth considering the use of
follow-up sessions and de-emphasizing the centrality of typical
mindfulness exercises in the intervention. We cannot say whether
these perspectives translate to other treatment modalities, such
as CBT.

Data availability statement

The datasets presented in this article are not readily available
because of the potentially identiﬁable nature of the interviews.
Requests to access the datasets should be directed to Trudie Chalder

Ethics statement

The study was approved by the London-Camberwell St Giles
Research Ethics Committee, UK (16/LO/0609). The study was
conducted in accordance with the local legislation and institutional
requirements. The participants provided their written informed
consent to participate in this study.

Limitations of the study

Author contributions

As a nested qualitative study, participants volunteered to
participate in the ACTMus trial. Thus, the present group may
have been more attracted to psychological intervention than the
general population of people living with MD. Interviewing the
wider population of people living with MD on the utility of
psychological interventions could provide greater insight into ways
to improve engagement with psychological interventions in MD.
We only interviewed participants who completed ACT, which
means we cannot generalize our ﬁndings to those who did not
fully engage with the intervention. Although the response rate in
this study was high (74%), it would be interesting to explore the
experiences of those who decided to stop participating in ACT—
this would perhaps give clues for improving engagement. Given
that all discussions took place shortly after the completion of
the intervention, future qualitative research would beneﬁt from
examining the longer-term engagement with skills engendered in
the ACT intervention.

Conclusion

Individuals with MD who participated in a guided self-help
ACT intervention described making conscious changes to increase
life-enriching activity following ACT, which came along with
greater awareness of thoughts and feelings and new ways of
