More than 5 million deaths a year are attributable to tobacco
smoking, but attempts to help people either quit or reduce their
smoking often fail, perhaps in part because the intention to quit
activates brain networks related to craving. We recruited participants
interested in general stress reduction and randomly assigned them
to meditation training or a relaxation training control. Among
smokers, 2 wk of meditation training (5 h in total) produced a
signiﬁcant reduction in smoking of 60%; no reduction was found
in the relaxation control. Resting-state brain scans showed increased
activity for the meditation group in the anterior cingulate and
prefrontal cortex, brain areas related to self-control. These results
suggest that brief meditation training improves self-control capacity
and reduces smoking.

Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body, causing many

diseases and compromising smokers’ health (1). Despite the
negative consequences, many smokers have difﬁculty quitting or
even reducing tobacco use (2). In addition, many teenagers are
added to the smoking roll each year and may be at risk for abuse
of other substances (2). Because tobacco use is often thought of
as a gateway to other drug use, reducing smoking might reduce
the vulnerability of youths to cocaine and other drugs (3). Al-
though public health campaigns may have decreased the number
of smokers, current methods for aiding those who persist in
smoking have had limited success (4, 5). These failures may be
a result of the inability to relieve withdrawal symptoms, stress,
and cue-induced cravings, which often leads to drug seeking and
taking (6–10). This urgent need calls for a short-term, effective
intervention for reducing smoking behavior and cravings (2).

One reason for addiction to tobacco may involve a deﬁcit in self-
control. Self-control is important because the level of childhood
self-control predicts long-term outcomes, including mental health,
substance abuse, ﬁnancial independence, and criminal behavior
(11). Individuals at risk for substance abuse typically have deﬁcits in
self-control (12–16). Dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC),
including dorsolateral PFC, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and
medial orbitofrontal cortex, play a key role in addiction (12, 17, 18).
In cigarette smokers, regional cerebral blood ﬂow was reduced in
the left dorsal ACC, and this correlated with a decrease in craving
after smoking the ﬁrst cigarette of the day (19). These reports
raise the question of whether impaired self-control could be
ameliorated and strengthened with intervention, and thus po-
tentially change smoking behavior.

There is emerging evidence that mindfulness meditation has the
potential to ameliorate negative outcomes resulting from deﬁcits
in self-control (20–25). Although preliminary ﬁndings suggest
mindfulness training shows some proof of efﬁcacy in substance
abuse, these studies are replete with limitations, including a lack of
adequate control conditions, failure to randomize participants, and
lack of assessment of biological markers of change. Thus, more
rigorous and randomized controlled studies are warranted (26–29).
In a series of randomized controlled trials, it was found that a form
of mindfulness meditation, integrative body–mind training (IBMT;
Materials and Methods), reduces stress, increases positive emotion,
and improves attention and self-control after a few hours of practice
compared with the same amount of relaxation training (RT).

Moreover, these positive changes were accompanied by increased
brain changes of ACC and parasympathetic activity associated with
a brain state of increased self-control (20, 30–33).

Because addictions, including smoking, involve ACC and ad-
jacent PFC function related to self-control (12, 17), we hypoth-
esize that improved self-control through short-term IBMT would
reduce craving and smoking. To test this hypothesis, we advertised
for volunteers wishing to reduce stress and improve performance.
Among those who responded were 27 cigarette smokers and
33 nonsmokers. We then randomly assigned both smokers and
nonsmokers to IBMT or RT groups. Both groups received
2 wk of training for a total of 5 h (Materials and Methods).

Results
We used objective measures of smoking amount (carbon mon-
oxide level in parts per million), and ANOVAs were conducted
with group (IBMT and RT) and training session (before and
after) as factors. Before training, no differences in smoking
amount were found among smokers in the two groups (P > 0.05).
After training, the main effect of the training session was sig-
niﬁcant [F(1,24) = 16.635; P = 0.000], and the group–session
interaction was also signiﬁcant [F(1,24) = 9.099; P = 0.006].
Subsequent t tests indicated there was signiﬁcant smoking re-
duction in the IBMT group (P < 0.01) but no signiﬁcant re-
duction in the RT group (P > 0.05). Fig. 1 shows the amount of
smoking reduction after 2 wk of IBMT and RT for each smoker.
To identify brain mechanisms underlying the observed smok-
ing reductions, we used fractional amplitude of low-frequency
ﬂuctuation (fALFF), an index of intrinsic resting-state activity,
which has been widely used in studies of addiction, posttraumatic
stress disorder, attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, mild cog-
nitive impairment, and early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (34–39).
We measured whole-brain fALFF, using resting-state functional
MRI, before and after 2 wk of training. Before training, we com-
pared smokers and nonsmokers and found that smokers had re-
duced activity in ACC, left lateral PFC, and other areas during rest
(Pcorrected < 0.05), indicating impaired self-control. This is in ac-
cord with previous ﬁndings showing that smokers often had lower
PFC and ACC activity at rest than nonsmokers (12, 17). After 2 wk
of IBMT, we found signiﬁcantly increased activity at ACC/medial
PFC and inferior frontal gyrus/ventrolateral PFC (Pcorrected < 0.05),
but no signiﬁcant change was detected after the same amount of RT
(P > 0.05). In comparison with the RT group, the IBMT group
showed signiﬁcantly decreased activity at posterior cingulate cortex
(PCC)/precuneus, cerebellum, and other regions after training
(Pcorrected < 0.05); see Table 1 for activity details with Brodmann
areas, coordinates, t values, and cluster sizes in two groups before
and after training. Fig. 2 illustrates the increased ACC activity
after 2 wk of IBMT.

In the present study, self-report craving did not differ in the
two groups before training (P > 0.05). After training, the main

reports [F(1,23) = 14.710; P = 0.001], and the group–session in-
teraction was marginally signiﬁcant [F(1,23) = 3.935; P = 0.059].
Comparing before and after training, t tests showed a signiﬁcant
decrease in craving in the IBMT group (P < 0.01), but not the RT
group (P > 0.05).These results demonstrate that short-term IBMT
practice can signiﬁcantly reduce craving.

Discussion
Mindfulness meditation involves a systematic training of attention
and self-control with an attitude of acceptance and openness to
internal and external experiences (22–25). Given the core clinical
symptoms of drug addiction [intoxication (impaired self-aware-
ness), bingeing (loss of control), withdrawal, and craving] (12),
mindfulness meditation may be helpful for coping with these ad-
diction symptoms and with the accompanied negative emotion and
stress reactivity. Prior studies have shown the preliminary efﬁcacy
of mindfulness meditation in treating several forms of addiction
including alcohol, cigarettes, cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, and
opiates (26–28); however, as recent reviews have pointed out, the lack
of randomization and active control groups indicate that these
ﬁndings should be interpreted with caution (26, 27).Our current
study used a randomized controlled design with an active re-
laxation control (RT), as did our previous studies (20, 30–32), and

we found a signiﬁcant reduction in smoking and craving after 2 wk
of IBMT.

Our previous work has shown that ACC activity and the efﬁ-
ciency (as measured by fractional anisotropy, using diffusion
tensor imaging MRI) of white matter connectivity surrounding
ACC can be increased by short-term IBMT more than by RT
(30–32). In this study, before training, smokers had less activity
in the ACC and PFC than nonsmokers. After training, ACC and
PFC activity increased and smoking decreased only in the IBMT
group, not in the RT group. In one sense, training seems to have
moved the smokers to more normal activity, but the exact brain
areas reduced in smokers before training are somewhat different
from the areas in which training produced improvement. More-
over, we did not note signiﬁcant correlations between the extent
of brain changes in ACC and PFC and the amount of reduced
smoking or craving. Nonetheless, we think that increased ACC
and PFC activity with training are most likely associated with the
observed reduction in smoking.

We also found signiﬁcantly reduced activity in PCC and cer-
ebellum in the IBMT group in comparison with the RT group.
These results are in line with some previous ﬁndings. For ex-
ample, in one study, a stroke that produced a lesion of the PCC
resulted in an immediate cessation of smoking (40). More gen-
erally, studies of addicted smokers have shown increased activity
in PCC and cerebellum in comparison with those of nonsmokers
(12, 17, 19). Thus, both increased activity in ACC and PFC and
reduced activity in PCC and cerebellum may be important neural
correlates of reduced smoking (12, 17, 19).

We also tested the follow-up effects: After ending the 2 wk of
IBMT, ﬁve smokers responded to our 2 and 4 wk of follow-up,
using measures of objective carbon monoxide (CO) level and
self-reported Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND).
They all maintained reduced smoking.

Because the number was so small, we do not yet know exactly
how long the reduction will last; this warrants further investigation.
Nevertheless, our preliminary ﬁnding suggested that continued
practice may not be needed to maintain the smoking reduction
for at least few weeks.

A major problem in overcoming tobacco use is craving.
Craving is also a signiﬁcant factor that can lead to relapse during
attempts to quit smoking (8, 41) and that is associated with some
degree of resisting the urge to smoke: Trying to resist is almost
always accompanied by some degree of craving (42). IBMT does
not force participants to resist craving or quit smoking; in-
stead, it focuses on improving self-control capacity to handle
craving and smoking behavior,
indicating a unique way to
treat addiction.

Intention is often thought to be important to achieve a goal and
change behavior. However, intention to avoid a thought often
leads to thinking about the very thought one hopes to suppress

20 to 10 cigarettes per day after 5 h of IBMT during a 2-wk period.
He stated, “I was not aware of my smoking reduction while ﬁlling
out the self-report questionnaires. I usually consumed one pack
with 20 cigarettes each day before training. But after I thought
carefully and checked my pocket, actually I only needed half pack
per day recently. It started around after 1 wk [of] training natu-
rally, but I didn’t know why.” This evidence suggests that the
smoker was not aware of the dramatic reduction and that the un-
conscious change of smoking behavior and habit spontaneously
happened after short-term IBMT practice (47).

Stress is also important in substance use. Cumulative stress
decreases self-control, increases impulsivity, and increases the risk
for current cigarette smoking (49). Mindfulness training has shown
promise for stress-related maladies and substance use (50), and in
particular, IBMT has been shown to reduce stress only after few
hours of training (20, 51). It is possible that one mechanism by
which IBMT reduces craving and smoking is through stress re-
duction (22, 52).

Our results to date suggest it may be possible to reduce smoking
and craving, even in those who have no intention to quit smoking.
This low-cost and short-term intervention may inﬂuence a com-
mon anatomical pathway to substance abuse and reduce possible
risk for drug use in youth.

Materials and Methods
Participants. Healthy college students were recruited through campus adver-
tisements for learning meditation/relaxation to reduce stress and improve
cognitive performance. Participants with the goal of quitting smoking were not
included. Among those who responded, we found there were 27 cigarette
smokers and 33 nonsmokers (mean ages, 21.46 ± 3.08 y). We randomly
assigned both smokers and nonsmokers to either the IBMT group or the RT
group. There were 15 smokers (11 men) in the IBMT group and 12 smokers
(8 men) in the RT group, and 18 nonsmokers in the IBMT group and 15 non-
smokers in the RT group. The smokers used tobacco without other drugs, with
an average of 10 cigarettes per day. Three heavier smokers were placed in the
IBMT group by chance, but the IBMT and RT groups showed no signiﬁcant
difference in smoking before training. One smoker in the RT group did not
ﬁnish the whole study and was excluded, and one smoker in the IBMT group
did not have usable craving data and was excluded from the craving analysis.
All participants had no prior experience in meditation or RT. The experiment
was approved by the local institutional review board at Texas Tech University,
and informed consent was obtained from each participant.

Self-Report Measurement. Among those who responded, we screened and
selected smokers and nonsmokers using the FTND, a 6-item validated scale.
Participants also rated the severity of their cravings to smoke using a 5-point

(43, 44). Moreover, attempts to suppress thoughts about using
substances may actually lead to increases in substance use (45).
Unlike most interventions to reduce smoking, in this study we did
not recruit participants who had an expressed intention of quitting
smoking. To test whether intention related to the reduction of
smoking, we measured intention using self-report questionnaires
(Materials and Methods) and found that intention did not make
a signiﬁcant difference in smoking reduction (P > 0.05). Fur-
thermore, our results indicate that the participants who reported
an intention to quit did not outperform those without an intention,
suggesting that changing smoking behavior through IBMT in-
tervention may relate to unconscious processing (46–48).

Consistent with the objective CO results, the self-report FTND
result also showed a signiﬁcant smoking reduction for the IBMT
group (P < 0.05), but not the RT group. However, the self-report
of smoking reduction before compared with after training did not
match well with the objective measurement of CO level (Fig. 3). A
clue to this mismatch may be provided by the account of one
participant in our sample who reduced smoking signiﬁcantly from

Likert scale and FTND (53). These self-report measures were taken before and
after 2 wk of training. We measured intention using a 10-point Likert scale
(sample items included “mark the number that shows how you feel about
quitting”; “in the past year, how many times have you made a serious at-
tempt to quit smoking?”; and “are you seriously thinking about quitting
smoking in the next 30 days?”; score: from 0 = no thought of quitting to
10 = ready to quit now). These self-report measures have been commonly
used in the smoking ﬁeld (8, 41, 54).

Objective Measurement. To validate the self-report smoking behavior and
craving, we used a CO monitor (Micro+ Smokerlyzer, Bedfont Instruments) to
measure the exhaled CO level as an objective indicator of smoker’s addiction
to nicotine. This noninvasive measure has been widely used in smoking re-
search (55, 56) and provides CO level in parts per million and percentage
carboxyhemoglobin (%COHb) in smokers’ lungs and blood. We used the
objective CO level in parts per million, shown on the monitor screen as
a converted index of the actual number of cigarettes smoked.

Training/Intervention. IBMT is a form of mindfulness meditation that involves
body relaxation, mental imagery, and mindfulness training accompanied by
selected music background. Cooperation between the body and the mind is
emphasized in facilitating and achieving a meditative state. The trainees
concentrated on achieving a balanced state of body and mind guided by an
IBMT coach and a compact disc. The method stresses no effort to control
thoughts but, instead, a state of restful alertness that allows a high degree of
awareness of body, mind, and environment (20, 30–33).

RT involves the relaxing of different muscle groups over the face, head,
shoulders, arms, legs, chest, back, abdomen, and so on, guided by a RT coach
and compact disc. With eyes closed and in a sequential pattern, one is forced
to concentrate on the sensation of relaxation, such as the feelings of warmth
and heaviness. This progressive training helps the participant achieve physical
and mental relaxation and calmness (20, 31). We trained all participants
(smokers and nonsmokers) together but divided them into small groups (33).
The participants received 30-min of IBMT or RT group practice every night
for 10 consecutive sessions, for a total of 5 h of training (32).

Imaging Data Acquisition and Analysis. All data were collected using a 3-Telsa
Siemens Skyra scanner at the Texas Tech Neuroimaging Institute. 3D T1-

weighted anatomical images were acquired using the MPRAGE sequence
(TR = 1,780 ms; TE = 2.36 ms; slice thickness = 1.0 mm). A 6-min resting-state
functional scan (T2* weighted images) was obtained for each participant
before and after 2 wk of training with gradient echo planar sequence
(Repetition time = 2,000 ms; Echo time = 27 ms; ﬂip angle = 80°; ﬁeld of
view = 256 mm × 256 mm; matrix size = 64 × 64; slice thickness = 4 mm; Axial
direction, 36 slices). Participants looked at a crosshair shown on a screen and
did not think of anything in particular; head movement was minimized,
using individually custom-made foam padding (57).

Functional data were processed using the Data Processing Assistant for
Resting-State fMRI (www.restfmri.net), which is based on Statistical Para-
metric Mapping (www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and Resting-State fMRI Data
Analysis Toolkit (58). For each participant, the subsequent standard proce-
dures included slice timing, motion correction, and spatial normalization of
images into the Montreal Neurological Institute template with a resampling
voxel size of 3 × 3 × 3 mm. Finally, a Gaussian ﬁlter of 5 mm full-width at
half-maximum was applied to the dataset for spatial smoothing.

An improved approach of the ALFF method, fractional ALFF (fALFF) (34),
was used for detecting regional signals change of spontaneous activity by
taking the ratio of power spectrum of low-frequency (0.01–0.08 Hz) to that
of the entire frequency range. Similar to the procedures of previous litera-
ture (34–39), the time series of each voxel was transformed to a frequency
domain after the linear trend was removed without band-pass ﬁltering. The
square root was then calculated at each frequency of the power spectrum,
and ﬁnally the sum of amplitude across 0.01–0.08 Hz was divided by that
across the entire frequency range (0–0.25 Hz) to obtain fALFF. The fALFF
maps of nonsmokers and smokers before training were compared using two
sample t tests, and the fALFF maps of smokers in the IBMT and the RT groups
after training also were compared using two sample t tests. The fALFF maps
of smokers in IBMT and RT groups before and after the training were
compared using paired t test. All results were corrected for multiple com-
parisons (Pcorrected < 0.05), based on Monte Carlo stimulation (34).
