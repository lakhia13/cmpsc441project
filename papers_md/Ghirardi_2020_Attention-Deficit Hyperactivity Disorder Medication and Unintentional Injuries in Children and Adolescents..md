Abstract

Objective: Our objective was to determine whether ADHD medication is associated with a 
decreased risk of unintentional injuries in children and adolescents in the United States across 
sexes, age groups and injury types.

Methods: We used de-identified inpatient, outpatient, and filled prescription claims data from the 
Truven Health MarketScan® Research Databases. Individuals were followed from January 1, 
2005, date of first ADHD diagnosis or medication prescription, or age 6, whichever occurred last, 
until December 31, 2014, first healthcare insurance disenrollment, or the first year at which their 
age was recorded as 19, whichever occurred first. A person was considered on ADHD medication 
during a given month if a prescription was filled in that month. The outcome was defined as 
emergency department visits for injuries, including traumatic brain injuries, with unintentional 
causes. Odds of having the outcome were compared between medicated and un-medicated months 
at the population-level and in within-individual analyses using logistic regression.

Results: Among 1 968 146 individuals diagnosed with ADHD or receiving ADHD medication, 
87 154 had at least one event. At the population-level, medication use was associated a lower risk 
of injuries, both in boys (OR= 0.85; 95% CI: 0.84–0.86) and girls (OR=0.87; 95% CI: 0.85–0.89). 
Similar results were obtained from within-individual analysis among male (OR= 0.72; 95% CI: 
0.70–0.74) and female (OR= 0.72; 95% CI: 0.69–0.75) children, and among male (OR= 0.64; 95% 
CI: 0.60–0.67) and female (OR= 0.65; 95% CI: 0.60–0.71) adolescents. Similar results were found 
for traumatic brain injuries.

Conclusion: ADHD medication use was associated with a reduction of different types of 
unintentional injuries in children and adolescents of both sexes.

LAY SUMMARY

We used de-identified insurance claims data from the Truven Health MarketScan® Commercial 
Claims and Encounters databases to study whether use of ADHD medication is associated with a 
decreased risk of unintentional injuries in children and adolescents in the United States. Use of 
ADHD medication was associated with a decreased risk of any unintentional injury in boys (Odds 
Ratio= 0.71, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.70–0.73) and girls (Odds Ratio=0.71, 95% Confidence 
Interval: 0.68–0.73). Similar associations were found for traumatic brain injuries and both in 
children and adolescents. The results suggest that ADHD medication use may have beneficial 
effects not only on core symptoms of ADHD, but also on other aspects of general health, such as 
prevention of physical injuries.

INTRODUCTION

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder that 
affects about 3–5% of children worldwide.1,2 ADHD is associated with several negative 
outcomes related to health and wellbeing,3 including physical injuries.4–6 Unintentional 
injuries, such as falls and road injuries, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
among children in the United States.7 Meta-analytical results suggest that ADHD is 
associated with a 40–50% increase in the risk of injuries in children and adolescents.5,6 
Pharmacological treatment for ADHD has been reported to be effective for core 
symptoms8,9 and cognitive deficits10 associated with ADHD. Hence it may be hypothesized 
that, by reducing distractibility, impulsivity and over-activity, ADHD medication may 
prevent unintentional injuries.

Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) represent the gold standard approach to 
evaluate intervention efficacy, observational studies based on large and representative 
administrative databases, combined with designs and analytical techniques aimed at 
reducing confounding, may also contribute to the knowledge base around medication safety 
and effectiveness.11 This is particularly true for studying rare-but-serious outcomes. One 
approach that is becoming increasingly used in observational studies evaluating concurrent 
effects of medication use is the within-individual design, which removes time-invariant 
confounding by comparing the risk of an outcome within the same individual under different 
treatment conditions.12 A few recent observational studies have used within-individual 
designs to investigate if treatment with medications approved for the management of ADHD 
symptoms may influence the risk of injuries in children and adolescents.4,13–16 Two recent 
meta-analyses of observational studies found support for a protective effect.5,17 When 
focusing on studies that used within-individual comparisons, the pooled effect sizes pointed

towards a reduction in the rate of injuries by 12–14% during medicated periods compared 
with un-medicated periods.5,17 However, not all the studies have consistently reported a 
significant risk reduction.15 One point that remains unclear is whether the association 
between ADHD medication and injuries may depend on age. One study reported very 
similar estimates across age groups,13 while other studies reported different associations in 
different age groups.14,16 Understanding the consequences of ADHD across childhood and 
adolescence has important implications for clinical practice, as many patients stop using 
their medication during adolescence.18 Another important factor is the type of the injury. For 
example, one study found an association between medication use and traumatic brain 
injuries (TBI) but did not find a significant association with any type of injury, although the 
point estimates indicated a risk reduction.13 This may suggest that different types of injuries 
may not be associated with medication in the same way, an aspect that deserves further 
investigation, because of the public health relevance and implications for clinical practice 
when weighting the risks and benefits of ADHD medication. In addition, it is not clear 
whether the results from previous studies in European and Asian countries, where ADHD 
medication prevalence estimates are around 2%,19 will generalize to other settings, such as 
the United States, where the prevalence of diagnosed ADHD and ADHD medication use are 
higher.19,20

In this study, we estimated the concurrent association between ADHD medication use and 
unintentional injuries (that is, excluding intentional self-harm) in a sample of commercially-
insured children and adolescents in the United States. In addition, capitalizing on the 
availability of data from a large health-care database, we explored if the association was 
consistent across sex and age and for TBI, given that the available evidence on these aspects 
is still inconclusive.

METHODS

Study sample

We used data from the Truven Health MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Encounters 
databases of de-identified inpatient, outpatient, and filled prescription claims.21 As 
confirmed with the University of Chicago institutional review board, the analysis of 
MarketScan Databases is exempt because records are de-identified, and informed consent is 
not required.

We identified all individuals with an ADHD diagnosis (codes 314 in the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition [ICD-9]) or an ADHD medication prescription 
between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2014. The first inpatient or outpatient diagnosis 
or filled prescription was defined as the index date. Individuals included in the study were 
followed from the index date or age 6, whichever occurred later, until their first 
disenrollment, December 31, 2014 or the first year at which their age was recorded as 19, 
whichever occurred first. Disenrollment was defined as zero days of medical or drug 
insurance coverage in a given month. A non-ADHD control group (no ADHD diagnosis or 
medication, as defined above), matched 1:1 on sex, calendar year, age at first enrollment, 
and length of enrollment, was also selected from MarketScan Databases enrollees. More 
details are available elsewhere.22,23

Outcome

We identified data ADHD medication using national drug codes for the following generic 
names: amphetamine salt combination, atomoxetine hydrochloride, dexmethylphenidate 
hydrochloride, dextroamphetamine sulfate, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, methamphetamine 
hydrochloride, methylphenidate, and methylphenidate hydrochloride, consistent with other 
studies.22–23 We required prescription claims to have valid fill dates and day supply (180 
days or less). A person was considered to be receiving medication during a given month if a 
prescription was filled in that month or if there was a carryover from a prior month.

To identify unintentional injuries we defined the outcome events as Emergency Department 
(ED) visits for injuries (ICD-9 codes: 800–929; 950) with an unintentional cause (ICD-9 
codes: E001-E869; E880-E928). In addition, we identified TBI as ED visits for unintentional 
causes (ICD-9 codes: 800, 801, 803, 804; 850–854; 950.1–950.3; 959.01). We focused on 
ED visits rather than any hospital visit in order to identify acute events.

We allowed unintentional injuries to occur multiple times during the follow-up. To avoid 
reverse causation, if a new prescription was filled in a month when an event occurred, the 
medication was considered used only if the prescription was filled before the date of the 
event. In a small number of instances (n = 2441; less than 0.01% of the included months) 
patients began new prescriptions and experienced the event in the same month. In these 
cases, we considered patients as unmedicated if the event occurred before or on the same 
date as the first prescription fill.

Statistical Analysis

ADHD and the risk of injuries—To examine the association between ADHD and 
unintentional injuries, we compared the odds of having at least one event between ADHD 
patients and matched controls. Odds Ratios (ORs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) were 
estimated using conditional logistic regression. The same model was used to analyze the 
association between ADHD and unintentional TBI.

ADHD medication use and the risk of injuries—To explore the concurrent 
association between ADHD medication use and ED visits for unintentional injuries, we 
created a monthly person-time data set and performed two sets of analyses using logistic 
regression. First, we compared the odds of having an event between medicated and un-
medicated months at the population-level , adjusting for time-varying covariates (age, 
calendar year, and time since the last accidental injury event), with robust standard errors 
accounting for the correlation among months within individual. We converted the ORs into 
Risk Ratios (RRs) and calculated the adjusted rate difference as I0 × (RRa−1), where I0 is the 
unadjusted event rate in the unexposed periods and RRa is the adjusted RR.24

Second, we compared the odds of having the event between medicated and un-medicated 
months at the individual level (within-individual analysis). That is, each individual served as 
his or her own control. ORs were estimated using conditional logistic regression. This model 
controlled for all unmeasured confounding factors that were constant within the individual

during the follow-up (for example, genetic make-up and early environmental exposures).25 
In addition, we adjusted for time since the last accidental injury event. These two sets of 
analyses were also applied to estimate the association between ADHD medication use and 
unintentional TBI. Assuming that the estimate from within-individual analysis could be 
generalized to the full sample, we estimated the rate difference between medicated and un-
medicated months.

We obtained separate estimates for boys and girls. Furthermore, we examined the 
associations between ADHD medication use and unintentional injuries in two separate age 
groups: individuals aged 6–15 years and individuals aged 16–19 years, consistent with a 
previous study.14

Sensitivity Analysis

To examine the robustness of the within-individual associations between ADHD medication 
use and ED visits for both unintentional injuries and unintentional TBI, we performed 
sensitivity analyses using different definitions of the cohort, exposure, and outcome. The 
first analysis examined the association in a cohort with incident diagnoses of ADHD (i.e., 
patients who were newly diagnosed with ADHD and had no prescription of ADHD 
medication for at least one year), in order to evaluate the association among patients who 
were new to ADHD treatment. The second analysis censored individuals after the first event 
in the incident diagnosis cohort (i.e., the one used for the first sensitivity analysis) to exclude 
possible bias due to reverse causation (i.e., the prescription of ADHD medication was 
influenced by an unintentional injury). The third analysis excluded the last month before 
disenrollment because the coverage for the last month might be incomplete. The fourth and 
fifth analyses examined the association among people with index dates 2005–2008 and 
2009–2014 respectively, as average severity of treated patients might have changed over 
time. The sixth analysis extended the medicated periods by one month so that the definition 
of un-medicated months following treatment discontinuation was more conservative. In the 
seventh analysis we excluded prescriptions with less than 10 day of supply (about 1% of 
total prescriptions) so that we excluded short medication periods. The eighth analysis 
examined the associations with only stimulant medications as the exposure (i.e., excluding 
atomoxetine) to explore whether the association depended on the type of ADHD medication 
(i.e., stimulant vs non-stimulant). The ninth and tenth analyses excluded patients who 
received other psychotropic medication and psychotherapy, respectively, in order to test 
whether the observed associations were explained by other concomitant treatments. The 
eleventh analysis used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as the main exposure 
to evaluate if the observed association was specific to ADHD medication or similar pattern 
could be observed with other psychotropic medications. In this analysis the exposure to 
SSRIs was defined and modelled in the same way as ADHD medication in the main 
analysis.

All analyses were performed using statistical software (SAS, version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc).

RESULTS

Page 6

We identified 1 968 146 individuals with a diagnosis of ADHD or a prescription for ADHD 
medication during the follow-up time. The main characteristics of the study cohort are 
presented in Table 1. Over 60% of the sample were boys and the median age at the start of 
the follow-up was 11 for boys and 12 for girls. The proportion of individuals with at least 
one event was slightly higher in boys (4.8%) than in girls (3.6%).

ADHD and the risk of injuries

ADHD was associated with an increased risk of having an unintentional injury in boys 
(OR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.17–1.20) and in girls (OR=1.36, 95% CI: 1.34–1.38) (Table2). Similar 
results were obtained for TBI, both in boys (OR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.18–1.24) and in girls 
(OR=1.49, 95% CI: 1.42–1.56) (Table2).

ADHD medication use and the risk of injuries

In the population-level analysis, ADHD medication use was associated a lower risk of 
having an ED visit for unintentional injuries (OR= 0.85, 95% CI: 0.84–0.86 for boys; OR= 
0.87, 95% CI: 0.85–0.89 for girls) (Table 3). This corresponded to 37.90 (95% CI: 35.37–
40.43) fewer events per 100 000 person-months in boys and 25.15 (95% CI: 21.28–29.02) 
fewer events per 100 000 person-months in girls. Similar results were obtained for TBI 
(OR= 0.85, 95% CI: 0.81–0.89 for boys; OR= 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84–0.98 for girls) (Table 3). 
This corresponded to 4.24 (95% CI: 3.11–5.38) fewer events per 100 000 person-months in 
boys and 1.87 (95% CI: 0.42–3.33) fewer events per 100 000 person-months in girls.

In the within-individual analysis, ADHD medication use was associated with a lower risk of 
having an ED visit for unintentional injuries, with equal effect sizes in boys (OR= 0.71, 95% 
CI: 0.70–0.73) and girls (OR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.68–0.73) (Table 3). This corresponded to 
73.29 (95% CI: 68.24–75.82) fewer events per 100 000 person-months in boys and 56.11 
(95% CI: 52.24–61.92) fewer events per 100 000 person-months in girls. Similar 
associations were estimated for TBI, both in boys (OR= 0.63, 95% CI: 0.59–0.67) and in 
girls (OR= 0.67, 95% CI: 0.60–0.75) (Table 3). This corresponded to 10.47 (95% CI: 9.34–
11.60) fewer events per 100 000 person-months in boys and 6.87 (95% CI: 5.21–8.33) fewer 
events per 100 000 person-months in girls.

Age-stratified estimates showed that ADHD medication use was associated with a lower risk 
of having an ED visit for unintentional injuries in children and adolescents, both in boys 
(OR= 0.72, 95% CI: 0.70–0.74 for children; OR= 0.64, 95%CI: 0.60–0.67 for adolescents) 
and in girls (OR= 0.72, 95% CI: 0.69–0.75 for children; OR= 0.65, 95%CI: 0.60–0.71 for 
adolescents) (Table 4). Similar associations were observed for TBI (Table 4).

Sensitivity analyses

Similar results were observed in all the sensitivity analyses, indicating that the main results 
are robust across different definitions of the cohort, the exposure, and the outcome (Table 5). 
For example, similar estimates were found when the within-individual analysis was 
restricted to patients with no other psychotropic medication (OR= 0.67; 95% CI: 0.65–0.69

0.66–0.70 for boys; OR= 0.68; 95% CI: 0.65–0.72 for girls) (Table 5). In contrast, we did 
not observe a decreased risk of ED visits due to unintentional injuries with concurrent use of 
SSRIs (OR= 1.17; 95% CI: 1.12–1.23 for boys; OR= 1.09; 95% CI: 1.02–1.16 for girls), 
suggesting the protective association with ADHD medication was not due to the use of any 
psychotropic medication (Table 5).

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigated the concurrent association between 
ADHD medication use and risk of ED visits for unintentional injuries in children and 
adolescents in the United States. The large sample size allowed us to obtain separate 
estimates across sexes, age groups and different types if injuries. Furthermore, we were able 
to specifically focus on unintentional injuries (i.e., excluding intentional self-harm). We 
found that use of ADHD medication was associated with a reduction of the risk of having an 
ED visit for unintentional injury, both at the population and at the individual level. The 
negative associations were present in boys and girls, children and adolescents, as well as for 
TBIs. The estimates were also robust to different definitions of the study sample, of the 
follow-up, of the exposure and of the outcome.

This study extends previous findings from studies conducted in Europe4,13,16 and Hong 
Kong15 by showing that the injury risk reduction associated with concurrent ADHD 
medication use is consistent across sexes, age groups, injury type, and continents. 
Furthermore, while these studies did not differentiate between intentional and unintentional 
injury, we focused on unintentional injuries only, which represent a leading cause of 
disability and mortality in children and adolescents in the United States7 and in Europe.26

Considering the burden of injuries in children and adolescents, this study has clear public 
health relevance. In particular, TBI has been associated with adverse outcomes in the 
educational and vocational domains,27–29 and increased risk of hospitalization and 
premature mortality.29 From a clinical perspective, the increasing evidence that ADHD 
medication seems to be associated with a reduction of severe outcomes, including injuries, 
but also criminality,30 substance use disorder23 and transport accidents,22,31 may be an 
additional factor to consider when weighing benefits against risks of ADHD medications.

The study has some strengths and limitations that should be considered when interpreting 
the results. First, the use of data from a large sample of commercially-insured patients in the 
United States limits the generalization to other patient groups and to other countries. On the 
other hand, the large sample size also allowed us to explore the association between ADHD 
medication and injuries across age groups that may have different risk of injuries32 and 
medication use pattern.19,20,33 Second, only unintentional injuries that led to an ED visit 
were included in the study; less severe events, including unintentional injuries that did not 
require medical attention or that were treated in outpatient settings, were not captured by this 
study. Conversely, it is important to study severe events, including TBI, because of the 
public health impact.27–29,34 Third, as a major methodological strength, the information on 
medication prescriptions was independent of the information on the outcome and free from

recall bias. However, these data did not include information on prescriptions that were not 
filled (non-adherence) or that were not claimed to the insurance provider. Fourth, because of 
the observational nature of the data, we were not able to account for all the possible 
confounders that select individuals into treatment. Some unmeasured factors that correlate 
with medication use (that is, time-varying confounders, which may lead to medication 
initiation or cessation) may also decrease or increase the risk of unintentional injuries. One 
factor that may correlate with ADHD medication use and with risk of injuries is 
psychotherapy or the use of other psychotropic medications. When we restricted the analysis 
to individuals with no psychotherapy or other psychotropic medication, we found similar 
protective estimates, suggesting that these interventions are not likely to explain the 
observed association. However, it is difficult to establish if the use of the within-individual 
design, measured time-varying covariates, and different sensitivity analyses ruled out all 
alternative explanations for the associations between ADHD medication and injuries. To 
further address the role of unmeasured confounding, we used concurrent use of SSRIs as the 
main exposure. The analysis found a positive association (i.e., SSRIs use was associated 
with a small increased risk of injuries). Of most importance to our study, the results for 
SSRIs showed a different pattern of results, which provides additional support for the 
specificity of the results for ADHD medication. Fifth, we were not able to check the 
indication of the medications and exclude individuals who may take ADHD medications for 
problems other than ADHD. However, in the first sensitivity analysis, where we examined 
the association in a cohort with recorded diagnoses of ADHD, we found similar results to 
those obtained in the full sample. Last, future research should investigate how the relative 
medication effect, assuming a causal effect of medication, translates into meaningfully 
reduction of rate of injuries and other health-adverse events compared to individuals without 
ADHD. Such information may help clinicians to plan for additional support via alternative 
(e.g., behavioral) interventions in the case that medication only cannot decrease the rate of 
health-adverse events to what expected in the general population.

In conclusion, use of ADHD medication is associated with a reduction of unintentional 
injuries in children and adolescents in the United States. This seems to be true in boys and 
girls of different age and for injury events of different severity. These results highlight how 
the use of ADHD medication may be associated with beneficial effects that go beyond 
reducing core symptoms of ADHD and extend to the prevention of health-adverse events, 
such as physical injuries, including TBI.
