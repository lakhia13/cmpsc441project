Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic and the many associated socio-economic changes consti-
tute a stressful event that required adaptation to new, dynamic, and often threaten-
ing conditions. According to the literature, coping strategies are one of the factors 
that determine a person’s degree of adaptation to stressful situations. A systematic 
review and meta-analysis was performed on the relationship between religious cop-
ing and selected indicators of mental health. Due to the large amount of data, this 
work has been divided into two parts: this first part discusses positive mental health 
indicators, while the second discusses negative mental health indicators (Pankowski 
&  Wytrychiewicz-Pankowska,  2023).  A  systematic  review  of  PubMed,  Science 
Direct, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews 
of Effects, and Google Scholar databases was carried out. In addition to the synthe-
sis  of  information  obtained  from  the  research,  a  meta-analysis  of  correlation  was 
also performed to determine the strengths of the relationships between the analysed 
variables, and selected moderators were assessed using meta-regression. Quality of 
life, well-being, satisfaction with life, happiness, and post-traumatic growth were the 
positive mental health indicators considered. Meta-analyses indicated a statistically 
significant  relationship  between  positive  religious  coping  and  flourishing  (well-
being) with overall correlation values of 0.35 [0.30; 0.40]. Further calculations also 
indicated  a  relationship  between  negative  religious  coping  and  flourishing − 0.25 
[− 0.34; − 0.15].  Data  synthesis  shows  associations  between  religious  coping  and 
such indicators as satisfaction with life and post-traumatic growth, but these issues 
require further investigation.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic was an event that had a massive effect on the world around 
us.  It  affected  practically  all  spheres  of  life:  physical  health  (Daher  et  al.,  2020), 
the economy (Ashraf, 2020), education (Marinoni et al., 2020), work (Kramer et al., 
2020),  mobility  (Abu-Rayash  et  al.,  2020),  and  mental  health  (MH;  Bourmistrova 
et al., 2022; Samji et al., 2022). Isolation from loved ones (both voluntary for fear of 
their health and due to quarantine), rising prices and/or scarcity of consumer goods, 
paralysis of health care systems, economic uncertainty, including layoffs and bank-
ruptcy, remote work/education without physical contact with other people, and many 
other factors contributed to reduced quality of life and greater levels of depressive 
symptoms and anxiety (Brenner et al., 2020; Rumas et al., 2021). The reality created 
by the pandemic made it necessary for many people to reorganize their day-to-day 
lives  (Cancello  et  al.,  2020).  It  should  be  noted  that  the  COVID-19  situation  was 
a new one for the vast majority of people—recent pandemics did not reach such a 
scale and did not last as long. In addition to its indirect impact (changes and limita-
tions resulting from the pandemic), COVID-19 also directly influenced the function-
ing of people who became infected. In addition to long COVID (Crook et al., 2021), 
serious health problems (e.g. ECMO treatment or other systemic complications, see: 
Gribensk et al., 2022; Shanbehzadeh et al., 2021) could lead to the emergence and 
worsening of mental health difficulties.

There  is  no  doubt  that  the  pandemic  was  a  major  stressor  that,  to  some  extent, 
affected the vast majority of people in the world. According to the assumptions of 
the  theoretical  models  used  in  research  on  stress,  strategies  for  coping  with  stress 
are one of the factors that regulates the consequences of a given stressful situation. 
Lazarus and Folkman (1984) described coping as different types of deliberate efforts 
(cognitive,  emotional,  and  behavioural)  aimed  at  resolving  a  given  stressful  situa-
tion through either addressing the problem itself or the resultant emotions (including 
avoidance). In a situation that is assessed as stressful (cognitive appraisal process), 
actions are taken to restore the previous balance. An individual may use a variety of 
coping strategies depending on, among other things, their availability or subjective 
assessment  of  their  effectiveness  in  a  given  situation  or  based  on  previous  experi-
ence (Lazarus et al., 1984). One strategy used in stressful situations is religious cop-
ing (RC), which involves the use of various types of religious practices. Religious 
coping can, for example, help one to reinterpret a stressor (e.g. “it is God’s will”), 
or provide emotional support, both from God and from religious communities. RC 
can  be  divided  into  positive  religious  coping  (pRC)  and  negative  religious  coping 
(nRC). The former refers primarily to a sense of connectedness with a transcendent 
force and a secure relationship with a caring God, while the latter refers to feeling 
abandoned or punished by God as well as interpersonal religious discontent (Parga-
ment et al., 2011).

The coping process ends when a given situation no longer causes stress (which 
does  not  necessarily  mean  that  the  stressor  has  been  eliminated),  which  is  largely 
dependent on subjective appraisal; a given stressor may also be successfully ignored, 
so that it no longer functions as a source of stress (Lazarus et al., 1984). The effects

of the coping process can be operationalized in many ways, but most often the effec-
tiveness  of  a  given  strategy  is  determined  by  its  impact  on  MH.  Commonly  used 
indicators  include,  for  example,  quality  of  life,  level  of  anxiety,  or  the  severity  of 
depressive symptoms (De Ridder et al., 2008). The issue of the negative impact of 
the  pandemic  on  mental  health  has  been  the  subject  of  much  analysis  during  the 
pandemic. Numerous studies have indicated, inter alia, high prevalences of depres-
sion, anxiety (Salari et al., 2020), PTSD (Cénat et al., 2021), sleep problems (Jah-
rami et al., 2021), and other mental health issues. However, in addition to negative 
mental health indicators, many studies have also focused on positive aspects, such as 
life satisfaction and flourishing. An important issue here is the fact that a high inten-
sity of negative MH indicators (such as anxiety or depression) does not necessarily 
mean a low level of positive indicators, such as life satisfaction or happiness (see: 
Seligman,  2008);  therefore,  these  two  issues  should  be  analysed  separately,  taking 
into  account  the  broadest  possible  repertoire  of  variables  that  may  be  affected  by 
stressful situations. These studies sought to identify the factors responsible for high 
levels of negative indicators, as well as protective factors that could buffer the nega-
tive effects of the pandemic.

Therefore, we decided to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the rela-
tionship between religious coping and mental health indicators, in particular, focus-
ing on both negative determinants of mental health, such as stress, depression, and 
anxiety, as well as positive determinants, such as post-traumatic growth, well-being 
(WB), and quality of life (QoL). Due to, inter alia, the fact that studies were con-
ducted all over the world, the observed relationships between RC and MH indicators 
differed between studies. Therefore, we attempted to identify factors that may play 
significant roles in determining the strength of these relationships by performing a 
meta-regression of relevant studies.

Methods

Search Strategy

This review was pre-registered at OSF (Open Science Framework) below the link: 
osf.io/54ygr  (https:// doi. org/ 10. 17605/ OSF. IO/ GMNFV)  and  after  the  registra-
tion  DP  and  KWP  independently  conducted  systematic  literature  searches  using 
the PRISMA protocol (Moher et al., 2009). The reviewers searched PubMed, Sci-
ence Direct, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and the Database of Abstracts 
of Reviews of Effects using the keywords: "religious coping OR religion coping OR 
spiritual coping AND COVID". In the review, it was decided to also include articles 
from  the  "grey  zone"  (Google  Scholar)  only  when  both  authors,  having  carefully 
read the text, had no doubts about the methodological soundness and quality of the 
article (see Appendix 1). Each article was independently assessed by both authors.

The search was limited to the English language, but no limitation was placed on 
the ethnicity of the human participants. The reference lists of relevant articles were 
also reviewed for other relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Based  on  the  presence  of  the  searched-for  or  synonymous  terms,  394  articles 
were selected for further analysis. The process for selecting articles is shown in 
Fig. 1. Ultimately, the following criteria were adopted for the systematic review: 
(1) the study must refer to RC; (2) the study must describe a relationship between 
RC and mental health; (3) the methods used in the study must have a described 
reliability; (4) it is clearly stated in the title or abstract that the research relates to 
the pandemic (or resultant difficulties, such as lockdown or distance learning). In 
our work, we focused on the mental health indicators operationalized as (a) pres-
ence/intensity of psychopathological symptoms such as PTSD, anxiety or depres-
sive symptoms; (b) the level of functioning of a given person in various areas of 
life—defined as quality of life, and (c) positive indicators of adaptation, such as 
well-being, satisfaction with life or post-traumatic growth. Pre-prints, conference 
reports, and dissertations were not included in the review. We assumed that due 
to methodological issues, in the case of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, 
the tools used to evaluate RC should have proven reliability. The review included 
only articles in which the instructions in the tool related to coping with stress—
studies on, for example, the level of religiosity or the frequency of religious prac-
tices were excluded.

Furthermore,  for  the  meta-analyses  and  meta-regressions,  additional  criteria 
were  adopted:  the  analysis  must  have  examined  at  least  3  studies  that  used  the 
same method of assessing RC and MH and the articles must give the value of the 
correlation coefficient.

Two researchers (DP and KWP) independently reviewed 394 texts, identifying 
those that should be included in the analyses based on these criteria. In cases of

disagreement,  consensus  was  reached  after  discussion  between  the  2  reviewers. 
The reference lists were reviewed to identify other studies related to the topic.

Data Extraction

DP and KWP independently extracted the data for each study. The variables of inter-
est  for  the  systematic  review  were:  year  of  publication,  country  of  origin,  sample 
size, basic sociodemographic data (sex, age, population), methods of assessing RC 
and MH, and the main findings of the study.

For the meta-analysis, the strengths of the relationships between the two variables 
were extracted. Only the correlation coefficients were taken into account—when the 
relationships were reported using the beta value, the results were not included in the 
meta-analysis.

As  potential  moderators,  we  extracted:  the  percentage  of  women  in  the  sam-
ple,  the  mean  age  in  the  study  group,  the  proportion  of  people  professing  a  given 
religion, the percentage of people declaring themselves to be believers, the groups 
examined  (e.g.  the  general  population  or  medics),  the  percentage  of  people  who 
were  infected  with  COVID-19  at  the  time  of  the  study,  the  percentage  of  people 
who had been infected with COVID-19, the percentage of people in quarantine, the 
percentage of people who reported somatic symptoms (e.g. fever), the percentage of 
people with higher education, the percentage of people in a stable relationship (mar-
ried), the percentage of people living in rural areas, the percentage of people living 
alone, and the percentage of people with chronic diseases. Due to differences in the 
introduction and nature of restrictions in different countries (e.g. local lockdowns), 
we decided to not examine as potential moderators the time when the research was 
conducted and the nature of the restrictions in each country.

The  method  for  recording  the  data  was  agreed  upon  before  coding  the  results. 
Inter-rater  reliability  was  satisfactory;  in  cases  of  disagreement,  consensus  was 
reached after a discussion between the two reviewers.

Quality Assessment

To  evaluate  the  quality  of  the  selected  studies,  we  used  an  adapted  version  of  the 
Newcastle–Ottawa  cohort  scale  for  cross-sectional  studies  (Modesti  et  al.,  2016), 
which takes into consideration the selection of samples, comparability of subgroups, 
and exposure. Using this scale, we scored each study independently. Inter-rater com-
patibility was satisfactory, and scoring differences were reconciled through discus-
sion (Appendix 1).

Statistical Analysis

Meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted in the R Studio platform (R Stu-
dio,  Boston,  MA,  USA)  using  the  R  software  environment;  the  “metacor”  library 
was  used  to  calculate  correlations  (Schwarzer,  2007).  The  meta-analysis  used  the 
inverse  variance  method  with  restricted  maximum-likelihood  estimator  for   tau2, 

1 3Journal of Religion and Health (2023) 62:510–543 

515

Q-Profile method for confidence interval of  tau2 and tau. Fisher’s Z transformation 
of correlations was used. Overall rates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated 
using  a  random  effect  model.  Funnel  plots  were  used  to  determine  the  possibility 
of publication bias (Appendixes 2). The heterogeneity of effects across studies was 
estimated using the Q test and quantified using the I2
 statistic. Meta-analyses were 
performed with random effects models. Any p values less than 0.05 were considered 
significant.

Results

Results of the Systematic Review

The search using the methodology described above yielded 59 studies that fulfilled 
all selection criteria for the systematic review. Altogether, 68,824 participants partic-
ipated in these studies. The mean age of the participants ranged from 20.8 (Masha’al 
et al., 2022) to 76.3 (Willey et al., 2022) years. For details on the number of surveys 
and the number of respondents from each country, see Figs. 2 and 3, respectively, 
and Appendix 3.

For the sake of the readability of the results, we decided to analyse each aspect of 
mental health separately. It should be noted that a large part of the research focused 
on several MH indicators, so the numbers of studies and participants do not add up 
to the numbers given previously in the text. In the following subsections, selected 
indicators of MH are analysed in detail.

Due to the large amount of collected data, we decided to divide the article into 
two  parts.  In  the  first,  positive  MH  indicators  were  analysed:  quality  of  life,  well-
being, satisfaction with life (SWL), levels of happiness, and post-traumatic growth 
(PTG).

The  second  part  of  the  review  focuses  on  negative  MH  indicators:  severity  of 
depressive  symptoms,  anxiety,  stress  levels,  symptoms  of  peri-  and  post-traumatic 
stress, and general negative MH indicators.

Quality of Life

The systematic literature review identified 5 studies in which 3363 participants took 
part. The research was conducted from April 2020 to March 2021. A large variety of 
tools were used to assess RC, making it impossible to carry out a meta-analysis of 
the collected results. QoL was examined in over half of the studies using the WHO 
Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF). The exact results are shown in Table 1.

Well‑being

The  systematic  literature  review  identified  10  studies  addressing  the  relationship 
between  RC  and  WB,  with  a  total  of  17,469  participants.  The  research  was  con-
ducted from February 2020 to December 2021. The Brief-COPE was used to evalu-
ate  RC  in  half  of  the  studies  (n = 5),  while  WB  was  assessed  using  various  tools, 
including  the  PERMA  Profiler  (n = 4)  and  Flourishing  Scale  (n = 3).  Most  stud-
ies (except two) showed a relationship between RC and WB. The exact results are 
shown in Table 2.

Meta‑analysis

Journal of Religion and Health (2023) 62:510–543

The analysis of the studies included in the review only allowed for a meta-analysis 
of the relationship between flourishing and RC assessed with the Brief-RCOPE.

The  meta-analysis  of  the  relationship  between  level  of  flourishing  and  nRC 
(Brief-RCOPE)  was  conducted  on  3  studies  identified  by  the  literature  search 
as  meeting  the  inclusion  criteria.  Their  results  were  pooled  to  give  a  correlation 
of − 0.25  [− 0.34; − 0.15]  suggesting  a  statistically  significant  negative  relationship 
between these variables (Z = − 4.91; p < 0.001). (Fig. 4). Statistically significant het-
erogeneity was observed between studies (Q = 9.62; p < 0.05). The estimated amount 
of total heterogeneity was  Tau2 = 0.006 and I2

 = 79%.

Due  to  the  heterogeneity  of  the  results,  potential  moderators  were  also  ana-
lysed  in  more  detail:  the  percentage  of  women,  relationship  status  (percentage  of 
married  people),  and  level  of  education  (percentage  of  people  with  higher  educa-
tion).  Unfortunately,  due  to  deficiencies  in  the  reported  data,  it  was  not  possible 
to  include  more  moderators.  The  tests  for  moderators  showed  that  the  percentage 
of  women  (QM  (1) = 3.58;  p = 0.058)  and  the  percentage  of  married  people  (QM 
(1) = 3.21;  p = 0.073)  were  at  the  statistical  trend  level.  However,  after  taking  into 
account the above moderators, residual heterogeneity decreased to an insignificant 
level: Q = 1.62 for percentage of women and Q = 1.73 for relationship status. In turn, 
higher  education  (QM  (1) = 0.01;  non-significant)  was  a  statistically  insignificant 
moderator.

The  next  step  was  a  meta-analysis  of  the  relationship  between  pRC  and  levels 
of  flourishing.  The  meta-analysis  conducted  for  the  relationship  between  flourish-
ing  and  pRC  (Brief-RCOPE)  also  included  3  studies.  Studies  identified  in  the  lit-
erature  search  as  meeting  the  inclusion  criteria  were  pooled  to  give  an  overall 
correlation of 0.35 [0.30; 0.40] suggesting a statistically significant positive relation-
ship  (Z = − 3.18;  p < 0.01).  (Fig.  5).  Statistically  significant  heterogeneity  was  not 
observed between studies (Q = 3.27; p > 0.05). The estimated amount of total hetero-
geneity was  Tau2 = 0.0007 and I2 = 38.8%.

Satisfaction with Life and Happiness

In  the  next  step,  the  relationships  of  RC  with  SWL  and  happiness  were  analysed. 
The literature review identified 2 studies related to the relationship between RC and

SWL and 1 related to the relationship between RC and happiness. The total number 
of  participants  in  these  3  studies  was  1789,  and  the  research  was  conducted  from 
April  2020  to  March  2021.  The  Brief-RCOPE  was  used  to  evaluate  RC  in  2  of  3 
studies,  while  happiness  and  SWL  were  analysed  with  different  methods,  which 
unfortunately made it impossible to carry out a meta-analysis of the collected data. 
All  studies  found  relationships  between  RC  and  SWL  and  happiness.  The  exact 
results are shown in Table 3.

Post‑traumatic Growth

The relationship between PTG and RC was analysed in 5 studies, in which 22,165 
participants took part. The research was conducted from April 2020 to May 2021. 
The  Brief-COPE  was  used  to  evaluate  RC  in  all  studies,  while  PTG  was  assessed 
using the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory and Post-Traumatic Growth Index. Each 
of the studies showed a positive relationship between RC and PTG. The exact results 
are shown in Table 4. Unfortunately, due to the lack of data on the correlation coef-
ficients, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis.

Discussion

The first part of this systemic review focused on research on the correlation between 
religious coping (RC) and positive mental health (MH) indicators. The analysis of 
the literature allowed us to identify the following studies that met the inclusion cri-
teria: 5 studies on the relationship between RC and quality of life (QoL), 10 studies 
on the relationship between RC and well-being (WB), 2 studies related to the rela-
tionship between RC and satisfaction with life, 1 related to the relationship between 
RC and happiness, and 5 studies on the relationship between RC and post-traumatic 
growth (PTG). It was only possible to conduct a meta-analysis on the relationship 
between  negative  religious  coping  (nRC)  and  flourishing,  which  found  a  value  of 
r = − 0.25 [− 0.34; − 0.15]; however, the results were heterogeneous. The percentage 
of  women  in  the  studies  and  the  percentage  of  married  people  used  in  the  analy-
sis as moderators were on the verge of statistical tendency. On the other hand, for

the relationship between positive religious coping (pRC) and flourishing, the results 
were homogeneous and indicated a relationship of r = 0.35 [0.30; 0.40].

The  synthesis  of  data  from  studies  covering  the  relationship  between  RC  and 
QoL  indicated  that  the  vast  majority  of  studies  conducted  in  this  area  were  cross-
sectional. Only the study by Schamblaw et al. (2021) had a follow-up after 1 month. 
Data from cross-sectional studies were collected from different populations (includ-
ing students, people with chronic illnesses, and GPs) in different countries and with 
the use of different questionnaires; in most cases, these were tools assessing pRC/
nRC,  and  two  used  the  Brief-COPE.  It  should  be  noted  that  in  most  of  the  cross-
sectional studies, a relationship was observed between QoL and RC, while the data 
from the longitudinal study did not find a relationship between RC and QoL. Data 
from a longitudinal study by Danhauer et al. (2009) on women with breast cancer 
indicate that coping strategies predict QoL to a limited extent, while QoL may pre-
dict coping strategies equally or to a greater extent. In turn, the studies by Pargament 
et al. (2004) and Trevino et al. (2010) indicate a weak association between QoL and 
pRC/nRC. It should be noted that the coping process is dynamic, and both the strate-
gies used and the extent to which they are used may change over time depending on 
the effects achieved. This is important not only for the analysis of possible relation-
ships or the impact of a given strategy, but also due to the content of the items used 
in  the  questionnaires  to  assess  pRC/nRC.  The  content  of  items  in  these  question-
naires  may  measure  the  effects  of  coping  with  a  given  stressor  to  a  greater  extent 
than the strategy used; for example "Felt punished by God for my lack of devotion" 
or "Wondered what I did for God to punish me" (Brief-RCOPE) indicate a failure 
to  cope  with  a  given  stressor—that  is,  they  seem  to  reflect  the  transaction  effect 
(Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) to a greater extent than the methods used to reduce the 
level  of  stress  or  regulate  emotions.  At  the  same  time,  it  should  be  noted  that  the 
analysis  did  indicate  such  a  relationship,  but  the  data  from  the  longitudinal  study 
may indicate that the choice of this strategy was more dependent on QoL; however, 
this requires further additional investigation due to limited data.

Studies  assessing  the  relationship  between  RC  and  WB  were  also  conducted 
around  the  world  in  different  populations  throughout  the  entire  period  of  the  pan-
demic. Most of these studies were cross-sectional, except for one longitudinal study 
(Davis  et  al.,  2021).  The  cross-sectional  studies  mostly  indicated  the  presence  of 
this relationship, while longitudinal studies indicated no such relationship. As in the 
case of QoL, we should wonder to what extent the degree of RC use may be deter-
mined  by  the  current  state  of  the  participant.  The  collected  data  also  allowed  for 
a  meta-analysis  of  the  results  of  3  studies  on  the  relationship  between  flourishing 
and  p/nRC.  However,  these  results  should  be  approached  with  caution  due  to  the 
limited data included in the analysis. In the case of nRC, statistically significant het-
erogeneity was observed, which could not be explained with the use of moderators: 
the percentage of women and married people reached the level of statistical trend, 
while the level of education was statistically insignificant. It should be noted that a 
very limited number of variables were used as moderators due to uncontrolled data 
or deficiencies in reporting data describing the studied group, which could be fur-
ther analysed as a potential source of variability in the research results. However, all 
three  studies  showed  a  negative  relationship.  A  meta-analysis  of  studies  assessing 

1 3Journal of Religion and Health (2023) 62:510–543 

527

the relationship between pRC and flourishing showed a weak positive relationship, 
with the results being homogeneous. In conclusion, the collected data indicate the 
existence  of  a  relationship  between  WB  and  RC,  and  the  nature  of  this  relation-
ship requires more analysis—longitudinal data do not indicate that RC determines 
changes  in  WB.  Meta-analyses  confirm  a  positive  relationship  between  pRC  and 
flourishing irrespective of sociodemographic factors, and the strength of the corre-
lation  between  nRC  and  flourishing  seems  to  depend  on  factors  that  could  not  be 
determined due to gaps in the reported data.

Next, satisfaction with life (SWL) and happiness were analysed. Cross-sectional 
studies covering this topic were conducted in various countries, most of them (n = 2) 
on the student population. The synthesis of the results allows us to draw conclusions 
about the relationship between these constructs: both neutral RC and pRC were pos-
itively  associated  with  SWL,  while  nRC  was  negatively  associated  with  levels  of 
happiness  and  SWL.  It  should  be  noted  that  different  assessment  tools  were  used 
to assess both SWL and RC. The lack of longitudinal studies prevents conclusions 
being drawn about the direction of this relationship and its possible impact.

The last of the positive MH indicators included in this review was post-traumatic 
growth  (PTG).  The  review  of  the  studies  allowed  us  to  identify  5  cross-sectional 
studies  conducted  in  different  countries  on  very  diverse  populations.  All  studies 
assessed RC using the Brief-COPE, but meta-analysis could not be performed due 
to deficiencies in the reported correlation coefficients. All studies clearly indicated 
a  positive  relationship  between  PTG  and  RC.  Unfortunately,  it  was  not  possible 
to  identify  longitudinal  studies  that  would  allow  the  assessment  of  the  impact  or 
direction of this relationship. Earlier longitudinal studies performed in clinical trials 
indicated no relationship (Scrignaro et al., 2011) or a negative relationship between 
RC and PTG (Rzeszutek et al., 2017). Studies conducted on a population of natural 
disaster  survivors  indicate  the  beneficial  effects  of  pRC  (Arkin,  2022;  Chan  et  al., 
2013). It would be valuable to further explore this relationship: whether it depends 
on an objective/subjective assessment of a given event, the nature of its causes, or 
whether such differences may result from the methodology used. It should be noted 
that in the case of the first two examples, the Brief-COPE was used, in which the RC 
items are formulated in a neutral way, and in the case of hurricane victims, RC was 
assessed in terms of p/nRC.

To sum up, the coping process usually involves a whole range of different types of 
strategies based on, inter alia, what resources are available (e.g. social support), how 
they can be used, as well as the expected effectiveness of their use. For almost all peo-
ple, the pandemic was a novel situation where previous strategies did not necessarily 
have the expected results, which could have been an additional source of stress. The 
vast majority of studies included in the review suggested either no or very weak rela-
tionships  between  positive  MH  indicators  and  RC.  The  exception  seems  to  be  PTG, 
for which cross-sectional studies showed a beneficial effect. Single longitudinal stud-
ies indicated no influence of RC on the analysed dependent variables (QoL, WB), but 
these results should certainly be replicated. It is also worth noting that most analyses 
were based on the variable-centred approach, focusing on the percentage of variation in 
dependent variables that was explained by coping strategies; but it is worth remember-
ing that they occur in particular combinations. It would also be worth considering the 

1 3528

analysis of subgroups that differ in their degree of use of specific strategies with the use 
of methods allowing for the identification of such profiles (k-means clustering; LPA, 
LCA).

Study Limitations

The cross-sectional nature of most of the analysed studies prevents inferences about the 
direction of the relationship between the variables included in the review. The use of 
this strategy results primarily from the highly burdensome nature of the stressor, which 
may be largely related to the observation of artificial positive correlations between RC 
and  worse  mental  health  indicators  in  cross-sectional  studies.  These  types  of  results 
may also lead to overlooking the positive aspects that RC may have on mental health in 
the long term.

The most important limitation of this review is the small number of studies (n = 3) 
included in the calculations; the results of the meta-analyses should therefore be inter-
preted with caution. Another serious limitation is the heterogeneity obtained in one of 
the  meta-analyses,  which  could  not  be  explained  based  on  the  available  moderators. 
Another factor influencing the quality of the obtained results is directly related to this: 
unfortunately, in many cases, the basic data describing the sample were not reported, so 
these variables could not be used as moderators in meta-regression. Correlation matri-
ces between the analysed variables were not reported in many studies, which limited 
the  possibilities  for  further  data  analysis.  Authors  should  keep  in  mind  that  sample 
description and data reporting should allow for both replication and further analyses: 
the results obtained in a given study may depend on many factors related to, for exam-
ple, the selection of the sample or the time and place they were carried out; only a fur-
ther collective analysis of the results of many studies will allow us to draw more precise 
conclusions.

Conclusions

The  collected  data  suggest  that  there  is  a  relationship  between  RC  and  positive  MH 
indicators. Data from longitudinal studies in turn suggest that RC is not associated with 
levels of positive MH indicators. Meta-analyses indicate that the relationship between 
pRC and flourishing is less sensitive to differences in sample structure, and the asso-
ciation between nRC and flourishing may be partially dependent on some sociodemo-
graphic indicators; however, this requires further analysis. Due to the shortcomings in 
reporting both analyses and data on the sample structure, the results should be inter-
preted with caution.
