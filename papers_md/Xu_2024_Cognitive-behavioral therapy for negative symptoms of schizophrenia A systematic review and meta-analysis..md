Abstract 
Background: Cognitive-behavioral intervention techniques are increasingly demonstrating their efficacy in preventing relapses 
and managing problems in patients with schizophrenia. There is still variation in its effectiveness for negative symptoms, such as 
mood-related symptoms and motivation to engage socially.

Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science for English literature on cognitive-behavioral therapy 
(CBT) interventions in patients with schizophrenia. The search included randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized controlled 
trials. The search period extended from the inception of the databases to September 30, 2022. Two researchers independently 
performed quality assessment and data extraction based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Results:  Discrepancies  were  resolved  through  discussion  or  consultation  with  a  third  researcher.  Initially,  169  articles  were 
retrieved  through  database  searches  and  other  means.  After  applying  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  10  randomized 
controlled studies were included in the final analysis. The intervention group comprised a total of 680 patients with schizophrenia, 
while the control group included 686 patients with schizophrenia. Meta-analysis results demonstrated a statistically significant 
difference in negative symptom reduction between the CBT intervention group (WMD = −1.19, 95% CI [−1.73, −0.66], P < .0001) 
and the control group.

Conclusion: We have analyzed the effectiveness of CBT based on our previous research, CBT was found to effectively improve 
negative symptoms in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia.

1. Introduction

Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that has a profound 
impact on the patient’s physical and psychological well-being, 
causing lifelong disability.[1] Clinically, positive symptoms such 
as  hallucinations  and  delusions,  negative  symptoms  includ-
ing  emotional  retardation  and  social  withdrawal,  and  cogni-
tive  dysfunction  are  commonly  observed  and  considered  the 
core  symptoms  of  schizophrenia.[2,3]  These  long-term  psychi-
atric  symptoms  ultimately  result  in  reduced  social  function-
ing  for  the  patient,  affecting  both  their  recovery  and  overall 
quality  of  life.[4,5] While  antipsychotic  medications  have  been 
proven effective in alleviating positive symptoms and reducing 
the  risk  of  relapse.[6,7]  They  do  not  effectively  address  nega-
tive  symptoms  or  cognitive  impairment,  and  may  even  lead 

to  deterioration  in  cognitive  function.[8,9]  Therefore,  it  is  of 
utmost  importance  to  address  the  negative  symptoms  and 
cognitive function of patients given their significant impact on 
their lives.[10]

As a result, psychosocial treatment has evolved from its pes-
simistic  beginnings  (which  believed  that  personality  disorgani-
zation  was  an  unavoidable  consequence  of  psychotic  cognitive 
deficits,  thus  preventing  the  use  of  psychotherapy)  to  a  wide 
range  of  interventions  aimed  at  rehabilitating  patients.  Today, 
psychosocial  strategies  are  recognized  as  an  important  compo-
nent of schizophrenia treatment, particularly when medications 
have  limited  effectiveness  in  improving  negative  symptoms.[11] 
Although  these  symptoms  are  less  noticeable  than  the  posi-
tive  symptoms,  they  are  the  most  reliable  long-term  indicator

of  disease-related  disability  and  impact  the  patient’s  ability  to 
function  in  daily  life.[12–14]  In  recent  years,  cognitive-behavioral 
therapy (CBT) has emerged as a psychotherapeutic approach in 
the clinical treatment of schizophrenic patients and has been rec-
ommended as a standard treatment for schizophrenic patients in 
Western  countries.[15,16]  Cognitive-behavioral  intervention  tech-
niques are increasingly demonstrating their efficacy in preventing 
relapses[17] and managing problems in patients with schizophre-
nia[18];  They  promote  recovery  and  community  integration  by 
targeting key aspects of functioning such as symptom stability, 
independent living, employment, and social functioning. Studies 
have shown that CBT is generally effective in improving positive 
symptoms  of  schizophrenia,  such  as  hallucinations  and  delu-
sions,[19,20] However, there is still variation in its effectiveness for 
negative symptoms, such as mood-related symptoms and moti-
vation  to  engage  socially.[21,22]  Conducting  a  meta-analysis  can 
help researchers find reliable evidence from a multitude of stud-
ies. This study aimed to summarize and analyze previous stud-
ies  through  meta-analysis  to  determine  the  efficacy  of  CBT  on 
negative  symptoms  of  schizophrenia. This  will  provide  a  more 
reliable basis for the clinical application of CBT.

2. Materials and methods

This  meta-analysis  followed  the  Preferred  Reporting  Items 
for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta-Analyses.  This  review 
has  been  registered  in  PROSPERO  (Registration  Number: 
CRD42023421071). This study is a review article and the ethi-
cal statement is not applicable.

2.1. Data sources and retrieval

An  inclusive  literature  was  searched  in  PubMed  and  web  of 
science  databases,  respectively,  from  the  date  of  establishment 
to September 30, 2022. The search terms were (schizophrenia) 
and (CBT) and (randomized controlled study). Foreign language 
database search terms: (psychosis OR psychotic OR schizophre-
nia) AND (cognitive therapy OR cognitive behavior therapy OR 
CBT) AND (Randomized Controlled Trial) and Manual search 
for published literature.

Effect  sizes  (Cohen  d)  of  each  study  and  overall  were  cal-
culated  under  a  random-effect  model  with  95%  confidence 
intervals.

2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria of the literature

2.2.1.  Inclusion  criteria.  The  type  of  study  in  the  literature 
was an independent randomized controlled study; patients with 
schizophrenia according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria; and able 
to  directly  extract  or  calculate  the  sample  content,  mean  and 
standard  deviation  of  positive  and  negative  syndrome  scale 
(PANSS) scale scores.

2.2.2.  Exclusion  criteria.  Studies  in  which  patients  with 
schizophrenia  had  other  types  of  disorders  such  as  brain 
injury  or  more  severe  cognitive  impairment;  studies  related 
to  schizophrenia  symptoms  such  as  reviews,  case  reports, 
conference  abstracts,  and  research  plans;  studies  in  which 
the  study  population,  study  type,  interventions,  and  outcome 
indicators did not meet the inclusion criteria; studies in which 
the full text was not available, valid data could not be extracted, 
or  the  original  data  could  not  be  requested;  and  studies  with 
duplicate reports; quality assessment and data extraction.

cross-checked  after  completion.  The  screening  included  title, 
abstract,  study  subjects,  study  instruments,  study  parameters, 
and full-text screening. Two evaluators independently assessed 
the included literature according to the risk of bias assessment 
tool  provided  in  the  Cochrane  Handbook  version  5.1.0.  The 
main criteria included: random sequence generation; allocation 
concealment; blinding of investigators and subjects; blinding of 
outcome evaluators; data integrity; selective reporting bias; and 
other  biases.  If  all  of  these  criteria  are  met,  the  risk  of  bias  is 
minimal and the assessment level is A. If these criteria are par-
tially met, the risk of bias is moderate and the assessment level 
is B. If these criteria are not met at all, the risk of bias is highest 
and the assessment level is C.

2.4. Statistical analysis

Meta-analysis  was  performed  using  Review  Manager  5.3 
software.  Heterogeneity  among  the  included  literature  was 
tested by Q test and I2 test, and if P ≥ .1 and I2 ≤ 50%, a fixed- 
effect model was used for meta-analysis, and when P < .1 and/
or  I2 > 50%,  a  random-effect  model  was  selected  for  meta- 
analysis, and subgroup analysis was performed to explore the 
sources of heterogeneity. The impact of publication bias on the 
results was evaluated using funnel plots for qualitative evalu-
ation and quantitative analysis of reporting bias, respectively, 
and  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  using  the  subtraction 
method.

Effect  indicators  for  measures  were  expressed  as  mean  dif-
ference (MD) or weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% 
CI;  if  the  same  measurement  tool  was  used  to  evaluate  the 
same  outcome,  the  combined  effect  statistic  was  expressed  as 
weighted mean difference WMD; if different measurement tools 
were used, the combined effect statistic was expressed as If dif-
ferent instruments were used, the combined effect statistic was 
expressed as standardized mean difference.

3. Results

3.1. Results of the literature search

A total of 169 articles were retrieved from the database as well 
as  other  means,  and  were  further  screened  according  to  the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 10 randomized controlled 
studies were finally included, including a total of 680 patients 
with schizophrenia in the intervention group, and a total of 686 
patients with schizophrenia in the control group, and the pro-
cess of the screening of the literature and the results are shown 
in Figure 1

3.2. Basic characteristics and quality assessment of the 
included literature

A total of 10 English-language papers were included, and all 
studies  used  the  PANSS  scale  to  assess  negative  symptoms 
in  patients  with  schizophrenia.  Five  studies  were  short  term 
interventions  (T < 16  weeks)  and  5  studies  were  long-term 
interventions (T > 16weeks). CBT was used in the intervention 
group in all studies, and TAU, ST, SC, and CR were used in the 
control group. The literature was evaluated for quality using 
the scale Cochrane Handbook version 5.1.0. The included lit-
erature  ended  up  with  3 A  grades  and  7  B  grades. The  basic 
characteristics  and  quality  assessment  of  the  included  litera-
ture (Table 1).

the  heterogeneity  among  these  papers  was  weak  (I2 = 33%). 
So  fixed  effect  model  was  chosen  for  meta-analysis.  Negative 
symptoms in CBT intervention group (WMD = −1.19, 95% CI: 
[−1.73, −0.66], P < .0001) showed that there was an decrease in 
the negative symptoms in the intervention group as compared 
to the control group and it was statistically significant (Fig. 2).

(Fig. 5).

3.3.2.  Publication  bias.  The  funnel  plot  of  the  10  included 
papers  found  that  9  papers  were  essentially  symmetrical  and 
only 1 was biased, allowing further sensitivity analysis (Fig. 3).

3.3.3.  Sensitivity  analysis.  The  sensitivity  analysis  revealed 
that this study of Preethi Premkumar[23] was different from other 
studies in that there was no mention of whether the experiment 
was  double-blind  or  not  in  the  literature.  The  meta-analysis 
was done after excluding this study and the resulting combined 
effect size (WMD = −1.08, 95% CI: [−1.63, −0.54], Z = 3.89, P 
= .0001) showed that CBT therapy combined with conventional 
therapy  was  more  effective  than  conventional  therapy  alone, 
and the difference was statistically significant. Its heterogeneity

4. Discussion

CBT  has  been  shown  to  be  significantly  effective  in  treating 
the  positive  symptoms  of  schizophrenia,  but  its  impact  on 
improving  negative  symptoms  varies. This  study  conducted  a 
meta-analysis of 10 papers and found that CBT therapy is more 
effective than single conventional treatment in improving nega-
tive symptoms of schizophrenia. Furthermore, it was observed 
that  shorter  interventions  (<16  weeks)  were  also  effective  in 
improving  negative  symptoms  compared  to  longer  interven-
tions (>16 weeks).

Negative symptoms are characterized by deficits or reductions 
in mood, as well as social and behavioral impairments. They are 
considered  1  of  the  core  symptoms  of  schizophrenia  and  are

among the most important predictors of its quality of life and 
functional outcomes.[24,25] Additionally, negative symptoms can 
be  transient  or  a  result  of  antipsychotic  medication.[26,27]  The 
treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia presents sig-
nificant  challenges  to  mental  health  care  providers. Therefore, 
researchers must consider medication side effects in their studies 
and strive to balance the number of treatments so that the inter-
vention outweighs the medication side effects as much as pos-
sible. It is possible that CBT accelerates symptom recovery by 
promoting  cognitive  changes,  as  supported  by  recent  research 
findings.  However,  there  is  still  a  lack  of  research  on  negative 
symptoms in clinical settings, and the effectiveness of CBT can 
only be fully understood through large-sample randomized con-
trolled trials.[28] If the negative symptoms of psychiatric patients 
remain  unresolved  for  a  prolonged  period,  they  may  develop 
into  other  psychiatric  disorders  such  as  depression,[29]  causing 
significant impairment to their lives and social functioning.

The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed heterogene-
ity (I2 = 33%). Subsequent analysis revealed that the study by 
Premkumar[23]  did  not  mention  whether  it  was  double-blind 
or  not  in  terms  of  the  experimental  methodology. This  sug-
gests that the rigor of the experimental design could influence 
the  effect  of  the  intervention. Additionally,  this  study  had  a 
smaller sample size compared to others, which may contrib-
ute  to  the  heterogeneity.  After  removing  this  literature,  the 
remaining 9 studies were still heterogeneous (I2 = 10%). From 
the analysis of the included studies, it can be concluded that 
the low quality of the study design and the inconsistency of the  
diagnostic  criteria  could  be  important  factors  affecting  the 
results.  Therefore,  future  studies  and  clinical  treatments 

should  prioritize  rigorous  experimental  design,  the  profes-
sionalism of doctors, and the selection of intervention meth-
ods. The mechanism of action of CBT is still unclear, making 
it  necessary  to  determine  personalized  intervention  methods 
based on the patients’ individual situations. Inappropriate use 
of the therapy may result  in  ineffective  or  adverse effects.[30] 
From  the  current  study,  contemporary  CBT-based  interven-
tions  usually  focus  more  on  overall  treatment  goals.  For 
example,  interventions  have  been  studied  for  both  positive 
and  negative  symptoms  together,  rather  than  being  targeted 
to address patient-specific issues.[31] The duration of interven-
tion greatly influences its effectiveness, so the frequency and 
duration of the intervention should be carefully regulated to 
achieve better results.

Different  etiological  mechanisms  may  require  tailored  and 
individualized treatments, thus necessitating further assessment. 
Cognitive-behavioral interventions aimed at addressing negative 
symptoms and changing irrational beliefs that strongly impact 
symptoms are crucial. These negative beliefs may include feel-
ings of social isolation, low self-esteem, and pessimistic expec-
tations for happiness and success. Additionally, negative beliefs 
triggered  by  positive  symptoms  should  also  be  considered.[32] 
For  instance,  a  patient  experiencing  negative  symptoms  pre-
dominantly rooted in dysfunctional beliefs regarding their work 
ability (in the absence of severe objective cognitive impairment) 
could benefit from CBT emphasizing exposure and behavioral 
activation. Behavioral activation has demonstrated effectiveness 
in reducing depression and may also alleviate adverse symptoms 
in  individuals  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia  who  share  these 
dysfunctional beliefs.[33] However, it is important to consider the

patient’s acceptance of these techniques to avoid any potential 
adverse effects. In cases where a patient may not find the above 
methods acceptable, alternative interventions must be explored.
Studies have shown that CBT is effective in improving psychi-
atric symptoms by targeting patients’ cognition, disease progno-
sis, and overall treatment. The therapeutic effect of CBT was still 
evident even after 3 months posttreatment.[32] However, due to 
its mechanism of action and potential subjectivity in its imple-
mentation,  there  are  various  challenges  in  controlling  clinical 
research.  In  this  particular  study,  the  literature  search  focused 
solely on the PANSS scale as a measurement tool, overlooking 
the frequent use of the scale for assessment of negative symptoms 
scale in clinical research. Hence, future studies should be more 
precise and consider different measurement tools and diagnostic 
criteria. This study has several limitations: firstly, there was sig-
nificant variation in study design and target population among 
the different meta-analyses included, despite attempts to exam-
ine  studies  specifically  involving  patients  with  negative  symp-
toms alone. However, the advantage of meta-analysis lies in its 
ability to combine and analyze diverse studies to obtain more 

generalized  results.  Secondly,  most  studies  did  not  specifically 
aim to reduce negative symptoms and therefore did not select 
patients based on the severity of these symptoms. Moreover, the 
majority  of  studies  focused  on  overall  symptom  scores  rather 
than specific subdimensions, which could be improved in future 
research to explore the sensitivity of CBT therapy towards nega-
tive symptoms. Thirdly, the choice of measurement tools used in 
this study also influenced the results, with concerns raised about 
the outdated item content and sensitivity to change of both the 
PANSS and scale for assessment of negative symptoms. Hence, 
more sensitive measures should be identified to assess symptoms 
in individuals with schizophrenia. Lastly, it was not possible to 
isolate the effects of antipsychotic medications in the CBT trial.
In summary, CBT does have better efficacy on negative symp-
toms  of  schizophrenia  patients,  and  the  improvement  of  neg-
ative  symptoms  is  extremely  important  for  patients,  and  the 
improvement of negative symptoms can enhance the social func-
tion of patients, which is of great significance for the prognosis 
of  patients’  rehabilitation  and  slowing  down  the  development 
of the disease.
