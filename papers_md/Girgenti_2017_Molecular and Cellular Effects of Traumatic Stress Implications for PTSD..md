Abstract

Purpose of Review—Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by hyperarousal 
and recurrent stressful memories after an emotionally traumatic event. Extensive research has been 
conducted to identify the neurobiological determinants that underlie the pathophysiology of 
PTSD. In this review, we examine evidence regarding the molecular and cellular pathophysiology 
of PTSD focusing on two primary brain regions: the vmPFC and the amygdala.

Recent Findings—This discussion includes a review of the molecular alterations related to 
PTSD, focusing mainly on changes to glucocorticoid receptor signaling. We also examine 
postmortem gene expression studies that have been conducted to date and the molecular changes 
that have been observed in peripheral blood studies of PTSD patients. Causal, mechanistic 
evidence is difficult to obtain in human studies, so we also review preclinical models of PTSD.

Summary—Integration of peripheral blood and postmortem studies with preclinical models of 
PTSD has begun to reveal the molecular changes occurring in patients with PTSD. These findings 
indicate that the pathophysiology of PTSD includes disruption of glucocorticoid signaling and 
inflammatory systems and occurs at the level of altered gene expression. We will assess the impact 
of these findings on the future of PTSD molecular research.

stress response is conserved across all organisms [4], and the molecular consequences of 
stress, if pathologically induced, can lead to long-term disability in the form of chronic 
disorders, including anxiety, major depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
Stressful conditions or physical forms of abuse early in life can adversely affect resilience to 
stressful or traumatic events later in life [5]. Similarly, witnessing or experiencing a 
traumatic event can lead to long-term consequences to the mental health of an individual. It 
is likely that changes in the cellular and molecular response to traumatic stress cause long-
term effects responsible for the onset of disease.

PTSD occurs in a subset of individuals who have experienced a traumatic stressful event in 
life. The risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic event ranges from 5 to 31% with the 
commonly accepted rate being 15% [6–8]. However, in military populations deployed to 
combat areas, the risk is at the higher end of the range (30%). The reasons why some people 
develop PTSD while others exposed to comparable trauma do not is not well understood, but 
likely involves changes in the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern stress 
resiliency and susceptibility. These changes could be caused by a preexisting traumatic 
episode, the severity of the experienced trauma, or genetic heterogeneity in the population 
[5, 8, 9]. PTSD poses a considerable public health concern because of the debilitating nature 
of the symptoms and because of the high rates of comorbidity with other psychiatric 
disorders such as major depression and bipolar disorder [10]. People with PTSD also 
experience chronic inflammation [11••], metabolic disorder [12], increased incidence of 
coronary artery disease [13, 14], and increased rates of early mortality [8, 15].

Recent studies that will be discussed report the possibility of several different molecular and 
cellular signaling pathways in the susceptibility and onset of PTSD. It is also possible that a 
combination of different molecular abnormalities contribute to the long-term effects of early 
childhood stress or later life traumatic stress on the development of PTSD. Identifying 
potential gene transcription networks and disease modules involved in the pathophysiology 
of PTSD will lead to a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of this 
debilitating disorder as well as new and more efficacious treatment strategies. This article 
will discuss the molecular mechanisms that have been identified in blood and postmortem 
brain tissue and examine the relevant neurobiological changes in animal models of PTSD 
and chronic stress.

Neurobiology of PTSD

In recent years, considerable attention has been focused on studies to elucidate the 
neurobiology of PTSD with the hope of developing more effective treatments. There is 
growing evidence that traumatic experiences change neuronal morphology, function and 
neurochemistry [16], and the ability of the brain to adapt and respond to future stressors 
[17]. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the major stress responsive endocrine 
system, also undergoes significant alterations in response to trauma [5, 18, 19]. The HPA 
axis plays a major role in maintaining homeostasis in the body, including the brain where it 
modulates levels of certain neurotransmitters and hormones, as well as cellular signaling 
systems [20]. During fearful situations, the pituitary signals for cortisol to be released by the 
adrenal glands via release of the pituitary peptide adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH).

Cortisol circulates in the body to exert significant metabolic effects and plays a key role in 
the reconsolidation and retrieval of fearful memories [7]. The actions of cortisol on cell 
function are mediated by glucocorticoid receptors (GR) that translocate to the nucleus and 
regulate gene transcription.

Multiple studies have demonstrated elevated levels of another component of the HPA axis, 
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a hypothalamic peptide that signals to the pituitary 
to release ACTH. These studies report increased CRH in the cerebrospinal fluid of PTSD 
patients that is directly associated with disease severity, suicide, and psychosis [21, 22]. 
CRH is expressed in other brain regions and plays a role in stress and fearful responses; 
activation of CRH signaling or forebrain CRH overexpression in rodents increases startle 
reactivity (a hallmark of PTSD) and produces sustained anxiety-like defensive behavior [23, 
24]. Conversely, CRH receptor antagonism inhibits startle activity [24]. CRH signaling 
involves the coupling of the CRH receptors, R1 and R2 to a Gαs (G protein, alpha subunit), 
which activates cyclic AMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling; PKA then regulates multiple 
cellular systems via phosphorylation of cytosolic and nuclear target proteins [25]. 
Interestingly, pharmacological studies show that antagonism of PKA activity blocks CRH-
induced startle hyperreactivity [8], further demonstrating that CRH signaling contributes to 
hypersensitive PTSD symptoms.

CRH-mediated PTSD-related behaviors, including anxiety and fear, are also dependent on 
the brain region being examined. For example, CRH activation of another cellular protein 
kinase, Akt in the ventral tegmentum area (VTA), promotes resistance to anxiety- and 
depressive-like responses to stress [26] whereas Akt stimulation in the dorsal hippocampus 
or basolateral amygdala increase fear responses [26]. These brain regions control 
fundamentally different behaviors (e.g., VTA regulates motivation and reward; amygdala 
controls fear learning and anxiety), and further understanding of the signaling pathways and 
interactions of these brain circuits would provide additional insights into the role of CRH in 
mediating PTSD symptoms. Interestingly, transgenic mice expressing high levels of CRF 
also develop increased expression of a chaperone protein, FKBP5, that binds to and 
inactivates GR function; genetic studies demonstrate association of FKBP5 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) with PTSD [27, 28], suggesting that there is cross talk between CRH 
and GR signaling pathways that may play an important role in PTSD pathophysiology.

Basal levels of cortisol are reported to be low in the blood of PTSD patients (Fig. 1) [29, 30], 
although there is also conflicting evidence. A meta-analysis of 37 studies reported that blood 
cortisol levels were not significantly different in PTSD patients compared to controls [31]. 
However, this study points out differences in collection and analysis as possible caveats; 
these include number of females in each cohort, time of day during which blood collection 
occurred, and the nature of the trauma. Cortisol levels are regulated by glucocorticoid-GR 
feedback signaling at multiple levels of the HPA axis, the hippocampus, and other brain 
regions and disruption of one or more of these is thought to be involved with PTSD 
pathophysiology. However, while cortisol levels are featured prominently in the literature, it 
is important to point out that there is currently no association between GR polymorphisms 
and PTSD [32].

Traumatic experiences activate several brain regions that have been implicated in the 
pathophysiology of PTSD, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) [33–36], amygdala [37–
40], hippocampus [36, 41, 42], and the anterior cingulate [43]. White matter connections 
between the ventral region of the medial PFC (vmPFC) and the amygdala mediate 
bidirectional communication that regulates fear learning and extinction [44]. The amygdala 
is a subcortical limbic structure that also communicates with the brain stem and 
hypothalamus, as well as the hippocampus to regulate components of fear and emotional 
responses.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the vmPFC provides important inhibitory control 
over amygdala function, and the disruption of vmPFC-amygdala communication is thought 
to play a critical role in the pathogenesis and expression of PTSD symptoms [45]. The 
amygdala is a key region involved in emotional learning, particularly in the acquisition and 
expression of fear and anxiety in response to traumatic or stressful events [46, 47]. In 
healthy individuals, amygdala activity is dampened by inhibitory signals from the vmPFC, 
which is thought to reduce stress due to fearful or traumatic experiences [33–36, 48]. In 
patients with PTSD, vmPFC function is impaired and results in over activation of the 
amygdala and pathological stress and anxiety responses [49–51]. This model is consistent 
with neuroimaging studies that demonstrate hypoactivation of the vmPFC and 
hyperactivation of the amygdala in PTSD patients compared to healthy controls [35, 36, 52].

Insights to the functional impact of vmPFC and amygdala have also come from anecdotal 
evidence from patients with lesions of these brain regions. There is evidence that damage to 
the amygdala reduces the chances of developing PTSD—consistent with evidence of 
pathological hyperactivity of amygdala [45, 53]. Surprisingly, veterans who experience 
lesions of the vmPFC due to wounds sustained in combat are also resistant to developing 
PTSD [45, 53, 54]. This finding would seem to suggest that the vmPFC plays a more 
complicated role in PTSD pathophysiology than simply top-down regulation of the 
amygdala. It is also possible that these findings are complicated by the size and location of 
the lesions, which could influence nearby PFC subregions with different functional effects. 
For example, studies in rodents demonstrate that the vmPFC is required for extinction of 
fear, but that the region dorsal to vmPFC in rodents, referred to as the prelimbic PFC, 
receives projections from the amygdala and is required for fear learning [55, 56].

Together, these studies raise an important question regarding the molecular and cellular 
alterations in the vmPFC and amygdala that contribute to the loss or gain of function, 
respectively, in PTSD. Preclinical studies in rodents as well as next-generation sequencing 
of postmortem vmPFC and amygdala from PTSD subjects are being conducted to address 
this question. These studies are discussed in the next section.

Abnormal Gene Expression in the Pathophysiology of PTSD

Neuronal function is controlled at many levels, including the regulation of gene expression. 
The first step in gene expression is transcription of DNA into mRNA transcripts. Most of the 
genetic regulation in humans occurs at the level of the transcriptional control of gene 
expression, which is regulated at multiple levels, including activation/inhibition of

transcription factors, epigenetic changes (i.e., methylation of DNA, acetylation of histones), 
and the signaling pathways that regulate the latter. The ultimate goal of gene expression 
profiling is to identify transcripts expressed by certain tissues or cells and the levels of these 
transcripts. Most gene expression profiling studies fall into two categories: single and multi-
transcript studies. The former traditionally uses in situ hybridization or quantitative real-time 
PCR to identify changes in one or several transcripts in a given tissue. The latter makes use 
of microarrays or next-generation sequencing to identify many or all of the transcript 
changes occurring in a particular tissue.

To obtain meaningful data from gene expression studies, it is important to consider the target 
tissues to be analyzed. While brain tissue is clearly the optimal choice for understanding the 
neurobiology of PTSD, it is nearly impossible at the present time to biopsy tissue from 
living patients (this might become possible in the future). This makes postmortem brains of 
PTSD patients the most relevant tissue source to identify functional biomarkers for PTSD. 
There are, however, several caveats that must be monitored during postmortem tissue 
collection. Changes to pH, temperature, and the length of the agonal state (the time between 
death and collection of tissue) can all affect transcript levels and are a source of intersubject 
variation [57]. Perhaps the most relevant issue faced in identifying gene expression changes 
in PTSD brain is the lack of curated brain banks. To address this issue, the Veterans 
Administration through the National Center for PTSD has begun building a repository of 
PTSD brain tissue, the National PTSD Brain Bank (NPBB) [58], that is available for 
research. The few postmortem studies discussed here were conducted with the NPBB brain 
tissue.

The first study to examine transcript changes in postmortem PTSD identified an increase 
p11 (S100A10) in PFC (Brodmann area 46) [59••]. The p11 protein plays a well-established 
role in regulating mood and has been shown to be downregulated in patients with depression 
[60] It localizes to the plasma membrane and has a primary role in the cell in binding 
calcium. Studies also show that rats exposed to inescapable tail shock (an animal model of 
PTSD) have increased levels of p11 in the PFC. This study also found that the synthetic 
glucocorticoid dexamethasone upregulated p11 expression through the glucocorticoid 
response elements (GREs) in the p11 promoter. Glucocorticoid regulation of p11 is 
particularly interesting given the importance of glucocorticoids in the pathophysiology of 
PTSD and demonstrates a possible mechanism whereby traumatic stress regulates p11 
expression.

In a recent study, we reported on the first whole transcriptome analysis of a small cohort of 
PTSD subjects in dorsolateral PFC (the lateral part of Brodmann areas 9 and 46) [61••]. 
Among the changes in gene expression that were found was a significant decrease in 
transcript levels of serum/glucocorticoid kinase 1 (Sgk1) in PTSD subjects compared to 
controls. Sgk1 regulates numerous enzymes and transcription factors involved in 
inflammation, glucocorticoid signaling, and cell proliferation. Notably, Sgk1 transcription is 
regulated by GR signaling (Fig. 1) [62]. We found that viral-mediated knockdown of Sgk1 
in the medial PFC induces helplessness and anhedonic behaviors in rats, supporting a 
functional role for reduced Sgk1 expression in PTSD. Knockdown of Sgk1 also resulted in a 
reduction in neuronal spine synapse density, demonstrating a change in neuronal

morphology linked to PTSD [61••]. Further, we examined the role of Sgk1 in classical fear 
conditioning followed by extinction (an animal model of PTSD). Sgk1 knockdown in the 
medial PFC elicited no changes in the formation of fear memory/conditioning or on the rate 
of extinction. However, animals with knockdown of Sgk1 demonstrated increased freezing 
behavior during the first time blocks of the context recall (when the animals were placed in 
the training context) 6 days after fear conditioning. Downregulation of Sgk1 may therefore 
enhance the memory of contextual cues associated with traumatic stress.

In another recent report, we combined human postmortem gene expression profiling with 
neuroimaging to examine the possible disruption of glutamate cycling disruption in PTSD 
[63]. Live human photon emission topography (PET) was used to measure the difference in 
levels of metabotropic glutamate (mGlur5). The results demonstrate increased levels of 
mGlur5 in PTSD patients, suggesting that glutamate cycling and transmission is disrupted. 
Previous studies have also identified a role for mGlur5 in regulating fear conditioning [64] 
as well as the acquisition and expression of fear [65]. It is interesting to note that greater 
availability of mGlur5 correlates with avoidance symptoms of PTSD. The postmortem gene 
expression study examined how glutamate related transcripts were altered in postmortem 
subgenual PFC, a subregion of the vmPFC, of PTSD patients. Although there was no 
significant difference in levels of mGlur5 transcripts between PTSD and matched controls, 
there was a significant upregulation of SH3 (Src, Homology-3) and multiple ankyrin repeat 
domains 1 (Shank1). This provides a mechanism to explain increased mGlur5 availability as 
Shank1 protein binds to and anchors mGlur5 to the cell surface.

One of the most important molecular findings in PTSD research is that patients exhibit 
abnormally high GR sensitivity [30]. Central to this finding is the immunophilin Fkpb5 
(FK506 binding protein 5), which has become one of the most studied genes in PTSD 
research. FKBP5 is a co-chaperone of HSP90 that controls GR signaling, including 
regulation of GR translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus; binding of cortisol to GR 
results in dissociation of FKBP5 and subsequent GR translocation to the nucleus (see Fig. 
1). Gene association studies of PTSD have identified four single nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) risk alleles in the FKBP5 gene. rs9470080, rs360780, rs3800373, and rs9296158 that 
are predictors of adult PTSD onset [66–68]. These SNPs have been linked to other 
neuropsychiatric findings, including antidepressant response, stress induced onset of major 
depression, dissociative symptoms in children exposed to trauma or abuse, and abnormal 
HPA regulation [7, 67]. All four SNPs interact with childhood abuse to predict PTSD 
lifetime severity including levels of hyperarousal and alterations in reactivity [69]. Further, 
decreased Fkpb5 transcript levels have been observed in peripheral blood and subgenual 
PFC of patients with PTSD [63].

In addition to glucocorticoid signaling, research efforts have been focused on changes in 
immune function in PTSD [70]. A synthesis of the current literature reveals disruption of 
inflammatory signaling in PTSD patients [11, 71]. These studies have primarily examined 
patients currently diagnosed with PTSD, making it difficult to determine whether these 
changes in immune function are a cause of PTSD or a result of chronic illness. Several 
studies have identified a reduction in cytokine and colony-stimulating factors in PTSD 
peripheral blood [27, 72]. One study found PTSD gender differences, with men, but not

women, showing significantly decreased levels of three transcripts in monocytes isolated 
from peripheral blood (Pf4, Sdpr, and Hist1h2ac) [73]. Stat5b, a transcription factor that 
regulates both the inflammatory and the glucocorticoid system, is reported to be 
downregulated in PTSD patients [30, 74]. Interestingly, one study identified downregulation 
of major histocompatibility complex 2 in patients with PTSD [30] (For a complete list of 
PTSD RNA biomarkers, see Table 1.).

Animal Models of PTSD

Genetic, molecular, and cellular abnormalities contribute to the pathophysiology of PTSD 
and present a complex challenge to the development of rodent models to understand the 
neurobiology of this disorder. Because of the difficulty inherent in reproducing the entire 
complex of features present in PTSD, researchers have largely turned to models that 
reproduce core behavioral and physiological aspects of the illness. Additionally, animal 
models provide insight to the neurobiology underlying PTSD-like behavior that cannot be 
thoroughly investigated in the clinical setting. Here we provide a description of animal 
models that are currently being used to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of 
PTSD.

Symptoms of PTSD develop after exposure to traumatic or stressful experiences, so one 
approach that the researchers have turned to is exposure to stress to model PTSD in rodents. 
Rodent models of PTSD generally utilize physical (i.e., stressors with the potential for 
bodily harm) or psychological (i.e., stressors that put animals in proximity to potential 
threats) stressors alone or in combination to reproduce features of the disorder. 
Heterogeneity in stress models arises not only through choice of stressor(s) utilized but also 
through laboratory specific choices in regard to the duration of stress application and the 
number of stressor exposures utilized. Though care should be taken in interpretation of 
results based on choice of stressor(s) used, many of the stress models employed demonstrate 
the ability to produce symptoms associated with PTSD.

Stressor controllability is demonstrated to play an important role in development of multiple 
features of PTSD. Initial work in the Seligman lab [78] demonstrated that animals exposed 
to inescapable foot shocks failed to learn an escape behavior that was readily learned by 
animals that could terminate the shocks by lever pressing. Exposure to uncontrollable stress 
has subsequently been shown to produce lasting alterations in PTSD relevant behavior and 
physiology [79]. For instance, uncontrollable foot shock a week prior to fear conditioning 
has been demonstrated to increase fear expression while uncontrollable foot shock after fear 
conditioning enhances fear expression, delays extinction, and supports the recovery of fear 
expression well after extinction training (e.g., spontaneous recovery) [80••]. Additionally, 
uncontrollable foot shock reduces the response of the HPA axis to subsequent foot shock 
[81]. These results are consistent with dysregulated fear and HPA axis reactivity in PTSD. A 
wealth of studies indicate that the PFC is critical for detection of stressor controllability 
[80••, 82–85] consistent with observations that impaired PFC function may be an important 
mediator of PTSD symptoms.

Another model is single prolonged stress (SPS), which reproduces multiple aspects of PTSD 
symptomatology. In a typical SPS experiment, restraint stress is followed by a forced swim 
exposure that produces unconsciousness [86]. In the SPS model, the back-to-back exposure 
to physical stressors is followed by a 7 to 14-day period undisturbed in the colony room that 
is utilized to incubate development of PTSD-like symptoms. This time-dependent incubation 
of symptoms was previously suggested to be important for development of PTSD, which 
may arise well after a traumatic event [87]. SPS produces many of the symptoms commonly 
associated with PTSD. For instance, SPS exposed rats demonstrate enhanced glucocorticoid 
negative feedback [86], which is thought to underlie the observed decrease in peripheral 
cortisol levels in PTSD patients [88–90]. Importantly, this is in opposition to reduced 
glucocorticoid negative feedback typically observed in depressed patients, as well as after 
multi-week chronic variable stress paradigms used to model depression in rodents [91]. SPS 
exposed rats also demonstrate increased startle reactivity [92], a measure of anxiety and 
increased arousal, and increased depression like behavior in the forced swim test [93]. SPS 
has also demonstrated validity as a PTSD model by producing abnormal fear conditioning 
[94] and fear responses that are resistant to extinction [95]. Recently, a similar model has 
been validated in mice across many of the PTSD-associated measures described previously 
[96].

A hallmark of PTSD is the inability to forget or extinguish traumatic events, and one model 
that has been used to study this deficit is extinction of conditioned fear in rodents [36, 97]. 
Rodents are readily conditioned to freeze in an environment in which they have been 
exposed to a noxious stimulus, such as a footshock. Repeated reexposure to the audio and 
visual cues but without the footshock results in extinction of the conditioned fear and has 
been used to study the neurobiology underlying deficits in fear extinction. This model has 
also been used to test treatments for PTSD that could enhance extinction. Importantly, the 
vmPFC, particularly the infralimbic PFC in rodents, as discussed previously, is required for 
fear extinction. We have reported that the rapid antidepressant ketamine enhances the 
extinction of fear in rats [98] consistent with recent clinical findings that ketamine improves 
PTSD symptoms in patients [99, 100]. We also found that increased fear extinction was 
associated with enhanced mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) signaling 
in the vmPFC and that pretreatment with an inhibitor of mTORC1 blocked ketamine 
enhancement of extinction. mTORC1 directs cellular translation by signaling through 4E-
EBP1 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding) and ribosomal S6 kinase [101]. 
This provides an example of the types of studies that can be conducted to test novel 
therapeutic agents and characterize neurobiological mechanisms of treatment response and 
pathophysiology.

While physical stressors clearly also contain psychologically stressful components, stressors 
that do not pose a direct risk for bodily harm may also be useful for studying PTSD. 
Predator odor stress models are commonly used to study development of emotional and 
traumatic behaviors in animals. These studies commonly show that exposure to cat odor is 
capable of producing prolonged anxiety-like behavior in tests such as the elevated plus maze 
and is able to act as an unconditioned stimulus to alter behavior when associated with 
contextual cues [102]. Predator odor exposure has also been shown to impact females to a 
greater extent than males, consistent with sex differences in the PTSD development in

humans [103]. Additionally, when using Lewis rats, exposure to predator odor has been 
shown to reflect the individual differences in development of PTSD present in human 
populations exposed to trauma. Approximately 50% of the Lewis rats develop persistent 
anxiety like behavior after predator odor exposure, with the remaining 50% of the animals 
indistinguishable from unexposed animals in the same tests [104]. Notably, the stress 
sensitive animals demonstrate persistent fear behavior, as well hippocampal dependent 
memory deficits [105, 106]. It is interesting to note that Lewis rats have a blunted response 
to stress [104]. This type of effect of stress is observed in patients with PTSD [88, 107] and 
makes the predator stress models a unique avenue for investigating certain aspects of PTSD 
that are not possible in the SPSM model.

Another physical stress model, underwater stress exposure [108] also models aspects of 
PTSD as do social stress models such as social defeat, and models employing housing 
instability. However, a thorough review of all models is beyond the scope of this review. The 
models described above demonstrate validity across many behavioral and physiological 
hallmarks of PTSD and demonstrate the utility of investigating animal models of the 
disorder.

Conclusions

Currently, our understanding of the molecular components of PTSD is limited. The vast 
majority of studies looking at the transcript changes in PTSD have been conducted on 
samples from peripheral blood. Unfortunately, some of these studies have contradictory 
findings but implicate several biological processes as likely contributors to the 
pathophysiology of PTSD. Chemokine, cytokine, and interleukin systems are clearly altered 
in PTSD and are likely to lead to disruption of feedback control of inflammatory processes. 
Dysregulation of glucocorticoid signaling is a hallmark of PTSD pathophysiology and likely 
a major contributing factor. There have been numerous studies implicating FKBP5, a GR 
chaperone protein responsible for nuclear translocation, in both animal models of PTSD, 
postmortem studies, and in peripheral blood.

Future studies looking at the molecular underpinnings of PTSD will focus on characterizing 
the abnormal transcriptomic and proteomic changes in PTSD in blood and brain. A recent 
paper highlighted a need to integrate future postmortem analysis with gene association 
studies that have already been performed [77••]. This integration of GWAS and 
transcriptomics is likely to identify the molecular factors most directly responsible for PTSD 
onset, provide biomarkers for people susceptible to develop PTSD prior to trauma, and 
identify relevant therapeutic targets. While much has been done to understand the molecular 
and cellular consequences of PTSD, it is likely that future studies will identify novel 
pathways, gene networks, and disease transcript modules that underlie the pathophysiology 
of PTSD onset and expression.

Fig. 1. 
Altered glucocorticoid signaling in PTSD. Under normal conditions (top), glucocorticoids 
(GCs) enter the cell and bind with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), resulting in dissociation 
of GR from the chaperone proteins HSP90 and FKBP5. GR is then phosphorylated by a 
series of kinases (including SGK1) and the GC-GR complex can translocate into the nucleus 
to regulate gene expression via GR binding to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE). 
Included in the numerous genes regulated by GC-GR is Fkpb5, which provides a mechanism 
for negative feedback as increased levels of FKBP5 protein can then bind to and inhibit the 
translocation of GR to the nucleus. PTSD (bottom) is characterized by hypocortisolism or 
reduced GC levels. This results in less GC available to bind to GR, which then remains 
associated with FKBP5/HSP90 and blocks nuclear translocation and reduces GC-GR 
regulated gene expression. This reduction in GC-GR transcription impacts several important 
genes, including Fkbp5 and Sgk1 and disrupts the negative feedback loop necessary to 
control GR signaling
