Abstract
The present study was a first attempt to examine the mediating role of resilience in the relationships between fear of happiness and affect
balance, satisfaction with life, and flourishing. Participants consisted of 256 Turkish adults (174 males and 82 females) and aged between
18 and 62 years (M = 36.97, SD = 9.02). Participants completed measures assessing fear of happiness, affect balance, satisfaction with
life, and flourishing. The results showed that fear of happiness was negatively correlated with resilience, affect balance, satisfaction with
life,  and  flourishing,  while  resilience  was  positively  correlated  with  affect  balance,  satisfaction  with  life,  and  flourishing.  The  results  of
mediation analysis showed that (a) resilience fully mediated the effect of fear of happiness upon flourishing, and satisfaction with life, (b)
partially  mediated  the  effect  of  fear  of  happiness  upon  affect  balance.  These  findings  suggest  that  resilience  helps  to  explain  the
associations  between  fear  of  happiness  and  affect  balance,  satisfaction  with  life,  and  flourishing.  This  study  elucidates  the  potential
mechanism behind the association between fear of happiness and indicators of well-being.

With the advent of positive psychology, researchers have focused not only on treating negative states (e.g. de-

pression, anxiety) but also promoting positive states (e.g. happiness, life satisfaction), individual strengths and

their relations to mental health, well-being and social prosperity (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Positive

psychology  emphasises  the  importance  of  identifying  and  understanding  factors  associated  with  subjective

well-being, psychological well-being, and flourishing.

Recent  research  identified  new  sets  of  variables  that  affect  both  subjective  and  psychological  well-being.  For

example, fear of happiness is one of the variables that was found to be negatively associated with positive psy-

chological  variables.  Fear  of  happiness  refers  to  the  notion  that  being  happy  results  in  bad  things  to  happen

and should be bewared of (Joshanloo, 2013). According to Joshanloo (2013), individuals who have high levels

of fear of happiness may suppress their authentic positive emotions toward pursuing happiness to shun nega-
tive effects of positive states of mind (e.g. happiness, joy). Fear of happiness can be considered as a dysfunc-

tional belief that may generate a tendency toward dampening of positive emotions. There is a variety of factors

affecting people’s attitude toward experience of positive emotions. Joshanloo (2013) grounded the theoretical

position of fear of happiness on a wide range of contexts including culture, religion, and superstitious beliefs.

Giving specific focus to the cultural differences, Joshanloo et al. (2014) argued that fear of happiness is a re-

flection of culture and should be considered as a beliefs system in a culture. Therefore, culture is an important

factor that affect people’s attitude toward perception and experience of positive emotions. Reasons for endors-

ing fear of happiness vary from person to person and culture to culture. However, four reasons appear to be

universal for holding fear of happiness beliefs: (a) being happy stimulates unpleasant things to happen, (b) be-

ing happy morally makes you a worse person, (c) expressing positive emotions (e.g. happiness, cheerfulness)

is bad for you and others, (d) seeking for happiness is bad for you and others (Joshanloo & Weijers, 2014).

Previous research provided evidence on the impact of fear of happiness on one’s well-being by showing that

fear of happiness is negatively associated with subjective happiness, satisfaction with life, positive affect, au-

tonomy, positive relations with others, self-acceptance, environmental mastery, personal growth, and purpose in

life and that positively associated with negative affect (Joshanloo, 2013; Yildirim & Aziz, 2017; Yildirim & Belen,

2018). That is, individuals with higher levels of fear of happiness report lower levels of subjective and psycho-

logical well-being. Studies also demonstrated that higher scores on fear of happiness were related with higher

scores on externality of happiness and lower scores on self-esteem (Yildirim, Barmanpek, & Farag, 2018). Fur-

thermore, fear of happiness was found to be uniquely important to both subjective and psychological well-being

after controlling for personality. Fear of happiness is directly responsible for regulating individual difference in

the  experience  of  lower  positive  affect  and  higher  negative  affect  —  components  of  subjective  well-being  —

and lower positive relations with others, self-acceptance and autonomy — components of psychological well-

being (Yildirim & Belen, 2018).

Well-being  is  a  multifaceted  concept  of  optimal  experience,  and  functioning  and  generally  derived  from  two

broad approaches (Ryan & Deci, 2001). The first approach is subjective well-being or happiness, grounded on

hedonism and that refers to the experience of pleasure and avoidance of pain (Kahneman, Diener, & Schwarz,

1999). The second approach is psychological well-being or flourishing, grounded on eudaimonia, and that re-

fers  to  how  to  achieve  the  realization  of  one’s  authentic  potential,  goals,  meaning,  and  fulfilment  in  life  (Ryff,

1989;  Ryff  &  Keyes,  1995).  Subjective  well-being  refers  to  cognitive  and  affective  assessment  of  life  (Diener,

1984, 2000). Put it differently, subjective well-being is defined as what individuals think and how they feel about

their  lives  when  they  make  cognitive  and  affective  judgements  about  their  existence  (Seligman  &

Csikszentmihalyi,  2000).  Subjective  well-being  is  conceptualized  as  being  a  tripartite  model  that  constitutes

three different, yet associated elements: the presence of frequent positive emotions, the infrequent of negative

emotions, and the satisfaction with life (Diener, Lucas, & Oishi, 2002; Diener, Scollon, & Lucas, 2003; Ryan &

Deci, 2001). Cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental studies revealed that individual with high levels of

subjective well-being are more successful across different life domains including but not limited to social rela-

tionship,  marriage,  income,  work  performance,  and  physical  and  mental  health.  Evidence  also  showed  that

happiness-related characteristics, resources, and successes are arisen as results of experiencing frequent pos-

itive affect (Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener, 2005). Furthermore, studies indicated that higher satisfaction with life

is  positively  associated  with  adaptive  psychological  constructs  (e.g.  gratitude)  and  negatively  associated  with

maladaptive psychological constructs (e.g. perceived stress) (Yildirim & Alanazi, 2018). Psychological well-be-

ing  has  been  characterised  as  an  array  of  psychological  characteristics  concerned  with  positive  human  func-

tioning  such  as  striving  for  excellence  and  engagement  with  life  difficulties  (Keyes,  Shmotkin,  &  Ryff,  2002).

Ryff (1989) proposed that psychological well-being can be defined as having six elements including, autonomy,

positive  relations  with  others,  self-acceptance,  environmental  mastery,  purpose  in  life  and  personal  growth.

These elements are theoretically and empirically independent yet related with one another and that an optimal

achievement of psychological well-being requires striving each of the elements independently. Cross-sectional

and longitudinal evidence suggested that psychological well-being is related with flexible and creative thinking,

pro-social behaviour, physical health (Huppert, 2009), and meatal health (Ryff, Radler, & Friedman, 2015).

The  concept  of  flourishing  is  presented  as  an  inclusive  and  integrative  theoretical  framework  to  understand

well-being  by  encompassing  psychological  and  social  well-being  and  refers  to  optimal  level  of  well-being

(Diener et al., 2010; Keyes, 2002). Flourishing as a psychosocial model of well-being is described as a compo-

sition of feeling good and functioning effectively and that includes multiple concepts of high levels of psycholog-

ical well-being, emotional well-being, and social well-being (Huppert & So, 2013; Keyes, 2002). It also refers to

a fundamental ingredient of well-being that leads to a positive human development (Huppert & So, 2013), and

fulfilment and purpose in life (Seligman, 2011). Flourishing is not only the absence of mental health problems

such as anxiety and depression, but also the opposite of mental health problem (Huppert & So, 2013). It can be

conceived  as  a  source  of  resilience,  functioning  as  a  protective  factor  against  stressful  life  events  (Keyes,

2002).

According to Huppert and So (2013), flourishing should be investigated in its own right to determine the corre-

lates and causes of flourishing in order to understand positive aspects of human functioning. Seligman (2011)

provided a theoretical foundation of flourishing by combining hedonic and eudaimonic approaches of well-being

and grounded flourishing on five independent but related elements, known with the acronym of PERMA: Posi-

tive emotions (P), engagement (E), relationships (R), meaning (M), and achievement (A).

It is important to enhance flourishing in order to promote well-being. Evidence suggested that flourishing is rela-

ted with psychosocial functioning including better emotional health, higher engagement with daily life activities,

fewer work loss days, and days of work cutbacks (Keyes, 2002, 2007). Studies also showed that flourishing is

positively associated with purpose in life, resilience, and high intimacy and negatively with helplessness, risk of

cardiovascular  disease,  chronic  physical  diseases  with  age  (Keyes,  2007).  Flourishing  individuals  are  more

likely to function positively in different contexts.

Resilience as a Mediator

Resilience is an important concept that attracts a great deal of attention of researchers across different fields

including psychology, sociology, education and economy. Resilience refers to one’s capability to “bounce back”

or “recovery” from negative life events, resist to illness and flexibility to adapt the environment in order to main-

tain his or her physical and psychological well-being (Ryff & Singer, 2003; Smith et al., 2008). Resilience is also

characterised as a functional personality characteristic that promotes individual thriving after extremely traumat-

ic events (Bonanno, 2004).

Resilience is a critical individual characteristic in promotion of well-being and associated with a wide range of

health-related  outcomes.  Research  into  resilience  has  showed  that  resilience  is  negatively  associated  with

anxiety,  perceived  stress,  depression,  negative  affect,  and  physical  symptoms  and  that  positively  associated

with positive affect both in clinical and non-clinical samples (Smith et al., 2008). Smith et al. (2008) also found

that resilience is positively associated with optimism, purpose in life, social support, active coping, and positive

reframing  and  negatively  associated  with  pessimism,  alexithymia,  negative  interaction,  behavioral  disengage-

ment, denial, and self-blame. Individuals with higher levels of resilience are more likely to experience less men-

tal, social, and physical health problems. Some studies have explicitly explored the relationship between resil-

ience and subjective and psychological well-being. For example, Sagone and De Caroli (2014) showed that re-

silience  is  positively  related  with  autonomy,  environmental  mastery,  positive  relations  with  others,  personal

growth, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. Higher scores on resilience reflect greater psychological well-be-

ing.  Shi  et  al.  (2015)  conducted  a  cross-sectional  study  of  the  mediating  role  of  resilience  in  the  relationship

between stress and life satisfaction in Chinese medical students and found that resilience partially mediates the

relationship between stress and life satisfaction. Higher scores on perceived stress are negatively associated

with lower scores on resilience, resulting in lower level of life satisfaction.

Individuals with high levels of fear of happiness are confronted with various problems when they experience life

challenges.  On  these  occasions,  the  individuals’  levels  of  affect  balance,  satisfaction  with  life,  and  flourishing

may be negatively affected. Previous studies have indicated the direct relationships between fear of happiness

and well-being indices (e.g. Yildirim & Belen, 2018). However, due to the nature of the variables, the relation-

ship between fear of happiness and well-being might be much more complex than a simple direct relationship.

There might be other factors influencing the relationships between fear of happiness and well-being. Resilience

might be a variable with the potential to explain the relationship between fear of happiness and well-being indi-

ces. Considering the negative effect of fear of happiness on individuals’ levels of well-being (Joshanloo, 2017;

Yildirim et al., 2018), resilience might play an important role in protecting well-being against the negative effect

of fear of happiness. To put it differently, resilience may function to preserve and promote positive psychological

outcomes against negative impact of fear of happiness. Hence, examining the mediating role of resilience in the

relationships  between  fear  of  happiness  and  indices  of  well-being  would  be  fruitful  to  understand  the  mecha-

nism underlying between the concepts. This would also assist to expand theoretical and empirical findings on

fear of happiness, well-being, and resilience.

Present Study

Considering the role of resilience as preventive and protective factor in promotion of well-being, examining the

mediating  role  of  resilience  on  the  relationship  between  fear  of  happiness  and  well-being  can  elucidate  the

mechanisms behind this association. The present study is important in terms of being the first study to investi-

gate the impact of resilience in the relationship between fear of happiness and well-being indices. More specifi-

cally,  the  present  study  was  set  out  to  examine  the  impact  of  resilience  on  the  relationships  between  fear  of

happiness and satisfaction with life, affect balance, and flourishing. Accordingly, we expected that fear of happi-

ness  would  share  a  significant  negative  correlation  with  resilience,  satisfaction  with  life,  positive  affect,  affect

balance, and flourishing and a significant positive correlation with negative affect. We also expected that resil-

ience would share a significant positive correlation with satisfaction with life, positive affect, affect balance, and

flourishing and a significant negative correlation with negative affect. Additionally, we hypothesised that fear of

happiness would directly contribute to explain variation in flourishing, satisfaction with life, affect balance, and

resilience. Furthermore, we expected that resilience would be directly important to account for variance in flour-

ishing,  satisfaction  with  life  and  affect  balance.  As  for  the  mediation  role  of  resilience  in  the  relationship  be-

tween fear of happiness and satisfaction with life, affect balance, and flourishing, we expected that resilience

would fully mediate the relationships between fear of happiness and satisfaction with life, and flourishing, and

partially mediate the relationship between fear of happiness and affect balance (see Figure 1).

ted. The most common education levels that participants completed at the time of taking part the survey were

respectively university graduate (50%), post-graduate (32.9%), high-school graduate (10.9%), college graduate

(3.5%), and secondary-school graduate (2.7%). As for their economic levels, the participants (65.2%) generally

perceived their self-status as medium, 18% as low, 9.4% as very low, 6.6% as high, and 0.8% as very high. The

participants did not receive any type of compensation for their involvement in the study.

Measures

Fear of Happiness Scale

The Fear of Happiness Scale (FOH), developed by Joshanloo (2013), is a 5-item self-report scale that is de-

signed to be unidimensional. The scale measures the general idea that having extreme positive emotions may

lead  to  negative  outcomes.  The  items  are  rated  on  a  7-point  scale,  ranging  from  1  (strongly  disagree)  to  7

(strongly agree). Some of the items are “Having lots of joy and fun causes bad things to happen” and “Exces-

sive joy has some bad consequences.” The scale score is the sum of items, with higher scores indicating high-

er  level  of  fear  of  happiness.  Reliability  and  validity  studies  of  Turkish  adaptation  of  the  scale  indicated  good

evidence of reliability and validity (Yildirim & Aziz, 2017). In this study, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the FOH

was .86.

Satisfaction With Life Scale

The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), developed by Diener et al. (1985), is a 5-item self-report scale that is

constructed  to  be  unidimensional.  The  scale  assesses  individual’s  global  judgements  of  life  satisfaction.  The

items are rated on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Some of the items

are “In most ways my life is close to my ideal” and “I am satisfied with my life.” The scale score is the sum of

items, with higher scores indicating higher level of life satisfaction. Turkish adaptation of the scale showed sat-

isfactory evidence of reliability and validity (Durak, Senol-Durak, & Gencoz, 2010). In the present study, Cron-

bach’s alpha coefficient for the SWBS was .81.

Scales of Positive and Negative Experience

The Scales of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE), developed by Diener et al. (2010), is two-six items

subscales  measuring  individual  positive  and  negative  emotional  experiences  and  feelings  over  the  previous

four  weeks.  The  items  are  rated  on  a  5-point  scale,  ranging  from  1  (very  rarely  or  never)  to  5  (very  often  or

always). Some items are “positive”, “happy”, “negative” and “sad”. The scale scores for positive affect and neg-

ative  affect  subscales  are  separately  summed,  with  higher  scores  showing  frequent  experiences  of  positive

feelings and frequent experiences of negative feelings, respectively. Affect balance score can be obtained by

subtracting the negative score from the positive score, with higher scores showing frequent experiences of pos-

itive  feelings  and  infrequent  experiences  of  negative  feelings.  Turkish  adaptation  of  the  scale  indicated  good

evidence of reliability and validity (Telef, 2015). In the present study, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the posi-

tive affect and negative affect were respectively .82 and .84.

Flourishing Scale

The Flourishing Scale (FS), developed by Diener et al. (2010), is an 8-item scale that is established to be unidi-

mensional. The scale measures a wide range of social-psychological well-being from important domains of hu-

man  functioning  including  relationships,  life  purpose,  self-esteem  and  optimism.  The  items  are  rated  on  a  7-

point scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Some items are “My social relationships

are  supportive  and  rewarding”  and  “I  lead  a  purposeful  and  meaningful  life.”  The  scale  score  is  the  sum  of

items, with higher scores referring to higher level of satisfaction in significant areas of functioning. Turkish adap-

tation  of  the  scale  revealed  satisfactory  evidence  of  reliability  and  validity  (Telef,  2010).  In  the  present  study,

Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the FH was .85.

Brief Resilience Scale

The  Brief  Resilience  Scale  (BRS),  developed  by  Smith  et  al.  (2008),  is  a  6-item  self-report  scale  that  is  de-

signed to be unidimensional. The scale measures the ability to bounce back or recover from adversities, set-

backs,  and  failures.  The  items  are  rated  on  a  5-point  scale,  ranging  from  1  (strongly  disagree)  to  5  (strongly

agree). Some of the items are “I tend to bounce back quickly after hard times” and “I tend to take a long time to

get over set-backs in my life.” Scale scores are the mean of items, with reverse coding of negatively worded

items. Higher scores indicate higher ability of resilience to bounce back from stress. Turkish adaptation of the

scale demonstrated satisfactory evidence of reliability and validity (Doğan, 2015). In this study, Cronbach’s al-

pha coefficient for the BRS was .86.

Procedure

All participants completed online versions of the scales as part of questionnaire batteries being conducted for

other studies. A secured online software was utilized for the data collection. The questionnaires were electroni-

cally advertised, after creating a link whereby participants had to click the link to access the study. Participants

were  assured  regarding  protection  and  disposal  of  personal  data  and  confidentiality  at  any  stage.  They  were

also  guaranteed  about  anonymity  whereby  they  were  assigned  a  number  which  was  not  directly  associated

with  their  personal  information  in  our  records.  Furthermore,  the  participants  were  given  freedom  to  withdraw

from the study at any point in time without giving any reason. Those who agreed to collaborate were only al-

lowed to continue and those who did not agree to collaborate were automatically discontinued completing the

survey due to the way that the survey was designed. Participation was voluntary and consent to participate was

obtained from each participants through the first page of the online survey. Presentation of the questionnaires

was same for all participants.

Preliminary Analysis

Results

Prior to the main analysis, a preliminary analysis was conducted to determine whether the data was suitable for

the analysis. Univariate outlier was computed using Z-score test statistic (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). No case

was identified as a univariate outlier as all Z-scores were within the range of +3.29 and -3.29. Multivariate outli-
ers were estimated using Mahalanobis D2 test and no case was determined as multivariate outlier. Tolerance
and variance inflation factor through standard linear regression analysis were used to test for multicollinearity

among the independent variables. No multicollinearity issue in the data set was detected as variance inflation

factor  was  not  greater  than  10  and  tolerance  factor  did  not  approach  zero.  Skewness  and  kurtosis  statistics

were  used  to  examine  normality  assumption.  According  to  Curran,  West,  and  Finch  (1996),  if  skewness  and
kurtosis values fall within the range of +1 and -1, the data is normally distributed. Table 2 shows means, stand-

ard deviations, skewness and kurtosis values with corresponding standard errors for each of the variables used

in the study. As seen in Table 2, all variables fall within the range of +1 and -1, proving very good normal uni-

variate distribution.

Pearson  product-moment  correlation  coefficients  were  estimated  among  all  the  study  variables  used  in  the

present study. Table 3 presents the correlation coefficients between the study variables. As shown in Table 3,

fear of happiness shared a significant negative correlation with resilience, positive affect, affect balance, satis-

faction with life, and flourishing and a significant positive correlation with negative affect. Resilience shared sig-

nificant positive correlations with satisfaction with life, positive affect, affect balance, and flourishing and a sig-

nificant negative correlation with negative affect.

Mediation Analysis

Separate regression analyses were performed to investigate the effect of fear of happiness on affect balance,

satisfaction with life, and flourishing through resilience. For the mediation analysis, we adapted procedures rec-

ommended by Baron and Kenny (1986). In that procedure, establishment of four steps are required for the me-

diational hypothesis. In the first step, the independent variable should be significantly associated with the de-

effect of independent variable on the dependent variable. If the effect is decreased to insignificant level, full me-

diation is present. If the effect is significantly decreased yet still remains significant, partial mediation is present.

To  test  the  mediation  analysis,  three  models  were  hypothesised.  Model  1  suggested  that  resilience  mediates

the relationship between fear of happiness and satisfaction with life. Model 2 suggested that resilience medi-

ates the relationship between fear of happiness and affect balance. Model 3 suggested that resilience mediates

the relationship between fear of happiness and flourishing. We ran regression analyses to examine if resilience

mediated the effect of fear of happiness on satisfaction with life, affect balance and flourishing. For each of the

regression models, we considered satisfaction with life, affect balance, and flourishing as separate dependent

variables and fear of happiness and resilience as independent variable and mediator, respectively.

The  first  regression  analysis  was  conducted  to  examine  whether  fear  of  happiness  significantly  predicted  de-

pendent variables (e.g. satisfaction with life, affect balance, flourishing). The results indicated that fear of happi-
ness had an unique effect on satisfaction with life, R 2 = .02, B = -.10, 95% CI [-.20, -.00], β = -.13, t = -2.03,
p = .043, affect balance, R 2 = .08, B = -.27, 95% CI [-.39, -.16], β = -.29, t = -4.73, p < .001, and flourishing,
R 2 = .02, B = -.14, 95% CI [-.26, -.02], β = -.14, t = -2.27, p = .024. The second regression analysis was con-
ducted to examine whether fear of happiness significantly predicted the mediator (e.g. resilience). The results
indicated that fear of happiness was a significant predictor of resilience, R 2 = .06, B = -.14, 95% CI [-.20, -.07],
β = -.24, t = -3.96, p < .001. The third regression analysis was conducted to examine whether resilience signifi-

cantly predicted dependent variables (e.g. satisfaction with life, affect balance, flourishing). The results indica-
ted that resilience had an unique effect on satisfaction with life, R 2 = .09, B = .42, 95% CI [.26, .59], β = .30, t =
4.92, p < .001, affect balance, R 2 = .31, B = .95, 95% CI [.77, 1.12], β = .56, t = 10.70, p < .001, and flourishing,
R 2 = .19, B = .77, 95% CI [.57, .96], β = .43, t = 7.63, p < .001.

A series of separate hierarchical regression analysis were performed to examine the final step in mediational

hypothesis. For each of the hierarchical regression analysis, fear of happiness and resilience were respectively

treated  as  predictors  in  the  Step  1  and  Step  2,  whereas  satisfaction  with  life,  affect  balance,  and  flourishing

were treated as dependent variables. Table 4 presents the impact of resilience in the relations between fear of

happiness and satisfaction with life, affect balance, and flourishing.

The first hierarchical regression analysis revealed that in the Step 1, fear of happiness significantly predicted
satisfaction with life, (R 2 = .02, B = -.10, 95% CI [-.20, -.00], β = -.13, t = -2.03, p = .043). When resilience was
included into the equation in the Step 2, the predictive effect of fear of happiness on satisfaction with life was

reduced to insignificant, (B = -.05, 95% CI [-.15, .05], β = -.06, t = -.95, p = .345). Resilience, as a mediator,

significantly  predicted  satisfaction  with  life  even  when  fear  of  happiness  was  controlled  for,  (B  =  .40,  95%  CI

[.23, .58], β = .28, t = 4.57, p < .001). A Sobel test (Sobel, 1982) was performed to estimate whether the media-

tion  effect  was  significant.  The  Sobel  test  showed  a  significant  mediation  effect  of  resilience,  (z  =  -3.09,  p  <

0.01). This indicated that resilience has a full mediating  effect on the relation between fear of happiness and

satisfaction with life.

The second hierarchical regression analysis showed that in Step 1, fear of happiness significantly predicted af-
fect balance, (R 2 = .08, B = -.27, 95% CI [-.39, -.16], β = -.29, t = -4.73, p < .001). When resilience was added
into  the  equation  in  the  Step  2,  the  predictive  effect  of  fear  of  happiness  on  affect  balance  was  reduced  yet

significant, (B = -.15, 95% CI [-.25, -.05], β = -.16, t = -3.02, p = .003). Resilience, as a mediator, significantly

predicted  satisfaction  with  life  even  when  fear  of  happiness  was  controlled  for,  (B  =  .88,  95%  CI  [.71,  1.06],

β = .52, t = 9.82, p < .001). The Sobel test indicated that mediator effect of resilience in relation between fear of

happiness and affect balance was statistically significant, (z = -3.72, p < 0.01). The results suggested that resil-

ience partially mediated the relation between fear of happiness and affect balance. The results also suggested

that fear of happiness contributed directly to account for variation in affect balance and indirectly through resil-

ience.

The third hierarchical regression analysis showed that in Step 1, fear of happiness significantly predicted flour-
ishing, (R 2 = .02, B = -.14, 95% CI [-.26, -.02], β = -.14, t = -2.27, p = .024). When resilience was included into
the equation in the Step 2, the predictive effect of fear of happiness on flourishing was reduced to insignificant,

(B = -.04, 95% CI [-.15, .08], β = -.04, t = -.67, p = .503). Resilience, as a mediator, significantly predicted flour-

ishing even when fear of happiness was controlled for, (B = .75, 95% CI [.55, .95], β = .42, t = 7.24, p < .001).

The Sobel test showed a significant mediation effect of resilience, (z = -3.53, p < .01). This indicated that resil-

ience has a full mediating effect on the relation between fear of happiness and flourishing.

Discussion

The current study was the first study that examined the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between

fear of happiness and satisfaction with life, affect balance, and flourishing. The results of the correlation analy-

ses  indicated  that  higher  fear  of  happiness  was  significantly  correlated  with  lower  resilience,  satisfaction  with

life, affect balance, and flourishing. These findings suggest that individuals with higher levels of fear of happi-

ness are more likely to report poor ability to bounce back from stressful life events, subjective well-being, and

psychological functioning. These findings are consistent with previous findings (e.g. Joshanloo, 2013; Yildirim &

Aziz, 2017; Yildirim & Belen, 2018). For example, Yildirim and Belen (2018) found that higher fear of happiness

significantly  associated  with  lower  subjective  and  psychological  well-being.  Indeed,  the  relationships  between

fear of happiness and resilience, and flourishing have not yet been examined. Considering flourishing as a psy-

chosocial form of well-being (Diener et al., 2010; Keyes, 2002; Seligman, 2011) and its negative relation with

maladaptive  variables  (e.g.  depression),  the  emerging  findings  between  fear  of  happiness,  as  a  maladaptive

variable,  and  flourishing  is  in  the  expected  direction.  Similarly,  researchers  (e.g.  Joshanloo,  2017)  proposed

some dysfunctional happiness-related beliefs (e.g. externality of happiness, the idea that happiness is control-

led by external resources) and found that resilience is negatively related to such beliefs and that mediates the

relationships between such beliefs and well-being. Considering that fear of happiness is potentially a dysfunc-

tional belief, the resulting findings are expected. The findings also suggested that higher resilience was associ-

ated with higher satisfaction with life, affect balance, and flourishing. These findings are in the line with relevant

literature on resilience and subjective well-being, and flourishing (e.g. Keyes, 2002; Smith et al., 2008).

However, it is important to note that the effect sizes of the correlations in the present study are small based on

Cohen’s (1992, 1988) criterion in which a value falls within .1 ≤ r < .3 reflects a small effect, a value within .3 ≤ r

< .5 a medium effect, and a value of r > = .5 a large effect. Therefore, these results should be interpreted with

caution.

Prior to testing the mediation models, we found that fear of happiness and resilience had significant direct ef-

fects on satisfaction with life, affect balance, and flourishing. The effects of fear of happiness and resilience on

affect  balance  were  lager  in  magnitude  than  the  effect  on  satisfaction  with  life  and  flourishing.  This  variation

may be related to the theory that affect balance rests on short-term life engagement in terms of experience of

positive emotions and avoidance of pain and that satisfaction with life and psychological well-being or flourish-

ing  relies  on  long-term  life  engagement  (Deci  &  Ryan,  2008;  Keyes,  Shmotkin,  &  Ryff,  2002;  Ryan  &  Deci,

2001; Ryff & Keyes, 1995).

As to testing the mediation models, the results indicated that resilience fully mediated the relationships between

fear  of  happiness  and  satisfaction  with  life,  and  flourishing.  These  findings  suggest  that  as  fear  of  happiness

increases, satisfaction with life and flourishing decrease, and resilience directly affects this relationship. Addi-

tionally, the results showed that fear of happiness had not only direct effect on affect balance, but also indirect

effect on it via resilience. Resilience was found to partially mediate the relationship between fear of happiness

and affect balance. That is, individuals who scored high on fear of happiness had lower resilience, resulting in

lower levels of affect balance, while individuals who scored low on fear of happiness had higher resilience, con-

tributing  to  higher  levels  of  affect  balance.  Higher  fear  of  happiness  also  contributed  to  lower  affect  balance.

These findings support the findings that fear of happiness may produce the tendency to hinder positive emo-

tions, satisfaction with life and withdraw from social relationships that are important components to both subjec-

tive well-being and psychological well-being (Joshanloo, 2013; Joshanloo & Weijers, 2014), while produce the

tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and stress (Gilbert et al., 2012). Stud-

ies showed that having positive emotions is a typical characteristic of resilient individuals to “bounce back” from

and find positive meaning in stressful situations quickly and effectively (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004). Experi-

encing positive emotions may be a factor that individual use to foster their psychological health by buffering the

negative impacts of fear of happiness.

Research  suggested  that  subjective  and  psychological  well-being  or  flourishing  are  conceptually  different  but

related with one another and therefore it is necessary to explore both subjective and psychological well-being to

fully understand well-being (Waterman, Schwartz, & Conti, 2008). In this study, therefore, we employed the in-

fluence of fear of happiness on both subjective well-being and flourishing via resilience. The emerging findings

are important in terms of theoretical contribution to the extant literature and practical implications to health serv-

ices. With regards to theoretical contribution, to the best of our knowledge, the present study provided the first

evidence examining the impact of resilience in the relationships between fear of happiness and satisfaction with

life, affect balance, and flourishing. This is meaningful to understand the mechanism underlying between fear of

happiness and subjective well-being and optimal human functioning. The findings would also facilitate the theo-

retical improvement of the mechanism among fear of happiness, resilience and well-being. Concerning practi-

cal  implication,  because  resilience  was  found  to  be  a  significant  mediator  in  the  relationship  between  fear  of

happiness and subjective well-being and flourishing, interventions aiming to enhance resilience may be useful

in increasing positive affect, life satisfaction and flourishing and decreasing negative affect and fear of happi-

ness.

There are several limitations of the current study that need to be acknowledged when the results are interpre-

ted.  The  foremost  limitation  is  that,  the  study  was  cross-sectional  in  nature  limiting  findings  to  draw  a  causal

and definitive conclusion on the resulting relations among the variables. To achieve causal valid explanation of

the  results,  assessment  of  the  independent  variable  must  be  performed  in  advance  of  the  mediator  variable,

and that assessment of the mediator variable must be performed in advance of the dependent variable (Jose,

2013). Hence, interpretation of the findings should be made cautiously. Studies employing prospective and lon-

gitudinal designs are needed to identify the causal links and provide evidence for the dynamic influence of fear

of happiness on subjective well-being, and flourishing through resilience. Second, the study participants were

predominantly male, married, university graduate, and having medium economic status. The findings may vary

in  populations  with  other  demographic  characteristics.  Further  research  should  investigate  whether  the  ob-

tained results can be replicated in other populations to enhance the generalizability of the findings. Third, a con-

venient sampling method was used to collect the data. Using a random sampling method where all participants

have  equal  chance  to  participate  the  study  would  help  to  determine  the  effect  of  factors  that  may  have  been

associated with the current sample (e.g. high rate of education level), that led to occurrence of the present find-

ings.

In summary, the present findings indicated the importance of resilience in the relation between fear of happi-

ness and satisfaction with life, affect balance, and flourishing. The results suggested that fear of happiness is

associated with lower satisfaction with life, affect balance and flourishing as a result of lower resilience.
