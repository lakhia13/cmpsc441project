ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND: The legacies of colonization and of policies of forced assimilation continue to be a cause 
of intergenerational trauma, manifested through feelings of marginality, depression, anxiety and confu-
sion, which place indigenous peoples at increased risk of suicide.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the quality, content, delivery and effectiveness of interventions for preventing sui-
cides among indigenous adolescents.
DESIGN  AND  SETTING:  Systematic  review  conducted  with  Cochrane  methodology,  Campo  Grande, 
Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.
METHODS:  The  Cochrane  library,  MEDLINE,  EMBASE,  CINAHL,  LILACS  and  PsycINFO  databases  were 
searched for studies published up to February 2021. The following inclusion criteria were used: published 
in any language; interventions that aimed to prevent suicides among indigenous adolescents; random-
ized or non-randomized study with a control or comparative group; and validated measurements of men-
tal health problems.
RESULTS: Two studies were identified: one on adolescents in the remote Yup’ik community in south-west-
ern Alaska, and the other on Zuni adolescents in New Mexico. Both studies showed evidence of effective-
ness in interventions for reducing some of the risk factors and increasing some of the protective factors 
associated with suicide. High levels of community engagement and culture-centeredness were key an-
chors of both studies, which ensured that the intervention content, delivery and outcome measurements 
aligned with the beliefs and practices of the communities. Both studies were judged to have a moderate 
risk of bias, with biases in sample selection, attrition and inadequate reporting of results.
CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence base is small but signaled the value of culturally appropriate inter-
ventions for prevention of suicide among indigenous adolescents.
REGISTRATION DETAILS: The study protocol is registered in the international prospective register of sys-
tematic reviews (PROSPERO); no. CRD42019141754.

INTRODUCTION

There are more than 476 million indigenous people in 5,000 cultures living in 90 countries world-

wide. Despite composing 5% of the global population, they account for 15% of the extremely 
poor  population.1  A  comprehensive  review  of  28  indigenous  and  tribal  peoples’  health  in  23 
countries published in 2016 gave nuanced insights into the heterogeneity of their health and 

wellbeing. There was evidence of poorer health and social outcomes for many indigenous popu-
lations, compared with their benchmark populations.2 

A gap of more than five years in life expectancy at birth (i.e. lower in indigenous than 

in non-indigenous populations in the same country) was recorded for indigenous populations in 

Australia, Cameroon, Canada (First Nation and Inuit), Greenland, Kenya, New Zealand and 

Panama. Infant mortality rates among indigenous infants were more than twice those observed 

for non-indigenous or national populations in Brazil, Colombia, Greenland, Peru, Russia and 

Venezuela. Poverty and poor education levels, employment status and access to healthcare ser-

vices are all important contributors to health disparities. 

Despite representing a rich diversity of cultures, indigenous peoples continue to be among 

the world’s most disadvantaged groups, regardless of whether they live in high-income coun-

tries (e.g. the Inuit in Canada) or lower-middle income countries (e.g. the Baka in Cameroon). 
The legacies of colonization and of policies of forced assimilation continue to be a cause of

Only two reviews of indigenous suicide prevention programs 

Youth suicide is the second leading cause of mortality among 
individuals aged 15-29 years5 and it disproportionately affects indig-
enous youth.6,7 Indigenous children (5-17 years old) in Australia 
die from suicide at five times the rate of their non-indigenous peers 

have been published so far, which only captured studies published up 
to 2012.9,10 In the first review, Clifford, Doran and Tsey10 reported on 
nine programs: two among Aboriginal Australians and seven among 

Native Americans. These programs targeted all ages, and there was a

years is more than twice that of non-Maori peers (40.7 per 100,000

the rate among Inuit youth is 11 times that of non-indigenous

study evaluated outcomes using a comparator group. In the second 
review, Harlow and Clough9 reported on nine programs targeting 
youths; five targeted Native Americans; three targeted Aboriginal 

Australians; and one targeted First Nation Canadians. As in the pre-

vious review, poor evaluation designs were noted. 

Most interpretations of this gap highlight the persistent social 

We therefore recognized that there was a general lack of meth-

and economic disadvantage experienced by indigenous youth rela-
tive to their non-indigenous peers.9 The epidemic of youth suicide 
is relatively recent in some cultures, with an increase over time, 
more so in the latter half of the 20th century. Men account for the 
majority of suicides, and the 15 to 24-year age group has the highest 
suicide rate of any age group.10,11 Furthermore, suicide among indig-
enous young people may be unreported due to misclassification.

Allen et al. conducted a randomized controlled study on adoles-

cents in the remote Yup’ik community in south-western Alaska, 
United States.23 Both studies used a group of indigenous adoles-
cents as controls and aimed to assess the effectiveness of suicide 

prevention programs among indigenous adolescents. The inter-

vention by LaFramboise et al. was based on Bandura’s cognitive 
social theory24 and used a wait-list control group to assess effec-
tiveness. Allen et al. used a community-based framework, deliv-

them regarding suicide prevention.23

Methodological quality assessment - Risk of bias for non-

Overall bias

Both studies were judged to have an overall moderate risk of bias 

due  to  the  following  factors.  Bias  due  to  confounding:  The  study 

by  LaFramboise  et  al.  was  classified  as  presenting  moderate  risk 

of  bias,  since  they  matched  students  before  the  intervention,  in 
order to reduce the bias from confounding, and used a wait-list.24 
The study by Allen et al.23 was classified as presenting low risk of 
bias, since the intervention was adapted to individual, family and 

suicidal behavior. The Zuni life skills curriculum was structured
