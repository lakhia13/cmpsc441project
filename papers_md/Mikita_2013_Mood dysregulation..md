Abstract The publication of the DSM-5 is nearing, yet a
debate continues about the boundaries of bipolar disorder
(BP) in children and adolescents. This article focuses on two
key components of this debate that are often treated under
the collective term mood dysregulation: the ﬁrst is chronic
irritability (and the proposed DSM-5 category of disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder) and the other concerns short
episodes of mania-like symptoms. We update our previous
review [Stringaris
in Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry
20(2):61–66, 2011] and also present relevant neurobiologi-
cal evidence. Most ﬁndings so far suggests that chronic,
severe irritability is not a developmental presentation of
mania. The diagnostic status of brief duration hypomania is
less clear, with some evidence in support of its clinical
relevance to BP. We end with recommendations for future
research to inform classiﬁcation and treatment.

increased dramatically, both in inpatient [2] and outpatient
services [3]. The increase in rates of BP diagnoses occurred
in parallel with a rise of prescription rates of antipsychotic
medication [4]. Diagnostic practice seemed to be the most
likely explanation for the observed increase in BP diag-
noses [5] and irritability seems to have been at the heart of
this problem. Based on the premise that mania may present
differently in youths than in adults, some researchers sug-
gested that chronic, non-episodic irritability is a core
characteristic of BP in young people (e.g. [6].). This is
inconsistent with the DSM-IV criteria for BP, which
specify the need for a ‘‘distinct period of abnormally and
persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood’’. More-
over, irritable mood is relatively less speciﬁc to BP in the
DSM-IV.

Overview on irritability and the bipolar debate

The motivation for research in irritability originates in the
so-called bipolar debate. Over the last 15 years, the rates of
BP diagnoses in children and adolescents in the USA have

Irritability, although not formally deﬁned in the DSM-IV,
is a mood symptom present in the criteria for a large
number of psychiatric disorders and refers to easy annoy-
ance and touchiness that can manifest in anger and temper
outbursts [1]. Depending on the stringency of threshold,
prevalence rates of irritability range from 3 % for severe,
chronic irritability strictly deﬁned in the Great Smoky
Mountain study [7] to 20 % in the Isle of Wight study [8].
In response to the bipolar controversy, Leibenluft et al. [9]
conceptualised chronic irritability as severe mood dysreg-
ulation (SMD), a category generated to allow for testable
comparisons with BP. SMD is characterised by chronic and
severe irritability with frequent and developmentally
inappropriate temper outbursts, along with negatively val-
enced mood in between outbursts.

Follow-up studies contradicted the notion that severe
irritability is an early manifestation of mania. Children with
SMD at
the age of 10 years suffered from unipolar
depression, but not BP at the age of 18 years [7]. Stringaris
et al. [10] reproduced this ﬁnding using a 20-year follow-up
study. However, these studies were of community samples
where the rates of BP are low. Therefore, not ﬁnding an
association between BP and chronic irritability may have
been due to the lack of statistical power. To address this,
Stringaris et al. [11] used a referred sample to compare the
course of children with SMD and those with BP over a
median period of 29 months. The authors found that only
one out of 84 (1.2 %) patients with SMD experienced a
manic episode over this time period. By contrast, 58 out of
93 (62.4 %) patients with BP had a manic episode over the
same time period. Again, such ﬁndings argue against the
notion that chronic irritability is a characteristic of BP. It
will be informative to follow children with SMD further as
they pass through the period of maximum risk for BP.

Consistent with these ﬁndings, SMD and BP were found
to differ in family history [12], with parents of youth with
narrow phenotype BP being signiﬁcantly more likely to be
diagnosed with BP (14/42, 33.3 %) than parents of youth
with SMD (1/37, 2.7 %).

Pathophysiological ﬁndings

Recently, research has compared whether severe irritability,
in the form of SMD, and BP overlap in their pathophysio-
logical mechanisms. SMD and BP youth were both found to
display deﬁcits in face emotion labelling. Both patient
groups were signiﬁcantly less accurate in labelling facial
emotions [13] and less sensitive in recognising facial
expressions of emotions [14], compared to healthy controls.
However, SMD and BP differ in the brain mechanisms
underlying these emotion labelling deﬁcits—a recent func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study showed
that patients with SMD had lower amygdala activity com-
pared to those with BP during a face emotion processing
task [15]. The pattern of amygdala activation in SMD
resembled that of young people with depression [16, 17].

Differences between SMD and BP youth have also been
identiﬁed in studies using the affective Posner task [18], an
attention task designed to elicit frustration. Rich et al. [19]
showed that although both SMD and BP youth displayed
signiﬁcantly more negative affect than healthy controls in
response to negative feedback, patients with SMD differed
from those with BP in their event-related potentials (ERPs)
[20] and brain activation patterns [19]. The pattern of ERPs
following frustration suggested executive attention deﬁcits
in the BP, but not SMD group, who were impaired in the
initial,
‘‘bottom-up’’ attention regardless of emotional
context. These ﬁndings are consistent with neuroimaging

123

data: in response to blocked goal attainment on the frus-
tration task, relative to SMD youth, BP youth displayed
greater activation in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) [19],
a region implicated in the regulation of executive attention
[21]. Coupled with neuroimaging techniques, frustration
tasks offer a promising way of disentangling SMD from
BP, by suggesting that the seemingly similar behavioural
manifestations of irritability may have different neural
substrates.

Related ﬁndings come from a series of studies using
response reversal paradigms, where participants have to
modify their responses to match the environmental chan-
ges. These are usually changes as to which stimulus is
rewarded and which one is not. Poor performance on these
tasks was suggested to lead to frustration [22]. Although
response reversal deﬁcits were more often found in young
people with BP (e.g. [23]), a recent study found that both
SMD and BP youth showed deﬁcits on response reversal
with compound stimuli [24]. Emerging data suggest that
SMD and BP youth may differ in the underlying patho-
physiology of response reversal deﬁcits, with SMD but not
BP youth showing reduced inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)
activation in response to errors on the task relative to
healthy controls [25]. Of note, the same study found both
SMD and BP youth to have reduced task-related caudate
activation compared to healthy controls.

Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that pathophysi-
ological mechanisms differ between SMD and BP youth;
however, they also show that there are shared pathways
between the two conditions. The next important step will
be to compare severe irritability with other childhood
psychopathology, such as attention deﬁcit hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD), and establish their distinguishing
neurobiological features. It will also be important to take a
dimensional view of irritability. New measures, such as the
Affective Reactivity Index (ARI) [26], could be useful in
studying the brain correlates of irritability intensity. This
will further help to understand the mechanisms of irrita-
bility and may be useful for diagnostic purposes.

An important clinical problem is irritability in young
people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). For good
reasons, a diagnosis of ASD was an excluding factor in
studies on mood dysregulation mentioned above, and
therefore irritability in ASD has been understudied.
Emerging evidence points on important differences
between how mood problems present in ASD compared to
typically developing youth. For example, in contrast to
studies of typically developing young people with SMD
[13, 24], similarly deﬁned severe mood problems in ASD
youth were not associated with deﬁcits in executive func-
tion or emotion recognition (except for identifying the
facial expression of surprise) [27]. Future research should
determine which aspects of ASD affect the presentation of

Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2013) 22 (Suppl 1):S11–S16

S13

mood problems in this clinical group. This may inform the
diagnosis and treatment of irritability not only in the ASD
population, but potentially also in typically developing
youth who display some autistic-like traits, such as rigidity
or social interaction difﬁculties.

Implications for assessment and clinical guidelines

The assessment of irritability has until recently lagged
behind other research in the ﬁeld. In most studies, irrita-
bility was measured using items from the oppositional
deﬁant disorder (ODD) section of interviews [28]. More
recently, a concise instrument to measure irritability, the
ARI has been developed and validated in clinical samples
[26]. SMD can be assessed using a specially developed
module [11] of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders
and Schizophrenia for School Age Children (K-SADS)
[29].

Treatment implications

In contrast to classical BP [30], chronic non-episodic irri-
tability lacks appropriate evidence-based treatments, lar-
gely due to its unclear diagnostic and aetiological status.
Extrapolating treatment options from classical BP to SMD,
relying on the premise that severe, chronic irritability
constitutes a developmental manifestation of BP, may be
harmful. For example, it is unclear whether atypical anti-
psychotics, such as risperidone, used in the treatment of
irritability in autism [31], would be a viable treatment
option for irritability in typically developing youth with
SMD. Lithium was already found to be ineffective in SMD
[32]. A trial of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor in children
with SMD is ongoing (Leibenluft, personal communica-
tion). Clinicians will of course want to treat other comorbid
disorders, particularly ADHD, in children presenting with
severe irritability. Treatment with methylphenidate was
found to reduce symptoms of oppositionality in children
[33], and in our practice and according to anecdotal evi-
dence, it also seems to reduce irritability in those with
ADHD. In our experience, cognitive-behavioural therapy
(CBT) appears to be a well-tolerated and often effective
treatment for children with irritability [34]; however, no
trial data are yet available about the effects of psycholog-
ical therapy on children’s irritability.

Short-lived episodes of mania-like symptoms

Overview

The second important issue when comparing adult and
paediatric BP concerns the duration criteria for mania in

DSM-IV in youth. Adults meet DSM-IV criteria for mania
if symptoms have been present for at least 7 days and for
hypomania if symptoms have been present for 4 days. In
adults, shorter episodes (1–3 days) of hypomanic symp-
toms are thought to be manifestations of bipolar spectrum;
individuals with such shorter episodes do not seem to differ
from those with episodes of typical duration ([4 days) on a
range of clinical validators [35]. A question has been raised
whether duration criteria of 4–7 days are too stringent for
youth and whether a BP diagnosis should be made in those
with more brief duration hypomania.

Brief duration hypomania and bipolar disorder

Young people who meet
the DSM-IV symptom and
impairment criteria, but present with symptoms of mania
for less than 4 days, frequently receive the diagnosis of
bipolar disorder-not otherwise speciﬁed (BP-NOS). Cases
of children with BP-NOS are indistinguishable from those
with classical BP in age of onset, duration, severity,
comorbidity, family history and the presence of suicidal
ideation and major depression, according to the ﬁndings of
the course and outcome in bipolar youth (COBY) study
[36]. Approximately 25 % of BP-NOS youth developed
BP-I or BP-II at a 2-year follow-up period [37] and 38 %
reached this diagnosis over 4-year follow-up [38]. How-
ever, it is unclear which cases of BP-NOS were most
similar to classical BP, because the authors did not dis-
tinguish between cases with very short (less than 1 day)
episodes and cases with episodes closer to the DSM-IV
duration limit of 4 days.

In a community sample, BP-NOS remained associated
with functional impairment after adjusting for the effect of
other psychopathology [39]. These ﬁndings and the rarity
of classical BP in youth (0.1 % compared to 1.1 % in a
community sample [39]) suggest that short-lived episodes
of mania may be a developmental presentation of BP.
However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with the ﬁnding
that prevalence and duration of BP-NOS were not moder-
ated by participants’ age [39]. Furthermore,
lack of
agreement between child- and parent-reported episodes in
this sample raises doubt over the validity of combining
information about youth BP symptomatology across
informants.

Implications for assessment and clinical guidelines

There are no ofﬁcial guidelines about short-lived episodes
of mania-like symptoms in youth. Clinicians can ascertain
shorter duration episodes of mania as part of their usual
interview for BP. A module of the K-SADS has been
developed and used in the COBY studies that ascertains
short episodes [40]. A section of the Development and

123

S14

Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2013) 22 (Suppl 1):S11–S16

Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA) [41] has also been used
to study short-episode durations in epidemiological studies.

Treatment implications

No evidence-based treatments have yet been developed for
brief episodes of mania-like symptoms in youth. In addi-
tion, because the relationship of such episodes to classical
mania remains unclear, extrapolating evidence from what
is known about BP may be problematic. It is possible that
very short episodes of mania-like symptoms may in fact
reﬂect exacerbations of underlying chronic externalising
disorders, such as ADHD or ODD [42], which would call
for a different treatment. The two presentations may be
potentially difﬁcult to differentiate for young people and
their parents who undergo diagnostic interviews. Clinicians
will be more likely to treat children with mania-like
symptoms using antipsychotic or mood stabilising medi-
cation if their episodes last for at least 2–3 days and lead to
impairment. By contrast, the use of antipsychotic medica-
tion in children with very short-lived (less than 1 day)
episodes should be treated with great caution.

Implications for nosology and outstanding questions

Chronic irritability

The distinction between severe, non-episodic irritability
and classical BP has important implications for diagnosis.
In response to concerns about a possible over-diagnosis of
BP in youth,
the DSM-5 Task Force proposed a new
diagnostic category of disruptive mood dysregulation dis-
order (DMDD) [43]. The criteria for DMDD resemble
those for SMD [9], although DMDD does not include
symptoms of hyperarousal.

The DSM-5 proposal met with some criticism con-
cerning DMDD’s speciﬁcity. Axelson et al. [44] pointed
out that irritability is a symptom present in a number of
disorders within the DSM-IV, such as major depressive
disorder
(GAD),
(MDD), generalised anxiety disorder
ODD and ADHD which would imply that DMDD irrita-
bility may not be speciﬁc. However, this is not a sufﬁcient
argument against the category of DMDD. Inattention and
concentration difﬁculties also occur as part of the criteria of
different psychiatric disorders, but inattention is still use-
fully distinguished within ADHD. Moreover, the occur-
rence of irritability as part of the criteria of several
different psychiatric disorders may be a mistake of previ-
ous classiﬁcations and should not be treated as a given. It is
an empirical question whether several of the current diag-
noses that feature irritability in their criteria could stand
without it.

123

the presence of clinically relevant

It has also been suggested to use irritability as a course
speciﬁer for other psychiatric disorders, for example ODD,
instead of introducing DMDD. Even in such a case, clini-
cians would still have to make a categorical judgement
about
irritability, a
process not much different from deciding whether DMDD
is present or not. Moreover, introducing a speciﬁer would
not provide a diagnostic home for those children who
suffer from irritability, but have no other diagnosable
psychiatric disorder. An alternative solution would be to
treat irritability as a dimension, rather than a category.
Clinicians would determine where their patients lay on a
spectrum of irritability severity in the same way that
internists determine the levels of hypertension in their
patients. This is an attractive model and new measures
exist [26] that could be useful in this process. However,
there are obvious difﬁculties. Clinicians will
require
thresholds to help them make binary (‘‘treat or not treat’’)
decisions and clearly more research is required to establish

dimensions that cut across psychopathology would need to

irritability cut-offs. Also,

Whether to include DMDD as a separate category in the
DSM-5 is a complex issue,
inevitably linked to more
general questions about how best to classify disease [45].
Including DMDD could lead to errors of commission (such
as those discussed above); however, not addressing irrita-
bility in the new classiﬁcation would be to continue with an
error of omission. The bipolar controversy has taught us
that ignoring children’s irritable mood comes at a cost to
public health. Any classiﬁcatory scheme should at least
allow clinicians to record irritability and make it possible
to investigate this common mood problem in develop-
mental psychopathology.

Short-lived episodes of mania-like symptoms

There is a proposal in the DSM-5 to capture episodes with
mania-like symptoms of 2–3 days duration under BP-Not
Elsewhere Classiﬁed (BP-NEC) [46]. Empirical evidence
suggests that, at least in youth, such change could have
profound implications for the prevalence of mania [39].
Some evidence suggests that at least some children with
short-lived episodes of mania-like symptoms may be on a
continuum of bipolarity [38], which seems to be consistent
with ﬁndings in adults [35]. However, the main challenge
will be to establish the characteristics of those who are most
likely to fall within this bipolarity spectrum and who might
beneﬁt from early treatment. What mechanisms determine
whether some patients predominantly present with short-
lived episodes of mania-like symptoms, while others display
full-blown manic episodes? What mediates the transition

Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2013) 22 (Suppl 1):S11–S16

S15

from short-lived to longer-lasting episodes? Are personal
characteristics such as genetic load and comorbid psycho-
pathology important, and what is the contribution of envi-
ronmental (e.g. occupational or other life-style) factors?

Conclusions

Despite considerable progress in understanding irritability
and short-lived episodes of mania-like symptoms in chil-
dren, a lot more needs to be done. It would be wrong for
nosology to rush ahead of the evidence; equally, the DSM-5
cannot remain blind to the deﬁcits of the current classiﬁca-
tion. The DSM-5 should provide the conditions for both
irritability and short-lived episodes of mania-like symptoms
to enter clinicians’ awareness and to become a topic of
ongoing clinical research.
