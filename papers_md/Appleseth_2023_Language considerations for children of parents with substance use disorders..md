Abstract
Parents with substance use disorders are highly stigmatized by multiple systems (e.g., healthcare, education, 
legal, social). As a result, they are more likely to experience discrimination and health inequities [1, 2]. Children of 
parents with substance use disorders often do not fare any better, as they frequently experience stigma and poorer 
outcomes by association [3, 4]. Calls to action for person-centered language for alcohol and other drug problems 
have led to improved terminology [5–8]. Despite a long history of stigmatizing, offensive labels such as “children 
of alcoholics” and “crack babies,” children have been left out of person-centered language initiatives. Children of 
parents with substance use disorders can feel invisible, shameful, isolated, and forgotten—particularly in treatment 
settings when programming is centered on the parent [9, 10]. Person-centered language is shown to improve 
treatment outcomes and reduce stigma [11, 12]. Therefore, we need to adhere to consistent, non-stigmatizing 
terminology when referencing children of parents with substance use disorders. Most importantly, we must center 
the voices and preferences of those with lived experience to enact meaningful change and effective resource 
allocation.

In recent years, there have been many campaigns to use 
person-centered  language  to  reduce  impacts  associated 
with  stigmatizing  language  among  individuals  with  sub-
stance use disorders [5, 6, 13]. The goal of these initiatives 
is  to  ensure  that  identity  is  centered  on  the  individual 
rather than the disease. Indeed, both the National Insti-

tute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Institute on 
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) have launched 
campaigns  to  center  language  on  individuals  and  not 
diagnoses of use disorders (e.g., “words matter” [14], and 
NIAAA  social  media  posts).  NIAAA  offered  guidelines 
for applying person-first language when referencing indi-
viduals with alcohol use disorder (AUD), which included: 
(1)  describe  an  individual  as  “a  person  with  alcohol  use 
disorder” rather than “alcoholic,” and (2) describe an indi-
vidual as “a person in recovery from alcohol use disorder” 
instead of “recovering alcoholic.” However, neither NIDA 
nor NIAAA provided guidelines on person-centered lan-
guage for children of parents with substance use disorders.
Children of parents with substance use disorders have 
been  excluded  from  considerations  of  stigmatizing  lan-
guage —particularly children of parents with AUDs [15]. 
Children  of  parents  with  AUDs  have  historically  been

referred to as “children of alcoholics (COA),” “adult chil-
dren  of  alcoholics  (ACOA),”  or  “children  of  substance 
abusing parents” [16, 17]. All of which perpetuate stigma 
towards  both  the  parent  and  child  [18].  Indeed,  these 
terms continue to be used even after the inclusion of per-
son-centered  language  guidelines  in  the  10th  edition  of 
the AMA’s manual of style in 2010. In a recent PubMed 
search,  there  were  117  publications  using  the  terms 
(“children  of  alcoholics”)  OR  (“alcoholic  parents”)  OR 
(“substance abusing parents”) between 2011 and 2022.

The  stigmatization  of  children  of  parents  with  sub-
stance  use  disorders  (particularly  AUD)  has  deep  roots, 
some  of  which  can  be  traced  back  to  the  family  disease 
model  [19].  Addiction  has  been  described  as  a  “family 
disease”  wherein  all  family  members  share  an  addiction 
and  have  their  own  interacting  illness  [20].  Briefly,  the 
family disease model proposed that family members are 
“no  longer  innocent  victims”  because  they  may  be  act-
ing  as  “etiological  agents  or  as  complicating  the  illness,” 
[21]. Many problematic terms arose from this movement 
such  as  alcoholic  families,  codependency,  and  children 
of alcoholics [22–24]. Further, US national organizations 
that were created to provide resources to children of par-
ents with SUD also still hold stigmatizing names such as 
“the National Association for Children of Addiction” and 
“Adult  Children  of  Alcoholics  and  Dysfunctional  Fami-
lies.”  The  lack  of  proposed  changes  to  this  language  has 
resulted  in  a  mixture  of  terms  being  used  to  describe 
children  with  a  parent  or  caregiver  with  SUD,  many  of 
which are stigmatizing and dated.

Children  of  parents  with  SUD  often  experience  self-
discrimination and disclosure stigma, as well as prejudice 
from peers, teachers, media sources, and other adults [18, 
25].  Dated  linguistic  choices  for  describing  those  with 
substance  use  disorders  (e.g.,  addict,  junkie,  alcoholic, 
etc.)  contribute  to  increased  stigma,  barriers  to  health-
care,  and  poorer  treatment  outcomes  in  affected  indi-
viduals [26]. Higher levels of social stigma (toward opioid 
use disorder) has been associated with lower support for 
public health-oriented policies and increased support for 
punitive policies [27]. Conversely, the use of person-cen-
tered language decreases stigma and improves treatment 
outcomes  for  individuals  with  substance  use  disorders 
[26].  Therefore,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  use 
of  person-centered  language  would  likely  reduce  stigma 
and improve outcomes for children of parents with SUD. 
Acknowledging  that  linguistic  practices  influence  health 
outcomes  and  resource  allocation,  a  simple  first  step  is 
changing the way in which we refer to children of parents 
with SUD.

Clinical  and  empirical  efforts  specifically  focused  on 
the  needs  and  protection  of  children  of  parents  with 
SUD  are  long  overdue.  The  lack  of  uniformity  and  ini-
tiative  in  changing  our  language  likely  contributes  to 

stigma,  shame,  and  exacerbated  relational  tensions  in 
these  individuals.  Children  of  parents  with  SUD  often 
have  strained  parental  relationships,  and  these  parental 
relationships  may  occupy  much  of  the  child’s  emotional 
and  cognitive  bandwidth  [10].  They  often  experience 
ambivalence toward their parents, feeling both loved and 
betrayed  [28].  Untreated  ambivalence  toward  parents 
can  contribute  to  children  experiencing  poorer  psycho-
logical and physical health as adults [29]. Unfortunately, 
many  do  not  receive  professional  support  to  help  them 
make  sense  of  their  emotions,  situation,  and  stressors 
[10].  If  children  of  parents  with  SUD  do  receive  profes-
sional  intervention,  it  is  often  focused  on  their  parent’s 
needs and recovery, rather than the child’s unique experi-
ences  and  needs. Therefore,  language  considerations  for 
children of parents with SUD can improve behavioral and 
health outcomes directly through access to services.

Finally, and most importantly, we must center the pref-
erences  of  the  children  and  family  members  of  primary 
caregivers  with  substance  use  disorders  .  As  Ziss  notes 
in her commentary about person-centered language, we 
should not correct the way someone chooses to describe 
themselves  [30].  Further,  we  must  acknowledge  that 
many individuals with substance use disorders and their 
families do not receive treatment or support resources—
which  can  worsen  the  associated  emotional  and  eco-
nomic burden, increase relationship dissatisfaction,  and 
heighten familial instability [31]. These lived experiences 
may result in family members finding difficulty in devel-
oping  a  neutral  or  positive  view  of  themselves  or  their 
loved  ones,  which  may  affect  how  they  label  themselves 
or  parents  [30].  Nonetheless,  it  is  the  responsibility  of 
scientific journals, healthcare providers, research investi-
gators, and media outlets to monitor and enforce profes-
sional standards of person-centered language. As a call to 
action, we suggest that children of parents, or caregivers, 
with SUD be referred to utilizing the following terms:
  • Children of parents with substance use disorders 

(CPSUD).

  • Children of caregivers with substance use disorders 

(CCSUD).

  • Perceived caregiver substance misuse (PCSM).

We  strongly  recommend  that  researchers,  healthcare 
providers, clinicians, faculty, and staff in higher education 
and health institutions adopt standards, implement train-
ings,  and  encourage  the  use  person-centered  language. 
Health professionals, healthcare workers, and faculty, for 
example,  should  use  specific  health-based  terminology 
for symptoms and diagnoses of SUD, and learn and teach 
appropriate  communication  styles  among  families  with 
such issues. While many substance-use-focused journals 
have  added  requirements  for  the  use  person-centered 
language  guidelines  within  the  instructions  for  authors, 
there  is  a  need  for  specific  adherence  for  journals  that 

Appleseth et al. Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy           (2023) 18:28 publish  articles  focused  on  pediatric  populations—as 
well  as  public  health,  and  preventive  and  family  medi-
cine  journals.  A  previous  study  showed  that  a  journal’s 
inclusion of its own person-centered guidelines was asso-
ciated  with  lower  rates  of  stigmatizing  language  regard-
ing childhood obesity [32]. While our recommendations 
focus on the health and scientific communities, through 
translation this may effectively reach a broader audience, 
including  media  dissemination  of  clinical  research  and 
findings.  Furthermore,  editors,  authors,  and  reviewers 
of papers need to pay attention to language. As medical 
researchers and healthcare professionals, it should be our 
goal  to  advocate  for  and  amplify  the  voices  and  prefer-
ences of those with lived experiences—especially regard-
ing children.
