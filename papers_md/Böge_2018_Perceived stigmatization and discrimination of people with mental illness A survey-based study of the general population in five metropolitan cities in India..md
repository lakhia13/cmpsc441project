ABSTRACT

Background:  India  faces  a  significant  gap  between  the  prevalence  of  mental  illness  among  the  population  and  the 
availability and effectiveness of mental health care in providing adequate treatment. This discrepancy results in structural 
stigma toward mental illness which in turn is one of the main reasons for a persistence of the treatment gap, whereas societal 
factors such as religion, education, and family structures play critical roles. This survey-based study investigates perceived 
stigma toward mental illness in five metropolitan cities in India and explores the roles of relevant sociodemographic factors. 
Materials  and  Methods:  Samples  were  collected  in  five  metropolitan  cities  in  India  including  Chennai  (n  =  166), 
Kolkata (n = 158), Hyderabad (n = 139), Lucknow (n = 183), and Mumbai (n = 278). Stratified quota sampling was 
used to match the general population concerning age, gender, and religion. Further, sociodemographic variables such as 
educational attainment and strength of religious beliefs were included in the statistical analysis. 
Results:  Participants  displayed  overall  high  levels  of  perceived  stigma.  Multiple  linear  regression  analysis  found  a 
significant effect of gender (P < 0.01), with female participants showing higher levels of perceived stigma compared to 
male counterparts. 
Conclusion: Gender differences in cultural and societal roles and expectations could account for higher levels of perceived 
stigma among female participants. A higher level of perceived stigma among female participants is attributed to cultural 
norms and female roles within a family or broader social system. This study underlines that while India as a country in 
transition, societal and gender rules still impact perceived stigma and discrimination of people with mental illness.

Key words: India, mental health, perceived discrimination, perceived stigmatization, South Asia, urban

INTRODUCTION

Stigma and perceived stigma of mental illnesses
An  extensive  body  of  literature  discusses  a  relationship 
between sociocultural norm, gender, and roles with stigma 
and  discrimination  toward  people  with  mental  illness.[1-6] 
Current  definitions  emphasize  that  stigma  is  related  to  a 
display of disgrace and shame, which usually elicits negative 
attitudes  toward  its  bearers.[1,5,7-9]  Attaching  stigma  to 
mental  illness  originates  among  other  factors  from  a  lack 
of  mental  health  literacy  and  insufficient  public  display 
of  positive  treatment  outcomes,  which  both  reinforce 
stigmatization and perceived discrimination by the public.[7] 
At its core, the concept of stigma essentially incorporates 
three  main  elements,  namely  prejudicial  attitudes, 
insufficient  knowledge,  and  discriminatory  behavior.[7,9] 
The  attached  stigma  on  individuals  affected  by  mental 
disorders often makes them prone to severe consequences 
such  as  significant  loss  of  self-esteem,  self-stigmatization, 
reduced  job  opportunities,  and  social  exclusion.[1,2,10-12] 
Social  withdrawal  either  due  to  a  loss  of  self-esteem  or 
self-stigmatization often constitutes a substantial obstacle 
to  the  early  detection  and  adequate  treatment  of  mental 
illness,  thus  reinforcing  a  vicious  circle  of  stress  and 
reduced  social  functioning  for  the  individual.[8]  In  that 
context, self-stigma and a closely related perceived stigma 
of persons with mental health problems are conceptualized 
as  an 
internalization  of  sociocultural  dimensions  of 
discriminatory experiences by the mentally ill that negatively 
affect self-perception and active coping behavior.[26] Another 
essential  factor  of  perceived  stigma  is  the  experience  of 
anticipated  discrimination,  the  expression  of  expected 
societal  rejection,  from  which  individuals  with  mental 
illness suffer, further leading to loss of self-esteem, social 
withdrawal,  demoralization,  a  decrease  in  help-seeking 
behavior,  and  lower  quality  of  life[1,9,13]  as  well  as  secrecy 
about mental illness.[14,15]

Mental illness in India
Modern  India  is  a  country  characterized  by  a  rapid 
growth  in  population  as  well  as  the  transition  from 
low-income  country  to  a  middle-income  country 
a 
regarding 
its  sociodemographic  and  epidemiological 
dimensions.[16] However, in India, a nation with more than 
1.3 billion citizens, statistics regarding the exact prevalence 
of individuals with mental illness remain insufficient. Recent 
prevalence estimates range from 5.8% to 7.3% of the total 
population,[17] or in numbers to around 150 million people 
in  India  affected  by  mental  illness.[16]  These  prevalence 
rates  and  low  numbers  of  approximately  0.3  psychiatrists 
per  100,000  inhabitants  compared  to  the  global  figure  of 
1.2/100,000[17] reveal an enormous challenge for the mental 
health-care  system  in  India.  Moreover,  the  availability 
of  psychologists,  social  workers,  and  psychiatric  nurses 
remains  equally  low  and  is  too  often  restricted  to  urban 
areas.[17] One of the central barriers to adequate treatment 

of mental illness in India is a lack of funding[14,18,19] leading 
to  ineffective  help-seeking  behavior  and  often  poorer 
treatment  outcomes,  both  associated  with  stigma  toward 
mentally ill patients and their caregivers.[14,20] Governmental 
health  and  social  priorities  coined  by  the  transition[16] 
result in low-spending priorities toward mental health care 
which  intensifies  societal  and  structural  stigma  toward 
mental illness. A study in 2010[18] mapped the mental health 
spending in several low-middle income countries and found 
that  in  the  Indian  state  of  Kerala  only  2%  of  the  national 
health budget was allocated to mental health care. To some 
degree, similar patterns of national financial priorities can 
be observed in other low-[48,49] and middle-income countries, 
and  even  in  high-income  countries  such  as  Germany.[21,22] 
However, stigma toward individuals who have mental illness 
in  Asian  countries  is  often  disproportionally  higher  than 
that in Western countries.[20,48] In South and Southeast Asian 
nations, especially in India, prejudice of mentally ill people 
being  dangerous  and  aggressive[20,23]  adjunct  with  factors 
such  as  religion  and  lower  education[24]  result  in  a  higher 
public desire for social distance to affected individuals. In 
addition to that, the substantial lack of adequate health-care 
providers  coupled  with  a  personal  burden  and  the  lack 
of  awareness  within  the  population  ultimately  leads  to  a 
deficient quality of mental health care.[16,48]

Aim of the study
The primary purpose of the current study is to analyze the 
perception of mental illness in India. By investigating how 
specific sociodemographic factors affect the perception of 
mental illness within the Indian population and how they are 
related to perceived discrimination and stigmatization, the 
study draws a conclusion regarding the provision of mental 
health care in a rapidly transitioning and culturally diverse 
country.  Since  India  is  a  vast  country  containing  different 
cultural, societal, religious, and linguistic populations and 
norms,[25]  this  study  focuses  on  five  major  metropolitan 
cities,  namely  Mumbai,  Chennai,  Hyderabad,  Kolkata,  and 
Lucknow, representing different major urban regions of the 
country.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants
A  protocol-based  data  collection  process  was  carried  out 
with the assistance of a market research firm, Panoramix™, 
after personal training of the interviewer with the researcher 
and second author AZ in India. The assistance of the market 
research  company  with  a  large  and  reliable  database  of 
possible  respondents  ensured  an  accurate  and  consistent 
completion  of  the  questionnaires  resulting  in  a  very  high 
completion  rate  and  informed  consent  of  all  participants. 
Although  the  interviews  consisted  of  individuals  who 
voluntarily registered within the market and social research 
firm, resulting in a convenience sample, we used prior quota 
sampling in all cities for gender, age, and religion according

determined  as  participants  who  were  willing  and  agreed 
to be contacted by the research firm and further filled out 
the  informed  consent.  Exclusion  criteria  were  defined  by 
people who did not want to be contacted or did not match 
the  predefined  parameters,  according  to  the  database  of 
the  research  partner.  Further,  the  data  collection  did  not 
involve  a  probability-based  selection  method.  Participants 
were balanced recruited from five major cities representing 
different  regions  in  India,  urban  areas  where  Panoramix™ 
registered 
commonly  conduct  public  surveys  with 
individuals.  These  metropolitan  areas  include  Mumbai 
(n = 297), Chennai (n = 151), Lucknow (n = 184), Kolkata 
(n = 149), and Hyderabad (n = 139). Recruited participants’ 
age ranged between 18 and 65 years.

Table 1 presents the detailed demographic characteristics of 
the sample in comparison with the Indian census of 2011.[25]

Questionnaire
The  interview  included  questions  to  assess  respondents’ 
perceived  stigma  toward  people  with  mental  illness  in 
social situations using Link’s Perceived Discrimination and 
Devaluation Scale (PDDS).[26] Since the questionnaire was first 
conceived in the context of Western societies, the wording 
was adapted in some cases for better understanding in the 
cultural  and  linguistic  context  of  the  local  populations.[27] 
These  cases  included  religious,  spiritual,  and  educational 
settings.  The  questionnaire  took  10–15  min  to  complete. 
Furthermore,  relevant  sociodemographic  information  was 
gathered to assess influential factors such as gender, age, 
religion, the strength of religious devotion, and educational 
attainment.

There  was  no  potential  conflict  of  interest  regarding 
any  of  the  authors  in  relation  to  the  market  research 
firm.  The  study  design  using  the  Link’s  PDDS  among 
other  measures  has  been  applied  in  high-,  middle-,  and 
low-income  countries  including  Germany  and  Vietnam 
for  use  in  the  healthy  population  nonpatient  groups  and 
has  been  approved  for  Berlin,  by  the  ethics  committee 
of  the  Department  of  Psychology,  Humboldt  University 
Berlin, Germany, the Military Academy of Medicine Hanoi, 
Vietnam,[48,49]  and  recently  by  the  Asian  Institute  of  Public 
Health, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, for assessing public attitudes 
in rural settings in India. Respondents did not receive any 
financial compensation.

Translation procedure
The  original  questionnaires  were  translated  from  English 
into the respective local languages using a back-translation 
method.[28]  Furthermore,  upon  informed  consent  of  the 
participants,  structured  interviews  were  administrated 
by  psychologists  who  have  undergone  a  specific  training 
beforehand  which 
is  a  standard  methodology  when 
recruiting greater sample sizes.

Perceived stigma
Perceived  stigma  was  assessed  through  the  use  of  the 
PDDS[26]  for  which  respondents  had  to  indicate  their  view 
regarding most Indian’s attitudes toward former psychiatric 
patients.  The  degree  of  agreement  with  a  statement 
was  assessed  using  a  5-point  Likert  scale  ranging  from 
“definitely true” (1) to “definitely not true” (5). Lower scores 
correspond to lower levels of perceived stigma, while higher 
scores correspond to higher levels of perceived stigma. The 
scale consisted of 12 items covering participants’ attitudes 
toward a variety of topics such as intelligence, relationships, 
and work issues of persons with mental illness.

Statistical analysis
Statistical  analysis  was  performed  using  the  IBM  program 
SPSS Statistics for Mac OS X Version 21.0 (IBM, USA). The 
first step involved reversing six of the twelve items. A mean 
score was calculated for all the 12 items of the scale. Next, 
a sum score (SS) was calculated for participants’ responses 
and the total was divided by 12 resulting in a range from

Böge, et al.: Perceived stigma of mental illness in India1 to 5 representing perceived stigma for each participant. 
A multiple linear regression was conducted using the mean 
score  as  the  dependent  variable  and  sociodemographic 
variables  such  as  gender,  age,  marital  status,  education 
attainment,  the  strength  of  religious  beliefs,  and  religion 
as independent variables. Cronbach’s alpha ( = 0.48) was 
calculated to determine the reliability of the questionnaire 
used.

RESULTS

Table 2 displays single-item responses on the PDDS. In the 
following six out of twelve statements, participants’ answer 
properties  present  strong  negative  views  toward  people 
with mental illness: most people would consider a mental 
hospital stay as a sign of personal failure (5), most people 
would not hire a former mentally ill patient to take care of 
their children (6), most people would think less of a person 

who has been in a mental hospital (7), most employers will 
pass  over  the  application  of  a  former  mental  patient  in 
favor  of  another  applicant  (9),  most  young  women  would 
be reluctant to date a man who had been hospitalized for 
a severe mental disorder (11), and finally that most people 
would take the opinion of a person they know less seriously 
if they had been to a mental hospital as a patient (12).

The results of the multiple linear regression are presented in 
Table 3. It displays the influence of each sociodemographic 
variable  including  gender,  age,  educational  attainment, 
religion,  and  strength  of  religious  belief  on  the  level  of 
perceived  stigma,  which  is  represented  by  a  mean  score. 
No  significant  effect  of  age,  marital  status,  educational 
attainment,  the  strength  of  religious  beliefs,  or  religion 
was detected. However, a significant effect for gender was 
found  (B  =  0.083,  ß  =  0.031,  P  =  0.008).  Furthermore, 
results show that female participants reported higher levels 
of  perceived  stigma  (SS  =  3.12)  compared  to  their  male 
counterparts (SS = 3.03).

has been in a mental hospital is just as 
intelligent as the average person

3 Most people believe that a former mental 
patient is just as trustworthy as the

4 Most people would accept a fully 

recovered former mental patient as a 
teacher of young children in a public 
school

5 Most people feel that entering a mental 
hospital is a sign of personal failure

mental patient to take care of their 
children, even if he or she had been well 
for some time

7 Most people think less of a person who 

has been in a mental hospital

mental patient if he or she is qualified 
for the job

9 Most employers will pass over the 

application of a former mental patient in 
favor of another applicant

10 Most people in my community would 

treat a former mental patient just as they 
would treat anyone

11 Most young women would be reluctant 
to date a man who has been hospitalized 
for a serious mental disorder

The  present  study  examined  the  association  between 
perceived  stigma  toward  mental  illness  and  relevant 
sociodemographic  factors  of  the  respondents  including 
religion,  and 
gender,  age,  educational  attainment, 
strength of religious beliefs. In line with a recent research 
about  stigma  toward  mental  illness  in  India  and  other 
developing Asian countries,[23,25,29] the current study found 
an overall high mean score for Link’s PDDS. To weigh these 
rather  high  scores  in  the  PDDS  and  ensure  cross-cultural 
comparability,  a  comparison  with  Western  countries  is 
warranted.  In  2014,  a  study  using  the  PDDS  in  Germany 
reported  largely  diverging  participant  responses.[1]  For 
instance,  while  in  Germany,  only  47%  of  respondents[1] 
endorsed  that  most  people  would  think  less  of  a  person 
who  had  been  in  a  mental  hospital,  the  same  assumption 
found  58%  approval  in  our  Indian  sample;  however,  there 
was only 28.3% approval in a large urban sample in Vietnam.
[21]  Perceived  stigma  and  public  attitudes  are  linked  to 
the  availability  of  adequate  treatment  capabilities  within 
a  public  mental  health-care  system.  Even  though  most 
face  challenges  associated 
Western-European  nations 
with a fragmented system of mental health-care providers 
and  financial  constraints,[29]  due  to  better  funding,  the 
complex structure of mental health care to the population 
is  arguably  more  effective  in  comparison  to  South  and 
Southeast  Asian  low-  and  middle-income  countries,  such 
as  Vietnam,  Thailand,  India,  or  the  Philippines.[48,49,52]  Due 
to a relatively small number of low-barrier institutions and 
health-care  providers  in  comparison  to  most  high-income 
countries,  there  is  limited  access  to  appropriate  health 
services  for  a  large  portion  of  the  Indian  population.[16] 
Similarly,  stigmatization  toward  individuals  who  have 
mental  illness  was  reported  to  be  higher  in  Asian  than  in

Western  countries.[20,48]  As  a  consequence,  mentally  ill 
patients, especially those with a low socioeconomic status, 
in  India,  suffer  from  disparities  in  mental  health-care 
services  on  different  ecological  levels  of  analysis.  This 
discrepancy  might  account  for  higher  rates  of  perceived 
stigma, stigma self-labeling, and perceived discrimination, 
which in turn may lead to delayed help-seeking behaviors 
and reluctance to utilize psychiatric treatment, if available.
This is evidenced by how individuals suffering from a mental 
illness in India seem to be treated with less than adequate 
care due to barriers in adequate treatment resources, such 
as  psychotherapy,  community-based 
intervention,  and 
support in the workplace.

In  the  present  study,  an  association  with  gender  was 
found, which is expressed in significantly higher perceived 
stigma  toward  mentally  ill  people  among  women.  To 
interpret  this  finding,  the  cultural  shaping  of  public 
attitudes  regarding  the  role  of  women  in  the  family, 
within  the  historical,  political,  and  everyday  lifeworld  of 
India  must  be  considered.  One  interpretation  that  could 
account  for  the  discrepancy  might  lie  within  culturally 

coined  dispositions  of  women  experiencing  social 
rejection,  negative  attitudes,  and  imposed  gender  roles. 
Such  self-experiences  might  on  the  other  hand  enables 
an  empathic  personal  understanding  toward  vulnerable 
population groups.

The results of the present study correspond to associated 
recent research concerning the role of gender in women’s 
attitudes toward mental illness.[5,30,31] When general, societal, 
and cultural norms are considered, men and women display 
cultural  shaped  differences  in  perceiving  illness  across 
societies  that  also  depend  on  the  level  of  urbanity  and 
socioeconomic status.[32] According to the current research, 
the  importance  of  gender  roles  is  linked  to  the  effects  of 
social,  psychological,  and  material  support  by  spouses, 
family,  and  friends  on  individual  mental  health,[33,34]  since 
a  functional  support  system  can  act  as  a  buffer  against 
adverse  effects  or  stressful  life  events  while  lowering  the 
risk  of  psychiatric  disorders.[34]  Research  on  gender  roles 
within  different  societies  suggests  that  women  display  a 
heightened overall demand for social support to maintain 
their  psychological  well-being.[33-35]  However,  a  person’s 
dependence on social support within larger families might 
also  predetermine  a  higher  vulnerability  to  emotional 
distress  and  mental  disorders  such  as  affective  disorders, 
especially  if  confronted  with  perceived  social  rejection  or 
when support systems disintegrate.[36] Hence, grounded in 
diverging  social  expectations,  internalized  experiences  of 
social rejection may lead to women perceiving social support 
as lower.[34] Therewith, female participants might consider 
patients  with  mental  illnesses,  including  themselves,  as 
being  too  burdened  and  incapable  of  coping  with  stigma 
attached to mental illness, which thus results in even higher 
rates of perceived stigma.

This influence of gender roles on perceived stigma extends 
to other sociocultural dimensions. A study investigating the 
differences  in  internalized  and  externalized  mental  illness 
and gender stigma between mothers and fathers suggested 
that  parents  may  experience  gender-specific  effects  on 
parenting.[35]  Considering  the  impact  of  cultural  norms 
and gender stereotypes in the lifeworld of India, parenting 
remains in most social strata a predominantly female role. 
The transitional process in Indian societies has, especially in 
cities, shifted some of the caregiver responsibilities to men, 
gradually  engendering  an  adjustment  of  social  norms.[38] 
Nevertheless, close-knit family ties and hierarchies persist 
in  India,  and  the  immediate  family  remains  the  most 
important source of social support.

Respecting the familial constellations and gender dynamics 
in India, it is crucial to understand the cumulative effect of 
gender on perceived role expectations and stigmatization 
and  discrimination  in  cases  of  perceived  failure.  In  rural, 
but  also  large  parts  of  urban  India,  the  predominant  role 
of  married  women  is  to  function  as  a  housewife,  which

Böge, et al.: Perceived stigma of mental illness in Indiaimpairs  Indian  women’s  capacity  to  build  up  and  rely  on 
an  extensive  social  support  system,  compared  to  women 
in other countries.[37] In accordance, more than 60% of the 
female  participants  of  this  urban  sample  indicated  their 
occupational status as “homemaker.” While the importance 
that is attributed to the role of a homemaker can generate 
pride  and  family  recognition,  the  experienced  caregiver 
burden and fear of failure, especially if affected by illness, 
also constitute risk factors for psychological distress. Being 
a  “homemaker”  may  restrict  Indian  women’s  interaction 
outside of the familial realms and thus limits their access to 
a broader support system that is often available in working 
places.[34]  These  factors  are  in  correlation  with  a  limited 
external  authority  and 
independent  decision-making 
capacity  of  women  in  most  Indian  societies  and  their 
often-subordinate  role  within  the  family  hierarchy.[32]  In 
accordance, recent studies revealed that the most common 
causes  for  attempted  suicide  among  Indian  women  were 
marital and interpersonal problems, followed by psychiatric 
and  physical  illnesses.[39]  Another  study  revealed  higher 
levels  of  internalized  stigma  among  women  in  India, 
which  suggests  that  women  may  experience  emotional 
distress  even  in  the  absence  of  immediate  rejection  or 
discrimination, but might refrain from seeking professional 
help.  A  possible  interpretation  for  the  higher  levels  of 
internalized  stigma  that  is  related  to  more  reliance  on 
functional  social  support  systems  may  be  associated  with 
fear of social marginalization, rejection, abandonment, and 
domestic  violence  if  stigmatized  as  a  person  with  mental 
illness.[33] Continuing to facilitate the transition process of 
social  and  cultural  norms  as  well  as  increasing  legislative 
efforts in India may further strengthen women’s autonomy 
and agency in the future.[43,53,54]

While  the  level  of  perceived  stigma  of  mental  illness  in 
India  is  indicated  to  be  high  and  the  above-discussed 
potentially  harmful  effects  cannot  be  rejected,  studies 
on  the  prognosis  of  psychiatric  disorders  are  also  worth 
mentioning. India’s social support system differs from that 
of the most Western countries. The concept of the family 
remains  the  most  crucial  institution  of  social  support  in 
India,  with  an  emphasis  on  family  integrity,  loyalty,  and 
family  unity.  This  fundamental  social  concept  applies 
strongly  to  the  caretaking  of  family  members  affected  by 
mental disorders. While it was not unusual for the mentally 
ill  to  experience  rejection  by  their  families  after  having 
been institutionalized in Western countries, in India, there 
has been a long tradition of involving not only close family 
members,  but  also  extended  kin  with  the  treatment  of 
mentally ill relatives. The importance of the role of a family 
when it comes to the treatment of those who have mental 
illness  is  emphasized  when  considering  the  relatively  low 
number of mental health professionals in the country.[40]

Studies  have  shown  positive  influences  of  strong  family 
support  for  those  recovering  from  mental  illness,  which 

includes  perceived  moral  support,  practical  support,  and 
social  motivation  toward  recovery.[41]  It  is  also  indicated 
that the influence of family regarding treatment results in 
less stigma[42] and in addition to that constitutes a factor for 
a more favorable social outcome and functioning. Finally, it 
has been shown that a broader distribution of the burden 
among  larger  and  extended  families  results  in  a  better 
capacity to adequately provide support for relatives of the 
mentally ill.[40]

Looking  ahead  and  considering  potential  future  research, 
it  is  worth  mentioning  an  important  political  step  that 
was  reached  with  the  Indian  Mental  Health  Act,[50,51] 
implemented  by  the  Government  of  India  in  April  2017. 
That  progressive  bill  aimed  to  further  strengthen  persons 
affected by mental illness and their caregiver is destined to 
bring about a series of changes and treatment implication 
on a large-scale population level. The impact of this Mental 
Health Act on perceived discrimination and stigmatization, 
affecting the second largest population worldwide, will be 
a valuable subject of future population-based longitudinal 
studies.  One  of  the  main  aims  in  the  passing  of  the  bill 
was  to  reduce  the  overall  social  stigma  associated  with 
mental  illness  in  India.[45]  Furthermore,  effects  of  the  law 
with  regard  to  treatment,  funding,  and  stigma  are  likely 
to also have a positive impact on the reputation of mental 
hospitals, which have suffered in comparison to the better 
funded, better staffed, and more up-to-date general hospital 
psychiatric  units.[46,47]  Therefore,  it  will  be  important  to 
analyze how these legal changes that include a redefinition 
of mental illness, ensuring a right to access mental health 
care,  decriminalizing  attempted  suicide,  and  giving  more 
rights  to  persons  who  have  a  mental  illness  concerning 
their treatment and legal representation[43,44] will eventually 
reduce  public,  self,  and  structural  stigma  of  persons  and 
families affected by mental illness.[21]

Limitations
The  present  study  encountered  several  limitations  that 
ought to be considered in future research in this field. First, 
even though the present study achieved a large sample size 
of 920 participants, it cannot claim full representativeness 
for  a  population  of  1.3  billion  people.  Second,  while  the 
sample  included  participants  living  in  five  metropolitan 
Indian  cities  representing  different  parts  of  the  country, 
rural  areas  remained  unattended.  Future  research  could 
benefit  from  more  varieties  by  providing  insights  into 
the  effects  of  different  cultural  and  societal  norms  by 
accounting  for  differences  of  urbanity.  Third,  further 
confounding variables with potential impact on the level of 
perceived stigma, such as household size, marital status, or 
familiarity with mental illness, cannot be ruled out. Finally, 
a  moderate  Cronbach’s  alpha  (  =  0.476)  may  be  related 
to  the  heterogeneous  sample  regarding  the  geographic 
location in India, language, and overall cultural background, 
given India’s enormous size and diversity. Fourth, the study

Böge, et al.: Perceived stigma of mental illness in Indiahas been conducted by a team of ten authors from a diverse 
cultural background, among these three authors of Indian 
descent  (AZ,  AM,  and  AT)  with  training  or  researching  at 
least part time in India. All the other authors have conducted 
several  peer-reviewed  studies  regarding  public  attitudes 
toward psychiatry in countries of diverse cultural, religious, 
and  social  background.  Nonetheless,  the  research  team  is 
currently  collaborating  with  the  Asian  Institute  of  Public 
Health,  Odisha,  and  therewith  more  researchers  in  India 
to  assess  attitudes  toward  mental  health  illness  in  more 
diverse way, especially in rural settings of India, to obtain 
an even better comparative understanding of the field.

CONCLUSION

in 

The  present  study  analyzed  data  from  five  metropolitan 
cities 
India  regarding  the  perceived  stigma  and 
discrimination of mental illness in India, thereby explicitly 
accounting  for  influential  sociodemographic  factors.  The 
analysis  revealed  a  significant  influence  of  gender  on  the 
perceived  stigma  of  mental  illness,  with  higher  levels  of 
perceived stigma among female participants. As a next step, 
awareness  programmes  related  to  issues  such  as  gender 
and  family  roles,  but  also  public  support  systems,  should 
be implemented. Additionally, increasing awareness about 
mental  health  as  well  as  the  integration  of  mental  health 
into  the  primary  health  care  system  resemble  measures 
that  could  reduce  stigmatization  and  facilitate  mental 
healthcare  utilization  within  the  framework  of  the  Indian 
Mental Health Act.
