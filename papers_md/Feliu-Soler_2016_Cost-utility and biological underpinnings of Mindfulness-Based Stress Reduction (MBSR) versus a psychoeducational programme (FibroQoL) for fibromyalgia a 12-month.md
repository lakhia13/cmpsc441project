Abstract

Background: The EUDAIMON study focuses on fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), a prevalent chronic condition
characterized by pain, fatigue, cognitive problems and distress. According to recent reviews and meta-analyses,
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a promising therapeutic approach for patients with FMS. The
measurement of biomarkers as part of the analysis of MBSR effects would help to identify the neurobiological
underpinnings of MBSR and increase our knowledge of FMS pathophysiology. The main objectives of this 12-month
RCT are: firstly, to examine the effectiveness and cost-utility for FMS patients of MBSR as an add-on to treatment
as usual (TAU) versus TAU + the psychoeducational programme FibroQoL, and versus TAU only; secondly, to
examine pre-post differences in brain structure and function, as well as levels of specific inflammatory markers in
the three study arms and; thirdly, to analyse the role of some psychological variables as mediators of 12-month
clinical outcomes.

Methods: Effectiveness, cost-utility, and neurobiological analyses performed alongside a 12-month RCT. The
participants will be 180 adult patients with FMS recruited at the Sant Joan de Déu hospital (St. Boi de Llobregat, Spain),
randomly allocated to one of the three study arms: TAU + MBSR vs. TAU + FibroQol vs. TAU. A comprehensive
assessment to collect functional, quality of life, distress, costs, and psychological variables will be conducted
pre-, post-intervention, and at 12-month post-intervention. Fifty per cent of study participants will be evaluated at
pre- and post-treatment using Voxel-Based Morphometry, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, pseudo-continuous Arterial Spin
Labeling, and resting state fMRI. A cytokine multiplex kit of high-sensitivity will be applied (cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 +
high-sensitivity CRP test).

Discussion: The findings obtained from this RCT will indicate whether MBSR is potentially cost-effective for FMS and
contribute to knowledge of any brain and inflammatory changes associated with MBSR in FMS patients. Specifically, we
will determine whether there are morphometric and functional changes associated with participation in MBSR in brain
regions related to meta-awareness, body awareness, memory consolidation-reconsolidation, emotion regulation and in
networks postulated to underpin the sensory-discriminative, cognitive-evaluative and affective-motivational aspects of
the pain experience.

Background
Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a debilitating syndrome usually di-
agnosed in women between the ages of 20 and 50 years
[1]. It is characterised by multifocal pain, fatigue, disturbed
sleep, cognitive problems, and high levels of distress [2]. A
survey performed in five European countries indicated
that the estimated overall prevalence of FMS is 2.9 % in
the general population [3]. Patients with FMS typically
present comorbidities with psychiatric disorders such as
anxiety (13–63.8 %) and depressive disorders (20–80 %)
[4]. In addition, FMS is associated with high direct (med-
ical visits, multiple prescriptions of medications, etc.) and
indirect (absenteeism, work loss, etc.) costs in industria-
lised countries [5]. Among chronic pain conditions, FMS
causes the highest rates of unemployment, the highest rate
of incapacity benefits claim rate, and the greatest number
of days absent from work [6]. FMS represents a great
challenge for health professionals because of the lack of
optimal treatment options. The effectiveness of pharmaco-
logical interventions is generally limited and more ubiqui-
tous effects have been found for non-pharmacological
treatments [7].

The Central Nervous System (CNS) seems to play a
crucial role in the pathogenesis of FMS [1, 8]. In this
regard, structural and functional brain abnormalities in
several areas related to pain and stress response regula-
tion (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex, insula, parahippo-
campal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, somatosensorial cortex)
have been observed in patients with FMS. Specifically,
significant grey matter reductions in the prefrontal cor-
tex, anterior cingulate cortex and insular cortex have
been reported [9]. Such alterations may contribute to
the impaired control of pain and abnormal processing of
painful stimuli [8]. Alterations in functional connectivity
within the brain’s pain inhibitory network; the default-
mode network (DMN) and the executive attention network
(EAN), as well as greater intrinsic connectivity between the
insula and the DMN and EAN were also reported [10, 11].
Furthermore, higher spontaneous pain at the time of the
scan was found to be correlated with greater intrinsic
connectivity between the insula and both the DMN and
the EAN [11]. Moreover, reductions in insula-DMN

connectivity were associated with pain reduction in FMS
[12], suggesting a key role in the etiology of the disease.
Reduced resting connectivity within the somatosensory
system and increased connectivity between the DMN and
somatosensory processing regions such as S2 have been re-
cently reported [13], which may suggest that a general
weakening of sensory integration may be also underlie
clinical pain in patients with FMS.

In addition to the aforementioned abnormalities in the
CNS,
imbalances in inflammatory markers have also
been also observed in FMS. Specifically, higher levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1,
IL6, and IL8) and
lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL4 and
IL10) have been reported [14–16]. This cytokine imbal-
ance may produce a chronic inflammatory state in the
CNS and the peripheral nervous system, facilitating the
sensitisation of peripheral nerves to nociceptive stimuli,
increasing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and
the synthesis of prostaglandin and substance P, which
lower the pain threshold [14]. Furthermore, cytokines
have further effects on the CNS by altering synthesis, re-
uptake, and release of neurotransmitters involved in the
perception, and affective, cognitive and motivational regu-
lation of pain, contributing to structural and functional
brain changes and to the perpetuation of pain [17]. Add-
itionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines augment tryptophan
metabolism, which may boost affective symptoms in FMS
[18–20] and activate glial cells that release a combination
of substances into the cerebral spinal fluid that are associ-
ated with pain amplification (P substance, glutamate,
nerve growth factor, and brain-derived neurotrophic
factor) [21].

Contemplatives have pointed out that the practice of
meditation reduces the experience of pain by controlling
expectations, the nature and orientation of attention to-
wards the experience, and its related emotional response.
Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) were conceived
in the late 1970s from the effort to integrate Buddhist
meditation into western psychological practice. In the
last decade, there has been growing interest in the effect-
iveness of MBIs for a range of physical and mental con-
ditions [22], including chronic pain. Veehof et al. [23], in

Feliu-Soler et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2016) 16:81 

Page 3 of 16

a meta-analysis in chronic pain patients, showed that
MBIs have significant effects on pain intensity, depression,
anxiety, physical wellbeing, and quality of life. Given that
there are no curative treatments available for patients with
FMS [1], the putative use of MBIs as coadjuvants of usual
care is highly promising.

Bawa and colleagues [24] recently found limited evi-
dence for the effectiveness of MBIs in chronic pain.
Their meta-analysis revealed that MBIs have a positive
impact on perceived pain control although there was no
evidence of a benefit in clinical outcomes. Separate sub-
improved physical
group analysis found evidence of
functioning and quality of life for MBIs versus inactive
control conditions. When compared to active control
conditions, the effect of MBIs was equivalent to the ac-
tive comparator. However, results were inconclusive
given that the included studies generally involved small
samples. In line with these findings, a systematic review
of 10 studies [25] indicated that although MBIs provide
some significant physical and psychological benefit for
patients with FMS, the divergence in the outcomes mea-
sured, sample sizes, and data presented failed to estab-
lish definitive conclusions about
the effectiveness of
MBIs. The specific effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction (MBSR) for FMS patients was evalu-
ated by Lauche and colleagues [26], who found that
MBSR improves quality of life and reduces pain in the
short term. Nevertheless, further high-quality RCTs are
still necessary because of the considerable methodo-
logical
the meta-analysed studies (e.g.,
absence of randomization, high attrition rates, or small
sample sizes).

limitations of

There is a great amount of evidence of structural
changes in experienced meditators compared to individuals
without meditative experience [27, 28]. These changes
would be indicative of increases in meta-awareness (fronto-
polar cortex), exteroceptive and interoceptive body aware-
ness (sensory cortices and insula), memory consolidation
and reconsolidation (hippocampus), self and emotion regu-
lation (anterior, mid cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices),
and intra- and interhemispheric communication (superior
longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum) associated with
meditation. Structural changes in specific brain areas (e.g.,
hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex, the temporo-
parietal junction, and cerebellum) have been reported after
a MBSR intervention [29].

Significant differences in brain function have been ob-
served between meditators and non-meditators. In this
regard, Brewer et al. [30] found reduced activation of
two main DMN nodes (posterior cingulate cortex and
medial prefrontal cortex) and activations of the medial
prefrontal cortex,
lobes during
meditation in individuals with meditative experience,
showing a differential pattern of functional connectivity

insula, and temporal

both during resting and when practicing mindfulness.
Similarly, Jang et al. [31] reported greater functional
connectivity (at rest) in some areas of the DMN (i.e., the
medial prefrontal cortex) in individuals with meditative
experience, suggesting that meditation practice would be
associated with functional changes in DMN areas even
when not practicing meditation. Furthermore, functional
brain changes (e.g., increases in left frontal activation,
higher activity in insula, secondary somatosensorial cortex,
anterior cingulate cortex, lower activity in right amygdala
and in several DMN regions) have been observed after
standard MBSR [32]. All the brain changes following mind-
fulness training are associated with increased learning and
memory processes, emotion regulation, self-referential pro-
cessing, and perspective taking, an augmented experiential,
present-focused mode of self-reference, higher interocep-
tive awareness, more accurate processing of exteroceptive
sensory events, higher attentional control and reduced
conceptual processing [29, 32, 33]. Interestingly, mindful-
ness training seems to impact on pain experience as signifi-
cantly lower pain unpleasantness and intensity ratings
(compared to resting state) were found after a brief mind-
fulness training session when meditating in the presence of
painful stimulation [34]. In this study, reductions in pain
intensity ratings were found to be associated with increased
activity in areas involved in the cognitive and affective
regulation of nociceptive processing (anterior cingulate
cortex and insula) and reductions in pain unpleasantness
ratings were associated with increased activity in brain
areas (orbitofrontal cortex) involved in reframing the con-
textual evaluation of sensory events and diminished thal-
amic activity, which may reflect a change in the interaction
between afferent input and executive-order brain areas.

Improvements in immune function after mindfulness
training have also been reported. In this regard, reduced
psychophysiological stress and inflammatory responses
(levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, C reactive
protein, or in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes
related to NF-κB factor) have been reported after mindful-
ness training [35–37]. For instance, there is some evidence
of beneficial effects of mindfulness training on cell-
mediated immunity in patients with cancer [38], and HIV
[35, 39]. Studies with larger samples and more adequate
methodologies (e.g., using more rigorous control groups,
longer follow-ups) are needed to better ascertain the
effects of MBSR on inflammatory processes. A recent
meta-analysis [40] examined the impact of mind-body
treatments (including meditation, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, and
Yoga) on inflammatory markers, finding that when all re-
sults from healthy and heterogeneous clinical samples
were pooled, there was some evidence supporting an anti-
inflammatory effect of mind-body treatments.

There is currently a total absence of empirical evi-
dence regarding the cost-effectiveness of MBIs for FMS

syndrome. Worldwide, mindfulness research is rapidly
expanding and being applied in different contexts, and
there has been a call for more health economics research.
Bearing in mind that costs are of crucial importance for
policy-makers, who usually consider as first-choice treat-
ment those interventions with the lowest cost per quality-
adjusted life-year (QALY), economic evaluations of MBIs
in FMS should be carried out to ensure (if cost-effective)
their implementation in healthcare systems. Moreover, the
evidence for mindfulness as the causal factor in structural
and functional brain changes [27, 32] and the mechanistic
effects of inflammatory markers on the therapeutic ef-
fects of mindfulness remain tenuous, so further work is
needed to gain a deeper understanding of how mindful-
ness actually works.

Taking these issues into consideration the aim of this
12-month randomised, controlled trial (RCT) is three-
fold: firstly, to examine the effectiveness and cost-utility
for FMS patients of MBSR as an add-on to treatment as
usual
(TAU) versus a psychoeducational programme
(FibroQoL) that recently that has been shown to be a
cost-effective adjuvant to TAU [41]. Secondly, to exam-
ine pre-post neurobiological changes in brain structure
and function, as well as in levels of some pro- and anti-
inflammatory markers in the three study arms (TAU vs
TAU + MBSR vs TAU + FibroQoL). Thirdly, to analyse
the role of specific process variables (facets of mindful-
ness, pain catastrophism, psychological inflexibility, and
long-term clinical
self-compassion) as mediators of
improvement.

Methods
Study design
This RCT protocol was developed following the Standard
Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials
(SPIRIT) [42] and was recorded in the ClinicalTrials.gov
trial register in September 2015 (NCT02561416). We de-
signed a 12-month, parallel group, randomised (using a
computer-generated randomisation list), single-blind, con-
trolled trial (RCT) with three treatment arms. The Consoli-
dated Standards of Reporting Trials 2010 (CONSORT)
[43] and the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation
Reporting Standards (CHEERS) [44] will be followed. The
three treatment arms are:

1. TAU + MBSR
2. TAU + FibroQoL
3. TAU

will undergo neurobiological evaluations (neuroimaging
and inflammatory markers).

Participants
A total of 180 FMS patients will be recruited from the
Rheumatology service at Sant Joan de Déu Hospital (St.
Boi de Llobregat, Spain). Sample size is established on
the basis of a previous meta-analysis of controlled MBSR
trials [45] in which a mean effect size of d = 0.53 was
found. This effect size results in 1-b = 0.89 (alpha = 0.05)
for N = 60 patients per group (180 patients overall).
With 20 % maximal attrition, the power remains 1-b =
0.82. The estimated sample size for the study of bio-
markers (neuroimaging and cytokines) was 30 partici-
pants per condition,
this sample size is considered
adequate given that approximately 20–40 participants
(in between-group designs) are necessary to detect a
change of 15 % in cerebral blood flow in regions of inter-
est (ROI) by means of pseudo-continuous Arterial Spin
Labeling (pCASL) [46].

Eligibility criteria and Multi-stage recruitment process
For this study, we use a database with the medical records
of FMS patients referred from local general practices to
the Rheumatology Service at Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de
Déu to confirm diagnosis. The sample pool consists of all
FMS patients included in this database between January
2010 and September 2015 (Nsample pool = 531). Thus, all
patients in the database were diagnosed with FMS (ac-
cording to the American College of Rheumatology, ACR
1990 criteria) by rheumatologists from Parc Sanitari Sant
Joan de Déu.

Patients meeting the following criteria will be eligible:
1. Patients of both genders between 18–65 years-old. 2.
Able to understand the Spanish language. 3. Provide
informed consent to participate. The following general
exclusion criteria will be applied: 1. Participation in
other RCTs. 2. Presence of cognitive impairment accord-
ing to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE < 27).
3. Receiving psychological treatment during the previous or
current year. 4. Reporting previous experience in medita-
tion or other mind-body therapies. 5. Comorbidity with
severe mental or medical disorders which interfere with
treatment (severe medical illness, psychotic symptoms, sub-
stance abuse). 5. Unable to attend group sessions. 6. Preg-
nancy. 7. Involved in ongoing litigation relating to FMS.

Usual contraindications for scanning at 3Tesla and for
measuring cytokine levels have been taken into account
to establish the following additional inclusion/exclusion
criteria for the biomarkers sub-study:

Patients from the three study arms will receive TAU;
given that MBSR and FibroQoL were originally devel-
oped as complements to usual care, not as substitutes
for it. Fifty percent of the participants in each study arm

Inclusion criteria: 1. Female gender. 2. Right-handed.
Exclusion criteria: 1. Infection/cold symptoms on the
day of blood extraction. 2. Needle phobia. 3. BMI >

36 kg/m2 or weight > 110Kg. 4. Neoplastic illnesses,
infection, cardiopulmonary, vascular, or other internal
conditions (collected from the medical history). 5. Use
of oral or local corticosteroids or anticytokine therapy.
6. Consuming more than 7 caffeine units per day (1
caffeine drink will be permitted on the day of the study.
8. Smoking more than 5 cigarettes per day (no smoking
will be permitted on the scanning visit days prior to
scanning or whilst in the centre). 9. Cannot be
evaluated by means of magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) (due to claustrophobia, metal implants, pace-
makers, etc.). 10. Acute pain not -related to FMS on
the day of the study (e.g. headache, lumbar pain). 11.
Being pregnant or breastfeeding. It is important to
point out that patients presenting neuroradiological
alterations during MRI at baseline will be excluded
from the sub-study. Patients will be allowed to continue
with their stable medical treatment although, to reduce
the effects of medications on biomarkers, they will be
required to refrain from taking occasional (rescue)
analgesic drugs (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, paracetamol) 72 h prior to the MRI and
blood extraction. Changes in pharmacological/
non-pharmacological treatment will be monitored
throughout the study and may be a cause of drop-out
from the final analyses.

Procedure
The potential FMS participants will be screened through
an initial telephonic interview by one of the authors
(A.F.S), who will provide a general overview of the study.

Subsequently, two highly trained clinical psychologists
(not involved with the treatment and blind to group al-
location) will make an appointment with those patients
who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate
in the study. The psychologists will check all inclusion/
exclusion criteria (both general and additional for the
biomarkers study) and will perform all face-to face inter-
views. As mentioned above, study participants will be
randomised to one of the three conditions (i.e., TAU,
TAU + MBSR, TAU + FibroQoL). Both MBSR and Fibro-
QoL are conducted in a group format (up to 15 people
in each group). To balance the number of participants
eligible for the biomarkers sub-study across the three
arms, stratified randomisation will be performed. The
proportion of eligible participants for the biomarkers
evaluation and those only meeting criteria for the gen-
eral study will be pre-fixed at 1:1 in all samples. Four
treatment waves (N = 45 each) will be carried out to
achieve the required final sample (N = 180).

Three-five days after the clinical evaluation, patients
assigned to the biomarkers sub-study will be contacted
for blood extraction and MRI completion. To minimise
circadian variability in immunological markers, all whole
blood samples will be collected between 8–9 am. Interven-
tions will be conducted using a parallel design to reduce
seasonal variability in the study measures. The participants
will be interviewed at baseline, after treatment, and at 12-
month follow-up (56 weeks after randomisation). The
neuroimaging tests and cytokine measurements will be
performed at baseline and after treatment. A flowchart of
participants is displayed in Fig. 1.

Interventions
Intervention group (TAU + MBSR; see Table 1)

We will use the MBSR protocol developed at the
University of Massachusetts Medical School, USA. MBSR
[47] is intensive, structured training in mindfulness
meditation which aims to help patients increase their
awareness of the present experience and to relate to their
physical and psychological conditions in a more accepting
and non-judgmental way. The standard MBSR programme
consists of 8 weekly sessions of around 2.5 h each and
homework for 45 min a day, 6 days a week, even though
several modifications in sessions, homework, and total dur-
ation can be observed among distinct courses for various
patient populations. MBSR usually has three main compo-
nents including a “body scan”, which involves a gradual
sweeping of attention through the entire body from feet to
head, focusing non-critically on any sensation or feeling in
body regions and using periodic suggestions of breathing
awareness and relaxation; “sitting meditation” which in-
volves both mindful attention to breathing or on the rising
and falling abdomen as well as other perceptions, and a
state of non-judgmental awareness of cognitions and of
the stream of thoughts and distractions that continuously
flow through the mind; and “Hatha yoga” practice, which
includes breathing exercises, simple stretches, and pos-
tures designed to strengthen and relax the musculoskeletal
system. In addition to in-class mindfulness exercises, par-
ticipants are encouraged to engage in home mindfulness
practice and attend an all-day intensive mindfulness medi-
tation retreat. The main premise of MBSR is that with re-
peated training in mindfulness meditation, individuals will
eventually learn to be less reactive and judgmental toward
their experiences, and more able to recognise, and break
free from, habitual and maladaptive patterns of thinking
and behaviour. It is important to mention that MBSR is

not directed at symptom reduction but more fundamen-
tally towards altering how perceptible mental processes
and content are experienced, towards greater awareness,
acceptance, and tolerance of the unavoidable vagaries of
life, which facilitate enhanced psychological wellbeing,
even in the face of continued symptoms. The eight 2 h
MBSR sessions (once a week) will be performed in groups
(n = 15 per group) and will be led by four accredited
MBSR instructors (one per group) that have undergone
MBSR training, which will enable an analysis of possible
instructor effect on the outcomes, as recommended by
Öst [48]. A book with MBSR manual and CDs with guided
mindfulness practice sessions will be provided to the par-
ticipants. In addition, we will reinforce MBSR treatment
adherence by inviting participants to use a Mindfulness
smartphone app developed in 2014 at the University of
Zaragoza, Spain. The app has been scientifically validated
by the Aragon Institute of Health Sciences. It is the first
app that tracks the state of mindfulness and provides feed-
back on how mindful the person is during mindfulness
meditation sessions. It also provides instruction in several
mindfulness techniques by means of well-designed videos
and audio recordings.

Treatment as Usual control group (TAU)
In Spain, treatment provided is mainly pharmacological
and adjusted to the symptomatic profile of the patients
with FMS. Counselling about aerobic exercise adjusted
to patients’ physical limitations is usually provided.

Active control group (TAU + FibroQoL)
The FibroQoL is a psycho-educational programme for
FMS patients based on a consensus document drawn up
by the Health Department of Catalonia and shown to be
cost-effective in a previous study [41]. This group-based

programme is divided into two parts: The first part is led
by three general practitioners, one rheumatologist and one
psychologist. It includes updated information about patho-
physiology, diagnosis, and management of FMS symptoms
(4 sessions). The second part is led by a psychologist and
includes training in self-hypnosis (4 sessions). In each of
these sessions, a distinct self-hypnosis technique is ex-
plained and practiced. The goal of these techniques is
to generate a state of deep relaxation, explore the sen-
sations produced by one’s own body, achieve control
over the body and pain, and imagine the one’s life in
the future without pain. Many authors have emphasised
the need to consider aspects of identity in order to
understand the phenomena of chronic pain [49]. There-
fore, it is especially useful to explore all the connections
between the identity of a person, the perception of his/
her body, and attitudes towards therapy in general. If
we focus on the theory that each human activity is a
process of creating meaning [50], people should assem-
ble informal theories about, for instance, themselves,
people or health. Their reactions to events such as bod-
ily sensations or interpersonal experiences are mediated
by their interpretations [51].

Some clinicians and scholars [51] highlight certain per-
sonality traits in patients with FMS, including an exces-
sive sense of responsibility, extreme effort
to please
others, personal sacrifices made for others, little time set
aside for themselves, and difficulty setting limits for
others. These characteristics, as well as other difficulties
showed by these patients, are discussed within the group
and are part of the hypnotic inductions for each session.
The group context has been considered an implementer
of hypnotic response since the 18th century; the fact that
someone in the group evidences minimal response raises
expectations among the others and this reaction can in-
crease the hypnotic susceptibility of all group members.
The naturalistic hypnosis method requires that therapist
is well trained in observation and should have a high
degree of sensitivity when using the material provided
by the patients. The reference model
is Ericksonian
hypnosis [52]. According to Erickson, a patient can use
his/her own life experience, resources and prior learn-
ing therapeutically. The focus of Ericksonian hypnosis
is to breakdown non-useful patterns and/or limit be-
haviours that prevent the construction of new meaning.
Some typical properties of hypnosis facilitate this work,
for example:

– Experience attention absorption: the person is
absorbed in an aspect of context, stops paying
attention to irrelevant stimuli.

– Changing the intensity of the experience: the
sensorial and emotional experiences, linked to
memories, are stronger.

– Willingness to experience: people during hypnosis,
people are more amenable to unintentionally
experience new perspectives; this feature is defined
as suggestibility.

– Flexibility of Time-Space Relationship: experience of
distortion of subjective time or temporary phenomena
such as regression or projection into the future.
– Alteration of sensory experience: the person may

Benefits of physical exercise in FM and closing remarks

aNOTE: The current FibroQoL version contains eight 2-h sessions instead of 9.
The multidisciplinary team decided to dismantle the FibroQoL program,
eliminating the session focused on “Holistic Medicine” because it contained some
information about meditation/mindfulness. Thus, both MBSR and FibroQoL
are structurally equivalent, which provides a comparison of MBSR with an
intervention that matches MBSR in non-specific factors, but does not contain
mindfulness ingredients

Clinical characteristics and screening measures

– The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
[53, 54] is a 30-item questionnaire designed to
measure cognitive impairment that is widely used
in older adults. The MMSE includes tests for
orientation, memory, concentration, and visuospatial
ability. In non-geriatric populations (≤65 years),
such as our study sample, the threshold that suggests

a “probable case” of cognitive impairment when the
score is less than 27 points.

– The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Axis I

Disorders (SCID-I) [55]. Clinical diagnosis of mood
disorders according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria
will be confirmed using the research version of the
SCID-I (mood disorders module).

Primary outcome measure

– The Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire

(FIQR) [56, 57] includes 21 individual items that are

Feliu-Soler et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2016) 16:81 

Page 9 of 16

all answered on an 11-point numeric rating scale
from 0 to 10, with 10 reflecting greater impairment.
The time frame is the previous 7 days and the items
are distributed into three associated domains: “physical
function” (9 items); “overall impact” (2 items that
address the overall impact of FM on functioning
and symptom severity); and “severity of symptoms”
(10 items; pain, energy, stiffness, quality of sleep,
depression, memory problems, anxiety, tenderness
to touch, balance problems, and sensitivity to loud
noises, bright lights, odours, and cold temperatures).
The scoring system is straightforward: the physical
function domain (0 to 90) is divided by 3, the overall
impact domain (0 to 20) is not transformed, and the
severity of symptoms domain (0 to 100) is divided by
2. The FIQR total score (0 to 100) is obtained by
adding the three domain scores. The FIQR has been
shown to be a psychometrically sound instrument, is
clinically useful as it can be completed by patients in
less than 2 min and scored in approximately 1 min, is
recommended as a primary efficacy endpoint measure
in FMS clinical trials, and is the “gold standard”
assessment measure for multidimensional functional
status in FMS patients [58].

Secondary outcome measures and process measures

– The Fibromyalgia Survey Diagnostic Criteria (FSDC)
[59, 60] is a 6-item self-report questionnaire that
registers the key symptoms of FMS according to the
latest revision of the ACR. It includes assessment
through the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) identifying
19 body areas (jaws, shoulders, upper arms, lower
arms, hips, upper legs, lower legs, neck, chest, upper
back, lower back and abdomen) where pain or
tenderness was felt during the previous 7 days
(total score 0–19). The Symptom Severity Scale
(SS; range from 0–12) includes three major symptoms
(fatigue, trouble thinking/remembering and waking up
tired or unrefreshed), which is scored from 0 to 3, as
well as three additional symptoms (pain or cramps
in lower abdomen, depression, headache), which
can be coded as present (1) or absent (0). The
fibromyalgianess scale is defined as the sum of the
WPI items (0–19) and the 6-item SS scale (0–12),
so total scores can range from 0 to 31.

– The Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) [61, 62]
used for the present project will be designed to
collect retrospective data on medication and service
receipt: 1. Medication. A profile of the patient’s use
of all prescribed medications (analgesics, non-steroidal
anti-inflammatories, short- and long-acting opioids,
etc.) will be requested, including the name of the drug,
the prescriber, the dosage level, the total number of

days taking the drug, the total dosage consumed,
the reasons for changing the drug, and adherence.
2. Service receipt. We will collect information about
emergency services, general medical in-patient hospital
admissions and out-patient health care services.
Patients will also be asked about type and number
of diagnostic tests administered. As shown in
Table 3, the CSRI will be administered at baseline
and at a 12-month follow-up; on both occasions,
the previous 12 months will be reviewed.

– The EuroQoL-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) [63]
is a widely used health-related quality of life
instrument with a non-disease-specific classification
system composed of 2 parts: Part 1 is a self-reported
description of health problems classified into five
dimensions. Patients mark one of five degrees of
severity in each dimension. The time frame is the
day of responding. Part 2 records the current subject’s
health on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); a vertical
10 cm line on which the best and worst imaginable
health states score 100 and 0, respectively.

– The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
[64, 65] was originally developed to quantify the
severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms in
non-psychiatric hospital patients The HADS includes
a total of 14 items that assess anxiety (HADS-A) and
depressive (HADS-D) symptoms, with 7 items in each
subscale. Each item is answered on a four-point
(0-to-3) scale so that possible scores range from
0 to 21 for both anxiety and depressive symptoms,
with higher scores indicating greater severity.

– The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) [66] is a 10-item,
self-administered instrument that measures the
degree to which situations in one’s life are considered
stressful. Scores range from 0 to 72. The Spanish
version of the PSS-10 has adequate reliability and
validity [67].

– The Multidimensional Inventory of Subjective

Cognitive Impairment (MISCI) [68] is a 10-item
measure of perception of cognitive dysfunction in
FMS, developed through classical test theory and
item response theory from cognitive functioning
item banks that were developed as part of the Patient
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
System (PROMIS). The MISCI showed excellent
internal reliability, low ceiling/floor effects, and
good convergent validity with a similar measure.
– The Pain Catastrophising Scale (PCS) [69, 70] is a
13-item questionnaire derived partially from the
Coping Strategies Questionnaire and other descriptions
of catastrophising. It has three dimensions: Rumination
(tendency to focus excessively on pain sensations),
Magnification (tendency to magnify the threat value
of pain sensations) and Helplessness (tendency to

Feliu-Soler et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2016) 16:81 

Page 10 of 16

perceive oneself as unable to control the intensity
of pain). The PCS total score and subscale scores
are computed as the algebraic sum of ratings
made for each item. PCS items are rated in relation
to frequency of occurrence on 5-point scales
(0 = never ~ 4 = almost always).

– The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)
[71, 72] consists of 39 items that assess five facets
of mindfulness. Items are rated on a Likert scale
ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very
often or always true). The factors include: Observing,
including noticing or attending to internal and
external experiences such as sensations, thoughts,
or emotions. Describing refers to labelling internal
experiences with words. Acting with awareness
involves focusing on one’s activities in the here
and now as opposed to behaving mechanically.
Non-judging of inner experience refers to taking a
non-evaluative stance toward thoughts and feelings.
Finally, non-reactivity to inner experience is allowing
thoughts and feelings to come and go, without getting
caught up in or carried away by them. In a recent
online survey answered by 4,986 FMS patients
from all 50 US states and 30 countries, the FFMQ
subscales was shown to discriminate well among
FMS patients self-identified as meditators or
non-meditators. Overall, FMS patients with higher
mindfulness scores had lower levels of FMS symptom
severity as measured with the FIQR [73].

– The Self-Compassion Scale-short form (SCS-12)

[74, 75] is a shorter version (12 items) of the SCS
(26 items). The SCS was designed to assess overall
self-compassion (total score) and components of
self-compassion across three dimensions: common
humanity, mindfulness and self-kindness. The SCS–SF
shows good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α ≥0.86)
and very high convergence with the long form of the
scale (r ≥0.97).

– The Psychological inflexibility in pain scale (PIPS)
[76, 77] is a 12-item scale designed to measure
psychological inflexibility in pain patients. The
instrument includes two factors: avoidance and
cognitive fusion related to pain. The items consist of
different statements that are considered to be related
to chronic pain, psychological inflexibility, suffering
and disability (coherent with the ACT theory). All the
items are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale that
ranges from “1 = never true” to “7 = always true”, with
higher scores indicating more psychological inflexibility.

Other measures

– The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)

and Pain Specific Impression of Change (PSIC) [78]

are measures that have been frequently used as
indicators of meaningful overall change [on a
7-point Likert scale, from 1 = “Much better” to
7 = “Much worse”] in treatments for chronic pain,
whereas the PSIC asks about the impression of
change in more specific domains: physical and
social functioning, work-related activities, mood,
and pain.

– Adapted version of the Credibility/Expectancy

questionnaire (CEQ) [79]. The CEQ is a 6-item
questionnaire for measuring treatment expectancy
and credibility for use in clinical outcome studies.
The questionnaire shows overall high internal
consistency (α = 0.84–0.85). We will use an adapted
version that evaluates Expectancy (at the end of the
first treatment session) and Opinion (at the end of
the last treatment session) about MBSR and FibroQoL.

– Log of out-session for MBSR and psychotherapeutic
practices. An ad hoc instrument for the weekly
recording of formal and informal mindfulness or
FibroQoL home practice. A recent systematic
review of systematic reviews and a meta-analysis
of standardised mindfulness interventions (MBSR
and MBCT) indicated that an increase in total
minutes of mindfulness practice and class attendance
are associated with a reduction of stress and mood
complaints [80].

– Adverse events of the interventions. Ad hoc measure
to check for adverse events (e.g., anxiety, dizziness,
sleep problems, etc.) across the interventions and
follow-up.

Neuroimaging MRI will be performed on a 3.0 T Phillips
Ingenia wide-bore MR scanner (70 cm bore size) fitted
with an 8-channel, phased-array receive-only head coil.
T1- and T2-weighted images will be acquired for radio-
logic assessment and image registration. We want to
explore voxel-wise structural and functional changes asso-
ciated with participation in the different treatments across
the brain and in functionally-defined brain regions of
relating to meta-awareness, body awareness,
interest
memory consolidation-reconsolidation, and emotion regu-
lation. The main ROI for structural and functional data-
sets are defined as primary and secondary somatosensory
cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, insula, amyg-
dala, hippocampus, frontal pole and orbitofrontal cortex.
These ROI will be delineated with the aid of a neuroimag-
ing atlas such as the WFU Pickatlas [81]. Prior to and after
MRI, all participants will be asked to rate perceived pain
intensity using a horizontal visual analog scale (100 mm
length) marked “no pain” and “maximum pain” at the
endpoints. The time frame is “the day of responding” and
“during the MRI session”, respectively.

Brain structure Our intention is to use longitudinal
voxel-based morphometry (VBM), an automated struc-
tural MRI analysis technique, to examine whether the
three interventions (TAU, TAU + MBSR, TAU + Fibro-
QoL) produce local changes in grey matter. We will ac-
quire high-resolution T1-weighted 3-dimensional volume
scans pre and post treatment to assess for the presence of
longitudinal change following treatment. Specifically, rela-
tive local increases and decreases between pre- and post-
treatment scans will be compared within and between
study groups. In addition, we will use Diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI). The diffusion MR data will be analysed
by using the diffusion tensor model. After a mathematical
diagonalisation process, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
describing the tensor ellipsoid will be determined. Then,
two standard diffusion indices will be obtained: the
apparent diffusion coefficient and the fractional anisot-
ropy. DTI scans pre and post treatment will permit to
assess changes in axial diffusivity, with lower values
being interpreted as structural enhancement of white
lower axial diffusivity at post-
matter. For example,
treatment in MBSR participants compared to control
participants would suggest a white matter increase as
consequence of meditation training.

Brain function Recent evidence [82] has demonstrated
the suitability of pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling
(pCASL), a perfusion MRI technique, to quantify changes
in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) that relate to the
experience of ongoing persistent pain. In this study we will
assess rCBF prior to and following the three treatments.
pCASL data acquisition, pre-processing, and analysis
methodologies have been published [82, 83], as applied to
various disease states and therapeutic regimens, using
gold-standard software packages (SPM-8 and FSL). We
will acquire pCASL images using a gradient echo single
shot echoplanar imaging readout resulting in whole-brain
blood-flow maps. We will analyse pre-post rCBF differ-
ences within and between groups, and whether pre-post
rCBF differences are related to variability in subjective
ongoing pain.

Multiple resting-state networks have been found which
show activity during rest and during tasks. One of them
is the DMN, which shows a decrease in activity during
cognitive tasks and is activated during self-referential
thinking. Napadow et al. [12] showed that resting con-
nectivity between the insular cortex (region involved in
pain perception) and the DMN is significantly correlated
with clinical pain at the time of the scan in FMS pa-
tients. In this work, we will use resting-state fMRI to
compare changes in insular cortex-DMN connectivity
between study conditions as well as to analysing any
correlation between this connectivity and clinical pain.
During the 8-min resting state fMRI acquisition period,

the FMS patients will be instructed to remain awake
with their eyes closed.

Inflammatory markers Blood samples will be collected
and serum will be stored at −80° for biochemical ana-
lyses. Levels of the following inflammatory markers will
be assessed: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and high-sensitivity C-
reactive protein [84]. Milliplex® assay kits (Human High
Sensitivity T Cell kit) from MerkMilliporte (commercial
firm) will be used for cytokine quantification in a Lumi-
nex® platform. CRP-hs will be assessed by turbidimetry
in an Olympus AU5400 Autoanalyser.

Statistical analyses of study outcomes
SPSS v22.0, STATA v13.0 and Mplus v7.2 will be used for
the statistical analyses. One-way ANOVAs (with post hoc
Tukey’s HSD or Games-Howell
for continuous
values and χ2 tests with continuity corrections for categor-
ical values will be computed on all baseline measures and
socio-demographic variables to examine pre-treatment
differences between groups.

tests)

Analysis of clinical efficacy
To assess treatment effects, we will perform Intention-
to-Treat analyses, which will include all participants who
undergo random allocation, using multiple imputation
to replace missing values.

To study the differences in the primary outcome and
in each of the secondary outcomes between groups, lin-
ear mixed-effects models [85] will be prepared using
Restricted Maximum Likelihood to estimate the parame-
ters. Comparisons amongst treatment groups at post-
treatment and at 12-month follow-up will be computed
with estimates derived from the linear mixed-effect
models (use of the Bonferroni method to adjust the sig-
nificance level of the pairwise contrasts). Calculations of
between-groups effect sizes using Cohen’s d with its
95 % confidence interval will be based on the pooled
standard deviation at baseline. Finally, to make the find-
ings from the present RCT meaningful to clinicians, the
number-needed-to-treat (NNT) [86] in the MBSR condi-
tion will be reported. Taking the Luciano et al. [87]
NNT approach as our reference, we dichotomise partici-
pants into responders or non-responders using three
separate cut-off criteria: (a) ≥ 20 % reduction on the
FIQR total score from baseline to post-treatment; (b) ≥
50 % reduction on the FIQR total score from baseline to
post-treatment; and (c) number of patients crossing a
cut-off point (reaching no worse than mild functional
impairment; FIQR total score < 39).

Given that some pharmacological

treatments may
interfere with cytokine levels [88], differences in cytokine
levels between patients taking vs. not taking antidepres-
sants will be evaluated.

Page 12 of 16

Mediational analyses
We will examine whether the effect of treatments on out-
comes at 12-month follow-up are mediated through
changes in “process variables” (mindfulness, pain catastro-
phising, psychological inflexibility, and self-compassion) at
post-treatment. Using two-stage meta-analytic structural
equation modelling, Gu and colleagues [89] identified
moderate and consistent evidence for some of the pro-
posed process variables [mindfulness and rumination (di-
mension of catastrophising)] and preliminary but still
insufficient evidence for others [self-compassion and psy-
chological flexibility] as mediator mechanisms underlying
standardised MBIs (MBSR and MBCT). Following Luciano
et al. [87], pre- to post-treatment change scores for
the process variable, and the pre- to follow-up change
scores for the outcome variables will be computed.
We will analyse the direct and indirect relationships
between treatments (TAU + MBSR vs. TAU + FibroQoL),
process variables, and study outcomes using path analysis
models. The treatment condition is considered the inde-
the pre-post change scores in the
pendent variable,
process variables are the mediators, and pre- to follow-up
changes in the outcome variables are the dependent vari-
ables. In this way, we are taking temporality into account,
which increases the prospect of establishing conclusions
about causality. We will analyse the data of participants
from the MBSR and FibroQoL treatments who receive a
sufficient dose of the intervention, defined in this case as
attendance at a minimum of 6 of the 8 weekly sessions.
Simple and multiple mediation (simultaneously testing
multiple variables as mediators) models will be computed.
The direct path between study condition and clinical out-
come and the indirect effect through the process variables
will be tested.

Cost-utility analysis
Taking a previous study by our group as a reference
[90], the cost-utility of TAU + MBSR compared to the
other study arms will be evaluated from healthcare and
societal perspectives.

Costs will be estimated from the healthcare and soci-
follow-up.
etal perspectives during the 12 months of
Direct health care costs are calculated by adding costs
derived from medication consumption, medical tests,
use of health-related services, and cost of staff to run the
intervention. The cost of medication is calculated by deter-
mining the price per milligram during the study, according
to the Vademecum International (Red Book), and including
value-added tax. Total costs of medications are calculated
by multiplying the price per milligram by the daily dose in
milligrams and the number of days receiving such treat-
ment. The unit costs of medical tests and health services
will be obtained from the SOIKOS health database (http://
www.oblikue.com/bddcostes/). Indirect costs are calculated

by taking the number of days on sick leave and multiplying
it by the minimum daily wage in Spain. Finally, total costs
are calculated by adding direct and indirect costs. The util-
ities represent the rating of the patients’ quality of life on a
scale from 0 (as bad as death) to 1 (perfect health). QALYs
will be calculated using Spanish EQ-5D-5L tariffs.

First, we will use a micro-costing approach, which in-
training costs, staffing
volves careful specification of
costs, venue overheads, materials, and staff travel. Then,
following the International Society for Pharmacoeco-
nomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) core recom-
for cost-effectiveness analyses alongside
mendations
RCTs [91], we will calculate the incremental cost-utility
ratios, defined as the difference in mean costs divided by
the difference in mean QALYs. As the duration of the
study is 12 months, neither costs nor outcomes are sub-
ject to discounting. QALYs gained in each evaluation are
approximated by using the area under-the-curve tech-
nique. To gain insight into the uncertainty around the
pooled mean ICUR, we will plot
the pooled boot-
strapped cost-effect pairs on cost-utility planes. Finally,
acceptability curves will be presented which represent
the probability that the intervention is cost-effective,
given a varying threshold for the willingness to pay for
each QALY gained. The robustness of the cost-utility re-
sults will also be tested by computing distinct sensitivity
analyses. For instance, we will perform a per protocol
analysis from which the FMS patients who do not attend
at least 6 MBSR or FibroQoL sessions will be excluded.

Neuroimaging analyses
Treatment-related differences in both structural and func-
tional MRI datasets will be assessed using mass-univariate
voxelwise General Linear Models. Thus, repeated mea-
sures ANOVA functions available in SPSS will be com-
puted to examine between- and within-group effects of
treatments. A standard threshold of p < 0.05 will be
applied for ROI data, correcting for multiple comparisons.

Ethical issues
Written informed consent will be obtained from all partic-
ipants before randomisation. Participants will be provided
with a general overview of the aims and characteristics of
the study and the interventions before signing the in-
formed consent. They will also be assured that they will
be participating voluntarily and can withdraw at any time
from the study with the guarantee that they will continue
to receive the most appropriate medical treatment pre-
scribed by their general practitioner. The study will be
performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid
down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its subse-
quent updates. The FSJD Research Committee Board
evaluated and approved the study protocol in May 2015

Discussion
The study described here will evaluate, for the first time,
the cost-utility of MBSR for FMS patients compared
with usual care and with an empirically-validated inter-
vention (FibroQol) which proved to be cost-effective in
such patients in a high-quality RCT [41]. Therefore, this
is a 3-armed RCT in which we include an active control
condition (psycho-education) that permits us to control
the “frustrebo response” (disappointment among control
participants at not receiving treatment) associated with
waiting-list and TAU conditions [92]. The RCT was de-
signed following the CONSORT recommendations, the
economic evaluation was planned following the updated
ISPOR core recommendations for cost-effectiveness ana-
lyses alongside RCTs, the sample size in each study arm
is sufficiently large and the follow-up period is suffi-
ciently long to capture important costs and outcomes. If
our trial results are sufficiently robust, MBSR pro-
grammes might be delivered as part of a strategic, coher-
ent or appropriately resourced approach for patients
with FMS in the healthcare context [80, 93]. According
to Gotlink et al. [80], “further research should also look
more into the mechanisms whereby these therapies
(MBSR-MBCT) are efficacious”. In the present RCT, we
are not only interested in the clinical effects of MBSR at
long-term, but also in the “process” psychological vari-
ables and neurobiological changes that contribute to
them, which is a current source of interest and debate in
the scientific literature [89, 94].

One of the main risks in this study may be dropouts.
A sensitivity analysis using a per protocol strategy will
be performed to determine the impact of the adherence

to the protocol in both the MBSR and FibroQoL groups.
This RCT is intended to be as naturalistic as possible, so
prescribed drugs are permitted throughout the study.
The effects of these drugs on clinical and biological out-
comes may constitute another study limitation. However,
no baseline differences among study arms regarding
medical drugs are expected (due to randomisation)
and sub-analyses evaluating the potential effects of
the main pharmacological treatments (e.g., antidepres-
sants) on the outcomes will be performed. Moreover,
received pharmacological treatment may not be stable
over time (e.g., initiating antidepressant treatment due
to a depressive episode, changing principle/dose of
other drugs due to variations in clinical symptoms, or
starting individual therapy with a psychologist) so it
is probable that some patients will be excluded from
the study due to drastic changes in their treatment.
Patients will be asked at post- and follow-up assess-
ments for details about changes in medical treatment
received and the clinicians will check the pharmaco-
logical treatment history in the patients’ clinical chart.
To our knowledge, this study represents the first at-
tempt to detect structural and functional brain changes
and inflammatory marker variations after MBSR in pa-
tients with FMS. Indeed, few studies have focused on
exploration of the neural and inflammatory underpin-
nings of psychological treatments in chronic pain pa-
tients. We hope that our work will offer new advances in
understanding the psychophysiological processes altered
by mindfulness and their relationship with clinical out-
comes. Understanding of how mindfulness changes
these variables will in turn increase our understanding
of the role of the brain and the immune system in FMS.
Furthermore, determining FMS profiles according to
psychological and brain/immune variables may also
allow prediction of treatment response in patients with
this diagnosis. Given that patients with FMS usually
present comorbidities with psychiatric disorders (such as
depression or anxiety) and other central sensitivity syn-
dromes (such as chronic fatigue syndrome), the results
from this study may have translational value.
