Can mental health interventions change
social networks? A systematic review
Kimberley Anderson1, Neelam Laxhman2 and Stefan Priebe2*

Abstract

Background: Social networks of patients with psychosis can provide social support, and improve health and social
outcomes, including quality of life. However, patients with psychosis often live rather isolated with very limited
social networks. Evidence for interventions targeting symptoms or social skills, are largely unsuccessful at improving
social networks indirectly. As an alternative, interventions may directly focus on expanding networks. In this
systematic review, we assessed what interventions have previously been tested for this and to what extent they
have been effective.

Methods: A systematic review was conducted of randomised controlled trials, testing psychosocial interventions
designed to directly increase the social networks of patients with psychosis. Searches of five online databases
(PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Database, MEDLINE, Embase), hand searching of grey literature, and both forward
and backward snowballing of key papers were conducted and completed on 12 December 2014. Trial reports
were included if they were written in English, the social network size was the primary outcome, participants
were ≥ 18 years old and diagnosed with a psychotic disorder.
Results: Five studies (n = 631 patients) met the complete inclusion criteria. Studies were from different countries
and published since 2008. Four trials had significant positive results, i.e. an observable increase in patients’ social
network size at the end of the intervention. The interventions included: guided peer support, a volunteer partner
scheme, supported engagement in social activity, dog-assisted integrative psychological therapy and psychosocial
skills training. Other important elements featured were the presence of a professional, and a focus on friendships
and peers outside of services and the immediate family.
Conclusions: Despite the small number and heterogeneity of included studies, the results suggest that interventions
directly targeting social isolation can be effective and achieve a meaningful increase in patients’ networks. Thus,
although limited, the existing evidence is encouraging, and the range of interventions used in the reported trials leave
various options for future research and further improvements. Future research is needed to test the findings in different
settings, identify which components are particularly effective, and determine to what extent the increased networks,
over time, impact on patients’ symptoms and quality of life.

Background
People with psychosis frequently experience difficulties
in developing and maintaining social relationships; their
networks tend to be smaller than those of people with-
out mental illness, and are largely composed of family
members [1]. Over longer periods of time, people with
enduring psychosis often rely on healthcare services to
maintain social bonds [2].

Living alone, having few social ties and infrequent con-
tact are all indicators of social isolation [3], and the size of
social networks can be used as a measure of isolation or
connectedness. Social networks include both close, sup-
portive relationships with family and friends, as well as
more spontaneous, casual interactions with wider contacts
in the community. Pattinson & Pattinson [4] define social
networks based on the closeness and frequency of the in-
dividual social interaction, including; personal, intimate,
effective, nominal and extended zones of networks. A
greater sense of independence, better overall health and
fewer social stressors are all mediators of social networks,
and have positively been shown to have various effects on
wellbeing, including: feelings of belonging, reducing stress,
restoring hope, and increasing ability to adapt to new situ-
ations [5]; instilling feelings of trust and reciprocity [6];
providing higher community functioning [7]; increasing
engagement with mental health services [8], and improv-
ing quality of life [9].

Equally however, several factors play a role in limiting
the networks of people with psychosis. Symptoms of the
disorder,
in particular negative symptoms: anhedonia,
emotional dullness and low energy, are known to impair
the motivation and ability to establish and maintain
social relationships. Disadvantages such as unemploy-
ment and poor socio-economic status may also reduce
the opportunities to utilise social skills [10].

The challenge for mental health services is to over-
come these problems in order to help people with
psychosis build and sustain a sufficiently large social
network. The existing evidence suggests that estab-
lished treatments targeting negative symptoms largely
fail (see Carpenter and colleagues [11] for more detail
on this), although such symptoms may change over
time [12]. Thus, the evidence supporting treatments
that aim to enlarge networks indirectly–by primarily
targeting underlying symptomatology–is limited. We
therefore conducted a systematic review of randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) whose primary aim is to im-
prove the social networks of patients with psychosis, to
determine the effectiveness of existing psychosocial in-
terventions. (Prospero ID: CRD42015020540).

Methods
We intended to be inclusive with respect to the character-
istics of patients, the type of interventions and the exact

measure of social networks. Yet, the review was restricted
to studies that assessed some behavioural indicator of so-
cial networks as primary outcome. We did not consider
patients’ satisfaction or other forms of subjective appraisal
as an outcome, since such appraisals are only moderately
linked with objective measures of social networks. The
restriction to studies with social networks as primary out-
comes enabled us to avoid bias through including studies
that would selectively report secondary outcomes, and
possibly over-report outcomes showing a positive effect of
the given intervention.

Eligibility criteria
Included studies were required to have a primary out-
come measure of social network size, and were excluded
if only broader reference to social interactions was made,
or social network size was a secondary outcome meas-
ure. Studies were included if participants were recruited
from inpatient, outpatient or community mental health
care services; ≥ 50 % participants with psychosis, and at
least 18 years of age. Treatment as usual, active and wait-
list control conditions were all accepted as comparators.
There was no restriction on publication date, but due to
resource constraints we excluded those not written in
English. Reviews were excluded but their reference lists
were screened.

Search strategy
A systematic, electronic search was conducted on the da-
tabases PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase and the
Cochrane Library, and publication bias was minimised by
including conference papers and book chapters, searching
grey literature, and corresponding with authors to identify
additional work where necessary. Reference lists of key
studies and identified reviews were searched and relevant
papers obtained (backward snowballing), as well as finding
citations to studies documented (forward snowballing).
The search was completed on 12 December 2014, and
was conducted by researcher KA. A hand search for
relevant articles in key journals, such as Schizophrenia
Bulletin, British Journal of Psychiatry, Psychiatric Bulletin
and Archives of General Psychiatry, was carried out by NL.
Using a random-number generator, a 20 % check verified
eligibility of included and excluded abstracts.

The combination of terms was deliberately broad to in-
crease sensitivity of the search and identify all eligible
RCTs. The search strategy was defined as terms contain-
ing adjectives or derivatives of ‘psychosis,’ ‘social networks’
and ‘intervention’ that were combined using a series of
boolean ‘AND/OR’ operators (see Additional file 1). Spe-
cific named interventions were included following their
identification in key texts. Data extraction and quality
assessment was guided by The Cochrane Collaboration’s
Intervention Review for RCTs, and each eligible full-text

The five included studies were conducted in: Italy
(n = 347 participants), Ireland (n = 102), Netherlands
(n = 106), Spain (n = 21) and Israel (n = 55), and they
span a publication period from 2008 to 2014. There
was a total of 436 males (69 %) and a mean age of 44.2
(SD 6.0) years. Three studies took place in community
mental health settings [14–16], one in a mental health
centre (which was neither identified as inpatient nor
outpatient services) [17], and one in an inpatient facility
[18]. All studies sought and obtained ethical approval and
patient consent to participate.

Data analyses
General characteristics of the studies and participants
were extracted for each trial, as well as details on the
intervention groups, outcomes, risk of bias assessments
and data analysis. Trends in social network size before
and after the interventions were planned to be analysed
by pooling the data, and comparing standard mean dif-
ferences. However, because of the small number and
high heterogeneity of studies, a meta-analysis was pre-
vented. Instead, findings were reported narratively.

on a weekly basis, with an average number of 1.8 (SD .75)
hours per week, and with an average study follow-up
period of 11 months (SD 8.7). All studies intended to
improve contacts outside of the family. Table 1 gives an
overview of included studies.

Characteristics of interventions
Overall, the structures of the interventions tested in
these studies are highly diverse. In one trial conducted
in Italy [14], participants worked closely with clinical
staff to identify possible areas of interest and activities
they might like to take part in. This involved forming so-
cial contacts in the community; outside of their family,
mental health services and other patient groups. Partici-
pants were encouraged and supported by staff to engage
in these activities. Meetings were once a week for an
hour over a period of 3–6 months.

Another study, conducted in Ireland [15], matched
participants with volunteer partners to facilitate social
connectedness. The authors attempted a replication of a
trial previously conducted in the USA [21] (which was
excluded from this review since their primary outcome
was not social network size) and adapted their study to
include a stipend for one arm and an explicit measure of
social network size. However, due to recruitment issues,
they were only able to randomise to two arms instead
of three (volunteer + stipend, and stipend only). The
volunteer-participant pairs met for 2 h per week, and
spent time in the community together doing activities
of interest to the patient.

The Dutch trial in this review [17] delivered guided
peer support, which involved a nurse facilitating a talk-
ing group for participants with psychosis, but which was
primarily directed by the members. The group offered a
structured and continuous discussion of issues related to
mental illness. The presence of a nurse has previously
been noted as helpful for patients to develop a sense of
security and meaningfulness, while promoting group in-
teractions without actively affecting the non-specific
group processes.

The study conducted in Israel [16] tested social cogni-
tion and interaction training (SCIT), whereby participants
worked in groups to explore impairments in their social
cognitions. In addition, both the experimental and control
groups received ‘social mentoring’ which involved weekly
meetings with an individual mentor to set realistic goals
related to patients’ social
life, such as organising their
finances, enrolling on a course or engaging with the com-
munity in some way.

The final study in this review, conducted in Spain [18],
used integrative psychological therapy (IPT) as their main
care approach, which is a structured group intervention
with five distinct elements: cognitive differentiation, social
perception, verbal communication, social skills training,

and interpersonal problem solving. They additionally
combined this with the presence of a ‘therapy dog’ to the
experimental arm, as they reported that animals can have
functioning, and participants
positive effects on social
were encouraged to engage and interact with the dog
during sessions.

Control groups were variants of routine care as the
main comparator. This typically involved usual contact
with a person’s regular care team, maintaining scheduled
appointments, adhering to medication as required or at-
tending groups as per their normal programme.

Effects of interventions
Four out of five studies [14, 16–18] in this review success-
fully report significant increases in social network size.
This equates to a 45.5 % increase in social network size
for the Italian study [14], who found no further statistically
significant improvements in their secondary outcomes:
clinical information, activities of daily living and work; and
a 56 % increase for the Dutch study [17], who also indicate
significant improvements in self-esteem and quality of life
for those who regularly attended their peer support
groups. For the Israeli study on SCIT, a significant, albeit
small, increase in interpersonal communication scores at
the end of the intervention was found (2.9 % increase),
and Vilalta-Gil and colleagues demonstrated a significant
positive increase in the social contact score of the Living
Skills Profile (p = .041). Lastly, Sheridan and colleagues in
Ireland [15] indicated a trend towards increased social
network size at
the intervention period
(2 years)–a 7 % improvement–but these results were not
found to be statistically significant. Although overall most
outcomes indicated trends towards symptom reduction
and increases in personal strengths, only those cited were
statistically significant. It was not possible to ascertain
what these figures represent in terms of size of social
network (see Additional file 2 for a summary).

Social network assessment tools
A wide variety of assessments were used to measure social
networks across the five trials; in fact no two trials used
the same tool. Three trials used explicit counting methods
to measure number of contacts within participants’ social
network, and of these only the volunteer partnership study
[15] used a validated tool–the Practitioner Assessment of
Network Type [22]. Although the other two did not use
established measures to assess the network size, they were
similar in their counting methods. The guided peer sup-
port study [17] used the Personal Network Questionnaire
(PNQ), a self-developed measure to record frequency and
importance of relationships; and the social activities study
[14] had a basic scoring system for the type of relation-
ships and the frequency of encounters. For these studies,

higher scores were interpreted as more contacts/greater
social network.

The further two trials [16, 18] used relevant subscales
within validated measures. The Social Functioning Scale
(SFS) [23] and Living Skills Profile (LSP) [24] respectively,
are both tools designed specifically for patients with
schizophrenia. For the SFS, ‘interpersonal communication’
was used in this instance to measure the size of the partic-
ipants’ social network and the ability to effectively interact
with others. For the LSP, higher scores within the ‘social
contact’ item also indicate better social engagement. Al-
though these do not ‘count’ the number of contacts in
the same way the previous measures do, they are be
considered to capture the social network size.

Quality of included studies
Overall, the studies included in this review did not indi-
cate high risk of bias, although there appear to be some
problems with the quality of reporting, and with rigorous
blinding.

All except the Israeli SCIT study [14, 15, 17, 18] were
allocated to treatment arm by automated computer or
telephone service, and were rated as having a low risk
of randomisation bias. All studies took precautionary
measures to ensure the assignment of participants to
treatment arms was not affected by selection bias: in-
cluding balancing allocation by telephone according to
site, using independent personnel to carry out random-
isation, using sealed envelopes and weighted recruit-
ment sites so each participant had equal chance of
being randomised to experimental group. Blinding of
participants across trials was generally not employed,
likely due to the nature of psychosocial interventions
whereby participants are aware of new or additional
care approaches they are part of.

The Italian social activities and Irish volunteer partner-
ship studies [15, 16] were rated as high risk of bias for
blinding of assessors. Reasons for this include the absence
of blinding procedures overall, revelation of group alloca-
tion by participants during data collection, or failing to
blind independent personnel. For missing outcome data,
only the Italian social activities and Dutch guided peer
support studies [15, 16] reported how missing data was
dealt with. The remaining studies failed to convey why

missing data occurred or how this was managed in their
analyses, and therefore no judgement could be made.
Table 2 provides an overview of this.

Discussion
This review examined interventions to improve social
networks for patients with psychosis, and assessed the
effectiveness of these. To our knowledge, no review has
previously explored this. It was achieved through a de-
tailed systematic search of existing literature, and all
available randomised controlled trials with an objective
primary outcome measure of social network size were
included. In total, only five studies met the specific in-
clusion criteria–albeit with a substantial total participant
sample size of 631. Four out of the five studies reported
statistically significant improvements in the social net-
works of patients following their interventions. It may
be concluded that despite some recent therapeutic pes-
simism with regard to improving social outcomes for
this patient group [25], interventions directly targeting
social connectedness appear promising.

Nevertheless, the small number (more than half of
the included patients were from one multi-centre trial
in Italy), and heterogeneity of studies, with no two
studies testing similar interventions, limits the robust-
ness of the conclusions. Equally, the heterogeneity of
assessment tools makes comparison difficult, a concern
of social network measures captured previously by
Gayer-Anderson & Morgan [26].

Interpretation
Aspects of guided peer support, community participa-
tion and engagement, skills training and animal-assisted
IPT feature across the interventions in the positive trials,
whereas a volunteer partnership scheme had less
favourable results. This suggests that different interven-
tions, including some that are potentially not very inten-
sive or costly, might have a similar effect and help to
promote and foster social interactions that constitute a
social network. The presence of a professional within
the interventions, regardless of their specific defined
role, appears to be an important factor for increasing so-
cial networks. These professionals may act as potential

mediators between formal interactions with healthcare
services and more casual links in the community.

The included studies featured mostly patients with a
duration of illness of several years, and the target groups
were those who had already lost relationships and often
lived rather isolated. The findings of the review suggest
that interventions may still be helpful with such patients,
and that long periods of isolation are not necessarily a
reason for pessimism as to whether patients’ networks
can be increased. However, one may also speculate as to
whether supporting patients’ ability to maintain social
networks at an earlier stage of their illness–e.g. though
interventions as included in this review-might be effect-
ive in avoiding social isolation later on.

Whilst the consideration of families varied across the
interventions, all of them aimed to improve contacts
outside of the family. Treatments of patients with psych-
osis traditionally emphasise family links, e.g.
though
psycho-education programmes with key relatives and
family therapy. Yet, patients might benefit from inter-
ventions with a broader remit that help to establish and
maintain wider contacts in the community. It may be
more feasible to work on new contacts rather than chan-
ging family relationships and improving already existing
friendships after many years of illness.

All studies were published since 2008, suggesting a re-
cent and possibly increasing interest in such social inter-
ventions in the scientific community. The interest might
reflect a disappointment about the effectiveness of more
conventional pharmacological and psychological interven-
tions in the treatment of patients with psychosis and a
search for new holistic approaches. The recent publication
of these trials might also indicate that social networks
have become more interesting as a target for interventions
and as treatment outcomes. Future research can add to
the findings reported in this review if further trials are
conducted with the social network size as the primary
outcome.

The findings are encouraging and point towards ave-
nues for future research. Replication is needed through
methodologically rigorous trials. Process evaluations, ex-
planatory trials and cost-effectiveness analyses should
help to identify which components are effective, efficient
and particularly acceptable to patients, and to what ex-
tent the relevant components are consistent or different
across interventions. All this can inform the develop-
ment of intervention models for the future, which may
be advancements of the interventions considered in this
review or select and combine components of different
interventions to design new and even more beneficial
methods for increasing networks. Longer term follow-up
studies should explore whether the gains in social net-
works are sustained over time, what support, if any, is
required from health care services for this, and whether

the improved networks indeed impact on patients’ symp-
toms and quality of life.

Strengths and limitations
Although the included studies were heterogeneous in vari-
ous respects, they all met the inclusion criteria; particu-
larly using a behavioural measure of the social network
size as the primary outcome. The number of trials is small,
despite the substantial total number of patients of more
than 600. The fact that the trials are from different coun-
tries, settings and tested very different interventions may
be seen as a limitation. Yet, four out of these five studies
yielded a significant positive finding, which may indicate
that improvements of social networks can indeed be
achieved with a range of interventions and in different
contexts.

However, limitations of note are that only papers written
in English were considered; that no meta-analysis could
be performed; that we included studies with insufficient
reports of study details; and that none of the studies re-
ported an economic analysis of the costs and benefits of
the intervention. Nevertheless, the limitation to studies
using social network size as the primary outcome avoids
reporting bias, which would have been inevitable with the
inclusion of studies using social networks as one out of
many secondary outcomes.

Conclusions
Large numbers of people with psychosis remain isolated,
disengaged from local activities, and socially withdrawn
for long periods. The extent to which mental health ser-
vices in different countries regard improving the social
network of patients as a core task is likely to vary.
Nevertheless, this review suggests that such improve-
ments are possible when social activities are targeted dir-
ectly rather than indirectly through symptom control.
