Background: Flourishing is related to positive outcomes for physical and mental health, as
well as overall wellbeing. The aim of the present study was to determine the validity and
reliability of the Flourishing Scale (FS) among a sample of older participants in Iran.
Methods: In this validation study, 300 older people were selected by cluster sampling
method. Data were collected using a checklist for demographic characteristics, the FS, and
the Oxford happiness questionnaire. The validity (face, content, convergent, and construct)
and reliability (Cronbach’s alpha, test-retest) of the FS was evaluated in this cross-sectional
study.
Results: The exploratory factor analysis demonstrated a one-dimensional structure consist-
ing of 8 items with an eigenvalue of 3.583. The model had a good ﬁt [χ2 = 52.983, p < 0.001,
χ2/df = 2.944, GFI = 0.958, CFI = 0.915, IFI = 0.949, TLI = 0.919, AGFI = 0.948, and
RMSEA = 0.081, SRMR = 0.086] with all factor loadings greater than 0.5 and statistically
signiﬁcant. A test of concurrent validity showed a direct and signiﬁcant association between
the FS and the Oxford happiness questionnaire (r = 0.647, p < 0.001). The results of the
reliability tests conﬁrmed that the values of Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient (0.819) and test-
retest (0.821) were acceptable.
Conclusion: The Persian version of the FS demonstrated suitable validity and reliability
among a sample of older participants.

Introduction
There is a growing body of literature that recognises the importance of successful
and positive aging to cater to the growing aging population experienced by most
countries around the world.1–4 According to estimates, older people 65 years and
over have an annual global growth rate of 2.5% per year.5 About two thirds of the
world’s older people now live in developing countries such as Iran.6 According to
Iran’s 2016 census of population and housing, 9.3% of the population is 60 years or
older.7 The rapid increase in the number of older people creates important concerns,
especially in relation to their wellbeing and mental health, and how practitioners
and clinicians can best support the strengths of a growing older population.8

Mental health and wellbeing are widely recognized as imperative dimensions of
positive aging.9 Assisting people to ﬂourish in the later stages of life has been found
to have a positive impact on moderating depression, as well as increasing happiness
and life satisfaction.10 Positive psychology – that is, the scientiﬁc study of human
ﬂourishing and an applied approach to optimal functioning – is a growing ﬁeld of
scientiﬁc enquiry.11,12 Positive psychology is concerned with human abilities and

strengths and seeks to improve wellbeing through increas-
ing positive feelings, behaviours, and thoughts, such as
happiness, enjoyment, and optimism.13 Positive psychol-
ogy interventions have been applied to a variety of con-
texts, including aged care, in order to help individuals
thrive and improve their subjective wellbeing.14

emotional,

and cognitive

Subjective wellbeing has been described as an indivi-
dual’s perception of the quality of their life and includes
components.15
behavioral,
According to Diener16 subjective wellbeing has a wide
variety of causal inﬂuences and is related to positive affect
and life satisfaction and includes dimensions of happiness,
purposefulness, and vitality. The feeling of vitality is clo-
sely linked to happiness and is one of the most important
human experiences.17 Vitality is directly related to life
satisfaction and inversely related to anxiety, depression,
and other physical and mental disorders.18

Flourishing is a state of optimal functioning synon-
ymous with high levels of positive emotions, wellbeing,
mental health, and psychological and social wellbeing.19,20
Researchers have found human ﬂourishing to have a range
of beneﬁts related to psychological and physical health,
including reduced risk mortality.21,22 Therefore, the litera-
ture provides sufﬁcient evidence for nurses and other
healthcare professionals to be attuned to strategies and
interventions that promote ﬂourishing amongst older
adults.23

In the literature, several measures are available for
ﬂourishing assessment. The Flourishing Scale (FS)24 is
one of the most commonly used scales to examine ﬂour-
ishing. The scale consists of 8 items and is applicable to
people 12 years or older.25 One of the beneﬁts of this scale
is that it is short and ﬂuent with plain-language items that
facilitate comprehension and suitability for older popula-
tions. In most of the studies that have been conducted on
the FS, the sample consisted of adults or young adults.26–30
In our knowledge, only two studies speciﬁcally assessed
the validity and reliability of the FS in an older adult
sample.31,32 Momtaz, Hamid, Haron & Bagat32 and
Didino, Taran, Baryshev & Casati31 conducted studies on
samples of community-dwelling older Malaysians and
Russians, respectively. They found that the Russian and
Malaysian version of the FS seemed to have good psycho-
metric properties and could serve as a valid and reliable
to evaluate ﬂourishing among Russian and
instrument
Malaysian older adults.

In addition to the research conducted on the cultural
differences in the way ﬂourishing is perceived and

understood,33 the psychometric properties of the FS have
been studied in several countries including Spain,26
China,34 the Netherlands,27 Japan,28 Turkey,35 Portugal,29
New Zealand,36 Singapore,24 Malaysia,32 Russia,31 and
Italy37 with efﬁcacious results. In Iran, the validity and
reliability of this scale has been evaluated among Isfahan

instrument

Given that previous research has demonstrated that
cultural inﬂuences play a signiﬁcant role in people’s per-
ceptions of ﬂourishing,33 it is necessary to validate the
ﬂourishing measurement
in Iran as well.
A limited number of studies have been conducted to eval-
uate ﬂourishing in Iranian older adults.15,38 These studies
used the Ryan and Frederick subjective vitality scale for
measuring ﬂourishing, and no prior
to the
authors’ knowledge, has psychometrically evaluated the
FS in Iranian older adults. Therefore, the current study
addresses this issues by providing the ﬁrst validation of
the FS in a sample of older participants in Iran. The level
of psychological well-being in older adults is probably
related to the local socio-economic and cultural situation
and thus different countries could show different patterns.

Methods
In this validation study, 300 older people were selected
using a multi-stage cluster sampling technique. In the ﬁrst
stage, the Qazvin city was divided into 5 clusters: North,
South, East, West, and Center. Next, one mosque and one
park were randomly selected from each cluster. Eligible
older people were selected from these places using con-
venience sampling method. Participants were required to
be 60 years or older and hold Iranian citizenship to be
included in the study. Participants who reported having
psychiatric problems (eg, Alzheimer’s disease or other
forms of dementia), a physical disability or limitation
(eg, conﬁnement to bed or wheel chair use), or terminal
illness, were excluded from the study.

For a conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA), 10 subjects
per item, a minimum sample size of 300, and a KMO > 0.6
is acceptable.39,40 The Oxford happiness questionnaire with
29 items had the most items among the scales used in the
study. This indicates that 290 (29x10) subjects are needed
for the Oxford happiness questionnaire. As this number is
fewer than the minimum required for a CFA, 300 partici-
pants were used in this study. Furthermore, the KMO value
was 0.852, indicating that the data and sample size were

participants were recruited to supply a ﬁnal sample size of
300. The study had a 90% response rate and 10% of the
participants (N= 30) felt tired and did not answer all the
questions. Sampling continued until 300 participants were
recruited in order
the uncompleted
to make up for
responses. Data were collected through face-to-face inter-
views in the study places (mosques and parks) from April to
August 2017 by one researcher.

Instruments
Data were collected through the use of a socio-demographic
checklist, the FS, and the Oxford happiness questionnaire.
The socio-demographic checklist elicited information from
participants that
included age, gender, marital status,
employment details, and educational background.

The Flourishing Scale
Flourishing was measured by the FS which was developed
by Diener et al (2010). The FS is an eight-item scale that has
been designed to measure wellbeing in the domains of
relationships,
life purpose, self-esteem, and optimism.
This scale assesses eudemonic dimensions of wellbeing.
All 8 items of the scale are expressed in a positive direction
and the responses are based on a 7-point Likert scale, ran-
ging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” A higher
score indicates higher levels of respondents’ wellbeing.24,36
The present study employed the use of the Persian ver-
sion of the FS that was translated by Moradi Siah Afshadi M,
Ghasemi30 based on World Health Organization protocol.

The Oxford happiness questionnaire
The Oxford happiness questionnaire was developed by
Hills and Argyle (2002)42 at Oxford University to measure
psychological wellbeing. It consists of 29 items rated on
a 5-point Likert-type scale. According to Hone et al (2014),
a total score of 48 or above is considered high.36 In the
present study, the FS demonstrated an excellent internal
reliability of consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.95).

Face Validity Assessment
The face validity of the Persian version of the FS was
evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. In order to
evaluate the qualitative face validity of the Persian version
of the FS, ten older adults assessed and commented on the
appropriateness and relevance of the items.43 The scale
was corrected according to their comments.

To assess the quantitative face validity, ten older adults
were asked to determine the importance of the items on

a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from “not important”
to “completely important”. The item impact score of the
items was measured by using the following formula:
impact score = frequency × importance. In this formula,
frequency is equal to the number of older people who
regard each item as “important” or “completely impor-
tant”, noted by scores of ‘4ʹ and ‘5ʹ, respectively. If the
impact score of the item was greater than 1.5, the item was
suitable and was therefore maintained in the scale.44

Content Validity Assessment
The content validity of the Persian version of the FS was
evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. For the
qualitative content validity assessment, the Persian version
of the FS was provided to ﬁfteen experts in sociology,
gerontology, psychology, and educational nursing, and
they were requested to give feedback on the items of the
scale in terms of wording, item allocation, grammar, and
scaling.45 A ﬁnal version of the scale was created after
applying their comments.

The Content Validity Ratio (CVR) and the Content
Validity Index (CVI) were used for the quantitative content
validity analysis. CVR reﬂects whether the items are essen-
tial or not. Accordingly, ﬁfteen experts were requested to
rate the essentiality of the FS items on a 3-point Likert-type
scale consisting of “not essential”, “useful but not essen-
tial”, and “essential”. A higher score of CVR indicates
greater agreement among the experts. The formula for the
CVR is: CVR = (Ne – N/2)/(N/2), where Ne is the number
of experts indicating an item as “essential” and N is the total
number of experts.43,46 According to Lawshe (1975), the
minimum acceptable value for CVR is 0.49 when the num-
ber of experts is ﬁfteen.47

The Items Content Validity Index (I-CVI) shows the
degree to which the items of the intended scale are
relevant. At the item level, I-CVI is calculated from the
number of experts who rate the item as either a 3 or 4 on
likert scale, divided by the total number of
a 4-point
experts. Judgment on each item is made as follows:
when the number of experts is ﬁfteen, the I-CVI value
of 0.79 or greater shows the item to be appropriate;
between 0.70 and 0.79, it needs revision; and less than
0.70, it is eliminated.48 The CVR and I-CVI for the FS
items are presented in Table 1.

Construct Validity Assessment
The construct validity of the Persian version of the FS was
assessed by conducting an exploratory factor analysis (EFA)

with Varimax rotation. First, the adequacy of using EFA was
assessed through the Kaier-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) criterion
and the Bartlett Sphericity test. Recommended KMO values
should be equal to or above 0.60, and the Bartlett Chi-Square
test should be statistically signiﬁcant to support this type of
statistical analysis.49 The number of components was deter-
mined based on eigenvalues and a scree plot. Items with
absolute loading values of 0.30 or greater were regarded as
appropriate.50 Second, a conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA)
was carried out to conﬁrm the EFA. Due to the covariance
matrix, Maximum Likelihood (ML) method was adopted.
Reporting multiple ﬁt indices to estimate the good-ﬁtting
models is necessary to evaluate consistency among different
indices.49 Various indices to evaluate ﬁt were used: Chi-
Square (χ2), Chi-Square/degrees of freedom (χ2/df); an
adjusted model showing a value between 2 and 3, although
values up to 5 can be accepted as evidence of adequacy; GFI
and AGFI (values near 0.90 are recommended); CFI, values
close to or higher than 0.90 suggest an adequate ﬁt; TLI,
values close to 1.00 are satisfactory, but those between 0.80
and 0.90 are also acceptable; SRMR, values less than 0.5 are
considered satisfactory, however values close to 0.8 may also
be acceptable; and RMSEA, values between 0.05 and 0.08
are recommended, accepting those up to 0.10.51

Reliability Assessment
The reliability of the Persian FS was assessed by calculat-
ing Cronbach’s alpha and test-retest.

participants were
informed about the objectives, procedures, potential ben-
eﬁts, and drawbacks of the study. Furthermore, they were
instructed that participation was voluntary and that con-
ﬁdentiality of the obtained information was guaranteed.
The participant consent was written informed consent and
this
study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.

Statistical Analysis
We used Statistical Package for Social Sciences version
21.0 software for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics for
Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp., USA)
and AMOS for statistical calculations. The normal distri-
butions of the data were examined and approved by skew-
ness and kurtosis.

Results
The mean age of the participants of the present study was
66.1±6.5 years old, ranging from 60 to 98. The majority of
the participants were male (N = 164, 54.7%), married (N =
236, 78.7%), retired (N = 135, 45.0%), and literate (N =
241, 80.3%) (Table 2).

Table 3 reports the results of the Exploratory Factor
Analysis (EFA) of the 300 participants. The Kaiser-Meyer-
Olkin value (KMO = 0.852) and the results of Bartlett’s
test of sphericity (691.796, df = 28, p < 0.001) indicated
that the data were suitable for conducting the EFA. Using
the scree plot (Figure 1) and eigenvalue >1 criteria, the
EFA revealed one factor comprised of 8 items, accounting
for 44.792% of the variance.

As reported in Table 3, Cronbach’s alpha (0.819)
demonstrated good internal consistency among the items.
The result of the test–retest reliability (0.821) was also in
the acceptable range.

The results of a Pearson correlation analysis showed
a signiﬁcant positive relationship between the FS and the
Oxford happiness questionnaire (r = 0.647, p < 0.001),
providing support for the concurrent validity of the scale.

Figure 2 The ﬁnal structural model of the Persian version of the FS among a sample of older adults in Iran.

A CFA model was applied to determine the validity of
the Persian version of the FS in the present study. The
results showed that all ﬁtness indicators were in suitable
ranges in line with previous research. Giuntoli et al37
reported good ﬁtness characteristics for the Italian version
of the FS. However, the CFA of the Bahasa Melayu ver-
sion of the FS indicated satisfactory model ﬁt for older
people after modifying the model by correlating the
errors.32 Furthermore, in a study among Russian older
adults, the model showed a better ﬁt after error correla-
tions were used, and all indices had satisfactory values
within the acceptable range.31 Tong and Wang (2017)34
showed a better ﬁt after the modiﬁcation index using one
error covariance in the Chinese version of the FS.

In the present study, items 2 (“My social relationships
are supportive and rewarding”) and 8 (“People respect
me”) showed the lowest factor loadings. Similarly, in the
study by Hassani and Nadi (2015), these two items showed
the lowest factor loading compared to the other items of
the scale.25 The weak factor loading on item 2 can be due
to the ambiguity of this question, which may result in the
participants interpreting the phrases in different ways.
Regarding item 8, it may be related to the Iranian culture,
which believes that a positive response to this question is
a sign of selﬁshness and being far from humble. Because
of this, respondents-especially older people – may refuse
to give a truthful answer.

Item 3, “I am engaged and interested in my daily
activities”, had the highest factor loading (0.76), as those
who feel more energetic are more likely to engage in daily
activities, and would be expected to perceive physical
activity as easier. Likewise, Ju (2017) indicated that phy-
sical activity was positively associated with both meaning
in life and subjective vitality.52 Other research has shown
that participation in a physical activity program has posi-
tive effects on participants’ sense of vitality due to the
mediation of physical functioning.53

The results of this study showed a signiﬁcant and direct
correlation between ﬂourishing and happiness that is con-
sistent with the results of studies by Keshavarz et al
(2005)18 and Diener et al (2010).24 One reason for this
ﬁnding may be that both constructs (ﬂourishing and happi-
ness) are associated with positive emotions. Also, it has
been established that ﬂourishing increases happiness
through improving physical health, mobility, mental
health, and social functioning.18 Therefore, using the FS
could be an appropriate alternative to the Oxford happi-
ness questionnaire in the ﬁeld of older adult research.

The results of the present study showed that the relia-
bility tests (Cronbach’s alpha and test-retest) were in the
acceptable ranges. It is clear that when Cronbach’s alpha is
closer to 1, the internal consistency of the items will be
more homogeneous. It also indicates the scale’s items are

conceptual dispersion. In previous studies on different age
groups in Singapore,24 New Zealand,36 France,54 Italy,55
Japan,28 Turkey,35 Portugal,29 and Iran,25,30 Cronbach’s
alpha coefﬁcients were reported from 0.80 to 0.91, which
is within the acceptable range (ie, above 0.7). Therefore, it
can be assumed that the items of the scale assess a similar
ﬂourishing concept. The test–retest reliability was 0.70
with a two-week interval, which is in accordance with
the results of the study by Diener et al (2010) in the
USA (0.70), which was performed with a one-month
interval.24 Furthermore, the test-retest of another study in
Japan (2014) on 336 students aged 18 to 24 years with
a one-month interval was equal to 0.87.28 Hassani and
Nadi (2015) estimated the test–retest reliability coefﬁcient
of a vitality questionnaire to be 0.83 on 103 students with
a two-week interval.25 As a whole, the results of all pre-
vious studies showed the optimal level of test–retest relia-
bility. The difference in the amount of correlation
coefﬁcients in the aforementioned studies can be attributed
to the sample under investigation, as the cognitive func-
tioning of the students may be signiﬁcantly better than
older participants.

Limitations
The sample of this study was comprised of community-d-
welling older adults, which limits the potential to generalize
the results to older people living in institutions. A second
limitation of the study relates to the use of self-report ques-
tionnaires to elicit information from participants. Although
partially addressed through inclusion criteria, the cognitive
capacity of respondents at the time the study took place may
have had some inﬂuence on the results of the study. Another
limitation of the study is that only the older people in public
places such as parks and mosques were studied, and those
unable to be present in these places (eg, due to illness or
disability) were not examined. It is also reasonable to sug-
gest the older adults residing in the city of Qazvin may not
necessarily represent all older adults in Iran.

Future Research
Findings of the present study suggest the FS is an efﬁ-
cacious tool for evaluating ﬂourishing in older popula-
tions in Iran. Given that the tool can be used for children
as young as 12, future research should consider evaluat-
ing the psychometric properties of the Persian version of
the tool for Iranian youth. There has been no previous
research that has investigated this cohort and a reliable
and valid measure of this type has great potential for

informing proactive interventions concerned with mental
health and wellbeing in secondary school.56,57 There is
also growing evidence on the role of euthymia on posi-
tive aging and ﬂourishing.58,59 Therefore, it is suggested
that future studies use the FS in conjunction with the
Euthymia Scale. Additionally, the clinimetric properties
of the FS, consisting of clinical validity, utility, sensitiv-
ity, and scalability were not evaluated in this study. It is
suggested that future studies evaluate the clinimetric
features of the FS, as this scale can be reasonably used
amongst older adults in a clinical setting.

Conclusions
This study conﬁrmed adequate psychometric properties and
factor structure of the FS in a sample of older Iranian
participants. Findings suggest that the scale can be used as
a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of ﬂourishing
experienced by Iranian older adults. The ease of implemen-
tation (and brief number of items) provides researchers and
clinicians with a time-saving tool that could be used exten-
sively to assess human ﬂourishing in Iran.

Acknowledgments
We would like to extend our deep gratitude to the older
