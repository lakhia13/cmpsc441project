Abstract

Aim: Our study aimed to investigate the caregiving burden and its associated factors 

in family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia.

Design: Correlational study.

Method:  Using  the  convenience  sampling  method,  215  caregivers  were  recruited 

from  outpatient  clinics  affiliated  with  a  tertiary  referral  psychiatric  hospital  in  Iran. 

The  caregiving  burden  was  measured  by  the  Zarit  Burden  Interview  (ZBI- 22),  and 

associations between caregiving burden and potential factors were examined using 

multiple regression analysis. We used the STROBE checklist to report the results.

Results: Family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia reported a high level of car-

egiving  burden,  with  38.2%  of  the  caregivers  perceiving  severe  burden  relating  to 

their role. In the regression analysis, age, gender, educational level, income, job loss 

due to caregiving,  relationship  with  patient,  disease duration and  frequency of  car-

egiving were statistically significant predictors of caregiving burden. The regression 

model explained 54.4% of the variance of caregiving burden.

The  demographic  characteristics  of  caregivers  and  patients 

are  presented  in  Table  1.  The  mean  age  of  participants  was 

41.03 ± 10.82 years. More participants were female (57.0%), studied 
up  to  high  school  (32.0%),  and  the  spouse  of  the  patient  (52.0%), 

and  perceived  their  income  as  inadequate  (60.44%).  Most  of  the 

participants were unemployed (57.0%) and 29.3% lost their job due 

to  caregiving  responsibilities.  The  average  disease  duration  was 

13.24 ± 4.66  years,  and  57.0%  of  participants  provided  caregiving 
for more than ten years (57.0%), with 48.4% of participants provid-

ing  caregiving  continuously  and  daily.  Patients  were  mainly  male 

(72.0%), with an average age of 43.24 ± 14.32 years and an average 
disease duration of 26.46 ± 9.14 years.

nia with those who provided caregiving to patients with a general 

medical condition in India, Stanley et al. (2017) found that the car-

egiving  burden  was  significantly  higher  in  caregivers  of  patients 

with schizophrenia.

Compared  to  previous  studies,  caregivers  in  our  study  expe-

rienced  an  alarmingly  higher  burden  concerning  their  caregiving 

role. According to the results of a systematic review, the caregiver 

burden  in  chronic  mental  diseases,  mainly  schizophrenia,  is  at  a 

moderate- to- severe level (Yükü & Derleme, 2017). Similarly, a study 

on a predominantly African ancestry population reported caregiv-

et  al.,  2016).  In  a  study  in  Pakistan,  only  15.83%  of  caregivers  of 

patients with serious mental illness experienced a severe caregiving 

burden (Siddiqui & Khalid, 2019), while this proportion was 38.27% 

in  our  study.  This  high  caregiving  burden  among  caregivers  of  pa-

tients  with  schizophrenia  calls  for  attention  and  action  by  mental 

healthcare services in Iran. This finding may be partially explained
