Abstract

Objective—Although the majority of individuals with panic disorder first present to the primary
care setting, little is known about the psychiatric treatment primary care patients with the disorder
typically receive. The purpose of the current study was to explore characteristics of treatment
received by those with panic disorder with and without agoraphobia, examine demographic and
clinical predictors of receiving treatment, and explore treatment barriers.

Methods—This study uses data from the Primary Care Anxiety Project (PCAP), which is a
naturalistic, longitudinal study of anxiety disorders in primary care patients. This study presents
data on 235 PCAP participants diagnosed with panic disorder with (N=150) or without
agoraphobia (N=85) at the study intake assessment.

Results—Many patients with panic disorder were not receiving psychiatric treatment at study
intake, with those without agoraphobia being less likely to receive treatment. Psychotropic
medications were the treatment of choice, with SSRIs/SNRIs being the most commonly received
class of medications. Only 39% of those with panic disorder with agoraphobia and 24% of those
without agoraphobia were receiving psychotherapy, and use of empirically supported interventions
was rare. The most common treatment barriers were: not believing in utilizing medication/therapy
for emotional problems and not receiving a treatment recommendation from one’s provider.

Conclusions—The findings suggest a need for better treatment dissemination, in addition to
making interventions more accessible and/or adapting them to the particular needs of primary care
patients.

Panic disorder is fairly common, with a 12-month prevalence rate of 2.7% and a lifetime rate
of 4.7% (1,2). The course of panic disorder tends to be chronic, with high rates of recurrence
after remission, particularly for panic disorder with agoraphobia (3-5). Furthermore,
individuals with panic disorder experience considerable impairment and disability, including
occupational difficulties (6-9), impaired well-being (10-12), and reduced quality of life
(9-14). They also have higher rates of healthcare utilization, with a greater number of
outpatient visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations than those without the disorder
(8,10,15).

Individuals with panic disorder typically present to the primary care setting, with estimates
suggesting that as many as 80% of cases first present to primary care (16). Thus, the rate of
the disorder is higher in primary care settings, with a reported median prevalence of 4% to
6% (8). Furthermore, the majority of individuals with panic disorder obtain their mental

health treatment in the primary care setting (17,18). Despite these findings, research
suggests that panic disorder often goes unrecognized (19,20), and inadequately treated in
both primary care (8,21-23) and psychiatric settings (24-26).

A number of effective pharmacologic treatments for panic disorder exist, including tricyclic
antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and benzodiazepines (27-30). Likewise,
psychosocial treatments, namely cognitive-behavioral therapy (30,31) and possibly a
specific form of psychoanalytic treatment (32), have been found to be effective. Despite this,
estimates suggest that over 40% of individuals with panic disorder go untreated (33). Certain
demographic (e.g., gender, education, race) and clinical variables (e.g., comorbid diagnoses)
appear to be related to mental health service utilization in general (34-36). Additionally,
there may be other factors that impact service utilization, such as not perceiving oneself in
need of treatment (37). For individuals with panic disorder who do receive treatment, little is
known about the treatment typically received, and no studies have examined whether there
are differences in treatment between those with panic disorder with versus without
agoraphobia.

This study uses data from the Primary Care Anxiety Project (PCAP), which is a naturalistic,
longitudinal study of anxiety disorders in primary care patients. The purpose of the current
study was to explore characteristics of psychiatric treatment received by those with panic
disorder with versus without agoraphobia, including the rates of receiving different
psychotropic medications and specific psychotherapeutic techniques. This study also sought
to examine demographic and clinical predictors of receiving psychotropic medications,
psychotherapy, and concurrent medication and therapy. Finally, this study provides
descriptive information concerning reasons for not receiving treatment.

The current study was part of the Primary Care Anxiety Project (PCAP), a naturalistic,
longitudinal study of anxiety disorders in primary care patients. Participants were recruited
from 15 primary care, internal medicine, and family medicine clinics in New England,
which included 10 sites in urban or suburban areas and five in rural areas, with four of the
sites being in small, private practices, four in university affiliated clinics, and seven in large
teaching hospitals. Participant recruitment occurred between July 1997 and May 2001.

The entire PCAP sample consists of 539 participants with one or more of the following
index anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder with or without
agoraphobia, agoraphobia without a history of panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder,
social phobia, mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder features
occurring within a mood disorder. Inclusion criteria required participants to be English-
speaking, at least 18 years of age, and scheduled for a medical appointment on a day of
study recruitment. Participants were excluded for active psychosis, current pregnancy, or no
current address or telephone number. The current study reports data from 235 individuals
with panic disorder with (N=150) or without agoraphobia (N=85) at intake.

Research assistants approached all patients in primary care waiting rooms during times of
recruitment and asked if they were interested in participating in a study of stress or
nervousness. The number of days per week, particular days of the week, and times of the
day for study recruitment varied based on the availability of research assistants. A complete
description of the study was provided to potential participants and written informed consent

was obtained. PCAP was approved by the institutional review board of Brown University
and all other sites. Of the 14,320 patients who were approached, 31% (N=4383) were
interested in participating and completed the anxiety screening questionnaire. Of those who
completed the questionnaire, 63% (N=2755) screened positive for anxiety symptoms. These
individuals were then invited to participate in an intake assessment, which included the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) (38). Of those invited to complete the
intake assessment, 456 declined participation and 665 repeatedly cancelled or failed to show
up to the appointment. Thus, the SCID-IV was administered to a total of 1634 individuals,
with those who had one or more index disorder being invited to participate in PCAP (39,40).
After the intake assessment, participants were contacted to complete follow-up assessments
at 6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter.

Anxiety screening questionnaire—The anxiety screening questionnaire, which was
developed specifically for PCAP, is a self-report instrument containing 32 items assessing
essential features of anxiety disorders. It was designed to be highly sensitive to the presence
of any anxiety disorder symptoms in order to reduce the number of false negatives. In a
separate validation study of this measure, it was found to have sensitivity of 1.0 and a
specificity of .67, with no individuals who screened negative on the questionnaire being
found to have an anxiety disorder on the SCID-IV (39).

Diagnostic clinical interview—All psychiatric diagnoses were established by means of
an in-person diagnostic interview using the SCID-IV (38). The SCID-IV is a well-validated
assessment instrument that has been found to have excellent interrater reliability and
diagnostic accuracy (41). For PCAP, participants first completed the psychotic screener
followed by the anxiety disorders module. Participants who received an anxiety diagnosis
then completed the mood, alcohol and substance use, and eating disorders modules. As part
of the interview, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores were assigned. All
interviewers had at least a bachelor’s degree in psychology and underwent a rigorous, multi-
stage training program employed in other large-scale studies conducted through the Brown
Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior.

Mental health treatment—Information regarding psychotropic medication usage was
obtained using the Psychotropic/Auxiliary Drug Treatment Schedule, which is an
interviewer-administered form about current medications. It is part of the Longitudinal
Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE) (42), which has been found have excellent interrater
reliability and long-term test-retest reliability (43). Participants were asked about
psychotherapy currently being received using the Types of Mental Health Treatment form,
which is an interviewer-administered measure developed for PCAP that assesses
involvement in various types of psychosocial treatments. Information regarding specific
therapeutic techniques utilized was obtained using the Psychosocial Treatment Interview-
Revised (PTI-R) (44). The PTI-R, an interviewer-administered measure, assesses whether 39
techniques have been utilized in their therapy. It includes a number of therapy techniques,
including supportive, dynamic (e.g., discuss childhood experiences, patient-therapist
relationship), family systems (e.g., examine problems from a systemic approach, change
family interactions), relaxation, exposure (e.g., imaginal, interoceptive, in vivo), and
cognitive therapy techniques (e.g., identify dysfunctional thinking, substitute more rational
thoughts). The PTI-R has been found to have good interrater reliability and validity (44).

Treatment not received—For those not receiving treatment at intake, interviewers
administered the Treatment Not Received form, which was designed specifically for PCAP.
This measure was added to the intake assessment part way through the recruitment phase;

therefore, only a subset of participants were administered this measure. Furthermore, this
measure was only administered to the patients, not to their providers. For those patients who
were not receiving psychotropic medication, it inquires about reasons for not seeking
medication, and for those not seeking psychotherapy, it inquires about reasons for not
receiving therapy. Reasons were coded by the interviewer into the following categories:
doctor did not recommend treatment, financial reasons, lack of insurance coverage for
treatment, treatment ineffective in the past, patient does not believe he/she has a problem,
patient does not believe in using this treatment for emotional problems, too busy to seek
treatment or treatment is inconvenient, worried about treatment record, concerns about
stigma or embarrassment, not knowing how to obtain treatment, and concerns about
medication side effects.

Statistical Analyses

Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.1.3 (45). Descriptive statistics were used to
examine characteristics of psychiatric treatment received by those with panic disorder with
and without agoraphobia, in addition to reasons for not receiving treatment. Comparisons
between the panic disorder with and without agoraphobia groups were made using chi-
square statistics and t-tests. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine predictors of
receiving psychotropic medication, psychosocial treatment, and concurrent medication and
therapy.

Results

Sample characteristics

At intake, 150 participants were diagnosed with panic disorder with and 85 without
agoraphobia. Table 1 displays the demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample at
intake. No significant differences were found between the groups on any demographic
variables. However, in terms of clinical variables, the panic disorder with agoraphobia group
had an earlier age of panic disorder onset (t = 1.98, df = 233, p <.05) and lower GAF scores
(t = 2.96, df = 233, p < .01), which is indicative of worse functioning and/or more severe
symptoms. The panic disorder with agoraphobia group also had higher rates of social phobia
(χ2 = 5.19, df = 1, p < .05) and a greater number of comorbid anxiety disorder diagnoses (t =
−2.15, df = 233, p <.05).

Treatment Received and Characteristics of Treatment Received

Over half of those with panic disorder (N=145; 62%) were receiving psychiatric treatment at
intake, with those with agoraphobia being more likely to be in treatment than those without
agoraphobia (χ2 = 21.1, df = 1, p < .001). Table 2 displays the frequencies and
characteristics of treatment received at intake. Significantly more patients with panic
disorder with agoraphobia were receiving psychotropic medication at intake (χ2 = 20.05, df
= 1, p < .001). In particular, more patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia were
receiving benzodiazepines (χ2 = 20.95, df = 1, p < .001). SSRIs/SNRIs were the most
commonly received psychotropic medication for both groups. More specifically, the most
common SSRIs/SNRIs were: sertraline (N=27; mean dose= 84.37±58.78), paroxetine
(N=21; mean=23.95±19.82), fluoxetine (N=19; mean=31.05±16.63), and venlafaxine (N=4;
mean=243.75±166.30), all of which have FDA approval for treatment of panic disorder (46).
A subset of patients receiving medication (N=87; 66%) were asked about medication
adherence, with 15% (N=13) reporting that they had taken their medication less frequently
or at a lower dosage than prescribed.

In terms of psychotherapy, patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia were more likely
to be receiving psychotherapy (χ2 = 5.48, df = 1, p = .02). More specifically, patients with

panic disorder with agoraphobia were more likely to be receiving supportive (χ2 = 5.19, df =
1, p = .02), psychodynamic (χ2 = 3.86, df = 1, p = .05), exposure (χ2 = 7.9, df = 1, p < .01),
and cognitive therapy techniques (χ2 = 4.79, df = 1, p < .05). For both groups, supportive
therapy techniques were the most commonly received while exposure therapy was one of the
least frequently received interventions. In terms of concurrent medication and
psychotherapy, those with panic disorder with agoraphobia were more likely to be receiving
such treatment (χ2 = 5.70, df = 1, p = .02).

Predictors of treatment

A series of logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine demographic and clinical
predictors of receiving psychotropic medication, psychotherapy, and concurrent medication
and therapy at intake. Demographic variables, including age, gender, race, marital status,
education, and insurance, along with clinical variables (presence of agoraphobia, age of
panic disorder onset, number of comorbid anxiety diagnoses, and comorbid major
depressive disorder) were included as predictors. Table 3 displays the results of these
analyses, including the tests of the full models, as well as the regression coefficients, Wald
statistics, odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals for significant predictors. In terms of
pharmacologic treatment, results showed that Non-Hispanic Caucasians were more likely to
be receiving such treatment. Furthermore, those with agoraphobia were over three times as
likely and those with comorbid major depressive disorder were twice as likely to receive
medication. The only significant predictor of receiving psychotherapy was having Medicare/
Medicaid/Public assistance insurance, with those with Medicare/Medicaid/Public assistance
insurance being more likely to receive therapy. In terms of concurrent medication and
therapy, those who had at least a 4-year college degree were five times as likely to be
receiving such treatment.

Reasons for Not Seeking Psychiatric Treatment

Data from the Treatment Not Received form were available on 53 patients not receiving
medication and 85 not receiving psychotherapy at intake. No significant differences were
found between the panic disorder with and without agoraphobia groups on reasons for not
seeking treatment; thus responses were collapsed across groups and are displayed in table 4.
The most commonly reported reasons for not seeking pharmacotherapy were: not believing
in using medication for emotional problems, lack of recommendation by primary care
provider, and concern about side effects. For psychotherapy, the most common reasons
were: not believing that one has a problem, not believing in using psychotherapy for
emotional problems, and perceiving treatment to be inconvenient and/or being too busy for
treatment.

Discussion

Despite the degree of impairment and disability typically associated with panic disorder, the
current study found that 38% of primary care patients with the disorder were not receiving
psychiatric treatment. These results are fairly consistent with previous studies that have
found 27-37% of individuals with panic disorder do not receive treatment (8,18,33,47). The
non-treatment rate in the current study was much higher for patients with panic disorder
without agoraphobia. Furthermore, the current study revealed a number of notable
differences between treatments received by those with versus without agoraphobia, which
has not been closely examined in prior studies.

Over half (56%) of primary care patients with panic disorder were receiving psychotropic
medication, with those with agoraphobia being much more likely (67%) than those without
agoraphobia (37%) to be receiving medication. These rates are comparable to those reported

in other studies in primary care settings (42-64%) (8,22,48). The most commonly received
psychotropic medication for both groups were SSRIs/SNRIs, with over 34% of the sample
using a SSRI/SNRI. The mean SSRI/SNRI doses reported were at or above the suggested
therapeutic doses (46), except for with paroxetine, which was below the suggested
therapeutic dose. It is unclear whether those on paroxetine were in fact receiving an
inadequate dose, or if instead, these individuals had not yet titrated up to the suggested
therapeutic dose. Significantly more patients with agoraphobia (35%) were receiving
benzodiazepines than those without agoraphobia (8%), with 26% of whole sample using
such a medication. This rate is higher than past findings in primary care patients with panic
disorder (7-17%) (8,22). Given the variability in how benzodiazepines are utilized, the mean
dose in the current sample was not determined; therefore, it is unclear whether such
medications were being used at the suggested dose and/or in the appropriate manner
determined to be efficacious. Other medications, such as TCAs and other anti-anxiety
medications (e.g., buspirone, meprobamate), were used infrequently.

Results showed that those with agoraphobia (39%) were more likely to be receiving
psychotherapy than those without agoraphobia (24%). Among both groups though,
psychotherapy was underutilized, with only 33% of the sample as a whole receiving therapy
at the time of intake. These rates are in line with previous studies, which have found that
only 27-44% of primary care patients with the disorder receive therapy (8,17,48). These
findings suggest that medications are the first line of treatment. The most commonly
received psychotherapeutic techniques for both groups in the current study were supportive
and psychodynamic techniques. Despite empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of CBT
for panic disorder (30,31), cognitive-behavioral techniques were infrequently utilized, with
only 15% of those without agoraphobia and 28% of those with agoraphobia receiving
cognitive techniques, and even fewer receiving exposure. These findings are similar to past
research that has shown that CBT is underutilized (24,48), suggesting a need for better
treatment dissemination. Furthermore, making such interventions more accessible to primary
care patients and adapted to their particular needs may be beneficial.

A number of factors predicted likelihood of receiving psychiatric treatment. Those with
agoraphobia were over three times as likely to receive medication, which is not surprising
given that agoraphobia is associated with greater disturbance (49) and may be more likely to
be detected and treated. Comorbid major depressive disorder increased the odds of receiving
medication, which has also been found in previous studies on panic disorder and anxiety
disorders in general (23,48). It is possible that primary care providers are more familiar with
depressive symptoms and their treatment, making it more likely that patients with comorbid
depression receive medication. The results also showed that ethnic minorities were less
likely to be receiving medication, which is consistent with other studies (23,48). It is unclear
whether these findings are due to differences in patient treatment preferences or biases on
the part of the treatment provider. Surprisingly, having Medicare/Medicaid/Public assistance
insurance was the only significant individual predictor of receiving psychotherapy. It is
possible that these patients have worse functioning than those with private insurance, while
having greater means to pay for services than those with no insurance, which could lead to
increased likelihood of using therapy. It is also possible that these patients were enrolled in
public mental health programs and receiving therapy from a social worker or case worker in
such programs. Education level predicted likelihood of receiving concurrent medication and
therapy, with those who had a 4-year college degree or more being over five times as likely
to be receiving such treatment. Past studies have also found a relationship between
education level and greater mental health service utilization (33,50,51). One explanation for
this finding is that education is often related to socioeconomic status, and therefore, those
with higher education levels may be more likely to have the resources to pay for services. It

is also possible that those with higher education levels may have better access to the
available services and/or different views about treatment.

Primary care patients with panic disorder reported several barriers to seeking treatment,
including not believing in using medication/therapy for emotional problems and not
receiving a recommendation by one’s primary care provider. Some patients were also
concerned about medication side effects and/or felt psychotherapy was inconvenient.
Although these findings highlight the importance of providers making treatment
recommendations, it appears that the majority of treatment barriers lie within the patient.
Thus interventions aimed at addressing these barriers, such as providing patient education
about the disorder and effective treatment options, may be beneficial.

A number of limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings. The sample
was primarily female and Caucasian, and data collection occurred in only one geographic
region of the United States. Future studies should include sites in other regions and a more
diverse sample. Another consideration is that our assessment of psychiatric treatment did not
specify the symptoms for which the patient was receiving treatment. It is possible that the
focus of treatment may have been on comorbid conditions. Indeed the sample does have
high rates of comorbidity; however these rates are comparable to those reported in other
research (18). No retrospective information was obtained from participants on the length of
time on a particular medication prior to intake. Furthermore, we only obtained limited
medication adherence data that was self-report in nature. Thus, it is possible that although a
proportion of the sample was receiving treatment known to be effective, they may not have
received the treatment for an adequate duration of time and/or they may have had low
treatment adherence. Although reasons for not receiving treatment were examined, data
were only obtained from patients, and only from a subset of the sample, since this measure
was added part way through the study. Therefore, the study did not examine providers’
reasons for not using particular treatments. So it is unclear whether these findings would
have differed had data been available from the providers and from the whole sample. Future
research should attempt to elucidate these issues.

Conclusions

The findings suggest that there are a number of differences in the treatment received by
primary care patients with panic disorder with versus without agoraphobia. Across the
board, many patients with panic disorder are not receiving psychiatric treatment. When
treatment is received, psychotropic medication, particularly SSRIs/SNRIs for those with
either panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, and benzodiazepines for those with
agoraphobia, appears to be the treatment of choice. Psychotherapy is underutilized for both
groups, and for those who do receive therapy, empirically-supported interventions, such as
CBT, are rarely utilized. A number of treatment barriers were identified that could
potentially be addressed by providers. Overall, the findings suggest a need for better
treatment dissemination, making interventions more accessible and/or adapting them to the
needs of this population, and addressing treatment barriers.
