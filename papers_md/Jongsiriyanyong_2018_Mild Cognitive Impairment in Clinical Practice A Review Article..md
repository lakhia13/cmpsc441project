Abstract
The spectrum of cognitive decline in the elderly ranges from what can be classified as normal cognitive decline with aging to
subjective cognitive impairment to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. This article reviewed the up-to-date evidence of
MCI including the diagnostic criteria of MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease, vascular cognitive impairment and MCI due to Parkinson
disease, management and preventive intervention of MCI. There are various etiologies of MCI, and a large number of studies have
been conducted to ascertain the practical modalities of preserving cognition in predementia stages. Lifestyle modification, such as
aerobic exercise, is an approved modality to preserve cognitive ability and decrease the rate of progression to dementia, as well as
being recommended for frailty prevention.

Introduction

The size of the elderly population has been dramatically
increasing worldwide. In 2017, people aged 60 or older
accounted for 13% of the global population at about
962 million people. The size of this population is predicted
to rise to 1.4 billion, 2.1 billion, and eventually 3.1 billion
people by 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively.1 Furthermore,
this population accounts for a higher proportion of total med-
ical expenses than do younger age groups; one important factor
is due to frailty.2 Frailty is one of the geriatric syndromes
caused by declining body reserve in multiple vital systems,
characterized by decreased ability to tolerate acute stress and
increased vulnerability of unfavorable clinical outcomes such
as falls, disabilities, hospitalization, and death.3-5 The interre-
lationship between physical frailty and cognitive impairment is
apparent. It leads to worsening physical and cognitive function
and poor quality of life.6 Cognitive frailty is defined as the co-
occurrence of physical frailty and cognitive decline in older
people without dementia. It is associated with more adverse
health outcomes than patients with prefrailty and frailty with-
out cognitive impairment, according to the population-based
cohort in Singapore with the prevalence of 10.7%.7 The China
Cognitive Frailty, a study of 5708 community-dwelling elderly
people without dementia, found that the prevalence of cogni-
tive frailty was 2.7% and increases with age.5 To maintain
independency in older adults, focusing on cognitive function
is the novel target concern since some causes of cognitive
decline might be reversible or potentially reversible/treatable.
Therefore, understanding cognitive decline in older adults is
one of the important issues.

Normal aging can cause psychomotor slowing, decreased
visual and auditory acuity, decreased vibratory sensation,
smaller pupil size, upward gaze paresis, decreased muscle bulk,
decreased Achilles tendon reflex, minimal swaying as mea-
sured by the Romberg test, mild lordosis, and limitation of
movement in the neck and back. Additionally, while some
cognitive functions are preserved, others tend to decline.8 In
normal aging, sustained attention, simple copy, remote, and
procedural memory are preserved while divided attention,
learning new information, verbal fluency, and reaction time
tend to deteriorate.8 The spectrum of cognitive decline in older
adults ranges from what can be classified as normal cognitive
decline with aging to subjective cognitive impairment (cogni-
tive complaint with normal cognitive screening test) to mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. This review focused
on finding up-to-date information with regard to prevalence,
diagnosis, pathogenesis, outcomes, subtypes, and management
of MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease, vascular cognitive impair-
ment (VCI), and Parkinson disease by classifying as

pharmacological and nonpharmacological management and
prevention of MCI.

Prevalence of MCI

Mild cognitive impairment or mild neurocognitive disorder is
an intermediate state9-15 between normal aging and dementia.
This state can progress to dementia, mostly in the form of
Alzheimer’s disease.16,17 The prevalence of MCI in adults
older than 60 is approximately 6.7% to 25.2%. It increases with
age and lower level of education and is more prevalent in
men.9-12 The prevalence is varied due to differences in defini-
tions of MCI used in most studies. Formerly, MCI was defined
by focusing mainly on amnesia, but it later includes a wider
definition that covers either impairment in single-domain non-
amnestic or several cognitive domains with or without memory
deficit.9 The annual rate of progression to dementia is approx-
imately 5% to 17%.13-15,18 Some established biomarkers asso-
ciated with the progression from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease
are a positive amyloid positron emission tomography (PET)
scan, apolipoprotein E4 genotype, abnormal cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) tau levels, a positive PET scan due to tau deposition
into the lateral temporal lobe structures.11-13,15,19,20

Diagnosis of MCI

The diagnostic criteria for MCI include concern regarding a
change in cognition, abnormal cognitive function in one or
more domains, normal daily activity, and absence of demen-
tia.13,21 A thorough interview regarding the patient’s history
from knowledgeable informants in order to detect the clinical
clues is fundamental in making diagnosis. Adding appropriate
cognitive screening tests is another crucial part for clinical
evaluation of patients with MCI. The Montreal Cognitive
Assessment (MoCA) with a cutoff point of 24/25 is the recom-
mended cognitive screening tool for MCI. The sensitivity and
specificity of the test have been found to be 80.48% and
81.19%, respectively.22 At the cutoff point of 25/26, it had
sensitivity of 80% and 100% and specificity of 50% to
76%.12 However, it does get affected by educational level, life-
style factors, and ethnic diversities.23,24 For example, the Can-
tonese Chinese version with a cutoff point of 22/23 showed a
sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 73% in detecting amnestic
type of MCI.25 A study in Canada showed that adjusting the
MoCA total score for education decreased its overall sensitivity
from 80% to 69% and small increment of specificity from 89%
to 92%, and at the best cutoff point of 24/25, it provided sensi-
tivity and specificity of 61% and 97%, respectively.23

The Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and the
Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) are not recommended as screen-
ing tools for MCI due to their limitations with regard to detect-
ing abnormal cognitive function.22,26 The potential
explanations regarding the limitation of the MMSE perfor-
mances in detecting MCI are the cultural factors, educational
level, factors related to favored language use, and correlation of
cognitive domains in early cognitive deficits. For example, the

level of education did affect the MMSE score, particularly in
no-memory scores (orientation, attention, and language)
among older Mexican Americans.22,26,27 Furthermore, a study
comparing the characteristic differences in the MMSE used
across Asian countries found that it was an unstandardized
cognitive tool due to a variety in administration and con-
tents.28 For the usefulness of the DRS in identifying persons
with MCI, though it could predict declined function and inci-
dent of dementia in some studies,29,30 Clinical dementia rat-
ing (CDR) scores did not have a good correlation with MCI.31
An overall score of 0.5 veiled the diverse functional status of
individuals. Some persons with MCI based on the DRS had
extensive brain pathology and poorer episodic memory and
executive functions and greater risk of developing dementia;
therefore, using global CDR alone appears to be an imperfect
tool for detecting MCI.32 The Cochrane Database of Systema-
tic Reviews found that the sensitivities of the MMSE in
detecting the progression from MCI to dementia ranged from
23% to 76%, 27% to 89% for MCI to Alzheimer, and 36% for
MCI to vascular dementia, and the corresponding specificities
were 40% to 94%, 32% to 90%, and 80%, respectively.33 At
the cut points of 27 or 28 of the MMSE in detecting MCI, the
sensitivities were varied from 45% to 60% and the specifici-
ties were 65% to 90%.12

One systematic review showed that the area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the MoCA
in detecting MCI at the cutoff point of 24/25 was 0.846 (95%
confidence interval [CI]: 0.823-0.868) with a sensitivity of
80.48% and specificity of 81.19%. For the MMSE, the area
under the ROC curve at the cutoff point of 27/28 was 0.736
(95% CI: 0.718-0.767) with a sensitivity of 66.34% and spe-
cificity of 72.94%.27 A direct comparison of the MoCA and
the MMSE also reported that MoCA was more sensitive for
precisely differentiating persons with MCI from those with
normal cognitive function.12 Although MoCA is recom-
mended primarily in MCI screening in several studies,9,16,27
there are some limitations as described above; clinical judg-
ment including premorbid functioning such as intellectual
function and occupational status remains the essential ele-
ments in diagnosing MCI.

Pathogenesis and Outcomes of MCI

Dementia resulting from decades of proteinopathy, such as
Alzheimer’s disease, is associated with amyloid-b deposition:
extraneuronally neuritic plaques and intracellularly neurofi-
brillary tangles. For progressive supranuclear palsy, cortico-
basal degeneration, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration,
they are classified as tauopathy, and for Lewy body dementia
and Parkinson disease dementia, they are synucleinopathy.34
However, there are other important factors in the pathogenesis
of dementia such as sedentary lifestyle, poor nutritional sta-
tus, social or environmental factors, and genetic factors that
could be modifiable.34

neurological diseases, medications, and psychiatric disorders

lead to heterogeneous outcomes.13 There are few outcomes of
MCI: reversion to normal aging, stability, or progression to
dementia, which can be explained by its pathogenesis.14,18,35,36
Basic investigations for metabolic conditions are recom-
mended because of the atypical presentations of these condi-
tions in older adults. Neuroimaging should be performed
selectively as clinically indicated. Totally reversible causes are
rare and mostly occur in surgical and depressive patients.

Subtypes and Their Management of MCI

Many studies have been carried out in order to better under-
stand the pathogenesis of dementia, especially Alzheimer’s
disease. More recent studies have shown more insight in patho-
genesis such as the fact that autophagy and microglia function
have important roles in cognitive ability.37,38 Although there
have been innovative knowledge about the pathogenesis of
dementia (especially Alzheimer’s disease), there are currently
only 2 strategies to deal with dementia: symptomatic relief and
behavioral intervention,39,40 without promising curative treat-
ment. If the preclinical stage of dementia can be identified and
potential interventions to prevent or delay its onset can be
developed, the progress of MCI to dementia may be alleviated,
and successful aging may finally be achieved.41 This review
highlights some interesting issues about 3 types of MCI: MCI
due to Alzheimer’s disease, VCI, and MCI due to Parkinson
disease and their management.

Mild Cognitive Impairment Due
to Alzheimer’s Disease

There are many terms used to refer to MCI such as benign
senescent forgetfulness, age-associated memory impairment,
late-life forgetfulness, mild cognitive decline, age-associated
cognitive decline, age-related cognitive decline, mild neuro-
cognitive decline, cognitive impairment no dementia, and MCI
due to Alzheimer’s disease.16,42

Cognitive impairment can be divided into 4 categories

depending on the domains of the deficit (Table 1).16,42

Evidence of amyloid-b protein deposition
a) Low cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-b
b) Positive PET amyloid imaging

Evidence of neurodegeneration

a) Increased cerebrospinal fluid tau (total and phosphorylated)
b) Decreased metabolism in the parietal and temporal cortical lobe

on 18flurodeoxyglucose PET

c) Atrophic change on MRI in temporal (medial, lateral, and basal)

and medial parietal cortical lobe

Abbreviations: MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; PET, positron emission
tomography.

Amnestic MCI is more common than non-amnestic MCI by a
ratio of about 2:1.42 Non-amnestic MCI may result from normal
aging and have reversible causes, or it may be the result of a
predementia stage of non-Alzheimer’s disease such as frontotem-
poral lobar degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson
disease with dementia, vascular dementia, or primary progressive
aphasia.42 The National Institute of Aging and the Alzheimer’s
Association work group proposed a new diagnostic criterion
for Alzheimer’s disease,16,39,41 which can be applied to preclini-
cal Alzheimer’s disease, MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease, and
Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Both the core clinical criteria and
the biomarker criteria for MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease are
useful for diagnosis. The core clinical criteria are subjective or
objective cognitive impairments in one or more domain(s) of
cognitive function, which have not disturbed the patient’s social
or occupational functions with no other causes of cognitive
impairment (neurologic, psychiatric, systemic disorders, meta-
bolic dysfunctions, or medications). There are 3 categories of
biomarkers for MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease: amyloid
ligands, functional imaging, and structural magnetic resonance
imaging, as shown in Table 2. Despite the discovery of these
biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease, new biomarkers are still
needed for better prediction of the natural course of demen-
tia.43 According to the recommendation of the American Acad-
emy of Neurology (2018), in case that patients with MCI or
families ask about biomarkers, physicians should advice that
there are no accepted biomarkers available to date.9 The like-
lihood of MCI being due to Alzheimer’s disease can be cate-
gorized as high, intermediate, or unlikely (Table 3).16,41,44,45
There are currently a number of ongoing clinical trials being
conducted regarding the pharmacological and nonpharmacologi-
cal management of MCI (mostly amnestic MCI), but there is still
no definite consensus of its management. However, cholinester-
ase inhibitors (donepezil) have been shown to lead to modest
cognitive improvement in patients with amnestic MCI when com-
pared with placebo; however, it did not show clinically mean-
ingful results.14,46 The practical guideline regarding MCI
according to the American Academy of Neurology (2018) stated
that there were insufficient data to support the use of cholinester-
ase inhibitors in general. If physicians offered, they must formerly
provide a lack of evidence base.47 There is currently no data that

have any benefit in this regard. Similarly, flavonoid-containing
drink, homocysteine-lowering B vitamins, and V0191 showed
insufficient results on cognitive measures.9 A 6-month of trans-
dermal nicotine (15 mg/d) were likely to gain cognitive test per-
formance but not clinical global impression in patients with MCI
who did not smoke.9,48 In addition, receiving tesamorelin (growth
hormone–releasing hormone) injections over 20 weeks might be
effective in promoting performance on various cognitive mea-
sures, but the sustainability of this effect after 20 weeks was
uncertain.9,49 Cognitive and physical activity have been shown
to decrease the risk of dementia and MCI, but more evidence of
this is necessary.14 The benefit of exercise was derived from 2
studies. One was a 6-month randomized controlled trial of twice-
weekly resistance training exercise; the results showed improved
selective attention/conflict resolution, associative memory, and
regional patterns of functional brain plasticity, compared with
twice-weekly balance and tone exercises in patients with MCI.
It was a 60-minute class under certified fitness instructors. The
patients performed 2 sets of 6 to 8 repetitions and loading
increased when sets were accomplished with appropriate form.50
Another study also demonstrated that multicomponent exercise
could improve logical memory and preserve usual cognitive func-
tion in patients with MCI. The patients performed 90 minutes/d,
40 times for 6 months.9,10 For cognitive intervention, the evidence
is currently insufficient to support or disprove the use of any
individual one. It may promote strategy knowledge, internal strat-
egy use, and well-being but not external strategy or memory.9 A
systematic review and meta-analysis reported that cognitive inter-
ventions may impact not only on cognitive outcomes alone but
also on activities of daily living and metacognition.51 Therefore,
encouraging patients with MCI perform regular physical and
cognitive exercise training is recommended.9

Vascular Cognitive Impairment

Vascular MCI or VCI is a type of MCI that is unlikely to be due
to Alzheimer’s disease. It is commonly classified into 2 cate-
gories namely, poststroke- and nonstroke-related VCI.52 Vas-
cular cognitive impairment consists of one or more cognitive
impairments including executive/attention, memory, language,
and visuospatial functions, ranging from MCI to dementia,
caused by clinical features of vascular events or evidence of

cerebrovascular event which might be due to
neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by
impaired cognition with imaging evidence of
cerebrovascular disease and a temporal association
between the onset of stroke and cognitive symptoms, or
clear evidence of a temporal association between
cognitive impairment and the presence of diffuse,
subcortical cerebrovascular pathology
Possible No clear relationship between cerebrovascular events

(chronic ischemia, subclinical brain infarction [SBI], white
matter disease from small-vessel disease) and cognitive
impairment. Alternatively, there may not be adequate
imaging information available or the severity of some
neurological deficits (such as aphasia) may preclude proper
cognitive testing, and there may be evidence of underlying
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease,
Parkinson disease, progressive supranuclear palsy,
dementia with Lewy bodies, or the presence of systemic
diseases such as cancer, or metabolic disorders that may be
associated with cognitive dysfunction.

domain, nonamnestic multiple domains

vascular damage found using neuroimaging.53 There are mul-
tiple domains of cognitive deficits in cases of VCI that have
common presentations with dysexecutive syndrome.18,54,55
Concomitant motor signs with VCI include frontal gait distur-
bance, lower body parkinsonism, apathy, depression, urinary
incontinence, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and frontal release
signs.52 Majority of VCI would be mixed type, with the most
common combined with Alzheimer’s disease.

Modification of various vascular risks may potentially
reduce the risk of nonamnestic MCI.56 The pathogenesis of
VCI depends on host factors (age, education, genetics, ApoE-
4 carrier, vascular risk factors, diabetes), vascular causes
(atherosclerosis, microvascular diseases, endothelial disorder),
and additional pathologies (amyloid deposition, cerebral amy-
loid angiopathy, aging).56,57 There have been criteria proposed
for diagnosis of VCI and vascular dementia, and these are
presented in Table 4 according to the American Heart

Association/American Stroke Association.53,55,58 Diagnostic
criteria are based on the presence of cognitive deficit and vas-
cular disease plus a clinical decision that the cerebrovascular
lesions explain the deficit in the affected patient.52 There are
various modifiable risk factors for VCI, the amelioration of
which can decrease the degree of vascular injury.

There are abundant studies regarding the benefit of cholines-
terase inhibitors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
antagonist in VCI. Overall, they were safe and improved modest
cognitive advantages, with inconsistent benefit on overall func-
tion.52,53 Other pharmacological treatment showed insufficient
evidence on cognitive measures such as aspirin, calcium channel
blockers, statin, and vitamin supplementation.53,59 Treatment of
hypertension and lifestyle modification, such as being active and
engaging in regular exercise, getting adequate nutrition, main-
taining adequate socioeconomic support from the community,
avoiding inappropriate use of medication, avoiding smoking,
adherence to a Mediterranean diet, moderation of alcohol con-
sumption, and adopting a positive attitude, may be effective stra-
tegies to prevent or delay the progression to vascular dementia45;
however, there is limited evidence of these interventions in
improving cognitive function in patients with VCI.59 Benefits
of physical activity is probably due to the results of synaptogen-
esis, neurogenesis, and promoting vascular health similarly to the
effect on other causes of dementia.53 The consequence of low-
ering blood pressure to prevent cognitive decline beyond stroke
prevention is debated; however, treating high blood pressure in
persons with hypertension is generally advised due to benefit on
other aspects. Focusing on hyperglycemia, there was small evi-
dence regarding the effect on reducing VCI risk in diabetic
patients. Given its benefit on various target organs including
heart, eye and kidney, appropriate glycemic control in diabetic
patients is likely to be worthwhile.53

Mild Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson
Disease

Parkinson disease is the second most common neurodegenera-
tive disorder with progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons of
the substantia nigra pars compacta.57 Mild cognitive impair-
ment in Parkinson disease (PD-MCI) usually takes the form of
nonamnestic single-domain MCI and leads to increased health-
care costs, increased fall risk, lower quality of life, and disabil-
ities. Risk factors for MCI in Parkinson disease are aging,
severe motor symptoms, non-tremor-dominant motor pheno-
type, and low education. The prevalence of MCI in Parkinson
disease is about 20% to 50%; it varies depending on the pop-
ulation, cognitive domain, and utilized definition.60,61

The pathophysiology of MCI in Parkinson disease may include
synucleinopathy and amyloid deposition, neurochemical dysfunc-
tion (acetylcholine and dopamine), synaptic loss, and structural
change. These processes are no different from Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, as they begin with slowly progressive proteinopathy and
progress to cellular dysfunction and, eventually, structural
change.48-50 There has been a criterion proposed for the diagnosis
of MCI in Parkinson’s disease,51 but it still needs validation.

Abbreviation: PD-MCI, mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease.

Diagnosis of PD-MCI is presented in Table 5.60 Use of the MoCA
as a screening tool for this syndrome has been recommended, as it
is validated for both MCI and Parkinson’s disease with dementia.62
Nonpharmacological measures for MCI in Parkinson disease,
such as cognitive intervention programs or physical exercise,
require further investigation. There is little evidence of cholines-
terase inhibitors reducing the risk of falling and improving cog-
nitive outcomes in patients with Parkinson disease using
donepezil or memantine.60,62 Dopaminergic medications such
as levodopa or dopamine agonists showed inconstant cognitive
effects depending on the nature of task and level of basal dopa-
mine function in corticostriatal circuitry.63 A 24-week, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial of Rasagiline (a monoamine
oxidase type B inhibitor) treatment in PD-MCI failed to improve
cognitive function, but it gained motor symptoms and activities
of daily living.64 Atomoxetine, a adrenergic reuptake inhibitor,
clozapine, serotonin and dopamine receptors, and second-
generation tricyclic antidepressant were found to enhance atten-
tion and better control psychosis and depressed mood from
placebo-controlled trials.65 Management of comorbidities, such
as depression, anxiety, apathy, and sleep disorder, which can
contribute to worsening of cognitive function appears to be help-
ful. Furthermore, non-PD medications, such as centrally acting
medications for pain, bladder function, and sleep, which causes
cognitive decline should be avoided.60

Can MCI Be Prevented?

Mild cognitive impairment may progress to dementia, and
approved medications at present could only delay the progres-
sion of some types of dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. Additionally, the effects of medications are modest.12,29

Jongsiriyanyong and Limpawattana

505

Therefore, prevention of MCI is likely to be the best way
against the onset of dementia. The studies regarding prevention
of MCI mainly cover dementia syndrome in which MCI due to
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type, followed by
vascular dementia. This review then would present the evi-
dence base of effective interventions to prevent MCI in general.
The interventions could be classified into 4 groups: pharmaco-
logical interventions, over-the-counter (OTC) supplements,
physical activity, and cognitive training.66-69

Cognitive Training

There is no clinical trial on the protective effect of cognitive
training in adults with normal cognitive function to progress to
MCI according to a systematic review. Training with specific
domain could improve cognitive performance in the trained
domains which were reasoning, executive function/attention/
processing speed, and memory. Therefore, there is insufficient
evidence of cognitive training regarding prevention or delay of
cognitive decline in adults with normal cognitive function.67

Pharmacological Interventions

Conclusion

A systematic review showed that there were no randomized
controlled trials regarding protective effect of dementia medi-
cation, antihypertensive medication, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, aspirin, and testosterone. Similarly, no
studies comparing the effect of intensive versus standard anti-
hypertensive medication treatment, intensive versus standard
antidiabetic medication treatment, and statin plus fenofibrate
versus statin alone were available. Interestingly, estrogen alone
and estrogen plus progestin versus placebo increased risk of
MCI at hazard ratio of 1.34 and 1.07, respectively. Selective
estrogen receptor modulator at 120 mg/d of raloxifene exam-
ined the benefit with a relative risk of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.53-1.01).
Therefore, currently, no pharmacological interventions consis-
tently show benefit in preventing MCI and estrogen with/with-
out progestin increased risk of MCI.69

Over-the-counter supplements. A systematic review reported that
only few studies examined effects of OTC intervention on
clinical MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease. No data comparing
placebo and omega-3 fatty acids, soy, folic acid, B vitamin
(folic acid plus B12), B vitamin (folic acid plus B6, B12), vita-
min D plus calcium, vitamin E, vitamin C, or b-carotene
regarding prevention of MCI is available. There was insuffi-
cient data to conclude the benefit of Ginkgo biloba, and multi-
vitamin offered no benefit in clinical trial. Generally, existing
OTC supplements have limited evidence for cognitive
protection.68

Physical Activity

Multicomponent physical intervention including flexibility,
strength, balance, endurance, and aerobic training had insuffi-
cient data to conclude the effect. There was no study comparing
attention control with aerobic training, resistance training, Tai
chi, physical activity plus diet, physical activity plus protein
supplement, or physical activity, diet, and cognitive training.
Although, single-component physical activity interventions
showed unfavorable results, a multidomain intervention
appeared to promote cognitive function in older persons with
normal cognition. Encouraging to perform in clinical practice
is recommended since the benefits also affect to prevent or
manage other chronic illnesses.66

This topic reviewed the common pathophysiology of MCI,
particularly in MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease, VCI, and
MCI in Parkinson disease. The MoCA is recommended as a
cognitive screening test for MCI. More trials are required in
order to discover the most effective strategies for the preven-
tion and delay of MCI. However, lifestyle modifications
including regular cognitive and physical activity should be
promoted through strong health policies in order to promote
successful aging.
