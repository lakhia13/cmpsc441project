Abstract: Family caregivers of people with mental disorders face a number of burdens and stressors,
such as associative stigma and burnout. These burdens are often a result of their caring role coupled
with insuﬃcient support or ineﬀective coping strategies, which can aﬀect their quality of life and
biopsychosocial integrity that, in turn, may aﬀect the care they provide. This study aimed to explore
the experiences of family caregivers of people with mental disorders, through examining the burdens
that they face and the coping strategies that they use. Using a descriptive qualitative approach, 13
semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of the Saudi public, recruited through
popular social media platforms and analyzed using thematic analysis. Five main themes were
constructed from the data: Type of care, Challenges, Coping and support, Perceptions of public
awareness, and Messages to others. The ﬁndings emphasize the diﬀerent types of burdens that
caregivers experience, and their needs that require a range of responses such as educational training
on eﬀective coping strategies, and psychological support in the form of counseling or group therapy.
This study highlights the voice of caregivers and their message to the public, in order to correct the
misconceptions surrounding mental disorders and those associated with them.

Keywords: caregivers; caregiver burden; coping; mental disorder

1. Introduction

Globally, the burden of mental disorders is on the rise, impacting socio-economic status, health,
and human rights [1]. In this paper we draw from the DSM-5 deﬁnition of mental disorders: “a
mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically signiﬁcant disturbance in an individual’s
cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reﬂects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological,
or developmental processes underlying mental functioning” which includes neurocognitive disorders
such as Alzheimer’s and autism [2]. The burden of mental disorders aﬀects not only those living
with them, but also those who care for them, from healthcare professionals to family caregivers. A
primary caregiver is deﬁned as: “A member of the family who is most involved with the care of

International Journal ofEnvironmental Researchand Public Health(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6405

the outpatient” [3]. Universally, deinstitutionalization has led to a shift in care roles from healthcare
professionals—particularly nurses—providing primary care in institutions to a more integrated,
community-based approach with family members now acting as primary caregivers [4]. Since the
deinstitutionalization movement, it has been estimated that the provision of care for 50–90% of people
with mental disorders has now shifted to the responsibility of family members [5]. Research has also
reported that the degree of responsibility carried out by family caregivers varies, depending on the
severity of the disorder of the person with the mental illness [6]. However, typical responsibilities
include providing emotional support such as active listening, physical company, and assisting with
daily living activities such as grooming and personal hygiene [7]. Although deinstitutionalization has
mostly brought about positive outcomes, it is not without shortcomings wherein family caregivers may
be unprepared to manage unpredictable behaviors, such as violence and verbal or physical aggression,
which have all been found to be contributing factors toward caregiver burden [8]. Family caregivers
experience distinct types of burdens that can disrupt their biopsychosocial integrity, including physical,
psychological, social, and economic burdens. Physical burden can be caused by the signiﬁcant side
eﬀects of certain psychotropic drugs (e.g., antipsychotics) [9,10] that restrict or impact the patient’s
ability to mobilize and provide self-care, requiring additional physical support from the caregiver. This
can lead to an over-dependency on caregivers by people with mental disorders leading to exhaustion
and burnout [11–14]. Psychological burden is usually expressed as grief and depression [11–14], for
example, in a study focusing on female spousal caregivers, it was found that female spouses caring for
husbands with severe mental illness typically experience emotional detachment and psychological
distress. The results of this study stressed the diﬀerent types of emotional burdens, entailing emotional
detachment, emotional distancing, mutual hostility, pity instead of love, emotional exhaustion,
despair and hopelessness, feelings of incompetence and exhaustion, loss of identity, interest and
motivation, being trapped in the various roles, and being a scapegoat [13]. Social burden, which can be
demonstrated as adverse eﬀects on lifestyle, restriction in routine, harnessing social relationships and
support, dysfunctional family process, and conﬂict between family members, can lead to dissatisfaction
and fear of social isolation [11–14]. Furthermore, economic burden results from caregivers having
to deal with role shifts, such as being the primary caregiver and breadwinner [11–14], in addition to
ﬁnancial strains for example, costs of psychotropic medications and limited coverage of free treatment
as stipulated by governmental policies [10]. Family caregivers of people with mental disorders use a
variety of coping strategies to manage the stress and burden of caregiving. These coping strategies
have been linked to factors such as caregiver-expressed feelings, social support, and the value and
quality of life of caregivers [7]. Although there have been many studies on the experiences of family
caregivers of people with mental disorders, less attention has been paid to the signiﬁcant distinctions
between countries. Yet, it has been well-established that cultural diﬀerences and related factors can
aﬀect public perceptions and attitudes about those with mental disorders and, in turn, may cause
diﬀerent experiences in caregivers [15]. Globally, family caregivers face problems and stressors related
to caring for their relatives with mental illnesses, such as stigma and ineﬀective coping strategies,
where some of them are not ready to undertake their caregiving roles. This is indeed the case in
Saudi Arabia [16]; according to the ﬁrst Saudi National Health and Stress Survey, conducted on a
sample of 4004 individuals in Saudi Arabia examined the occurrence of mental health conditions. The
statistics demonstrated that 34% of Saudis met the criteria for a mental health condition, where these
criteria were met by 36% of Saudi females and 33% of Saudi males; however, only 5% of the population
had sought treatment [17]. Therefore, it is important to focus on family caregiver experiences, in
order to explore their needs and preparedness to care for their loved ones who are suﬀering from
mental disorders. Additionally, there may be cultural variations in caregiver burdens and challenges
and interventions need to be tailored accordingly. For example, previous research identiﬁed unique
perceptions of the cause and nature of mental disorders within Saudi culture, such as the commonly
shared belief of the evil eye and its negative inﬂuence on mental wellbeing [18]. If the problems and
stressors of caregivers are not overcome, they may inevitably lead to burnout and exhaustion, an

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6405

increase in burden, a lack of social support, high levels of stigma, and a decrease in quality of life [19].
Most of the previous research conducted in this area used quantitative research methods to assess
the psychological and socio-economic status of the caregiver. Quantitative research is potentially a
limiting factor for their results, as it lacks rich detail. Furthermore, to date, there have only been very
limited published research studies on this topic within the Saudi context. Hence, we conducted this
study to provide more in-depth information about the experiences and challenges of caregivers, which
can contribute to suggesting solutions to overcome these challenges. This study aimed to explore the
experiences of family caregivers of people living with various mental disorders through examining the
burdens that they face and the coping strategies that they use.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study Design

This study adopted a descriptive qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews
with family caregiver participants caring for relatives with mental illnesses. This approach was deemed
appropriate for the research aim as the primary goal of qualitative descriptive research is to provide a
comprehensive inductive summarization of speciﬁc events experienced by a group of people, in terms
of themes that are described in an elucidated manner [20].

2.2. Ethical Considerations

The research protocol was approved on 01/03/2020 by the Nursing Research Ethical Committee of
a Public University (NREC Serial No: Ref No 1M. 24). The study was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. Prior to the interview, participants were given a full explanation about
the research aim, the researcher’s responsibilities, the potential risks and beneﬁts of participating,
and their right to withdraw from the study at any time without any penalty. Participants were also
made aware of the members of the team who would have access to their interview transcripts. Each
participant was fully aware, and understood the essence of the study and agreed to take part. This
study was conducted during the initial height of COVID-19 thereby preventing collection of written
consent. At this stage, as many participants did not have capacity to provide digital signatures, the
NREC gave permission to obtain verbal consent which was captured at the start of the audio recorded
interview. Each participant caregiver was anonymized and identiﬁed by a code “Caregiver = (C),”
followed by a unique identiﬁer number. The research team was comprised of nine members; a senior,
doctoral-trained nurse researchers: (M.B., A.M., and R.W.): two with expertise in mental health (L.S.
and N.A.), and a team of student researchers (S.B., F.A., M.A., and S.A.) who received formal training in
qualitative research methods including data collection and analysis. The senior research team oversaw
the design and conceptualization of the research project while the student researchers supported data
collection and initial analysis.

2.3. Study Setting and Participant Recruitment

This study was conducted in Saudi Arabia. According to the most recent statistics listed by the
Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, Facebook and Twitter are considered to be
the most popularly used forms of social media at present in Saudi Arabia [21]. Therefore, a purposive
sampling strategy was used across these social media platforms to recruit the target participants,
which enabled the researchers to reach the family caregivers of people with mental disorders from
diﬀerent cities across Saudi Arabia. Speciﬁcally, an advertisement calling for participants and an initial
screening survey was constructed, using Google Forms to recruit potential participants. Participants
who responded to the advertisement, completed the screening survey, and met the inclusion criteria
were then contacted by the researchers to arrange an interview date and time. Criteria for inclusion for
study participants included self-reported living with a person with a mental illness, providing direct

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6405

care to the individual, having been diagnosed by a psychiatric or mental healthcare provider, and
being an Arabic or English speaker.

2.4. Data Collection Procedure

Data were collected by (S.B., F.A., M.A., and S.A.) using audio recorded, semi-structured interviews
conducted via telephone or virtual communication platforms as per the participants preference in
accordance with recent governmental regulations regarding social distancing, to maintain the safety of
participants and the researchers during the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. On
average, the interviews lasted between 25 and 46 min. Semi-structured interviews were identiﬁed as
the most appropriate data collection method for this design as they (1) enabled focused discussion
with scope for open-ended questions, and (2) increase rigor in reliable and comparable qualitative
data collection when interviews are conducted by multiple researchers [22]. The student researchers
(S.B., F.A., M.A., and S.A.) used a semi-structured interview guide with open-ended questions and
prompts to guide the participants. The interview guide was developed by the lead author (L.S) based
on the challenges experienced by caregivers observed in the literature and clinical observations. The
interviews examined the context of the experience of having to care for people with mental disorders by
exploring the caregiver’s burdens, coping strategies, and experiences of stigma. Speciﬁcally, questions
focused on the types of care that were provided and the challenges that were faced, combined with
care, associative stigma, and issues related to disclosure, as well as the eﬀect of the public opinion
on their experiences. The student researchers also made ﬁeld notes during the interviews, which
were transcribed and used to provide additional context during data analysis. Of the 13 interviews
conducted, 12 were in the participant’s native language (Arabic) and one interview was conducted in
the English language, as per the participant’s preference. Participants also agreed to follow-up contact
if the research team had additional questions and clariﬁcations during the analysis process.

2.5. Data Analysis

Data were managed using Microsoft Word and Apple Pages. Data analysis was guided by
Braun and Clarke’s six-phase process of thematic analysis (1. familiarize yourself with the data, 2.
generating initial codes, 3. searching for themes, 4. reviewing themes, 5. deﬁning and naming themes,
6. producing the report) [23]. In phase 1, all interview audio recordings were downloaded and then
transcribed verbatim by the research team. The interviews were transcribed initially in Arabic, and then
translated into English for data analysis by ﬁve members (S.B., F.A., M.A., S.A., and L.S) of the research
team who are bilingual. To conﬁrm that the interviews were correctly and accurately transcribed, the
researchers reviewed all interviews twice. Participants were ascribed identiﬁable codes to maintain
their anonymity and to allow for the management of their data. Using an inductive approach [24],
the researchers individually familiarized themselves with the data by reading and re-reading the
interview transcripts, searching for broad themes and gathering data across the transcripts. In phase 2,
following an in-depth review of the ﬁrst four interviews, under the guidance of the lead author, the
research team gathered to discuss early data ﬁndings and initial codes. In phase 3, through a process
of discussion and reﬂection of those interview data, a coding tree was developed and potential themes
and sub-themes identiﬁed. In phase 4, the researchers then, independently, returned to the remaining
nine interviews and using the coding tree continued the process of thematic analysis to identify themes
and sub-themes. In phase 5, the research team met again when all interviews had been analyzed to
further verify and discuss the identiﬁed themes and subthemes and agree upon the ﬁnal deﬁnitions and
names. Data saturation (the point at which no new themes are identiﬁed connected to the phenomena
under investigation) [25] was initially noted at the fourth interview. Saturation was conﬁrmed by the
eighth interview and further veriﬁed across the remaining ﬁve interviews, with provision of additional
examples that were representative of the themes and sub-themes. All discrepancies or disagreements
in the process of data analysis and with regard to the themes and naming of the themes generated were
discussed as a team under the supervision of the supervising researchers until resolution was reached.

In addition, as per the protocol, three participants were contacted for clariﬁcation and additional
context to ensure that resolution of discrepancies was in line with participants experiences and not
biased by the perspectives of the research team. In preparation for phase 6, verbatim quotes of the
participants were selected to illustrate the identiﬁed themes and sub-themes.

3. Results

3.1. Participant Characteristics

Fourteen people responded to the recruitment materials. After reviewing for eligibility, 13 Saudi
caregivers were included and completed interviews. Participant characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. Approximately half of the caregivers were single and the majority (77%) were female, with
overall caregiver ages ranging between 21 and 65 years. Most of the primary caregivers were students,
with only three in current employment. Caregivers varied in their relationship to the individual with
the mental disorder, with 38% being a sibling, 31% a parent, 15% a child, 8% a spouse, and 8% other
(i.e., uncle). The most common types of mental disorders among the individuals that were being cared
for were depression and bipolar. A total of 77% of caregivers shared their caregiver role, and the
remaining 23% served as primary caregivers, responsible for all aspects of the care provided.

Five main themes and seven subthemes were extracted from the interviews: (1) Type of care
provided, (2) Challenges encountered, (3) Coping and support, (4) Caregiver perception of public
awareness of mental disorders, and (5) Messages to others. Figure 1 provides a visual depiction of the
themes and their interrelated nature (Figure 1).

3.2. Theme 1: Type of Care Provided

The type of care provided by caregivers diﬀered according to the severity of the mental disorder
and age of the individual. Severe mental disorders, such as Alzheimer’s, intellectual disabilities,
and schizophrenia, were found to require complete holistic care, as explained by a caregiver of an
individual with an intellectual disability: “We are taking care of her basic needs, from going to the
toilet to feeding her . . . everything from A to Z” (C12). Disorders such as depression and bipolar
were considered less burdensome, in the sense that people with these types of disorders only required
partial physical assistance and more spiritual, psychological, and emotional support. A as one of the
caregivers reported: “I was the psychological and spiritual supporter . . . I used to say to him things
like ‘you are strong and you are capable of overcoming this crisis’” (C4). A diﬀerent caregiver shared:
“I do not provide her with that much care, but I do try to make her laugh, and feel better and get her
out of her mood” (C3). Some participants also reported oﬀering care in unique forms, such as being
the mediator of the family: “I was the dove of peace among all in order to make him comfortable,
because he would get unwell when his wife gets mad at him. He used to call me to come and calm
everyone down and help resolve the problems because they were always in a state of stress” (C4). Care
often extended beyond the immediate individual with the mental illness to practical support for other
family members, for example providing childcare when the individual was going through an episode
or treatment. “I would look after her children because it was hard for her to take care of them while
she was unwell, I will always be there for her . . . supporting her psychologically... she feels better
when she knows that her children are taken care of” (C1). A minority of the participants felt they had
to employ a paternalistic approach within their caregivers: “I even sometimes would have to treat him
like a child. I would tell him ‘you are a hero; you can do it.’ I was encouraging him so that he did not
quit his job” (C2). Another caregiver reported: “She is like a baby, like a child, she has to be taught how
to eat without making sounds and how to walk, my mother teaches her the basics like a child” (C6).

3.3. Theme 2: Challenges Encountered

Caring for people with mental disorders put caregivers under various stressors, as they have
faced diﬀerent challenges that have aﬀected both themselves and the care that they provide. Five
sub-themes based on these diﬀerent challenges were retrieved from the interviews: (i) Dealing with
signs and symptoms, (ii) emotional burden, (iii) role shifting and family dynamics, (iv) stigma and
public views, and (v) disclosure dilemma.

3.3.1. Subtheme i: Dealing with Signs and Symptoms of the Disorder

Dealing with the signs and symptoms of mental disorders often caused heartache among caregivers,
as explained by a participant: “You can’t imagine how hard it is to see your father or your mother,
the people who love you the most, no longer remember you! So, there is no reason for living” (C10).
Caregivers also mentioned how inadequate education and training on how to care and manage the
signs and symptoms posed a signiﬁcant challenge. Caregivers commonly reported not knowing if
the care they were providing was the right type of care, generating internal self-conﬂict: “Sometimes
we do not know how to deal with him . . . I do not know . . . I feel it is wrong to deal with him as a
normal person, but at the same time, we have to deal with him as a normal person, I really do not
know how to deal with him, it is very hard” (C7). At times, dealing with the signs and symptoms of
the mental disorders put the caregivers at risk of physical injury, aggression, or violence; as one of the
participants noted: “The challenge that I was suﬀering from was her violence. She hit me!” (C6). Even
without physical violence, caregivers have faced physical burdens due to the type of care itself. When
participants were asked about whether the care they provided aﬀected them or their lives in any way,
the majority acknowledged a substantial impact on their lives: “It’s exhausting, maybe you can do it
by yourself, but it is better to seek help; if it was my decision, I would hire a nurse for him!.” (C11).
However, the impact of the challenges could also have a motivating eﬀect, such as in the case of one

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6405

8 of 15

caregiver who reported that the experience had impacted her choice of career: “It aﬀected my choice
of specialty in medical school because of something that happened to me in my personal life” (C8).
Most of the caregivers reported issues regarding medication compliance and non-adherence among
the relatives they were caring for. One of the caregivers said: “Sometimes when he feels comfortable
and stable, he stops the medication. He always says: I don’t need it anymore” (C4). Another caregiver
faced the same situation: “When she feels sick, she takes her medication, until she starts to feel ﬁne
then she stops taking it causing her to relapse” (C1). Some of the caregivers did not face this type
of problem, as they reported that their relative was independent and capable of adhering to their
therapeutic plan: “She was taking her medications by herself and she doesn’t have any problem in
remembering her medications, she even reminds us about our medication time” (C3). A ﬁnal challenge
existed where participants had sole care. While the majority of the participants reported a shared
responsibility of care between family members: “Me and my older sister were taking care of her” (C12),
the few with complete responsibility described it as an obligatory assignment. This could lead to other
types of challenges that were mentioned earlier. “When I was in the ﬁrst year of college, it aﬀected me
a lot because I was with him (his father) in the hospital because he broke his hip and I needed be there
with him all the time, and I could not ﬁnd the time to study” (C10).

3.3.2. Subtheme ii: Emotional Burden

All of the participants reported that the most severe challenge that they faced is the emotional
burden, which has had multiple eﬀects on them and the care that they provide. Participants reported
feeling shock, severe sadness, depression, exhaustion, helplessness, and even an inability to comprehend
the situation altogether. This was exempliﬁed by the following caregiver: “It was hard when I saw her
crying, I felt like someone is breaking me and tearing me into pieces” (C13). Another participant added:
“I was in psychological distress myself, I felt like I was stuck in a whirlpool, a great big whirlpool
. . . I cried very hard, it is such a diﬃcult test from God . . . to have your loved ones stricken by this
illness (the caregiver was crying)” (C1). At times, the emotional burden was so severe the caregiver
themselves were subjected to developing mental health problems: “In 2008, I was diagnosed with
depression” (C10). Most of the caregivers mentioned feeling “helplessness,” as they did not know how
to deal with their loved ones: “Mmm...sometimes we don’t know how to deal with him, I feel like we
shouldn’t treat him like a sick person or a normal one . . . ” (C7).

3.3.3. Subtheme iii: Role Shifting and Family Dynamics

The homeostasis of the family structure is shaken during episodes of mental instability. The
caregiver may be in charge of diﬀerent tasks and may be responsible for playing additional roles that
exacerbate the diﬀerent types of burdens that they face. Some participants mentioned that they faced
challenges related to the shifting of roles within the family, which, in turn, aﬀected their own social
and personal lives: “When you are responsible for supporting a family to become balanced and able to
overcome a crisis, this will take a lot of eﬀort” (C4). Another participant experienced having to take on
the role of being the head of the family while he was still of a young age: “The court obligated me to be
my father’s guardian when I was just 19” (C10).

3.3.4. Subtheme iv: Stigma and Public Views

Another reality highlighted by caregivers was stigma, as public perception is generally negative,
with unfair or unsubstantiated fears and beliefs about individuals with mental disorders. The majority
of the caregivers were in agreement that the general public described people with mental disorders as
crazy, as one of the caregivers pointed out: “They [members of the public] do not have any idea, and
for them the mentally ill is ‘crazy,’ and they do not have a life and they are incapable of doing anything”
(C9). The public perception could also extend within the walls of the family. One of the caregivers
related her experience of stigma and discrimination from a family relative: “One of our relatives came
to visit us once with his wife, they were newly married, he asked us to hide my sister, I didn’t like

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6405

9 of 15

what he said, this is her home. Why should we hide her? We kept her in her room, watching TV and
got her dressed and prepared just in case anyone saw her” (C12). Another caregiver also voiced her
concern with regard to exploitation of the individual’s vulnerability: “She was not helping him, she
was taking advantage of his illness and using him to do what she wants when he is sick she would ask
him to buy for her lots of things because she knew that he doesn’t have control” (C4).

3.3.5. Subtheme v: Dilemma of Disclosure

With regard to disclosure, caregivers were in self-conﬂict as to whether disclosing the diagnosis of
their relative to others was acceptable or not. Reasons for self-conﬂict included not wanting to be pitied
and a sense of preserving privacy. For example, one of the caregivers believed that it was a personal
matter, stating: “I did not have to tell them (distant relatives); I did not tell them because this is my
problem and no one else” (C1). Another explained that she would not tell anyone: “I wouldn’t go
around and advertise and tell people; I wouldn’t complain to anyone” (C4). The caregivers seemed to
agree about disclosing to close blood relatives, such as siblings, parents, and spouses. However, fear of
being stigmatized meant they were less willing to disclose to distant relatives and other acquaintances.
“I would feel better if no one knew about her mental disorder . . . it is okay if the close ones (close
relatives) know ... but the rest, no, it is better that no one knows” (C6).

3.4. Theme 3: Coping and Support

The notion of coping was varied among caregivers. The majority of the study participants
mentioned acceptance and religious practices as eﬀective coping mechanisms. One of the caregivers
commented: “All praise to God, we accept it because we know God is generous, eventually, we can’t
escape from fate, God will be above everything” (C1). They also believed in the importance of the
caregivers being close to God: “I would seek support from God only, because no one will stand beside
you except your Lord. He is the one who aﬄicted me and so he is the one who is able to heal, God
has tested me and I accept it. God is great and he is compassionate . . . I have a strong faith in God
that he is able to heal her” (C1). Some of the participants described their relatives who were aﬀected
by the mental disorder as a mercy from God: “To be honest, there was no pressure on us. Our father
was telling us: ‘She is the cause of mercy and blessings in our life,’ and when we would feel tired, he
would take over and do all the care by himself” (C12). Other caregivers chose to take an educational
approach to coping by learning more about the disorder and how to deal with the individual: “I
attended training courses about autism and people with special needs, I also communicated with a
specialized doctor and behavioral therapists” (C5). One of the participants talked about how learning
and gaining new information about their relative’s mental illness helped to increase her awareness: “
. . . mainly I was reading about it, the more I learned, the less fearful I became” (C8). Only a couple of
caregivers utilized less eﬀective coping mechanisms, such as avoidance: “Ignoring, ignoring! I did
not talk to her for one year and I left the room because we were roommates” (C6). The ability to cope
was often linked to access to additional support, either psychological support, support groups for the
individual, or practical resources and services. One of the caregivers expressed her need for support
by saying: “I needed to know more information about the illness, I was reading from the internet but I
needed a trusted source, and I feel like it is helpful for him to engage in support groups but we do not
have any here” (C7).

3.5. Theme 4: Caregiver Perception of Public Awareness of Mental Disorders

Participants were asked to share their perceptions of the public awareness about mental disorders in
Saudi Arabia. Although the caregivers had varying opinions, the majority agreed on the misconceptions
of society regarding the causes, treatment, and care of mental disorders. They also mentioned stigma
and the underestimation of people with mental disorders and their capabilities. The most common
related misconception was about the causes of mental disorders, as the majority agreed that the Saudi
society still associates the causes of mental disorders with magic, the evil eye, and possession: “I feel

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6405

10 of 15

like all the people think that the evil eye is the cause” (C6). One of the caregivers themselves believed
that the main cause of her mother’s sickness was possession: “My mom had fallen unwell, she was
possessed by an evil spirit, and she was treated by a sheikh (a religious faith healer), and then she was
diagnosed with depression” (C13). The caregivers believed that the ﬁrst choice of treatment among
many would involve seeking help from a sheikh, who would usually treat a person with religious
practices involving the reading of Quranic verses: “To be honest with you, we also took him to a sheikh
to read [qur’anic verses] over him” (C2). Despite the negative experiences, some caregivers believed
that the Saudi public were more understanding and accepting of certain mental disorders over others.
For example: “If we were talking about mental disorders such as Alzheimer’s or dementia . . . the
public deal with these disorders as expected and normal disorders, but when you are talking about
depression, bipolar, or schizophrenia, they don’t believe that you are sick, they think you are lying or
faking it . . . They say ‘get closer to God, go pray, there is something wrong with your faith,’ they just
can’t understand that the problem is organic in nature” (C11). However, in general, the caregivers
believed that the public did not have enough knowledge about mental disorders: “I wouldn’t say
they are unaware, but they have superﬁcial information about it (mental disorders)” (C8). Additional
misconceptions noted by the participants were about treatments and care. Several caregivers noted
that the general public believed in the religious treatment of mental disorders by faith healers, or
sheikhs, and indeed several of the participants had sought this case as stated previously. One caregiver
said: “Some of them think that you must go to a sheikh or so on rather than seek psychiatric treatment”
(C11). The speciﬁc rationale for this was understood to be a lack of trust in psychiatry and a stigma of
shame in seeking psychological help: “ . . . they think it is a shame that we go to a psychiatrist, simply
put, they would say: I am not crazy” (C4). One of the caregivers was accepting of their opinion: “I
was one of the people who did not believe in psychiatrists” (C3). Most caregivers shared the belief
that the public are unaware that people with mental disorders are capable of living fulﬁlling lives and
can be independent and successful people, as society only focuses on their limitations rather than on
their strengths. A caregiver explained how her daughter was a successful individual, regardless of her
mental disorder: “She is an amazing mother, a wonderful wife, social with her colleagues and her
students love her. She has two master degrees and is now doing her PhD” (C1).

3.6. Theme 5: Messages to Others

As they discussed their experiences, particularly reﬂecting on those in the previous theme, a
number of key messages were shared that fell within to two subthemes: (i) Advice to other caregivers,
and (ii) A plea to the general public.

3.6.1. Subtheme i: Advice to Other Caregivers

Most caregivers shared similar advice regarding care provided to their relatives with mental
disorders: “You have to be careful about your words, avoid using words that may hurt them, even if it
is a joke” (C7). They also stressed the importance of psychological support, tolerance, and patience:
“They shouldn’t treat him as a sick person . . . and they have to be patient” (C10). One of the caregivers
caring for a person with Alzheimer’s shared this message: “Just stay close to them, listen to their stories,
even if he told you the same story a thousand time before, honestly their smiles can ﬁx everything.
When I saw my father’s smile, I felt safe, happy and in peace, if you lose them you will lose everything”
(C10). A few also noted that self-care was key to maintaining eﬀective care provision: “If you want to
take care of your mentally ill relative, you have to maintain your psychological status ﬁrst, you have
to be patient, and you have to learn how to deal with the individual” (C6). Another caregiver said:
“Make some time for yourself” (C11).

3.6.2. Subtheme ii: A Plea to the General Public

The messages of the caregivers to the public can be summarized as follows: educate yourself,
increase mental health services, accept people with mental disorders, and there is no shame in seeking

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6405

11 of 15

mental health services. Given the extent and range of mental health disorders, caregivers expressed
concern that people make an eﬀort to educate themselves on the subject, suggesting diﬀerent ways
people could do this: “Attend online courses, I wish they would take the time to educate themselves
on mental health in general, because if you read about it, you will like it and you will feel it’s normal,
just like other disorders” (C8). They also oﬀered a compassionate call, encouraging those who need to
seek it out and to reduce the surrounding stigma: “I wish that if anyone has the feeling that he or she
needs some help, go and look for it, go to a counselor or psychiatrist ... there is no shame in going and
seeking help” (C10).

4. Discussion

This study provides insight into the unique experiences of Saudi caregivers of people with mental
disorders, revealing that the type of care provided to individuals varies depending on the severity of
the mental disorder, which is consistent with the results found in the literature [12,26]. There were a
number of assumptions about anticipated ﬁndings regarding caregiver burden and coping made by
the lead researcher based on her expertise and experience in mental health care within the SA context.
Namely, that caregivers would have experienced high levels of stigma towards themselves and the
people in their care. The analysis drew on a phased team approach to help bracket these assumptions
and ensure that the analysis was representative of the caregiver’s experiences rather than conﬁrming
assumptions. As it transpired, these assumptions were born out in the data, however, an unanticipated
ﬁnding was that the majority of stigma came from family members of the caregiver, rather than the
wider society.

Within this study, caregivers reported many challenges: dealing with the signs and symptoms
of a mental disorder, emotional burden, violence and physical burden, role shifting and disturbed
family dynamics, stigma, and public views. Similar challenges—stigma and emotional burden—were
found in studies conducted in Taiwan [27], Ghana [28], and Iran [12], which linked emotional burden
rates with poor mental health, stress, and psychological distress among caregivers [12,28,29]. In the
current study, caregivers reported psychological distress and the development of mental disorders,
such as depression. As stated, the stigma faced by the majority of caregivers in the current study was
reported to be typically from relatives, rather than society in a wider sense. This was found to be the
reason behind the caregivers’ concealment of their relatives’ illness and their hesitation to disclose
their diagnosis. The need to conceal and the hesitancy to disclose can be attributed in part to the
aﬃliate stigma experienced by caregivers [30]. This may in part be related to the public’s low mental
health awareness, as well as the patronizing and labeling nature of the Arab culture, which tends to
be paternalistic toward those with mental disorders and underestimates their abilities and level of
functioning [31]. The types of coping strategies reported in the current study were divided according
to their eﬀectiveness. Acceptance-, religiosity-, and spirituality-related coping techniques emerged as
the main eﬀective coping strategies. The caregivers believed that all hardships experienced would
be reduced by praying and seeking refuge from God. In Islamic belief, God’s will is above all and,
thus, religion plays an integral role in symptom formation, management, and acceptance [32]. This
ﬁnding is in line with that of other research conducted in Tanzania and Malaysia, which also reported
acceptance, faith, and religious practices to be the most common and eﬀective coping strategies used
by caregivers [33,34]. It is likely that the similarity in results between the current study and those
conducted in Malaysia and Tanzania is, in part, related to the shared belief between the samples, namely,
mostly Muslim and with shared a belief in God and fate. On the other hand, the less eﬀective coping
strategies noted by the caregivers in the current study were avoidance, ignoring, and engagement with
the person’s non-reality-based thinking (i.e., hallucinations and delusions). These are also reﬂected in
caregivers of people with mental disorders in other countries for example in Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, and
India [7,35,36]. It should be noted that the majority of caregiving was provided by women, making
them more susceptible to caregiver burdens [16]. Moreover, the lower levels of mental health literacy
and the limited knowledge among Saudi caregivers of people with mental disorders put them at

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6405

12 of 15

higher risk of practicing poor coping techniques [37]. Caregivers were divided in their responses
and opinions when asked about the general public’s awareness regarding mental disorders, though
numerous misconceptions shared by the public were pointed out by the caregivers under this theme.
The majority of caregivers shared the perception that Saudi society still believes that there is a strong
relationship between the cause and occurrence of mental disorders and black magic, the evil eye, and
possession. A similar ﬁnding has been noted in a Malaysian study, where caregivers reported that
there was a tendency to seek out traditional faith healers to cure mental disorders, as there is a societal
sense of believing in evil spirits and possession [34]. The messages from caregivers to the public and
other caregivers were to educate oneself, increase the availability of mental health services, practice
acceptance, and seek out help from mental health services without shame. This highlights a need for
future research and practice.

4.1. Implications for Future Research and Practice

The ﬁndings of the current study point to a need for solutions to reduce the burdens and
challenges of caregivers of people with mental disorders. Moreover, this study highlights signiﬁcant
implications for mental health professionals and, in particular, nurses. There is a need for mental
health nurses to focus not only on the care they provide to people with mental disorders, but to
extend their care to include the individual’s primary caregivers. As the above-mentioned results of the
current study explain, family caregivers face challenges and experience diﬀerent types of burdens,
and are, in turn, susceptible to the development of psychological disorders themselves. This poses a
signiﬁcant implication for nursing practice that matches the literature, which suggests that nurses have
a professional responsibility to provide holistic care to caregivers in the form of counseling, family
and supportive therapy, promotion of self-care activities, education on eﬀective coping strategies,
and health teaching [38,39]. Moreover, the advocacy, supportive services, and education provided
by nurses to caregivers can contribute to the prevention of physical exhaustion and burnout among
caregivers, and can contribute to an increase in societal mental health awareness. Based on the collected
data, there exists a need to raise public awareness about mental disorders and to accept people with
mental disorders and their families. This presents a unique area for future research within the Arabic
context to reduce stigma which may not translate cross-culturally [40]. Furthermore, there is a dire
need to provide supportive services and education to caregivers to increase their knowledge about
how to deal with diﬀerent mental illnesses. Additionally, there is a need to encourage the engagement
of caregivers of people with mental illnesses with the community.

4.2. Study Limitations

The use of social media platforms to recruit participants meant that a larger potential sample were
notiﬁed about the study, however, we note that caregivers experiencing burden may not be accessing
such platforms, particularly in times of stress. There is also the potential for sampling bias, as those
who replied and participated were motivated to do so. As such, the ﬁndings presented in this paper
provide insight into family caregivers experiences, which have generated new hypotheses for the
study team to further investigate, but cannot be considered representative of all family caregivers with
relatives experiencing mental illness.

Finally, these data contain experiences from an Arab culture, building on a limited data set
speaking to mental illness in Middle Eastern countries. However, the ﬁndings may also have relevance
for healthcare workers who are caring for the many families who have emigrated beyond these
boarders. To this end, the research team chose to translate the data into English to enable greater scope
for dissemination. Though it should be noted that some cultural nuances in the language used by
participants may have been lost in the translation process. This speaks to a wider limitation within the
scientiﬁc community, and the need for increased duel-language publications.

5. Conclusions

Our ﬁndings suggest that caregivers experience distinct types of challenges that can disrupt their
biopsychosocial integrity, such as dealing with the symptoms of mental disorders and possible violence,
physical burnout, emotional burden, impaired family dynamics and role shifting, as well as stigma
related to public views. Additionally, the results emphasize the need to identify the diﬀerent types
of care, the eﬀectiveness of the coping strategies of caregivers, and the types of support they require.
Furthermore, this research highlights the advice and messages that caregivers would like to share with
other caregivers and members of the public in order to correct their misconceptions about the causes
and treatment of mental and psychological disorders. Finally, we mentioned the application of nursing
care, which should not only focus on people with mental disorders, but should also be directed toward
their caregivers, who face many challenges and experience diﬀerent types of burdens.
