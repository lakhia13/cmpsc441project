for early intervention?

Abstract

Aim: The early intervention (EI) model
appears
to improve outcomes of
psychosis for younger people, and
there is now interest in implementing it
in older groups. In the UK, the National
Institute of Clinical Excellence advised
that EI should be accessible to all
individuals with first episode psychosis
(FEP). We aimed to explore the likely
impact on EI workloads and clinical
populations of extending age range.

Methods: Data were collected on all
patients aged 36–65 years who were
referred to an inner London EI service
from 2011–2014 using the MiData 2
tool at entry and at 1-year follow up.

Results: People aged between 36 and
65 represented 30% of all referrals to
the service. There were high levels of

recorded past trauma in the sample
(62.5%), half had dependent children
(58.3%) and just under half physical
comorbidity
(48.6%). Duration of
untreated psychosis was less than a
year for the majority. At 1-year follow
inpatient admission rates were
up,
lower
than in previously studied
younger EI populations, but only 15%
experienced a single episode with full
remission.

Conclusions: These findings indicate
that admitting over 35-year-olds to EI
results in a substantial
increase in
workload. A large proportion had
become unwell
relatively recently,
indicating that the concept of EI may
not be redundant in this age range.
Evidence is needed on EI effectiveness
in this group.

Key words: early intervention, older patients, outcome, psychosis.

INTRODUCTION

Significant benefits have been established for the early
intervention (EI) model, with improvements in recovery
rates and reductions in relapse, suicides and overall
costs.1–6 Guidelines (e.g. IRIS,7 Mental Health Policy
Implementation Guide,8 Orygen9 and STEP10) have
recommended a youth focus, with for example 35 the
usual upper age limit in the UK. This reflects a
recognition of specific difficulties associated with early
disruption of personal and social development by
psychosis, and an aim to engage young people by
tailoring services to their needs and interests and making
them feel accessible and acceptable,
for example
through group activities with similar aged peers.

However, a concern for equity has resulted in
debate about whether EIS should be extended to

to
older age groups. This is especially relevant
women, who on average present later.11 It is also
recognized that many of the interventions delivered
by EIS are in practice not age specific.

Potential arguments against extending EIS age
range include that older groups will have significantly
different needs from the population EIS was set up
to treat, so that benefits cannot be assumed to
generalize. For example, organic factors may be more
prominent, requiring different expertise in assessment
and management than presentations in younger
people. Older people may have been ill for longer
and may be beyond the ‘critical period’ hypothesized
as being crucial for long-term outcomes.12–14 The
different life stage of this group, having already
achieved adult roles, may mean that they do not need
the intensive occupational and functional support

that EIS provide. An important potential adverse effect
of extending the EIS age range is dilution of the youth
focus.

We have found only one recent paper that
examined clinical characteristics by age. Selvenrdra
et al.15 found that over 25 s in an Australian cohort
were more likely to have depressive psychosis and
had more metabolic morbidity than under 25 s.
Beyond this, little relevant literature is available to
inform service planning for the over 35 s. In England,
this is a particularly pressing need, as the latest
update of National Institute of Clinical Excellence
Guidelines for psychosis and schizophrenia in adults
16 (1.3.1.1) recommends that EI be available across
the age range. The English experience is also of
interest for other countries where issues of equity
have been raised in relation to EI services.

Aims

In this paper, we will aim to

1. Describe the numbers and characteristics of over
35 s referred to an EI service which since 2011 has
accepted people aged 18 to 65.

2. Make a preliminary assessment of the extent to
which there may be scope to intervene early in this
group to improve the course of their illness,
including examining the stage of illness at which
they present, whether they already recover well
without an intensive intervention, and whether a
service that is socially as well as clinically focused
appears relevant to them.

METHODS

Setting

The EI services in Camden & Islington cover a diverse
inner-city population with a combined total popu-
lation of 435 800 individuals.17 Local rates of new
presentations with psychosis are high.17 The area
was one of the earlier ones in England to be served
by an EIS, established in 2003. However, over the
study period, caseloads were very high (at times over
30 per care coordinator) because of a combination of
local
resource constraints and large numbers
resulting from the extension of the age range. There
was also an inadequate supply of specialist family,
psychological or vocational interventions during this
period. The local consensus was thus that the EI
model was no longer being delivered with adequate
fidelity at this time. Outcome data reported here

should not thus be seen as reflecting what could
potentially be achieved by a good quality EIS.

Sample

Data were collected for all patients aged 36–65 years
referred and accepted onto the caseload of Camden
& Islington EIS, from the time when referrals to over
35 s opened in 2011 to January 2014. During this
period, the local service policy was that all new cases
of psychosis should be referred to EIS, and there was
little indication of breaches of this guidance.

Measures

The Midata-2 tool was completed by local clinicians
(S Joshi, A Gregorowicz) from review of electronic
records, supplemented by some discussion with
other clinicians to fill gaps (Appendix S1 shows the
Midata-2 tool). Data were collected at point of EIS
referral and 1 year later. MiData-2 is a new brief
baseline and follow-up tool designed for collecting
routine audit and service evaluation data in EI. Paper
and Microsoft Access versions are available. It is a
revised shortened version of the MiData standardized
data collection tool developed by the London Early
Intervention Research Network (LEIRN).18 MiData-2
includes
and clinical data
(symptoms, duration of untreated psychosis (DUP),
pathways into care, social functioning, substance
misuse, service use and course of illness).

sociodemographic

MiData-2 includes assessment of DUP with a
revised version of the Nottingham Onset Schedule.19
Service DUP was defined as months between the
appearance of the first positive psychotic symptom
and date of referral to EIS. ICD-10 (International
Classification of Diseases-10)20 diagnosis at 1-year
follow up was as confirmed by the responsible
consultant psychiatrist and grouped as non-affective
psychosis (codes F20–29), manic psychosis (F30.2,
F31.2 or F31.5), depressive psychosis (F32.3, F33.3 or
F39) and other.

components were based on respective sub-scales of
the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF-S and
GAF-D).23 The categories of illness course were (i)
single episode with full remission; (ii) single episode
with partial remission; (iii) repeated episodes with full
remission;
repeated episodes with partial
remission; (v) continuous illness (in the same episode
as when presented to EIS); and (vi) not known. An
episode was defined as a period of continuous

positive and/or negative psychotic symptoms that
interfere with thinking and/or behaviour. Partial
remission was defined as residual positive and/or
marked negative psychotic symptoms that still have
some impact on thinking/behaviour (GAF-S > =31),
but sufficient
improvement meaning individuals
can function safely in the community (with support)
with some functional improvement (GAF-D > =31)
but not able to hold down a job or study; while full
remission required no evidence of positive symptoms
and only minimal negative symptoms that do not
interfere with behaviour (GAF-S > = 61), where the
individual has good functioning (GAF-D > =61) and
is capable of engaging in vocational activity.

Procedures

The study was approved locally in Camden and
Islington NHS Foundation Trust under procedures
for audit and service evaluation: it informed the further
development of services for over 35 s. Descriptive tests
were used to analyse and present the data.

RESULTS

The referral rate to Camden and Islington EIS for all
patients between 2011 and 2014 was approximately
97 referrals per 100 000 population over 18 per year.
For each 100 000 population, there were 68 new cases
in the 18–35 and 29 in the 36–65 range.

During the study period, 75 patients were identi-
fied as having been accepted to caseload who were
over 35. Data for three patients were excluded
because of limited baseline data and lack of follow-
up data, or because of patient non-engagement with
the service from the point of acceptance. Therefore,
data were available for a total of 72 patients aged 35
and over.

Sociodemographic characteristics

Clinical characteristics

Both genders were equally represented (Table 1). The
median referral age was 46 years. A wide range of
ethnicities was represented, the largest groups being
White British and Black African. Most had been
employed in the past, but only a third during the year
prior to EIS referral.

More than half had children: 58.1% of those with
children under 18 lived with them. Nearly, half lived
alone and very few with a partner. Most reported
some social contacts.

Whilst initial referrals tended to come from primary
care, the immediate source of the majority of referrals
to EIS was from secondary mental health services
(Table 2). Just under two-thirds had reported a
history of significant trauma to clinicians. Half had
known physical health comorbidity. A lifetime history
of cannabis use was reported to clinicians by a third.
About a quarter had a known history of a previous
suicide attempt or self-harm prior to the time of
referral, and a quarter had a known history of

One-year follow up

Nearly, all patients remained on caseload (Table 3).
Less than a quarter were known to have worked in
the last year. There was no change in the distribution
of living arrangements or social contacts between
entry to EIS and 1-year follow up. There was also no
change in the number of patients with known
physical health comorbidity over the course of
the ear.

The most

frequent primary diagnosis was of
a ‘non-affective psychosis’
followed by
(65.3%),
‘manic psychosis’ (15.3%) and ‘depressive psychosis’
(13.9%). The course of illness was equally distributed
between categories, but at 1-year follow up, very few
had had only one episode of psychosis with full
remission.

Almost half had inpatient admissions either at
point of referral to EIS or within the first year
of EIS care. More than half were taking regular
antipsychotics at follow up. Only a fifth were known

to have undertaken formal cognitive behavioural
therapy with the service. The number of patients
who had self-harmed or attempted suicide or were
known to have perpetrated an act of violence during
their first year on the EIS caseload was extremely
small.

DISCUSSION

Ours is the first study to describe the characteristics
of patients over 35 presenting with FEP and their
1-year outcomes following referral to a specialist EIS.
Referrals for people aged between 36 and 65
represented 30% of total referrals to the service after
extension of the age range. Thus, the additional
needs for EI services and impact on overall caseload
size were considerable. The only directly relevant
data for comparison with younger populations are
from the MiData project, a cohort of 533 under
36 year-olds presenting with FEP across London,
assessed with similar procedures and an overlapping
set of measures.18 Unlike our
sample, men
predominated in this younger cohort (68% vs 52%).
Such gender differences have previously been
documented,1,24 with gender balance evening out in
later presenters,15,25 when there is also a recognized
later life peak in incidence in psychosis in women.11
Thus, gender as well as age discrimination is an issue
when considering the EIS age limit.

Our sample was similar to the younger MiData
cohort in ethnic distribution, with more than half from
black and minority ethnic (BME) groups. The same
number (58%) in each cohort reported that they had
social relationships that were a significant source of
support. More of the older cohort had been employed
at some stage (87% vs 63%) and more had children
(58.3% vs 11%), in our older cohort. A larger number
was living alone than in the younger cohort (44.4% vs
17%).18

Clinical characteristics

At 11 months, the median DUP for our cohort was
substantially longer
than the median DUP of
4 months among younger Londoners in the previous
MiData study.18 Thus, as predicted, there were larger
numbers than in younger groups who had been ill for
a considerable period. However, the majority had a
DUP of less than 1 year at time of referral, so there
were a substantial number for whom intervention
could realistically be described as early.

When compared with the MiData younger cohort18
in terms of clinical characteristics, there were higher

rates of past suicide or self-harm in our group
(26.4% vs 14%) but similar rates of past history of
violent behaviour (25% vs 29%). Lifetime cannabis
use reported to staff was lower in our sample (34.7%
vs 58%) than in the younger cohort.

Half our sample had physical health comorbidity of
some type. Recorded morbidities were wide-ranging
without clear predominance of metabolic morbidity,
which was particularly highlighted in the Australian
paper looking at late-onset presenters.15 However,
metabolic morbidity was not explicitly asked about
in our study, and it may not have been well screened
for in the service.

The majority had reported a history of trauma to
assessing clinicians. This is in keeping with accu-
mulating evidence on trauma and psychosis,26
especially in relation to childhood adversity. Thus,
the recent National Institute of Clinical Excellence
guidelines recommendation that all patients presenting
with psychosis should be assessed for post traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD)16 (1.3.3.2) certainly appears
relevant for this group. We cannot comment on how
this compares to the younger EI population. However,
further research in this area does support higher levels
of reporting of childhood abuse in women with
psychotic illness, than in men.27 The gender makeup
of our sample (more women than in the younger
MiData group) could therefore be one factor
influencing the level of trauma reporting in this older
age group.

One-year follow up

Relatively few of the cohort were working at the point
of referral, and the proportion was no higher at follow
up, suggesting a potential unmet need. During the
study period, resources for psychological and social
interventions were very limited, and the team lacked
a dedicated vocational worker. The relatively low
levels of vocational recovery and the frequently
continuous or recurrent pattern of illness suggest that
early intervention to optimize social recovery and
prevent future decline is a relevant goal.

Primary psychiatric diagnosis amongst the over 35
group was consistent with findings from the recent
Australian Paper looking at older onset psychosis,15
and previous studies of younger patients with
psychotic disorders.18

Almost half our sample had an inpatient admission
within 1 year (including index admissions prompting
the initial EIS referral). This is lower than in a recent
study by Mann et al. (2014)28 looking at rates of
inpatient admission in the first year following referral
to mental health services, across four EI services

(including London). Their data showed rates of
63.2%, for the same time period.

Strength and limitations

The large increase in caseload without increase in
resources meant that the team was unable to deliver
a high fidelity model of care with a full range of
psychological and social interventions and may well
also have affected outcomes.

The sample was derived from two ethnically
and socioeconomically diverse inner-city London
boroughs,17 a setting not demographically represen-
tative of England, which limits generalizability.
Additionally, the findings were based on extracting
clinician recorded data from electronic patient
records to complete the MiData-2 audit tool rather
than directly elicited patient data. However, data were
collected for the complete cohort of over 35 s taken on
by the service during the study period and not
selected. One of the questions this paper does not
answer is about the impact on the youth focus, and
whether the more diverse age range has affected the
accessibility and acceptability of an EIS for younger
patients. The sample methodology is predominantly
descriptive, but description of a complete cohort of
early intervention service users over 35 is of
considerable current interest in the current context
where changes in age range are contemplated.

Our study focuses on patients who were assessed as
having FEP and taken onto the team caseload
following initial contact with the service. Only one
diagnosis of organic psychosis was recorded in this
group (Table 3). However, a study limitation is that
we do not have precise data regarding numbers
screened out as having psychosis of organic origin
either prior to referral to EIS or during the initial EIS
assessment prior to acceptance onto the caseload. It
is also possible that
some organic conditions
remained undetected at 1-year follow up in this
cohort. Thus, it is possible that organic psychoses are
less rare in this age group than our findings suggest.

Clinical implications

results suggest

Increasing age range of early intervention services
will significantly increase referral rates and case load
numbers.
Our

there may be scope for
improving outcomes in people between 36 and
65 years
through
implementation of a full EI model, perhaps with some
adaptation to our service. People in this age group
presented in substantial numbers with psychosis and

presenting with

psychosis

while some illnesses appeared very longstanding most
were of more recent onset. The range of diagnoses was
not strikingly different to younger people. Most had
persisting or recurrent difficulties, with just 15%
having a single episode with full remission, and most
had not made a good occupational recovery at a year,
despite the majority having worked in the past. Almost
half were admitted in their first year of contact with
services, although recorded levels of violent and
suicidal behaviour were relatively low. Thus, there is
considerable room for improvement in the outcomes
obtained in this service, which was of low fidelity at
the time of the study.

health

assessment, monitoring

The study findings also suggest some areas, which
may be particularly important for this age group, with
implications for staff skills and training. Many of this
age group have dependents,
so support with
parenting, considering children’s needs, young carers
and addressing safeguarding issues is likely to be a
substantial role in working with this group. The high
numbers of patients with comorbid physical health
problems suggest that expertise and support around
physical
and
specialist prescribing is likely to be important.
Although probably a common need for all services
caring for patients with psychosis16 adequate
psychological support and staff training in trauma
and psychosis and PTSD likewise seem to be
important in tailoring services to this group’s needs.
An important recognized part of EI care is targeting
welfare, vocational and occupational support to the
needs of the group. With regard to occupational
recovery, the task in a group who have in the main
worked previously may involve supporting a return
to previously established career trajectories rather
than establishing a working life or educational
pathway afresh. The low numbers working during
the year after initial service contact in this cohort
suggest a role for specialist vocational input.

Research implications

An assessment of the profiles of older people with
psychosis based on researcher-recorded data is
desirable, as is data from a more representative range
of areas. To establish more conclusively the case for
EI in over 35 s, further research should investigate
whether an EI model for people over 35 is effective
and cost-effective compared with standard care from
generic psychosis services, as previously available.
Impact on younger groups of widening the age range
should also be investigated: we need to establish
whether
including older groups results in less
acceptable and engaging care for younger groups.

and of supporting older people in re-establishing
