Background:  Mindfulness-based  stress  reduction  (MBSR)  alleviates  depression  and  anxiety  in  adults  with  autism  spectrum  disorder 
(ASD); however, underlying therapeutic neural mechanisms and mindfulness-specific effects have yet to be elucidated. Methods: We ran-
domly assigned adults with ASD to MBSR or social support/education (SE). They completed questionnaires that assessed depression, anx-
iety, mindfulness traits, autistic traits and executive functioning abilities as well as a self-reflection functional MRI task. We used repeated-
measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to evaluate behavioural changes. To identify task-specific connectivity changes, we performed 
a generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) functional connectivity (FC) analysis on regions of interest (ROIs;  insula, amygdala, 
cingulum and prefrontal cortex [PFC]). We used Pearson correlations to explore brain–behaviour relationships.  Results: Our final sample 
included 78 adults with ASD — 39 who received MBSR and 39 who received SE. Mindfulness-based stress reduction uniquely improved 
executive functioning abilities and increased mindfulness traits, whereas both MBSR and SE groups showed reductions in depression, anx-
iety and autistic traits. Decreases specific to MBSR in insula–thalamus FC were associated with anxiety reduction and increased mindful-
ness  traits,  including  the  trait  “nonjudgment;”  MBSR-specific  decreases  in  PFC–posterior  cingulate  connectivity  correlated  with  improved 
working memory. Both groups showed decreased amygdala–sensorimotor and medial–lateral PFC connectivity, which corresponded with 
reduced depression. Limitations: Larger sample sizes and neuropsychological evaluations are needed to replicate and extend these find-
ings.  Conclusion:  Together,  our  findings  suggest  that  MBSR  and  SE  are  similarly  efficacious  for  depression,  anxiety  and  autistic  traits, 
whereas MBSR produced additional salutary effects related to executive functioning and mindfulness traits. Findings from gPPI identified 
shared and distinct therapeutic neural mechanisms, implicating the default mode and salience networks. Our results mark an early step to-
ward the development of personalized medicine for psychiatric symptoms in ASD and offer novel neural targets for future neurostimulation 
research. Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04017793.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most pervasive 
neurodevelopmental conditions, affecting 1 in 54 children,1 who 
are at greater risk for developing co-occurring neuro psychiatric 
disorders.2 Estimates put the risk of depression around quadru-
ple that of the general population,3 with an anxiety disorder oc-
currence  of  about  40  %4  in  individuals  with  autism.  Conse-
quences  can  be  devastating,  including  a  sevenfold  greater 
likelihood of suicide.5 Moreover, deficits in executive function-
ing  —  critical  to  managing  mood  and  anxiety6  —  remain  im-
paired across the lifespan of individuals with ASD.7 Together, 
these challenges compound pre-existing ASD- related difficulties 
with  maintaining  long-term  independence  and  employment.8 

Although  current  pharmacotherapies  are  largely  unsuccessful 
because of poor medication compliance, lack of therapeutic ef-
fectiveness  and  adverse  effects,9  mindfulness-based  therapies 
(MBTs)  show  promise  in  mitigating  depression  and  anxiety 
symptoms  in  adults  with  ASD10  and  may  improve  executive 
functioning, as shown in other populations.11  

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an intensive 
8-week  meditation  intervention  aimed  at  directing  attention 
toward  present-moment  awareness  with  a  nonjudgmental 
and  nonreactive  attitude.  In  2013,  Spek  and  colleagues12,13 
adapted the original MBSR protocol for adults with ASD and 
reported  reductions  in  depression  and  anxiety  relative  to 
wait-list  controls  that  persisted  9  weeks  after  the  interven-
tion.  Antidepressant  and  anxiolytic  effects  of  MBSR  have

 using  cognitive  behavioural  therapy  (CBT)14  and  social 
 support/relaxation education (SE)15 comparison groups. Other 
improvements  in  quality  of  life,  emotion  regulation,  autistic 
traits,  stress  and  rumination  have  also  been  reported.12,16,17 
 Interestingly, social support is embedded in MBTs, and the lack 
thereof has been linked to loneliness and depression in adults 
with autism.18 Together, early research with small samples sug-
gests MBTs have broad therapeutic efficacy in adults with ASD; 
however, it remains unclear if these effects are specific to mind-
fulness.  In  addition,  the  magnitude  of  therapeutic  improve-
ments  in  ASD  has  yet  to  be  thoroughly  characterized  using 
 rigorous clinical designs with active comparison interventions. 
Little is known about the therapeutic neural mechanisms of 
MBSR in adults with ASD, with the exception of a single pilot 
study implicating the middle cingulate cortex (or dorsal anter-
ior cingulate cortex [dACC]) in MBSR-elicited alleviation of de-
pression  symptomatology.15  In  major  depressive  disorder 
(MDD), MBTs are theorized to exert therapeutic effects by nor-
malizing maladaptive patterns of negative self-beliefs and atten-
tional biases and rumination via cortical  midlines  structures.19 
In adults with ASD, self-focused attention predicts depressive 
symptoms, supporting this idea.20 Mindfulness-based therapies 
enhance decentring, the capacity to take a detached perspective 
of  one’s thoughts and emotions, which  is associated with  less 
depression21 and offers a potential mechanism of action in ASD. 
Accordingly,  functional  MRI  (fMRI)  tasks  tapping  into  self-
referential cognition activate overlapping brain regions as those 
modulated by meditation, including the insula, prefrontal cor-
tex (PFC), cingulum and amygdala.22–24 A 2016 systemic review 
cited these brain regions as key targets of MBSR, irrespective of 
task  and  neuroimaging  modality.25  Elucidating  therapeutic 
 neural mechanisms of MBSR may provide novel  insights  into 
the cause of psychiatric comorbidities in ASD, assist in develop-
ing personalized-medicine approaches and inform novel targets 
for neurostimulation research.

We conducted a double-blind RCT to compare the clinical 
efficacy of an 8-week MBSR intervention with an SE interven-
tion  for  depression,  anxiety,  autism  symptoms,  executive 
functioning and mindfulness traits in an adequately powered 
sample  of  adults  with  ASD.  We  also  sought  to  identify 
shared  and  distinct  alterations  to  functional  self-reflection 
neurocircuitry in the insula, cingulum, PFC and amygdala.25 
We  used  a  task-dependent  fMRI  functional  connectivity 
analy sis  known  as  generalized  psychophysiological  interac-
tions (gPPI) to identify mindfulness-induced changes to self-
reflection  neurocircuitry  in  these  regions  of  interest  (ROIs). 
We then evaluated these connectivity metrics for associations 
with therapeutic improvement. We hypothesized that MBSR 
and  SE  would  elicit  reductions  in  depression,  anxiety  and 
 autistic traits based on previous literature on MBSR and SE in 
ASD;26,27 that MBSR would have additional efficacy for execu-
tive  functioning  and  mindfulness  traits,  as  found  in  other 
populations;11 that the MBSR group alone would show altera-
tions to insular, ACC and lateral PFC (lPFC) functional con-
nectivity,  given  previous  findings  for  MBSR  neuroimaging 
pertaining  to  interoception,  salience  detection  and  executive 
functioning;28–30 and that both groups would show alterations 

to  amygdala,  posterior  cingulate  cortex  (PCC)  and  medial 
PFC (mPFC) functional connectivity patterns, based on previ-
ous  literature  showing  inverse  relationships  between  social 
support  and  depression  and  anxiety  in  ASD,26  and  salutary 
effects  of  social  support  on  amygdala  reactivity  and  default 
mode network (DMN) dynamics.31,32 

Methods

Participants and intervention groups

Our study protocol was approved by Arizona State Univer-
sity’s  Institutional  Review  Board,  and  all  participants  pro-
vided  written,  informed  consent,  in  accordance  with  the 
Declaration of Helsinki. 

Adults  with  ASD  who  met  the  following  inclusion  criteria 
were recruited: an ASD diagnosis confirmed using the Autism 
Diagnostic  Observation  Schedule-2  (ADOS-2),33  administered 
by  an  experienced  research-reliable  member  of  the  Southwest 
Autism Resource and Diagnostic Center, and DSM-534 criteria, 
as  assessed  by  an  experimental  psychologist  with  20  years  of 
experience  in  ASD;  and  an  IQ  score  greater  than  70  on  the 
Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT-2).35 We 
excluded  participants  based  on  active  suicidality,  history  of 
traumatic brain injury and substance abuse, but not on the  basis 
of  sex,  age  or  general  comorbidities  (e.g.,  single  cases  of  epi-
lepsy,  Tourette  syndrome,  bipolar  disorder  and  hearing  loss). 
No handedness restrictions were imposed. Power analyses for 
repeated  measures  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  based  on 
2  = 
MBSR  depression  findings  in  ASD  (medium  effect  size,  ηp
0.35) have suggested a sample size of 82 was sufficient to detect 
medium effects between groups with power set at 0.80.14

Participants were randomly assigned to an 8-week inter-
vention  of  MBSR  or  SE  by  a  team  member  unassociated 
with  the  delivery  of  treatment,  data  collection  or  analyses, 
using  a  block  design  “ABBA”  sequence.  The  standard 
MBSR protocol was minimally adapted for adults with ASD 
as described previously.15

Self-reported behavioural measures

Pre-  and  postintervention  questionnaires  were  administered 
by  team  members  blinded  to  participant  allocation  (E.H., 
D.O., L.M. and S.D.) at the fMRI appointment within 1 month 
before  and  after  the  intervention  to  assess  depression  (Beck 
Depression  Inventory-II  [BDI-II]);  state  and  trait  anxiety 
symptoms  (State–Trait  Anxiety  Inventory  [STAI]-1  and  -2); 
autism  traits  (Social  Responsiveness  Scale,  second  edition 
[SRS-2]);  mindfulness  traits  (Five  Facets  Mindfulness  Ques-
tionnaire [FFMQ], and its 5 subscales, “Describe,” “Observe,” 
“Act,”  “Nonreactivity”  and  “Nonjudgment”);  and  executive 
functioning abilities (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive 
Function  [BRIEF]  and  its  8  subscales:  “Working  Memory,” 
“Shift,”  “Monitor,”  “Inhibit,”  “Initiate,”  “Plan,”  “Organize” 
and  “Emotional  Control”).  An  intention-to-treat  approach 
was implemented, which allowed participants with complete 
pre/post  data  sets  to  be  included  in  the  analysis,  regardless 
of extent of participation in the intervention.

Neural mechanisms of MBSR in adults with autism 
Acquisition of fMRI

Functional connectivity analyses

Imaging data were collected on a 3 T Philips Ingenia scanner 
with  a  maximum  gradient  strength  of  45  mT/m  at  the 
 Barrow  Neurological  Institute  (Phoenix,  Arizona).  T 2*-
weighted images were acquired with a gradient echo, echo-
planar  pulse  sequence  to  elicit  blood  oxygen  level– 
dependent  (BOLD)  contrast.  The  scanning  parameters  were 
slice  thickness  3  mm,  echo  time  (TE)  30  ms,  repetition  time 
(TR) 2000 ms, flip angle 90°, in-plane resolution 64 × 64, field 
of view 240 mm, and voxel size  3 mm × 3 mm. Images from 
the first 3 TRs were discarded to allow for stabilization. 3D 
 magnetization–prepared  rapid  acquisition  gradient  echo  T1 
images were used for preprocessing (170 sagittal slices, slice 
thickness 1.2 mm, in-plane resolution 256 × 256, field of view 
240 mm).

Self-reflection task using fMRI

Functional MRI scans were obtained during a self-reflection 
task  before  and  after  the  intervention.  Participants  re-
sponded  yes  or  no  to  trait  adjectives  for  2  conditions:  self-
condition (participants decided whether they possessed the 
trait  adjective)  and  word-condition  (participants  decided 
whether  the  adjective  was  positively  valenced)  (see  Pagni 
and colleagues15 for a detailed task description). 

Preprocessing and modelling of fMRI

Preprocessing  of  fMRI  data  was  completed  using  SPM12 
(Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, http://www.
fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm),  including  slice  timing  correction, 
realignment  to  the  mean  image,  coregistration  to  the 
skull-stripped  T1,  normalization  to  the  Montreal  Neuro-
logical  Institute  (MNI)  space  using  the  Diffeomorphic 
Anatomical  Registration  Through  Exponentiated  Lie  Al-
gebra  (DARTEL)  method,36  and  8  mm  full-width  at  half-
maximum  Gaussian  kernel  spatial  smoothing.  Scrubbing 
parameters  for  scans  exceeding  5  mm  relative  displace-
ment  were  generated  using  the  Artifact  Detection  Tools 
toolbox  in  CONN  (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/
conn). The CONN-fMRI toolbox uses anatomical com pon-
ent correction (aCompCor) to remove noise and movement 
confounds  on  a  voxel-to-voxel  basis.  Denoising  param-
eters  consisted  of  white  matter  (6P),  cerebrospinal  fluid 
(CSF;  6P),  realignment  (6P)  and  scrubbing  (117P);  no  de-
rivatives  or  polynomial  expansion  were  applied.  We  in-
cluded  parameters  for  the  effects  of  pre-word  (2P),  pre-
self  (2P),  post-word  (2P)  and  post-self  (2P)  with 
first-order  derivatives.  Data  were  bandpass  filtered 
(0.008–0.09  Hz),  despiked  after  regression  and  linear  de-
trended. We used gPPI, a more recent version of PPI with 
improved  sensitivity,  to  identify  task-modulated  func-
tional connectivity. The gPPI was computed using bivari-
ate regression in CONN with the following regressors: re-
gressor  for  self-conditions,  regressor  for  word-condition, 
time-series  regressor  for  the  seed  region,  PPI  term  for 
self-condition, and PPI term for word-condition.

All behavioural and neuroimaging analyses were performed by 
researchers blinded to participant allocation (B.P. and B.B.B.). We 
selected neuroanatomical ROIs based on a systematic review of 
MBSR-mediated neural changes implicating the insula, amyg-
dala, cingulum, dlPFC and mPFC,25 with dlPFC defined as the 
bilateral  superior  frontal  gyrus  (SFG)  and  mPFC  defined  as 
the bilateral frontal medial cortex (FMC) and frontal pole (FP). At 
the second level, we performed seed-to-voxel analyses using the 
Harvard–Oxford  atlas  in  CONN  at  hypothesized  ROIs  for 
 behavioural group × time interactions (MBSR > SE) and main ef-
fects of time (MBSR + SE) for post-self > pre-self and post-word = 
pre-word contrasts, with the number of classes as a covariate. We 
set α as a false discovery rate (FDR)–corrected p value less than 
0.05  for  target  clusters.  Significant  ROIs  were  Bonferroni- 
corrected for left or right hemisphere for the insula, amygdala, 
SFG, FMC and FP (pFDR = 0.025); anterior and posterior divisions 
of  the  cingulum  were  corrected  similarly  (ACC  and  PCC, 
respect ively, pFDR = 0.025). Owing to stringent FDR and Bonfer-
roni correction, we accepted 1- and 2-sided/tailed (positive and 
nega tive contrast) tests. Regions of interest are shown in Figure 1.

Behavioural analyses

We  performed  repeated-measures  analyses  of  covariance 
 (ANCOVAs) using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, 
version 26 (SPSS-26), to examine behavioural group × time inter-
actions and main effects of time, with the number of classes at-
tended entered as a covariate. Our primary measures of interest 
were  BDI-II,  STAI-1,  STAI-2,  SRS-2,  FFMQ  (total  score)  and 
BRIEF  (total  score);  we  performed  exploratory  analyses  for 
FFMQ and BRIEF subscales without multiple comparison correc-
tion. For measures that showed significant behavioural change, 
we performed 2-sided Pearson correlations with age and IQ. 

Exploratory brain–behaviour relationships

We  calculated  pre-  to  post-change  scores  for  significant  be-
havioural group × time interactions and main effects of time. 
Next,  significant  functional  connectivity  changes  that  sur-
vived FDR and Bonferroni correction from the gPPI group by 
time and main effect of time analyses were extracted and en-
tered  into  a  1-tailed  Pearson  correlation  analysis  in  SPSS-26 
with  α  set  at  p  less  than  0.05,  with  the  connectivity  changes 
hypothesized to be in a therapeutic direction. 

Results

Participant demographics and behavioural effects

Ninety-six adults with ASD met our inclusion criteria; however, 
an attrition rate of 18.75% led to a final sample of 78 participants 
with partial or full pre- and postintervention data sets (39 who 
received  MBRS  and  39  who  received  SE;  Figure  2).  Group 
 demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1. The groups 
did not differ with respect to sex distribution, age, IQ, autism 
 severity or number of classes attended.

human brain atlas tool.

Behavioural  measures  were  not  complete  for  all  partici-
pants. We added the BRIEF questionnaire for the second and 
third  cohorts;  therefore,  this  measure  had  fewer  data  points 
(n  =  51)  available  for  analysis.  In  addition,  the  following 
meas ures  had  missing  questionnaires  from  either  before  or 
after  the  intervention  or  had  less  than  20%  of  the  questions 
completed: BDI-II, n = 2; STAI-1 and STAI-2, n = 4; SRS-2, n = 
2; FFMQ, n = 5; and BRIEF, n = 10 (Figure 2). 

Main effects of time (collapsed by group, MBSR + SE) were 
detected on the BDI-II, STAI-2 and SRS-2, indicating decreases 
in  depression,  trait  anxiety  and  autistic  traits  across  partici-
pants;  no  state  anxiety  changes  (STAI-1)  were  detected 
(Table  2).  We  detected  a  group  ×  time  interaction  for  FFMQ 
 total score; our exploratory analysis showed an MBSR- specific 
increase  on  the  FFMQ  Nonjudgment  subscale  (Table  2  and 
Figure  3B).  No  other  FFMQ  subscales  showed  significant  ef-
fects. There was no significant group × time interaction for the 
BRIEF total score; however, our exploratory analyses showed a 
group × time interaction on the BRIEF Working Memory sub-
scale,  with  an  MBSR-specific  improvement  (Table  2  and 
Figure  3B).  No  other  BRIEF  subscales  showed  significant  ef-
fects. Baseline IQ did not correlate with change scores on the 
BDI-II (r68 = –0.021,  p = 0.0868), STAI-2 (r67 = 0.033,  p = 0.791), 
SRS-2  (r72  =  0.002,  p  =  0.990),  FFMQ  Nonjudgment  subscale 
(r68  =  –0.001,  p =  0.996)  or  BRIEF  Working  Memory  subscale 
(r37 = 0.001, p = 0.995). Age also did not correlate with change 
scores on the BDI-II (r74 = 0.021, p = 0.861), STAI-2 (r73 = 0.126, 
p = 0.290), SRS-2 (r78 = 0.077,  p = 0.504), FFMQ Nonjudgment 
subscale  (r74  =  –0.029,  p =  0.808)  or  BRIEF  Working  Memory 
subscale (r42 = 0.111, p = 0.486).

Functional connectivity specific to MBSR

The left insula showed an MBSR-specific decrease in connec-
tivity with the bilateral thalamus (Table 3 and Figure 4A). In 
addition,  the  left  FP  showed  an  MBSR-specific  decrease  in 
connectivity  with  the  lingual  gyrus  (LG)  and  PCC  (Table  3 
and Figure 4B). No other ROIs showed group-specific effects 
after FDR and Bonferroni correction.

Nonspecific functional connectivity

We evaluated the main effects of time to identify nonspecific 
intervention  effects.  We  found  that  the  right  insula  showed 
an attenuated anticorrelation with the right FP following the 
intervention (Table 3 and Figure 5A). For the dlPFC, the left 
SFG  transitioned  from  positive  correlation  (pretreatment)  to 
anticorrelation  (post-treatment)  with  the  right  FP  (Table  3 
and  Figure  5B).  The  left  amygdala  transitioned  from  a  posi-
tive (pretreatment) to a negative correlation (post-treatment) 
with  the  left  pre-  and  postcentral  gyrus  and  central  opercu-
lum (Table 3 and Figure 5C). No other ROIs showed signifi-
cant effects after FDR and Bonferroni correction.

Brain–behaviour relationships

For  MBSR-specific  connectivity  changes,  decreased  insula–
thalamus  connectivity  was  associated  with  decreased  trait 
anxiety across all participants (r73 = 0.246, p = 0.018), increased 
FFMQ  total  scores  across  all  participants  (r73  =  –0.244,  p  = 
0.019)  and  increased  FFMQ  Nonjudgement  sucscale  scores

MBSR group alone (r37 = –0.327, p = 0.024;  Figure 6A–C). In 
addition,  decreased  FP–PCC  connectivity  correlated  with

BRIEF Working Memory subscale scores) across all partici-
pants  (r41  =  0.296,  p  =  0.030)  and  in  the  MBSR  group  alone 
(r19  =  0.399,  p  =  0.045;  Figure  6D).  For  group-nonspecific 
connectivity  changes,  decreased  amygdala–pre-/ 
postcentral gyrus connectivity was associated with reduced 
depression across all participants (r73 = 0.267, p = 0.011) and 
in the SE group alone (r36 = 0.330, p = 0.025; Figure 7A). In-
creased  insula–FP  connectivity  also  correlated  with  de-
creased  depression  across  all  participants  (r73  =  –0.226,  p  =

Figure  7B).  No  other  correlations  were  significant  for  the 
other behaviour or connectivity measures.

Discussion

As hypothesized, both the MBSR and SE groups showed re-
ductions in depression, anxiety and autistic traits, which sug-
gests  that  social  and  educational  support  are  adequate  in 
 diminishing psychological symptoms and improving mental 
health.  Our  findings  align  with  those  of  Sizoo  and  Kuiper,14 
who found no group differences in antidepressant and anxio-
lytic  effects  between  MBSR  and  cognitive  behavioural  ther-
apy (CBT). Such findings advocate for the use of active con-
trol groups rather than wait-list control groups to discern the 

“active ingredients” of mindfulness therapy.10,12 Importantly, 
future work including wait-list control groups will help char-
acterize  changes  associated  with  time  and  test/retest  effects 
to  better  understand  the  unique  therapeutic  elements  of 
MBSR  and  SE.  In  addition,  brain-based  investigations  are 
critical  to  distinguishing  whether  therapeutic  mechanisms 
are  nonoverlapping  or  overlapping.  If  nonoverlapping, 
neur al mechanisms can be targeted in an additive manner to 
maximize efficacy and promote long-term outcomes; if over-
lapping, SE is sufficient, and potentially preferred because it 
may be more affordably delivered by community leaders and 
accessible  via  online  social  platforms.  However,  if  mindful-
ness traits and working memory capacity are the outcomes of 
interest, MBSR may be preferred.

Mindfulness  training  uniquely  enhanced  nonjudgment 
and  improved  working  memory  abilities,  but  did  not 
broadly affect mindfulness traits and executive functioning 
as  hypothesized.  Alleviation  of  psychological  symptoms 
based on MBSR may be mediated by its emphasis on culti-
vating a nonjudgmental and nonreactive awareness.37 Lack 
of  changes  in  mindfulness  facets  of  acting,  observing  and 
describing  are  in  line  with  a  study  that  used  a  CBT  com-
parison  group38  but  not  a  wait-list  control  comparison 
showing  increases  in  all  5  traits.39  Our  results  suggest 
mindfulness  training  targets  nonjudgment,  but  it  remains 
unclear whether this effect is population specific or a prod-
uct  of  active  control  group  selection.39  Other  studies  have 
shown  that  pretreatment  levels  of  trait  mindfulness  and

autism  severity  predict  the  magnitude  of  MBSR  out-
comes.40,41  In  addition,  total  practice  hours  mediate  mind-
fulness trait changes, which in turn mediate mental health 
outcomes,38  supporting  the  notion  that  mindfulness  abil-
ities  are  key  dose–response–dependent  therapeutic  mech-
anisms. These factors should be considered in future stud-
ies aimed at developing personalized medicine approaches 
for adults with ASD.17

Although  findings  about  the  influence  of  MBSR  on  broad 
executive  functioning  have  been  mixed,  improvements  in 

memory  have  been  found  consistently  in  adolescents  and 
adults.42,43  Corroborating  these  relationships,  the  extent  of 
meditation training is associated with working memory and 
short- and long-term memory performance, which also sug-
gests dose–response effects.44 Our hypothesis of broad execu-
tive functioning improvements was only partially supported, 
with  MBSR-specific  improvements  being  restricted  to  work-
ing  memory.  Follow-up  studies  using  objective  executive 
functioning measures are required to elaborate these relation-
ships in adults with ASD.

Changes induced by MBSR in insular activity and functional 
connectivity are well-established and attributed to alterations in 
interoception, exteroception and emotional information process-
ing.25,28,29 In support of our hypothesis, the present study extends 
this  body  of  work  in  adults  with  ASD  by  showing  MBSR- 
specific decreases in insula–thalamus connectivity using a gPPI 
approach. Mindfulness-dependent changes in insula–thalamus 
connectivity were also reported by Farb and colleagues,45 who 
suggested  that  mindfulness  training  facilitates  the  transition 
from narrative self-focus, governed by the DMN, to present mo-
ment awareness, governed by the insula, thalamus and sensori-
motor cortices. Furthermore, differences in insula–thalamus con-
nectivity  have  been  reported  in  meditators  compared  with 
nonmeditators, and after psychopharmacological administration 
of  lysergic  acid  diethylamide,  which  possesses  robust  anti-
depressant and anxiolytic properties.46,47 Together, these studies 
suggest that insula–thalamus connectivity changes are not task- 
or population-specific and may be a common therapeutic cor-
relate of meditation and psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.

Brain–behaviour  correlations  showed  that  those  with  the 
greatest  decreases  in  insula–thalamus  connectivity  had 
greater  reductions  in  anxiety  (across  all  participants)  and 

greater increases in nonjudgment toward experience (driven 
by  MBSR).  This  association  mirrors  findings  reported  by 
 Parkinson and colleagues,48 who found that insula connectiv-
ity generally correlated with mindfulness traits, and Gorman 
and colleagues49 who proposed a “fear network” that impli-
cated  the  insula  and  thalamus  in  the  context  of  anxiety  dis-
orders. Moreover, individuals with high levels of worry also 
showed  insula  hyperactivation  during  emotional  process-
ing;50 however, to our knowledge, no studies to date have ref-
erenced  insula–thalamus  connectivity  in  the  context  of 
MBSR-induced  effects  or  anxiety;  therefore,  our  study  pro-
vides a novel therapeutic neural mechanism specific to mind-
fulness meditation in adults with ASD.

Frontal  pole–PCC  connectivity  changes  specific  to  MBSR 
align with results reported by Kral and colleagues,51 who found 
MBSR-specific alterations in this pathway. However, their find-
ing  was  in  the  opposite  direction,  likely  arising  from  resting-
state  versus  task-based  design  or  the  use  of  a  neurotypical 
popu lation.51 Aberrant  FP–PCC  connectivity  profiles  during 
self-reflection have been identified in ASD and associated with 
age, suggesting that mindfulness training may intervene on an 
ASD-affected  circuit.52  Posterior  cingulate  cortex  activity  is  a

common feature of novice but not expert meditators, which is 
suspected to represent the transition from effortful toward ef-
fortless attention to present moment experience;53 therefore, our 
findings  of  frontal  regulation  of  the  DMN  match  what  is  ex-
pected in novice practitioners. The identified PCC cluster also 
encompassed  the  LG  —  a  frequently  reported  region  in  the 

MBSR literature — which contributes to episodic memory.54 In 
line with this, FP–LG/PCC connectivity changes in our study 
correlated with improvements in working memory and might 
reflect decoupling of the anterior–posterior DMN axis, a circuit 
that  displays  pronounced  atypicality  in  ASD  underpinning 
defi cits in self-awareness.55

Figure  6:  Brain–behaviour  scatterplots  for  connectivity  changes  specific  to  mindfulness-based  stress  reduction  (MBSR;  p  <  0.05).  Associa-
tions  between  (A)  insula–thalamus  connectivity  and  State–Trait  Anxiety  Inventory-2  (STAI-2)  scores  across  all  participants,  (B)  insula– 
thalamus connectivity and Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) total scores across all participants, (C) insula–thalamus connectiv-
ity  and  FFMQ  Nonjudgment  subscale  scores  for  participants  who  received  the  MBSR  intervention,  and  (D)  left  frontal  pole  (FP)–posterior 
cingulate  cortex  (PCC)/lingual  gyrus  (LG)  connectivity  and  Behavior  Rating  Inventory  of  Executive  Function  (BRIEF)  Working  Memory  sub-
scale scores for participants who received the MBSR intervention. L = left; SE = social support/education. 

Both the MBSR and SE groups showed a loss of pre- existing 
FP–insula  anticorrelations,  suggesting  common  social  factors 
rather  than  mindfulness  training  elicited  DMN–salience  net-
work  (SN)  connectivity  alterations.  While  we  predicted  FP 
connectivity would be nonspecific to the intervention group, 
we expected insula connectivity to be specific to MBSR. Thus, 
our  hypothesis  was  partially  supported.  Increases  in  cortical 
thickness  in  the  right  FP  and  in  PFC–insula  connectivity  in-
duced by MBSR have been reported;56 however, to our know-
ledge,  this  study  is  the  first  to  report  FP–insula  connectivity 
changes.  Whether  these  connectivity  changes  are  unique  to 
ASD  is  unclear;  however,  they  may  be  clinically  relevant. 
Cognitive behavioural therapy has been shown to alter PFC–
insula connectivity in patients with depression.57 The negative 
correlation we observed between FP–insula connectivity and 
depression  symptomatology  adds  further  support  to  the  po-
tential clinical significance of DMN–SN interactions.

Our  hypothesis  of  MBSR-specific  alterations  to  SFG  con-
nectivity was not supported. Instead, both the MBSR and SE 
groups  showed  a  transition  from  correlated  to  anticor-
related  SFG  and  FP  activity.  In  line  with  the  nonspecificity 
aspect, CBT and MBSR were compared and both altered lat-
eral  and  medial  PFC  activity  in  patients  with  social  anxi-
ety.58 Previous work has established coactivation of the SFG 
and  mPFC  during  self-reflection  in  ASD,  as  well  as

Figure 7: Brain–behaviour scatterplots for nonspecific intervention connectivity changes (p < 0.05). Associations between (A) insula–frontal 
pole (FP) connectivity and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores across all participants and (B) amygdala–pre/postcentral gyrus (CG)

study,  we  identified  middle  cingulate  connectivity  changes 
with  the  sensorimotor  network  that  were  not  replicated  in 
this larger sample.15 Although we did observe MBSR-specific 
and MBSR-nonspecific changes in the FP, the lack of effects in 
major DMN hubs — namely, the MFC and cingulum — may 
reflect a unique property of mindfulness training or interven-
tions more generally for adults with ASD. For example, aber-
rations  in  within-  and  between-DMN  connectivity  in  ASD55 
may have affected how the interventions were received and 
interacted  with  brain  function.  No  behavioural  intervention 
studies  examining  the  DMN  have  been  published  in  ASD, 
making conjecture difficult.

Our  hypothesis  of  intervention  nonspecific  alterations  to 
amygdala  connectivity  was  supported;  however,  we  antici-
pated  amygdala–PFC  connectivity  changes,  as  reported  in 
the context of emotion regulation.25 Instead, both MBSR and 
SE  showed  amygdala–pre-/postcentral  gyrus  decoupling. 
We  surmise  that  social  engagement  akin  to  both  interven-
tions  over  the  8-week  period  reduced  feelings  of  isolation 
and  loneliness,  an  effect  seen  with  other  socially  oriented 
inter ventions,18 and diminished amygdala input to the sensori-
motor system. Attenuation of amygdala response induced by 
MBSR is often interpreted as top–down inhibition, expressed 
neurobiologically  as  increased  PFC–amygdala  connectivity 
(see  Gotink  and  colleagues25  for  a  review).  While  activation 
studies have found decreased signal in the amygdala and in-
creased  signal  in  sensorimotor  regions,  to  our  knowledge, 
this is the first study to identify connectivity changes in this 
limbic–sensorimotor circuit.

Decreased  connectivity  between  the  amygdala  and  sensori-
motor  system  correlated  with  alleviation  of  depressive  symp-
toms across all participants, offering a shared neural correlate of 
MBSR and SE. Amygdala changes induced by MBSR are sus-
pected  to  be  a  key  factor  in  improved  emotional  regulation,25 
with  amygdala  dysfunction  underlying  psychopathology;59 

pre-/postcentral gyrus connectivity changes have also been re-
ported in adults with ASD following MBSR.15 Our findings sug-
gest that limbic–sensorimotor decoupling may be a nonspecific 
metric  of  depression  reduction  in  adults  with  ASD.  Future 
work should seek to replicate and extend these findings using 
ROI-to-ROI and causal approaches.

Limitations

The  greatest  limitation  to  the  present  analysis  is  the  modest 
sample  size,  which  may  have  been  underpowered  to  detect 
small to medium effects. Nevertheless, this study is the largest 
of  its  kind  in  adults  with  ASD  and  was  powered  to  detect 
 medium  to  large  effects.  Results  yielded  significant  group  × 
time  interactions  and  main  effects  of  time  on  behavioural 
meas ures and seed-to-voxel correlations at ROIs. Another po-
tential limitation is the susceptibility of fMRI analyses to type 1 
errors. To reduce these concerns, we harnessed α inflation by 
using rigorous statistical methods, including FDR and Bonfer-
roni  correction.  We  also  used  a  generalized  psychophysio-
logical interactions approach to elucidate task-specific modula-
tion,  a  method  that,  compared  to  standard  approaches, 
achieves improved model fit, specificity and sensitivity.60

Other limitations pertain to generalizability, including the 
recruitment  of  intellectually  abled  adults,  which  limits  con-
clusions related to children and adolescents, and adults who 
experience intellectual challenges (IQ < 70). To increase gen-
eralizability,  we  enrolled  adults  within  a  wide  age  range 
(age  18–80  yr),  of  all  sex/gender  orientations  and  handed-
ness, regardless of other comorbidities common to ASD (e.g., 
epilepsy,  Tourette  syndrome,  hearing  loss).  Although  we 
did not directly evaluate the influence of IQ, autism severity, 
age  or  sex  on  outcomes,  a  correlation  analysis  found  no  ef-
fect  of  IQ  and  age  within  the  study  sample.  Additionally, 
self-report  measures  are  limited,  and  future  integration  of

objective  cognitive  and  clinical  measures  in  MBSR  studies  of 
adults with ASD are warranted. Future research should seek to 
characterize  the  complex  interplay  of  demographic  factors  on 
clinical outcomes, use clinician and performance-based assess-
ments  to  confirm  and  extend  these  findings,  and  use 
 mediation/moderation analyses to elucidate psychological and 
neural mediators of long-term therapeutic improvements.17

Conclusion

The  current  study  contributes  to  a  growing  endeavour  to 
treat  mental  health  comorbidities  and  identify  therapeutic 
biomarkers  in  ASD  and,  to  our  knowledge,  marks  the  first 
comprehensive investigation into the therapeutic neural cor-
relates  of  MBSR  in  this  population.  We  identified  MBSR- 
specific and intervention-nonspecific effects in behaviour and 
brain  connectivity  patterns.  Superior  therapeutic  outcomes 
were  observed  with  MBSR  than  with  SE  in  the  domains  of 
working  memory  and  mindfulness  abilities.  However,  both 
MBSR  and  SE  led  to  significant  reductions  in  depression, 
anxiety  and  autistic  traits.  These  clinically  meaningful 
changes  suggest  social  support  is  similarly  efficacious  and 
sufficient  to  reduce  psychiatric  symptoms  in  adults  with 
ASD.  Additionally,  this  study  elucidated  mindfulness- 
specific  and  -nonspecific  neural  mechanisms.  Connectivity 
changes driven by MBSR were found in the insula and thala-
mus,  corresponding  with  decreased  trait  anxiety  and  in-
creased  mindfulness;  and  in  anterior–posterior  DMN  axis 
connectivity,  corresponding  with  improved  executive  func-
tioning. Nonspecific connectivity changes were found across 
all  participants  in  SN–DMN  connectivity,  corresponding 
with  reductions  in  depression;  in  lateral–medial  PFC  axis 
connectivity;  and  in  the  limbic–sensorimotor  system,  cor-
responding  with  reductions  in  depression.  Overall,  results 
suggest  overlapping  and  nonoverlapping  neural  substrates 
of  MBSR  and  SE  in  adults  with  ASD.  Novel  connectivity 
 metrics  provide  critical  information  for  the  development  of 
personalized  medicine,  causal  connectivity  analyses  and 
neurostimulation research.
