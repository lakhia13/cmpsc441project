Abstract 
Background:  The perinatal period is a time of increased vulnerability to mental health problems, however, only a 
small proportion of women seek help. Poor mental health literacy (MHL) is a major barrier to seeking help for mental 
health problems. This study aimed to collect the existing evidence of MHL associated with perinatal mental health 
problems (PMHP) among perinatal women and the public. This review analysed which tools were used to assess peri-
natal MHL as well as the findings concerning individual components of perinatal MHL.

Methods:  Four electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CINAHL) were analysed from their 
inception until September 1, 2020. Not only quantitative studies reporting on components of MHL (knowledge, 
attitudes, and help-seeking), but also studies reporting overall levels of MHL relating to PMHP were taken into 
account. Two independent reviewers were involved in the screening and extraction process and data were analysed 
descriptively.

Results:  Thirty-eight of the 13,676 retrieved articles satisfied the inclusion criteria. The majority of selected studies 
examined MHL related to PMHP in perinatal women (N 
=
in the selected data set was help-seeking. A lack of uniformity in assessing MHL components was found. The most 
common focus of these studies was postpartum depression. It was found that the ability to recognize PMHP and 
to identify relevant symptoms was lacking among both perinatal women and the public. Perinatal women had low 
intentions of seeking help for PMHP and preferred seeking help from informal sources while reporting a variety of 
structural and personal barriers to seeking help. Stigmatizing attitudes associated with PMHP were found among the 
public.

Conclusions:  There is a need for educational campaigns and interventions to improve perinatal MHL in perinatal 
women and the public as a whole.

Background
Pregnancy  and  early  motherhood  often  signal  a  time  of 
joy and excitement but also a time of massive change and 
challenges. During this period, women are especially vul-
nerable  to  developing  perinatal  mental  health  problems 
(PMHP) (i.e., mental health problems that manifest dur-
ing pregnancy and up to 1 year after delivery) [1, 2]. The 
most prevalent mental disorders are perinatal depression

and  anxiety  disorders.  Globally,  approximately  17%  of 
women suffer from postpartum depression (PPD), which 
can  be  distinguished  from  temporary  postpartum  blues, 
a milder and shorter form of depressive symptoms [3, 4]. 
Less prevalent are bipolar disorders and postpartum psy-
chosis with postpartum psychosis occurring in 0.1–0.2% 
of  childbearing  women  [5].  All  PMHP  represent  a  pub-
lic  health  concern  due  to  their  impact  on  the  health  of 
mothers and their infants. Negative associations between 
PMHP  and  behavioural  and  cognitive  development  of 
children  up  to  adolescence  highlight  the  importance  of 
adequate  and  timely  treatment  [6,  7].  Often,  however, 
PMHP remain undiagnosed and subsequently untreated. 
In the case of PPD, only 6.3% of women receive adequate 
treatment [8]. Unfortunately, even when perinatal health 
services are available, women in the perinatal period seek 
less help compared to women in other life periods [9, 10]. 
Evidence suggests that one factor influencing help-seek-
ing rates is mental health literacy [11]. As such, poor per-
inatal mental health literacy might play an important role 
in the low healthcare utilization of perinatal women [12].
Mental  health  literacy  (MHL)  was  initially  defined 
as  “[…]  knowledge  and  beliefs  about  mental  disorders 
which aid recognition, management or prevention” [13]. 
A more recent operationalization of the MHL concept by 
Kutcher  et  al.  additionally  includes  the  sub-components 
attitudes and help-seeking [14]. This definition does not 
only  add  the  concept  of  stigma  but  also  the  concept  of 
help-seeking efficacy to the definition of MHL. Low MHL 
has been identified as one of the reasons for the limited 
use  of  mental  health  services  [14].  However,  not  only 
help-seeking efficacy but also help-seeking attitudes have 
been  shown  to  be  predictors  of  help-seeking  intention 
and behaviour. To emphasize the concept of help-seeking 
attitudes  as  suggested  by  Chao  et  al.  [15]  we  expanded 
the  concept  of  MHL  beyond  the  definition  of  Kutcher 
et al. to capture a wide range of help-seeking factors (e.g., 
intentions, barriers) for the purpose of this review.

The aim of this review was to summarize research on a 
broad range of perinatal MHL components in both peri-
natal women and the public. Inaccurate notions of men-
tal health in perinatal women can impede early detection 
and  treatment  of  their  mental  health  problems.  There-
fore,  perinatal  MHL  is  an  important  factor  influencing 
the  recognition,  diagnosis,  and  treatment  of  PMHP.  For 
instance, Dennis & Lee [16], who summarized qualitative 
studies on postpartum depression help-seeking barriers, 
found  lack  of  knowledge  and  the  acceptance  of  myths 
to  be  important  help-seeking  barriers  impeding  moth-
ers  to  recognize  the  emergence  of  depression.  Moreo-
ver, help-seeking was shown to be influenced by stigma, 
shame,  and  the  fear  of  being  labelled  mentally  ill  [16]. 
However, not only the view of perinatal women but also 

the public’s view regarding mental health problems in the 
perinatal period is an important factor to understand the 
decision-making, help-seeking, and healthcare utilization 
of  women  in  the  perinatal  period  [17].  To  deliver  effec-
tive  MHL  interventions  it  is  important  to  consider  the 
context  that  influences  the  impact  of  the  interventions, 
including  the  public’s  view  on  PMHP.  Several  studies 
suggest that the general population has poor knowledge 
about  PPD  [18,  19],  which  could  potentially  discourage 
women from seeking professional help.

According  to  Kutcher  et  al.  [14],  effective  MHL  inter-
ventions  should  improve  the  knowledge  and  help-seek-
ing  aspect  of  MHL  and  reduce  stigma.  As  most  studies 
that  examined  perinatal  MHL  in  perinatal  women  and 
the  public  focused  on  individual  aspects  of  MHL  (e.g., 
knowledge  component)  [17,  20],  the  rationale  for  con-
ducting  this  review  was  to  synthesize  findings  on  all 
aspects  of  perinatal  MHL  (knowledge,  attitudes,  and 
help-seeking).  Identifying  the  components  of  MHL  that 
are  especially  prone  to  impede  help-seeking  for  PMHP 
could inform MHL campaigns and interventions. There-
fore,  it  is  important  to  conduct  research  on  all  compo-
nents of MHL regarding PMHP in perinatal women and 
the public.

We summarized research on perinatal MHL expanding 
the  concepts  of  Jorm  et  al.  [13]  and  Kutcher  et  al.  [14]. 
Our purpose was (1) to identify tools to measure PMHL 
components and (2) to summarize the existing evidence 
on  MHL  among  perinatal  women  and  the  public  with  a 
focus  on  MHL  components  knowledge,  attitudes,  and 
help-seeking.

Methods
This  review  followed  the  PRISMA  reporting  stand-
ards  [21].  The  PRISMA  checklist  is  available  in  Addi-
tional file 1. The protocol is available at https:// www. crd. 
york. ac. uk/ prosp  ero/ displ  ay_ record. php? ID=  CRD42 
02020 8450.  We  used  the  PEO  (Population,  Exposure, 
Outcomes) framework to specify our research questions. 
P:  perinatal  women  or  the  public.  E:  PMHP  (e.g.,  post-
partum  depression,  prenatal  depression)  O:  MHL  com-
ponents:  knowledge,  attitudes,  help-seeking,  and  overall 
levels of MHL.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Published  studies  in  German  or  English  were  eligi-
ble  for  inclusion.  Databases  were  searched  from  their 
year  of  inception  until  September  1,  2020,  without  geo-
graphic  restriction.  We  included  all  studies  assessing 
MHL of PMHP among perinatal women and the public. 
We  excluded  studies  investigating  concepts  (knowledge, 
attitudes,  help-seeking)  among  professionals  (e.g.,  mid-
wives,  general  practitioners).  Only  outcomes  related  to

maternal  -  not  paternal  -  mental  health  in  the  perinatal 
period  were  included.  We  included  quantitative  studies 
(e.g., cross-sectional studies, prospective cohort studies). 
For studies other than cross-sectional studies, only base-
line  results  were  included.  Qualitative  studies,  reviews, 
and  meta-analyses  were  excluded.  If  qualitative  studies 
used  open-end  questions  and  presented  their  results  in 
a  quantitative  manner  (e.g.,  percentages),  studies  were 
included.

Search strategy for identification of studies

On  September  1,  2020,  the  databases  PubMed,  Psy-
cINFO,  Web  of  Science,  and  CINAHL  were  systemati-
cally searched. We performed a Boolean search using the 
concepts  (1)  MHL,  (2)  perinatal  period,  and  (3)  mental 
illness. We used the following keywords: (“Mental health 
literacy” OR “Health literacy” OR literacy OR knowledge 
OR  attitude*  OR  belief*  OR  stigma*  OR  “help-seek*”) 
AND  (prenatal  OR  antenatal  OR  pregnancy  OR  “before 
birth”  OR  postnatal  OR  postpartum  OR  “after  birth” 
OR  peripartum  OR  perinatal)  AND  (“mental  health” 
OR  “mental  illness”  OR  “mental  disorder”  OR  “psychi-
atric  disorder”  OR  depression  OR  anxiety  OR  “baby 
blues”  OR  psychosis  OR  “bipolar  disorder”)  to  search 
titles,  abstracts,  keywords  and  MeSh  terms  (see  Addi-
tional  file  2).  Additional  studies  were  identified  through 
a  manual  search  of  the  bibliographic  references  of  the 
included full texts.

Study selection and critical appraisal

We  imported  all  identified  references  to  the  litera-
ture  database  EndNote  and  removed  duplicate  records 
of  the  same  reports.  Two  reviewers  independently 
screened  titles  and  abstracts  and  subsequently  screened 
all  retrieved  full  texts  for  inclusion  and  exclusion  crite-
ria.  The  methodological  quality  of  the  included  studies 
was  independently  assessed  by  both  researchers  using 
the following tools: (1) Included Randomized controlled 
trials  (RCTs)  were  assessed  by  the  Cochrane  Collabora-
tion’s  Tool  for  RCTs  [22];  (2)  Cross-sectional  studies 
were  assessed  by  the  Newcastle-Ottawa  Scale  (NOS) 
[23];  (3)  Non-randomized  studies  (all  cohort  studies, 
case-control  studies)  were  assessed  by  the  Qualitative 
Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies (QATSQ) [24] 
(see  Additional  file  3).  Any  disagreements  between  the 
two  researchers  were  resolved  through  discussion  and 
consensus.

Data extraction and synthesis

Two  researchers  extracted  the  data  according  to  a 
developed  data  extraction  form.  To  extract  numeri-
cal  data  from  plots,  we  used  WebPlotDigitizer  [25]. The 
extracted data included study information (e.g., authors, 

publication year); study characteristics (e.g., study design, 
sampling  method);  participant  characteristics  (e.g.,  sex, 
age)  and  outcomes:  (1)  tools  to  measure  perinatal  MHL 
components and (2) perinatal MHL components and lev-
els  of  perinatal  MHL.  The  extracted  MHL  components 
extended the definitions of MHL by Jorm et al. [13] and 
Kutcher et al. [14] and included: (a) knowledge of PMHP 
(recognition,  symptoms,  causes,  first  aid,  intervention, 
and  preventive  measures),  (b)  attitudes  towards  PMHP 
(stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs), (c) help-seeking atti-
tudes  (preferred  treatment,  preferred  source  of  help, 
barriers and facilitators) & intentions. Data were descrip-
tively analysed.

Results
Of  the  13,608  references  retrieved  from  the  databases 
and  the  68  references  retrieved  from  the  reference  sec-
tions  of  included  studies,  we  identified  78  full  texts  of 
potentially  eligible  articles.  After  full-text  screening  and 
critical  appraisal,  38  eligible  studies  remained  and  were 
included (see Fig.1).

Characteristics of studies

Study characteristics and components of perinatal MHL 
are shown in Table 1.

The  majority  of  studies  were  cross-sectional  studies 
using  convenience  sampling.  Participants  in  28  studies 
(73.7%)  were  women  in  the  perinatal  period  who  were 
either  pregnant  or  had  recently  given  birth.  Seven  of 
these  studies  only  included  women  at  risk  of  perinatal 
depression, women who had or were currently experienc-
ing  PPD,  or  women  with  symptoms  of  distress.  Next  to 
the  tools  used  to  measure  PMHL,  results  are  presented 
within the main categories of MHL: knowledge, attitudes, 
and help-seeking. Results on overall levels of PMHL can 
be found in Additional file 4.

Tools to measure perinatal MHL components

The  most  commonly  used  tools  to  measure  the  knowl-
edge  component  of  perinatal  MHL  were  vignette-based 
measures  (23.1%),  measures  drawn  from  the  Australian 
Perinatal  Depression  Monitor  [18],  and  study-specific 
measures  (e.g.,  semi-structured  interviews,  true/false 
questions).  Attitudes  and  beliefs  towards  PMHP  were 
most  commonly  examined  by  the  Attitudes  about  Post-
partum  Depression  Questionnaire  [30]  and  the  Stigma 
subscale of the Portuguese version of the Inventory of Atti-
tudes Toward Seeking Mental Health Services [61]. Help-
seeking  attitudes  (preferred  treatment,  preferred  source 
of  help,  barriers,  and  facilitators)  were  most  commonly 
assessed by showing participants a list of items and ask-
ing  them  to  select  all  that  applied.  Help-seeking  inten-
tions were most commonly captured by single questions

(e.g.,  ‘would  you  seek  help  if  you  had  symptoms  of  post-
natal  depression  or  anxiety?’).  See  Additional  file  5  for 
details.

Knowledge of PMHP

Results  on  the  knowledge  component  of  perinatal  MHL 
are presented in Table 2.

Recognition

The ability to recognize PMHP was reported in six stud-
ies.  One  study  conducted  in  an  Australian  community 
sample  reported  that  the  majority  of  participants  were 
able to recognize PPD, whereas two studies among peri-
natal  women  reported  that  the  majority  of  participants 
were  unable  to  recognize  PPD  in  case  vignettes.  Three 
other  studies  among  the  public  assessed  recognition  of 
PMHP  by  the  percentage  of  spontaneous  responses  to 
the question ‘what do you consider to be the major health 
problems which may be experienced during pregnancy/in 
the first year?’ [18, 55] and the question ‘have you heard 
about  PPD?’  [30].  Depression  was  the  most  commonly 

cited potential health problem of women in the postpar-
tum period [18, 55].

Symptoms

All  studies  that  assessed  knowledge  about  symptoms  of 
PMHP included participants from the public as a whole. 
Only a small number of participants correctly identified 
typical  symptoms  of  PPD  (30.2–62.2%).  The  percent-
age  of  women  reporting  difficulties  in  the  mother-child 
relationship  (e.g.,  lack  of  bonding,  harm  to  the  baby)  as 
a  symptom  of  PPD  varied  heavily  between  5  and  77.1%. 
Concerning  the  baby  blues,  in  one  study,  approximately 
30%  of  participants  correctly  stated  that  the  baby  blues 
would  not  extend  longer  than  2  weeks  [19].  In  another 
study,  symptoms  of  postnatal  anxiety  were  correctly 
identified by less than 20%. More than 40% of those sur-
veyed were not able to name one symptom [55].

Causes

Hormonal/biological  changes  were  a  frequently  cited 
cause  of  PPD  and  perinatal  depression  among  perinatal

women and the public. Among the public, hormonal/bio-
logical  changes  were  the  most  commonly  cited  cause  of 
PPD. Unpreparedness for or not coping with parenthood 
was  another  frequently  mentioned  cause  of  PPD  among 
the public [18, 55, 56]. Lack of social support was another 
perceived cause of PPD and perinatal depression among 
perinatal  women  and  the  public,  with  values  ranging 
from 8.5 to 75%. However, in contrast to the public, lack 
of social support was the most frequently reported cause 
of PPD and perinatal depression among perinatal women. 
Other perceived causes of PPD and perinatal depression 
included:  lack  of  sleep  and  exhaustion,  depression  and 
anxiety during pregnancy, stress, and genetic tendencies.

Interventions

Regarding  PPD,  the  public  most  often  considered  pro-
fessional  help  (e.g.,  counselling,  psychotherapy)  to  be  a 
helpful  treatment.  Partner/family  support,  on  the  other 
hand,  was  considered  to  be  helpful  by  a  small  propor-
tion  of  participants  from  the  public.  In  contrast,  in  one 
study, a large number (93%) of perinatal women reported 
that  partner  support  was  helpful  for  PPD.  Less  than 
30%  of  participants  from  the  general  public  considered 

antidepressants  to  be  an  appropriate  intervention  [18, 
55]. Among perinatal women, antidepressants were cited 
as an appropriate intervention for treating PPD by 54% of 
participants [32]. The same study also indicated that 78% 
of participants considered vitamins and minerals helpful 
for treating PPD. Regarding prenatal depression, partner 
assistance  was  considered  helpful  by  almost  all  partici-
pants in one study (96%), followed by vitamins and min-
erals (86%) [32].

Stigmatising attitudes and beliefs regarding PMHP

Results on the stigmatising attitudes and beliefs compo-
nent of perinatal MHL are presented in Table 3.

The  most  commonly  reported  aspects  of  negative  or 
trivializing beliefs reported among the public were: ‘it is 
normal to have PPD’ and that ‘women know by nature how 
to  look  after  a  baby’.  Two  studies  indicated  that  partici-
pants most often agreed with the attitude ‘it is normal to 
be depressed during pregnancy’ [18, 55]. Similarly, half of 
an Australian community sample viewed being depressed 
during pregnancy as ‘a normal part of having a baby’ [18]. 
In a third study, 11.4% of the participants agreed with the 
statement ‘women with postpartum depression cannot be

good mothers’ and 12.1% agreed with ‘women have post-
partum depression because they have unrealistic expecta-
tions about caring for a baby’. Furthermore, 11.6% of the 
participants  disagreed  with  the  statement  ‘postpartum 
depression is not a sign of weakness’ [30].

Help-seeking for PMHP
The  large  majority  of  studies  (N = 34)  reported  at  least 
one  aspect  of  help-seeking  for  PMHP.  Results  are  pre-
sented in Tables 4 and 5.

Although in some studies, a high proportion of women 
reported a need for treatment or were interested in pro-
fessional  health  services  during  the  perinatal  period, 
the percentage of women who intended to seek help for 
PMHP  was  generally  below  40%.  However,  in  one  study 
approximately  three-quarters  of  women  stated  that  they 
would  seek  professional  help  if  they  experienced  symp-
toms of perinatal depression and anxiety [52].

Preferred source of help

Whereas perinatal women preferred informal sources of 
help  such  as  family  or  friends  in  most  studies,  the  pub-
lic  commonly  preferred  formal  sources  of  help  such  as 
GPs. Although women preferred informal sources of help 
from  family  and  friends,  men  would  rather  recommend 
formal  sources  of  help  [18,  55].  The  most  commonly 
preferred formal source of help was medical health pro-
fessionals  (e.g.,  GPs),  followed  by  mental  health  profes-
sionals.  In  one  study,  gynaecologists  and  psychiatrists 
were  both  equally  preferred  [59].  The  remaining  studies 
did not clearly differentiate between medical profession-
als and mental health professionals [28, 39].

Preferred treatment

The  most  frequently  reported  preferred  treatment  type 
among  perinatal  women  and  the  public  was  counsel-
ling/therapy.  Treatment  preferences  differed  between 
pregnant,  breastfeeding,  and  non-breastfeeding  women 
[52].  Pregnant  women  preferred  individual  counselling, 
breastfeeding  women  meditation,  yoga  or  exercise  and 
non-breastfeeding  women  preferred  combined  counsel-
ling  and  medication.  In  one  study,  the  most  commonly 
preferred treatment type (83.6%) was ‘Wait and get over 
it naturally’ [53].

Help-seeking barriers and facilitators

Twenty  studies  assessed  barriers  and/or  facilitators  to 
help-seeking  for  PMHP  in  perinatal  women  and  one 
among parents [58].

Barriers

Structural,  attitudinal,  and  knowledge-related  bar-
riers  were  reported  (see  Table  5).  Among  structural 
barriers, two main categories emerged. (1) cost of treat-
ment  and  (2)  inability  to  attend  appointments  due  to: 
time  constraints, 
logistics/transportation,  childcare, 
distance/geographic  mismatch,  and  unavailability  of 
providers/resources.  The  most  commonly  reported 
attitudinal  barriers  were  associated  with  stigma  and 
shame.  Approximately  50%  of  women  reported  that 
fear,  shame,  and  embarrassment  of  their  feelings  pre-
vented  them  from  seeking  help  [28].  Moreover,  shame 
proneness  predicted  negative  attitudes  towards  help-
seeking  [34].  The  anticipated  opinion  of  other  people 
(e.g.,  ‘I  didn’t  think  others  would  understand’  or  ‘being 
afraid  of  what  my  family  and/or  friends  might  think  of 
me’)  and  the  attitude  towards  help-seeking  (‘wanting 
to  manage  symptoms  on  their  own’)  were  other  barri-
ers  frequently  mentioned  by  women.  The  knowledge 
barriers  most  frequently  mentioned  were  not  knowing 
where  to  seek  help/who  to  contact  and  not  knowing 
what the best treatment option might be.

Facilitators

The  majority  of  studies  assessed  facilitators  that  pre-
dicted help-seeking intentions or behaviour. Social sup-
port  was  the  facilitator  most  commonly  reported.  Six 
studies  determined  high  support  and  encouragement 
by  family/partners  as  a  facilitator  to  help-seeking  or 
symptom disclosure; however, one study found that less 
social support increased treatment uptake [52]. Severity 
of illness was another frequently mentioned facilitator. 
Although  higher  symptom  severity  facilitated  help-
seeking  in  most  studies,  one  study  found  that  women 
with  more  severe  depressive  symptoms  reported  more 
barriers to help-seeking [33]. Five studies found that the 
relationship to and confidence in mental health profes-
sionals  facilitated  help-seeking.  For  instance,  in  three 
studies encouragement by healthcare professionals was 
found to be a help-seeking facilitator. Past experiences 
of  mental  illness  or  treatment  was  another  commonly 
expressed facilitator to help-seeking in five studies. For 
instance,  women  sought  professional  assistance  more 
frequently if they had a history of mental health prob-
lems and treatment [35]. The attitude towards diagnosis 
and treatment was another facilitator. For instance, the 
perceived  need  for  treatment  was  found  to  be  a  help-
seeking facilitator [27, 43]. Moreover, two other studies 
found  that  ‘the  belief  that  symptoms  would  last  a  long 
time’  predicted  help-seeking  behaviour  [49]  and  that 
more  positive  attitudes  towards  seeking  professional

psychological  help  increased  intentions  to  seek  help 
[45].

Discussion
The purpose of this study was (1) to identify tools used to 
measure perinatal MHL components and (2) to summa-
rize the existing evidence on perinatal MHL with a spe-
cial focus on knowledge, attitudes, and help-seeking. This 
review identified several aspects of perinatal MHL, which 
should be targeted in interventions and campaigns.

A  large  heterogeneity  of  assessment  of  MHL  compo-
nents and sub-components was found; therefore, making 
it difficult to compare results. For instance, some studies 
reported percentages of correct responses, whereas oth-
ers  reported  the  endorsement  of  participants  with  spe-
cific statements. Several studies did not provide evidence 
for  the  psychometric  validity  of  measures  or  developed 
their  own  study  measures.  Recognition  of  symptoms, 
for instance, was assessed in several different ways, with 
only  half  of  the  studies  using  case  vignettes,  which  is  in 
line with the operationalization of recognition of mental 
disorder as the ability to identify and name a mental dis-
order  based  on  a  written  case  vignette  [67].  Our  results 
are  in  accordance  with  the  research  of  Singh  et  al.  who 
found a lack of uniformity in assessing MHL components 
among  adolescents  [68].  In  the  case  of  symptom  recog-
nition,  future  research  should  use  a  standardized  set  of 
vignettes. Likewise, instead of using study-specific lists of 
statements to assess treatment barriers for PMHP, stand-
ardized  measures  such  as  the  Perceived  Barriers  to  Psy-
chological Treatment (PBPT) scale could be adapted and 
used in future research [69]. Regarding levels of perinatal 
MHL,  a  tool  to  measure  postpartum  depression  literacy 
(The postpartum depression literacy scale, PoDLiS) within 
the mental health literacy framework has been developed 
recently  [47].  Future  research  should  employ  valid  and 
reliable  measures  to  assess  all  components  of  perinatal 
MHL literacy.

Less  heterogeneity  was  found  with  regard  to  the  spe-
cific  PMHP  studied.  Almost  all  studies  focused  on  peri-
natal  MHL  in  relation  to  perinatal  depression  or  PPD 
specifically.  However,  incidences  of  other  PMHP  such 
as perinatal anxiety are high and merit clinical attention 
similar to that given to perinatal depression [70]. Future 
research assessing MHL in the context of other PMHP is 
warranted.

Findings  on  the  knowledge  component  of  perina-
tal  MHL  suggest  that  women  and  the  public  have  a 
partly  fragmented  and  differing  understanding  of 
PMHP.  Although  misconceptions  relating  to  symp-
toms,  causes,  and  treatment  options  for  PMHP  were 
found  in  both,  perinatal  women  and  the  public,  a  few 

differences were observed. Perinatal women most com-
monly  considered  lack  of  social  support  as  a  cause  for 
PMHP; however, the public most commonly attributed 
postnatal depression to biological factors. Importantly, 
biological  factors  are  not  among  the  most  important 
risk factors as identified by research: antenatal depres-
sion  and  anxiety,  major  life  events,  lack  of  (partner) 
support,  and  depression  history  [71–74]. This  miscon-
ception  and  possible  confusion  of  PPD  with  the  baby 
blues  may  explain  why  some  stereotypes  such  as  ‘it  is 
normal  to  have  PPD’  exist  among  the  public.  Public 
educational  campaigns  highlighting  the  significance  of 
PMHP  could  counteract  misconceptions  and  trivializ-
ing  notions. This  seems  especially  important  consider-
ing that higher public knowledge of PMHP is associated 
with higher intention to recommend help-seeking [31] 
and  might  therefore  influence  help-seeking  behaviour 
of  perinatal  women.  Perinatal  women  most  commonly 
reported  social  support  as  a  helpful  intervention  and 
preferred informal sources of treatment. This is discon-
certing because PMHP often require professional treat-
ment [75]. Therefore, it is important to educate women 
that  –although  social  factors  are  among  the  causes  of 
PMHP– informal sources of help (such as support from 
the  partner)  may  not  be  sufficient  to  effectively  treat 
PMHP.  It  is  important  to  highlight  the  importance  of 
professional help and to reduce the barriers associated 
with formal help-seeking.

Consistent with previous research, stigma and shame 
were  the  most  prevalent  barriers  to  help-seeking  in 
perinatal  women  [16].  By  discussing  PMHP  with  peri-
natal  women,  providers  (e.g.,  gynaecologists,  mid-
wives, and obstetricians) could improve knowledge and 
reduce stigma and shame. Innovative treatment options 
such  as  internet-based  interventions  could  be  used  to 
circumvent both structural and stigma-related barriers. 
For  instance,  internet-based  interventions  including 
information  and  cognitive  behavioural  strategies  were 
shown to influence levels of depression stigma and atti-
tudes towards PPD [63, 76, 77].

Our finding that social facilitators (such as social sup-
port  and  encouragement,  relationships  with  provid-
ers,  and  attitudes  towards  mental  illness)  are  the  most 
commonly reported reasons to seek help has also been 
reported  elsewhere  [78].  To  strengthen  social  support, 
interventions  should  be  developed  that  provide  strat-
egies  for  reinforcing  and  mobilizing  women’s  social 
networks  in  the  perinatal  period;  e.g.  by  developing  a 
post-birth  support  plan  [51].  This  seems  particularly 
important  as  the  social  network  often  tends  to  rec-
ommend  formal  rather  than  informal  treatment  and 
therefore  may  serve  as  an  important  gateway  for  the 
transition from informal to formal treatment.

Practical implications

There  is  a  need  for  campaigns  and  interventions  to 
raise perinatal MHL among both, perinatal women and 
the public.

First, perinatal women and the public should be edu-
cated  about  the  symptoms,  risk  factors,  and  treatment 
options of PMHP to increase problem recognition and 
service  selection.  Common  misconceptions  –  such  as 
the  high  attribution  of  PPD  to  biological  factors  and 
the  underestimation  of  psychosocial  causes  –  should 
be  addressed.  Given  the  important  role  of  partners  in 
encouraging women to seek help, it seems essential that 
the social network of women can recognize PMHP and 
understands the important role of support and encour-
agement as a facilitator to perinatal help-seeking. Con-
sistent with the recommendations of Poreddi et al. [79], 
this  review  highlights  the  importance  of  educational 
campaigns,  which  aim  to  improve  perinatal  MHL  by 
addressing  prejudices  and  negative  stereotypes  associ-
ated with PPD [79]. Importantly, campaigns and inter-
ventions should not solely focus on PPD, but also raise 
awareness about less understood PMHP such as prena-
tal depression and perinatal anxiety.

Additionally,  perinatal  women  should  receive  infor-
mation on relevant providers and treatment options to 
decrease  knowledge  barriers  to  help-seeking  and  sub-
sequently facilitate service selection. Ideally, healthcare 
providers who work directly with pregnant women and 
new  parents  (such  as  midwives,  gynaecologists,  pae-
diatricians,  and  GPs)  should  discuss  PMHP,  screen  for 
PMHP, discuss treatment options, and refer patients for 
treatment.  However,  medical  professionals  often  lack 
resources or knowledge to address PMHP [80]. In addi-
tion to raising the awareness of health care profession-
als with the goal of increasing provider MHL and thus 
screening  rates  [81],  more  comprehensive  approaches 
are  needed.  Given  that  the  smartphone  is  the  most 
commonly  used  device  with  internet  access  among 
perinatal  women  [82],  developing  and  evaluating  evi-
dence-based  content  for  smartphone  use  could  be  one 
approach  to  improve  perinatal  MHL  among  women 
and the public. Such an approach is currently evaluated 
(www. smart- moms. de).

Second,  campaigns  and  interventions  should  focus 
on  stigmatizing  attitudes.  Stigma  and  shame  are  not 
only  a  substantial  barrier  to  help-seeking  for  PMHP 
[16], but also influence the public’s intention of recom-
mending  professional  help  for  PMHP  [31].  Given  that 
social  support  and  partner  encouragement  are  impor-
tant  help-seeking  facilitators,  campaigns  and  inter-
ventions  addressing  stigmatizing  attitudes  towards 
PMHP among the public have the potential to increase 
the  essential  support  from  the  social  network  and 

subsequently  increase  help-seeking  rates  among  peri-
natal women.

Strengths and limitations

To  our  knowledge,  this  study  was  the  first  systematic 
review to summarize findings on perinatal MHL. Moreo-
ver, this review incorporated several aspects of perinatal 
MHL and expanded the concept by Kutcher et al. [14] to 
capture a wide range of help-seeking factors (e.g., inten-
tions,  barriers).  The  quality  of  studies  was  appraised  by 
using different tools recommended for use in systematic 
reviews. A limitation that should be mentioned is that we 
limited our search to studies in English and German and 
did not include any source of Grey literature. Therefore, 
this review might be subject to publication bias. Moreo-
ver,  due  to  the  substantial  number  of  outcomes  related 
to  perinatal  MHL  and  the  heterogeneity  of  tools  used 
in  the  studies,  findings  should  be  interpreted  with  cau-
tion. It should be noted that most of the included studies 
were  conducted  in  Western  countries.  Since  the  experi-
ence  of  shame  and  stigma  is  often  culturally  or  socially 
determined [83, 84], our results may not be generalizable 
to non-Western cultures. As PMHP also affect men [85], 
future  research  on  MHL  in  relation  to  paternal  PMHP, 
and  any  interactions  or  associations  between  maternal 
and  paternal  PMHP,  is  warranted.  Additionally,  future 
reviews  with  a  focus  on  qualitative  studies  would  be 
highly valuable to shed more light on the individual expe-
riences of perinatal women and the public as a whole.

Conclusions
In  summary,  a  multidisciplinary  approach  that  sup-
ports  perinatal  health  care  professionals  in  their  role  as 
gatekeepers  to  perinatal  mental  help  treatment  and  also 
increases the accessibility of sensitive information about 
PMHP  for  perinatal  women  and  the  public  is  needed. 
Future research should investigate the effects of perinatal 
MHL  campaigns  and  interventions  on  actual  help-seek-
ing behaviour.
