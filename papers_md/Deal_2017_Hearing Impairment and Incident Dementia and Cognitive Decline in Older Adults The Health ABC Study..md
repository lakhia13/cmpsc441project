Abstract

Background:  Age-related peripheral hearing impairment (HI) is prevalent, treatable, and may be a risk factor for dementia in older adults. 
In prospective analysis, we quantified the association of HI with incident dementia and with domain-specific cognitive decline in memory, 
perceptual speed, and processing speed.
Methods:  Data were from the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) study, a biracial cohort of well-functioning adults aged 
70–79 years. Dementia was defined using a prespecified algorithm incorporating medication use, hospital records, and neurocognitive test 
scores. A pure-tone average in decibels hearing level (dBHL) was calculated in the better hearing ear using thresholds from 0.5 to 4 kHz, and 
HI was defined as normal hearing (≤25 dBHL), mild (26–40 dBHL), and moderate/severe (>40 dBHL). Associations between HI and incident 
dementia and between HI and cognitive change were modeled using Cox proportional hazards models and linear mixed models, respectively.
Results:  Three-hundred  eighty  seven  (20%)  participants  had  moderate/severe  HI,  and  716  (38%)  had  mild  HI.  After  adjustment  for 
demographic and cardiovascular factors, moderate/severe audiometric HI (vs. normal hearing) was associated with increased risk of incident 
dementia  over  9  years  (hazard  ratio:  1.55,  95%  confidence  interval  [CI]:  1.10,  2.19).  Other  than  poorer  baseline  memory  performance 
(difference of −0.24 SDs, 95% CI: −0.44, −0.04), no associations were observed between HI and rates of domain-specific cognitive change 
during 7 years of follow-up.
Conclusions:  HI is associated with increased risk of developing dementia in older adults. Randomized trials are needed to determine whether 
treatment of hearing loss could postpone dementia onset in older adults.

Age-related peripheral hearing impairment (HI) may be a risk factor 
for incident dementia in older adults. A small number of epidemio-
logic studies support this hypothesis (1–3); however, limitations of 

these studies include reliance on self-reported hearing loss (vs. objec-
tively  measured  hearing  using  audiometry)  (3)  or  lack  of  adjust-
ment  for  cardiovascular  factors  (2).  HI  may  also  be  a  risk  factor

for cognitive impairment (4,5) and accelerated cognitive decline over 
time (6,7), although some studies have shown no association (8), and 
the specificity of this association with different cognitive domains is 
unknown. Proposed biological mechanisms suggest that the relation-
ship between HI and cognition may be causal (9). Because HI is both 
highly  prevalent  (10)  and  treatable,  the  question  of  whether  HI  is 
a risk factor for dementia has major public health implications for 
the  possible  design  of  interventions  to  postpone  dementia  in  older 
adults.

A  previous  study  in  the  Health, Aging  and  Body  Composition 
(Health ABC) study, a biracial cohort of well-functioning adults aged 
70–79 years, reported associations between HI and faster decline in 
global  cognition  and  in  executive  function  over  6  years  (7).  Here 
we expand upon that work to test the hypothesis that participants 
with HI have increased risk of incident dementia over 9 years com-
pared  with  participants  having  normal  hearing,  independent  of 
cardiovascular disease and other risk factors. Additionally, in com-
plementary analysis, we used data from the Health ABC Cognitive 
Vitality Substudy (CVS) to test that HI is associated with faster rates 
of  7-year  cognitive  decline  in  three  domains:  memory,  perceptual 
speed, and processing speed.

Methods

Study Population
Health ABC is a prospective cohort study of 3,075 community-dwell-
ing  black  (42%)  and  white  (58%)  older  adults  aged  70–79  years 
in 1997–1998 randomly sampled from Medicare enrollees living in 
Memphis, Tennessee or Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Eligibility criteria 
included no self-reported mobility difficulty (walking a quarter mile 
and climbing 10 steps without resting) or disability (difficulty per-
forming activities of daily living), no known life-threatening cancers, 
and no plans to leave the area within 3 years (11).

All  Health  ABC  participants  signed  written  informed  consent, 
and  the  study  was  approved  by  the  institutional  review  boards  of 
both study sites.

HI and dementia: Analytic population
In total, 2,034 participants were dementia-free in 1997–1998 (Year 
1,  dementia  definition  published  previously  (12))  and  also  under-
went  audiometric  testing  in  2001–2002  (Year  5).  Of  these  partici-
pants,  145  were  missing  covariate  data,  yielding  a  final  analytic 
sample of 1,889. Compared with participants included in the analy-
sis,  excluded  participants  were  older  (74.5  vs.  73.9  years),  scored 
lower  on  the  Modified  Mini-Mental  State  (3MS)  exam  at  Year  1 
(85.8 vs. 92.7 points) and were more likely to be black (55.3% vs. 
33.1%) and to report current smoking (14.6% vs. 7.7%).

HI and cognitive decline: Analytic population
The  CVS  is  a  subcohort  of  929  participants  aged  72–81  years  in 
1999–2000  (Year  3).  By  design,  half  of  the  CVS  participants  were 
exceptionally  well  functioning  (in  the  sex-,  race-  and  site-specific 
85th percentile of the fastest times on the Long Distance Corridor 
Walk  (11)  in  Year  2)  and  half  were  a  random  sample  of  remain-
ing participants. Compared with all Health ABC participants, CVS 
participants were more likely to be women (54% vs. 50%), of white 
race (65% vs. 55%), and have less education (30% with <12 years 
vs. 23%) (13). In all, 789 CVS participants completed neuropsycho-
logical testing at Year 3 (1999–2000) and at up to three additional 
visits during 7 years of follow-up (1999–2006) and also underwent 

hearing testing in Year 5. Participants with dementia (n = 55) and 
with missing covariate data (n = 13) were excluded, yielding a final 
analytic  sample  of  721.  Relative  to  all  CVS  participants,  partici-
pants excluded from analyses were older, more likely to be from the 
Memphis study site and have lower baseline 3MS (14) scores.

Dementia
Consistent with previous work in HealthABC (12), incident demen-
tia was defined as the use of a prescribed dementia medication (gal-
antamine, rivastigmine, memantine, donepezil, or tacrine), dementia 
diagnosis from adjudicated hospital records, or a race-stratified 3MS 
decline more than 1.5 SDs from the baseline mean. Dementia medi-
cations  and  hospital  records  were  assessed  annually  and  the  3MS 
measured in Years 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 11.

CVS Neurocognitive Assessments
The Buschke Selective Reminding Test (SRT) (15) tests verbal mem-
ory; an examiner presents in writing and reads aloud a list of 12 unre-
lated words. Words not recalled are repeated at the start of the next 
trial, for a total of six trials. The Boxes Test (16) and Digit Copying 
Test (16) are tests of psychomotor speed in which participants com-
plete as many boxes or copy as many digits as possible in 30 seconds. 
The  Pattern  Comparison  Test  (PCT)  (16)  and  Letter  Comparison 
Test (LCT) (16) are 30-second tests of attention and speed in which 
participants identify whether a pair of patterns of lines (PCT) or two 
strings of letters (LCT) is the “same” or “different.”.

To facilitate comparisons of decline across tests, tests were stand-
ardized  to  z-scores.  Three  a  priori  domain-specific  z-scores  were 
created by averaging test-specific z-scores: verbal memory (Buschke 
SRT total score), psychomotor speed (Boxes Test and Digit Copying 
Test), and perceptual speed (PCT and LCT).

Hearing Assessment
Pure-tone air conduction audiometry was conducted in 2001–2002 
(Year 5). Air conduction thresholds in each ear were obtained with 
a  portable  audiometer  (Maico  MA40)  and  supra-aural  earphones 
(TDH  39).  Testing  was  completed  in  a  sound-attenuating  booth 
meeting ANSI standards, and thresholds were measured in decibels 
hearing level (dBHL). A pure-tone average (PTA) in the better hear-
ing ear was calculated using thresholds for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz (17). 
For analysis, we categorized PTA using clinically defined cut points 
(normal  hearing:  ≤25  dBHL,  mild:  26–40  dBHL,  and  moderate/
severe: >40 dBHL). In secondary analyses, PTA was scaled to 10 dB 
and modeled continuously.

Hearing aid use was self-reported at Year 5.

Other Independent Variables
Demographic  information  including  age  (years),  race  (white  or 
black),  sex,  and  education  (less  than  high  school,  high  school,  or 
postsecondary) was collected in 1997–1998. Self-reported smoking 
status  (never,  former,  or  current)  was  collected  at  each  study  visit. 
Hypertension was considered present if prevalent at Year 1 (systolic 
blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg, 
or  by  participant  self-report  of  a  diagnosis  by  a  physician  with  or 
without  antihypertensive  medication  use).  Physician-diagnosed 
hypertension (reported by the participant) was used to update hyper-
tension status at each subsequent visit. Diabetes was considered pre-
sent if prevalent at Year 1, defined as physician-diagnosed diabetes 
(reported  by  the  participant),  use  of  diabetes  drug,  or  fasting  glu-
cose  ≥126 mg/dL.  Physician  diagnosis  of  diabetes  (reported  by  the

participant) was used to update diabetes status at each subsequent 
visit. History of stroke was assessed in Years 2–14 by the question, 
“Since we last spoke to you about 6 months ago, has a doctor told 
you that you had a stroke, mini-stroke, or TIA?”

Statistical Analysis
The  association  between  HI  and  incident  dementia  was  modeled 
using Cox proportional hazards models. Because most participants 
were not at risk of a dementia diagnosis until the second adminis-
tration of the 3MS, the origin was modeled at Year 3 (1999–2000). 
Participants  with  prevalent  dementia  at  Year  3  (n  =  149)  were 
excluded. The final administration of the 3MS to the entire Health 
ABC  cohort  was  in  2007–2008;  outcomes  were  administratively 
censored for this analysis at that time, resulting in up to 9 years of 
follow-up.  Because  hearing  was  not  measured  until  Year  5,  in  an 
additional  analysis,  we  restricted  incident  dementia  to  after  Year 
5. The assumption of proportional hazards was verified by assess-
ing correlation between scaled Schoenfeld residuals and transformed 
survival  times  (18).  Because  of  nonproportionality,  models  were 
stratified by postsecondary education. Ties were handled using the 
exact  partial  likelihood  method.  The  assumption  of  linearity  was 
assessed using smoothed residual plots. Penalized splines were used 
to allow for smooth, nonlinear effects in regression models.

Persons  with  HI,  particularly  those  with  moderate/severe  HI, 
may benefit from using a hearing aid, although the effect of hearing 
aid use on incident dementia is unknown. To assess this relationship, 
analyses were repeated restricted to 387 participants with moderate/
severe HI and including self-reported hearing aid use as a covariate.
In  the  CVS,  linear  mixed  effects  models  were  used  to  estimate 
average differences in rates of cognitive change over 7 years (1999–
2006)  by  HI  status  measured  in  2000–2001.  An  interaction  term 
between  HI  and  time  was  used  to  test  whether  rates  of  cognitive 
change differed by HI status. Time on study was the time scale.

Confounding  variables  were  selected  based  on  known  associa-
tions  between  the  confounding  factor,  HI  and  dementia/cognitive 
decline. Model 1 adjusted for demographic characteristics (age, race, 

sex, education, and study site). Model 2 adjusted for Model 1 covari-
ates and cardiovascular factors (smoking status, hypertension, and 
diabetes). Time-varying covariates were measured at Year 3.

Linear mixed effects models were estimated using PROC MIXED 
in SAS 9.3 and Stata 13 (StataCorp. 2013. Stata Statistical Software: 
Release 13, College Station, Texas, StataCorp LP). Survival analyses 
were  conducted  using  R  version  3.0.2  (September  25,  2013)  (19), 
using the survival package (20) and in Stata 13.

Results

Of the 1,889 participants, 1,103 (58%) had HI and 387 (35%) of 
participants  with  HI  had  moderate/severe  hearing  loss.  Compared 
with participants without HI, participants with moderate/severe HI 
were  older  (mean  age  76  years  vs.  75  years),  scored  lower  on  the 
3MS (92 vs. 93 points), and were more likely to be men (65% vs. 
37%)  and White  (78%  vs.  58%),  have  less  than  high  school  edu-
cation  (23%  vs.  16%),  diabetes  (22%  vs.  16%)  and  be  a  current 
or former smoker (64% vs. 49%; Table1). CVS results were similar 
(Table 1).

Dementia
Over  9  years,  229  participants  developed  incident  dementia,  with 
the  largest  proportion  of  cases  among  those  participants  with  the 
greatest level of HI (18%; Table 2, Figure 1). After full adjustment, 
the hazard ratio (HR) for incident dementia comparing participants 
with  moderate/severe  HI  to  participants  with  normal  hearing  was 
1.55 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10, 2.19; Table 2). This asso-
ciation  was  robust,  persisting  in  a  sensitivity  analysis  restricted  to 
incident  dementia  measured  from  2001  to  2008  (HR:  1.55,  95% 
CI: 1.09, 2.18) and modeling PTA continuously (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 
1.03, 1.25) per every 10-dB increase in hearing loss. Figure 2 shows 
the multivariable-adjusted results when PTA was modeled continu-
ously using penalized splines. A linear trend between increasing PTA 
and  an  increased  log  hazard  of  incident  dementia  was  observed 
between 10 and 50 dBHL.

(p  =  0.001,  Table  1),  but  mean  scores  in  psychomotor  speed  and 
perceptual speed did not differ by HI status (Table 1). The baseline

Hearing Impairment (dB HL)

Figure  2.  Multivariable-adjusted  association  between  PTA  and  incident 
dementia, Health ABC Study, N = 1,889, 1999–2008. HR of incident dementia 
associated with PTA (in dBHL) when modeled continuously using penalized 
splines (used to allow for smooth, nonlinear effects in regression models). 
Adjusted  for  age  (year),  sex,  race,  education  (less  than  high  school/highs 
school/postsecondary), study site (Memphis or Pittsburgh), smoking status 
(never/former/current),  hypertension,  diabetes,  and  history  of  stroke. 
dBHL  =  decibels  hearing  level;  Health  ABC  =  Health,  Aging  and  Body 
Composition;  HI  =  hearing  impairment;  HR:  hazard  ratio;  PTA,  pure-tone 
average.

Of the participants with moderate or severe HI, 21% (n = 176) 
used a hearing aid at Year 5. In analyses restricted to this group, the 
estimated effect of hearing aid use was in the anticipated direction 
(ie, reduced dementia risk, HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.51, 1.39) but did 
not achieve statistical significance and inference is limited, given the 
wide CI.

Cognitive Decline
We  conducted  additional  analyses  to  investigate  the  association 
between  HI  and  specific  cognitive  domains  (memory,  perceptual 
speed,  and  processing  speed).  At  baseline  (Year  3),  participants 

In  a  biracial  cohort  of  well-functioning  older  adults  (mean  age 
76  years  in  1999–2000),  our  results  demonstrate  that  moderate/
severe peripheral HI (>40 dBHL) is associated with greater risk of 
incident  dementia  over  9  years  (HR:  1.55,  95%  CI:  1.10,  2.19), 
compared  with  participants  having  normal  hearing  after  adjust-
ment for multiple demographic, health behavior, and disease covari-
ates. Except for poorer baseline memory performance (difference of 
−0.24  SD,  95%  CI:  −0.44,  −0.04),  no  associations  were  observed 
between HI and rates of 7-year cognitive change in the domains of 
memory, perceptual speed, or processing speed.

Our  results  are  consistent  with  previous  longitudinal  studies 
of  audiometric  HI  and  dementia  (1,2)  and  global  cognitive  change 
(2,6,7)  over  time.  In  639  participants  aged  36–90  years,  baseline 
HI  was  associated  with  increased  risk  of  all-cause  dementia  over 
12 years (HR: 1.27 per every 10-dB loss, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.50) (1). In 
1,057 men (mean age 56 years), each 10-dB increase in hearing level 
at baseline was associated with an increased odds of all-cause demen-
tia measured 17 years later (odds ratio: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.4, 5.2) (2).

Although  we  documented  significantly  poorer  baseline  perfor-
mance  in  memory  in  participants  with  HI,  we  did  not  find  differ-
ences in rates of cognitive decline by HI status in memory or speed. 
These  results  differ  from  previous  studies  that  have  found  faster 
rates of cognitive decline over time in persons with HI in memory 
(2,6,21,22) and executive function (7,21). The cognitive assessments 
used in this analysis were administered only to a healthy subset of all 
Health ABC  participants. Although  on  average,  cognitive  function 
in  this  group  declined  over  time,  the  decline  observed  was  about 
half the average rate of change estimated in nationally representative 
studies in older adults (23,24). Given this relative lack of decline and 
the smaller sample size, we may have been underpowered to detect a 
change in domain-specific cognitive function over time.

Whether  HI  is  a  marker  or  a  cause  of  dementia  and  cognitive 
impairment  has  yet  to  be  determined.  It  may  be  that  both  HI  and 
dementia are caused by a common underlying pathology such as vascu-
lar disease. Even though we adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, we 
cannot rule out that the observed association stems from other possible 
common  etiologies  (eg,  unmeasured  genetic  factors).  HI  may  also  be 
a  marker  of  socioeconomic  disadvantage  and/or  poorer  health;  how-
ever, our analysis adjusted for education and other demographic factors 
known to influence dementia diagnosis, and additional adjustment for 
self-reported health status did not alter the findings (data not shown).

Alternatively, we hypothesize that HI may be causally associated 
with  dementia  and  cognitive  decline  through  three  possible  mecha-
nisms:  increased  cognitive  load,  changes  in  brain  structure/function, 
and increased social isolation (9). Poor or impaired encoding of sound 
by  the  cochlea  may  require  extra  cognitive  processing  effort,  limit-
ing effort available for encoding the content of speech into memory 
and resulting in increased cognitive load, or effortful listening (25,26).

Neuroimaging  studies  suggest  that  HI  may  influence  brain  struc-
ture outside of the auditory cortex (27,28). In 126 participants aged 
56–86 years, HI was longitudinally associated with accelerated atro-
phy  in  the  right  temporal  lobe  (difference  in  annual  rate  of  change 
comparing  participants  with  and  without  HI:  −0.29 cm3;  95%  CI: 
−0.54, −0.04) as well as with whole brain atrophy (difference in annual 
rate of change associated with HI: 1.20 cm3, 95% CI: −2.17, −0.22) 
(27). An additional mechanism by which HI may cause dementia or 
reduced cognitive function is through increased social isolation. Social 
isolation  is  associated  with  physiologic  changes,  such  as  increased 
inflammation  and  glucocorticosteroid  levels,  which  may  alter  brain 
structure and has been associated with accelerated cognitive decline 
and dementia (29), although epidemiologic evidence is mixed (30,31).
The dementia diagnosis used in this study is consistent with pre-
vious  studies  in  this  cohort  but  may  be  less  sensitive  than  diagnosis 
through a structured clinical interview, and we were unable to assess 
the association between HI and dementia type. Our dementia diagno-
sis was based on prescribed dementia medication, dementia diagnosis 
from adjudicated hospital records, or an observed race-stratified 3MS 
decline more than 1.5 SDs from the baseline mean. A possible concern 
when utilizing community-diagnosed dementia (eg, medication or hos-
pital record data) is that reduced audibility can produce behaviors con-
sistent with dementia in cognitively normal individuals when assessed 
with largely auditory–verbal assessment tools. However, in our study, 
estimates  of  the  association  between  HI  and  dementia  were  similar 
whether diagnosis incorporated observed cognitive change data or was 
limited to community-based diagnosis (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.70; 
n = 114 vs. HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 0.95, 2.59; n = 115; data not shown).

Audiometric data were collected only at one point in time, and so 
we were unable to assess time-related changes in hearing status with 
cognitive  decline  and  dementia.  Because  HI  prevalence  increases 
with  advancing  age  (10),  it  is  likely,  however,  that  this  limitation 
would conservatively result in an underestimate of the association.

This  study  adds  to  the  small  body  of  epidemiologic  literature 
demonstrating a longitudinal relationship between HI and incident 
dementia  and  extends  this  observation  to  a  more  racially  diverse 
population.

In  summary,  this  study  found  that  moderate  or  severe  HI  was 
associated  with  a  55%  increase  in  the  risk  of  incident  dementia 
during 9 years of follow-up in a biracial cohort of 1,889 men and 
women aged 70–79 years at baseline (HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.19). 
These findings lend support to the hypothesis that HI may be a risk 
factor for dementia in older adults. With approximately two of the 
three adults aged older than 70 years in the United States affected by 
hearing impairment (10), HI is an attractive target for intervention 
in order to prevent or delay dementia in older adults. Randomized 
clinical trials are needed to determine whether aural rehabilitation 
can stem the oncoming tide of dementia in our aging population.
