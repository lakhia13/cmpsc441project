ABSTRACT

Background: Loss of companion animals can result in various psychological reactions, 
including complicated grief, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. However, research on 
the prevalence of patients requiring clinical intervention is limited. Moreover, research 
examining the relationship between childhood trauma and psychological symptoms after 
pet loss is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the rates of clinically significant 
psychological distress after pet loss and the impact of childhood trauma on adults who have 
experienced pet loss.
Methods: An online survey was conducted with non-clinical adult participants who had 
experienced the loss of a companion animal. Psychiatric characteristics were evaluated using 
standardized assessments, including the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG), the Patient 
Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Childhood trauma was evaluated using the Childhood Trauma 
Questionnaire (CTQ).
Results: In a sample of 137 individuals who had experienced pet loss, the percentages 
of those who exceeded the cutoff points were 55% for the ICG, 52% for the PHQ-9, 40% 
for the GAD-7, and 32% for the ISI. The group that reported childhood trauma exhibited 
significantly higher scores on the ICG (t = 2.16, P = 0.032), PHQ-9 (t = 3.05, P = 0.003), GAD-7 
(t = 2.61, P = 0.010), and ISI (t = 2.11, P = 0.037) than in the group without childhood trauma. 
For participants who experienced pet loss for less than one year, there was no significant 
difference in the ICG between the trauma and non-trauma groups, as both had extremely 
high scores. However, the trauma group had a significantly higher PHQ-9 (t = 2.58, P = 0.012) 
than the non-trauma group. In contrast, for participants who experienced pet loss for more 
than one year, the trauma group had a significantly higher ICG (t = 2.22, P = 0.03) than the 
non-trauma group, while there was no significant difference in the PHQ-9. Additionally, the 
emotional abuse scores on the CTQ were most significantly correlated with the ICG scores 
even after controlling for depressive symptoms.
Conclusion: People who experienced pet loss had significant psychological symptoms, ranging 
from 32% to 55%. Childhood trauma experiences affect complicated grief, depressive symptoms,

INTRODUCTION

The demand for companion animals in South Korea is increasing because of ongoing social 
and demographic changes, including a low birth rate and an increasing prevalence of nuclear 
families and one-person households. Based on a survey conducted in 2017,1 29.4% or 5.74 
million out of 19.52 million households in the country were raising pets. Results from a 
survey indicated that 59.9% of respondents expressed an intention to utilize pet funeral 
facilities when their companion animals pass away.2 This indicates the emergence of a 
culture where the death of a companion animal is regarded as a significant loss.2 The loss 
of a companion animal is often regarded as a major life event and a challenging time for 
individuals, akin to the death of a loved one and the associated grieving process, which is 
considered a significant life crisis.3,4 Following the loss of a companion animal, individuals 
commonly experience various psychological symptoms, including changes in sleep and 
appetite, feelings of distrust, longing, loneliness, self-blame, anxiety, anger, depression, 
sadness, and emptiness.4-6

Complicated grief (CG) is a prolonged and maladaptive response to loss that exceeds the 
culturally accepted mourning norms. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) is defined as grief that 
is intense, lasting, and interferes with daily functioning for at least one year.7 Due to the 
nature of the relationship where pet owners are solely responsible for the care of their pets, 
the loss of a pet can lead to heightened feelings of guilt compared to the loss of a human 
companion.8-10 The unique characteristics of pet loss make individuals more vulnerable to 
experiencing CG or PGD.6,11,12 Furthermore, the experience of pet loss is often marginalized 
and lacks sufficient social support. Despite the growing awareness of the significance of 
psychological interventions in response to mental health crises stemming from pet loss, 
research on the prevalence of those who require clinical intervention is limited.

Numerous studies have shown that variables such as cognitive attachment to the pet, 
duration of the relationship with the pet, unexpected loss, and type and duration of the pet's 
illness are related to grief after pet loss.6,13-15 These variables may influence the degree and 
impact of grief after the loss of a pet.3,14 In previous studies, childhood trauma experiences 
are proposed to increase sensitivity to stress in adulthood, thereby exerting ongoing negative 
effects on mental and physical health.16 Adults with a history of childhood trauma tend to 
exhibit heightened emotional responses to everyday life stressors compared to those without 
such experiences.17 Adults who have experienced such trauma were found to have increased 
sensitivity to recent stressful life events,18 and they are at risk of developing CG following 
the death of a close person, such as a spouse or friend.19 Recent studies have shown that 
adults with a history of childhood trauma exhibit higher levels of grief reactions following 
the loss of a spouse.20 However, the relationship between a history of childhood trauma and 
the presence of psychiatric symptoms in the context of pet loss remains unexplored in the 
current literature.

The Relationship Between Childhood Trauma Experience and Complicated Grief

This study investigated the rates of clinically significant psychological distress after pet loss 
and examined the association between childhood trauma and these psychological symptoms 
in adults who have experienced pet loss.

METHODS

Participants
A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of a random sample of the general Korean population 
was conducted via online contact. Participants were recruited through online platforms and 
promotional posters at the Kyungpook National University Hospital. Participants were selected 
based on the following criteria: healthy adults aged 20 years and above without any history 
of psychiatric disorders. Participants without pet loss or under 20 years of age were excluded 
from the study. Among the initial-327 participants, 218 (66.6%) consented and completed all 
questions. Eighty-one participants who exhibited low response reliability, such as consistently 
providing identical responses or displaying a narrow range of responses, were excluded from 
the analysis. Participants who scored 41 or higher on the Korean version of the Childhood 
Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were assigned to the trauma group, while those with a total 
score below 41 were assigned to the non-trauma group.21 Participants were further categorized 
according to the DSM-57 definition of PGD using one year after pet loss as a criterion.

Measures
Demographic variables, including sex, age, marriage, level of education, type of pet, and 
time since death, were collected. Participants also completed the CTQ, the Inventory of 
Complicated Grief (ICG), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).

The CTQ, a self-report measure assessing childhood trauma experiences developed by 
Bernstein and Fink in 1997.21 The CTQ consists of 28 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 
= never true to 5 = very often true) and assesses five types of neglect and abuse experiences 
(physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and sexual abuse) 
through five subscales, each with a score range of 5–25 points. A total score of 25–40 indicates 
no or minimal childhood trauma experiences, while a score of 41 or higher indicates significant 
trauma experience.21 This study used the Korean version of the CTQ for assessment.22

The ICG is a measure designed by Prigerson et al.23 in 1995 to assess pathological grief 
reactions that extend beyond normal and culturally accepted levels of bereavement and 
result in sustained psychological maladaptation. The measure consists of a 19-item self-
report questionnaire to assess pathological grief reactions. Each item is rated on a 5-point 
scale ranging from “not at all (0)” to “always (4)”.23 The original developers reported high 
internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94). There is one validation study about the 
Korean version of ICG in Korean adolescents.24 Prigerson et al.23 have previously suggested 
a threshold of 25 points to identify individuals at a higher risk of requiring treatment. In this 
study, we adopted the same cut-off of 25 points for identifying individuals at higher risk.

The PHQ-9, developed by Spitzer et al.25 in the late 1990s, is a 9-item questionnaire 
corresponding to the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder presented in the 
DSM-IV. The Korean version of the PHQ-9, translated and adapted by Han et al.26 has good 
psychometric properties. The Cronbach's α value of all items was 0.852. The sensitivity

and specificity of the Korean version of PHQ-9 were 81.8% and 89.9%, respectively.27 In a 
meta-analysis, a cut-off score of 8 to 11 was suggested as a threshold for major depressive 
disorder.28 We considered a cut-off score of 10 as the threshold for major depression.

The GAD-7 was developed by Spitzer et al.29 in 2006 to screen for generalized anxiety 
disorder, and was later validated by Kroenke et al.30 in 2007 for use in screening for other 
anxiety disorders such as panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress 
disorder. It consists of seven questions rated on a 4-point scale (0–3, not at all to nearly every 
day) to assess anxiety symptoms in the past two weeks, with a total score range of 0 to 21.29 
The total score was calculated by summing the scores assigned to each item based on the 
symptom frequency. The cutoff score for clinical significance is 10 or above, and the internal 
consistency (Cronbach's α) is 0.92.31 In a cut-off study targeting the general population, 
scores of 5 or higher were classified as mild anxiety, 10 or higher as moderate anxiety, and 15 
or higher as severe anxiety.32 In this study, we analyzed the data using a cutoff score of 10.

The ISI is used to evaluate the severity of insomnia symptoms. The scale ranged from 0 to 28, 
with a score of 15 or higher indicating clinically significant levels of insomnia.33 In this study, 
the cutoff was set at 16 points, as identified for insomnia in Korea through research.34

Data analysis
The psychological characteristics of the 137 participants who completed the survey were 
analyzed using descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations (SD). We 
classified our study participants into two groups based on the time since pet loss, specifically 
whether the grief reaction persisted for at least one year after pet loss, in accordance with the 
diagnostic criteria for PGD, as outlined in the DSM-5.7

To investigate the effect of childhood trauma on psychological outcomes after pet loss, we 
categorized 137 participants into two groups: a non-trauma group, defined as those with a 
total score on the CTQ scale of less than 41 points, and a trauma group, defined as those with 
a total score of 41 points or higher. Categorical variables such as demographic data, were 
compared between the two groups using the χ2 test, and continuous variables were compared 
using the independent t-test. Pearson’s correlation analysis measured the relationship 
between the CTQ and the ICG among the trauma group with pet loss for more than one year. 
Partial correlation analysis was used to control for the PHQ-9. All statistical analyses were 
performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0 (IBM 
Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

Ethics statement
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
Kyungpook National University Hospital (approval No. 2021-12-010). Informed consent was 
obtained from all participants upon enrollment.

RESULTS

Cross-sectional comparison of psychological characteristics
Of the 137 participants who experienced pet loss, 55% (76 participants) exceeded the cut-off 
score of 25 points on the ICG (28.24 ± 18.18), 52% (72 participants) exceeded the cut-off score 
of 10 points on the PHQ-9 (11.58 ± 8.13), 40% (55 participants) exceeded the cut-off score of

16 points on the ISI (11.6 ± 7.54) (Table 1).

Among the group of 77 participants who had pet loss within one year, 79% (61 participants) 
reported exceeding the cutoff for the ICG (36.00 ± 16.55), 62% (48 participants) on the PHQ-
9 (13.64 ± 8.18), 48% (37 participants) on the GAD-7 (9.81 ± 6.52), and 36% (28 participants) 
on the ISI (13.05 ± 7.40) (Table 1).

Among the group of 60 participants who had pet loss more than one year ago, 25% (15 
participants) reported exceeding the cutoff on the ICG (18.28 ± 15.15), 40% (24 participants) 
on the PHQ-9 (8.93 ± 8.18), 30% (18 participants) on the GAD-7 (6.58 ± 5.46), and 27% (16 
participants) on the ISI (9.75 ± 7.37) (Table 1).

Demographic and psychological differences between trauma and non-trauma 
groups
This study analyzed two groups of individuals based on 41 points on the CTQ: those who 
reported a history of trauma (8 males and 69 females) and those who did not (9 males and 
51 females). The mean score on the CTQ was 56.42 (SD, 14.67) for the trauma group and 
31.93 (SD, 4.76) for the non-trauma group. The two groups had no significant differences 
regarding sex, age, marital status, or education level. Moreover, no significant difference was 
observed between the two groups regarding the type of lost pet and duration of pet loss (P > 
0.05, Table 2). The trauma group showed significantly higher scores on the ICG (t = 2.16, P = 
0.032), the PHQ-9 (t = 3.05, P = 0.003), the GAD-7 (t = 2.61, P = 0.010), and the ISI (t = 2.11, P 
= 0.037) than the non-trauma group (Table 2).

Comparison of psychological variables between trauma and non-trauma 
groups for pet loss less than one year
A total of 77 participants, with 8 males and 69 females, who experienced pet loss less than 
one year ago and were divided into trauma and non-trauma groups. The ICG scores were 
reported as high, exceeding the cutoff score in both groups, with a mean of 37.98 (SD, 14.87) 
and 33.36 (SD, 18.47) in the trauma and non-trauma groups, respectively. However, there was 
no significant difference between the two groups regarding the ICG (t = 1.21, P = 0.012). The 
PHQ-9 scores were both above the cutoff in both groups, with a mean of 15.73 (SD, 6.99) in 
the trauma group and 10.88 (SD, 8.91) in the non-trauma group, and there was a significant 
difference between the two groups (t = 2.59, P = 0.012). The results showed no significant 
differences in GAD-7 and ISI scores between the trauma and non-trauma groups. The trauma 
group had a mean GAD-7 score of 10.98 (SD, 5.99), whereas the non-trauma group had 
a mean score of 8.27 (SD, 6.97). Similarly, the mean ISI score was 14.14 (SD, 6.88) for the 
trauma group and 11.61 (SD, 7.92) for the non-trauma group (Table 3).

score of 13.63 (SD, 13.57), resulting in a statistically significant difference between the two 
groups (t = 2.22, P = 0.030). The mean PHQ-9 score for the trauma group was 10.30 (SD, 6.19) 
and 7.26 (SD, 8.29) for the non-trauma group, with no significant difference between the two 
groups (t = 1.63, P = 0.109). There was no significant difference in the GAD-7 and ISI scores 
between the trauma and non-trauma groups. The mean GAD-7 score for the trauma group 
was 7.79 (SD, 5.13) and 5.11 (SD, 5.58) for the non-trauma group, and the mean ISI score was 
relatively low in both groups, with 11.00 (SD, 7.68) for the trauma group and 8.22 (SD, 6.80) 
for the non-trauma group (Table 3).

Correlation between the CTQ and the ICG scores in individuals experiencing 
pet loss for more than one year
A correlation analysis was conducted on 33 individuals who reported experiencing childhood 
trauma and pet loss for at least one year. The results showed a significant positive correlation 
between the total CTQ and the ICG scores (r = 0.594, P < 0.001). This trend persisted even 
after adjusting for depression scores, particularly for physical abuse (r = 0.455, P = 0.009), 
emotional abuse (r = 0.620, P < 0.001) and sexual abuse (r = 0.351, P = 0.049) (Table 4).

DISCUSSION

The present study, conducted with a sample of 137 adults, aimed to investigate psychiatric 
symptoms in adults who experienced pet loss, while exploring the association between 
childhood trauma experiences and such symptoms. Four main findings emerged: First, the 
loss of a pet can result in significant stress, with symptoms that may require psychological 
intervention, such as CG, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorder, particularly prevalent 
within the first year following the loss. Second, individuals with a history of childhood 
trauma were more likely to experience CG, depression, anxiety, and insomnia in response 
to the loss of pets. Third, individuals with a history of childhood trauma exhibited higher 
levels of depression symptoms within the first year following pet loss, and higher levels of CG 
reaction one year after a loss than individuals without trauma experience. Fourth, regarding 
the evaluated trauma group over one year since pet death, childhood trauma positively 
correlates with PGD.

A previous study found that 20% of subjects who experienced spousal bereavement exceeded 
the cutoff for the ICG.23 The study found that the mean ICG score for the 137 respondents 
who had lost a pet exceeded the cutoff point, with 55% (76 respondents) reporting scores 
indicating the need for treatment. Furthermore, more than half of the respondents 
self-reported scores on the PHQ-9 indicating major depressive disorder, 40% reported 
experiencing moderate to severe anxiety on the GAD-7, and 32% reported experiencing

moderate to severe insomnia. This suggests that pet loss can cause significant psychological 
stress, leading to CG, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorder, regardless of childhood 
traumatic experience.

However, the significant psychological stress caused by pet loss is often not understood or 
empathized within social and cultural contexts, resulting in a lack of social support such 
as bereavement leave or condolence payments. Our results suggest that many individuals 
experience psychological distress following the loss of a pet, underscoring the need for 
psychological support and a social understanding-of pet loss. Specifically, our study 
emphasizes the critical need for psychological and social support within the first year 
after the loss of a pet, as indicated by the significantly higher mean scores on measures of 
psychological symptoms during this period.

Additionally, the group with childhood trauma experiences showed statistically significantly 
higher scores on the ICG, the PHQ-9, the GAD-7, and the ISI than the group without 
childhood trauma. While research on the relationship between childhood trauma experiences 
and grief reactions to pet loss is scarce, one study has reported that adults with childhood 
trauma experiences showed higher scores on the depression scale after experiencing the loss 
of a spouse compared to a control group.20 The results of this study and previous research16,35 
support the hypothesis that individuals who have experienced childhood trauma are more 
sensitive to stressful events in life, both psychologically and physically. Considering that 
childhood trauma is an important predictor of negative mental health outcomes, medical 
professionals should pay more attention to recent life stressors, such as pet loss, in patients 
with such experiences.

Specifically, when analyzed by dividing based on one year after the loss of a pet, if pet loss 
occurred within one year, the ICG score was high regardless of the presence of childhood 
trauma, showing no significant difference. However, the PHQ-9 score was significantly 
higher in the trauma group than in the non-trauma group, indicating the need for clinical 
evaluation and management of depressive symptoms within one year of pet loss. Conversely, 
if pet loss occurred more than one year ago, the PHQ-9 score decreased, resulting in no 
significant difference between the two groups. However, the ICG score remained high in the 
trauma group, suggesting the need for evaluation and intervention for PGD in patients who 
have experienced childhood trauma.

To explore further, a positive correlation was found between the CTQ and the ICG for the 
childhood trauma group with pet loss more than one year ago, even when controlling for 
depressive symptoms. Among these correlations, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse were 
correlated with the ICG scores. Previous studies have suggested that physical, emotional, and 
sexual abuse during childhood may result in insecure attachment styles in adulthood.36,37 
Therefore, the current study suggests that adults with insecure attachment to people after 
childhood trauma may become more attached to their pets and subsequently develop excessive 
preoccupation, thoughts about the pet, and a greater sense of emptiness following pet loss.

This study has a few limitations. First, most participants (87.6%) were female, which 
may have affected the generalizability of the findings to a larger population. Females are 
sensitive not only to depression and anxiety but also at high risk of developing CG after 
major bereavement.38-40 Therefore, the reported results of depression, anxiety disorders, 
and CG following the loss of a companion animal in this study may have been exaggerated.

Additionally, since this study was conducted using anonymous internet surveys, there is a 
possibility that people who have experienced psychological distress after losing their pets 
are more likely to respond, which could introduce a sampling bias. Second, the study did not 
measure pre-existing depression, anxiety, or insomnia before pet acquisition, which could 
have confounding effects on the relationship between pet loss and CG. Future research could 
benefit from considering these psychological factors both before and after pet loss to better 
understand their potential impact on the occurrence of CG. Third, the level of attachment 
between the pet owner and the pet is a factor that can affect the occurrence of CG,14 but 
this was not controlled for in this study. It should also be noted that the reason for the pet's 
death was not examined. How a pet dies, whether through euthanasia or natural death, can 
affect pet owners’ emotions. Research has shown that caregivers tend to exhibit more anger 
when euthanasia is involved, and less anger when cancer is involved.6 Therefore, the lack of 
investigation of the cause of death is a limitation of this study.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the prevalence of those who 
require clinical intervention after pet loss and to verify the relationship between childhood 
trauma and psychiatric symptoms responses following pet loss. It is crucial to recognize 
the need for psychological support following the loss of a companion animal, as many 
individuals experience psychological symptoms within one year. Specifically, those who had 
experienced childhood trauma were more likely to report symptoms. However, the childhood 
trauma group tended to report more severe depressive symptoms within one year and more 
severe CG symptoms after one year. Therefore, it is important to provide psychological 
assistance in consideration of these findings.

Additional research is needed to explore the longitudinal interactions between childhood 
trauma and pet loss-induced psychiatric distress in subjects with adequate demographic control.
