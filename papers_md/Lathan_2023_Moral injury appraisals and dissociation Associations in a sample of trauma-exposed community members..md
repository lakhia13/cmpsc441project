Abstract

Appraisal of trauma is a critical factor in the development of impairing post-traumatic stress 
symptoms, such as dissociation. Individuals may appraise trauma as morally injurious (i.e., 
moral injury exposure [MIE]) and experience subsequent moral distress related to this exposure 
(i.e., moral injury distress [MID]). To date, however, investigation into the relations between 
moral injury appraisals and dissociation has been limited, particularly among community 
populations. This study investigated MIE and MID in relation to six facets of dissociation 
(disengagement, depersonalization, derealization, memory disturbances, emotional constriction, 
identity dissociation) in a sample of trauma-exposed community members (n=177, 58.2% Black, 
89.3% female) recruited from a public hospital and/or community advertisements. Participants 
completed measures assessing trauma exposure, MIE, MID, dissociation, and posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Partial correlation analyses revealed that after controlling for PTSD 
symptoms, MIE was correlated with disengagement, r=.23, p≤.025, and depersonalization, r=.25, 
p≤.001, and MID was correlated with depersonalization, r=.19, p≤.025. Sex moderated each 
association, with stronger associations observed for female participants. Findings provide evidence 
that moral injury appraisals are linked with severity of dissociative symptoms among female 
civilians, and as such, may need to be specifically targeted in empirically supported treatments.

Moral injury, or a sense of one’s moral or ethical code being violated, may occur after 
witnessing, perpetrating, or failing to prevent stressful or traumatic events that transgress 
core values and moral beliefs (i.e., potentially morally injurious events, PMIEs; McEwen, 
Alisic, & Jobson, 2021). Preliminary evidence suggests that civilians exposed to a PMIE 
may appraise it as morally injurious (i.e., moral injury exposure [MIE]) and/or experience 
distress related to this appraisal (i.e., moral injury distress [MID]; Fani et al., 2021). 
Although a unanimous definition has not yet been reached, researchers generally agree that 
moral injury involves particular psychological symptoms, such as feelings of guilt, shame, 
self-blame, disgust, and betrayal and spiritual/existential issues (i.e., MID), that can arise 
when an individual appraises a stressful event as “morally injurious,” or conflicting with 
their deeply held moral beliefs about themselves, others, and the world (i.e., MIE; Litz et 
al., 2009). Importantly, MIE and MID are related to an array of adverse health outcomes 
among civilians, including attempted suicide, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, 
depression, burnout, and autonomic dysregulation (Currier, Holland, Rojas-Flores, Herrera, 
& Foy, 2015; Fani et al., 2021; Hoffman, Liddell, Bryant, & Nickerson, 2018; Lathan et al., 
2022; Nickerson et al., 2018).

Traumas that represent betrayals or elicit feelings of shame tend to lead to persistent 
dissociation (Platt & Freyd, 2015; Platt, Luoma, & Freyd, 2017), a transdiagnostic 
phenomenon that involves disruptions in the integration of memory, awareness, and body 
sensations and often contributes to feelings of disconnection from one’s internal and 
external reality (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). Dissociation is frequently 
associated with emotional numbing, analgesia, heightened parasympathetic tone, and tonic 
immobility (Lloyd et al., 2019). These responses can be adaptive in the face of life-
threatening events or prolonged, repeated traumas, especially those in which escape may 
be impossible or highly risky, such as repeated childhood sexual abuse (CSA; Bailey & 
Brand, 2017).

Dissociation commonly occurs within chronically trauma-exposed populations (Schimmenti, 
2018), especially among those who experience trauma-related appraisals of betrayal, 
alienation, shame, or self-blame (DePrince, Huntjens, & Dorahy, 2015). For instance, 
DePrince and colleagues (2010) found that participants with betrayal, self-blame, and fear 
appraisals tended to have higher dissociation symptoms. Dissociation is also more likely 
among individuals who report higher PTSD severity, an early life and/or sexual trauma 
history, and female sex (Wolf, Lunney, et al., 2012; Wolf, Miller et al., 2012). Persistent 
dissociation has been linked to increased severity, chronicity, and comorbidity of psychiatric 
disorders (Lebois et al., 2022) and reduced treatment engagement and success (Boyer, 
Caplan, & Edwards, 2022). Thus, it is imperative to determine the various mechanisms 
through which dissociation is developed and maintained, including moral injury appraisals.

Appraisal of trauma has been linked to the severity of dissociative symptoms that persist 
beyond acute threat. Of note, there is a particularly strong effect for appraisals that include 
betrayal, shame, and self-blame (DePrince, Chu, & Pineda, 2011; Martin, Cromer, DePrince, 
& Freyd, 2013), which are aspects of moral injury. Further, emerging evidence suggests 
that moral injury is tied to complex PTSD (Currier, Foster, Karatzias, & Murphy, 2021), 
central features of which include disturbances in self-organization and dissociation (van

der Hart, Nijenhuis, & Steele 2005). Because dissociation is closely connected to several 
aspects of moral injury (i.e., betrayal, shame, and self-blame appraisals) and complex PTSD, 
a trauma-related disorder linked to moral injury, dissociation may also be related to MIE and 
MID.

To date, however, empirical investigation into the relations between moral injury appraisals 
and dissociation, particularly among community members, has been limited. The few 
existing studies indicate that moral injury appraisals are associated with dissociation 
in public service and military personnel. For instance, Roth et al. (2022) found that 
adverse childhood experiences were indirectly associated with dissociation in adulthood 
via moral injury symptoms among public service personnel. Another study exploring 
exposure to moral injury (assessed via the Moral Injury Events Scale; Nash et al., 2013) 
and dissociation among active-duty Marines exposed to combat found small to moderate 
correlations between perpetration- and betrayal-based and dissociation (Jordan et al., 2017), 
although this study examined MIE in relation to peritraumatic as opposed to posttraumatic 
dissociation. To our knowledge, no prior study has explored the relations between moral 
injury appraisals, specifically MIE and MID, and dissociation among civilians.

Further, MIE and MID require careful examination in relation to the various facets of 
dissociation. Decades of research support dissociation as a multidimensional construct 
(i.e., disengagement, depersonalization, derealization, identity dissociation, emotional 
constriction, memory disturbances; Briere, Weathers, & Runtz, 2005), with greater 
cumulative trauma associated with increased dissociative complexity (Briere, Dietrich, & 
Semple, 2016). Depersonalization and derealization are the two components of dissociation 
that comprise the dissociative subtype of PTSD (APA, 2013). Considering the well-
documented relationship between moral injury and PTSD (Barnes, Hurley, & Taber, 2019), 
depersonalization and derealization may be particularly salient correlates of MIE and MID. 
However, a wealth of studies suggest that PTSD is often accompanied by other types 
of dissociation as well, including identity dissociation (Schiavone, Frewen, McKinnon, & 
Lanius, 2018). Moral injury may be related to other facets of dissociation with psychological 
mechanisms different from those of depersonalization and derealization but similarly 
adverse health consequences (Brown, 2006).

In addition, researchers have posited that individuals with marginalized sex identities are 
more likely to experience the types of PMIEs with more deleterious consequences (i.e., 
betrayal-based events, such as military sexual trauma; Maguen et al., 2020), contributing 
to greater moral injury levels and adverse outcomes among those who report female sex 
(Borges, Desai, Barnes, & Johnson, 2022). Whether moral injury confers greater risk for 
dissociation among female civilians remains unknown. Similar to dissociation, MIE and 
MID are more likely to occur among community members with greater PTSD severity 
(Fani et al., 2021) and sexual violence histories (Lathan et al., 2022), two factors whose 
rates considerably differ by sex (Ponomareva & Ressler, 2021). Because female sex is 
related to increased vulnerability to negative trauma appraisals and trauma-related outcomes 
(Kucharska, 2017), it may also exacerbate the association between moral injury appraisals 
and dissociation, even when accounting for PTSD symptoms and sexual violence history. 
Taken together, noted links warrant further examination of the associations among moral

injury appraisals (i.e., MIE, MID), the six facets of dissociation, and sex while accounting 
for PTSD symptoms and sexual violence histories among trauma-exposed community 
members.

The Current Study

This study investigated moral injury appraisals in relation to facets of dissociation in a 
sample of trauma-exposed community members as well as potential sex differences in these 
associations. We hypothesized the following: (H1a) greater MIE and MID will be associated 
with more dissociative symptoms, specifically depersonalization and derealization; (H1b) 
these associations will remain statistically significant even when controlling for PTSD 
symptoms; and (H2) the associations between moral injury and dissociative symptoms will 
be moderated by sex when accounting for sexual violence history and PTSD symptoms, 
such that the association between moral injury and dissociative symptoms will be stronger 
for female as compared to male community members.

Method

Participants and Procedure

Participants (n=178; Mage=36.1 years; SDage=13.9 years) were majority Black (58.1%, 
n = 104), female (88.8%, n=159), and experiencing significant economic disadvantage 
(53.9%, n=96; i.e., <$2,000 monthly household income; Table 1). Participants were 
recruited from community advertisements and a large, publicly funded healthcare system 
in Atlanta, Georgia for involvement in an ongoing study of trauma and PTSD in 
underserved communities. As part of the parent study, trained interns approached patients 
in the emergency department and medical clinics regarding potential participation. During 
COVID-19, hospital patients were invited to participate via telephone. Informed consent 
was obtained from participants after study procedures were explained. Self-report measures 
assessing trauma history and symptoms, MIE and MID, and dissociation were verbally 
administered to consenting individuals. Data collection and study procedures were approved 
by Emory University’s Institutional Review Board and the Grady Research Oversight 
Committee.

Moral Injury.—The Moral Injury Exposure and Symptom Scale–Civilian (MIESS-C; Fani 
et al., 2021) is a 10-item questionnaire measuring moral injury across two, 5-item subscales: 
MIE (e.g., “I saw things that were morally wrong”) and MID (e.g., “I am troubled because 
I violated my morals by failing to do something that I felt I should have done”). The 
MIESS-C was adapted from the MIES (Nash et al., 2013) to assess moral injury within 
civilian populations. Responses ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). 
Internal consistency of the MIESS-C was good (α=.83). Like other studies of MIE and MID 
(Fani et al., 2021; Lathan et al., 2022), internal consistencies of the MIESS-C subscales were 
acceptable but lower than expected (MIE, α=.65; MID, α=.70).

Dissociation.—The Multiscale Dissociation Inventory (MDI; Briere et al., 2005), a 30-
item self-report measure, was used to assess the frequency of dissociative experiences across 
six, 5-item subscales: disengagement, depersonalization, derealization, identity dissociation, 
emotional constriction, and memory disturbances. Responses ranged from 1 (never) to 5 
(very often). In the current study, mean subscale scores were used, and internal consistencies 
ranged from good (α=.77, disengagement) to excellent (α=.89, emotional constriction).

Sex.—Self-reported sex was assessed using the following question: “What is your sex?” 
Response options included Male (0) and Female (1).

PTSD Symptoms.—Both the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013) 
and the Modified PTSD Symptom Scale (mPSS; Coffey, Dansky, Falsetti, Saladin, & Brady, 
1998) were used to assess self-reported PTSD symptoms given data availability (PCL-5, 
88.2%, n=157; mPSS, 11.8%, n=21). The PCL-5 and mPSS are well-validated measures; 
the PCL-5 is a 20-item questionnaire based on The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Fifth 
Edition (DSM-5) criteria (APA, 2013), and the mPSS is an 18-item measure based on 
DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000) criteria. Cronbach’s alphas of the PCL-5 and mPSS were in the 
good to excellent range (α=.92 and α=.74, respectively). Z-scores were generated for each 
scale to facilitate data pooling across measures (Fischer & Milfont, 2010).

Trauma Exposure History.—The Traumatic Events Inventory (TEI; Gillespie et al, 
2009) was used to measure participants’ self-reported exposure to various traumatic events. 
Three items were used to determine participants’ exposure to and frequency of CSA (i.e., 
“Between the ages of 0 and 13, how many times did an adult or older teenager sexually 
abuse you or have any type of sexual contact with you?”), teenage sexual abuse (i.e., 
“Between the ages of 14 and 17, how many times did an adult or older teenager sexually 
abuse you or have any type of sexual contact with you?”), and adulthood sexual assault (i.e., 
“After the age of 17, how many times has someone raped you or sexually assaulted you?”). 
Possible responses to each item ranged from 0 to (never) to 8 (>20 times). Item responses 
were summed to generate a total lifetime sexual violence score.

Data Analyses

One-hundred and eighty participants completed one or more measures of interest (i.e., 
MIEES-C, MDI) between February 2020 and May 2022. Three participants were removed 
due to failure to endorse trauma exposure on the TEI, leaving the final sample at n = 177. 
Missing MIE (2.8%, n=5), MID (2.8%, n=5), and dissociation (11.3%, n=20) data were 
handled via mean imputation. One participant declined to report their sex (0.6%), and five 
had missing lifetime sexual violence data (2.8%); listwise deletion was used in respective 
moderation analyses. None of the PTSD symptom scores were missing. See Table 2 for 
exposure to various trauma types and Tables 3 and 4 for descriptive statistics.

Pearson’s correlations were conducted to assess bivariate associations among MIE, MID, 
and the MDI’s six dissociation facets (H1a), examined as different families of tests. 
Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for error due to multiple comparisons; 
statistical significance was set at p≤.008. Where significant findings were observed, partial

correlations were conducted to determine whether these associations remained significant 
after controlling for PTSD symptoms (H1b); Bonferroni correction was also applied in these 
analyses.

To address (H2), we conducted moderation models using Hayes’ PROCESS Macro on 
associations that emerged following testing for (H1b). In each model, sex was entered as 
the moderator, and PTSD symptoms and lifetime sexual violence history were entered as 
covariates. Continuous variables were mean centered. Statistical significance was defined as 
p<.05.

Results

In support of (H1a), both MIE and MID appraisals were significantly associated with 
symptoms of dissociation, after correcting for multiple comparisons (Table 5). Namely, MIE 
and MID were positively associated with disengagement (MIE, r(177)=.32, p<.001; MID, 
r(177)=.22, p=.004) and depersonalization (MIE, r(177)=.33, p<.001; MID, r(177)=.28, 
p<.001). MIE was also positively associated with memory disturbance, r(177)=.20, p≤.008, 
and the relationships between MIE and emotional constriction, r(177)=.19, p=.02, and MIE 
and derealization, r(177)=.18, p=.02, were trending towards significance. Neither MIE nor 
MID were significantly related to identity dissociation.

Partial correlation matrices were generated to examine the relations between moral injury 
and dissociation, while accounting for PTSD symptoms (H1b). Bonferroni correction 
was applied, and statistical significance was set at p<.025. After controlling for PTSD 
symptoms and correcting for multiple comparisons, MIE was positively associated 
with disengagement, r(174)=.23, p=.002, and depersonalization, r(174)=.25, p≤.001, and 
MID was positively associated with depersonalization, r(174)=.19, p=.011. However, the 
associations between MIE and memory disturbance, r(174)=.07, p=.34, as well as between 
MID and disengagement, r(174)=.11, p=.14, did not remain statistically significant when 
including PTSD symptoms in analyses (Table 6).

To address (H2), three moderation models were conducted on associations that emerged 
via (H1b) (Table 7). In the first model, MIE served as the predictor, disengagement as 
the outcome, and PTSD symptoms and lifetime sexual violence as covariates. MIE and 
sex significantly interacted to predict disengagement when controlling for PTSD symptoms 
and lifetime sexual violence, B=.12, SD=.04, p=.004 (Figure 1). Specifically, there was a 
positive relationship between MIE and disengagement for participants who reported female 
sex (t=3.39, p<.001) and a negative relationship for those who reported male sex (t=−2.01, 
p=.047).

In the second model, MIE was entered as the predictor, depersonalization as the outcome, 
and PTSD symptoms and lifetime sexual violence as covariates. A significant interaction of 
MIE and sex on depersonalization was observed when controlling for PTSD symptoms 
and lifetime sexual violence, B=.12, SD=.04, p=.002 (Figure 2). For participants who 
reported their sex as female, MIE increased as depersonalization increased (t=3.84, p <

.001); conversely, among participants who reported their sex as male, MIE increased as 
depersonalization decreased (t=−2.08, p=.039).

In the third model, MID served as the predictor, depersonalization as the outcome, and 
PTSD symptoms and lifetime sexual violence as covariates. MID and sex significantly 
interacted to predict depersonalization when controlling for PTSD symptoms and lifetime 
sexual violence, B=.10, SD=.03, p<.001 (Figure 3). Again, results indicated a positive 
association between MID and depersonalization for female participants (t=3.34, p=.001) and 
a negative relationship for male participants (t=−2.36, p=.019).

Given the racial distribution of the current sample and extant literature supporting 
racial differences in dissociative symptoms (Douglas et al., 2009), we conducted three 
additional moderation analyses examining the associations of MIE and MID with emotional 
disengagement and depersonalization by race. Only those who reported female sex were 
included in these analyses (n = 158). In each model (n = 143), race (White or Black) was 
entered as the moderator, and lifetime sexual violence history and PTSD symptoms were 
entered as covariates. In the first model, MIE served as the predictor and disengagement 
as the outcome. MIE and race significantly interacted to predict disengagement when 
controlling for PTSD symptoms and lifetime sexual violence, B=−.06, SD=.03, p=.02 
(Figure 4). Results indicated a weaker association between MIE and depersonalization 
for Black participants (t=2.07, p=.04) than White participants (t=3.75, p<.001). MIE was 
entered as the predictor and depersonalization as the outcome in the next moderation model. 
The association between MIE and depersonalization was not moderated by race, B=−.02, 
SD=.03, p=.51. In the third model, MID was entered as the predictor and depersonalization 
as the outcome. Again, the association between MID and depersonalization was not 
moderated by race, B=−.01, SD=.02, p=.56.

Discussion

The present study examined moral injury appraisals in relation to multiple facets of 
dissociation and potential sex differences in these associations in a sample of trauma-
exposed community members. Results suggest moral injury appraisals are associated with 
greater dissociation even when accounting for PTSD symptoms and point to MIE and MID 
as potential targets in the treatment of disengagement and depersonalization among female 
civilians.

(H1a) was partially supported, in that both MIE and MID were positively correlated with 
disengagement and depersonalization, and MIE was positively correlated with memory 
disturbances. Findings suggest that higher MIE and/or MID are related to stronger 
experiential avoidance (i.e., disengagement), feelings of disconnection from one’s body 
(i.e., depersonalization), and dissociative amnesia (i.e., memory disturbance). Moral injury 
appraisals seem to be related to dissociative symptoms concerning individuals’ internal 
experience, including their relationships with their emotions and bodies. A recent study 
of the neural correlates of moral injury found heightened viscerosensory information 
processing, described as an ‘internal gnawing,’ during moral injury event recall; moreover, 
as moral injury-related shame increased, activity in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG),

a region that plays a role in self-referential processing, decreased among those with PTSD 
(Lloyd et al., 2021). Although yet to be explored, reduced interoceptive awareness may 
function as a protective mechanism following moral injury.

Conversely, neither MIE nor MID was associated with derealization, a dissociative symptom 
often described as feeling detached from the external environment, including others or 
surroundings. Altogether, results suggest moral injury appraisals may be more closely 
related to an individuals’ internal (e.g., disengagement) as opposed to external (e.g., 
derealization) experience. Additional research is needed to examine the potential role of the 
right SFG and other brain regions implicated in moral injury outcomes in the manifestation 
of dissociative symptoms that are internally versus externally focused.

As expected via (H1b), the associations between MIE and disengagement, MIE and 
depersonalization, and MID and depersonalization remained statistically significant, even 
when accounting for PTSD symptoms. Findings suggest a relationship between moral injury 
and dissociation exists above and beyond the effects of PTSD, adding to the growing body 
of literature pointing to moral injury as a phenomenologically distinct construct (Sun et al., 
2019). Moreover, both MIE and MID may be critical targets for individuals with impairing 
dissociative symptoms. Future research should expand on these findings by investigating the 
use of targeted treatments focused on moral injury in reducing both dissociation and PTSD 
symptomatology.

Results also supported (H2), which posited that the relationships discovered via (H1b) 
would be moderated by sex. Participants who endorsed relatively high levels of moral 
injury and female sex were likely to report greater dissociative symptoms, whereas 
those who endorsed relatively high levels of moral injury and male sex were likely 
to report lower dissociative symptoms. Sex-related differences in dissociative symptoms 
were most prominent at low levels of MIE and MID, with female participants reporting 
lower levels of depersonalization and disengagement than male participants. It is well-
established that female sex is associated with increased likelihood of sexual violence 
and PTSD development, even when male individuals are exposed to the same trauma 
types (Ponomareva & Ressler, 2021). Yet, these factors did not account for the sex-based 
discrepancies observed in the association between moral injury and dissociation.

Perhaps, biological sex differences and socialization can provide insight into current 
findings. Biological sex differences strongly influence early gender differences in emotion 
expression, which are refined into gender-role-consistent patterns of behaviors via 
socialization (Chaplin, 2015). While boys/men often express negative emotion via anger 
or aggression, girls/women often internalize negative emotions; dissociative symptoms may 
reflect internal expression of negative emotion experienced by women with greater MIE and 
MID appraisals. Gender differences in perceived agency may help to explain the negative 
relationship found between MIE and dissociation among men (Hsu et al, 2021); men may 
react to a potentially morally injurious event with increasing anger given greater perceived 
agency, while women may be more likely to dissociate given lower perceived agency to 
enact change. However, in the absence of highly emotionally arousing stimuli (i.e., low 
MIE or MID), men may be more inclined to disengage or depersonalize, perhaps due

to societal expectations regarding emotional expression by gender and documented sex 
differences in emotion regulation (Domes et al., 2010). While findings do reflect previous 
literature suggesting that trauma appraisals and trauma-related outcomes differ based on 
sex (Kucharska et al., 2017), it should be noted that a small proportion of our population 
reported male sex (10.1%), meaning caution should be applied when interpreting these 
data. Altogether, further study into potential explanations for observed sex differences in a 
representative male sample is needed before drawing conclusions.

Further, because most participants were Black women, findings should also be considered 
within the context of culturally salient factors that impact the ways Black women 
experience, respond to, and heal from trauma – for example, the narrative that Black 
women must disconnect from their emotional responses to uphold an image of strength 
in the face of ongoing stressors, including racism (Gómez, 2019). A consequence of this is 
increased detachment from the self and an erosion of ability to trust bodily sensations, 
which have been linked to self-devaluation and suicidal ideation (Kinkel-Ram et al., 
2021). In the current study, however, race moderated the relationship between MIE and 
emotional disengagement; surprisingly, this association was stronger for White participants 
as compared to participants of Color, highlighting the importance of examining resilience 
and posttraumatic growth in relation to moral injury in future studies. Special attention 
should also be paid to moral injury’s influence on various facets of dissociation in the 
context of factors frequently experienced by minoritized groups, such as gendered racism 
and other forms of discrimination.

This study is not without limitations, two of which include reliance on clinician-
administered self-report measures for trauma history and cross-sectional methodology, 
which bars causal conclusions. Moreover, a single self-report item was used to determine a 
participant’s sex at the binary level; it is unknown whether they answered based on external 
primary sex characteristics at birth or present or sex chromosomes, among many other 
ways to determine sex. In future studies, researchers should use a more standardized yet 
nuanced way to ascertain biological sex as well as gender identity. In addition, most of the 
present sample reported female sex, meaning male participants were underrepresented; thus, 
results regarding sex differences are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution. 
It is important to note that a similarly high proportion of the participants in the ongoing 
parent study report female sex. This is likely due to (i) several of the clinical trials or 
intervention studies included in the larger parent study (see Gillespie et al., 2009) having 
female sex or identifying as a woman as an inclusion criterion, (ii) women being more 
likely to seek preventive care, a main source of participant recruitment (Vaidya, Partha, 
& Karmakar, 2012), and (iii) women being more likely to utilize mental health services 
(Smith et al., 2013), such as those offered by our study. Those who identified outside of the 
male/female binary were not represented in the current study, highlighting an important area 
of future research. Although all participants denied a history of military combat exposure, 
it is possible that participants had prior non-combat military experience; in future research, 
participants should be screened for all forms of military experience. Lastly, although the 
internal consistency of the total scale was good (α=.83), the internal consistencies of MIE 
and MID were lower than expected, perhaps due to few items comprising each scale. It is 
important to note that these subscales were theoretically, not empirically, derived (Braitman

et al., 2018; Fani et al., 2021), meaning a different factor structure, such as Nash et al. 
(2013), may be better suited for use among civilians. Future research should evaluate 
the MIESS-C’s psychometric properties, specifically the degree to which MIESS-C items 
overlap with betrayal, self-blame, and shame, to inform best practices regarding assessment 
of civilian moral injury.

Implications

The present study adds to the growing body of literature supporting the role of moral 
injury appraisals in psychological distress and impairment following trauma. Findings 
highlight moral injury appraisals as a potential mechanism through which dissociative 
symptoms emerge. Noted links suggest moral injury appraisals may be key targets in the 
treatment of dissociative symptoms, particularly among trauma-exposed, female community 
members. Currently, however, empirically supported psychotherapeutic treatment options 
for civilian moral injury are non-existent. Extant evidence-based moral injury treatments, 
Trauma Informed Guilt Reduction therapy (Norman, 2022) and Adaptive Disclosure 
(Darnell, Vannini, Grunthal, Benfer, & Litz, 2022), require evaluation for efficacy in non-
military populations. Although traditional PTSD interventions, such as Cognitive Processing 
Therapy and Prolonged Exposure, reduce feelings of shame and guilt following trauma in 
civilians, the active ingredients need to be isolated to streamline treatment of civilian moral 
injury. Present findings call for, and may help inform, the development of evidence-based 
intervention strategies for concurrent moral injury appraisals and dissociative symptoms 
among trauma-exposed community members.
