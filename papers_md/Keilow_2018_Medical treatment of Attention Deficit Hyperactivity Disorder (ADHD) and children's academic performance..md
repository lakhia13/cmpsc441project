Abstract

Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is negatively associated with a range of aca-
demic achievement measures. We use Danish administrative register data to study the
impact of medical treatment of ADHD on children’s academic performance assessed by stu-
dent grade point average (GPA). Using administrative register data on children, who begin
medical treatment, we conduct a natural experiment and exploit plausible exogenous varia-
tion in medical nonresponse to estimate the effect of medical treatment on school-leaving
GPA. We find significant effects of treatment on both exam and teacher evaluated GPAs:
Compared to consistent treatment, part or full discontinuation of treatment has large signifi-
cant negative effects reducing teacher evaluation and exam GPA with .18 and .22 standard
deviations, respectively. The results demonstrate that medical treatment may mitigate the
negative social consequences of ADHD. Placebo regressions indicate that a causal inter-
pretation of our findings is plausible.

Introduction

One in five individuals experiences the onset of mental health problems before reaching adult-
hood [1]. Mental health problems in childhood have substantial consequences for later life
because such problems are associated with lower educational achievement and attainment.
Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) represents one such mental health prob-
lem, which infers substantial individual and societal costs if left untreated [2]. Children with
ADHD have lower grade point average (GPA), do worse on academic tests, have higher reten-
tion rates and absenteeism, and have lower high school and college completion rates [3–9].
Recent research has linked ADHD to delayed maturation of parts of the brain directly

related to cognition [10–12], indicating a direct biological link between ADHD and low educa-
tional achievement. In addition, ADHD may also negatively affect the learning environment
in children’s homes. An emerging body of work demonstrates that undiagnosed or untreated

Medical treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and children’s academic performance

ADHD leads to increased family instability, such as increased risk of parental union dissolu-
tion [13–14] and for entering an out-of-home placement [15]. Thus, beyond the direct effect
on cognitive abilities, ADHD may cause lower educational achievement and attainment
through affecting life circumstances outside the classroom, leaving affected children double
disadvantaged.

One of the modal ways to address the behavioral problems related to ADHD is through
medical treatment with psychotropic drugs. Although the use of these drugs is not uncontro-
versial [16–19], drug therapy has been consistently shown to address core symptoms among
children with moderate to severe ADHD [20]. If ADHD affects educational outcomes nega-
tively, successful treatment could reduce the negative educational consequences caused by
ADHD.

This study tests whether efficient medical treatment of ADHD affects children’s academic
performance by utilizing a natural experiment. The medical literature documents that 25 to 30
percent of treated individuals with ADHD are nonresponders. Nonresponders are unaffected
by the medication or have severe side effects, in either case causing them to discontinue treat-
ment even though they show the same symptoms as responders prior to treatment [21]. There
do not appear to be significant socioeconomic differences between responders and nonre-
sponders [22–23] nor do individual characteristics (age, gender, IQ, ADHD subtypes and
symptoms, neuropsychological characteristics) predict treatment response [24–25]. Under this
assumption of no significant differences between responders and nonresponders, we compare
the academic performance of children diagnosed with and treated for ADHD, who either dis-
continue treatment (nonresponders) or continue treatment (responders) to estimate the effect
of medical treatment on academic performance. In our study, we have no selection into treat-
ment as all individuals in our analysis initiate treatment. We may have selection out of treat-
ment. However, as argued above, we believe that selection out of treatment is random. We
substantiate this below.

We find that medical treatment has a significant and sizeable effect on long-term academic

performance outcomes in terms of school-leaving GPA. The effect of medical treatment of
ADHD is comparable in size to the gender differences in GPA. To test whether a causal inter-
pretation of the results is plausible and to account for any social gradient in treatment patterns,
we estimate the effect of treatment with and without a rich set of potential confounders and
perform placebo regressions on a sample of children, who initiate medical treatment after
graduation (i.e. after receiving their final grades). We find no significant differences in the
effect of treatment with and without confounders and we find no differences in the GPA
between medical responders and nonresponders in the placebo sample, indicating that the
main results likely express causal effects. Our results demonstrate that medical treatment of
ADHD may play a substantial role in diminishing educational disparities caused by the
condition.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant literature
and theories on the effect of ADHD and ADHD treatment on educational outcomes. Section 3
presents the data for our empirical analysis. Section 4 presents our identification strategies and
statistical method. Section 5 presents results. Section 6 discusses the findings and concludes.

ADHD and educational outcomes

Untreated behavioral problems may substantially impair children’s learning and educational
achievement [26–27]. Previous studies have found that children diagnosed with ADHD on
average attain 2.2 to 2.5 years less schooling than non-ADHD peers do, and 25 percent of stu-
dents with ADHD drop out of high school [5,8,9,27]. Recent work has further shown that both

externalizing behaviors and attention deficits contribute to the lower educational attainment
[7]. Children with ADHD also display lower cognitive achievements, lower test scores, and
higher scholastic impairment [5,28], with especially attention problems predicting poorer
math and reading achievement [29–30]. Thus, research consistently shows that ADHD affects
a number of various educational outcomes ranging from performance and achievement mea-
sures to school behaviors. In this study, we focus specifically on student academic performance
assessed by teacher evaluation and exam GPA. In the remainder of this section, we discuss bio-
logical and social mechanisms linking ADHD to decreased educational achievement out-
comes, as well as how efficient medical treatment can sever parts of the link.

Double disadvantage: Biological and social consequences of ADHD and
educational outcomes

The research literature on the consequences of ADHD for children’s lives indicates two mutu-
ally reinforcing pathways through which the disorder affects educational outcomes: direct bio-
logical effects on cognitive development and indirect effects on children’s home environment
that likely affect learning.

Neurological research has shown that children with ADHD experience delayed matura-
tion of the brain—more specifically delayed growth of the pre-frontal cortex, i.e. the part of
the brain associated with the regulation of executive functions, such as complex cognition,
decision-making processes, and the moderation of social behavior. In their seminal longitu-
dinal study of 223 children diagnosed with ADHD and 223 typically developing controls,
Shaw et al. [10] show substantial delay in the maturation of the pre-frontal cortex among
children with ADHD. Among children with ADHD, 50 percent of cortical points had
reached peak thickness at age 10.5 years, three years later than among the typically developed
controls. More recent work by Sripada, Kessler and Angstadt [11] further renders probable
that children with ADHD also experience delayed maturation of deeper parts of the brain’s
architecture and pathways, which are associated with attention, control of impulsivity, disre-
gard of irrelevant stimuli, and other cognitive tasks. In total, there is strong evidence that
delayed neurobiological development of areas of the brain that moderate behavior is impor-
tant for conductive learning-behavior among children with ADHD. The neurobiological
findings dovetail with studies of educational performance among children with ADHD,
which find that both inattention and externalizing behavior predicts worse educational out-
comes [5,7,28–30].

Yet, delayed cognitive maturation may not be the only cause driving the relationship
between ADHD and low educational achievement. Neither learning nor ADHD occur in a
social vacuum. Beyond the direct neurobiological effects, ADHD also places strain on chil-
dren’s life circumstances outside the educational system in ways that could deter learning.
Untreated ADHD increases the risk of experiencing family instability, such as parental divorce
[13–14] and, more dramatically, the risk of entering an out-of-home placement [15]. The asso-
ciation between family instability and lower educational achievement is well-established,
although recent work has called (the generalizability of) causal claims into question [31–33].
Yet, for children with ADHD, family stability could likely worsen an already vulnerable learn-
ing situation. Thus, the effect of ADHD on educational achievement is likely not only driven
directly by delayed maturation of the brain, but also by secondary effects of ADHD on chil-
dren’s life and learning circumstances. Because research has shown that medical treatment of
ADHD both mitigates the direct behavioral symptoms and lowers the risk of family instability
and engaging in risky behavior, treatment could also have substantial impact on educational
achievement.

Medical treatment of ADHD and educational outcomes

The strong association between ADHD and the above-mentioned host of negative outcomes
has given rise to a number of treatment types, with pharmacological treatment with stimulants
being the most common form [20,34]. Overall the short term efficacy of medical treatment on
core ADHD-symptoms is well documented for the age group 6–18 years by over 200 clinical
RCT’s since the 1960s [20]. Short-term medical treatment effects on academic achievement
outcomes have also been studied extensively and show positive effects [35], whereas long-term
studies of the effects on education are scarce and effects are generally more diverse, smaller, or
less significant than short-term effects [36]. In their recent review, Baweja et al. [3] conclude
that the evidence for a positive effect of medical ADHD treatment on school performance
remains more substantial for acute than long-term indicators of academic performance.
Baweja et al. [3] also note that evidence is strongest for the effect of stimulants to improve
teacher ratings of behavioral outcomes. Methodological problems, such as sample attrition, are
a probable explanation for the lack of empirical support for long-term effects, wherefore the
want of research on this matter is substantial [35]. Nevertheless, as outlined above, the substan-
tial number of both clinical and non-clinical findings on the impact of medical treatment of
ADHD on domains of children’s lives connected with education do suggest that medical treat-
ment could increase educational achievement among affected children.

Data
Data sources

We use data from Danish administrative registers collected by Statistics Denmark. The pri-
mary data sources are the Danish Registry of Medicinal Product Statistics (RMPS) and the
national registers on educational attainment (REA). Danish registers offer extensive individ-
ual-level information on all educational courses commenced in the public educational system
and various academic performance measures. Register data has almost no sample drop out or
attrition and validity and coverage is very high; e.g. in 2008, 96 percent of the Danish popula-
tion aged 15–69 have non-missing education information [37]. From 2002, REA contains
teacher evaluation grades and exam grades of students, who graduate the compulsory level of
schooling (ninth grade in Denmark). From these school-leaving grades, we create our outcome
measures by calculating standardized overall teacher evaluation and exam GPA.

Data from RMPS contain detailed information on all legal purchases of prescription drugs
in Denmark (date, type of drug, dosage, etc.). The prescription data are linked to the individual
identification number of the patient through the Danish health insurance system [38]. By
using register data we avoid bias from refusal of participation, which is often a problem for
survey data studies of ADHD [39–40] as well as recall bias from self-reported information on
medical treatment patterns and academic performance. The RMPS is found to have a high
completeness and validity, which is mainly due to reimbursement-driven record-keeping with
automated bar-code-based data [40–41].

Operationalization of treatment patterns

In order to determine the effect of medical treatment of ADHD, we use longitudinal data from
RMPS and define three types of pharmacological treatment patterns of use in the analysis: Dis-
continued Pharmacological Treatment (DPT), Ambiguous Pharmacological Treatment (APT),
and Continuous Pharmacological Treatment (CPT). The difference between these three types
of treatment allows us to estimate the effect of treatment by comparing the outcome across the
three different treatment patterns with the DPT acting as a control group and the CPT as a

treatment group and the APT as a partial compliance group. The definition of discontinuation
(DPT) follows strict restriction rules: we define DPT as having purchased medication for maxi-
mum three months within the data window, which just allows for initial medicine trial and
dose titration. Likewise, the definition of continuous treatment (CPT) is restricted to those,
who have a regular and stable use of medication with purchases being no more than three
months apart. The patterns of the remaining group, the APTs, are then per definition ambigu-
ous as they cannot be convincingly placed in either the DPT or CPT category. These are chil-
dren, who repeatedly enter in and out of medical treatment. All three categories are mutually
exclusive. In all analyses, CPT is reference group, whereby we investigate inverse treatment
effects of DPT and APT (discontinuation and ambiguous treatment) compared to CPT (con-
tinuous treatment).

Sample criteria

We sample all children diagnosed with and treated for ADHD from the total population of
children, who completed Danish compulsory schooling from 2002 to 2011. To identify medi-
cally treated children (irrespective of their subsequent treatment pattern), we select children,
who redeem at least one prescription for any type of ADHD medication (methylphenidate,
atomoxetine, or modafinil) between age twelve and prior to school-leaving exams (treatment
sample). Note that amphetamine salts were not introduced in Denmark for treatment of
ADHD until 2013 due to official national restrictions and that these types of drugs are there-
fore not included in our sample criteria. We exclude children, who begin treatment before age
twelve because scholastic impairment is likely less traceable among children at this age and
because they more likely suffer from hyperactivity than attention problems (the latter of which
especially predict lower academic achievement). All analyses were also conducted for the total
sample yielding very similar results. We define an additional sample of children, who start
treatment after school-leaving exams and use this as a placebo sample (we elaborate on this in
section 4 on methods).

We restrict both samples further using the following criteria. First, children who either dis-
continue medical treatment within the first three months of the RMPS data window or begin
treatment during the last three months of the data window are excluded from analyses, as the
treatment patterns of these children cannot be convincingly determined. Second, the sample is
restricted to cases with valid information on main outcome variables; teacher evaluation and
exam GPA. In our data, 92 percent of all children have valid information for GPA, compared
to 70 percent of children diagnosed with and treated for ADHD. For students in public
schools, the school-leaving examinations are obligatory, but exemptions can be applied for
(reasons for exemption could be severe functional impairments) [42]. Exams are not obliga-
tory in private schools, though a school-leaving diploma is required for almost all upper sec-
ondary educational tracks.

Third, we exclude children, who commence treatment around the time point of exams to
minimize the risk that we include children, whose (expected) poor exam performance causes
them to commence treatment to boost future academic performance [43]. These restrictions
result in a treatment sample consisting of 2659 individuals from the birth cohorts 1984–1996,
and, correspondingly, a placebo sample of 3785 individuals from the birth cohorts 1983–1994.

Variables

To account for any effect of the duration of medical ADHD treatment, severity of symptoms,
or potential correlations between age and treatment response [36], we control for individual
age at treatment start. Age at graduation is included to control for grade retention. We further

Medical treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and children’s academic performance

control for the medical dosage using the number of Defined Daily Doses (DDD) [44] for the
individuals’ first and third purchase of ADHD medication. The severity of ADHD symptoms
(which is unobserved) may both influence dosage and whether an individual child continues
treatment [24–25]. Controlling for dosage titration may break the correlation between severity
of the condition and treatment continuation. Hence, if controlling for medication dosage
alters the estimated effect of treatment continuation this is evidence that severity and continu-
ation are correlated. To control for comorbidity issues [45], we also include information on
use of psychoactive medication for conditions other than ADHD. Data on any comorbid diag-
noses are not, however, available.

To account for the event that treatment patterns (DPT and APT versus CPT) vary across

child and family characteristics, we include a rich set of control variables. Individual level
information includes gender, immigrant status, birth weight, and gestational age. Studies show
that birth characteristics predict ADHD symptoms [46–47] and correlate with academic per-
formance measures such as GPA [48]. We also include a dummy indicator for whether or not
the child was graded using a new Danish grading scale introduced in 2008 [49] to account for
any impact of this change on our results. (Grades from before 2008 are converted to the grade
scale for 2008 using the official grade conversion table. The dummy variable thus captures any
potential differences in grading across 2007/2008 that are not fully accounted for by the con-
version of grades. The estimate of the dummy variable is insignificant in all analyses).

We measure parental characteristics one year prior to the birth of the child to avoid post

treatment confounding. We control for parental income (including dummies for negative
income generated by negative income from self-employment), unemployment, educational
level (ISCED code dummies), parent age at the birth of their child, and whether either parent
has an ADHD diagnosis.

Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of all background variables. We show data for the
population of the full population sample of 2002–2011 graduates and for our restricted treat-
ment and placebo sample. Of the most notable differences, the proportion of males and non-
immigrant Danes are higher in both the treatment and placebo sample compared to the popu-
lation. The gender difference is most pronounced in the treatment sample, however. The over-
representation of males and ethnic Danes is consistent with clinical accounts of diagnostic
patterns for ADHD. Parents of children in the ADHD samples are slightly younger, more
likely to have an ADHD diagnosis, have higher unemployment rates, lower income, and a
greater proportion of parents have lower educational attainment levels. For several characteris-
tics, there are notable differences between the treatment and placebo sample. However, as we
show in the results section, these differences do not seem to alter how medical treatment
affects the outcome. We offer explanations as to why below.

Table 2 presents descriptive statistics on outcome measures. Teacher evaluation GPA
reflects students’ academic performance in class as evaluated by the teacher, whereas exam
GPA reflects assessments made by the students’ teacher as well as an external examiner during
the school-leaving exams (oral and written). Whereas teacher evaluation GPA thus reflects stu-
dents’ behavior as well as their academic performance, exam GPA can be interpreted as an esti-
mate of student academic performance. Because exams include an external assessment as well
as written exams, student behavior that is unrelated to their actual achievement less likely
influences these assessments. Grades are assessed using the Danish 7 point grading scale,
which corresponds to the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS)-scale
[49]. All empirical models use GPAs standardized within the population sample. Both the
main ADHD sample and the placebo sample have substantially and significantly lower GPAs
than found for the full population.

Medical treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and children’s academic performance

Method

We estimate the effect of medical treatment on school-leaving GPAs for a sample of children
diagnosed with ADHD, who initiate medical treatment. Our design has the advantage of cir-
cumventing selection into diagnosis and treatment of ADHD, as all children in the sample
have been diagnosed and have initiated treatment. However, selection out of treatment may be
an issue. As mentioned previously, we exploit evidence from medical research showing that
individual response towards ADHD medication regarding the improvement of core symptoms
is arbitrary with respect to individual characteristics of the patient [22–23,25,36]. Conse-
quently, among a group of individuals diagnosed with ADHD, whether or not the medication
reduces individual symptoms is from a medical perspective as good as random.

Analytical setup

To measure the effect of medication on students’ school-leaving GPA we estimate the follow-
ing regression:

GPAi ¼ Xib þ g1DPTi þ g2APTi þ ei

ð1Þ

where GPAi is student GPA, Xi is a vector of individual characteristics, β is a vector of corre-
sponding regression coefficients, DPT and APT are binary indicators of discontinued treat-
ment and ambiguous treatment. ei is the error term. The regression coefficient γ1 measures the
average difference in outcomes between those continuing medication (CPT) and those discon-
tinuing medication (DPT) from the onset of diagnosis and until completing compulsory
school, where GPA is measured.

The interpretation of γ2 is less clear-cut, but captures the average difference in outcome
between a continued treatment pattern and the average ambiguous treatment pattern (APT).
The effect thus both depends on the effectiveness of the medication (generating a difference
between those with an ambiguous and a continuous medical consumption) and it depends on
the distribution of the ambiguous treatment patterns in the data. If APT patterns on average
are close to full compliance, children in this group should have the same outcome as the CPTs.
If, however, they, on average, are close to a full discontinuation of treatment, children in this
group should, on average, have the same outcome as the DPTs. At any rate, a negative estimate
of γ2 indicates that medication is effective.

Although random nonresponse is supported by empirical evidence, drop out from medical

treatment in observed data may be nonrandom for a number of other reasons. Take-up rates
of prescriptions have a social gradient due to economic constraints for poorer families to
finance medication consistently, and at-risk families may be less inclined to follow medical
advice or to comply with medical treatment despite negative side effects. Studies find that this
applies for health care in general [50–51] and for mental health care and ADHD treatment in
specific [52–53]. Such social gradient patterns may also help explain the existence of APT pat-
terns in data. However, for differences in background characteristics to be important con-
founding factors, background characteristics should both correlate with the allocation into
treatment patterns and simultaneously have a direct effect on the GPA outcomes [54].

To evaluate the extent that omitted variables bias our results we estimate Eq (1) both with

and without observed covariates. If the differences between CPT, APT, and DPT are unaf-
fected by including observed covariates, this indicates either that observed background charac-
teristics are uncorrelated with our treatment indicators or with our outcome of interest. If so,
this may also suggest that the observed differences in outcomes across CPT, APT, and DPT are
unaffected by unobserved covariates as well, which in turn makes a causal interpretation of the
treatment estimates more likely.

Medical treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and children’s academic performance

During the last 20 years, the number of medical products available has increased, while
existing medical products have been enhanced [55–56]. Such developments may increase the
probability that individuals continue medical treatment for ADHD once they start. However,
the observed changing rates of DPT, APT, and CPT across time may also reflect a changing
composition of the students in our data (students diagnosed with ADHD who commence
treatment) across births cohorts. This could lead to selection bias. To control for this, we use a
two-stage Heckman selection estimator to correct for sample selection into our data across
birth cohorts [57]. As exclusion restrictions, we use children’s residential region at age three
and their birth cohort in the selection equation only [58]. The propensity to prescribe medica-
tion differs across Danish regions [15,59], wherefore region of residence at a young age likely
affects the propensity to enter medical ADHD treatment. As medical treatment has become
increasingly more widespread, birth cohort may also affect the propensity to enter medical
treatment. Birth cohort does not affect GPA because grades are by construction independent
across cohorts in accordance with the grading legislation of the Danish compulsory schools
[60]. We control for region of residence at graduation in the main equation to allow for the
effect of unobservables across regions.

To further test whether we can view treatment patterns as an exogenous indicator of nonre-

sponse to medical treatment, we use the availability of a placebo treatment group: students,
who commence medical treatment after graduation (thus after receiving their grades) and for
whom we should expect no treatment effect on their GPA (see Johansen et al. [61] for a similar
design). Estimating Eq (1) on the placebo sample should yield no effect unless nonresponders
(DTP) are selected on unobservables compared to responders (CPT) and ambiguous respond-
ers (APT). Children in the placebo and the treatment sample do on average differ in the timing
of their treatment, and this may imply additional underlying differences in their background
characteristics, as Table 1 shows. However, as we show in the result section the differences
across DPT, APT and CPT are statistically insignificant indicating that estimated effects are
unaffected by the inclusion of covariates in the treatment sample. Hence, it is unlikely that the
differences in estimated effects with and without controls are important for comparing the dif-
ferences between DPT, APT and CPT across the treatment and placebo sample. Moreover,
from our data we find that students in the treatment sample and placebo sample are equally
negatively affected by having an ADHD diagnosis in terms of their academic performance.
This speaks in favor of comparability of the treatment and the placebo sample.

Results

In this section, we present main results estimating Eq (1) on the sample of children diagnosed
with ADHD.

Panel A in Table 3 shows estimation results for standardized exam GPA, whereas panel B
shows estimation results for standardized teacher evaluation GPA. We replicate all treatment
sample estimations in the placebo sample for both outcomes. However, as the results for the
placebo sample are almost identical we only show the more statistically efficient estimates with
adjustment for selection.

Model 1 in panel A reports differences across treatment patterns, such that children who
follow continuous treatment (CPT) have significantly higher exam GPAs compared to those,
who discontinue treatment partly (APT). The effect of DPT (full discontinuation) is -0.13, yet
insignificant, and the effect of APT is -0.12 and significant. Including control variables (model
2) further increases these effects to -0.22 for DPT and -0.13 for APT, albeit estimates with con-
trols are not significantly different from the estimates without controls. Nevertheless, control-
ling for background characteristics we thus find more than a fifth standard deviation

difference between DPT and CPT and more than a tenth of a standard deviation difference
between APT and CPT. Controlling for selection into our sample of initially treated students
(model 3) has virtually no impact on the estimated effects across treatment groups, hence sam-
ple heterogeneity across birth cohorts seems negligible.

For the placebo sample (model 4), we find no differences across treatment groups, indicat-
ing no selection bias on unobservables for the placebo sample into DPT, APT and CPT. If we
are willing to assume that this also applies for the treatment sample—supported by the fact
that including controls did not change parameters in the treatment sample—the results sup-
port a causal interpretation of the effect of medication on GPA. One may argue that the pla-
cebo sample is not entirely comparable with the treatment sample, as they are diagnosed a
considerable time after their exams. However, restricting the placebo sample to a narrower age
range (only including students beginning treatment no later than age 24 or students beginning
treatment no later than five years from graduation) does not alter our conclusions.

Inspecting the effect of the covariates on the outcome, we find much the expected sizes and
signs: Males have lower exam GPA. Parent educational attainment level is positively correlated
with exam GPA. Children whose mother is diagnosed with ADHD have a slightly higher GPA.
The reason for mothers (and partly fathers) diagnosis being positively associated with GPA
could be the fact that we study a selected sample; those diagnosed with ADHD (irrespective of
their subsequent treatment pattern in terms of DPT, APT or CPT). Within this sample,

parental experience with a diagnosis may prove to be beneficial. For the total population, how-
ever, the association is reversed; on average, students, whose parents have ADHD, obtain
lower grades than students, whose parents do not have an ADHD diagnosis.

When re-estimating regressions including an interaction between duration and treatment

pattern, we find that duration (measured in months) in itself has a very small yet significant
positive influence on our outcome, but the interactions are nonsignificant. Thus, we do not
find evidence that our main effects of treatment patterns vary with duration.

Comparing the covariate estimates for the treatment and placebo sample reveals similar
sizes of the estimates for most control variables. This indicates that the selection process into
the two samples is similar. Had they been different, we should have seen marked differences
between the estimates because different selection processes would have yielded different selec-
tion bias in the estimated coefficients.

Panel B in Table 3 presents results for standardized teacher evaluated GPA. Treatment esti-
mates are of similar magnitude compared to the estimates for exam GPA, i.e. .18 for DPT and .11
for APT (model 2). In addition, the control variables have similar effects on both GPA outcomes.
In sum, we find evidence of a positive effect of medical treatment on school-leaving exam and

teacher evaluation GPAs for students diagnosed with ADHD, who enter treatment. Our results
are robust to the inclusion of control variables and selection into the group of treated students.
Moreover, there are no differences in GPA outcomes across treatment patterns for students begin-
ning treatment after receiving their school-leaving GPA, which support our main results.

Conclusion

In this study, we find that increased efficiency of medical treatment of ADHD can alleviate a
substantial part of the GPA gap between children diagnosed with ADHD and their peers. Our
empirical analyses show substantial and significant negative effects from discontinued phar-
macological treatment (DPT) and ambiguous pharmacological treatment (APT) on school-
leaving teacher evaluation and exam GPAs compared to consistent treatment (CPT). Treat-
ment effects are synonymously negative, in the sense that both DPT and APT lower GPA
across various model estimations and are robust to the statistical control for a large set of
covariates and selection models.

Teacher evaluation GPA likely reflects both academic performance and student behavior in

class. In this respect, teacher evaluated GPA reflects non-cognitive skills over and above the
cognitive skills reflected in exam GPA. Finding that treatment effects are similar for teacher
assessed performance (teacher evaluation GPA) and exam performance (exam GPA) supports
the notion that medical treatment raises student academic performance and not merely alters
student behavior in class.

Our main findings support an overall beneficial effect of medical treatment on long-term
individual academic performance of children diagnosed with ADHD. Relying on the fact that
national guidelines only recommend medical ADHD treatment for moderate to severe cases,
children in the sample likely have moderate to severe symptoms, in which case benefits may
exceed negative side-effects of treatment. In addition, Danish treatment rates of ADHD are
more than 80 percent lower than, for example, US treatment rates [15]. Although due consid-
eration should be given to the necessity of medicine versus alternative modes of interventions
or combined treatment, medication may help certain children diagnosed with ADHD to func-
tion in an everyday school context when baseline-treatment levels are of a moderate size.

As medical treatment affects school-leaving GPA of individuals diagnosed with ADHD,
treatment likely influences subsequent educational and vocational tracks as well; for example
choice of post-secondary tracks, dropout rates, unemployment propensity, adult profession,

Medical treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and children’s academic performance

and adult income as these are all strongly correlated with school-leaving GPA. International
studies have also found evidence of such effects from ADHD diagnosis. However, due to inter-
disciplinary gaps between social and medical studies, research is needed that can adequately
account for diagnosis and treatment as well as for the endogeneity when studying long-term
social outcomes of children diagnosed with ADHD.

Limitations

This study finds that medicine exerts a profound influence on the educational outcomes of
children diagnosed with ADHD. Methodologically, our analysis rests on the stable unit treat-
ment value assumption, implying that potential individual outcomes are unrelated to the treat-
ment status, outcomes or characteristics of other individuals. However, children with ADHD
are part of social contexts—school classes, families, etc.—and the individual effects of treat-
ment presented should ideally be construed in its context. Therefore, additional research
should study the impact of ADHD treatment on peers and families. A few recent studies sug-
gest that ADHD and medical treatment hereof affects academic outcomes of non-ADHD sib-
lings [8] and classroom peers [62]. Further, our effects are found in a context where only
severe or moderate cases of ADHD are recommended to initiate pharmacological treatment.
Hence, further studies are needed to assess the effects of treatment on long-term academic out-
comes in contexts where less severe cases are also treated.

Perspectives

More than four decades of sociological research has voiced concerns about medicalization,
social control, and the social construction of problem behaviors [16–18]. Recent research
shows that increasing medical treatment rates of ADHD in populations with high baseline-
treatment levels likely has adverse consequences for children [63]. Yet, it remains a well-docu-
mented fact that children with behavioral and mental health problems, such as ADHD, have
poorer later life outcomes than their peers. In addition, research from countries with low base-
line-levels of ADHD treatment consistently shows that in this context, medical treatment low-
ers problem behavior [59]. Our study adds to this research and our results indicate that
medical treatment can improve the educational trajectories of children diagnosed with moder-
ate to severe symptoms ADHD. Furthermore, in our theory section we outline two distinct but
interrelated pathways through which ADHD likely affects educational outcomes—a direct,
neurobiological impact on cognition and attention, as well as an indirect pathway changing
learning environments. Further knowledge on the importance of each of these pathways in
shaping children’s educational outcome could provide valuable insight into how to best
address the educational challenges faced by children with behavioral problems, and should be
the subject of future research.
