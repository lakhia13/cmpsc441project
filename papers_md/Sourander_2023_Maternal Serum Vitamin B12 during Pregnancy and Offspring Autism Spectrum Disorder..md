Abstract: This study examined the association between maternal serum vitamin B12 levels during
early pregnancy and offspring autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and subtypes. Based on a Finnish
national birth cohort, case offspring (n = 1558) born in 1987–2007 and diagnosed with ASD by 2015
were matched with one control on date of birth, sex and place of birth. Maternal vitamin B12 levels
were measured during ﬁrst and early second trimesters of pregnancy. High maternal vitamin B12
levels (≥81th percentile) was associated with increased risk for offspring childhood autism, adjusted
odds ratio, 1.59, 95% conﬁdence interval 1.06–2.41 (p = 0.026). No signiﬁcant associations were
observed between maternal vitamin B12 levels and offspring Asperger’s or pervasive developmental
disorder/NOS.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental
conditions characterized by impairment in social communication and interaction, accompa-
nied by restricted and repetitive patterns in behaviors, interests and activities [1]. There
is a wide recognition that the etiology of ASD is multifactorial, involving the interplay of
genetic and environmental factors [2]. Strong evidence has suggested that ASD is inﬂu-
enced by prenatal factors [3] including maternal nutrition [4]. Speciﬁc nutrients have been
identiﬁed as potentially impacting the risk for ASD, for example, folate, vitamin D, iron
and polyunsaturated fatty acids, but the ﬁndings are often mixed [5,6].

Vitamin B12 is essential for normal growth, development and physiological func-
tions [7]. It plays an important role in neural myelination, synaptogenesis and neuro-
transmitter synthesis [8]. Since the fetus is completely dependent on maternal nutrients,
inadequate vitamin B12 levels during pregnancy may impair these processes and cause
neural damage or brain atrophy [9,10]. Experimental rodent studies have shown a link
between maternal folate and vitamin B12 deﬁciency with structural brain abnormalities [11],
alteration in gene expression in the cerebellum [12,13] and cognitive impairment in off-
spring [14,15]. In humans, folate and vitamin B12 deﬁciency have been associated with

poor neurodevelopment [16] and negative effects on cognitive functions including mem-
ory, language and motor skills [17–19], preterm birth, low birth weight [20] and insulin
resistance [21].

As shown in Table S1, prior studies on maternal vitamin B12 and offspring ASD were
mainly focused on multivitamin or folate supplementation with inconsistent ﬁndings. Only
one study speciﬁcally examined the association between maternal plasma vitamin B12 and
offspring ASD [22]. The authors showed that high vitamin B12 levels (≥536.8 pmol/L)
increased the risk for offspring ASD. Of note, the study included only 86 ASD cases and
maternal blood samples were collected 24–72 h post-delivery. Four studies examined the
association between maternal plasma folate and offspring ASD or autistic traits, but the
ﬁndings were inconsistent [22–25]. Two of these studies, one from Sweden (N = 100) and
the other from the USA (N = 86) showed high levels of maternal plasma folate associated
with increased risk of ASD in offspring [22,24]. However, two other studies from the
Netherlands (N = 3893) and the USA (N = 209) did not observe any associations between
maternal folate concentration and child autistic traits [23,25]. The use of folate and/or
multivitamins early or during pregnancy showed no associations, increased or decreased
risk for ASD or ASD symptoms in offspring [26–37].

There is a lack of knowledge from the existing literature about the role of maternal vi-
tamin B12 as a possible risk factor for offspring ASD. First, no previous study has examined
maternal serum vitamin B12 levels during pregnancy and offspring risk for ASD diagnosis.
Previous studies on maternal vitamin B12 and offspring ASD were based on multivitamin
supplementation, and the composition of the multivitamins used during pregnancy was
unclear [26–37]. Second, out of three studies examining associations between maternal
folate concentrations during early pregnancy and offspring ASD [23–25], two studies were
based on ASD symptoms [23,25] and one study was on ASD diagnosis [24].

The aim of this population-based study was to examine the association between
maternal serum vitamin B12 levels in early pregnancy and the risk of ASD diagnosis in
offspring. In addition, we investigated the association between maternal serum vitamin
B12 levels in early pregnancy and speciﬁc ASD subtypes in the offspring. Based on the
ﬁndings of maternal folate and vitamin B12 deﬁciency associated with impaired cognitive
behavior in rodent offspring [14], we hypothesized that lower maternal vitamin B12 levels
would be associated with an increased risk of offspring ASD. This would have important
public health implications for preventative strategies. Since vitamin B12 is found in animal-
sourced foods, vitamin B12 deﬁciency has been widely prevalent in those with poor intake
of animal origin foods owing to the religious or cultural practice of vegetarianism [38]. This
could be readily preventable by supplementation.

2. Materials and Methods

The Finnish Prenatal Study of Autism Spectrum Disorders (FIPS-A) is a nested case-
control study including all singleton live births between 1987–2005 in Finland. Each child
was followed for the diagnosis of ASD to the end of 2015. The data for this study were
derived from three national registers: the Care Register for Health Care (CRHC), the Finnish
Medical Birth Register (FMBR) and the Finnish Population Register Centre (FCPR). These
registers are linked using personal identity codes that are issued at birth or on immigration
to all Finnish residents since 1964.

2.1. Nationwide Registers

The CRHC includes all public and private inpatient diagnoses since 1967 and all
outpatient diagnoses from specialized services since 1998. The diagnostic classiﬁcation in
Finland is based on the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD): ICD-8 from 1969 to
1986, ICD-9 from 1987 to 1995 and ICD-10 since 1996. A previous diagnostic validation
study of ASD has shown 96% speciﬁcity for childhood autism [39]. The FMBR contains
nationwide comprehensive data on all live births during the neonatal period up to 7 days
of age since 1987. The FCPR is a computerized national archive maintained by the Finnish

Nutrients 2023, 15, 2009

population center and local register ofﬁcers. It contains basic demographic information (for
example, name, personal identity codes, address, citizenship and native language, family
relations, date of birth and death (if applicable)) of current Finnish citizens and permanent
residents in Finland dating back to 1969. The FCPR was used to identify the controls and to
obtain information on the subjects’ parents and places of birth.

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and FIPS-A
received ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Southwest
Finland(Dnro number 24/007), the data protection authorities at the National Institute for
Health and Welfare and the Institutional Review Board of the New York State Psychiatric
Institute (5740). The study design and the request for biobank serum samples were ap-
proved by the responsible Biobank’s Scientiﬁc Committee (Biobank Borealis of Northern
Finland, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland) (BB_2017_1017).

2.2. Finnish Maternity Cohort

The Finnish Maternity Cohort of the Northern Finland Biobank Borealis (FMC) is a
nationwide serum bank that consists of approximately 2 million serum samples collected
during the ﬁrst and early second trimesters of pregnancy (5th to 95th percentile: months
2–4 of pregnancy) from over 950,000 women. After informed consent, the remaining serum
samples (one sample of 1–3 mL for each pregnancy) were stored at −25 ◦C in a protected
biorepository at the Biobank Borealis in Oulu, Finland and were available for scientiﬁc
research. All samples in the FMC were linked with offspring and other Finnish nationwide
registers by a unique personal identiﬁcation code that has been issued to each resident of
Finland since 1971.

2.3. Information on Cases and Controls

The ASD cases were born in Finland between January 1987 and December 2007
and were registered in the CRHC with ICD-10 (F84x) and ICD-9 (299x) diagnoses by
2015. Controls were singleton offspring born in Finland and without a diagnosis of ASD
or Intellectual disability (ID). Each case was matched with one control on date of birth
(+/−30 days), sex and place of birth. The controls were alive at the time of the diagnosis of
the matched cases. During 1987–2005, there were 4705 cases with diagnoses of childhood
autism, Asperger’s and PDD/NOS. In total, 1558 cases and 1558 matched controls were
included in the study. The subjects with ID were identiﬁed from CRHC with ICD codes:
ICD-10 (F70, F71, F72, F73, F78, and F79) and ICD-9 (317, 318.0, 318.1, 318.2, and 319).

2.4. Maternal Vitamin B12 Measurement

To examine maternal vitamin B12 levels in the prenatal sera, we measured active B12
(HoloTC, Holotranscobalamin) using a chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay
on the Architect i2000SR automatic immunoassay analyzer (Abbott Diagnostics). The
coefﬁcient of variation (mean ± SD) derived from repeated quality control samples included
in each set of daily assays was 4.7% in the control samples with high B12 levels (range
43.7–49.6 pmol/L) and 6.4% in those with low B12 levels (range 13.6–17.3 pmol/L).

2.5. Covariates

Potential confounders and mediators suggested to be associated with both maternal
vitamin B12 and ASD were selected [40–44]. The FMBR was used to obtain information on
the number of previous births, maternal socioeconomic status (SES), maternal age, maternal
smoking during pregnancy, gestational age, Apgar score at 1 min and weight for gestational
age. As smokers are known to have lower vitamin B12 levels [45,46], maternal smoking
during pregnancy was included in the covariate testing. Information on maternal and
paternal psychiatric diagnoses and maternal substance abuse diagnoses was obtained from
the CRHC. Maternal immigrant status was obtained from the FCPR, while gestational
week and season of blood draw were obtained from the FMC. The variables included
in the analysis were categorized as follows: maternal smoking (yes, no), previous births

Nutrients 2023, 15, 2009

(0, ≥1), history of maternal psychopathology (yes, no), history of paternal psychopathology
(yes, no), maternal SES (upper white collar, lower white collar, blue collar, others, missing),
history of maternal substance abuse (yes, no), gestational age (<37 years, ≥37 years), weight
for gestational age (<−2 SD, −2SD to +2SD, > + 2SD), maternal immigration status (yes,
no), season of blood collection (spring, summer, autumn, winter) and Apgar score (0–6, 7–8,
9–10). Detailed descriptions of covariates are given in Tables 1 and 2.

2.6. Statistical Analysis

Maternal vitamin B12 levels were initially examined as a continuous variable. Since
vitamin B12 levels had a skewed distribution, they were log-transformed before analysis.
We also examined maternal vitamin B12 levels categorized into quintiles. The cut-off of the
quintiles for case and control groups was based on the distribution of maternal vitamin
B12 levels in the control group, with the third quintile as the reference group. Continuous
potential confounders were tested with χ2, Student’s t and Fisher’s exact tests and/or
Pearson chi-square tests for categorical variables for the association with log-transformed
maternal vitamin B12 levels among controls. Potential confounders were then tested for
association with ASD using conditional logistic regression models for the matched sets.
The covariates were included in the adjusted models based on their association with both
the exposure and the outcome at p < 0.1.

The point and interval estimate of odds ratios (OR) were obtained by ﬁtting con-
ditional logistic regression models for matched pairs. Unadjusted ORs and adjusted
odds ratios (aORs) and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) were calculated separately for ASD
and 3 subgroups: childhood autism, Asperger’s and Pervasive Developmental Disorder
(PDD)/PDD-not otherwise speciﬁed (NOS). A sensitivity analysis was performed adjusting
for gestational age as it is a risk factor for ASD (Allen et al., 2020). Further sensitivity analy-
sis was performed additionally adjusting for maternal psychopathology, substance abuse,
and offspring gestational age to address prior evidence that maternal alcohol use affects
vitamin B12 and folate levels (Laufer et al., 2004). Additional analyses were performed
stratifying ASD with and without ID. Conditional logistic regression was used to test for
interactions between continuous maternal vitamin B12 and ASD by subgroups of ASD, sex,
timing of gestational week of blood draw and gestational age. Statistical signiﬁcance was
based on 2-sided p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 software
(SAS 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, N.C., USA).

3. Results

The study included 1558 ASD case-controlled pairs. The mean age of ASD diagnosis
for cases was 6.57 years (SD: 3.21, Range: 0–18 years). The median vitamin B12 level among
cases was 114.40 pmol/L, and it was 116.80 pmol/L among controls. The mean gestational
week of maternal blood draw was 10.79 weeks (SD 3.5) for cases and 10.10 weeks (SD 2.8)

for controls. The gender distribution was 19.5% female and 80.5% male in cases and
controls.

Among potential covariates in the study, gestational week of blood draw, maternal SES
and maternal immigration status were associated with maternal vitamin B12 levels among
controls with p < 0.1 (Table 1). Maternal age, gestational week of blood draw, previous births,
maternal psychopathology, paternal psychopathology, maternal SES, maternal substance
abuse, gestational age, weight for gestational age and Apgar score were associated with
offspring ASD with p < 0.1 (Table 2). Maternal SES and gestational week of blood draw were
associated with both maternal vitamin B12 levels and offspring ASD and were adjusted in
multivariable models.

Table 3 shows the log-transformed maternal serum vitamin B12 levels and offspring
ASD and their subcategories. Maternal serum vitamin B12 was not associated with offspring
ASD in either unadjusted (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77–1.06, p = 0.209) or adjusted analyses (aOR
0.94, 95% CI 0.79–1.10, p = 0.441). In a subsequent analysis of ASD subtypes, no signiﬁcant
associations were observed between maternal serum vitamin B12 levels and ASD subtypes
in unadjusted or adjusted analyses (Table 3).

Table 4 shows the distribution of maternal vitamin B12 levels in quintiles by case-
control status. A signiﬁcant association was observed between maternal vitamin B12 levels
in the highest quintile (≥81th percentile) and offspring childhood autism (aOR 1.59, 95% CI
1.06–2.41, p = 0.026) and the association was close to signiﬁcance in the lowest quintile (aOR
1.49, 95% CI 0.98–2.26, p = 0.064), relative to the third quintile (Figure 1). No signiﬁcant
association was observed between maternal vitamin B12 levels and ASD, the Asperger’s
subgroup or the PDD/PDD NOS subgroup.

In additional sensitivity analyses, we adjusted for offspring gestational age for the
association between log-transformed maternal serum vitamin B12 levels or measured
in quintiles, and offspring ASD and their subcategories. Furthermore, we additionally
adjusted for maternal psychopathology (history of psychopathology and substance abuse)
and gestational age (see Supplemental Tables S2 and S3). The ﬁndings were similar with
signiﬁcant association between childhood autism and maternal vitamin B12 in the highest
quintile in model I (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.06–2.42, p = 0.027) and in model II (aOR 1.75, 95% CI
1.14–2.67, p = 0.010). No signiﬁcant association was observed between maternal vitamin
B12 levels and ASD, the Asperger’s subgroup or the PDD/PDD NOS subgroup.

In further additional analysis, we stratiﬁed the sample by ASD with and without ID
and examined the association with maternal vitamin B12 levels. No signiﬁcant association
was observed between log-transformed maternal vitamin B12 levels and offspring ASD
with ID (aOR 1.06, 95% CI 0.69–1.64, p = 0.796) or without ID (aOR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77–1.10,
p = 0.369) (see Supplemental Table S4).

Discussion This is the first population-based study examining maternal vitamin B12 levels in prenatal sera in relation to ASD. We found high levels of maternal vitamin B12 (≥81th percentile) during early pregnancy associated with offspring childhood autism. These findings are consistent with the study by Raghavan et al. [22] of 86 ASD cases that showed vitamin B12 in the highest decile (≥90th percentile) was associated with an increased risk of ASD in offspring. However, maternal blood samples were collected 24–72 h post-deliv-ery. Furthermore, in the current study, low levels of maternal vitamin B12 (<20th percen-tile) during early pregnancy evidenced a statistical trend toward association with off-spring childhood autism. While interesting, this result should be interpreted with caution. One possible explanation for this finding could be that vitamin B12 follows Bertrand’s rule, as do other micronutrients [47]. Bertrand’s rule describes the dose–response curve for many micronutrients as non-monotonic, with benefits increasing with intake at low levels, then plateauing with optimal concentrations and finally, toxicity occurring at higher levels. However, it is important to note that these findings were observed only in childhood autism and we do not know of a specific mechanism that would produce this pattern of association. More studies are needed to confirm these associations.  We did not find any associations between maternal vitamin B12 levels in early preg-nancy and offspring Asperger’s syndrome or PDD/PDD-NOS. Since the etiology of ASD is multifactorial, different etiologic factors may have different levels of association with specific subgroups within the ASD spectrum. Of note, in a nested case-controlled study, maternal serum vitamin B12 levels in early pregnancy were not associated with offspring attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [48]. In a study by Brown et al. [49], high homo-cysteine levels (which are inversely related to vitamin B12, as well as folate) were associ-ated with an increased risk for schizophrenia among offspring.  Previous studies on humans and animal have shown that folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency during pregnancy can cause persistent changes in the offspring’s genome, and resulting in brain abnormalities that are associated with ASD [12,13,50]. The key develop-mental genes involved in neural pathways showed altered expression and impairment in many of the pathways that are linked to ASD [51,52]. Vitamin B12 also plays an important role in deoxyribonucleic acid methylation, cellular growth and differentiation [53,54]. However, very little is known about the role of maternal vitamin B12 on human brain development. While our findings are observational and do not address the mechanisms behind the association, we believe that a potential role for high levels of maternal vitamin Nutrients 2023, 15, 2009

and ASD (p = 0.492). We found no interaction between continuous maternal vitamin B12
and gestational week of blood draw (p = 0.437), and also no interaction was observed
between continuous maternal vitamin B12 and gestational age (p = 0.334).

4. Discussion

This is the ﬁrst population-based study examining maternal vitamin B12 levels in
prenatal sera in relation to ASD. We found high levels of maternal vitamin B12 (≥81th
percentile) during early pregnancy associated with offspring childhood autism. These
ﬁndings are consistent with the study by Raghavan et al. [22] of 86 ASD cases that showed
vitamin B12 in the highest decile (≥90th percentile) was associated with an increased risk of
ASD in offspring. However, maternal blood samples were collected 24–72 h post-delivery.
Furthermore, in the current study, low levels of maternal vitamin B12 (<20th percentile)
during early pregnancy evidenced a statistical trend toward association with offspring
childhood autism. While interesting, this result should be interpreted with caution. One
possible explanation for this ﬁnding could be that vitamin B12 follows Bertrand’s rule,
as do other micronutrients [47]. Bertrand’s rule describes the dose–response curve for
many micronutrients as non-monotonic, with beneﬁts increasing with intake at low levels,
then plateauing with optimal concentrations and ﬁnally, toxicity occurring at higher levels.
However, it is important to note that these ﬁndings were observed only in childhood autism
and we do not know of a speciﬁc mechanism that would produce this pattern of association.
More studies are needed to conﬁrm these associations.

We did not ﬁnd any associations between maternal vitamin B12 levels in early preg-
nancy and offspring Asperger’s syndrome or PDD/PDD-NOS. Since the etiology of ASD
is multifactorial, different etiologic factors may have different levels of association with
speciﬁc subgroups within the ASD spectrum. Of note, in a nested case-controlled study,
maternal serum vitamin B12 levels in early pregnancy were not associated with offspring
attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder [48]. In a study by Brown et al. [49], high homocys-
teine levels (which are inversely related to vitamin B12, as well as folate) were associated
with an increased risk for schizophrenia among offspring.

Previous studies on humans and animal have shown that folic acid and vitamin B12
deﬁciency during pregnancy can cause persistent changes in the offspring’s genome, and
resulting in brain abnormalities that are associated with ASD [12,13,50]. The key develop-
mental genes involved in neural pathways showed altered expression and impairment in
many of the pathways that are linked to ASD [51,52]. Vitamin B12 also plays an impor-
tant role in deoxyribonucleic acid methylation, cellular growth and differentiation [53,54].
However, very little is known about the role of maternal vitamin B12 on human brain
development. While our ﬁndings are observational and do not address the mechanisms
behind the association, we believe that a potential role for high levels of maternal vitamin
B12 may have some role in the etiology of childhood autism, the most severe phenotype of
ASD, and this deserves future research.

The strengths of this study include the use of archived biospecimens for the measure-
ment of maternal serum vitamin B12 during pregnancy, a large sample size and the capacity
to adjust for a large number of confounders. There are several limitations that should be
considered. First, ASD diagnoses included only children referred to specialized services
and are likely to represent the most severe ASD cases. The ﬁndings of the study will not
represent mild and moderate forms of ASD. Second, we did not measure neonatal vitamin
B12 levels. However, the maternal and neonatal serum levels of vitamin B12 have been
shown to signiﬁcantly correlate with one another [55–57]. Third, maternal vitamin B12
levels in this study were collected in the ﬁrst and early second trimesters of pregnancy.
The ﬁndings thus cannot be generalized to B12 levels occurring in later pregnancy. Fourth,
residual confounding by unmeasured factors (such as maternal body mass index, prenatal
vitamin supplementation or maternal medications during pregnancy) could be possible.

5. Conclusions

The present study revealed high maternal vitamin B12 levels (≥81th percentile) dur-
ing early pregnancy were associated with offspring childhood autism. The study raises
questions on the impact of very extremely elevated levels of maternal vitamin B12 levels on
early brain development. If these ﬁndings are conﬁrmed in future studies, it would indicate
that maternal vitamin B12 has speciﬁcity as an etiological factor for a severe form of ASD
and high maternal vitamin B12 levels have toxic effects on offspring. Further studies may
have potential for clinical relevance to identify optimal levels of maternal vitamin B12
supplementation during pregnancy.
