Abstract

Background: Research and clinical outcomes that matter to people with lived

experience can significantly differ from those outcomes studied by researchers. To
inform a future Cochrane review of suicide and self‐harm prevention interventions,

we aimed to work with young people with relevant lived experience to agree on

priority outcomes.

Design: Four participatory codesign workshops were completed across two sites

(New Zealand, United Kingdom) with 28 young people in total. We iteratively

adapted the methods over the course of the study.
Results: ‘Improved coping’ and ‘safer/more accepting environment to disclose’ were
the final top‐rated outcomes. ‘Reduction of self‐harm’ was considered a low priority

as it could be misleading, stigmatizing and was considered a secondary consequence

of other improvements. In contrast to typical research outcomes, young people

emphasized the diversity of experience, the dynamic nature of improvement and
holistic and asset‐based framing. Methodologically, dialogue using design materials

(personas) to thematically explore outcomes was effective in overcoming the initial

challenge of disparate quantitative ratings.

Discussion: The results will directly inform the development of a Cochrane review,

enabling identification of whether and how outcomes of most importance to young

people are measured in trials. Rather than producing discrete measurable outcomes

that could be easily added to the systematic review, the young people challenged the

academic conceptualization of outcomes, with implications for future evidence

synthesis and intervention research, and for future codesign.

Patient or Public Contribution: Young people with lived experience were

codesigners of the outcomes, and their feedback informed iterative changes to

the study methods.

who self‐harm using content analysis found that support from family
and friends could encourage them to stop self‐harm, and it appeared

(e.g., getting scholarships, becoming members of expert committees

trying to change. Self‐harm was described as ‘invisible’, a form of
‘silent suffering’. Fear of other's reactions was also often emphasized,

etc.). Although insightful, this tended to focus on the nature of the

interventions offered.

In terms of outcomes, contributors discussed capacity‐building

gains, such as improved knowledge/awareness about mental health,

and how negative reactions could make it unlikely for the young
people to seek help in the future: ‘stigma makes the anxiety worse’. ‘if

like increasing the skills of gatekeepers, such as teachers, as a way to

reduce stigma and discrimination.

All of the above occurred multiple times across the pretasks

The outcomes also reflected a perceived need for better ways to
deal with the distress that was considered to underly self‐harm.
Coping skills, particularly more specific skill‐based and behavioural
outcomes like ‘doing activities that they enjoy’, having decent and

reliable ways of distracting themselves and asking for help were also
highlighted. Contributors emphasized self‐care (as an indicator of
wellbeing) highlighting the significance of daily activities—exercise,

having a daily routine, getting enough sleep or maintaining hygiene.
Additionally, young people's beliefs about their own self—self‐
esteem/self‐worth/self‐love/self‐respect were strongly identified

were reviewed by the NZ team who agreed that these covered the

with mental health services).

young people did not differentiate between suicidal thoughts and
self‐harm when thinking about outcomes.

The consolidated list of outcomes from the two NZ workshops is

presented in Appendix S1. Although the votes were distributed

across a range of outcomes and the include/exclude list contained

overlapping items, it was nevertheless observed by the research team
that more outcomes in the must‐include list were framed as gains and

strengths rather than reductions or deficits, emphasizing the need to

focus on positive change.

2. UK workshops results

Although almost all the pretask responses referred to the
reduction of self‐harm in the future, the young people had often

caveated this to argue that reduction may not clearly indicate
‘feeling better’ (as was also found in the NZ workshops). In the

workshop, contributors explicitly said that they thought this
would be the most important to ‘others’, such as professionals

and researchers, but were keen to emphasize that it could be

misleading, as people may replace one behaviour with something

else and it underestimated that relapse or recurrence may be a

‘Activities’ was adapted to specifically refer to

Improved coping was seen as an asset that could
be supported and which would have long‐term
benefits for the young person. This included
not only coping with stressors (such as
relationship problems or school work) but also
coping with the self‐harm itself, or with
managing thoughts of self‐harm.

In the workshop, ‘Acceptance of family/peers’ was

elaborated to refer to an accepting
environment where young people would feel
safe to talk about self‐harm. The contributors
had discussed the isolation of self‐harm for
young people, due to their fears about how
others would react to it. An environment where
the experience and disclosure of self‐harm
were normalized would reflect a reduction in
this isolation and remove a barrier to help‐
seeking.

The original theme of ‘School support’ was partly
merged into ‘Acceptance’ as the discussion
showed the perceived importance in this theme
was of a supportive, accepting environment,
but also separated into ‘Peers and teachers
understanding of self‐harm’, as the young
people emphasized the potential for negative
reactions that could prevent young people from
seeking help. The young people felt teachers
specifically were not well equipped to deal with
young people who self‐harm. This new theme
(‘Peers and teachers understanding’) was kept
separate from ‘Acceptance’ by the young
people, to focus on the ways that negative
interactions with peers and teachers could be
detrimental.

‘increase in activities previously enjoyed’ due to
the young peoples' wish to focus on differences
between individuals. They did not want to
suggest that all young people should be judged
on doing particular activities or doing a specific
amount of activities, emphasizing that this
should consider individual preferences. The
contributors considered this separate to
‘coping’ (though overlapping) as it reflected a
sign of ‘things going well’ to do more positive
things, but coping referred specifically to how
young people managed when things are hard.

Contributors reported that if self‐harm was

functioning as a coping mechanism itself, it
would be wrong to expect people to stop
completely before they had learned other ways
of managing, and a reduction in self‐harm itself
may not mean that the factors responsible for
the self‐harm were reduced.

Coping being top‐ranked:

Coping is something empowering. It is something they

Coping was also described as something that could be individu-

individuals could use and that this allowed for different individuals to

have different strategies.

Safer environment being top‐ranked:

sites emphasized that all the outcomes could matter to different

people. This individual focus was in contrast to the focus of
reviews on population‐level and aggregate outcomes.

2. Dynamic nature of improvement: This underpinned the rejection of
‘reduction’ as an outcome. They also suggested it could have

negative impacts for young people, who might then see relapse as
a ‘failure’ rather than as a normal part of a recovery journey.
‘Relapse is common and doesn't erase progress’
‘Recovery isn't linear it's a big squiggle on the page’ (Pretask).
