Abstract

One of the largest determinants of client outcomes is the counselor who provides treatment.
Therapists often vary widely in effectiveness, even when delivering standardized manual-guided
treatment. In particular, the therapeutic skill of accurate empathy originally described by Carl
Rogers has been found to account for a meaningful proportion of variance in therapeutic alliance
and in addiction treatment outcomes. High-empathy counselors appear to have higher success
rates regardless of theoretical orientation. Low-empathy and confrontational counseling, in
contrast, has been associated with higher drop-out and relapse rates, weaker therapeutic alliance
and less client change. The authors propose emphasis on empathic listening skills as an evidence-
based practice in the hiring and training of counselors to improve outcomes and prevent harm in
addiction treatment.

In discussions regarding the merits of evidence-based addiction treatment, prominent
attention has focused on the effect of therapist variables on behavior change (Imel,
Wampold, & Miller, 2008; Morgenstern & McKay, 2007). Indeed, it appears that one of the
strongest determinants of clients’ outcomes in addiction treatment in particular is the
counselor to whom they happen to be assigned (Luborsky, McLellan, Diguer, Woody, &
Seligman, 1997; Luborsky, McLellan, Woody, O’Brien, & Auerbach, 1985; Kraus,
Castonguay, Boswell, Nordberg & Hayes, 2011; McLellan, Woody, Luborsky, & Goehl,
1988; Miller, Taylor, & West, 1980; Valle, 1981). Research consistently shows that
differences among therapists account for between 5 and 12% of the variance in a variety of
client outcomes, including substance use (Elliot et al., 2011) and that a better relationship
between the client and therapist is associated with higher levels of treatment engagement
and retention in substance abuse programs (Meier, Barrowclough & Donmall, 2005).
Empirically-based substance abuse interventions such as cognitive-behavioral treatment,
twelve-step facilitation and motivational interviewing rely at least in part on the
interpersonal skills of the provider for their impact, yet little research exists concerning
which skills or attributes contribute to variation in the quality of the therapeutic interaction.

Psychotherapy research generally has suggested that therapist differences may be
attributable in part to outlier counselors with unusually adverse or particularly good client
outcomes (Okiishi, Lambert, Nielsen, & Ogles, 2003; Shapiro, Firth-Cozens, & Stiles, 1989;
Wampold & Bolt, 2006). In the area of substance abuse treatment more particularly, at least
four studies have reported therapists with unusually poor client outcomes. In a multisite
clinical trial (Project MATCH Research Group, 1998), therapist differences were no longer
significant after removing one or two outliers in each treatment condition whose clients
showed particularly poor drinking outcomes. In a naturalistic experiment following the
resignation of two drug counselors, McLellan and colleagues (1988) randomly reassigned

their 62 cases to four other counselors. This allowed them to observe differences in
outcomes for these reassigned clients as a function of the new counselor to whom they had
been assigned. Relative to their functioning at the time of reassignment, the clients of three
of these counselors showed varying degrees of improvement on all measures, but a fourth
counselor’s caseload showed increased rates of drug-positive urines, methadone dosage, and
unemployment, and no reduction in arrests. In another clinical trial reported by this same
group, one of three therapists providing supportive-expressive therapy had clients whose
drug use on average increased during treatment, in contrast to significant improvement of
cases assigned to two other therapists delivering the same manual-guided treatment
(Luborsky et al., 1985). Finally, among clients randomly assigned to nine counselors
providing manual-guided behavioral self-control training, the rates of within-caseload
adverse outcomes ranged from zero to 75% (Miller, et al., 1980).

What may account for such differences in efficacy among therapists treating substance use
disorders? Reference is often made to common or nonspecific factors that influence outcome
regardless of the particular theoretical orientation of a therapist (Hubble, Duncan, & Miller,
1999; Wampold, 2001). Evidence points in particular to therapists’ interpersonal skills as a
predictor of outcome (Anderson, Ogles, Patterson, Lambert, & Vermeersch, 2009; Valle,
1981). Just how common such skills are among counselors is unclear, but it is evident at
least that they are not universal. If these “nonspecific” skills do indeed exert such a strong
influence on outcome, then it is important to specify, screen for, and teach them, rather than
viewing them as nuisance variables to be controlled (Morgenstern & McKay, 2007;
Norcross & Wampold, 2011).

A prominent candidate among the therapist skills described as “nonspecific” is that of
therapist empathy. The term empathy has many meanings, and it can be difficult to
differentiate it from other relationship elements such as acceptance and warmth (Elliot et al.,
2011). We know that clinician and client assessments of the quality of empathy in the same
session can differ, and that they may both diverge from the ratings of independent observers.
Usually, it is the client’s rating of their counselor’s empathy that is most predictive of
outcomes, with those of independent observers being less powerful but still useful (while
those of therapists about their own empathy have no relationship to outcome). This suggests
that raters may be capturing different dimensions of the construct of empathy or even
measuring different constructs entirely.

We are focusing here on what Carl Rogers and his students described as accurate empathy
(Rogers, 1959; Truax & Carkhuff, 1967). This is a specific therapeutic skill that includes a
commitment to understanding the client’s personal frame of reference and the ability to
convey this heard meaning back to the client via reflective listening. This perspective-taking
process encompasses the accurate understanding of both cognitive and emotional aspects of
the client’s experience as well as attunement to the unfolding experience of a client during a
treatment session (Elliot et al., 2011). Viewing empathy in this way has the advantage of
focusing on specific clinician behaviors (i.e. reflective listening) that can be measured
during treatment sessions, but it may underestimate the client’s contribution to it. Clinicians
are clearly different from each other in the amount of empathy they typically convey in
treatment sessions, but there are also differences within clinicians depending on client
characteristics (Carkhuff & Alexik, 1967). It may be easier to be empathic with some clients
than with others. Nevertheless, focusing on the clinician’s contribution to the empathic
process is important because it is clinicians, and not clients, who are tasked with improving
the quality of therapeutic interactions.

Counselor empathy is often described as a component of therapeutic alliance (Anderson et
al., 2009; Baldwin, Wampold & Imel, 2007;Horvath, De Re, Flückiger & Symonds, 2011)

and even a necessary ingredient (Boardman, Catley, Grobe, Little, & Ahluwalia, 2006;
Feller & Cottone, 2003; Hoaas, Lindholm, Berge, & Hagen, 2011; Meissner, 1996; Rogers,
1959). Baldwin et al. (2007) have demonstrated that the robust relationship between
therapeutic alliance and client outcomes is driven by therapist, and not client, variability in
the alliance construct. They note that improved treatment outcomes could be expected if
therapists were trained to develop and maintain strong alliances, including the capacity for
genuineness, empathy and unconditional positive regard. Similarly, the American
Psychological Association Task Force on Evidence-Based Therapy Relationships (Norcross
& Wampold, 2011) has designated empathy as an evidence-based element of the therapuetic
relationship and has recommended that training programs implement competence-based
criteria for educating practioners in relationship elements.

In addiction treatment more particularly, a review of brief interventions for problem
drinking similarly found that an empathic counseling style was a common component of
effective interventions (Bien, Miller, & Tonigan, 1993). In addition, five studies have
directly examined the specific relationship between client substance use outcomes and the
empathic skill level of individual therapists. Miller, Taylor and West (1980) randomly
assigned clients to nine counselors who all delivered manual-guided behavior therapy for
problem drinking. The therapists were also trained in reflective listening, and three
supervisors observed their sessions via one-way mirrors, rating their skillfulness in accurate
empathy using a scale developed for this purpose by Truax and Carkhuff (1967). After the
treatment phase but before examining outcome data, the supervisors independently rank-
ordered the nine counselors on their level of skill in accurate empathy, with good inter-rater
agreement. At six-month follow-up, the percentage of each counselor’s cases with positive
outcomes was computed. The correlation between therapists’ empathy rank and a behavioral
outcome measure – number of standard drinks consumed per week – was .r = 82, accounting
for two-thirds of the variance in client drinking at 6 months. At 12 months the relationship
was r = .72, accounting for half of the outcome variance. Even two years after treatment,
25% of outcome variance (r = .52) was still accounted for by therapist empathy (Miller &
Baca, 1983).

This study (Miller et al., 1980) also included a comparison group randomly assigned to be
sent home with a self-help manual (Miller & Muñoz, 2005) and encouraged to follow its
instructions, then return in 3 months for follow-up. No additional treatment was provided for
this group, and the percentage of positive outcomes for this “bibliotherapy” group (60%)
was similar to the average success rate for counselor-facilitated treatment using the same
behavioral approach (65%). This could lead to the conclusion that “therapists are no
different from self-help,” which on average was true, but five of the therapists – primarily
those with high empathic skills – had higher success rates than the self-help control group.
One showed the same outcome rate, and in the case of three lower-empathy therapists it
seems the client might have been better off going home with a good book.

Valle (1981) similarly rated the Rogerian interpersonal functioning of therapists in an
alcohol treatment program. Empathy was not measured separately from genuineness and
respect, but these therapist attributes tend to be highly intercorrelated (Elliot et al., 2011;
Moyers, Miller, & Hendrickson, 2005). With clients randomly assigned to counselors, Valle
compared the relapse rates for therapists who were high, medium, and low in Rogerian skills
(see Figure 1). At every follow-up point the risk for relapse was two to four times higher and
drinking days were at least four times higher for clients who had been treated by low-
functioning therapists. Using Valle’s rating system with a new sample of therapists, Saanio
(2002) likewise found that client drop-out from treatment was linked to therapists with lower
levels of Rogerian skills.

Three additional studies have examined the impact of therapist empathy and client substance
use by measuring the association between these two variables as they occur in ongoing
treatment, without an attempt to control empathy directly or randomly assign clients to
different therapists. All of these studies were prospective, with direct measurement of
counselors’ skill levels and documentation of client substance use outcomes. One study
explored the relationship between therapist characteristics and client drinking directly in a
large metropolitan addiction treatment center where clients received standardized cognitive
behavioral therapy (Ritter et al., 2002). Clients rated their therapist’s level of empathy,
congruence and unconditional regard using the Relationship Inventory, an assessment tool
based on the work of Carl Rogers and widely used in psychotherapy research. Clients also
rated the therapists’ level of expertness, trustworthiness and attractiveness. Drinking
outcomes were assessed 3 months after treatment in multiple dimensions, including the
number of negative consequences due to drinking, the degree of physical dependence and
the number of alcohol-related psychosocial problems experienced by the client. Both
therapist empathy and expertness were associated with improvements in client drinking
outcomes in multiple domains.

Pantalon, Chawarski, Falcioni, Pakes, and Schottenfeld (2004) measured therapist empathy
during community reinforcement approach treatment sessions for pregnant and postpartum
cocaine users. They used a behavioral rating system (Mechanisms of Action Rating Scale:
MARS) to capture frequency counts for the occurrence of therapist empathy and responses
to resistance during videotape reviews of sessions. Successful client outcome was defined as
urine-verified, continuous abstinence from cocaine for three consecutive weeks during
treatment. The authors found that therapists with higher rates of empathy had clients with
significantly lower rates of cocaine use. Similarly, there was a significant relationship
between more positive therapist skills in managing resistance and improved cocaine
abstinence for these women. Finally, Fiorentine & Hillhouse (1999) explored the impact of
therapist empathy within the context of treatment matching for gender and ethnic
characteristics in an outpatient treatment clinic. They measured counselor empathy with a 3
item scale completed by clients that was consistent with a Rogerian definition of empathy
(“My counselor understands me,” “My counselor realizes how my experiences feel to me,
“and “My counselor understands me even when I don’t express myself”). Outcomes were
assessed by categorizing clients as totally abstaining versus any drug use at all in the 6
months after treatment. Clients’ ratings of their counselor’s empathy were significantly
correlated with both treatment engagement and abstinence rates. Gender and ethnic
congruency, in contrast to counselor empathy, were not associated with higher rates of
abstinence in the follow up period.

To place these studies exploring the relationship between therapist empathy and substance
abuse outcomes in perspective, we computed effect sizes for each of the studies cited here,
where data were available and appropriate for conversion (Table 1). These findings are
consistent with a view of empathy as a moderately strong predictor of substance abuse
treatment outcomes, with considerable variability across studies. This relationship between
empathy and improved client outcomes, though intriguing, cannot be interpreted to mean
that empathy causes better client outcomes. Empathy might causing the improvements in
client outcome, but it is also possible that a third variable (for example, client motivation)
influences both therapist empathy and client outcomes. Randomized, controlled trials in
which empathy (or other interpersonal skills of the therapist) are manipulated have not been
conducted for both logistical and ethical reasons (Norcross & Wampold, 2011).
Nevertheless, the logic of randomized trials is such that the impact of therapist empathy
could be evaluated prospectively without having a treatment condition that is explicitly
empathic (Miller & Cooney, 1994). Such a secondary analysis could be conducted in any
prospective trial of psychotherapies so long as (1) clients are randomly assigned to

therapists, (2) there is a sufficiently large number of therapists treating ten or more clients
each, and varying in empathic skill level (Project MATCH Research Group, 1998), and (3)
reliable session-specific measures of therapist empathy are obtained. Under such conditions,
clients would in effect be randomized to different levels of therapist empathy, and a priori
hypotheses could be tested regarding a main effect of empathy and its interactions with
client characteristics (Longabaugh & Wirtz, 2001).

Empathy and Resistance

Authoritarian confrontation, the obverse of an empathic listening style, has rather
consistently been associated in clinical trials with no change or adverse outcomes in
addiction treatment (Boardman et al., 2006; Miller & Wilbourne, 2002; White & Miller,
2007). In one study, a single in-session therapist behavior predicted 42% of the variance in
clients’ 12-month drinking outcomes: the more the therapist confronted, the more the client
drank (Miller, Benefield, & Tonigan, 1993). It appears that, consistent with Rogers’
assertions, providing an accepting and empathic therapeutic style facilitates therapeutic
relationship and positive change, whereas a confrontational style does not.

In a classic study, Patterson and Forgatch (1985) used an ABAB design to evaluate the
impact of two contrasting counseling styles: one that emphasized providing information
(Teach) and advice (Direct), and one that focused on reflective listening. Within client
sessions, the same therapists alternated between these styles on signal every 12 minutes.
Client resistance during the session was measured via a reliable behavioral rating system
(Chamberlain, Patterson, Reid, Kavanagh, & Forgatch, 1984). Client resistance increased
and decreased as a step function in response to counseling style. Teach/Direct increased
client resistance by 70% in contrast to empathic listening. Resistance dropped back down
with resumed listening and jumped back up with a return to Teach/Direct.

An empathic approach may lower resistance to potentially threatening material (Campbell &
Babrow, 2004). In a randomized trial comparing therapist styles with problem drinkers
receiving feedback regarding the severity of alcohol-related assessment results, client
resistance responses were 70% higher with directive as compared to client-centered
counseling (Miller et al., 1993).

Can Counselors Be Pre-screened for Empathy?

It appears that therapist empathy can predict meaningful proportions of variance in addiction
treatment outcome (e.g., Miller et al., 1993; Valle, 1981) that are an order of magnitude
larger than the between-treatment differences typically observed in clinical trials (Imel et al.,
2008) and typically fall within the range of what addiction treatment providers regard to be a
clinically meaningful effect (Miller & Manuel, 2008). In psychotherapy research more
generally, therapist empathy may account for as much or more outcome variance than
therapeutic alliance or specific intervention (Bohart, Elliot, Greenberg & Watson, 2002;
Imel, Wampold & Miller, 2008). It could be argued that providing accurate empathy in
addiction treatment is an evidence-based practice regardless of theoretical orientation and
that its absence will reduce the likelihood that clients will change their substance use.

Is it possible to pre-screen therapists for accurate empathy? We know of no paper-and-pencil
measure to do this reliably. Even a measure that directly elicits reflective listening
statements in writing (Miller, Hedrick, & Orlofsky, 1991) is no guarantee that clinicians
actually do this in practice. Clinician self-descriptions of their own listening skills are
simply unrelated to actual skillfulness as rated from practice samples (Miller, Yahne,
Moyers, Martinez, & Pirritano, 2004). It is possible, however, to observe directly a
counselor’s ability in empathic listening during the hiring process. Just such a procedure was

utilized in the Combine study, which employed 40 therapists to deliver a state of the art
behavioral treatment for alcohol dependence that relied heavily on motivational
interviewing, and thus on empathic listening skills. Faced with the need to quickly recruit
and rigorously train therapists in a complex treatment, we decided to pre-screen therapist
candidates for empathic listening skills. We developed a procedure in which candidates
submitted a work sample of themselves facilitating a discussion with another person
speaking on one of two topics: “what it was like growing up in my home,” or “how I came
to work in this field.” The length of the conversation was at least 20 minutes. The candidate
was told to listen empathically without trying to solve problems or give advice. These work
samples were then reviewed using a rudimentary coding system to quantify open and closed
questions, simple and complex reflections, and confrontations. Counselors with a ratio of at
least 1:1 for reflections and questions (that is, at least one reflection for every question)
earned a passing score, provided the questions were also at least 50% open questions.
Although this bar was low compared to the expertise expected for the actual trial (a 2:1 ratio
of reflections to questions is considered an expert level of MI practice) this screening
process helped to insure that clinicians recruited to deliver the combined behavioral
intervention (Longabaugh, Zweben, LoCastro, & Miller, 2005; Miller, 2004) in this study
were equipped with foundational skills to learn quickly and deliver the treatment well. Of 68
candidates submitting work samples for review, 47 (69%) received a passing score at the
first submission. After another attempt, an additional 10 candidates were approved, with 11
(16%) never meeting criteria for hiring in the Combine study (Miller, Moyers, Arciniega,
Ernst, & Forcehimes, 2005).

Would Empathy Screening at Hiring Be Related to Counselor Performance

Later?

Is there any evidence to support the idea that pre-screening for empathy would lead to higher
levels of empathy in later counselor functioning? Although there are no prospective hiring
studies to address this question, our own training research yields an interesting analog. We
conducted two randomized, controlled trials to train substance clinicians in the use of
motivational interviewing (Miller et al., 2004; Moyers, Martin, Houck, Christopher &
Tonigan, 2009). In both studies clinicians 1) submitted a baseline tape of themselves doing
substance disorder treatment in their usual fashion, 2) then received training in motivational
interviewing, and 3) then submitted work samples of themselves using MI with actual
substance disorder clients at 4, 8 and 12 months afterward. All of these samples were coded
using an objective rating system measuring therapeutic empathy as a global characteristic on
the same 7 point Likert scale (Miller, Moyers, Ernst & Amhrein, 2003; Moyers, Martin,
Manuel, Hendrickson & Miller, 2005). This allowed us to compare the clinicians’ baseline
levels of empathy (before training and without their knowing what characteristics or skills
we were measuring) with those that were observed later. The results of both of these studies
have been published showing substantial training effects with and without various forms of
training enrichment such as consultation and feedback. To address the question of whether
empathy pre-screening might predict later counselor performance, we performed new
analyses of clinician scores on the global empathy ratings scale (n= 207). To simulate an
employment “pre-screening” we selected clinicians who scored a 6 or 7 on the empathy
measure (“successful applicants”, n= 32) and those who scored a 1 or 2 (“unsuccessful
applicants”, n= 30). We then used regression analyses to predict empathy ratings at the 4
month follow up point and found that “pre-employment screening” empathy ratings were a
significant predictor of clinician empathy in later therapy sessions (β = 1.49, p < .001, 95%
CI (.75, 2.2), R2 = .270, F(1,44) = 16.3). It is worth noting that these sessions were gathered
from a variety of settings including hospitals, primary care clinics, addiction treatment
offices, methadone clinics, domestic violence programs and employment screening

programs. All of the tapes were rated by coders who were masked to the time point they
were coding, and published reliabilities for the global ratings were generally in the good to
excellent range. These data support the proposition that even a relatively gross sorting of
clinicians into a pass or fail category regarding their baseline empathy skills will predict
later performance in actual treatment sessions.

A Modest Proposal

From the evidence to date, it appears that empathy is a reliable predictor of counselors’
success in treating at least alcohol use disorders. In fact, empathy may exert a larger effect in
addiction treatment than has been generally true in psychotherapy, accounting in some
studies for a majority of variance in client outcomes (e.g., Miller et al., 1993; Valle, 1981).
Najavits and Weiss (1994) observed that in addiction treatment, outcome differences among
therapists may be larger than those in psychotherapy more generally. Why would this be so?
One possibility is that historically in American addiction treatment, low-empathy
confrontational counseling has not only been an acceptable therapeutic style, but has at
times been lauded as essential (Janzen, 2001). Tactics such as shaming and demeaning,
head-shaving, sarcasm, shouting insults in a client’s face, and “attack therapy” (Yablonsky,
1965), all of which were once regarded as acceptable if not essential in addiction treatment,
would be unusual if not outright malpractice in the treatment of virtually any other mental
disorder. Use of such practices continues, though no longer representative of addiction
treatment, and this legacy has probably contributed to broader variance in provider empathy
in this field than would be true in behavioral health more generally. Whenever the range of a
variable is restricted its predictive power tends to be diminished. For example, whereas
Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores do predict the ability of applicants to function
in post-graduate training (Kunzel & Hezlett, 2007), they are less powerful in predicting
grades once students have been admitted to graduate school and the range of GRE scores is
compressed. If empathy is an important determinant of treatment outcomes and if addiction
treatment providers manifest a wider range of empathic skills relative to psychotherapists,
then empathy would be expected to be a more robust predictor of outcomes in addiction
treatment than in psychotherapy more generally, precisely because of the presence of more
low-empathy counselors.

Outlier therapists with outstandingly poor client outcomes are often found in addiction
treatment studies (Luborsky et al., 1985; McLellan et al., 1988; Miller et al., 1980; Project
MATCH Research Group, 1998; Valle, 1981). Available evidence links implicates low
empathic skill as a marker of this outlier status (Miller et al., 1980; Valle, 1981). From the
ethical minimum of “First, do no harm,” it is reasonable to screen for and teach accurate
empathy as a key therapeutic skill regardless of theoretical orientation (Norcross &
Wampold, 2011). We know of no therapeutic approach where low empathy has been linked
to better outcomes in any area of health care. It is both possible and ethically sensible to
screen potential providers of addiction treatment services for skillfulness in accurate
empathy as an important general factor impacting client outcomes. Of “evidence-based
practices” currently being promoted, this seems to us to be one of the most promising to
improve outcomes and prevent harm in addiction treatment. In contrast to the notion that

treatment that merits both scientific investigation and greater emphasis in treatment
endeavors.
