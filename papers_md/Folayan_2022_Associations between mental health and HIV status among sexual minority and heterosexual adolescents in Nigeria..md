ABSTRACT
Background  We aimed to determine associations 
between the mental health status of adolescents by self- 
reported sexual identity; and to determine associations 
between the mental health status of sexual minority 
adolescents living with and without HIV.
Methods  This cross- sectional study collected data from 
Nigerians aged 13–19 years old using an online survey. 
We collected information on dependent (sexual identity) 
and independent (presence of depressive symptoms, 
generalised anxiety disorder, suicidal attempt/ideation, HIV 
status) study variables. A multivariate regression model 
determined associations between the dependent and 
independent variables. A second multivariate regression 
model was developed to establish associations between 
HIV status among sexual minority individuals and the 
dependent variables. All models were adjusted for age, sex 
assigned at birth and education level.
Results  Among 1247 respondents living in Nigeria, 497 
(39.9%) identified as sexual minority individuals. Compared 
with their heterosexual peers, sexual minority adolescents 
had significantly higher odds of reporting depressive 
symptoms (adjusted OR (AOR): 5.54; 95% CI: 4.10 to 7.47; 
p<0.001), high general anxiety (AOR: 3.56; 95% CI: 2.64 
to 4.79; p<0.001) and history of suicidal attempt/ideation 
(AOR: 2.95; 95% CI: 2.20 to 3.94; p<0.001). Sexual 
minority adolescents living with HIV had significantly higher 
odds of high general anxiety (AOR: 2.42; 95% CI: 1.21 
to 4.84; p=0.013), while those with unknown HIV status 
had significantly higher odds of depressive symptoms 
(AOR: 3.82, 95% CI: 2.78 to 5.27; p<0.001), high general 
anxiety (AOR: 3.09; 95% CI: 2.29 to 4.17; p<0.001) and 
suicidal attempt/ideation (AOR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.24; 
p=0.001).
Conclusion  Sexual minority adolescents reported poorer 
mental health status than heterosexual adolescents. 
Although there was no significant difference in the mental 
health status of sexual minority adolescents living and not 
living with HIV, sexual minority adolescents with unknown 
HIV status reported worse mental health than their HIV- 
negative peers. Sexual minority adolescents in Nigeria 
need comprehensive rights- based care that improves 
access to mental health services, and those with unknown 
HIV status may need both HIV and mental health screening 
and care.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
 ⇒ Sexual minority individuals have a higher risk of poor 
mental health outcomes when compared with het-
erosexual individuals.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
 ⇒ Sexual minority adolescents in Nigeria also have a 
significantly higher risk of poor mental health com-
pared with heterosexual adolescents.

 ⇒ Among  sexual  minority  adolescents,  HIV- positive 
status  was  associated  with  higher  risk  of  anxiety, 
while unknown HIV status was associated with high-
er risk of depressive symptoms, anxiety and suicidal 
ideation.

HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, 
PRACTICE OR POLICY
 ⇒ Providers  of  adolescent  health  services  in  Nigeria 
need  to  prioritize  and  address  the  mental  health 
needs  of  sexual  minority  individuals,  especially 
those living with HIV and with unknown HIV status.

INTRODUCTION
Mental  health  is  a  major  public  health 
concern  in  Nigeria,  and  few  studies  have 
been  conducted  among  populations  most 
vulnerable  to  mental  health  challenges.1  In 
parts  of  Nigeria,  the  prevalence  of  depres-
sive  symptoms,  generalised  anxiety  and 
combined  depression/generalised  anxiety 
are  5.5%,  3.5%  and  1.2%,  respectively,  and 
20.9%  of  all  cases  of  depressive  symptoms 
have  comorbidity  with  generalised  anxiety.2 
The  national  prevalence  of  depressive  symp-
toms  among  Nigerian  adults  was  estimated 
at 3.1% and 1.1% for lifetime and 12- month 
periods,  respectively;  however  similar  data 
among adolescents in the general population 
is scarce .3

The  prevalence  of  mental  health  disor-
ders is higher among vulnerable and stigma-
tised populations in Nigeria. The prevalence

rates  of  depressive  symptoms  among  people  living  with 
HIV  attending  outpatient  clinics  in  Nigeria  range  from 
23.1%4  to  39.6%.5  The  prevalence  of  depressive  symp-
toms  was  16%  among  sexual  minority  undergraduate 
university students6 and range between 16.3%7 to 21.2%8 
and 44.2%9 among adolescents in secondary school. The 
prevalence  of  general  anxiety  disorders  among  people 
living with HIV attending outpatient clinic was reported 
as 32.6%,5 15.8% for men who have sex with men10 and 
23% for adolescents.11 Also, available studies report the 
prevalence of suicidal ideation among people living with 
HIV in Nigeria at 13.6%,12 30.5% for sexual minorities,13 
and for adolescents, between 6.1% 14 and 14.9%15 .

Negative  societal  attitudes  towards  mental  illness  and 
limited  access  to  mental  healthcare  increase  the  risk  of 
poor  mental  health  outcomes  for  persons  with  mental 
health  problems  in  Nigeria.  An  estimated  80%  of  indi-
viduals  with  serious  mental  health  needs  in  Nigeria 
cannot  access  care,16  and  only  16.9%  of  people  with  a 
major depressive episode in 12 months access treatment.3 
Access  of  sexual  minority  individuals  to  treatment  may 
be  poor,  as  prior  experiences  of  social  stigma  resulting 
from homophobia, discrimination, family rejection, feel-
ings  of  social  isolation  and  victimisation,  and  human 
rights violations increase the risk of psychological distress 
and mental health problems.17 In addition, experienced 
social  stigma  and  the  criminalisation  of  same  sex  iden-
tity generate the perceptions of feeling unsafe, which in 
turn  decrease  willingness  to  seek  support  from  general 
health facilities.18 19 This includes uptake of HIV preven-
tion,  testing  and  care  services,  thereby  contributing  to 
increased vulnerability to HIV infection.20 The prevalence 
of HIV among sexual minorities in Nigeria is extremely 
high, ranging from 11% to 35% compared with 3.6% in 
the general population.21

In  addition,  psychological  stress  and  mental  health 
problems mediate the relationship between stress related 
to  their  minority  status  among  sexual  minority  individ-
uals (minority stress) and HIV risk,22 such as multiple and 
concurrent sexual partners.23 The experience of chronic, 
intense social deprivation may also lead to the adoption 
of a range of behaviours and norms in an effort to create 
safe spaces without the fear of persecution. These norms 
include  suppressing  or  concealing  sexual  identity  and 
HIV  status,  resorting  to  social  isolation  and/or  living  a 
life disconnected from natal societies.24 25 The psycholog-
ical  stress  resulting  from  the  adoption  of  these  survival 
behaviours,  and  attempts  to  comply  with  and  adapt  to 
societal standards, have effects on both mental and phys-
ical well- being.26 27

A  few  studies  have  explored  the  mental  health  of 
sexual  minority  individuals  in  Nigeria  or  made  such 
comparisons  with  heterosexual  populations.19  22  28  No 
such  studies  have  conducted  these  investigations  exclu-
sively with adolescent sexual minority individuals, neither 
has this been explored in the context of living with HIV.

individuals  and  their  relationship  to  sexual  health  will 
be  instrumental  in  the  design  and  implementation  of 
impactful  differentiated  HIV  prevention  and  treatment 
services  for  this  vulnerable  population.  Therefore,  this 
study  was  designed  to  address  this  gap  in  research  by 
comparing  the  mental  health  status  of  sexual  minority 
versus heterosexual adolescents living in Nigeria, in the 
context  of  self- reported  HIV- positive  or  HIV- negative 
status. The conceptual framework adopted for this anal-
ysis  draws  from  the  work  of  Sayce,  29  who  argued  that 
social exclusion resulting from experiences of stigma and 
discrimination offers a powerful explanation for mental 
illness in a population because of the material and non- 
material disadvantages resulting from these experiences.
We  aimed  to  examine  the  relationship  between  the 
mental health status of adolescents, self- reported sexual 
identity  and  the  sexual  health  outcome  of  HIV  status. 
Specifically, we set out to determine associations between 
the mental health status of adolescents aged 13–19 years 
old  by  sexual  identity,  and  the  association  between  the 
mental health status of sexual minority adolescents living 
with and without HIV. It was hypothesised that the mental 
health (depression, general anxiety and suicidal attempt/
ideation)  status  of  adolescents  who  identified  as  sexual 
minority  individuals  would  be  less  healthy  than  that  of 
heterosexual  adolescents,  and  that  self- reported  mental 
health  status  of  sexual  minority  individuals  living  with 
HIV  will  be  poorer  in  comparison  with  those  reporting 
an HIV- negative status.

METHODS
Patient and public involvement
This  study  was  conceived  through  collaborative  efforts 
established  between  two  local  researchers  (MOF  and 
OO) and a non- governmental organisation (Total Health 
Empowerment  and  Development  Initiative  (THEDI)), 
to  assess  the  need  for  evidence- based  services  targeting 
adolescent clients with a high prevalence of mental health 
diagnoses. THEDI provides health services to marginal-
ised and vulnerable persons in Nigeria, including adoles-
cent  sexual  minority  individuals  who  identify  as  gay, 
lesbian and bisexual.30

Study design, setting and population
This  was  a  subanalysis  of  a  larger  dataset  collected  on 
the  general,  oral,  mental  and  sexual  health  of  adoles-
cents  and  young  adults  in  Nigeria.  This  cross- sectional 
study  recruited  participants  using  an  online  electronic 
survey  (SurveyMonkey)  disseminated  by  the  study  team 
and  accessible  to  participants  from  16  September  to 
31  October  2020.  Participants  aged  13  years  and  above 
were eligible to participate in the study. There were no 
other  exclusion  criteria.  Data  from  respondents  aged 
13–19 years  old  were  extracted  for  analysis.  Individuals 
who provided written informed consent for study partic-
ipation in line with the national ethics guidelines31 were 

Folayan MO, et al. BMJ Global Health 2022;7:e010231. doi:10.1136/bmjgh-2022-010231eligible to participate in the online survey and have their 
data included for analysis.

The online questionnaire was preceded by a brief intro-
duction  explaining  the  purpose  of  the  study,  assuring 
participants  of  the  voluntary  basis  of  participation  and 
confidentiality of their data. The questionnaire took an 
average of 15 min to complete and was administered in 
English  (English  is  the  unifying  national  language  in  a 
country with over 525 languages). Each participant could 
complete  a  single  questionnaire  on  their  device  only 
once, although they could edit their answers freely until 
they chose to submit.

Participant recruitment
The  study  adopted  a  respondent- driven  sampling 
approach.  Twenty- three  THEDI  peer  educators  and 
six  additional  study  staff  (UP,  NNM,  CM,  AG,  AAS  and 
CO) shared the survey link with their networks of sexual 
minority  and  heterosexual  individuals.  These  initial 
participants  were  encouraged  to  share  the  survey  link 
with their contacts. The recruitment was also augmented 
with  convenient  sampling.  The  survey  link  was  posted 
on social media (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) and 
network  email  lists  and  WhatsApp  groups.  Data  collec-
tion  was  supported  by  providing  an  open  link  in  the 
office of the non- governmental organisation and that of 
its partners, to enable target populations with low literacy 
fill  the  study  questionnaire  with  support  from  the  peer 
educators.

Data variables included in the analysis
Sociodemographic variables
Age  at  last  birthday  (in  years)  and  education  level 
completed  (no  formal  education,  primary,  secondary, 
university, postgraduate).

Independent variables
HIV status
The survey posed a single question on self- reported HIV 
status  with  responses  including  ‘positive’,  ‘negative’, 
‘do  not  know’  and  ‘prefer  not  to  report’.  Study  partici-
pants who preferred not to report their HIV status were 
excluded from the study (n=51). For the logistic regres-
sion,  participants  who  responded  ‘do  not  know’  were 
included in the analysis as a discrete response category, 
as  prior  research  has  demonstrated  that  the  profile  of 
HIV- unknown respondents differs distinctly from that of 
HIV- negative and HIV- positive self- report respondents.32

Sexual identity
Information  on  sexual 
identity  (heterosexual,  gay, 
lesbian,  bisexual,  prefer  not  to  say)  was  extracted  for 
this  analysis.  Sexual  minority  individuals  are  described 
here as participants who reported a sexual identity other 
than  heterosexual.  For  this  study,  we  clustered  all  types 
of sexual minorities into one, as they have similar mental 
health profile when compared with heterosexual individ-
uals.33

Dependent variables: mental health status
Depressive symptoms
The  Patient  Health  Questionnaire  is  a  nine- item  ques-
tionnaire  which  scores  each  of  the  nine  DSM- IV  (The 
Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders, 
Fourth  Edition)  criteria  for  diagnosing  depression.33 
Respondents  indicate  the  severity  of  symptoms  experi-
enced  in  the  preceding  2 weeks,  from  0  (not  at  all)  to 
3 (nearly every day). Possible scores range from 0 to 27, 
with  scores  of  0–4  indicating  no  depressive  symptoms, 
5–9: mild depressive symptoms, 10–14: moderate depres-
sive symptoms, 15–19: moderately severe depressive symp-
toms, and 20–27: severe depressive symptoms.34 It has a 
1- month test–retest reliability of 0.89 among young Nige-
rian adults.35 For the regression analysis, the scores were 
collapsed into two categories: absence (0–4) or presence 
(5 and above) of depressive symptoms.For this study, the 
Cronbach’s alpha was 0.93.

Generalised anxiety symptoms
The seven- item Generalised Anxiety Disorder- 7 (GAD- 7) 
scale was used to measure anxiety symptoms. The GAD- 7 
requires  participants  to  rate  how  often  they  have  been 
bothered by each of seven core anxiety symptoms, over 
the preceding 2 weeks. Response categories include ‘not 
at all’, ‘several days’, ‘more than half the days’ and ‘nearly 
every day’, scored as 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively, with a total 
score  ranging  from  0  to  21.  The  recommended  cut- off 
score of 10 or higher provides a sensitivity of 89% and a 
specificity of 82% to detect generalised anxiety disorder.36 
The scores were categorised into two: low (0–9) and high 
(10 and above) general anxiety. For this study, the Cron-
bach’s alpha was 0.91.

Suicidal behaviour assessment
Here,  we  used  the  Suicide  Behaviour  Questionnaire–
Revised  (SBQ- R).  This  four- item  tool  evaluates  the 
frequency  of  past,  and  likelihood  of  future  suicidal 
thoughts  and  behaviours,  with  responses  scored  on 
Likert scales.37 38 The tool had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.75 
among  patients  with  mental  disorders  in  an  outpatient 
setting.39 It has also been validated for use among under-
graduate students in Nigeria (Cronbach’s alpha 0.80).40 
For this study, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.84. Item 1 of 
the  SBQ- R  assessed  lifetime  suicide  ideation  or  suicide 
attempts by asking respondents: ‘Have you ever thought 
about or attempted to harm yourself?’ Responses to this 
question were dichotomised to ‘presence’ or ‘absence’ of 
suicidal attempt/ideation.

Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated as means and SDs or 
as frequencies and percentages. Two sets of multivariate 
regression  models  were  developed.  The  first  set  was  to 
determine the association between mental health status 
of adolescents 13–19 years old by sexual identity (hetero-
sexual vs sexual minority); and the second was to deter-
mine the association between the mental health status of

sexual minority adolescents living with and without HIV, 
and with unknown HIV status.

In  the  first  multivariate  regression  analyses,  the  inde-
pendent  variable  was  sexual  identity  (sexual  minority 
adolescents  compared  with  heterosexual  adolescents) 
and  the  dependent  variables  were  the  presence  of 
depressive symptoms, high generalised anxiety, a history 
of suicidal attempt/ideation (included in three separate 
logistic  regression  models).  The  second  set  of  multivar-
iate  regression  analyses  included  data  from  only  sexual 
minority  individuals.  The  independent  variable  was 
the  HIV  status  of  sexual  minority  individuals,  while  the 
outcome  variables  were  presence  of  depressive  symp-
toms,  high generalised anxiety and a  history  of  suicidal 
attempt/ideation  included  in  three  separate  logistic 
regression  models.  The  models  were  adjusted  for  age, 
sex assigned at birth and education level. ORs/regression 
coefficients  and  their  95%  CIs  were  calculated.  Explor-
atory  analyses  were  conducted  by  repeating  the  second 
set  of  multivariate  logistic  regressions  among  hetero-
sexual participants only. IBM SPSS software V.23 was used 
for statistical analysis. Significance was set at 5%.

RESULTS
Complete  data  from  1247  adolescent  participants  were 
extracted  for  analysis.  The  mean  age  of  study  partic-
ipants  was  17.10  (±1.61)  years.  In  this  cohort,  750 
(60.1%)  respondents  identified  as  heterosexual,  and 
497  (39.9%)  identified  as  sexual  minority  individuals, 
with  116  (23.3%),  293  (59.0%)  and  88  (17.7%)  of  this 
subgroup identifying as lesbian, gay and bisexual, respec-
tively. A total of 691 (55.4%) participants reported mild 
depressive  symptoms,  338  (27.1%)  reported  high  levels 
of general anxiety and 309 (24.8%) indicated a history of 
suicidal attempt/ideation (table 1). There were 41 partic-
ipants (3.3%) who self- reported as HIV positive.

Compared with those with no formal education, adoles-
cents who had completed primary education had signifi-
cantly lower odds of high general anxiety (adjusted OR 
(AOR): 0.39, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.91; p=0.029) and suicidal 
attempt/ideation  (AOR:  0.28,  95% CI:  1.13  to  0.64, 
p=0.002); similarly, those with tertiary education also had 
significantly  lower  odds  of  high  general  anxiety  (AOR: 
0.23, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.45; p<0.001) and suicidal attempt/
ideation (AOR 0.22: 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.40, p<0.001), but 
not depressive symptoms.

As shown in table 1, compared with their heterosexual 
peers, sexual minority individuals had significantly higher 
odds of depressive symptoms (AOR: 5.54, 95% CI: 4.10 to 
7.47, p<0.001), high general anxiety (AOR: 3.56, 95% CI: 
2.64  to  4.79,  p<0.001)  and  history  of  suicidal  attempt/
ideation  (AOR:  2.95,  95% CI:  2.20  to  3.94,  p<0.001). 
In  the  overall  cohort,  self- reported  HIV- positive  status 
among  adolescents  was  associated  with  increased  odds 
of  high  general  anxiety  (AOR:  2.42;  95% CI:1.21  to 
4.84;  p=0.013),  but  not  depression  or  suicidal  attempt/
ideation. Adolescents reporting an unknown HIV status

was associated with significantly higher odds of depressive 
symptoms  (AOR:  3.82,  95% CI:  2.78  to  5.27,  p<0.001), 
high  general  anxiety  (AOR:  3.09,  95% CI:  2.29  to  4.17, 
p<0.001)  and  a  history  of  suicidal  attempt/ideation 
(AOR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.24, p=0.001).

Table  2  shows  factors  associated  with  depression, 
general  anxiety  and  suicidal  attempt/ideation  among 
respondents  who  identified  as  sexual  minority  individ-
uals. Having an unknown HIV status was associated with 
significantly  higher  odds  of  experiencing  depressive 
symptoms (AOR: 3.11, 95% CI: 1.76 to 5.49, p<0.001) and 
high  general  anxiety  (AOR:  2.32,  95% CI:  1.55  to  3.48, 
p<0.001).  Compared  with  having  no  formal  education, 
receiving  tertiary  education  was  associated  with  signifi-
cantly  lower  odds  of  experiencing  depressive  symptoms 
(AOR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.40, p=0.001), high general 
anxiety  (AOR:  0.18,  95% CI:  0.08  to  0.41,  p<0.001)  and 
suicidal  attempt/ideation  (AOR:  0.16,  95% CI:  0.07 
to  0.37,  p<0.001).  Receiving  primary  education  (vs  no 
formal education) was associated with significantly lower 
odds of high general anxiety (AOR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.09 to 
0.83, p=0.023); those with secondary education had lower 
odds  of  suicidal  attempt/ideation  (AOR:  0.21,  95% CI: 
0.11 to 0.40, p<0.001).

Exploratory analyses among heterosexual participants 
showed  that,  like  sexual  minority  individuals,  unknown 
HIV  status  was  associated  with  an  increased  likelihood 
of  reporting  depressive  and  anxiety  symptoms  and  self- 
harm/suicidal  ideation  in  this  study.  The  adjusted  ORs 
were  comparable  in  these  latter  multivariate  models 
among  heterosexual  and  sexual  minority  participants, 
though  these  were  relatively  larger  in  sexual  minority 
individuals (see online supplemental table 1).

DISCUSSION
Our  findings  showed  that  when  compared  with  heter-
osexual  peers,  sexual  minority  adolescents  had  signifi-
cantly  higher  odds  of  reporting  depressive  symptoms, 
high  general  anxiety  and  history  of  suicidal  ideation. 
Among sexual minority adolescents, those with unknown 
HIV  status  had  significantly  higher  odds  of  reporting 
depressive  symptoms  and  generalised  anxiety  disorder. 
These findings partially support the hypotheses.

Findings  should  be  interpreted  in  light  of  the  study 
limitations. First, the online data collection process intro-
duces selection bias, as access to the internet varies widely 
by socioeconomic status and geographical location. This 
bias increases the risk of recruiting a sample of respon-
dents skewed to those who have higher education and/
or have access to internet- enabled smartphones. In addi-
tion,  the  use  of  non- probability  sampling  techniques—
convenient  and  respondent- driven  sampling—which 
have  a  high  degree  of  bias,  makes  it  difficult  to  draw 
statistically  significant  conclusions  from  study  results. 
The combination of a convenient and respondent- driven 
sampling  method,  however,  helped  to  obtain  a  more 
effective sample.41 In addition, the use of non- probability

sampling  allows  respondents  to  participate  in  a  survey 
that  they  are  interested  in  and  comfortable  answering 
questions to.42 43 Furthermore, this cross- sectional study 
does  not  reflect  context- related  changes  in  mental 
health status of study participants. There is also the risk 
of  receiving  socially  desirable  responses  on  questions 
about HIV status and sexual identity among respondents 
in  unsupportive  environments  like  Nigeria.  The  study, 
however,  included  a  sample  of  participants  drawn  from 
all the states in Nigeria thereby ensuring that the findings 
are nationally representative.

Our  study  is  likely  the  first  to  report  on  the  mental 
health  status  of  adolescents  in  Nigeria  in  the  context 
of  sexual  minority  and  HIV  status.  Much  of  the  prior 
research  on  the  mental  health  of  adolescent  sexual 
minority  individuals  has  focused  on  high- income  coun-
tries  outside  Africa.44–47  To  date,  the  few  studies  on  the 
mental  health  of  sexual  minority  individuals  in  Africa 
have been conducted largely among adults, with a focus 
on men who have sex with men48–53. A paucity of African 
studies  have  focused  on  adolescent  sexual  minority 
individuals.54–56

In our cohort of adolescents living in Nigeria, approxi-
mately one- third identified as sexual minority individuals. 
While this estimate may be exaggerated from participant 
sampling and the self- report method, there are no data 
available on the proportion of sexual minority individuals 
in Nigeria that may otherwise help with the weighting of 
these  data.  Nevertheless,  this  outcome  further  compels 
attention  to  the  mental  health  needs  and  protection 
of  the  human  rights  of  this  population.  Moreover, 
the  findings  indicate  that  sexual  minority  adolescents 
have  an  increased  risk  of  experiencing  mental  health 
distress (presence of depressive symptoms, high general 
anxiety and a history of suicidal attempt/ideation) when 
compared with their heterosexual counterparts.

Furthermore, previous studies have indicated that sexual 
minority adolescents are almost three times more likely to 
report suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms compared 
with  their  heterosexual  counterparts.57  Our  results  are 
in line with prior evidence. The current cohort of sexual 
minority adolescents in this study had almost three times 
greater  odds  of  suicidal  attempt/ideation,  which  is  more 
than three times higher odds of general anxiety and more

than five times higher odds of having depressive symptoms, 
when  compared  with  their  heterosexual  counterparts. 
Mental health disorders can emerge early in adolescence 
and  persist  into  adulthood  if  unaddressed,  leading  to 
disability- adjusted life years lost.17

The  risk  of  mental  health  problems  among  sexual 
minority  adolescents  in  Nigeria  may  not  only  be  due  to 
the minority stress they experience,19 but also social exclu-
sion  (restriction  in  full  participation  in  economic,  social, 
political and cultural life58) by the criminalisation of sexual 
minority individuals through the enacted 2013 Same Sex 
Marriage (Prohibition) Act. Though the Act is framed to 
discourage  same- sex  marriage,  it  is  often  used  to  justify 
unfair prosecution and harassment of sexual minorities in 
Nigeria. The ubiquitous application of the Act represents a 
stark exemplar of the cultural and political institutionalisa-
tion of such exclusion, which perpetuates barriers to sexual 
minority individuals accessing social, health and other rela-
tional and asset- based support in their communities.59 In 
addition, limitations in access to healthcare services due to 
parental  consent  requirements  further  complicate  issues 
for sexual minority adolescents.56 60–62

The  present  study  also  assessed  the  mental  health  of 
adolescents identifying as a sexual minority relative to their 
self- reported  HIV  status  as  an  indicator  of  their  sexual 
health.  Interestingly,  sexual  minority  adolescents  self- 
reporting HIV- positive status were not any different from 
their heterosexual peers with regard to depression, anxiety 
and suicidal ideation. On the other hand, self- reporting an 
unknown  HIV  status  was  associated  with  the  presence  of 
depressive symptoms and increased odds of high general 
anxiety,  when  compared  with  seronegative  peers.  These 
results may suggest that in addition to the mental distress 
associated with their sexual identity, adolescents in Nigeria 
who identify as sexual minority individuals incur another 
layer of mental distress related to uncertainty about their 
HIV status.

Several  considerations  may  explain  the  relationship 
between  unknown  HIV  status  and  mental  health  status 
among sexual minority adolescents. One consideration is 
that some sexual minority adolescents may have preferred 
responding  ‘unknown’  to  avoid  disclosing  their  (possibly 
positive) HIV status. In a different account, it may be that 
Nigerian  adolescents  with  a  marginalised  sexual  iden-
tity  experience  depression  and  anxiety  to  an  extent  that 
it  disrupts  their  uptake  of  HIV  testing  and  other  sexual 
health services, in addition to the restrictions that real or 
perceived  stigma  and  discrimination  the  health  system 
imposes. Regardless, given our findings and that of prior 
studies,  sexual  minority- inclusive  health  communication 
messaging  and  mental  health  interventions  should  be 
incorporated into adolescent health services, to maximise 
opportunities to achieve and maintain optimal sexual and 
mental health among sexual minority Nigerian adolescents.
Additionally,  we  found  that  adolescents  with  higher 
educational  status  (compared  with  no  formal  education) 
had  lower  odds  of  reporting  mental  health  challenges. 
Prior studies have associated higher educational status with 

BMJ Global Health

better mental health, by way of having a greater sense of 
agency,  increased  opportunities  for  upward  mobilisation 
and  fuller  integration  into  society  (as  opposed  to  social 
exclusion).63  This  suggests  that  access  to  opportunities 
for educational advancement may mitigate mental health 
distress  for  adolescents  in  Nigeria  and  may  have  an  even 
higher impact on mental health for sexual minority adoles-
cents. Nigeria has one of the highest rates of out- of- school 
children  globally.  One  in  every  five  of  the  world’s  out- of- 
school  children  is  in  Nigeria,  and  only  61%  of  children 
aged  6–11 years  old  regularly  attend  primary  school.64 
The  proportion  of  out- of- school  children  increases  from 
primary  to  tertiary  level—only  44.9%  of  the  ≥25- year- old 
population  completed  secondary  school  and  17.3% 
completed post- secondary education.65 Thus, interventions 
at the level of improving educational attainment present a 
formidable task and opportunity for improving the mental 
health  of  all  Nigerian  adolescents,  including  those  who 
identify as sexual minority individuals.

CONCLUSION
The  conditions  of  social  exclusion,  stigma  and  violations 
of the human rights of sexual minority individuals in Nige-
rian society are not benign, and are consequential to indi-
vidual well- being, and by extension, the well- being of Nige-
rian communities. Without the scale up of comprehensive 
interventions to address the mental health needs of adoles-
cents  in  Nigeria- including  increased  opportunities  for 
education, availability of trained providers and integrated, 
rights- based  sexual  and  mental  health  services-,  high- risk 
adolescents  transitioning  into  adulthood  may  be  more 
likely to experience both physical and sexual health prob-
lems resulting from unaddressed mental health challenges.

Ethics  approval  Ethical  approval  was  obtained  from  the  Health  Research  Ethics 
Committee of the Institute of Public Health at Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile- Ife, 
Nigeria (IPHOAU/12/1571). There was a waiver of parental consent for adolescents 
13–17 years old in view of the sensitivity to the issues of sexual identity in Nigeria 
and  the  non- intrusive  nature  of  the  study  in  line  with  the  national  guidelines  on 
sexual  and  reproductive  health  research  conduct  with  adolescents.  Participants 
were  required  to  provide  informed  consent  by  checking  a  box  to  indicate  their 
consent  to  participate  in  the  study  prior  to  completing  the  online  questionnaire. 
Those who indicated they were not willing to continue with the survey after reading 
the information sheet were exited from the survey and thanked for their interest. All 
data  were  irrevocably  anonymised. We  took  measures  to  prevent  the  unintended 
collection of internet protocol, the privacy of participants and the confidentiality of 
the information provided. Internet protocol addresses were instantly decoupled from 
the  questionnaire,  encrypted  and  deleted  at  the  end  of  the  online  survey  by  the 
survey tool. The questionnaire did not install any tracker cookies on the device of 
the respondents. The study was made available to the target population through a 
secure, sockets layer encrypted connection link. Data in transit (while responding 
online)  were  encrypted  using  transport  layer  security  cryptographic  protocols. 
SurveyMonkey  certified  its  compliance  with  the  EU- US  Privacy  Shield  Framework 
and Swiss- US Privacy Shield. Due to the anonymity given to participants and the 
IP  addresses  being  decoupled  and  encrypted  automatically  during  the  time  that 
the survey is online, there was no possibility to provide further direct information 
to participants after completion of the survey. All participants who completed the 
online survey were offered compensation for internet data of 100 naira, which is 
approximately US$0.27. Those interested in receiving compensation were requested 
to provide their phone number. A research team member (UP) was designated to 
upload  these  phone  numbers  with  the  internet  data  and  thereafter,  immediately 
destroy the phone numbers.
