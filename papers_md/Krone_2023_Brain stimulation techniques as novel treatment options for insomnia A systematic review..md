Summary

Despite the success of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and recent

advances in pharmacotherapy, many patients with insomnia do not sufficiently

respond to available treatments. This systematic review aims to present the state of

science regarding the use of brain stimulation approaches in treating insomnia. To

this end, we searched MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO from inception to 24 March

2023. We evaluated studies that compared conditions of active stimulation with a

control condition or group. Outcome measures included standardized insomnia ques-

tionnaires and/or polysomnography in adults with a clinical diagnosis of insomnia.

Our search identified 17 controlled trials that met inclusion criteria, and assessed a

total of 967 participants using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcra-

nial electric stimulation, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation or forehead

cooling. No trials using other techniques such as deep brain stimulation, vestibular

stimulation or auditory stimulation met the inclusion criteria. While several studies

report improvements of subjective and objective sleep parameters for different

repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial electric stimulation pro-

tocols, important methodological limitations and risk of bias limit their interpretabil-

ity. A forehead cooling study found no significant group differences in the primary

endpoints, but better sleep initiation in the active condition. Two transcutaneous

auricular vagus nerve stimulation trials found no superiority of active stimulation for

most outcome measures. Although modulating sleep through brain stimulation

appears feasible, gaps in the prevailing models of sleep physiology and insomnia

pathophysiology remain to be filled. Optimized stimulation protocols and proof of

superiority over reliable sham conditions are indispensable before brain stimulation

becomes a viable treatment option for insomnia.

Search results characterization

Our search yielded 1857 records (see Figure 1 for the PRISMA flow

(Motamedi et al., 2022; Saebipour et al., 2015) due to insufficient

blinding procedures or sham protocols. Most TMS studies (eight out
of nine) were shown to have a “high” risk of bias (Guo et al., 2023;

Jiang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022; Pu et al., 2023; Zhang

et al., 2018, 2022, 2023), mainly due to participants and assessors

being aware of the group allocation (non-blinded study design), a fail-

ure to report methods in sufficient detail or selectively reporting

results. The only remaining TMS study (Huang et al., 2018) and the
second taVNS study (Wu et al., 2022) raised “some concerns” regard-
