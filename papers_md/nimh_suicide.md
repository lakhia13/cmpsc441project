Suicide is a major public health concern. Suicide is among the leading causes of death in the United States. Based on recent mortality data, suicide in some populations is on the rise.

- Suicideis defined as death caused by self-directed injurious behavior with intent to die as a result of the behavior.

- Asuicide attemptis a self-directed, potentially injurious behavior with intent to die as a result of the behavior. A suicide attempt might not result in death or injury.

- Suicidal ideationrefers to thinking about, considering, or planning suicide.

## Suicide is One of the Leading Causes of Death in the United States


- According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WISQARS Leading Causes of Death Reports, in 2023:Suicide was the eleventh leading cause of death overall in the United States, claiming the lives of over 49,300 people.Suicide was the second leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10 and 34 and the fourth leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 35 and 44.There were over two times as many suicides (49,316) in the United States as there were homicides (22,830).

- Suicide was the eleventh leading cause of death overall in the United States, claiming the lives of over 49,300 people.

- Suicide was the second leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10 and 34 and the fourth leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 35 and 44.

- There were over two times as many suicides (49,316) in the United States as there were homicides (22,830).

Table 1 shows the eleven leading causes of death in the United States, and the number of deaths attributed to each cause. Data are shown for all ages and select age groups where suicide was one of the leading eleven causes of death in 2023. The data are based on death certificate information compiled by the CDC.

### Trends over Time


- Suicide rates are based on the number of people who have died by suicide per 100,000 population. The use of ‘age-adjusted’ rates allows for comparison of differences in population age distributions and changes in population size over time, including from one year to another year.

- Figure 1 shows age-adjusted suicide rates in the United States for each year from 2000 through 2023  for the total population, and for males and females separately.The total age-adjusted suicide rate in the United States increased 35.2% from 10.4 per 100,000 in 2000 to 14.2 per 100,000 in 2018, before declining to 13.9 per 100,000 in 2019 and declining again to 13.5 per 100,000 in 2020. The total age-adjusted suicide rate in the United States increased to 14.0 per 100,000 in 2021, increased again to 14.2 per 100,000 in 2022, and then decreased to 14.1 per 100,000 in 2023.In 2023, the suicide rate among males was nearly 4 times higher (22.8 per 100,000) than among females (5.9 per 100,000).

- The total age-adjusted suicide rate in the United States increased 35.2% from 10.4 per 100,000 in 2000 to 14.2 per 100,000 in 2018, before declining to 13.9 per 100,000 in 2019 and declining again to 13.5 per 100,000 in 2020. The total age-adjusted suicide rate in the United States increased to 14.0 per 100,000 in 2021, increased again to 14.2 per 100,000 in 2022, and then decreased to 14.1 per 100,000 in 2023.

- In 2023, the suicide rate among males was nearly 4 times higher (22.8 per 100,000) than among females (5.9 per 100,000).

- Crude suicide rate calculations take population size within subgroups in any given year or timeframe into account. They can be a useful tool for understanding the relative proportion of people affected within different demographic groups.

- Figure 2 shows the crude rates of suicide within sex and age categories in 2023.Among females, the suicide rate was highest for those aged 45-64 (8.6 per 100,000).Among males, the suicide rate was highest for those aged 75 and older (40.7 per 100,000).

- Among females, the suicide rate was highest for those aged 45-64 (8.6 per 100,000).

- Among males, the suicide rate was highest for those aged 75 and older (40.7 per 100,000).

- Figure 3 shows the age-adjusted rates of suicide for race and ethnicity groups in 2023 based on data from the CDC’sWISQARS Fatal Injury Data Visualization Tool.

- The rates of suicide were highest for American Indian/Alaskan Native, Non-Hispanic males (35.3 per 100,000), followed by White, Non-Hispanic males (28.0 per 100,000). Among females, the rates of suicide were highest for American Indian/Alaskan Native, Non-Hispanic females (12.4 per 100,000) and White, Non-Hispanic females (7.4 per 100,000).

*Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race; all other racial and ethnic groups are non-HispanicAI/AN = American Indian/Alaskan Native, PI = Pacific Islander


### Suicide Rates by State


- Just as state population numbers and age distributions vary, suicide rates can vary widely from state to state. Based on data from the CDCWISQARS Fatal Injury Data Visualization Tool, Figure 4 shows a map of the United States with each state’s age-adjusted suicide rate in 2023 indicated by color. This age adjustment of suicide rates allows for the comparison of states in a way that the age distribution differences between states do not affect the suicide rate.


## Suicide by Method

### Number of Suicide Deaths by Method


- Table 2 includes information on the total number of suicides for the most common methods.

- In 2023, firearms were the most common method used in suicide deaths in the United States, accounting for over half of all suicide deaths (27,300).

### Percent of Suicide Deaths by Method


- Figure 5 shows the percentages of suicide deaths by method among females and males in 2023. Among females, the most common methods of suicide were firearm (35.0%), poisoning (29.6%), and suffocation (25.9%). Among males, the most common methods of suicide were firearm (60.7%) followed by suffocation (24.0%).


## Suicide Thoughts and Behaviors Among U.S. Adults


Data in Figure 6, Figure 7, and Figure 8 are based on data from the2024 National Survey on Drug Use and Health(NSDUH)1by theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration(SAMHSA).

- Figure 6 shows that 5.5% of adults age 18 and older in the United States had serious thoughts about suicide in 2024.Among adults across all age groups, the prevalence of serious suicide thoughts was highest among young adults age 18-25 (12.6%).Among adults age 18 and older, the prevalence of serious suicide thoughts was highest among adults who identify with two or more races (10.7%).

- Among adults across all age groups, the prevalence of serious suicide thoughts was highest among young adults age 18-25 (12.6%).

- Among adults age 18 and older, the prevalence of serious suicide thoughts was highest among adults who identify with two or more races (10.7%).

* Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race; all other racial and ethnic groups are non-Hispanic.NH/OPI = Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander | AI/AN = American Indian / Alaskan Native

- Figure 7 shows that in 2024, 0.8% of adults age 18 and older in the United States report they attempted suicide in the past year.Among adults across all age groups, the prevalence of suicide attempt in the past year was highest among young adults age 18-25 years old (2.0%).Among adults age 18 and older, the prevalence of suicide attempts in the past year was highest among adults who identify with two or more races (1.9%).

- Among adults across all age groups, the prevalence of suicide attempt in the past year was highest among young adults age 18-25 years old (2.0%).

- Among adults age 18 and older, the prevalence of suicide attempts in the past year was highest among adults who identify with two or more races (1.9%).

* Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race; all other racial and ethnic groups are non-Hispanic.NH/OPI = Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander | AI/AN = American Indian / Alaskan Native

- Figure 8 shows that in 2024, 14.3 million adults age 18 or older reported having serious thoughts of suicide, and 2.2 million adults attempted suicide during the past year.

### Statistical Methods and Measurement Caveats


- NSDUH participants are representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized population age 12 years old or older residing within the United States.

- The survey covers residents of households (persons living in houses/townhouses, apartments, condominiums; civilians living in housing on military bases, etc.) and persons in non-institutional group quarters (for example: shelters, rooming/boarding houses, college dormitories, migratory workers' camps, and halfway houses).

- The survey does not cover persons who, for the entire year, had no fixed address (for example: persons experiencing homelessness and/or transient persons not in shelters); were on active military duty; or who resided in institutional group quarters (for example: correctional facilities and hospitals). The survey also does not include persons who are unable to complete the survey in either English or Spanish or persons who are not physically or mentally capable of completing the interview.

- A self-administered demographics section is included at the beginning of the questionnaire, and it includes questions about sex, Hispanic origin, and race that are used to create estimates for reports and tables.

Interview Response and Completion:

- The 2024 NSDUH continued the use of multimode data collection procedures (both in-person and virtual data collection) that were first implemented in the fourth quarter of the 2020 NSDUH. Overall, 39.8% of interviews were completed via the web, and 60.2% were completed in person. For comparison, more than half of interviews in 2021 (54.6%) were completed via the web. In 2024, the weighted response rates for household screening and for interviewing were 21.9% and 51.5%, respectively, for an overall response rate of 11.3% for people age 12 or older.

- In 2024, 47.9% of the selected NSDUH sample of people 18 or older did not complete the interview. This rate of non-response is lower than in 2021, but higher than in years 2020 and earlier.

- Reasons for non-response to interviewing include the following: refusal to participate (23.6%); respondent unavailable, never at home, or did not respond to the web survey (19.5%); and other reasons such as partially completed but unusable interviews, physically/mentally incapable or language barriers (4.8%).

- People with suicide behavior may disproportionately fall into these non-response categories. While NSDUH weighting includes non-response adjustments to reduce bias, these adjustments may not fully account for differential non-response by suicide behavior status. Prior to the 2020 NSDUH, this bias was deemed small and inconsequential due to low rates of item nonresponse and low prevalence estimates for outcomes imputed using the zero-fill method. With the increase in break-offs among adults in 2020 who completed the questionnaire via the web, the potential bias of this approach for handling missing data became of greater concern. Therefore, missing values in the variables associated with multiple outcomes, including for suicide thoughts and behaviors, were statistically imputed beginning in 2021.

- Given the use of multimode data collection procedures through the entirety of the collection year and the rate of non-response, comparison of estimates from the 2024 NSDUH with those from prior years must be made with caution.

Please see the2024 National Survey on Drug Use and Health Methodological Summary and Definitions reportfor further information on how these data were collected and calculated.
