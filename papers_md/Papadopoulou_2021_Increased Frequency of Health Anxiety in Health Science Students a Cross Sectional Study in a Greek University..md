to clinical knowledge, and it has been reported that they frequently develop worries and 

symptoms of illness. These observations had lead to the hypothesis that studying health 

sciences may increase the risk for developing health anxiety. Objective: To investigate the 

correlation between studying health sciences and health anxiety risk in students of a Greek 

university.  Methods:  A  cross-sectional  study  was  conducted  among  health  science  and 

non-health science students from the University of Thessaly, Greece. The 14 item - Short 

Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) was used to measure students’ health anxiety. Univariable 

and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to test the hypothesis. Results: 

The population sample consisted of 562 health science students and 204 agriculture and 

computer science students. The prevalence of health anxiety (SHAI score >14) was 18.1% 

(95% CI 15.4%-21.1%) while 8.3% (95% CI 6.4%-10.5%) of the participants suffered from 

clinical health anxiety (SHAI score >18). Health science students had higher SHAI scores 

compared  to  non-health  science  students.  Multivariable  analysis  revealed  an  increased 

risk for health anxiety in health science students (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.02-3.97, p=0.044). 

Health anxiety was also associated with sex (female) (p<0,008) and the presence of health 

anxiety  in  a  family  member  (p<0,001).  Conclusion: The  current  study  identified  studying 

health sciences as a determinant of health anxiety in students of a Greek university, after 

considering  several  confounding  factors. This  relatively  neglected  hypothesis  should  be 

further examined, preferably in a prospective cohort design.

1.  BACKGROUNd

Health anxiety is characterized by excessive worry or fear of a serious ill-
ness which is often based on a misjudgment of symptoms and bodily sensa-
tions (1). In clinical health anxiety, these fears and beliefs are extreme related 
to the actual degree of threat and can result in distress or significant impair-
ment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important 
areas  of  functioning.  Excessive  health  anxiety  has  been  described  with  the 
term “Hypochondriasis” which covers both disease conviction and fear of a 
serious disease (2). It can be part of another syndrome, such as depression, 
or a primary disorder as well. Several symptoms which vary between the pa-
tients have been mentioned: abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, 
dyspnea, tachycardia, vision disorders, muscle weakness or even dyspareunia 
(3). However, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th 
Edition (DSM-5), has replaced the term hypochondriasis with two new terms 
namely: Somatic Symptom Disorder and Illness Anxiety Disorder (4).

The hypothesis that the risk for developing health anxiety is increased in 
medical  students  is  old  and  its  formulation  was  based  on  clinical  teacher’s 
reports claiming that medical students frequently develop worries and symp-
toms of illness (5,6). Medical students experience a combination of stress and 
clinical  knowledge  which  may  cause  them  to  overestimate  the  importance 
of  insignificant  symptoms  and  bodily  sensations  leading  and  tend  to  diag-
nose themselves with the diseases they are studying (7,8). Moreover, medical 
training is a demanding and stressful process which may have adverse im-

pacts  on  the  student’s  mental  health  including  anxiety 
and depression (9). Health anxiety in medical students 
has been described with terms such as medical student‘s 
disease, hypochondriasis of medical students, and med-
ical studentitis (10).

The current state of knowledge regarding the associ-
ation  between  studying  health  sciences  and  the  preva-
lence  of  health  anxiety  is  far  from  conclusive.  The  in-
cidence  rate  of  hypochondriasis  has  been  found  to  be 
notably  high  among  health  science  students  although 
estimates vary due to heterogeneity of studies in regard 
to  used  instruments,  location,  education  systems  and 
other  factors  (11).  Few  analytical  epidemiology  stud-
ies  incorporating  comparison  groups  have  shown  an 
increased risk in health science students (12,13), while 
others report no association between field of study and 
prevalence of health anxiety (14,15). Furthermore some 
studies  report  a  protective  effect  of  medical  education 
on heath anxiety (16). To our knowledge, although the 
concept  of  the  so-called  “medicals  student’s  disease” 
exist, for many decades the published body of research 
studies on the topic is relatively poor. Regarding to Greek 
medical and other health sciences students there is un-
charted territory concerning health anxiety. Despite the 
controversial results of previous studies, the consolidat-
ed estimation of health anxiety prevalence in health sci-
ence  students  during  their  education  would  be  crucial 
for the identification and prevention of hypochondriac 
symptoms in this population because of their impact on 
their future clinical skills and performance. 

Objective
The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  if  there  is  a 
relation  between  studying  health  sciences  and  health 
anxiety risk. More over the study aimed to estimate the 
prevalence of health anxiety in Greek health science stu-
dents and to identify the potential determinants of hy-
pochondriac symptoms in students.

2.  MATERIALS ANd METHOdS

2.1 Design and Participants: A cross-sectional study 
was  conducted,  utilizing  self-reported,  fully  structured 
questionnaires  to  collect  information.  The  sampling 
method  used  was  that  of  convenience  sampling.  Dif-
ferent  departments  of  the  University  of  Thessaly  were 
chosen.  Departments  of  “Medicine”,  “Nursing”  and 
“Medical  Laboratories”  were  chosen  as  health-related 
studies departments, whereas departments of “Comput-
er Science and Telecommunications” and “Agricultural 
Engineering  Technologists”  were  chosen  as  a  control 
group.  Data  collection  was  carried  out  during  the  first 
week of December 2019, after obtained permission from 
the Internal Committee for Research Ethics of the Med-
icine Department of the University of Thessaly (date of 
approval 02/12/2019; protocol n. 64). The completion of 
the questionnaires was done by the participants them-
selves  after  informing  them  about  the  purpose  of  the 
research. All necessary clarifications were provided. The 
participation  of  the  students  was  voluntary  and  in  ac-
cordance  with  principles  and  ethical  rules  of  research. 
Students  of  all  the  semesters  of  each  department  were 

approached before lectures and each student was given 
10 minutes to complete the questionnaire, anonymously.
2.2  Questionnaires  and  measures:  The  question-
naire that was used for data collection consisted of two 
parts as follows:

A  form  of  individual  characteristics  of  the  students 
which 
included  socio-demographic  characteristics; 
studying characteristics, habits and performance; smok-
ing  and  alcohol  consumption  habits;  physical  exercise; 
presence of health anxiety in a family member and pres-
ence of a serious illness

The 14 item–Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) 
was  used  to  measure  health  anxiety  among  study  par-
ticipants. The SHAI is a self-reported questionnaire to 
detect  clinical  and  non-clinical  health  anxiety,  devel-
oped by Salkovskis et. al (17). Each one of the 14 items 
of the SHAI consists of a group of 4 statements, which 
are  scored  from  0  to  3  in  a  total  scale  range  between 
0-42.  Items  concerning  the  Negative  Consequences  of 
being  ill  were  not  included.  Based  on  the  SHAI  score, 
participants were characterized as normal (0-14), suffer-
ing from health anxiety (>14) and suffering from clinical 
(severe) health anxiety (>18) (18). In our study the Greek 
version of the Short Health Anxiety Inventory was used, 
which has shown good internal consistency in previous 
studies in Greek population (19).

2.3  Statistical  analysis:  The  statistical  analysis  was 
performed by using IBM SPSS Statistics V22.0 software. 
The  normality  of  the  distribution  of  quantitative  vari-
ables was determined by the Shapiro-Wilk test. For the 
quantitative variables, the median value and the corre-
sponding interquartile range (IQR) are presented. Krus-
kal-Wallis (> 2 groups) and Mann-Whitney criteria were 
used  to  determine  statistically  significant  differences 
between  subgroups.  Short  Health  Anxiety  scores  were 
compared  between  categories  of  independent  quali-
tative  variables.  Outcome  was  also  handled  as  a  quali-
tative  variable.  Separate  analyses  were  conducted  with 
two binary outcomes (health anxiety/normal [SHAI cut-
tof:14], clinical health anxiety/Non clinical health anxi-
ety [SHAI cuttof:17]). Univariable and multivariable lo-
gistic regression analyses were performed to determine 
risk factors. For logistic regression analysis all indepen-
dent variables were transformed to dichotomous, except 
age and year of studies which were examined as contin-
uous variables. Multivariable logistic regression analysis 
included all variables with a p<0.15 in univariable analy-
sis. Odds ratios, 95% CI, and p-values were presented for 
each risk factor included in the analysis. For all analyses 
a p-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Sample Characteristics
From the 801 students approached during the conduc-
tion of the study, 766 agreed to participate (response rate 
95.6%). No particular reason was given for non-partici-
pation. The population sample consisted of 340 medical 
students, 129 nursing students, 93 students of medical 
laboratories department, 127 students from the agricul-

Table 1. Characteristics of Study Participants According to department of Attendance

tural engineering department and 77 students from the 
computer science and telecommunications department. 
Mean age was 21 (SD: 3) for medical students, 23 (SD: 
7)  for  nursing  students,  22  (SD:  5)  for  medical  labora-
tories students, 21 (SD:5) for agricultural students and 
20 (SD:3) for computer science and telecommunications 
students.    Table  1  summarizes  the  key  characteristics 
of  the  population  sample.  Some  differences  in  several 
variables are observed.  Gender distribution was differ-
ent  between  schools  with  health  science  students  hav-
ing higher frequencies of female participants, especial-
ly  nursing  students  and  medical  laboratories  students. 
Health science students reported more frequently urban 
permanent  residence,  higher  parental  education  lev-
el  and  higher  family  income.  A  parameter  strongly  re-
lated  to  the  department  of  study  was  the  performance 
(average  grade)  on  the  completed  courses,  with  health 
science  student  having  better  performance.  Smoking 
habits, alcohol consumption and frequency of physical 
exercise  were  similar  among  participants  studying  dif-
ferent disciplines. Regarding the current year of studies 
it should be mentioned that studies in the Medical De-
partment have a duration of six years while the sample 
from  the  Department  of  Medical  Laboratories  did  not 
include freshmen since the department stopped accept-
ing new students in 2019.

Health  Anxiety  Scores  according  to  Participant’s 

Characteristics

Normality  test  for  Short  Health  Anxiety  Index  sco-
res  revealed  that  the  variable  is  not  normally  distribu-
ted among the population sample (Shapiro-Wilk test: p 
<0.001). Visual evaluation of the histogram showed that 
SHAI  scores  follow  a  right  skewed  distribution.    Me-
dian  SHAI  score  for  all  participants  was  9  (IQR  6-13), 
with  a  minimum  of  0  and  a  maximum  of  33.  Table  2 
presents the SHAI scores according to variables of inte-
rest and the p-values for association calculated by Mann 
Whitney  and  Kruskal-Wallis  tests.  Participants  of  all 
the health science departments had higher SHAI scores 
compared to agriculture and computer science students. 
Within  students  studying  health  sciences  the  analysis 
did  not  document  significant  correlation  with  the  de-
partment of study (Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.580) suggesting 
similar levels of anxiety in medical, nursing and medi-
cal laboratory students. The median SHAI score was 10 
(IQR: 7-14) for all health science students grouped to-
gether  and  7  (IQR:4-10)  for  students  from  the  control 
group. As shown in table 2, gender was also found to be 
significant correlated with health anxiety levels with fe-
males scoring higher on SHAI test (p<0,001). Increased 
health anxiety is also observed in students having better 
grades  (p<0,001),  those  who  reported  having  a  family

of  studies.  Linear  regression  analysis  to 
identify potential association between age 
and SHAI scores also did not reveal a sig-
nificant relationship (β= -0.013, p=0.730).
Association  between  prevalence  of 
health  anxiety  and  participant’s  char-
acteristics

The prevalence of health anxiety (SHAI 
score  >14)  was  18.1%  (95%  CI  15.4%-
21.1%) while an 8.3% (95% CI 6.4%-10.5%) 
of  the  participants  suffered  from  clinical 
health anxiety (SHAI score >18). The re-
lation  between  health  anxiety  and  po-
tential  risk  factors  was  examined  with 
regression  analyses.  Since  no  differences 
were  observed  in  SHAI  scores  between 
participants from different health science 
disciples, these individuals were grouped 
together  as  were  the  students  attending 
non-health science departments. Thus, all 
analyses presented in this section concern 
the comparison of health science student 
with non-health science students.

identify  risk  factors  revealed  significant 
correlations  between  the  risk  for  hav-
ing  health  anxiety  and  studying  health 
sciences  [OR:  2.67,  (95%  CI:  1.57-4.51), 
p<0.001].  Other  parameters  that  were 
statistically  associated  with  health  anxi-
ety  were  gender,  residence,  performance 
(grade),  and  presence  of  health  anxiety 
within  the  family.  More  detailed  results 
are  presented  in  Supplementary  table  1. 
Similarly,  when  the  determinants  for  the 
presence  of  clinical  health  anxiety  were 
assessed studying health sciences was also 
associated with increased risk [OR: 2.96, 
(95% CI: 1.32-6.62), p= 0.008]. Residence, 
presence of health anxiety within the fam-
ily and year of studies were also associat-
ed  with  increased  risk  (Supplementary 
table 2). Interestingly, the year of studies 
was  associated  only  with  clinical  health 
anxiety.  To  further  examine  if  this  asso-
ciation  is  affected  by  the  school  of  stud-
ies,  we  repeated  the  analysis  stratifying 
for school of study. The relation between 
year of studies and hypochondriasis prev-
alence  was  statistically  significant  only 
in  the  stratum  of  medical  students  [OR 
1.29  (95%  CI:  1.04-1.61),  p=0.022]  while 
in  other  strata  no  significant  association 
were found (data not shown).

To  control  for  potential  confounders 
logistic  regression  analy-
multivariate 
sis  was  conducted.  The  model  included 
all  variables  found  to  be  associated  with 
a  p<0.15.  An  exception  was  the  variable 
“average  grade”,  which  was  not  included 
in the analysis because it was very strong-
ly  correlated  to  studying  health  sciences 
[OR: 11,58 (95% CI: 7.50-17.89), p< 0.001], 
and thus its potential confounding effect 
could  not  be  controlled  since  the  vari-
able  were  not  independent.  In  the  analy-
sis  concerning  health  anxiety,  5  variables 
were  included  namely  gender,  studying 
health sciences, residence, family income and presence 
of  health  anxiety  in  family  environment.  Correspond-
ingly, six independent variables (gender, studying health 
sciences, residence, presence of health anxiety in family 
environment,  self-reported  serious  illness  and  year  of 
studies)  were  considered  in  the  multivariable  analysis 
concerning clinical health anxiety. In table 3 and table 
4 the results of the multivariate analysis are presented. 
Studying health sciences retains a statistically significant 
association  with  health  anxiety,  while  increased  risk  is 
also observed for clinical health anxiety but the associa-
tion was not statistically significant.

4.  dISCUSSION

The results of the current study support the hypothe-
sis that health science students are more likely to suffer 
from  health  anxiety  than  students  of  other  disciplines. 
This  increased  risk  was  observed  not  only  in  medical 
students,  but  also  in  nursing  and  medical  laboratory 
students.

Previous  studies  on  the  topic  have  produced  con-
flicting findings. Moss-Morris et. al (12), compared 92 
first‐year and 85 third‐year medical students to 82 law 
students and reported that medical students scored hi-
gher on disease perception and on disease distress. Afifi 
et al. (13), also reported higher fears of disease in medi-
cal students (n=195) compared to non-medical students 
(n=200), although caution is suggested since this finding 
was  not  statistically  significant.  However,  in  contrast 
to our findings, several studies suggest that there is not 
significant different prevalence of clinical health anxie-
ty (hypochondriasis) between medical and non-medical 
students.  Waterman  et.  al  report  no  significant  diffe-
rences in health anxiety between 103 medical students, 
107 non-medical students and 78 law students, all at the 
third year of studies (7). A larger cross sectional study of 
214  medical  students  and  816  law  students  concluded 
that  studying  medicine  does  not  seem  to  affect  health 
anxiety  levels  (14).  Similarly,  an  older  investigation  of 
60 medical and 60 law students reported no difference 
in the prevalence of hypochondriacal fears, beliefs, and 
attitudes  (20).  Furthermore,  there  are  studies  directly 
contradicting  the  examined  hypothesis.  A  cross  secti-
onal  study  consisting  of  449  medical  students  and  485 
non-medical students conducted in London, UK, repor-
ted that medical training reduces the risk of health an-

It is evident, that varying findings on the examined hy-
pothesis exist in the current literature, while our litera-
ture search identified relatively few studies. The results 
of  our  study  differ  from  the  majority  of  previous  rese-
arches. The reasons for this apparent disagreement can 
be sought in the heterogeneity of the published studies 
in terms of research methodology, psychometric scales 
used and control groups selected. Most of the previous

Increased Frequency of Health Anxiety in Health Science Students: a Cross Sectional Study in a Greek University

studies  incorporated  law  students  as  control  groups 
while  in  our  study  we  recruited  computer  science  and 
agricultural science students. Both approaches have li-
mitations and ideally, the control groups should consist 
of students representative of all non-health science stu-
dents.  Medical  and  law  students  may  share  some  per-
sonality  traits  that  could  be  associated  with  increased 
anxiety. Type A personality which has been associated 
with anxiety symptoms (22), is more prevalent in medi-
cal  students  (23). The  selection  of  individuals  studying 
computer  and  agricultural  sciences  as  a  control  group 
could also have introduced socioeconomic and life-style 
related confounders, other than the factors considered 
in  our  multivariable  analysis.  Moreover,  differences  in 
the  social-cultural  environment  in  the  study  settings 
could explain the different findings between studies.

In our study we measured health anxiety by using the 
Short Heath Anxiety Inventory a scale that been shown 
to  have  acceptable  Cronbach‘s  alpha  scores,  construct 
validity,  sensitivity  to  treatment  (24).  Caution  is  sug-
gested regarding the cutoff values used to define health 
anxiety  and  clinical  health  anxiety.  We  adopted  cutoff 
scores proposed by Rode et. al. (18), who report that “a 
cut-off point of 18 or higher in the short form reliably and 
exclusively identified people fulfilling DSM-IV diagnostic 
criteria  for  hypochondriasis”,  while  individuals  scoring 
15–17 “were three standard deviations above the norms 
for nonclinical controls”. However different cutoff values 
have been used by other research teams and cutoff va-
lues should be further investigated (24).

Our  results  also  suggest  an  increasing  risk  for  seve-
re health anxiety with years of study. The fact that this 
association was strong and statistically significant only 
in medical students is an additional element that under-
lies that studying medicine may play a role in the risk for 
developing health anxiety. Previous investigations have 
found higher health anxiety at entering the clinical ye-
ars and a decrease later (7,25). The results of the present 
study combined with the fact that the potential associ-
ation of studying health sciences with health anxiety is 
relatively uninvestigated, underline the need of further 
research on the topic. More specifically, in the current 
literature there is a lack of cohort studies recruiting stu-
dents at the beginning of their studies and prospective-
ly  record  the  incidence  of  health  anxiety.  This  type  of 
studies  will  clarify  if  the  effect  (health  anxiety)  occurs 
after the presumed cause (school of studies) and exclu-
de the possibility of reverse causality, which is a known 
limitation of cross-sectional designs. Additionally, more 
representative controls are needed and the diversity of 
findings from different setting should be further eluci-
dated.

5.  CONCLUSIONS

Concluding,  the  current  study  identified  studying 
health  sciences  as  a  determinant  of  health  anxiety  in 
students of a Greek university, after considering several 
confounding factors. This relatively neglected hypothe-
sis should be further examined.
