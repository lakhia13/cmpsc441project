Background

The workplace has potential as a setting through which large groups of people can be reached to encourage smoking cessation.

Objectives

1. To categorize workplace interventions for smoking cessation tested in controlled studies and to determine the extent to which they help
workers to stop smoking.
2. To collect and evaluate data on costs and cost effectiveness associated with workplace interventions.

Search methods

We  searched  the  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction  Group  Specialized  Register  (July  2013),  MEDLINE  (1966  -  July  2013),  EMBASE  (1985  -
June  2013),  and  PsycINFO  (to  June  2013),  amongst  others.  We  searched  abstracts  from  international  conferences  on  tobacco  and  the
bibliographies of identified studies and reviews for additional references.

Selection criteria

We selected interventions conducted in the workplace to promote smoking cessation. We included only randomized and quasi-randomized
controlled trials allocating individuals, workplaces, or companies to intervention or control conditions.

Data collection and analysis

One  author  extracted  information  relating  to  the  characteristics  and  content  of  all  kinds  of  interventions,  participants,  outcomes  and
methods of the studies, and a second author checked them. For this update we have conducted meta-analyses of the main interventions,
using the generic inverse variance method to generate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

Main results

We include 57 studies (61 comparisons) in this updated review. We found 31 studies of workplace interventions aimed at individual workers,
covering  group  therapy,  individual  counselling,  self-help  materials,  nicotine  replacement  therapy,  and  social  support,  and  30  studies
testing interventions applied to the workplace as a whole, i.e. environmental cues, incentives, and comprehensive programmes. The trials
were generally of moderate to high quality, with results that were consistent with those found in other settings. Group therapy programmes
(odds ratio (OR) for cessation 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 2.80; eight trials, 1309 participants), individual counselling (OR 1.96,
95% CI 1.51 to 2.54; eight trials, 3516 participants), pharmacotherapies (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.11; five trials, 1092 participants), and
multiple intervention programmes aimed mainly or solely at smoking cessation (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.13; six trials, 5018 participants)
all increased cessation rates in comparison to no treatment or minimal intervention controls. Self-help materials were less effective (OR
1.16, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.82; six trials, 1906 participants), and two relapse prevention programmes (484 participants) did not help to sustain

long-term abstinence. Incentives did not appear to improve the odds of quitting, apart from one study which found a sustained positive
benefit. There was a lack of evidence that comprehensive programmes targeting multiple risk factors reduced the prevalence of smoking.

Authors' conclusions

1. We found strong evidence that some interventions directed towards individual smokers increase the likelihood of quitting smoking.
These include individual and group counselling, pharmacological treatment to overcome nicotine addiction, and multiple interventions
targeting smoking cessation as the primary or only outcome. All these interventions show similar effects whether offered in the workplace
or elsewhere. Self-help interventions and social support are less effective. Although people taking up these interventions are more likely
to stop, the absolute numbers who quit are low.

2.  We  failed  to  detect  an  effect  of  comprehensive  programmes  targeting  multiple  risk  factors  in  reducing  the  prevalence  of  smoking,
although this finding was not based on meta-analysed data.

3.  There  was  limited  evidence  that  participation  in  programmes  can  be  increased  by  competitions  and  incentives  organized  by  the
employer, although one trial demonstrated a sustained effect of financial rewards for attending a smoking cessation course and for long-
term quitting. Further research is needed to establish which components of this trial contributed to the improvement in success rates.

4.  Further  research  would  be  valuable  in  low-income  and  developing  countries,  where  high  rates  of  smoking  prevail  and  smoke-free
legislation is not widely accepted or enforced.

Is the workplace an effective setting for helping people to stop smoking

Background
The workplace appears to be a useful setting for helping people to stop smoking. Large groups of smokers are available who can easily
be  reached  and  helped,  using  proven  methods.  It  is  also  in  the  employers’  interests  to  improve  the  health  of  their  workforce.  Recent
changes introducing anti-smoking laws in many developed countries may have eased the pressure to demonstrate the value of work-
based programmes. The situation in developing countries still requires that such methods be tested and proved in those communities. We
reviewed the evidence about workplace programmes to help employees stop smoking, and any information about their costs and benefits.

Study characteristics
For this updated review (first published in 2003), we searched for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials, comparing the
success  rates  of  those  in  a  work-based  stop-smoking  programme  with  those  not  involved  in  a  work-based  stop-smoking  programme.
The comparison could be between people within a single worksite, or between one or more worksites randomized to a stop-smoking
programme or to no programme (cluster-randomized). The study had to include adults (over 18), and could be in any language and reported
in any format, published or not. It had to report the numbers stopping smoking for at least six months.

Results
We searched for studies in July 2013, and identified ten new trials that fitted our criteria, making a total for this update of 61 comparisons
across  57  included  studies.  We  grouped  them  into  two  broad  categories:  those  aimed  at  helping  individual  smokers,  and  those  that
targeted  the  workplace  environment  as  a  whole.  The  first  group  includes  such  methods  as  individual  or  group  counselling,  self  help,
nicotine  replacement  therapy  (NRT)  and  other  medications,  help  from  workmates  or  other  staff,  and  helping  quitters  to  stay  smoke-
free. The second group includes environmental cues (posters, reminders), financial or material incentives, and comprehensive smoking
cessation or health promotion programmes. The review found that programmes based on group behaviour therapy (eight trials; 1309
participants),  on  individual  counselling  (eight  trials;  3516  participants),  on  medications  (five  trials;  1092  participants),  and  on  several
interventions  combined  (six  trials;  5018  participants)  helped  people  to  stop  smoking.  The  chances  of  stopping  smoking  using  these
methods  are  about  the  same  in  the  workplace  as  they  are  in  other  settings.  This  review  found  that  the  following  do  not  help  people
to stop smoking when delivered in the workplace: self-help methods, support from friends, family and workmates, relapse prevention
programmes, environmental cues, or comprehensive programmes aimed at changing several high-risk behaviours. Results were mixed for
incentives, with one high-quality trial finding a clear benefit for incentives while the remaining five did not.

Quality of the evidence
Earlier studies tended to be less well-conducted and reported than recent ones. Fewer than one in five studies randomized their study
population by an acceptable method. Two-thirds of the studies checked the accuracy of those who said they had quit by testing their
breath, blood or urine. The results were generally in line with findings from other reviews of those ways of quitting in any setting. The
'Summary of findings' table shows that the trials were generally rated as being of moderate to high quality, further confirming the strength
of our findings. Future research might examine what features of the large incentives trial made it more successful than other trials in that
group. It would also be helpful to have more trials from developing and low-income countries, where smoking rates remain high and anti-
smoking laws are not widely enforced.

Why it is important to do this review

Most  adults  spend  about  a  third  of  their  day  in  a  workplace
environment. The workplace is therefore a setting through which
large  groups  of  smokers  can  potentially  be  reached  by  health
promotion (Gruman 1993).

Description of the condition

It is estimated that in 2007 approximately 60% of Americans were
covered by health insurance plans sponsored through their or their
spouse's  workplace  (DeNaves-Walt  2008).  Milani  2009  estimates
that in the US nearly 60% of after-tax profits are spent on corporate
health benefits, with 80% of such expenses incurred by 10% to 20%
of the workforce. US employers have a vested interest in improving
and maintaining the health and performance of their workforce.

National  smoke-free  policies  introduced  in  the  UK  in  2006-7  are
complemented  by  government  guidelines  on  how  to  implement
the  policies  and  how  best  to  assist  employees  with  smoking
cessation  during  this  process  (NICE  2007).  Recommendations
include  summaries  of  interventions  of  proven  efficacy,  and
encouragement  for  employers  conducting  smoking  cessation
programmes within working hours. The cost-effectiveness of such
implementation has also been tested (NICE 2006).

Description of the intervention

Work-based  smoking  cessation  programmes  are  similar  to  those
deployed in other institutions (e.g. hospitals, colleges, schools) or
in  the  community.  They  include  behavioural  or  pharmacological
interventions, or a combination of both, and comprehensive health
promotion initiatives, targeting individuals or cohorts of workers.
Proven cessation strategies can be conducted opportunistically on
workplace premises and in working hours.

How the intervention might work

There  are  several  advantages  to  the  traditional  workplace  as  a
setting for smoking cessation:

1. It provides access to a large number of people who make up a

relatively stable population.

2. It  has  the  potential  for  higher  participation  rates  than  non-

workplace environments.

3. It  may  encourage  sustained  peer-group  support  and  positive

peer pressure.

4. It provides a particular opportunity to target young men, who
traditionally  have  low  general  practitioner  consultation  rates
and  are  thus  less  likely  to  benefit  from  opportunistic  health
promotion activity in primary care.

5. Occupational health staff may be on hand to give professional

support.

6. The  employee  generally  is  not  required  to  travel  to  the

programme or to dedicate their own personal time to it.

However,  all  of  these  assumptions  are  based  on  a  model  of  the
workplace  that  is  rapidly  changing.  Recent  research,  included
in  this  update,  highlights  the  increasingly  transient  and  volatile
nature of the modern workforce, with younger employees changing
jobs and locations more frequently than earlier generations (see for
example Mishra 2010; Okechukwu 2009).

During the life of this review (first published ten years ago), smoke-
free  legislation  has  fundamentally  altered  working  conditions  in
many  developed  countries.  The  attention  of  the  tobacco  control
community is now shifting to areas where anti-tobacco initiatives
are still in their infancy. We include new studies in this update which
test  such  approaches  in  India,  Malaysia  and  China,  with  varying
levels of success.

O B J E C T I V E S

The specific objectives of this updated review were:

1.  To  categorize  workplace  interventions  for  smoking  cessation
tested in controlled studies, and to determine the extent to which
they help workers to stop smoking.

2.  To  collect  and  evaluate  data  on  costs  and  cost  effectiveness
associated with workplace interventions.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We  include  randomized  and  quasi-randomized  controlled  trials,
allocating individuals, workplaces or companies to intervention or
control conditions.

Types of participants

Adults over 18 years of age, in employment, who smoked.

Types of interventions

In earlier versions of this review, we divided the interventions into
those aimed at helping individual smokers to quit, and those aimed
at the workplace as a whole. Although we still include both types
of  interventions,  previous  versions  of  this  review  also  included
bans and restrictions as interventions aimed at the workplace as
a whole. These are now covered by a companion review (Callinan
2010), and we no longer include them here.

We  include  any  workplace  interventions  aimed  at  smoking
cessation.  These  include  programmes  designed  to  exclusively
target  smoking  behaviour  or  to  target  multiple  lifestyle  risk
behaviours.  The  studies  aim  mainly  to  assess  the  effects
of  cessation  programmes  for  individual  workers  who  smoke.
They  test  a  range  of  interventions,  including  individual  and
group  counselling,  self-help  materials,  pharmacological  therapy,
social and environmental support, incentives, and comprehensive
programmes. They are usually aimed at individuals who seek help
rather than at the workforce as a whole. We also include studies that
test relapse prevention interventions in association with worksite-
based smoking cessation programmes.

Types of outcome measures

The  main  outcome  was  employee  smoking  behaviour  (cessation
rates  for  programmes  and  workplace  prevalence  data),  for  a
minimum  of  six  months.  We  preferred  prolonged  or  continuous
abstinence  to  point  prevalence,  and  biochemically  verified
abstinence to self-report, but did not exclude studies on the basis

of their chosen outcomes. We excluded studies with less than six
months follow-up.

Search methods for identification of studies

searched 

the  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction  Review
We 
Group  Specialized  Register,  which  includes  studies  identified
by  systematic  electronic  searches  of  multiple  databases,
handsearching of specialist journals and conference proceedings,
and  grey  literature  (i.e.  conference  proceedings  and  unpublished
reports not normally covered by most electronic indexing systems).
At  the  time  of  the  search,  the  Register  included  the  results  of
searches  of  the  Cochrane  Central  Register  of  Controlled  Trials
(CENTRAL), issue 12, 2012; MEDLINE (via OVID) to update 20130607;
EMBASE  (via  OVID)  to  week  201324;  and  PsycINFO  (via  OVID)  to
update  20130610.  See  the  Tobacco  Addiction  Group  module  in
The  Cochrane  Library  for  full  search  strategies  and  a  list  of  other
resources searched. See Appendix 1 for the search terms used to
search  the  Register  for  this  review.  These  searches  include  terms
to  identify  controlled  trials.  We  also  conducted  ad  hoc  searches
of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO using topic-related keywords
without  design  limits.  These  searches  were  updated  on  2nd  July
2013. Search terms included 'worksite*' or 'workplace*' as keyword
or free-text terms, and 'work' or 'occupational health' as keywords.
We  list  the  search  strategies  in  Appendix  2.  The  results  of  these
searches  were  cross-checked  against  references  in  the  identified
papers and previous reviews and meta-analyses.

We  also  contacted  authors  of  studies  for  additional  information
where necessary.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

One  author  (KC)  prescreened  reports  for  relevance,  i.e.  studies
that  might  be  included,  or  for  useful  background,  and  obtained
full-text  copies  of  candidate  studies  for  inclusion.  Both  authors
then  independently  assessed  them  against  the  inclusion  criteria,
resolving  discrepancies  by  discussion.  We  noted  reasons  for
the  non-inclusion  of  studies,  and  incorporated  those  into  the
Characteristics of excluded studies table.

Data extraction and management

One author (KC) extracted data and a second author (TL) checked
them.  Where  possible,  we  extracted  data  on  quit  rates  using  the
number randomized as the denominator, making the assumption
that those lost to follow-up (or not reported) continued to smoke.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

For  this  update,  we  have  evaluated  all  the  included  studies
(past  and  new)  for  risks  of  bias,  using  the  Cochrane  'Risk  of
bias'  assessment  tool  (Cochrane  Handbook,  Chapter  8).  We  have
assessed  the  randomization  process  (sequence  generation  and
allocation concealment; selection bias), blinding (performance and
detection bias), incomplete outcome reporting (attrition bias), and
selective outcome reporting (reporting bias).

Dealing with missing data

We  contacted  authors  where  possible  to  fill  gaps  in  the  data.
We  counted  participants  lost  to  follow-up  or  unaccounted  for  as
continuing  smokers,  and  where  possible  included  them  in  the
denominator on an intention-to-treat basis.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Data synthesis

For  this  update,  we  have  pooled  data  for  the  main  categories
of  intervention,  using  the  generic  inverse  variance  (GIV)  method
(derived  from  the  log  odds),  to  produce  Mantel-Haenszel  odds
ratios  (ORs),  using  a  fixed-effect  model  with  95%  confidence
intervals (CIs). We have used the intraclass correlation coefficient
reported  by  Martinson  1999  (ICC  for  percentage  quit  smoking  in
worksite) to obtain an adjusted estimate of the effect size for the
studies that were cluster-randomized. This represents a departure
from  the  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction  Group's  preferred  analysis
method of risk ratios, in order to accommodate the ICC calculations
where necessary.

We include a 'Summary of findings for the main comparison' for the
main results.

We also include a glossary of tobacco-related terms (Appendix 3).

R E S U L T S

Description of studies

We found 57 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Ten of these are
new for this update (Bergstrom 2008; Prochaska 2008; Milani 2009;
Okechukwu  2009;  Volpp  2009;  Hishida  2010;  Mayer  2010;  Mishra
2010;  Groeneveld  2011;  Noor  2011).  Detailed  information  about
each is shown in the table Characteristics of included studies. We
assigned  the  individual  studies  to  one  or  more  of  the  categories
of intervention. Four studies (Omenn 1988; Windsor 1988; Gomel
1993a;  Tanaka  2006)  contribute  to  more  than  one  category.  For
this  update,  we  identified  eight  additional  studies  that  did  not
meet  the  inclusion  criteria,  and  we  also  now  exclude  four  trials
that were originally included (Kornitzer 1987; Jeffery 1988; Burling
1989;  Burling  2000).  This  gives  a  total  for  this  update  of  105
excluded  studies,  brief  details  of  which  are  listed  in  the  table
Characteristics of excluded studies. We also identified two ongoing
studies (NCT01124110 2012; NTR8148 2012), and one Chinese study
(Gao 2010) for which we currently have insufficient information to
include it.

A  number  of  studies  evaluated  interventions  aimed  at  the
individual,  usually  without  any  attempt  to  target  or  modify  the
workplace  as  a  whole.  The  types  of  intervention  were  diverse,
including intensive behavioural interventions, self-help materials,
pharmacological treatments, and social support.

Other  studies  included  environmental  support  for  not  smoking,
incentives  for  not  smoking,  and  multicomponent  programmes
aimed primarily at smoking cessation, or at improving employees'
general health, including their smoking status.

GROUP 1: INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT THE INDIVIDUAL TO
PROMOTE SMOKING CESSATION

1. Intensive behavioural interventions: Group counselling

We  found  10  randomized  controlled  trials  that  reported  6-  to  24-
month quit rates for individuals receiving group-based behavioural
interventions  (Glasgow  1984;  Frank  1986;  Klesges  1987;  Omenn
1988; DePaul 1994; Razavi 1999; Schröter 2006; Gunes 2007; Mayer
2010; Mishra 2010). Some of these studies compared an intensive
intervention,  typically  including  group  support  meetings,  with  a
less intensive intervention such as provision of self-help materials,

or with a waiting list control. Some compared variations of group
programmes, or the additional impact of incentives.

Three  studies  evaluated  ways  to  improve  the  results  of  group
programmes:

• Glasgow 1984 compared three versions of a controlled smoking
programme 
in  36  employees:  abrupt  reduction;  gradual
reduction;  or  gradual  reduction  plus  feedback  on  nicotine
consumption  with  one  pre-  and  two  post-tests.  Smoking
reduction  was  defined  as  an  outcome  for  this  study,  targeting
nicotine content (brand smoked), number of cigarettes smoked
daily,  and  percentage  of  each  cigarette  smoked.  Participants
could  choose  either  cessation  or  reduction  as  their  desired
outcome. The participation rate was not reported, though an 8%
attrition rate was reported.

• Frank 1986 assigned 63 participants to one of three treatments:
four  hypnotic  sessions  with  a  booster;  two  hypnotic  sessions;
or  two  hypnotic  and  two  behavioural  sessions  with  a  booster.
A  follow-up  group  of  15  later  recruits  received  four  hypnotic
sessions and a booster session. The participation rate was not
reported. The study lacked a no-treatment control group.

• Klesges  1987  tested  the  effect  of  competitions  on  cessation
rates  in  136  smokers  from  eight  workplaces.  The  workplace
was  the  unit  of  randomization  (cluster-randomized)  but  with
individuals as the unit of analysis. The participation rate was not
reported but was estimated at 28% across all eight participating
workplaces. The drop-out rate from treatment was 7% overall,
with no difference across conditions.

DePaul 1994) compared three interventions; self-help alone, self-
help  with  incentive  payments  for  days  abstinent,  and  intensive
group  support  with  incentive  payments,  cognitive  behavioural
strategies, and maintenance manuals.

Two  group-counselling  trials  (Razavi  1999;  Mayer  2010)  targeted
recent  ex-smokers,  to  reinforce  abstinence  and  reduce  relapse
rates.  Three  other  trials  (Klesges  1987;  Omenn  1988:  Schröter
2006) also included a relapse prevention component, alongside a
cessation intervention.

• Razavi 1999 randomized abstainers (98.6% of those eligible) who
had completed a non-randomized cessation programme, to test
the efficacy of two relapse prevention programmes. Participants
were  assigned  to  a  psychologist-run  support  group  (PG),  or
an ex-smoker-run support group (SG) or a 'no formal support'
group  (NG),  and  were  assessed  at  12  months.  Participants
in  the  PG  and  SG  groups  attended  monthly  meetings,  where
cessation support was given, and weight, blood pressure, pulse
and  concomitant  medical  problems  were  monitored.  At  the
end of nine months, participants completed a Brief Symptoms
Inventory and a Life Events Scale. All who were participants at
three months were followed up until 12 months post-treatment.
• Mayer 2010 randomized successful quitters following a smoking
cessation  programme  in  a  number  of  Belgian  companies  to
either  work-based  group  counselling  or  to  proactive  phone
counselling  to  minimize  relapse  rates.  The  cohorts  were
assessed after nine months for long-term relapse-free quit rates.

Omenn 1988 recruited smokers at a single workplace. Participants
with a preference for a group format were randomized to one of two
smoking cessation programmes (Multiple Component Programme

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

or Relapse Prevention Programme) or to a 'self help only' condition
(American Cancer Society Quitter's Guide). Those not interested in
group  support  were  randomized  to  a  manual-based  version  of
the same Multiple Component Programme or Relapse Prevention
Programme,  or  the  same  Guide.  The  participation  rate  was  11%.
This study also contributes data to the self-help group.

Schröter  2006  offered  a  relapse  prevention  programme  in  four
German  workplaces,  compared  with  a  standard  behavioural
programme.  Nicotine  replacement  therapy  was  also  provided  if
requested. Sessions rather than individuals were randomized, and
the programme lasted eight weeks, with follow-up at one year.

Gunes  2007,  set  in  a  Turkish  textile  factory,  primarily  measured
movement  through  stages  of  change  in  two  matched  cohorts
of  male  smokers.  The  intervention  group  received  a  three-week
behavioural programme based on the American Lung Association's
Seven Steps to a Smoke-Free Life. Smoking status was assessed at
the six-month follow-up.

Mishra  2010  is  a  study  set  in  four  Indian  call  centres,  each  of
which  hosted  a  different  level  of  intervention.  The  control  site
distributed  self-help  materials  to  all  employees  on  the  hazards
of  tobacco,  methods  of  quitting,  and  where  to  go  for  practical
help.  The  first  intervention  site  (which  we  use  in  this  review)
conducted  health  education  sessions  for  all  employees,  followed
by  focus-group  discussions  for  tobacco  users  in  groups  of  7  to
10. The second intervention site replicated this but added one-to-
one behavioural therapy, and the third intervention site added the
offer  of  bupropion  based  on  needs  assessment.  The  researchers
followed up all tobacco users in person or by phone to 12 months.
It is notable that high staff turnover in this population meant that
52.4% of baseline tobacco users had changed jobs after 12 months.

2. Intensive behavioural interventions: Individual counselling

We  found  eight  studies  that  investigated  individual  counselling,
in  most  cases  given  by  a  physician  (Cambien  1981;  Li  1984;
Gomel  1993a;  Kadowaki  2000;  Lang  2000),  in  Terazawa  2001  by
trained nursing staff, in Groeneveld 2011 by either an occupational
physician  or  an  occupational  nurse,  and  in  Windsor  1988  by  a
'health educator'.

Two  years  post-intervention,  Cambien  1981  followed  up  the  first
1292  participants  in  a  cluster-randomized  controlled  trial,  the
Paris Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevention Trial, conducted in 160
sections of a civil service administration. They measured the effects
of physician advice, information leaflets and physical monitoring
on diet, alcohol and cigarette consumption in young men (25 to 35
years of age). We focus here on the 610 participants in the smoking
cessation  components.  The  intervention  participants  received
either  three  or  four  tailored  counselling  sessions,  depending  on
whether  their  baseline  assessment  showed  them  to  be  at  low  or
at  high  risk  of  coronary  disease.  The  control  group  received  only
baseline and follow-up assessments.

Li  1984  studied  asbestos-exposed  male  smokers  undergoing
screening in a mandated programme for naval shipyard workers.
The  workers  were  categorized  as  having  normal  or  abnormal
pulmonary  status  on  the  basis  of  a  chest  X-ray  and  pulmonary
function  tests.  They  were  then  randomly  assigned  within
pulmonary  function  test  categories  to  receive  either  a  simple
warning  or  three  to  five  minutes  of  behavioural  cessation

counselling from the physician who gave them the results of their
pulmonary tests. The participation rate is reported as 84.6%. The
study did not have a no-treatment control group.

Windsor  1988  studied  the  incremental  effectiveness  of  a  skills
training  programme  with  social  support  enhancement  and
monetary  incentives  to  a  self-help  manual.  A  health  educator
provided  training  in  cessation  skills  in  a  structured  20-  to  30-
minute  one-to-one  session;  one  group  received  this  training  to
supplement the self-help manual, and another group received both
interventions plus monetary incentives. This study also contributes
data to the incentives group.

Gomel 1993a randomized 28 Sydney (Australia) ambulance stations
to four intervention groups (without a no-treatment control), in an
attempt to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. The HRA (Health Risk
Assessment) group received measurements and risk assessments,
including body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking
status, percentage of body fat, and aerobic capacity. We focus here
on the 128 smokers who participated. Those assessed as being at
high risk were referred to their own family physician, but received
no direct support from the intervention programme. The RFE (Risk
Factor  Education)  group  received  a  similar  assessment,  but  were
given standard advice, through written and video material. The BC
(Behavioural  Counselling)  group,  after  the  standard  assessment,
were  offered  up  to  six  counselling  sessions  in  risk  reduction,
together  with  a  manual  on  behaviour  change.  The  fourth  group
(BCI,  Behavioural  Counselling  and  Incentives)  received  the  same
programme  as  the  BC  group,  together  with  an  incentive  scheme
which  gave  individuals  the  chance  to  win  AUD  40  for  achieving
risk  reduction  targets  at  three  and  six  months,  plus  a  prize  of
AUD  1000  for  the  station  which  achieved  the  highest  percentage
of successful participants at six-month follow-up. The participation
rate was 88% (431 participants, including 128 smokers). This study
also contributes data to the incentives group.

in  all  male  smokers 

Kadowaki 2000 evaluated the effectiveness of a smoking cessation
in  a  Japanese  radiator
intervention 
manufacturing  factory.  Participants  in  the  intervention  group
received  individual  counselling  by  a  doctor,  and  those  who
signed a Smoking Cessation Declaration underwent a five-month
intervention.  Subjects  in  the  control  group  received  equivalent
delayed  intervention  after  four  months.  Randomization  was  by
individual smoker.

Lang  2000  compared  the  effects  of  a  workplace  intervention  by
the  occupational  physician,  offering  simple  advice  on  smoking
cessation  for  five  to  ten  minutes,  with  a  more  active  strategy  of
advice including a quit date and extra support. For both strategies,
the  medical  team  was  composed  of  a  physician  and  whenever
possible a nurse, who would reinforce the physician's advice. Both
the randomization and the analysis were by workplace.

Terazawa  2001  randomized  228  smokers  presenting  for  routine
occupational  health  checks  in  a  Japanese  factory;  117  were
allocated to the intervention condition, and 111 to the control. All
participants  completed  a  baseline  questionnaire  and  had  carbon
monoxide  (CO)  and  urinary  metabolites  measured  to  verify  their
level  of  smoking.  Intervention  group  smokers  also  received  a
15-  to  20-minute  counselling  session  from  a  nurse  trained  in
cessation methods, and those who were prepared to set a quit date
received four follow-up phone calls to support their quit attempt.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Control subjects received the baseline screening and usual care. All
participants were re-assessed at six and twelve months follow-up.

Groeneveld  2011  targeted  individuals  at  elevated  risk  for  cardiac
illness  in  a  cohort  of  Dutch  male  construction  workers.  The
participants could choose to address either nutrition and physical
activity  or  smoking  cessation,  and  we  focus  for  this  review  on
the  115  intervention  smokers  and  the  123  control  smokers  who
attempted  to  quit  smoking.  The  programme  offered  three  face-
to-face  45-  to  60-minute  sessions  of  motivational  interviewing
(MI)  counselling,  and  four  15-  to  30-minute  phone  calls  with  an
occupational  physician  or  nurse.  All  participants  also  received
brochures  on  physical  activity,  healthy  eating,  smoking,  and
cardiovascular  disease.  The  relevant  outcome  was  self-reported
smoking cessation at six and 12 months.

3. Self-help interventions

We found six studies that examined self-help interventions (Omenn
1988;  Sutton  1988a;  Sutton  1988b;  Sutton  1988c;  Sutton  1988d;
Hishida  2010).  A  variety  of  approaches  were  tested  and  included
short  videos  (Sutton  1988a;  Sutton  1988b;  Sutton  1988c;  Sutton
1988d),  self-help  manuals  (Omenn  1988),  and  information  about
genotyping (Hishida 2010).

The  Omenn  1988  study  is  described  in  the  Group  Counselling
section. We consider only the self-help arms for this category.

Sutton (Sutton 1988a; Sutton 1988b; Sutton 1988c; Sutton 1988d),
in  a  series  of  four  randomized  controlled  studies  in  four  UK
companies, evaluated a minimal smoking intervention programme
based  on  the  use  of  motivational  videotapes.  In  the  videotape
studies  groups  of  smokers  (n  =  603)  were  randomly  assigned  to
watch one of several different videotapes. They were followed up
along with non-participants (n = 1015) at three months and again
at one year.

Hishida  2010  was  set  in  a  Tokyo  bank,  and  allocated  smokers
to  genotyping  or  to  assessment  only  by  alternate  months  of
routine occupational health checks. All smokers received a booklet
indicating  that  particular  genotypes  appeared  to  be  at  increased
risk  of  smoking-related  cancers;  those  in  the  intervention  cohort
who  agreed  to  be  genotyped  received  their  results  three  months
later,  without  specific  cessation  advice.  All  participants  were
assessed  at  12  months.  The  primary  outcome  was  movement
through  the  stages  of  change,  but  smoking  status  by  allocated
group and by genotype were also collected.

4. Pharmacological therapy

Five studies investigated pharmacological therapy in the workplace
(Sutton 1987; Sutton 1988e; Kornitzer 1995; Rodriguez 2003; Noor
2011).  Seven  other  included  studies  (Razavi  1999;  Schröter  2006;
Tanaka  2006;  Sorensen  2007;  Okechukwu  2009;  Bergstrom  2008;
Mayer 2010) also included NRT as part of their intervention, but not
as the component being tested. Mishra 2010 added bupropion to its
most intensive intervention arm, but only 10 of the 24 smokers who
were offered bupropion took up the option.

Kornitzer  1995  evaluated  the  effects  of  adding  nicotine  gum
to  smokers  already  using  the  nicotine  patch  in  a  double-blind
placebo-controlled  randomized  trial.  The  effect  of  the  nicotine
patch  against  placebo  patch  in  both  groups  receiving  placebo
nicotine gum was also assessed.

Sutton  1987  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  a  brief  treatment  for
smoking using nicotine chewing gum in a large retailing company
in London, UK. The study was randomized with a two-group pre-
test/post-test  design.  In  total  270  of  334  cigarette  smokers  who
expressed  interest  were  invited  to  take  part  in  the  programme,
which consisted of two individual consultations two weeks apart
and a prescription for 2 mg Nicorette gum with recommendations
for its use. The remaining 64 smokers constituted a no-intervention
control group.

Sutton  1988e  evaluated  the  effect  of  offering  brief  individual
treatment based on nicotine chewing gum to a randomly chosen
sample in one company (n = 161) still smoking at the three-month
follow  up  to  a  previous  video  intervention  (Sutton  1988d).  The
treatment course was administered by occupational health nurses
and consisted of four short consultations over a 12-week period.

Rodriguez  2003  delivered  a  combined  intervention  of  individual
structured  counselling  with  nicotine  patches  in  an  open  (non-
blinded)  randomized  controlled  trial  conducted  in  three  Spanish
worksites.  Intervention  participants  (115  people)  were  graded  by
Fagerstrom  score  and  treated  with  appropriate  levels  of  nicotine
replacement  therapy  for  up  to  12  weeks.  Progress,  withdrawal
symptoms  and  adverse  events  were  monitored  over  the  12-
month  trial  period.  Control  group  smokers  (103  people)  received
brief,  sporadic  and  unstructured  advice,  usually  at  their  annual
occupational health check.

in  two  Malaysian  towns,  offered  a  herbal
Noor  2011,  set 
compound (Viva QS) or placebo tablets to male smokers employed
in  11  worksites  and  attending  a  mobile  smoking  cessation
clinic.  Participants  were  contacted  by  phone  at  two  and  four
weeks,  to  assess  progress  and  adverse  events,  and  were  given
brief  counselling.  Outcomes  were  7-day  point  prevalence  and
continuous abstinence from weeks 4 to 24, verified by expired CO.
All participants, whether claiming abstinence or not, were checked
face-to-face at 24 weeks. Fifty-four urine samples for cotinine were
collected at week 24, but not analysed.

5. Social support for not smoking

Two  studies  evaluated  social  support  as  an  increment  to  other
cessation strategies (Malott 1984; Glasgow 1986). Social support, in
this context, refers to the support of a 'significant other', for example
a spouse, a workmate or a close friend.

Malott 1984 randomly assigned 24 smokers to controlled smoking
or  a  controlled  smoking  plus  partner  support  intervention.  Both
studies  defined  smoking  reduction  as  one  of  their  outcomes,
targeting  nicotine  content  (brand  smoked),  number  of  cigarettes
smoked  daily,  and  percentage  of  each  cigarette  smoked.
Participants  could  choose  either  cessation  or  reduction  as  their
desired outcome. The participation rate was not reported.

Glasgow  1986  recruited  29  smokers  who  were  assigned  to  small
groups  and  were  then  randomly  allocated  to  a  basic  programme
or basic programme plus social support. The participation rate was
not reported.

WHOLE

6. Environmental support for not smoking

We found three studies that reported environmental or institutional
support programmes (Dawley 1991; Erfurt 1991; Hymowitz 1991).
Tanaka  2006  also  included  environmental  components,  as  one
part  of  a  complex  intervention  programme  (see  Comprehensive
programmes for details).

Dawley  1991  evaluated  a  small  study  of  workplace  smoking
control  in  two  comparable  oil  refineries.  One  company  was
randomly  assigned  to  an  environmental  programme  of  smoking
control, discouragement, and cessation, while the other company
received  only  a  smoking  cessation  programme.  Humorous  anti-
smoking  posters  emphasizing  the  benefits  of  quitting  smoking
were distributed throughout the intervention workplace and were
changed  every  two  weeks.  Three  weeks  after  the  initiation  of
the smoking discouragement programme at one refinery, a group
smoking  cessation  programme  was  begun  at  both  plants.  The
participation rate was not reported.

Erfurt 1991 compared the effects of four interventions: (1) wellness
screening, (2) wellness screening plus health education, (3) 1 and
2, plus follow-up counselling, and (4) 1, 2 and 3 plus peer support
groups, buddy systems, health promotion classes, and plant-wide
activities.

Hymowitz 1991 evaluated the effect of an enriched environment on
the impact of a group quit-smoking programme in six workplaces.
Two hundred and fifty-two smokers participated in the group quit
smoking  programmes;  131  at  the  full  programme  sites  (group
plus physician counselling plus workplace health promotion) and
121  at  the  group-only  sites  (group  cessation  programme).  The
participation rate was not reported.

7. Incentives

We  found  six  studies  of  incentives  with  comparison  groups  and
quit rates (Rand 1989; Windsor 1988; Glasgow 1993; Gomel 1993a;
Hennrikus 2002; Volpp 2009). A number of other included studies
(Klesges 1987; DePaul 1989; DePaul 1994; Sutton 1988a to Sutton
1988d;  Tanaka  2006)  used  incentives  as  an  aid  to  cessation  or
reduction, but not as the intervention being tested.

Rand  1989  examined  the  relative  contribution  of  a  contingent
payment (up to USD 200) and workplace CO monitoring to the long-
term  maintenance  of  smoking  abstinence.  Forty-seven  hospital
employees  who  had  abstained  from  smoking  for  five  days  were
randomly  assigned  to  one  of  three  follow-up  groups:  contingent
payment  and  frequent  monitoring  (n  =  17),  non-contingent
payment with frequent monitoring (n = 16), or contingent payment
with infrequent monitoring (n = 14).

Windsor  1988  studied  the  incremental  effectiveness  of  skills
training with social support enhancement and monetary incentives
to  a  self-help  manual.  The  participants  were  randomized  to  four
groups  in  a  two-by-two  factorial  pre-test/post-test  design.  The
monetary incentive was a USD 25 payment to the employee after six
weeks of abstinence. An additional USD 25 incentive was awarded
at the end of six months abstinence.

Glasgow  1993  evaluated  the  impact  of  a  year-long  incentive-
based  workplace  cessation  programme  (the  HIP  program).

Nineteen workplaces were randomized to incentive or no-incentive
conditions.  Smokers  were  paid  USD  10  each  time  they  were
confirmed abstinent by CO validation at monthly meetings over the
year-long programme. In addition, each month at each workplace
abstinent smokers were also eligible to win a lottery prize (which
ranged  from  USD  5  to  USD  20)  and  grand  prize  lotteries  during
the  final  month  of  the  programme.  All  identified  smokers  in
the  workplace  were  considered  as  participants  for  the  study,
whether  or  not  they  participated  in  the  intervention.  Analyses
were  conducted  at  both  the  workplace  and  individual  level  and
using both self-reported and biochemically validated cessation as
endpoints. There was a participation rate of 23% in the incentive
group.

Gomel  1993a,  in  a  cluster-randomized  study  of  28  Australian
ambulance stations, included an incentives component in its four-
way  comparison  study  to  reduce  cardiovascular  risk  factors.  This
trial is described above, under the individual counselling section.

programme  options  (telephone  counselling,  group  sessions,  or  a
choice  of  either),  each  offered  with  and  without  incentives  for
recruitment and cessation. Four workplaces were assigned to each
of the six options, and were surveyed at baseline, and again at 12
and 24 months. Incentive site smokers were paid for signing up to
a programme (USD 10), for completing it (USD 20) and for 30 days
abstinence (USD 20). Successful quitters were entered into a prize
draw, to win up to USD 500. A sample of quitters at 24 months were
also paid USD 25 if they supplied saliva for cotinine measurement.

randomized smokers to information about local smoking cessation
services  versus  the  same  information  combined  with  stepped
financial  rewards  for  completing  a  smoking  cessation  course
and  for  sustained  cessation.  Up  to  USD  750  were  available  to
each  intervention  smoker  for  long-term  (12-month)  cessation
biochemically  confirmed.  Participants  were  also  rewarded  for
completing  a  smoking  cessation  course,  for  complying  with
assessments and for supplying confirmatory samples. The primary
outcome was validated abstinence at 12 or 18 months (depending
on  earlier  success).  Assessments  were  conducted  and  rewards
given some months after completion of the cessation programme.

8. Comprehensive programmes

We classify these trials into two groups:
(a) Programmes which used a combination of types of intervention
to support the primary aim of the trial, i.e. to quit smoking.
(b)  Programmes  which  used  a  mix  of  interventions  to  reduce  a
number of different high-risk behaviours, including smoking.

a) Multiple intervention smoking cessation programmes

We  found  seven  trials  which  have  smoking  cessation  as  their
primary or only outcome, but use a combination of interventions
to address it (DePaul 1987; Willemsen 1998; DePaul 1989; Sorensen
1993; Shimizu 1999; Tanaka 2006; Okechukwu 2009).

DePaul  1987  randomized  workplaces  to  self-help  materials  in
conjunction with televised cessation programmes versus the same
materials and programmes plus group or individual counselling at
the workplace.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

In  DePaul  1989,  the  basic  design  was  as  for  DePaul  1987,  but
enhanced  with  monthly  booster  sessions,  and  with  successful
quitters and up to five of their family and co-workers entered in a
lottery at the end of the intervention period and at one-year follow-
up.

Sorensen 1993 examined the effectiveness of a multi-component
smoking  cessation  programme.  The  three-month  intervention
included  consultation  for  employers  on  the  adoption  of  a  non-
smoking policy (90-minute consultation), training for nonsmokers
(a  one-hour  class)  to  provide  assistance  to  smokers  attempting
to  quit,  and  cessation  classes  for  smokers  (three  one-hour
behavioural cessation classes). Eight workplaces were randomized
to  two  groups  (intervention/no  intervention)  with  one  and  two
post-tests. Although the workplace was the unit of randomization,
analyses  were  conducted  using  the  individual  as  the  unit  of
analysis. The participation rate was reported as 12% of smokers and
3.7% of nonsmokers. The attrition rate was not reported. No data
were available for individual smoking cessation.

A  Dutch  study  (Willemsen  1998)  compared  a  comprehensive
smoking  cessation  intervention  of  self-help  manuals,  group
courses,  a  mass  media  campaign,  and  smoking  policies  with  a
minimal intervention of self-help manuals only. Eight workplaces
(four matched pairs) participated in the study. The 'bogus pipeline'
procedure  was  used  to  improve  the  validity  of  self  reports  of
smoking status. This means that subjects are informed that their
self  reports  can  be  biochemically  verified,  although  the  test  is
not  necessarily  performed.  Respondents  who  claimed  they  were
nonsmokers at the 14-month follow-up were asked to co-operate
with biochemical validation of their smoking status.

A  Japanese  study  (Shimizu  1999),  available  only  as  an  abstract,
examined  the  effectiveness  of  a  multicomponent  smoking
cessation  programme  (intensive  education,  group  lectures  and
individual counselling) compared to a waiting-list control group of
smokers. The participation rate was not reported.

(Tanaka  2006)  was  a  Japanese
The  HIPOP-OHP  Study 
multicomponent intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk factors,
including smoking, in six intervention sites matched to six control
sites. The study concentrated mostly on blue-collar workers. The
six-week  cessation  programme  was  offered  five  times  over  36
months, and included information brochures on stages of change,
four counselling sessions and NRT if requested. It was integrated
with  an  intra-site  publicity  campaign  (posters,  newsletters,  web
site),  designation  of  smoking  areas,  and  an  award  for  successful
abstainers.  Participants  were  assessed  at  12,  24,  and  36  months.
The participation rate was 9% of smokers across the six sites.

Okechukwu  2009  targeted  apprentices  in  the  US  building  trades,
with  a  four-month  multi-pronged  programme  based  on  group
counselling,  supplemented  by  free  NRT,  self-help  materials  and
environmental  cues  (posters,  support  materials).  The  smoking
cessation component was integrated with training in work-related
toxic hazards. The outcome was self-reported abstinence at least
six months from the end of the intervention.

b) Multiple-outcome comprehensive workplace programmes

Thirteen 
evaluated  multiple-outcome  workplace
programmes,  i.e.  targeting  several  health  indicators,  including
smoking,  for  risk  reduction  (Kornitzer  1980;  Shi  1992;  Glasgow
1995; Sorensen 1996; Sorensen 1998; Emmons 1999; Nilsson 2001;

Campbell  2002;  Sorensen  2002;  Sorensen  2007;  Bergstrom  2008;
Prochaska 2008; Milani 2009).

In  the  Belgian  Heart  Disease  Prevention  Project,  Kornitzer  1980
cluster-randomized  30  paired  Belgian  factories  to  intervention  or
control  conditions,  with  all  male  workers  aged  40  to  59  eligible
to  take  part.  All  intervention  participants  were  screened  for
cardiovascular  risk  factors  (blood  pressure,  serum  cholesterol,
weight,  smoking  and  physical  activity),  and  were  given  written
advice to reduce their risks. The screening results were also passed
on to participants' family and workplace doctors. The two deciles
with  the  highest  risk  score  were  ranked  as  the  high  risk  group,
and additionally received six-monthly physician advice and testing.
At  the  environmental  level,  anti-smoking  posters  were  regularly
displayed, and each intervention factory held a conference on the
dangers of tobacco use. A five per cent sample of the intervention
group  were  re-assessed  annually.  In  the  15  control  factories  a
random  10%  sample  were  fully  assessed  at  baseline,  and  then
followed  throughout  the  trial.  Within  that  group  a  20%  high-
risk  group  was  identified  and  compared  throughout  with  their
intervention  counterparts.  The  participation  rate  was  83.7%  (n  =
16,230).

The  HealthWise  Stepped  Intervention  Study  (Shi  1992)  allocated
nine North Californian worksites belonging to Pacific Gas & Electric
to  four  intervention  levels.  The  seven  sites  allocated  to  levels  1
to  3  were  randomly  assigned,  while  the  two  smallest  sites  were
allocated to Intervention level 4, in order to minimize the running
costs of the trial. The trial lacked a no-treatment control site. The
interventions ranged incrementally from Health Risk Assessments
(HRAs) at the start and finish of the trial with a bimonthly health
newsletter  at  Level  1,  through  the  addition  of  a  Health  Resource
Centre and self-care books at Level 2 sites, behavioural workshops
and a social support team at Level 3, to an environmental smoking
policy and a case management programme for the high-risk group
(the 15% with the highest overall risk score) at Level 4. Outcomes
were  measured  by  cross-sectional  HRAs  at  baseline  and  at  two-
year follow-up, and included smoking, drinking and speeding. The
participation rate was 69% at baseline and 48% at follow-up.

The  'Take  Heart'  study  (Glasgow  1995)  evaluated  the  short-term
effects of a low-intensity heart disease risk reduction programme,
targeting  smoking,  dietary  intake  and  cholesterol.  Twenty-six
workplaces with between 125 and 750 employees were randomly
assigned  to  early  or  delayed  intervention.  Early  intervention
consisted of an 18-month multi-faceted programme that featured
an  employee  steering  committee  and  a  menu  approach  to
intervention activities tailored to each site.

The  Working  Well  Trial  (Sorensen  1996)  used  a  randomized
matched-pair design, with the workplace as the unit of assignment
and  analysis  in  108  workplaces,  with  an  average  of  316  workers
per site. The intervention targeted individuals and the workplace
environment,  and  included  dietary  habits  (all  four  study  centres)
as  well  as  smoking  (three  of  the  four  centres).  Each  centre  also
addressed one additional risk factor; these included occupational
exposure to carcinogens, exercise, cancer screening, and smokeless
tobacco.

Nested  within  the  Working  Well  Trial,  and  based  at  the
Massachusets  study  centre,  was  the  WellWorks  Study  (Sorensen
1998),  a  randomized  matched-pair  trial  in  24  workplaces.  The
two-year  intervention,  aimed  at  changing  dietary  and  smoking

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

habits, integrated health promotion and health protection through
joint  worker-management  participation  in  programme  planning
and  implementation,  consultation  on  workplace  changes,  and
educational  programmes  targeting  health  behaviour  change,
including  smoking  cessation.  This  study  particularly  addressed
differences  in  behaviour  change  between  white-collar  and  blue-
collar workers.

Another  study  within  the  Working  Well  Trial  was  the  Working
Healthy  Project  (Emmons  1999).  The  Brown  University  study
centre developed an extended programme within its 26 worksites
(reduced  eventually  to  22),  similar  in  aims  and  scope  to  the
parent  trial  but  including  physical  activity  as  a  target  objective,
and following a cohort rather than assessment by cross-sectional
surveys. The control sites received a minimal self-help programme
of  two  smoking  cessation  courses  and  one  each  of  nutrition  and
exercise, for those sites that wished to implement them.

A Swedish study (Nilsson 2001) reported the effects of a long-term
comprehensive  programme  of  lifestyle  interventions,  including
smoking  cessation,  to  reduce  risk  factors  for  cardiovascular
disease.  This  randomized  controlled  trial  for  at-risk  public  sector
employees  also  targeted  body  mass 
index,  diastolic  blood
pressure, heart rate, low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol. The
intervention  group  received  individual  counselling  as  well  as  16
annual  group  sessions,  using  lectures,  discussions,  videos  and
outdoor  activities;  the  control  group  received  standard  oral  and
written advice about cardiovascular risk reduction at the beginning
of the trial, and nothing subsequently. Smoking point prevalence
was assessed at 12- and at 18-months follow-up.

The  Health  Works  for  Women  trial  (Campbell  2002)  developed
a  two-pronged  approach  to  helping  rural  blue-collar  women
workers  to  improve  their  diet  and  physical  activity  levels,  and
to  stop  smoking.  The  programme  was  a  combination  of  tailored
'magazines'  at  baseline  and  at  six  months,  personalized  for
the  characteristics  and  preferences  of  each  participant,  and
social  support  at  work  from  volunteer  'natural  helpers'.  The
smoking intervention was incompletely delivered, however, as no
lay  helpers  were  willing  to  be  trained  to  deliver  the  personal
support.  The  control  group  received  a  minimal  intervention  (one
personalized  magazine)  at  six  months,  with  no  offer  of  social
support.  Randomization  was  by  worksite.  The  participation  rate
was 73% at baseline.

Based on the WellWorks Study, WellWorks-2 (Sorensen 2002) was
a block-randomized controlled trial of 15 workplaces, all handling
hazardous chemicals. The intervention and aims of the study were
very  similar  to  the  original  WellWorks  Project,  being  primarily
health  promotion  and  protection,  but  follow-up  was  only  to  six
months.  Like  its  parent  project,  WellWorks-2  targeted  differences
between  white-  and  blue-collar  workers,  and  concentrated  on
smoking  and  nutrition;  an  additional  outcome  of  interest  in  this
study was changes in perceived hazard exposure.

The  Tools  for  Health  study  (Sorensen  2007)  targeted  American
construction workers, on the basis that they represented a transient
population who tended not to benefit from workplace occupational
health provision. Six hundred and seventy-four workers, contacted
through  their  trade  union,  completed  a  baseline  survey  on  their
smoking  and  their  consumption  of  fruit  and  vegetables.  The
intervention  consisted  of  tailored  phone-based  counselling  (up
to  four  calls  over  three  months),  mailed  tailored  feedback,  six

targeted  mailings  of  educational  materials,  and  NRT  for  those
who  requested  it.  At  six  months,  582  participants  (including  188
smokers) completed the follow-up survey, giving an attrition rate of
13.6%.

Another Swedish study (Bergstrom 2008) allocated four companies
in  the  paper,  steel  and  truck  manufacturing  industries  to  a  3½-
year comprehensive lifestyle programme to reduce risks of COPD,
asthma  and  cardiovascular  disease,  and  to  target  neck  and  back
pain, alcohol, and absenteeism. The whole programme was offered
three  times  over  the  course  of  the  study.  'High-risk'  individuals
were offered inpatient rehabilitation courses based on behavioural
approaches, while those deemed to be at moderate risk were given
smoking  cessation  information  and  the  offer  of  NRT  by  medical
staff  at  the  occupational  health  service.  A  'reference'  company
acted as the control. Evaluation became problematic, as individual
companies  often  set  up  their  own  health  promotion  activities,
including 'stop smoking' support groups.

Prochaska 2008 aimed to compare the effect of three approaches
(motivational 
interviewing,  an  online  transtheoretical  model
(Prochange  Lifestyle  Management  Programs),  and  a  health  risk

intervention (HRI)) on four risk factors (inactivity, BMI, stress and
smoking)  in  a  worksite  sample.  We  focus  here  on  the  smoking
interventions,  and  compare  the  HRI-alone  arm  with  the  HRI  plus
motivational  interviewing  arm.  The  outcome  was  progression
through  the  stages  of  change,  but  also  reported  six-month  quit
rates, although without end-of-study denominators.

Milani  2009  was  a  six-month  comprehensive  cardiovascular  risk
reduction  programme  in  New  Orleans,  USA,  targeting  nutrition,
smoking,  and  physical  activity  in  employees  and  their  spouses.
The  basis  for  inclusion  was  coverage  by  employer-sponsored
healthcare insurance. Smoking was addressed in the intervention
site  by  referral  to  a  group  counselling  programme  for  smoking
cessation.  Participants  who  achieved  milestones  were  rewarded
with extra vacation days and "other job-related perks". Outcomes
were  assessed  at  one  year,  including  any  cost  savings  to  the
company.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Some  randomized  studies  aim  to  intervene  with  the  workplace
as  a  whole.  They  use  a  cluster-randomized  design,  allocating
entire workplaces to conditions. Such studies should be analysed
at  the  level  of  the  cluster  rather  than  the  individual.  When
workplaces are the unit of allocation, but results are presented for
individual quitters, the assumption that outcomes are independent
is  violated,  since  people  in  the  same  site  may  be  more  like  one
another  than  expected  by  chance.  If  the  analysis  ignores  the
clustering,  the  confidence  intervals  are  likely  to  be  too  narrow
(Bland  1997).  The  effect  is  greater  if  there  are  a  small  number
of  large  clusters.  Cluster-randomized  studies  with  individual
outcomes  also  present  problems  related  to  the  choice  of  an
appropriate  denominator.  The  number  of  smokers  who  attend
group meetings or use self-help materials is considerably smaller
than  the  total  number  of  smokers  in  a  workplace.  In  cluster-
randomized studies the denominator chosen for the analysis may
be  all  smokers,  smokers  who  express  interest  in  treatment,  or
those who attend sessions. If the intervention involves individual
cessation  treatment,  then  trials  focus  on  the  outcome  in  the
group  of  attenders.  If  the  intervention  includes  other  changes
to  the  workplace  environment,  for  example  the  introduction  of
restrictions on smoking, it is reasonable to assess the impact on the
smoking workforce as a whole.

Eleven  of  the  included  studies  (19%)  reported  randomization
procedures  in  sufficient  detail  to  be  rated  as  adequate  for  their
attempts  to  control  selection  bias.  The  majority  of  included
studies  (67%)  either  did  not  describe  how  randomization  was
performed or reported in insufficient detail to determine whether
a  satisfactory  attempt  to  control  selection  bias  had  been  made.
Eight  studies  (14%)  either  failed  to  randomize  appropriately  or
did  not  use  a  randomized  trial  design  at  all.  In  two  studies
(Sutton  1987;  Sutton  1988e)  a  few  control  group  subjects  were
allowed to move into the intervention group. One study (Li 1984)
modified its randomization procedure partway through the study
and was also obliged to reconstitute its experimental and control
groups  to  accommodate  physicians  who  did  not  comply  with
the  protocol;  Shi  1992  and  Gomel  1993a  allocated  smaller  or
fewer  worksites  to  the  most  expensive  interventions  in  order  to
keep  trial  costs  down.  Gomel  1993a  also  reported  some  level  of
contamination  between  conditions  as  staff  moved  from  station
to  station.  Schröter  2006  compromised  the  distinction  between
the  experimental  and  control  group  interventions,  by  applying
'rescue' relapse prevention techniques to members of the standard
behavioural  group  when  necessary.  Prochaska  2008  reported

six-month  quit  rates,  but  without  the  relevant  denominators.
Okechukwu 2009 warned that there may have been contamination
between  intervention  and  control  cohorts,  since  randomization
was by the union training base but apprentices from different bases
could  sometimes  have  worked  together  on  the  same  worksites.
Hishida 2010 reported that unexpectedly high cessation rates in the
control  group  may  have  been  associated  with  concurrent  health
promotion legislation to prevent passive smoking in the workplace.

Two Japanese studies (Shimizu 1999; Terazawa 2001) are included
on the basis of data derived from the abstracts alone.

The  'gold  standard'  outcome  for  smoking  cessation  studies  is
biochemical  validation  of  self-reported  cessation  (i.e.  testing  of
saliva,  blood,  urine  samples  or  exhaled  breath  for  evidence  of
recent smoking). This generally results in lower rates of cessation,
due  not  only  to  people  misreporting  their  smoking,  but  also  to
relapsing, or refusing to provide samples for other reasons. Using
validation may not change the relative effect of the intervention,
since  similar  levels  of  misreporting  are  likely  to  be  seen  in  the
control condition as well, unless no intervention at all is provided
to  the  control.  Of  the  55  studies  in  which  intervention  was
provided to individuals, 41 (66%) used some form or combination
of  biochemical  verification  procedures  for  at  least  one  follow-up
point. These included butt counts, carbon monoxide ((CO) in 47%
of the included studies), salivary thiocyanate and urinary, blood or
salivary cotinine.

In  assessing  the  potential  impact  of  workplace  interventions  it
is  important  to  know  the  proportion  of  smokers  who  can  be
recruited to different types of intervention, whilst recognizing that
some  barriers  to  recruitment  to  trials  may  not  be  relevant  to
real  settings.  In  some  of  the  studies  included  here  the  use  of  a
workplace population would appear to have been largely a matter
of convenience for ease of recruitment. These studies have typically
not  reported  on  the  proportion  of  the  smoking  workforce  who
participated. Where studies have calculated the participation rate
we  have  recorded  this  in  the  Characteristics  of  included  studies
table. The participation rates in the studies included here ranged
from 9% to 88%.

Only  two  of  this  group  of  10  trials  described  the  method
of  randomization  in  sufficient  detail  to  exclude  the  possibility
of  allocation  bias:  in  Omenn  1988  allocation  was  based  on
randomized  assignment  lists,  while  Razavi  1999  used  random
numbers concealed by a label. Four studies (Klesges 1987; DePaul
1994;  Mayer  2010;  Mishra  2010)  used  cluster  randomization,  and
Gunes  2007  assembled  matched  cohorts  of  intervention  and
control  participants,  based  on  shifts  worked,  i.e.  quasi-cluster-
randomized. All of the trials except Schröter 2006, and Gunes 2007
used biochemical validation of self-reported smoking status. Two
studies (Omenn 1988; DePaul 1994) used saliva cotinine, one study
(Frank 1986) used saliva thiocyanate and one (Klesges 1987) used
both  saliva  thiocyanate  and  expired  air  carbon  monoxide.  Two
studies  (Glasgow  1984;  Mishra  2010)  used  expired  air  CO  alone,
and two studies (Razavi 1999; Mayer 2010) used a combination of
expired CO and urinary cotinine.

INDIVIDUAL

in  this  group 

Only  two  of  the  eight  studies 
(Kadowaki
2000;  Groeneveld  2011)  adequately  described  the  method  of
randomization.  Three  trials  (Cambien  1981;  Gomel  1993a;  Lang
2000) used cluster randomization. Five studies used CO assessment
for  validation  of  self-reported  cessation,  with  Lang  2000  using
partial validation, as several workplace physicians had no access to
a carbon monoxide monitor. Gomel 1993a used serum cotinine to
validate smoking status at all assessment points, and Windsor 1988
used  salivary  cotinine  testing.  Only  Groeneveld  2011  relied  upon
self report, without any biochemical validation.

3. Self-help interventions

Among  this  group  of  six  studies,  none  described  the  method  of
randomization.  All  except  Hishida  2010  validated  their  cessation
rates, the Sutton studies with expired air CO, and Omenn 1988 with
salivary cotinine.

4. Pharmacological therapy

Three studies described adequate randomization procedures, for
a  placebo-controlled  double-blind  trial  (Kornitzer  1995;  Noor
2011)  and  an  open-label  randomized  controlled  trial  (Rodriguez
2003). The remaining two studies allowed movement between the
intervention  and  control  groups  (Sutton  1987;  Sutton  1988e).  All
five studies validated self reports of cessation, using expired air CO
to verify smoking status. Noor 2011 collected end-of-trial cotinine
samples from all participants, whether abstinent or not, but failed
to analyse the urine samples because of technical problems at the
laboratory.

5. Social support for not smoking

Neither  study  (Malott  1984;  Glasgow  1986)  gave  randomization
details or participation rates. Self-reported cessation was validated
in both studies using expired air CO and quantity of cigarette butts.
The Glasgow study also monitored saliva cotinine.

GROUP 2: INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT THE WORKPLACE AS A
WHOLE:

6. Environmental support for not smoking

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Three of the four studies in this group employed a clustered design,
with Tanaka 2006 allocating sites non-randomly to intervention or
control  in  a  matched-pair  design.  Two  of  the  cluster-randomized
trials (Dawley 1991; Hymowitz 1991) analysed by individual, while
the third (Erfurt 1991) used the workplace as the unit of analysis.
There was no biochemical validation of self-reported cessation in
Erfurt  1991  or  Tanaka  2006.  Dawley  1991  reported  validation  by
urinary cotinine and Hymowitz 1991 by expired air CO.

7. Incentives

Details  of  Gomel  1993a  are  reported  under  the  Individual

Windsor  1988  described  randomization  using  a  computer-
generated  assignment  system  in  numbered  envelopes.  Glasgow
1993 was described as cluster-randomized with both the workplace
and  the  individual  used  as  the  units  of  analysis.  Rand  1989  gave
no details of randomization. The SUCCESS Project (Hennrikus 2002)
was described as a 3x2 factorial study, with workplaces randomly
assigned  to  the  six  treatment  options,  but  stratified  by  gender
and  education  level.  No  details  of  randomization  were  offered.
Volpp  2009  randomized  in  permuted  blocks  of  four,  stratified  by
site, income and level of smoking (more or less than 40 per day).
Assignments were concealed in this trial until after allocation, but
not thereafter. All six studies reported biochemical validation, using
saliva  thiocyanate  (Windsor  1988;  Hennrikus  2002;  Volpp  2009),
serum  cotinine  (Gomel  1993a),  urine  if  on  NRT  (Volpp  2009),  or
carbon monoxide (Rand 1989) and carbon monoxide plus cotinine
(Glasgow 1993).

8. Comprehensive approach

No  details  of  randomization  were  given,  apart  from  Okechukwu
2009,  who  used  a  random  number  generator.  Bergstrom  2008,
Tanaka  2006  and  Willemsen  1998  allocated  the  worksites  non-
randomly  to  intervention  or  control  status.  Fourteen  of  the  20
studies employed a cluster-randomized design, while Nilsson 2001
aggregated  its  participants  from  four  public  sector  workplaces
within  the  same  district.  Non-validated  self-reported  smoking
cessation  was  recorded  in  14  studies,  partial  or  complete  saliva
cotinine  validation  in  two  studies  (DePaul  1987;  DePaul  1989),
and  CO  in  Shimizu  1999  and  Campbell  2002.  Sorensen  1993  at
six  months  and  Willemsen  1998  at  four  months  collected  saliva
cotinines,  but  did  not  test  them  (the  'bogus  pipeline'  principle).
Willemsen 1998 did, however, collect and test cotinine samples for
52% of self-reported quitters at the 14-month follow-up.

For  this  update,  we  have  conducted  meta-analyses  of  the
main  classes  of  intervention.  Where  there  was  more  than  one
intervention arm, we have compared the control group (minimal
or  no  intervention)  with  the  next  simplest  treatment.  Although
this  may  occasionally  underestimate  the  trial's  true  efficacy  over
multiple interventions, we avoid the risks of overstating the effect
of the treatment or of tipping a result into significance by forcing
a binary comparison that does not reflect the true findings of the
trial.  Studies  treated  selectively  in  this  way  include  DePaul  1994,

We have also produced a Results table (Analysis 3.1), which gives
details of types of participants, follow-up, smoking outcomes and

GROUP I: INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT THE INDIVIDUAL TO
PROMOTE SMOKING CESSATION

1. Intensive behavioural intervention: GROUP COUNSELLING

Eight trials (1309 participants) of worksite-based group behavioural
therapy  interventions  for  smoking  cessation  demonstrated  a
benefit for the counselling programmes, with an odds ratio (OR) of
1.71 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 2.80; Analysis 1.1.1). There
was no statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0%).

Within  this  category,  two  trials  of  relapse  prevention  using
group-based  therapy  (484  participants)  found  no  benefit  for  the
programmes: OR 1.15 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.65); Analysis 1.1.2.

Glasgow 1984 showed that at six months one-third of participants
in  the  gradual  condition  were  abstinent  compared  to  no
participants  in  the  abrupt  condition.  However,  in  this  small
sample the result was not statistically significant. This study also
targeted  smoking  reduction  as  a  valid  outcome,  and  47%  of
participants stated that they wished to reduce their consumption.
Reducers  were  found  to  have  been  successful  for  each  of  the
target behaviours as they addressed them, without compensatory
increases  in  the  other  two  behaviours.  Achieved  reductions  were
statistically  significant  (P  values  from  0.001  to  <  0.02).  Mean
reduction  in  nicotine  content  was  50%,  in  percentage  of  each
cigarette  smoked  34%  and  in  number  of  cigarettes  smoked
28%.  Carbon  monoxide  (CO)  levels  were  28%  lower  on  average,
suggesting  that  participants  were  not  compensating  for  the
behavioural changes. All but one participant improved on at least
two measures, and 46% on all four variables. At six-month follow-
up, reducers maintained all the changes except for percentage of
the cigarette smoked, with both abrupt and gradual plus feedback
participants relapsing on this measure (P < 0.05).

Frank  1986,  testing  combinations  of  behavioural  support  and
hypnotic sessions, showed no long-term differences between any
treatment variants.

Klesges  1987,  testing  both  a  relapse  prevention  component  and
a  competition  in  a  factorial  design,  failed  to  detect  evidence  for
a  long-term  benefit  of  either.  At  the  immediate  post-test,  the
competition intervention resulted in higher quit rates (39% versus
16%, P < 0.004) but these differences were minimal at six months
(12%  versus  11%,  NS).  The  six-month  differences  for  relapse
prevention  were  in  the  expected  direction  but  not  statistically
significant (15% versus 8%), although the competition appeared to
increase short-term quit rates.

Omenn  1988  showed  non-significant  trends  towards  higher  quit
rates for groups than for self-help controls. The three Group arms

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

achieved  12-month  validated  quit  rates  of  16%  for  the  multiple
component arm, 18% for the relapse prevention arm and 8% for the
minimal treatment arm (NS).

In DePaul 1994 at 12 months, the self-help participants achieved a
sustained abstinence rate of 5.1%, the incentives participants 11%,
and the group participants 31.2% (P < 0.01).

Schröter 2006 found that participants in the standard behavioural
(SB)  programme  were  more  successful  than  those  who  received
relapse prevention (RP) support (21.1% continuously abstinent at
12  months  versus  12.2%).  They  speculated  that  this  unexpected
finding  might  be  attributable  to  the  emphasis  in  the  RP  group
on  the  likelihood  of  failure,  but  also  noted  that  SB  participants
had received relapse prevention 'rescue' support when necessary,
which  may  have  compromised  the  separation  between  the  two
interventions.

Gunes 2007 reported a non-significant difference in the six-month
quit rate between the intervention and control groups (6% versus
2%, P = 0.14). The primary outcome of interest for this study was
movement  through  stages  of  change,  and  for  this  measure  the
intervention  group  achieved  significantly  lower  numbers  in  'pre-
contemplation' and higher numbers in the 'preparation' stages at
six months, but this did not translate into higher quit rates within
the time scale of the trial.

Mishra  2010  demonstrated  a  benefit  for  counselling  and  focus
groups  over  self-help  materials  alone  at  12  months,  with  an
intervention quit rate of 20% compared to 6% in the control group
(P = 0.03). The two incrementally more intensive arms (+ individual
counselling,  and  +  bupropion  if  wished)  achieved  similar  results,
with  12-month  quit  rates  of  19%  (P  =  0.06)  and  20%  (P  =  0.03)
respectively.

For the two relapse prevention studies, Mayer 2010 did not detect
an advantage at nine months for the proactive phone counselling
(57.5% remained quit) over the worksite-based group programme
(61.7% remained quit, P = 0.552). Predictors of higher abstinence
included a lower BSI-GSI score, lower levels of urinary cotinine, and
having to pay EUR 50 for the programme.

The  Belgian  relapse  prevention  study  (Razavi  1999)  found
differences  between  psychologist-supported  quitters  (43.7%  still
abstinent  at  12  months),  ex-smoker-supported  quitters  (37.5%)
and  no  formal  support  quitters  (35.5%),  but  these  did  not  reach
statistical significance.

Cambien 1981 found that at two-year follow up 21.4% (65/304) of
smokers in the intervention group had quit, compared with 13.4%
(41/306) in the control group. Although the descriptive forest plot
suggests  that  this  result  was  statistically  significant,  the  authors
report that it was not. The result does not take account of the 195
participants lost to follow-up, and the authors observe that those
lost  to  follow-up  from  the  intervention  group  were  significantly
heavier  smokers  than  the  follow-up  attenders  (P  <  0.01)  or  the
control participants.

Li  1984  found  that  at  11  months  smokers  given  behavioural
counselling from a physician were more likely to remain abstinent
(8.4%)  than  those  with  a  minimal  warning  (3.6%,  P  <  0.05).
Prolonged abstinence rates did not differ between participants with
abnormal lung function tests (3.7%) and normal lung function tests
(5.9%).

Windsor  1988:  As  the  two  incentive  arms  of  the  trial  did  not
detect any significant benefit for the payment schemes, the authors
collapsed  the  incentive  and  no-incentive  groups  together  in  the
analysis to test the efficacy of adding counselling and social support
to  self-help  materials.  This  comparison  yielded  a  cessation  rate
of 5.8% (11/190) at 12 months for the combined self-help groups,
compared with 14.4% (27/188) for the self help with counselling and
social support combined groups (P < 0.001).

Gomel  1993a  did  not  find  significant  differences  in  continuous
abstinence rates between any of the four groups (HRA, RFE, BC and
BCI)  at  six  or  12  months.  However,  when  the  authors  pooled  the
HRA group with RFE (n = 68 smokers) and BC group with BCI (n =
60 smokers) to test the efficacy of the counselling component, they
detected  statistically  significant  differences  in  abstinence  rates.
At  six  months,  the  combined  HRA/RFE  group  had  a  continuous
abstinence rate of 1%, compared with 10% for the BC/BCI pooled
group (Fisher's Exact Test P = 0.05); 12-month rates were 0% and
7% respectively (P = 0.05). The authors report that contamination
between  the  intervention  groups  and  low  participation  rates
among the RFE stations meant that the effect size of the whole trial
may have been compromised.

Kadowaki  2000  found  cessation  rates  of  12.9%  and  3.1%  in  the
intervention  and  control  groups  respectively  (P  =  0.003).  Among
those  who  succeeded  in  quitting  48.6%  maintained  cessation  at
18-month follow-up. Overall the cessation rate was 8.4% after 22
months and the prevalence of male smokers had decreased from
62.9 to 56.7% (P = 0.038).

Lang  2000  found  point  prevalence  quit  rates  of  18.4%  in  the
intensive  group  compared  to  13.5%  in  the  minimal  intervention
group at one year (P = 0.03). Self-reported sustained cessation of six
months and more was reported in 6.1% of the intervention group
compared with 4.6% of the comparison group (P = 0.26).

Terazawa  2001  detected  a  point  prevalence  cessation  rate  of
11.1% (13/117) at 12 months in the intervention group, compared
with 1.8% (2/111) in the control group. Twelve-month continuous
abstinence rates were 6.8% (8/117) and 0.9% (1/111) respectively
(Fisher's Exact 2-tailed Test P = 0.04 [our calculation]). Only 25 of the
117 counselled smokers in the intervention group agreed to make
a quit attempt and would therefore have received the four follow-
up phone calls.

The HIPOP-OHP study (Tanaka 2006) detected a steady rise in quit
rates  in  both  the  intervention  and  control  worksites  over  the  36-
month assessment period. They report final quit rates of 12.1% in
the intervention sites versus 9.4% for the controls (P = 0.021), but
this  is  based  only  on  those  who  responded  at  both  baseline  and
at final follow-up. An intention-to-treat analysis yields quit rates of
8.9% and 7.0% respectively (P = 0.046 [our calculation]).

Groeneveld  2011  found  that  a  statistically  significant  benefit  at
six months (31.3% versus 13.4%) was not sustained to 12 months

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

(23.7%  versus  19.5%;  P  =  0.45).  The  intervention  was  more
successful in older participants (> 45 years) at both time points.

3. Self-help programmes

trials 

(1906  participants)  of  worksite-based  self-help
Six 
interventions  demonstrated  no  clear  benefit  for  the  self-help
programmes, with an OR of 1.16 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.82; Analysis 1.3).
There was no statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0%).

Omenn  1988,  discussed  earlier  in  the  group  counselling  section,
reported  that  the  self-help  arms  achieved  12-month  validated
cessation rates of 9% for the multiple component arm, 11% for the
relapse  prevention  arm,  and  6%  for  the  minimal  treatment  arm
(NS).

Video studies
The four studies of minimal video interventions with control groups
(Sutton  1988a;  Sutton  1988b;  Sutton  1988c;  Sutton  1988d)  failed
to  detect  a  difference  in  validated  abstinence  rates  between  the
video groups, although the second study (Sutton 1988b) detected a
difference between the video groups and the non-participant group
(P  <  0.05).  This  study,  however,  included  younger  smokers  who
smoked more heavily than participants in the other three studies.
Another finding of the first of the studies (Sutton 1988a) was of more
smokers trying to stop in the intervention group than in the control
group  (P  <  0.05),  but  in  that  study  the  'control'  video  concerned
seatbelts, whereas the 'control' videos in the other three studies all
related in some way to tobacco.

Genotyping information studies

Hishida 2010 found a higher quit rate among the controls (baseline
information, plus observation only, 8.0%) at 12 months than in the
intervention  group  (baseline  information,  then  genotyped,  5.8%;
P  =  0.34).  Although  the  authors  offer  concurrent  anti-smoking
legislation  as  a  possible  confounder  to  account  for  this,  it  is  not
clear  why  that  would  have  impacted  the  control  group  more
heavily than the intervention group. Comparisons by genotype also
detected no significant differences, with quit rates of 5.6% and 7.1%
in  the  LS  and  SS  (high-risk)  groups  respectively  versus  4.9%  (P  =
0.723) in the LL (low-risk) group.

4. Pharmacological therapy

interventions  demonstrated  a  benefit

Sutton 1987 reported one-year continuous abstinence rates of 12%
among those allocated to nicotine gum and 2% among the control
group (no P value given). If an intention-to-treat analysis (i.e. based
on all randomized participants) is performed on these data, the quit
rate drops to 7.8% for the intervention group at 12 months.

Sutton 1988e reported validated one-year abstinence rates of 22%
in those receiving nicotine gum compared with 2% in the control
group (P < 0.001). An intention-to-treat analysis of these data would
yield an intervention quit rate of 10.1% (8/79). The more rigorous
'complete'  abstinence  rates  (i.e.  no  smoking  of  any  kind  up  to
follow-up assessment) are 6.3% (5/79) for the intervention group
and 2.4% (2/82) for the controls.

In  Kornitzer  1995  the  three  treatment  groups  (Group  1:  active
nicotine patch and active gum; Group 2: active nicotine patch and
placebo gum; Group 3: placebo patch and placebo gum) achieved
12-month abstinence rates in Group 1, 2 and 3 of 18.1%, 12.7% and
13.3% respectively (P = 0.19). ORs comparing Groups 1 and 2 at 12
months (OR 1.47, CI 0.76 to 2.78, P = 0.125), and comparing Groups
2 and 3 (OR 0.96, no further details) were not significant. Time to
relapse was longer in Group 1 compared with the other two groups
(P = 0.04).

Rodriguez  2003  detected  a  12-month  CO-validated  continuous
abstinence  rate  of  20.2%  (23/114)  in  the  intervention  group,
compared with 8.7% (9/103) among the controls. This gave an OR of
2.58 (95% CI 1.13 to 5.90, P = 0.025). These results are based on an
intention-to-treat analysis, except for one death in the intervention
group.

Noor  2011  found  a  higher  rate  of  continuous  abstinence  (weeks
4  to  24)  in  the  intervention  than  in  the  control  group;  25.3%
versus 12.5%, P = 0.04. Although point prevalence abstinence was
biochemically validated, the continuous abstinence rates were not.

5. Social support for not smoking

Two  trials  (53  participants)  of  worksite-based  social  support
interventions demonstrated no benefit for the programmes, with
an  OR  of  0.69  (95%  CI  0.18  to  2.62;  Analysis  1.5).  There  was  no
statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0%).

Two  studies  of  social  support  (Malott  1984;  Glasgow  1986)  found
no  difference  with  the  addition  of  this  component  to  a  basic
programme  of  group  counselling  and  support.  Both  studies  also
defined  smoking  reduction  as  an  outcome  of  interest,  in  which
participants could choose to attempt either complete cessation or
reduction of smoking. In the earlier study (Malott 1984) the authors
note  that  among  non-abstainers,  at  six  months  follow-up  the
Controlled Smoking (CS) Group daily consumption of nicotine was
0.52 mg compared with Controlled Smoking + Partner Support (CS
+PS) Group's consumption of 0.45 mg. Average number of cigarettes
per  day  at  six  months  follow-up  was  CS:21.5,  compared  with  CS
+PS: 20.1. In both conditions, participants relapsed on number of
cigarettes smoked (P < 0.05). In addition, CS participants relapsed
on nicotine content (P < 0.05), and CS+PS relapsed on percentage
of cigarette smoked (P < 0.01). Neither group relapsed on CO levels,
and  non-abstinent  smokers  in  both  groups  were  smoking  less  at
follow-up than they had been before treatment.

In Glasgow 1986 no differences in outcome were detected between
the  two  groups  of  reducers  (Basic  Programme  [BP]  and  Basic
Programme + Social Support [BP+SS]). Both groups at six months
had achieved reductions in nicotine (BP: 0.90 to 0.49; BP+SS: 0.78
to  0.49,  P  <  0.05  for  both).  Number  of  cigarettes  per  day  was
reduced  in  both  groups  (BP:  20.5  to  18.3;  BP+SS:  27.7  to  24.4),
but  was  statistically  significantly  higher  than  at  immediate  post-
test.  The  same  pattern  applied  to  percentage  of  each  cigarette
smoked, although the BP+SS group six-month rate was still lower
(P  <  0.05)  than  pre-test  levels  (BP:  83.3  to  74.8;  BP+SS:  89.0  to
81.2).  Carbon  monoxide  levels  followed  the  same  pattern,  while
saliva thiocyanate levels were higher at six-month follow-up than
at baseline. As with cessation, this study offered no evidence that
social support enhanced sustained reduction.

GROUP 2: INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT THE WORKSITE AS A WHOLE

6. Environmental support for not smoking

Four  trials  (3851  participants)  of  worksite-based  environmental
the  environmental
support  demonstrated  no  benefit 
programmes, with an OR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.65; Analysis 2.1).
There was no statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0%).

for 

In  Dawley  1991  at  five  months  the  abstinence  rate  at  the
environmental  intervention  site  was  twice  that  of  the  cessation-
only site (43% versus 21%, no P value given).

Erfurt 1991 compared the effects of four interventions: (1) wellness
screening;  (2)  wellness  screening  plus  health  education;  (3)  as
2,  plus  follow-up  counselling;  and  (4)  as  3,  plus  peer  support
groups, buddy systems, health promotion classes, and plant-wide
activities.  In  each  group  there  was  a  reduction  in  the  prevalence
of  smoking  over  three  years,  and  the  smoking  prevalence  at
three  years  was  lower  for  interventions  3  and  4  compared  with
interventions 1 and 2 (P < 0.01), although this difference depended
on  combining  the  1985  smokers  with  the  then  ex-smokers.
Interventions 3 and 4 recorded slightly higher quit rates (20.3% and
18.9% respectively) than interventions 1 and 2 (17.1% and 17.6%
respectively) among employees who were smoking at baseline, but
the difference was not statistically significant, and may have been
compromised by differences in baseline.

Hymowitz 1991 failed to detect an effect of environmental support.
Twelve-month quit rates were 22% for physician counselling and
group  support  alone,  and  18%  for  the  same  support  with  an
'enriched milieu'.

Tanaka  2006  found  that  quit  rates  in  both  groups  rose  steadily
over  36  months  of  follow-up.  Six-month  sustained  abstinence  at
36 months (ITT analysis) was 8.9% for the intervention sites versus
7.0% for the controls (P = 0.0467).

7. Incentives

(1928  participants)  of  worksite-based 

Five  trials 
incentive
interventions  demonstrated  a  benefit  for  payment  or  reward
schedules,  with  an  OR  of  1.60  (95%  CI  1.12  to  2.30;  Analysis  2.2).
There was moderate statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 43%). Hennrikus
2002 did not contribute any analysable data to this comparison.

Our  analysis  of  the  incentives  trials  demonstrates  a  benefit  for
rewards programmes over the control condition. However, a single
study  (Volpp  2009)  contributed  37%  of  the  weight  and  all  of
the  statistical  significance  to  this  analysis;  removing  these  data
reduced  the  OR  to  1.16  (95%  CI  0.73  to  1.83).  But  despite  this
cautionary  note,  we  observe  that  Volpp  2009  was  the  only  study
to  conduct  assessments  and  deliver  rewards  considerably  after
the  cessation  programmes,  when  success  rates  might  have  been
expected to have dissipated. This was a large study conducted and
reported to high standards, and delivering robust findings.

Windsor 1988 failed to detect an effect of monetary incentives on
quit  rates,  with  6/95  achieving  continuous  cessation  in  the  self-
help  group  at  12  months  compared  with  5/95  in  the  self  help
plus incentives group. The corresponding rates for the counselling
groups were 18/94 and 9/94. If anything, the incentive component
appeared to have a negative impact.

Rand  1989  found  that  contingent  payments  delayed  but  did  not
necessarily prevent relapse to smoking. The study failed to detect
an effect on relapse of monitoring and feedback of CO rates.

Glasgow  1993  failed  to  detect  a  difference  between  incentive
and no-incentive conditions across 19 workplaces. There were no
statistically significant differences in self-reported cessation rates
at one year (12.9% for incentives versus 12% for control) or at two
years (18% for incentives versus 15.5% for control).

The SUCCESS Project (Hennrikus 2002; not included in the meta-
analysis)  found  that  programme  recruitment  was  higher  in  the
incentive  sites  (22%  vs  12%,  P  =  0.0054),  but  that  this  did  not
translate  to  higher  cessation  rates.  Although  the  authors  suggest
that  telephone  counselling  appeared  to  be  at  least  as  effective
as  group  programmes,  the  two  types  of  support  seem  to  have
been  offered  at  different  levels  of  intensity,  with  drop-outs  from
group programmes not followed up, while telephone counsellors
routinely made ten contact attempts per session plus messages or
letters to their participants.

Gomel 1993a failed to detect an effect of either individual or group
incentives.  Rewards  appeared  to  have  no  effect,  or  possibly  a
negative impact, with 3/30 smokers continuously abstinent at 12
months in the BC (counselling only) group compared with 1/30 in
the BCI (counselling plus incentives) group, but this difference did
not achieve statistical significance. Other outcomes for this trial are
covered under the Individual Counselling heading.

Volpp 2009 detected a statistically significant benefit of incentives
over  control  conditions,  with  15-  or  18-month  prolonged
abstinence rates of 9.4% versus 3.6% (P = 0.0008) respectively.

The  effectiveness  of  incentives  and  competitions  as  an  aid  to
smoking  cessation  in  any  setting  is  covered  in  another  Cochrane
review (Cahill 2011).

8. Comprehensive programmes

(a) Multiple interventions for smoking cessation:

(5018  participants)  demonstrated  a  benefit 

Six  trials 
for
comprehensive  programmes  aimed  at  smoking  cessation,  with
an  OR  of  1.55  (95%  CI  1.13  to  2.13;  Analysis  2.3.1).  There  was
some heterogeneity (I2 = 30%). Sorensen 1993 did not contribute
analysable data to this comparison.

The  initial  De  Paul  study  (DePaul  1987)  achieved  12-month
sustained cessation rates of 6% for the group participants versus
2%  for  the  self-help  participants  (NS),  with  both  arms  achieving
a  19%  point  prevalence  rate.  It  reported  a  non-significant  trend
towards higher quit rates for groups than for self-help controls.

Willemsen  1998  failed  to  detect  an  effect  of  a  comprehensive
programme. The six-month sustained abstinence rates were 8% in
the comprehensive workplaces and 7% in the minimal-treatment
workplaces.  Among  the  medium  to  heavy  smokers,  prolonged
abstinence rates were 9% for the comprehensive programme and
4% for the minimal programme.

At 12 months, point prevalence for the group participants in DePaul
1989 was 26%, compared with 16% for non-group participants (P <
0.06), with sustained abstinence rates of 11% and 3% respectively
(P < 0.05).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Sorensen 1993 (not included in the meta-analysis) demonstrated
that  at  six-month  follow-up,  12%  of  smokers  in  the  intervention
group reported quitting, compared to 9% in the control group (P <
0.05), with cessation predicted by co-worker requests not to smoke.

A  small  study  (Shimizu  1999)  of  a  multicomponent  programme
including  group  and  individual  counselling  did  not  detect  a
statistically  significant  difference,  with  quit  rates  of  19%  in  the
intervention group and 7% in the control group.

Tanaka  2006  detected  a  six-month  sustained  abstinence  rate  at
36 months of 8.9% (self-reported) for the intervention sites versus
7.0% for the control sites (P = 0.0467). Quit rates in both groups rose
steadily over the three-year course of outcome measurement.

Okechukwu 2009 found that a significantly higher one-month quit
rate in the intervention group had dissipated to a non-significant
difference by six months, at 9% versus 7.2% (P = 0.48). These results
were not biochemically validated, in order to avoid any perceived
association with 'drug-testing', and because such tests might have
been confounded by work-related toxins.

(b) Comprehensive interventions targeting several risk factors,
including smoking

Since only three trials (Glasgow 1995; Prochaska 2008; Milani 2009;
383  participants)  of  the  13  (>  78,000  participants)  in  this  group
offered data for meta-analysis, we decided against pooling these
findings, as they are likely to be unrepresentative and misleading.
We  report  the  results  here  narratively,  and  in  the  Results  Table
Analysis 3.1.

Kornitzer 1980 detected a decline in smoking prevalence of 18.7% in
the high-risk intervention group at two-year follow-up, compared
with a 12.2% drop in the high-risk control group (P < 0.05). A five
per cent sample of all the intervention participants demonstrated a
prevalence decline of 12.5% over two years, which was very close to
the 10% sample control group's decline of 12.6% (non-significant).
The  authors  speculate  that  the  lack  of  face-to-face  counselling
(available only to the high-risk intervention group) may have been
a  significant  factor  in  the  failure  of  the  anti-smoking  campaign.
Stepwise multiple discriminant function analysis among the high-
risk  groups  identified  fewer  cigarettes  smoked  at  baseline,  more
previous quit attempts and the residential area of the country as
significant  predictors  of  quitting  among  the  intervention  group,
and  higher  education  and  more  previous  quit  attempts  among
the  controls.  The  significant  differences  between  intervention
and  control  high-risk  groups  gradually  disappeared  over  the
subsequent four years of the study, due to a combination of less
intensive intervention activity and a spontaneous rise in the control
group's quit rate in line with secular trends.

The  HealthWise  Stepped  Intervention  Study  (Shi  1992)  noted  a
decline  in  smoking  prevalence  at  two-year  follow-up  in  all  four
intervention  levels  (nine  worksites).  Smoking  reduced  in  Level  1
sites by 34%, from 18% to 12%, in Level 2 sites by 18%, from 17% to
14%, in Level 3 sites by 35%, from 24% to 15%, and in Level 4 sites by
44%, from 14% to 8%. All differences were statistically significant at
P < 0.01 level, except for the Level 2 decline which was significant at
the 0.1 level. Outcomes were measured by cross-sectional surveys
rather than cohort analysis, with relatively low participation rates
of 69% at baseline and 48% at follow-up.

The 'Take Heart' study (Glasgow 1995) reported that the early and
delayed intervention groups did not differ on changes in smoking
rates,  dietary  intake  or  cholesterol  levels.  Despite  documented
implementation  of  the  intervention,  there  were  no  short-term
improvements  beyond  secular  trends  also  observed  in  control
workplaces.  Glasgow  1997  (an  excluded  study)  also  reported  the
results  of  'Take  Heart  II'  which  was  non-randomized  but  with
a  matched  quasi-experimental  study  design  similar  to  the  first
'Take  Heart'  trial,  plus  updated  menu  and  added  guidance  for
employee steering committees and implementation. The authors
reported  that  there  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  in
smoking prevalence and smoking cessation between intervention
and control workplaces.

The Working Well Trial (Sorensen 1996) reported a non-significant
1.53% difference between intervention and control workplaces in
six-month smoking cessation rates. Smoking prevalence declined
in intervention sites (from 24.5% to 21.2%) and in control sites (from
25.8% to 21.8%) (NS).

The WellWorks Study (Sorensen 1998) nested within the Working
Well  Trial,  was  a  randomized  controlled  trial,  with  similar  aims
to  its  parent  trial,  but  combining  health  promotion  and  health
protection  interventions,  and  also  targeting  outcome  differences
by  job  category.  Six-month  smoking  abstinence  rates  were  15%
in the intervention workplaces, and 9% in the control workplaces
(P  =  0.123).  We  have  not  used  the  first  analyses  for  this  study,
published  in  1996,  since  these  did  not  include  results  from  the
control workplaces.

At  three-year  follow-up,  the  Working  Healthy  Project  (Emmons
1999)  did  not  detect  significant  differences  between  either  the
seven-day point prevalence quit rates (intervention 25.6% versus
control 21.8%) or the six-month continuous abstinence quit rates
(intervention 8.0% versus control 8.1%).

The  Swedish  trial  of  cardiovascular  risk  reduction  (Nilsson  2001)
detected a decline in smoking prevalence in the intervention group
from 65% to 37% at 12 months, compared with a non-significant
decline  in  the  control  group  from  65%  to  63%.  Prevalence  at  18
months was 40% for the intervention group and 59% for the control
group, and this difference influenced the decrease in the mean risk
score  from  10.3  (standard  deviation  (SD)  1.5)  to  9.0  (SD  2.2,  P  =
0.042).

The  intervention  arm  of  the  Health  Works  for  Women  trial
(Campbell  2002)  had  a  higher  smoking  prevalence  at  baseline
(30%) than the control arm (22%), but only 9% of the intervention
participants  (26%  of  the  current  smokers)  chose  to  concentrate
their efforts on quitting. Both groups reduced their prevalence rate
by about 3% at 18-month follow-up. The intervention for smokers
was  incomplete,  as  no  lay  helpers  were  willing  to  be  trained  to
support  the  smokers  trying  to  quit.  It  is  therefore  not  possible
to  draw  any  meaningful  inferences  from  the  lack  of  a  detectable
difference between the two arms of the trial.

The WellWorks-2 Trial (Sorensen 2002) did not detect a significant
difference  in  point  prevalence  rates  at  six  months  between
intervention and control workplaces (reductions of 4.1% and 1.6%
respectively).  Cohort  analysis  failed  to  detect  an  effect  in  overall
quit  rates  between  intervention  (11.3%)  and  control  workplaces
(7.5%, OR 1.57, P = 0.17).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Sorensen 2007 detected a significant increase in the six-month quit
rate  in  the  intervention  group  compared  with  the  controls  (19%
versus 8%, P = 0.03). This analysis was restricted to the 188 smokers
who completed both the baseline and follow-up surveys, although
the authors reported that an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis also
found a statistically significant benefit of the intervention. The ITT
data were 19 quitters from 125 baseline smokers in the intervention
group (15%), compared with 7 quitters from 106 baseline smokers
in the control group (7%, P = 0.04).

Bergstrom  2008  evaluated  a  3½-year  comprehensive  programme
at  ten  time  points,  including  smoking  cessation  support  by  the
occupational  health  services  for  those  assessed  as  being  at
moderate risk, and referral to inpatient rehabilitation or inpatient
smoking  cessation  for  those  at  high  risk.  All  four  intervention
companies  showed  a  decline  in  smoking  prevalence  compared
with  the  reference  (control)  company;  Companies  1,  2  and  4
demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  decline  (-0.60  (P  <  0.05),
-0.92 (P < 0.01) and -0.45 (P < 0.05) respectively), while the decline
in  Company  3  (-0.09)  was  non-significant.  Sensitivity  analyses
to  assess  white-  and  blue-collar  workers  separately  found  no
meaningful differences between the subgroups.

The primary outcome for Prochaska 2008 was movement through
the stages of change in response to three workplace interventions
targeting  inactivity,  BMI,  stress  and  smoking.  The  comparison  of
health  risk  intervention  (HRI)  alone  versus  HRI  +  motivational
interviewing (MI) for smoking cessation indicated a non-significant
benefit  for  the  MI  arm,  with  an  abstinence  rate  at  six  months
of  34.6%  versus  16.7%.  The  third  arm  (HRI  +  transtheoretical
model) achieved a rate of 21.1%. We were unable to establish the
distribution of the 101 reported to be 'at criterion' at six months (i.e.
deemed to be in the action stage, which for smoking was defined as
achieving point prevalence abstinence). We have therefore applied
an intention-to-treat principle, using the baseline smokers as the
denominators for our assessment of success rates.

In a personal communication, Milani 2009 reported six-month point
prevalence  cessation  rates  of  18.2%  (6/33)  for  the  intervention
group, and 0% (0/31) for the control group (P = 0.08). The primary
outcome  for  this  trial  was  cost  savings  to  the  employer  of  a
systematic  health  promotion  programme  for  their  insured  work
force.

Economic analysis

There is limited literature on the costs of implementing workplace
smoking  control  programmes.  Only  six  of  the  studies  identified
for  this  review  (Windsor  1988;  DePaul  1989;  Erfurt  1991;  DePaul
1994; Tanaka 2006; Milani 2009) reported cost data. All except the
Japanese HIPOP-OHP study were conducted in the USA.

Windsor 1988 found that material costs to deliver the programme
plus lost employee time to participate produced a total programme
cost of approximately USD 50 per employee. The cost to implement
the programme for combined groups 1 (brief advice and self-help
materials) and 3 (as 1 with monetary awards) was approximately
USD  9500  (USD  50  x  190  per  combined  intervention  group).  The
estimated  savings  to  the  University  for  Groups  1  and  3  with  a
5.8%  quit  rate  (9  employee  quitters  at  USD  1000)  was  about
USD 9000. From a cost-to-benefit ratio perspective the estimated
savings  observed  from  combined  groups  2  (as  1  with  self  help,
further counselling, buddy selection and contract) and 4 (as 2 with

monetary rewards for cessation) was the same as for groups 1 and
3 (USD 9500). The observed quit rate of 15% (27 employee quitters
at USD 1000) produced an estimated saving of approximately USD
27,000.  The  researchers  suggested  that  reducing  the  estimated
savings  by  50%  (for  example,  USD  500  per  employee  per  year
instead of USD 1000) still led to estimated savings of USD 13,500,
40% above the estimated cost of USD 9500. The cost-to-benefit ratio
for the most effective methods (groups 2 and 4) was approximately
2 to 1.

DePaul 1989 showed that in the Group condition (media, self-help
manuals,  groups  and  incentives)  44  participants  had  quit  at  the
12-month follow-up and for the Non-group condition 26 had quit
smoking.  Incentives  and  supplies  cost  approximately  USD  21,000
for  the  Group  intervention,  so  each  Group  quitter  cost  USD  477.
Supplies for the Non-group cost about USD 2000, so each quitter
cost USD 77.

Erfurt  1991  found  that  the  annual  direct  cost  per  employee  for
post-screening interventions was USD 2.97 for site 1 (control site),
USD 17.68 for site 2 (health education), USD 30.96 for site 3 (health
education  plus  follow-up  counselling),  and  USD  38.31  for  site  4
(health  education,  follow-up  counselling  plus  plant  organization
for health promotion). For engaging employees into treatment or
programme  participation,  sites  3  and  4  were  approximately  10
times more cost-effective than site 2. Also, for reducing risks and
relapse prevention, sites 3 and 4 were five to six times more cost-
effective  than  site  2.  At  sites  3  and  4  the  total  direct  cost  per
percentage of risks reduced and relapse prevented was less than
one dollar (USD 0.67 and USD 0.74, respectively) per employee per
year.

The last of the DePaul studies, DePaul 1994, summarized the cost
implications  of  all  three  De  Paul  studies.  The  total  cost  for  each
intervention  was  Self-help  USD  4717,  Incentives  USD  6992  and
Group  USD  26,867.  Costs  per  quitter  (12-month  point  prevalence
to continuous quit rate) were Self-help USD 225 - 1179, Incentives
USD 250 - 699 and Group USD 455 - 790. The cost of the programme
offered  to  the  public  (50,000  self-help  manuals  and  newspaper
supplements) was USD 62,500. If 5% to 15% of the recipients of self-
help materials could quit smoking, the cost would range from USD
8 to USD 25 per quitter. With the television series costing about USD
20,000, if only 5% of smokers who watched it managed to quit, the
cost per quitter would be USD 3.

The  HIPOP-OHP  Study 
(Tanaka  2006)  calculated  that  the
intervention  delivered  36.3  additional  quitters,  in  a  period  when
intervention  and  control  sites  all  reported  a  steady  rise  in  the
cessation  rate.  Based  on  materials  and  opportunity  costs,  each
quitter was estimated to have cost JPY 70,080 (95% CI JPY 32,800
to JPY 532,200). This converts to USD 707 at November 2013 rates.
The authors report that this is comparable with the cost per quitter
in companies with a smoke-free policy (USD 799), and lower than
the cost of a smoker who quits without NRT through primary care
or smoking specialist services (USD 2100 to 7900).

Milani  2009  presents  the  findings  of  their  trial  as  an  illustration
to the employer of potential savings from an effective healthcare
intervention in the workplace. They comment that in the US nearly
60% of after-tax profits are spent on corporate health benefits, with
80%  of  such  expenses  incurred  by  10%  to  20%  of  the  workforce.
Before  the  intervention,  total  medical  claim  costs  averaged  USD
2981  per  participant,  but  in  the  12  months  after  the  intervention

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

declined in the intervention group to an average of USD 1539 per
participant  (P  =  0.002),  compared  with  USD  2522  per  participant
in the control group (P = NS). The authors report that "For every
dollar invested in worksite intervention, $6 was realized in health
care savings".

Absenteeism

One study of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention (Nilsson 2001)
reported on mean number of sick days over the last four months of
the first year of the trial. Mean sick days taken by the intervention
group fell from 6.0 to 2.9 (P = 0.03), while the mean sick days taken
by the control group for that period rose from 4.5 to 7.4 (P = 0.04).
However, smoking was only one of several behaviours targeted in
this trial, and the contribution of reduced smoking prevalence to
absentee rates could not be separately estimated.

interventions  are  heterogeneous.  Although 

the
Workplace 
workplace  may  offer  particular  opportunities  for  recruitment  to
programmes,  many  of  the  interventions  tested  in  workplace
studies  are  not  specific  to  this  setting.  This  is  particularly  true  of
interventions  aimed  at  helping  individuals  to  stop  smoking.  The
effects of smoke-free policies and restrictions within the workplace
are covered in a companion review (Callinan 2010).

Summary of main results

This  updated  review  (latest  search  July  2013)  identified  57
randomized  or  quasi-randomized  trials  (61  comparisons),  with
later  trials  tending  to  be  of  higher  quality  for  both  conduct
and  reporting.  We  report  the  main  findings  in  the  'Summary  of
findings for the main comparison'. Ten trials of group behavioural
therapy  (1793  participants),  eight  trials  of  individual  counselling
(3516  participants),  five  trials  of  pharmacological  interventions
(1092  participants)  and  six  trials  of  multiple 
interventions
targeting  smoking  cessation  (5018  participants)  all  found  clear
evidence  in  support  of  such  worksite-based  programmes.  Work-
based  incentives  programmes  (five  trials,  1928  participants)  also
demonstrated  benefits,  but  this  analysis  was  dominated  by  one
large  trial  with  positive  findings  that  were  not  sustained  when
it  was  removed  from  the  calculation.  Self-help  interventions,
social support programmes, relapse prevention programmes and
environmental cues did not demonstrate significant benefits when
offered  in  the  workplace.  Although  we  identified  13  studies  of
comprehensive intervention programmes for multiple risk factors
including  smoking,  we  were  unable  to  extract  sufficient  data  for
meta-analysis. Although there is a strong theoretical rationale for
approaches that integrate smoking cessation with comprehensive
health  promotion  and  protection  programmes  in  the  workplace,
formal  studies  of  such  approaches  have  failed  to  show  that  they
significantly decrease overall prevalence of smoking.

In  addition  to  effectiveness,  it  is  clearly  important  for  employers
to  consider  the  economic  aspects  of 
introducing  smoking
programmes  in  their  workplaces.  These  issues  are  infrequently
addressed  in  the  studies  included  in  this  review,  and  those
studies  which  do  discuss  the  economic  implications  are  difficult
to  compare.  The  absolute  figures  quoted  vary  across  time  and
across  countries,  and  the  methods  of  calculating  costs  differ
from  one  study  to  the  next.  Some  studies  calculate  a  cost  per
quitter from among the smokers only, while others use the entire

workforce  as  the  denominator.  These  approaches  also  take  no
account  of  smokers  who  are  not  enrolled  in  the  programme,  but
who  are  nonetheless  reached  and  affected  by  the  programme's
publicity, or by friends and family who participate. Given that the
quitters among them may have been influenced by the presence
of the programme, they might reasonably be counted among the
programme's  successes.  Furthermore,  it  is  inappropriate  to  base
the calculations simply on the programme costs, without reference
to other direct costs such as occupied space that could have been
used  differently,  donated  or  discounted  time  and  resources,  and
avoidance of future healthcare expenditure on continuing smokers.
Some  studies  risk  an  over-simplified  approach  to  the  analysis,
calculating the costs per quitter in the intervention group without
reference to the costs per quitter in the control or pre-policy group.
The intervention costs should be reckoned as incremental to those
incurred by the control group, which can be seen as demonstrating
the background or placebo rate.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

In this third update of our review, we are confident that rigorous
ad hoc and routine searching have ensured that we have identified
the key research to inform the review question. Previous iterations
have been dominated by US-based trials, through a combination
of funding resources and the material interests of employers who
usually cover health insurance costs for their staff. It is notable that
for this update we have been able to include a few recent trials set
in developing countries; this arena is likely to become increasingly
important as the big tobacco companies shift their focus to these
areas,  while  smoking  rates  in  high-income  countries  stabilise  or
decline.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

In  drawing  conclusions  about  the  effectiveness  of  these
interventions we have placed the findings of the workplace studies
in  the  context  of  what  is  known  from  systematic  reviews  that
include  non-workplace  studies.  Although  the  results  of  some  of
the individual studies considered in this review have inconclusive
findings,  most  are  consistent  with  the  findings  from  other
systematic reviews. On this basis, we conclude that there is strong
evidence for an effect of group therapy, of individual counselling,
of  pharmacological  treatments,  and  of  multiple  interventions
for  smoking  cessation.  The  Cochrane  review  of  group  behaviour
therapy  (Stead  2005)  showed  that  such  programmes  increase
the  likelihood  of  quitting,  approximately  doubling  the  odds  of
quitting  (odds  ratio  (OR)  2.20,  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  1.72
to  2.81  compared  with  other  formats;  13  studies;  risk  ratio  (RR)
converted  to  OR).  This  compares  with  the  OR  in  this  review  for
the  group  behavioural  studies  of  1.71  (95%  CI  1.05  to  2.80).  Only
one  included  study  (DePaul  1994)  is  common  to  that  review  and
the  relevant  comparison  in  this  update,  making  the  two  bodies
of  evidence  relatively  independent  of  each  other.  The  Cochrane
review  of  individual  counselling  (Lancaster  2005a)  identified  18
trials  in  workplaces  and  other  settings,  with  only  one  study
(Windsor 1988) in common with this review. The OR for successful
smoking  cessation  in  the  individual  counselling  review  was  1.53
(95%  CI  1.31  to  1.80;  RR  converted  to  OR),  compared  with  the
individual  counselling  OR  in  this  review  of  1.96  (95%  CI  1.51  to
2.54).  Pharmacological  interventions  (predominantly  NRT)  were
also successful when mediated through the workplace, which was
compatible with results in other settings (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.68 to

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

1.88;  119  trials,  Stead  2012;  RR  converted  to  OR),  compared  with
the pharmacological interventions OR in this review of 1.98 (95%
CI  1.26  to  3.11);  the  same  analysis  restricted  only  to  NRT  trials
delivered an OR of 1.81 (95% CI 1.07 to 3.08). Self-help interventions
conducted  in  the  workplace  generally  did  not  deliver  enhanced
rates  of  smoking  cessation  (OR  1.16;  95%  CI  0.74  to  1.82),  which
again  is  consistent  with  the  findings  of  the  Cochrane  self-help
review (OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.19; 32 studies; Lancaster 2005b,
RR converted to OR).

A particular attraction of the workplace is that it provides a route
of  access  for  communicating  about  smoking  and  offering  help
to  stop.  However,  participation  rates  are  often  low.  A  number
of  studies  considered  methods  for  increasing  participation.  This
review  found  limited  evidence  that  participation  in  programmes
can  be  increased  by  competitions  and  incentives  organized  by
the employer (see also Cahill 2011). One limitation of the existing
evidence is that most studies were conducted in stable workplace
settings  which  are  becoming  less  common,  as  workers  are
increasingly mobile (for example, in the construction and transport
industries) or on short-term contracts (as in many modern service
industries). The assumption that the workplace is a good place for
recruitment is only valid for certain types of workplace.

Implications for practice

1.  We  found  strong  evidence  that  some  interventions  directed
towards  individual  smokers  increase  the  likelihood  of  quitting
smoking.  These  include  both  individual  and  group  counselling,
pharmacological treatment, and multiple interventions to increase
smoking  cessation.  All  these  interventions  show  similar  effects
in  the  workplace  or  elsewhere.  Self-help
whether  offered 
interventions,  relapse  prevention  and  social  support  are  less
effective. Although people taking up these interventions are more
likely to stop, the absolute numbers who quit are low.

2.  We  failed  to  detect  an  effect  of  comprehensive  programmes
targeting  multiple  risk  factors  in  reducing  the  prevalence  of
smoking; however, this conclusion is based upon a narrative rather
than a meta-analytical synthesis.

3.  There  was  limited  evidence  that  smoking  cessation  can
be  increased  by  competitions  and  incentives  organized  by  the
employer,  although  one  trial  demonstrated  a  sustained  effect  of
financial rewards for attending a smoking cessation course and for
long-term quitting.

4.  The  potential  advantage  of  the  workplace  is  that  more  people
can be reached and participation in cessation attempts is thereby
increased. However, participation rates are usually low even within
workplaces.

Implications for research

1.  A  particular  finding  of  this  review  is  the  sparsity  of  data  on
economic  aspects  of  workplace  cessation  programmes.  Future
studies  should  include  measurement  of  direct  and  indirect
costs,  and  if  possible,  economically  relevant  outcomes  such  as
absenteeism and productivity.

2. Further research is needed to establish which components of the
largest trial of incentives (Volpp 2009) contributed to its enhanced
success rates.

Briggs  for  advice  on  the  economic  aspects,  and  Stephen  Sutton,

3.  Further  research  would  be  valuable 
in  low-income  and
developing countries, where high rates of smoking still prevail and
smoke-free legislation is not widely accepted or enforced.

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]

Bergstrom 2008 

Methods

Country: Sweden

Participants

Interventions

Setting: 4 intervention sites (2 paper mills, 1 steelworks, 1 truck manufacturer), 1 'reference' [control]
site (4 paper industry companies associated with one of the paper mills).

Design: Prospective multicentre cohort study, run from 2000 - 2003

741 workers at the reference site, 387 at Company 1, 541 at Company 2, 1144 at Company 3, 2045 at
Company 4. Baseline smoking prevalence at each was 13.3%, 16.2%, 27.1%, 20.5% and 21.3% respec-
tively. Mean 12% women; mean age 41.3

1. Intervention: Personal feedback provided after screening; smokers assessed at moderate or high
risk got individual and group counselling, and NRT. High-risk smokers were offered full-time behaviour-
al rehab programmes for 2 or 4 weeks. Some companies self-initiated self-help SC groups. The whole
screening/feedback/intervention cycle was offered 3 times over the course of the study.

2. Control: In 2001 (yr 2), employees completed a questionnaire on the pyschosocial work environment,
and received tailored feedback. No other interention.

Population measures taken 10 times over 4 years.

Outcomes

Lifestyle (smoking and exercise), health-related quality of life, sick leave.

Smoking prevalence at each time point, recorded by OHS, who also did spirometry and PEF, to year 4,
probably based on self-reported PPA.

859 blue-collar women at baseline (73% of eligible). 538 completed programme to 18m. 53% aged 40 or
younger, 58% African American. Mean BMI 29. 30% I group, 22% C group smoked.

1. Intervention: computer-tailored 'magazine' with dietary, exercise, smoking advice, at baseline
and 6m, plus social support at work from trained helpers in participants' chosen activity. N.B. No lay
helpers offered smoking support.
2. Delayed intervention (control): One computer-tailored 'magazine at 6m, no social support.

Outcomes

Abstinence at 18m: self-reported, no biochemical validation.

Interventions

Country: USA
Setting: 4 General Motors worksites, Michigan
Design: Cluster-randomization by worksite

Random sample of 400-500 employees screened at baseline and followed up 3 yrs later.
Predominantly male, white, blue collar.
41-45% smoked at baseline, but in the rescreened sample only 41% in site 3 and 36% in site 4 smoked
at baseline

Smoking, high blood pressure & obesity targetted.
1 worksite was allocated to each of 4 conditions:
1. Wellness screening; identify risks & referral
2. As 1. + media, programme sign-up campaigns and classes
3. As 1. + media, program sign-up campaigns, menu of interventions including guided self-help, group
or individual counselling + follow up
4. As 3 + follow-up counselling + Plant Organization including peer support, aimed at reducing relapse.
All sites initiated no smoking areas during the period.

Outcomes

Self-reported smoking status

Type of intervention

6. ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPORT

Notes

Risk of bias

Bias

Quit rates were calculated by combining 1985 smokers and ex-smokers (i.e. at risk of relapse) as the de-
nominator. If the calculation is based only on current smokers at 1985 compared with 1988 quitters,
the results do not reach statistical significance.
Reduced prevalence at all 4 sites coincided with the setting-up of restrictive policies in each site.

Outcomes

Country: USA
Setting: 24 worksites in and around St Paul. No overlap with the Healthy Worker Project.
Design: Randomized 2 x 3 factorial design, with smokers followed up at 12m and 24m.
85.5% responded to 12m survey, and 81.7% to 24m survey.

2402 smokers on 24 sites, 4 sites randomized to each of the 6 conditions. There were significant differ-
ences in demographic characteristics between sites.
Smoking prevalence ranged from 10.7% to 37.2%.

The 3 programme formats were group counselling, telephone counselling or a choice of group or
phone.
The programmes were then offered with and without incentives (=6).
The incentive site smokers received USD10 for signing up to a programme, and USD 20 for near or full
completion. They were also offered USD 20 for 30 days cessation, and were then entered into a prize
draw for a USD 500 cash prize.

Rates of recruitment to the programmes, and 7-day smoking PP at 12m and 24m follow-up.
Validation was by self report, confirmed by family member or friend.
A sample of 188 quitters at 24m were asked to supply a saliva sample (128 complied).
Winners of the prize draw could only claim their prizes by verifying abstinence with salivary cotinine.

Notes

This is the SUCCESS Project.
Significant differences between worksites meant that several covariates had to be controlled for in the

Interventions

Country: USA
Recruitment: Employees from 4 worksites in Fargo, North Dakota and 4 in Eugene, Oregon
Design: Cluster-(worksite) randomization but individuals the unit of analysis. Two (competition/no-
competition) by two (relapse prevention training/no relapse prevention training) factorial design

Participants: 136 smokers from 8 worksites. Site size ranged from 50 - 380
Av. age: 38. av cpd: 28
Smoked: average 19 years
Participation rate: not reported - estimated 28% across all sites

Evaluates the incremental effectiveness of competition and relapse prevention training in the context
of a multicomponent cessation programme.
Multicomponent cognitive behavioural programme for 6 weekly sessions; within-site competition with
weekly feedback on a visible barometer and monetary prizes at programme completion and at 6m; re-
lapse prevention booster sessions were held at 1m and 2m intervals following the programme.

Outcomes

Cessation at 6m.
Validation: CO and saliva thiocyanate.

Interventions

Outcomes

1. Intervention: All screened for height, weight, cholesterol, smoking, BP, ECG, personality and psy-
chological testing. Top 20% at risk counted as the 'high risk' group, who received 6-monthly individual
physician counselling. Complete cessation was encouraged, but pipes or cigars allowed if necessary.
Advice booklet also supplied. All smokers of 5 or more cpd received written advice to quit. Environmen-
tal components included anti-smoking posters and a factory conference on dangers of tobacco.
2. Control: a 10% sample screened at baseline were followed up; the 20% of this sample with the high-
est risk score were also identified as the control 'high risk' subset, to be analyzed separately. The 'De-
sign and Methodology' paper reports that all eligible men in the control factories all received an ECG,
but this is not mentioned in later reports.

7-day PP at 2 yrs follow up.
5% sample of intervention group (327 men) were tested, + all of the original high-risk group (1268). The
10% random sample control subjects were reviewed after 2 yrs, including the 20% high risk subgroup
(202 men). Self report only, without biochemical verification. 
Abstinence was defined as someone smoking at baseline who had been abstinent for at least the week
before the 2-year assessment.

Mishra 2010 

Methods

Country: India

Setting: 4 Business Process Outsourcing (call centre) sites in Mumbai

Design: 4-arm cluster-randomized trial, each arm around 200 employees; 12-m programme spread over
18 months study duration.

Participants

All 992 employees invited, and 646 participated. 267 (41.3%) were tobacco users (the denominator for
the trial). BPO 1 (control) had highest prevalence (56.7%), BPO3 the lowest (22.2%). N of tobacco users
was BPO1: 63; BPO2: 87; BPO3: 43; BPO4: 74. BPO3 was admin-based, while the others were public-con-
tact call centres.

Interventions

BPO1 (control): Pamphlets to all employees on hazards of tobacco, how to quit.

BPO2: Active health education sessions (slide show, for anyone) + focus groups of 7 - 10 smoking em-
ployees; these became support groups for quitters and quit-attempters.

BPO3: As BPO2, + individual counselling.

BPO4: As BPO3, + optional bupropion based on individual needs assessment (offered to 24 but only 10
used it).
Regular follow-up every 2 - 3 months, final assessment at 12m.

Outcomes

Sustained cessation for 6m, verified by "smoke-check" CO monitor, expired CO < 6 ppm; reduction.
Comparison used was 1 (controls) versus 2 (groups).

age, baseline FTND mean 50% 7 - 10.

Interventions

1. Viva QS: (77) a "herbal medication" "twelve herbs mainly found in Korea and China".

2. Control: (78) placebo tablets.

All pts asked to set TQD (day 8), and given 24-wk supply of tablets. All pts phoned at wks 2 and 4, giv-
en 5 - 10 mins counselling. At wk 12 all had face-to-face session of brief counselling and smoking status
checked with CO testing; those not available were phoned.

Final assessment at wk 24, with bio-confirmation (CO < 8 ppm, cotinine). Any lost or unconfirmed
counted as smokers.

Okechukwu 2009 

Methods

Country: USA (Massachussets)

Setting: 10 unionised building sites (4 intervention, 6 control)

Design: RCT (cluster-randomised), conducted 2004 - 2007.

Participants

624 (251 smokers) intervention trainees, 560 (239 smokers) control trainees completed all three surveys
= working cohort. Mean age 28, 95% male, smoking prevalence 41%.

Interventions

4-month programme, conducted in work time.

1. Intervention:

(a) Toxics and tobacco curriculum; 2 x 1-hour modules on work-related hazards added to smoking
risks.

(b) Group-based SC counselling: 8-week course on MI principles at each site; 3 - 12 people per group.

(c) Free NRT patches to any intervention smoker, regardless of other interactions.

(d) DIY quit kits; self-help materials, including SC guide.

(e) Environmental cues: posters, support materials.

Those who attended got early release from classes, and meals. Those who completed 7/8 sessions en-
tered into cash raffle. Survey completers got a USD 10 store voucher.

2. Control:

Assessment only, at 3 time points, but received full programme after study end.

Outcomes

Smoking status (PA) at 1m, 6m. 7-day PPA at 1m. Not biochemically verified (to avoid 'drug-testing' as-
sociation). Also smoking reduction, number of quit attempts. Time 3 (6m) slipped to 8m for 1 site and

Prochaska 2008 

Methods

Country: Oregon, USA

Setting: Medical University
Study design: RCT

Participants

Interventions

1400 employees, randomized to health risk assessment intervention (HRI: 464; 48 smokers), HRI + MI
counselling (433; 40 smokers) or HRI + interactive TTM programme (TTM: 503; 48 smokers). Study tar-
geted 4 risk-reduction programmes: stress, exercise, weight control and smoking. 11% M, mean age 41,
mean CPD N/S.

Intervention 1: MI: HRA + 3 x phone or face-to-face MI sessions, to move along SoC and reduce risky be-
haviour.
Intervention 2: TTM: HRA + online TTM programme (Pro-Change Lifestyle Management Program); 4
programmes over 6m; recommended 3 sessions of each course.

Control: Health risk assessment (HRA) only. SoC assessed for each risk, and identified single best step
to remedy.

Outcomes

'Reaching criterion' at 6m, i.e. PPA (no longer at risk) for smokers.
Validation: None.

Type of intervention

8. COMPREHENSIVE

Notes

New for 2014 update; No 6m denominators reported, but 101/136 smokers reported to have completed
(Table 3). No reply from authors.

Country:USA
Setting: 9 Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) worksites, allocated to 4 levels of intervention.
Design: Quasi-experimental, random assignment of worksites. Sites were blinded to other intervention
conditions. 

2887 workers across 9 sites at baseline HRA survey (69% of eligibles). At 2-yr follow-up 1998 (48%) were
surveyed. Cross-sectional, not cohort surveys.
> 40% of participants were manual workers, 25 - 31% clerical, 15 - 21% managerial and 12 - 16% techni-
cal staff.. 74 - 79% male, > 70% aged 30 - 49. 

1. (3 sites, 1372 participants): HRA (height, weight, smoking, BP, cholesterol, HDL levels) at start and
end of programme, + a bi-monthly health newsletter (counts as control group). 
2. (2 sites, 1083 participants): As 1, + health resources centre and free self-care booklets.
3. (2 sites, 1016 participants) As 2, + behaviour change workshops and a divisional HealthWise social
support team.
4. (2 sites, 693 participants): As 3, + case management programme for high-risk participants (the 15%
with the highest risk scores) and an environmental policy (space, smoking policies, incentives, health

Outcomes

Country: USA
Setting: 8 worksites in Bloomington, Minnesota
Design: Cluster-randomized trial.

Intervention worksites (I): 1885 workers
Comparison sites (C): 1479 workers. 39% smoked at baseline in I and 31% in C worksites
Participation rate: 12% of smokers (range 8 - 29% by site); 3.7% of nonsmokers participated in classes
to assist quitters.

The 3m intervention included consultation for employers on the adoption of a non-smoking policy,
training for nonsmokers to provide assistance to smokers attempting to quit, and cessation classes for
smokers

Quit rate, self-reported (an attempt was made to collect saliva samples for analysis for cotinine). Base-
line survey of all employees was conducted 9m before intervention, companies then randomized, then

Interventions

Country: USA
Setting: 108 worksites in 16 US states
Design: Randomized matched-pair trial, using cross-sectional surveys at baseline and 2-yr follow-up

108 worksites with over 28,000 employees ( 49 - 1700 workers per site). Participation rate 72%, Av age
41, 77% men, 92% white.
Only 3 of the 4 study centres (84 sites) measured changes in smoking, as the 4th centre sites (Florida)
had smoking bans already in place.

Each workplace had an employee as co-ordinator, and an employee advisory board.
1) Individual core interventions: Process included a kickoff event, interactive activities, posters and
brochures, self assessments, self-help materials, campaigns and contests, and direct education
through classes and groups.
2) Environmental core interventions:
Consultation on smoking policy, changes in cafeteria and vending machine food, and additional nutri-
tional education.
Control sites had results of employee survey, and in some cases an optional minimal intervention of
posters and newsletters.

Outcomes

Self-reported smoking cessation, without biochemical validation. 6m abstinence at follow-up, smoking
prevalence.

The Working Well trial generated a nested cohort study, the WellWorks Trial, which examined dietary
and smoking changes stratified by job type at the Massachusets worksites. See Sorensen 1998.

Country: USA
Setting: 24 mainly manufacturing worksites in Massachusets, randomized into 12 pairs, and all thought
to be using known or suspected carcinogens.
Randomization was by worksite, but analysis was by individual. Analysis in this paper was co-
hort-based

5914 (61%) of sampled employees responded at baseline, and 5406 (62%) at 2-yr follow-up.
The cohort who responded to both surveys was 2658 employees (699 smokers and recent quitters).

3 elements of intervention:
1) Joint worker-management programme planning and implementation
2) Consultation by project staff with management on environmental changes, inc tobacco control poli-
cies, healthy foods, occupational hazard reduction
3) Health education programs targeting individual behaviours in the risk factor areas.

Notes

Risk of bias

Bias

The WellWorks Study is a nested component of the Working Well trial (Sorensen 1996), but, unlike that
trial, attempted to integrate health promotion and health protection interventions, and is therefore as-

Setting: 15 manufacturing sites, probably handling hazardous chemicals, in Massachusetts.
Design: RCT, randomized by worksite, but analysed by individual employee.

9019 employees (80%) across 15 sites. Mean workforce size 741 employees. Responders in the control
groups were younger, more likely to be women, less educated, less likely to be white, and less likely to
be hourly-paid rather than salaried.

1. Control [8 sites] had Health Promotion (HP) intervention, i.e. consultation to management on tobac-
co control policies, catering and cafeteria policies, and programmes aimed at individuals, including self
assessment with feedback, self-help activities, contests, demonstrations and displays, opportunities to
try behaviours and goals, and group discussions.
2. Experimental Group [7 sites] (HP/OHS = health promotion with occupational health and safety) had
the same elements as the Control sites, plus management recommendations to reduce occupation-
al hazard exposure. For individuals, occupational health and safety training was added to the tobacco
and nutritional elements of the control programme.

Interventions

Trial was described to company as a 'smoking education programme', and was open only to smokers.
1. 25-minute video 'Dying for a Fag' (DFF) plus a cessation booklet, the Health Education Council's 'The
smoker's guide to non-smoking'
2. DFF with additional sequence to boost the confidence of those making a quit attempt (DFF+C)

4. Smokers who chose not to participate - no videos or information

Outcomes

Self-reported PP smoking cessation at 3m and 1yr with CO validation < 10 ppm

3. SELF-HELP

Notes

Risk of bias

Bias

Cash incentives were offered at baseline and at 12m follow-up to boost questionnaire response rates.
The authors also present a 4-study pooled analysis, which failed to detect significant differences in ces-
sation rates.
Although the cessation rates appear to be significantly better in this study than in the other 3, the au-
thors point out that follow-up was around New Year, when many people try and stop anyway, and may
also have been influenced by the concurrent BBC series 'So you want to stop smoking'

About 881 smokers across 4 companies
risk-assessed and given SC classes and
NRT; about 98 controls assessed only

No MA data, but logistic regression re-
sults over 10 timepoints for 3½ years.
Significant reductions in gradient rela-
tive to controls in Companies 1 (-0.6), 2
(-0.92) and 4 (-0.45), not in Company 3
(-0.09).

No indication of validation (all long-
term data collected by post or phone)

304 intervention smokers recalled at 2
yrs, and 306 control smokers. 195 par-
ticipants lost to follow up, proportion of
smokers not reported

21.4% of intervention smokers quit, vs
13.4% of control smokers. Point preva-
lence at 2 yrs, not a significant differ-
ence

538 women in 9 worksites (4 exp, 5 con-
trol) completed all surveys (282 I, 256 C)

Attrition rate was 8% in both groups

419 smokers in 38 worksites, ran-

No raw data given for smoking, but
prevalence went down by around 3% in
both groups. No significant differences,
and no p values.

7/16 smokers in the comprehensive
programme site had quit at 5m, versus
3/14 at the SC only site.

844 smokers in 61 worksites, ran-
domised to Self-help [SH] (289), In-
centives [I] (281) or Group support [G]
(283).
12 month attrition rates were 52.5% in
SH, 47.2% in I, and 37.5% in G.

2055 workers (28% smokers) complet-
ed all surveys from 22 worksites, and
constituted the cohort.

Four sites were assessed at baseline;
Site 1 had 1096 smokers (45%), Site 2
598 (44%), Site 3 844 (41%) and Site 4
834 (44%).
At 3 year follow-up Site 4 had been sig-
nificantly restructured.

48 smokers initially randomised to
three groups, with varying levels of hyp-
nosis, booster and self-management
training. A 4th group (15 smokers) was
later recruited, with Group 2 interven-
tions applied more intensively.
Attrition rate of 6% across the initial 3
groups at end of treatment, 17% at 3
months and 25% at 6 month follow-up.

36 employees, randomised to abrupt
reduction (13), gradual reduction (12)
and gradual reduction + feedback (11).
Attrition at 6 months was respectively
4, 0 and 1.

29 employees randomised to Basic Pro-
gramme (13) or Basic Programme + So-
cial Support (16).
Attrition 7% at end of treatment, and a
further 7% at 6 months

19 worksites, random allocation to In-
centive programme (474 smokers) or
No Incentive programme (623 smok-
ers).

Smoking outcome

Validated ?

Reported rates were not based on In-
tention to Treat, but on participation
in the programmes. Correcting for attri-
tion would increase the efficacy of the
Group programme.
At 24 months, 30% of the Group smok-
ers were abstinent, comnpared with
19.5% of Non-Group smokers (no p val-
ue).
(See also Cochrane Review 'Self-help
interventions for smoking cessation')

12 month quit rates for sustained absti-
nence were 5.1% (n=79) SH, 11% (n=91)
I, 31.2% (n=109) G (p<0.01). An Inten-
tion to Treat analysis, taking account of
attrition, would further favour the inter-
vention groups.
(See also Cochrane Review 'Self-help
interventions for smoking cessation')

At 3 yr final follow up, 8.0% of the inter-
vention smokers had quit for 6m, and
8.1% of the control smokers. 25.6% and
21.8% respectively claimed 7-day PP.
Differences were non-significant

Participation was affected by the inter-
vention: 5% in Site 1, 9% in Site 2, 53%
in Site 3 and 58% in Site 4.
Possible bias due to different baseline
characteristics of people rescreened
in site 3 & 4 limit interpretation of fol-
low-up smoking prevalences: 41.6%,
40.6%, 36.1%, 31.0%
All sites had significant relative re-
ductions in smoking: 7.8% (p<0.01),
10.6% (p<0.01), 11.7% (p<0.001), 13.2%
(p<0.001).
Of those smoking in 1985 who were re-
screened in 1988, 17.1% at Site 1 had
quit, 17.6% at Site 2, 20.3% at Site 3 and
18.9% at Site 4 (NS).

No difference between the groups for
smoking cessation 6 months after treat-
ment, regardless of the frequency,
length between sessions, or addition
of behavioural methods. Quit rate was
20% for all groups, based on Intention
to Treat.
Intensive intervention produced ini-
tially higher quit rates (60% at end of
treatment), but this reverted to 20% by
6 months
(See also Cochrane Review 'Hypnother-
apy for smoking cessation')

At 6 months up to one third in the grad-
ual condition were abstinent compared
to no subjects in the abrupt condition
(NS).
Intention to Treat analysis showed that
the gradual reduction programme was
more successful than the abrupt reduc-
tion (p<0.05)

Consistent with previous findings, sup-
portive social interactions were not re-
lated to treatment outcome.3/13 in the
Basic Programme had quit at 6 months,
and 3/16 in the Basic + Social Support
Group (NS). 
(See also Cochrane review 'Enhancing
partner support to improve smoking
cessation').

At 2 year follow-up 49/344 (14%) were
abstinent in the Incentives group, and
49/426 (12%) in the No incentives group

Comprehensive programme; a 26% rate
of cessation was noted across both lon-
gitudinal cohort groups (NS), and a 30%
rate across both cross-sectional groups
(NS). No significant differences were
seen between the 2 types of interven-
tion

No significant differences between
HRA and RFE groups at any follow-up
point, nor between BC and BCI groups.
HRA and RFE groups (68 smokers) were
pooled and compared with 60 smokers
in pooled BC and BCI groups. Continu-
ous abstinence rates at 6m were 1% for
HRA+RFE and 10% for BC+BCI (Fisher's
Exact Test P = 0.05); 12m rates were 0%
and 7% (P = 0.05).

PPA at 6 and 12m. Study used as de-
nominators only those with complete
follow-up data, who had attended at
least 5 sessions. On this basis, 6m quit
rates were (I) 31.2%, (C) 13.4%, and
12m (I) 23.75, (C) 19.5. Our ITT analysis
gives 6m: (I) 21.7%, (C) 8.9%: 12m: (I)

24 worksites, randomised to 6 pro-
grammes, 4 worksites in each pro-
gramme. 2402 smokers were surveyed
at baseline and at 12 and 24 months.
85.5% response rate at 12 months, and
81.7% at 24.

407 (17%) smokers signed up to pro-
grammes. 15.4% at 12 months and
19.4% at 24 months reported them-
selves as non-smokers.
Recruitment was significantly high-
er in the incentive sites (22% vs 12%
p=0.0054), but did not translate into
higher cessation rates.
Quit rates were consistently higher
among programme registrants than
among non-registrants, but the differ-
ential was greater in the non-incentive
sites (15%) than in the incentive ones
(6.7%), consistent with incentives at-
tracting smokers less motivated to quit.

At 12m, 15/257 intervention smokers
had quit, versus 22/276 control smok-
ers. Intervention smokers at genetically
higher risk of smoking-related cancers
(5.6% and 7.1%) did not perform differ-
ently from the low-risk smokers (4.9%,
P = 0.723). Possible confounding by leg-
islation preventing passive smoking.

At 12 months, 23/131 (18%) in the Full
Programme arm had quit, while 27/121
(22%) in the Group-only arm had quit
(NS).

Self-report, validated by family mem-
ber or friend.
A sample of quitters were asked to sup-
ply saliva, and were paid $25 if they
complied. 
Winners of cessation prize draws had

(p=0.003). Male smoking decreased
from 62.9% to 56.7% (p=0.04).
Delayed intervention in the control
group lead to 13% quit rate (16/123)

At 6m, 15/127 had quit; Competition

871 employee smokers, randomised
to Group 1 (simple warning) or Group

normal/abnormal lung function.
After fine tuning, at 3 months 215
workers received counselling, while 361
received simple warning and 3 were ex-

High risk intervention group (n = 1268)
reduced prevalence by 18.7% (84.5%
to 68.7%), and high risk control group
(n = 202) reduced by 12.2% (80.8% to
70.9%). P < 0.05.
Random sample comparison: 5% of
intervention group (n = 327) reduced
by 12.5%, compared with 10% control
sample (n = 800) reduced by 12.6% (ns).

At 12 months, abstinence in Group 1
was 18.1% (NS), in Group 2 12.7% (NS)
and in Group 3 13.3% (NS). Time to re-
lapse was significantly longer in Group
1 compared with the other 2 groups
(p=0.04).

2 physicians dropped out post ran-
domisation.
3.4% of baseline non-smokers in each
group were smokers at 1 year fol-
low-up.
The sustained abstinence rate at 6
months or more (A: 4.6%; B: 6.1%) was
non-significant using the physician as
the unit as analysis.
At 12 months, Group A had a quit rate
of 13.5%, and Group B a rate of 18.4%
(p=0.03)

Counselled workers had an 8.4% ab-
stinence rate at 11 months, compared
with 3.6% in the control group (p<0.05).
Feedback on abnormal lung func-
tion was not significantly related to in-
creased rates of quitting

Few differences were observed be-
tween controlled smoking and con-
trolled smoking plus partner support
conditions either during treatment or
at the 6-month follow-up. 25% of Group
1, and 17% of Group 2 were abstinent at
6 months (NS).
(See Cochrane review 'Enhancing part-
ner support to improve smoking cessa-
tion').

275 abstainers randomized by compa-
ny to proactive phone counselling (134)
or to worksite-based group counselling
(141) for relapse prevention.

No significant differences at 9m: Phone
counselling 57.5% and group coun-
selling 61.7% remained abstinent (P =
0.552).

4-wk CA assessed by CO < 10 ppm, and
by urinary cotinine ≤ 317 ng/ml.

Two sites chosen; 33 intervention
smokers received comprehensive CV
risk programme, including referral to
SC programme, and 31 controls.

Tobacco users in 4 call centres (63 con-
trol, 204 intervention) received increas-
ing levels of support and bupropion;
controls got self-help leaflets. 99% re-
ceived long-term counselling.

113 workers randomised to interven-
tion (65) or control (63).
Attrition at 12 months was 32% for the
intervention group, and 24% for the
control group. At 18 months the respec-
tive attrition rates were 34% and 27%.

6/33 intervention smokers quit at 6m,
versus 0/31 controls. Cost effectiveness
analysis reported.

6m PA at 12m rates were 4/63 (con-
trols), 17/87 BPO2 (HE sessions + fo-
cus groups), 8/43 BPO3 (as BPO2 + in-
dividual counselling), and 15/74 BPO4
(as BPO3 + bupropion offered); high
turnover (52.4%) but only 1% lost to fol-
low-up.

Baseline prevalence for both groups
was 65%. At 12 months the interven-
tion group point prevalence rate was
37%, and the control group 63%. At 18
months, the rates were 40% (of 43) and
59% (of 46) respectively. This difference
influenced the decrease in mean risk
score from 10.3 to 9.0 after 18 months
in the intervention group (P = 0.042)

counselling; 78 male control smokers
randomized to placebo tablets. Attrti-
tion was 1 intervention and 3 controls
at start of study.

251 intervention smokers (4 sites) and
239 control smokers (6 sites) had 4m
programme of counselling, self help,
NRT and environmental cues. Attri-
tion at 6m post-programme was I 2%, C
1.7%.

402 employee smokers randomised
within their preference for group
or self-help programmes, to 3 pro-
grammes, MCP (1), RPP (2) or MTP (3).
7% attrition rate at 12 months.

48 smokers randomized to the HRI
group, 40 to the MI group, and 48 to the
TTM group. Attrition was 25.7% at 6m
(distribution NK)

47 employees randomised to contin-
gent payment/frequent CO monitor-
ing group (17), non-contingent pay-
ment/frequent CO monitoring (16),
non-contingent payment/ infrequent
monitoring (14).
4 participants failed to abstain for 5
days, and were excluded before ran-
domisation.
At 6 months 11 more participants had
dropped out. Analyses were Intention
to Treat at randomisation.

At wk 24 all pts had face-to-face meet-
ing at workplace for smoking status.
Intervention 20-wk CA quit rate 19/75,
controls 9/72. Similar AEs (sore throat:
I 28.8%, C 36.6%; dry mouth: I 17.8%, C
16.9%).

All pts cotinine- (< 50 ng/ml) and CO- (<
8 ppm) tested at 24 wks, whether claim-
ing abstinence or not. 54 24-wk urine
samples not analysed, so only CO reli-
able.

At 6m, 22/245 intervention and 17/235

All self-help programmes similar.
Results: Group 1 8/51, Group 2 10/57,
Group 3 4/51 (NS)
SH1 7/76, SH2 9/82, SH3 6/85 (NS)

PPA at 6m ("at criteria") was estimat-
ed at 8/48 for HRI alone, 14/40 for HRI
+ MMI, 10/48 for HRI + TTM; 6m denom-
inators not reported (no reply from au-
thors), so we have applied 6m quit rates
to baseline smoking rates.

Contingent payment combined with
frequent CO monitoring delayed but
did not ultimately prevent participant
relapse to smoking by the end of the six
month follow-up. Contingent payment
group had CO value at or less than 11
ppm significantly longer than the oth-
er two groups (p=0.03). CO monitoring
alone had no effect on abstinence.
At six months, only 2 subjects ( 1con-
tingent, 1 non-contingent) had
achieved sustained abstinence.

344 post-cessation abstainers ran-
domised to psychologist support (135),
ex-smoker support (88), or no formal
support (121),

12 months abstinence rates were
59/135 (43.7%) in the PG group; 33/88
(37.5%) in the SG group; 43/121 (35.5%)
in no support group (NS).

Expired CO and urinary cotinine. Un-
validated self-report (higher) were also
given.

218 smokers randomized to counselling
+ NRT (115) or minimal sporadic advice
(103) in 3 Bilabao (Spain) worksites

38 smokers assigned to standard be-

tion group, vs 9/103 (8.7%) in the con-
trol group (P = 0.025).
NNT was 9 people treated for 3mss to

12m continuous abstinence rates were
8/38 (21.1%) for SB, and 5/41 (12.2%)
for RP.

2 yr cross-sectional survey of 1998
workers (250 smokers); Prevalence de-
clined by 34% from 18% to 12% in Lev-

in Level 2 (p < 0.1); by 35% from 24% to
15% in level 3 (p < 0.01); by 44% from
14% to 8% in Level 4 (p < 0.01) 

After the 5 months of intervention,
smoking cessation rate in the interven-
tion group (19.2%) tended to be higher
than that in the control group (7.4%),
(NS).
Control group was given same pro-
gramme after the 5 months for the in-

Eight worksites, randomised to inter-
vention (1885 workers) or comparison
(1479 workers).
At baseline, 9 months before interven-
tion, 34% of respondents were current
smokers (I:39%;C:31%)
Six-month data were on only 7 of the
8 sites, because of ownership changes
at the 8th. Six-month survey was of all
smokers then employed, = 66% of origi-
nally surveyed employees.
Analyses were by individual, while ran-
domisation was by worksite.

108 matched worksites (>28,000 work-
ers), randomised to intervention or
control conditions, though Florida cen-
ter sites did not target smoking, leaving
smoking outcomes available in only 84
worksites.

Cohort analysis (2658 employees) of
a randomised controlled study of 12
matched pairs of worksites.
Worksite was unit of allocation, but
analysis was by individual.

Cross-sectional analysis (9019 at base-
line [80%] and 7327 [65%] ) at six
months follow-up, plus cohort analysis
of 5156 employees who responded to
both surveys (embedded cohort of 436
smokers).
Worksite was unit of allocation, but
analysis was by individual.

Analysis of all smokers, not just partici-
pants.
At the 6-month follow-up, 12% of
smokers in the intervention group re-

Worksite was the unit of allocation and
analysis. Baseline smoking data were
not reported in detail.
There was a difference of 1.53% (NS) in
the 6-month quit rates between inter-
vention and control sites, and a reduc-
tion in prevalence from 24.5% to 21.2%
(I), and from 25.8% to 21.8% (C), a dif-
ference between the 2 groups of 0.66%
(NS).

PP abstinence for the 6 months prior
to 2-year follow-up was 15% for inter-
vention group and 9% for control group
(p=0.123)
Blue-collar cessation rates for the 2
groups were 18% (I) and 9% (C), while
the white-collar workers achieved high-
er rates in the control than in the in-
tervention group; office worker rates
were 2.5% (I) vs 5.1% (C), and professip-
nal/managerial rates were 14.2% (I) vs
18.6% (C).

At six months, point prevalence in the
HP/OHS sites fell from 20.4% to 16.3%,
and in the HP sites from 18.6% to 17%.
In the embedded cohort (825 smokers)
at 6m, the HP/OHS quit rate was 11.3%,
compared with the HP rate of 7.5%
(OR=1.57, p=0.17). Within the cohort,
blue-collar quit rates more than dou-
bled in the HP/OHS sites (11.8%) com-
pared with the HP sites (5.9%, p=0.04)

270/334 interested smokers invited to
nicotine gum cessation programme;
the uninvited 64 represented a control
group. 172 (64%) of invitees attended
the 1st consultation, 163 the 2nd. 
One-year follow-up rate was 99% (9%
by phone).

Video programme (smoking, plus seat-
belt advice) was offered to all employ-
ees. 77 employees were randomised to
DFF video (33) or seatbelt (44=control)
videos.

150 employees (smokers only) partic-
ipated. 46 watched the DFF video, 50
watched a confidence-boosting version
of the DFF video, and 54 (control group)
watched LTK video.

12% (20/172) of those who attended
the intervention course were abstinent
at 12 months, compared with 1% (1/98)
of those who did not accept the invi-
tation, and 2% (1/64) of the control
group; p values not given.

Abstinence rates (DFF: 3%, SB [con-
trol] 0%) were not significantly differ-
ent from each other at 12 months fol-
low-up, There was no significant differ-
ence in validated abstinence between
the video groups and the non-partici-
pant group.

Abstinence rates (DFF: 11%, DFF+C 8%,
LTK [control] 9%) were higher than in
the other 3 studies, but not significantly
different from each other
at 12 months follow-up. But there was
a significant difference in abstinence
rates between participant groups and
the non-participant group (4%, p<0.05).

Abstinence

A period of being quit, i.e. stopping the use of cigarettes or other tobacco products, May be defined
in various ways; see also:
point prevalence abstinence; prolonged abstinence; continuous/sustained abstinence

Biochemical verification

Also called 'biochemical validation' or 'biochemical confirmation':
A procedure for checking a tobacco user's report that he or she has not smoked or used tobacco. It
can be measured by testing levels of nicotine or cotinine or other chemicals in blood, urine, or sali-
va, or by measuring levels of carbon monoxide in exhaled breath or in blood.

Bupropion

A pharmaceutical drug originally developed as an antidepressant, but now also licensed for smok-
ing cessation; trade names Zyban, Wellbutrin (when prescribed as an antidepressant)

Carbon monoxide (CO)

A colourless, odourless highly poisonous gas found in tobacco smoke and in the lungs of people
who have recently smoked, or (in smaller amounts) in people who have been exposed to tobacco
smoke. May be used for biochemical verification of abstinence.

Cessation

Continuous abstinence

Also called 'quitting'
The goal of treatment to help people achieve abstinence from smoking or other tobacco use, also
used to describe the process of changing the behaviour

Also called 'sustained abstinence'
A measure of cessation often used in clinical trials involving avoidance of all tobacco use since the
quit day until the time the assessment is made. The definition occasionally allows for lapses. This is
the most rigorous measure of abstinence

'Cold Turkey'

Quitting abruptly, and/or quitting without behavioural or pharmaceutical support.

Craving

Dopamine

Efficacy

Harm reduction

Lapse/slip

nAChR

Nicotine

A very intense urge or desire [to smoke].
See: Shiffman et al 'Recommendations for the assessment of tobacco craving and withdrawal in
smoking cessation trials'
Nicotine & Tobacco Research 2004: 6(4): 599-614

A neurotransmitter in the brain which regulates mood, attention, pleasure, reward, motivation and
movement

Also called 'treatment effect' or 'effect size':
The difference in outcome between the experimental and control groups

Strategies to reduce harm caused by continued tobacco/nicotine use, such as reducing the number
of cigarettes smoked, or switching to different brands or products, e.g. potentially reduced expo-
sure products (PREPs), smokeless tobacco.

Terms sometimes used for a return to tobacco use after a period of abstinence. A lapse or slip
might be defined as a puff or two on a cigarette. This may proceed to relapse, or abstinence may be
regained. Some definitions of continuous, sustained or prolonged abstinence require complete ab-
stinence, but some allow for a limited number or duration of slips. People who lapse are very likely
to relapse, but some treatments may have their effect by helping people recover from a lapse.

[neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]: Areas in the brain which are thought to respond to nico-
tine, forming the basis of nicotine addiction by stimulating the overflow of dopamine

An alkaloid derived from tobacco, responsible for the psychoactive and addictive effects of smok-
ing.

Nicotine Replacement Therapy
(NRT)

A smoking cessation treatment in which nicotine from tobacco is replaced for a limited period by
pharmaceutical nicotine. This reduces the craving and withdrawal experienced during the initial
period of abstinence while users are learning to be tobacco-free The nicotine dose can be taken
through the skin, using patches, by inhaling a spray, or by mouth using gum or lozenges.

Outcome

Often used to describe the result being measured in trials that is of relevance to the review. For ex-
ample smoking cessation is the outcome used in reviews of ways to help smokers quit. The exact
outcome in terms of the definition of abstinence and the length of time that has elapsed since the
quit attempt was made may vary from trial to trial.

Pharmacotherapy

A treatment using pharmaceutical drugs, e.g. NRT, bupropion

Point prevalence abstinence
(PPA)

A measure of cessation based on behaviour at a particular point in time, or during a relatively brief
specified period, e.g. 24 hours, 7 days. It may include a mixture of recent and long-term quitters. cf.
prolonged abstinence, continuous abstinence

Prolonged abstinence

A measure of cessation which typically allows a 'grace period' following the quit date (usually of
about two weeks), to allow for slips/lapses during the first few days when the effect of treatment
may still be emerging.
See: Hughes et al 'Measures of abstinence in clinical trials: issues and recommendations'; Nicotine
& Tobacco Research, 2003: 5 (1); 13-25

Relapse

A return to regular smoking after a period of abstinence

Secondhand smoke

Also called passive smoking or environmental tobacco smoke [ETS]
A mixture of smoke exhaled by smokers and smoke released from smouldering cigarettes, cigars,
pipes, bidis, etc. The smoke mixture contains gases and particulates, including nicotine, carcino-
gens and toxins.

Self-efficacy

The belief that one will be able to change one's behaviour, e.g. to quit smoking

SPC [Summary of Product
Characteristics]

Advice from the manufacturers of a drug, agreed with the relevant licensing authority, to enable
health professionals to prescribe and use the treatment safely and effectively.

Tapering

Titration

Withdrawal

W H A T ' S   N E W

A gradual decrease in dose at the end of treatment, as an alternative to abruptly stopping treat-
ment

A technique of dosing at low levels at the beginning of treatment, and gradually increasing to full
dose over a few days, to allow the body to get used to the drug. It is designed to limit side effects.

A variety of behavioural, affective, cognitive and physiological symptoms, usually transient, which
occur after use of an addictive drug is reduced or stopped.
