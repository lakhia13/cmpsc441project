Abstract

As a universal human reaction to perceived and/or actual loss, grief is becoming increasingly 
pervasive at all levels of society. Among the broad spectrum of loss experiences, those associated 
with dementia are perhaps of the most complex. The shift toward considering loss and grief 
within the context of dementia caregiving is promising. However, pre-loss grief is understudied, 
and interventions are lacking. Only few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of pre-loss 
psychosocial grief interventions for dementia caregivers. Preliminary findings from an ongoing 
clinical trial testing the effects of an 8-week, group-based online video intervention with dementia 
caregivers indicate that compared to pre-coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the experience of 
loss and separation was exacerbated by loss of control and severe physical contact restrictions in 
long-term care facilities. Finding effective grief interventions that can be translated into clinical 
and community-based environments is necessary to alleviate dementia caregivers’ emotional 
distress and improve their quality of life.

As a universal human reaction to perceived and/or actual loss, grief is categorized in the 
literature as pre-death (Supiano et al., 2021), anticipatory (Dehpour & Koffman, 2022), 
acute (Meichsner et al., 2020), prolonged (Prigerson et al., 2009), complicated (Bertuccio 
& Runion, 2020), or disenfranchised (Thompson & Doka, 2017). Theoretical models have 
been developed to guide specific interventions tailored to address loss and grief in various 
contexts (Blandin & Pepin, 2017; Boss, 2016; Kübler-Ross & Kessler, 2005; Neimeyer 
et al., 2006), including grief related to cross-generational historical group traumas and 
unresolved grief (Moore et al., 2022). In addition, a number of valid and reliable instruments 
have been specifically designed to capture grief and its complex manifestations (Marwit & 
Meuser, 2002; Prigerson et al., 2009).

The purpose of the current article is to discuss loss and grief in the context of dementia 
caregiving using specific examples of pre-death grief interventions for family caregivers who 
placed loved ones in long-term care (LTC). Qualitative preliminary findings emphasizing 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related exacerbation in caregiver loss 
experiences are presented.

DEMENTIA GRIEF

Among the broad spectrum of loss experiences, those associated with dementia are among 
the most complex. As a syndrome, dementia is characterized by persistent memory loss 
extending over a number of years, resulting in a domino effect of neurocognitive changes 
that ultimately lead to death. In the process of caring for someone diagnosed with dementia, 
family members find themselves in a paradoxical situation: they are witnessing a gradual 
decline in every defining aspect of who that person used to be, a death in slow motion, while 
the person is still physically alive. Overwhelmingly, relationships are severely affected and 
must be redefined in the context of dementia caregiving.

Boss (2016) describes this type of psychological loss as “ambiguous,” a paradoxical “here, 
but not here” (p. 270) situation resulting in a state of “frozen” grief. She proposes that 
this kind of grief defies existing grief theories where the expectation is for eventual 
closure. Instead, Boss (2016) advocates for a dialectical approach, where some of the main 
goals are to normalize ambivalence and find meaning and new hope. Similarly, Blandin 
and Pepin (2017) describe the experience of ambiguous loss as a liminal or transition 
state. Their model proposes therapeutic interventions at every major point in the process: 
“acknowledging loss in separation, tolerating difficult feelings in liminality, and behavioral 
adaptations in re-emergence” (Blandin & Pepin, 2017, p. 74).

GRIEF INTERVENTIONS

A number of interventions have been created to mitigate the effects of grief on dementia 
family caregivers’ mental health. Few focus on pre-death grief (Wilson et al., 2017) and 
even fewer address pre-death grief after care recipient’s placement in LTC (Paun et al., 
2015; Supiano et al., 2021). LTC placement is a turning point in the dementia caregiving 
experience marked by grief exacerbated by additional losses and guilt about placement. 
Supiano et al. (2021) created a 10-session group-based psycho-therapy intervention and 
tested it with caregivers whose family members with dementia resided in LTC and had a life 
expectancy of ≤6 months. Using a small sample (N = 25), this pilot study found significant 
improvement in participants’ pre-loss grief and in their ability to make sense of the situation 
and experience a sense of peace (Supiano et al., 2021).

Paun et al. (2015) created a 12-session, group-based chronic grief management intervention 
(CGMI) and tested it in a pre-test, multiple post-test quasi-experimental study with 83 
family caregivers (CGMI, n = 34; attention control, n = 49) whose family members with 
dementia resided in LTC. Findings indicated that the CGMI was feasible for implementation 
and resulted in significant improvement in caregivers’ knowledge about end-stage dementia 
and their heartfelt sadness and longing (subscale of the Marwit-Meuser Caregiver Grief 
Inventory [Marwit & Meuser, 2002]) at 3 months and a significant improvement in their 
sense of guilt about placement maintained at 6-month follow up.

Based on these promising results, Paun and Cothran (2019) adapted the CGMI to an 
eight weekly sessions, group-based online video format (CGMI-V). Session topics included 
knowledge about late-stage dementia, communication and conflict resolution, hands-on care 
skills (Sessions 1 through 4), and loss processing and grief management (Sessions 5 through 
8). The adapted CGMI-V intervention was tested in a pilot study with a single group of 
dementia family caregivers and was found feasible. Caregivers reported ease of technology 
use and ability to relate with each other in the virtual group format. The CGMI-V is now 
being tested in an ongoing clinical trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT# 03593070). A preliminary 
narrative analysis was conducted to compare loss and grief in study participants before (n 
= 10/three group cohorts) and during (n = 19/four group cohorts) the COVID-19 pandemic 
using transcripts of CGMI-V Session 5 that was dedicated to processing loss and separation 
from the care recipient through placement. Across cohorts, the majority of caregivers were 
adult children of care recipients.

Three major themes emerged across cohorts: (1) losses experienced through-out years of 
dementia caregiving, (2) separation aspects related to placement, and (3) the process of 
emotional acceptance of loss and separation. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic 
period, the experience of loss in the context of the pandemic was exacerbated by loss of 
control due to severe access restrictions (e.g., “No control over what happens with my 
loved one,” “No idea what’s going on with her,” “How she really is doing”) and anxiety 
about the unknown and uncertainty about their family member’s condition (e.g., “Don’t 
know what to expect anymore”). In addition, the experience of separation was exacerbated 
by the physical separation imposed by pandemic-related contact/access restrictions (e.g., 
“Not being able to visit, not even window visits, is painful and unfair…we can’t have a 
meaningful conversation over the phone or on the tablet”).

Overall, the process of emotional acceptance of loss and separation was described as 
unfolding across a continuum from complete lack of acceptance to spiritual acceptance pre- 
and during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., “I can’t accept it [separation], it’s inhumane”; 
“Accepting that one is doing their best under the circumstances”; “I am not a religious 
person, but I am spiritual and I feel acceptance when I am in nature”). In summary, 
these preliminary findings from the ongoing clinical trial emphasize the depth of loss 
in the context of dementia family caregiving post-placement and the added layer of 
burden imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions that severely affected the LTC 
environment.

IMPLICATIONS

Clinical

Bertuccio and Runion (2020) propose that clinicians consider grief reactions within 
specific personal and social contexts rather than through a pathological lens. Their 
argument is particularly pertinent in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic—a 
persistent, anxiety-producing reminder of endless losses and death for the past couple of 
years. In addition, for a deeper understanding of grief reactions, clinicians will want to 
acknowledge individuals’ historic contexts, where historical traumas across generations 
resulted in unresolved grief (e.g., Indigenous People of America, Black Americans, 
Holocaust survivors). For example, Moore et al. (2022) propose culturally appropriate grief 
interventions that take into account Black Americans’ deep sense of community connection 
and spirituality that were built along an extensive history of oppression and discrimination.

Loss and grief in the context of dementia caregiving imply additional clinical considerations. 
Meichsner et al. (2020) propose that grief assessment targets major changes occurring 
along the terminal illness trajectory (e.g., dementia), including changes in the caregiver’s 
relationship with the care recipient, caregiver’s understanding of the disease process, and 
their preparedness for the death of the care recipient. The idea of pre-loss preparedness 
through making sense of the dementia situation and framing eventual death as an end 
to suffering was found to benefit family caregivers after the death of their care recipient 
(Supiano et al., 2022). Moreover, Boss (2016) proposes dementia-specific grief interventions 
that are focused on building caregiver resilience rather than closure. Her intervention

guidelines include: “finding meaning, adjusting mastery, reconstructing identity, normalizing 
ambivalence, revisiting attachments, and discovering new hope” (Boss, 2016, p. 274).

Research

For decades, dementia family caregiving research remained focused on interventions 
addressing stress and burden that consistently yielded modest effects on caregivers’ mental 
health outcomes (Park & Park, 2015). The shift toward a paradigm that takes into account 
the loss and grief associated with the dementia caregiving process is promising. However, 
pre-loss grief is understudied. One systematic review (Wilson et al., 2017) evaluating the 
effectiveness of pre-loss psychosocial grief interventions for dementia family caregivers 
identified only three studies, with only one randomized clinical trial. Thus, there is a definite 
need to design and test grief-focused interventions for dementia family caregivers. Finding 
effective grief interventions that can be translated into clinical and community-based 
environments is necessary to alleviate dementia caregivers’ emotional distress, improve their 
quality of life, and indirectly save precious resources in an already overwhelmed U.S. health 
care system.

CONCLUSION

As a universal reaction to perceived and/or actual loss, grief has to be considered within 
personal, social, and historical contexts. Grief in reaction to long-term losses associated 
with dementia family caregiving requires complex interventions that take into account its 
ambiguous nature and aim to assist caregivers in finding meaning rather than closure. Mental 
health care providers must assess and intervene without pathologizing grief.
