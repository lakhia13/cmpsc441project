Abstract
In current classification systems, selective mutism (SM) is included in the broad anxiety disorders category. Indeed, there 
is abundant evidence showing that anxiety, and social anxiety in particular, is a prominent feature of SM. In this article, we 
point out that autism spectrum problems in addition to anxiety problems are sometimes also implicated in SM. To build our 
case, we summarize evidence showing that SM, social anxiety disorder (SAD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are 
allied clinical conditions and share communalities in the realm of social difficulties. Following this, we address the role of 
a prototypical class of ASD symptoms, restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests (RRBIs), which are hypothesized 
to play a special role in the preservation and exacerbation of social difficulties. We then substantiate our point that SM is 
sometimes more than an anxiety disorder by addressing its special link with ASD in more detail. Finally, we close by noting 
that the possible involvement of ASD in SM has a number of consequences for clinical practice with regard to its classifica-
tion, assessment, and treatment of children with SM and highlight a number of directions for future research.

Introduction

Two Cases

Ibi is a 10-year-old boy of an Algerian immigrant family 
who was born in the Netherlands. His parents speak a mix 
of Arabic (father), Dutch and French (mother), and at home 
the boy is perfectly able to express himself in all three lan-
guages. In fact, most of the time, he is quite noisy, con-
tinuously chatting to his younger brother while they play. 
However, the picture at school is totally different: Ibi does 
not utter a single word during the whole day. When entering 
school in the morning, the teacher greets him in a friendly

manner, but Ibi only nods in a grumpy way and does not 
respond verbally. In class, he follows the instructions of the 
teacher and conducts all the tasks as long as they are non-
verbal in nature. Ibi is never observed talking to his peers; in 
general, he is quite shy and withdrawn at school, but some-
times he uses gestures to clarify his intentions and needs. For 
instance, during the lunch break, when the class is playing 
dodgeball, Ibi is eager to join the game. However, he is not 
shouting like the other children but constantly waving his 
arms, trying to prompt his teammates to throw the ball to 
him. He seems frustrated when they are not responsive to 
this request and sometimes roughly pushes other children 
aside.

Leo is the 11-year-old son of a native Dutch couple who 
has been referred by the neurologist who could not find a 
somatic cause for the boy’s recurrent severe headaches. The 
doctor in the hospital noted that Leo was tense and nervous 
and remained totally silent during the two consultations that 
he had with the boy and his parents. The parents confirm 
that Leo can remain totally mute when meeting unfamiliar 
people. He prefers to avoid or withdraw from such situations, 
but when unable to do so he does not speak at all and at 
times even displays strange, regressive behaviors. Leo then 
assumes a shrunken position, closes his eyes, and sucks on

his thumb. The teacher at school has also experienced this 
once when Leo had to provide a speech in front of the class. 
She reports that Leo sometimes exchanges a few words in 
private with her before or after school and that he lately 
whispers silently to the boy sitting next to him, but he has 
never spoken out loud in class.

Both boys were diagnosed with selective mutism (SM), 
a psychiatric condition typically occurring during child-
hood that is characterized by a consistent failure to speak 
in specific social situations in which there is an expectation 
for speaking (e.g., at school) despite displaying the capa-
bility to speak normally in other situations (like at home; 
American Psychiatric Association [APA] 2013). Ibi and Leo 
were referred to an outpatient facility specialized in the treat-
ment of childhood anxiety disorders. These referrals seemed 
appropriate given the prominent role of anxiety, and in par-
ticular social anxiety, in the clinical picture of this psychiat-
ric disorder (e.g., Driessen et al. 2020; Muris and Ollendick 
2015), which has resulted in its allocation to the category 
of anxiety disorders in current versions of classification 
systems including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders (DSM-5; APA 2013) and the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD-11; World Health Organi-
zation [WHO] 2018). A standardized questionnaire taken 
at the clinic confirmed the presence of anxiety problems 
and revealed clinically elevated scores, not only for social 
anxiety (both boys), but also for a number of other anxiety 
problems such as separation anxiety (Ibi), generalized anxi-
ety (Leo), and specific phobias (both boys).

However, during additional assessment it became clear 
that the psychopathology of both boys was far more com-
plicated.  A  detailed  developmental  anamnesis  revealed 
social peculiarities from the beginning of life for both boys, 
including abnormalities in responsive social behaviors such 
as smiling and eye contact, a lack of interest in other chil-
dren, reduced sharing of emotions and intentions, and recur-
rent problems with peers. Further, it was noted that Ibi and 
Leo had an insistence on sameness and were easily upset 
by small changes in daily routines and unexpected events. 
Both of them had at least one special preoccupation (Ibi: 
Pokémon; Leo: numbers), regularly displayed repetitive 
behavior (Ibi: in the past hand flapping, nowadays typical 
hand movements; Leo: lining up toys), and at times were 
difficult to handle because of rigidity in their behavior.1 

1  In Leo this mainly occurred when he was upset due to a (for him) 
distressing  situation,  but  in  Ibi  these  problems  mainly  occurred  at 
home when he was asked to do something or when his actions were 
corrected, displaying more behavior of an oppositional-defiant nature. 
The two boys were also different in terms of intellectual functioning, 
with Ibi having an estimated total IQ of 81 (assessed by means of the 
revised  Snijders-Oomen  Non-Verbal  Intelligence  Test;  Tellegen  & 
Laros, 1993) and receiving special needs education, and Leo display-
ing a total IQ of 126 (with a large discrepancy between the verbal and 
non-verbal  scores,  respectively  103  versus  144,  measured  with  the 

Given these persistent deficits in social communication and 
social interaction across various contexts and the presence of 
rigid, restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and 
activities, a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
also seemed justified (APA 2013). However, this comorbid-
ity is formally not permitted because classification systems 
such as DSM-5 and ICD-10 indicate the presence of ASD 
as an exclusion criterion for defining SM.

The cases of Ibi and Leo nicely illustrate what we view 
as the clinical trinity of abnormal social behavior, which 
consists of SM, SAD, and ASD. The key point that we want 
to make in this review is that SM, at least in some children 
diagnosed with this condition, is more than just an anxiety 
disorder and SAD in particular, but that ASD-related fea-
tures be present as well (Holka-Pokorska et al. 2018). The 
structure of this review is as follows. First, we will describe 
the diagnostic features of SM, the prevalence of this dis-
order, and its development and course. Then, we will look 
at relations between SM and SAD and between SM and 
ASD. Next, we discuss the commonalities and differences 
in social difficulties of the three disorders in some detail. 
Following this, we address the role of a prototypical class 
of ASD symptoms, restricted and repetitive behaviors and 
interests (RRBIs), which we hypothesize to play a special 
role in the preservation and exacerbation of social difficul-
ties. Subsequently, we will substantiate our point that SM is 
sometimes more than an anxiety disorder by addressing its 
special link with ASD. Finally, we will discuss implications 
for the classification, assessment, and treatment of children 
and adolescents displaying SM and co-occurring social dif-
ficulties as well as point out directions for future research 
on this disorder.

Selective Mutism (SM)

The  prominent  feature  of  SM  is  that  children  with  this 
condition do not initiate speech or do not respond when 
spoken to by others in specific situations (e.g., in school 
or when meeting unfamiliar adults or peers), whereas they 
are perfectly able to speak in other settings (e.g., at home 
with their parents and siblings, with other family members 
such as grandparents, and with close friends). To make the 
diagnosis, the DSM-5 (APA 2013) requires that the failure 
to speak in certain situations is not attributable to a lack

attending  a  regular  primary  school.  Further,  Leo  appeared  to  a  have 
a  hypersensitivity  for  sounds  (including  a  dislike  of  his  own  voice), 
whereas  Ibi  did  not  show  such  a  sensitivity  and  sometimes  at  home 
could produce a blast of noise.

of knowledge of, or discomfort with, the spoken language 
required in these situations. Further, the duration of the dis-
turbance is at least one month (and should not be limited to 
the first 4 weeks in school), and the problem should interfere 
with the educational (or occupational) achievement or social 
communication of the young person. Finally, the disturbance 
is not better explained by a communication disorder (e.g., 
childhood-onset fluency disorder) and does not occur exclu-
sively during the course of ASD (which is a point that will 
be addressed in more detail later), schizophrenia, or another 
psychotic disorder.

Although not explicitly indicated in the diagnostic cri-
teria, anxiety, and in particular social anxiety, is a common 
feature of children with SM. However, other problems such 
as oppositional behavior and (mild) language and communi-
cation problems may also be present. In an interesting study 
by Cohan et al. (2008), symptoms of 130 children aged 5 
to 12 years who were diagnosed with SM were examined 
by means of latent class analysis in order to identify sub-
groups of the disorder. A three-class model was found that 
provided the best fit for the data. Class 1 represented 44.6% 
of the total sample and consisted of children with clinically 
elevated scores for social anxiety and borderline clinical 
scores of behavioral problems, which was labelled as the 
anxious-mildly oppositional group. Class 2 contained 43.1% 
of the sample and included children with clinically signifi-
cant scores for social anxiety and borderline clinical levels 
of language and speech problems. This class was labelled 
as the anxious-communication delayed group. Class 3 con-
sisted of 12.3% of the sample and contained children who 
only had clinically elevated anxiety scores and were labelled 
as the exclusively anxious group. These findings indicate 
that in most children with SM anxiety is a prominent fea-
ture, although in a substantial proportion other problems are 
present as well, making it a rather heterogeneous disorder.

There is general consensus that SM is a rare psychiatric 
condition, although epidemiological studies on its occur-
rence are relatively scarce. Two studies assessed the preva-
lence of the disorder in clinical populations. In one study, 
Carlson et al. (1994) asked psychiatrists working in child 
and adolescent mental health settings whether they had ever 
diagnosed and/or treated a young person with SM. Sixty-
five per cent of the 308 participating psychiatrists responded 
positively to this question and a total of 670 children with 
the disorder were identified. Based on an estimation of the 
total number of patients that the psychiatrists had seen dur-
ing their career, the overall prevalence of SM was estimated 
at 0.11%. In another investigation, Steinhausen and Juzi 
(1996) directly searched the case files of two child and ado-
lescent psychiatry clinics in Zurich, Switzerland and Ber-
lin, Germany, which yielded prevalence rates of 0.44% and 
0.54%, respectively. Other researchers have examined the 
prevalence of SM in school-based samples by first asking 

teachers to identify extremely shy and reticent children in 
their classrooms, after which a psychological and/or psychi-
atric assessment was conducted to establish whether these 
children met the diagnostic criteria of the disorder. Using 
this approach, prevalence rates varied between 0.03 and 
1.89% (Bergman et al. 2002: 0.71%; Elizur and Perednik 
2003: 0.76%; Karakaya et al. 2008: 0.03%; Kumpulainen 
et al. 1998: 1.89%; Sharkey and McNicholas 2012: 0.18%), 
depending on sample characteristics, informants and assess-
ment instruments, and exact diagnostic criteria employed to 
define the disorder.

SM is typically an early-onset disorder, starting usually 
before the age of 5 years and often becoming a focus of clini-
cal attention when children enter school (Kristensen 2000). 
Symptoms tend to decrease as children become older. For 
example, in the study by Bergman et al. (2002), 12 kinder-
garten, first and second grade children with SM were fol-
lowed for a 6-month period, and it was noted that accord-
ing to the teachers the frequency of the speaking behavior 
significantly increased while social anxiety substantially 
decreased over the 6 months. However, scores of the chil-
dren with SM remained higher than the normative range. 
Moreover, findings from long-term follow-up studies show 
that although the prototypical muteness gradually diminishes 
in most cases, social and communication problems tend to 
continue into adolescence and even adulthood (Remschmidt 
et al. 2001; Steinhausen et al. 2006). Most research has 
shown that SM, just like most other members of the anxiety 
disorders family, is more common among girls than boys 
(e.g., Elizur and Perednik 2003; Kumpulainen et al. 1998; 
Sharkey and McNicholas 2012), but some studies do not 
report such a gender difference (e.g., Bergman et al., 2002). 
Moreover, another investigation even found a preponderance 
of boys over girls (Karakaya et al., 2008).

Relations Between SM and SAD/ASD

In this section, we will summarize existing evidence on the 
link between SM and two other types of psychopathology 
that are also characterized by social difficulties, namely SAD 
and ASD. The primary focus will be on comorbidity data; 
however, if such data are not available, we will describe 
other findings that support the notion that SM is related in 
meaningful ways to both SAD and ASD.

SM and SAD

The key feature of SAD is a marked and disproportionate 
fear or anxiety about one or more social situations involv-
ing exposure to possible critical evaluation by others (APA 
2013). In children, the fear and anxiety must also occur in 
peer settings and not just during interactions with adults.

Examples include typical school situations such as answer-
ing a question of the teacher or writing on the blackboard as 
well as extracurricular activities such as performing in front 
of others during musical events or sports, starting or join-
ing in on a conversation, and eating in a restaurant or other 
public places (Beidel et al. 1999). A particularly strong link 
has been noted between SM and SAD, and the evidence for 
this relationship comes from at least four lines of research.
The first line of research consists of studies in which 
(semi)structured clinical interviews were administered to 
study comorbidity patterns of SM with other anxiety disor-
ders. This research has indicated that up to 80% of the chil-
dren with SM also meet the diagnostic criteria for another 
anxiety  disorder,  of  which  SAD  is  the  most  frequently 
established comorbid condition. For example, in a recent 
meta-analysis comprising a total sample of 837 children 
with SM, Driessen et al. (2020) found that, on average, 69% 
of the children were also diagnosed with SAD. Admittedly, 
this percentage was quite variable across the 22 included 
studies, with multiple investigations reporting percentages 
of 100%, but also one study reporting a percentage as low 
as 0% (Nowakowski et al. 2011). Note, however, that in all 
these studies SAD was classified as a categorical disorder 
rather than as a dimensional phenomenon, and that it thus 
remains possible that even in the absence of a formal diag-
nosis subclinical levels of social anxiety symptoms may still 
have been present.

The second research line indeed relies more on the notion 
that psychopathological phenomena should be viewed on a 
continuum and explores to what extent children with SM 
display varying levels of social anxiety and several other 
types of symptoms. The aforementioned study by Cohan 
et al. (2008) is a good example of such an approach, and in 
general this type of research has shown that although SM 
is associated with a heterogeneous set of symptoms, social 
anxiety appears to be a prominent feature that is present in 
almost all children with this psychiatric condition (see also 
Diliberto and Kearney 2016, 2018; Schwenck et al. 2019).

A third line of inquiry, which surprisingly has only been 
undertaken quite recently, has used the method of directly 
investigating the content of the fears and fear-related cogni-
tions of children with SM. Vogel et al. (2019), for instance, 
used an online survey containing an open-ended question 
asking 65 children with SM (aged 8–18 years) to specify 
the content of their fear in situations in which they were 
expected but not able to speak. Further, children with SM 
but also children with SAD (n = 18) and typically develop-
ing children (n = 51) were asked to complete a questionnaire 
containing a set of fear-related cognitions that might occur 
in speech-demanding situations. Qualitative content analysis 
of the responses that children with SM gave to the open-
ended question revealed that fears belonging conceptually 
to SAD were most prominent (59%). Other fear categories 

reported by Vogel et al. (2019) were fear of making mis-
takes (e.g., fear of giving a wrong answer), language-related 
fears (e.g., fear of not finding the right words, fear of poor 
articulation), and voice-related fears (i.e., fear that one’s 
voice sounds funny or odd), but one could argue that these 
fears—although somewhat atypical in content—are strongly 
indicative of social anxiety as well. On the self-constructed 
questionnaire, children with SM displayed equally high lev-
els of negative fear cognitions as children with SAD, with 
both clinical groups showing significantly higher scores than 
the group of typically developing children.

A fourth and final line of research is concerned with the 
temperament typology of behavioral inhibition (BI), which 
has been defined as the tendency to react with shyness, dis-
tress, and withdrawal in response to novel and challenging 
situations (Kagan 1994). Various studies have shown that BI 
is a consistent correlate of SAD (e.g., Ollendick and Benoit 
2012), and most importantly a meta-analysis of Clauss and 
Blackford (2012) revealed that this temperament factor is 
associated with a greater than sevenfold increase in the risk 
for developing this anxiety disorder. Interestingly, a number 
of recent studies have investigated this temperament factor 
in children with SM. For example, Gensthaler et al. (2016a) 
compared levels of BI in children aged 3 to 18 years with 
SM, SAD, or other internalizing behaviors, and healthy con-
trols using the parent-rated Retrospective Infant Behavioral 
Inhibition (RIBI) questionnaire (Gensthaler et al. 2012). 
The results indicated that children with SM and SAD were 
reported to be more inhibited when they were infants and 
toddlers than children with other internalizing behaviors and 
healthy controls. Further, it was found that children with 
SM even showed higher total BI scores and in particular on 
the RIBI subscale referring to shyness than children with 
SAD. In another study by Muris et al. (2016), 57 non-clinical 
children aged 3 to 6 years performed two speech tasks to 
assess their absolute amount of spoken words, while their 
parents completed a set of questionnaires for measuring chil-
dren’s levels of SM and social anxiety symptoms as well 
as BI. Significant associations were noted among all these 
variables, but the correlation between BI and SM symptoms 
was particularly robust (r = 0.64), and it was also found that 
this temperament characteristic was the best predictor of 
the number of spoken words during the standardized speech 
tasks. Altogether, these findings indicate that BI, which has 
been established as an important risk factor for SAD, is also 
implicated in SM, and this of course underlines the connec-
tion between both disorders.

In conclusion, there is considerable evidence from vari-
ous types of research for the strong link between SM and 
social anxiety. That is, children with SM are often diagnosed 
with comorbid SAD, display high levels of social anxiety 
symptoms, have fears and fear cognitions that are highly 
comparable in terms of content and severity, and share a 

1 3298

similar  temperamental  vulnerability  (i.e.,  BI)  as  those 
reported by young people with SAD (Chavira et al. 2007). 
The relation between SM and SAD is so intimate that it has 
been argued by some scholars that the two are one and the 
same disorder (Bögels et al. 2010). Some advocates of this 
idea have suggested that SM should be considered as a more 
extreme variant of SAD (e.g., Black and Uhde 1992), while 
others have put forward that SM can best be seen as an early 
developmental manifestation of SAD (e.g., Bergman et al. 
2002).

SM and ASD

ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by (1) 
persistent deficits in the reciprocal social communication 
and social interaction, and (2) restricted, repetitive patterns 
of behavior and interests (RRBIs; APA 2013). ASD is cur-
rently perceived as a spectrum disorder, which means that 
we no longer classify children with this psychiatric condition 
in separate diagnostic categories such as autistic disorder, 
Asperger’s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett’s 
disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not other-
wise specified (APA 1994), but rather qualify the severity of 
the deficits and problems on a three-level scale ranging from 
mild (requiring support) to severe (requiring very substantial 
support; APA 2013).

Research on the link between SM and ASD is sparse. The 
main reason seems to be the artificial boundary that clas-
sification systems have placed between both disorders. For 
example, in DSM-5 (APA 2013) it is noted that the failure to 
speak as the key feature of SM should not exclusively occur 
during the course of ASD, which in practice is quite dif-
ficult to determine given that the latter disorder is currently 
perceived as a dimension, which implies that the demar-
cation between SM and ASD has become more blurred. 
Ever since SM was included in the psychiatric classifica-
tion systems, researchers (and clinicians; see Simms 2017; 
Snyder et al. 2008) have struggled with the ASD-related 
exclusion criterion and tended to ignore the co-occurrence 
of both disorders. For example, in the study by Anderson 
and Thomsen (1998) who described the sociodemographic 
and clinical features of 37 clinically referred cases with SM, 
it was found that nearly half of the children showed signifi-
cant developmental problems. Only a substantial minority 
of them (8.1%) met the criteria of Asperger’s syndrome, but 
it is important to note that children with more severe ASD 
had already been excluded from the sample because these 
problems were considered as too pervasive to be relevant in 
relation to SM. Another investigation by Kristensen (2000) 
adopted a similar approach and noted that 7.4% of the chil-
dren with SM fulfilled the criteria for Asperger’s disorder, 
whereas on a teacher questionnaire for measuring symptoms 

of Asperger’s syndrome a considerably higher percentage 
(25.5%) showed elevated scores.

In a population-based study of 2973 Swedish school chil-
dren aged 7 to 15 years, Kopp and Gillberg (1997) detected 
five children with SM using a teacher-based screening ques-
tionnaire. Due to the procedural set-up of the study, only 
two of these five children were subjected to an in-depth neu-
ropsychiatric examination and it appeared that one of them 
had clear signs of ASD. Besides the absence of speech in the 
presence of strangers, this child also displayed severe empa-
thy problems, showed little social awareness of others, had 
no friends, and exhibited a circumscribed interest involving 
rote memory learning. The researchers were cautious enough 
to interpret the presence of ASD in SM as a chance finding, 
but also noted that both disorders could be associated in 
a meaningful manner but that this can only be ascertained 
when classification systems allow the two conditions to be 
diagnosed in the same individual.

Cholemkery et al. (2014) explored the extent to which SM 
(and SAD) and ASD can be differentiated in terms of impair-
ments in social interactions. Parents of 6- to 18-year-old chil-
dren with SM (n = 43), SAD (n = 38), and ASD (n = 60) as 
well as typically developing children (n = 42) completed the 
Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS; Constantino and Gruber 
2005), which measures five symptom domains indicative 
of ASD, namely social awareness, social cognition, social 
communication, social motivation, and autistic mannerisms. 
The results showed that children with ASD, SM, and SAD 
displayed higher SRS scores than the typically developing 
children. Further, there was considerable overlap among 
the three disorders, although children with ASD generally 
showed the highest levels of social interaction impairments. 
However, on two domains (i.e., social communication and 
social motivation) children with SM also displayed elevated 
scores (as compared to children with SAD), which suggests 
that they were relatively high on the autism spectrum and 
thus showed at least some signs of this neurodevelopmental 
disorder.

More recently, Steffenburg et al. (2018) conducted a study 
in which the comorbidity between SM and ASD was inves-
tigated in a systematic way. The medical records of 97 clini-
cally referred children between 4 and 18 years of age were 
analyzed in detail to retrospectively verify the presence of 
autism spectrum problems, thereby forgoing the exclusion 
criterion prescribed by classification systems such as DSM 
and ICD. During the initial intake assessment, children and 
parents had been subjected to an extensive diagnostic pro-
cedure that also included specific instruments for measur-
ing symptoms of ASD. All children had received SM as the 
primary diagnosis on the basis of the referral question and 
which treatment had been initiated, but the additional post-
hoc analysis by Steffenburg et al. revealed that 61 (62.9%) 
of the children with SM could also be diagnosed with ASD.

299

More precisely, in DSM-IV (APA 1994) terminology, 28 
(28.9%) of them had autistic disorder, 4 (4.1%) had Asper-
ger’s syndrome, and 29 (29.9%) had pervasive developmen-
tal disorder-not otherwise specified. Moreover, a substan-
tial number of the children who did not receive a formal 
ASD diagnosis (n = 19, 19.6%) still displayed “subclinical” 
autistic features, which means that only 17 (17.5%) of the 
children with SM showed no overt signs of ASD. Admit-
tedly, this study was conducted in a clinic specializing in the 
assessment and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders, 
which may have guided referral patterns and increased the 
likelihood of detecting ASD thereby inflating the comor-
bidity rates. Nevertheless, the findings provide support for 
the idea that SM and ASD are two disorders that can and 
frequently do co-occur.

A recent investigation by Klein et al. (2019) resulted in a 
similar conclusion. For 42 children 2 to 13 years of age who 
were referred to a university community clinic for individu-
als with communication disorders and who met the DSM-5 
criteria for SM, parents and teachers completed the Behav-
ior Assessment System for Children (BASC; Reynolds and 
Kamphaus 2015). The BASC is a standardized instrument 
for measuring internalizing problems, externalizing prob-
lems, and adaptive skills in young people. It also contains a 
clinical index comprising specific items referring to devel-
opmental social problems, atypicality, and withdrawal that 
are indicative of the possible presence of ASD (Volker et al. 
2010; Zhou et al. 2020). The results showed that the children 
with SM displayed more internalizing symptoms and more 
problems with adaptive skills than externalizing symptoms. 
Most interestingly, however, the study revealed that 80% of 
the children scored above the cut-off on the autism prob-
ability index, with many of them displaying communication 
problems, persistent withdrawal, difficulties with develop-
ing and maintaining social relationships, and unusual behav-
iors. This finding led the researchers to conclude that further 
screening for ASD in children with SM is indicated.

In another study, Stein et al. (2011) examined whether 
SM and ASD share pathophysiological features. Participants 
were 99 nuclear families that included 106 children with 
SM for which a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in the contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNT-
NAP2), which is considered to be a susceptibility gene for 
ASD, were genotyped. The results indicated that the SNP 
rs2710102 was significantly associated with the presence of 
SM. Interestingly, in a separate sample of young adults, the 
pertinent polymorphism also appeared to be accompanied 
by an increased risk of scoring high on social anxiety-related 
traits. On the basis of these findings, it was concluded that 
on a genetic level, SM, SAD, and ASD appear to share a 
similar susceptibility factor. Therefore, Stein et al. (2011) 
raised a cautionary flag regarding the classification of SM 
as a pure anxiety disorder by noting that there might be 

“considerable heterogeneity in the SM syndrome such that 
some forms … are more closely allied with the ASD spec-
trum and its association with CNTNAP2” (p. 830).

A recent investigation by Muris (2020) examined the 
relationship between SM and ASD in a non-clinical popu-
lation. Parents of 172 children 3 to 6 years of age who were 
recruited via day care and preschool facilities as well as 
online platforms (e.g., facebook) completed a survey con-
taining scales for measuring symptoms of SM, ASD, and 
SAD. The results showed that there were statistically signifi-
cant positive correlations between SM and ASD (r = 0.43) 
as well as SAD (r = 0.67). These findings indicated that 
higher levels of SM symptoms were associated with higher 
symptom levels of both ASD and SAD. Most interestingly, 
hierarchical regression analysis revealed that ASD symp-
toms accounted for an extra proportion of the variance in 
SM symptoms (2%) after controlling for the influence of 
SAD symptoms, which emerged as the most robust predic-
tor. These findings point out that although social anxiety 
appears to be the most prominent feature of SM, autism 
spectrum symptoms also make a significant contribution to 
this disorder.

There is also tentative support for the presence of ASD-
related cognitive deficits in children with SM. Nowakowski 
et al. (2011) aimed to examine the quality of interactions 
between children with SM and their parents by focusing on 
joint attention processes. Joint attention can be defined as 
the shared focus of two individuals (in this case: the child 
and the parent) on an object or event that is achieved when 
one individual alerts another by means of eye-gazing, point-
ing, or verbal or non-verbal indications (Moore and Dun-
ham 1995), which is an ability that plays a role in children’s 
acquisition of adaptive social behavior and has been found to 
be impaired in young people with ASD (e.g., Mundy 2016). 
In their study, Nowakowski et al. compared 19 children with 
SM, 18 children with mixed anxiety, and 26 children with 
a typical development (all in the age range of 5 to 8 years) 
with regard to their level of joint attention. Joint attention 
was assessed by direct coding of interactions between chil-
dren and their parents who were observed in two experi-
mental conditions (i.e., unstructured free play versus struc-
tured tasks such as talking about the child’s last birthday and 
preparing the child for a speech in front of a camera). No 
differences were noted among the three groups of children 
with regard to joint attention behaviors in the unstructured 
free play condition. However, under more structured con-
ditions, children with SM and their parents were found to 
establish significantly fewer joint attention episodes follow-
ing parental initiation as compared to children and parents 
in the mixed anxiety and the typically developing groups. 
Nowakowski et al. (2011) interpreted this finding in terms 
of stress-related coping behavior, suggesting that “children 
with SM may withdraw from their parents during stressful 

1 3300

situations” (p. 78). However, it is also possible that children 
with SM exhibit a cognitive deficit that is similar to that 
observed in children with ASD, which of course would fur-
ther underscore the relation between these two disorders.

Altogether, emerging evidence suggests that there is a 
relationship between SM and ASD. This is most clearly 
underscored by the study of Steffenburg et al. (2018) in 
which after a thorough clinical assessment a comorbidity 
rate between these two disorders as high as 62.9% was docu-
mented. In another sample of clinically referred children 
with SM, Klein et al. (2019) noted that no less than 80% 
surpassed the cut-off score of the autism probability index 
of the BASC-3. It should be noted, however, that the Steffen-
burg et al. study was conducted in a specific clinical setting 
in which diagnoses were obtained retrospectively. Further, 
the Klein et al. investigation relied upon a standardized ques-
tionnaire instead of a formal diagnostic instrument. Thus, 
both studies have their limitations. In other investigations 
much lower comorbidity rates have been reported (i.e., Kris-
tensen 2000; 7.4%; Anderson and Thomsen 1998: 8.1%), but 
the methodology of these studies can be criticized because 
children with more severe forms of ASD were excluded.

Further research has shown that children with SM and 
children  with  ASD  display  overlap  in  social  interaction 
impairments (Cholemkery et al. 2014) and appear to share 
a similar genetic liability (Stein et al. 2011). In addition, 
in typically developing children, a significant association 
was found between symptoms of both disorders even when 
controlling for concurrent symptoms of SAD (Muris 2020). 
Finally, tentative support has been obtained demonstrating 
that children with SM exhibit a specific cognitive deficit 
(i.e., impairments in joint attention) that is also characteristic 
for young people with ASD (Nowakowski et al. 2011). Obvi-
ously, the current body of evidence on the link between SM 
and ASD is still rather meagre, but it seems worthwhile to go 
beyond the artificial boundary that has been placed between 
both disorders and to conduct more research to investigate 
their relation in more detail.

Commonalities and Differences in Social 
Difficulties of SM, SAD, and ASD

Apart from the observed links between SM and SAD/ASD, 
there is also evidence that children with ASD frequently 
display SAD (Davis et al. 2014; Spain et al. 2018; White 
et al. 2009a, b). Thus, SM, SAD, and ASD can be viewed as 
three allied psychiatric conditions. At a categorical level the 
three disorders frequently co-occur, while at a dimensional 
level symptoms of these disorders are substantially corre-
lated and sometimes similarities are so prominent that it is 
difficult to distinguish them from one another (e.g., Kerns 
and Kendall 2012). In this section, we zoom in on various 

social difficulties associated with SM, SAD, and ASD with a 
focus on communalities as well as differences. More specifi-
cally, we will consider four aspects that are highly relevant 
for understanding social functioning and dysfunctioning: 
(1) emotional responses in social situations, or more briefly, 
social emotion, (2) social cognition, (3) social skills, and (4) 
social motivation (Pallathra et al. 2018).

Social Emotion

Social emotion refers to emotional reactions that occur dur-
ing social interactions, when being observed, or when per-
forming in front of others. The reactions critically depend 
on thoughts, feelings, and actions of other people, which 
can either be experienced, recalled, anticipated, or imagined 
(Smith et al. 2006). With regard to our trinity of social dis-
orders, most research is concerned with the basic emotion 
of anxiety. Obviously, this emotion reflects the key symp-
tom of SAD (i.e., fear of negative evaluation and possible 
scrutiny by others) but also appears to be present in SM and 
ASD. It is important to note that anxiety as an emotion can 
be expressed in three response systems: namely subjective/
cognitive, physiological, and behavioral (Lang 1968). When 
looking at anxiety in children with SAD, the prototypical 
picture involves a clear activation of all three response sys-
tems. In that case, children report high levels of subjective 
fear (i.e., “I feel really anxious”) and fear-related cognitions 
that are concerned with being negatively evaluated or scru-
tinized by others (e.g., “Others think that I am stupid”, “Oth-
ers don’t like me”), report intense somatic symptoms such as 
palpitations, sweating, trembling, and blushing, and finally, 
withdraw from or totally avoid certain social situations (e.g., 
Stein and Stein 2008).

In children with SM, the picture is less clear. The ear-
lier described study of Vogel et al. (2019) gives some clue 
about the subjective/cognitive experience of anxiety in 
children with SM: their fears and fear cognitions strongly 
resembled those of children with SAD, although some 
fear phenomena had an atypical, more idiosyncratic con-
tent (e.g., “I think my voice sounds funny”, “I don’t know 
how the conversation will evolve”). However, virtually 
nothing is known about the physiological and behavioral 
expression of anxiety in SM. It has been suggested though 
that, when facing a social situation that requires them to 
speak, children with SM physically become so tense that 
they resort to muteness as an avoidant strategy to reduce 
this  physiological  arousal.  In  a  study  by  Young  et  al. 
(2012), some evidence was obtained for such a scenario. 
Five- to 12-year-old children with SM (n = 10, eight of 
whom  were  also  diagnosed  with  SAD),  SAD  (n = 11, 
but none of whom had SM), or no psychiatric disorder 
(n = 14) were prompted (a) to have a conversation with 
an unfamiliar peer, and (b) to read aloud a story in front 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021) 24:294–325 

301

of a small audience consisting of an adult and a peer. 
It was found that in spite of the fact that children with 
SM (similar to those with SAD) exhibited significantly 
higher subjective fear levels in response to these socially 
challenging situations (in comparison to children with no 
diagnosis), they showed the lowest levels of physiological 
arousal. Young et al. (2012) tentatively concluded that 
“the decreased arousal displayed by these children repre-
sents successful avoidance of a distressful situation” (p. 
539). This suggests that muteness, being the key feature 
of children with SM, can better be viewed on a symptom 
level rather than considered as a full diagnostic entity, 
which is an issue to which we will return later in this 
review.

As noted earlier, the expression of social anxiety in 
children with ASD is in part similar to but may also devi-
ate somewhat from what has been noted in children with 
SAD without autistic characteristics. More precisely, on 
the subjective/cognitive level, many children with ASD 
indicate  that  they  fear  being  scrutinized  or  negatively 
evaluated  by  others.  On  the  physiological  level,  they 
experience high levels of arousal, and on the behavioral 
level, a clear tendency towards avoidance and withdrawal 
can be noted (Kerns and Kendall 2012, 2014). However, 
as noted by Ollendick and White (2012) there might be 
unique processes underlying the social anxiety of children 
with ASD, which may lead to a quite different emotional 
expression. In particular, the RRBIs exhibited by children 
with ASD could play a role here. For example, insistence 
on sameness (which can easily be elicited by unexpected 
changes  in  social  events),  difficulties  with  perceiving 
emotions of oneself and others (which can result in mis-
interpretation of social situations), and hypersensitivity to 
sensory input (which is particularly problematic in situ-
ations where a lot of people are present) are typical ASD 
symptoms that might fuel feelings of fear and anxiety 
and lead to frantic efforts to escape from or avoid certain 
social settings and increased self-injurious and aggressive 
behavior (Kerns et al. 2014). Although direct evidence for 
such scenarios is lacking, there is at least some research 
showing that high levels of social anxiety in children with 
ASD are associated with aggressive behavior (Pugliese 
et al. 2013).

Taken together, in terms of social emotion, similarities 
exist between SM, SAD, and ASD in that anxiety seems 
to be a prominent feature of the social functioning in chil-
dren with each of these disorders. Meanwhile, there might 
be differences in the precise expression of anxiety: chil-
dren with SAD display the prototypical picture of social 
anxiety (which is concerned with fear of negative evalua-
tion and possible scrutiny by others), whereas in children 
with SM and ASD this emotion may also manifest itself 
in a more atypical way.

Social Cognition

Social  cognition  can  be  defined  as  the  capacity  to  per-
ceive, interpret, and respond to the intentions, emotions, 
and behavior of other people and as such is concerned with 
cognitive processes that play a role in social interactions 
(Frith 2008). In the literature, four interrelated domains of 
social cognition have been identified, namely mentalizing 
(i.e., attributing mental states such as emotions, beliefs, and 
desires to other people), emotion recognition (i.e., infer-
ring the emotional state of another person on the basis of 
facial, postural, or vocal expressions), social knowledge (i.e., 
awareness of social rules and norms in different social set-
tings), and attributional style (i.e., the way people explain 
the course of social events; Pinkham et al. 2014). Within 
our trinity of social disorders, deficits in social cognition 
are most prominent in children with ASD. More precisely, 
children with autism spectrum problems appear to display 
clear deficiencies in all four domains of social cognition.

The most compelling evidence for this conclusion has 
been shown for the domain of mentalizing. Most of this 
research has focused on the concept of ‘theory of mind’, the 
meta-representational ability to impute mental states to one-
self and others (Premack and Woodruff 1978). In their semi-
nal study, Baron-Cohen et al. (1985) examined children with 
ASD (n = 20), children with Down’s syndrome (n = 14, who 
were comparable with the ASD children in terms of chrono-
logical and mental age), and normally developing children 
(n = 27) with an ingenious experimental paradigm named 
the Sally and Anne test. Briefly, during this test, children 
are presented with two doll protagonists, Sally and Anne. 
Sally has a marble, which she places in her basket. After 
she has left the scene, Anne secretly takes the marble and 
puts it in her own basket. Then Sally returns and the experi-
menter asks the critical question: “Where will Sally look 
for her marble?” Children who point at the previous loca-
tion, appreciate that Sally has a ‘false’ belief about the situ-
ation and thus are able to employ a ‘theory of mind’. In the 
Baron-Cohen et al. (1985) study, it was found that whereas 
respectively 85% and 86% of the normally-developing and 
Down’s syndrome children successfully passed the test, only 
20% of the children with ASD did so, which indicates that 
the vast majority of them did not show evidence of a ‘theory 
of mind’. The researchers concluded that children with ASD 
display a specific cognitive deficit that may account for the 
prototypical social impairments associated with this type of 
psychopathology. Further studies relying on other method-
ology have replicated that children with ASD exhibit clear 
deficits in the mentalizing aspect of ‘theory of mind’ (e.g., 
White et al. 2009a, b).

With regard to emotion recognition, there is also clear 
evidence that children with ASD have difficulties to infer 
emotions  from  other  people’s  facial,  postural,  or  vocal 

1 3302

expressions. Most studies have been conducted on the rec-
ognition of facial emotions. Although the results of this 
research are not univocal, a meta-analysis by Uljarevic and 
Hamilton (2013) indicated that individuals with ASD (this 
meta-analysis included child as well as adult populations) 
performed less well than control groups without ASD in 
correctly identifying the six standard basic emotions of hap-
piness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise. Although 
the effect sizes documented in this meta-analysis were quite 
heterogeneous across studies, the results indicated that there 
was no moderation effect of age, which confirms the notion 
that young people with ASD—just like their adult coun-
terparts—have difficulties with recognizing the emotional 
expressions of other people (e.g., Fridenson-Hayo et al. 
2016).

Few studies have been conducted with respect to the 
social knowledge of children with ASD. However, there is 
anecdotical evidence suggesting that very basic social rules 
such as “People act differently in public than they do in pri-
vate” and “Know when you’re turning people off” are not 
obvious for persons with ASD (Grandin and Barron 2005). 
Further, an interesting study was conducted by Shulman 
et al. (2012) who presented children with ASD aged between 
8 and 17 years (n = 18) and age- and IQ-matched typically 
developing children (n = 18) with a set of pictures depicting 
transgressions at school, of which some were socially inap-
propriate (e.g., sitting and eating on the floor) and others 
were morally condemnable (e.g., stealing from another stu-
dent’s backpack). All children were asked to judge the appro-
priateness of various behaviors and to provide an explanation 
for their judgments. It was found that both groups of children 
were able to accurately describe and identify the unaccep-
table actions shown in the pictures. Typically developing 
children provided significantly more abstract rules for their 
judgments, whereas children with ASD more often gave 
non-specific condemnations (e.g., “You can’t do that!”) or an 
answer from an authority perspective (e.g., “The teacher will 
be really angry”). Further, the typically developing children 
were better in providing examples of situations in which the 
depicted behaviors would be acceptable, indicating that they 
were more flexible in applying social and moral rules than 
the children with ASD. Thus, although children with ASD 
appear to have some basic knowledge about the appropriate-
ness of social behaviors, they tend to rely more on a fixed 
set of concrete rules, which will make them less sensitive to 
respond adequately to subtle signals defining the uniqueness 
of each social situation.

The final domain of social cognition that also appears 
to be impaired in ASD is concerned with children’s attri-
butional style. Attributional style refers to the way that 
people interpret the course of a social event. To investi-
gate this phenomenon in ASD, Klin (2000) employed the 
Social Attribution Task, an experimental paradigm that is 

based on a silent cartoon animation in which geometric 
shapes (i.e., a big triangle, a small triangle, and a small 
circle) enact a social play. Adolescents and adults with 
ASD (n = 40, including 20 participants with autistic dis-
order and 20 participants with Asperger’s syndrome) and 
normally developing adolescents and adults (n = 20) were 
shown the animation and asked to provide narratives about 
the social meaning of what was happening in the cartoon. 
The results indicated that the ASD group showed marked 
deficits across all aspects of social attribution as compared 
to the normally developing control group. More specifi-
cally, individuals with ASD identified less social elements 
in the cartoon animation, very infrequently made theory 
of mind-related attributions, more often included elements 
in their narratives that were irrelevant to the social plot, 
and were less able to ascribe personality features to the 
geometric shapes. The noted impairments in children with 
ASD were not related to verbal intelligence or level of 
linguistic skills and seemed to reflect “a clear sense of 
the impoverished social attribution abilities in this clinical 
sample” (p. 840).

In contrast to the wealth of empirical data on social cog-
nition in ASD, research addressing mentalizing, emotion 
recognition, social knowledge, and attributional style in 
children with SAD is more sparse, while investigation of 
this topic is non-existent for children with SM. For children 
with SAD, a few studies have found evidence for the pres-
ence of deficits and impairments in theory of mind abili-
ties (Banerjee and Henderson 2001; Colonnesi et al. 2017). 
For example, Banerjee and Henderson (2001) conducted an 
investigation in 63 8- to 11-year-old primary school children 
for whom they assessed levels of social anxiety and various 
social-cognitive abilities, including a standard false belief 
test (Baron-Cohen et al. 1985) and two—from a cognitive 
point-of-view—more complex tasks in which children were 
asked (a) to interpret a situation in which one person unin-
tentionally commits a ‘faux pas’ (i.e., an embarrassing or 
tactless act or remark in a social situation) which upsets 
another individual (Baron-Cohen et al. 1999), and (b) to 
provide an explanation for deceptive self-representational 
displays used by story characters (e.g., pretending that one 
is not upset after getting hurt in a game with older children; 
Banerjee and Yuill 1999). It was found that children’s social 
anxiety levels were not significantly correlated with perfor-
mance on the false belief task, indicating that social anxiety 
was not associated directly with any basic cognitive deficit in 
understanding other people’s mental states. However, statis-
tically significant negative correlations were found between 
children’s social anxiety levels and their performance on the 
‘faux pas’ and ‘deceptive self-representation’ tasks, which 
points out that high socially anxious children did experience 
at least some difficulties in understanding the complicated 
links between emotions, intentions, and beliefs.

Meanwhile, there are also indications that there are chil-
dren with SAD who do not have poor theory of mind skills 
but rather show advanced capacity to impute mental states 
to oneself and others. Evidence for this idea comes from a 
recent study by Nikolic et al. (2019) who investigated the 
relation between social anxiety and children’s theory of mind 
ability in more detail. One-hundred-and-five children aged 8 
to 12 years were assessed for social anxiety and mindreading 
using the ‘Reading the Mind in the Eyes’ test (Baron-Cohen 
et al. 2001a, b), which measures the accuracy of detect-
ing mental states from the eye region of human faces. The 
results showed that while the average linear relation between 
social anxiety and mindreading was indeed negative, a cur-
vilinear relation provided an even better fit. A close inspec-
tion of this relation revealed that high social anxiety was 
not only associated with poor mindreading skills but also 
related to advanced mindreading capacity. On the one end, 
there appears to be a group of children who show clear defi-
cits in recognizing other people’s mental states. As a result, 
they have poor comprehension of what is exactly happening 
during social interactions, leading to confusion and unpre-
dictability, which is the main source for their social fears 
and concerns. On the other end, there are also children who 
dispose of an advanced capacity to understand other people’s 
states of mind, which essentially is a positive thing (as it pro-
motes successful social interactions) but may also come at a 
cost: these children can be extremely sensitive to other peo-
ple’s opinions about them and have great awareness of the 
fact that they are subject to others’ attention and evaluation. 
This could result in heightened self-consciousness and fear 
of negative evaluation, which fuel feelings of social anxiety.
Several studies have explored whether there are impair-
ments in emotion recognition in children with SAD; how-
ever, the results have been mixed. In one of the first investi-
gations by Simonian et al. (2001), 15 children aged between 
9 and 15 years who had a diagnosis of SAD and 14 age-
matched control children were asked to identify the emo-
tional expression depicted in a series of pictures of human 
faces. The results showed that children with SAD made more 
errors in correctly identifying the facial expressions of hap-
piness, sadness, and disgust than the children in the control 
group. In another study, Wong et al. (2012) compared facial 
emotion recognition abilities across 7- to 13-year-old chil-
dren with SAD, high-functioning ASD, or a typical devel-
opment. It was found that children with high-functioning 
ASD were less capable of correctly identifying mild (but 
not extreme) affective facial expressions than the typically 
developing children, but the children with SAD scored in 
between and were not statistically different from the other 
two groups. There were clear methodological differences 
between the two studies, such as the use of different picture 
sets and variations in the intensity and presentation times 
of the facial expressions, meaning that the experimental 

boundaries for emotion recognition deficits in young people 
with SAD require further investigation.

No  research  can  be  found  examining  impairments  in 
social knowledge of children with SAD and the same is true 
for deficits in the general attributional style of young people 
with this type of psychopathology. However, there is a sub-
stantial amount of studies showing that children with SAD 
or elevated symptoms of social anxiety display interpreta-
tion biases, which refers to the tendency to make a range of 
rather specific negative interpretations regarding themselves 
and other people when facing social situations. For example, 
Muris et al. (2000) examined such dysfunctional thinking 
in a sample of 252 primary school children of whom 28 
were classified with SAD using a structured clinical inter-
view. All children were exposed to a series of open-ended, 
ambiguous stories of social situations and for each of the 
stories they were instructed (a) to find out as quickly as pos-
sible whether that story reflected threat, (b) to tell how the 
story would end, and (c) to judge how they would feel when 
they would actually be confronted with that situation. The 
results showed that socially anxious children displayed lower 
thresholds for threat perception than control children, which 
means that they needed to hear fewer sentences of a story 
before deciding that it reflected threatening content. Further, 
socially anxious children more often thought that the stories 
would have a negative ending and also reported that they 
would have higher levels of negative feelings and thoughts 
in such situations, which points out that they had a tendency 
to interpret the ambiguous vignettes in a threatening way. 
A recent meta-analysis of all the research on the negative 
interpretation of ambiguity in young people with anxiety 
problems (Stuijfzand et al. 2018) indicated that the effect 
size of this so-called interpretation bias was largest for SAD 
as compared to all other anxiety disorders. Finally, there is 
recent evidence that children with ASD who also exhibit 
high fear and anxiety levels in social situations display simi-
lar threat-related interpretation biases, which suggests that 
social anxiety is the driving force behind this type of cogni-
tive distortion (Neil et al. 2019).

In conclusion, there is convincing evidence that children 
with ASD show marked deficits in all domains of social 
cognition: compared to typically developing children, they 
perform more poorly on tasks requiring them to attribute 
mental states such as emotions, beliefs, and desires to other 
people (mentalizing) or recognize the emotional states of 
other persons (emotion recognition), tend to be less aware 
of rules and norms applying to various social settings (social 
knowledge), and have difficulties with correctly explaining 
the course of social events (attributional style). In children 
with SAD, the impairments in social cognition are in general 
less marked as compared to those noted for children with 
ASD; only in the domain of attributional style, children with 
SAD have been shown to clearly display a negative bias in 

1 3304 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021) 24:294–325

the interpretation of (ambiguous) social situations. There is 
virtually no research with regard to the social cognition abil-
ities of children with SM, which hence remains an important 
area of future inquiry.

Social Skills

Social skills refer to a person’s competences facilitating the 
interaction and communication with other people, both ver-
bally and non-verbally through gestures, body language, and 
personal appearance (Little et al. 2017). Given the diagnostic 
criteria for ASD, it will come as no surprise that children 
with this disorder tend to display poor social skills. Evidence 
for this notion comes from questionnaire-based studies in 
which parents and teachers evaluate the social abilities of 
children with ASD. This research has generally shown that 
children with ASD display lower levels of appropriate skills 
(e.g., smiling at other people, helping a person who is hurt, 
doing nice things for others) and higher levels of inappropri-
ate skills (e.g., getting upset when having to wait, hurting 
other people’s feelings, interrupting others while speaking) 
as compared to typically developing children (Beighley and 
Matson 2014). Observational studies have also shown spe-
cific deficits in the social interaction and communication 
skills of children with ASD. For example, Macintosh and 
Dissanayake (2006) used a time sampling method to reg-
ister and code the social behaviors of 39 high-functioning 
children with ASD aged 4 to 10 years and 17 age-matched 
typically  developing  children  who  were  playing  in  the 
schoolyard. Although it was noted that children with ASD 
were capable of engaging socially with other children, the 
observations demonstrated that their social behavior devi-
ated  significantly  from  that  of  the  typically  developing 
children. For example, children with ASD were more often 
solitary, participated less in social play, communicated less 
with other children, and engaged less in enduring, recipro-
cal interactions with others (see also Murdock et al. 2007).
The social skills deficits of children with ASD may have 
serious consequences for the development of relationships 
with  peers.  An  exemplary  study  on  this  topic  was  con-
ducted by Kasari et al. (2011) who explored self-, peer-, and 
teacher-reports of social relationships in 60 high-functioning 
children with ASD in the primary school age (6 to 11 years) 
and 60 typically developing control children by means of 
questionnaires and a social network analysis. The results 
showed that children with ASD had fewer reciprocal friend-
ships: only a minority of these children (18%) nominated a 
child as best friend, which was then confirmed by that peer. 
In typically developing children, this percentage of recipro-
cal friendships was significantly higher (64%). Further, it 
was found that the friendship quality of children with ASD 
was also lower than that of typically developing children: 
they spent less time with friends and were less open to share 

feelings. Finally, the network analysis revealed that children 
with ASD were more often isolated (13% versus 0%) or in 
the periphery of their classroom (42% versus 10%) than the 
typically developing children who were more frequently 
well-connected to their classmates (37% versus 58%) or 
even popular and central figures in their class (8% versus 
32%). There are indications that the lack of social connec-
tion of children with ASD is not a transient phenomenon as 
their relationships with peers and other people often remain 
poor in terms of quantity and quality during adolescence and 
adulthood as well (Orsmond et al. 2004).

Another negative correlate of poor social skills is that 
children with ASD are prone to become involved in bullying 
experiences. Although some children with ASD are bullies 
themselves (e.g., Van Roekel et al. 2010), most become the 
victims of this type of negative social behavior (Schroeder 
et al. 2014). Because they tend to behave in socially awk-
ward ways, they often attract the attention of peers some of 
whom approach them in a negative way. Given the poorly 
developed coping skills, their limited social network and 
friendships, and the tendency to display strong emotional 
reactions (e.g., visible anger, anxiety, or sadness) of children 
with ASD, perpetrators are not stopped but rather encour-
aged to commit their condemnable acts of physical aggres-
sion, verbal aggression, social exclusion, and cyberbullying. 
Studies that examined the occurrence of being a victim of 
bullying in children with ASD found rates of up to 94%, 
depending  on  the  definition  (e.g.,  verbal  teasing  versus 
physical aggression), time frame (e.g., past week versus past 
year), and the informant reporting on the experiences (e.g., 
teacher versus child). Most importantly, however, research 
including a typically developing control group has revealed 
that children with ASD are significantly more likely a target 
of bullying (Wainscot et al. 2008).

Thus, it is clear that the social skills of children with ASD 
are poorly developed and associated with various negative 
sequelae, but what do social skill deficits look like in chil-
dren with SM and SAD? Studies examining social skills 
deficits in children with SAD have yielded quite mixed find-
ings (Levitan and Nardi 2009). For example, in the inves-
tigation by Spence et al. (1999) who compared 27 clini-
cally diagnosed children with SAD aged 7 to 14 years and 
a matched nonclinical control group, various measures of 
social skills and competences were used including self-, 
parent-, and teacher-reported questionnaires as well as a 
number of behavioral assessments (e.g., role plays with 
another child, a reading aloud task, and a natural observa-
tion of children’s interaction with peers). The results showed 
that the children with SAD not only had lower social skills 
scores on various questionnaires as compared to the control 
children, but also actually demonstrated these social skills 
deficits during some of the behavioral tasks. That is, the 
children with SAD responded with fewer words during the 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021) 24:294–325 

305

role plays and initiated less interactions with their peers at 
school. On the reading task, however, they performed just as 
well as the nonclinical control children. In another study by 
Cartwright-Hatton et al. (2005), non-clinical 10/11-year-old 
children with and without high social anxiety (n = 20 in both 
groups) were prompted to have a three-minute conversation 
with an unfamiliar adult. Afterwards their videotaped social 
skills were rated by themselves and by independent observ-
ers. It was found that the independent observers were unable 
to distinguish between the high and low socially anxious 
children. However, the high socially anxious children rated 
themselves as appearing less skilled than their low socially 
anxious counterparts. These results led Cartwright-Hatton 
et al. (2005) to conclude that children with SAD do not 
necessarily display social skills deficits, but rather tend to 
believe they perform less well in social situations, signify-
ing the presence of a cognitive distortion. It is possible that 
the inconsistent results are due to the fact that SAD is not 
a homogeneous psychiatric condition, but rather consists 
of various subtypes (i.e., a subtype with clear social skills 
deficits and a subtype which has acquired adequate social 
skills but is dominated by negative cognition). Meanwhile, 
it should also be noted that the research conducted so far 
has relied on different methods to assess social skills defi-
cits in specific circumstances. In their review of this topic 
(including research of both child and adult samples), Levi-
tan and Nardi (2009) are in favor of the latter explanation 
when they conclude that “In general, the results indicate that 
socially anxious people perform more poorly in spontaneous 
social interactions than control participants, are classified by 
observers as less assertive, less friendly, and shy, but present 
only discrete differences in structured situations” (p. 702).

Only one study explored the social skills of children with 
SM (Cunningham et al. 2006). In that study, 58 children with 
SM on average 7 years of age and 52 community control 
children without psychiatric problems were compared on 
a number of socio-emotional variables, among which par-
ent- and teacher-ratings of social skills and children’s self-
reported social competence. Although children with SM per-
ceived themselves as equally competent in social situations 
as control children, parents and teachers rated these children 
as less socially skilled and this was not only the case in situ-
ations that required speaking but also in situations in which 
they did not have to speak. Parents, for example, evaluated 
the children with SM as less confident in social situations, 
having more difficulties to make friends, and less likely to 
join groups. On the basis of these findings, Cunningham 
et al. (2006) concluded that SM is associated with compa-
rable social skills deficits as are observed in some children 
with SAD.

Do the social skills deficits in children with SM and 
SAD also have repercussions for their daily social func-
tioning?  Most  research  has  again  been  conducted  on 

children with SAD and in general the results have shown 
that children with this anxiety disorder have more prob-
lems in establishing friendships, are in general less popu-
lar, and are also more frequently a target of victimization 
by their peers. For example, in a study by Scharfstein et al. 
(2011a, b), the interpersonal functioning among children 
with  SAD,  children  with  generalized  anxiety  disorder, 
and non-anxious control children (aged 6 to 13 years) was 
compared. It was found that children with SAD clearly 
had the lowest number of friends and experienced more 
difficulty in making friends than children with general-
ized anxiety disorder and non-anxious control children. 
In a further investigation by Baker and Hudson (2015), 
39 children with SAD, 28 children with other anxiety dis-
orders, and 29 nonclinical children first identified their 
closest friend and described some general features of this 
friendship (i.e., duration, frequency of contact). Follow-
ing this, the children and their best friends evaluated the 
friendship quality by means of a standardized question-
naire. The results showed that while friendships did not 
differ in terms of general features across the three groups, 
children with SAD had significantly lower friendship qual-
ity as reported by themselves and by their best friend as 
compared to the children with other anxiety disorders. In 
another study, Gazelle et al. (2010) examined the symptom 
and diagnostic profiles of solitary children who had been 
identified by their peers in school (n = 192, with an average 
age of 8 years). Compared to an age- and demographically-
matched control group, the solitary children were more 
often diagnosed with SM and SAD than children in the 
control group, which suggests that children with both diag-
noses at a relatively young age run greater risk to become 
socially isolated.

With regard to peer victimization, there is clear evidence 
for a relation between SAD and falling victim to other chil-
dren’s verbally and physically aggressive and socially exclu-
sive acts. While the majority of the research has demon-
strated that peer victimization experiences increase the risk 
for developing SAD and thus appear to play a causal role in 
this type of psychopathology (Pontillo et al. 2019), there is 
also support for a reverse scenario in which SAD acts as an 
antecedent of being bullied by peers (e.g., Hodges and Perry 
1999; Pickard et al. 2018). In his well-known monograph 
on childhood bullying, Olweus (1993) also noted that the 
presence of SAD-related characteristics such as shyness and 
anxiety and the concomitant lack of social skills make chil-
dren prone to become victim of bullying. For children with 
SM, only one study explicitly addressed this topic (Cunning-
ham et al. 2004) and the results showed that these children 
had more problems in building friendships with peers but 
were not more frequently victimized by other children as 
compared to the control group. It should be noted, however, 
that the children in this study were still quite young (with an 

1 3306 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021) 24:294–325

average age of 7 years) and so we don’t know to what extent 
bullying and victimization become more prominent in young 
people with SM during later development.

Altogether, children with ASD appear to display clear 
deficits in their social skills, which hinder them to success-
fully engage in social interactions, and may have serious 
consequences for establishing long-lasting friendships and 
also make them a target for peer victimization. There is evi-
dence suggesting that the poor social skills of children with 
ASD are (at least partially) grounded in the social cognition 
deficits that have been described in the previous section. 
For example, in their cross-sectional study of 108 individu-
als with high-functioning ASD aged between 9 and 27 year, 
Bishop-Fitzpatrick et al. (2017) showed that after controlling 
for age and intelligence level, better social cognition abilities 
were significantly associated with higher levels of socially 
adaptive behavior and lower levels of social problems. Fur-
ther, children with SM and SAD also exhibit shortcomings 
in their social skills, although one might expect that these 
deficits are more modest than in children with ASD. How-
ever, studies directly comparing the social skills of ASD 
and SAD/SM children are rare. One exception is the inves-
tigation by Scharfstein et al. (2011a, b) who conducted a 
detailed analysis of social behavior during structured role 
play interactions in 30 children with Asperger’s disorder, 
30 children with SAD, and 30 typically developing children, 
all aged between 7 and 13 years. It was found that children 
with Asperger’s disorder performed equally well as typi-
cally developing children, and that only children with SAD 
exhibited significantly lower levels of social skills. However, 
an analysis of the vocal characteristics revealed that children 
with Asperger’s disorder deviated from typically developing 
children and children with SAD because they displayed a 
distinct pattern of speech: that is, they spoke more softly 
and had a lower vocal pitch and less vocal pitch variability, 
which can be subjectively heard as monotonic talking. The 
study by Scharfstein et al. (2011a, b) seems to warrant the 
conclusion that although there are only subtle differences in 
the socially interactive behaviors of children with ASD and 
SAD, as the two groups did not dramatically differ in terms 
of social skills. However, it should be noted that this study 
included ASD children with a fairly high level of intelligence 
(mean IQ = 114), and there are indications that cognitively 
high-functioning children with ASD are capable of compen-
sation and display good skills in social situations (Livingston 
et al. 2019). Moreover, in the Scharfstein et al. (2011a, b) 
study, social skills were assessed during a series of struc-
tured role plays, and so it remains to be seen whether similar 
results would be obtained for children with ASD who face 
real-life social situations. Thus, more research comparing 
the social skills (deficits) between children with ASD and 
children with SAD and in particular children with SM is 
certainly needed.

Social Motivation

Social cognition and social skills to a large extent determine 
to what extent children are capable of engaging in interac-
tions with other people. Social motivation is another aspect 
of social functioning that refers to the need and willing-
ness to interact with others and to be accepted by them. It 
is generally assumed that human beings in general have a 
natural need to belong with others and to relate with them 
(Baumeister and Leary 1995), but there are also clear indi-
vidual differences with regard to this need that may be medi-
ated by certain types of psychopathology. SAD is thought 
to be not really associated with deficits in social motivation, 
which can be derived from the fact that socially anxious 
people seek treatment because they feel unhappy about their 
relationships with other people. Although direct evidence for 
the social motivation tendencies of individuals with SAD is 
sparse, there is an interesting recent study by Goodman et al. 
(2019) who assessed the personal strivings in 41 adult indi-
viduals with this anxiety disorder and 43 healthy controls. 
Among the list of personal strivings types, four were of a 
social nature, namely ‘affiliation’ (i.e., concern for or desire 
to establish, maintain, or repair friendships), ‘interpersonal’ 
(i.e., an objective or goal focused on others), ‘intimacy’ (i.e., 
commitment and concern for others, quality of relationships 
rather than quantity), and ‘self-presentation’ (i.e., making a 
favorable impression on others). Although the individuals 
with SAD reported greater difficulty in pursuing their striv-
ings, the content and frequency of these personal goals were 
similar to those noted for the healthy controls. Of course, it 
needs to be explored whether these findings also apply to 
children and adolescents, but at least they suggest that the 
social motivation of adults with SAD is intact.

The latter is also supported by the fact that SAD is accom-
panied by a number of clinical correlates that strongly sug-
gest there is a discrepancy between the social motivation and 
the social accomplishments of a child. Feelings of loneliness 
are a case in point. This unpleasant feeling that occurs as a 
result of a lack of connection and communication with other 
individuals is quite prevalent in young people with SAD. 
For instance, Maes et al. (2019) conducted a meta-analysis 
on the relationship between social anxiety and loneliness 
in childhood, using the data of 102 cross-sectional studies 
and 10 longitudinal investigations. The results indicated that 
there was a substantial positive association between social 
anxiety symptoms and feelings of loneliness (average effect 
size: r = 0.46), and this link did not vary in strength between 
children and adolescents. Further, the analysis of the longi-
tudinal studies included in the meta-analysis revealed that 
there were reciprocal associations between social anxiety 
and loneliness over time, indicating that social anxiety pre-
dicted subsequent feelings of loneliness and that feelings 
of loneliness in turn predicted subsequent levels of social 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021) 24:294–325 

307

anxiety. In a similar vein, it has been shown that children 
with SAD are also more prone to develop depression. An 
example is the well-cited study by Stein et al. (2001) who 
prospectively  investigated  the  prevalence  of  SAD  and 
depression in a sample of 2548 adolescents and young adults 
aged 14 to 24 years. It was found that SAD at baseline was 
associated with an increased likelihood (odds ratio = 3.5) 
of depressive disorder onset during the follow-up period of 
3 to 4 years. Thus, research has demonstrated that SAD in 
young people is associated with higher levels of loneliness 
and depression (see also Danneel et al. 2019).

For  SM,  only  indirect,  anecdotal  information  can  be 
found regarding social motivation. For example, Walker 
and Tobbell (2015) conducted detailed online interviews 
with four adults who had been diagnosed with SM during 
their childhood years. The general themes in the accounts 
of their subjective experiences with the disorder reflected 
“loneliness” and “loss”. That is, the adults indicated that the 
SM had isolated them from other people and this had seri-
ously hindered them in academia, work, and personal life. 
The dissatisfaction and negative affect associated with these 
experiences indicate that they had wanted a different social 
life and suggests that they were socially motivated (see also 
Omdal 2007). Further, there is some evidence showing that 
depression is a frequent comorbid disorder in young people 
with SM. Illustrative is a study by Gensthaler et al. (2016b) 
who compared the comorbidity patterns in young partici-
pants with SM (n = 95) or SAD (n = 74), all aged between 3 
and 18 years. It was found that major depression was present 
in 12% of the participants with SM (as compared to 26% in 
those with SAD), and that this diagnosis was always made 
during the adolescent years (i.e., between 12 and 18 years). 
Of course, depression can arise from a wide range of etio-
logical factors, but there are clear indications that in young 
people social isolation and peer problems are important 
determinants of this disorder (Hammen 2009).

Because children with ASD engage in less eye contact, 
are less sensitive to the feelings and thoughts of others, and 
often withdraw from social situations, one might conclude 
that they have “a powerful desire for aloneness” as suggested 
early on by Kanner (1943, p. 249). The apparent lack of 
social interest has prompted some scholars to argue that 
ASD can best be regarded as “an extreme case of dimin-
ished social motivation” (Chevallier et al. 2012, p. 231). 
Experimental researchers have tried to underpin this point 
of view by demonstrating that individuals with ASD display 
deficits in the processing of social rewards. For example, 
Scott-Van Zeeland et al. (2010) used a reward learning task 
presented on the computer during which 16 high-functioning 
boys with ASD (average age = 12 years) and 16 typically 
developing boys had to classify abstract fractal-like images 
into two groups. Following the classification of each of the 
images, children received feedback on their performance in 

three ways. The neutral feedback merely consisted of the 
words  “Correct”  or  “Incorrect”  shown  on  the  computer 
screen after children had given their response, the monetary 
feedback consisted of the presentation of a picture of three 
gold coins with the word “Correct” or a picture of three 
red X’s through the gold coins with the word “Incorrect”, 
while the social feedback consisted of a picture of a smiling 
woman with the words “That’s right” or a woman with a sad 
face with the words “That’s wrong”. Pictures and feedback 
combinations were presented to the children in two experi-
mental runs of 72 trials each: one run involved the contrast 
of monetary reward versus neutral feedback, whereas the 
other run pertained to the contrast of social reward versus 
neutral feedback. During the learning task, scans were made 
of children’s brain activity using functional magnetic reso-
nance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural circuitry 
underlying reward learning. The results showed that the typi-
cally developing children displayed a significant improve-
ment in their classification accuracy over the course of the 
experiment, and this occurred independent of the way that 
the feedback (neutral versus social or monetary reward) had 
been given. Children with ASD continued to perform on a 
chance level throughout both runs of the experiment. This 
indicates that while typically developing children show clear 
signs of learning following feedback, this process appears 
to be impaired in children with ASD. Even more interest-
ingly, when looking at the neural responses to rewards, it 
was found that children with ASD exhibited diminished 
neural responses in the ventral striatum (a part of the brain 
situated in the subcortical basal ganglia of the forebrain, 
known to play a prominent role in reward processing) to 
both monetary and social rewards, with a more pronounced 
reduction being noted in response to social rewards. This 
appears to indicate that children with ASD are less sensitive 
to feedback—in particular of a social nature, and could help 
explain why they are less interested to engage in relation-
ships with other people, which is the key tenet of the social 
motivation theory (Chevallier et al. 2012).

Meanwhile, it should be noted that the social motivation 
theory has been seriously challenged for several reasons. 
To begin with, a recently conducted meta-analytic review 
(Clements et al. 2018) has revealed that the hypoactivation 
in certain brain areas is less specific than suggested by the 
results obtained in the Scott-Van Zeeland et al. (2010) study. 
More precisely, the atypical processing noted in ASD was 
not shown to be stronger in response to social rewards than 
to non-social rewards, which implies that evidence obtained 
by this type of research is not entirely supportive for motiva-
tion in the social domain but is in need for a more general 
explanation. Moreover, Jaswal and Akhtar (2019) recently 
argued  that  it  is  questionable  to  assume  on  the  basis  of 
behavioral characteristics and even aberrant brain processing 
patterns that children with ASD are less socially motivated. 

1 3308

They referred to testimonies of children and adults with ASD 
from which it can be inferred that individuals with this type 
of psychopathology do want to connect and interact with 
other people, but do so in an unconventional or idiosyncratic 
way. This notion is supported by findings indicating that (a) 
children with ASD tend to report that they feel lonely, and 
that (b) a substantial proportion of them develop depres-
sion. With respect to the former, a study by Bauminger et al. 
(2003) investigated the level of social interaction with peers 
and feelings of loneliness in 18 high-functioning children 
with ASD (aged 8 to 17 years) and 17 age- and IQ-matched 
control children. Observations in natural settings revealed 
that the children with ASD spent only half of the time in 
social interactions with peers as compared to the control 
children. Further, children with ASD reported significantly 
higher levels of loneliness than the control children, and 
these feelings not only pertained to the low frequency of 
social involvement with others (i.e., social loneliness) but 
also to the negative affect associated with the lack of social 
contact (i.e., emotional loneliness). Finally, in both children 
with ASD and typically developing children, negative asso-
ciations were found between social competence and lone-
liness, which indicates that success in social interactions 
decreases the likelihood of this negative affective reaction 
(see also Bauminger and Kasari 2000; Deckers et al. 2017; 
White and Roberson-Nay 2009). Concerning the occurrence 
of depression in ASD, it has been noted that 7.7% of the chil-
dren with this neurodevelopmental disorder come to suffer 
from a depressive disorder before the age of 19 and this rate 
is about 4 times greater than that documented in the gen-
eral population (Hudson et al. 2019). Similar to the devel-
opmental patterns found in non-ASD youth, the likelihood 
for developing depression in young people with ASD seems 
to increase in adolescence (Pezzimenti et al. 2019) and it is 
highly plausible that the prototypical social impairments and 
associated social problems are among the factors that under-
lie this increased risk (Magnuson and Constantino 2011).

In conclusion, young people with SM, SAD, and ASD all 
display behaviors that could be viewed in terms of a lack of 
social interest and motivation. However, in children with SM 
and SAD it is likely that these behaviors are fueled by fear 
and anxiety which result in persistent avoidance of (some) 
social situations. In children with SM who are often less 
communicative about their fears and anxieties, this may be 
less obvious leading to questions about their social motiva-
tion. In children with ASD, it is clear that deficits in infor-
mation processing undermine their sensitivity and respon-
sivity to social cues, and as a result these children are less 
likely to orient toward, seek out and enjoy, and attempt to 
maintain relations to other people (Chevallier et al. 2012). 
Meanwhile, Jaswal and Akhtar (2019) noted that despite 
this reduced quantity of social interest, children with ASD 
do engage in interactions with other people although they 

might do this in a different manner. If these attempts are not 
met in a satisfactory way, they may respond with negative 
affect, showing signs of loneliness and depression just like 
their typically developing peers. There is evidence that this 
is particularly true for high-functioning children with ASD 
who are to some extent capable of interacting with peers but 
due to their social peculiarities are less successful in initiat-
ing and maintaining social relationships (e.g., Pezzimenti 
et al. 2019).

To recap, there appear to be considerable impairments 
in the social functioning of children with SM, SAD, and 
ASD, although differences in the extent to which various 
domains are affected have also been noted. Our review has 
demonstrated that most research has focused on the social 
difficulties in children with SAD and ASD. Far less stud-
ies have been conducted on SM, but it plausible to assume 
that—given its relations to SAD and ASD—children with 
this psychiatric condition also display comparable problems 
in social functioning. Obviously, this is an important topic 
of future investigation as more knowledge of social emotion, 
social cognition, social skills, and social motivation would 
increase our understanding of SM and could—as we will see 
later—yield important leads for treatment.

RRBIs and the Severity of Social Problems

As noted earlier, RRBIs are an integral, core component 
of ASD and these features are positively related to sever-
ity of the social problems in individuals suffering from this 
neurodevelopmental disorder. That is, a stronger presence 
of RRBIs is typically associated with greater inflexibility 
and rigidity that may have a direct negative impact on the 
social behavior and also hinder the emergence of adequate 
emotion regulation strategies in response to social situations 
(Lam et al. 2008).

A case in point is insistence on sameness, which is con-
sidered as an important domain of RRBIs (Leekam et al. 
2011). Insistence on sameness refers to an overreliance on 
rigid, routinized, and ritualistic behaviors that likely leads 
to a reduced exposure to novel and/or challenging situations 
(Bishop et al. 2013). Note that the latter bears similarity to 
the avoidance behavior that is assumed to play a critical 
role in the maintenance of anxiety disorders such as SM 
and SAD. Indeed, there is evidence indicating that insist-
ence on sameness is significantly and positively associated 
with global anxiety scores in young people with ASD. For 
example, in a recent study by Lidstone et al. (2014), parents 
rated their 3- to 17-year-old offspring with ASD using the 
Repetitive Behavior Questionnaire (Leekam et al. 2007), 
which measures two main components of RRBIs: insistence 
on sameness and repetitive behaviors, and an anxiety scale 
for measuring DSM-defined anxiety disorder symptoms 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021) 24:294–325 

309

in  children  (Spence 1998).  The  results  showed  that  the 
insistence on sameness factor correlated significantly and 
positively with the total anxiety score, whereas the repeti-
tive behaviors factor did not. Comparable findings have 
been obtained in other studies (Factor et al. 2016; Gotham 
et al. 2013; Russell et al. 2019; Uljarevic and Evans 2017; 
Uljarevic et al. 2017b). Although insistence on sameness has 
been shown to be positively associated with global anxiety, 
two other studies have found that this type of RRBIs is less 
convincingly linked to social anxiety in children with ASD 
(Black et al. 2017; Rodgers et al. 2012). This of course sug-
gests that this construct is less relevant for understanding 
SM and SAD as comorbid conditions in this population. 
It should be borne in mind, however, that in these studies 
social anxiety was assessed by means of a parent-rating scale 
which may be less suitable for assessing the atypical/idi-
osyncratic manifestations of this anxiety problem in children 
with ASD. In addition, oftentimes, parents note that their 
offspring with ASD have social problems but do not label 
this as social anxiety as these children are typically less com-
municative about their symptoms.

There is also a considerable amount of research indicating 
that the relation between insistence on sameness and anxi-
ety is mediated by the dispositional trait of intolerance of 
uncertainty (e.g., Glod et al. 2019; Hwang et al. 2020; Joyce 
et al. 2017; Wigham et al. 2015), which can be defined as 
the tendency to react negatively to situations and events that 
are unforeseen and unpredictable (Buhr and Dugas 2006). 
This concept has its origin in the anxiety literature and is 
strongly associated with clinically significant anxiety prob-
lems including SAD. It is suggested that individuals scoring 
high on intolerance of uncertainty have a tendency to inter-
pret ambiguous information as threatening and as a result 
have a stronger inclination to avoid all kinds of situations 
(Carleton 2012). Interestingly, children with ASD score sig-
nificantly higher on intolerance of uncertainty than typically 
developing children (Boulter et al. 2014; Vasa et al. 2018). 
This is one reason why this factor has been put forward as 
an important cognitive mechanism behind the anxiety symp-
toms and in its wake pathological demand avoidance (i.e., 
the obsessional avoidance of the demands of everyday life; 
Newson et al. 2003) of children with this neurodevelopmen-
tal disorder (Maisel et al. 2016; Stuart et al. 2020).

The insistence on sameness that can be noted in children 
with ASD may directly fuel avoidance as well as elicit other 
challenging behaviors such as edginess and irritability, as 
a result of which the social communication is further com-
plicated (Bitsika and Sharpley 2016). But also on a cogni-
tive level these children are often characterized by rigid-
ity, accounting for the fact that they often display a greater 
proneness to worry (e.g., Gillott et al. 2001; White et al. 
2014a, b) and rumination (e.g., Mazefsky et al. 2013, 2014). 
Burrows et al. (2017) have described a neuropsychological 

model in which three putative brain networks are put for-
ward to explain why children with ASD are so susceptible 
to high levels of negative thinking: (1) a salience detection 
network, involving the dorsal anterior insula, the dorsal ante-
rior cingulate cortex, and subcortical structures including the 
amygdala, which signals the (potential) presence of social 
threat and contributes to the coordination of the subsequent 
emotional and cognitive response, (2) an executive control 
network, consisting of nodes in the posterior parietal cortex 
and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which serves the regu-
lation of attentional processes, and (3) a default network, 
composed of cortical areas such as the medial prefrontal 
cortex, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior 
cingulate cortex, that subserves internally directed self-
referential thinking. The idea is that in ASD the salience 
detection network becomes (too) easily activated, which 
then due to attentional control deficits (executive control 
network) results in difficulties disengaging from threat, ulti-
mately causing prolonged self-referential processing in the 
default mode network, the outcome of which is high levels 
of repetitive thinking. Thus, the cognitive inflexibility that 
is so frequently observed in children with ASD is hypoth-
esized to be mediated by aberrant brain processes, and also 
provides a plausible explanation for why social problems (in 
this example: social emotion) might be more persistent in 
young people with this type of psychopathology (Burrows 
et al. 2017).

Sensory processing abnormalities are a special class of 
RRBIs that have less in common with the two main factors 
of repetitive behaviors and insistence on sameness (Uljarevic 
et al. 2017a). In fact, it has been suggested that the prototypi-
cal repetitive behaviors and resistance to change of children 
with ASD are often moderated by unusual sensory experi-
ences (e.g., Baker et al. 2008; Joosten et al., 2009). Most 
pertinent to the present article is the observation that sen-
sory processing abnormalities may also contribute to anxiety 
symptoms. For example, several studies have noted that in 
particular sensory hypersensitivity is positively associated 
with anxiety, stress, and other socially undesirable symp-
toms in young people with ASD (Mazurek et al. 2013; Neil 
et al. 2016; Uljarevic et al. 2016).

There is some evidence that sensory hypersensitivity is 
not only relevant for ASD but may also play a role in indi-
viduals with SM and SAD. Hofmann and Bitran (2007), for 
example, explored the relationship between sensory process-
ing sensitivity, as measured by the Highly Sensitive Person 
Scale (Aron and Aron 1997), and anxiety and avoidance in 
89 adult patients with SAD referred to an outpatient treat-
ment center. The results showed that sensory hypersensi-
tivity was not significantly correlated with social anxiety 
symptoms in general but did show a positive correlation with 
avoidance behavior, which may indicate that hypersensitivity 
is associated with greater interference in daily functioning 

1 3310 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021) 24:294–325

(Hofmann and Bitran 2007). For SM, direct empirical evi-
dence for a link with sensory hypersensitivity and symptom 
levels is lacking, but it has been reported that some children 
with this anxiety disorder do not speak because they report 
to experience that their “voice sounds funny” (Bar-Haim 
et al. 2004). It has been suggested that this may be partly due 
to aberrations in the auditory monitoring and regulation of 
self-vocalization (Muchnik et al. 2013), which might be a 
special case of highly sensitive sensory processing.

In conclusion, while the trinity of SM, SAD, and ASD 
have a lot in common with regard to the phenomenology 
of social difficulties and their underlying processes, chil-
dren with ASD appear to display a special set of symptoms, 
the RRBIs, of which insistence on sameness and sensory 
hypersensitivity are particularly important as they are likely 
to promote social anxiety or elicit other challenging behav-
iors that hinder social interaction. It should be kept in mind 
that in the current classification system of the DSM, ASD is 
conceived as a spectrum disorder (APA 2013). This implies 
that its prototypical symptoms to a greater or lesser extent 
are present in all children, including those that do not fulfill 
the diagnostic criteria of ASD and thus may have a normal 
development. Indeed, there is empirical evidence show-
ing that RRBIs do occur in typically developing children 
(although to a lesser degree than in children with ASD; 
Arnott et al. 2010; Barber et al. 2012; Joseph et al. 2013; 
Leekam et al. 2007). Thus, the adverse consequences of 
RRBIs such as insistence on sameness and sensory hyper-
sensitivity are not only relevant for children with ASD but 
may also have a negative impact on the social functioning of 
typically developing children and children with other psy-
chopathologies such as SM and SAD.

SM: More than Just an Anxiety Disorder?

In current classification systems such as the DSM (APA 
2013) and the ICD (WHO 2018), SM has been included in 
the category of anxiety disorders. This decision is justified 
since fear and anxiety appear to be primary features of the 
disorder. As we have noted in this review, many children 
with SM also have a comorbid anxiety disorder or, in the 
least, experience fear, anxiety, and fear-related cognitions 
in situations in which they are expected to speak. In par-
ticular, the relation with social anxiety appears to be quite 
robust: SAD is by far the most frequently diagnosed con-
current anxiety disorder in children with SM and the fear, 
anxiety, and fear-related cognitions of these youngsters are 
typically guided by social evaluative concerns. That is, they 
fear being exposed to possible scrutiny by others, just like 
children with SAD. Because of the intimate link between 
SM and SAD (Chavira et al. 2007), scholars have argued that 
SM might be a special variant of SAD (Bögels et al. 2010), 

with some of them viewing it as a developmental precursor 
of SAD (e.g., Bergman et al. 2002) and others consider-
ing it as an extreme manifestation of this anxiety disorder 
(e.g., Black and Uhde 1992). There seems to be support for 
both accounts. For example, the early age-of-onset noted 
for SM (APA 2013) in combination with the observation 
that full muteness usually disappears when children become 
older (Remschmidt et al. 2001) supports the developmen-
tal precursor hypothesis. Meanwhile, there is also evidence 
showing that children with SM display even higher levels 
of social anxiety symptoms than children with SAD (e.g., 
Young et al. 2012), which is in line with the extreme mani-
festation  hypothesis.  Thus,  not  speaking  could  reflect  a 
rather primitive strategy displayed by young children in an 
attempt to deal with the fear and apprehension elicited by 
certain social situations, but could also represent the most 
extreme manifestation of anxious avoidance in situations in 
which one is clearly expected to speak but from which physi-
cal escape is impossible (e.g., school).

While the role of anxiety in SM is clear (e.g., Driessen 
et al. 2020; Muris and Ollendick 2015; Sharp et al. 2007; 
Viana et al. 2009), the purpose of the present review is to 
suggest that—in some children with SM—ASD seems to be 
present as well. We have pointed out that on a categorical 
and dimensional level—relations among SM, SAD, and ASD 
are substantial and they can be considered to be a unified 
trinity of social disorders. We have described shared social 
difficulties but also highlighted differences and nuances in 
the symptom picture of these three psychopathologies. We 
assume that relations among these disorders are not random 
but rather propose that SM should be conceptualized as a 
psychiatric condition that primarily emanates from SAD, but 
that in some cases ASD also makes a significant contribu-
tion. More precisely, it can be assumed that the pervasive 
social difficulties associated with this neurodevelopmental 
problem (e.g., social skills deficits) will fuel social anxi-
ety symptoms as well as prompt muteness as the preferred 
strategy to deal with the excessive symptomatology elic-
ited by specific social situations. Further, the RRBIs, espe-
cially the rigidity and cognitive inflexibility associated with 
insistence on sameness as well as sensory hypersensitivity, 
will enhance the social difficulties thereby further intensi-
fying the social anxiety, but also promoting the persistent 
non-speaking behavior displayed by children with SM (see 
Fig. 1a).

Although  the  present  review  has  focused  on  the  role 
of social anxiety and autism spectrum problems in SM, 
it is important to note that in the psychological literature 
a number of other (psycho)pathological conditions have 
been identified that possibly contribute to the prototypical 
muteness associated with this disorder as well (see Fig. 1a). 
For instance, Steinhausen and Juzi (1996) noted that a con-
siderable proportion of children with SM (38%) displayed

of  SM.  As  can  be  seen,  both  the  social  difficulties  (partly  via  social 
anxiety)  and  RRBIs  associated  with  this  neurodevelopmental  disor-
der  may  contribute  to  the  persistent  muteness  displayed  by  children 
with  SM.  b  SAD,  ASD  and  a  number  of  other  (hypothesized)  pos-

iety  disorder,  RRBIs  Restrictive  and  Repetitive  Behaviors  and  Inter-

social cognition, social skills, and social motivation

premorbid speech and language disorders, and in particular 
articulation disorder (20%) and expressive language disor-
der (28%) were relatively common. In a similar vein, the 
study by Kristensen (2000) indicated that children with SM 
more often displayed developmental delay in the domains 
of motor (48.1%) and language (51.9%) as compared to 
typically  developing  control  children  (7.4%  and  11.1%, 
respectively). It is easy to see how difficulties in speech and 
language as well as developmental impediments can cause 
children to become apprehensive of school and other social 
situations. Meanwhile, it is important to be aware of the 
fact that there is also research showing that not all children 
with SM are characterized by marked language and speech 
impairments and developmental delays and that—if pre-
sent at all—deficits in these areas of functioning are rather 
subtle (e.g., Manassis et al. 2003). A similar point can be 
made regarding disruptive behavior problems. The earlier 
described study by Cohan et al. (2008) found that there is a 
subgroup of children with SM in whom heightened levels 
of externalizing problems are present as well. In particular, 

parents have sometimes described children with SM as stub-
born, noncompliant, disobedient, oppositional, negative and 
manipulative, and it is easy to link each of these characteris-
tics to the non-speaking behavior of their offspring (e.g., Dil-
iberto and Kearney 2016). There is indeed research confirm-
ing that externalizing problems such as oppositional-defiant 
disorder are more prevalent among children with SM (e.g., 
as compared to children with SAD: 29% versus 5%; Yeganeh 
et al. 2006), but there are also studies showing that there are 
no signs of elevated levels of behavioral problems in young 
persons with SM (e.g., Cunningham et al. 2004 2006).

In previous publications, we (Muris and Ollendick 2015) 
and others (e.g., Cohan et al. 2006; Viana et al. 2009) have 
adopted the developmental psychopathology perspective to 
conceptualize the etiology of SM. One important premise 
of developmental psychopathology is that disorders like SM 
do not arise as a result of a single deterministic variable, but 
rather develop due to a set of risk and vulnerability factors 
that increase the probability of the psychiatric condition to 
occur. It is also important to bear in mind that the precise 

1 3312 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021) 24:294–325

constellation of risk and vulnerability factors may be, and 
likely are different for each individual child, which is known 
as the principle of equifinality (Cicchetti and Cohen 1995). 
Thus, besides (social) anxiety other variables play a role 
in the development and maintenance of the non-speaking 
behavior of children with SM. This has not only been shown 
in the earlier described study by Cohan et al. (2008) but also 
by Mulligan (2012) who identified five subtypes of the dis-
order that were each typified by a specific set of underlying 
difficulties. Although anxiety appeared to be the prominent 
feature of one subtype of children with SM, other subtypes 
were characterized by the presence of other problems (e.g., 
developmental  delays,  oppositional  behavior,  language 
expression difficulties, sensory/self-regulation problems).

In addition, it is relevant to note that research has identi-
fied a number of other variables that are likely to be involved 
in the pathogenesis of SM. Strongly guided by the current 
notion that SM is an anxiety disorder—or even a variant of 
SAD, it is not surprising that the focus in past research has 
been mainly on variables that are thought to play a role in 
this type of psychopathology, including learning experiences 
(conditioning and avoidance), temperamental vulnerability 
(BI), anxiety-promoting rearing behaviors (overprotection 
and anxious rearing), genetic transmission of anxiety or anx-
iety-related traits, or other circumstances that cause the child 
to become apprehensive of speaking in challenging social 
situations (such as having to speak at school in a non-native 
language and bullying experiences; for a detailed overview 
of the literature, see Muris and Ollendick 2015).

However, we want to emphasize the point that SM is not 
always a pure anxiety phenomenon, and that—at least in a 
significant proportion of the children—other problems play 
a role and most importantly that ASD may also be present. 
Children with this neurodevelopmental disorder display a 
variety of social difficulties: besides intense emotional reac-
tions to social situations and associated avoidance behavior, 
they also exhibit marked impairments in social cognition 
and social skills as well as a lack of social motivation. In 
the case of SM, this could mean that a child with ASD does 
not speak only because of fear and anxiety (or associated 
emotions such as shame and anger) but also because he/she 
does not properly understand specific social situations, has 
difficulties to read other people’s minds, does not know how 
to respond to the other person(s), and/or is less interested in 
engaging in the social interaction. Further, the RRBIs, as 
a specific set of ASD symptoms, could further hinder the 
process because the child is lacking the cognitive flexibility 
to manage the social situation or because the sensory hyper-
sensitivity makes the social situation an even more aversive 
experience (Green and Ben-Sasson 2010).

The contribution of ASD to the etiology of SM does not 
mean that the anxiety pathway to the non-speaking behavior 
of children with this disorder is no longer or less relevant. 

It is plausible that there are clear commonalities in the pro-
cesses underlying the social difficulties as noted for SM, 
SAD, and ASD (i.e., temperament, emotion regulation, and 
neurocircuitry), and even some of the specific difficulties in 
children with ASD may exert their influence on muteness 
via the anxiety route. For example, it can be assumed that 
the pronounced social skills and social cognition deficits of 
children with ASD will elicit expectations of negative evalu-
ation and subsequent fear and anxiety, which in turn will 
lead to non-speaking behavior. However, there may also be 
specific issues in children with ASD that result in muteness 
without a mediating role of anxiety. Think in this regard of 
social motivational motives of non-speaking behavior, such 
as not being interested in the other person or not wanting 
to abort a routine or preferred activity, or a RRBI such as 
sensory hypersensitivity (e.g., the child does not to speak in 
class because it is already too noisy).

Altogether, in our view, ASD and—because this disorder 
is now conceptualized on a continuum—ASD-related traits 
likely play a role in the pathogenesis of SM. It is unclear 
why this point has been largely neglected in the psychologi-
cal and psychiatric literature. Steffenburg et al. (2018), who 
recently conducted their systematic study on the comorbid-
ity between SM and ASD, noted that because muteness is 
such a prominent and dramatic symptom, the diagnosis of 
SM alone is often made by clinicians as this classification 
directly and fully covers this key symptom (a phenomenon 
that is known as ‘diagnostic overshadowing’; Kanne 2013). 
Further, as mentioned before, in diagnostic systems such 
as the DSM and ICD, disorders have long been considered 
as distinct categorical entities, thereby excluding comorbid-
ity as much as possible. This is still echoed in one of the 
diagnostic criteria of SM which states that the disturbance 
should not occur exclusively during the course of autism 
spectrum disorder (APA 2013). However, this criterion is 
rather difficult to maintain when acknowledging the more 
accepted notion that psychopathological phenomena (such as 
anxiety, mutism, and even ASD symptoms) are dimensional 
in nature (e.g., Hudziak et al. 2007; Krueger and Piasecki 
2002). In relation to this point, we see no reason why ASD 
is listed as an exclusion criterion for one anxiety disorder—
SM—while being allowed as a comorbid condition for other 
anxiety disorders including SAD. Finally, for a long time, 
researchers and clinicians have struggled with the objective 
classification of ASD. Although in the past decades reliable 
and valid diagnostic instruments such as the Autism Diag-
nostic Observation Schedule (ADOS; Lord et al. 1999) and 
the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI; Lord et al. 1994) 
have become available (Huerta and Lord 2012), their use in 
clinical settings is still no common practice (e.g., Brett et al. 
2016). In addition, in particular when intelligence is higher 
and language skills are fairly good, the symptoms of ASD 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021) 24:294–325 

313

may be more masked, resulting in difficulties with making 
the proper diagnosis (Mazzone et al. 2012).

Clinical and Research Implications

The acknowledgment of the involvement of ASD in the 
etiology of SM has a number of consequences for clinical 
practice with regard to the classification, assessment, and 
treatment of children with this disorder. In addition, this 
will have repercussions for future empirical studies on SM. 
In this section, these clinical and research issues will be 
discussed.

Implications for Classification

With respect to the classification of SM in current diagnostic 
systems such as DSM (APA 2013) and ICD (WHO 2018), 
we think that its current categorization as an anxiety disor-
der is appropriate given the compelling empirical evidence 
on the role of (social) anxiety in this psychiatric condition. 
Future editions of these systems might consider the role of 
anxiety by including a specific criterion such as “avoidance 
of speaking due to anxiety, fear, or other distress elicited by 
specific social situations” to explicitly reflect this notion, 
thereby giving SM a more firm position within the family of 
anxiety disorders while also referring to its intimate relation 
with SAD in particular. Meanwhile, the potential contribu-
tion of ASD to SM also needs to be acknowledged in a more 
direct way. This could be most effectively done by (1) delet-
ing the rather vague and ambiguous “the disturbance does 
not occur exclusively during the course of ASD” statement 
from the current criteria of SM, and (2) no longer consider-
ing SM as a differential diagnosis of ASD, as it is extremely 
difficult to establish the absence of social reciprocity and 
communication problems and RRBIs because these reflect 
a continuum. Instead, it would be preferable to simply allow 
SM and ASD to be comorbid conditions (just like is cur-
rently done with SM and SAD, and ASD and SAD). After 
all, classification systems are meant to help scientists and 
clinicians correctly identify the psychopathology of a child, 
to get a better understanding of the etiological mechanisms 
involved, and to arrive at a good indication for the proper 
treatment or intervention (Muris 2019).

The ongoing discussion on the defining criteria of SM 
illustrates some of the problems that we encounter in con-
temporary classification systems of mental disorders. More 
precisely, systems such as the DSM and ICD are originally 
based on the notion that psychopathologies are categorical 
in nature and that each disorder is defined by a unique set of 
symptoms that demarcate it from other psychiatric condi-
tions. As noted earlier, mental disorders can better be viewed 
as continua with low symptom levels on the one end and 

high symptom levels on the other end (Hudziak et al. 2007; 
Krueger and Piasecki 2002). Moreover, relations across dis-
orders and overlap in symptoms are the rule rather than the 
exception (e.g., Plana-Ripoll et al. 2019). Even a prototypi-
cal symptom such as mutism is not exclusively linked to the 
anxiety disorder SM but can be associated with a wide range 
of other mental health and developmental problems (see also 
Fig. 1b). As posited in the present review, we think that—
among these—ASD also deserves its position and should not 
be excluded as a related condition. Meanwhile, it is certainly 
not our intention to make the assertion that SM is always 
explained by the presence of ASD. The role of (social) anxi-
ety in SM has been demonstrated and hence should be the 
primary target in terms of assessment and treatment. How-
ever, in some children with SM, ASD may be implicated as 
well and thus also require clinical attention.

ASD is accompanied by a range of social difficulties as 
well as certain peculiarities (RRBIs) that likely fuel chil-
dren’s feelings of discomfort and apprehension of social situ-
ations, thereby making a contribution to the persistent non-
speaking behavior that is so characteristic for SM. Note that 
this observation fits nicely with the network approach to psy-
chopathology (Borsboom and Cramer 2013), which assumes 
that disorders consist of a network of symptoms that interact 
in ways that tend to maintain themselves. As illustrated in 
Fig. 2, the persistent and repeatedly occurring non-speaking 
behavior of a child with SM can be viewed as the central 
symptom in a network of functionally related symptoms. 
Note that the network approach also allows for heterogeneity 
within the disorder. When applying this model hypotheti-
cally to the cases of Ibi and Leo that were presented at the 
start of this review, it becomes clear that there are a number 
of common features but also various differences in the clini-
cal presentation of both boys (Fig. 3). Future research should 
make an attempt to further explore the proposed symptom 
network of children with SM as this could not only bolster 
the role of anxiety but also yield valuable information on the 
contribution of ASD-related (as well as other) symptoms to 
this psychiatric condition (cf. Montazeri et al. 2019).

Clinical Implications for Assessment

An important clinical implication of the observation that 
ASD  is  linked  to  SM  is  of  course  that  the  presence  of 
(symptoms of) this neurodevelopmental disorder needs to 
be assessed during the diagnostic evaluation of children who 
do not speak in specific situations. We think this is a neces-
sary procedure that will give clinicians more insight in the 
pathogenesis of the non-speaking behavior of a child and 
will help them make an informed decision about treatment. 
The socio-emotional consequences of SM are severe enough 
to justify the effort and associated costs, and this approach 
also  seems  feasible  given  the  rarity  of  the  psychiatric

condition. However, as ASD will not be present in every 
child with SM, one could adopt the two-step procedure as 
proposed by Volkmar et al. (2014) to conduct such an assess-
ment effectively and economically. This procedure entails a 
first screening of ASD symptoms by means of a scale that 
has been specifically developed for this purpose, such as 
the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (Baron-Cohen et al. 2001a, 
b), the Social Communication Questionnaire (Rutter et al. 
2003), or the aforementioned SRS (Constantino and Gru-
ber 2005, or in case these are not available one could even 
employ a selective set of items taken from the BASC (Reyn-
olds and Kamphaus 2015) or the widely used Achenbach 
(2009) scales (see Deckers et al. 2020). If the initial screen-
ing indicates significant symptomatology, a more thorough 
and indepth diagnostic evaluation could be conducted using 
the aforementioned ADOS and ADI to determine the pres-
ence and severity of ASD. Thus, apart from standard proce-
dures to assess the language/speech, cognitive, and medical 
(e.g., audiological) functioning of children with SM (Dow 
et al. 1995), the assessment should entail a detailed psychi-
atric evaluation, which includes an assessment of (social) 
anxiety symptoms as well as an evaluation of possibly pre-
sent ASD symptomatology.

Implications for Treatment

The proper assessment of ASD symptomatology is also 
highly relevant for the treatment of children who do not 
speak in specific social situations. In case a child appears to 
display no clear signs of ASD, it is most appropriate to treat 
SM as an anxiety disorder. As such, psychological inter-
ventions should be primarily cognitive-behavioral in nature 
(see Farrell et al. 2019), meaning that exposure to verbal 
communication in feared situations as well as restructuring 
threat-related, negative thinking into more positive thinking 
need to be important elements of treatment. In the literature, 

only a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can 
be found that examined whether the cognitive-behavioral 
approach is indeed an effective intervention for children with 
SM. An exemplary study was conducted by Bergman et al. 
(2013) who evaluated the efficacy of integrated behavioral 
therapy (IBT), a 20-session protocol consisting of gradual 
exposure to speech-related situations, which was supported 
by behavioral techniques such as reinforcement, shaping, 
and  modeling.  Dependent  on  children’s  developmental 
level, cognitive restructuring was also conducted targeting 
the replacement of anxious thoughts with coping self-state-
ments. Twenty-one children with SM aged 4 to 8 years were 
randomly assigned to either the IBT protocol or a waiting 
list, and treatment outcome was evaluated in terms of diag-
nostic status, symptom levels on standardized parent- and 
teacher-report questionnaires, and speech production dur-
ing behavioral tasks. The results showed that 67% of the 
children treated with the IBT protocol no longer fulfilled 
the diagnostic criteria of SM. Further, pre- to post-treatment 
comparisons revealed that symptoms of SM and social anxi-
ety as reported by parents and teachers were significantly 
reduced whereas no such decrease was found in the waiting 
list condition. Finally, on the behavioral speech tasks, chil-
dren who had been treated with the protocol employed on 
average three times as many words as compared to before the 
intervention, while the number of words used in the control 
group did not change from the pre- to post-assessment. Simi-
lar positive results have been obtained in RCTs conducted by 
Oerbeck et al. (2014) and Cornacchio et al. (2019), leading 
to the conclusion that cognitive-behavioral interventions are 
indeed effective for many children with SM (Zakszeski and 
DuPaul 2017).

Cognitive-behavioral interventions have proven to be 
an efficacious treatment for children with anxiety disor-
ders in general (Reynolds et al. 2012), but another via-
ble treatment option for children with anxiety problems

is pharmacotherapy (Muris 2012; Ollendick and March 
2004). In particular, selective serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tors (SSRIs) have been shown to be useful in this regard: 
this type of medication is relatively safe to use, has lim-
ited side effects, and—most importantly—has been shown 
to produce clinically significant symptom reductions in 
children with anxiety disorders (e.g., Walkup et al. 2008). 
Support for the use of SSRIs in children with SM is lim-
ited, however. A controlled study was conducted by Black 
and Uhde (1994) who treated 16 children with SM (aged 
5–16 years) with placebo medication for 2 weeks. The 15 
non-responders were then randomly assigned to a double-
blind treatment with either fluoxetine or continued placebo 
for an additional 12 weeks. The results showed that all 
children showed significant improvements in symptoms at 
the post-treatment assessment, but those who had received 
fluoxetine displayed significantly greater improvements in 
SM symptoms and global functioning as rated by the par-
ents than the placebo-treated controls. Other studies on the 
effects of SSRIs in children with SM have been conducted, 
but these mainly involve open trails or case reports (e.g., 
Kaakeh and Stumpf 2008). So, given the current status 
of  research,  it  seems  most  appropriate  that  SM  is  first 
treated with a cognitive-behavioral intervention, whereas 
pharmacotherapy with SSRIs could be added in case such 
an approach yields no or insufficient results (Ostergaard 
2018).

In case ASD (symptoms) are present in children with 
SM, interventions targeting the (social) anxiety symptoms 
are still applicable, which means that cognitive-behavioral 
therapy and perhaps supplemented by pharmacotherapy with 
SSRIs remain the main spearpoints in treatment (Thorkelson 
et al. 2019; Wood et al. 2009). However, it is important to 
note that various scholars have noted that these interventions 
are less effective in children with ASD. For example, in a 
meta-analysis exploring complete recovery rates of children 
with anxiety disorders who had been treated with cognitive 
behavior therapy, Warwick et al. (2017) noted that approxi-
mately 66% no longer met the diagnostic criteria of any anx-
iety disorder at the end of the intervention. However, there 
was considerable heterogeneity in the full recovery rates 
across these studies, and additional analysis revealed that 
the presence of ASD was an important moderator of out-
come. More precisely, the data showed that whereas in typi-
cally developing children 61% no longer fulfilled the criteria 
of any anxiety disorder, the percentage of such full recov-
ery was only 23% in children with ASD. Thus, although 
researchers have made an effort to optimize the delivery of 
cognitive behavioral treatment in children with ASD (e.g., 
by increased use of visual aids, providing more structure, 
incorporating more and longer sessions, and adding more 
relaxation exercises; Chalfant et al. 2007), the efficacy of 
this intervention appears more limited in this population.

A similar conclusion has been reached with regard to 
the treatment of anxiety disorders in children with ASD by 
means of SSRIs. Williams et al. (2013) conducted a detailed 
review investigating the effects of SSRIs on various aspects 
of functioning in individuals with ASD and noted that “there 
is no evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) are effective as a treatment for children with autism” 
(p. 16). However, it needs to be mentioned that the limited 
number of studies, in particular on the effects of SSRIs on 
anxiety, prevents a solid and valid interpretation. Obviously, 
this is a topic for further scientific inquiry. Meanwhile, it is 
not that surprising that children with ASD respond less well 
to the standard treatment offered for anxiety disorders. As 
we have seen in the current review, the social difficulties of 
children with this neurodevelopmental disorder go further 
than dysregulated social emotion (which includes subjective 
feelings of fear and anxiety, physiological symptoms, and 
avoidance behavior), but also encompass marked problems 
in social cognition, social skills, and social motivation as 
well as other detrimental effects related to the presence of 
RRBIs. Further, at the brain level, ASD is a complex type of 
psychopathology involving multiple neurocircuits and asso-
ciated neurotransmitter systems (Frith 2003).

All this implies that interventions for individuals with 
ASD may need to include a greater variety of components 
that target different aspects of social functioning (Pallathra 
et al. 2019). Fortunately, a wide range of interventions are 
available that can be used for this purpose. For example, 
group-based trainings have been developed to improve the 
social skills of children with ASD, and in general research 
(including a good number of RCTs) has demonstrated that 
such interventions are reasonably effective (Gates et al. 
2017; Reichow and Volkmar 2010). Furthermore, programs 
addressing the prototypical emotion recognition and theory 
of mind difficulties displayed by children with ASD can also 
be found. One example is “Mind Reading”, a computerized 
intervention to increase children’s abilities to understand the 
emotions of other people and to engage in appropriate social 
behavior (LaCava et al. 2010), which has shown promis-
ing results in children with ASD aged 6 years and older 
(Kouo and Egel 2016). In addition, programs are begin-
ning to emerge that aim to improve the social motivation of 
children with ASD. Noteworthy in this regard is the Pivotal 
Response Intervention for Social Motivation (Vernon 2014), 
a behavioral modification program that systematically cou-
ples specific social cues offered to elicit a child’s response 
with a motivating, rewarding stimulus (usually a highly pre-
ferred toy or object). The initial experiences with this type 
of treatment have been positive but need to be tested in more 
large-scale studies (Vernon et al. 2019). Finally, even for 
RRBIs—which as noted earlier are thought to play a role in 
the perseverance of social difficulties of children with ASD, 
specific treatment strategies have been developed (Boyd 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021) 24:294–325 

317

et al. 2012). For instance, to break insistence on sameness 
and rigidity, Miller and Neuringer (2000) have described 
a behavioral technique that involves reinforcing children 
for varying their behavioral responses, with the strength of 
reinforcement being dependent on how novel the displayed 
behavior is. In the case of sensory hypersensitivity, proce-
dures can be employed that either accommodate sensory 
difficulties—for example, by using headphones to attenu-
ate noise in crowded social situations (Pfeiffer et al. 2019), 
or interventions that actually reduce the hyper-reactivity to 
sensory input, such as a systematic desensitization proce-
dure guided by a hierarchy of stimuli to which the child is 
oversensitive (Koegel et al. 2004; see Muskett et al. 2019).
Apart from these psychological interventions—which 
are all based on learning principles and thus behavioral in 
nature, pharmacological interventions may also be help-
ful to reduce the prototypical symptomatology of children 
with ASD. While the efficacy of a wide range of psychiat-
ric drugs have been evaluated in this population, the most 
promising evidence has been documented for antipsychotics 
such as aripiprazole and risperidone (Siegel and Beaulieu 
2012). Although their neural working mechanism is quite 
different, both types of medication have a positive effect 
on children’s social behavior and reduce the occurrence 
and/or severity of RRBIs. More precisely, various placebo-
controlled studies have indicated that aripiprazole and ris-
peridone reduce irritability in children with ASD (Marcus 
et al. 2009; Owen et al. 2009; Research Units on Pediatric 
Psychopharmacology  Autism  Network 2002),  and  most 
importantly significantly improved their adaptive skills as 
well as social functioning (Varni et al. 2012; Williams et al. 
2006). Although the effects of antipsychotic agents such as 
aripiprazole and risperidone should not be overstated (e.g., 
Marrus et al. 2014), they can be helpful in the management 
of the extremely difficult behaviors of children with ASD 
and the mitigation of associated social difficulties.

Taken together, the observation that SM sometimes is a 
psychiatric condition at the crossroads of SAD and ASD has 
clear implications for the treatment of this disorder. That is, 
in those cases for which a careful psychodiagnostic evalu-
ation has shown that SM is not merely an anxiety disorder 
but ASD (symptomatology) is implicated as well, clinicians 
need to provide appropriate psycho-education, set realistic 
treatment goals, and temper expectations regarding outcome 
towards parents as ASD generally is a more difficult-to-treat 
and persistent psychiatric problem. They should consider to 
not only deploy interventions that target dysregulated emo-
tional responses (in particular fear and anxiety) in social 
situations, but also have an eye for the other prototypical 
difficulties in social functioning of children with this neu-
rodevelopmental disorder including deficits in social skills, 
social cognition, and social motivation, which need to be 
addressed in treatment as well. This means that besides 

cognitive-behavior  therapy  and  eventually  SSRIs,  other 
training programs aiming to improve social skills, emotion 
recognition, mind reading abilities, and social interest as 
well as anti-psychotic medication should be considered as 
additional treatment options (Volkmar et al. 2014).

Implications for Research on SM

So far, the evidence for the relationship between SM and 
ASD is based on clinical reports (e.g., Holka-Pokorska et al. 
2018) and a restricted number of empirical studies that have 
been conducted by researchers who went beyond the current 
classification criteria to explore the co-occurrence (Klein 
et al. 2019; Steffenburg et al. 2018) and/or hypothesized 
shared biological or psychological features of both disor-
ders (Cholemkery et al. 2014; Stein et al. 2011; Nowakowski 
et al. 2011). Obviously, we need more clinical studies as well 
as large-scale epidemiological research to get a better pic-
ture of the actual comorbidity of these disorders. Given that 
psychiatric problems are no longer perceived as categorical 
entities but more as dimensional phenomena, another impor-
tant next step in the research would be to further explore the 
link between SM (and social anxiety) and ASD symptoms 
in typically developing children (Muris 2020). Such studies 
could also include an assessment of other mental health and 
developmental issues that have been related to SM in the 
extant literature. This would give a picture of the relative 
contributions of social anxiety, ASD, and other problems 
to SM.

Another possibility would be to go beyond the symptom 
level and to map the social difficulties of children with SM 
in more detail. So far, studies on this topic have been quite 
sparse, but early studies by Nowakowski et al. (2011)—who 
explored impairments in joint attention—and Cunningham 
et al. (2006)—who investigated the social skills of children 
with SM—are good examples of such an approach. Further 
investigations could extend this knowledge and also focus on 
other aspects of social functioning such as mind reading and 
emotion recognition abilities and social interest and motiva-
tion. Another viable route for research could be to examine 
possible transdiagnostic processes that may underlay the 
social difficulties of children with SM and its psychiatric 
allies of SAD and ASD, including inhibited temperament 
characteristics (Gensthaler et al. 2016a; Muris et al. 2016), 
emotion regulation impairments (Weissman et al. 2019; 
White et al. 2014a, b), and dysregulations in ‘social’ brain 
circuitry (Caouette and Guyer 2014; Kennedy and Adolphs 
2012).

In the past decades, a number of high-quality studies have 
been conducted on the treatment of SM by adopting a cog-
nitive-behavioral approach (Bergman et al. 2013; Cornac-
chio et al. 2019; Oerbeck et al. 2014). In general, this type 
of intervention has been shown to be reasonably effective, 

1 3318 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021) 24:294–325

but it would be worthwhile to study whether efficacy levels 
can be raised by adding treatment components that are cur-
rently specifically used in ASD children (e.g., interventions 
to improve theory of mind, social motivation etc.). Similarly, 
in the case of the pharmacological treatment of SM, research 
has primarily focused on SSRIs, but it might be worthwhile 
to also explore the clinical potential of anti-psychotic medi-
cation such as aripiprazole (Ipci et al. 2017), although it 
needs to be stressed that such a treatment approach is only 
indicated when the presence of ASD symptomatology has 
been clearly established.

Conclusion

In the latest versions of classification systems such as the 
DSM (American Psychiatric Association 2013) and ICD 
(World Health Organization 2018), SM is categorized as 
an anxiety disorder. As noted throughout this review, this is 
justified when looking at the abundant empirical evidence 
demonstrating that (social) anxiety is a common symptom 
associated with this psychiatric condition (Driessen et al. 
2020; Cohan et al. 2008; Diliberto and Kearney 2016, 2018; 
Schwenck et al. 2019; Vogel et al. 2019). The acknowledge-
ment of SM being an anxiety problem is strongly guiding 
our  thinking  about  the  origins  of  the  disorder,  which  is 
reflected in developmental psychopathology models that 
are dominated by anxiety-relevant etiological factors (Cohan 
et al. 2006; Muris and Ollendick 2015; Viana et al. 2009). In 
line with this, current treatments of SM can be summarized 
under the header of “Reinforce, shape, expose, and fade” 
(Zakszeski and DuPaul 2017, p. 1), indicating that (cogni-
tive) behavioral approaches, just like in other anxiety disor-
ders (e.g., Rapee et al. 2009), are the dominant intervention.
It is not our intention to downplay the role of (social) 
anxiety in SM, but rather we want to point out that SM may 
also be connected to ASD and that this may have impor-
tant implications for the clinical management as well as 
research of children with this disorder. More precisely, we 
have argued that there seems to be a group of children with 
SM in which the key symptom of muteness is not entirely 
based on fear and anxiety, but ASD symptomatology plays 
a prominent role as well. For clinicians, it is important to 
have an eye out for these children as their treatment might 
require not only to focus on the alleviation of anxiety but 
also to target other prototypical social difficulties displayed 
by children on the autism spectrum. This was also true for 
the cases of Ibi and Leo described at the beginning of this 
article: for both boys, we started energetic with an anxiety-
focused cognitive-behavioral approach, but after some time 
realized that we had to take a step back and after an appro-
priate assessment adjusted our intervention plan, making 

it more appropriate for these children on the crossroads of 
SAD and ASD.
