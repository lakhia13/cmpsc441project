Purpose: To investigate the effect of a voice and communication training program for oral presentations 
on higher education students. Methods: The proposed training program was based on the areas of social 
skills,  voice  projection  techniques,  and  neurolinguistic  programming.  Thirty-eight  students  participated 
in the training with active learning methodologies at the university. Before and after the intervention, the 
participants  recorded  a  short  oral  presentation  on  a  topic  of  their  choice.  The  recording  was  presented 
to  the  other  participants  and  to  a  panel  formed  by  three  examiners  (two  articulation  therapists  and  a 
psychologist), who evaluated the oral presentation performances. Moreover, each individual self-assessed 
their communication. The evaluation criteria covered the linguistic aspects, formal and non-formal, verbal 
and  non-verbal  communication,  planning,  and  elaboration  of  the  presentation.  Results: All  participants 
improved their performance in oral presentations regarding verbal and para-verbal aspects, ability to keep 
the audience, emotional control, planning, objective, content, approach, organization, visual resource, form 
of presentation, language, and general elements (general presentation). Conclusion: The proposed training 
program is effective in improving the performance of university students in oral presentations.

Objetivo: Investigar o efeito de um programa de treinamento em voz e comunicação para apresentações orais 
em estudantes de ensino superior. Método: O programa de treinamento proposto foi baseado nas áreas das 
habilidades sociais, técnicas de projeção vocal e expressividade e a programação neurolinguística, sendo composto 
de dez sessões com duração média de duas horas cada. Trinta e oito estudantes participaram do treinamento 
com metodologias ativas de aprendizagem na própria universidade. Antes e após a intervenção, os participantes 
realizaram uma apresentação oral sobre um tópico da própria escolha, apresentada aos demais participantes e 
para uma banca formada por três juízes (dois fonoaudiólogos e um psicólogo), que avaliaram o desempenho nas 
apresentações orais. As apresentações foram gravadas para que cada indivíduo pudesse realizar a autoavaliação 
da sua comunicação. Os critérios de avaliação foram os aspectos linguísticos formais e não formais, verbais e 
não verbais, planejamento e elaboração da apresentação. Resultados: todos os participantes obtiveram melhora 
de  desempenho  nas  apresentações  orais,  quanto  aos  aspectos  verbais,  não  verbais,  capacidade  de  manter  a 
audiência, controle emocional, planejamento, objetivo, conteúdo, abordagem, organização, recurso visual, forma 
de apresentar, linguagem e geral (apresentação geral). Conclusão: o programa de treinamento apresentado é 
efetivo para melhorar o desempenho de universitários durante apresentações orais.

Public  speaking  abilities  might  be  a  determinant  for 
professional  success  since  it  is  demanded  by  the  market, 
becoming a professional skill(1-4). In this context, communication 
is a fundamental skill to be developed and improved throughout 
academic and professional trajectory(5). Up to 89.3% of students 
would prefer that their undergraduate courses offered lessons on 
how to improve public speaking(1). Most people face difficulties 
in oral presentations, especially in the academic environment(5,6). 
The lack of mastering such a skill when presenting seminars 
leads students to not know how to speak, stand, gesture, or 
look at the audience. In other words, they do not know how 
to cope with a situation of exposure(5-8).

A survey involving 2,001 American universities reported an 
incompatibility between the perception of the newly graduated 
of  their  communication  skills  and  the  evaluation  of  their 
employers. While 80% of the newly graduated considered 
themselves prepared in terms of communication skills for 
the work market, only 44% of the employers considered that 
those skills were adequate for the work market. In addition, 
such  skills  predicted  a  79.1%  chance  of  a  new  graduate 
being hired(9).

Communication  takes  place  in  a  multimodal  way,  using 
verbal, vocal, and non-verbal resources(9). Vocal resources are 
linked  to  vocal  quality  and  dynamics,  including  parameters 
such as pitch, loudness, intonation, accentuation, modulation, 
pauses, and rhythm, among others. Verbal resources are speech, 
the use of words, and the elaboration of speech. Non-verbal 
resources are body language, complemented by vocal resources 
and supporting visual signs(10,11).

Communication situations such as public speaking, talking 
about matters outside our scope, or personal emotional topics 
might lead anxiety to manifest. Anxiety may emerge in situations 
of change, new experiences, and other common situations of 
human development. However, when anxiety is too intense, it 
can  damage  professional,  academic,  and  social  experiences. 
Public  exposure  situations  may  cause  performance  anxiety, 
described  as  a  state  of  anxiety  that  emerges  in  particular 
conditions and can be considered a reaction to a stimulus. It is 
a transitory condition that occurs upon the confrontation with 
a given stimulus. Public speaking, acting, singing, playing a 
musical instrument in public, or competing in events are known 
examples of stimuli(10).

In  this  sense,  enhancing  the  experience  and  skill  of 
coping with public speaking situations might soften negative 
impacts(1,3,8,12).  Thus,  training  that  allows  these  experiences 
and skills might improve performance in presentations, hence 
reducing complaints.

Neuro-linguistic  programming  (NLP)  is  based  on 
neurosciences to emphasize that human behavior originates 
from neurological processes. It is an important set of skills 
based on the psychological features of human beings through 
which  individuals  achieve  the  competence  of  using  their 
skills  as  much  as  possible(13).  NLP  proposes  the  possibility 
of  programming  actions  by  using  the  language  concerned 
primarily  with  reaching  results.  NLP  works  by  identifying 

individual patterns, changing their responses to stimuli, and 
self-regulation. In addition, NLP covers techniques that enable 
oral presentations by making them common activities that can 
be performed by students(14).

Based on this, this study aimed to investigate the effect of 
a voice and communication program on oral presentations in 
higher education students.

METHODS

Study design and ethical questions

The research project of this intervention study was subjected 
to  and  approved  by  the  Human  Research  Ethics  Committee 
(CEP – abbreviation in Portuguese) of the School of Dentistry 
of  –  University  of  São  Paulo  –  FOB/USP,  protocol  number 
2,820,877. All participants signed the informed consent form 
(TCLE), according to the CEP rules.

Participants and Location

The convenience sample included 38 higher education 
students from a public university in the state of São Paulo, 
27  females  and  11  males  aged  on  average  21.8  years  old. 
All students were in the first year of the Speech-Language 
Therapy  (n=20),  Medicine  (n=15),  and  Dentistry  (n=3) 
undergraduate courses.

Recruitment and application of the initial registration form

To recruit participants, the survey was shared at the university 
itself  (bulletin  boards,  institutional  emails,  and  website),  as 
well as on social media profiles to which students had access. 
An e-mail address and telephone number were made available 
to those interested in taking part in the research. Those who 
got  in  touch  received  a  registration  form  consisting  of  the 
following fields: personal details, interest, and willingness to 
take part in the research along with the necessary information 
about the research and a report on their main difficulties in oral 
presentations (such as seminars), as shown in Annex 1.

The  participants  were  selected  based  on  the  following 
inclusion  criteria:  to  be  actively  enrolled  in  the  first  year 
of  undergraduate  courses  at  the  institution  of  origin  in  the 
year  of  the  research  project;  to  report  difficulties  in  using 
linguistic and non-linguistic resources in oral presentations 
(difficulty in public speaking due to nervousness, in behaving 
and/or holding the audience’s attention in oral presentations, 
difficulties with speech intonation, articulation and/or vocal 
projection  only  during  oral  presentations);  to  be  available 
and  accept  participating  in  all  the  proposed  activities. 
The exclusion criterion was having taken any courses in oral 
expression or Neuro-linguistic Programming – NLP(14). Before 
data collection, the participants received a free and informed 
consent form containing the research calendar (pre-intervention, 
intervention,  and  post-intervention)  and  instructions  on  the 
importance of attending all meetings, since otherwise would 
compromise the results.

Data collection

Assessment

Assessment by expert judges

The assessment was carried out through an assessment 
form named “Oral Presentation Assessment Form – OPF” 
(Annex 2) based on an oral presentation using PowerPoint 
on  a  topic  of  choice  of  each  participant,  which  was  the 
same for both the pre- and post-presentation moments. The 
participant  choosing  the  topic  is  for  us  to  disregard  the 
technical knowledge and mastery variable and analyze the 
quality of the oral presentation. Each participant had three 
minutes for the presentation.

The examiners were calibrated together the week before 
at a three-hour training meeting, during which the researcher 
presented the research proposal, all the items on the assessment 
form were discussed and any doubts were clarified.

The assessment was conducted in two steps: one week 
before training and one week after the training, considered 
as  pre-  and  post-intervention,  respectively,  using  the  OPF 
(Annex 2), developed by the researchers and introduced in 
the item Instruments.

For a blind assessment, three independent examiners were 
invited.  The  assessment  panel  consisted  of  two  articulation 
therapists, a language specialist (with extensive experience in 
linguistics), a voice specialist, and a psychologist with experience 
in social skills.

Self-assessment

The  oral  presentations  in  the  pre-  and  post-intervention 
steps were recorded for the self-assessment. The footage was 
provided to the study participants for them to watch and assess 
their  performance. Along  with  the  footage,  we  provided  the 
self-assessment  form,  composed  of  two  parts  that  should  be 
filled in distinct moments. The footage of the pre-intervention 
moment  was  provided  one  week  after  the  first  meeting,  and 
the participants had two weeks to fill out the self-assessment 
form. The footage of the post-intervention was only provided 
one week after the last meeting, and the participants had two 
weeks to fill out the self-assessment form.

The  same  assessment  criterion  by  the  examiners  was 
considered for ruling “improvement, worsening, or neutrality”. 
The footage was performed in full HD using the Handycam Sony 
Hdr-CX405 HD equipment and provided to the participants 
via  share  drive.  Each  participant  had  access  only  to  their 
respective footage.

Instruments

Assessment form development

The “Oral Presentation Assessment Form – OPF” (Annex 2) 
was elaborated by the researchers in this study before the start 
of the intervention, based on protocols of similar assessments(15). 
Upon literature review, the form needed to be elaborated since 
no  other  validated  protocols  were  found  that  assessed  each 
participant’s performance according to the demands of our study. 

The presentation must be analyzed by focusing on the items 
addressed in the support material, which was provided to and 
worked with the research participants.

The same form was used both in the pre- and post-intervention 
assessments,  and  the  examiners  could  not  access  the  pre-
intervention form any longer at the post-intervention step to 
prevent one assessment from influencing the other. The form 
consists of two parts, both containing qualitative and quantitative 
criteria since both were assigned numerical values in the final 
(statistical) analysis, as follows:

Part I – The following elements were assessed(1): linguistic 
criteria (formal and informal aspects) and(2) communication 
(non-verbal) complementary elements.

The  following  components  of  the  linguistic  criteria 
were  considered:  vocabulary,  grammar,  pronunciation, 
intonation, pauses, and mean presentation time. The following 
communication complementary (non-verbal) were considered: 
articulation, loudness, eye contact, smiling when suitable, 
adequate  posture,  keeping  the  audience,  and  emotional 
control. All  these  components  were  subjected  to  a  Likert 
scale ranging “always” (assigned with a score of 5), “often” 
(score  4),  “sometimes”  (score  3),  “rarely”  (score  2),  and 
“never” (score 1).

Part II – Covering the general aspects of oral presentation, to 
which scores from 0 (zero) to 10 (ten) were assigned, as 
follows: planning, content, approach, organization, visual 
resource, Form of presentation, emotional control, language, 
and general assessment. The analysis criterion was assigned 
a score between 0 (unprepared) to 10 (excellent).

For an ‘improvement’ to be ruled, the individual must increase 
at least one level in the Likert scale of the OPF and at least one 
point in the score by comparing the pre- and post-intervention 
steps with the General Assessment. In turn, for a ‘worsening’ 
to be ruled, the individual must decrease a level in the Likert 
scale and one point in the score. Finally, for ‘neutrality’ to be 
ruled, the individual must keep the same score based on the 
examiner’s mean.

Self-assessment form development

The first part consisted of the Scale for Self-Evaluation 
during  Public  Speaking  (Annex  3),  an  adaptation  of  the 
“Self-statements during Public Speaking Scale – SSPS”(16), 
which  aims  to  self-assess  cognitive  aspects  in  situations 
where  public  speaking  is  a  stressor.  The  SSPS  is  a  self-
administered instrument consisting of two sub-scales, positive 
self-assessment, and negative self-assessment, each with five 
items scored on a scale from zero to five, according to the 
original description of the scale(16). Participants were asked 
to fill in the scale as soon as they had finished presenting, as 
they needed to describe their real feelings about the situation 
of being exposed in public.

3/14

The SSPS scale has two subdivisions: positive (SSPS-P) 
and  negative  (SSPS-N)  self-affirmations.  The  participants 
must choose the score with which they most related, from 0 
(strongly disagree with the statement) to 5 (strongly agree with 
the statement). The items of the SSPS linked to aspects regarded 
as positive in the self-assessment are those numbered 1, 3, 5, 6, 
and 9, whereas those regarded as negative are items 2, 4, 7, 8, 
and 10. Thus, there are ten items on the self-assessment scale 
(five positive and five negative).

The second part of the self-assessment instrument for this 
survey was designed by the researchers, based on the second 
part  of  the  “OPF”,  so  that  the  participants  and  judges  could 
assess the same variables. Participants had to answer this part 
by  assessing  their  performance  after  watching  their  footage. 

The footage was made available to each participant, and each 
only  had  contact  with  their  footage,  which  was  not  made 
available to the others.

Intervention

Elaboration step

We created support material based on a bibliographic survey 
of effective communication using verbal, vocal, and non-verbal 
resources, based on social skills training(13,17,18), neurolinguistic 
programming tools(14,19), and vocal projection and expressiveness 
techniques(8,15,17,20)  as  theoretical  references.  The  taxonomic 
model of communication training used was based (Figure 1) 
on the vocal therapy taxonomy model by Van Stan et al.(21).

Initially, we carried out a prior pilot study including a smaller 
number  of  participants,  different  from  the  current  sample(22) 
to test the model for offering the workshop and adapting the 
support material, as part of a funded scientific initiation project.
The material developed by the authors was freely available 
to the participants in printed form and as an eBook (in PDF), 
so that they could access it whenever necessary throughout the 
training period.

Intervention program implementation

This research was conducted over eight weeks at the hours 

that were convenient to all participants.

The intervention program consisted of ten meetings with 
theoretical and practical content, weekly, with each meeting 

lasting an average of two hours. However, the first meeting 
was held a month before the intervention started to explain the 
research and sign the consent forms. The last meeting was held 
to give the participants feedback on their performance. The 
total number of meetings was to ensure that the participants 
completed  the  training  within  the  agreed  timeframe  of  one 
semester in higher education, as well as based on the results 
of the abovementioned pilot study and other communication 
surveys(1-3)

The research location was one of the classrooms of the 
studied university, which is a large space that holds up to 
50 students, with mobile chairs for various uses depending 
on  the  training  dynamics.  Chart 1  details  the  intervention 
program.

feedback.

The form contains the individual results for 
each participant to learn their progress.

Data analysis

We  performed  a  descriptive  and  inferential  statistical 
analysis  using  the  Statistic  10.0  program.  Since  most  of  the 
time the normality test did not show a normal distribution, the 
Wilcoxon  non-parametric  test  was  applied. The  significance 
level of p≤0.05% was adopted.

RESULTS

Next, we describe the results of 38 participants included for 
data analysis. We only considered the data from participants who 
completed the training, with no absences (100% attendance). 
Although 42 individuals were registered at the start, four (9.5%) 
of them took the training but had their outcomes disregarded 
due to two absences throughout the intervention.

Examiners’ evaluation

The results below describe the assessment by the examiners 
by comparing the pre- and post-intervention analyses. Table 1 
shows the comparison of the qualitative components based on 
the Likert scale.

In Table 1, the values of the pre- and post-intervention mean 
show that the examiners observed a significant improvement in 
the participants in all items analyzed. The items of eye contact 
(from 2.26 in the pre-intervention to 3.55 in the post-intervention), 
smiling  when  suitable  (from  2.26  in  the  pre-intervention  to 

3.79 in the post-intervention), and adequate posture during the 
presentation (from 2.21 in the pre-intervention to 3.79 in the 
post-intervention) had the greatest impact considering p<0.001 
(statistically significant) for all items.

Table 2 shows the comparison of the quantitative components. 
According to the pre- and post-intervention by the examiners, the 
following items had the highest improvement means approach 
(from  7.35  in  pre-intervention  to  9.28  in  post-intervention), 
presentation organization (from 7.73 in pre-intervention to 9.44 in 
post-intervention), the language used (from 7.58 in pre-intervention 
to 9.31 in post-intervention), and Form of presentation (from 7.11 
in pre-intervention to 9.07 in post-intervention) – all statistically 
significant values (p<0.001) for all items.

Self-assessment

The most frequent complaints by the participants regarding 
public  speaking  were  nervousness  (76%),  insecurity  (74%), 
anxiety  (68%),  not  being  able  to  convey/express  what  they 
want to say (63%), fear of forgetting or making mistakes (60%), 
followed by shyness (53%), knowing the best posture (53%), 
being embarrassed to speak in public (50%), speaking clearly 
(50%), projecting the voice correctly (42%), among others (8%).
The results in Table 3 show a significant increase in the score 
by comparing the pre- and post-intervention based on the SSPS-P 
subscale  and  significantly  lower  pre-  and  post-intervention 
based on the SSPS-N subscale, considering p<0.001 for both.

This highlights that the self-assessment not only increased the 
mean of positive self-affirmations (from 15.9 in the pre-intervention 
to 20.9 in the post-intervention) but also decreased the mean of 
negative self-affirmations (from 10.6 in the pre-intervention to 
6.3 in the post-intervention). There was also an increase in the 
percentage of positive self-affirmations, from 44% to 68%, as 
well as a decrease in negative self-affirmations, from 56% to 
32% in the post-intervention.

Table 4 shows the results of the pre- and post-intervention 
steps in the quantitative self-assessment. Such numbers reveal 

higher  values  for  the  post-intervention  compared  with  the 
pre-intervention, with statistically significant differences in all 
items (values of p<0.001). Nonetheless, significantly better means 
were found for the items of presentation organization (from 6.19 
in pre-intervention to 8.06 in post-intervention), the language used 
(from 6.03 in pre-intervention to 8.11 in post-intervention), most 
used visual resources (from 6.71 in pre-intervention to 8.53 in 
post-intervention), emotional control (from 5.17 in pre-intervention 
to 7.77 in post-intervention), and general assessment (from 6.27 
in pre-intervention to 8.30 in post-intervention).

DISCUSSION

The proposed training program was effective in improving 
the communication skills of university students. All variables 
measured linked to verbal and non-verbal resources improved 
after the training both by the examiners’ and students’ perceptions. 
It is worth noting that among the qualitative elements analyzed 
by the examiners, the most highlighted improvement occurred 
for eye contact, smiling when suitable, and adequate posture 
during  presentation. As  to  the  quantitative  aspects,  the  most 
highlighted improvement occurred in approach, presentation 
organization, the language used, and the form of presentation.
Despite the greater improvement perceived by the students 
in their self-assessments coincided, in qualitative terms, with the 
examiners’ assessment for the items of presentation organization 
and  language,  most  of  these  students  perceived  a  greater 
improvement in emotional control and their general assessment 
(including message clarity, achieving goals, interesting dynamics, 
pleasant/informative or thought-provoking content). Prior research 
has also reported that the same aspects mentioned by both the 
examiner and the participants in this study are complementary, 
which means that usual emotions influence facial expression, 
voice, and body posture(9,10).

Our  study  covered  techniques  and  tools  from  different 
fields(13,14,18,19,23-25) integrated into a prior didactic material that 
provided the basis for both the training development and the 
support material to instruct on the use of linguistic resources in 
oral presentations for higher education students. Specifically, 
the  items  of  body  posture  and  facial  expression  showed  a 
significant improvement, both according to the examiners and 
the  participants.  Such  a  result  is  based  on  the  mean  values 
reached  through  greater  eye  contact,  smiling  when  suitable 
during  the  presentation,  and  body  posture  by  comparing  the 
pre- and post-intervention assessments described herein, which 
corroborates findings of similar studies in fields related to training 
and communication(9,13,14,19).

When  working  with  human  communication,  emotion  is 
an important factor in conveying the intention convincingly, 
hence  being  a  relevant  part  of  natural,  spontaneous  human 

communication. The literature(11,19,23) demonstrates that throughout 
communication, emotion can be expressed both consciously and 
unconsciously through elements such as linguistic utterance(6), 
paralinguistic features, or vocal features(20). Our study corroborates 
such  information  more  specifically  through  the  participants’ 
self-assessment,  who  reported  better  emotional  control  by 
comparing the means before and after the training.

Such a positive self-assessment of the participants’ emotional 
aspect is significant since their most frequent complaints before 
starting  the  intervention,  which  supported  their  decision  to 
participate in the training, were nervousness, insecurity, anxiety, 
and not being able to convey/express what they want to say. 
According  to  a  prior  study(8),  these  complaints  might  result 
from  a  lack  of  speaking  practice,  insufficient  knowledge  on 
the topic, and negative self-image, with the lack of experience 
as the most important factor(1,23), which led the training herein 
proposed to reach positive outcomes.

Still  regarding  self-image,  the  self-assessment  by  the 
participants – shown in one of the instruments(4) – indicated that 
the positive self-affirmations increased significantly. In turn, the 
negative affirmations about their presentations also decreased 
significantly, thus reinforcing the results of other studies(7,8,22). 
Such studies have pointed out that a negative self-image influences 
oral presentations, whereas when the individual feels prepared, 
this self-image tends to improve.

Based  on  such  a  consideration  regarding  the  self-image 
of a good communicator, we chose to follow the assumptions 
of  Neuro-linguistic  Programming  –  NLP(13,14,19)  as  a  tool  for 
developing the teaching material and training, in addition to 
proposing the exercise of mental state change(18,19,26) by directing 
the effort toward social skills to promote greater confidence and 
encouraging during the presentation.

To make the change in mental state possible(19,26), the proposed 
training gave the participants a theoretical introduction to how a 
presentation should be designed for different types of audiences 
and the importance of reaching everyone. This concept was later 
named in the assessment, as in similar studies(3,12,27), as “making 
eye contact with everyone present” and “ability to maintain the 
audience’s interest”, considered within the “general” criterion.

These aspects were rated similarly in terms of post-intervention 
improvement by both the judges and the participants themselves, 
being items with the most significant changes, as shown by the 
results obtained in studies with similar populations(3,12,27).

The  training  worked  the  communication  skills  through 
practical activities in which the participants performed voice 
and body exercises based on the relationship between voice and 
communication skills pointed out in studies of the field(17,20,23). 
These activities simulated oral exposition situations of voice 
projection, pauses, posture, gestures, and other linguistic and 
communication skills, as suggested in the literature(3,12,16,20,23,24,27-29).
We  believe  that  the  improvement  in  elements  such  as 
articulation, loudness, intonation, pauses, and average presentation 
time reached with the proposed training is  linked  to the  use 
of  specific  vocal  techniques  aimed  at,  according  to  studies 
in  the  field(17,20),  enhancing  the  articulation  pattern,  favoring 
voice projection, softening emission, and(24,28,29) improving the 
pneumo-phonoarticulatory coordination and promoting greater 
balance of voice production.

These skills (articulation, loudness, eye contact, smiling when 
suitable, appropriate posture, keeping the audience, intonation, 
and pauses) are part of expressiveness(30), and working together 
with all these variables enables communication that is appropriate 
to the context and discourse. It also allows them to improve 
their  self-image  and  the  speaker’s  communication,  which  is 
corroborated in studies not only with similar populations such 
as  university  students(3,12,27)  but  also  with  other  populations, 
including those involving other professionals(1,2,7,20).

The study participants’ improvement in vocabulary, grammar, 
and the use of pronouns may have been brought about by the 
language content covered in the first and last chapters of the 
theoretical-practical  material  prepared  for  the  training.  The 
material guided the way of speaking, word choice, and regency 
so that the students would be aware of these aspects when giving 
an oral presentation.

For the speaker to have a larger view on their performance, 
the relationship among all aspects involved in communication 
must be addressed, such as language, voice, communicative skill, 
linguistic and non-linguistic genders used when communicating, 
as well as focusing on their social skills(2,6,13,17,18,20) as observable 
and measurable behaviors. The focus is moved from merely 
emotional matters initially reported by the participants, such 
as fear and anxiety about public speaking(1,8,11,16,23,30).

The self-assessment included in the study brought important 
results, with several positive implications for the individual, 
as  pointed  out  in  similar  studies(1,3,7,22),  such  as  facilitating 
self-regulation, providing a sense of self-continuity, speeding 
up the processing of relevant information, helping to set goals, 
influencing social perception, and contributing to the projection 
of a consistent and desirable self-image to others(3).

The participants in this study pointed to an improvement in 
“planning”, “objectives”, “content”, “approach”, “organization”, 
and “visual resources” in their self-assessment, either because of 
training addressing how to structure research and presentation – 
using basic concepts of research methodology and presentation – 
or because of the focus on the theoretical and practical preparation 
for presentation. Such a result corroborates other studies reporting 

that preparing for the topic, like mastering the theme, coherence, 
scientific background, and Form of presentation, might decrease 
the fear of public speaking by 75%.

Knowledge  of  the  content  directly  affects  the  style  the 
presenter conducts it, demonstrating a greater or lesser degree 
of confidence and critical handling of the content to engage the 
audience, as shown in previous works(25,30).

Another aspect to be discussed is the Self-Assessment Scale 
for Public Speaking (SSPS). Since a limitation of this study was 
the absence of validated questionnaires that included the items 
required to assess the participants’ performance according to 
the demands of the study, the SSPS scale was translated and 
adapted to the needs of the research.

As  for  the  results  of  the  scale,  the  scores  show  that  by 
increasing  the  SSPS-P  (positive  self-affirmations)  subscale 
score and decreasing the SSPS-N (negative self-affirmations) 
subscale score, the participants became more self-confident and 
able to face the public speaking situation and showed to be less 
anxious and better prepared after taking the communication 
training.

Studies(4,19) that used the same scale have highlighted that 
negative self-affirmations might be more closely associated with 
anxiety about public speaking than positive self-affirmations. 
Such a scenario might indicate that by pointing out negative 
self-affirmations  less  often,  the  participants  become  less 
prone to reaffirming or increasing their anxiety about public 
speaking and even evolving into a social phobia or related 
anxiety disorder. Studies in the field(8,12-14,19,22,23,26) have reported 
that training for public exposure and communication, such 
as  cognitive-behavioral  techniques  and  social  skills,  are 
effective  in  treating  social  phobias  related  to  the  fear  of 
public speaking.

The results of a study(27) aimed at analyzing a speech therapy 
intervention  for  university  students  in  seminar  presentations 
showed positive effects on oral aspects and better confidence 
perception by the participants when better reaching their audiences. 
The examiner speech therapists in the above-mentioned study 
observed advances regarding oral, body, and interaction aspects. 
Thus, our general results corroborate such findings(27) and open 
a reflection on why this fear is still one of the most prevalent 
among university students. Is it not the role of universities to 
prepare students for this activity?

Every year, thousands of students are admitted to universities 
in search of a profession, and, during their training, they encounter 
tasks that demand intellectual growth and the improvement of 
skills, such as public speaking. If a higher education institution 
believes that it needs to prepare its students to communicate 
effectively  in  their  future  professional  environments(1-3),  it  is 
worth reflecting on how it has handled this training.

Should  intervention  programs  on  oratory  and  improving 
oral communication performance not be part of the professional 
training curriculum? Training professionals for the job market 
should focus on teaching skills and abilities beyond the technical 
content of a given profession. Universities need to provide the 
conditions for students to learn not only about the content of 
the profession but also about the behavioral requirements of 
the job they have chosen(18).

A limitation of this study might be including students from only 
one educational institution (despite three undergraduate courses). 
However, as the participants improved their performance in all 
aspects analyzed after the intervention, the proposed training 
proved  applicable  as  an  auxiliary  tool  for  the  planning  and 
improvement of communication training for such a population. 
Therefore, our research contributes to speech therapists proposing 
training programs and speech therapy consultancy in the area 
at universities, representing a promising professional field.

We suggest that similar studies using the training proposed 
here  be  developed  in  other  higher  education  institutions. 
The goal is that this study can contribute to the teaching of skills 
and abilities beyond technical content within universities. We 
also expect this material to be able to integrate subject content at 
various universities and provide support for university students 
in the area of communication.

CONCLUSION

The proposed training program was effective in improving the 
communication skills of university students in oral presentations. 
There has been an improvement – from the perspective of both the 
examiners and the participants – in skills linked to the verbal and 
non-verbal resources used, as well as in the qualitative aspects, 
such as eye contact, smiling when suitable, and adequate posture 
during  the  presentation.  In  addition,  the  quantitative  aspects 
also  improved,  such  as  presentation  organization,  language 
used, and visual resources.

In  the  self-assessment,  the  students  participating  in  the 
study also reported improved emotional control during the oral 
presentations and in their overall evaluations after the training, 
including the clarity of the message, whether the goals were 
met, and whether it was interesting, enjoyable/informative, or 
thought-provoking.

Objetivo: Investigar o efeito de um programa de treinamento em voz e comunicação para apresentações orais 
em estudantes de ensino superior. Método: O programa de treinamento proposto foi baseado nas áreas das 
habilidades sociais, técnicas de projeção vocal e expressividade e a programação neurolinguística, sendo composto 
de dez sessões com duração média de duas horas cada. Trinta e oito estudantes participaram do treinamento 
com metodologias ativas de aprendizagem na própria universidade. Antes e após a intervenção, os participantes 
realizaram uma apresentação oral sobre um tópico da própria escolha, apresentada aos demais participantes e 
para uma banca formada por três juízes (dois fonoaudiólogos e um psicólogo), que avaliaram o desempenho nas 
apresentações orais. As apresentações foram gravadas para que cada indivíduo pudesse realizar a autoavaliação 
da sua comunicação. Os critérios de avaliação foram os aspectos linguísticos formais e não formais, verbais e 
não verbais, planejamento e elaboração da apresentação. Resultados: todos os participantes obtiveram melhora 
de  desempenho  nas  apresentações  orais,  quanto  aos  aspectos  verbais,  não  verbais,  capacidade  de  manter  a 
audiência, controle emocional, planejamento, objetivo, conteúdo, abordagem, organização, recurso visual, forma 
de apresentar, linguagem e geral (apresentação geral). Conclusão: o programa de treinamento apresentado é 
efetivo para melhorar o desempenho de universitários durante apresentações orais.

Purpose: To investigate the effect of a voice and communication training program for oral presentations 
on higher education students. Methods: The proposed training program was based on the areas of social 
skills,  voice  projection  techniques,  and  neurolinguistic  programming.  Thirty-eight  students  participated 
in the training with active learning methodologies at the university. Before and after the intervention, the 
participants  recorded  a  short  oral  presentation  on  a  topic  of  their  choice.  The  recording  was  presented 
to  the  other  participants  and  to  a  panel  formed  by  three  examiners  (two  articulation  therapists  and  a 
psychologist), who evaluated the oral presentation performances. Moreover, each individual self-assessed 
their communication. The evaluation criteria covered the linguistic aspects, formal and non-formal, verbal 
and  non-verbal  communication,  planning,  and  elaboration  of  the  presentation.  Results: All  participants 
improved their performance in oral presentations regarding verbal and para-verbal aspects, ability to keep 
the audience, emotional control, planning, objective, content, approach, organization, visual resource, form 
of presentation, language, and general elements (general presentation). Conclusion: The proposed training 
program is effective in improving the performance of university students in oral presentations.

A  competência  de  falar  em  público  pode  ser  um  dos 
determinantes do sucesso profissional. Faz parte da exigência do 
mercado de trabalho e passa a ser uma qualificação profissional(1-4). 
Nesse contexto, a comunicação é uma habilidade essencial a 
ser  desenvolvida  e  aprimorada  durante  a  vida  acadêmica  e 
profissional(5).  Demonstra-se  que  até  89,3%  dos  estudantes 
gostariam  que  seu  programa  de  graduação  incluísse  aulas 
para  melhorar  a  modalidade  de  comunicação  em  público(1). 
A maioria das pessoas apresenta dificuldades em se expor em 
apresentações  orais,  principalmente  no  meio  acadêmico(5,6). 
Por não o dominarem é comum que os alunos em situação de 
seminário não saibam como falar, como se posicionar, gesticular, 
como olhar para as pessoas, ou seja, não sabem como agir diante 
da situação de exposição(5-8).

Uma pesquisa com 2.001 universidades americanas demonstrou 
que  havia  uma  incompatibilidade  entre  a  percepção  dos 
recém-formados quanto às suas habilidades de comunicação e a 
avaliação dos empregadores. Enquanto 80% dos recém-formados 
consideravam que estavam preparados em termos de habilidades 
de comunicação para o mercado de trabalho, apenas 44% dos 
empregadores  consideram  que  essas  habilidades  estavam 
adequadas para o mercado de trabalho. Além disso, observou-
se que essas habilidades prediziam em 79,1% a chance de um 
recém-formado ser contratado(9).

A comunicação acontece de maneira multimodal, por meio 
de recursos verbais, vocais e não verbais(9). Os recursos vocais 
são  relacionados  à  qualidade  e  dinâmica  vocal,  incluindo 
parâmetros  como  pitch,  loudness,  entonação,  acentuação, 
modulação, pausas, ritmo, entre outros. Os recursos verbais 
são a fala propriamente dita, uso de palavras e elaboração do 
discurso. Os recursos não verbais são a linguagem corporal, 
sendo complementados pelos recursos vocais e signos visuais 
de apoio(10,11).

Situações de comunicação como o falar em público, falar 
de  assuntos  que  não  domina  ou  de  conteúdos  emocionais 
relacionados ao lado pessoal são potencialmente propensos à 
manifestação de ansiedade nas pessoas. A ansiedade pode ocorrer 
frente a situações de mudanças, de experiências novas, e outras 
situações habituais do desenvolvimento humano. Porém, quando 
a ansiedade é muito intensa, ela pode gerar prejuízos na vida 
profissional, acadêmica e social das pessoas. As situações de 
exposição em público podem causar a ansiedade de desempenho, 
descrita como um estado de ansiedade que ocorre em condições 
particulares  e  pode  ser  considerada  como  uma  reação  a  um 
estímulo. É uma condição transitória e ocorre durante o confronto 
com um estímulo específico. Falar em público, atuar, cantar 
ou tocar um instrumento musical em público ou competir em 
eventos são exemplos de estímulos conhecidos(10).

Nesse contexto, o aumento da experiência e da capacidade de 
lidar com situações de falar em público pode suavizar os impactos 
negativos(1,3,8,12). Portanto, treinamentos que possibilitem essas 
experiências e o desenvolvimento de tais habilidades podem 
melhorar o desempenho nas apresentações e, consequentemente, 
minimizar as queixas.

A  programação  neurolinguística  (PNL)  embasada  nas 
Neurociências enfatiza que o comportamento humano se origina 
de processos neurológicos. A sua importância está no fato de 
que é um conjunto de habilidades baseadas nas características 
psicológicas dos seres humanos, por meio das quais os indivíduos 
obtêm a competência de usar suas capacidades pessoais tanto 
quanto possível(13). A PNL propõe a possibilidade de programar a 
ação das pessoas por meio do uso da linguagem, importando-se 
primariamente com a obtenção de resultados. Atua identificando 
os padrões das pessoas, alterando suas respostas aos estímulos e 
sua autorregulação. Além disso, apresenta técnicas que facilitam 
as apresentações orais, pois torna as atividades habituais e podem 
ser empregadas pelos estudantes(14).

Com base no exposto, o objetivo do presente estudo foi investigar 
o efeito de um programa de treinamento em voz e comunicação 
para apresentações orais em estudantes de Ensino Superior.

MÉTODO

Desenho do estudo e questões éticas

Trata-se de um estudo de intervenção, sendo que o projeto 
da pesquisa foi submetido e aprovado sob número de protocolo 
2.820.877 pelo Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa em Seres Humanos 
(CEP) da Faculdade de Odontologia de Bauru – Universidade 
de São Paulo - FOB/USP e todos os participantes assinaram o 
termo de consentimento livre e esclarecido (TCLE), conforme 
normas do CEP.

Participantes e local

Foi constituída uma amostra por conveniência de 38 estudantes 
de Ensino Superior de uma Universidade Pública do Estado de 
São Paulo, sendo 27 do sexo feminino e 11 do sexo masculino 
com a faixa etária média de 21,8 anos. Todos alunos do 1º ano 
de  Graduação  dos  cursos:  Fonoaudiologia  (n=20),  Medicina 
(n=15) e Odontologia (n=3).

Recrutamento e aplicação da ficha de cadastro inicial

Para recrutar os participantes, a pesquisa foi divulgada na 
própria universidade (murais, emails institucionais, site), assim 
como foram utilizadas divulgações nas redes sociais em perfis 
aos quais os alunos tivessem acesso. Foi disponibilizado um 
e-mail e telefone para contato aos interessados em participar 
da pesquisa. Aos que entraram em contato, foi disponibilizada 
uma ficha de cadastro composta pelos campos: dados pessoais, 
interesse e disponibilidade em participar da pesquisa com as 
informações  necessárias  sobre  sua  realização  e,  por  último, 
o participante tinha que relatar quais suas principais dificuldades 
nas  apresentações  orais  (como  seminários,  por  exemplo), 
conforme ficha de cadastro disponível no Anexo 1.

Para  selecionar  os  participantes,  foram  estabelecidos  os 
seguintes  critérios  de  inclusão:  cursar,  com  matrícula  ativa, 
o primeiro ano dos Cursos de Graduação na instituição de origem 
no ano de desenvolvimento da pesquisa; relatar dificuldades em 
usar recursos linguísticos e não linguísticos para se apresentar 
oralmente (dificuldade em falar em público devido ao nervosismo,

em se portar e/ou prender a atenção da plateia em apresentações 
orais, dificuldades de entonação de fala, articulação e/ou projeção 
vocal presentes apenas em momentos de apresentação oral); 
ter disponibilidade e aceitar participar de todas as atividades 
propostas. O critério de exclusão foi ter realizado algum curso 
de expressão oral ou Programação Neurolinguística – PNL(14). 
Foi entregue um termo de compromisso para os participantes 
com o calendário da pesquisa (pré-intervenção, intervenção e 
pós-intervenção) antes da coleta de dados iniciar, explicando a 
importância de não haver falta em nenhum dos encontros, dado o 
comprometimento que isso acarretaria nos resultados do estudo.

Coleta de dados

Avaliação

Avaliação dos juízes especialistas

A avaliação foi realizada por meio de uma ficha de avaliação 
denominada “Formulário de avaliação da apresentação oral - FAO” 
(Anexo 2), com base em uma apresentação oral sobre tópico da 
própria escolha em PowerPoint, previamente selecionada por cada 
participante, sendo o mesmo para os momentos de avaliação pré 
e pós-intervenção. Justifica-se a escolha do tema ser realizada 
pelo  participante  para  se  excluir  a  variável  conhecimento  e 
domínio técnico e observar a qualidade da apresentação oral. 
Cada participante teve três minutos para apresentação.

A calibração dos juízes foi realizada na semana prévia em 
conjunto, em reunião de treinamento com duração de três horas, 
na  qual  a  pesquisadora  apresentou  a  proposta  da  pesquisa  e 
foram discutidos todos os itens do formulário de avaliação e 
esclarecidas as dúvidas.

A avaliação foi realizada em dois momentos: uma semana 
antes do início do treinamento e uma semana após o final do 
treinamento, considerados como pré e pós-intervenção, com uso 
do FAO (Anexo 2), construído pelas pesquisadoras e explicado 
no item Instrumentos.

Para que a avaliação fosse de forma cega, foram convidados 
três juízes não autores do estudo. Dessa forma, a banca avaliadora 
foi formada por dois fonoaudiólogos, um especialista na área 
de linguagem (com vasta experiência na área de Linguística), 
outro especialista em voz e um psicólogo com experiência em 
habilidades sociais.

Autoavaliação

Também  foram  realizadas  filmagens  das  apresentações 
orais realizadas nos momentos de pré e pós-intervenção para 
a  autoavaliação. As  filmagens  foram  disponibilizadas  aos 
participantes do estudo para que pudessem assistir e julgar seu 
desempenho. Junto às filmagens, foi disponibilizado um formulário 
de autoavaliação, que possuía duas partes, as quais deveriam 
ser  preenchidas  em  momentos  diferentes. As  filmagens  do 
momento pré foram disponibilizadas uma semana após o primeiro 
encontro, e os participantes tiveram o prazo de duas semanas 
para  preencher  o  formulário  de  autoavaliação. As  filmagens 
do momento pós foram disponibilizadas uma semana após o 
último encontro, e os participantes também tiveram o prazo de 
duas semanas para o preenchimento.

Para considerar “melhora, piora ou neutralidade”, considerou-se 
o mesmo critério da avaliação dos juízes. As filmagens foram 
realizadas  com  o  equipamento  Handycam  Sony  Hdr-CX405 
HD, em full HD e disponibilizadas aos participantes via drive 
de compartilhamento. Cada participante tinha acesso apenas às 
suas próprias filmagens.

Instrumentos

Construção do formulário de Avaliação

O “Formulário de avaliação da apresentação oral - FAO” 
(Anexo 2) foi elaborado pelas pesquisadoras deste estudo antes 
do início da intervenção, baseado em protocolos de avaliação 
semelhantes(15). Foi necessária a elaboração desse formulário, 
pois não foram encontrados protocolos validados que avaliassem 
a performance de cada participante de acordo com a necessidade 
deste estudo no momento da revisão de literatura realizada. Tal 
fato se justifica uma vez que a análise da apresentação teria 
que  focar  os  itens  trabalhados  no  material  de  apoio  que  foi 
disponibilizado e trabalhado com os participantes da pesquisa.
O  mesmo  formulário  foi  utilizado  na  avaliação  pré  e 
pós-intervenção e os avaliadores não tiveram mais contato com o 
formulário da pré-intervenção no momento da pós-intervenção, 
para  que  não  houvesse  influência  de  uma  avaliação  sobre  a 
outra. O formulário apresenta duas partes, ambas com critérios 
qualitativos e quantitativos, dado que a ambos foram atribuídos 
valores numéricos na análise final (estatística), sendo:

Parte  I  –  em  que  constam  os  seguintes  aspectos  a  serem 
avaliados(1):  Critérios  linguísticos  (aspectos  formais  e 
informais)  e(2) Aspectos  complementares  à  comunicação 
(não-verbais).

Os componentes que compuseram os critérios linguísticos 
considerados  foram  Vocabulário,  Gramática,  Pronúncia, 
Entonação, Pausas, Média de Tempo da apresentação. Os aspectos 
complementares  à  comunicação  (não-verbais)  considerados 
foram Articulação,  Loudness,  Contato Visual,  Sorrir  quando 
apropriado, Postura Adequada, Manter a Audiência, Controle 
Emocional.  Para  esses,  o  critério  de  análise  era  uma  Escala 
Likert que variava de “Sempre” (ao qual de atribuía o valor 5), 
“Frequentemente” (valor 4), “As vezes” (valor 3), “Raramente” 
(valor 2) e “Nunca” (valor 1).

Parte II – em que constam os aspectos gerais da apresentação 
oral, aos quais foram atribuídas notas de 0 (zero) a 10 (dez), 
que foram Planejamento, Conteúdo, Abordagem, Organização, 
Recurso Visual, Forma de Apresentação, Controle Emocional, 
Linguagem, Avaliação  Geral.  O  critério  de  análise  era  a 
atribuição de uma nota de 0 (despreparado) a 10 (excelente).

Para ser considerada “melhora” o indivíduo deveria subir 
pelo menos um nível da escala de Likert na FAO e o mínimo 
de  um  ponto  na  nota,  comparando  pré  e  pós-intervenção  na 
Avaliação  Geral.  Para  considerar  “piora”  no  desempenho, 
deveria diminuir um nível na escala Likert e um ponto na nota 
e, para ser considerado neutro, deveria se manter na mesma 
pontuação, considerando a média dos juízes.

Construção do formulário de Autoavaliação

A primeira parte foi composta pela Escala para Autoavaliação 
ao Falar em Público (Anexo 3), adaptação do “Self Statements 
during Public Speaking Scale - SSPS”(16), que visa à autoavaliação 
dos aspectos cognitivos em situações que tenham como estressor 
o falar em público. A SSPS é um instrumento autoaplicável, 
composto de duas subescalas, a de autoavaliação positiva e a 
de autoavaliação negativa, cada qual com cinco itens pontuados 
numa escala de zero a cinco, de acordo com a descrição original 
da escala(16). Foi solicitado aos participantes que preenchessem a 
escala assim que terminassem de apresentar, pois era necessário 
que  o  estudante  colocasse  o  real  sentimento  diante  daquela 
situação, que é a de exposição em público.

A  escala  SSPS  possui  duas  subdivisões,  sendo  elas 
autoafirmações  positivas  (SSPS-P)  e  negativas  (SSPS-N). 
Os participantes deviam assinalar cada questão com a nota 
que  mais  se  identificassem,  indo  de  0  (discordo  totalmente 
com a afirmação) a 5 (concordo inteiramente com a afirmação. 
Os itens da SSPS vinculados a aspectos considerados positivos 
na  autoavaliação  são  os  numerados  1,  3,  5,  6  e  9;  os  itens 
considerados  negativos  são  os  itens  2,  4,  7,  8  e  10,  sendo, 

portanto, considerados dez itens na escala de autoavaliação 
(cinco de caráter positivo e cinco de caráter negativo).

A  segunda  parte  do  instrumento  de  autoavaliação  dessa 
pesquisa foi elaborada pelas pesquisadoras, com base na segunda 
parte do “FAO”, para que os participantes e juízes pudessem 
avaliar as mesmas variáveis. Os participantes deveriam responder 
essa  parte  julgando  seus  desempenhos  após  assistirem  suas 
próprias filmagens. As filmagens eram disponibilizadas a cada 
participante, sendo que cada um tinha contato apenas com a sua 
filmagem, não sendo disponibilizadas aos demais.

Intervenção

Etapa de elaboração

Foi elaborado um material de apoio realizado a partir de 
um  levantamento  bibliográfico,  sobre  comunicação  efetiva 
usando os recursos verbais, vocais e não verbais que utilizou 
como referencial teórico o treino das habilidades sociais(13,17,18), 
ferramentas da programação neurolinguística(14,19) e técnicas de 
projeção vocal e expressividade(8,15,17,20). O modelo taxonômico 
de treinamento de comunicação utilizado foi baseado (Figura 1) 
no modelo de taxonomia de terapia vocal de Van Stan et al.(21).

Inicialmente,  foi  realizado  um  estudo  piloto  com  um 
número reduzido de participantes diferentes da amostra atual 
dessa  pesquisa,  que  precedeu  esse  estudo(22),  para  que  fosse 
previamente testado o modelo de oferta da oficina e adaptação 
do material de apoio, como parte de um projeto de iniciação 
cientifica com fomento.

O  material  elaborado  pelas  autoras  foi  disponibilizado 
gratuitamente  para  os  participantes  em  formato  impresso  e 
também em formato ebook (em pdf), para que pudessem acessá-lo 
quando necessário ao longo do período de treinamento.

Implementação do programa de intervenção

A pesquisa foi realizada num período de oito semanas, sendo 

o horário viável a todos os participantes da pesquisa.

O programa de intervenção foi constituído por dez encontros 
com  conteúdos  teórico-práticos,  em  regime  semanal,  com 

duração  média  de  duas  horas  cada  encontro.  Contudo,  o 
primeiro encontro foi realizado um mês antes de a intervenção 
iniciar, para a explicação da pesquisa e assinatura dos termos 
de  consentimento.  O  último  encontro  foi  realizado  para  o 
feedback do desempenho aos participantes. O número total de 
encontros justifica-se para que os participantes concluíssem 
o treinamento dentro do tempo estipulado de um bimestre no 
Ensino Superior, e tendo como base também os resultados do 
estudo piloto mencionado e outros estudos de comunicação 
realizados(1-3)

O  local  de  realização  foi  uma  das  salas  de  aula  da 
universidade, constituída por um espaço amplo, com lugares 
para até 50 alunos, cadeiras móveis permitindo uso variável, 
dependendo  das  dinâmicas  realizadas  no  treinamento. 
O detalhamento do programa de intervenção está disponível 
no Quadro 1.

Ficha com os resultados individuais para que 
cada participante pudesse ver sua evolução.

Analise de dados

A  análise  estatística  foi  realizada  de  forma  descritiva  e 
inferencial. Utilizou-se o Statistic 10.0. Foi aplicado o teste 
de  normalidade  e,  pela  grande  maioria  das  variáveis  não 
ter  apresentado  distribuição  normal,  foi  utilizado  o  teste 
não-paramétrico, Teste de Wilcoxon. O nível de significância 
adotado para os resultados deste estudo serem considerados 
significantes foi de p≤0,05%.

RESULTADOS

A seguir serão descritos os resultados dos 38 participantes 
considerados  na  análise  de  dados.  Só  foram  considerados 
os  dados  dos  participantes  que  cumpriram  o  treinamento  na 
totalidade, sem faltas (100% de presença). Embora no início, 
houvesse 42 inscritos, 4 (9,5%) deles realizaram o treinamento, 
mas tiveram os dados desconsiderados por terem uma ou duas 
faltas durante o período da intervenção.

Avaliação dos juízes

Os resultados a seguir ilustram a avaliação realizada pelos 
juízes, comparando a análise pré e pós-intervenção. A Tabela 1 
é a comparação dos componentes qualitativos, considerando a 
escala Likert.

Na Tabela 1 fica evidente pelo valor das médias na pré e 
pós-intervenção que os juízes avaliaram uma melhora significativa 
dos participantes em todos os itens analisados. Os itens contato 
visual  (média  de  2,26  na  pré  e  3,55  na  pós),  sorrir  quando 

apropriado (média de 2,26 na pré e 3,79 na pós-intervenção) 
e postura adequada durante a apresentação (média de 2,21 na 
pré  e  3,79  na  pós-intervenção)  foram  os  três  itens  de  maior 
impacto, sendo valor de p<0,001 (estatisticamente significante) 
em todos os itens.

A  Tabela  2  apresenta  a  comparação  dos  componentes 
quantitativos. Desses, os itens com maior média de melhoria, 
segundo os juízes, em suas avaliações pré e pós-intervenção 
foram a abordagem (média de 7,35 na pré para 9,28 na pós), 
organização  da  apresentação  (média  de  7,73  na  pré  para 
9,44  na  pós),  linguagem  utilizada  (média  de  7,58  na  pré  e 
9,31  na  pós)  e  forma  de  apresentar  (média  de  7,11  na  pré 
e  9,07  na  pós-intervenção),  sendo  valores  estatisticamente 
significantes (p<0,001) na totalidade dos itens.

Autoavaliação

As queixas mais frequentes dos participantes do estudo em 
relação a falar em público foram: nervosismo (76%), insegurança 
(74%),  ansiedade  (68%),  não  conseguir  transmitir/expressar 
o  que  quer  falar  (63%),  medo  de  esquecer  ou  errar  (60%). 
Na sequência vieram: timidez (53%), saber qual melhor postura 
(53%), vergonha de falar em público (50%), falar com clareza 
(50%), projetar corretamente a voz (42%), e outros (8%).

Os resultados apresentados na Tabela 3 demostraram um 
aumento significativo da pontuação no escore, comparando o 
pré e o pós-treinamento da subescala SSPS-P e uma redução 
significativa nos escores pré e pós da subescala SSPS-N, sendo 
p<0,001 para ambas. Isso ressalta que, na autoavaliação, mais 
do  que  o  aumento  da  média  das  autoafirmativas  positivas

6/14

(média de 15,9 na pré-intervenção e 20,9 na pós-intervenção) 
foi a diminuição da média das autoafirmações negativas que 
mais  chamou  a  atenção  (média  de  10,6  na  pré-intervenção 
para 6,3 na pós-intervenção). Houve também um aumento na 
porcentagem das autoafirmações positivas que passou de 44% 
para 68%, bem como diminuição das negativas de 56% para 
32% na pós-intervenção.

A Tabela 4 mostra os resultados obtidos na pré e na pós-intervenção 
na autoavaliação de caráter quantitativo. Esses valores demonstram 

que  os  valores  atribuídos  na  pós-intervenção  foram  maiores 
que  na  pré-intervenção,  obtendo  diferenças  estatisticamente 
significativas em todos os itens (valores de p<0,001), mas com 
médias  melhores  expressivamente  nos  itens  organização  da 
apresentação (média de 6,19 na pré para 8,06 na pós), linguagem 
utilizada (média de 6,03 na pré e 8,11 na pós), recursos visuais 
utilizados  (média  de  6,71  na  pré  e  8,53  na  pós-intervenção), 
controle emocional (média de 5,17 na pré para 7,77 na pós) e na 
avaliação geral (média de 6,27 na pré para 8,30 na pós-intervenção).

DISCUSSÃO

O programa de treinamento proposto foi efetivo para melhorar 
as habilidades de comunicação em estudantes universitários. 
Houve melhora em todas as variáveis mensuradas relacionadas 
aos recursos verbais e não verbais após o treinamento tanto na 
avaliação dos juízes quanto na autopercepção dos estudantes. 
Importante notar que, dos aspectos qualitativos analisados pelos 
juízes, a melhoria mais ressaltada foi a de contato visual, sorrir 
quando apropriado e postura adequada durante a apresentação. 
Quanto aos aspectos quantitativos, foram à abordagem, organização 
da apresentação, a linguagem utilizada e a forma de apresentar 
dos participantes.

Embora  a  melhoria  mais  acentuada  percebida  pelos 
estudantes em suas autoavaliações tenha coincidido, em termos 
qualitativos, com a avaliação dos juízes nos itens organização da 
apresentação e linguagem, grande parte desses estudantes teve 
uma percepção maior na própria melhora do controle emocional 
e em sua avaliação geral (que inclui a clareza da mensagem, se 
alcançou os objetivos, se foi interessante, agradável/ informativo 
ou  instigante).  Pesquisas  anteriores  também  afirmam  que  os 
aspectos anteriormente citados tanto pelos juízes quanto pelos 
participantes do estudo aqui relatados são complementares, ou 
seja, as emoções habituais influenciam na expressão facial, na 
voz e na postura corporal(9,10).

O  presente  estudo  trouxe  técnicas  e  ferramentas  de 
diferentes áreas(13,14,18,19,23-25) integradas em um material didático 
previamente  elaborado,  que  serviu  tanto  para  a  elaboração 
do treinamento quanto como material de apoio para instruir 
o uso dos recursos linguísticos nas apresentações orais, em 
alunos de ensino superior. Especificamente sobre a postura 
corporal e a expressão facial, no estudo aqui apresentado esses 
foram  dois  itens  avaliados  tanto  pelos  juízes  quanto  pelos 
participantes  como  itens  com  melhora  acentuada,  dado  os 
valores de médias alcançados, expressados pela aumento no 
contato visual, no uso de sorriso em momentos adequados da 
apresentação e a postura corporal mantida durante a mesma, 
quando comparados os momentos de avaliação antes e após o 
treinamento aqui descrito, o que confirma achados em estudos 
e trabalhos similares das áreas relacionadas a treinamentos de 
comunicação(9,13,14,19).

Ao se trabalhar com a comunicação humana, a emoção é 
um dos fatores importantes para transmitir a intenção de forma 
convincente.  Dessa  forma,  é  uma  parte  importante  de  uma 

comunicação humana natural e espontânea. A literatura(11,19,23) 
demonstra  que,  durante  a  comunicação,  a  emoção  pode  ser 
expressa  tanto  de  forma  consciente  como  inconsciente,  por 
meio  de  aspectos  como  o  próprio  enunciado  linguístico(6), 
características paralinguísticas ou características vocais(20). Esse 
dado se confirma no estudo aqui apresentado mais especificamente 
na autoavaliação dos participantes, os quais citam aumento em 
seu controle emocional, quando comparadas as medias antes 
e após o treinamento.

Essa  autoavaliação  positiva  do  aspecto  emocional  dos 
participantes é importante e significativa, dado que as queixas 
mais frequentes dos participantes do estudo antes de iniciar a 
intervenção e que pautaram a decisão para se inscreverem e 
participarem do treinamento foram exatamente o nervosismo, 
insegurança, ansiedade e não conseguir transmitir/expressar o 
que quer falar. Conforme estudo anterior(8), essas queixas podem 
ser decorrentes de falta de prática ao falar, domínio insuficiente 
do tópico e autoimagem negativa, sendo a falta de experiência 
o fator mais importante(1,23), o que fez com que o treinamento 
aqui proposto alcançasse resultados positivos.

Ainda  sobre  a  autoimagem,  na  autoavaliação  realizada 
pelos participantes e evidenciada por um dos instrumentos(4), as 
autoafirmações  positivas  tiveram  um  acréscimo  significativo. 
As autoafirmações negativas em relação às suas apresentações 
tiveram  um  decréscimo  também  significativo,  reforçando  os 
resultados  de  estudos(7,8,22). Aponta-se  nesses  estudos  que  a 
autoimagem  negativa  impacta  as  apresentações  orais  e  que, 
quando o indivíduo se sente preparado, essa autoimagem tende 
a melhorar.

Dada essa consideração em relação a autoimagem de um bom 
comunicador, optou-se por seguir os pressupostos da Programação 
Neurolinguística – PNL(13,14,19) como uma das ferramentas para 
elaborar o material didático e o treinamento, além de propor 
exercitar  também  a  mudança  de  estado  mental(18,19,26),  pelo 
trabalho  direcionado  às  habilidades  sociais,  trazendo  maior 
segurança e encorajamento na hora da apresentação.

Para que a mudança de estado mental fosse possível(19,26), no 
treinamento proposto, os participantes tiveram uma parte teórica 
sobre como uma apresentação deve ser elaborada para diferentes 
tipos de público e a importância da abrangência de todos. Esse 
conceito foi posteriormente denominado na avaliação, assim 
como em estudos similares(3,12,27), como “fazer contato de olhos 
com todos os presentes”, “capacidade de manter o interesse da 
audiência” e também foi considerado dentro do critério “geral”.

Tais  aspectos  tiveram  similar  avaliação  quanto  à  melhora 
na  pós-intervenção  tanto  pelos  juízes  quanto  pelos  próprios 
participantes, sendo itens com as mudanças mais significativas, 
como  os  resultados  obtidos  nas  pesquisas  com  populações 
similares mostram(3,12,27).

No treinamento, as habilidades comunicativas foram trabalhadas 
por  meio  de  atividades  práticas,  nas  quais  os  participantes 
realizaram exercícios vocais e corporais, dadas as relações entre 
voz e competência comunicativa demonstradas em trabalhos da 
área(17,20,23). Essas atividades simularam situações de exposição 
oral com treinamento de projeção vocal, pausas, postura, gestos, 
e outras habilidades linguísticas e comunicativas, como sugerido 
na literatura(3,12,16,20,23,24,27-29).

Acredita-se que a melhora nos aspectos como articulação, 
loudness, entonação, pausas e da média de tempo de apresentação 
alcançados no treinamento aqui proposto deve-se à utilização 
de técnicas vocais específicas que tem como objetivos, segundo 
trabalhos da área de voz(17,20), melhorar o padrão articulatório, 
favorecer a projeção vocal, suavizar a emissão e, ainda(24,28,29), 
melhorar a coordenação pneumofonoarticulatória e promover 
maior equilíbrio da produção vocal.

Essas  habilidades  (articulação,  loudness,  contato  visual, 
sorrir quando apropriado, postura adequada, manter a audiência, 
entonação e pausas) integram a expressividade(30), sendo que 
o trabalho conjunto com todas essas variáveis possibilita uma 
comunicação adequada ao contexto e ao discurso. Além disso, 
possibilita aprimorar a autopercepção sobre si mesmo e sobre 
a  comunicação  do  falante,  o  que  é  corroborado  em  estudos 
não  somente  com  populações  similares  como  estudantes 
universitários(3,12,27),  mas  com  outras  populações,  inclusive 
envolvendo outros profissionais(1,2,7,20).

A melhora no vocabulário, na gramática e no uso de pronomes 
pelos participantes do estudo pode ter ocorrido pelo conteúdo 
sobre a linguagem abordado no primeiro e último capítulos do 
material teórico-prático preparado para o treinamento. O material 
orientava sobre a forma de falar, escolha de palavras, regência, 
para que os estudantes atentassem a esses aspectos na hora de 
uma apresentação oral.

Abordar  a  relação  entre  todos  os  aspectos  envolvidos 
na  comunicação,  como  a  linguagem,  a  voz,  a  competência 
comunicativa em si, os gêneros linguísticos e não-linguísticos 
utilizados no processo de se comunicar, assim como enfocar as 
próprias habilidades sociais(2,6,13,17,18,20) como comportamentos 
que se podem observar e mensurar, permite uma visão mais 
global do falante sobre seu desempenho. Retira o foco apenas 
de questões emocionais ligadas inicialmente pelos participantes 
como o medo e a ansiedade por falar em público(1,8,11,16,23,30).

A  autoavaliação  inserida  no  estudo  trouxe  resultados 
importantes, com várias implicações positivas para o indivíduo, 
como  apontado  em  estudos  similares(1,3,7,22),  pois  facilita  a 
autorregulação,  fornece  uma  sensação  de  auto  continuidade, 
acelera  o  processamento  de  informações  relevantes,  auxilia 
no  estabelecimento  de  metas,  influencia  a  percepção  social, 
e contribui para a projeção de uma autoimagem consistente e 
desejável para os outros(3).

A  melhoria  indicada  pelos  participantes  dessa  pesquisa 
nos  aspectos  de  “Planejamento”,  “Objetivos”,  “Conteúdo”, 

“Abordagem”,  “Organização”  e  “Recursos  visuais”  de  suas 
autoavaliações, seja devido ao que foi abordado no treinamento 
sobre como estruturar uma pesquisa e uma apresentação (utilizando 
conceitos básicos de metodologia de pesquisa e design), seja na 
ênfase dada à uma preparação teórica e prática da apresentação, 
confirmou estudos que mostram que essa prévia preparação sobre 
o tema - como domínio do assunto, a coerência, o embasamento 
científico e a forma de conduzir a apresentação - pode diminuir 
até 75% o medo de falar em público.

O conhecimento do conteúdo afeta diretamente o estilo como 
ele é conduzido pelo apresentador, podendo demonstrar maior ou 
menor grau de segurança e manejo crítico do conteúdo, de forma a 
envolver a audiência, conforme afirmam trabalhos anteriores(25,30).
Outro aspecto a ser discutido é a Escala para Autoavaliação 
ao  Falar  em  Público  (SSPS),  pois  uma  das  limitações  desse 
estudo  foi  o  fato  de  não  serem  encontrados  questionários 
validados que contemplassem os itens necessários para avaliar 
a performance dos participantes de acordo com a necessidade 
do estudo, portanto a escala SSPS foi traduzida e adaptada às 
necessidades da pesquisa.

Quanto aos resultados de aplicação da escala, analisando 
os seus escores, evidencia-se que, ao aumentar a pontuação da 
subescala SSPS-P (auto afirmativas positivas) e, ao diminuir 
a da SSPS-N (auto afirmativas negativas), os participantes se 
tornaram mais autoconfiantes e capazes de enfrentar a situação 
de exposição em público e também demostraram estar menos 
ansiosos, mais autoconfiantes e preparados ao passarem pelo 
treinamento de comunicação.

Estudos(4,19) que utilizaram a mesma escala ressaltam que 
as  autoafirmações  negativas  podem  estar  mais  intimamente 
associadas à ansiedade de falar em público do que as positivas. 
Isso pode apontar que os participantes, ao pontuarem menos 
as  autoafirmações  negativas,  tornam-se  menos  propensos  a 
reafirmar ou aumentar sua ansiedade ao falar em público e até 
mesmo desenvolver uma fobia social ou transtornos de ansiedade 
relacionados à isso. Estudos na área(8,12-14,19,22,23,26) mostram que 
treinamentos de exposição em público e de comunicação, assim 
como técnicas cognitivas-comportamentais e treinamento em 
habilidades sociais são eficazes para o tratamento da fobia social 
relacionada ao medo de falar em público.

Em  um  estudo(27)  que  tinha  como  objetivo  analisar  uma 
intervenção fonoaudiológica junto a estudantes universitários 
em  situações  de  apresentações  de  seminários,  os  resultados 
encontrados  mostraram  efeitos  positivos  da  intervenção  nos 
aspectos  orais,  além  de  melhora  na  percepção  de  segurança 
relatadas pelos participantes quando conseguiam atingir melhor 
suas plateias. As fonoaudiólogas avaliadoras do estudo citado 
perceberam  avanços  quanto  aos  aspectos  orais,  corporais  e 
interacionais. Assim,  os  resultados  gerais  da  pesquisa  aqui 
apresentada  corroboram  os  achados  desse  estudo(27)  e  abrem 
uma  reflexão  sobre  o  porquê  desse  medo  ainda  ser  um  dos 
mais prevalentes entre os universitários. Não seria papel das 
universidades prepararem os alunos para tal atividade?

A cada ano, milhares de estudantes são admitidos nas universidades 
em busca de uma profissão e, no decorrer dos anos de formação, 
encontram  tarefas  que  demandam  crescimento  intelectual  e 
aprimoramento de habilidades, tais como a de falar em público.

Se uma Instituição de Ensino Superior entende que é preciso 
preparar seus alunos para se comunicarem com eficiência em 
seus futuros ambientes de atuação profissional(1-3), cabe refletir 
sobre como tem procedido quanto a essa formação.

Programas  de  intervenção  sobre  oratória  e  melhora  do 
desempenho  da  comunicação  oral  não  deveriam  integrar  o 
currículo de formação profissional? A formação de profissionais 
para  o  mercado  de  trabalho  deveria  privilegiar  o  ensino  de 
competências e habilidades para além dos conteúdos técnicos 
de determinada profissão. É necessário que as universidades 
proporcionem condições para que o aluno possa conhecer, além 
do conteúdo da profissão, as exigências comportamentais da 
função escolhida(18).

O presente estudo teve um limitador por ter sido realizado 
com estudante universitários de uma única instituição de ensino 
(embora de três cursos de graduação diferentes), mas como seus 
participantes melhoraram seu desempenho em todos os aspectos 
analisados após passarem pela intervenção, demonstrou-se a 
aplicabilidade  do  treinamento  proposto  enquanto  ferramenta 
auxiliar no planejamento e aprimoramento de treinamentos de 
comunicação para tal população. Portanto, fica aqui a contribuição 
dessa pesquisa para que sejam propostos por fonoaudiólogos 
nas  universidades  programas  de  treinamento  e  consultoria 
fonoaudiológica na área, sendo esse um campo promissor de 
atuação profissional.

Sugerem-se estudos similares que utilizem o treinamento 
aqui proposto e sejam desenvolvidos em outras instituições de 
Ensino Superior, para que esse estudo contribua para o ensino 
de  competências  e  habilidades  além  dos  conteúdos  técnicos 
dentro das universidades. Acredita-se também que o material 
elaborado  possa  integrar  conteúdo  de  disciplinas  em  várias 
universidades e ser um suporte para os universitários na área 
de comunicação.

CONCLUSÃO

O programa de treinamento proposto foi efetivo para melhorar 
as habilidades de comunicação de estudantes universitários em 
apresentações orais. Houve melhora - tanto da perspectiva dos 
juízes avaliadores quanto da dos próprios participantes - nas 
habilidades  relacionadas  aos  recursos  verbais  e  não  verbais 
utilizados, nos aspectos qualitativos como contato visual, sorrir 
quando apropriado e postura adequada durante a apresentação, 
bem  como  nos  aspectos  quantitativos  como  organização  da 
apresentação, a linguagem utilizada e o uso de recursos visuais.
Na  autoavaliação,  os  estudantes  participantes  do  estudo 
também relataram melhoria do controle emocional durante as 
apresentações orais e em suas avaliações gerais após o treinamento. 
que inclui a clareza da mensagem, se esta alcançou os objetivos, 
se foi interessante, agradável/ informativo ou instigante.
