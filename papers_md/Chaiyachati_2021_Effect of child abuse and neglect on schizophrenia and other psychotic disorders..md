Abstract

Childhood experiences impact long-term physical and behavioral health outcomes including 
conveying risk for schizophrenia and psychosis. Negative experiences, such as child abuse and 
neglect, have been specifically associated with risk for schizophrenia and psychosis. This review 
provides a brief overview of child abuse and neglect, including its position within larger field of 
trauma and adversity and its long term consequences. The link to schizophrenia is then explored. 
Principles of treatment and outcomes for schizophrenia with antecedent child abuse and neglect 
are then reviewed. Finally, next steps and points of prevention are highlighted.

1.  Child Maltreatment

1.1.  Scale of the Issue

Child maltreatment including all forms of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse as well as 
neglect is a persistent and significant risk to the health and well-being of children. Child 
welfare numbers indicate that more than 3 million children had an investigation or response 
related to concerns for maltreatment in each recent year in the U.S. (US DHHA AFC 2018). 
Of these reports, more than 600,000 children were substantiated as victims of maltreatment 
with an associated fatality rate of 2.39 per 100,000 in 2018 (US DHHS AFC 2018). Child 
welfare involvement, including removal from a care environment, does not immediately 
abate impacts on health and well-being as children in foster care in the U.S. experience 
much higher risk of all-cause mortality than children in the general population (Chaiyachati, 
Wood et al. 2020).

That childhood experiences of abuse and neglect can impact health is an accepted truth. The scope of these impacts, both direct and 
indirect, immediate and long-term, continue to be clarified through interdisciplinary assessment.

Risks of childhood maltreatment are not isolated to the U.S. Literature converges on the 
global struggle for uniformly safe experiences in childhood. Data from the World Health 
Organization world mental health survey document a global population report rate by 
adults of 8.0% for physical abuse, 1.6% for sexual abuse, and 4.4% for neglect (Kessler, 
McLaughlin et al. 2010). Yet, precision of estimates of global numbers of maltreatment 
may be limited given cultural influences on specific definitions of maltreatment and wide 
variance in reporting mandates across international jurisdictions (Daro 2008). For example, 
when separated by continent, international estimates based on self-report place median 
prevalence of sexual abuse among girls between 9.0% in Asia and 28.8% in Australia while 
self-reported experiences of neglect range in median prevalence from 14.8% in Europe to 
56.7% in South America for boys and 13.9% in Europe to 54.8% in South America for girls 
(Moody, Cannings-John et al. 2018).

1.2.  Exposure Definitions

Beyond the cultural and jurisdictional variations that impact the counting of child 
maltreatment, clinical and research definitions of child maltreatment vary widely and are 
sometimes used interchangeably with umbrella terms such as trauma or adversity. While 
examples of trauma and adversity have definite overlap, they also hold unique positions in 
clinical and research realms – and in relation to child abuse and neglect.

Trauma results “from an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced 
by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting 
adverse effects on the individual’s functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional, or 
spiritual well-being” (SAMSHA 2014). The modern conception of trauma in behavioral 
health began when Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was formally entered the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition, in 1980 (Kawa and 
Giordano 2012). The official diagnostic advent of PTSD recognized the indirect or persistent 
impacts of trauma as had been described after experiences of severe trauma, mostly war, 
throughout historical texts and previous diagnostic manuals (Benedek and Ursano 2009). 
In subsequent years, the definition of the requisite inciting trauma evolved rapidly in both 
research and clinical venues with movement toward broader definition, encompassing more 
remote experiences, such as child maltreatment, as sufficient for PTSD trigger (Andreasen 
2010).

The concept of adversity became routine within the medical lexicon after the landmark study 
of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in 1998 (Felitti, Anda et al. 1998). Adversities 
tabulated by Felitti included psychologic, physical and sexual abuse, household dysfunction 
through mental illness, substance use, intimate partner violence, and incarceration. Their key 
finding, a dose-response association between ACE count and poor adult health outcomes, 
underscored an association between adverse exposures and physical health relevant to public 
health inquiries and interventions. Subsequent decades of work have continued to put into 
relief the significant, multifaceted, and varied impacts of adversity on long-term well-being 
and physical health (Hughes, Bellis et al. 2017). Consistent with the initial survey, many 
studies of adversity include direct recount of experiences of child abuse and neglect though

variations have also arisen, including methods to assess ACEs in children and adolescents, 
that do not include direct measures of maltreatment (Bethell, Carle et al. 2017).

Overall, child abuse and neglect are adverse experiences and are predominantly viewed 
as trauma across clinical and research realms. However, there are traumatic and adverse 
experiences that do not, in isolation, comprise child abuse and neglect. Thus, care should be 
taken when describing the impacts of child abuse and neglect based upon broader trauma 
and adversity literature to clarify composite versus specific associations. For example, 
one widely used questionnaire to assess childhood experiences of abuse and neglect, the 
Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), is exclusively comprised of domains of abuse 
and neglect while other broadly used, similarly named questionnaires such as the Trauma 
History Questionnaire, include questions across domains of trauma including crime and 
natural disasters (Bernstein, Fink et al. 1998, Hooper, Stockton et al. 2011). Yet, as above, 
the themes hold true across many measures of adversity, trauma, and maltreatment – when 
we fail to keep children safe and support their well-being, they are at risk for both immediate 
and long-term harm.

1.3.  General Outcomes associated with Child Maltreatment

While the focus of this review is upon the associations between psychosis and experiences 
of child maltreatment, this must be placed in context of other known, concurrently 
conveyed risks from experiences of child abuse and neglect including physical health and 
non-psychotic impacts within behavioral health.

1.3.1.  Physical Health—The connections between experiences of abuse and neglect 
and physical health are multifaceted. There are at least four general areas of connection to 
consider. First, physical health impacts from child abuse and neglect can include immediate 
and direct injuries. For example, approximately one-quarter of bone fractures in the first 
year of life are related to child abuse (Flaherty, Perez-Rossello et al. 2014). Second, physical 
health may additionally be compromised by insufficient access to routine medical care or 
well-child care. Evaluation of physical health of children at entrance to child welfare system 
demonstrate high rates of unmet health needs (Szilagyi, Rosen et al. 2015). Compounding 
the direct risks of missed medical care, inadequate or inconsistent well care may result 
in missed opportunities for early detection and prevention of disease, such as within the 
premorbid or prodromal phases of psychosis (Seidman and Nordentoft 2015). Third, by 
meta-analysis and systematic review, a causal relationship has been suggested between 
experiences of child maltreatment and some behavior changes that may impact physical 
health such as high risk sexual behaviors (Norman, Byambaa et al. 2012). Finally, as 
measured within ACE questionnaires, child abuse and neglect have been shown to be 
associated with a broad range of long-term poor physical health associations (Felitti, Anda 
et al. 1998, Hughes, Bellis et al. 2017, Zarse, Neff et al. 2019). Moreover, chronic ACEs 
associate with cumulative derailment of health trajectory, consistent with dose-response 
effect (Thompson, Flaherty et al. 2015).

1.3.2.  Non-psychotic psychopathology—There are widely cited connections 
between experiences of childhood abuse and neglect and psychopathology (Norman,

Byambaa et al. 2012, Gardner, Thomas et al. 2019, Carr, Duff et al. 2020, Humphreys, 
LeMoult et al. 2020). With regard to affective disorders, single study estimates support that 
a history of reported abuse or neglect may increase risk of depression by three- to four-fold 
and meta-analysis affirms connection between childhood maltreatment as measured by CTQ 
and depression diagnosis (Brown, Cohen et al. 1999, Humphreys, LeMoult et al. 2020). 
Child maltreatment is also associated with severe course of depression including treatment 
resistance (Nelson, Klumparendt et al. 2017). Similarly, several forms of child maltreatment 
have been found to be associated with anxiety by meta-analysis (Gardner, Thomas et al. 
2019). Finally, as penultimate marker of emotional health, experiences of physical or sexual 
abuse are significantly associated with increased risk of suicidality in adolescents and adults 
(Evans, Hawton et al. 2005, Angelakis, Gillespie et al. 2019).

1.3.3.  Environmental Risks—Any individual or family outcome happens within an 
environmental milieu of risk and protection. Many studies have attempted to assess 
predictors to child abuse and neglect in efforts to target prevention. Family risk factors that 
have been shown to be associated with abuse and neglect include poverty and dysfunctional 
parent-child attachment (Stith, Liu et al. 2009, Pelton 2015). These environmental 
disruptions have also been found to be associated with schizophrenia (Cannon, Caspi et 
al. 2002, Faust and Stewart 2008, Hakulinen, McGrath et al. 2019).

Individual experiences of abuse and neglect have also been associated with multiple 
behavioral and social risks, some of which have been separately associated with psychosis. 
Literature has repeatedly demonstrated an association between child abuse and neglect 
with a range of risk behavior uptake including substance use, even suggesting causality by 
meta-analysis and systematic review (Norman, Byambaa et al. 2012, Carliner, Keyes et al. 
2016). History of childhood abuse has also been expressly associated with younger age of 
onset of alcohol use disorder (Schuckher, Sellin et al. 2018). Among adolescents with child 
welfare involvement, history of physical abuse and out-of-home placement has been found 
to be associated with polysubstance use (Snyder and Smith 2015).

2.  Psychosis Spectrum after Child Abuse and Neglect

2.1.  Schizophrenia after Child Abuse and Neglect

Studies have long supported associations between adverse childhood experiences and 
schizophrenia. A systematic review completed in 2012 synthesized the association between 
schizophrenia and childhood experiences of abuse and adversities and posited that sum risk 
associated with adversity accounted for 33% overall population likelihood for schizophrenia 
(Varese, Smeets et al. 2012). That analysis documented a significantly increased odds of 
schizophrenia for each category of child maltreatment assessed: sexual abuse OR 2.38 
(1.98–2.87), physical abuse OR 2.95 (2.25–3.88), emotional abuse OR 3.40 (2.06–5.62). 
A subsequent review assessing self-report of childhood experiences among those with 
schizophrenia demonstrated 26% with childhood sexual abuse, 39% with childhood physical 
abuse, and 34% with childhood emotional abuse (Bonoldi, Simeone et al. 2013). Further 
work has shown that interviewer and self-report of child abuse have high rate of agreement, 
an important point of confirmation in triangulating the assessment of objectively conferred

risk versus experience as coded within individual schema (Negriff, Schneiderman et al. 
2017).

Antecedent trauma may impact the presentation of schizophrenia in multiple ways. 
Generally, across populations, history of child abuse may impact overall health, well-being, 
and co-morbid diagnoses (see Section 1.3). Inconsistent caregiver relationships related to 
disrupted family dynamics or placement instability of foster care may lend particular risk 
to delayed recognition of premorbid phenotypes and early behavior changes. Moreover, 
disrupted family relationships may lead to only partial or completely unknown family 
history, which may otherwise support clinical diagnosis.

In addition to the association of childhood maltreatment with risk for and diagnosis of 
schizophrenia, it has also been shown that history of child maltreatment may be associated 
with overall worse outcomes after diagnosis (Thomas, Hofler et al. 2019). Studies have 
documented increased likelihood of early establishment of treatment-resistant schizophrenia 
(TRS) as well as worsened trajectory during chronic disease (Davidson, Shannon et al. 2009, 
Misiak and Frydecka 2016). Age at exposure to trauma has also been shown to differentiate 
course of symptoms after diagnosis of schizophrenia, with earlier trauma associated with 
more negative outcomes (Alameda, Golay et al. 2016).

2.2.  Schizophrenia Comorbidities

Schizophrenia has a shared clinical presentation and broad range of comorbidity with other 
diagnoses. For example, estimates of comorbidity for schizophrenia and PTSD range from 
0 to 57% (Seow, Ong et al. 2016). The known comorbid trends, overlapping history, 
predisposing factors, and clinical features complicate disentangling separate diagnoses. 
The clinical intersection has been particularly elucidated in persons returning from war 
(OConghaile and DeLisi 2015). Such common comorbidities contribute to the complexities 
of elucidating the specificity of findings to schizophrenia.

The growing focus on a dimensional approach to psychopathology further supports 
the commonalities of psychotic symptoms across diagnostic categories. Of relevance, 
experiences of trauma, including child abuse and neglect, have been shown to be predictive 
of the broader category of psychotic experiences, beyond schizophrenia. For example, 
international work has demonstrated associations between trauma exposures, including child 
abuse and neglect, and psychotic experiences (McGrath, McLaughlin et al. 2017, McGrath, 
Saha et al. 2017).

Relatedly, the psychosis spectrum includes a range of subthreshold experiences and 
symptoms that may, or may not, be prodromal to schizophrenia. Early identification 
of subthreshold symptoms including clinical high or ultra-high risk may facilitate early 
intervention and abatement of symptom progression. A meta-analysis highlighted that 
individuals at clinical high risk for schizophrenia reported significantly more episodes of 
all types of abuse and neglect than controls (Peh, Rapisarda et al. 2019). Notably, within the 
populations of clinical high risk patients, childhood abuse and neglect was not significantly 
associated with transition to psychosis within the captured follow-up periods (6 months to 
15 years).

3.  Mechanisms

Page 6

Multiple complex and interacting factors contribute to the presentation of schizophrenia in 
late adolescence and early adulthood. Progress in genomics and other omics, quantitation 
of environmental measures across early development, and methods for the study of brain - 
behavior offer critical tools for dissecting the complexities. Understanding the importance 
and interrelatedness of the total exposures, or the “exposome”, in mental health, including 
psychosis, is paramount. Figure 1 provides a schematic presentation of the pathway to 
psychosis. The specific role of childhood adversity as an “Environmental Hit” is central in 
our efforts at early identification of factors that increase risk for psychosis as well as for 
early intervention in disease course.

3.1.  Embedding of Trauma

Overall, the broad impacts of child abuse and neglect on psychotic and non-psychotic 
behavioral health outcomes imply the presence of transdiagnostic risk mechanisms 
connecting experiences of abuse and neglect with behavioral health disruptions. One such 
proposed connection is the development of altered threat processing as a transdiagnostic 
vulnerability after experiences of child abuse and neglect (McLaughlin and Lambert 2017).

Studies of neurocognition and neuroimaging specifically connecting schizophrenia and 
clinical risk for psychosis with adversity, trauma, and child abuse have expanded over 
the past decade. The general approach has been to compare individuals with a history of 
childhood adversity to those without such a history, as well as to healthy controls. With 
regard to neurocognition, while sample sizes vary, overall results suggest that individuals 
with schizophrenia and risk for psychosis with a history of childhood adversity, including 
child abuse, show more cognitive impairment than healthy comparators as well as affected 
individuals without reported childhood adversity (Wells, Jacomb et al. 2020). Interestingly, 
impacts on social cognition domain, including emotion processing, have been shown to 
be more strongly associated with experiences of maltreatment than with schizophrenia 
diagnoses (Kilian, Asmal et al. 2018, Tognin, Catalan et al. 2020).

Reported burden of childhood adversity has been found to be associated with brain structure 
and function, including measures of psychosis symptoms (Gur, Moore et al. 2019). Brain 
regions related to social cognition have been specifically examined, suggesting that reduced 
anterior cingulate cortex volume is associated with poorer performance in a social cognition 
measure across the sample of healthy participants and individuals with schizophrenia 
(Rokita, Holleran et al. 2020).

Underpinning differences in neurocognition and neuroimaging and changes in basic biologic 
functions have also been seen connecting schizophrenia with abuse and neglect. For 
example, child abuse and neglect is a moderating factor in the pattern of cortisol reactivity 
in those with schizophrenia (Quide, Girshkin et al. 2020). Additional hypotheses such as 
altered expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have arisen from animal 
models (Popovic, Schmitt et al. 2019). While the overall trends are promising, results 
connecting disease measures and brain-behavior parameters with childhood adversity are 
heterogeneous and additional work is needed to clarify the emerging findings.

3.2.  Genetic Predisposition

Genetically conveyed predispositions to schizophrenia may also impact the associations 
between childhood experiences and schizophrenia in many ways.

Multiple studies support gene by environment relevance at the intersection of child abuse 
and predisposition to schizophrenia. The polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PRS-S), 
based on the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium schizophrenia meta-analysis, in the study of 
childhood adversity in schizophrenia supported specific impact of sexual abuse, emotional 
abuse, and emotional neglect, but not physical abuse or physical neglect, on additive risk for 
schizophrenia in those with genetic susceptibility (Guloksuz, Pries et al. 2019). Additional 
work has demonstrated that, at the population level, recent stressful life events as well as 
previous traumas and genetic risk for schizophrenia by PRS were associated with poor 
mental health – demonstrating the pleitotropic impacts of both trauma and genetic risk to 
poor mental health (Pries, van Os et al. 2020).

Gene by environment interaction assessment does not, however, fully clarify role of gene-
environment correlation. For example, derivation of polygenic scores may not have been 
powered to separate experiences of trauma that were associated with passive genetic 
correlates (Jaffee and Price 2008). Importantly, several studies have continued to support 
direct, causal association of trauma with psychosis, above and beyond genetic predisposition 
or gene-environment correlation. For example, a general population twin cohort of 593 
adolescents and young adults supported association of experiences of child abuse and 
neglect with increased negative affect, decreased positive affect, and increased subtle 
psychosis expression, without concordant association for PRS-S (Pries, Klingenberg et al. 
2020). This study concluded that childhood adversities in individuals with high PRS-S 
may be pleiotropically associated with emotion dysregulation and psychosis liability. A 
study of two international cohorts that accounted for both parental and child PRS similarly 
concluded that trauma, including child abuse and neglect, association with psychosis was 
likely multifactorial with direct causal role of trauma in addition to gene-environment 
correlation (Sallis, Croft et al. 2020).

3.3.  Substance use

As outlined above (see 1.3.3), experiences of child abuse and neglect are associated with 
increased risk of substance use, as well as earlier age of substance use disorder (Carliner, 
Keyes et al. 2016, Schuckher, Sellin et al. 2018). Relatedly, significant bodies of work 
support the high rate of comorbid substance use and psychosis and include bidirectional 
connections between substance use and diagnosis (Degenhardt, Saha et al. 2018). In 
particular, cannabis use has been associated with increased risk of schizophrenia as well 
as earlier age of onset and worse clinical course (Hasan, von Keller et al. 2020). Further 
elucidation of relationships among these three forces, child abuse and neglect, substance use, 
and schizophrenia, is warranted.

4.  Treatment

4.1.  Comorbidities

Page 8

In situations of trauma history and schizophrenia or psychosis, actionable targets worth 
specific treatment consideration have been identified. First, transdiagnostic mechanisms of 
trauma with clinical overlap of PTSD psychosis and schizophrenia warrant consideration of 
role for evidence-based PTSD treatment in settings of schizophrenia with history of trauma. 
Integrated treatment of PTSD in psychosis has been documented as safe and efficacious 
by randomized control trial (van den Berg, de Bont et al. 2015, van den Berg, de Bont 
et al. 2016). Thus, recommendations stand to consider history of trauma with attention to 
potential comorbidity with PTSD, intrusive thoughts, and hallucinations. Second, concurrent 
depression may be a mediating factor in associations between exposures to child abuse and 
neglect and worse functioning over time after diagnosis with schizophrenia (Alameda, Golay 
et al. 2017). Evidence-based treatment of comorbid depression should be attended to in this 
particular risk population.

4.2  Treatment Resistant Schizophrenia

Treatment-resistant schizophrenia may be more common among those with history of child 
maltreatment (see Section 2.1). Overall optimized outcomes for TRS include active and 
recurrent awareness to risks of TRS and differentiation from pseudo-resistance (Potkin, 
Kane et al. 2020). Modifiable risk factors predictive of TRS include delay in treatment at 
initial psychosis, nonadherence to antipsychotics, inadequately addressed comorbidities such 
as substance-use disorders, and lack of early antipsychotic response (Carbon and Correll 
2014). Connections between pharmaco-resistant psychosis and history of maltreatment are 
poorly understood and represent a critical area of future research.

However, a first step in consideration of targeted therapy in schizophrenia informed by 
history of trauma is the identification of trauma. Literature suggests that there is inconsistent 
inquiry regarding child abuse and neglect in clinical care (Read, Harper et al. 2018). At 
present, integration of trauma-informed practices continues to be standard of care and 
should be adhered to within treatment for patients with schizophrenia with or without 
specific disclosure of history of abuse. Moreover, as clinicians consider active solicitation 
of history of abuse and neglect, they should be aware of jurisdictional policies regarding 
mandatory reporting. For example, several states in the U.S. include disclosures of child 
abuse regardless of age at disclosure (e.g., by adult patients) within mandatory reporting 
statutes (Child Welfare Gateway, 2019). Practically, this may require additional informed 
consent and disclosures at outset of therapeutic relationship to ensure foundational trust.

5.  Prevention

5.1.  Prevention of childhood trauma

While it continues to be important to quantify and understand the physical and behavioral 
health impacts of child abuse and neglect, adequate literature has created foundational 
justification to support prevention efforts. For example, epidemiologic studies of ACE 
associations with physical health have demonstrated lower impact of isolated early ACEs

versus chronic ACEs, emphasizing the potential for meaningful intervention to abate the risk 
trajectory (Thompson, Flaherty et al. 2015).

The multi-layer ecologic context in which child abuse and neglect originates supports 
multiple potential levels of prevention (Belsky 1980, Sidebotham 2001). Unfortunately, there 
are no uniformly recommended prevention interventions identified within healthcare per the 
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (Moyer 2013). Reassuringly, evidence supports that 
some forms of childhood adversity – namely physical and sexual abuse - are decreasing 
in the U.S. (Finkelhor 2020). Incidence of neglect, however, may require larger, societal 
interventions to impact population rates (Feely, Raissian et al. 2020). Moreover, it is 
important to recognize the potential and under-evaluated impacts of racism as trauma 
(Shonkoff, Slopen et al. 2021).

5.2.  Early recognition of and intervention in substance use

As outlined in above (sections 1.3.3 and 3.3), substance use has been established as 
increased subsequent to child abuse and also with potential causative role in subsequent 
development with schizophrenia. Thus, focused attention to clinical interventions to abate 
substance use as sequalae to trauma and antecedent to schizophrenia are warranted.

Early screening and intervention for substance use should be considered starting in 
childhood. The American Academy of Pediatrics has affirmed recommendation to screen 
for substance use including alcohol from adolescence (Levy, Williams et al. 2016). Data 
supports utility of some tools for substance use initiation screening as early as age 
9 (Ridenour, Willis et al. 2015). Meta-analysis does provide evidence for treatment in 
adolescence though additional work is needed (Steele, Becker et al. 2020).

6.  Conclusion

Childhood experiences impact long-term physical and behavioral health outcomes including 
conveying risk for schizophrenia and psychosis. Multiple mechanisms may connect child 
abuse and neglect with schizophrenia including both direct and indirect forces. After 
diagnosis, schizophrenia with antecedent trauma may have more severe clinical course and, 
when trauma is reported, providers should heed risk of treatment resistance. Additionally, 
childhood trauma may convey transdiagnostic risks that compounds clinical care by multiple 
comorbidities. Early prevention of child abuse and neglect holds promise though will require 
systems coordination. Finally, regardless of presence or absence of child abuse and neglect 
disclosure, we should strive as clinicians and researchers to conduct ourselves in trauma-
informed ways - with our patients and ourselves.
