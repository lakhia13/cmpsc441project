Metacognitive therapy versus exposure
and response prevention for obsessive-
compulsive disorder: study protocol for
a randomized controlled trial
Kim Melchior1*, Ingmar Franken2, Mathijs Deen3 and Colin van der Heiden1

Abstract

Background: The recommended psychological treatment of choice for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is
exposure with response prevention (ERP). However, recovery rates are relatively modest, so better treatments are
needed. This superiority study aims to explore the relative efficacy of metacognitive therapy (MCT), a new form
of cognitive therapy based on the metacognitive model of OCD.
Design and method: In a randomized controlled trial, we will compare MCT with ERP. One hundred patients
diagnosed with OCD will be recruited in an outpatient mental health center in Rotterdam (the Netherlands). The
primary outcome measure is OCD severity, measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS).
Data are assessed at baseline, after treatment, and at 6 and 30 months follow-up.

Discussion: By comparing MCT with ERP we hope to provide an indication whether MCT is efficacious in the
treatment of OCD and, if so, whether it has the potential to be more efficacious than the current “gold standard”
psychological treatment for OCD, ERP.

Background
Phenomenology and treatment
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe mental
condition which is characterized by intrusive thoughts
(obsessions)
(compulsions)
and repetitive behaviors
intended to neutralize anxiety induced by these thoughts
[1]. OCD has been ranked among the 10 most debilitat-
ing disorders by the World Health Organization (WHO)
and tends to be chronic without adequate treatment
[48]. Both studies into pharmacological treatment, pri-
marily with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs), and studies into specific forms of psychological
treatment supported the effectiveness of these treatment

modalities in reducing symptoms of OCD [3]. The
first-choice psychological treatment for OCD is exposure
and response prevention (ERP) [31, 34, 37], a specific
type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) based on
learning theory, which suggests that classical condition-
ing is responsible for the development of obsessions,
whereas operant conditioning processes maintain anxiety
and compulsive behaviors [27]. In ERP treatment, patients
are exposed to anxiety-provoking stimuli (situations, ob-
jects, thoughts) combined with the strict prevention of
performing ritual behaviors [26]. Since its introduction in
the prognosis for OCD improved substantially.

However, OCD remains a difficult disorder to treat.
Although numerous studies have found statistically signifi-
cant change and large improvements in OCD symptoms
after ERP, the outcomes are sub-optimal for the majority
of patients. More specifically: although about 60% of

treatment completers achieve recovery, only approxi-
mately 25% of patients are asymptomatic following treat-
ment [11, 14], which means that the majority of patients
treated with ERP continue to experience distressing OCD
symptoms. Furthermore, the overall effectiveness of ERP
for OCD is attenuated by some limitations of
the
approach. As approximately 30% of patients with OCD
refuse ERP or drop out from treatment prematurely, it is
assumed that overall recovery rates are lower [30]. More-
over, these figures suggest that ERP might be hard to
tolerate and is burdensome, which is supported by the
finding that an important reason for not attempting ERP
are the requirements of
(e.g. exposure to
anxiety provoking stimuli [46]). So, although it can be
concluded that ERP is efficacious, there is clearly room for
improvement in the psychological treatment of OCD. It is
assumed that this improvement could result from a better
understanding in the mechanisms involved in the main-
tenance of the disorder.

treatment

The metacognitive model of OCD
A recently developed theoretical account explaining the
maintenance of OCD symptoms is the metacognitive
model by Adrian Wells [42, 43]. In this model of OCD, two
belief domains are assumed to be fundamental in the main-
tenance of the disorder. First, it is proposed that obsessions
are misinterpreted because of metacognitive beliefs about
the dangerousness, significance, and consequences of intru-
sive thoughts and feelings, the so-called fusion beliefs.
Three classes of fusion beliefs are highlighted: thought
fusion (TEF); and
action fusion (TAF); thought event

thought object fusion (TOF). TAF [32] refers to the belief
that obsessional thoughts can lead to the commission of an
action (e.g. “thinking about killing someone will make me
do it”). TEF [42] refers to the belief that obsessional
thoughts can make events happen (e.g. “thinking about a
car accident means I will be involved in such an accident”)
or mean an event has already occurred (e.g. “If I think I ran
into someone with my car, I probably did it”). Finally, TOF
[43] refers to the belief that thoughts or negative feelings
can be passed into objects (e.g. “my feeling of evil could be
passed into objects and from these objects to other
people”). Once the fusion beliefs are activated, they give
significance to obsessional thoughts and lead to appraisal
of, and worrying about, the thoughts and consequently to
feelings of anxiety and perceived threat. This anxiety primes
a second domain of metacognitive beliefs: beliefs about the
necessity of performing rituals in response to obsessive
thoughts in order to reduce the perceived threat (e.g.
“Counting to seven will restrain me from acting on my
thoughts”). Consequently, patients with OCD engage in
both overt and covert ritual behaviors and, thereby, use
specific internal rules (instead of external observation) and
so-called “stop signals” to determine how the ritual must be
conducted and when it can be terminated. Such stop sig-
nals are often metacognitive experiences, such as a feeling
of satisfaction (e.g. “I must wash my hands until ‘it feels
right’”). They also use other neutralizing coping strategies
such as monitoring for further intrusive experiences, which
is seen as a counterproductive strategy as it increases the
awareness and frequency of intrusive thoughts. The meta-
cognitive model of OCD is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Metacognitive treatment for OCD
Based on the metacognitive model, treatment should
focus exclusively on modifying patients’ beliefs about the
intrusive thoughts and the
importance and power of
necessity of performing rituals,
instead of challenging
the actual content of the obsessions and compulsions
[12]. Although metacognitive therapy (MCT) uses com-
parable techniques as cognitive therapy (CT) for this
purpose, such as verbal reattribution and behavioral
experiments, the two approaches are fundamentally dif-
ferent [13]. For example, patients with OCD can describe
appraisals in the domain of inflated responsibility, perfec-
tionism, and intolerance of uncertainty. The metacognitive
model proposes that such appraisals result from the acti-
vation of metacognitive beliefs about obsessions; con-
sequently, it is not necessary to modify these lower order
beliefs as is done in CT (e.g. by using the pie chart tech-
nique to compare the patient’s original estimated proba-
bility with a more realistic estimate of probability) [5, 17].
Targeting such lower order beliefs and automatic thoughts
is seen as counterproductive as it just promotes further
conceptual processing, such as worrying and rumination
[15]. Instead, it is thought that modification of the meta-
cognitive beliefs about the meaning and power of obses-
sions removes the need for further conceptual processing.
Therefore, interventions are explicitly aimed at the meta-
cognitive processes which perpetuate the continued
maladaptive processing instead of attempting to modify
the content of perseverative thinking (i.e. appraisals) [13].
So far, there is preliminary evidence supporting the
efficacy of MCT for OCD. The clinical significance of
treatment effects in the following mentioned studies is
calculated using the standard criteria developed by Fisher
and Wells [11, 14], based on the method of Jacobson and
Truax [21]. Based on these criteria, patients are classified
as recovered if they achieved a reduction of minimal 10
points on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale
(Y-BOCS [19]; a semi-structured interview for OCS) and a
post-treatment score < 14. When achieving a post-treat-
ment score < 7, patients are classified as asymptomatic.
Using single case methodology, Fisher and Wells [12]
found clinically significant improvements for four OCD
patients with different clinical presentations who were
treated individually with MCT. Two of the four parti-
cipants were asymptomatic at both post-treatment and
three-monthfollow-up assessments. Furthermore, Rees
and Van Koesveld [33] found that seven out of eight
participants in an open trial of group MCT for OCD
reached criteria for a recovery status on the Y-BOCS at
three-monthfollow-up (87.5%). In an additional study, Fitt
and Rees [16] found similar clinically significant reduc-
tions among three patients treated with MCT using video-
conference. In an open trial of individual metacognitive
therapy among 25 patients with OCD, Van der Heiden et

[35]

al. [39] found statistically significant reductions on all out-
come variables. Moreover, in terms of clinically significant
results, 74% of the treatment completers (n = 19) were
classified as recovered after treatment and 47% as asymp-
tomatic. At follow-up, this increased to 80% and 67% re-
spectively. Finally, Simons et al.
found positive
outcomes of MCT in comparison to ERP in the treatment
of pediatric OCD in a case series design. Together, these
findings suggest that MCT might be an efficacious treat-
ment for OCD and deserves controlled evaluation. The
present trial has been initiated to compare the relative
efficacy of MCT with ERP, in an outpatient clinical sample
of patients with OCD. Our main hypothesis is that
MCT is more efficacious than ERP in the treatment
of OCD in terms of both statistically and clinically
significant improvements, both directly after treatment
(primary outcome) and at follow-up.

Design and methods
Design
We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
with a pretest–post-test (primary outcome) 6-month–
30-month follow-up-design. Patients will be recruited
from consecutive referrals to the Anxiety Disorders
department of PsyQ, an outpatient community mental
health center in the Netherlands. After screening for
eligibility and informed consent, we will randomize the
patients into two groups: MCT and ERP. The number of
excluded patients and refusers and their reasons are
registered. Participating patients will be assessed by
self-report measures and semi-structured clinical inter-
views administered by a research assistant who is blind
to group allocation at entry (pre-treatment), after the last
treatment session (post-treatment – primary outcome),
six months (first follow-up) after treatment completion
and 30 months (second follow-up) after treatment has
ended. The latter assessment is included to answer a
secondary research questions on the durability of both
the ERP and MCT effect on the long term. Due to a
lack of studies with follow-up periods of > 1 year [9, 47],
the information on longer-term effects are unknown. In
case of drop-out, measurements and interviews are also
administered directly after treatment had ended whenever
this is possible. The study has received ethical approval
from the Medical Ethical Committee of
the Leiden
University Medical Centre (LUMC) (protocol number
NL50201.058.14) and is registered in the Dutch Trial
Register (protocol number NTR4855). All data will be
stored anonymously; there is a data safety and monitoring
board for the study. Figure 2 shows a flowchart of the
study from patient enrollment up to data analysis and
reporting. This study follows the “guidance of standard
protocol items: recommendations of interventional study’s
(SPIRIT).” The SPIRIT figure template is displayed in

Sample size
There are no studies available directly comparing ERP
with MCT. We chose to design our study with enough
statistical power to enable us to detect a medium

between-group effect (Cohen’s d = 0.5 [6]) from baseline
to post-treatment. We chose for this medium between-
group effect because expecting a larger difference between
the two treatment groups does seem unrealistic since
numerous
studies have found statistically significant
change and large improvements in OCD symptoms after
ERP. On the other hand, designing our study to enable us

to detect a small between-group effect is of less relevance
for clinical practice. We used the statistical method pre-
sented by Liu and Liang [22] for sample size calculations
for studies with correlated observations. To achieve a
power of 0.80 with four measurement points with a
correlation of 0.5 between repeated measures (standard
value) and to detect a medium effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.50)
between the two treatment conditions over time on the
primary outcome measure, severity of OCD symptoms, and
an expected drop-out rate of 20%, the minimal sample size
necessary in each condition is 50.

Participant enrollment and randomization
One hundred adult patients (aged 18–65 years) with a
primary diagnosis of OCD will be recruited from con-
secutive referrals to the Anxiety Disorders department
of PsyQ, an outpatient community mental health center

in the Netherlands. Diagnosis of OCD will be established
using the SCID-I [10], a diagnostic interview based on
the DSM-IV, because diagnostic instruments based on
the DSM-5 [1] were not yet available at the development
phase of this study. To enhance the clinical represen-
tativeness of the sample, exclusion criteria are kept to a
minimum. Patients are only excluded if they currently:
(1) meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for severe major depressive
disorder or substance use disorder (other than smoking)
that requires immediate treatment, psychotic disorder,
or bipolar disorder; (2) have mental impairment or an
organic brain disorder; or (3) had a change in medi-
cation type or dose in the six weeks before assessment
or during treatment (see Fig. 2). The presence of other
co-morbid diagnosis or previous treatment for OCD are
not exclusion criteria. Potential participants will receive
extensive information about the design and procedures of

the study at the end of the clinical screening. Following
informed consent, patients will be randomly assigned to
the MCT or ERP condition. Randomization will be done
by using www.randomization.com, an online generator
which randomizes each individual to a treatment con-
dition by using the method of randomly permuted blocks
[24]. With randomly permuted blocks, participants are
assigned to a treatment condition in blocks to ensure that
equal numbers of individuals have been assigned to each
treatment, not only at the end of the study but also at
various intermediate time points. The generator also
randomizes the block sizes (range = 1–4 per group), to
ensure that it is unknown when a block is finished; it is
not possible to guess the remaining treatment allocation.
The process of allocation of cases to intervention con-
ditions will be done by an independent employee of the
participating mental health care center using the ge-
nerated randomization plan. Patients will be allocated to
treatment conditions in order of entry. The investigators
and therapists have no insight in the randomization plan.
therapists will
for therapist effects, all
deliver both treatments in blocks but not in parallel. For
this reason, in the first two years of the study, half of the
therapists from each site deliver MCT while the other
half does ERP. Two years later, treatment conditions will
be crossed over.

To control

Outcome measures
On all assessment points, the Dutch versions of the
measures described below are included. The adminis-
tration of the SCID-I and the Y-BOCS during intake will
be conducted face-to-face and later assessments are by
telephone. Self-report measures will be conducted on
paper and are home-based.

Primary outcome
The primary outcome of interest for this MCT superiority
study is OCD severity at post-treatment, which will be
measured with the Y-BOCS [19], a semi-structured inter-
view and the “gold standard” for measuring OCD symp-
toms. The Y-BOCS is a clinician-ratedsemi-structured
interview designed to rate the severity of both obsessions
and compulsion. The Y-BOCS consists of 10 items
rated 0–4 (range = 0–40). The Y-BOCS has been
shown to have good psychometric properties and is
sensitive for measuring treatment effects [40]. Further,
good internal consistency for both the subscales (obses-
sions and compulsions) and for the total score of the
Y-BOCS has been reported [18].

Secondary outcomes
The presence of OCD and co-morbid Axis I diagnosis
will be assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview
for DSM Axis I Disorders (SCID-I [10]). A recently

revised

(Padua-IR;

conducted study with a large sample size (n = 151) found
adequate to good inter-rater reliability for all Axis I
disorders [23]. Secondary outcomes include self-report
questionnaires to assess OCD symptoms, co-morbid
symptoms, and degree of perceived wellbeing. The
Padua-Inventory
a
self-reportmeasure for OCD severity which consists of 60
items scores on a 0–4 scale (range = 0–240). The Padua-IR
has reasonable psychometric properties [40]. The symptom
checklist (SCL-90 [8]) is used as a measurement of general
psychopathology. The SCL-90 consist of 90 items, all scores
from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much; range = 90–450). This
self-report measure has shown good psychometric proper-
ties. The Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd version (BDI-II
[2]) is included to assess the affective, behavioral, somatic,
and motivational components of depression. This
frequently used self-report consist of 21 items in the
range of 1–4 and has good psychometric properties.
Finally, World Health Organization Quality of Life
(WHOQOL-Bref [48]) is included and assesses the in-
dividuals perception of quality of life with respect to
physical health, psychological health, social relation-
ships, and environment. The WHOQOL consists of 26
items which are answered on a 5-point scale. It is

Process measures
Changes in both belief domains that have been proposed
to be important in the etiology of OCD are assessed. To
study changes in metacognitive beliefs about the meaning,
significance, and danger of
the
Thought Fusion Instrument (TFI [45]) will be employed.
To study changes in metacognitive beliefs about
the
necessity of performing rituals in response to obsessions,
the Beliefs About Rituals Inventory (BARI [25]) is used.
The TFI consists of 14 items and the BARI of 12 items.
All items are answered on a 4-point scale in the range of
1–4. There are few data available about the psychometric
properties of the TFI and the BARI. Gwilliam et al. [20]
found reasonable internal consistency, a moderate test–re-
test reliability, and some support for the convergent and
divergent validity for the TFI. In the developmental phase
of this study, the psychometric properties of the TFI and
the BARI will be further assessed by our research group.

The Obsessive Belief Questionnaire (OBQ-44 [29]) is
included as another measurement with the purpose of
the assessment of beliefs considered to be important in
the maintenance of OCD. Factor analysis of the scale
reveals four factors: (1) perfectionism and intolerance of
uncertainty; (2) importance and control of thoughts; (3)
responsibility; and (4) overestimation of
[28].
The OBQ-44 consists of 44 items answered on a scale
of 1–4. The psychometric properties are good.

In addition, on both follow-up assessments, parti-
cipants will be called by a research assistant, who will
ask them to provide responses for the Treatment Change
Recording Form (TCRF [38]), which will be used to
assess the initiation, termination, or change of any form
of therapy, hospital services, support group, self-help
program, or medication utilized by the participant since
post-treatment.

Interventions
The interventions will be offered at the Anxiety Dis-
orders Department of PsyQ, at which ERP is already deli-
vered as treatment as usual for OCD. Both manual-driven
treatments consist of up to 15 weekly sessions of 45 min
duration. Treatment can be terminated earlier, when both
patient and therapist agree that treatment goals are com-
pleted. A minimum of eight sessions will be managed as
criteria for each patient to can be classified as treatment
completer in the statistical analysis. Interventions will be
delivered by nine staff psychologists, who are trained in
CBT and who are familiar with the provision of ERP for
OCD. Four of the participating therapists were trained by
Dr. Adrian Wells and Dr. Peter Fisher, experts in the field
of MCT, preceding the start of a pilot study into the
efficacy of MCT for OCD in which they participated as
therapists [39]. The other five therapists will be trained in
the provision of MCT for OCD by the fourth author (CH)
preceding the start of this study. During the study,
therapists will be supervised monthly by the fourth
author (CH) in separate group sessions for ERP and
MCT. In these 1-h supervision meetings, all current
cases and therapy notes will be reviewed to ensure
treatment quality and adherence. Treatment integrity
will also be evaluated by means of randomly assessing
recordings of
treatment sessions against a session-
by-session intervention checklist.

For the purpose of this study we will use an ERP
protocol based on the inhibitory learning model of extinc-
tion [7], which states that the original fear conditioning is
not erased during exposure therapy but stays intact while
a second conditioning is developed. Translated to clinical
practice, this means that during exposure and response
prevention exercises, attention is focused on the dis-
confirmation of fear cognitions. Before exposure exercises,
the fear cognitions are recorded and the exposure is intro-
duced as a way to collect evidence for or against these
appraisals. The ERP manual consists of three phases. In
the first phase, an explanation of the behavioral model of
OCD and rationale is discussed and an anxiety hierarchy
containing all of the anxiety provoking situations is de-
veloped. The second phase includes both within-session
and between-session in vivo and imaginal exposure-exer-
cises, with early exposure to moderately distressing situa-
tions with progression toward more anxiety evoking ones.

This latter is done to minimalize drop-out in the first ex-
posure and response prevention sessions. Later, the pa-
tient is asked to practice in many different situations and
circumstances and even alternate between the more easy
and difficult exercises. According to the inhibitory learn-
ing model, the more variability is added throughout ex-
posure exercises, the better the new information can be
retrieved at a later point which minimize relapse [7].
Ritual prevention includes instructions to refrain from all
compulsive behaviors. In the final phase, a relapse preven-
tion plan is developed.

MCT focuses exclusively on modifying metacognitive
beliefs about intrusive thoughts and the necessity of
performing rituals [12]. MCT consists four treatment
phases. Phase 1 involves psycho-education about the
metacognitive model, increasing patients’ awareness of
the role of metacognitions and generation of an idiosyn-
cratic case conceptualization. This is accomplished by
eliciting metacognitive beliefs, e.g. by guided questioning.
Experiments are used to illustrate maladaptive coping
strategies, e.g. the thought suppression experiment in
which the patient is asked to suppress the thought of a
white rabbit which is rarely completely successful [41].
Also, detached mindfulness (DM) is practiced. In DM,
patients are asked to be aware of their intrusive thoughts
and try to stop or disconnect any response to that
thought, like engaging with their obsessional thoughts by
worrying about consequences or the chance of occurrence
[44]. Instead, patients practice with evaluating their intru-
sions and notice them as “just mental events in the mind,”
e.g. by visualizing the thought moving away from them. In
the second phase, metacognitive beliefs about intrusions
are targeted by verbal cognitive restructuring (e.g. ques-
tioning the evidence and searching for counterevidence)
and behavioral experiments. An example of such an ex-
periment is exposure and response commission (ERC), in
which patients are asked to perform rituals and to keep
their intrusive thought in mind at the same time, instead
of trying to get rid of the intrusive thought. The main aim
of ERC is to enable patients to experience obsessive
thoughts on a meta-level by obtaining distance from them
and discovering that they are unimportant events in the
mind [44]. In phase 3, metacognitive beliefs about rituals
are challenged, again by means of both verbal methods
(e.g. questioning the evidence and an advantages–dis-
advantages analysis) and behavioral experiments, such as
ritual modulation experiments in which patients are asked
to alternate between more and less ritual behavior with
the aim of assessing its impact on daily life. In the final
phase, the therapist and patient work on a relapse preven-
tion plan consisting of a new plan for reacting in response
to intrusive experiences combined with a blueprint of the
therapy. The old versus new plan consists of attentional
strategies and coping behaviors opposite to the strategies

Melchior et al. Trials          (2019) 20:277 

Page 8 of 11

and behaviors of the old plan (e.g. applying detached
mindfulness [new plan] instead of worrying about intru-
sions [old plan]). In addition, a blueprint of the therapy is
developed, consisting of a summary of the therapy, the
case conceptualization, a list of metacognitive beliefs and
an overview of evidence challenging them. An overview of
the both treatments is provided in Table 1. The full
manuals (in Dutch) are available from the corresponding
author upon request.

Statistical analysis
Outcomes
Data will be analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 25.
Because of the expected drop-out and the uneven time
intervals between measurements (post-test 6-month–
30-month follow-up), the use of mixed models is the
most appropriate statistical method [36]. This method-
ology is very suitable to analyze repeated measures by
taking dependency between observation into account
and the ability to handle missing data. In case of Missing
At Random (MAR), we will use these variable(s) as
covariate in our analysis. In case of Missing Not At
Random (MNAR) we will use pattern mixture models.
Mixed models will be adjusted by the baseline values of
the repeated measures. Descriptives for means and pro-
portions of baseline clinical and demographic variables
between treatment conditions will be reported so poten-
tial magnitudes of imbalances can be assessed. Model
diagnostics will be assessed by exploring residual plots.
In case they are not acceptable, we will apply bootstrap-
ping procedures with the use of R (R core team, 2018).

Fixed effects in our model will be time, treatment, and
their interaction. In case of missingness, we will add these
variable(s) also as fixed effects. The Benjamini–Hochberg
procedure is applied to the significances of the time*treat-
interaction p-values (two-sided p < 0.05) of
ment
the
different outcome measures. The time variable will be
treated categorically, with the first post-baseline measure-
ment as the reference category. To accommodate the
modeling of correlation among repeated measurements,
we impose a first order autoregressive (AR (1)) structure
on the residuals. Next, the interaction effect between time
and group will be explored by analyzing the estimated
marginal means at different time points. We expect a
significant interaction effect between time and group,
which means that scores change differently over time in
the two treatment conditions. More specifically, we expect
a more negative time trend for MCT than for ERP, indi-
cating that the measurement scores in the MCT condition
decline more over time than in the ERP condition. To gain
further insight
the
improvements achieved in the two treatment conditions,
we will perform a least significant difference test with the
estimated marginal means to compare changes between
treatment conditions. In accordance with the linear mixed
models, we expect a statistically significant decline in both
treatment conditions between pretest and post-test, but
no statistical differences between post-test and both
follow-up measures. To allow for comparison with other
studies into the effectiveness of ERP and MCT for OCD,
Cohen’s d statistic ((mean 1 – mean 2) / pooled SD) will
be employed to calculate within-group effect sizes (ES) for

into the statistical significance of

changes on outcome measures and to evaluate between-
group differences. We will calculate Cohen’s d statistics
for both intent-to-treat samples by using multilevel ana-
lysis with all available data and completer samples (our
primary analysis: minimum of eight treatment sessions
and no change in medication during treatment will be
managed as criteria for each patient to can be classified as
treatment completer). Based on previous research, we
expect a large within-treatment ES for both treatment
(Cohen’s d > 0.8). We expect a medium
conditions
between-group ES in favor of MCT. In addition, the
clinical significance of treatment effects and amount of
drop-out will be examined also to gain further insight into
the clinical value of the two treatment conditions.

Endpoints
The clinical significance of treatment effects will be
examined using the procedures outlined by Jacobson
and Truax [21]. Patients will be classified as recovered, if
they score within the normal range on the Y-BOCS after
(cut-off point = 14) and display statistically
treatment
reliable improvement on that measure (reliable change
index = 10) [21]. Patients will be classified as improved
but not recovered if
they meet only one criterion.
Patients will be classified as asymptomatic (a more
stringent criterion for defining recovery) when they
achieve a posttreatment score of ≤ 7 (indicating an almost
total absence of OCD symptomatology), in addition to
meeting the reliable change index. Further, diagnosis-
free status will also be used as an index of clinically
significant change.

Discussion
MCT is a relatively new treatment for OCD, based on a
metacognitive model that states that, rather than the
intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, it is in fact
beliefs about the meaning and significance of obsessive
thoughts on the one hand and beliefs about the need to
conduct rituals and neutralizing behaviors on the other
hand that are crucial for the development of OCD As a
result, interventions should be targeted at these meta-
cognitive beliefs. Our hypothesis is that MCT is more
efficacious in the treatment of OCD than the current
“gold standard” psychological treatment for OCD, ERP.
Since there is a wide variation in symptomatology
between OCD patients, and beliefs about intrusions and
compulsions are comparable for each subtype, it may be
that MCT is particularly well suited in the treatment of
this disorder. Moreover,
it may be that MCT is less
burdensome since it does not include prolonged exposure
to anxiety provoking stimuli. So far, five relatively small
studies suggest that MCT might be an efficacious treat-
ment for OCD and may be even more efficacious than the
current “gold standard,” ERP [12, 16, 33, 35, 39]. We

presented the rationale and design of a RCT assessing the
relative efficacy of ERP and MCT for OCD. To our know-
ledge, this is the first long-term RCT to explore whether
MCT produces better results than ERP.

The study has several strengths, including randomization
of patients to two active treatment conditions, use of an
unselected, clinically representative sample of OCD
patients, and long-termfollow-up assessments.

However, the current study also has limitations. Treat-
ment conditions might be contaminated as participating
therapists will deliver both ERP and MCT. It might also
be difficult to maintain treatment integrity as both treat-
ments will be conducted by therapists who work within
a routine outpatient community mental health center.
We aim to minimize these limitations by means of
reviewing all active cases in consultation meetings and
careful checking of treatment integrity.

Trial status
This study received ethical approval from the Medical
Ethical Committee of the Leiden University Medical
Centre (LUMC) on 21 October 2014. The first patient
enrolled on 6 February 2015. Sixty-eight participants are
randomized so far. We are still recruiting patients and
have planned to close the inclusion at the end of 2019.
