Abstract

Objective:  There is inconclusive evidence regarding sexual identity and race/ethnicity 
differences in outcomes in evidence-based psychological treatments. Although Dialectical 
Behavior Therapy (DBT) is well-studied, little is known about the extent to which its efficacy 
generalizes to sexual minority and racial/ethnic minority people. This study examined sexual 
identity, race/ethnicity, and their interaction as predictors of treatment outcome and retention in 
DBT.

Method:  Data were from five clinical trials conducted in research and community settings 
with a variety of adult populations (N = 269) engaged in standard DBT, augmented DBT, 
or DBT components. Longitudinal mixed-effects models evaluated sexual identity and racial/
ethnic differences in clinical outcomes (suicide attempts, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), global 
functioning, psychiatric hospitalizations) and retention.

Results:  Sexual identity, race/ethnicity, and their interaction did not predict the average severity 
or the rate of change in any clinical outcome over time. Sexual minority identity was associated 
with decreased risk of treatment dropout (OR = .44, p < .001). However, this effect was moderated 
by race/ethnicity, such that Non-Hispanic White sexual minority participants had the lowest rates 
of dropout. Exploratory analyses suggested potential differences related to NSSI for certain sexual 
and racial/ethnic minority subgroups.

Conclusions:  Findings suggest that sexual minority and racial/ethnic minority people may 
benefit from DBT as much as heterosexual and Non-Hispanic White people, respectively. Sexual 
minority identity interacted with race/ethnicity to predict dropout, such that sexual minority people 
were more likely to complete DBT if they were Non-Hispanic White. Further research is needed to 
clarify potential subgroup and intersectional differences.

In recent years, there has been growing attention to evaluating the effectiveness of 
psychotherapy for individuals from marginalized populations. Research using large datasets 
and meta-analytic methods has not found evidence of consistent differences in outcomes 
across treatments based on sexual identity (Lefevor et al., 2017; Rimes et al., 2019) or 
race/ethnicity (Cougle & Grubaugh, 2022), though there is some variability in results. This 
heterogeneity in findings may be due in part to evaluating outcomes across diverse types of 
psychotherapies. In this study, we compare clinical outcomes and retention between sexual 
identity and racial/ethnic groups in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) specifically.

DBT is an evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP) originally designed to treat individuals at 
high risk of suicide (Linehan, 1993) that has gained robust empirical support for treating 
borderline personality disorder (BPD; Storebø et al., 2020). Theoretical work suggests that 
the principles and structure of DBT may be well-suited to minoritized populations given its 
emphasis on the impact of invalidating environments on mental health and core dialectic 
between acceptance and change (Chang & Cohen, 2022; Cohen et al., 2021; Pantalone et 
al., 2019; Pierson et al., 2021; Skerven et al., 2019; Sloan et al., 2017). Several studies have 
found that sexual minority people improved comparably to heterosexual people in various 
psychological and functional outcomes when participating in DBT for adolescents (Poon et 
al., 2022) and a CBT and DBT skills-based partial hospital program (Beard et al., 2017). 
However, bisexual people may have worse outcomes on suicidal and self-injurious thoughts 
compared to other sexual identity groups (Beard et al., 2017). Similarly, studies have found 
that race/ethnicity did not predict outcomes in DBT for binge eating disorder (Safer & Jo, 
2010), nor did it predict dropout for patients with BPD receiving outpatient DBT (Landes et 
al., 2016). One study found that Hispanic youth had greater reductions in suicide attempts 
compared to Non-Hispanic youth in DBT (Adrian et al., 2019). More rigorously designed 
studies with larger samples are needed to expand these findings.

Using data from five clinical trials of DBT, the current study examined whether sexual 
minority and racial/ethnic minority participants differed from heterosexual and Non-
Hispanic White participants, respectively, on the average severity and rate of change

in suicide attempts, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), psychiatric hospitalizations, global 
functioning, and treatment dropout during DBT. Given the importance of intersectionality, 
which states that identities are dynamic and mutually influential (Crenshaw, 2018), we also 
investigated whether sexual minority identity interacted with race/ethnicity in predicting 
these outcomes. We also conducted exploratory analyses to probe subgroup differences 
within sexual identity and race/ethnicity.

Participants

Procedures

Measures

The current study merged data from five clinical trials of DBT (see Table 1) involving 
adult participants who received standard DBT, augmented DBT (DBT + DBT Prolonged 
Exposure, DBT + buprenorphine), or DBT components (DBT individual therapy only or 
DBT group therapy only) and was approved by the VA Puget Sound IRB.

A total of 269 adult participants were assigned to DBT conditions (inclusion criteria in Table 
1 and demographics in Table 2).

Independent evaluators who were masked to treatment condition conducted participant 
assessments at baseline, 4-, 8-, and 12-months (see Table 1).

Demographics.—Sex/gender, age, ethnic background, racial background, sexual identity, 
education, income, and marital status were assessed.

Suicide attempts and NSSI.—The Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview (SASII; 
Linehan et al., 2006) assessed frequency of suicide attempts and NSSI in the year prior to 
baseline (Studies 1–4) or lifetime (Study 5) and for outcomes since the previous assessment. 
This measure has very good interrater reliability and adequate validity (Linehan et al., 
2006). Although these behaviors may not have been evenly distributed over the year prior to 
baseline, to create comparable timeframes, we divided baseline counts by three.

Hospitalizations.—The Treatment History Interview (Linehan & Heard, 1987) was used 
to assess the number of admissions to inpatient psychiatric units in the past year (baseline) 
and since the previous assessment (outcomes), with baseline counts divided by three.

Global functioning.—Global functioning was assessed using the Global Assessment 
Scale (GAS; Weissman, 1976; Studies 1, 2, 5) and the Global Assessment of Functioning 
Scale (GAF; Study 4). Both the GAS and GAF use a 0–100 rating scale to rate the 
overall severity of illness with higher scores indicating better functioning. The GAS has 
demonstrated inter-rater liability between 0.61–0.91 (Endicott, 1976).

Treatment dropout.—Participants were considered to have prematurely dropped out from 
DBT if they missed four consecutive sessions of either DBT individual or group therapy 
(Studies 1, 2, 4, 5) or if they dropped out of treatment prior to the expected program 
discharge (Study 3).

Analytic Strategy

All analyses were conducted using R Studio (RStudio Team, 2022). Primary analyses 
consisted of mixed-effects models. Preliminary analyses examined the distribution of 
outcome measures to identify which models best fit the data using Hu and Bentler’s (1998) 
guidelines (e.g., Poisson models, negative binomial models, and zero-inflated and hurdle 
models). Outcomes were modeled using Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM) for continuous 
outcomes (global functioning) and Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models (HGLM) for 
binary (hospitalization, dropout) and count outcomes (suicide attempts, NSSI acts). The 
lme4 package (Bates et al., 2015) was used for HLM analyses and the glmmTMB R package 
(Brooks et al., 2017) was used for HGLM analyses. Missing data ranged from 0–14.5% 
across outcomes (see Table 3).

In HLM/HGLM models, predictors in the model were a linear effect of Time (all assessment 
points from baseline to 12 months), a quadratic effect of Time, sexual minority (0 = 
heterosexual, 1 = sexual minority), racial/ethnic minority (0 = Non-Hispanic White, 1 = 
racial/ethnic minority); all two-way interactions, and the three-way interaction. Minimally 
adjusted models controlled for study, sex/gender, and age. DBT intervention type was 
examined as a potential moderator but did not significantly interact with either identity 
factor in predicting any outcome and was excluded from the final models.

Secondary exploratory analyses were conducted to probe differences among sexual identity 
as well as race/ethnicity subgroups. For sexual identity, categories included heterosexual (n 
= 198), lesbian/gay (n = 16), bisexual (n = 37), and uncertain (n = 16). Two participants 
who selected “other” as their sexual identity were excluded from these analyses. For race/
ethnicity, categories included Non-Hispanic White (n = 191), Non-Hispanic Black/African 
American (n = 18), Non-Hispanic Asian/Asian American (n = 7), Hispanic (n = 20), and 
Non-Hispanic Multiracial (n = 29). One participant who was Native American/Alaskan 
Native was excluded from these analyses. Subgroup analyses were conducted within the 
HLM/HGLM models by changing the reference group to examine pairwise comparisons. 
Given the exploratory nature, corrections for multiple comparisons were not applied; 
however, we encourage due caution in interpreting these exploratory analyses.

relevant clinical trials. The analysis code can be accessed from the first author.

Clinical outcomes.—Significant time effects were found for each outcome indicating that 
suicide attempts, NSSI episodes, and hospitalizations decreased while global functioning 
increased over the course of treatment. There were no significant differences on these 
outcomes on average or on the rate of change over time when comparing sexual minority 
with heterosexual participants, when comparing racial/ethnic minority participants with 
Non-Hispanic White participants, and when examining the interaction of sexual identity 
with race/ethnicity.

Treatment dropout.—Sexual minority identity was significantly associated with 
decreased risk of treatment dropout (p < .001). Compared to heterosexual participants, 
sexual minority participants were 56% less likely to drop out (OR = .44), with 27.1% of 
sexual minority and 39.2% of heterosexual participants dropping out across the five studies. 
Dropout rates did not differ between racial/ethnic minority (38.7%) and Non-Hispanic White 
participants (35.1%). However, sexual identity significantly interacted with race/ethnicity 
in predicting dropout (p < .001). Model-based estimates for each subgroup indicated that 
dropout rates were 23.9% for Non-Hispanic White sexual minority participants (n = 48), 
38.6% for racial/ethnic minority heterosexual participants (n = 53), 41.6% for Non-Hispanic 
White heterosexual participants (n = 143), and 48.0% for racial/ethnic and sexual minority 
participants (n = 22).

Exploratory Subgroup Analyses

Results from exploratory analyses to evaluate potential differences between each sexual 
identity and race/ethnicity subgroup are presented in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2.

Clinical Outcomes.—There were no significant differences by sexual identity or racial/
ethnic subgroup on suicide attempts or hospitalizations on average or on the rate of change 
over time. Compared to heterosexual (p = .042) and bisexual participants (p = .006), 
participants who reported being uncertain about their sexual identity had a significantly 
slower decrease in NSSI over the course of treatment. Compared to Non-Hispanic White 
participants, Non-Hispanic Black participants had a significantly slower decrease in NSSI 
over the course of treatment (p = .025). Black participants also demonstrated significantly 
lower rates of NSSI on average across all timepoints compared to both Non-Hispanic 
White (p = .023) and Non-Hispanic Multiracial participants (p = .0496). See Supplemental 
Figures 1 and 2 for model-based estimates of NSSI over time by subgroup. Compared to 
Non-Hispanic White (p = .039) and Black participants (p = .013), Hispanic participants 
reported significantly greater global functioning on average across timepoints. However, the 
rate of change in global functioning did not differ between groups.

Treatment Dropout.—Compared to heterosexual participants, gay/lesbian participants 
were 55% less likely to drop out of treatment (p = .024).

Discussion

In primary analyses, sexual minority participants did not differ from heterosexual 
participants in average levels or rates of change in suicide attempts, NSSI, global 
functioning, or hospitalization during DBT. This finding is consistent with past studies

of DBT or DBT-based treatments (Beard et al., 2017; Poon et al., 2022). With regard to 
therapy more broadly, this finding is similar to a past study showing no differences in rates 
of change in anxiety and depression between sexual minority and heterosexual clients in 
college counseling centers (Lefevor et al., 2017), but differed from a past study finding 
worse outcomes on depression, anxiety, and functional impairment for lesbian and bisexual 
clients compared to heterosexual clients (Rimes et al., 2019).

Additionally, sexual minority participants in the present sample were less likely to drop 
out of DBT (27.1%) than heterosexual participants (39.2%) on the whole. This finding 
may also reflect more general patterns of increased help-seeking among sexual minority 
people who have been found to use mental health services more frequently than heterosexual 
people (Filice & Meyer, 2018). It is important to note that the protective effect of sexual 
minority identity on reducing dropout was moderated by race/ethnicity such that Non-
Hispanic White sexual minority people were less likely to drop out, whereas heterosexual 
individuals and sexual minority people of color demonstrated appreciably higher dropout 
rates. It is possible that individuals with both marginalized identities experience greater 
stress due to the cumulative effects of both heterosexism and racism, and clinicians may 
be less knowledgeable or equipped to provide affirming care that incorporates intersectional 
considerations.

Regarding race/ethnicity differences, our findings indicate that racial/ethnic minority 
participants did not differ from Non-Hispanic White participants on the average severity 
or rate of change over time in any clinical outcome or treatment dropout. These findings 
are consistent with some past research on race/ethnicity differences in outcomes in DBT 
(Landes et al., 2016; Safer & Jo, 2010), as well as with research indicating a lack of race/
ethnicity differences in psychosocial treatments more broadly (Cougle & Grubaugh, 2022). 
However, these findings contrast with other research suggesting that Hispanic youth had 
greater reductions in suicide attempts compared to Non-Hispanic youth participating in DBT 
(Adrian et al., 2019).

Taken together, these results suggest that sexual minority and racial/ethnic minority people 
may benefit comparably from DBT as heterosexual and Non-Hispanic White people, 
respectively. These findings provide preliminary support for the use of existing DBT 
interventions, including standard DBT, augmented DBT, and DBT components, with these 
minority groups. However, research with larger samples and greater power to detect 
potential differences is needed before drawing firm conclusions about the effectiveness of 
DBT for sexual and racial/ethnic minority people. Research is also needed to determine 
whether potential adaptations to DBT for marginalized groups (e.g., Cohen et al., 2021; Haft 
et al., 2022) enhance outcomes even further.

Though underpowered, subgroup analyses suggest potential differences in treatment 
outcome. Specifically, individuals who described their sexual identity as uncertain may 
derive somewhat less benefit from DBT compared to heterosexual people, though in the 
current study the observed outcome differences were not clinically significant. Further, 
Non-Hispanic Black people were found to have a slower rate of change in NSSI than 
Non-Hispanic White people, possibly due to NSSI being less frequent in Black people both

in this study and in general (Wester & Trepal, 2015). In addition, our findings suggest 
that Hispanic participants may have greater overall global functioning compared to Non-
Hispanic White and Black participants. Further research is needed to elucidate if and why 
these differences might exist.

Limitations

First, our study was likely underpowered to detect subgroup differences, and some groups 
(e.g., Native American/American Indian populations) were not represented. Although this 
study represents the largest sample that has tested sociodemographic differences in DBT 
outcomes that we could identify, a larger sample size would allow more rigorous testing 
of subgroup differences. Future work may consider combining DBT datasets with large 
datasets evaluating other forms of psychotherapies. Second, most of the studies were 
efficacy trials predominantly consisting of US cisgender women treated in university clinics; 
results may not generalize to other groups. Third, future studies should also include a more 
nuanced and comprehensive way of assessing participant gender and include more options 
for sexual orientation. Fourth, our subgroup analyses were prone to Type I error due to 
multiple comparisons.

Public Health Significance Statement:

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based psychotherapy for borderline 
personality disorder and self-injurious behaviors. This study found no evidence of 
differences in DBT treatment outcomes based on sexual identity or race/ethnicity. 
Treatment dropout was lower among sexual minority than heterosexual participants for 
those who were Non-Hispanic White.
