Abstract 
Background and purpose: Around the world, college students physical and mental health is deteriorating. Finding practical 
ways to enhance college students health is crucial. One of the traditional Chinese Qigong exercises is Baduanjin, which is possibly 
one  of  the  most  efficient  workout  techniques  out  there.  However,  it  is  unknown  how  Baduanjin  practice  may  affect  college 
students health. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of Qigong Baduanjin on the physical and mental health of 
female college freshmen.

Materials and methods: A total of 78 female college students were recruited and randomly divided into Baduanjin group or 
control group. Participants in the control group were told to keep their original habits of life and exercise. The Baduanjin exercise 
group  received  12  weeks  of  Baduanjin  exercise,  3  days  a  week  and  1  hour  a  day.  After  the  12  week  randomized  controlled 
trial, the physical and mental health indexes of female students in Baduanjin group and control group were evaluated, including 
physical shape, physical function, physical fitness and scl-90 self-assessment scale.

Results:  Compared  with  the  control  group,  at  the  end  of  the  12  week  intervention,  the  weight,  body  mass  index,  diastolic 
blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, somatization score, obsessive-compulsive disorder score, interpersonal sensitivity score, 
depression score, anxiety score and phobic anxiety score of Baduanjin group decreased significantly. Compared with the control 
group, the vital capacity, vital capacity index, Stand test, Genchi test, Stand on 1 leg with closed eyes, standing bends and squats 
of the Baduanjin group have been significantly improved.

Conclusion: Compared with usual activities, Qigong Baduanjin exercise has advantages in improving female college students 
body  shape  (weight  and  body  mass  index),  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  lung  function,  flexibility,  balance  ability,  muscle 
endurance and mental health.

1. Introduction

Entering college marks the start of a student autonomous exis-
tence,  which  has  significantly  altered  the  physical,  psycholog-
ical,  and  social  relationships  of  students  compared  to  earlier 
times.[1] Students future lives and health may be impacted by the 
lifestyle and behaviors they establish while attending college.[2] 
The global economy is currently growing quickly, students com-
petition  pressure  has  gradually  increased,  their  lifestyles  have 
changed,  and  their  levels  of  physical  activity  and  health  are 
declining globally.[3] In the United States, 40% of college students 
fail to meet the standard of daily physical activities, which leads 

to a decline in physical health.[4] The number of sick students in 
Russian universities is currently increasing.[5–6] Researchers clas-
sified female students as a high-risk healthy population, who are 
usually diagnosed with different diseases, such as cardiovascular 
diseases, scoliosis, and respiratory diseases.[7] Russian research-
ers believe that one of the main reasons for the poor health of 
female  students  is  the  lack  of  physical  activity.[8,9]  Insufficient 
physical activity has been shown to be associated with increased 
risk of weight gain, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart dis-
ease.[10] Therefore, there is a chance that college students would 
develop chronic illnesses in the future, which will be expensive 
for the family and society.[11–13] College students mental health

issues are particularly severe due to their changing living condi-
tions and mounting academic pressure, and they are becoming 
a  major  global  public  health  concern.[14,15] A  study  found  that 
among American college students, the incidence rate of depres-
sion (DEP) was 17.3%, the incidence rate of panic disorder was 
4.1%, the incidence rate of anxiety (ANX) disorder was 7.0%, 
and the suicide thought accounted for 6.3%.[16] The psycholog-
ical health problems of Russian college students, such as ANX 
and DEP, are also particularly serious.[17] Serious mental health 
problems may lead to college students dropping out of school, 
committing suicide or other dangerous behaviors.[18] However, 
college students with mental health problems have not received 
enough  attention  from  universities  and  society.[19]  We  need  to 
find  an  effective  way  to  promote  their  physical  and  mental 
health.[20] A study has proved that insufficient physical activity of 
college students can reduce their physical and mental health.[21] 
Therefore, strengthening physical exercise and physical activity 
may  have  a  positive  impact  on  college  students  psychological 
distress.[22]  Baduanjin  is  one  of  the  most  popular  versions  of 
Qigong in China, which is believed to have a history of at least 
800 years.[23] The exercise intensity and sequence of Baduanjin 
conform  to  the  laws  of  human  kinematics  and  physiology.  It 
belongs to aerobic exercise and is safe and reliable.[24] The char-
acteristics  of  the  Baduanjin  Movement  are  mainly  reflected  in 
several aspects, such as softness, combination of movement and 
stillness, combination of spirit and form, and the presence of Qi. 
Unlike traditional aerobic exercise or resistance exercise train-
ing, which only focuses on the body, Qigong Baduanjin aims to 

integrate the body and soul and achieve the coordinated devel-
opment of the body, mind and soul.[25] However, it is unknown 
how  Qigong  Baduanjin  practice  may  affect  college  students 
health. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of 
Qigong Baduanjin on the physical and mental health of female 
college freshmen.

2. Materials and method

2.1. Study design

This is a randomized, parallel, controlled experiment conducted 
from February 2019 to May 2019. As shown in Figures 1, 78 
qualified subjects were randomly assigned to Baduanjin group or 
control group. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee 
of Sports medicine School of Anshan Normal University.

The students in the Baduanjin group completed 12 weeks of 
Baduanjin exercises, while the students in the control group were 
asked to maintain their current lifestyle during the study. At the 
baseline and at the end of the 12-week intervention, the subjects 
body  shape,  physical  function,  physical  fitness,  somatization 
(SOM),  obsession,  interpersonal  sensitivity  (INT),  DEP, ANX, 
hostility, fear ANX, paranoia, and psychosis were assessed.

2.2. Participant

39 participants in the Qigong group and 39 participants in the 
control group completed the entire 12-week experimental study. 

Figure 1.  Total 83 participants were recruited. Due to health problems, 5 participants were excluded, and only 78 participants were randomly divided into the 
Baduanjin qigong group and the control group, with 39 participants in each group. Five participants in the Baduanjin qigong group were excluded because they 
failed to complete 12 wk of Baduanjin qigong exercise. After the test, there were 34 people left in the Baduanjin qigong group and 39 people left in the control 
group.

Participants  were  recruited  through  the  campus  poster  from 
December 9 to December 19, 2018.

The inclusion criteria are:

 (1)  18 to 20 years old.
 (2)  Freshman.
 (3)  The participant has not practiced Baduanjin or other qigong 

or Tai Chi before.

 (4)  Those with exercise contraindications, musculoskeletal dis-
eases, and severe cardiovascular diseases are not allowed to 
participate in this study.

All participants signed an informed consent form before the 

start of the study.

2.3. Intervention

2.3.1.  Control  group.  Participants  in  the  control  group  were 
told  to  maintain  their  original  lifestyle  during  the  12-week 
intervention period during the study.

2.3.2. Qigong Baduanjin group.  From February 2019 to May 
2019,  the  Qigong  Baduanjin  course  was  12  weeks,  3  days  a 
week,  and  1  hour  a  day.  Each  lesson  includes  10  minutes  of 
warm-up,  40  minutes  of  Qigong  Baduanjin  exercises  and  10 
minutes  of  cooling  time.  A  coach  who  has  been  in  Qigong 
Baduanjin teaching for 7 years teaches students Baduanjin. The 
Qigong Baduanjin exercise program is formulated on the basis 
of  the  Qigong  Baduanjin  program  issued  by  the  China  Sports 
Bureau, including 8 individual poses.

  1.  Hold the sky with both hands to adjust the triple focus.
  2.  Bow left and right like shooting eagles.
  3.  To regulate the spleen and stomach must be single lifted.
  4.  Look back to treat damaged organs.
  5.  Shake  your  head  and  tail  to  get  rid  of  psychological 

pressure.

  6.  Climbing feet with both hands to strengthen the kidney 

and waist.

  7.  Grow fists to increase strength.
  8.  Behind the 7 tiptoes to eliminate all diseases.

As  a  baseline  and  outcomes  survey,  2  measurements  and 
surveys were performed on all subjects. The research assistant 
collected  and  input  the  data  of  this  research,  but  the  research 
assistant did not know the group assignments during the whole 
research process.

2.4. Randomization and blinding

The  random  number  is  randomly  generated  by  the  software, 
printed out, put in an opaque envelope, and opened when each 
subject agrees to participate. This task is performed by research 
assistants who are not involved in the recruitment to ensure that 
the  assigned  numbers  are  hidden.  Participants  were  randomly 
divided into Qigong Baduanjin group or control group at a ratio 
of 1:1. After evaluating their baseline measurements, the study 
leader contacted qualified participants by phone to inform them 
of the next tasks. Although it is impossible to prevent the par-
ticipant from meeting the Qigong Baduanjin coach, the partic-
ipant and the Baduanjin coach still have no knowledge of the 
evaluation results.

2.5. Measures

Measurement of body shape was as follows: the indices of body 
shape measured included body height, weight, body mass index 
(BMI), chest circumference.

The measurement of physical function is as follows: The mea-
sured indicators include blood pressure, vital capacity (VC), VC 

3

index (the ratio of VC to body weight), Stange test and Genchi 
test.

The VC of the lungs describes not only the level of function-
ality of the external respiratory system but also the power and 
control  of  the  respiratory  muscles.  Using  a  dry  portable  SPP 
(ZhongTiTongFang, China) spirometer, the VC of the lungs was 
measured. The  patient  inhales  and  exhales  after  taking  1  to  2 
deep  breaths.  Next,  he  takes  his  deepest  breath  while  holding 
the  mouthpiece  in  his  mouth  and  evenly  exhales  the  most  air 
into  the  spirometer. You  shouldn’t  hurry  or  force  the  individ-
ual  to  exhale. The  exhale  should  last  4  to  8  seconds  at  most. 
During the study of the tidal volume, the examinee must hold 
the spirometer by the body so as not to impede the free exit of 
air from the device. The scale of the spirometer determines VC 
in liters. The measurement of VC is carried out 3 times, and the 
arithmetic mean is calculated.

VC index = VC (mL)/body weight (kg)
Hypoxic tests make it possible to assess the adaptation of a 
person to hypoxia and hypoxemia. Genchi test - registration of 
breath holding time after maximum  expiration. The subject is 
asked to take a deep breath, then exhale as much as possible, 
hold his breath, holding his nose and mouth. The time of hold-
ing  the  breath  between  inhalation  and  exhalation  is  recorded. 
Stange test records the time of holding the breath during a deep 
breath. The subject is asked to inhale, exhale, then inhale at the 
level of 85% to 95% of the maximum. By closing your mouth 
and holding your nose, you exhale. The breath holding time is 
recorded.

The physical fitness was measured as follows: the measured 
indicators  include  balance  (Stand  on  1  leg  with  closed  eyes), 
flexibility  (standing  bending),  leg  strength  (squatting),  and 
abdominal muscle strength (Sit-ups) tests. Stand on 1 leg with 
closed eyes: The technique of the test is as follows, standing on 
the left leg without shoes, bend the right one, put the foot on 
the knee, hands along the body, close your eyes. The duration of 
maintaining balance is recorded. Carry out without preliminary 
preparation, the best result of 3 attempts is taken into account 
with an interval of 1 to 2 minutes. Standing bending: The par-
ticipant stood on the measuring table with her feet together, her 
toes spaced about 5 cm apart, and her toes flush with the edge 
of the measuring table while the test was being conducted. The 
arms  are  then  progressively  extended  along  the  ruler  with  the 
upper torso arched forward until they cease moving. Squatting: 
Count  how  many  squats  the  person  does  in  the  span  of  30 
seconds.  This  physical  fitness  exam  assesses  the  stamina  and 
strength of the legs. Sit-ups: Before the test, the mat is set up at 
the testing location. When the subject is ready, they can lie down 
with their legs bent. Click on the stopwatch, the test will start, 
the test will end in 1 minute, and the number of completions will 
be recorded. Note: Feet should be on the mat.

Mental  health  was  measured  using  the  symptom  check-
list-90  (SCL90)  scale.[26]  SOM,  obsessive-compulsive  disorder 
(OS), INT, DEP, ANX, hostility, phobia (PHOB), paranoia, and 
psychosis  are  among  the  9  basic  symptom  disorders  that  are 
assessed. The SCL scale, which has a total of 90 points, evalu-
ates the signs of alterations in people mental health. Each of the 
90 questions is scored on a 5-point scale (0–4), with 0 represent-
ing “not at all” and 4 representing “extremely strong.”

2.6. Statistical analysis

Software  tools  from  IBM,  Chicago,  IL,  called  SPSS  21.0 
were used for the analyses. Two-sided P values of <.05 were 
used  to  determine  statistical  significance.  Continuous  vari-
ables were reported as mean and standard deviation for nor-
mal  distribution  in  the  descriptive  analysis  of  the  sample, 
and as median and interquartile range for non-normal dis-
tribution. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to assess 
normality.  In  situations  involving  non-normal  distribution, 

Zhang and Jiang  •  Medicine (2023) 102:34 

Medicine

the  proper  transformations  were  used.  The  proportions  of 
categorical  variables  were  given  together  with  their  stan-
dard  errors. The  t  test  or  Mann–Whitney  test  was  used  to 
compare  baseline  characteristics  between  groups,  while 
Pearson  chi-squared  or  Fisher  exact  test  was  used  to  com-
pare  baseline  characteristics  for  categorical  variables.  A  t 
test  or  nonparametric  test  was  employed  for  continuous 
variables  and  Pearson  chi-squared  or  Fisher  exact  test  for 
categorical  variables  to  compare  the  primary  or  secondary 
outcomes between groups.

3.2. Comparison of body shape indices

After 12 weeks of randomized controlled trial, in the Baduanjin 
group there were no significant changes in height and chest cir-
cumference. Compared with the control group, the weight and 
BMI of the Baduanjin group decreased, which was statistically 
significant  (weight:  control  group  58.21 ± 11.32,  Baduanjin 
54.08 ± 9.26, P < .05; BMI: control group 22.68 ± 4.56, baduan-
jin  19.59 ± 3.65,  P  <  .05).  Compared  with  the  control  group, 
other body shape indexes of Baduanjin group had no significant 
difference (P > .05) (Table 2).

3. Results

3.1. Characteristics and participants

Figure 1 depicts how participants moved through the study. The 
sample included 83 participants between the ages of 18 and 20, 
with  an  average  age  of  19.2  years  because  the  trial  disquali-
fied  5  persons  with  potential  cardiovascular  system  problems. 
These 78 individuals are in good health, do not have any skele-
tal or cardiovascular conditions that would limit their ability to 
exercise, and do not regularly engage in Qigong or other forms 
of similar physical activity. Due to their dislike of routine and 
group  approaches,  2  participants  left  the  Qigong  Baduanjin 
intervention. Without explanation, 3 individuals left the Qigong 
Baduanjin  intervention.  The  completion  rate  for  the  physical 
measurement and questionnaire survey was 100% for the con-
trol group and 86.8% for the Qigong Baduanjin group (Fig. 1).
At  baseline,  there  was  no  significant  difference  between  the 
Baduanjin group and the control group in terms of demographic 
characteristics, body shape indicators, physical function indica-
tors,  physical  fitness  indicators  and  mental  health  indicators 
(Tables 1).

3.3. Comparison of body function index

After  12  weeks  of  randomized  controlled  trial,  compared 
with  the  control  group, VC  (Control  group  2987.13 ± 115.45, 
Baduanjin group 3415.66 ± 136.67), VC index (Control group 
51.25 ± 4.27,  Baduanjin  group  63.35 ± 4.27),  Stange 
test 
(Control  group  32.15 ± 2.14,  Baduanjin  group  42.56 ± 2.71) 
and Genchi test (Control group 23.68 ± 2.45, Baduanjin group 
29.45 ± 1.19)  of  the  Baduanjin  group  increased,  which  was 
statistically  significant  (P  <  .05). The  Diastolic  blood  pressure 
(Control  group  75.42 ± 2.56,  Baduanjin  70.14 ± 3.34)  and 
Systolic blood pressure (control group 119.58 ± 5.63, Baduanjin 
group  109.36 ± 4.12)  of  participants  in  Baduanjin  group 
decreased significantly (Table 3).

3.4. Comparison of physical fitness index

After  12  weeks  of  randomized  controlled  trial,  by  comparing 
the physical fitness indicators of the subjects, it was found that 
the  results  of  Stand  on  1  leg  with  closed  eyes  (Control  group 
18.68 ± 8.75,  Baduanjin  group  28.31 ± 7.32),  Standing  bends 
(Control group 7.17 ± 0.58, Baduanjin group 11.67 ± 1.13) and 
Squats  (Control  group  23.68 ± 2.45,  Baduanjin  29.45 ± 1.19) 
of the Baduanjin group were significantly improved (P < .05). 
However, the control group did not show such changes (Table 4).

group  1.05 ± 0.57,  Baduanjin  group  0.78 ± 0.03),  INT 
(Control  group  1.03 ± 0.60,  Baduanjin  group  0.95 ± 0.53),  
DEP (Control group 085 ± 0.38, Baduanjin group 0.52 ± 0.32), 
ANX (Control group 0.73 ± 038, Baduanjin group 0.58 ± 0.45) 
and  PHOB  (Control  group  0.51 ± 0.30,  Baduanjin  group 
0.32 ± 0.24)  in  Qigong  Baduanjin  group  were  significantly 
reduced compared with the control group (P < .05). However, 
the control group did not show such changes (Table 5).

4. Discussion

Baduanjin is a Qigong exercise method originated from ancient 
China,  with  a  long  history  and  profound  cultural  heritage. 
Qigong Baduanjin is a set of simple, easy to learn and effective 
health preserving exercises, which aims to regulate qi and blood, 
dredge meridians, enhance physique and prevent diseases.[23] The 
movement design of Qigong Baduanjin is simple and clear, which 
is suitable for people of all ages and physical conditions. In mod-
ern society, qigong Baduanjin, as a simple and practical method 
of  health  preservation,  has  been  loved  and  concerned  by  more 
and  more  people.[24]  In  this  randomized  controlled  trial  of  the 
effects of Qigong Baduanjin on the physical and mental health of 
students, compared with the control group, at the end of the 12 
week intervention, the weight, BMI, diastolic blood pressure, sys-
tolic blood pressure, SOM score, obsessive-compulsive disorder 
score, INT score, DEP score, ANX score and phobic ANX score

control group, the VC, VC index, Stand test, Genchi test, Stand 
on  1  leg  with  closed  eyes,  Standing  bonds,  Squats  and  Sit  ups 
of  the  Baduanjin  group  have  been  significantly  improved. This 
shows  that  compared  with  other  exercises,  Baduanjin  exercise 
has advantages in improving female college students body shape 
(weight and BMI), cardiovascular and respiratory functions, flex-
ibility, balance ability, muscle endurance and mental health.

Weight and height are key overall indicators reflecting human 
development.  These  indicators  will  be  affected  by  many  fac-
tors, such as target gender, living conditions, age and physical 
exercise.[27] Our research results show that compared with the 
control  group,  the  weight  and  BMI  of  female  students  in  the 
Qigong  Baduanjin  group  decreased  significantly,  which  indi-
cates  that  12  weeks  of  Baduanjin  exercise  can  significantly 
reduce the weight and BMI of female students. A previous study 
by Liu T et al also supports this result.[28] They recruited 40 mid-
dle-aged  female  obese  diabetes  patients,  aged  57.2 ± 5.4  years, 
and  randomly  divided  them  into  control  group  and  exercise 
group. The Qigong Baduanjin group had 24 weeks of Qigong 
Baduanjin intervention, exercising for 90 minutes every day for 
6  days  every  week,  while  the  control  group  did  not  have  any 
exercise. The results showed that the waist circumference, waist 
hip ratio, BMI and blood sugar of obese women in the Qigong 
Baduanjin group were significantly lower than those 24 weeks 
ago.  The  study  concluded  that  long-term  Qigong  Baduanjin 
exercise could reduce some obesity and blood sugar indicators 
of obese women with diabetes. A previous study by Jin J et al 
also  believed  that  Qigong  Baduanjin  can  effectively  improve 
body shape.[29] They recruited 90 patients with metabolic syn-
drome and randomly divided them into test group and control 
group, with 45 patients in each group. The routine drug treat-
ment of the patients in the 2 groups remained unchanged. On 
this basis, the patients in the Baduanjin group were treated with 
Qigong  Baduanjin  exercise  intervention,  while  the  patients  in 
the  control  group  were  given  the  original  daily  activities. The 
results showed that after 3 months of Qigong Baduanjin inter-
vention, the weight and abdominal circumference of patients in 
Baduanjin  group  decreased  significantly  compared  with  those 
before intervention (P < .05), while the weight and abdominal 
circumference  of  the  control  group  did  not  improve  signifi-
cantly  (P  >  .05). The  study  concluded  that  Qigong  Baduanjin 
exercise  can  reduce  the  weight  and  abdominal  circumference 
of  patients  with  metabolic  syndrome.  One  study  shows  that 
Baduanjin  exercise  can  increase  the  secretion  of  catechol  glue 
hormones and enhance the lipolysis of adipose tissue.[30] Long 
term  regular  Baduanjin  exercise  can  improve  the  basic  meta-
bolic  rate  in  a  quiet  state,  increase  energy  consumption,  and 
affect energy intake.[31] Another study confirmed that Baduanjin

exercise would increase the oxidation of fat, increase the mus-
cle  weight,  reduce  the  percentage  of  body  fat,  and  prevent  fat 
accumulation.[32] Qigong Baduanjin belongs to aerobic exercise, 
and its intensity and sequence of exercise conform to the laws of 
human kinematics, which is safe and reliable.[33] The characteris-
tics of Baduanjin Movement are mainly embodied in the aspects 
of tenderness, the combination of movement and stillness, the 
combination of spirit and shape, and the existence of qi.[34] Long 
time practice of Qigong Baduanjin can increase the oxidation of 
fat, increase muscle weight, reduce the percentage of body fat, 
and prevent fat accumulation.[35] Therefore, Qigong Baduanjin 
exercise  can  change  body  type  indicators,  such  as  weight  and 
BMI.

Baduanjin  exercise  is  a  kind  of  traditional  Qigong  used  in 
China.  Not  only  is  Qigong  Baduanjin  simple  to  learn,  but  it 
also calls very little mental effort. In China, it is regarded as a 
well-liked kind of group exercise to boost health.[36] A healthy 
individual is defined by traditional Chinese medicine as having 
a balanced and coordinated body and soul.[37] The advantage of 
regular Baduanjin exercise is to make the spirit and breath more 
harmonious  and  unified  by  regulating  the  breath,  strengthen 
the  cardiovascular  system  and  respiratory  system  functions, 
and make the body more flexible and the body and mind more 
coordinated.[38] Our research shows that Baduanjin exercise can 
significantly improve the blood pressure, VC, VC index, Stange 
test and Genchi test of students who perform Baduanjin exer-
cise. This shows that practicing Baduanjin exercise for 12 weeks 
can change cardiovascular and pulmonary functions. A previous 
study by Ma C et al supports this result.[39] They recruited 136 
patients with chronic heart failure and evaluated the effects of 
Baduanjin elastic band on the exercise ability, physical function, 
upper  and  lower  limb  muscle  strength,  quality  of  life  (QoL) 
and exercise self-efficacy of patients with chronic heart failure. 
136 patients with chronic heart failure were randomly assigned 
to  exercise  group  or  control  group. The  patients  with  chronic 
heart  failure  in  the  exercise  group  received  community  care 
of  Baduanjin  elastic  band  and  chronic  heart  failure,  while  the 
control group received community care of chronic heart failure. 
The duration of the intervention was 24 weeks. The study con-
cluded that Baduanjin combined with elastic band exercise can 
improve the physical function, QoL and exercise self-efficacy of 
patients with chronic heart failure at home, and Baduanjin may 
be  a  supplementary  exercise  mode  to  improve  the  cardiovas-
cular system function of patients with chronic heart failure. A 
previous study by Zheng L et al also supports this result.[40] They 
recruited  67  elderly  patients  with  hypertension  and  asthenia, 
and evaluated the effect of Qigong Baduanjin on elderly patients 
with hypertension and asthenia. 67 elderly patients with hyper-
tension  and  asthenia  were  randomly  divided  into  intervention 
group (33 cases) and control group (34 cases). The patients in 
the control group received routine treatment and health educa-
tion, and the patients in the intervention group received Qigong 
Baduanjin  intervention  on  the  basis  of  routine  treatment  and 
health  education  for  12  weeks.  The  results  showed  that  after 
12  weeks  of  intervention,  the  asthenia  score,  systolic  blood 
pressure and diastolic blood pressure in the intervention group 
were  significantly  lower  than  those  in  the  control  group  (P  < 
.05). The study concluded that Baduanjin Qigong can improve 
the debilitating condition of elderly patients with hypertension 
accompanied by debility, reduce blood pressure and improve the 
QoL. Both this study and the above studies show that Qigong 
Baduanjin exercise can improve human body functions, such as 
cardiovascular  and  pulmonary  functions.  Traditional  Chinese 
medicine  believes  that  insufficient  body  qi  will  cause  ischemic 
heart  disease,  and  stagnation  of  blood  circulation  will  block 
the meridians, thus reducing the function of cardiovascular sys-
tem and respiratory system.[41] Qigong Baduanjin is an exercise 
method  that  combines  breathing,  physical  exercise,  and  medi-
tation. In qigong practice, practitioners are usually required to 

take  deep  breaths,  that  is,  slowly  and  deeply  inhale,  and  then 
slowly  and  thoroughly  exhale.[24] This  deep  breathing  exercise 
helps to improve VC, strengthen the strength of Muscles of res-
piration, and improve the efficiency of oxygen intake. The body 
movements  and  breathing  techniques  in  qigong  practice  can 
promote blood circulation in the lungs, which helps improve the 
function of the respiratory system and immunity.[25] Baduanjin 
exercise  can  strengthen  the  blood  circulation  of  the  internal 
organs, thus promoting the circulation of qi (“qi” means vital-
ity).  If  the  circulation  of  qi  is  smooth,  the  function  of  human 
cardiovascular  system  will  be  improved.[42]  When  practicing 
Qigong Baduanjin, subjects use a unified way of movement and 
breathing techniques to stimulate the cardiovascular system and 
enhance  the  strength  of  respiratory  muscles,  which  is  also  the 
reason  why  Baduanjin  exercise  can  improve  the  cardiovascu-
lar and pulmonary functions of the human body.[43] During the 
practice  of  Qigong  Baduanjin,  the  human  body  increases  the 
deep breathing diaphragm, increases the chest volume, and then 
reduces the heart pressure, has a certain massage effect on the 
heart,  and  enhances  the  blood  circulation  function.[44]  During 
the practice of Qigong Baduanjin, the chest cavity of the human 
body increases and decreases regularly, stimulating the respira-
tory muscles, strengthening the strength of the respiratory mus-
cles, enhancing the endurance and flexibility of the respiratory 
muscles, so as to improve the functional level of the respiratory 
muscles, and thus improve the function of the respiratory sys-
tem.[45] Therefore, practicing Baduanjin can improve the cardio-
vascular function and respiratory system function of the human 
body.

The  results  of  this  study  showed  that  the  performance  of 
Baduanjin  group  in  standing  with  eyes  closed,  standing  bent 
and  squatting  was  significantly  improved  compared  with  the 
control  group  (P  <  .05).  This  shows  that  Qigong  Baduanjin 
can  significantly  improve  the  balance,  flexibility  and  muscle 
endurance of the human body. The results of this study showed 
that the performance of Baduanjin group in standing with eyes 
closed, standing bends and squatting was significantly improved 
compared  with  the  control  group  (P  <  .05).  This  shows  that 
Qigong  Baduanjin  can  significantly  improve  the  balance  and 
muscle endurance of the human body. The previous research of 
Su Y et al supports this result.[46] Their research concluded that 
8 weeks of Qigong Baduanjin exercise has a positive impact on 
the  physical  quality  and  physical  function  of  female  students. 
Previous studies by Zhou L et al also support this result.[47] Their 
research  results  showed  that  compared  with  the  conventional 
treatment  group,  the  lower  limb  muscle  strength  and  balance 
ability of patients in the Qigong Baduanjin group were signifi-
cantly  improved.  Previous  studies  by  Li  M  et  al  also  support 
this result.[48] Their research concluded that Qigong Baduanjin 
exercise  is  more  effective  than  traditional  exercise  methods  in 
improving  college  students  cardiopulmonary  function,  flexi-
bility  and  muscle  strength.  Body  flexibility,  balance  and  mus-
cle  strength  play  an  important  role  in  physical  health.  The 
increase of body flexibility can improve speed, physical strength 
and body coordination.[49] In the first 4 movements of Qigong 
Baduanjin, the spine can be extended and rotated up and down, 
left and right. This can not only stretch the muscles, ligaments 
and  joints  around  the  trunk  and  upper  limb  joints,  but  also 
train the small joints and muscles between the vertebrae in the 
spine,  thus  increasing  the  flexibility,  flexibility  and  stability  of 
the  practitioner  body.[50]  In  the  last  4  movements  of  Qigong 
Baduanjin, the lower limb muscle strength and endurance have 
been fully exercised, which will improve the muscle strength and 
endurance of the practitioner. Research shows that lower limb 
strength is positively related to balance ability, which is also the 
reason  why  Baduanjin  exercise  can  improve  the  balance  abil-
ity of the human body.[51] Therefore, the exercise of Baduanjin 
can improve the flexibility, balance and flexibility of the human 
body.

Baduanjin  exercise  can  be  described  as  the  combination  of 
Chinese  philosophy  and  traditional  Chinese  medicine.[52]  The 
key  point  of  practice  is  considered  to  be  the  adjustment  of 
human  spirit.  Therefore,  when  practicing  Baduanjin  exercise, 
you need to eliminate distractions and concentrate on a certain 
area of your body to feel the silkiness of the 8 section brocade 
movement.[53]  By  practicing  Qigong  Baduanjin,  we  can  dispel 
distractions, obtain spiritual nourishment and improve mental 
health.  The  results  of  this  study  showed  that  after  12  weeks 
of  randomized  controlled  trial,  the  scores  of  SOM,  OS,  INT, 
DEP, ANX,  and  PHOB  in  Qigong  Baduanjin  group  were  sig-
nificantly lower than those in the control group (P < .05). The 
previous  research  of  Jing  L  et  al  supports  this  result.[54] Their 
research concluded that Qigong Baduanjin combined with cog-
nitive behavioral therapy can significantly improve the physical 
and  psychological  conditions  of  the  elderly  at  home. A  previ-
ous study by Bai Z et al supports this result.[55] They evaluated 
the  effect  of  Qigong  Baduanjin  exercise  on  the  psychological 
problems (such as DEP, ANX and sleep quality) of lung cancer 
patients. They recruited 52 patients with lung cancer and ran-
domly divided them into control group (n = 26) and Baduanjin 
group  (n  =  26). The  Baduanjin  group  received  comprehensive 
intervention of health education and health Qigong Baduanjin, 
while  the  sham  control  group  received  only  health  education 
intervention. The DEP and anxiety symptoms and sleep quality 
of patients before and after intervention were investigated with 
Self  Rating  Depression  Scale  (SDS),  Self  Rating Anxiety  Scale 
(SAS)  and  Pittsburgh  Sleep  Quality  Index  (PSQI).  The  results 
showed  that  the  DEP  scores  and  ANX  scores  of  patients  in 
Baduanjin group were significantly lower than those in the con-
trol group. The study concluded that Qigong Baduanjin exercise 
can alleviate the DEP, ANX and other mental health problems 
of lung cancer patients. Most movements of Qigong Baduanjin 
should  be  gentle,  calm  and  smooth.  When  practicing  Qigong 
Baduanjin, it is important to relax the body and keep the mind 
calm. Must imagine yourself as flowing water or clouds. In the 
process  of  practicing  Qigong  Baduanjin,  you  should  integrate 
your  spirit  and  exercise  to  achieve  a  harmonious  balance  of 
body  and  mind.[56]  Traditional  Chinese  medicine  believes  that 
when the qi and blood in the body cannot work normally, peo-
ple will show negative emotions and mental disorders, such as 
stress and DEP.[57] The practice of Qigong Baduanjin can stim-
ulate the movement of qi and blood in the human body, so that 
they  can  return  to  normal  work,  thus  relieving  people  nega-
tive  emotions  and  mental  disorders. Traditional  Chinese  med-
icine  also  believes  that  human  chest  and  abdomen  organs  are 
related to emotion and spirit.[58] When the internal organs of the 
machine cannot work normally, people will also show negative 
emotions and mental disorders. When the practitioner practices 
the Baduanjin movement, the chest and abdominal organs are 
stretched, which has a certain massage effect on the chest and 
abdominal organs.[59] Massage can promote the blood circula-
tion and metabolism of chest and abdomen organs, and restore 
them  to  normal  functions,  thus  solving  mental  health  prob-
lems.[60] Therefore, Qigong Baduanjin has positive effects on the 
mental, emotional, and social functions of the practitioners

5. Conclusion

In this study, we carefully designed a randomized controlled trial 
to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  and  safety  of  college  female  stu-
dents practicing Qigong Baduanjin. Compared with the control 
group, at the end of the 12 week intervention, the weight, BMI, 
diastolic  blood  pressure,  systolic  blood  pressure,  SOM  score, 
obsessive-compulsive disorder score, INT score, DEP score, ANX 
score and phobic ANX score of Baduanjin group decreased sig-
nificantly. Compared with the control group, the VC, Stange test 
and  Genchi  test,  Standing  bends  and  Squats  of  the  Baduanjin 
group  have  been  significantly  improved. Therefore,  the  Qigong 

7

Baduanjin exercise seems to be an effective means to improve the 
physical and mental health of college students.

6. Limitations of the study

We  acknowledge  that  this  randomized  controlled  trial  study 
has  some  limitations.  First  of  all,  because  the  sample  size 
for  this  randomized  controlled  trial  was  so  small,  it  is  neces-
sary to expand the sample size in future research. Second, the 
amount  and  type  of  daily  exercise  in  the  control  group  were 
not restricted, despite the long-term regular practice of qigong 
or Taijiquan being excluded. Therefore, it possible that the par-
ticipants  in  both  groups  engaged  in  frequent  physical  activity 
like skating, basketball, jogging, or football, which could have 
an  impact  on  the  differences  between  the  comparison  groups. 
Third, only 12 weeks of Qigong Baduanjin exercise are included 
in  this  randomized  controlled  trial  intervention,  which  may 
not be long enough to demonstrate all of the beneficial effects 
of  Qigong  Baduanjin.  Future  research  should  include  longer 
Qigong Baduanjin exercise intervention time.
