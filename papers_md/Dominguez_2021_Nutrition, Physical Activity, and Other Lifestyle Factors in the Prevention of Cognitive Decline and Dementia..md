Abstract: Multiple factors combined are currently recognized as contributors to cognitive decline.
The main independent risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia is advanced age followed
by other determinants such as genetic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors, including nutrition
and physical activity. In the next decades, a rise in dementia cases is expected due largely to the
aging of the world population. There are no hitherto effective pharmaceutical therapies to treat
age-associated cognitive impairment and dementia, which underscores the crucial role of prevention.
A relationship among diet, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors with cognitive function has
been intensively studied with mounting evidence supporting the role of these determinants in
the development of cognitive decline and dementia, which is a chief cause of disability globally.
Several dietary patterns, foods, and nutrients have been investigated in this regard, with some
encouraging and other disappointing results. This review presents the current evidence for the
effects of dietary patterns, dietary components, some supplements, physical activity, sleep patterns,
and social engagement on the prevention or delay of the onset of age-related cognitive decline
and dementia.

1. Introduction

We are living in an aging world. Currently, most humans worldwide may expect
to live beyond 60 years [1], while demographic data foresee that half of children alive in
2010 in nations with the highest life expectancies would be centenarians [2]. However,
this optimistic scenario can be shadowed by the numerous people that would be affected
with age-associated cognitive decline, which is a chief cause of disability worldwide [3,4].
About forty-seven million people have dementia worldwide with an estimated eight
million new diagnoses every year. The most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), vascular dementia, and mixed forms [3–5]. Currently, there is no effective
treatment that may signiﬁcantly modify the course of dementia [5,6]. Brain pathological
changes seem to initiate long before clinical manifestations, which mostly occur in old
age. This provides a large period of time to implement prevention strategies effectively
delaying age-related cognitive decline and dementia, which is a major public health concern.
However, there is no solid evidence supporting a role for pharmacological therapies (i.e.,
anti-inﬂammatory medications, estrogen/progestin supplementation, antihypertensives,
antidiabetics, dementia medications) in the prevention of cognitive decline in persons

with preserved cognitive function or with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) according
to a systematic review of ﬁfty-one trials [7]. The evidence is not yet solid for cognitive
training examined in a systematic review of eleven trials [8] and on exercise in a systematic
review including sixteen trials [9]. Conversely, a multidomain intervention including diet,
cognitive training, and physical activity reported signiﬁcant improvements in a range of
cognitive outcomes [10].

The interest on dietary and nutritional components as potential modiﬁable factors
for postponing the onset and severity of age-related cognitive function deterioration has
grown in recent decades [11]. In fact, unhealthy diet seems to be a key risk factor. This is
exempliﬁed by the fact that during Japan’s nutrition transition from the traditional Japanese
diet to the Western diet, AD rates rose from 1% in 1985 to 7% in 2008 [12]. The antioxidant
and anti-inﬂammatory actions of various minerals, micronutrients, and vitamins in regard
to cognitive function have been studied [13] as well as components of neuronal membranes,
e.g., dietary essential fatty acids [14,15]. Several studies on single or multi-component
supplements suggest biological plausibility for the cognitive effects of these preparations,
but they do not show solid evidence of these effects [16]. Lately, nutrition research has
moved from focusing attention only on single nutrients and foods to investigating dietary
patterns based on the notion that combinations of foods and nutrients can have synergistic
and/or antagonistic effects beyond single components [17].

It has been calculated that about 3% of all dementia cases could be prevented by
increasing levels of physical activity [18,19]. Likewise, an increasing number of studies
have emerged indicating the importance of physical activity and exercise for the prevention
of the pathological process and complications of dementia [20].

In this narrative review, we examine updated evidence of the effects of dietary patterns,
dietary components, and supplements on cognitive function decline and dementia. We also
review some non-dietary lifestyle factors (i.e., physical activity/exercise, sleep quality,
and socialization), which can contribute in association with dietary factors. We included
systematic reviews with or without formal meta-analysis of intervention or observational
studies dealing with dietary and non-dietary factors as exposure and cognitive and other
related parameters as outcomes. We will also brieﬂy review possible mechanisms that may
help explain potential beneﬁts.

2. Dietary Patterns

Several food combinations in speciﬁc dietary patterns have been studied in regard
to cognitive decline from MCI to dementia in various contexts with some exhibiting
favorable results and others showing no evidence of such effects. Indeed, a multinutrient
approach seems to better support outcomes than single nutrient intervention [17]. Although
there is no single dietary intervention that has been deﬁnitely proven in randomized
control trials (RCTs) to effectively prevent cognitive deterioration and dementia, data from
epidemiological studies suggest that following a healthy, balanced diet and lifestyle, which
has been conﬁrmed to reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk, may also help with preventing or
delaying the onset of AD [21–23].

2.1. Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet)

This dietary pattern that has been traditionally followed for centuries by populations
from the Mediterranean countries has been intensely studied in prospective observational
studies and trials conducted in Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries with
different health outcomes. This extensive evidence supports its beneﬁcial action on the
prevention of several non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cognitive decline and
dementia [24–26].

A systematic review of prospective cohort studies reported that participants with the
highest adherence to the MedDiet vs. those with lowest adherence had a 33% lower risk
of developing MCI or AD [27]. In the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterranea)
trial, among adults (aged 55 to 80 years) at high CV risk, those following a MedDiet supple-

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

mented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts had a reduced incidence of CV events,
which are a known risk factor for cognitive decline, compared to participants following a
low-fat diet over 5 years of follow-up [28]. In sub-analyses of this trial, an improvement
in cognitive function with the MedDiet supplemented with either EVOO or nuts vs. a
low-fat diet has been reported [29,30]. In prospective longitudinal studies conducted in
the USA [31–35] and France [36,37], a higher adherence to a MedDiet was associated with
slower cognitive decline and incident AD. Some reviews [24,38] suggested that there is
some evidence showing that following a MedDiet is associated with a reduced risk of
developing AD, but that still extensive conﬁrmation in different populations and ethnicities
is necessary. There are also some conﬂicting results. For example, an Australian cohort
of healthy adults in The Personality and Total Health (PATH) through Life longitudinal
study did not ﬁnd any protection of the MedDiet for cognitive decline [39], while another
Australian study, the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study [40],
reported that patients with MCI or AD had lower adherence to the MedDiet when com-
pared to healthy controls. Tangney et al. evaluated adherence to the Healthy Eating Index
(HEI)-2005 or to the MedDiet in regard to cognitive function modiﬁcations in 3790 over-65
adults followed for seven years from the Chicago Health and Aging Project longitudinal
study. They observed that higher MedDiet adherence scores were associated with slower
rates of cognitive decline, after adjusting for confounders, but no association was observed
for HEI-2005 scores [41]. Table 1 shows the summary of systematic reviews and meta-
analyses exploring the association of adherence to the MedDiet with cognitive decline
and/or incident dementia. As mentioned, the MedDiet is the dietary pattern with the
highest number of studies published hitherto in the medical literature.

Noteworthy, the MedDiet comprises several other lifestyle parameters, such as phys-
ical activity, social engagement, culinary activities, and adequate rest [42], which have
shown positive effects on delaying cognitive function deterioration. Therefore, it is cru-
cial to include these other lifestyle factors when evaluating the MedDiet and cognitive
performance decline.

Highest tertile of the MedDiet adherence was associated with less risk of
cognitive impairment (MCI or AD) vs. the lowest tertile. In cognitively normal
individuals, higher adherence to the MedDiet was associated with a reduced risk
of MCI (HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56–0.96) and AD (HR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46–0.89).

MedDiet was signiﬁcantly associated with reduced incident dementia (RR: 0.69;
95% CI: 0.57, 0.84).

The highest MedDiet score was inversely associated with the developing of
cognitive disorders vs. the lowest category (pooled RR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.90).
Median category of adherence was not signiﬁcantly associated with cognitive
disorders. Dose–response analysis indicated a trend of linear association of
MedDiet score with the incident risk of cognitive disorders.

Meta-analysis of cohort studies showed a signiﬁcant association of
MedDiet with episodic memory and global cognition but not working
memory or semantic memory.
Meta-analysis of RCTs showed that adherence to the MedDiet improved
delayed recall, working memory, and global cognition, but not episodic memory,
immediate recall, paired associates, attention, processing speed, or verbal
ﬂuency vs. controls. The strongest evidence suggests beneﬁt on older adults’
global cognition.

between MedDiet and AD, 3 found no association between MedDiet and
cognitive impairment, and 5 found no association between the MedDiet
and cognitive function.

Higher adherence to the MedDiet was associated with slower cognitive decline,
reduced progression to AD, and improvements in cognitive function in the
following speciﬁc cognitive domains: memory (delayed recognition, long-term,
and working memory), executive function, and visual constructs. There are a
number of methodological issues.

Cross-sectional and cohort studies in non-Mediterranean regions showed
mixed results. Cohort studies from Mediterranean countries and RCTs
showed a beneﬁcial effect of the MedDiet on cognitive function and
prevention of AD and dementia.

Conﬂicting results and conclusions regarding the efﬁcacy of the MedDiet for
age-related cognitive function. Disparity of neuropsychological assessment
methods used appeared to be a plausible contributor to the lack of consensus
among study ﬁndings.

Results from 5 RCTS are mostly nonsigniﬁcant. Only 12.1% of individual
cognitive outcomes signiﬁcantly favored the MedDiet for cognitive performance.
Nevertheless, the signiﬁcant improvements in cognitive combined domains in
PREDIMED, the most robustly designed study, warrant additional research.

Out of 11 analyses (9 comparing high vs. low adherence to MedDiet; one for each
2-point increased adherence; one for each 1-point increased adherence), 3 reported
convincing evidence of beneﬁt, 2 were highly suggestive of beneﬁt, 3 were
suggestive of beneﬁt, 1 reported weak evidence, and only 2 reported no evidence.

2.2. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)

This dietary pattern has consistently shown significant lowering of various CV out-
comes [55]. Wengreen et al. showed that a higher adherence to both DASH and the MedDiet
as well as a greater consumption of whole grains, nuts, and legumes were significantly
associated with higher Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in a prospective study
involving 3831 over-65 participants, who were followed for over eleven years [56]. Partici-
pants from the Nurses’ Health Study (n = 16,144 women from eleven US states) underwent
repeated cognitive testing by telephone at baseline (1995 to 2001), with multiple dietary as-
sessments between 1984 and the first cognitive examination. Greater adherence to long-term
DASH score was associated with improvements in global cognition and verbal memory,
irrespective of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE ε4) allele status. However, adherence to
the DASH score was not associated with changes in cognitive function over 6 years [57].
Several other studies have shown associations of adherence to DASH with better parameters
of cognition [58,59], but there are also null [60,61] or mixed results [57,62]. Nevertheless,
DASH can be considered a cardioprotective and neuroprotective dietary pattern.

2.3. MedDiet-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND Diet)

Based on the evidence that both MedDiet and DASH were associated with lower
incidence of cognitive decline and incident AD and were also cardioprotective, Morris et al.
proposed a combination of the most neuroprotective components of MedDiet and DASH in
a dietary pattern known as MIND diet [58,59]. These two dietary models provide sources
of various antioxidants, B vitamins, polyphenols, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs),
monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and docosahexaenoic acid, which may help to
explain why the dietary patterns resulted in better cognitive health: they combined all
these neuroprotective nutrients. The MedDiet, DASH, and MIND diets are primarily
plant-based and include vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, whole grains, legumes, healthy
fats, ﬁsh, and poultry that are rich in these nutrients. In addition, the MedDiet, DASH, and
MIND diets recommend minimizing the consumption of red meat, sweets, processed foods,
and sugar-sweetened beverages that are often associated with Western dietary patterns
and with negative health outcomes [23,26,63]. Indeed, the Western dietary pattern has
been associated with an increased risk of AD, although the underlying mechanisms are
not yet completely clear [64]. In experimental studies, the Western diet enhanced brain
inﬂammation and the production of beta-amyloid protein [65]. Furthermore, the Med-
Diet, DASH, and MIND diets reduce middle-age CV risk factors that are also risk factors
for AD, including vascular disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, and obesity [26,66–70].
Speciﬁcally, vascular disease risk factors, more so in midlife, are associated with brain accu-
mulation of beta-amyloid [71,72]. It has been estimated that about 40% of dementia cases
could be prevented or delayed by focusing on modiﬁable lifestyle risk factors [18]. Thus,
emerging research points to the components of these three healthy dietary patterns, which
may have synergistic effects impacting physiological processes and signaling pathways
associated with cognitive function and decline [73–75]. Thus, the MIND diet combining
elements of the MedDiet and DASH has been associated with reduced risk of cognitive
impairment and incident AD [59,63]. Assessing the adherence to the MIND diet among
960 participants of the Memory and Aging Project followed for an average of 4.7 years,
Morris et al. observed a positive association of following the MIND diet with a slower
decline in ﬁve single cognitive domains and also in global cognitive performance, after
adjusting for confounders [59]. Likewise, there was a reduction in incident AD for partici-
pants aged 58 to 98 years with the highest adherence to MIND diet compared to the lowest
adherence to this dietary pattern [63]. Taken together, most results available testing the
MIND diet have been favorable [59,61,63,76], and only one study had mixed results [77].

In summary, the MIND diet can be considered a neuroprotective dietary pattern.
Nevertheless, replications of the positive results with the MIND diet are needed in other
populations to conﬁrm their relevance to brain health.

2.4. Ketogenic Diet

Ketone bodies, products of fat metabolism, are a source of energy for the brain and
are available even when glucose supplies are insufﬁcient (e.g., during severe carbohydrate
restriction) or when its metabolism is defective as in AD. Based on evidence that this dietary
pattern has been associated with positive results in some forms of drug-resistant epilepsy
proposed to be mediated by the action of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and generation
of ketones as an alternative metabolic substrate for the brain, enhancing mitochondrial
function and reducing the expression of inﬂammatory and apoptotic mediators [78,79],
this diet has been proposed as neuroprotective. In the last few years, some investigations
have suggested that the ketogenic diet, which is characterized by a high consumption of
fat, moderate consumption of protein, and very low carbohydrate composition, may be a
useful instrument for the prevention of age-associated cognitive decline. However, most
available studies are experimental, and there are not yet enough data from clinical trials to
draw deﬁnitive conclusions on the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline and AD.
In experimental aged animals, the ketogenic diet improved cognitive performance
even under hypoxic conditions without changes in motor performance [80]. Another two
experimental studies found that ketogenic diet started at a young age improved cognition
and extended longevity [81,82]. Late-life ketogenic diet intervention improved behavior
and cognitive tasks that required working memory in rats [83]. A preliminary double-
blind placebo-controlled study in twenty patients with MCI or AD reported improvement
in AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores in APOE ε4-negative
patients receiving medium-chain triglycerides, which was not observed in APOE ε4-
positive patients; higher ketone concentrations were associated with greater improvement
in paragraph recall with MCT treatment compared to placebo among all participants [84].
Another study involving 152 participants reported similar results [85]. A recent preliminary
human phase I/II RCT examined the feasibility of using a modiﬁed Atkins diet (MAD) to
induce ketogenesis in persons with MCI or early AD, and it tested as a primary outcome
the effects of this diet on a Memory Composite Score (MCS), the sum of the delayed recall
trials for the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test—Revised (HVLT-R) and Brief Visuospatial
Memory Test—Revised (BVMT-R). Secondary outcomes for efﬁcacy were changes in the
MMSE-2—Expanded Version (EV), Proﬁle of Mood States, bipolar form (POMS-BI), and
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scores and other clinical outcomes. Twenty-
seven participants were eligible. After extensive assessment and education, participants
were randomly assigned to either the MAD or the National Institute on Aging (NIA)
recommended diet for older people for twelve weeks. Preliminary results showed that
nine patients in the MAD arm and ﬁve in the NIA arm had completed the trial. Despite
extensive training, adherence to both diets was only fair. Among those in the MAD arm
who generated at least trace amounts of urinary ketones, there was a large and statistically
signiﬁcant increase in MCS between the baseline and week-6 assessment. MAD participants
also reported increased energy between baseline and week-6 assessment. These preliminary
results suggest that the generation of even trace ketones might enhance episodic memory
and vitality in very early AD [86]. Another RCT involving twenty-one patients with
clinically conﬁrmed AD were randomly assigned to a modiﬁed ketogenic diet or usual
diet supplemented with low-fat healthy-eating guidelines in a crossover trial (two 12-week
treatment periods, separated by a 10-week washout period). Participants on the ketogenic
diet achieved sustained physiological ketosis measured with blood beta-hydroxybutyrate
concentrations. Compared with the usual diet, patients on the ketogenic diet had better
scores in the AD Cooperative Study—Activities of Daily Living and Quality of Life in AD
(ADCS-ADL) testing; Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination-III also improved but not
signiﬁcantly. Changes in CV risk factors were mostly favorable, while adverse effects were
mild [87]. These results encourage the design of larger RCTs in AD patients to conﬁrm
the positive effects on daily function and quality of life, which are two factors of great
importance to persons and caregivers living with dementia. Even if promising, these are
still preliminary results that should be validated by future larger studies.

2.5. Nordic Diet

The Nordic diet attempts to reﬂect the diet consumed in Nordic countries, where the
usual eating habits include high consumption of ﬁsh, cabbages, apples, and pears, whole
grains from oat, berries, root vegetables, barley and rye, low-fat dairy products, potatoes,
and rapeseed oil [88]. A study including participants aged ﬁfty-seven to seventy-eight years
with normal cognition at baseline reported that better adherence to the Nordic diet was
associated with higher scores in global cognition over a 4-year study period after adjustment
for demographic and lifestyle factors [89]. A large cohort study involving 2223 dementia-
free adults (MMSE scores higher than 27/30) aged over sixty years followed for six years
found that moderate to high adherence to the Nordic diet was more closely associated with
less cognitive decline than moderate to high adherence to other healthy dietary patterns,
i.e., the MedDiet, DASH, and MIND [61]. Subsequent analyses of this cohort study aiming
to verify whether an active lifestyle may reinforce the positive effects of the Nordic Prudent
Dietary Pattern (NPDP) on cognitive function showed that the association of NPDP with
a reduced decline in MMSE scoring became stronger when combined with moderate-to-
intense physical, mental, or social activities. Thus, the combination of NPDP and an active
lifestyle may result in even better preservation of cognitive function and further decreased
risk of cognitive decline [90].

In summary, the results of studies with the Nordic diet are still scarce. Although
they do appear promising for people with preserved cognitive function, whether such
diet might improve cognition in a population with cognitive decline and in populations
different from that of Nordic countries remains to be established.

2.6. Vegetarian Diet

It is accepted today that dietary patterns that emphasize plant foods, which are plenty
of bioactive compounds but not strictly vegetarian/vegan can exert neuroprotective effects.
Likewise, it is recognized that an increased consumption of fruits and vegetables can be
favorable to brain health. A recent prospective study involving 27,842 men with a mean
age of 51 years in 1986 examined the relation of vegetable and fruit consumption, which
was measured with ﬁve repeated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s collected every
4 years, to future incident subjective cognitive function. Higher intakes of total vegetables,
total fruits, and fruit juice 18 to 22 years before were each signiﬁcantly associated with
lower odds of moderate or poor subjective cognitive function [91]. Nevertheless, there
is no direct evidence yet to support the beneﬁts of a strict vegetarian or vegan diet in
preventing cognitive decline despite evidence for brain-health-promoting effects, mainly in
experimental and observational investigations, of several plant foods rich in polyphenols
and anti-inﬂammatory components that may impact neuroinﬂammation [92,93].

In 1993, Giem et al. published preliminary ﬁndings of two cohort sub-studies of the
Adventist Health Study examining the association of following a vegetarian diet or a meat-
eating diet with the incidence of dementia [94]. One of the studies (n = 272 participants)
showed that persons who frequently consumed meat had an over two-fold increased risk
of becoming demented than vegetarians. The second study (n = 2984 participants) reported
no signiﬁcant difference in incident dementia in meat-eating participants vs. vegetarians.
No explanation for these contrasting results were proposed, and there was no evidence of
standardized cognitive assessments during the studies [94]. Although vegetarian/vegan
diets may provide beneﬁcial health effects, they may also lead to nutritional deﬁcien-
cies. A meta-analysis examining the relationship between vegan or vegetarian diets and
cognitive and mental health (n = 13 articles; 17,809 participants) found no signiﬁcant asso-
ciation between diet and the continuous depression score, stress, well-being, or cognitive
impairment. Vegans/vegetarians were at increased risk for depression and had lower
anxiety scores, but no differences for other outcomes, including cognition, were found.
Heterogeneity was large, impeding subgroup analyses [95].

2.7. Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005)

The HEI was developed based on foods aligning the key recommendations of the
Dietary Guidelines for Americans in order to measure diet quality. There are conﬂicting
results on the effects of this dietary pattern on cognitive function. Former cross-sectional
studies showed associations of HEI-2005 with improvements in cognitive tests [96,97].
Conversely, other longitudinal studies involving participants followed for up to 7.6 years
reported no association of HEI-2005 with any modiﬁcation of cognitive performance [41,98].
Wengreen et al. conducted a longer study with a follow-up of eleven years showing
an association between increased HEI scores with lower cognitive decline, suggesting
that a longer period of time is needed in order to reveal the effects of diet on cognitive
function [99].

2.8. Okinawa Diet

This type of diet describes the eating habits followed by people originally from the
Ryukyu Island in Japan, which counts the largest number of centenarians in the world.
Although this dietary pattern has been associated with a long and healthy life, there is no
direct evidence of its effects on the prevention of cognitive deterioration and AD. A not
fully reliable study reported a higher incidence of dementia in 157 migrants from Okinawa
to Brazil compared to 2217 residents of Okinawa [100]. However, there was a period of
nine years between the evaluation of the two groups and a remarkably different sample
size, which hindered deﬁnitive conclusions.

2.9. Low-Copper Diet

A former longitudinal study involving 3718 participants reported that elevated intakes
of copper supplements in combination with a diet rich in saturated and trans-fatty acids
were associated with faster cognitive decline after a follow-up of ﬁve and a half years [101].
Conversely, a small study in thirty-two patients with AD at mild to moderate stages
showed that those participants with low plasma concentrations of copper had higher
(worse) ADAS-cog scores [102]. It has been suggested that the promotion of a low-copper
diet may potentially reduce the risk of AD [103], but there is no evidence that this can
modify the incidence or pathological features of AD.

2.10. Paleolithic Diet

Although there is no evidence on the prevention of cognitive decline or AD with
the Paleolithic diet, some small studies have been conducted in overweight and diabetic
patients [104,105]. One of these studies compared the effects of Paleolithic diet vs. the
Nordic Nutrition Recommendations in a sample of twenty overweight postmenopausal
women followed for six months. The outcomes included parameters of functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), episodic memory fMRI tasks (a face-name paradigm was used
to examine brain responses related to episodic memory), and weight loss. The authors
reported signiﬁcant improvements in fMRI episodic memory tests, which were associated
with increased hippocampal activity, decreased waist circumference, and reduced plasma
free fatty acid with similar results for both dietary patterns [104]. Another study was
conducted in twelve sedentary patients with type 2 diabetes (with or without metformin
treatment) randomized to follow a Paleolithic diet with or without high-intensity exercise.
After twelve weeks, both interventions induced similar signiﬁcant weight loss, improved
insulin sensitivity, and increased oxygen uptake. Both interventions were associated with
increased functional brain responses within the right anterior hippocampus and right
inferior occipital gyrus as well as increased volume of the right posterior hippocampus,
which are areas that are linked to cognitive functions. No changes in episodic memory
function and associated functional brain responses were observed in this short period [105].
Further studies are still needed to test the long-term effects of this dietary pattern.

3. Dietary Components and Supplements
3.1. Vegetables

There is growing evidence that plant-based diets rich in vegetables can be protective,
together with other dietary and lifestyle factors, against age-related cognitive decline and
can help prevent dementia [92]. In the preceding sections, we have discussed dietary
patterns with evidence of cognitive decline and dementia protection. Although those that
are most protective, namely the MedDiet, DASH, and MIND [23,26,67,106,107], are not
strictly vegetarian, these diets are mainly composed of foods with plant origin, including
abundant amounts of vegetables. This means that they are rich in phytonutrients, such as
polyphenols, carotenoids, antioxidant vitamins, healthy fats, and other phytochemicals
linked to lower chronic inﬂammation and oxidative stress and to better scores of the Dietary
Inﬂammatory Index, which has been shown to be inversely associated with memory and
cognitive functioning [108]. In animal models, these nutrients and non-nutrients have been
found to enhance neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival by reducing
oxidative stress and neuroinﬂammation [109]. In particular, a variety of vegetables have
attracted the attention of the lay public and also the scientiﬁc community for their content,
although in reduced amounts, of numerous molecules increasingly investigated for their
healthy properties. Among them, plant polyphenols have raised notable interest [110].
Various clinical trials have indicated that many health beneﬁts of the Mediterranean and
Asian diets can be related to the presence of signiﬁcant amounts of polyphenols, even if in
some cases, inconsistent results have been reported as well, which highlights the need for
further investigation.

A recent analysis of data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Eu-
rope (SHARE) (n = 22,635) including participants from eleven European countries showed
that frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables was associated with improved health
outcomes, including cognitive and mental health [111]. In a biracial cohort of 3231 men and
women aged 18–30 years at baseline in 1985–1986, which was followed for up to 25 years
in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study conducted in the US,
intake of whole vegetables (excluding potatoes) was signiﬁcantly associated with a better
cognitive performance after adjustment for potential confounders in all three cognitive tests
used, supporting the long-term beneﬁts of vegetables and fruits consumption on cognitive
performance [112]. Among 27,842 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study
with a mean age of 51 years in 1986 and followed for 18 to 22 years, higher intakes of total
vegetables, total fruits, and fruit juice were each signiﬁcantly associated with lower odds
of moderate or poor subjective cognitive function after controlling for major non-dietary
factors and total energy intake, conﬁrming the long-term beneﬁcial role of vegetables, fruit,
and orange juice on cognition [91]. A systematic review and meta-analysis identiﬁed six
cohorts involving 21,175 participants. The pooled analysis found that the consumption of
fruit and vegetables was inversely associated with the incident risk of cognitive disorders,
with evidence of signiﬁcant heterogeneity attributed to ethnic differences [113]. An obser-
vational study examined the diet of 17,700 community-living dementia-free Chinese older
adults who attended the Elderly Health Centers in Hong Kong at baseline and followed
their cognitive status for six years, evaluating whether the minimal daily requirement
of vegetables and fruits recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) would
independently lower dementia risk. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed
that having at least three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruits daily might
help prevent dementia in older adults [114]. Another meta-analysis identiﬁed nine studies
(ﬁve cohort studies and four cross-sectional studies) including 31,104 participants and
4583 incident cases of cognitive impairment and dementia. The meta-analysis showed that
an increased consumption of fruit and vegetables was associated with a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, particularly in men and women
aged over 65 years. Dose–response meta-analysis showed that an increment of 100 g per
day of fruit and vegetable consumption was related to a near 13% reduction in cognitive
impairment and dementia risk [115].

In conclusion, a frequent and abundant consumption of vegetables, possibly within a
dietary and lifestyle pattern with other neuroprotective components, appears to positively
impact cognitive well-being and help prevent cognitive decline.

3.2. Extra-Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)

Olive oil, a staple of the MedDiet, is a natural product rich in oleic acid, which is a
MUFA. Olive oil is the typical culinary fat used in Mediterranean countries where it is the
main source of fat in this dietary pattern. There are various types of olive oil (i.e., EVOO,
virgin olive oil, reﬁned olive oil, and pomace oil), which exhibit diverse chemical character-
istics and potential impacts on human health [116]. Unfortunately, olive oil subtypes are
often not discriminated in research investigation with possible heterogeneous results due
to the diverse effects of various subtypes. In particular, EVOO arises from the ﬁrst pressing
of fresh olives, usually within 24 h after their harvest. It is extracted by non-chemically
induced mechanical means at temperatures below 28 ◦C. Its free fatty acid or acidity level
is lower than 0.8%, having optimal taste and odor. Olives contain hydrophilic phenol com-
pounds, including simple phenolic compounds (e.g., gallic, vanillic, caffeic and coumaric
acids, tyrosol, and hydroxytyrosol), complex compounds (e.g., secoiridoids, such as oleu-
ropein and ligstroside), and lignans (e.g., pinoresinol and 1-acetoxypinoresinol). Total
polyphenol content is highest in EVOO as opposed to concentrations in the other subtypes
of olive oil [117,118]. EVOO has been associated with beneﬁcial effects on human health, in-
cluding the prevention of CV diseases, which is attributable to its composition that gives it
antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory properties [119]. Virgin olive oil also arises from the ﬁrst
pressing of olives, albeit with acidity levels below 2%. Virgin olive oil has also hydrophilic
phenols, including phenolic acids and alcohols, ﬂavonoids, lignans, and secoiridoids in
lower concentrations as compared to EVOO and is apparently not as beneﬁcial upon health
as that of EVOO [117]. Even so, perhaps because it is more easily available, virgin olive oil
is highly recommended in the literature [120]. The reﬁnement of olive oil is produced using
acids, alkalis, and heat to extract as much oil as possible from the olive pulp that remains
after the ﬁrst pressing. This processing renders reﬁned oil higher in fat and acidic content
than EVOO and virgin olive oil. Therefore, reﬁned olive oil is deprived of optimal taste,
aroma, and natural antioxidants and anti-inﬂammatory compounds [116]. Pomace oil is
a by-product of EVOO. Olive skins, pulp, and seeds are heated, and the oil that remains
is extracted, using hexane as a solvent. Pomace oil has few bioactive compounds and
hence scarce antioxidant actions. Other types of oil produced through poor practices, such
as lampante oil, are not recommended for human use, unless they are reﬁned. Olive oil
is composed mainly of triacylglycerols and contains small quantities of free fatty acids,
glycerol, pigments, phosphatides, sterols, and ﬂavor compounds. It has a high proportion
of unsaturated and a low proportion of saturated fats. Olive oil consists of about 15%
saturated fats including palmitic acid and stearic acid and about 85% unsaturated fats (70%
oleic acid, a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid, 15% linoleic acid, an omega-6 PUFA,
and 3.5% palmitoleic acid). In fact, olive oil contains more oleic acid and less linolenic
acids (i.e., more MUFA than PUFA) than other vegetable oils; it is free of trans fatty acids.
Several epidemiological observational studies have indicated that a higher proportion of
MUFA in the diet may be linked with a reduction in the risk of CV disease [121,122]. The
ﬂavonoid polyphenols in olive oil are natural antioxidants that contribute to a bitter taste,
astringency, and resistance to oxidation. The major phenolic compounds identiﬁed and
quantiﬁed in olive oil—that is, simple phenols (e.g., hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol), secoiridoids
(e.g., oleuropein, aglycone of ligstroside, and their respective decarboxylated dialdehyde
derivatives), and lignans—have notable antioxidant properties. A high consumption of
EVOO, particularly rich in these compounds, is associated with a diminished risk in colon,
breast, and skin cancer in general and, due to the antioxidative effects of those components,
there is a beneﬁcial effect on coronary heart disease incidence as well as healthy aging [123].
Nevertheless, the polyphenol content is determined by many factors (e.g., variety of olives
used, environmental factors, time of harvest, and extraction and storage conditions) [124].

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

12 of 60

Regarding the consumption of EVOO, a study including 6947 participants in the Three
Cities Study cohort reported that an intensive use of EVOO slowed cognitive decline during
the four years of follow-up. Compared with those participants who never used EVOO,
participants with moderate or intensive EVOO use showed an improvement in visual
memory and verbal ﬂuency [125]. In the same cohort, analysis of 1329 older participants
with high consumption of EVOO and other plant-derived polyphenols, including stilbenes,
ﬂavonoids, and lignans, among others, found that the risk of dementia was reduced by
50% in multivariable-adjusted models [126]. Vals-Predet et al. in a sample of 334 older
participants of the PREDIMED trial at high risk of CV disease reported that after four
years of a MedDiet supplemented with EVOO, memory scores, frontal cognition, and
global cognition scores (including MMSE, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Animals
Semantic Fluency, Digit Span subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Verbal
Paired Associates from the Wechsler Memory Scale, and the Color Trail Test) declined less
compared to the control diet, in whom the scores decreased signiﬁcantly from baseline
values [29]. In the PREDIMED-Navarra trial involving 522 participants at high CV risk,
those receiving supplemented EVOO or mixed nuts showed higher cognitive scores and
improved cognition vs. those in the control group. Participants in the group supplemented
with EVOO had fewer cases of MCI compared to control participants following a low-fat
diet [30,127].

Studying possible mechanisms that can explain the effects of EVOO, animal models
of AD (senile SAMP8) fed with EVOO had improved learning and memory (T-maze foot
shock avoidance and one-trial novel object recognition) associated with better proﬁles of
circulating and brain oxidative stress markers [128]. Likewise, aged rats fed with EVOO
showed improved brain biochemical parameters, memory, and motor coordination to
levels similar to those of young animals by controlling oxidative stress, by activation of
glutathione reductase, and by enhancing superoxide dismutase [129,130].

In summary, EVOO seems to have numerous health beneﬁts shown in experimental
and clinical trials. EVOO consumption seems to be neuroprotective as a crucial component
of the MedDiet. However, there is not yet strong evidence for the effects of EVOO in
isolation on cognitive decline and dementia, because there are very few clinical studies.
However, EVOO should be tested in RCTs for the prevention of cognitive deterioration.

3.3. Nuts

Tree nuts provide macronutrients, micronutrients, and phytochemicals that may affect
several pathways in AD pathogenesis such as amyloidogenesis, tau phosphorylation, oxida-
tive stress, cholinergic pathways, and other non-target mechanisms including cholesterol
lowering and anti-inﬂammatory properties, as well as effects on neurogenesis [131,132].
Among nuts, walnuts contain the largest amount of free and total polyphenols, which are
followed by Brazil nuts and almonds [131]. Phytochemicals contained in tree nuts comprise
carotenoids, phenolic acids, phytosterols and polyphenolic compounds such as ﬂavonoids,
proanthocyanidins, and stilbenes, as well as phytates, sphingolipids, alkylphenols, and
lignans [132]. The phytochemical content of tree nuts can vary considerably by nut type,
genotype, pre- and post-harvest conditions, as well as storage conditions. Although the
beneﬁcial effects of nuts on cardiometabolic diseases have been well established [133,134],
less is known about the effects of nuts on cognitive well-being. Many of the biological
pathways are common; hence, it is plausible that diets rich in nuts might be beneﬁcial in
ameliorating other age-related conditions as well.

Most studies on the effects of tree nuts on cognition or AD have been performed
in preclinical studies in experimental animal models or in cell cultures [135]. While tree
nut phytochemicals are bioaccessible and bioavailable in humans [132], the number of
intervention trials conducted in humans to date is limited, while most of the evidence in
humans comes from observational studies.

Considering the available human studies together—those designed speciﬁcally for
nuts and those considering them within a dietary pattern—there are nineteen studies

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

13 of 60

conducted in countries from different world regions (Europe, USA, Asia), of which there
are thirteen observational and six interventional studies, reporting nut consumption effects
and cognitive function in older adults. From the seven observational studies (three cross-
sectional and four prospective) [136–142] speciﬁcally investigating nuts consumption
and cognitive function, only one study [137] did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in the
cognitive test scores for participants with high vs. low nuts consumption after adjusting for
confounders. The remaining six studies reported a signiﬁcant positive association of various
cognitive test and nuts consumption. The other six studies (three cross-sectional and three
prospective) [56,143–147] investigated the associations of dietary patterns including nuts
and cognitive function of older adults. It is worth clarifying that in these studies, it is not
possible to attribute the ﬁndings to the intake of nuts speciﬁcally. Nevertheless, only one
long-term study (nine-year follow-up) including 6000 older women did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant
associations between nut consumption and global cognition or verbal memory [146]. The
remaining ﬁve studies reported a lower risk of incident cognitive impairment or better
overall cognition and verbal memory with a higher consumption of nuts.

As regards intervention studies investigating the effects of nut supplementation
on the cognitive functioning of older adults, there are three studies available [148–150].
A former pilot study involving participants with MCI with a diet supplemented with
one Brazil nut daily (about 5 g/day containing an estimated 288.75 µg/day of selenium)
for six months found improvements in verbal ﬂuency and constructional praxis scores
but no difference in global cognition (two of six subsets of neuropsychological battery
tests were improved) [148]. Two more recent and larger studies supplementing diets with
almonds [149] or walnuts [150] as 15% of total daily energy intake did not observe any
signiﬁcant differences in cognitive performance or mood after the intervention. Three more
studies including nuts as part of a MedDiet intervention [29,30,151] reported no beneﬁt
in a battery of cognitive tests [151], signiﬁcant improvements in MMSE scores and clock
drawing test [30], and improvements in a composite memory score but not in frontal and
global cognitive function [29], all after adjustment for confounders. As it happens with
other dietary components, in the interventional studies that used an overall dietary pattern
approach, nuts consumption was only one component of the overall interventions, making
it difﬁcult to assess their independent effects.

In summary, most observational studies reported positive associations between nut
consumption and cognitive function in older adults, while almost all interventional studies
failed to demonstrate the beneﬁts of nut supplementation (alone or as part of an overall
dietary pattern) on cognitive function measurements. In general, observational studies
were larger and of longer duration compared to intervention studies. It is possible that
the beneﬁts of nuts consumption on cognition may require very long-term habitual nut
consumption. Nevertheless, the intervention studies are still few. Hence, larger RCTs that
last longer are warranted for deﬁnitive conclusions.

3.4. Berries

Berries generally are rich in ﬂavonoids including the ﬂavan-3-ols catechin and epi-
catechin, the ﬂavanols kaempferol and myricetin, and the anthocyanins delphinidin and
petunidin [131]. In studies conducted in experimental animals and cellular cultures, it has
been shown that ﬂavonoids are neuroprotective and can slow brain aging and cognitive
decline through a number of potential mechanisms, including the suppression of microglia-
mediated inﬂammation as well as blood pressure and oxidative stress decrease with a
consequent reduction of vascular risk, which is facilitated in part through the production
of neuronal and inducible nitric oxide [152–154].

Speciﬁc studies assessing the possible cognitive effects of berries have been conducted
experimentally, supporting the role of berry-rich diets in motor function, working memory,
and increased neurogenesis [155].

Analyses of data from 16,010 participants from the observational Nurses’ Health Study
aged ≥70 years found that a greater consumption of blueberries and strawberries in the

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

14 of 60

long-term were signiﬁcantly associated with slower rates of cognitive decline comparing
extreme categories of consumption after adjusting for multiple potential confounders [156].
There are some small clinical studies on the effects of the consumption of berries or berry
juices on cognitive parameters, which are detailed below.

A systematic review aiming to identify studies on food-based anthocyanin consump-
tion (i.e., berry juices) and cognitive outcomes in human intervention trials included seven
studies, comprising four acute trials and three longer-term interventions (twelve to six-
teen weeks). Six of seven studies reported improvements in either, a single or multiple
cognitive outcomes, including verbal learning and memory, after anthocyanin-rich food
consumption. However, the authors found important methodological limitations due to the
diversity of the studies, most of them very small trials, that prevented the pooling of data
for quantitative analysis. Therefore, they concluded that even if food-based anthocyanin
consumption seems promising, adequately powered studies are still needed [157]. Another
systematic review evaluated RCTs investigating the effects of blueberries and blueberry
products on cognition. Eleven articles (that included twelve studies) were identiﬁed; nine
studies used freeze-dried blueberries, two studies used whole blueberries, and one study
used blueberry concentrate. Eight studies reported an improvement in cognitive perfor-
mance, particularly short- and long-term memory and spatial memory, after blueberry
consumption or supplementation at various doses and time lengths. However, considerable
differences in the study design, dosages, and anthocyanin content hinder between-study
comparison [158]. A double blinded, chronic intervention RCT investigated the effect
of two blueberry formulations (whole wild blueberry powder at 500 mg (WBP500) and
1000 mg (WBP1000) and a puriﬁed extract at 100 mg (WBE111)) for six months vs. placebo
on cognitive performance in 120 older adults (aged 65 to 80 years). The study results
indicated that a three-month intervention with WBE111 facilitated better episodic memory
performance (i.e., delayed word recognition on the Reys Auditory Verbal Learning Task)
and reduced CV risk factors over 6 months [159]. Another small RCT involving thirteen
men and twenty-four women, aged 60 to 75 years, randomized participants to consume
either freeze-dried blueberry (24 g/d, equivalent to 1 cup of fresh blueberries) or a blue-
berry placebo for ninety days. Participants in the blueberry group showed signiﬁcantly
fewer repetition errors in the California Verbal Learning test and reduced switch cost on a
task-switching test across study visits compared to controls. However, no improvement
in gait or balance was observed [160]. Another small trial included healthy older adults
(n = 12 intervention; n = 14 control) randomized to consume either 30 mL of blueberry
concentrate providing 387 mg anthocyanidins or isoenergetic placebo for twelve weeks
undertaking a battery of cognitive function tests and fMRI pre- and post-supplementation.
Signiﬁcant increases in brain activity and in working memory were observed in response
to blueberry supplementation relative to the placebo group in brain areas associated with
cognitive function [161]. In another study, 40 healthy 50 to 70-year-old participants were
provided a berry beverage based on a mixture of berries (150 g blueberries, 50 g black-
currant, 50 g elderberry, 50 g lingonberries, 50 g strawberry, and 100 g tomatoes) or a
control water-based beverage (matched with respect to monosaccharides, pH, and volume)
daily during ﬁve weeks in a randomized crossover design. Cognitive tests included tests
of working memory capacity, selective attention, and psychomotor reaction time, while
cardiometabolic parameters included blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, insulin, blood
lipids, inﬂammatory markers, and markers of oxidative stress. The berry intervention sig-
niﬁcantly reduced total- and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol vs. baseline and vs.
the control beverage. The control beverage increased blood glucose and tended to increase
insulin concentrations vs. baseline, and it also tended to increase insulin concentrations vs.
the berry beverage. Participants performed better in the working memory test after the
berry beverage when compared to after the control beverage. No changes in the cognitive
tests were observed [162]. Krokorian et al. conducted another small study in a sample of
nine older adults with early memory changes randomized to daily consumption of wild
blueberry juice. After twelve weeks of intervention, the authors observed improved paired

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

15 of 60

associate learning and word list recall vs. baseline values. They also compared the memory
performances of participants receiving the intervention with a demographically matched
sample who consumed a berry placebo beverage and observed comparable results for
paired associate learning. The authors concluded that this preliminary study suggests that
moderate-term blueberry supplementation can confer neurocognitive beneﬁt, but larger
comprehensive human trials are warranted [163]. In a 24-week double-blind RCT, older
men and women received daily ﬁsh oil or blueberry or both and neuropsychological assess-
ment (Dysexecutive Questionnaire, Trail-Making Test, Controlled Oral Word Production,
and alternate forms of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test to assess new learning and long-
term memory with scores representing cumulative learning, delayed recall, percentage
recalled, and item discrimination in recognition memory). Total urinary anthocyanins
did not differ between the groups after supplementation. Both ﬁsh oil and blueberry
groups reported fewer cognitive symptoms, and the blueberry group showed improved
memory discrimination. However, combined ﬁsh oil plus blueberry treatment was not
associated with cognitive enhancement [164]. A double-blind RCT was conducted among
215 healthy older adults (aged 60 to 70 years) receiving 600 mg/d of a polyphenol-rich
extract from grape and blueberry (PEGB) (containing 258 mg of ﬂavonoids) or a placebo for
six months. Cognitive tests included the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated
Battery Paired Associate Learning (CANTAB PAL), a visuospatial learning and episodic
memory test, as the primary outcome, while secondary outcomes included verbal episodic
and recognition memory (VRM) and spatial span (SSP) working memory. There was no
signiﬁcant effect of PEGB on the PAL on the whole cohort, but a subgroup with advanced
cognitive decline responded positively to the PEGB. VRM-free recall was improved after
PEGB supplementation. Urinary concentrations of speciﬁc ﬂavan-3-ols metabolites were
associated, at the end of the intervention, with the memory improvements [165].

In summary, available data seem to indicate possible neuroprotective effects of berries
or their products. However, the available results come from small studies, and there are
still no strong data from large RCTs of duration long enough to draw deﬁnitive conclusions
or recommend the consumption of berries to improve cognitive functions.

3.5. Coffee

There is evidence from in vitro studies indicating that caffeine has antioxidant prop-
erties [166] and from experiments in AD animal models showing amyloid-beta suppres-
sion [167]. The decrease in amyloid-plaques was associated with greater levels of phosphor-
cyclic amp-response element binding protein (CREB), protein kinase A activity stimulation,
and a reduction in the expression of phosphor-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphor-
extracellular receptor kinase (ERK) in mouse models of AD, which may activate brain
survival cascades [167,168]. In the short-term, coffee and caffeine are recognized stimulants
to memory and cognition. Yet, the evidence on long-term effects is scarce. A case-control
study reported that elevated serum levels of caffeine were associated with lack of progres-
sion to dementia in a sample of 124 older adults with MCI [169]. In the Cardiovascular Risk
Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) study, coffee drinkers had lower risk of developing
AD and dementia; the lowest risk (65% reduction) was reported for participants consuming
three to ﬁve cups of coffee daily after a 20-year follow-up [170]. Analysis of data from
the Honolulu-Asia Study reported that the highest caffeine intake was associated with
a lower risk of post-mortem neuropathological dementia lesions vs. the lowest caffeine
intake. Nevertheless, coffee and caffeine intake during midlife were not associated with
AD, vascular dementia, cognitive decline, or neuropathological lesions [171]. A study con-
ducted in Portugal reported an association between caffeine intake with slower cognitive
decline [172], while another study conducted in France did not report any association [173].
A longitudinal study by Arab et al. showed a lower risk of cognitive decline among partic-
ipants with higher coffee intake, but there was no dose response [174]. A Finnish study
showed no relationship [175]. A meta-analysis of studies evaluating the association of

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

16 of 60

caffeine intake and cognitive deterioration did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant effects [176]; the studies
included were highly heterogeneous.

Recent investigations continue to provide inconsistent results. A meta-analysis aiming
to investigate the dose–response relationship between alcohol, coffee, or tea consumption
and cognitive deﬁcits including prospective cohort studies or nested case-control studies
(n = 29) from America, Japan, China, and some European countries published up to
June 2020 found that a low consumption of coffee reduced the risk of any cognitive deﬁcit
(<2.8 cups/day) or dementia (<2.3 cups/day) [177]. Conversely, a study exploring the effect
of lifetime coffee consumption on the volume of white matter hyperintensities (VWMH) in
late life examining 492 cognitively normal community-dwelling men and women (mean age
73.4 ± 6.7 years) from the Korean Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and Dementia
found that higher cumulative lifetime coffee consumption was associated with signiﬁcantly
higher log VWMH in both sexes. Participants consuming >2 cups of coffee per day on
average in their lifetime showed higher log VWMH in late life than those who consumed
less. These ﬁndings suggest that prolonged high coffee consumption may be associated
with the risk of WMH in late life [178]. Likewise, a prospective cohort study from Japan
examining the association of average green tea and coffee consumption in the previous
year with repeated MMSE scores in 620 men and 685 women from The National Institute
for Longevity Sciences, Longitudinal Study of Aging (NILS-LSA) did not observe any
association between coffee consumption and incident cognitive decline (MMSE < 27) after
a mean follow-up of 5.3 years, while it was signiﬁcant for tea consumption [179].

There are also some positive but contrasting results, such as those reported by a study
investigating the entity of brain AD pathologies (i.e., cerebral beta-amyloid deposition and
WMH). Among 411 non-demented older adults, lifetime coffee intake of ≥2 cups/day was
signiﬁcantly associated with a lower beta-amyloid positivity vs. coffee intake <2 cups/day,
after adjusting for confounders. However, lifetime or current coffee intake was not related
to hypometabolism, atrophy of AD-signature region, and WMH volume [180]. Since coffee
is rich in polyphenols (i.e., caffeine, diterpenes, melanoidins, and trigonelline), which
can stimulate brain activity, a cross-sectional analysis of data from participants of the
PREDIMED-plus study who completed the MMSE (n = 6427; mean age = 65 ± 5 years;
with metabolic syndrome) or a battery of neuropsychological tests explored the association
of coffee consumption and total dietary caffeine intake with the risk of poor cognitive
functioning. Total coffee consumers and caffeinated coffee consumers had better cogni-
tive functioning than non-consumers after adjusting for potential confounders (OR 0.63;
95% CI 0.44–0.90 and OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.38–0.83, respectively). These associations were
not observed for decaffeinated coffee consumption. Participants in the highest tertile of
total dietary caffeine intake had signiﬁcantly lower odds of poor cognitive functioning
than those in the lowest tertile of caffeine intake [181]. There is no speciﬁc evidence on the
effects of coffee on cognitive decline in RCTs.

In conclusion, there is no consistency in the literature on the association of positive ef-
fects of coffee on long-term cognition. More research is still needed on this important subject.

3.6. Cocoa

Cocoa and its derived products are a rich source of ﬂavonoids, which as discussed
earlier have shown CV and cognitive beneﬁts [182]. Small short-term and chronic trials
have suggested some neuroprotective properties. A study involving eighteen persons
aged 50–65 years showed signiﬁcant increases of brain perfusion in the anterior cingulate
cortex and the central opercular cortex of the parietal lobe in participants receiving a high
ﬂavanol (494 mg) cocoa drink, which was measured with fMRI [183]. Another small study
involving 34 cognitively normal persons with an average age of 72 ± 6 years reported
a signiﬁcantly increased blood ﬂow velocity in the middle cerebral artery after one (8%)
and two weeks (10%) of ﬂavanol-rich cocoa consumption, which was measured with
transcranial ultrasound [184]. An RCT of 41 healthy persons (age range 50–69 years)
who consumed a diet containing high quantities of cocoa-derived ﬂavanol for 3 months

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

17 of 60

reported enhanced dentate gyrus function, as measured by cognitive tests and fMRI [185].
A longitudinal study among 531 over-65 participants followed for a median of 48 months
reported that chocolate intake was associated with a 41% lower risk of cognitive decline in
multivariate-adjusted analysis [186]. A double-blind RCT was conducted aiming to explore
the effect of cocoa ﬂavanol drink consumption (993 mg/d, 520 mg/d, or 48 mg/d for
8 weeks) on cognitive performance in 90 cognitively intact older adults. Cognitive function
was assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks by MMSE, Trail-Making Test (TMT) A and B, and
the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT). MMSE score response was similar for the three doses, while
TMT A and B and VFT improved after consumption of the high and intermediate doses
vs. the lowest dose of cocoa ﬂavonol drink. In addition, the authors reported signiﬁcant
improvements in insulin resistance, blood pressure, and lipid peroxidation for the high
and intermediate dose vs. the lowest dose [187]. Conversely, another double-blind RCT
reported less signiﬁcant results. This RCT involved 40 young participants (mean age =
24.1 ± 4.5) to evaluate the effects of acute (same-day) and sub-chronic (daily for four weeks)
250 mg cocoa supplementation on mood and mental fatigue, cognitive performance, and
CV functioning (peripheral and central blood pressure and cerebral blood ﬂow). Cognition
was assessed with repeated 10-minute cycles of the Cognitive Demand Battery (CDB),
a Rapid Visual Information Processing task, a mental fatigue scale over the course of
half an hour, and the Swinburne University Computerized Cognitive Assessment Battery
(SUCCAB). Consumption of cocoa signiﬁcantly improved only self-reported mental fatigue
and performance on the Serial Sevens task in cycle one of the CDB in the acute time point.
No other signiﬁcant effects were found [188].

The dentate gyrus (DG), a region in the hippocampal formation whose function
declines in association with human aging, is considered a possible source of age-related
memory decline. An RCT using a high-resolution variant of fMRI to map the precise site of
age-related DG dysfunction studied 37 healthy adults (aged 50–69 years) who consumed
either a high (900 mg/d) or a low (45 mg/d) cocoa ﬂavanol-containing diet for 3 months.
A high-ﬂavanol intervention was found to enhance DG function, as measured by fMRI and
by cognitive testing, establishing that DG dysfunction is a driver of age-related cognitive
decline and suggesting non-pharmacological means for its amelioration [185].

A review published in 2017 on available human studies speciﬁcally aiming at evaluat-
ing the effects of acute and chronic administration of cocoa ﬂavanols on different cognitive
domains, although still at a preliminary stage, reported a tendency to dose-dependent
improvements in general cognition, attention, processing speed, and working memory.
However, the number of studies on cognitive ﬁndings is still limited, reporting mixed
results in contrast to studies on physiological responses to ﬂavonoid supplementation
such as vasodilation, both at peripheral and central levels, which have been consistently
replicated. Discrepancies are thought to be the result of methodological differences (i.e.,
dose, form, and timeframe of the cocoa ﬂavanols administration, as well as in the length
and cognitive load of the experimental tasks). Nevertheless, the authors state that the
ﬁndings point to cocoa as a new interesting nutraceutical tool to potentially protect human
cognition and counteract different types of cognitive decline, thus encouraging further
investigations [189].

The mechanisms proposed to explain the potential beneﬁt on cognition of cocoa
and cocoa products are multiple, ranging from its antioxidants actions [190–192] to direct
interactions with cellular signaling that promote neurogenesis, neuronal function, and brain
connectivity [193–195] as well as blood-ﬂow improvement and angiogenesis in the brain
and sensory systems [196–198]. Other active components of cocoa, such as methylxanthines
(caffeine and theobromine), may be considered. Caffeine, as mentioned above, has been
extensively studied, while theobromine has been examined less. Animal and human
studies have suggested a potential neuroprotective action of long-term consumption of
theobromine through a reduction of beta amyloid pathology. The potential action of
theobromine alone and associated with caffeine or other cocoa constituents on cognitive

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

18 of 60

modulation is underexplored to date, and future studies are needed to shed light on this
promising molecule [199].

In summary, the preliminary evidence shown above, even if not deﬁnitive and still
inconsistent, underscores the need for further well-design and large RCT on cocoa and
cocoa-derived products to better elucidate their neuromodulatory properties and potential
cognitive effects.

3.7. Garlic

In experimental animals, extracts of garlic have exhibited antioxidant properties and
protective actions against amyloid-beta-induced neurotoxic effects [200]. In vitro stud-
ies have reported that allicin, an organosulfur compound contained in garlic, inhibited
cholinesterase enzymes and upregulated brain acetylcholine concentrations [201]. In exper-
imental animals, S-allyl cysteine, the active compound of aged garlic extract, has shown a
mitigation of LPS-induced cognitive deﬁcits via the attenuation of oxidative stress, neuroin-
ﬂammation, astrogliosis, and acetylcholinesterase activity [202]. However, no clinical trials
for these compounds are available. There are some negative reports, such as those from
the Doetinchem Cohort Study comprising 2613 participants aged 43–70 years, in which a
higher consumption of allium (onion, garlic, and leek) was associated with worse scores
on speed of cognitive processes and cognitive ﬂexibility in cross-sectional analyses, and
there was no association with cognitive decline in longitudinal analyses [142]. More recent
experimental studies conﬁrm that garlic extract may be effective in alleviating cognitive
impairment and neuropathology in AD animal models [203,204], but there is no evidence
of possible effects on cognition in human studies.

3.8. Tea

In Asian cultures where tea is largely consumed, it is traditionally considered a cogni-
tive enhancer. Acute effects of tea consumption on mood and cognitive performance have
been reported in some studies and have been linked to antioxidants contained in tea, such
as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), L-theanine, and caffeine [205]. In addition, it has
been suggested that the neuroprotective actions of tea consumption may be mediated by
inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and regulation of stress hormones [206]. Nevertheless,
there is no deﬁnitive evidence on tea consumption neuroprotective actions due to inconsis-
tent results of available studies [207]. Tea bioactive components, i.e., L-theanine and EGCG,
may have shown anti-amyloidogenic and antioxidant properties in vitro, but the evidence
for their use in humans as nutraceuticals is limited; hence, their use in the clinical practice
is not currently recommended.

Recently, a prospective cohort study analyzing data from 1305 cognitively competent
participants at baseline of the NILS-LSA in Japan, aged 60–85 years, examined the mean
consumption of green tea and coffee in the previous year in relation to cognitive decline
assessed with repeated measurements of MMSE score (up to six times biennially). Dur-
ing follow-up (mean of 5.3 ± 2.9 years), 432 participants had incident cognitive decline
(MMSE < 27); in multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression, participants
who consumed green tea once/day, 2–3 times/day, and ≥4 times/day had a progressively
signiﬁcant lower risk of incident cognitive decline compared to participants who consumed
green tea < once/day. No signiﬁcant association was found between coffee intake and
cognitive decline [179].

Since the results of studies in humans on alcohol, coffee, and tea consumption in rela-
tion to cognitive decline have been incongruous, a recent meta-analysis of 29 prospective
cohort studies or nested case-control studies in a cohort from different countries worldwide
aimed to ﬁnd the dose–response relationship between alcohol, coffee, or tea consumption
and cognitive deﬁcits. The dose–response relationships showed that compared to non-
drinkers, green tea consumption was a signiﬁcant protective factor for cognitive health; one
cup of tea per day was associated with a 6% reduction in the risk of cognitive deﬁcits [177].

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

19 of 60

Nevertheless, the available studies are all observational, and there is no solid evidence of
protective effects of tea consumption on cognitive decline.

3.9. Alcohol

We have mentioned how both risk and protective factors for CV disease are also
risk/protective factors for cognitive impairment and dementia. The MedDiet dietary pat-
tern includes the possibility of consuming light to moderate amounts of alcohol (5–25 g/day
for women and 10–50 g/day for men), which has been found to be associated with a lower
risk of total mortality, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure [208].
The evidence of wine’s cardioprotective effects emerged in earlier studies [209]. However,
the proposed CV protective actions of alcohol have been lately a matter of debate with evi-
dence showing an inverse association of alcohol consumption with coronary heart disease
but also with an increased risk of different types of stroke [210], which is very relevant
for the development of cognitive decline and dementia. It is clear that heavy drinking
(over 4 drinks/day) represents a risk factor for CV and other chronic diseases [211] and
is a leading cause of premature deaths in the USA [212]. Supporting the message that
there is no safe level of alcohol consumption, studies based on Mendelian randomization
analyses in mega-cohorts have questioned the CV beneﬁts of alcohol consumption [213].
However, the effects of alcohol consumption on the risk of cognitive deterioration appear
to be strongly modiﬁed by the presence of APOE ε4 allele. Analyses of data from the
Epidemiology of Vascular Aging (EVA) prospective study involving 1,389 participants
aged 59-71 years followed for 4 years and conducted in France found that alcohol drinking
was associated with a decreased risk of cognitive deterioration in non-APOE ε4 carriers,
whereas an opposite association was observed in APOE ε4 carriers [214]. Other data
have accumulated conﬁrming that moderate alcohol consumption may be beneﬁcial for
cognition. A recent meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that light to mod-
erate alcohol consumption is associated with a reduced risk of dementia, whereas both
abstinence and heavy drinking are associated with a higher risk of dementia [215]. Similar
results were obtained in the Whitehall II cohort study follow-up [216]. Furthermore, it is
well known that both abstinence and excess alcohol are associated with increased risk of
CV disease and diabetes, which are established links with dementia. Concerning cognition,
there is also abundant epidemiological evidence that low to moderate alcohol consumption
is associated with better cognitive function than abstinence or excess drinking [217–220].
For red wine, it has been suggested that its composition comprising not only alcohol
but also bioactive compounds (polyphenols) can impact oxidative stress and chronic
inﬂammation [221]. Nevertheless, research on resveratrol, the most intensely studied wine
polyphenol, has not demonstrated that the neuroprotective effects obtained in experimental
animals are replicable in humans, as discussed below (Section 3.14).

A meta-analysis of twenty-nine prospective studies aiming to explore possible dose–
response relationship between alcohol, coffee, and tea consumption and cognitive deﬁcits
found that compared to non-drinkers, low consumption (<11 g/d) of alcohol could reduce
the risk of cognitive deﬁcits or dementia, but there was no signiﬁcant effect of heavier
drinking (>11 g/d) [177]. However, another recent review aiming to critically summarize
the main relevant studies to clarify the relationship between wine drinking and AD, as well
as how frequency and/or amount of drinking may inﬂuence this relationship, concluded
that no deﬁnitive results can clarify if light to moderate alcohol drinking is detrimental to
cognition and dementia, or if alcohol intake could reduce the risk of developing AD [222].
A study on data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging including ten cognitive
scores, spanning various domains of cognition, found mixed effects of alcohol on domains
of letter ﬂuency, attention, and working memory with heterogeneous results depending on
analyses by sex and baseline age, concluding that further longitudinal large studies are still
needed to allow certain conclusions [223]. A recent dose–response meta-analysis including
six prospective studies (n = 4244) with data on at least three levels of alcohol exposure
found that heavy alcohol intake (>14 drinks/week) was signiﬁcantly associated with higher

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

20 of 60

risk of progression to dementia in people with MCI, while there was a nonlinear relation
between alcohol intake and risk of this progression. Drinking over 16 drinks/week would
signiﬁcantly further elevate the progression to dementia risk [224].

In summary, there are still contrasting results regarding the protective effects of
low/moderate alcohol consumption on the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.
Certainly, there is accumulated evidence of beneﬁt, but there are also other studies that fail
to reach deﬁnitive conclusions. The point on which there is general agreement is that exces-
sive alcohol consumption can be detrimental for cognitive functions, and besides, in some
cases, even moderate consumption can engender increased risk of drowning, violence, and
injuries from car accidents and falls, and with a higher risk of breast cancer [225].

3.10. Curcumin

The rhizome of Curcuma longa, part of the curry spice widely used traditionally in
Asian cuisine, contains the polyphenolic compound turmeric curcumin, which is used as
therapy for various conditions in traditional Indian medicine and a potent antioxidant [226].
It has been reported that older healthy people who consumed curry frequently had better
cognitive performance vs. non-consumers of curry [227], while the Indian population
that widely used curry seem to have a lower prevalence of AD compared to the US
population [228].

A number of experimental studies have shown the potent anti-oxidant and anti-
inﬂammatory properties of curcumin and its protective effects against AD in animal
models [229], while few RCTs and case reports are available [230–234]. A study involving
thirty-four AD patients receiving either 1 or 4 g/d of curcumin or placebo for six months
found no signiﬁcant effects in MMSE [230]. Another RCT included thirty-six patients with
dementia receiving 2 or 4 g/d of curcumin C3 complex (95% of curcuminoids) or placebo
for twenty-four weeks, which was followed by a 48-week open-label trial with curcumin
C3 complex for the placebo arm. There were no signiﬁcant differences between treatment
groups and placebo in any of the cognitive scores used (ADAS-Cog, Neuropsychiatric
Inventory –NPI–, ADCS-ADL scale, MMSE) or cerebrospinal ﬂuid markers [231]. A case
report article described three patients with dementia and severe behavioral and psycho-
logical symptoms who had a remarkable improvement of these symptoms (irritability,
agitation, anxiety, and apathy) after treatment with 100 mg/day of curcumin and donepezil
for twelve weeks with signiﬁcantly decreased NPI scoring [232]. A double-blind RCT exam-
ined the acute (1 and 3 h after a single dose), chronic (4 weeks), and acute-on-chronic (1 and
3 h after single dose following chronic treatment) effects of solid lipid curcumin formula-
tion (400 mg as Longvida®) on cognitive function, mood, and blood biomarkers in sixty
healthy adults (age range: 60–85 years). Curcumin signiﬁcantly improved performance on
sustained attention and working memory tasks (digit vigilance task accuracy and serial
three subtraction task) after one hour of administration compared with placebo. Following
chronic treatment, working memory and mood (general fatigue and change in state calm-
ness, contentedness, and fatigue induced by psychological stress) were signiﬁcantly better
vs. placebo. A signiﬁcant acute-on-chronic treatment effect on alertness and contentedness
was also reported [233]. Finally, another double-blind RCT investigated the ability of a
curcumin formulation to prevent cognitive decline in a population of community-dwelling
older adults. Ninety-six participants received either placebo or 1500 mg/d Biocurcumax®
for 12 months. A battery of clinical and cognitive measures was administered at baseline
and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. The repeated measures analysis revealed an inter-
action for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, which was driven by a decline in function of
the placebo group at 6 months that was not observed in the curcumin treatment group. No
differences were observed between the groups for all other clinical and cognitive measures.
Thus, further longitudinal studies are required to investigate eventual modiﬁcations in
cognitive outcome measures with curcumin administration, which may be improved if
performed in conjunction with biological markers of neurodegeneration [234].

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

21 of 60

A recent review of preclinical and clinical studies evaluated the efﬁcacy of curcumin in
ameliorating and preventing age-associated cognitive decline also addressing the transla-
tional progress of preclinical to clinical efﬁcacy. Results from preclinical studies consistently
demonstrated that curcumin and its analogues were efﬁcacious for various aspects of cogni-
tive impairment and processes that contribute to age-associated cognitive decline. Results
of the few published clinical studies were not univocal, but some continue to show promis-
ing results for curcumin’s use against cognitive decline but overall remained currently
inconclusive. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that curcumin can signiﬁ-
cantly decrease oxidative stress and systemic inﬂammation as well as hinder pathways that
activate transcription factors associated with the enhancement of these processes. Thus,
still further clinical studies are needed, perhaps including the evaluation of peripheral and
cerebrospinal ﬂuid biomarkers of dementia (e.g., amyloid and tau status) and behavioral
markers of cognitive decline as well as targeting appropriate populations [235].

Turmeric supplements generally have low bioavailability, which is why new formula-
tions have been proposed, such as polymeric micelles, polymer nanoparticles, nanogels,
dendrimers, nanoemulsions, inclusion complexes, phytosomes, solid–lipid nanoparti-
cles, curcumin nanoparticles, liposomes nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, nanogel, den-
drimers, nanoemulsions, inclusion complexes, and phytosomes with potential to reduce
intestinal degradation and increase curcumin bioavailability, ultimately enhancing its
efﬁcacy throughout the body and the brain [229].

3.11. Omega-3 Fatty Acids

The PUFAs are crucial components of the neuronal cell membranes, which preserve
membrane ﬂuidity for synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter communication. PU-
FAs may be lipid messengers and precursors for signaling processes to promote protection
or prevent neuronal damage [236]. A deﬁcit of PUFAs in the hippocampus, cortex, and
cerebellum has been reported in the aged brain, which may be worse in AD [237]. The most
extensively studied PUFAs regarding cognitive deterioration are omega-3 long chain (LC)
PUFAs with conﬂicting results. A systematic review concluded that omega-3 long chain
(LC)PUFAs play a relevant role in the reduction of cognitive decline [238], while other stud-
ies have shown negative results. For example, the “Supplementation with Folate, vitamin
B6 and B12 and/or Omega-3 fatty acids” trial, involving 1748 participants with a history of
CV disease, did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant effect of vitamin B and omega-3 PUFA supplemen-
tation on cognitive function [239]. A double-blind RCT including 302 cognitively intact per-
sons older than 65 years receiving 1.8 g/d of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA), 0.4 g/d EPA-DHA, or placebo for 26 weeks found no signiﬁcant effects [240].
A meta-analysis of three trials comprising data from 3536 participants aged over sixty years
with preserved cognitive performance at baseline supplemented with omega-3 PUFAs re-
ported no signiﬁcant effects on cognitive function [241]. A study conducted in China found
that participants older than 65 years who consumed ≥100 g/week of ﬁsh had a reduction
of near 65% in the mean annual rate of global cognitive decline with no associations among
participants aged 55–64 years [242]. Likewise, the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive
Trial (MAPT) including 1525 participants found that a multidomain intervention plus
omega-3 PUFAs supplementation, either alone or in combination, had no signiﬁcant effects
on cognitive deterioration over 3 years [243].

More recent analyses of data from 1445 MAPT participants explored the effects of
PUFAs and the mentioned multidomain intervention on levels of intrinsic capacity (IC),
which is a construct proposed by the WHO including the Geriatric Depression Scale
(psychological); Short Physical Performance Battery (mobility); Z-score combining four
tests (cognitive function); and handgrip strength (vitality). After three years, the IC Z-score
decreased signiﬁcantly among all groups with no signiﬁcant differences between groups,
conﬁrming no effect of the intervention [244]. A recent cross-sectional study conducted in
Australia investigated the relationship between erythrocyte omega-3 LCPUFA, DHA and
EPA levels and their corresponding dietary intakes with cognition and physical function

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

22 of 60

in a cohort of 142 community-dwelling older adults (60–85 years) at risk of dementia.
Higher dietary DHA and EPA were associated with better global cognitive function, better
attention/psychomotor composite scores, mobility (four-square step test), and gait speed.
No associations were found between erythrocyte omega-3 LCPUFA and cognitive or
functional performance measures [245]. A recent narrative review examined the available
evidence on the association between DHA/EPA (blood testing or dietary intake) and brain
volume in non-demented older adults aged 45 years or over. The search identiﬁed twelve
studies: eight cross-sectional observational studies, three longitudinal cohort studies, and
one RCT published between 2007 and 2019. The largest amount of evidence indicated that
the hippocampus was most frequently involved in this association, with a higher volume
associated with higher omega-3 levels. Most studies reviewed provided mixed ﬁndings
regarding the presence or absence of the association of interest, and the ﬁndings were
observed to be brain region-dependent. Hence, the authors concluded that the current
evidence is still insufﬁcient to formulate recommendations for omega-3 PUFA intake to
support brain health speciﬁcally [246]. Another recent trial [247] and a meta-analysis [248]
reported negative results. The small RCT (n = 33) evaluated the effect of supplementation
with omega-3 fatty PUFAs (2.3 g/d) on diverse biomarkers analyzed in the cerebrospinal
ﬂuid (CSF) of patients with AD at baseline and after six months of treatment. There were no
signiﬁcant differences between the groups concerning the level of the different biomarkers
in the CSF at baseline with a small but signiﬁcant increase in only two of the multiple
biomarkers measured. This increase in biomarkers did not correlate with MMSE score [247].
A systematic review and meta-analysis of thirty-eight RCTs (comprising 49,757 participants)
with longer duration than twenty-four weeks assessed the effects of increasing omega-3,
omega-6, or total PUFA on incident neurocognitive illness and cognition. The meta-analysis
suggested no or very little effect of omega-3 LCPUFA on incident neurocognitive illness,
new cognitive impairment, or global cognition. Effects did not change with sensitivity
analyses, different doses, durations, intervention types, or replacements. Therefore, the
authors concluded that omega-3 LCPUFA supplements do not help older adults protect
against cognitive decline [248]. There are also some sporadic positive results. For example,
among 285 participants with stable coronary artery disease on statin treatment randomized
to 3.36 g/d EPA and DHA or none for 30 months assessing cognitive function at baseline
and after 12 and 30 months with neuropsychological testing, participants on EPA/DHA
treatment had signiﬁcantly better scores vs. controls for verbal ﬂuency, language, recall
memory, and visual–motor coordination [249]. A post doc analysis of the placebo-controlled
trial Folic Acid and Carotid Intima-media Thickness (FACIT) investigated the interaction
between baseline omega-3 PUFA statuses and folic acid treatment on cognitive decline
in 791 older adults aged 50–70 years. Participants received 800 microg/d of folic acid
or placebo for 3 years, and global cognitive functioning and domain-speciﬁc functioning
(episodic memory, information processing speed, executive functioning) were assessed at
baseline and after 3 years. The efﬁcacy of folic acid treatment on cognitive functioning was
dependent on the omega-3 PUFA status: participants with a lower omega-3 PUFA status
at baseline beneﬁted from folic acid treatment, while individuals with a higher omega-
3 PUFA did not, which may help explain the inconsistency in outcomes of B-vitamin
supplementation trials on cognition [250].

In summary, the ﬁndings of studies on the effects of omega-3 PUFAs on cognition are
hitherto mixed. Therefore, at present, there is still insufﬁcient evidence to recommend this
type of supplementation to improve cognitive performance or prevent cognitive decline.

3.12. Magnesium

There is substantial evidence showing that a deﬁcit of magnesium (Mg) leads to
increased free radicals production in various tissues, increased oxidative tissue damage,
greater superoxide anion production by inﬂammatory cells, reduced antioxidant enzyme
expression and activity, lessened cellular and tissue antioxidant concentrations, and aug-
mented oxygen peroxide production [251,252]. Mg is crucial for synaptic conduction,

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

23 of 60

N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor response to excitatory amino acids [253], inhi-
bition of calcium channels, calcium inﬂux, and glutamate release, and for the stability
and viscosity of cell membranes [251]. Vasospasm has been reported in conditions of Mg
deﬁciency; contrariwise, high Mg levels induce tone relaxation in cerebral arteries [254].
The previous results have aroused interest in studying the role of Mg in cognitive decline
and dementia in recent years. Earlier investigations had shown that AD patients exhibited
low serum Mg levels [255] and decreased Mg brain tissue concentrations in autoptic stud-
ies [256]. We found reduced plasma concentrations of ionized free Mg in AD patients [257]
that were associated with the severity of the cognitive dysfunction. A study reported a
negative signiﬁcant association of serum Mg concentrations with two scales of AD clinical
severity (Global Deterioration Scale and Clinical Dementia Rating), supporting the likely
protective role of Mg on cognitive performance [258].

More recent analyses of observational studies have conﬁrmed the association of Mg
deﬁcit with an increased possibility of incident cognitive decline. A systematic review
of studies investigating Mg status was performed comparing AD with healthy controls
(HCs) or controls with medical illness (MCs). Thirteen studies were included (AD: 559;
HCs: 381; and 126 MCs). Compared to HCs, patients with AD had signiﬁcantly lower
Mg in cerebrospinal ﬂuid (two studies) and hair (two studies). No differences between
AD and controls were evident for serum Mg. Comparisons with MCs were hindered by
the scarcity of studies including these patients [259]. Mg plays a critical role in vitamin
D biosynthesis and metabolism [260]. Deﬁciencies in both nutrients, which is frequent
in old age, have been associated with poor cognition. A study aimed to evaluate the
associations of Mg intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations
with cognition and the interaction between these nutrients based on data from the Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) 2011–2014 including 2466 participants
aged over sixty years. Cognitive impairment was deﬁned as a Digit Symbol Substitution
Test (DSST) score lower than the lowest quartile. Higher total Mg intake was indepen-
dently associated with higher DSST scores, especially among women, non-Hispanic whites,
physically active participants, and those with sufﬁcient serum 25(OH)D, although the
interactions were not signiﬁcant. The odds of cognitive impairment were signiﬁcantly
reduced with increasing intake of total Mg and higher level of serum 25(OH)D [261]. A
random sub-cohort (n = 2063) from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in
Stroke (REGARDS) US cohort was investigated regarding baseline serum Mg concentration
and incident cognitive impairment identiﬁed with the Six-Item Screener. After adjustment
for potential confounders, an inverse threshold association between serum Mg level and
incident cognitive impairment was observed. Compared to those with the worst level
of hypomagnesemia (<0.75 mmol/L), the relative odds of incident cognitive impairment
were reduced by 41% in the intermediate level of serum Mg (0.75–< 0.81); a higher serum
Mg level did not provide further beneﬁts. Thus, sufﬁcient Mg status within the normal
range may be beneﬁcial to cognitive health in the US population [262]. Another study
investigated the associations of plasma Mg concentration with AD and non-AD dementia.
Plasma Mg concentrations were measured in 102,648 participants from the Copenhagen
General Population Study. Multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios for non-AD dementia
were 1.50 (95% conﬁdence interval (CI):1.21–1.87) for the lowest and 1.34 (CI: 1.07–1.69)
for the highest vs. the fourth quintile (reference) of plasma Mg concentrations. Diabetes,
cumulated smoking, stroke, and systolic blood pressure mediated 10.4%, 6.8%, 1.3%, and
1.0%, respectively, in the lowest quintile, whereas stroke mediated 3.2% in the highest
quintile. No associations were observed for AD. The lowest risk observed for non-AD
dementia was at a concentration of 2.07 mg/dL. No association was observed for AD.
Mediation analysis suggested that diabetes may be in the causal pathway between low
plasma Mg concentrations and high risk of non-AD dementia, while cumulated smoking,
stroke, and systolic blood pressure played minor mediating roles [263]. Data from 12,040
cognitively intact participants at baseline from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
(ARIC) observational study were analyzed to study the association of serum Mg with

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

24 of 60

cognitive functioning capabilities assessed repeatedly. There were 2519 cases of incident
dementia over a median follow-up period of 24.2 years. Participants in the lowest quintile
of serum Mg had a 24% higher rate of incident dementia compared to those in the highest
quintile of Mg. No relationship was found between serum Mg and cognitive decline in any
cognitive domain. Hence, according to these results, low midlife serum Mg was associated
with increased risk of incident dementia but did not appear to impact rates of cognitive
decline [264].

In summary, at present, there is accumulated evidence supporting a role for Mg in
cognitive decline, both as an antioxidant and neuroprotective agent as well as in association
with the incidence of dementia in a number of observational studies. However, so far, there
are no trials testing whether Mg supplementation can directly be preventive or therapeutic
in cognitive disorders; thus, the protection of Mg supplementation for the development of
AD remains to be further elucidated in well-designed and conducted RCTs.

3.13. Ginkgo biloba

The leaves of the tree Ginkgo biloba (Gb) native to China are a popular herbal medicine
in Traditional Chinese Medicine, whose extracts have been used for various disorders
including cognitive disorders, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cerebral is-
chemia [265–268]. In animal models [267,269] and in vitro [270], the extract of Gb leaves
has been reported to attenuate neuronal damage, in particular that induced by amyloid-
beta [271–274] and even to have beneﬁcial effects on cognition in combination with
donepezil in animal models of AD [275,276]. The chemical constituents of Gb comprise
ﬂavonoids, terpene lactones, and ginkgolic acids [277] that may explain its favorable ef-
fects in experimental studies possibly mediated by antioxidant activities, improvements
in microcirculation, modulation of neurotransmitters, enhancement of neuroplasticity,
prevention of brain edema, and other neuroprotective actions [268,278–283].

Ginkgo biloba extracts have been used empirically in the treatment of dementia in hu-
mans for several decades [277,284]. However, whether Gb can improve cognitive function
and prevent cognitive decline and dementia in clinical studies is as yet a controversial ques-
tion. Even if few available large-scale clinical trials suggest that Gb extracts are relatively
efﬁcacious in delaying the progress of dementia [285–288], other trials showed negative re-
sults [289,290]. Some systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been conducted to assess
Gb extracts effects on the prevention and treatment of MCI and dementia [270,291–300]
with mixed results. The available studies are very heterogeneous, but in general, those
carried out in healthy people are more frequently negative than those involving patients
with MCI or dementia, and the effects seem to be dose-dependent with better results for
those using doses of Gb extracts higher than 240 mg/d for longer periods of time. In any
case, the results are highly variable, and so far, no deﬁnitive conclusions can be made for
the use of Gb in cognitive disorders or in the prevention of dementia.

3.14. Resveratrol

This is a phytoalexin from the group of polyphenols that is contained in berries.
Most of the resveratrol that is consumed through the diet in humans derives from grapes
and red wine [301]. Resveratrol as other polyphenols has shown antioxidant and anti-
inﬂammatory actions [302]. Studies conducted in experimental models of AD reporting
reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration and improved cognitive memory performance
with resveratrol administration [303–306] provided some optimism to the possibility that
this polyphenol could contribute to the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia.
Clinical trials in humans are small, fewer, and have shown mixed results [307–310]. Some
small trials exploring intermediate outcomes have reported seemingly beneﬁcial results.
For example, a placebo-control trial involving twenty-two healthy adults reported a dose-
dependent (250–500 mg/d) increase in cerebral blood ﬂow in the prefrontral cortex during
cognitive tasks [311]. Likewise, another small study including twenty-three overweight
participants, aged 50–75 years, randomized to receive 200 mg/d of resveratrol or placebo

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

25 of 60

for 26 weeks, reported improved memory performance and higher functional connectivity
of the hippocampus in neuroimaging in those participants with resveratrol treatment [312].
However, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of human clinical trials and animal
studies published prior to January 2020 showed that most publications on animal models
reported positive outcomes on cognition and brain function following exposure to resvera-
trol or grape seed extracts. Conversely, eleven meta-analyses of data from human placebo
vs. resveratrol, grape, or wine treatment trials did not ﬁnd any statistically signiﬁcant effect
on various measures, including cognitive performance and mood assessments, gray matter
volume, and blood pressure [313].

In summary, the promising effects of resveratrol on cognition and dementia prevention
in experimental models are not replicated in human clinical trials based on currently
available data. Likewise, as mentioned above (Section 3.9), there is no evidence on the
effects of light wine consumption in this regard, while heavy alcohol consumption can
be detrimental for brain health [211,222,224]. Therefore, there is no validated evidence
for prescribing this supplement or advice recommending wine consumption to improve
cognitive function or prevent AD and other types of dementia.

3.15. Phytoestrogens

These are plant-derived naturally occurring polyphenolic non-esteroidal xenoestro-
gens that, because of its structural similarity with estradiol, have the ability to cause
estrogenic and/or anti-estrogenic effects by binding to the estrogen receptors. Phytoestro-
gens have been described in over 300 plants [314]. Isoﬂavones are the most extensively
investigated phytoestrogens, and the neuroprotective effects of soy isoﬂavones have been
demonstrated in experimental animal research and cell cultures studies, which are at-
tributable to both their antioxidant properties and their interaction with the estrogen
receptor [314–316]. However, the studies include mixtures of them, such as genistein
and daidzein, which prevents the identiﬁcation of which component the cognitive effects
depend on. Nevertheless, the studies carried out on soy consumption and phytoestrogen
supplements on cognitive function in rodent models and in vitro have shown variable and
inconclusive results, most reporting positive neuronal effects with the consumption of soy
isoﬂavores, but high doses may have negative brain and cellular effects [314,315] with an
overall absence of adverse events [317].

Some clinical studies reported cognitive positive effects in adult women that were
reversed in older women, while in men, the results were even more ambivalent [315]. The
inconsistencies found have been explained by the use of diverse isoﬂavone supplements at
various doses in short-term clinical trials. Most studies reporting no effects of phytoestro-
gens on cognition have been conducted in European cohorts, which is a population with
recognized low consumption of soy and soy products. Conversely, studies carried out in
Asian populations, in which the consumption of soy-derived products is higher, a lower
incidence of cognitive decline associated with this consumption has been observed in older
women. The phytoestrogen daidzein is transformed into S-equol by the gut microbiota
after oral intake of conjugated isoﬂavones. However, there are important differences in
S-equol production among Japanese and European women, with about 70% of Japanese
persons being “equol producers” [318], which can help explain the differences in the results
of studies carried out in Japan and in European countries. The Women’s Isoﬂavone Soy
Health (WISH) trial, which was conducted in the USA and involved 313 postmenopausal
women aged 45 to 92 years, randomized participants to receive 25 g/d of isoﬂavone-rich
soy protein (containing genistein, daidzein, and glycitein) vs. milk protein as placebo, and
evaluated cognitive function at baseline and after two and a half years. The authors did not
observe any difference between the groups in the cognitive tests. However, women within
ﬁve to ten years of menopause in the isoﬂavone group exhibited a non-signiﬁcant trend
(p = 0.07) toward cognitive improvement and a signiﬁcant enhancement of verbal episodic
memory. In addition, participants who were consistent producers of urinary S-equol had a
non-signiﬁcant trend (p = 0.08) toward cognitive improvement [319].

In conclusion, the data regarding the beneﬁcial effects of phytoestrogens on cognition
appear to be inconclusive. Further well-controlled, large-scale clinical studies are necessary
to translate the neuroprotective effects of phytoestrogens reported in experimental models
and cell cultures. There are no RCTs of phytoestrogens for the prevention or treatment
of AD.

3.16. Vitamins

There are numerous studies in the literature investigating possible effects of vitamin
supplements intake on cognitive function and on the prevention of cognitive decline
and AD, although there are no deﬁnitive conclusions. For example, analyses of data
from the Physicians’ Health Study and Physicians’ Health Study II (n = 4052) reported
no signiﬁcant effects on cognitive function with beta-carotene (provitamin A) treatment
in the short-term and beneﬁcial effect with longer-term (18-year) administration [320].
In general, studies of vitamin B on cognition have shown mixed results.
In an RCT
including 299 men aged over 75 years, no signiﬁcant effects on cognitive functions were
reported after 2-year supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B12, and B6 [321]. Likewise,
a meta-analysis including data from nine RCTs (n = 2835) found no signiﬁcant effects of
folic acid supplementation with or without other B vitamins on cognitive function [322].
Contrariwise, an RCT involving 900 participants aged 60 to 74 years reported that those
receiving a combination of folic acid and vitamin B12 had a signiﬁcant improvement in
cognitive tests when compared to placebo [323]. More recently, a population-based cohort
study using Danish registry data assessed possible associations among low plasma vitamin
B12 levels, high-dose injection or oral vitamin B12 treatment, and risk of dementia from
2000 to 2013. For the analyses, patients with low plasma B12 levels (<200 pmol/L) were
propensity score-matched 1:1 with patients with normal levels (200–600 pmol/L). No
associations were found for low plasma B12 levels and dementia, and this was not affected
by B12 treatment. Findings were similar for all-cause and vascular dementia. The authors
concluded that their results do not support routine screening for B12 deﬁciency in patients
with suspected dementia [324].

A number of studies have investigated the effects of vitamins C and E on cognitive
function involving healthy populations with inconsistent results. The Women’s Health
Study (n = 6377 women over 65 years) reported no signiﬁcant effects on cognitive function
of vitamin E supplementation [325]. Analyses of data from participants of the Duke
Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies (n = 616) aged over 65 years found
that supplements of vitamins C and/or E did not inﬂuence the incidence of dementia
or AD [326]. Conversely, data from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (n = 894
participants aged ≥65 years) showed that a combination of vitamins C and E signiﬁcantly
decreased the rate of cognitive decline [327]. One study analyzed brain concentrations
of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol in 115 deceased patients with AD from the prospective
Rush Memory and Aging Project. Gamma-tocopherol brain levels were associated with
lower amyloid load and lower neuroﬁbrillary tangle severity, while alpha-tocopherol levels
were not associated with AD neuropathology lesions [328]. Data from the Age-Related
Eye Disease Study (n = 2166 participants followed for 6.9 years) found that a mixture of
anti-oxidant vitamins (vitamins E, C, beta-carotene), zinc, and copper did not have any
effect on any of six tests of cognitive function [329]. Likewise, the Women’s Antioxidant
Cardiovascular Study involving 2824 women with or at risk for CV disease who received a
combination of vitamin E, beta-carotene, and vitamin C or placebo showed no effects on
cognition of the multivitamin supplementation [330].

One of the vitamins on which research has remarkably increased in recent years
is vitamin D, which has been shown to play various roles in normal brain physiology
through its receptor (VDR), which is present in the neurons, glial cells of the hippocam-
pus, orbitofrontal-cortex, cingulate, amygdala, and thalamus [331]. Emerging evidence
suggests that low concentrations of vitamin D are potentially involved in the pathogenesis
of dementia. However, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. This is

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

27 of 60

of particular interest considering the high prevalence of vitamin D deﬁciency in older
adults and the crucial need to identify modiﬁable risk factors for dementia. Cross-sectional
studies have generally found that vitamin D concentrations are signiﬁcantly lower in AD
patients compared to healthy controls [332]. Some longitudinal cohort studies support an
association between low vitamin D concentrations and an increased risk of dementia and
cognitive decline [333–336], although there are also negative results [337,338]. The possibil-
ity of reverse causality remains to be answered. Intervention studies have failed to conﬁrm
the prevention of cognitive decline and AD with vitamin D supplementation [339–346].
Therefore, although there is certainty that vitamin D is involved in normal brain function
and that low vitamin D concentrations can occur in patients with dementia, there is no
clear evidence that supplementation with vitamin D can prevent or modify the course of
cognitive decline and dementia. The causal relationship between vitamin D and cognitive
impairment so far remains inconclusive. Likewise, a recent Cochrane review did not ﬁnd
evidence that any vitamin or mineral supplementation strategy for cognitively healthy
adults in mid or late life has a meaningful effect on cognitive decline or dementia, although
the authors caution that the available evidence does not permit deﬁnitive conclusions [345].

3.17. Multinutrient Combination

LipiDiDiet is the ﬁrst double-blind, multicentre, international RCT of a non-pharmacol
ogical intervention in prodromal AD [347,348]. The intervention is the multinutrient com-
bination (Fortasyn Connect) containing DHA, EPA, uridine monophosphate, choline,
vitamins B12, B6, C, E, and folic acid, phospholipids, and selenium. These nutrients were
selected based on their biological and neuroprotective properties, shown in experimental
models and in 3 previous clinical trials of 12-24 weeks treatment, in which improved mem-
ory was reported in mild, but not mild-to-moderate AD. LipiDiDiet focused on prodromal
AD with a longer duration of the intervention. A ﬁrst report involving 153 participants
treated with the intervention vs. 158 controls found no signiﬁcant effect on the neuropsycho-
logical test battery (NTB) score over two years of intervention, attributable to inadequate
statistical power. Group differences on secondary endpoints of disease progression mea-
suring cognition and function and hippocampal atrophy were observed [347]. A second
report of data from 162 participants (85 from the active group and 77 from the control
group) who completed 36 months of intervention found reduction in NTB decline, Clinical
Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes, memory, and brain atrophy measures [348]. Future studies
may assess further beneﬁts by integrating the multinutrient intervention with multidomain
interventions such as those discussed below (Section 5).

4. Other Non-Dietary Factors That Together with Diet May Influence Cognitive Decline
4.1. Physical Activity

Whilst dementia is a common condition in older people, no deﬁnitive treatments
for this condition are available. Recent works have pointed out that about 3% of all
dementia cases could be prevented by increasing levels of physical activity [18,19]. At the
same time, increasing literature shows the importance of physical activity and exercise for
preventing/slowing down the pathological process and dementia-related problems [20].
It is widely known that older people who are more physically active can maintain
cognition for a longer time than sedentary people [18]. In a large meta-analysis, including
several cohort studies and 33,816 individuals, higher physical activity levels were associated
with a signiﬁcant reduction in the onset of dementia in a linear dose–response manner [349].
At the same time, the effect of physical activity/exercise in MCI or in early phases of
dementia should be better explored. Some studies, in fact, have reported that physical
activity/exercise can delay the transition from MCI to dementia [350], but other recent
investigations have reported that a moderate-to-high intensity multi-component exercise
program is not beneﬁcial in people with early dementia [351].

In our opinion, this topic is important, since MCI is one of the most diffused risk factors
for dementia, with 10% to 15% of people with MCI becoming demented during one year of

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

28 of 60

observation [352,353]. Again, whilst several risk factors associated with a faster conversion
from MCI to dementia are already known, the research regarding sedentary behavior and
physical activity is still limited to a few investigations [354]. In one umbrella review of our
group, we have reported that physical activity/exercise was able to signiﬁcantly improve
global cognition and speciﬁc cognitive tests in MCI, even if supported by some biases,
suggesting a positive role of these interventions, but studies exploring the conversion to
dementia are still not present [354].

In people already affected by dementia, it seems that physical activity and exercise can
improve global cognition. This ﬁnding is probably due to several pathways. First, physical
activity/exercise improves the management of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hy-
pertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity), which are traditionally associated to poor cognitive
performance [355]. Furthermore, it is reported that physical activity/exercise may increase
neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in animal models [350,356]. Aerobic exercise is also
associated with an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a factor
that can stimulate neuronal cell growth and can maintain neurons in an optimal status [357].
Finally, using neuroimaging techniques, additional evidence for the impact of physical
activity on brain function and structure is reported in human beings [358–360]. Physical
activity/exercise might be a good predictor of long-term changes in brain structure, such
as brain volume [361].

Moreover, in people affected by dementia, physical activity/exercise interventions
may have other effects such as decreasing the risk of disability, falls, and neuropsychiatric
symptoms [354]. Again, we believe that all these outcomes are important. For example,
in one study, it was reported that the incidence of falls in dementia is extremely higher
and associated more frequently than controls to fractures and hypokinetic syndrome [362].
Physical activity/exercise may decrease the risk of falls by approximately 31% (204 falls
every 1000 people affected by dementia treated with this intervention). Since falls are among
the most important contributors of disability, we may hypothesize that the beneficial effect of
physical activity/exercise in decreasing the risk of falls may consequently improve activities
of daily living [363]. Moreover, another important consequence of physical activity/exercise
is to decrease the presence and the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms [364], in particular
depression [365]. Again, it seems that physical activity/exercise may increase the production
of neurotransmitters, neurotrophins, and BDNF as well as lead to a reduction of oxidative
stress and inflammatory levels, increase cerebral blood flow, regulate the hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal axis, and support neurogenesis and synaptogenesis [366]. Table 2 shows
the summary of systematic reviews and meta-analyses exploring the association of physical
activity with cognitive decline and/or incident dementia.

In conclusion, physical activity and exercise are good options for improving not
only cognitive aspects but also non-cognitive outcomes in people with MCI and demen-
tia. However, the literature is still sparse, and often, the combination with other non-
pharmacological interventions, such as diet, is still limited. In this sense, we warmly
suggest future intervention studies that better account for healthy lifestyle in the treatment
and prevention of MCI and dementia.

4.2. Sleep Pattern

There appears to be a bidirectional relationship between sleep pattern and dementia,
with disturbed sleeping representing both a risk factor for, and symptom of, the neurocog-
nitive syndrome [394–396]. Indeed, the notion that sleep quality and duration is critical
for cognitive processing has gained increasing attention. However, it is not simple to
establish causal relations, because there are vicious circles among different aspects of the
disease. It is currently accepted that sleep is essential to consolidate memory and to remove
the excess of beta-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulated in AD patients’
brains [397]. Sleep disturbances frequently precede AD pathological traits and cognitive
decline [398]. It has been proposed that sleep alterations (i.e., speciﬁc oscillatory patterns)
may be biomarkers to predict the risk of developing AD [394]. A systematic review and
meta-analysis found that sleep disturbances, including both short and long sleep duration,
insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), impaired circadian rhythm, and sleep quality,
were all associated with an increased relative risk of preclinical AD, cognitive impairment,
and AD [399].

Former studies found that sleep disturbances occur frequently in AD and other
forms of dementia [400,401]. Recent epidemiological investigations have shown that sleep
disorders in AD patients go far beyond the physiological changes that occur in normal
aging [399]. As pointed out in a meta-analysis including 5634 AD patients, the prevalence
was widely variable, estimated in 14–69% [402]. A retrospective study conducted in Japan
involving 684 AD patients found a prevalence of 21.3% [403]. Other studies reported that
over 60% of patients with MCI and AD had at least one clinical sleep disorder, of which
insomnia and OSA were the most common [404,405]. The inconsistent prevalence reported
may be related to the use of sleep questionnaires in many studies; understandably, cognitive
impairment in patients with AD renders the information on sleep disturbances provided
by a questionnaire not fully reliable. It has been reported that patients with AD can have
increased sleep onset latency and reduced time spent in restorative slow wave sleep and
rapid eye movement sleep [406]. In dementia with Lewy bodies, sleep disturbance may be
even more common than in AD, and they have been associated with rapid eye movement
sleep behavior disorder [407]. A relevant point is that sleep disturbances may signiﬁcantly
impact caregiver burden, caregiver sleep, and quality of life, and it is associated with a
higher risk of institutionalization [408,409].

Various medications are commonly used for sleep disturbance in dementia, but ev-
idence is lacking for most of them [410]. Melatonin may be beneﬁcial in some cases,
and it may help for nocturnal behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia
(BPSD), together with non-pharmacological interventions, which should be ﬁrst-line ther-
apy [411,412]. Trazadone may be effective for sleep disturbance and BPSD, in case the
pharmacological intervention is considered necessary [413]. Indeed, non-pharmacological
management has an important role due to the risk of adverse effects associated with
the use of hypnotics [414]. A systematic review and meta-analysis [415] explored non-
pharmacological treatments for sleep disturbance in MCI and dementia including 48 articles
with participants aged 67.3 to 89.4 years. Most studies (79%) had small samples (less than
50 participants), and many were conducted in long-term care settings (62%). Most recruited
participants had moderate–severe dementia (85%) with a wide range in MMSE scores (0 to
28.3/30), while only four studies examined MCI. Light therapy for one to ten weeks was
the most frequently studied intervention. with most studies (81.5%) showing improve-
ments on objective or subjective sleep measures, although with signiﬁcant clinical and

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

methodological heterogeneity that prevented a deﬁnitive conclusion. There were seven
multi-modal intervention studies, all incorporating light exposure, and six of them reported
improved sleep. Other less frequently used interventions included electrotherapy stimula-
tion, physical exercises/activities, acupressure/acupuncture, and mindfulness/cognitive
behavioral therapy. The authors performed a meta-analysis of data from RCTs reporting a
statistically signiﬁcant improvement in sleep efﬁciency between multi-modal interventions
and controls, favoring the combined interventions (bright light, multidomain, and other
therapies) [415]. Therefore, non-pharmacological sleep interventions seem useful, partic-
ularly multidomain approaches, but the available studies are heterogeneous and small.
More research evaluating the efﬁcacy of multimodal interventions in community-dwellers
and those with MCI is still needed.

4.3. Social Engagement

Social engagement emerged about two decades ago as a potential protective factor
against cognitive decline and dementia [416,417]. Afterwards, other evidence appeared
conﬁrming these ﬁndings [418–420]. Likewise, late-life leisure activities involving physical,
mental, and social domains have been reported to be key contributors to brain protec-
tion [421,422]. A meta-analysis comprising data from nineteen longitudinal studies up
to July 2012 found that low social participation, greater loneliness, and less frequent
social contact were all associated with an increased risk of dementia [423]. A more re-
cent meta-analysis [424] including 31 cohort and two case-control studies comprising
2,370,452 participants found that poor social engagement indices were associated with
increased dementia risk, including having a poor social network and poor social sup-
port. In long-term studies (≥10 years), good social engagement was modestly protective,
with moderate heterogeneity and signiﬁcant publication bias for this outcome. Loneliness
showed a non-signiﬁcant trend of association with increased risk without substantial het-
erogeneity or publication bias. However, only four studies could be included, and of these,
only one examined loneliness with a validated scale, with the remaining studies relying
on a single question or a few questions in questionnaires. In subgroup analyses, studies
adjusted for depression showed that overall, poor social engagement was associated with
an even greater (56%) increased risk of dementia with no heterogeneity or publication bias.
Likewise, when considering only the highest quality studies, the association between poor
social engagement and dementia risk was maintained at approximately 55% increased risk,
with only mild heterogeneity [424]. This is strong evidence for poor social engagement as
a risk factor for dementia, which encourages interventions targeting social isolation and
disengagement for dementia prevention.

Various neurobiological mechanisms have been suggested to help explain the direct
or indirect association of social engagement and dementia risk [416]. One of them is the
stress hypothesis, in which a hypersecretion of glucocorticoids in the stress response causes
accelerated hippocampal degeneration with a consequent tendency to cognitive decline or
dementia [425]. Another hypothesis states that that social engagement attenuates the risk
of neurodegenerative disease by minimizing cardiovascular risk factors. Nevertheless, the
best supporting evidence exists for a third hypothesis, which postulates that neuropatho-
logical and atrophic changes that may manifest as cognitive deﬁcits in some people may
not cause symptoms in others who have higher cognitive reserve [426–428]. This was
convincingly demonstrated in the Nun Study, in which about one-third of cognitively
normal nuns were found to have high levels of neuropathology consistent with AD at
autopsy [419,429]. Similarly, in the Rush Memory and Aging Study, in those with more ex-
tensive social networks, more extensive neuropathological lesions were associated with less
deleterious changes in working and semantic memory compared to those with limited so-
cial networks [420]. A recent meta-analysis conducted in nine studies evaluating the effect
of cognitive reserve on progression to MCI or dementia showed that high cognitive reserve
was related to a 47% reduced relative risk of MCI or dementia. Considering residual-based
cognitive reserve (cognitive residual of neuropathology and as composite psychosocial

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

33 of 60

proxies, i.e., education), the risk was further reduced (62% and 48%, respectively) [428].
These results strongly support that cognitive reserve protects against MCI and dementia
progression above and beyond the effect of AD-related structural pathology and biomark-
ers. Recent data conﬁrmed the cognitive reverse model. A prospective study analyzed data
from 2099 participants aged 65 or over from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study—
Wales (CFAS-Wales). Dementia was ascertained through the comprehensive judgment
symptoms of geriatric mental state automated geriatric examination for computer-assisted
taxonomy (GMS-AGECAT). Subjective cognitive decline was evaluated by two questions
in the baseline interview. Cognitive reserve indicators were derived from three previously
identiﬁed factors: early life education, midlife occupational complexity, and late-life cogni-
tive activities. Baseline subjective cognitive decline and low cognitive reserve signiﬁcantly
increased the risk of dementia after two years of follow-up. Statistically signiﬁcant associa-
tion between subjective cognitive decline and dementia was found only in the low- and
medium-level cognitive reserve group, indicating that cognitive reserve attenuated sub-
jective cognitive decline-associated risk of developing dementia [430]. Recent analyses of
data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, involving 1697 dementia-free participants
at baseline (mean age: 79.6 years) followed up to 21 years, found that the highest cognitive
reserve was related to a slower decline in global cognition, episodic memory, and working
memory compared to the lowest in multi-adjusted mixed-effect models. This association
remained signiﬁcant among participants with high AD pathology or gross infarcts [431].
Another recent retrospective cross-sectional study using data from 2171 participants of the
Framingham Study (mean age 63 ± 10 years) examined the association of individual forms
of social support with a global neuroanatomical measure of early AD vulnerability and
cognition. Participants who were free of dementia, stroke, or other neurological conditions
at baseline underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological testing.
Cognitive resilience was deﬁned as the modiﬁcation of total cerebral volume’s association
with cognition. The results showed that social support in the form of supportive listening
was associated with greater cognitive resilience, independently modifying the association
between lower total cerebral volume and poorer cognitive function that would otherwise
indicate increased AD vulnerability at the preclinical stage [432].

Thus, these studies support potential links between socialization and cognitive reserve.
However, a limitation in these studies is reverse causality: dementia could lead to social
isolation and social withdrawal because prodromal and subclinical signs and symptoms of
dementia may be present even a decade before its onset. Some studies have attempted to
address this issue by excluding incident dementia cases early in the observational period,
but longitudinal studies with longer follow-ups are still needed to clarify the possibility of
reverse causation.

Erikson’s model developed in the 1950s proposed that adult psychosocial development
outlines the signiﬁcance of successful involvement within one’s relationships, work, and
community for healthy aging. Data from participants of the Study of Adult Development
including 159 over-75-year-old men from both higher and lower socioeconomic strata
evaluated whether late-life depression mediated the relationship between Eriksonian
development and speciﬁc domains of cognitive functioning (i.e., executive functioning and
memory). The results indicated that higher midlife Eriksonian psychosocial development
at ages 30–47 was associated with stronger global cognitive functioning and executive
functioning and lower levels of depression three to four decades later (ages 75–85) with no
signiﬁcant association between Eriksonian development and late-life memory. Late-life
depression mediated the relationship between Eriksonian development and both global
cognition and executive functioning. These ﬁndings have important implications for
understanding the lasting beneﬁts of psychosocial engagement in mid-adulthood for late-
life cognitive and emotional health. Furthermore, it may be that less successful psychosocial
development increases levels of depression, making individuals more vulnerable to speciﬁc
areas of cognitive decline [433].

In summary, while understanding that no deﬁnitive statements about causation can
be made, interventions to improve poor social engagement may potentially reduce incident
dementia. This potential warrants well-designed trials including investigation of potential
neurobiological, behavioral, and social mechanisms to validate the plausibility of the
cognitive reserve hypothesis generated by observational cohort studies.

5. Multidomain lifestyle-based interventions

Due to the complex, multifactorial, and heterogeneous nature of age-related cognitive
decline and of late-onset AD and dementia, it is unlikely that a single intervention can
have a signiﬁcant impact. A crucial consideration regarding preventive interventions
is the fact that multiple risk and protective factors for cognitive decline and dementia
usually coexist and interact across the lifespan to determine the overall risk of dementia.
Therefore, interventions targeting several risk factors and mechanisms simultaneously
may be required for optimal preventive effects. Up to now, the results of three large
multidomain lifestyle-based prevention trials have been published: the Finnish Geriatric
Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) [10], the
French Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) [243], and the Dutch Prevention
of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care (PreDIVA) [434].

The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disabil-
ity (FINGER) is the ﬁrst large, long-term RCT to demonstrate that a two-year multidomain
lifestyle-based intervention by improving vascular and lifestyle-related risk factors can
preserve cognitive performance and reduce the risk of cognitive decline among older
adults at increased risk of dementia [10]. The FINGER RCT comprised 1260 older adults
aged 60-77 years; the multidomain intervention delivered by trained professionals through
individual and group sessions consisted of dietary counseling, exercise, cognitive training,
social activities, and monitoring and management of vascular and metabolic risk factors.
The control group was offered regular health advice. After two years, the intervention
showed signiﬁcant beneﬁcial effects on the neuropsychological test battery composite score
(25% more improvement vs. control), executive functioning (83% more improvement),
processing speed (150% more improvement), and complex memory tasks (40% more im-
provement) [10]. There were also favorable effects on BMI reduction, improved adherence
to dietary guidelines and recommendations [435], and increase in physical activity [10].

The other two RCTs, MAPT [243] and PreDIVA [434], reported negative results for
their primary outcomes although subsequent subgroup analyses showed some beneﬁt.
The MAPT RCT enrolled 1680 community dwellers aged 70 years or older who had
either subjective memory complaints, limitation in one IADL, or slow gait speed. In two
arms, participants received a multidomain lifestyle intervention consisting in cognitive
training and counseling on nutrition and physical activity, either alone or in combination
with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. In other two arms, participants received only
the omega-3 fatty acid supplementation or placebo. The primary outcome was change
in a cognitive composite score. Although the trial failed to meet its primary outcome,
beneﬁcial intervention effects were observed when both groups receiving the multidomain
lifestyle intervention were combined. Beneﬁcial effects were also reported for speciﬁc
subgroups: those with brain amyloid pathology or severe cognitive impairment (CAIDE
risk score ≥6 points) [243,436]. The PreDIVA trial enrolled 3526 unselected older adults
aged 70-78 years from general practices [434]. The multidomain intervention consisted of
advice concerning healthy lifestyle and intensive vascular care and risk factor management,
including initiation or optimization of antithrombotics and pharmacological treatments for
hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia, when necessary vs. regular care for the control
group. After six years of intervention, there was no difference in the primary outcome
(i.e., dementia incidence) between the intervention and control groups. However, in
the exploratory analyses, a reduction in the incidence of dementia was observed among
participants with untreated hypertension who adhered to the treatment during the trial.

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

35 of 60

Several issues may help to explain the dissimilar results of the last two trials, including
the difference in the selection of the studied populations; also the fact that the interven-
tion should start early enough to reduce the long-term exposure to the risk factors and
should have a long-term follow-up to make evident any beneﬁt for a robust outcome such
as dementia.

Innovative proposals of multidomain prevention trials have started to use novel
technologies, such as eHealth and mHealth, to optimize the delivery of multidomain
interventions. For example, the Healthy Aging Through Internet Counselling in the Elderly
(HATICE), a European open-label 18-month RCT testing the efﬁcacy of an Internet platform
in improving self-management of CV risk factors for prevention of CV disease and cognitive
decline in over-65 participants reported a modest but signiﬁcant improvement in CV risk
proﬁles with the interactive Internet intervention after 18 months [437]. If preventive
interventions through Internet or via mobile applications prove to be feasible and effective
and induce sustained behavioral changes on a large scale, it could support self-management
and be a cost-effective way to reach and involve a large population across the world.

Following the encouraging results of the FINGER trial, the World-Wide (WW)-FINGERS
network was launched in July 2017 [438]. By collectively convoking international research
teams, WW-FINGERS aims to facilitate data sharing and joint analyses of studies across
country borders, and strengthen the potential evidence-base for multidomain lifestyle inter-
ventions worldwide in at-risk populations from diverse geographical and cultural settings,
by means of local and cultural adaptations of content and delivery method of interventions.
For example, it is proposed that dietary counseling will follow national recommendations
and take into account country- or region-speciﬁc habits, and pharmacological CV risk
factor management based on national care guidelines. Several countries worldwide have
joined the WW-FINGERS network and are currently at different stages of planning and
conducting their FINGER-type prevention trials [438].

6. Proposed Mechanisms Mediating the Effects of Nutrition and Other Lifestyle
Factors on Cognitive Decline
6.1. Oxidative Stress and Chronic Inﬂammation

Aging and age-related degenerative diseases have been linked to a pro-oxidant and
pro-inﬂammatory state, which leads to the damage of cellular components. The brain
tissue is highly susceptible to oxidative damage because cerebral metabolism necessitates
large quantities of energy, is dependent on aerobic conditions, and is rich in oxidizable
compounds such as PUFAs and in transition metals that facilitate free radicals generation.
Furthermore, compared to other body structures, the brain has low concentrations of
antioxidant systems. This may help to explain why the brain tissue is so susceptible
to damage due to an accumulation of neurotoxic peptides such as amyloid-beta [439].
In studies performed in autopsies from AD patients, brains exhibited increased protein
oxidative damage, glycol-oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and reduced antioxidant enzyme
systems [440].

There is growing evidence linking neuroinﬂammation to AD pathogenesis. Misfolded
and aggregated proteins, such as amyloid, bind to toll-like receptors (TLRs) and CD4
in the microglia, starting innate immune responses with the production and release of
inﬂammatory mediators [441,442]. Alois Alzheimer already had described the microglia
surrounding amyloid plaques and tangles describing the disease for the ﬁrst time, but
the key role of microglia inﬂammation has been investigated only recently. In normal
conditions, neuroinﬂammation is a crucial protective mechanism. Conversely, when it
becomes excessive, chronic, and uncontrolled, it may become damaging by the continuous
release of cytokines, proteolytic enzymes, free radicals, complementary factors, nitric
oxide, or excitatory amino acids [442,443]. Amyloid-beta accumulation further induces
neuroinﬂammation, which produces more amyloid-beta aggregation, leading to a vicious
cycle of propagating injury [444]. Increased neuroinﬂammation has been shown in MCI
and AD patients vs. healthy controls using positron emission tomography and imaging
with radioligand C-11-DAA1106 [445]. Amyloid-beta may promote a preponderance of

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

36 of 60

macrophage (M)1 pro-inﬂammatory cells vs. M2 (anti-inﬂammatory cells) and decrease the
switching of cellular phenotypes to lessen destruction [442,443]. Excess of nitric oxide may
also contribute to induce inﬂammatory signals, which are key players in neurodegenerative
diseases with resulting neuronal death [446].

6.2. Overweight and Obesity

The well-known CV and metabolic risk factors, both in isolation and combined, have
been recognized as risk factors for cognitive decline and AD as well [18,447]. The metabolic
syndrome—namely, the simultaneous occurrence of diverse risk factors (i.e., central obesity,
hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and prothrombotic state)—is directly related
to increased visceral adiposity in midlife as a consequence of overeating and sedentary
lifestyle with harmful consequences in late life [448]. Obesity is currently a pandemic at
all ages [449–451]. Currently, there is a large availability of inexpensive processed food,
full of calories and poor in nutrients, which together with little physical activity have
paradoxically contributed to the increased life expectancy in the last century. Overeating
and a sedentary lifestyle are considered powerful risk factors for the genesis of chronic
non-communicable diseases, which are becoming unsustainable [452]. A systematic review
of twenty-eight cohort studies conducted from 2003 to 2013 with a follow-up range between
ﬁve and forty years reported up to a 2.44-fold increased risk of late-onset dementia in
participants who were overweight and obese in midlife [453].

Although the precise mechanism behind this association is not yet completely clear,
various possible mechanisms have been suggested. Overweight and obesity are strong risk
factors for cardiometabolic disease (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia), which
are also recognized risk factors for dementia [18,447]. However, these factors have been
taken into account in most studies as potential confounders. Obese persons with diabetes
had higher concentrations of plasma amyloid proteins [454], and those with history of being
overweight or obese in midlife had lower blood–brain barrier integrity after twenty-ﬁve
years of follow-up [455]. Another source of inﬂammation that may trigger systemic and
neuroinﬂammation lies in the accumulation and activation of macrophages around the
excess fat cells that accompany obesity. These immune cells present in adipose tissue can
produce pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor
–TNF-) as well as less anti-inﬂammatory cytokines (e.g., adiponectin and IL-10), which
sustain the state of low-grade chronic inﬂammation [456]. Obesity has been also associated
with a switch from M2 macrophages to the pro-inﬂammatory M1 phenotype [442,457].

Lipids contained in the diet, and more so saturated fatty acids, induce inﬂammatory re-
sponses on microglia, with local cytokine secretion, i.e., hypothalamic nuclear factor kappa
B (NF-kB), which may promote the apoptosis of neurons linked to body weight control,
glucose homeostasis, central regulation of energy balance, and blood pressure [458,459].
Obesity may induce alterations in the developing brain of children and adolescents [460],
with long-term adverse consequences. Contrariwise, weight reduction, low-calorie diets,
and frequent consumption of food rich in anti-oxidant/anti-inﬂammatory properties, or
food patterns with combinations of them, have been associated with reduced levels of
systemic and adipose tissue inﬂammation markers [461]. Clinical studies have shown a
link between insulin resistance and cognition [462] as well as between glucose regulation
abnormalities in type 2 diabetes and cognitive function [463]. Accordingly, diet interven-
tions that improved insulin resistance have been associated with decreased inﬂammatory
cytokines concentrations and improved cognition [464,465].

6.3. Microbiota

The human gut microbiota comprises trillions of symbiotic microorganisms, which
are crucial for immune and brain health and disease [466]. The main component of gut
microbiota is bacteria, of which most are strict anaerobes, but it also comprises fungi and
viruses. The main reported phyla in gut microbiota from adults are Bacteroidetes and Fir-
micutes, while Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria are found in relatively low amounts [467].

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

37 of 60

The number of gut microbes within the gastrointestinal tract is estimated to be approxi-
mately 100 trillion, which is 10 times the number of cells found in the human body. The
gut microbiome is about 150 times greater than that of the human genome and encodes
100-fold more unique genes than our genome, which suggests their vast possibilities in
inﬂuencing human health. This microbiome shows vast diversity amongst different popu-
lation groups and has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on human health, disease state, and overall
well-being [468]. Several factors may alter the composition of gut microbiota, such as
diet, antibiotic exposure, and infection, which may promote the loss of homeostasis and
have been implicated in the development of various diseases, including obesity, metabolic
syndrome, colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes, allergies, inﬂammatory bowel disease, heart
failure, and neurodegenerative disorders [469–472]. Recent investigations suggests that
the amyloid cascade model does not fully explain AD pathogenesis and that alterations
in the gut microbiome may play a signiﬁcant role in the genesis and progression of the
disease [473].

The bilateral interaction of the gastrointestinal tract and the brain was recognized
for the ﬁrst time in the 1880s by William James and Carl Lange, proposing that this
gut–brain communication could play a role in emotional regulation. At present, the
microbiota has been added to this connection (microbiota–gut–brain axis), and it is believed
to constitute a two-way homeostatic pathway, through which the gastrointestinal tract
exerts modiﬁcations on brain function and vice versa [474–476].

This microbiota–gut–brain axis bidirectional communication occurs through various
pathways. (1) First, over thirty hormones and neurotransmitters are produced in the gas-
trointestinal tract. These hormones affect the brain centers that regulate metabolic control,
appetite, and behavioral pathways linked to reward, anxiety, mood, memory, stress, etc.
They can also act locally and activate afferent vagal terminals in the gut, thus generating
afferent signals [474,475,477]. Through entero-endocrine cells, enteric neurons, and gut
microbiota, the gastrointestinal tract can as well synthesize neurotransmitters that inﬂuence
the functioning of both the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system (CNS) [475].
Neurotransmitters that impact several brain functions, including cognition (i.e., serotonin,
dopamine, acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, epinephrine, and norepinephrine),
can all be synthesized in the gastrointestinal tract [478]. (2) In neuroanatomic communi-
cation, the main neuroanatomical communication between the enteric nervous system
and the CNS is provided by the vagus nerve (parasympathetic input) and spinal nerves
(sympathetic input). Interestingly, 90% of vagal ﬁbers are afferent, suggesting that the brain
is primarily a receiver of information, rather than a transmitter, with regard to gut–brain
communication [479]. The vagus nerve has receptors for some hormones and neurotrans-
mitters produced in the gastrointestinal tract, such as serotonin, ghrelin, cholecystokinin,
and YY peptide, as well as receptors for bacterial fragments, such as lipopolisaccaride
(LPS), whose activation can signal the brain regarding gut events. Furthermore, short-chain
fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the gut microbiota can also activate afferent ﬁbers of the
vagus nerve [480]. In support of this bidirectional communication, vagotomy has recently
been shown to prevent the beneﬁcial neurobehavioral effects induced by probiotics [481].
(3) Activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis leads to the release of
cortisol by the adrenal gland during acute stress. In normal conditions, the neuroendocrine
stress response is counter-regulated by a negative feedback mechanism. However, if stress
is exaggerated and/or persistent, excess cortisol can be deleterious [482]. Stress can cause
increased gastrointestinal motility, secretions, permeability, and also adverse effects on
the gut microbiota [483]. Contrariwise, changes in microbiota can also modify the stress
response. A study showed that germ-free animals had an exaggerated HPA stress response
compared to animals colonized with beneﬁcial bacteria [484]. Another preclinical study
demonstrated that microbiota can modulate the stress-dependent activation of pituitary
and adrenal glands [485]. It is well recognized that chronic stress can affect the brain (and
in particular hippocampal) functioning, including learning and memory processes, as well
as mood regulation [482,486]. (4) Metabolites produced by bacteria, such as SCFAs, in-

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4080

38 of 60

cluding acetate, propionate, and butyrate, can also inﬂuence the gut microbiota–gut–brain
crosstalk [487]. SCFAs are produced by bacterial fermentation of substrate (mostly dietary
ﬁber) in the large intestine. The functions of SCFAs are not yet totally clariﬁed, but it has
been suggested that they may have local effects in the colon (e.g., decrease inﬂammation,
improve mucus production), affect gene expression by inhibiting histone deacetylases,
impact hormone regulation (e.g., glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide YY), and interact
with vagal afferents. Furthermore, SCFAs can also regulate blood–brain barrier integrity
and function, acting directly on the brain [488]. (5) The gastrointestinal tract contains about
70% to 80% of the body’s immune cells [489]. Components of Gram-negative bacteria
such as LPS can interact with TLRs, inﬂuencing the immune response and the production
of inﬂammatory cytokines [490], which can reach or send signals to the CNS through
several mechanisms and result in neuroinﬂammation [471,491]. Moreover, the CNS reg-
ulates innate immune responses through neuronal and hormonal routes [492]. (6) BDNF
is involved in synaptic and structural plasticity, learning, and memory, and it has been
associated with the pathophysiology and treatment of several neurological diseases [493].
A preclinical study showed that germ-free mice had reduced BDNF expression in the
cerebral cortex and hippocampus compared to controls [484]. Germ-free mice had lower
BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and amygdala [494], while
animals supplemented with probiotics or prebiotics showed increased BDNF levels in
various brain regions [495]. (7) A number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors can inﬂuence
the microbiota–gut–brain axis. These include genetic and epigenetic factors, as well as
environmental factors, such as exercise, medications, and consumption of probiotics [476].
Diet composition and nutritional status have repeatedly been shown to be crucial modi-
ﬁable factors regulating the gut microbiota across the lifespan and under various health
conditions [496].

Most investigations on host–microbiota interactions come from animal models, which
represent crucial tools for studying the various pathways linking the gut and the brain.
Nevertheless, there are complexities and marked limitations in translating complex human
disease to reductionist animal models. Studies in humans are few and small. For example,
several bacteria taxa (i.e., Bacteroides Actinobacteria, Ruminococcus, Lachnospiraceae, and
Selenomonadales) were found to be different in forty-three AD patients compared to those
in healthy controls using RNA sequencing [497].

In summary, despite the preclinical evidence, well-designed clinical studies are still
lacking to elucidate the role of the microbiota or the microbiota–gut–brain axis on the
prevention and treatment of cognitive decline.

6.4. Autophagy

The efﬁciency of autophagy declines with age. This crucial mechanism mediates
the degradation and recycling of cellular proteins and clearance of misfolded proteins
and aggregates such as amyloid, which is one of the most studied pathophysiological
mechanisms in AD [498]. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, a funda-
mental player of cellular senescence, affects glucose metabolism, mitochondrial function,
energy production, and autophagy in the brain. These events are crucial in age-associated
cognitive decline and AD [499].

6.5. Prothrombotic State

Vascular disorders are other features characteristic of AD (e.g., cerebrovascular dys-
function, blood–brain barrier disruption, and decreased cerebral blood ﬂow) as well as a
prothrombotic state (e.g., activated platelets, clot formation, decreased ﬁbrinolysis). Fib-
rinogen accumulates with amyloid-beta, which triggers amyloid-beta ﬁbrillization and the
generation of ﬁbrin resistant to degradation. A study showed higher platelet activating
factor acetylhydrolase activity and higher oxidized-LDL concentrations in AD patients
compared to healthy controls [500].

7. Summary/Conclusions

The aging of world populations is an undeniable reality that leads to an inexorable
increase in aging-related cognitive decline and its worst manifestation, dementia. The
accumulation of negative results in the last decades together with the heavy ﬁnancial
burden while searching for effective pharmacological therapies suggest that this is the
wrong path. Compelling evidence has accumulated on the critical role that adequate
nutrition together with other lifestyle factors can play in the maintenance of cognitive
health and in the prevention of cognitive decline and its progression to dementia. It is
credible that this must be the path to travel.

However, the illusion that one or few nutritional components can be effective in this
complex battle is short-lived. Nutrition research has shifted its focus in recent years from
examining the effects of foods or nutrients in isolation to focusing the attention on the
effects of foods/nutrients combinations in dietary patterns [17], which the results presented
in this review of the ﬁeld of cognitive function once more corroborate as a wiser choice.
In this review, which was more focused on nutrition but without neglecting the other
crucial contributing lifestyle factors, it is clear that no single food or nutrient is the magic
bullet to prevent dementia, even with some that have shown potential neuroprotective
actions, but none with deﬁnitive answers as independent determinants of cognitive decline
and dementia. Most of these components have been extensively studied in vitro or in
experimental animals, but evidence is lacking in studies involving humans because most
studies have small samples, short follow-up periods, or have unsuitable designs. On
the contrary, it is reasonable to think that the combinations of foods and nutrients, as
shown by studies on dietary patterns, such as the MedDiet, DASH, and MIND diets,
comprising mostly plant-based unprocessed or minimally processed foods and nutrients
that are considered neuroprotective, such as vegetables, EVOO, berries, fruits, and nuts,
are the ideal way to counteract the increase in the decline of cognitive functions. Clearly,
to this must be added other essential factors such as physical activity, sleep quality, and
socialization, among non-dietary determinants. A recent systematic review and Bayesian
network meta-analysis aiming to determine and compare the contributions of modiﬁable
risk factors with the prevention of dementia in older adults with analyses of data from forty-
three cohort studies deﬁned factors associated with lower risks of all-cause dementia. These
factors included no sleep disturbances, a high level of education, no history of diabetes,
non-obese patients, no smoking history, living with family members, participation in
physical exercise, abstinence from drinking, and no history of hypertension. The ﬁndings
provide reliable support for the hypothesis that modiﬁable somatic and lifestyle factors are
strong predictors of all-cause dementia [19].

It is reasonable to anticipate that complex diseases come from the combination of a
series of factors over time, and accordingly, it is logical to foresee that preventive measures
should be similarly combined. It should be learned from the accumulated evidence that
the design of future studies should be multi-component from the nutritional viewpoint
(combinations of foods and nutrients) jointly with other lifestyle aspects.

Although the mechanisms that may explain the beneﬁt of healthy eating patterns
and other lifestyle factors in the prevention of cognitive deterioration are not yet fully
clear, studies on the anti-inﬂammatory and anti-oxidant properties, on the inﬂuence on the
microbiota, on vascular disorders and prothrombotic states, and on mediators controlling
the clearance of misfolded proteins such as amyloid may help explain the observed beneﬁt.
Dementia is particularly feared among people for the possibility of losing self-sufﬁciency

and the need to depend on others. It is frequently perceived as a fatal fate for which there
is little to be done to avoid it. Perhaps there is more awareness among the general public of
the opportunity to prevent cardiovascular disease but less understanding of the fact that
dementia can be largely prevented with a long-life proper nutrition and healthy lifestyle.
Promoting this knowledge can be viewed as an opportunity to persuade people in adhering
to conscious and healthy food and lifestyle choices leading to an active and healthier aging.
