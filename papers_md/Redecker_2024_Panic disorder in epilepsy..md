A 51-year-old woman showed structural epilepsy following an atypical, nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage in 
the right frontal area. Despite successful seizure control with lamotrigine, she developed severe morning anxiety 
and  panic  attacks,  leading  to  agoraphobia,  social  withdrawal,  and  psychogenic  nonepileptic  seizures.  Neuro-
psychiatric  and  psychological  assessments  confirmed  an  anxiety  disorder  with  no  significant  symptoms  of 
depression.  The  patient  received  various  psychopharmacological  treatments  with  limited  success.  This  case 
report  illustrates  that  managing  panic  disorder  in  patients  with  structural  epilepsy  requires  a  comprehensive 
treatment  approach  that  includes  pharmacotherapy  and  psychotherapy.  Differential  diagnosis  and  accurate 
treatment are crucial because of the symptom overlap between panic attacks and peri-ictal fear. Screenings in-
struments such as the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) can aid in assessing anxiety-related symptoms. First- 
line  pharmacotherapy  with  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors,  especially  sertraline,  or  venlafaxine  can 
effectively reduce panic attacks and can be recommended in patients with epilepsy. Psychotherapy, particularly 
cognitive-behavioral therapy, is the treatment of choice. Referral to a psychiatrist is indicated when symptoms 
are severe or refractory to treatment.   

1. Illustrative case 

A 51-year-old woman developed structural epilepsy after an atypical, 
nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) situated in the right frontal 
area.  The  patient  underwent  a  decompressive  hemicraniectomy  with 
hematoma  evacuation  and  experienced  subsequent  focal  to  bilateral 
tonic-clonic seizures. She also developed physical disabilities, including 
paralysis  of  the left  arm,  which improved  during  rehabilitation.  Elec-
troencephalographic  (EEG)  monitoring  showed  a  generalized  slowing 
and right centro-temporo-parietal breach rhythm. No epileptiform dis-
charges were detected. 

Initial  brain  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  confirmed  the 
presence  of  the  ICH.  However,  the  patient  subsequently  avoided  un-
dergoing further MRI due to agoraphobic fears. Response to antiseizure 
medication (ASM) was as follows: Levetiracetam and lacosamide were 
discontinued due to side effects (irritability) and lack of efficacy. Under 
lamotrigine, the patient was seizure free. Initially, the patient’s condi-
tion showed a positive course, allowing her to actively engage in daily 
activities,  including  driving  a  car,  without  perceiving  any  subjective 
limitations. 

Approximately 11 months after ICH, the patient began experiencing 
severe  morning  anxiety  characterized  by  body  shaking,  shortness  of 
breath, and a sense of impending doom. These symptoms progressed to 
frequent panic attacks, leading to an emergency hospitalization due to 
chest pain and a fear of dying. The patient also developed agoraphobia 
(fear and avoidance of situations/places where escape might be difficult 
or  help  may  not  be  available),  social  withdrawal,  and  psychogenic 
nonepileptic seizures. 

Neuropsychiatric  and  psychological  examinations  confirmed  the 
presence  of  an  anxiety  disorder  and  ruled  out  significant  depressive 
symptoms. In addition to a clinical interview, the German versions of the 
Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder  7  (GAD-7,  total  value  17,  “severe  anxi-
ety”) [1,2], the Beck Anxiety Index (BAI, total value 11, “mild anxiety”) 
[3,4], the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II, total value 12, “minimal 
depression”) [5,6], and Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory in 
Epilepsy  (NDDI-E,  total  value  13,  “depression  unlikely”)  [7,8],  were 
administered.  Various  psychopharmacological 
treatments  were 
attempted  to  manage  the  patient’s  affective  symptoms.  However, 
finding an effective treatment regimen proved challenging.

2. Anxiety disorders 

The prevalence of anxiety disorders is significantly higher in people 
with epilepsy (PWE) compared with the general population (20.2 % vs. 
9.4 %) [9]. Anxiety disorders in epilepsy are associated with reduced 
quality  of  life  [10],  increased  health  care  utilization  [11],  decreased 
social function, and a higher severity of epilepsy [12]. Moreover, it is 
important  to  highlight  the  association  between  anxiety  and  suicidal 
behavior in PWE (for a review, see Munger Clary [13]). Johnson et al. 
[14] summarized that anxiety-related symptoms are stronger predictors 
of health-related quality of life than seizure type/frequency or depres-
sive symptoms. 

In a prospective clinic-based survey [15], we demonstrated increased 
rates  of  anxiety  disorders,  particularly  social  phobia  (7.2  %  point 
prevalence), specific phobia (6.2 % point prevalence), and panic disor-
der (5.1 % point prevalence), in patients with refractory focal epilepsy 
when  compared  with  the  general  population  in  Germany  (4-week 
prevalence of 1.1 %). As seen in the review by Johnson et al. [14], the 
prevalence rates of panic disorder were 2 to 3 times higher among PWE 
compared to healthy controls. These results emphasize that panic dis-
order is more prevalent among PWE, warranting careful diagnosis and 
management [14,16]. 

2.1. Clinical signs and symptoms of panic disorder 

Panic attacks are characterized by sudden intense fear and discom-
fort (for a review, see Craske and Barlow [17]), accompanied by somatic 
and cognitive reactions (Table 1). Panic attacks usually peak within a 
few minutes and can last up to 30 min [18]. In general, patients with 
panic  attacks  cannot  identify  an  external  trigger,  such  as  a  specific 
phobic object, and therefore report that the panic attack occur sponta-
neously. The presence of recurrent panic attacks may lead to a diagnosis 
of  panic  disorder,  especially  if  there  is  persistent  worry  about 

Table 1 
Diagnostic criteria of panic disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5; adapted from [22]).  

A. Recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense 
fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during which time 
four (or more) of the following symptoms occur: 
Note: The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state.  

▪  Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.  
▪  Sweating.  
▪  Trembling or shaking.  
▪  Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.  
▪  Feelings of choking.  
▪  Chest pain or discomfort.  
▪  Nausea or abdominal distress.  
▪  Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint.  
▪  Chills or heat sensations.  
▪  Paresthesia.  
▪  Derealization/depersonalization.  
▪  Fear of losing control or “going crazy.”  
▪  Fear of dying. 

B. At least one of the attacks has been followed by 1 month (or more) of one or both of 

the following:  

1.  Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their consequences 

(e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, “going crazy”).  

2.  A significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks (e.g., behaviors 
designed to avoid having panic attacks, such as avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar 
situations). 

C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a 
drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, 
cardiopulmonary disorders). 

D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., panic 

attacks do not occur only in response to feared social situations, as in social anxiety 
disorder; in response to circumscribed phobic objects or situations, as in specific 
phobia; in response to obsessions, as in obsessive–compulsive disorder; in response 
to reminders of traumatic events, as in posttraumatic stress disorder; or in response 
to separation from attachment figures, as in separation anxiety disorder).  

experiencing  future  panic  attacks  and/or  maladaptive  behavioral 
changes—for  example,  avoidance  behaviors  (Table  1).  Based  on  the 
recent  International  Classification  of  Disease  11th  Revision  (ICD-11), 
panic disorder and panic attacks can be coded separately when panic 
attacks do not meet the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder [19]. Of 
note, there is a significant overlap between panic disorder and agora-
phobia [17], as seen in our case report. Agoraphobia is an anxiety dis-
order characterized by intense fear or panic attacks in situations where a 
person perceives the environment as dangerous without having support 
or means of escape [17]. Patients with agoraphobia often avoid unfa-
miliar situations like open areas, crowds, public transportation, shop-
ping centers or places outside of their home. 

2.2. Differential diagnosis considerations 

Distinguishing between peri-ictal fear and panic attacks is crucial for 
an  accurate  diagnosis  and  appropriate  treatment  (for  a  review,  see 
Kanner [20]). As outlined by Hingray et al. [21], anxiety symptoms can 
be  classified  as  peri-ictal  (preictal,  ictal,  postictal)  and  interictal 
(Table 2A), and these manifestations can occur in any combination. Ictal 
anxiety (“ictal panic”) is commonly associated with focal aware seizures 
of the mesial temporal lobe and is sometimes not correctly diagnosed 
until patients develop focal to bilateral tonic-clonic and/or focal non- 
aware seizures [20]. By contrast, interictal panic disorder and anxiety 
disorders  are  not  related  to  epilepsy.  To  differentiate  ictal  fear  and 
interictal anxiety, focusing on central worries is useful for differential 
diagnosis.  For  example,  panic  attacks  associated  with  panic  disorder 
usually  involve  fear  of  an  impending  physical  or  mental  catastrophe 
[22],  whereas  ictal  events  generally  exhibit  milder  panic  intensity 
without reaching the peak of a panic attacks. Additionally, ictal fear is 
sometimes described as less reality based [20]. As for the duration of 
anxiety, ictal panic is a short event (0.5 to 2 min) [21], whereas panic 
attacks  last  considerably  longer  (up  to  30  min)  [18].  Panic  attacks 
typically develop during wakefulness, while ictal panic can occur in both 
awake and sleep states [23]. Ictal panic has also been associated with an 
increased risk of interictal panic disorder [20]. 

Moreover, anxiety disorders specific to epilepsy (Table 2B) should be 
considered, although they are not described in the current psychiatric 
classification systems [13,21]. Anticipatory anxiety of epileptic seizure 
[24]  and  seizure  phobia  are  related  entities  [21]  that  encompass  the 
anxiety of having a seizure and avoidance behavior of places or situa-
tions where seizure have already happened or where it potentially could 
occur.  Individuals  with  epileptic  social  phobia  experience  persistent 
anxiety associated with being observed by other people during seizures 
and being judged negatively as a result [21]. 

Furthermore,  it  is  essential  to  distinguish  peri-ictal  and  interictal 
anxiety  from  other  medical  conditions  like  cardiac  arrhythmias,

alcohol/drug withdrawal, or hyperthyroidism [20]. 

2.3. The effect of iatrogenic processes on psychopathology. 

Various anxiety-related symptoms may occur in relation to seizures, 
making  a  differential  diagnosis  necessary  to  avoid  misdiagnosis  and 
iatrogenic effects (for a review, see Mula [25]). The use of ASM with 
negative  psychotropic characteristics (e.g., levetiracetam, zonisamide, 
and topiramate) or the discontinuation of ASM with mood-stabilizing 
properties  (e.g.  carbamazepine,  gabapentin,  lamotrigine,  pregabalin 
and  valproic  acid)  might  induce  symptoms  of  fear.  In  addition,  some 
ASM  have  enzyme-inducing  properties  that  can  reduce  the  levels  of 
psychoactive drugs and thus elicit states of anxiety [26]. 

2.4. Psychometric assessment of anxiety symptoms 

There  are  several  screening  instruments  to  assess  anxiety-related 
symptoms  during  the  treatment  course  (for  a  review,  see  Rauh  et  al. 
[27]), some of which can be accessed free of charge online [28]. The 
Beck Anxiety Index (BAI) is a 21-item self-report scale measuring the 
severity of anxiety symptoms [29] and is commonly used to measure 
anxiety in PWE. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is 
also used in a clinical context [30]. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 
(GAD-7, available online [31]) is a 7-item self-rating scale to identify 
anxiety  disorders,  particularly  generalized  anxiety  disorder  [2]. 
Although it is a well-validated and widely used screening tool for anx-
iety disorders in PWE [32], it may not be able to specifically detect panic 
disorder [33]. For PWE, the Epilepsy Anxiety Survey Instrument (EASI, 
available online [34]) and the shorter screening instrument brief EASI 
(brEASI)  are  useful  to  assess  anxiety  [35].  The  brEASI  demonstrated 
high  sensitivity  and  specificity  to  detect  anxiety  disorders  like  panic 
disorder or agoraphobia. For a panic disorder oriented assessment, the 
Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) can be used as a screening tool [36]. 
This  brief  13-item  instrument  (clinician  and  self-rated  versions  avail-
able)  was  developed  to  evaluate  the  severity  of  illness  and  the  effec-
tiveness of psychopharmacological and psychotherapy treatments. It has 
been applied in double-blind placebo-controlled and other clinical trials 
[37,38].  The  American  Psychiatric  Association  (APA)  provides  the 
Severity Measure for Panic Disorder – Adult for free, which is an easy-to- 
use 10-item instrument to determine the severity of panic disorder [39]. 
In  general,  it  is  recommended  to  conduct  structured  clinical  in-
terviews, such as the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M. 
I.N.I.) [40], preferably with epilepsy-specific adaptations [41], to pro-
vide  a  valid  diagnostic  assessment  of  anxiety  disorders  [9],  while 
avoiding  underestimation  and  undertreatment  of  these  comorbid  dis-
orders [23]. 

1.  Week 1–2: Initiate treatment with a low dose, such as 25 mg once 
daily, usually given in the morning (to prevent overstimulation and 
insomnia).  

2.  Week 3–4: Increase the dose to 50 mg once daily.  
3.  Week 5 and onward: Since sertraline has a flat dose–response curve, 
approximately 75 % of patients respond to the initial dose of 50 mg 
once daily. Depending on individual response and tolerability, the 
dose may be further increased by 50 mg increments at intervals of at 
least one week. The target therapeutic dose for most conditions is in 
the range of 50–150 mg per day [43]. 

Second-line pharmacotherapy: As second-line option, we recom-
mend  the  serotonin-norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitor  (SNRI)  ven-
lafaxine  due  to  its  dual  mechanism  of  action,  potentially  offering  a 
broader  spectrum  of  action  for  individuals  with  symptoms  related  to 
both serotonin and norepinephrine. It is important to note that side ef-
fects,  particularly  blood  pressure  changes,  may  be  more  prevalent 
compared to sertraline. Nevertheless, venlafaxine is an FDA-approved 
medication for the treatment of panic disorder. 

A common titration schedule for venlafaxine might look like this:  

1.  Week 1: Initiate treatment with a low dose, such as 37.5 mg once 
daily, usually given in the morning (to prevent overstimulation and 
insomnia),  typically  taken  with  food.  The  immediate-release  form 
may be used initially.  

2.  Week  2–3:  Increase  the  dose  to  75  mg  once  daily.  The  extended- 
release (XR) formulation may be considered which allows for once- 
daily dosing.  

3.  Week  4  and  onward:  Since  venlafaxine  has  a  flat  dose–response 
curve, approximately 75 % of patients respond to the initial dose of 
75 mg once daily. Depending on individual response and tolerability, 
the dose may be further increased by 37.5 or 75 mg increments at 
intervals of at least one week. The target therapeutic dose for most 
conditions is in the range of 75–225 mg per day [43]. 

Nota bene: It can be helpful to inform patients about the possibility of 
experiencing activation symptoms, such as jitteriness, increased anxiety, 
or insomnia, during the initial stages of treatment. Such activation is not 
dangerous  and  may  indicate  that  the  diagnosis  of  panic  disorder  is 
correct, which can aid in patient adherence during early treatment. 

Combining  sertraline  or  venlafaxine  with  a  benzodiazepine  for  a 
brief period (usually a few weeks) may be considered in certain situa-
tions, such as when rapid symptom relief is necessary. Benzodiazepines 
are effective in rapidly reducing anxiety symptoms and panic attacks. 
However, they are generally recommended for short-term use due to the 
risk of dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms. Once symp-
toms are under control, the benzodiazepine is usually tapered and dis-
continued while maintaining sertraline or venlafaxine. 

3. Pharmacologic treatment considerations 

3.1. Effective versus failed trial 

The APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with panic 
disorder [42] provides recommendations for drug treatments in panic 
disorder.  The  APA  recommends  continuing  panic  disorder  pharmaco-
therapy for at least 12 months after symptom remission. Long-term or 
maintenance treatment with medication may be necessary for patients 
experiencing multiple relapses or chronic symptoms. 

First-line  pharmacotherapy:  Selective  serotonin  reuptake  in-
hibitors (SSRIs) such as sertraline have been shown to be effective in 
reducing the frequency and severity of panic attacks. We recommend 
sertraline as the initial drug for treating panic disorder in epilepsy. This 
recommendation is based on its proven effectiveness in treating panic 
disorder, its generally well-tolerated side effect profile, low pharmaco-
kinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions, and approval by the U. S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for panic disorder. 

A common titration schedule for sertraline might look like this:  

Given  the  lack  of  standardized  criteria  for  treatment  resistance  in 
panic disorder, treatment resistance commonly refers to an inadequate 
response  to  what  is  typically  considered  sufficient  treatment  [44]. 
Symptoms  should  show  some  reduction  in  intensity  and  frequency 
within  the  first  3–4  weeks  of  treatment  at  an  adequate  dose.  After  a 
minimum of 6 weeks of treatment with an adequate dose, a failure to 
achieve a 50 % reduction on a standard rating scale (such as the PAS) 
can be considered as nonresponse to drug treatment [45]. For patients 
with panic disorder who still have symptoms after the initial treatment, 
a  re-evaluation  of  the  diagnosis,  treatment  intensity,  adherence,  and 
comorbidities  is  necessary.  Substance/alcohol  abuse  or  underlying 
personality disorders should also be considered. 

Epilepsy&BehaviorReports25(2024)1006463T.M. Redecker et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

3.2. Most common adverse events of the psychotropic medications 

Patients  should  be  informed  that  the  effects  of  antidepressants 
typically begin with a latency of about 2 weeks (range 1–6 weeks). The 
potential  side  effects,  especially  serious  or  common  ones,  should  be 
discussed. In particular, the following should be mentioned:  

▪  For treatment with sertraline or venlafaxine: Restlessness and 
insomnia  in  the  first  days  of  treatment;  sexual  dysfunctions; 
discontinuation symptoms.  

▪  For  treatment  with  benzodiazepines  (if  used  in  justified 
exceptional  cases):  Development  of  dependence,  tolerance, 
prolonged reaction time, and the risk of falls. 

Nota  bene:  Before  initiating  antidepressant  treatment,  a  discussion 
with adult patients is essential to consider the potential risk of suicidal 
behavior, especially when dealing with panic disorder and other anxiety 
disorders [46]. Asking about suicidal thoughts requires sensitivity and 
empathy.  It  is  essential  to  approach  the  subject  with  genuine  care, 
ensuring a safe and non-judgmental environment for the person’s well- 
being. Here is on example of how one might delicately broach the topic: 
“I’ve noticed that you’ve been going through a tough time lately. Sometimes, 
when people feel this way, they may have thoughts of self-harm. Have you 
been thinking of suicide or do you ever feel like you’re at a point where you 
don’t want to go on?” If someone discloses suicidal thoughts, it is critical 
to take their disclosure seriously and facilitate connections with mental 
health professionals or crisis resources. For neurologists seeking addi-
tional  resources  on  how  to  approach  or  discuss  the  topic  of  suicidal 
behavior,  the  American  Psychiatric  Association  (APA)  and  the  World 
Health Organization (WHO) offer valuable guidelines and resources. 

3.3. Safety for use in people with epilepsy 

The  use  of  antidepressants  in  PWE  has  raised  concerns  due  to  re-
ported seizures during treatment with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) 
[47]. However, evidence suggests that SSRIs/SNRIs pose a low risk of 
seizures and can generally be recommended for PWE, with moderate to 
low evidence indicating neither an increase nor exacerbation of seizures 
in  the  latest  Cochrane  meta-analysis  on  antidepressants  for  PWE  and 
depression [48]. In some cases, SSRIs and SNRIs have even shown po-
tential to decrease seizure frequency in patients with frequent seizures 
[49]. Moreover, these medications have demonstrated promising ther-
apeutic outcomes for the treatment of a depressive and/or anxiety dis-
orders regardless of the frequency of seizures. Therefore, treatment of 
panic disorder with an SSRI or SNRI poses a low risk of seizures and can 
be safely prescribed for PWE. 

3.4. Iatrogenic and therapeutic phenomena of pharmacokinetic 
interactions with antiseizure medication 

Considering  pharmacokinetic  interactions  is  crucial  when  treating 
epilepsy and psychiatric disorders. Knowing the major metabolic path-
ways  enables  to  predict  pharmacokinetic  interactions.  Sertraline  and 
venlafaxine have a low to moderate potential for drug-drug interactions. 
See Table 3 for examples of pharmacokinetic interactions between ASMs 
and psychiatric drugs.

for  VPA  and  levetiracetam  there  are  small-scale  open  studies  which 
showed some benefit [55,56]. 

On the other hand, it has to be asked whether ASM lead to panic 
attacks. There are single case reports on the development of panic at-
tacks  under  topiramate  [57].  Generally,  around  8  %  of  PWE  develop 
psychiatric  problems  while  receiving  ASM,  which  seems  to  be  more 
related to a history of psychiatric disorders than to a specific ASM [58]. 
Thus, no specific ASM has to be avoided, but treatment changes have to 
monitored carefully. 

3.6. The benefits of a psychotherapeutic modality for the clinical scenario 

It is important to note that medication alone should not be consid-
ered the sole treatment for panic disorder independent of the presence of 
epilepsy.  Psychotherapy,  particularly  cognitive-behavioral  therapy 
(CBT), is a proven and effective treatment for panic disorder [42]. CBT 
helps individuals identify and modify thought patterns and behaviors 
that contribute to panic attacks, providing coping strategies and tech-
niques to manage anxiety. CBT, in particular, is recommended by the 
Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  for  treatment  of  interictal  anxiety  [42]. 
According  to  Mula  [25],  CBT  plus  SSRIs  is  recommended  for  acute 
treatment of panic attacks in PWE, while CBT with or without SSRIs is 
suitable for long-term treatment. In general, psychological strategies can 
be useful to support coping in PWE [59,60]. 

3.5. Antiseizure medication as a treatment option for panic disorder 

3.7. Indication for psychiatric treatment 

While many ASM have been tested for the treatment of anxiety dis-
orders, it is difficult to find studies dedicated to their use in panic dis-
order. A placebo-controlled trial of gabapentin for the treatment of panic 
disorder  failed  to  demonstrate  a  significant  improvement  compared 
with placebo, although post hoc analyses of severely ill patients showed 
an improvement [53]. For lamotrigine, there is only a case series of four 
patients with panic disorder in which it showed some efficacy [54], and 

No definitive rule can be given in this regard: It certainly depends on 
the experience and certification of the treating epileptologist. In some 
countries, psychiatrists care for PWE. When the panic disorder diagnosis 
has been established in a PWE, the patient should be referred to a psy-
chologist/psychotherapist. Anxiolytic drug therapy may be initiated by 
the epileptologist. The patient should be referred to a psychiatrist in case 
of failure of the first medication.

4. Summary and recommendations 

This  case  report  highlights  the  importance  of  recognizing  and 
effectively managing anxiety disorders in PWE. Distinguishing between 
peri-ictal fear and panic attacks is crucial for an accurate diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment. Various anxiety-related symptoms may occur in 
relation to seizures, making a differential diagnosis necessary to avoid 
misdiagnosis  and  iatrogenic  effects.  Misdiagnosis  and  inappropriate 
treatment approaches can lead to worsened symptoms and diminished 
quality of life. Accurate assessment using reliable psychometric tools can 
help identify anxiety-related symptoms and guide clinicians in providing 
appropriate care for PWE and comorbid anxiety disorders. 

The use of sertraline/venlafaxine in PWE poses a low risk of seizures 
and can generally be recommended. However, TCAs may have a higher 
risk of seizures and should be used with caution. Benzodiazepines should 
be used cautiously, and treatment resistance should prompt a thorough 
re-evaluation. Psychotherapy, particularly CBT, can further enhance the 
treatment  outcome.  Overall,  personalized  treatment  plans  should  be 
devised, considering the individual patient’s response, side effect pro-
file, and comorbid conditions.
