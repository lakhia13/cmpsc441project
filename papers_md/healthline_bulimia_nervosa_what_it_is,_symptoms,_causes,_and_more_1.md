The criteria used to diagnose bulimia include:

- recurrent binge eating

- regular purging through vomiting, excessive exercise, misuse of laxatives, or fasting

- deriving self-worth from weight and body shape

- binge eating and purging that happens, on average, at leastonce a week for 3 months

- not having anorexia nervosa

TheDSM-5also categorizes bulimia from mild to extreme:

- Mild:1 to 3 episodes per week

- Moderate:4 to 7 episodes per week

- Severe:8 to 13 episodes per week

- Extreme:14 or more episodes per week

You may need further tests if you’ve had bulimia for a long period of time. These tests can check for complications that could include problems with your heart or other organs.

Treatment options can include:

- Antidepressants.Currently,fluoxetine(Prozac) is the only antidepressant approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat bulimia. This selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor may also help with depression and anxiety. Fluoxetine isonly approvedfor treating bulimia in adults.
