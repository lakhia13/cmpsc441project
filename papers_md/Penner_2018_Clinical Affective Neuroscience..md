Clinical Affective Neuroscience

Affective neuroscience is a promising young field in neuroscience for understanding the 
basis of many types of psychopathology. It describes the scientific investigation of the neural 
basis of affect, emotion, and feelings. These phenomena arise from mental processes that are 
not always directly observable, which complicates discovering their neural basis. Still, as it 
has done for other inferred processes, such as memory and language, neuroscience should 
transform our emotion-based patient formulations and lead to novel, targeted therapeutics 
for emotional issues. In this Translations, we aim to provide a brief introduction to affective 
neuroscience for clinicians, beginning with defining key terms and then reviewing clinical 
applications.

First, it is noteworthy that common clinical terms have different meanings in affective 
neuroscience. In the influential Affective Neuroscience, Panksepp defined affect as a 
primitive mental process based in subcortical structures, found across species that places an 
organism in a particular behavioral state.1 Of course, affects have evolved for a purpose, and 
the affective systems proposed by Panksepp (Table 1) are hallmark examples. A general 
neuroscientific definition of emotion is a conscious experience that has at least two 
components – stimulus and response. An emotion incorporates the cognitive interpretation 
or experience of the stimulus, overt behavioral response, physiologic response, and feeling, 
which may be considered the subjective synthesis of internal sensations. Emotions are also 
typically considered to have a valence component, the degree to which they are experienced 
as pleasurable (positive valence) or aversive (negative valence). Emotions are relatively brief 
in their duration as opposed to other internal states, though their associated physiologic 
arousal may last for hours.

Basic emotion is a term for a core, discrete emotional experience that is shared among all 
people.2 However, exactly which basic emotions exist and how universal they may be 
continues to be debated. When considering the literature on emotions, it is important not to 
confuse basic emotions with affective systems. Affects are basic, evolutionarily conserved 
processes which may not be consciously experienced. Emotions are conscious experiences 
which may involve multiple affective systems, physiological arousal, and cognitive 
processes.

Clinical Applications of Affective Neuroscience

Motivation

Some major, contemporary theories of emotion consider brain-based motivational processes 
to be a core organizing dimension. One influential example of how a motivational system 
has been formulated in affective neuroscience is the “seeking system” in Table 1. 
Motivational processes are normal and always active in the brain, underlying behavior 
intended to approach or avoid. They are supported by the mesolimbic dopamine systems. 
These systems are defined by dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area to 
the nucleus accumbens and areas of the neocortex, notably the ventral and medial prefrontal 
cortex.

Motivation-related dysfunction has influenced psychiatric practice, appearing in early 
formulations of psychiatric illness, e.g. Freud’s pleasure principle. It is implicated in several 
psychiatric conditions as a core affective component. Perhaps most familiar to clinicians is 
its central role in substance use disorders. For interested readers, the National Neuroscience 
Curriculum Initiative (NNCI; www.nncionline.org) has produced a web-based module 
“Addiction” describing the motivational circuitry in substance use disorders.3 The module is 
intended to aid clinicians in understanding and communicating the neural pathophysiology 
of substance use disorders and provides an accessible overview of the motivational system.

Motivation system disturbances have been established in obsessive compulsive, eating, 
disruptive behavioral, psychotic, and mood disorders. An affective neuroscience approach 
may refine prognosis and treatment for such disorders. Consider the example of eating 
disorders, a fitting one, since food is a fundamental stimulus for motivation. When 
something important such as food is detected, an individual may have an approach response 
with a corresponding dopamine change in the mesolimbic system. The association between 
dopamine change and approach response is so reliable that there are well-established 
mathematical models that predict it. Recent work applied such models to understanding the 
motivation system dysfunction in anorexia, finding the response is dysfunctional. Rather 
than having a simple lack of dopamine response to food, the motivational system 
demonstrates extreme fluctuations. The discovery of these fluctuations, even after recovery, 
may help explain the relapsing course and suggest novel treatments. For example, an 
intriguing new hypothesis suggests that dopamine partial agonists may treat core symptoms 
of anorexia nervosa by attenuating these fluctuations, effectively stabilizing the motivational 
neural circuit.4

Fear and Anxiety

Neural systems underlying threat detection, response, and experience are critical for 
understanding anxiety disorders as well as other threat related disorders such as disruptive 
behavioral and posttraumatic stress disorders. A few definitions are helpful prior to 
describing how affective neuroscience has improved our understanding of these conditions. 
A threat is anything that has the potential to harm. Fear is typically defined as a type of 
response to a stimulus that is threatening or associated with threat. Anxiety is a more 
generalized state in response to an ambiguous threat.

Early models of fear proposed that it originated in an “innate fear circuit” with the amygdala 
playing a central role as a sort of threat detector. While the amygdala is critical, 
contemporary theories in affective neuroscience extend this understanding to broader neural 
systems. LeDoux and Pine recently described a two-system model that disentangles the 
behavioral and physiologic response to threat from the subjective experience of fear.5 The 
threat response system processes information through the amygdala to the nucleus 
accumbens that controls defensive actions such as freezing, escape, and defensive 
aggression. The second system in this model describes the experience of fear, relying on 
neurocircuitry that engages conscious awareness, specifically the frontoparietal network. 
This account describes the generation of a conscious experience of fear as separable from 
more basic, defensive, physiologic reactions.

Neuroscience has informed the distinction between fear and anxiety. Recent, influential 
work by Davis and others has discovered unique associations between aspects of fear and 
anxiety and specific areas of the amygdala or its extensions, particularly the bed nucleus of 
the stria terminalis (BNST).6,7 The discovery of these more anxiety-related areas has led to 
promising developments in the study of anxiety disorders in children. For example, changes 
in the BNST are clearly seen in children with anxiety-related temperaments who develop 
anxiety disorders.8

An increasing understanding of how fear, threat, and anxiety circuitry adapt will clearly 
impact on learning-based treatments. For example, the neural basis of reducing threat 
response through extinction has inspired modifications to exposure therapy. When providing 
exposures of a threat stimulus, neuroscience suggests a therapist might focus on maximizing 
the discrepancy between the expectation of harm and the experience of safety.9

Resources are available that translate affective neuroscience in more depth. An accessible 
overview of basic concepts in affective neuroscience is the “Emotion” chapter of Gazzaniga, 
Ivry and Mangun’s Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind.10 For those wishing 
to take a deeper dive in the fundamentals of affective neuroscience, Roll’s Emotion and 
Decision-Making Explained11 introduces theoretical issues and investigational techniques. 
Gross’s Handbook of Emotion Regulation,12 deals with control processes of emotional and 
affective systems. These works remain grounded in neuroscience and all discuss some 
translations to clinical work where possible. Concise, clinical translations that are less 
technical or cover specific types of mental illness are emerging. Some NNCI topics and 
reviews in psychiatry journals increasingly touch on affective neuroscience. The National 
Institute of Mental Health updates a set of translations in its Research Domain Criteria 
matrix. There are some authoritative translational books such as Anxious: Using the Brain to 
Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety by LeDoux.13
