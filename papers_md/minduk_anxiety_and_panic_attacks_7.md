## What is anxiety?


Anxiety is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid – particularly about things that are about to happen, or which we think could happen in the future.

Anxiety is a natural human response when we feel that we are under threat. It can be experienced through our thoughts, feelings and physical sensations.

For me, anxiety feels as if everyone in the world is waiting for me to trip up, so that they can laugh at me. It makes me feel nervous and unsure whether the next step I take is the best way forward.

Most people feel anxious at times. It's particularly common to experience some anxiety while coping with stressful events or changes, especially if they could have a big impact on your life. See our pages onhow to manage stressfor more information about stress.

If you are feeling anxious or experiencing a panic attack right now,see our page onhow to manage panic attacks.


### What is the 'fight, flight or freeze' response?


Like all animals, human beings have evolved ways to help us protect ourselves from danger. When we feel under threat our bodies react by releasing certain hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, which can be helpful. These hormones:

- make us feel more alert, so we can act faster

- make our hearts beat faster, quickly sending blood to where it's needed most.

After we feel the threat has passed, our bodies release other hormones to help our muscles relax. This can sometimes cause us to shake.

This is commonly called the 'fight, flight or freeze' response – it's something that happens automatically in our bodies, and we have no control over it.

Going out of the house is a challenge because I have a fear of panicking and feel that I'm being watched or judged. It's just horrible. I want to get help but I'm afraid of being judged.


### When is anxiety a mental health problem?


Anxiety can become a mental health problem if it impacts your ability to live your life as fully as you want to. For example, it may be a problem if:

- your feelings of anxiety are very strong or last for a long time

- your fears or worries are out of proportion to the situation

- you avoid situations that might cause you to feel anxious

- your worries feel very distressing or are hard to control

- you regularly experiencesymptoms of anxiety, which could includepanic attacks

- you find it hard to go about your everyday life or do things you enjoy.

If your symptoms fit a particular set of medical criteria then you might be diagnosed with a particularanxiety disorder. But it's also possible to experience problems with anxiety without having a specific diagnosis. Our pages onself-careandtreatmentfor anxiety offer suggestions for help and support.

You know that feeling when you're rocking on the back legs of your chair and suddenly for a split second you think you're about to fall; that feeling in your chest? Imagine that split second feeling being frozen in time and lodged in your chest for hours/days, and imagine with it that sense of dread sticking around too, but sometimes you don't even know why.
