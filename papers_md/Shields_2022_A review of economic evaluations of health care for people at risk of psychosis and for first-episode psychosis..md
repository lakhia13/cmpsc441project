Abstract 
Background:  Preventing psychotic disorders and effective treatment in first-episode psychosis are key priorities for 
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. This review assessed the evidence base for the cost-effectiveness 
of health and social care interventions for people at risk of psychosis and for first-episode psychosis.

Methods:  Electronic searches were conducted using the PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Embase databases to identify 
relevant published full economic evaluations published before August 2020. Full-text English-language studies 
reporting a full economic evaluation of a health or social care intervention aiming to reduce or prevent symptoms in 
people at risk of psychosis or experiencing first-episode psychosis were included. Screening, data extraction, and criti-
cal appraisal were performed using pre-specified criteria and forms based on the NHS Economic Evaluation Database 
(EED) handbook and Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist for economic 
evaluations. The protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42018108226). Results were summarised 
qualitatively.

Results:  Searching identified 1,628 citations (1,326 following the removal of duplications). After two stages of screen-
ing 14 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Interventions were varied and included 
multidisciplinary care, antipsychotic medication, psychological therapy, and assertive outreach. Evidence was limited 
in the at-risk group with only four identified studies, though all interventions were found to be cost-effective with a 
high probability (> 80%). A more substantial evidence base was identified for first-episode psychosis (11 studies), with 
a focus on early intervention (7/11 studies) which again had positive conclusions though with greater uncertainty.

Conclusions:  Study findings generally concluded interventions were cost-effective. The evidence for the population 
who are at-risk of psychosis was limited, and though there were more studies for the population with first-episode 
psychosis, limitations of the evidence base (including generalisability and heterogeneity across the methods used) 
affect the certainty of conclusions.

Keywords:  Psychosis, Cost-effectiveness, Cost-utility, Economic evaluation, Systematic review

Background
Psychotic  disorders  are  severe  mental  illnesses  in  which 
an individual’s behaviour, mood, perception and thoughts 
are  altered  [1].  An  analysis  of  prevalence  estimates  for 
psychotic  disorders  estimated  that  the  global  lifetime 
prevalence  is  7.49  per  1000  [2].  Symptoms  are  typically

divided into positive symptoms (including hallucinations 
and  delusions)  and  negative  symptoms  (such  as  with-
drawal, depression and apathy).

costs)  and  early  detection/intervention  services  for  psy-
chosis could reduce the need for services later on which 
again may be associated with a cost saving [22].

Individuals  who  are  in  an  “At-Risk  Mental  State” 
(ARMS)  are  at  high  risk  of  psychosis,  but  the  develop-
ment of psychotic disorder is not inevitable, making this 
period  important  for  prevention  [3].  Only  a  minority 
of  people  in  an  ARMS  will  develop  psychosis;  evidence 
suggests  approximately  15–22%  of  people  develop  psy-
chosis within a year from ARMS assessment [4, 5]. Peo-
ple  who  are  experiencing  first-episode  psychosis  have 
variable  outcomes;  some  patients  may  experience  a  full 
recovery, others may require life-long treatment [6]. Pre-
venting and effectively treating psychosis is important to 
improve the health of the population. People experienc-
ing first-episode psychosis (FEP) have a higher mortality 
rate  compared  to  the  general  population  [7].  Over  their 
lifetime people with psychotic disorders die around 10 to 
15  years  earlier  when  compared  with  the  general  popu-
lation  [7].  There  is  also  a  substantial  morbidity  burden. 
People with psychosis experience co-morbid physical and 
mental  health  problems,  cognitive  impairment,  social 
exclusion  (stigma  and  discrimination),  side  effects  from 
treatment and reduced opportunities related to work and 
education  [8–14].  The  caregiver  burden  is  also  substan-
tial,  with  carers  reporting  social  isolation,  psychological 
distress and reduced quality of life [15].

In  the  UK,  guidelines  from  the  National  Institute  for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that spe-
cialised  services  are  available  to  everyone  who  is  expe-
riencing  a  FEP  [1].  There  is  also  now  a  focus  on  early 
detection  of  individuals  at  risk  of  developing  FEP,  with 
criteria available to help identify people in an ARMS [16–
18]. NHS England has targets that include timely assess-
ments  and  access  to  care  for  individuals  with  an  ARMS 
and FEP. Both NICE and NHS England recommend that 
these services should be specialised Early Intervention in 
Psychosis  (EIP)  services,  that  is,  community-based  mul-
tidisciplinary  teams  that  (1)  seek  to  reduce  the  amount 
of time between the onset of symptoms and the start of 
treatment (the ‘duration of untreated psychosis’) and (2) 
provide  comprehensive  treatment  that  aims  to  promote 
recovery  and  minimise  disability  [19].  The  duration  of 
untreated psychosis has been correlated with poorer out-
comes, highlighting the need for treatments to effectively 
identify and treat FEP in order to improve health in this 
population [20].

Meta-analysis  demonstrates  that  early  intervention 
services  are  effective  using  a  range  of  outcomes  (e.g., 
symptom  severity,  hospitalisation,  school  and  work 
involvement)  [21].  Furthermore,  work  from  The  King’s 
Fund  highlighted  that  early  intervention  services  may 
help to realise cost savings (largely attributed to inpatient 

With  rising  healthcare  costs,  constrained  budgets  and 
a  growth  in  the  number  and  type  of  interventions,  eco-
nomic  evaluations  are  needed  to  assess  costs  and  out-
comes  associated  with  different  options  and  support 
decision making with information on the value of inter-
ventions.  Subsequently,  the  aim  of  this  review  was  to 
examine  and  synthesise  full  economic  evaluations  of 
interventions for people at risk of psychosis and for FEP. 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  whether  existing 
interventions  are  cost-effective.  The  secondary  objec-
tive  was  to  review  the  robustness  of  the  evidence  base 
through critical appraisal.

Methods
The  systematic  review  protocol  was  published  on  the 
online  PROSPERO  international  register  of  systematic 
reviews  (CRD42018108226)  [23].  The  research  aimed 
to  answer  the  following  questions.  What  are  the  costs, 
health  benefits  and  incremental  cost  effectiveness  esti-
mates  of  included  studies  of  interventions  for  people  at 
risk of psychosis and for FEP? How robust are the study 
designs,  data  and  analysis  methods  of  the  included 
studies?

Searches

Electronic  searches  were  conducted  in  June  2019  and 
updated in August 2020 using the PsycINFO, MEDLINE 
and  Embase  databases  via  Ovid.  Search  terms  included 
terms specific to economic evaluation and the population 
of interest (ARMS and FEP). Economic evaluation search 
terms  were  taken  from  the  NHS  Economic  Evaluation 
Database  (EED)  published  strategies  [24].  Search  terms 
for  the  population  included  psychosis,  first-episode  and 
at-risk. Free-text and standardised (MESH) subject terms 
were used. Search terms varied according to the database 
design. A pilot test of strategies was undertaken to check 
that all citations already known to the authors were iden-
tified. The full search strategies are provided in the sup-
plementary material.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Pre-specified  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  used 
to  assess  the  relevance  of  identified  articles.  Inclusion 
criteria were (1) studies reporting a full economic evalu-
ation (synthesising costs and health benefits), (2) studies 
focused  on  people  at-risk  of  psychosis  or  experiencing 
FEP  (with  no  restriction  by  study  age/publication  date), 
(3)  studies  focusing  on  any  type  of  health  or  social  care 
intervention aimed at preventing or reducing symptoms, 
(4)  the  comparator  included  could  be  no  intervention

(usual  care)  or  an  active  intervention.  Publications 
needed to be original full-text articles published in Eng-
lish  reporting  results  (i.e.,  systematic  reviews,  confer-
ence abstracts and protocols were excluded). Studies not 
meeting  these  criteria  were  excluded  during  the  screen-
ing process.

Screening

Two  stages  of  independent  screening  were  performed: 
firstly,  of  titles  and  abstracts  and  secondly  of  the  full 
papers.  Two  reviewers  completed  screening  of  all  cita-
tions, with a third reviewer to resolve disagreements.

Data extraction and quality appraisal

Data  extraction  and  critical  appraisal  were  performed 
using pre-specified criteria and forms based on the NHS 
EED  handbook  and  Consolidated  Health  Economic 
Evaluation  Reporting  Standards  (CHEERS)  checklist  for 
economic evaluations [25, 26]. The data extraction form 
is  included  in  the  supplementary  material.  Extracted 
data included information on study design, methodology, 

results,  limitations,  and  risk  of  bias.  One  reviewer  com-
pleted  data  extraction  with  20%  of  data  extraction 
checked by a second reviewer.

Synthesis

Review  findings  are  presented  via  narrative  synthesis.  It 
is  typical  for  economic  evaluations  to  be  highly  hetero-
geneous  and  therefore  any  quantitative  synthesis  (e.g., 
meta-analysis)  that  could  be  attempted  would  likely  be 
uncertain  and  precarious  [27].  Key  aspects  of  the  study 
design and results of included papers are summarised in 
tables.

Results
Database  searches  identified  1,628  individual  citations, 
following  screening  14  met  the  inclusion  criteria  and 
were included in this review (Fig. 1).

Key characteristics of included studies are reported in 

Table 1.

Study designs and critical appraisal
Population and sample

The  populations  considered  by  studies  are  reported  in 
Table  1  One  challenge  that  affects  the  populations  con-
sidered  in  this  review  is  the  use  of  different  definitions. 
First-episode  definitions  may  be  focused  on  number  of 
service  contacts,  duration  of  psychosis  or  duration  of 
antipsychotic use [42]. Duration of illness has been linked 
to  symptoms  evolving  over  time  and  the  likely  effect  of 
treatment,  meaning  the  use  of  varying  definitions  and 
eligibility  criteria  across  studies  will  affect  the  results  of 
economic evaluations [20, 43, 44].

The  level  of  detail  presented  about  the  study  samples 
differed;  though  the  majority  of  trial  papers  reported 
the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  well  [28,  34,  37–
39].  Many  of  the  studies  had  separately  published 
papers,  additional  information  around  aspects  of  the 
study  design  (including  the  precise  population)  may  be 
reported elsewhere. Common exclusion criteria included 
drug  dependency  or  substance-induced  psychotic  dis-
order,  and  non-English  language  speakers  [34,  37–39]. 
Some studies excluded people with comorbid health con-
ditions  (e.g.  bipolar  disorder,  autism  spectrum  disorder 
and epilepsy) which may limit generalisability to broader 
populations  [38,  39].  Typically,  study  participants  (when 
reported)  were  young,  with  the  mean  age < 30,  and  the 
majority  were  male.  Two  studies  discussed  statistically 
significant differences between groups at baseline, which 
may  bias  results  if  they  are  associated  with  the  cost  or 
health  benefit  measure  and  not  accounted  for  [32,  39]. 
Behan et al., compared two incidence-based cohorts and 
discussed that the early intervention cohort consisted of 
two urban and one predominantly rural catchment area, 
with  the  treatment  as  usual  cohort  from  two  predomi-
nantly rural catchment areas [32]. The authors noted this 
as a limitation of the study, but it is not clear how it may 
have affected results.

Intervention and comparator

In at-risk populations the majority of studies focused on 
cognitive  behavioural  therapy  (CBT)  in  comparison  to 
usual  care  for  populations  at  high-risk  of  psychosis  [28, 
29, 31]. Jin et al., developed a whole-disease model which 
included a wide range of interventions and comparators 
(including  CBT,  antipsychotics,  care  settings  and  fam-
ily  interventions)  [29].  Perez  et  al.,  focused  on  liaison 
approaches  between  primary  and  secondary  care  early 
intervention  services  for  the  improved  detection  and 
referral  of  young  people  at  high-risk  of  developing  psy-
chosis  [30].  Two  interventions  were  compared  to  prac-
tice as usual; a low intensity intervention consisting of a 
postal campaign and a high intensity intervention which 

included a specialist mental health professional and edu-
cation package.

In  the  population  with  FEP,  the  intervention  of  focus 
was  most  commonly  early  intervention,  the  exact  com-
ponents of which varied (described in Table 1). CBT was 
included in four studies, but commonly as part of a pack-
age of care [32, 34, 36, 37]. Two studies considered phar-
macological  options;  one  looking  at  antipsychotics  for 
differing durations of time and another looking at a range 
of  antipsychotics,  and  antipsychotics  in  combination 
with family intervention [40, 29]. A single study focused 
on psychoeducation [33].

Across all populations, the comparator was frequently 
usual care (often described as standard care or treatment 
as  usual).  However,  standard  care  was  highly  variable, 
both  in  terms  of  how  well  it  was  reported  and  in  terms 
of  design  when  reported.  This  is  likely  to  limit  external 
validity;  variability  in  service  design  and  provision  was 
noted  to  impact  generalisability  in  most  studies  [28,  30, 
32–35, 37, 39, 40]. A minority of studies explicitly justi-
fied their choice of comparator [28, 30, 36, 37].

Economic evaluation analysis type and health benefit 
measure

As  shown  in  Table  2,  cost-effectiveness  analysis  (11/14) 
was  most  common.  Seven  studies  included  a  cost-util-
ity  analysis.  Cost-utility  analyses  most  frequently  used 
the  EQ-5D  derived  utility  values  to  calculate  Quality-
Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Cost-effectiveness analyses 
used an abundance of different measures of health bene-
fit, including symptom scores, outcomes (such as relapse) 
and  averted  cases  of  psychosis.  Typically,  the  impact  of 
side  effects  was  not  assessed  explicitly;  with  the  excep-
tion  of  three  studies  [29,  36,  39].  Studies  conducting  a 
trial analysis and collecting a health status measure may 
have implicitly captured the impact of side effects.

Perspective and chosen costs

Studies most commonly took a health sector perspective 
(Table 2). Intervention and inpatient costs were included 
by  all  studies.  Healthcare  visits  were  included  across 
studies  although  they  varied  by  type  and  description, 
which  in  part  is  likely  to  be  due  to  variations  in  health 
care  delivery  across  settings.  For  example,  some  studies 
specified  care  settings  (e.g.,  outpatient  visits)  whereas 
others categorised by practitioner type (e.g., psychiatrist). 
It  should  be  noted  that  some  studies  included  resource 
use related to mental health only [28, 29, 31, 38, 41] and 
in  others  it  was  unclear.  This  is  restrictive  as  individu-
als  with  FEP  and  those  at-risk  of  psychosis  experience 
poorer  physical  health  which  may  affect  healthcare  ser-
vice use [45–47]. Other costs considered included medi-
cation [28, 29, 32, 35–41], residential care [34, 36–38] and

supported  housing  [35,  40].  Informal  care  was  included 
by  two  studies  when  a  societal  perspective  was  taken 
[32, 40]. Two studies included patient out of pocket costs 
[28, 40] and drug and alcohol services [37, 40]. McCrone 
et  al.,  included  costs  related  to  criminal  justice,  which 
were collected by another study but excluded as few par-
ticipants  reported  these  [30,  37].  Though  adverse  event 
costs  were  not  often  discussed  in  the  studies,  they  may 
be  implicitly  captured  in  service  use  collection  for  trials 
and may not be relevant to all interventions. Of the stud-
ies incorporating productivity losses, there were different 
methods  used;  including  the  friction  cost  approach  and 
human  capital  method  [28,  32,  36,  40].  Perez  et  al.,  col-
lected  data  on  productivity  but  decided  to  exclude  it  as 
few participants were employed and of these, there were 
very few reported days missed from work [30].

Five  studies  collected  data  using  self-report  question-
naires  which,  although  susceptible  to  recall  bias,  offer 
some  advantages  (such  as  the  ability  to  get  data  that  is 
not routinely collected) and have generally been shown to 
be a valid method of collecting health resource data [28, 

32,  37,  39,  40,  48].  Wijnen  et  al.,  utilised  evidence  from 
the study by Ising et al., which was self-report [31]. Two 
studies used routine data sources but supplemented this 
with  self-report  data  to  gather  information  on  a  greater 
range of services [32, 35]. Three studies used only routine 
data  [34,  38,  41]  and  three  studies  used  secondary  data 
sources [29, 30, 36].

Study time horizons ranged from one year to lifetime, 

in part due to the study design (model or cohort study).

Risk of bias

Five  studies  used  decision  analytic  modelling;  using  dif-
ferent  model  types  and  structures  [29–31,  33,  36].  Bre-
itborde  et  al.,  described  a  simulation  model  tracking 
patients  through  FEP,  whether  they  presented  at  men-
tal  health  services  and  their  willingness  to  participate 
[33].  A  state-transition  Markov  model  was  developed 
by  Health  Quality  Ontario  with  patients  initiating  in  an 
acute  phase  of  FEP  and  subsequent  states  included  sta-
ble (with and without complications), relapse, treatment-
resistant,  unstable  and  death  [36].  Finally,  Perez  et  al.,

who  considered  an  at-risk  population  used  a  decision 
tree  model  based  primarily  on  RCT  data  which  focused 
on  referral  and  the  likelihood  of  true  or  false  positives 
[30]. Wijnen et al., report the design of a model to exam-
ine  cost-effectiveness  and  budget  impact  of  interven-
tions for the prevention of psychosis and for FEP, which 
is  intended  to  be  adaptable  to  various  therapies  but 
reported initial results using the Ising et al., trial [31]. The 
model (called PsyMod), a state-transition Markov model, 
splits health states into stages: symptoms, subclinical and 
clinical disorder and recovery or disability or death.

All  the  modelling  studies  reported  assumptions  well 
and  transparently,  but  authors  did  not  always  discuss 
how  model  designs  were  developed  or  validated.  The 
two  most  recently  identified  models  reported  devel-
opment  and  validation  in  detail  [29,  31].  Wijnen  et  al., 
developed  their  model  taking  into  account  clinical  and 
health  economic  expert  opinion,  and  then  applied  it  to 
an example using the results from Ising et al., which the 
authors  describe  as  model  testing  [31].  Jin  et  al.,  devel-
oped  a  whole-disease  discrete  event  simulation  model 
(simulating  the  disease  and  treatment  pathways),  which 
can be used to address varying decision problems across 
the  whole  disease  pathway  [29].  The  authors  were  care-
ful to build on the evidence base by addressing common 
issues  in  schizophrenia  modelling  studies  identified  in  a 
review,  they  involved  multidisciplinary  stakeholders  in 
the development and validation of the model and finally 
they  clearly  report  model  validation  and  verification 
processes.

Five  of  studies  were  economic  evaluations  integrated 
into  RCT  designs  [28,  35,  37,  39,  40].  A  single  study 
reported  being  single-blind  [35].  The  remaining  studies 
either  did  not  report  blinding  or  were  unblinded.  Given 
that the majority focused on complex interventions, dou-
ble blinding may not have been feasible. No studies were 
powered for economic measures. One study justified their 
primary analysis outcome measure (transition to psycho-
sis) as this was powered, whereas the QALYs considered 
in sensitivity analysis were not [28]. Analyses were inten-
tion-to-treat, with three studies reporting imputing miss-
ing data using varied methodology [28, 39, 40].

Four studies were non-randomised and used retrospec-
tive  data,  making  them  more  susceptible  to  bias  [32,  34, 
38,  41].  Cocchi  et  al.,  conducted  a  retrospective  analysis 
of  data  for  both  the  intervention  and  control  [34].  Mih-
alopoulos et al., and Wong et al., used historical controls, 
matching on factors such as age, sex and diagnosis [38, 41]. 
Behan et al., noted that the use of historical controls limits 
the relevance of studies to current practice, using two con-
temporaneous incidence-based cohorts [32].

There were some studies with very small samples (two 
studies had fewer than 100 participants) which affects the 
validity of the results [34, 38].

A summary of the CHEERS checklist for the reporting 
of economic evaluations is included in the supplementary 
material; only one study reported sufficient detail across 
the full criteria [26].

Overview of study results

Table 3 provides an overview of study results with a focus 
on  the  primary  results  reported  (note  these  reflect  dif-
ferent  study  time  horizons  and  further  breakdowns  of 
results  are  reported  within  papers).  Furthermore,  stud-
ies  often  report  multiple  results  (e.g.,  taking  different 
perspectives,  sensitivity  analysis),  consequently  anyone 
using this evidence base for decision making should con-
sult the full-text articles.

The  sections  below  summarise 

the  results  by 

population.

At‑risk populations

Few  studies  were  identified  for  the  population  at-risk  of 
psychosis,  which  limits  the  evidence  base  and  ability  to 
draw  conclusions  about  the  potential  cost-effectiveness 
of  interventions.  Three  of  the  studies  focused  on  CBT 
and  had  broadly  similar  results  (intervention  was  domi-
nant,  and  probability  of  cost-effectiveness  was  quite 
high) [28, 29, 31]. However, the Wijnen et al., study used 
inputs from the Ising et al., so this is perhaps overstating 
a  limited  evidence  base  [28,  31].  Perez  et  al.,  concluded 
that  intensive  intervention  which  aimed  to  improve 
liaison  between  primary  and  secondary  care  for  peo-
ple  with  early  signs  of  psychosis  was  cost-effective  [30]. 
The  measure  of  benefit  used  was  true-positive  referral 
which if linked to earlier effective treatment will be likely 
to  increase  health.  However,  it  does  rely  on  subsequent 
actions.

First‑episode psychosis populations

Interventions  targeting  the  population  with  FEP  were 
typically health improving, as shown in Table 3.

Over  half  of  the  studies  reported  potential  cost  sav-
ings from intervention, though only two studies reported 
cost  savings  as  statistically  significant,  indicating  some 
uncertainty.  Given  the  increase  in  health  and  frequency 
of cost savings being reported, it was common for studies 
to  state  that  interventions  were  dominant  (i.e.,  they  are 
health increasing and cost reducing). When interventions 
were  associated  with  increased  incremental  costs,  they 
were  typically  discussed  as  being  cost-effective.  There 
were two exceptions, both interventions that focused on 
treatment with antipsychotics; one study concluded that 
there were no statistically significant differences between

intervention  and  comparator  (guided  discontinuation  of 
antipsychotics  versus  maintenance)  [40]  and  Jin  et  al., 
found mixed results across antipsychotics, but concluded 
that  at  a  threshold  of  £20,000  per  QALY  gained  amisul-
pride is most likely to be cost-effective (39% probability), 
followed  by  risperidone  (30%)  and  olanzapine  (0.17%) 
[29].

Most  studies  conducted  sensitivity  analysis,  though 
these rarely had an impact on the main conclusions and 
were  not  often  comprehensive  or  justified  (e.g.  authors 
assumed  a  reduction  in  a  single  parameter  without  evi-
dence). The probability of cost-effectiveness (if reported) 
is  included  in  Table  3  and  overall,  this  indicated  a  high 
likelihood  of  cost-effectiveness  for  studies  reporting 
favourable  results.  There  was  some  investigation  into 
subgroups.  Rosenheck  et  al.,  conducted  a  sensitivity 
analysis  only  including  participants  with  a  low  duration 
of  untreated  psychosis  which  reduced  the  incremental 
cost-effectiveness  ratio  as  the  effect  was  greater  in  this 
group (compared to participants with a high duration of 
untreated  psychosis)  [39].  Behan  et  al.,  conducted  sub-
group  analysis  and  found  some  differences;  restricting 
to  the  functional  psychosis  subgroup  was  described  as 
highly  cost-effective,  restricting  to  a  younger  age  group 
(18–35)  was  less  likely  to  be  cost-effective  and  finally 
including  people  with  organic  psychosis,  or  psychosis 
secondary  to  a  general  medical  condition  (e.g.,  demen-
tia) resulted in the probability of early intervention being 
effective falling [32].

Discussion
The review aimed to identify full economic evaluations of 
interventions for people at risk of psychosis and for FEP, 
to  assess  whether  existing  interventions  are  cost-effec-
tive  and  to  review  the  robustness  of  the  evidence  base 
through  critical  appraisal.  The  review  identified  14  full 
economic  evaluations  focused  on  health  and  social  care 
interventions  for  people  at-risk  of  psychosis  and  with 
FEP.

For  the  at-risk  group,  evidence  was  limited,  with  only 
four studies identified in two countries. There was heter-
ogeneity across the populations and methods in the stud-
ies,  though  in  general  the  evidence  appears  favourable. 
However, the evidence overall for the at-risk group is lim-
ited in terms of the range of interventions and countries 
identified,  so  there  is  a  need  for  further  research  in  this 
area.

A  more  substantial  evidence  base  was  identified  for 
the  population  with  FEP,  with  11  studies  across  a  vari-
ety  of  countries  and  considering  a  range  of  intervention 
designs.  Often  (7/11)  studies  focused  on  early  interven-
tion  programmes  with  varied  design  and  in  all  but  one 
of  the  identified  studies  this  intervention  was  dominant 

versus  usual  care,  meaning  they  were  health  improving 
and cost saving [32,  34, 37–39, 41]. These findings align 
with a prior review of early intervention for people with 
psychosis, which concluded early intervention is likely to 
be  cost-effective  but  that  the  evidence  is  heterogeneous 
and  methods  could  be  improved  which  limits  certainty 
[49]. Again, for the other interventions considered results 
were  generally  positive  though  there  were  some  mixed 
findings.  Whilst  most  results  are  favourable  (suggesting 
interventions  in  FEP  offer  value  for  money)  some  cau-
tion is needed. In particular, the issues mentioned in the 
critical appraisal section will affect the validity and gener-
alisability  of  results. The  variability  of  early  intervention 
makes it difficult to judge which components and designs 
are  most  cost-effective.  Furthermore,  not  all  studies 
investigated  uncertainty  comprehensively  and  where  a 
probability of cost-effectiveness was presented, it was not 
always high.

This  review  has  some  limitations.  Grey  literature  and 
non-English  language  studies  were  outside  the  scope  of 
this review. Unpublished literature may be more likely to 
report  inconclusive  or  negative  findings  [50].  We  chose 
to  focus  on  full  economic  evaluations,  which  synthe-
sise  health  benefits  and  costs  to  provide  an  assessment 
of  value  for  money.  Partial  economic  evaluations  may 
offer  some  useful  information  for  decision-makers  and 
researchers if they are focused on health benefits or costs. 
Studies  which  included  participants  with  a  significant 
duration  of  illness  were  excluded,  which  may  limit  the 
scope of the review. These, and others in the wider popu-
lation  with  psychosis,  may  be  useful  to  decision  makers 
and researchers considering psychosis more generally.

There  are  many  limitations  with  the  current  evidence 
base.  Most  notably  uncertainty  around  the  results  with 
few  studies  reporting  significant  findings,  limited  sen-
sitivity  analysis  and  heterogeneity  across  methods.  It 
should be noted that a high level of heterogeneity in study 
objectives  and  methods  was  anticipated  and  is  in  align-
ment  with  the  conclusions  of  previous  reviews  of  cost-
effectiveness  in  groups  with  severe  mental  illness  [23, 
49,  51].  There  was  considerable  variation  in  the  health 
benefit  measure  used  in  studies;  whilst  interesting  and 
relevant  to  the  interventions,  this  heterogeneity  limits 
comparability between studies. For some measures there 
is no agreed threshold for the willingness to pay to gain a 
unit of outcome, whereas accepted thresholds exist for a 
QALY, making interpretation easier [52–54]. It is impor-
tant  to  consider  whether  the  measures  used  are  impor-
tant to people with psychosis or at high-risk of psychosis. 
A recent qualitative study concluded that aspects impor-
tant to people at high-risk (e.g., wellbeing and resilience) 
are not included in conventional measures [55]. A further 
paper identified that, as well as symptom improvements,

service users prioritised social and functional ability and 
satisfaction  [56].  Work  is  ongoing  in  this  area,  includ-
ing the development of new quality of life measures [57]. 
With  shorter  time  horizons  it  is  questionable  whether 
the authors were able to capture all important differences 
in  outcomes  and  costs  between  the  interventions  being 
compared,  as  is  recommended  in  economic  evaluation 
guidelines  [58].  For  early  intervention  services  there  is 
some evidence to suggest that longer-term provision has 
benefits (up to 10 years) though more research is needed 
[59,  60].  As  treatments  evolve  over  time,  it  is  likely  that 
the comparator arms used (e.g., usual care) may become 
outdated.  E.g.,  early  intervention  services  may  become 
standard practise and therefore be reflected in treatment 
as  usual  arms.  Some  of  the  trials  identified  were  very 
small  (n < 100),  and  applied  inclusion  and  exclusion  cri-
teria that may not be reflective of the broader population. 
Only one study comprehensively reported every item on 
the CHEERS statement, demonstrating a need for studies 
to improve reporting [29].

Several  areas  for  future  research  have  been  identified 
from  this  review.  Many  of  the  included  studies  empha-
sised a need for studies with larger sample sizes and only 
two studies investigated the impact of patient character-
istics on cost-effectiveness. Acknowledging patient heter-
ogeneity may increase efficiency and result in population 
gains  if  there  are  differing  results  across  subpopulations 
[61].  Longer-term  evidence  is  needed  to  explore  cost-
effectiveness  reflecting  remission  and  relapse  from  FEP 
over  time,  and  the  potential  for  intervention  to  impact 
costs  and  health  benefits  over  a  longer  duration.  Given 
that  current  guidelines  include  detection  and  treatment 
of those at risk of psychosis, methods to effectively iden-
tify  people  at-risk  should  also  be  evaluated  for  clinical 
and  cost-effectiveness  [1].  More  similar  methods  across 
studies  would  make  it  easier  to  summarise  the  evidence 
base  for  decision  makers.  For  example,  McCrone  et  al., 
recommended  future  studies  used  QALYs  and  investi-
gate  the  EQ-5D  versus  alternative  measures  for  utility 
[37].  Key  benefits  of  QALYs  are  that  they  can  be  easily 
compared  across  studies  and  willingness  to  pay  thresh-
olds  are  known,  although  there  is  mixed  evidence  for 
the  validity  of  generic  measures,  such  as  the  EQ-5D,  in 
the  population  with  severe  mental  illness  [62,  63].  The 
review included any health and social care interventions, 
but identified only one study focusing outside of mental 
health  symptoms  (on  weight  management),  which  had 
to  be  excluded  as  results  specific  to  the  FEP  were  not 
reported  separately  [64].  Given  the  chances  of  reduced 
physical  health  in  this  population,  including  increased 
cardiovascular disease which is linked to premature mor-
tality, this is an important gap in the evidence base [65]. 
People with first-episode schizophrenia have been shown 

to respond well to antipsychotics and these are typically 
a  standard  treatment  in  this  population  [66].  We  found 
very  limited  evidence  focusing  on  the  cost-effectiveness 
of  antipsychotics  in  this  population.  Though  there  are 
existing reviews of the cost-effectiveness of antipsychot-
ics  these  cover  wider  populations  [66–68].  As  people 
with  FEP  are  likely  to  respond  differently  compared  to 
populations  with  more  established  conditions  and  given 
the  variation  in  cost  and  side  effect  profiles  of  antipsy-
chotics, more research is needed to identify which antip-
sychotics  are  most  cost-effective  in  this  group.  Stant 
et  al.,  considered  a  strategy  of  tapering  and  discontinu-
ing antipsychotic treatment (i.e., withdrawal of standard 
treatment) which may currently contradict guidelines for 
standard care in this population.

Finally, evidence is from a limited number of countries, 
with  no  papers  from  low-  or  middle-income  countries 
identified,  despite  a  high  burden  associated  with  men-
tal ill health in these settings [69]. Three-quarters of the 
global  burden  of  mental,  neurological  and  substance 
use  disorders  lie  in  low  and  middle-income  countries 
(LMIC), yet 90% of this population does not have access 
to  mental  health  care  [70],  or  mental  health  research, 
which  builds  the  foundation  for  evidence-based  person-
centred  care.  Psychosis  is  one  of  the  20  leading  causes 
of  disability  worldwide,  affecting  29  million  people  [71] 
contributing  to  major  burden  in  LMIC.  Global  health 
research  has  now  started  to  receive  due  attention  from 
funders  in  high  income  countries  and  there  are  ongo-
ing  studies  in  ARMS  in  LMIC  [72].  Research  covering 
a  wider  range  of  settings  and  across  LMIC  is  needed  to 
ensure  decision  makers  have  evidence  relevant  to  their 
locality.

As  noted,  the  review  findings  align  with  a  previous 
review  by  Aceituno  et  al.,  which  described  largely  posi-
tive  findings  for  early  intervention  services  for  people 
with  psychosis,  and  which  also  reported  issues  with  the 
evidence  base  [49].  A  recent  study  reviewed  the  cost-
effectiveness  of  intervention  in  the  group  at  ultra-high 
risk  of  psychosis  (i.e.  ARMs)  and  again  came  to  similar 
conclusions;  that  whilst  study  results  are  predominantly 
positive  there  are  limitations  to  the  evidence  base  [73]. 
This  is  the  first  review  to  synthesise  cost-effectiveness 
results across the initial stages of psychosis.

Conclusions
There is a substantial health and economic burden asso-
ciated  with  psychotic  disorders  and  so  interventions  to 
prevent  psychosis  and  effectively  treat  FEP  are  needed. 
With  rising  healthcare  costs,  constrained  budgets  and 
a  growth  in  the  number  and  type  of  interventions,  eco-
nomic  evaluations  are  needed  to  assess  the  value  of 
interventions.  Whilst  most  studies  concluded  that 

 Shields et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:126 

Page 14 of 16

interventions  for  people  at  risk  of  psychosis  or  experi-
encing FEP are cost-saving or cost-effective, results were 
varied. However, the review identified several gaps in the 
literature (e.g., a paucity of high-quality studies, evidence 
in ARMS and evidence in low- or middle- income coun-
tries). A key limitation is that studies were heterogeneous 
(e.g., using different health benefit measures), which lim-
its comparison across studies: addressing this within the 
research community should be a key focus going forward.
