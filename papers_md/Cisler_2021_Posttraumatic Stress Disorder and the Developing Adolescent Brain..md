Posttraumatic stress disorder and the developing adolescent 
brain

Abstract

PTSD in adolescents is common and debilitating. In contrast to adult PTSD, relatively little is 
known about the neurobiology of adolescent PTSD, nor how current treatments may alter 
adolescent neurodevelopment to allow recovery from PTSD. Improving our understanding of 
biological mechanisms of adolescent PTSD, taken in the context of neurodevelopment, is crucial 
for developing novel and personalized treatment approaches. In this review, we highlight 
prevailing constructs of PTSD and current findings on these domains in adolescent PTSD. 
Notably, little data exist in adolescent PTSD for prominent adult PTSD constructs, including threat 
learning and attentional threat bias. Most work to date has examined general threat processing, 
emotion regulation, and their neural substrates. These studies suggest that adolescent PTSD, while 
phenomenologically similar to adult PTSD, shows unique neurodevelopmental substrates which 
may impair recovery, but could also be targeted in the context of adolescent neuroplasticity to 
improve outcomes. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal data suggest abnormal frontolimbic 
development compared to typically developing youth, a pattern which may differ from resilient 
youth. Whether current treatments such as trauma-focused psychotherapy engage these targets and 
restore healthy neurodevelopment remains an open question. We end our review by highlighting 
emerging areas and knowledge gaps that could be addressed to better characterize the biology 
underlying adolescent PTSD. Emerging studies in computational modeling of decision making, 
caregiver-related transmission of traumatic stress, and other areas may offer new targets which 
could harness adolescent neurobehavioral plasticity to improve resilience and recovery for some of 
our most vulnerable youth.

Introduction

Page 2

Approximately two-thirds of youth are exposed to trauma by late adolescence, and many 
develop PTSD as a result (1). By age 18, 8% of traumatized youth have met criteria for a 
diagnosis of PTSD, with numbers rising up to 40% in cases of sexual abuse and assault (1). 
In addition to the psychological suffering imposed, PTSD is associated with lower academic 
achievement and high rates of comorbidity including anxiety and depressive disorders (2). 
Strikingly, PTSD carries the highest risk of all mental illnesses for first suicide attempt in 
adolescents and young adults (3). Childhood trauma and PTSD also impart tremendous 
societal cost in terms of health care utilization and financial outlay, costing the United States 
an estimated $2 trillion annually (4,5). Current treatments for adolescent PTSD, which rely 
primarily on trauma-focused cognitive therapy, achieve only small to moderate effect sizes 
(6,7), leaving many youth unrecovered even if they are able to access skilled therapists. 
Remarkably, there are currently no evidence-based pharmacological options for treating 
adolescent PTSD. While the aforementioned therapies target presumed domains of 
dysfunction in adolescent PTSD, advancing our neurobiological understanding of the illness 
will be critical for tailoring current treatments and developing novel interventions for 
affected adolescents.

In this review, we aim to summarize our current understanding of the neurodevelopmental 
substrates of adolescent PTSD. However, PTSD is not a biological construct in and of itself. 
Thus, dysfunction is best understood across a constellation of cognitive, emotional, and 
biological systems. Accordingly, we focus the review on neurodevelopment in systems most 
commonly implicated in PTSD (e.g., emotion regulation). We also discuss emerging areas of 
study, including large-scale neural network approaches, computational modeling of decision 
making and caregiver transmission of traumatic stress. Finally, we consider how findings in 
these domains may inform the prevention and treatment of adolescent PTSD. We also refer 
readers to Supplement, which contains expanded discussion of prominent constructs and 
emerging areas implicated in adolescent PTSD.

Developmental considerations: Adolescence as a period of biological 

change and reorganization

Adolescence is characterized by dramatic changes in physiological and neuroendocrine 
systems, along with reorganization of neural systems subserving executive function, 
socioemotional processing, and emotion regulation. A more complete discussion of 
normative physiological change can be found elsewhere in this special issue (8). Pubertal 
onset is known to be associated with altered sensitivity of subcortical regions, notably the 
amygdala and striatum, to emotional stimuli albeit with mixed findings (9,10). This, coupled 
with the more prolonged development of frontoparietal regions involved in cognitive control 
and emotion regulation, is thought to underlie, in part, the rapid increase in affective 
disorders in adolescence (11). PTSD is no exception, in that it shows a marked increase in 
prevalence through adolescence (12). However, this has been difficult to separate from the 
concomitant increase in trauma exposure in adolescence (1,13), which may itself be driven 
in part by social reorienting to peers and increased social risk taking [see this issue (8,14)].

Sex hormones also influence the development of circuitry underlying cognitive-emotional 
interactions, though in nuanced ways (15,16), and which may contribute to the characteristic 
greater PTSD prevalence (2–3 fold) in adolescent females compared to males. As we 
explore neurodevelopmental substrates implicated in adolescent PTSD, we attempt to 
incorporate both age and pubertal influences on these systems in ways that may heighten 
PTSD risk, contribute to sex differences, and impact potential treatment response for 
adolescent PTSD.

Neural correlates of PTSD in adolescents

In this section, we briefly summarize neuroimaging findings in adolescent PTSD with an 
emphasis on neurodevelopment in emotion processing circuitry. However, an important 
question remaining in the field is whether these alterations represent transdiagnostic risk 
mechanisms for trauma-induced psychopathology, or whether certain neural substrates are 
specific to adolescent PTSD. We refer readers to recent reviews on this topic (17–19). While 
we focus here mainly on univariate investigations of brain function, recent studies have 
begun characterizing network-level alterations in pediatric PTSD (see Supplement).

The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus are implicated in numerous cognitive 
processes, but in the context of trauma and PTSD have largely been investigated with respect 
to constructs of threat learning and extinction, threat reactivity, and emotion regulation (see 
Supplement). As noted above, relative delays in prefrontal versus subcortical maturation 
(20,21) are thought to underlie, in part, the tendency for increased emotional reactivity in 
adolescence. Structural studies show relatively early maturation of amygdala and 
hippocampus which nonetheless continue into adolescence (21,22). However, prefrontal 
cortical regions show structural maturation well into adolescence and early adulthood, 
characterized by cortical thinning (20). Accordingly, functional imaging studies show that 
amygdala reactivity to negative faces and images decreases with age in adolescence (23–27), 
and is accompanied by greater structural and functional connectivity with the medial 
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in particular (23,24,27). These normative patterns likely underlie, 
in part, decreased reactivity to negative content and enhanced emotion-regulation capacity 
through adolescence (17). Notably, these neurodevelopmental patterns are embedded in the 
larger process of adolescent brain remodeling characterized by changes in association, 
limbic, and subcortical circuits subserving higher order processes (e.g., executive function, 
social cognition, and mentalizing) (28,29).

Structural brain studies most consistently show reduced gray matter volume in the 
ventromedial (vm)PFC, and either reduced or age-related decline in hippocampal volume in 
adolescent PTSD (30,31). In contrast, traumatized adolescents without PTSD show 
increased hippocampal volume and maintained vmPFC volume (32). In a longitudinal 
extension of our prior work, we examined structural brain development over one year in 
adolescents with PTSD compared to typically developing (TD) adolescents. Here, we found 
stable reductions in vmPFC and ventrolateral (vl)PFC volume in adolescent PTSD (33). The 
vmPFC has diverse functions, and in the context of PTSD, is notable for its role in stimulus 
valuation and inhibition of threat responses and amygdala reactivity (34). The vlPFC has 
also been heavily implicated in emotion regulation through its role in attentional control,

response inhibition, and emotion perception (35–37), and has direct anatomical connections 
to the amygdala (38). Notably, reduced volume in both vmPFC and vlPFC were associated 
with greater symptom severity in adolescents with PTSD. Finally, we found evidence of 
abnormal development in the dorsolateral (dl)PFC, characterized by a normative decrease in 
volume in TD youth, but absence of decline in adolescents with PTSD. Given the role of the 
dlPFC in emotion regulation and particularly reappraisal (37,39), the lack of dlPFC volume 
change could represent delayed development contributing to the persistence of PTSD. 
Alternatively, absent dlPFC volume change could serve to maintain plasticity in this key 
regulatory region while illness is ongoing. Further studies will be needed to better 
understand the functional and behavioral correlates of abnormal gray matter structure and 
development in adolescent PTSD, and whether such patterns differ by sex and pubertal 
stage.

In functional brain studies in adolescent trauma and PTSD, most work has focused on 
general threat processing and reactivity, with some additional study under resting state 
conditions. As noted in prior reviews (17,40,41), childhood trauma and adversity are broadly 
associated with increased amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli and decreased resting 
functional coupling between the amygdala, hippocampus and vmPFC irrespective of PTSD 
status (42,43). Such changes may serve an adaptive response allowing, for example, 
enhanced threat detection and learning (17). Conversely, maintained or enhanced coupling 
between the amygdala and dorsal/lateral prefrontal regions involved in emotional appraisal 
and regulation may be an important factor for resilience in trauma-exposed adolescents 
(44,45). Supporting this notion, childhood trauma is associated with increased prefrontal 
recruitment and amygdala-prefrontal coupling during emotion regulation in healthy 
adolescents or when adjusting for affective symptoms (44,46–49). In contrast, adolescents 
with PTSD show reduced prefrontal engagement, as well as reduced coupling between 
regulatory prefrontal regions (vlPFC, dorsomedial [dm]PFC) and amygdala (17).

Importantly, adolescence may be a key period determining risk and resilience trajectories of 
prefrontal-amygdala and -hippocampal development. In our prior work, we identified age-
related abnormalities in prefrontal-amygdala function in adolescent PTSD. Specifically, 
while TD adolescents exhibit decreased amygdala reactivity and increased amygdala-
vmPFC coupling to emotional stimuli with age, adolescents with PTSD show the reverse 
pattern (17), exhibiting a neural profile similar to adult PTSD by late adolescence. Our 
recent longitudinal extension further supports the notion of abnormal prefrontal-amygdala 
and -hippocampal development in adolescent PTSD. Specifically, while TD adolescents 
show increased connectivity between vmPFC-amygdala, vlPFC-amygdala, and dlPFC-
hippocampus over one year, adolescents with PTSD show the reverse pattern and 
independent of pubertal stage (33).

Declining dlPFC-hippocampus connectivity was further associated with greater symptom 
severity, suggesting that ongoing disruptions in prefrontal-amygdala and -hippocampal 
development may contribute to persistence or worsening of PTSD in adolescence. We next 
discuss how these circuits may be involved in treatment and remission in adolescent PTSD.

Longitudinal imaging studies examining treatment and remission of adolescent PTSD

To date, few studies have examined the neural correlates of treatment intervention or 
remission in adolescent PTSD. In a preliminary study of TF-CBT in adolescent girls with 
PTSD (N=23), we found that more differential activation of the amygdala to threat vs. 
neutral faces pre-treatment predicted greater symptom reduction over a 12-week course of 
TF-CBT (50). Additionally, this study showed that pre- to post-treatment change in 
suppression during reappraisal of negative images was associated with symptom reduction 
(51). While this study lacked a comparison group, these initial findings suggest that 
enhanced neural differentiation of threat-neutral content prior to treatment may allow for 
greater use of TF-CBT skills including trauma narrative exposure, while functioning in this 
network itself may be a potential target of TF-CBT.

A more recent study examined the impact of TF-CBT on neural function in adolescents with 
PTSD relative to TD adolescents (N=40) at baseline and post-treatment (5 months). Using a 
face processing task, only the posterior cingulate/precuneus showed a group by time effect 
using whole-brain analysis. Here, independent of face emotion, youth with PTSD showed 
reduced activation over the treatment course, which further correlated with symptom 
reduction (52). In ROI-based analyses, youth with PTSD also showed reductions over time 
in hippocampus, amygdala, midcingulate cortex (MCC), dmPFC, and vlPFC activation to 
neutral faces relative to TD adolescents. Of these, change in hippocampus and MCC 
activation were associated with total PTSD symptom reduction. While this study lacked a 
PTSD treatment comparison group, these findings suggest that symptom improvement in 
adolescents with PTSD may be mediated in part by reduced engagement of prefrontal-
amygdala and -hippocampal circuitry to neutral faces, potentially enhancing threat 
discrimination.

Finally, we recently reported structural brain correlates of persistence and remission of 
adolescent PTSD in a naturalistic longitudinal study (53). Here, we examined cortical 
morphometry and subcortical volume change in adolescents with persistent or remitted 
PTSD at one year relative to TD adolescents (N=55). Adolescents with persistent PTSD 
showed contraction of vlPFC surface area compared to both remitters and TD. In contrast, 
PTSD remission was associated with expansion of frontal pole surface area and vmPFC 
thickness over time. Across clinical groups, vmPFC thickness was inversely associated with 
symptom severity. While limited in sample size, these findings suggest that structural 
plasticity, particularly in prefrontal regions involved in emotion regulation, may be 
responsible for PTSD recovery in adolescents. The frontal pole and vmPFC are notable 
given findings in a controlled study in adult PTSD demonstrating that prolonged exposure 
enhanced frontopolar activation and connectivity with the vmPFC during cognitive 
reappraisal, which were further associated with symptom improvement (54). However, to 
more precisely define treatment and recovery substrates in adolescent PTSD, future 
neuroimaging clinical trials are warranted incorporating an expanded sample size, 
multimodal imaging, and a treatment control arm to determine treatment-specific 
biomarkers.

Trauma sensitive periods, stress acceleration, and implications for adolescent PTSD

At present, little is known about developmental trauma sensitive periods in risk for 
adolescent PTSD, nor how childhood trauma may alter the pace of brain maturation to 
confer such risk. This area is also confounded with increasing trauma load as youth age, 
leaving an open question of whether to interpret any differences as trauma sensitive periods 
or cumulative stress effects. However, neuroimaging studies of trauma exposure and 
adolescent PTSD offer potential clues to differential brain maturation with trauma and 
PTSD. In our prior cross-sectional work, youth with PTSD paradoxically show lower 
amygdala reactivity, greater dmPFC activation, and greater amygdala-vmPFC connectivity at 
younger ages (<15 years), a pattern which appears to reverse by late adolescence and 
independent of age at index trauma, PTSD duration, or pubertal stage (26,55). A 
retrospective study in adults also found that preadolescent abuse was associated with 
blunting of amygdala reactivity, while adolescent abuse was associated with increased 
amygdala reactivity (56). Additionally, studies of youth exposed to environmental adversity 
suggest accelerated functional brain maturation including prefrontal-amygdala connectivity 
(57,58). These findings suggest a potential stress acceleration in the development of circuitry 
supporting socioemotional processing and regulation (18). We have speculated that such 
compensatory neurodevelopment may be degraded by adolescence in vulnerable youth with 
additional trauma exposure (17). While further study is clearly needed to map 
neurodevelopmental responses to trauma and risk for adolescent PTSD, these findings raise 
the intriguing possibility of unique biotypes of adolescent PTSD dependent on trauma 
characteristics (19) including age of trauma exposure, cumulative stress effects, type of 
trauma exposure, as well as early stress acceleration responses which may alter the 
development of socioemotional regulatory systems.

A biopsychosocial model of adolescent PTSD: Emerging directions

The current review is by no means exhaustive, but hopefully highlights three main 
observations. First, there is a general lack of research specifically conducted in adolescent 
PTSD and an overreliance on models and findings derived from the adult PTSD literature 
(see Supplement). Second, most biological studies of adolescent PTSD have not been placed 
in the normative context of adolescent neurodevelopment, which is particularly important 
given the enhanced neuroplasticity characteristic of this period. Third, PTSD likely impacts 
multiple functional domains, yet most studies to date have focused on general threat 
processing and emotion regulation (see Supplement for additional constructs). The specific 
functional domains affected are likely to be different for each individual, underscoring the 
fact that PTSD itself is not a unitary or biological construct.

In Figure 1, we propose a working model of adolescent PTSD that incorporates multiple 
socioenvironmental influences, mediating biological systems, and functional domains 
relevant for understanding and treating adolescent PTSD, though it is by no means an 
exhaustive model. Consistent with dimensional approaches to psychopathology, we 
purposefully leave out a final pathway towards a diagnostic construct. Instead, we suggest 
that the impact of trauma and PTSD on these functional domains could be more informative 
for elucidating the neurobiology of adolescent PTSD and generating precision medicine

approaches. In this model, known vulnerability factors such as genetic variation, low social 
support, female sex, or pre-existing internalizing symptoms interact (along with the type and 
severity of trauma) to influence an adolescent’s perception of a traumatic event (59,60). 
Further, interactive influences come from responses and modeling of caregivers (and peers) 
which may ameliorate or worsen an adolescent’s perception of trauma. Perceived trauma 
may then activate multiple biological systems involved in the stress response including 
release of cortisol and proinflammatory cytokines (61), altered sleep function (62), and 
coincident epigenetic changes (63) that may further the stress response. Activation of these 
biological pathways, in turn, can negatively impact neural function and development of 
systems underlying emotion regulation (17), reward processing (64), learning and decision 
making (14,64), and social cognition (65). Functional compromise in these domains, such as 
heightened threat reactivity, reduced emotion regulation and reward learning, poor extinction 
learning, and misinterpretation of social information may subsequently exacerbate perceived 
trauma/stress and negatively impact the caregiver relationship or caregiver modeling in a 
vicious cycle. By the same token, maintained functioning in these domains and caregiver/
peer influence could serve to ameliorate the adolescent’s trauma perception and hasten 
recovery in biological systems. We again refer readers to Supplement for expanded 
discussion of biological systems and functional domains implicated in the above model. 
While most of these sociobiological systems and functional domains have received limited 
or no study in adolescent PTSD, below we highlight emerging research which could offer 
fruitful targets for intervention and improving outcomes for adolescent PTSD.

Learning and decision making

Adolescence is characterized by changes in learning and decision making that may have 
important implications for understanding adolescent PTSD [this issue (14,66)], such as 
increased risky decision-making during social or emotional contexts (67,68). The 
burgeoning field of computational psychiatry may shed light on important mechanisms of 
learning and decision-making in early life trauma and adolescent PTSD. In contrast to 
standard laboratory tasks that present stimuli to which participants can only react and not 
interact (e.g., emotional face viewing), modeling 1) how individuals make decisions about 
when, whether, and how to pursue reward and avoid threat, and 2) how individuals learn 
from experience to update expectations about reward and threat, may provide a more 
realistic laboratory paradigm for understanding the development and treatment of PTSD. 
Mathematical modeling of decision-making during these tasks formalizes cognitive 
hypotheses about behavior that can be explicitly quantified and tested against alternative 
models. As a recent example, we demonstrated that increased trauma load in adolescent girls 
was associated with impaired reward learning performance, greater variability in action 
selection, and decreased encoding of negative reward prediction errors in the salience 
network during decision-making (69,70). In adult PTSD, recent computational modeling 
work (71,72) suggests that increased PTSD severity is related to heightened encoding of 
associability [a dynamic learning rate reflecting increased attentional salience in response to 
volatility in the learning context (73)] in the anterior insula, ventral striatum, and amygdala. 
It is not currently clear how this modeling work interacts with normative neurodevelopment 
occurring during adolescence and if similar results would be expected in adolescent PTSD. 
An additional domain that will be important to characterize is how adolescents with PTSD

make decisions about reward in the context of threat [approach-avoidance conflict learning 
(74)]. Specifically, the mechanisms by which adolescents prioritize sacrificing reward (e.g., 
peer interaction) for the sake of avoiding potential threat/trauma reminders presumably 
involves a complex interaction between higher-order goals and beliefs, valuations of reward, 
and expectations for threat. Relatedly, how adolescents incorporate signals from caregivers 
(or peers, see also below) in their decision-making will be important for fully characterizing 
the mechanisms underlying development and maintenance of adolescent PTSD.

Additionally, whereas most prior work has utilized relatively simplistic models of learning 
(e.g., Rescorla-Wagner models), emerging work in computational neuroscience emphasizes 
model-based decision-making strategies (75–78), in which individuals form abstract 
cognitive maps of a learning environment to inform prospective decision-making. 
Particularly relevant for treatment of PTSD with exposure therapy, classic model-free 
conceptualizations (e.g., Rescorla-Wagner models) do not explain return of fear following 
extinction (75,79–81). However, model-based theories readily explain this phenomenon and 
thereby implicate higher-order learning mechanisms (e.g., frontoparietal network) in threat 
extinction and exposure therapy. Incorporating model-based decision-making approaches 
into future research in adolescent PTSD may provide better characterization of nuanced 
biases in decision-making with potential for rapid clinical translation in this population.

Caregiver transmission of traumatic stress

Caregiver transmission of traumatic stress to the child involves both behaviorally modeled 
and genetic influences. Regarding modeling, caregivers are a vital source of information on 
numerous domains including social cognition, emotion regulation, and threat-safety 
discrimination. Thus, caregiver function and modeling are likely to have a major impact on 
PTSD risk in adolescents. For example, parental anxiety has direct environmental 
transmission to their adolescent offspring (82), which can be mitigated by parent coaching 
(83). Parental anxious rearing also mediates the effects of stressful life events on youth 
anxiety through early adolescence (84). More specific to PTSD, parental PTSD is associated 
with child distress and behavior problems and altered HPA axis functioning, particularly 
when both parent and child have been exposed to interpersonal violence (85,86). 
Furthermore, maternal emotion dysregulation increases risk for child PTSD symptoms (87), 
while lower levels of parent distress and PTSD following a child’s trauma predict more 
favorable outcomes for the child (88). Finally, in TF-CBT, which incorporates both caregiver 
and child, improvements in parent distress and symptomatology mediate broad 
improvements in internalizing and externalizing symptoms in youth with PTSD (89,90). 
While an early area of research, these studies suggest that caregiver modeling is likely to 
have a significant impact on shaping adolescent development of processes including emotion 
regulation and threat-safety discrimination to influence both risk for and progression of 
PTSD in adolescents. However, to date studies have focused primarily on correlation of 
caregiver-child subjective reports using cross-sectional designs. While admittedly a complex 
area of study, our understanding of caregiver modeling and PTSD risk in adolescence could 
be enhanced through longitudinal designs incorporating bidirectional influence of caregiver 
and child function (following prior literature examining caregiver-child interactions), and 
utilizing more objective measures of these functional domains to assess caregiver influence

on disease course in adolescent PTSD. For example, studies could test how well 
psychophysiological measures of caregiver emotion regulation or threat-safety 
discrimination “transfer” to their adolescent, and whether these processes are maladaptive in 
the context of caregiver and/or child psychopathology. Finally, genetic transmission of 
traumatic stress has gained increasing recognition, with studies demonstrating epigenetic 
alterations particularly in child cortisol and glucocorticoid pathways beginning prenatally 
(91). Thus, future studies would ideally capture both parental modeling as well as genetic 
pathways to more fully understand intergenerational transmission of traumatic stress and 
risk for PTSD in adolescence.

Implications for intervention

Altogether, the studies and models posited above point to an urgent need to better 
understand the underlying neurobiology of adolescent PTSD and translate such knowledge 
into neuroscience-guided treatments. With extant studies, there are already a number of 
salient points regarding treatment implications for adolescent PTSD. First, neurobiological 
studies indicate that adolescent PTSD is not simply a recapitulation of adult PTSD – there 
are underlying neurodevelopmental processes such as reduced threat extinction, altered risk 
tolerance, and decision making that need to be considered in tailoring treatment for 
adolescents with PTSD. Treatments may therefore need to be properly tailored for 
adolescents by, for example, increasing or augmenting the number of exposure sessions in 
psychotherapy, increasing focus on emotion regulation capacity (e.g. CBT, mindfulness), 
and more explicitly incorporating peer support in treatment to enhance perceived social 
support. Second, PTSD itself is not a biological or unitary construct. Interventions therefore 
need to consider actual domains of dysfunction rather than trying to target a syndrome. 
Ideally, we would clinically profile an adolescent in every system/domain shown in Figure 1 
and target those areas accordingly. This could mean, for example, specifically targeting the 
inflammatory response, augmenting sleep, and improving decision making abilities for a 
given youth. Third, neuroimaging studies have identified key circuits, notably the dlPFC, 
that could be targeted in neuromodulation trials to determine whether augmenting this circuit 
can improve clinical outcomes. Fourth, studies to date suggest that while adolescents with 
PTSD show a pernicious neurodevelopmental trajectory, they also remain in a window of 
increased neuroplasticity. Future trials would be warranted to examine the developmental 
period of intervention (e.g. early vs. late adolescence vs. adult) to determine unique 
developmental influences and guide treatment tailoring and policy. Fifth, and of no surprise 
to clinicians treating adolescents, the socioenvironmental context needs to be more fully 
considered in adolescent PTSD. Caregivers are key in this equation even for adolescents. 
Studies suggest that parenting behaviors are an important predictor of adolescent PTSD 
following trauma (92), while caregiver depression moderates psychotherapy outcomes for 
both adolescent depression and PTSD (93,94). Social support also appears to reduce the 
effect that adversity has on neural indices of threat processing and emotion regulation in 
youth (95), suggesting that interventions targeting the family system could have both 
behavioral and neurodevelopment benefits for adolescents suffering from PTSD.

Conclusion

Page 10

In summary, adolescent PTSD remains a complicated disorder affecting many adolescents 
and portends poor outcomes well into adulthood. Mitigating the effects of trauma and PTSD 
in adolescents will require further investment in longitudinal, neurobiological research 
assessing multiple functional domains. Given the inherent difficulties in recruiting and 
studying trauma-exposed youth, our field would benefit from a consortium-based approach 
to expand sample sizes needed to more fully address trauma heterogeneity, 
neurodevelopmental patterns of risk and resilience, and sensitive periods for both trauma 
impact and intervention. Such an effort is currently underway (41) and, coupled with 
individual research programs, promises to accelerate discovery and treatment for some of 
our most vulnerable youth.

Figure 1 : 
Psychosocial and biological model linking early life trauma exposure to multiple systems 
and functional domains likely contributing to risk or resilience for adolescent PTSD. Pre-
trauma factors such as genetic loading and social support (far left) moderate the impact of 
trauma (i.e. perceived trauma) on youth. In the peritraumatic period, caregiver (as well as 
peer) responses and emotional modeling further influence adolescent perception of the 
trauma and sense of safety in a reciprocal manner. The cumulative or ongoing perceived 
threat may then impact multiple biological systems in youth, which in turn impact

neurodevelopmental processes involving multiple functional domains (far right). In an 
iterative feedback loop, changes in functional domains may ameliorate or exacerbate 
biological stress response systems such as sleep biology or inflammation, as well as 
caregiver and adolescent perceived threat and emotion regulation. This feedback loop may 
again ameliorate or exacerbate changes in biological stress response systems. With exception 
of emotion regulation, most of the biological systems and functional domains listed have 
received little study in adolescent PTSD.
