Abstract
Few studies have investigated the offspring of women with anorexia nervosa (AN). The aim of this study was to examine 
perinatal status, mental and physical health in the offspring of mothers with a history of AN. Fifty-one individuals with 
adolescent-onset AN and 51 matched controls (COMP) have been followed prospectively. Presently, 30 years after AN 
onset, at a mean age of 44 years, female participants who had given birth  (nAN = 40,  nCOMP = 40) were interviewed regard-
ing psychiatric health in their offspring using the Developmental and Well-Being Assessment and the MINI International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview. In addition, information on the offspring’s perinatal status, psychiatric- and physical health was 
obtained from the Swedish Medical Birth Register and The Swedish National Patient Register. Data regarding mental and 
physical health were available for 83 and 86 offspring in the AN and COMP groups, respectively. At birth, all of weight, 
length, head circumference and ponderal index were significantly reduced in the offspring of mothers with a history of AN. 
In adolescence, parental interviews indicated an overrepresentation of current psychiatric diagnoses in the offspring of moth-
ers with AN. Compared with the offspring in the COMP group, endocrinological, immune and metabolic disorders were 
much more common in the offspring of the AN group. In conclusion, a history of AN increases the risk of worse perinatal 
outcome of the offspring. Later on, in childhood and adolescence, psychiatric and physical morbidity may be overrepresented 
in the offspring of women with AN.

Introduction

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is one of the most severe psychiatric 
disorders affecting women of reproductive age. In the acute 
phase of AN, amenorrhea and infertility are common [1]. 
According to some studies reproductive functions normal-
ize after weight restoration and recovery from AN [2–4]. 
Some reports, however, indicate delays in reproduction and 
reduced fertility rates in individuals with a history of AN 
[5–7]. An elevated risk of birth and perinatal complications, 
including higher rates of preterm deliveries, lower birth 
weight, smaller head circumference, lower Apgar scores 
and perinatal mortality, compared with controls, has been 
reported for women with ongoing AN or a history of AN 
[8–14]. Results from previous studies are partly inconsist-
ent with some studies reporting more favorable perinatal 
outcomes for women with a history of AN [15, 16].

Parental mental illness is known to be associated with 
a  general  increase  in  psychopathology  in  the  offspring

[17–19]. The effect of parental eating disorder (ED) on the 
offspring’s psychiatric health has received limited attention 
but available findings indicate that children of mothers with 
ED have an elevated risk for poorer developmental outcomes 
including more problems with feeding and eating behav-
iours, socio-emotional difficulties and psychopathology [20, 
21]. A large population-based study showed that 3.5-year-
old children of women with a lifetime history of AN had a 
higher risk of emotional problems in particular, compared 
with unexposed children [22]. When the children were 7, 10 
and 13 years old, they more often had emotional and anxiety 
disorders compared with controls [23]. Similar findings were 
presented by Barona, Nybo Andersen and Micali [24] who 
showed that mothers with lifetime AN were more likely to 
report emotional problems in their daughters and emotional 
and conduct problems in their sons. In addition, an increased 
risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children of mothers 
with EDs, especially of those with EDs during pregnancy, 
has been reported [25]. In contrast, Stein et al. [26] found 
no differences in general psychopathology between 10-year-
old children of mothers with an ED and controls. Moreover, 
children of mothers with a history of ED are more likely to 
develop an ED themselves [27]. The influence of parental 
ED is partly explained by genetics as family and twin stud-
ies repeatedly have shown that EDs are strongly familial. 
Relatives of probands with AN demonstrate that the disorder 
aggregates in families [28, 29]. Twin studies have shown 
heritability estimates of AN ranging from 0.48 to 0.74 [30].
Very little is known about the physical health in children 
of mothers with ED. A handful of studies have indicated that 
children of mothers with an ongoing ED or with a history of 
ED exhibit poor weight gain and poor growth development 
[31, 32]. In severe cases, the aberrant development has been 
classified as secondary to undernourishment [33].

To summarize, growing evidence supports a history of 
AN constituting a risk of perinatal complications. Further, 
an elevated risk of psychopathology in the offspring of indi-
viduals with AN has been reported. The main focus of previ-
ous research has been the offspring’s early development and 
less is known about psychopathology in adolescence and 
young adulthood. To the best of our knowledge, the physical 
health of the offspring of mothers with AN has so far not 
been systematically investigated.

Our research group has conducted a prospective lon-
gitudinal case–control study of individuals with adoles-
cent-onset AN over the past 30 years. In the present study, 
based on the knowledge gaps identified above, we aimed 
at  investigating  whether  children  of  mothers  with  AN 
constitute a risk group for worse outcome with regard to 
(i) perinatal status, (ii) the prevalence of EDs and other 
psychiatric disorders, and (iii) the prevalence of physi-
cal disorders. We hypothesized that the offspring in the 
AN group would exhibit a poorer perinatal status and an 

increased prevalence of psychiatric morbidity and more 
physical problems compared with the offspring of the con-
trol group.

Method

Participants

In 1985, all 4291 individuals born in 1970 and attend-
ing eighth grade in schools in Gothenburg, Sweden, were 
screened  for  AN.  The  eight-graders  completed  an  ED 
symptom questionnaire and underwent a physical exami-
nation. One of the authors (MR) scrutinized the growth 
charts  and  ED  questionnaires  of  all  4291  children  and 
examined in person each case with a suspicion of AN. In 
total, 25 individuals (23 females, two males) met the crite-
ria for AN in the 1970 birth cohort. One of the girls refused 
an  in-depth  examination,  leaving  22  females  and  two 
males to constitute the population-based group. A popu-
lation screening group was also recruited for the study and 
consisted of 27 adolescents with AN (26 females, 1 male) 
born in 1969 and in 1971–1977. The population screening 
group was reported to the researchers by the school health 
service. The groups were combined to constitute the AN 
group, consisting of 51 subjects (48 women, 3 men) (see 
[34, 35] for details). All 51 adolescents met the DSM-III-R 
[36] and the DSM-IV [37] criteria for AN. A comparison 
group (COMP group) was recruited, the individuals were 
selected by the school health nurses and were matched 
for gender, age and school. In the original study physical 
and psychiatric symptoms were examined in all individu-
als in the AN and COMP group, and their mothers were 
interviewed by a psychiatrist concerning family situation, 
early development, temperament, personality, physical and 
mental symptoms. The adolescents of the COMP group 
had no history of ED. Concerning psychiatric comorbid-
ity, at the time of the first examination, 86% percent of 
the adolescents in the AN group had an axis I diagnosis 
(other than AN) or depressed mood, compared with 22% 
of the individuals in the COMP group. The majority of the 
diagnoses were mood disorders [34].

Previous examinations of the sample

The 51 individuals in the AN group and the 51 individuals 
in the COMP group have previously been examined on four 
occasions (AN study 1, AN study 2, AN study 3 and AN study 
4), at a mean age of 16, 21, 24 and 32 years [16, 34, 35, 
38, 39]. There has been no attrition in any of the previous 
follow-up studies.

The present study

All 102 participants in the AN and the COMP groups were 
contacted and invited to participate in AN study 5, 30 years 
after the onset of AN, at a mean age of 44 years. Four indi-
viduals in the AN group (two women, two men) declined 
participation, leaving 47 participants. All 51 individuals in 
the COMP group agreed to participate. Data on the male 
participants were excluded due to their small number, leav-
ing 46 and 48 participants in the AN and COMP group 
respectively to answer “the general questions about repro-
duction and offspring” (described in detail below). Partici-
pants with offspring were asked if they would agree to take 
part in interviews regarding their offspring’s health status. 
Thirty-three females in the AN group and 40 women in the 
COMP group agreed to participate. In addition, complemen-
tary data were obtained from the Swedish Medical Birth 
Register (SMBR) (see supplementary figure S1).

Outcome measures

Psychiatric health of the mothers

The MINI International Neuropsychiatric interview [40] 
was used to assess psychiatric disorders, including EDs, in 
the mothers. The Eating disorder module of the Structured 
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (SCID-
I) [41] and a DSM-5 [42] criteria checklist for feeding and 
eating disorders was also used to assign ED diagnoses. The 
Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale [37] was 
applied to measure general outcome. Weight and height were 
measured on the day of the interviews [43].

General questions about reproduction and offspring

All subjects were asked three brief questions about repro-
duction and offspring: (1) whether the mother had any bio-
logical/adopted or stepchildren (and, if so, the gender, age 
and number of children born); (2) whether the participant 
had any first-degree relatives with underweight or over-
weight, any eating-related problems, including EDs, and (3) 
whether their offspring had any severe somatic or psychiatric 
disorder.

The results presented below is based on data regarding 

the biological children in the AN and COMP group.

Perinatal status measures

The perinatal outcome measures were based on data from 
the SMBR. The following perinatal variables were selected: 
gestational age, birth weight, birth length, head circumfer-
ence, Apgar score (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace response, 
Activity, Respiration) [44] at 1, 5 and 10 min, and perinatal 

death (death within six days of birth). The ponderal index 
(PI), a standard measure for reporting body mass in new-
borns (kg/m3) was calculated. Preterm birth was defined as 
a dichotomous variable (birth at < 259 days of gestation). 
Maternal weight and height were recorded when the mother 
was  enrolled  at  the  maternal  health  care  center,  usually 
between week 6–10 of pregnancy, and were used as a meas-
ure of pre-pregnancy body mass index.

Measures of health and psychiatric problems 
in the offspring

For 0–4-year-old children, a brief semi-structured inter-
view  was  conducted,  targeting  developmental  problems 
in infancy, including sleep, colic, breastfeeding, selective 
eating, parental concern regarding weight and psychomotor 
development. The interview was used for the first time in AN 
Study 4, the 18-year follow-up [16]. The interview has not 
been tested for validity or reliability. The mothers completed 
the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) regard-
ing children 2–17 years old. The SDQ is a brief well-estab-
lished, well-validated questionnaire used for general mental 
health screening in children [45] that has been translated into 
more than 50 languages. The SDQ comprises 25 items that 
are divided into five subscales: emotional symptoms, con-
duct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems and prosocial 
behavior. Each of the items is rated on a three-point Lik-
ert scale: “not true”, “somewhat true”, or “certainly true”. 
The score of each subscale ranges from 0–20; the higher the 
score, the more symptoms. The prosocial behavior subscale 
is inverted. The SDQ is completed by parents reporting on 
the child’s behavior in the past six months. The Swedish 
adaptation of the questionnaire has been validated, and the 
following cut-off scores for values above the 90th percentile 
have been proposed: total difficulties ≥ 14; emotional symp-
toms ≥ 5; conduct problems ≥ 4; hyperactivity ≥ 6; peer prob-
lems ≥ 5; prosocial behavior ≤ 6 [46]. Regarding children 
younger than 5 years, cut-off scores suggested by Dahlberg, 
Fält, Ghaderi, Sarkadi, & Salari [47] were used (total diffi-
culties ≥ 12; emotional symptoms ≥ 3; conduct problems ≥ 4; 
hyperactivity ≥ 5; peer problems ≥ 2; prosocial behavior ≤ 6).
In the study of psychiatric health in offspring at or above 
age 18 years, the same interview procedure as for the assess-
ment of psychiatric disorders in the mothers was used, i.e. 
the mother answered the questions concerning their adult 
offspring. The parent-reported ADHD Rating Scale IV [48] 
was administered to investigate Attention-Deficit/Hyperac-
tivity Disorder for children at or above age 5 years. The 
developmental  and  well-being  assessment  (DAWBA),  a 
well-validated parental interview, was used to assess psy-
chiatric health in 5–17-year-old children. The instrument 
generates ICD-10 and DSM-IV diagnoses. The DAWBA has 
separate sections covering individual emotional, behavioral 

3484

and hyperactivity disorders, including a section for diagnos-
ing EDs. A web-based version (www. dawba. net) [49] was 
administered. The timeframe of the interview is the present 
and recent past; for instance, anxiety disorders are based on 
the past four weeks while conduct disorders are based on the 
previous twelve months.

Interview instruments were selected according to the age 
of the offspring (see Fig. 1). The interviewer was blinded 
to the participant’s group status. Before the interview the 
participant was informed that she should not reveal whether 
she had a history of AN or not. The interviewer was blinded 
until all interviews were completed. The majority of the 
offspring interviews were performed face-to-face, although 
online video conferences/telephone interviews were per-
formed with twelve of the mothers (AN group, n = 3; COMP 
group, n = 9).

As a complement to the interviews, the Swedish National 
Patient Register (NPR) was searched for any psychiatric 
diagnoses coded according to the International Statistical 
Classification of diseases and Related health problems, 10th 
edition [50], codes F00-F99. The NPR covers diagnoses of 
inpatient care from 1973 and specialized outpatient care 
from 2001. We had access to data from January 1, 1996, 
until December 31, 2015. Of the children below 18 years of 
age, 59 out of 67 (88%) in the AN group, and 57 out of 74 
(77%) in the COMP group were found in the NPR.

Physical health and body mass index of the offspring

Physical disorders were identified in the NPR using ICD-
10  codes  for  in-  and  outpatient  visits.  All  mothers  of 

5–25-year-old offspring were asked to report weight and 
height of their children, and body mass index (BMI) was 
calculated and converted to standard deviation scores (SDS) 
based on the specific age and gender of each child. Four 
BMI  categories  were  derived:  underweight  (< -1  SD), 
normal weight (± 1 SD), overweight (> + 1SD) and obese 
(> + 2SD).

Ethics

Data were collected from May 2015 through November 
2016.  The  study  was  approved  by  the  Regional  Ethical 
Review Board at the University of Gothenburg (398–14). 
The  mothers  participated  voluntarily  after  giving  their 
informed  consent.  Research  based  on  offspring  register 
data was approved for children below age 18 years. For this 
reason, no register data were extracted for offspring who 
had turned 18 at the time of the examination of the mother. 
Informed consent was not collected from the offspring, as 
they were not participating in the study.

Statistical analyses

Statistical analysis was carried out by using SPSS, version 
28.0. Group comparisons between the mothers in the AN 
and COMP group were tested mainly with non-parametric 
tests, due to the data not being normally distributed. The 
Mann–Whitney test was used for continuous variables and 
Chi-squared test or Fisher’s Exact test for dichotomous vari-
ables. Offspring data were mainly analyzed with Generalized 
Estimating Equations (GEE) for dichotomous variables, and

for continuous variables, a mixed model was used to account 
for clusters among the women as some contributed to the

set at a p value of < 0.05.

pregnancies). We found significantly lower BMI and GAF 
scores among the mothers in the AN group compared with 
the COMP group at mean age 44 (present study) (Table 1). 
Psychiatric  disorders  were  significantly  more  common 
among the mothers in the AN group.

Attrition

Perinatal status of the children

Total offspring interview attrition applied to seven mothers 
of 19 children in the AN group and two mothers of four chil-
dren in the COMP group, leaving 33 and 38 mothers in the 
AN and COMP group respectively to answer the questions. 
Of the participating mothers, four children in the AN and 
three in the COMP group were evaluated only with the SDQ. 
One of the mothers in the AN group who did not complete 
the offspring interviews had a current ED. The seven moth-
ers in the AN group who declined the offspring interviews 
did  not  differ  significantly  from  the  participating  moth-
ers with regard to age, BMI and ED duration (mean age: 
non-participants: 45.3, SD:1.4; participants: 44.4, SD:1.8, 
p = 0.11; mean BMI: non-participants: 21.4, SD: 1.6; par-
ticipants: 22.8, SD: 4.6, p = 0.53; mean ED duration in years: 
non-participants: 6.6, SD: 3.3; participants: 9.7, SD: 7.6, 
p = 0.30). Additional register data gave us complementary 
information on the offspring’s status. Combining all sources, 
at least some data regarding physical and mental health were 
available on 90.2% and 100% of the offspring in the AN 
and COMP group, respectively. Thirty-six of the women in 
the AN group and 32 of the mothers in the COMP group 
were found in the SMBR, providing data on 82 (88%) and 
68 (79%) neonates, respectively. Participants living abroad/
giving birth abroad were not found in the SMBR and this 
applied to four mothers in the AN group and six mothers in 
the COMP group. Two other women in the COMP group 
were missing in the SMBR, one had not yet given birth at 
the time the register data were obtained and one was missing 
for unknown reasons.

Results

Reproduction and clinical characteristics 
of the mothers

Among  the  women  in  the  AN  and  COMP  group,  83% 
(n = 40) in each group had given birth to at least one child 
(range: AN, 1–5; COMP, 1–4). At the time of assessment, 
the children in the AN group were between 0–25 years old 
(mean age = 13.3, SD: 6.0), and the children in the COMP 
group were between 0–24 years old (mean age = 12.2, SD: 
4.9). Table 1 shows demographic and clinical characteris-
tics including reproductive data for the mothers in the AN 
and COMP groups. In the AN group two women still had 
AN during pregnancy (one of them had AN during two 

The children’s mean birth weight was lower in the AN than 
in the COMP group. Birth length and ponderal index were 
significantly  lower  and  head  circumference  was  signifi-
cantly smaller in the AN group than in the COMP group 
(p < 0.05 in all instances). The Apgar scores did not differ 
between the groups (Table 2). Five and four preterm deliv-
eries were observed in the AN and COMP group, respec-
tively (p = 0.88). One perinatal death had occurred in the 
AN group.

Early developmental problems, age 0–4 years

The age distribution of the offspring in the AN group and the 
COMP group is shown in Fig. 2. Ten children of six moth-
ers in the AN group, and six children of five mothers in the 
COMP group were included in the brief interview concern-
ing early development. No significant differences regard-
ing regulatory problems (sleep/colic/selective eating) were 
found in the AN group compared to the COMP group (AN: 
N = 5; COMP: N = 2; p = 0.63).

General psychopathology in the offspring (SDQ), 
ages 2–17 years

The results of the SDQ showed no significant differences 
between  the  groups  with  respect  to  the  total  score  (AN 
group offspring mean 6.6 (95% CI: 4.5; 8.6); COMP group 
offspring mean 7.2 (95% CI: 5.3; 9.0), p = 0.66). The per-
centage of children rated above the cut-off score for each 
subscale, in the AN and COMP group respectively, was; 
emotional problems: 12.8% vs. 7.4%; conduct problems; 
8.5% vs. 8.8%; hyperactivity: 6.4% vs. 14.7%; peer prob-
lems: 17.0% vs. 8.8%; prosocial behavior: 10.6% vs. 13.2%; 
total difficulties: 14.9% vs. 11.8% (all differences non-sig-
nificant). The mean age of the children participating in the 
SDQ assessment did not differ across groups (AN group: 
11.1, SD: 4.4; COMP group: 11.1, SD: 3.5 years).

Psychiatric diagnoses in the offspring (DAWBA, 
MINI, SCID‑I ED module), ages 5–25 years

The results from the diagnostic interviews are shown in 
Table 3. The mean age of the participating children in the 
AN group was significantly higher than in the COMP group 
(AN group: 14.8 years (SD: 5.0); COMP group: 13.2 years

(SD: 4.3), p = 0.045). Current psychiatric disorders based on 
parental interviews were significantly more common among 
the offspring in the AN group (Table 3). Lifetime psychiat-
ric disorders based on register and interview data combined 
were not significantly overrepresented in the offspring of the 
AN group. Six children in the AN group and one child in the 
COMP group were diagnosed with a lifetime ED (p = 0.061).

BMI and physical health in the offspring

p = 0.17). Endocrine, immune and metabolic diseases were 
much more common among the offspring in the AN than in 
the COMP group (p = 0.002) (Table 4). Four of the endo-
crinological diagnoses related to deviant growth (n = 2) and 
puberty development (n = 2) (Table 4).

Discussion

The majority of the children in both groups were within 
the normal range regarding BMI (Fig. 3). Weight extremes 
(underweight/overweight/obese) were about equally distrib-
uted across groups (25% in AN group; 15% in COMP group, 

This prospective controlled community-based 30-year fol-
low-up study of adolescent-onset AN aimed at examining 
perinatal status, psychiatric and physical health in the off-
spring of mothers with a history of AN. In addition, perina-
tal status of the children was investigated. At least some data

second row shows the number of offspring interviews performed and 

the  third  row  shows  the  number  of  offspring  found  in  The  Swedish 
National  Patient  Register.  For  ethical  reasons,  no  register  data  were

the overlap and source distribution of the total offspring sample in the

were available on 90.2% of the offspring in the AN group 
and all of the offspring in the COMP group. Birth weight 
and length, head circumference and ponderal index were sig-
nificantly reduced in the offspring of the mothers in the AN 
group. After the perinatal period, BMI did not differ between 
the children in the AN and COMP groups. Parental inter-
views (DAWBA, MINI) indicated a higher prevalence of 
current psychiatric disorders among the offspring of mothers 
with a history of AN. The SDQ assessment did however not 

confirm the presence of more psychiatric symptoms among 
the children in the AN group. Furthermore, an overrepresen-
tation of endocrinological, immune and metabolic disorders 
was observed among the offspring in the AN group.

As  we  had  hypothesized,  offspring  in  the  AN  group 
exhibited worse perinatal outcomes (lower birth weight and 
length, lower ponderal index and smaller head circumfer-
ence) compared with offspring in the COMP group. This 
finding is consistent with other studies in terms of lower

Psychiatric  disorders  are  based  on  the  results  from  the  diagnostic  parental  interviews  (DAWBA,  MINI,  ED  module  SCID-I)  regarding  off-
spring,  5–25  years  old.  Lifetime  psychiatric  disorders,  including  neurodevelopmental  disorders,  are  based  on  the  interviews  (MINI,  DAWBA 
and  ADHD-RS)  combined  with  retrospective  data  from  the  Swedish  national  patient  register  concerning  offspring  0–25  years  old.  Affective 
disorders included major depression and bipolar disorder. Anxiety disorders included panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia, 
obsessive–compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety and general anxiety disorder. P values ≤ 0.05 in bold

birth weight and smaller head circumference [8, 14]. We 
did not find an elevated risk of preterm birth or lower Apgar 
scores in the AN group, which is in agreement with some 
other reports [15, 51]. The observed reduced birth size in 
the offspring signals that children of mothers with lifetime 
AN constitute a risk group for a worse perinatal outcome. 
Stringer and Furber emphazise the importance that midwifes 
identify women with ED early in pregnancy and tailor inter-
ventions appropriately [52]. We suggest that maternity care 
routines to identify women with ongoing or previous ED 
should be established.

Moreover, we had hypothesized that the offspring in the 
AN group would be at an increased risk of developing psy-
chiatric disorders throughout childhood. Current psychiatric 
symptoms were not more common in the offspring in the 
AN group compared with the offspring in the COMP group, 
using the SDQ. This is in line with findings by Stein et al.

[26]. On the other hand, Micali et al. [23] and Barona et al. 
[24], who also used the SDQ, found an increased preva-
lence of emotional and conduct disorders in the offspring of 
mothers with a history of AN. These two studies comprised 
larger samples than the present study, and we cannot exclude 
the possibility that our results are due to our sample being 
underpowered.

The diagnostic interviews concerning current psychiatric 
disorders in the offspring indicated that psychiatric disor-
ders in general were overrepresented among the offspring 
in the AN group. The results are consistent with findings by 
Micali and colleagues [23], showing an overrepresentation 
of emotional disorders, including anxiety disorders, among 
children of mothers with EDs. Ten percent of the offspring 
in the AN group fulfilled the criteria for an anxiety disorder, 
although the difference failed to reach statistical significance 
compared with 1.4% of the offspring of the COMP group.

feeding and eating patterns. Stein and colleagues found that 
during mealtime interactions between mothers with EDs and 
their children, the mothers expressed more intrusive behav-
iors and negative emotions towards the infant compared with 
the interaction between healthy control mothers and their 
offspring [32]. Our sample was too small to investigate the 
impact of environmental factors and the mediation of gene 
expression.

We observed a much higher prevalence of endocrinologi-
cal, immune and metabolic diseases among the offspring in 
the AN group. The results need to be replicated using larger 
samples. The findings are, however, in line with previous 
reports of an association between EDs and various autoim-
mune disorders [57, 58]. Furthermore, recent findings have 
indicated that parental mental illness is associated with an 
elevated risk of autoimmune diseases in the offspring [59]. 
In addition, eating disorders have been linked to Paediat-
ric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) as one 
defining feature of some cases with sudden onset of eating 
restrictions [60]. In individuals with PANS a family history 
of inflammatory or autoimmune diseases has been reported 
to be common [61]. Contrary to our expectations, we found 
no support for impaired growth after the perinatal period in 
the children born to mothers with a history of AN. Although 
the ponderal index was lower at birth among the offspring in 
the AN group, the majority of these children had a normal 
BMI later on.

Strengths and limitations

This is the only study that has followed a group of individu-
als with adolescent-onset AN prospectively, along with a 
matched comparison group, for as long as 30 years. The 
sample is community-based and half of the AN cases con-
stituted a total birth cohort. The individuals have been exam-
ined on five occasions after their onset of AN. Some larger 
cohort studies examining psychiatric health in the offspring 
of mothers with ED have relied on parental questionnaires 
when studying the offspring’s development e.g. [24]. Our 
group has, however, interviewed the mothers in person using 
a semi-structured interview, and therefore the interview data 
can be considered as reliable [62]. The parental interviews 
resulted in psychiatric diagnoses in the children according 
to the DSM-IV, the DSM-5 and the ICD-10. Having access 
to register data enabled us to obtain complementary infor-
mation regarding the children. By combining different data 
sources we obtained at least some information on physical 
and mental health concerning 90.2% and 100% of the off-
spring in the AN and COMP group, respectively. The perina-
tal data covered 88% and 79% of the children in the AN and 
COMP group, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first study examining several aspects of health, 

Fig. 3   Box  plot  of  the  body  mass  index  in  the  offspring  of  the  AN 
(N = 59) and the COMP group (N = 76), 5–25 years old

Extending the groups to include offspring of all ages (com-
bining register data with interview data), lifetime psychiat-
ric disorders did not differ between the AN and the COMP 
group.

There was a discrepancy between the diagnostic inter-
view results (DAWBA, MINI) and the SDQ data. The for-
mer showed an overrepresentation of current psychiatric 
disorders among the offspring of the AN group, while the 
latter did not signal more psychiatric symptoms among the 
children in the AN group. The difference could reflect the 
different age ranges of the children involved in the question-
naires versus the interviews; the children rated with the SDQ 
were younger (mean age: 11.1, age range: 2–17 years) than 
the offspring in the diagnostic interviews (AN group mean 
age: 14.8, range: 5–25 years; COMP group mean age: 13.2, 
range: 5–24 years).

In our sample, six children in the AN group and one 
adolescent  in  the  COMP  group  were  diagnosed  with  a 
lifetime ED, the difference was not statistically significant 
(p = 0.061). An overrepresentation of EDs among the off-
spring  of  mothers  with  AN  has  been  observed  by  other 
groups [28,  53]. Our sample included children in a wide 
range of ages and a considerable minority of the children in 
the present study had not yet reached puberty, when the onset 
of AN and other EDs usually takes place [54]. Although 
EDs have a genetic component explaining the likelihood 
of a higher prevalence of EDs in children of mothers with 
EDs, environmental factors have been put forward as cru-
cial mediators in the expression of underlying predisposition 
[55]. For instance, nutritional intake during pregnancy may 
influence the DNA methylation in genes related to growth, 
metabolism and appetite regulation [56]. Further, the litera-
ture implies that a parent with ED impacts on her/his child’s

Data regarding physical disorders are mainly based on information from the Swedish national patient register (NPR) (registered offspring: AN; 
n = 59; COMP; n = 57). Data concerning offspring not found in the NPR (above age 18; AN; n = 18, COMP; n = 12, missing data; AN; n = 5) are 
based on interview results collected at the time of examination of the mothers
AN Anorexia nervosa, COMP Comparison
a One participant had two conditions; hypothyroidism and disorders of puberty, not elsewhere classified
b Including chromosome disorder (n = 1), septal defect (n = 3), plagiocephaly
(n = 1), congenital malformation of face and neck (n = 1)
c Congenital deformities of hip (n = 2)
Excluded diagnoses: tonsillitis, flu, conditions of the respiratory tract (e. g. acute laryngitis, acute bronchitis), unspecified virus infections, acute 
appendicitis, gastroenteritis, minor malformations (e.g. prominent ear)

including perinatal status, psychiatric and somatic morbid-
ity, in the offspring of mothers with a history of AN.

The current study has some obvious limitations. The sam-
ple size was relatively small, which is in contrast to some 
larger register-based studies that have been performed in 
this area [22, 24, 25]. The small sample size also prevented 
us from performing gender-stratified analyses. This must be 

considered a limitation since a previous study found gen-
der differences between children when parents with EDs 
completed the SDQ [24]. The children were not examined 
by the researchers. Instead, we had to rely on the paren-
tal reports using established and well-validated interviews. 
Although parent reported weight and height can be consid-
ered reasonably accurate regarding children [63], reports of

anthropometric measures in adolescent and adult offspring 
might be less reliable. In order to gain further information, 
personal assessments of the offspring would have been valu-
able. Regarding the diagnostic interviews, the offspring in 
the COMP group were significantly younger than the off-
spring in the AN group. The children in the former group 
had therefore had less time to develop psychiatric disorders, 
including EDs, than the children in the latter group. Another 
limitation was the wide age range of the offspring groups 
(from newborn to young adulthood). Further, we had no 
access to information on psychiatric history of the children’s 
fathers which limits our understanding of the familial trans-
mission. The phenomenon of nonrandom mating patterns, 
both within and across psychiatric disorders, might addition-
ally increase the risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring of 
women with a history of AN as suggested by Nordsletten 
et al. [64]. Adopted and stepchildren were not included in the 
study. Due to the small number of adopted children (n = 1), 
gene-environment interactions could not be investigated.

An additional limitation is that we did not correct for mul-
tiple comparison, which increases the risk of type I errors 
(finding significant results by chance when performing many 
tests). In order not to miss any potential association we did 
not adjust for multiple comparisons. Our sample was small, 
but a larger sample was not possible to collect and therefore 
the results and conclusions have to be treated as exploratory.

Conclusions

Our findings confirmed that children of mothers with AN 
constitute a risk group for worse perinatal outcome. Later 
on, in childhood, there were few differences regarding psy-
chiatric health between the children in the AN group and 
the children in the COMP group. However, there was an 
overrepresentation of current psychiatric disorders among 
the offspring in the AN group. To our knowledge, this is the 
first time that an increased prevalence of endocrinological, 
immune, and metabolic disorders was observed in the off-
spring of women with a history of AN. Clinically, in mater-
nity care, we suggest that women should be screened for 
current or previous AN. Women who screen positive for cur-
rent or previous AN require special consideration in order to 
reduce negative birth outcomes. In addition, clinicians treat-
ing AN patients should be aware that the offspring might 
have an elevated risk of psychiatric and physical morbidity.
