ABSTRACT
Objective  This study aims to conduct an overview on the 
comparative efficacy of valproate in acute mania, bipolar 
depression and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder 
(BD).
Method  We performed an overview of systematic reviews 
with meta- analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 
registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024497749). We searched 
Medline and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 
Summary measures comparing valproate with placebo or 
other active drugs were described.
Results  We included 26 systematic reviews. For 
acute mania (31 RCTs, n=4376), valproate showed a 
significantly better response than placebo in two high- 
quality systematic reviews (RR=1.42; 95% CI: 1.19 to 
1.71) (OR=2.05; 95% CI: 1.32 to 3.20). No significant 
differences with lithium were found in most outcomes. 
Valproate had similar efficacy to quetiapine and lower 
efficacy compared with risperidone, with conflicting 
results when compared with olanzapine. In bipolar 
depression (7 RCTs, n=399), valproate was more effective 
than placebo in reducing depressive symptoms (OR=2.80; 
95% CI: 1.26 to 6.18) and achieving remission (OR=2.4; 
95% CI: 1.09 to 5.29) (OR=2.15; 95% CI: 0.82 to 5.6), 
considering the results of three high- quality systematic 
reviews. No significant difference was observed with 
lithium, lurasidone, quetiapine or olanzapine plus 
fluoxetine, but valproate showed superior efficacy to 
aripiprazole, ziprasidone and agomelatine. In maintenance 
treatment (11 RCTs, n=1063), valproate was superior to 
placebo in preventing relapse of any mood episode in 
two high- quality systematic reviews (RR=0.63; 95% CI: 
0.48 to 0.83) (RR=0.63; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.83). No 
significant difference was found with lithium, olanzapine 
or lamotrigine.
Conclusion  This overview highlights favourable results 
for valproate compared with placebo in all phases of 
BD, as well as presenting specific results in comparison 
with other active drugs. However, these results must be 
interpreted considering the methodological limitations of 
our study.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ This  study  provides  a  comprehensive  overview  of 
systematic  reviews  with  meta- analysis  on  the  ef-
ficacy of valproate in treating acute mania, bipolar 
depression  and  maintenance  therapy  for  bipolar 
disorder.

 ⇒ This  study  is  the  first  overview  of  systematic  re-
views  with  meta- analyses  specifically  designed  to 
evaluate the effect of valproate in the treatment of 
bipolar  disorder,  including  open- label,  single- blind 
and double- blind randomised controlled trials.
 ⇒ This overview assessed the quality of evidence from 
published  systematic  reviews  and  meta- analyses 
on the efficacy of valproate in bipolar disorder, cat-
egorising each review into levels of high, moderate, 
low and critically low confidence.

 ⇒ Due to the limited number of randomised controlled 
trials  assessing  the  comparative  efficacy  of  val-
proate  in  bipolar  disorder,  the  results  of  this  over-
view are dependent on a small number of primary 
studies.

 ⇒ This study aims to extract and analyse the evidence 
regarding the efficacy of valproate in bipolar disor-
der, without summarising or aggregating the results 
into new meta- analytic measures.

INTRODUCTION
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a psychiatric condi-
tion  in  which  individuals  experience  severe 
mood  changes,  swings  or  fluctuations,  and 
sometimes, psychotic features.1 2 The lifetime 
prevalence of bipolar spectrum disorders was 
estimated  at  0.6%  for  bipolar  type  1,  0.4% 
for  bipolar  type  2  and  2.4%  for  the  entire 
spectrum, including subthreshold BD.3 Indi-
viduals  with  BD  may  exhibit  persistent  func-
tional and cognitive impairments, leading to 
substantial decline in their overall quality of 
life and contributing to societal harms.4 5 The 
impact of BD is long- lasting and wide- ranging,

affecting  not  only  mental  and  physical  health  but  also 
the  social  and  occupational  aspects  of  an  individual’s 
life.6  7  The  WHO  highlights  that  BD  ranks  among  the 
major  mental  health  contributors  to  global  disability, 
primarily due to its impact on a young and economically 
active population.8 9 Besides, the frequent delay in diag-
nosis and initiation of appropriate treatment contributes 
to the worsening course of the disease.10

The treatment of BD is primarily pharmacological and 
should be tailored to each phase of the disorder: mania/
hypomania, depression or maintenance. Mood stabilisers 
such  as  lithium,  valproate  and  lamotrigine,  along  with 
second- generation  antipsychotics,  are  considered  the 
drugs  of  choice  by  major  guidelines.11  12  The  treatment 
goal  is  to  alleviate  current  symptoms  and  prevent  new 
episodes. A common challenge is the low patient adher-
ence  to  treatment,  especially,  during  manic  episodes 
when  insight  into  the  illness  is  compromised.  Some 
studies attempt to compare the effects of various drugs in 
BD management, and their findings indicate that mood 
stabilisers,  particularly,  valproate  and  lithium,  play  a 
crucial role in treatment of BD.13

In the 1960s, the use of valproate emerged as a prom-
ising  treatment  for  BD.  Researchers  in  Europe  and  the 
USA studied the mood- stabilising effects of valproate for 
three decades, initially using valproic acid and its deriva-
tives, such as valpromide, and later, in the 1980s, transi-
tioning to sodium divalproate.14 15 The Canadian Network 
for Mood and Anxiety Treatments and the International 
Society  for  Bipolar  Disorders  have  established  in  their 
guidelines that valproate is a first- line treatment for acute 
mania  and  maintenance  treatment,  and  a  second- line 
treatment  for  bipolar  depression.16  Despite  a  vast  litera-
ture  demonstrating  the  efficacy  of  valproate  in  treating 
BD,17–20  numerous  studies  show  conflicting  results. 
Previous evidence suggested that valproate might be less 
effective than lithium in the treatment of acute mania.21 22 
However, recent network meta- analyses (NMAs) have not 
confirmed this finding23 nor have they corroborated the 
inferiority  of  valproate  in  bipolar  depression19  and  the 
maintenance  treatment.24  Furthermore,  comparisons 
regarding the efficacy of valproate vs antipsychotics also 
show conflicting results.21 23 25

To address the conflicting evidence regarding the effi-
cacy  of  valproate  in  treating  BD,  both  in  comparison 
to  placebo  and  active  drugs,  this  study  aims  to  conduct 
an  overview  that  synthesises  and  discusses  the  primary 
findings  of  systematic  reviews  with  meta- analyses  on  the 
comparative efficacy of valproate in treating acute mania, 
bipolar depression and maintenance therapy for BD.

METHODS
This  study  was  conducted  following  the  Cochrane 
Method  for  Overviews  of  Reviews26  and  we  adhered  to 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta- Analyses  (PRISMA)  2020  guidelines.27  We  defined 
a systematic review, based on Cochrane’s definition, as a 

2

comprehensive analysis of literature involving identifying, 
assessing and synthesising all relevant empirical evidence 
that  meets  predetermined  eligibility  criteria  to  address 
a  specific  research  question.  By  employing  explicit  and 
systematic methods aimed at reducing bias, the systematic 
review aims to produce reliable findings that can inform 
decision- making processes.28

The  search  was  systematically  conducted  in  Medline 
(PubMed)  and  the  Cochrane  Database  of  Systematic 
Reviews (CDSR) from their inception through 15 January 
2024,  considering  the  following  general  terms:  ‘Bipolar 
Disorder,’  ‘Valproic  Acid’,  ‘Valproate’,  ‘Divalproex’  and 
‘Systematic Review’. We used a search term specific to the 
systematic review study design, aligning with Cochrane’s 
recommendations  for  overviews.26  Furthermore,  the 
general terms were expanded through synonym searches. 
There  were  no  restrictions  on  publication  date  or 
language.  We  also  conducted  a  manual  examination  of 
the reference lists of identified articles to ensure the inclu-
sion of other reviews that might be eligible. The complete 
search strategy and the PRISMA 2020 Checklist are avail-
able in the online supplemental materials I and II.

We  included  systematic  reviews  of  open- label,  single- 
blinded  or  double- blinded  randomised  controlled  trials 
(RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of valproate in treating BD 
and comparing it to placebo or other active drugs. We only 
considered systematic reviews with meta- analysis, whether 
pairwise or NMAs. We excluded non- systematic literature 
reviews, reviews of materials that do not constitute orig-
inal research, such as systematic reviews of guidelines, and 
reviews solely focused on the economic evaluation of medi-
cations. We also excluded (1) reviews lacking diagnostic 
confirmation  of  BD  through  the  Diagnostic  and  Statis-
tical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  or  International  Clas-
sification of Diseases criteria; (2) reviews that exclusively 
focused  on  specific  populations  (children,  adolescents, 
pregnant  women  or  postpartum  women)  or  outcomes; 
(3)  reviews  that  encompassed  populations  with  BD  and 
psychiatric  comorbidities,  such  as  Substance  Use  Disor-
ders,  Anxiety  Disorders,  Obsessive- Compulsive  Disorder, 
Neurocognitive  Disorders  and  Suicide;  (4)  reviews  that 
exclusively  focused  on  adverse  effects  of  valproate;  (5) 
reviews  that  compared  valproate  with  electroconvulsive 
therapy  or  psychotherapeutic  interventions;  (6)  reviews 
on treatment guidelines for BD; (7) reviews that did not 
specifically  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  valproate  in  BD;  (8) 
systematic reviews that included preclinical trials; and (9) 
no direct comparisons between valproate and other drugs 
at the metanalytical estimates.

The  studies’  selection  was  carried  out  in  two  stages: 
screening  phase  (title  and  abstracts  reading)  and  eligi-
bility  phase  (full  article  reading).  Two  investigators 
(JJM  and  DPB)  executed  the  stages  independently;  in 
case  of  inconsistencies,  a  discussion  involving  a  third 
analyst (NRS) was conducted to reach a consensus. After 
completing  the  study  selection,  two  authors  (JJM  and 
DPB)  independently  extracted  data  from  the  systematic 
reviews  and  any  discrepancies  were  carefully  reviewed

by a third author (NRS). We extracted the first author’s 
name,  year  of  publication,  identification  of  the  RCTs 
included  in  the  review,  number  of  individuals  included 
in  each  head- to- head  comparison,  main  findings,  and, 
if  available,  type  of  meta- analysis  (pairwise  or  network 
meta- analysis) and meta- analytical estimates (effect sizes 
and  measures  of  dispersion  intervals).  The  OR,  rela-
tive  risk  (RR),  mean  difference  (MD)  and  standardised 
mean  difference  (SMD)  were  considered  as  effect  size 
measures.  As  for  measures  of  dispersion,  we  considered 
95% CIs or 95% credibility intervals (95% CrI). Addition-
ally, the efficacy definitions from the included systematic 
reviews were analysed. The term ‘valproate’ was employed 
in  a  generic  sense,  encompassing  any  form  of  valproate 
including valproic acid or divalproex.

We used the AMSTAR- 2 (a measurement tool to assess 
systematic reviews- version 2) to assess the methodological 
quality of the systematic reviews included in this overview. 
AMSTAR- 2 is a practical critical appraisal tool specifically 
designed for rapid assessments of the quality of conduct 
of  systematic  reviews  of  RCTs  involving  interventions.29 
It  categorises  the  certainty  of  the  evidence  as  high, 
moderate,  low  or  critically  low.  One  investigator  (DPB) 
applied this tool, and the results were discussed with two 
additional  investigators  (JJM  and  NRS).  We  emphasise 
that  AMSTAR- 2  is  a  fundamental  tool  in  conducting  an 
overview  of  reviews;  however,  it  does  not  assess  the  risk 
of  bias  of  the  included  RCTs  nor  the  confidence  in  the 
evidence of the included reviews. We emphasised that in 
our  overview,  all  identified  studies  were  presented  and 
discussed in the article, regardless of each study’s level of 
evidence. However, our final conclusions were primarily 
based on the findings from high- quality studies.

Additionally,  we  evaluated  the  overlap  of  primary 
studies  included  in  each  drug  comparison  by  calcu-
lating  the  corrected  covered  areas  (CCA).30  CCA  values 
exceeding  11%  indicate  a  high  overlap  of  RCTs  among 
the systematic reviews included in the respective compar-
ison.  This  study  was  registered  with  PROSPERO  (Inter-
national  prospective  register  of  systematic  reviews),31 
number CRD42024497749.

Patient and public involvement
This study is based exclusively on existing literature and does 
not involve direct patient engagement. None of the authors 
or  contributors  to  the  manuscript  are  individuals  with  BD. 
The dissemination of findings will focus on engaging the clin-
ical  community,  including  presentations  at  internationally 
recognised scientific conferences to connect with clinicians 
involved  in  BD  treatment.  This  will  allow  for  discussion  of 
the findings and their potential clinical implications. Addi-
tionally, the results will be shared with advocacy groups both 
in Brazil and internationally. Any author of this paper may 
participate in events aimed at educating patients and care-
givers. Social media will be used to communicate the findings 
using visually appealing and concise language. The Brazilian 
Practical Psychopharmacology platform, which includes over 
5000 psychiatrists, will be leveraged to share these findings 
and contribute to improving bipolar disorder treatment.

RESULTS
The study selection process is shown in figure 1. Initially, 
we screened 188 records in total including 182 from the 
search strategy on the databases and six additional system-
atic  reviews  that  were  identified  via  citation  searching:

one through backward search and five through forward 
search  strategies.17  19  25  32–34  From  this  total  screening,  it 
was  selected  39  systematic  reviews  for  full- text  reading. 
Finally,  we  retained  26  articles  for  inclusion,  encom-
passing 50 RCTs, with publication years ranging from 1996 
to 2023. The list of included and excluded articles during 
full- text screening, along with the corresponding reasons 
for exclusion can be found in online supplemental mate-
rial III. We did not find any systematic review with specific 
meta- analysis on the effect of valproate on mixed state or 
rapid cycling that met our eligibility criteria.

The complete results of our overview are described at 
the  online  supplemental  table  S1  to  S6,  and  the  list  of 
included RCTs is presented in online supplemental mate-
rial  IV.  To  summarise  the  key  findings  and  present  the 
results concisely, table 1 (acute mania treatment), table 2 
(bipolar  depression  treatment)  and  table  3  (mainte-
nance treatment in BD) exclusively present comparisons 
between valproate and other FDA- approved medications 
for  BD  treatment,  as  well  as  with  placebo.  Additionally, 
since combinations of valproate with other active drug do 
not allow us to accurately isolate the effect of valproate on 
treatment efficacy in BD, we have decided not to discuss 
such results in the manuscript; however, we have retained 
them  in  the  online  supplemental  table  S1  to  S6.  In  the 
summarised  tables,  we  also  excluded  indirect  evidence 
from NMAs to ensure a more concise presentation of the 
data.  The  assessment  of  methodological  quality  of  the 
included reviews using the AMSTAR- 2 tool, and the esti-
mation of overlap of RCTs in each drug comparison, are 
both provided in online supplemental material V and VI, 
respectively.

Among  the  included  systematic  reviews,  11  assessed 
the efficacy of valproate in managing acute mania, while 
seven evaluated its effectiveness in bipolar depression and 
nine in maintenance treatment of BD. The average dura-
tion of the included RCTs in acute mania, bipolar depres-
sion and maintenance treatment was 7.51, 9.25, and 66.22 
weeks, respectively.

Valproate in acute mania
11 reviews included in our analysis evaluated the compar-
ative  efficacy  of  valproate  in  treating  acute  mania, 
involving a total of 31 RCTs and 4376 participants. These 
reviews  encompassed  direct  comparisons  of  valproate 
monotherapy  with  placebo,  lithium,  carbamazepine, 
olanzapine,  quetiapine  and  risperidone  (table  1).  Addi-
tionally,  they  featured  direct  comparisons  of  valproate 
vs  oxcarbazepine,  topiramate,  haloperidol  and  endox-
ifen  (online  supplemental  table  S1).  We  also  identified 
statistically  significant  indirect  evidence  from  NMAs 
comparing  valproate  with  other  active  drugs,  such  as 
paliperidone and cariprazine (online supplemental table 
S2). Considering FDA- approved drugs for the treatment 
of acute mania, apart from some comparisons mentioned 
above,  direct  evidence  comparing  valproate  to  aripipra-
zole, asenapine and ziprasidone was not found. However, 
indirect evidence from NMAs did not show a significant 

4

difference between valproate and aripiprazole (RR=0.93, 
95% CrI: 0.74, 1.16),35 (MD=1.50, 95% CrI: −0.43, 3.34),23 
asenapine  (RR=1.12,  95%  CrI:  0.86,  1.44),35  (MD=0.82, 
95%  CrI:  −1.38,  2.96)23  and  ziprasidone  (RR=1.05,  95% 
CrI: 0.78, 1.42),35 (MD=2.55, 95% CrI: −0.33, 5.37).23

Eight studies compared valproate vs placebo,17 21 23 25 34–37 
with  only  two  of  them  considered  to  be  of  high- quality 
systematic review according to the AMSTAR- 2.21 35 These 
studies comprised the findings of seven trials,38–44 exhib-
iting  a  very  high  overlap  of  RCTs  (CCA=42.8%).  For 
treating  acute  mania,  valproate  has  been  shown  to  be 
more effective than placebo across all efficacy outcomes, 
as detailed in table 1. The exception occurred with data 
from Kishi and colleagues (2021), where valproate did not 
demonstrate statistical superiority compared with placebo 
in clinical remission (RR=1.25, 95% CrI: 0.98–1.59).35

valproate 

compared 

Seven  meta- analyses 

to 
lithium,21–23 25 35–37 with three regarded as high AMSTAR- 2 
standard.25 35 37  These  studies  comprised  the  findings  of 
seven  RCTs,39  45–50  showing  a  very  high  overlap  of  RCTs 
(CCA=26.2%).  No  significant  differences  were  found 
between valproate and lithium in most efficacy outcomes, 
as detailed in table 1, except for two reviews that showed 
valproate  to  be  less  effective  than  lithium  in  achieving 
clinical remission (OR 1.75, 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.94)22; (OR 
0.69, 95% CI: 0.14 to 1.25).21

Four  systematic  reviews  with  meta- analyses  compared 
valproate  with  carbamazepine  in  acute  mania21  25  36  37 
considering data from two clinical trials,46 51 thus, exhib-
iting a very high overlap of primary studies (CCA=50%). 
Two  recent  NMAs  showed  that  valproate  was  less  effec-
tive  than  carbamazepine  in  reducing  mania  symptoms 
(MD=3.23, 95% CrI: 0.51–5.93),23 (SMD=0.36, 95% CrI: 
0.06–0.67),35 while a third NMA and two pairwise meta- 
analyses  found  no  significant  difference  between  these 
drugs (SMD=−0.12, 95% CrI: −0.42, +0.22),25 (OR=2.41, 
95% CI: 0.52 to 11.1),21 (RR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.38 to 1.16)37 
(table 1). Not surprisingly, when oxcarbazepine, a struc-
tural  derivative  of  carbamazepine,  was  compared  with 
valproate in the treatment of acute mania, no significant 
difference  in  effectiveness  was  found  (MD=−0.12,  95% 
CrI: −4.40, 4.12),23 (MD = +0.02, 95% CrI: −0.60, 0.65),25 
(OR=2.27,  95% CI:  0.51,  10.0),51  (OR=2.25,  95% CI: 
0.51  to  9.99)21  (online  supplemental  table  S1).  When 
compared with topiramate, two NMAs demonstrated that 
valproate  was  more  effective  in  improving  mania  symp-
toms (MD=−3.78, 95% CrI: −6.28 to –1.36),23 (SMD=−0.31, 
95%  CrI:  −0.55  to  –0.08),35  and  reducing  the  treatment 
discontinuation  due  to  inefficacy  (RR=0.51,  95%  CrI: 
0.30, 0.79)35 (online supplemental table S1).

Six  reviews  compared  valproate  to  olanzapine  in  the 
management of acute mania,21 23 25 35–37 using data from 
four RCTs,41 52–54 revealing a very high overlap of primary 
studies (CCA=70%). Three reviews found no significant 
difference between these drugs in reducing mania symp-
toms  (RR=0.90,  95%  CrI:  0.75,  1.07),35  (SMD=−0.16, 
95% CrI: −0.34, 0.04),25 (OR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.25)21; 
however,  three  other  reviews  showed  the  inferiority  of

Non- significant

Valproate was used as a common term representing other forms of valproate as valproic acid and divalproex.
CCA, corrected covered area; db, double- blind; ES, effect size; NMA, network meta- analysis; PW- MA, pairwise meta- analysis; RCTs, randomised 
controlled trials; RR, relative risk; SMD, standardised mean differences.

valproate compared with olanzapine (MD=2.21, 95% CrI: 
0.54, 3.84),23 (MD=2.81, 95% CI: 0.83, 4.79),37 (RR=0.76, 
95% CI:  0.58,  0.99).36  Furthermore,  three  meta- analyses 
found  no  difference  in  the  efficacy  of  these  drugs 
regarding  the  risk  of  treatment  discontinuation  due  to 
inefficacy  (RR=1.24,  95%  CrI:  0.91,  1.69),35  (RR=1.12, 
95% CI:  0.66,  1.89),36  (RR=1.08,  95%  CrI:  0.50,  2.36),37 
and one study showed that valproate was less effective in 
changing  symptom  severity  after  3  weeks  of  treatment 
(SMD=0.25, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.39).21

Four  pairwise  systematic  reviews21  36  37  55  and  three 
NMAs23 25 35 compared the effect of valproate vs haloper-
idol in acute mania; however, all these studies were based 
on a single RCT with 36 participants56 (table 1). All pair-
wise  systematic  reviews  yielded  no  differences  between 
valproate  and  haloperidol  in  terms  of  efficacy  in  acute 
mania (OR=1.82, 95% CI: 0.46, 7.18),21 (RR=1.43, 95% CI: 
0.61, 3.32),36 (RR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.35).37 55 However, 
the results of the NMAs were conflicting, which could be 
explained by the inclusion of different indirect evidence 
in  their  outcomes  (Table  S2).  Kishi  et  al24  and  Hong  et 
al23  demonstrated  that  valproate  was  less  effective  than 
haloperidol  in  reducing  manic  symptoms  (SMD=0.39, 
95% CrI: 0.19, 0.59)35 (MD=2.52, 95% CrI: 0.47, 4.48),23 
and led to higher rates of treatment discontinuation due 

to inefficacy (RR=1.59, 95% CrI: 1.12, 2.28).35 However, 
Yildiz et al (2015) found no significant difference between 
these drugs (SMD=−0.22, 95% CrI: −0.43, 0.02)25 (table 1).
Three  NMAs  showed  that  valproate  was  less  effective 
than risperidone in managing manic symptoms with direct 
comparisons (MD=3.79, 95% CrI: 1.66, 5.93)23 (table 1), 
and  indirect  comparisons  (SMD=0.38,  95%  CrI:  0.16, 
0.60)35 (online supplemental table S1), (SMD=−0.33, 95% 
CrI:  −0.58  to  –0.66)25  (online  supplemental  table  S1). 
One  NMA  showed  non- significant  difference  between 
valproate  and  quetiapine  (MD=1.45,  95%  CrI:  −0.55, 
3.40)23 (table 1). Online supplemental table S1 provides 
a  comparison  of  the  efficacy  of  valproate  against  other 
less used medications in addressing BD.

Valproate in bipolar depression
Seven  reviews  included  in  our  analysis  assessed  the 
comparative  efficacy  of  valproate  in  bipolar  depression, 
involving  7  RCTs  and  399  participants.  These  reviews 
encompassed direct comparisons only of valproate mono-
therapy with placebo (table 2). We also identified statisti-
cally significant indirect evidence from NMAs comparing 
valproate  and  aripiprazole,  ziprasidone,  agomelatine, 
levetiracetam,  valproate  plus  memantine,  valproate 
plus  cytidine,  valproate  plus  olanzapine  and  sertraline

plus  lithium  (online  supplemental  table  S4).  No  FDA- 
approved drug for treating bipolar depression was directly 
compared with valproate, and no indirect evidence from 
NMAs  showed  significant  differences  between  valproate 
and  lurasidone  (OR=1.58,  95%  CrI:  0.68,  3.47),19  queti-
apine  (OR=1.54,  95%  CrI:  0.68,  3.47)19  or  olanzapine 
plus fluoxetine (OR=1.13, 95% CrI: 0.47, 2.70)19 (online 
supplemental table S4).

Six  studies  compared  valproate  vs  placebo,17–19  57–59 
of  which  two  were  considered  high- quality  systematic 
reviews  according  to  AMSTAR- 2.18  19  The  results  of  all 
these reviews were limited to six RCTs, exhibiting a very 
high overlap of RCTs demonstrating high overlap in their 
primary studies (CCA=56.67%). Both high- quality system-
atic reviews demonstrate the superiority of valproate over 
placebo  in  reducing  depressive  symptoms18  19;  however, 
their results were conflicting regarding the reduction in 
the number of participants who achieved clinical remis-
sion (OR=2.15, 95% Crl: 0.82, 5.61),18 (RR=2.15,% 0.60, 
7.74)59 (table 2). No direct comparisons between valproate 
and  lithium  were  found,  and  only  one  NMA  provided 
indirect evidence comparing these drugs, showing a non- 
significant difference between them (OR=2.41, 95% CrI: 
0.99, 5.82)19 (online supplemental table S4).

A pairwise meta- analysis demonstrated that the combi-
nation  of  valproate  and  olanzapine  was  more  effective 
than valproate monotherapy (SMD=−0.31, 95% CrI: −0.58 
to  –0.03),60  although  the  quality  of  the  review  scored 
low  on  the  AMSTAR- 2  (online  supplemental  table  S3). 
Conversely, an NMA showed, through indirect evidence, 
that valproate was superior to aripiprazole (OR=2.73, 95% 
CrI:  1.15,  6.46),  ziprasidone  (OR=2.88,  95%  CrI:  1.25, 
6.65)  and  agomelatine  (OR=2.80,  95%  CrI:  1.10,  7.10) 
in reducing depressive symptoms19 (online supplemental 
table S3). The same study also revealed that the compar-
ison between valproate monotherapy and valproate plus 
memantine indicated the superiority of add- on meman-
tine  over  valproate  monotherapy  in  reducing  acute 
depressive  symptoms  (OR=3.46,  95%  CrI:  1.29,  9.28),19 
although  these  findings  were  based  on  a  single  clinical 
trial.61 Additionally, this review suggested that the combi-
nation  of  valproate  plus  cytidine  did  not  demonstrate 
superiority  over  valproate  alone  in  the  management  of 
bipolar  depression  (OR=3.19,  95%  CrI:  0.66,  15.42)19 
(online  supplemental  table  S3).  Online  supplemental 
tables S3 and S4 also provide additional comparisons of 
the efficacy of valproate against other drugs in addressing 
bipolar depression.

Valproate in maintenance treatment of BD
Nine  included  reviews  assessed  the  comparative  efficacy 
of  valproate  in  BD  maintenance  treatment,  comprising 
a  total  of  11  RCTs  and  1063  participants.  These  reviews 
encompassed  direct  comparisons  of  valproate  mono-
therapy  with  placebo,  lithium,  olanzapine,  valproate 
plus  lithium  and  valproate  plus  aripiprazole  (table  3). 
We  also  found  statistically  significant  indirect  evidence 
from NMAs comparing valproate vs asenapine; valproate 

12

vs  paliperidone,  risperidone,  placebo  and  lamotrigine 
(online  supplemental  table  S6).  Considering  FDA- 
approved  drugs  for  the  maintenance  treatment  of  BD, 
apart  from  some  comparisons  mentioned  above,  we 
did  not  find  direct  comparisons  between  valproate  and 
lamotrigine in monotherapy. However, indirect evidence 
from NMAs did not demonstrate a significant difference 
between  these  drugs  in  reducing  relapse  of  any  mood 
episode (RR=0.83, 95% CrI: 0.60, 1.14).24

Eight 

studies 

reporting  meta- analysis  compared 
valproate  vs  placebo  in  maintenance  treatment.20  24  62–67 
These  reviews  comprised  the  findings  of  five  RCTs,68–72 
with high level of primary studies overlap (CCA=22.5%). 
Three  studies  were  considered  high- quality  systematic 
reviews  according  to  AMSTAR- 2.20  24  62  As  detailed  in 
table 3, two high- quality systematic reviews demonstrated 
the  superiority  of  valproate  over  placebo  in  preventing 
relapse  for  any  mood  episode24  62;  however,  no  differ-
ences  were  found  in  the  rates  of  relapse  of  depressive 
symptoms, and the results regarding the relapse of manic 
episodes were conflicting. Moreover, another high- quality 
systematic review73 also demonstrated that valproate was 
more effective than placebo in reducing the risk of treat-
ment discontinuation due to any mood episode or depres-
sive episodes (table 3). Other five pairwise meta- analyses 
also found superior efficacy of valproate compared with 
placebo in reducing the relapse of any mood episode;63–67 
whereas, only two demonstrated better results to valproate 
in  reducing  the  relapse  rate  of  depressive  episodes.65  66 
No meta- analyses found a significant difference between 
valproate and placebo in preventing manic episodes.

valproate 

compared 

Six  meta- analyses 

with 
lithium,20 24 62 65–67 pooling data from four RCTs,68 74–76 with 
a very high level of overlap of primary studies (CCA=60%). 
Three  studies  were  considered  high- quality  systematic 
reviews according to the AMSTAR- 2,20 24 62 as detailed in 
table  3.  No  included  reviews  found  a  significant  differ-
ence between valproate and lithium in the maintenance 
treatment of BD, considering all efficacy outcomes (rates 
of relapse of any mood episode, depressive episodes, or 
manic, hypomanic, or mixed episodes).

Three  pairwise  meta- analyses,65  66  73  all  based  on  data 
from a single RCT,77 compared the efficacy of valproate vs 
olanzapine, revealing similar efficacy for both treatments 
in  maintenance  treatment  for  BD  (OR=1.02,  95% CI: 
0.32, 3.23),65 (RR=1.33, 95% CI: 0.78, 2.27),73 (OR=1.02, 
95% CI:  0.32,  3.23)66  (table  3).  A  recent  NMA  demon-
strated, through indirect evidence, that valproate was less 
effective  than  asenapine  in  reducing  the  relapse  rates 
of  any  mood  episodes  (RR=2.42,  95%  CrI:  1.16,  5.02)24 
(online  supplemental  table  S6).  Three  high- quality 
systematic  reviews  reported  no  significant  differences 
between  valproate  vs  valproate  plus  lithium  (RR=1.21, 
95% CrI: 0.86, 1.69),24 (RR=1.20, 95% CrI: 0.84, 1.72),62 
(RR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.59),20 and three meta- analyses 
reported  no  significant  differences  between  valproate 
vs  valproate  plus  aripiprazole  (RR=2.17,  95%  CrI:  0.88, 
5.35),24  (RR=2.17,  95%  CrI:  0.86,  5.55),62  (OR=0.37, 

Mari J, et al. BMJ Open 2024;14:e087999. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2024-08799995% CI:  0.12,  1.07)64  (online  supplemental  table  S5). 
Online supplemental table S5 and S6 provides direct and 
indirect  comparison  of  the  efficacy  of  valproate  against 
other drugs in addressing maintenance treatment to BD.

DISCUSSION
The  present  overview  of  systematic  reviews  with  meta- 
analyses further corroborates that valproate is more effec-
tive than a placebo in all phases of BD. Our results align 
the literature supporting the use of valproate in treating 
acute mania. About bipolar depression, the present over-
view shows that valproate is superior to placebo in most 
efficacy outcomes. Furthermore, valproate demonstrates 
comparable  efficacy  to  lithium  in  both  the  treatment 
of  acute  mania  and  maintenance  treatment.  Of  note, 
the  results  for  bipolar  depression  are  limited  to  indi-
rect  evidence  derived  from  NMAs  and  not  from  direct 
comparisons.

Valproate in acute mania
Multiple  studies  consistently  position  valproate  as 
more  effective  than  placebo  across  a  range  of  efficacy 
measures.17  21  23–25  34  36  37  However,  on  meticulous  exam-
ination,  we  found  a  notable  exception  where  valproate 
did  not  exhibit  statistical  differences  compared  with 
placebo,  particularly  regarding  one  measure  of  clinical 
remission in the study conducted by Kishi and colleagues, 
2021.24  This  exception  underscores  the  importance  of 
considering  individual  study  nuances  and  the  potential 
impact of high- quality methodologies.

A comparative analysis between valproate with lithium, 
a widely acknowledged mood stabiliser, suggests no statis-
tical  differences  between  the  two  drugs  across  multiple 
outcomes.21–25 36 37 The consistency in these findings indi-
cates a comparable efficacy profile between valproate and 
lithium,  highlighting  the  importance  of  individualised 
treatment plans tailored to patient- specific factors.

In  NMAs,  valproate  demonstrated  poorer  results 
compared  with  carbamazepine  in  improving  manic 
symptoms23 25; however, pairwise meta- analyses indicated 
similar efficacy between these two drugs.21 36 37 Addition-
ally,  valproate  exhibited  comparability  to  oxcarbazepine 
in  improving  manic  symptoms,23  25  clinical  response,51 
remission  rate  and  change  in  symptom  severity.21  The 
absence of significant differences between oxcarbazepine 
and valproate in various outcomes raises questions about 
potential  class  effects  within  antiepileptic  medications 
and  their  applicability  in  the  context  of  acute  mania. 
That  is  not  applicable  to  topiramate  that  did  not  show 
antimanic effects and was inferior to valproate in all effi-
cacy outcomes in acute mania.

The evaluation of olanzapine, a second- generation anti-
psychotic, in comparison with valproate yields intriguing 
results. No significant differences were observed in terms 
of  remission  rate21  35  and  withdrawal  due  to  a  failure 
to  respond.36  37  However,  olanzapine  outperformed 
valproate  in  terms  of  change  in  symptom  severity,21

clinical  response37  and  improvement  of  manic  symp-
toms.35  Risperidone  showed  superiority  to  valproate  in 
reducing  manic  symptoms  in  a  single  NMA.23  Valproate 
demonstrated  similarities  to  haloperidol21  36  37  55  and 
quetiapine,23 indicating comparable efficacy of valproate 
with the use of these two antipsychotics in acute mania. 
In  addition  to  these  comparisons,  recent  literature 
reviews  have  recommended  valproate,  along  with  other 
antipsychotics, for treating acute mania.12 These include 
asenapine, cariprazine, risperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasi-
done11 78 79 and paliperidone.11 78

Valproate in bipolar depression
The  assessment  of  systematic  reviews  and  meta- analyses 
examining the utilisation of valproate in bipolar depres-
sion  suggests  its  superiority  over  placebo  in  reducing 
depressive  symptoms,  as  evidenced  by  two  high- quality 
systematic  reviews.18  19  However,  conflicting  findings 
emerge regarding the reduction in the number of partic-
ipants  achieving  clinical  remission,  with  discrepant 
results  reported  by  two  studies.59  Furthermore,  the  use 
of  an  adjunctive  antipsychotic,  such  as  olanzapine,  was 
found to be more effective than valproate monotherapy 
in symptom reduction. Additionally, the combination of 
memantine and valproate demonstrated superiority over 
valproate monotherapy in the acute treatment of bipolar 
depression in a small non- replicated trial.61 Importantly, 
despite various meta- analyses, all estimates for valproate 
in bipolar depression were derived from six small clinical 
trials.61  80–84  The  meta- analysis  with  the  highest  sample 
size, conducted by Yildz et al included 206 subjects. This 
reliance  on  relatively  small- sample  clinical  trials  under-
mines the generalisability of systematic reviews in demon-
strating the superiority of valproate in bipolar depression. 
For  robust  evidence  based  on  systematic  reviews,  the 
combined  number  of  expected  samples  should  be 
around one thousand patients, as suggested by Trikalinos 
et al.85 85 It is widely acknowledged that large randomised 
controlled  trials  have  become  increasingly  prevalent  in 
some medical fields, though this trend is less pronounced 
in mental health.85

It  is  noteworthy  that  the  first- line  efficacious  treat-
ments for acute episodes of bipolar depression primarily 
involve antipsychotics such as cariprazine and quetiapine 
that  were  shown  to  be  first- line  treatments  in  recent 
clinical  reviews.12  19  78  79  Furthermore,  adjunctive  treat-
ments involving valproate and antipsychotics can also be 
considered, particularly quetiapine,12 59 olanzapine60 and 
lurasidone.86

It  is  widely  recognised  that  individuals  with  BD 
frequently  experience  depressive  symptoms.11  However, 
there has been a lack of emphasis on clinical trials specif-
ically  addressing  bipolar  depression.  The  use  of  anti-
depressants  remains  a  subject  of  controversy  and  it  is 
advised against as a standalone treatment.11 12 For bipolar 
disorder type 2, the use of antidepressants should always 
be in conjunction with mood stabilisers or antipsychotics 
due to the heightened risk of a manic switch.11 Moreover,

we emphasise that considering indirect comparisons from 
NMAs our study reveals that valproate was more effective 
than agomelatine and the combination of sertraline with 
lithium.19

Valproate in maintenance treatment of BD
The  investigation  into  valproate’s  efficacy  in  preventing 
relapses among individuals diagnosed with BD has greatly 
improved  our  understanding  of  its  therapeutic  poten-
tial.  The  included  systematic  reviews  have  consistently 
demonstrated valproate’s superiority over placebo.24 62–67 
However, in certain comparisons, valproate was found to 
be  comparable  to  placebo,  particularly  concerning  the 
relapse of depressive episodes.24 62

lithium, 

The  comparative  analysis  of  valproate  with  other 
introduces  a 
mood  stabilisers,  particularly 
layer  of  complexity  to  our  understanding.  Lithium  and 
valproate exhibited comparability across a range of clin-
ical  outcomes.  Importantly,  no  significant  differences 
were identified in the recurrence or relapse of depressive 
episodes, or withdrawals for any acute episode.20 24 62 65–67 
In  the  realm  of  antipsychotic  comparisons,  no  signifi-
cant  differences  were  observed  between  valproate  and 
olanzapine across all acute episodes—be they depressive, 
manic or mixed episodes.65 66 73 The addition of valproate 
to aripiprazole24 62 64 and lamotrigine did not demonstrate 
superiority  over  valproate  monotherapy.24  64  Antipsy-
chotics like olanzapine, risperidone, asenapine, aripipra-
zole and quetiapine play a crucial role in managing the 
maintenance treatment of BD.11 78 79

Limitations
This  overview  presents  potential  limitations.  First,  this 
overview  limited  its  search  to  Medline  and  CDSR,  even 
though  other  databases  are  available  and  could  poten-
tially  yield  additional  results.  However,  PubMed  and 
CDSR  are  widely  recognised  for  their  comprehensive 
coverage  and  relevance  to  the  topics  we  examined,  and 
they  typically  cover  the  most  high- quality  systematic 
reviews.  Additionally,  there  is  evidence  that  using  data 
sources  beyond  PubMed  has  only  a  modest  impact  on 
the  results  of  systematic  reviews  of  therapeutic  inter-
ventions.87  Also,  the  search  strategy  specifically  targeted 
systematic reviews, which could potentially overlook arti-
cles.  However,  we  followed  the  Cochrane  recommenda-
tions  for  the  overviews,  which  guide  the  use  of  specific 
terms related to the systematic review study design.26

Second,  most  of  the  included  systematic  reviews 
demonstrated  an  overlap  of  primary  studies,  potentially 
introducing  bias  by  overemphasising  the  significance  of 
certain RCTs. To mitigate this bias, the present overview 
assessed  the  magnitude  of  primary  studies  overlapping. 
Furthermore,  we  adhered  to  a  standardised  procedure, 
elucidating  each  step,  and  adopted  clear  inclusion  and 
exclusion  criteria  for  the  analysed  studies.  To  address 
potential  omissions,  articles  that  were  not  identified  in 
the  initial  literature  search  were  then  cross- referenced 
with  the  reference  lists  of  included  studies.  Contacting 

14

authors  became  necessary  for  specific  studies  to  clarify 
uncertainties  about  the  trials  incorporated  into  their 
results.  Notably,  the  systematic  reviews  that  focused  on 
maintenance  and  bipolar  depression  were  conducted 
with a sample size of fewer than 1000 subjects, which falls 
short of the ideal number for a robust meta- analysis.85

CONCLUSION
The  present  overview  of  systematic  reviews  with  meta- 
analyses  showed  that  valproate  stands  out  as  a  valuable 
agent  in  the  treatment  of  mania,  bipolar  depression 
and  maintenance  treatment  of  BD,  demonstrating  effi-
cacy in preventing relapses and stabilising mood. Future 
research endeavours should concentrate on refining our 
understanding  of  the  comparative  efficacy  of  valproate, 
particularly  combinations  with  antipsychotics  within  the 
evolving landscape of treating BD.
