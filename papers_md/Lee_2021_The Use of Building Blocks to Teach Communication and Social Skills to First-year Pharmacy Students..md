Objective. To conduct an innovative workshop activity using plastic building blocks to create a student-
centric environment that encouraged development of creative thinking skills and self-reflection in under-
graduate pharmacy students.
Methods. Students were randomly allocated into small groups of four and assigned the role of either
architect or team builder and tasked with creating a LEGO robot. Students were not allowed to speak dur-
ing the activity. The architect was tasked with providing instructions to team builders on how to build the
robot using nonverbal communication. After completion of the task, each group was asked to reflect on
the exercise and share what they learned with the entire class. These discussions were video recorded and
thematically analyzed.
Results. The metaphorical models that students built served as a basis for discussion, problem-solving,
and decision-making. Students described how this activity enabled them to mentally and visually link
abstract concepts, such as decision-making and problem-solving, to actual practice. Three themes were
identified from the qualitative study: thinking with hands, listening with eyes; linking theory to practice;
and learning through reflection.
Conclusion. This activity offered a non-confrontational way to support communication and the learning
process. The use of an interactive game can be a useful teaching strategy to create an active-learning envi-
ronment, helping pharmacy students improve their social and cognitive skills, such as decision-making,
problem-solving, and communication.
Keywords: communication, constructivist theory, problem-based learning, reflective practice, social skills

INTRODUCTION

Person-centered care, which is based on the premise
that individuals have their own views and preferences
about what their priorities in life should be, is integral to
the delivery of safe and effective health care.1 Studies
have shown that this approach results in improvement in
patient adherence, disease outcomes, and quality of life.2-4
A person-centered approach to care is built on three goals:
eliciting the patient’s perspective on the illness; under-
standing the patient’s psychosocial context; and reaching
shared treatment goals based on the patient’s preferences,
needs, and values.5,6 As such, social skills, or the ability to
navigate interpersonal and social situations effectively
using communication, leadership, and teamwork, are a

key competence for a successful health care encounter.7
These social skills, together with cognitive skills (eg, the
ability to understand complex ideas; adapt effectively to
an environment; learn from experience; and reason, such
as critical thinking and problem-solving) are essential for
health care providers to have to empower patients to make
more informed choices.8

As a member of the health care team, pharmacists
should develop these social and cognitive skills to ensure
that they become successful practitioners and contribute to
the optimization of health outcomes. Traditionally, the
pharmacy curriculum has focused on students’ acquisition
of knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Students are expected
to apply the knowledge and skills they have gained within
and beyond the educational program. Recently, educators
have advocated that the expectation be transformed from
acquisition of knowledge, skills, and attitude to integration
of knowing, acting, and being.5,9 Nevertheless, challenges
remain in designing an effective course that provides

students with the necessary skills and knowledge to facili-
tate person-centered care.

Collaborative game play has been widely employed
to facilitate students’ learning, foster teamwork and collab-
oration, and support the learning process within informal
settings.10 Research has shown that
it can encourage
higher-level discussion, which enhances students’ social
and cognitive skills.11 A large number of studies have
investigated the use of various gaming activities to support
pharmacy education, including simulation role-play, card
games, board games, and crossword puzzles.12,13 These
studies have shown that games can increase students’ inter-
active participation and spur excitement, as noted in the
positive feedback from students. Another key strength of
using collaborative games in teaching is the ability to pro-
mote student-to-student interaction and peer learning, help-
ing students be more engaged in discussions. Indeed, play
can increase social bonding as it brings together a sense of
partnership, cohesion, and cultural expression, which help
develop leadership, teamwork, and cooperation.

The positive attitudes of students toward learning
through games suggest the possibility of their use as a
learning modality. This builds upon the constructivism the-
ory that individual learners construct mental models to
understand the world around them. Through building and
constructing of a product or artefact, the student is able to
construct theories and knowledge in their minds.14,15 The
learners can then apply their knowledge through modelling
and use of metaphors, thereby formalizing relationships
that can otherwise be difficult to comprehend. Through
play, learners are able to achieve a greater degree of
authenticity to connect with their emotions and intuitions.

Building LEGO models as a game play technique for
teaching and learning in higher education has gained much
attention and research over the past few years.16-18 Using
LEGO blocks these studies had attempted to create a safe
space without any boundaries or social norms to allow
learners to speak up and have their authentic voices heard.
Studies have shown that this method was able to create a
collaborative communicative learning environment for
participants to share, develop, and express their ideas.19-21
The use of LEGO blocks also allowed learners to build
metaphorical models that represented their experience and
ideas.22 Participants’ feedback confirmed that the experi-
ence provided them with a multitude of opportunities to
work in groups and develop social and cognitive skills.

The Bachelor of Pharmacy program at Monash Univer-
sity aims to nurture and develop students who will be able to
demonstrate the concept of a “seven-star pharmacist”: care-
giver, communicator, decision maker, community leader,
manager, life-long learner, and teacher.23 To achieve this,
faculty have chosen to expose students to the roles of a

pharmacist early in the course curriculum using a variety of
strategies. Since 2017, the school regularly invites practicing
pharmacists to share their experiences with first-year phar-
macy students in a one-hour interactive lecture followed by
a two-hour workshop. During the workshop, students take
part in a “world caf(cid:1)e” event, where they share and reflect on
what they heard from the pharmacists during the lectures
and how they relate to the seven-star pharmacist concept.
Nevertheless, one challenge we identified was that students
often lacked engagement and were unwilling to share ideas
for discussion. In this study, we describe the design and
assessment of an innovative education workshop using
LEGO blocks to increase and foster pharmacy students’
social and cognitive skills.

METHODS

In 2019, the authors developed a LEGO building
workshop as an alternative learning activity to help stimu-
late discussion among year 1 undergraduate pharmacy stu-
dents. The workshop was designed for students to engage
in two activities: first, students built their ideal robotic
model using LEGO blocks, and second, they participated
as a class in a reflection activity immediately following
the group project. The goal of the workshop was to
enhance students’ understanding of effective communica-
tion, collaboration, and decision making. This was enabled
via the social and emotional activities of closely working
in teams, which required active listening, dialogue, and
receptiveness to the perspectives of others.

At the beginning of the workshop, Moodle was used
to randomly assign students into groups of four. Each
group was given a pre-mixed bag of 30-50 pieces of LEGO
blocks of various shapes, sizes, and colors. Students drew
cards to determine whether they took on the role of the
architect or a team-builder. Throughout the activity, stu-
dents were not allowed to speak with one another. Also,
the architect was not allowed to touch the blocks, but could
provide instructions using nonverbal communication. The
builders in the team were required to assemble a pre-
specified model based upon the nonverbal instructions
from the architect.

While the play aspect was an important component
of the workshop, this needed to be balanced with an appro-
priate level of challenge to ensure that student interest and
engagement was maintained.24,25 To achieve this, the
architect in each group was given a limitation at the begin-
ning of the activity and asked not to share this limitation
with the rest of the group. Every five minutes, an addi-
tional set of instructions or a limitation was given to each
group or to an individual student within the group until the
task was completed. No additional instructions were given

830

to students. Some examples of the limitations include cre-
ating the model using only a single block color, building a
model that was at least eight blocks high, or building a
foundation layer consisting of exactly 20 bricks. These
limitations forced students to work collaboratively within
and between groups, as the limitations required them to
communicate nonverbally or even exchange bricks with
other groups.

After the activity, each group was asked to create a
poster that reflected and focused on an element of their
activity that “struck a chord” with them and how it was
related to the concept of a seven-star pharmacist. Each
group was required to present their reflection about the
activity to the entire class, which included up to eight
groups. The presentations were video recorded for subse-
quent analysis by the authors. Faculty members who acted
as workshop facilitators were available during the presen-
tations to provide constructive feedback and reinforce the
importance of reflective practice to students. Students
were also given the opportunity to ask questions and make
suggestions or comments to the presenting groups, provid-
ing them with an opportunity for reflective sharing.

To evaluate the success of the workshop, we deter-
mined that an inductive qualitative study rooted in
grounded theory was the most appropriate approach to
use.26,27 The following research questions were identified:
“How does the use of LEGO contribute towards develop-
ment of social skills?” and “How does the student feel using
the workshop to develop skills?” Following the workshop,
all students were sent a post-workshop survey of six open-
ended questions to capture the students’ perspectives
regarding the design and implementation of the workshop,
any emotions experienced, comfort levels with the work-
shop, and perceived value of the workshop. The survey was
distributed online via Qualtrics (Qualtrics). To triangulate
the self-reported data, video recordings of students’ reflec-
tions during the workshop were also viewed to explore
potential connections between students’ reflections and
their responses on the self-reported questionnaire.

Both textual data and video recordings were coded
independently by the authors for thematic analysis. The
authors met to discuss the coding results, and a consensus
was reached when differences existed. Finally, these codes
were grouped into themes and subthemes and reviewed
before data analysis and reporting. The study was approved
by the Monash Human Research Ethics Committee.

RESULTS

All year 1 pharmacy students enrolled in the course
during the 2019 academic year completed the workshop
and assessment (N5114). The mean age of students was

20 years, and the majority were female (n590; 78.9%).
The post-workshop survey indicated that students (84%)
thought
the workshop improved their communication
skills. Students were highly engaged during the session.
Most groups made a LEGO model that was similar to an
illustration of a human. However, several groups created
very different models to explain the concept in an unusual
and memorable way. For example, one group built a croc-
odile for their project, and described the importance of
nonverbal communication and eye contact for communi-
cation. They related how play was important for learning,
not only as a child, but throughout life. Other aspects
described included the importance of being a decision
maker and assuming a leadership position to ensure that
the task got completed on time. Another group built a
snake and related how that reminded them of a caduceus.
They described what the symbol meant to them as future
health care professionals, and the importance of empathy
and caregiving.

From our analysis of the qualitative data gathered
from this exploratory study, we identified three emerging
themes. The themes identified were summarized as fol-
lows: thinking with hands, listening with eyes; linking the-
ory to practice; and learning through reflection. Results
are presented below, aligned to the research questions,
with supporting exemplar quotes presented in Table 1.

The LEGO activity acted as a non-confrontational
way to encourage and support communication between
students. A majority realized how the activity helped them
to improve their communication skills and the importance
of communication as pharmacists in training. Participants
mentioned the importance of using nonverbal communica-
tion, listening, and presentation skills to accomplish the
given task. From the video recordings, we observed an
interplay of social and cognitive skills during the activity,
including decision making, teamwork, leadership, and
time management. Students highlighted the conflict reso-
lution aspects of the workshop, and saw the value of the
activity in emphasizing the range of views they had
obtained: “Even though we could not communicate, we
managed to complete the task given. I learnt that having
skills such as being a decision maker and communicator
are important because without communicating effectively
and making a decision efficiently, the task would not have
been completed.”

The next theme identified was related to the knowl-
edge gained by students. Students reported that the activity
aided them in drawing out insights from practice situa-
tions. In particular, several students specifically empha-
sized the value of the activity to be able to link between
theory and practice. This, coupled with the poster creation
activity, provided students with a concept map, as these

concepts were broken down into small, understandable
segments which student felt they could subsequently build
upon. Students found the activity to be very fun and
engaging and said it served as a conduit through which to
engage with each other. For example, one student shared,
“The workshop activity taught me that learning can be cre-
ative and fun but impactful at the same time.” Some of the
students also felt that greater engagement in the activity
resulted in deeper thinking and long-term retention of
learned concepts. The skills learned were not things the
students felt they could have learned from textbooks.

The final theme summarizes the insights gained by
students. Students reported that the activity provided an
opportunity for them to self-reflect about their own think-
ing and progress. For example, students mentioned that
they felt they would have been able to manage the task bet-
ter if they had been more organized and delegated tasks to
team members at the beginning of the activity. They
wished that they had been more decisive, had been proac-
tive in offering opinions, and had volunteered to make the
presentation to the class. Several students also acknowl-
edged the usefulness of the activity in teaching them about
team building. For example, one student stated, “I learned
that ‘teamwork makes the dream work’ and that communi-
cation is the key to the outcome of every project.”

DISCUSSION

Our study found that using LEGO blocks as a form of
play can be useful in educating and preparing health care
students with the practical skills needed to enhance social
and cognitive skills. The activity also created an opportu-
nity for peer-learning, as it allowed students to engage
within and between group members, as well as conceptu-
alize their journey and development as future pharmacists.
More importantly, students used the LEGO activity as an
opportunity to improve their communication skills as they
attempted to convey their views and vision without words.
It also taught them the importance of listening. Based on
the qualitative responses of students, we noted several
examples of growth from the depth and quality of their
reflections. In addition, we observed that the models cre-
ated by some of the student groups allowed those students
to express themselves more creatively and better visualize
their learning than students in other groups, thus enhanc-
ing those students’ learning experience.

While the introduction of this activity to teach social
and cognitive skills was experimental, our evidence sug-
gests that it was successful. Overall, the activity made stu-
dents feel more relaxed and enabled them to communicate
in a more stimulating and enjoyable manner. The building
of the LEGO model allowed students to build something

that represented their knowledge and understanding of
what it meant to be a pharmacist. In the discussion that
ensued during the poster creation session, we observed
elements of peer-led team learning, where students began
to engage with each other to enhance their learning.28

Active learning is part of the teaching ethos at our
school. As such, teaching activities were designed to
ensure that any problem-solving and decision-making
exercise required active participation among the groups.
The LEGO workshop embraced this principle, where
through active play, students were able to demonstrate their
understanding of how these skills were important for their
future development as pharmacists. The activity allowed
students to explore and construct objects to demonstrate a
deeper understanding of concepts of decision making and
problem solving.29 While the use of LEGO blocks has
been examined in other disciplines, such as engineering
and business courses, only limited studies have attempted
to use LEGO in the teaching of health care students at insti-
tutions of higher learning.17,30-32 In a separate study by
Kirby and Pawlikowska, the authors examined the use of
LEGO to teach the basics of pharmacology. In their study,
the authors used elements of play, teamwork, and peer-
teaching to revise the core concepts in pharmacology. Stu-
dents reported that the activity was an enjoyable way to
learn difficult concepts that might have otherwise seemed
boring.33 The researchers also reported an improvement in
students’ knowledge after the intervention, as shown in the
higher scores on multiple-choice questions completed fol-
lowing the team interaction. Harding and D’Eon used
LEGO in their workshop to introduce first-year medical
students to patient-centered interviewing. They noted that
the activity supported the development of effective com-
munication and students expressed more confidence in
questioning techniques.34 Similar to this study, the authors
found that students were able to be more aware of what
they had learned from the activity.

Studies have reported that learning is often incomplete
without a debriefing as it allows students to understand the
purpose of the activity. Debriefing allows for students to be
fully engaged in the process, elaborate and describe their
roles, and socialize with new members for their future work-
ing environment. Because of this, we included a debriefing
session after our activity as this afforded students an opportu-
nity for reflection, which is a valuable component in the
experiential learning process. During the debriefing, students
were able to reflect further on their experiences and integrate
their prior learnings with the new knowledge gained during
the activity, as well as think about how this new knowledge
could be applied in their future roles as pharmacists.

Students spoke enthusiastically of the workshop and
indicated that the LEGO activity was the highlight of the

833

American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 2021; 85 (8) Article 8464.

session. Students also described the importance of using a
multimodal communication strategy to give instructions.
Students seemed to have little trouble in identifying with
the activity and how this analogy was related to the social
and cognitive skills they would need to develop to succeed
as pharmacists.

In this study, we attempted to triangulate our data
using students’ self-reflections and debriefing sessions,
which allowed us to explore similarities and shared themes
as well as preserve the granularity of students’ experien-
ces. We purposefully video-recorded the sessions so that
we could review them, and we gave equal weight to each
participant’s account in our analysis and write-up, which
further boosted the credibility of these findings. While this
is useful, the small sample size of our cohort may limit the
transferability of our findings. Our workshop was a very
simple yet cost-effective teaching method that can be
implemented by most educators from various disciplines.
While technology-enhanced learning is now becoming
more widely adopted, it does incur significant setup cost
that can be prohibitive.35

This research has some limitations. As this was an
exploratory study, the activity was only conducted once
over a short time span. As such, the activity may not suit
all students as most learn at difference paces, with some
requiring more time to fully develop skills. Our cohort
was limited by its diversity, given that most of the students
were female and middle-class. Finally, we did not assess
changes in students’ knowledge or skill domains before
and after the workshop. We only assessed the students’
perception of the activity as it was not feasible for us to
track the changes over a longer time span. Nevertheless,
we believe that the use of LEGO blocks is a good interac-
tive activity that can help pharmacy students think about
the qualities they need to develop as future pharmacists.

CONCLUSION

We describe an innovative activity for teaching social
and cognitive skills to pharmacy students. The activity pro-
vided an environment where students could interact freely
and articulate their views and opinions in a fun and engaging
way. Through the building of LEGO models and participa-
tion in group work, students reported having an improved
understanding of how skills such as decision making, prob-
lem solving, and communication are important to develop as
they prepare for their roles as pharmacists.
