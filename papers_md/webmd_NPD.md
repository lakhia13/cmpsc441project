## Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Relationships


NPD causes problems in many areas of life, including close relationships. These interpersonal issues, which are often driven by symptoms of NPD, include:

- Being easily hurt

- Struggling to take criticism

- Making excuses for own flaws or failings

- Beingemotionally neglectful

- Interrupting often

Someone like this may appear to have high self-esteem, but sometimes the opposite is true. There may be a deep sense of insecurity underneath the grand exterior. Someone can be narcissistic and not have the disorder. They may be self-absorbed and hypercompetitive, but not to the extent that it disrupts their daily life.

Itâs proven that people are often drawn to narcissists and find them attractive, charismatic, and exciting. Confidence can be charming. Successful leaders often have narcissistic qualities.


## Narcissistic Personality Disorder Diagnosis


Personality disorders are longstanding, ingrained, dysfunctional patterns of thinking, behaving, and relating to other people. These signs can show up as early as age 8, when children start to become aware of how people react to them. People withnarcissistic personality disordertend not to perceive that they may have a mental health problem, which may make them less likely to seek evaluation or treatment.

A recent study at Ohio State University says many people readily admit to being a narcissist.But while narcissism may be common, narcissistic personality disorder is rare.

Narcissistic personality disorder test

There are no lab tests to confirm amental disorder. Many professionals use the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, a list of 40 questions that measures things such as how much attention and power someone craves.

Doctors also use the American Psychiatric AssociationâsÂDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth EditionÂ (DSM-5)to make a diagnosis. This guide lists nine criteria for NPD. To get a diagnosis, you must have at least five of them.


## Narcissistic Personality Disorder Causes


The exact cause is not known. Like most mental and personality disorders, itâs likely due to a complex combination of factors including:

- Genes.People with NPD are more likely to have family members with it.

- Environment including parent-child relationships.Kids often imitate the behaviors they observe in their parents. Overprotective parenting styles may also foster habits that can lead to NPD.

- Neurobiology (the connection between your behavior and your nervous system).Research suggests people with NPD may have small differences in their brain structure.

- Culture.NPD seems to be more common in people who grow up in cultures that value personal independence. The disorder is less likely to affect those who live in cultures that stress the importance of community.

People whose parents put them on a pedestal and shower them with endless praise may be at higher risk for NPD, a recent study found. Then again, the opposite is true, too. Children who are ignored or abused may develop NPD almost as a survival instinct. They may feel that they need to look out for themselves because no one else will.

NPD happens more in males than females. It usually shows up in teens or young adults. Keep in mind that children -- and really anyone -- can act in ways that seem narcissistic at times. This doesnât usually mean they have NPD or will develop it later.


## Narcissistic Personality Disorder Treatment


There is no cure, buttherapy can help. The goal is to build up the personâs poor self-esteem and foster more realistic expectations of others. Treatment usually centers on talk therapy. Sometimes people call thispsychotherapy.

Talk therapy can help a person with NPD relate to other people better and understand their feelings and behaviors. Talk therapy can help a person with NPD to:

- Accept and maintain relationships with other people, including coworkers

- Recognize their own strengths and weaknesses

- Learn to accept criticism or failures

- Develop more realistic goals

- Let go of unrealistic goals and desires

Some types of talk therapy are:

- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).CBT helps you identify and change your negative thoughts and behaviors.

- Metacognitive therapy.Itâs a type of CBT that specifically helps you stop unhealthy beliefs and thinking.

- Dialectical behavioral therapy(DBT).DBT is a type of CBT thatâs especially beneficial if you struggle to manage your emotions.

- Group therapy. With group therapy, multiple people meet at the same time for a session.

- Couples or family therapy.A therapy session that focuses on couples or a family unit is sometimes helpful.

There are no medicines specifically for NPD. But doctors may prescribe drugs that are usually used to treat related mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety. Some of these are:

- Antidepressants

- Anti-anxiety meds

- Anticonvulsants

Relaxation exercises, such as yoga ormindfulness meditation, might also be helpful if you have NPD.

There arenât drugs to treat this mental disorder, but depression and anxiety sometimes go hand in hand with narcissism, and there are helpful drugs for those conditions.

If the narcissist abuses alcohol or drugs (which is common), itâs important to get treatment for the addictions, too.

With children, experts suggest that parents who give too much praise cut back, while those who donât give enough attention should step up.

Narcissists can learn how to relate to others in more positive ways, but it depends on how open they are to critical feedback and how willing they are to change.


## Narcissistic Personality Disorder Complications


People with NPD often have other mental health conditions, such as anxiety, depression,bipolar disorder, eating disorders, or other personality disorders. Theyâre also more likely to abuse drugs or alcohol.

Some possible complications of NPD and the conditions that overlap are:

- Trouble at work or school

- Relationship issues

- Physical health problems

- Thoughts about suicide

- Suicidal behaviors
