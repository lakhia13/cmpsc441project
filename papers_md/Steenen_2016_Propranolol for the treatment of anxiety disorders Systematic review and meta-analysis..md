Abstract
The effects of propranolol in the treatment of anxiety disorders have not been systematically evaluated previously. The aim was to conduct a systematic 
review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials, addressing the efficacy of oral propranolol versus placebo or other medication as a treatment 
for alleviating either state or trait anxiety in patients suffering from anxiety disorders. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies concerned 
panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (four studies, total n = 130), specific phobia (two studies, total n = 37), social phobia (one study, n = 16), 
and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (one study, n = 19). Three out of four panic disorder trials qualified for pooled analyses. These meta-analyses 
found no statistically significant differences between the efficacy of propranolol and benzodiazepines regarding the short-term treatment of panic 
disorder with or without agoraphobia. Also, no evidence was found for effects of propranolol on PTSD symptom severity through inhibition of memory 
reconsolidation. In conclusion, the quality of evidence for the efficacy of propranolol at present is insufficient to support the routine use of propranolol 
in the treatment of any of the anxiety disorders.

Introduction

Propranolol, a ß1,2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, competes at recep-
tor level with catecholamines, thereby blocking their orthosym-
pathetic  effects  (Black  et  al.,  1964).  Clinically,  propranolol  is 
used widely to target peripheral sites of the noradrenergic system 
to treat hypertension, coronary artery disease and tachyarrhyth-
mias  (Freemantle  et  al.,  1999;  Fuster  et  al.,  2006; Webb  et  al., 
2010).  Furthermore,  propranolol  can  be  deployed  to  block 
ß-adrenoreceptors in the central nervous system, as the lipophilic 
compound readily enters the blood–brain barrier.

Soon  after  the  discovery  of  propranolol  in  the  early  1960s, 
Turner and Granville-Grossman fortuitously noted its anxiolytic 
effects in an attempt to reduce tachycardia caused by hyperthy-
roidism (Turner and Granville-Grossman, 1965). Ever since, pro-
pranolol  has  gained  increasing  interest  in  psychiatry.  Several 
trials studying off-label use of propranolol would follow, such as 
its use in the treatment of high trait anxiety (Becker, 1976; Kathol 
et  al.,  1980;  Meibach  et  al.,  1987;  Wheatley,  1969),  substance 
disorder and withdrawal symptoms (Grosz, 1972), schizophrenia 
(Yorkston et al., 1974), autism (Ratey et al., 1987), and aggres-
sion (Fleminger et al., 2006). In addition, propranolol has been 
shown to mitigate milder distressing states such as exam nerves 
(Brewer, 1972; Drew et al., 1985; Stone et al., 1973), stage fright 
(Brantigan et al., 1982), performance anxiety in musicians (Clark 
and Agras, 1991), performance anxiety in surgeons (Elman et al., 
1998), and fear of undergoing surgery (Dyck and Chung, 1991; 
Jakobsson et al., 1995; Mealy et al., 1996).

Propranolol’s generic status, and the fact that selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have become first-line pharmacological 

treatment  across  the  range  of  anxiety  disorders  (Baldwin  et  al., 
2014), have probably contributed to a gradually declining attention 
for the agent as a potential treatment of anxiety-related conditions. 
More  recently  however,  with  advanced  insights  into  the  way  the 
brain processes emotional experiences and their pivotal role in the 
development and persistence of several mental disorders (McGaugh, 
2000), the psychopharmacological properties of propranolol have 
regained  research  attention  (Johansen  et  al.,  2011;  Kindt  et  al., 
2009; Soeter and Kindt, 2010).

Whereas  propranolol  was  first  studied  as  a  general  anxio-
lytic in the treatment of anxiety disorders, today it is mainly the 
amnesic effect on retrieved fear memory that is the subject of 
interest. To this end, there is evidence to suggest that after a fear

memory  is  recollected,  and  followed  specifically  by  a  predic-
tion error (a discrepancy between actual and expected negative 
events),  propranolol  selectively  blocks  protein  synthesis, 
thereby  prohibiting  the  ‘reconsolidation’  of  the  fear  memory 
while sparing declarative memory (Debiec and Ledoux, 2004; 
Finnie and Nader, 2012; Kindt et al., 2009; Merlo et al., 2014, 
2015; Nader et al., 2000; Sevenster et al., 2013). A recent meta-
analysis  of  eight  experiments  with  healthy  human  volunteers 
(total n = 308) supported this line of reasoning as it was found 
that  compared  with  placebo,  propranolol  administered  before 
memory  reactivation  is  capable  of  reducing  the  expression  of 
cue-elicited  fear  responses  (Lonergan  et  al.,  2013). The  latter 
findings have tempted several authors to suggest that proprano-
lol has potential for the treatment of anxiety disorders that are 
rooted  in  the  presence  of  disturbing  memories,  particularly 
posttraumatic  stress  disorder,  or  PTSD  (e.g.  Gardner,  2010; 
Giles, 2005; Lehrer, 2012). Yet, it should be noted that the treat-
ment approach in which propranolol is employed as an ‘amne-
sic agent’ to reduce traumatic memory differs from the use of 
propranolol  as  a  general  anxiolytic  agent  in  the  treatment  of 
anxiety disorders.

Clinical evidence for the effects of propranolol  in the  treat-
ment of anxiety disorders has never before been systematically 
reviewed. Accordingly, in an effort to determine the current place 
of  propranolol  within  the  therapeutic  armamentarium  of  treat-
ments for anxiety disorders, the aim of this study was to review 
both published and unpublished reports of randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of oral propranolol versus 
placebo or other medication as a treatment for alleviating state 
and/or trait anxiety in patients suffering from anxiety disorders. 
In  addition,  meta-analyses  of  pooled  summary  statistics  were 
undertaken where possible.

Method

Systematic review

A systematic review was performed, which is reported in accord-
ance with the PRISMA Statement (Moher et al., 2009).

Eligibility  criteria.  Only  placebo-controlled,  comparative  par-
allel group and crossover RCTs were eligible when they included 
human subjects with any of the anxiety disorders as included in 
the current version (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) or 
previous  versions  of  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual 
(DSM) for an evaluation of the therapeutic effects of propranolol. 
Unpublished  abstracts  and  reports  were  also  considered.  The 
comparator was either a placebo or other medication. The search 
excluded  experimental  fear  conditioning  trials  and  secondary 
prevention trials. There was no restriction on the basis of sample 
size,  duration  of  follow-up,  primary  or  secondary  outcomes, 
duration  or  severity  of  symptoms,  presence  of  comorbid  disor-
ders, or demographic variables of subjects. The search was not 
restricted to any language.

Information sources and search.  An electronic systematic lit-
erature search, updated until 18 March 2014, was performed in 
the online databases: PubMED (all indexed years), Ovid Embase 
(Embase Classic and Embase 1947 to present), PsycINFO (1806 

to  present),  Web  of  Science  SCI-EXPANDED  1975–present 
[v.5.13.1], and the World Health Organization International Clin-
ical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) that includes unpub-
lished reports, using the following strategy (see Table 1). When 
necessary, authors of included articles were contacted in order to 
retrieve summary continuous data that were not provided in their 
trial report.

Trial selection.  During the primary screening process, two rat-
ers  (SAS  and  RvW)  independently  assessed  the  information  in 
the title and abstract of retrieved articles on their eligibility in a 
standardised but non-blinded manner. Thereafter, full text articles 
were retrieved and screened for eligibility. RCTs were included 
when both raters regarded all inclusion criteria (i.e. RCT, com-
parator agent, anxiety disorders) as fulfilled. Unpublished reports 
were also considered in order to rule out publication bias. There 
were  no  disagreements  in  assessment  and  inclusion.  Figure  1 
shows a flow diagram of the inclusion process.

Data extraction and collection.  One reviewer (SAS) extracted 
the  data,  and  a  second  reviewer  (RvW)  checked  the  extracted 
items. The following information was obtained from each trial: 
(a) description of the trials, including the primary researcher, the 
year of publication, and the source of funding; (b) characteristics 
of  the  interventions,  including  the  number  of  participants  ran-
domised  to  treatment  and  control  groups,  the  number  of  total 
dropouts per group as well as the number that dropped out due to 
adverse effects, the dose of the medication and the period over 
which it was administered; (c) characteristics of trial methodol-
ogy, including the diagnostic criteria employed; (d) characteris-
tics of participants, including gender distribution and mean and 
range of ages; and (e) outcome measures employed (both primary 
and  secondary),  and  summary  statistics  of  reported  continuous 
(means and standard deviations; SD) and dichotomous outcome 
measures  (categorical  treatment  outcome).  Summary  outcome 
data were entered into Review Manager (RevMan software, ver-
sion 5.2; Cochrane Collaboration, 2012). Eight authors were con-
tacted  for  further  information.  Seven  responded  but  none 
provided requested information or data.

Risk of bias.  To ascertain the validity of eligible RCTs, two of 
the reviewers (SAS and AJvW) independently assessed the qual-
ity of the trials by means of the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for 
assessing  risk  of  bias  (Higgins  et  al.,  2011a).  Disagreement  in 
assessment was solved by discussion with a third person (AdJ).

Meta-analysis

Meta-analyses  of  pooled  summary  statistics  were  undertaken 
only if trials were combinable; i.e. if these included participants 
with the same anxiety disorder and if treatment effects in these 
trials were expressed in the same variable.

Data analysis and synthesis.  For dichotomous treatment out-
comes  of  interest,  relative  risks  with  95%  confidence  intervals 
(95%-CIs) were used as the summary statistic. Results from con-
tinuous  data  were  expressed  as  weighted  mean  differences 
(WMDs)  with  95%-CIs.  These  data  were  pooled  over  studies

using invariance weighting. Results were combined using the ran-
dom  effects  model,  in  order  to  prevent  substantially  overstated 
precision of final estimates of effects even when statistical hetero-
geneity was low (I2 < 60% and p > 0.10; Schmidt et al., 2009). 
Data from only the first treatment period of crossover trials was 
included  in  the  calculation  of  summary  statistics  if  there  was 
insufficient  data  available  to  include  a  paired  analysis  (Higgins 
et al., 2011b). Data from both periods were included only when 
the  correlation  between  participants’  responses  to  the  interven-
tions in the different phases was provided in the trial report.

Sensitivity analysis.  To explore the degree to which the find-
ings  of  the  meta-analysis  could  be  affected  by  bias,  sensitivity 
analyses were performed, when considered appropriate.

Figure 1.  Flow of information through the different phases of the systematic search.

42 published trial reports (all in English language) were read full 
text for detailed examination. It appeared that 34 trials needed to 
be excluded after secondary review due to their study design (i.e. 
the full text article revealed that these trials were not randomised 
or that there was no comparator medication). Our eligibility cri-
teria were met by a total of eight published trials of propranolol 
for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia 
(four  studies,  n  =  130),  specific  phobia  (two  studies,  n  =  37), 
social phobia (one study, n = 16), and PTSD (one study, n = 19).

Study characteristics

The characteristics and results of included trials are summarised

Panic  disorder  with  or  without  agoraphobia.  Four  trials 
found mixed effects of propranolol versus other medication in the 
treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (Mun-
jack et al., 1985, 1989; Noyes et al., 1984; Ravaris et al., 1991).

Three of these four studies (Munjack et al., 1989; Noyes et al., 
1984; Ravaris et al., 1991) qualified for formal meta-analyses.

Posttraumatic  stress  disorder.  Only  one  trial  with  chronic 
PTSD patients showed that 40 mg of short-acting oral proprano-
lol  given  prior  to  imaginary  exposure,  followed  by  60  mg  of 
long-acting oral propranolol, statistically reduced physiological 
responding  (reduced  heart  rate  and  skin  conductance)  during 
imaginary exposure 1 week later (F(3,15) = 5.1; p = 0.007, η2 = 
0.49) (Brunet et al., 2008). No data on PTSD symptom severity 
endpoints were provided in the study report.

Specific phobia.  One trial with specific (dental) phobia subjects 
was found (Liu et al., 1991). It showed that, as compared with 
placebo, 80–120 mg of oral propranolol significantly diminished 
self-reported state anxiety during injection of local dental anaes-
thesia (self-reported anxiety at injection: 5.5 (2.75) versus 7.45 
(2.0), p = 0.033, one-tailed). One 3-week crossover trial with spe-
cific (animal type: snake or spider) phobia subjects by reported 
no significant effects of propranolol on self-reported trait anxiety 
(Fagerström et al., 1985).

Social phobia.  One trial with social phobia subjects was found. 
It reported absence of statistically significant effects of proprano-
lol  on  state  and  trait  anxiety  6  months  follow-up  after  a  social 
skills training (Falloon et al., 1981).

Risk of bias

Study quality.  Risk of bias judgements are summarised in Fig-
ure 2. The majority of trials (9/12; 75%) failed to provide com-
plete outcome data. On average, 19 percent (37 out of 191) of the 
participants  in  the  six  trials  that  provided  dropout  data  did  not 
reach study endpoint; hence the risk of attrition bias is consider-
able. The authors of one trial reported that “data from only the 
most clinically pertinent findings” were presented in the paper, 
although they specified all outcome measures that were initially 
recorded (Ravaris et al., 1991). Therefore, this trial was judged to 
have a high risk of selective outcome reporting.

Publication  bias.  No unpublished reports of completed RCTs 
were obtained. Three RCTs were found (ClinicalTrials.gov Iden-
tifiers: NCT00645450, NCT00648375 and NCT01239173) that 
had been terminated because of inadequate subject recruitment. 
The authors of these three discontinued trials were contacted. All 
responded, but none provided data.

Meta-analyses

Propranolol versus benzodiazepines in panic disorder with 
or without agoraphobia

Meta-analysis  I.  Outcome:  number  of  panic  attacks 
after  2  weeks  of  treatment.  Two  trials  report  the  effects  of 
propranolol (30–320 mg/day) versus benzodiazepines (1–30 mg/
day alprazolam or 5–40 mg/day diazepam) prescribed to adults 
with  panic  disorder  with  or  without  agoraphobia  for  a  2-week 
period, expressed in mean number of panic attacks after 2 weeks

of treatment (Noyes et al., 1984; Ravaris et al., 1991). Effect size 
for each study was expressed as a WMD. There was substantial 
statistical heterogeneity of studies (two trials, 50 participants in 
total; χ2 = 3.04, df = 1, p = 0.08, I2 = 67%). No significant differ-
ence was found between propranolol and benzodiazepines (mean 
difference = 1.58, 95%-CI [–2.33; 5.50], Z = 0.79, p = 0.43) (Fig-
ure 3(a)).

Meta-analysis II. Outcome: HAM-A after 2 weeks treat-
ment.  Two trials report the effects of propranolol (30–320 mg/
day) versus benzodiazepines (1–30 mg/day alprazolam or 5–40 
mg/day  diazepam)  given  to  adults  with  panic  disorder  with  or 
without  agoraphobia  for  a  2-week  period,  expressed  in  mean 
HAM-A after 2 weeks of treatment (Noyes et al., 1984; Ravaris 
et  al.,  1991).  WMDs  were  calculated  for  continuous  summary 
data obtained  from the  Hamilton Anxiety Rating  Scale (HAM-
A),  a  widely  used  scale  to  assess  the  severity  of  symptoms  of 
anxiety (Hamilton, 1959). There was substantial statistical heter-
ogeneity of studies (two trials, 50 participants in total; χ2 = 7.11, 
df = 1, p = 0.008, I2 = 86%). No significant difference was found 
between  propranolol  and  benzodiazepines  (mean  difference  = 
2.81, 95%-CI [–16.87; 22.49], Z = 0.28, p = 0.78) (Figure 3(b)).

Meta-analysis  III.  Outcome:  HAM-A  after  2–6  weeks 
treatment.  Three  trials  report  the  effects  of  propranolol  (20–
320 mg/day) versus benzodiazepines (0.5–30 mg/day alprazolam 
or  5–40  mg/day  diazepam)  given  to  adults  with  panic  disorder 
with  or  without  agoraphobia  for  a  2–6-week  period,  expressed 
in  mean  HAM-A  scores  at  completion  of  treatment  (Munjack 
et al., 1989; Noyes et al., 1984; Ravaris et al., 1991). There was 
substantial  statistical  heterogeneity  of  studies  (three  trials,  92 
participants in total; χ2 = 7.74, df = 2, p = 0.02, I2 = 74%). No 
significant  overall  effect  was  found  (mean  difference  =  –2.20, 
95%-CI [–8.49; 4.09], Z = 0.99, p = 0.32) (Figure 3(c)).

Meta-analysis IV. Outcome: HAM-A after 6 weeks treat-
ment.  Two  trials  examined  the  effects  of  propranolol  (30–300 
mg/day) versus alprazolam (1–30 mg/day) given to adults with 
panic disorder with or without agoraphobia for a 2-week period, 
expressed in mean HAM-A after 6 weeks of treatment (Munjack 
et al., 1989; Ravaris et al., 1991). There was little statistical heter-
ogeneity of studies (two trials, 68 participants in total; χ2 = 1.14, 
df = 1, p = 0.29, I2 = 12%). No significant difference was found 

between  propranolol  and  alprazolam  (mean  difference  =  0.51, 
95%-CI [–3.39; 4.42], Z = 0.26, p = 0.80) (Figure 3(d)).

Sensitivity analysis.  For one study, included in all four meta-
analyses,  a  high  risk  of  selective  outcome  reporting  was  found 
(Ravaris et al., 1991). The impact of this bias on the findings of 
our meta-analyses was assessed. After excluding this study only 
one study remained for meta-analyses I, number of panic attacks

after 2 weeks of treatment and meta-analyses II, HAM-A after 2 
weeks treatment (Noyes et al., 1984), and one study remained for 
the meta-analysis IV, HAM-A after 6 weeks treatment (Munjack 
et al., 1989). For the meta-analysis III, HAM-A after 2–6 weeks 
treatment,  two  studies  remained  (Munjack  et  al.,  1989;  Noyes 
et al., 1984) of which the effects of compared treatment (benzo-
diazepines and propranolol) no longer reached statistical signifi-
cance (two trials, 63 participants in total; MD = 5.76 [–2.27 to 
13.79], Z = 1.41, p = 0.16) (Figure 3(e)).

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis shows a lack of well-
designed clinical studies. This limits the scientific evidence and 
allows  neither  firm  conclusions  in  favour  or  against  the  use  of 
propranolol in the treatment of anxiety disorders, nor recommen-
dations for informed decision-making in clinical practice. More 
specifically,  our  meta-analyses  found  no  statistical  difference 
between the effects of propranolol and benzodiazepines on anxi-
ety  and  panic  attack  frequency  (Munjack  et  al.,  1989;  Noyes 
et al., 1984; Ravaris et al., 1991). In addition, four moderate risk 
of  bias  trials  failed  to  show  solid  evidence  on  the  therapeutic 
effect  of  propranolol  in  patients  with  dental  phobia  (Liu  et  al., 
1991), animal-type specific phobia (Fagerström et al., 1985), and 
social phobia (Falloon et al., 1981). No RCTs were available on 
the effects of propranolol in the treatment of any of other anxiety 
disorders  (e.g.  generalised  anxiety  disorder,  obsessive–compul-
sive  disorder  (OCD),  separation  anxiety  disorder,  or  selective 
mutism; note that PTSD and OCD have been relocated to sepa-
rate chapters in the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 
2013).  Moreover,  despite  widespread  suggestions  (Gardner, 
2010; Giles, 2005; Lehrer, 2012), no evidence was found for the 
effects of propranolol on PTSD symptom severity, through inhi-
bition  of  memory  reconsolidation  (Brunet  et  al.,  2008)  or  any 
other mechanism.

To date, statistical equivalence of the efficacy of propranolol 
versus  benzodiazepines  regarding  the  treatment  of  individuals 
with panic disorder with or panic disorder without agoraphobia 
has not been shown. Because the evidence converges to suggest 

that  propranolol  and  benzodiazepines  prescribed  in  clinical  
settings  have  similar  effectiveness  in  the  short-term  treatment  
of  these  conditions  (Munjack  et  al.,  1989;  Noyes  et  al.,  1984; 
Ravaris  et  al.,  1991),  other  factors  also  need  to  be  considered. 
First,  it  takes  time  for  an  effect  to  become  prominent  upon 
administration. SSRIs generally require a period of 2–4 weeks, 
while  in  some  patients  with  panic  disorder  the  onset  of  action 
may take up to 12 weeks (Michelson et al., 2001; Oehrberg et al., 
1995). Therefore,  early  adjuvant  therapy  with  propranolol  may 
be  taken  into  consideration.  Second,  the  side  effects  profile 
should  be  taken  into  account.  Whereas  the  clinical  effects  of  
benzodiazepines are considered equivalent to the first-line phar-
macotherapy of panic disorder (SSRIs; Mitte, 2005; Roy-Byrne 
et  al.,  2013;  Wilkinson  et  al.,  1991),  they  carry  a  high  risk  of 
unwanted sedative effects, cognitive impairment and dependence, 
and  tolerance  will  develop  over  time  (Baldwin  et  al.,  2014). 
Conversely as compared with benzodiazepines, the side effects 
of SSRIs are temporary, reversible and relatively benign, albeit 
still considerably frequent (among others, >10% gastrointestinal 
complaints,  fatigue,  insomnia,  and  headache;  Sandoz,  2012). 
Although side effects of propranolol occur less frequently (among 
others,  1–10%  sleeping  disturbances,  nightmares,  transient 
fatigue,  and  cold  extremities;  Roy-Byrne  et  al.,  2013;  Sandoz, 
2012),  the  extent  of  the  supporting  evidence  base  is  currently 
broader and more consistent for SSRIs than for propranolol (Otto 
et  al.,  2001).  Therefore,  it  would  seem  most  reasonable  not  to 
divert from current treatment guidelines recommending SSRIs as 
the first-line medication for panic disorder (Baldwin et al., 2014) 
until robust data regarding the comparative efficacy and tolera-
bility of propranolol versus SSRIs become available.

With  regard  to  the  therapeutic  effects  of  propranolol,  it  has 
been proposed that propranolol’s anxiolytic properties may result 
from  its  peripheral  (autonomic)  rather  than  its  central  activity 
(Balon et al., 1990; Clark, 1986; Roy-Byrne et al., 2006). This 
may explain the lack of evidence for propranolol’s efficacy in the 
long-term treatment of anxiety disorders other than panic disor-
der.  To  this  end,  it  seems  most  likely  that  propranolol  aids  in 
breaking a vicious cycle of anxiety in which catastrophic misap-
praisal of bodily sensations of orthosympathetic origin, such as 

138

palpitations or increased ventilation, fuel the occurrence of panic 
attacks. This explanation is supported by research that found that 
subjects  suffering  from  high  levels  of  general  trait  anxiety 
improved little on propranolol (Becker, 1976; Kathol et al., 1980; 
Meibach et al., 1987; Wheatley, 1969), whereas more favourable 
effects were found in the treatment of performance anxieties, in 
which  enhanced  sensitivity  for  adrenergic  hyperactivation  may 
similarly  initiate  the  fear  response  (Brantigan  et  al.,  1982; 
Brewer, 1972; Clark and Agras, 1991; Drew et al., 1985; Elman 
et al., 1998; Stone et al., 1973).

The present systematic review was limited by the moderate 
number of small studies examining the effects of propranolol on 
anxiety disorders, and by the risk of bias these trials presented. 
Notably, the average loss to follow-up was nearly one-fifth of all 
participants. As  withdrawal  reasons  were  seldom  reported,  the 
possibility  of  selective  loss  to  follow-up  in  some  studies  could 
not be ruled out.

In conclusion, the quality of evidence for the efficacy of pro-
pranolol  at  present  is  insufficient  to  support  the  routine  use  of 
propranolol in the treatment of any of the anxiety disorders.
