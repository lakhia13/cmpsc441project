Abstract
Background  SHANK2 disorder is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a deletion or pathogenic sequence 
variant of the SHANK2 gene and is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), and 
developmental delay. To date, research in SHANK2 has focused on laboratory-based in vivo and in vitro studies with 
few prospective clinical studies in humans.

Methods  A remote assessment battery was comprised of caregiver interviews with a psychiatrist, psychologists, and 
a genetic counselor, caregiver-reports, and review of records. Results from this cohort were reported using descriptive 
statistics. An age-matched sample of participants with SHANK3 haploinsufficiency (Phelan-McDermid syndrome, PMS) 
was used to compare adaptive behavior between the two groups.

Results  All ten participants demonstrated delays in adaptive behavior, with most motor skills preserved and a 
weakness in communication. According to parent report, 90% of participants carried a formal diagnosis of ASD, 
50% of participants carried a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and mild-to-moderate 
developmental delays were noted. Sensory hyperreactivity and seeking behaviors were more pronounced 
than sensory hyporeactivity. Medical features included hypotonia, recurrent ear infections, and gastrointestinal 
abnormalities. No similar facial dysmorphic features were observed. Compared to PMS participants, individuals with 
SHANK2 disorder had significantly higher adaptive functioning.

Conclusions  Consistent with previous studies of SHANK2 disorder, these results indicate mild to moderate 
developmental impairment. Overall, SHANK2 disorder is associated with developmental and adaptive functioning 
delays, high rates of autism, including sensory symptoms and repetitive behaviors, and ADHD. This study was limited 
by its remote nature, diverse age range, and the homogeneous racial and ethnic sample. Future studies should 
examine larger, diverse cohorts, add cognitive testing, capture longitudinal data, and include in-person assessments.

Background
Over the past decade there has been a significant increase 
in the use and utility of genetic testing in cases of intel-
lectual and developmental disorders [1–7]. To date, more 
than  250  high  confidence  genes  associated  with  autism 
spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  [7–10]  and  other  neurodevel-
opmental  disabilities  such  as  intellectual  disability  (ID) 
[11–14] have been identified. SHANK2 is one such gene.

SHANK2  is  part  of  the  SHANK  gene  family,  which 
organizes  intermediate  scaffolding  proteins  at  excit-
atory  synapses  and  are  categorized  as  master  scaffold-
ing  proteins  [15]  responsible  for  the  structural  integrity 
of  dendritic  spines  in  the  postsynaptic  density  [16]. The 
SHANK family is involved in activity at the postsynaptic 
sites  of  excitatory  synapses  in  the  brain.  Loss  of  func-
tion of SHANK2 is associated with synaptic dysfunction 
[16].  Other  proteins  in  the  SHANK  gene  family  include 
SHANK1  and  SHANK3.  SHANK3  deficiency  leads  to  a 
neurodevelopmental  disorder  known  as  Phelan-McDer-
mid  syndrome  (PMS).  PMS  is  associated  with  high 
rates  of  intellectual  and  developmental  disability  (IDD), 
autism,  sensory  symptoms,  hypotonia,  neuropsychiat-
ric  symptoms,  and  a  number  of  medical  comorbidities 
[17–21].

The  knockout  of  SHANK2  in  mice  has  been  used  to 
create  a  model  for  neuropsychiatric  symptoms  includ-
ing ASD [22–29]. There are several variants of SHANK2 
mouse  models  with  phenotypic  differences  based  on 
which cell types the SHANK2 deletion occurs in and the 
exon  knockout  location  [28–31].  Observed  phenotypes 
include enhanced fear causing behavioral inflexibility [22, 
27],  hyperactivity  [30–31],  repetitive  grooming  [30–31] 
or  jumping  behaviors  [25],  and  sensory  hyperreactiv-
ity [24]. Some previous preclinical studies experimented 
with molecular interventions to compensate for the loss 
of SHANK2. For example, improvement in social interac-
tion in a SHANK2 mouse model was reported after glu-
tamate modulation [25]. Similarly, Chung and colleagues 
[26]  observed  that  when  early  development  N-methyl-
D-aspartate  glutamate  receptor  (NMDAR)  hyperfunc-
tion  was  suppressed,  later  NMDAR  hypofunction  and 
ASD-like  behaviors  decreased.  In  addition  to  autism, 
the SHANK2 gene has also been associated with schizo-
phrenic behaviors [32] and decreased bone mass [33] in 
animal models.

To  date,  research  in  SHANK2  has  focused  on  in 
vivo  and  in  vitro  studies  with  limited  clinical  studies  in 
humans.  Prior  clinical  research  includes  small  cohort 
studies of one to three participants [34–36] and gene dis-
covery  studies  where  participants  with  SHANK2  were 

identified  [37–42].  Two  recent  publications  reviewed 
the literature and collated these small cohorts with their 
own as a comparison [43–44]. The largest was a literature 
review  of  13  previously  identified  cases  along  with  one 
additional  participant  [44].  When  reported,  all  patients 
had  mild  to  moderate  ID  and  language  delays,  92%  had 
ASD or autism traits, and 20% had difficulties with atten-
tion  or  sleep  disorders  [44].  Outside  of  these  distinc-
tions, there was a noted variability in the understanding 
of  the  SHANK2  clinical  phenotype  from  smaller  cohort 
studies [44], indicating the need for additional studies in 
larger cohorts. No studies to date have compared pheno-
types  of  SHANK2  disorder  with  that  of  PMS  (SHANK3 
haploinsufficiency).

Previous  literature  relied  on  case  reports  and  chart 
review  with  very 
limited  prospective  phenotyping. 
Here,  we  present  the  results  of  a  prospective,  remote-
based clinical phenotyping study in ten participants with 
SHANK2  disorder.  This  study  was  the  first  to  include  a 
larger, systematically evaluated cohort of individuals with 
the  disorder.  We  included  assessments  that  covered  a 
wide range of domains and phenotypic features in accor-
dance  with  the  recommendations  from  AlMail  and  col-
leagues  [45],  which  outlined  the  recommended  battery 
for  reporting  a  new  rare  genetic  disorder.  Following  the 
success  of  a  remote  battery  used  at  our  Center  to  phe-
notype  CHAMP1  syndrome  [46],  this  battery  of  assess-
ments was administered remotely as well. This approach 
removed  barriers  to  participation  and  allowed  us  to 
include individuals from multiple countries.

Methods
Participants

Ten  participants  between  the  ages  of  3  to  25  years 
(Mage = 9.7 ± 6.7)  enrolled  in  this  study.  All  participants 
were white, non-Hispanic, and most were female (n = 7). 
Study  recruitment  was  advertised  by  the  Seaver  Autism 
Center  and  by  the  SHANK2  Foundation  and  caregivers 
contacted  the  study  team  directly  to  participate.  Inclu-
sion  criteria  included  a  confirmed  pathogenic  or  likely 
pathogenic deletion or sequence variant in SHANK2 and 
the ability for a caregiver to read and understand English. 
All  eligible  participants  who  contacted  the  study  team 
were  included  in  the  study. The  caregiver’s  primary  lan-
guage was not assessed. Table 1; Fig. 1 provide the genetic 
landscape  for  this  sample.  This  study  was  approved  by 
the Program for the Protection of Human Subjects at the 
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

Materials

To facilitate the study of this ultra-rare disorder, a remote 
phenotypic protocol was applied [46]. All caregiver inter-
views  were  conducted  using  HIPAA-compliant  Zoom. 
Caregiver questionnaires were completed via REDCap or 
on scoring platforms provided directly by the publisher.

Skill  development  and  loss  was  assessed  by  the  Early 
Skills Attainment and Loss caregiver interview, a measure 
focusing  on  regression  [47].  This  instrument  measured 
Language,  Motor,  Social,  and  Adaptive  skill  attainment 
and  loss.  If  a  skill  was  attained,  the  interviewer  either 
asked  if  the  skill  was  attained  by  age  1,  or  the  specific 
month at which it was attained. Skill loss was defined as 
the discontinuation of a skill that was previously obtained 
and used consistently for at least 3 months. Developmen-
tal milestones were analyzed by comparison to Center for 
Disease Control (CDC) guidelines, as reported in Zubler 
et al. [48].

Psychiatric and medical history were assessed by a psy-
chiatrist (DEG) through a structured caregiver interview. 
Participants  were  present  for  a  portion  of  the  interview 
for virtual observation. Dysmorphology was assessed by 
caregiver report using a standardized list of dysmorphic

features and analysis of front and side profile photos by a 
certified genetic counselor and trainee (TL, RG).

The Developmental Profile, Fourth Edition (DP-4; [49]), 
is a caregiver interview that obtained estimates of devel-
opmental  functioning  across  Physical,  Adaptive  Behav-
ior,  Social-Emotional,  Cognitive,  and  Communication 
domains. Standard scores could not be obtained for one 
participant who was out of the normed age range.

The  Vineland  Adaptive  Behavior  Scales,  3rd  Edition, 
Comprehensive  Interview  (Vineland-3;  [50]),  assessed 
adaptive  behavior  through  caregiver  interview  across 
Communication,  Daily  Living  Skills,  Socialization,  and 
Motor  domains.  Standard  scores  are  available  across  all 
ages,  but  only  for  participants  nine  and  younger  on  the 
Motor domain.

Sensory  symptomatology  was  assessed  with  the  Sen-
sory  Assessment  for  Neurodevelopmental  Disorders 
(SAND;  [51])  for  Hyperreactivity,  Hyporeactivity,  and 
Seeking  behaviors  across  visual,  tactile,  and  auditory 
modalities; and with the Sensory Profile Caregiver Ques-
tionnaire  (SP;  [52])  assessing  the  following  domains: 
Auditory,  Visual,  Touch,  Taste/Smell,  Activity  Level, 
Body  Position,  Emotional/Social,  and  Movement  Pro-
cessing across four quadrants: Low Registration, Seeking, 
Sensitivity,  and  Avoidance.  Due  to  the  remote  nature  of 
the  study,  only  the  interview  portion  of  the  SAND  was 
conducted  with  the  caregiver,  and  the  observation  was 
omitted.

The  Child/Adult  Behavior  Checklist  (CBCL/ABCL; 
[53])  assessed  caregiver-reported  behaviors.  Domains 
included  Syndrome  Scales,  Internalizing,  Externaliz-
ing,  Total  Problems,  and  DSM-Oriented  Scales.  Three 
caregivers  completed  the  CBCL  for  ages  1.5  to  5,  six 
completed the CBCL for ages 6 to 18, and one caregiver 
completed the ABCL for ages 18 and older. Subdomains 
assessed differed by form completed.

The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC; [54]) is a care-
giver  report  questionnaire  that  assessed  maladaptive 
behaviors within five domains: Irritability, Lethargy, Ste-
reotypy,  Hyperactivity,  and  Inappropriate  Speech.  The 
frequency  and  severity  of  repetitive  behaviors  was  mea-
sured  by  caregiver  report  using  the  Repetitive  Behavior 
Scale,  Revised  (RBS-R;  [55])  across  the  following  scales:

Quality  of  Life  and  Caregiver  Concerns  were  assessed 
using  a  Visual  Analogue  Scale  (VAS)  where  caregiv-
ers  list  their  top  three  concerns  for  the  participant  and 
rate how concerned they were about these items from 1 
to  100;  and  using  the  Child  and  Family  Quality  of  Life, 
Second  Edition  (CFQL;  [56]),  capturing  the  caregiver’s 
perspective of their child’s and their own quality of life. It 
includes the following domains: Child, Family, Caregiver, 
Financial,  Social,  Relationship,  Coping,  and  Changes  in 
Quality of Life.

The battery included validated and unvalidated assess-
ments.  Most  of  the  assessments  were  published  vali-
dated  measures  including  the  DP-4,  Vineland-3,  SP, 
CBCL/ABCL,  ABC,  RBS-R,  and  CFQL.  One  published 
standardized  assessment,  the  SAND,  includes  both  a 
caregiver  interview  and  direct  observation  of  the  child, 
however, due to the remote nature of the study, the direct 
observation was omitted; therefore, only raw scores were 
produced  from  the  interview.  Three  assessments  were 
not  validated  but  have  been  used  in  similar  populations 
including  the  Early  Skills,  the  structured  psychiatric 
evaluation, and the VAS. The assessments selected were 
recently  successfully  used  in  a  prior  remote  battery  of 
an IDD sample [46] and were considered appropriate for 
remote use.

Comparison to SHANK3 cohort

Overall adaptive functioning in the SHANK2 cohort was 
compared  to  an  age-matched  group  of  individuals  with 
PMS  (N = 62,  Mage = 9.64,  SD = 5.52,  range = 3–24  years) 
which included a subset of individuals participating in a 
natural history study through the Developmental Synap-
topathies Consortium.

Results
Early skill development

Early  skill  development  and  loss,  assessed  by  the  early 
skill attainment and loss survey and clinician interview, is 
summarized in Tables 2 and 3.

Language  milestones  were  delayed  in  all  participants. 
Seven participants used full sentences or phrases of three 
or more words. Of those, five used full complex sentences 
with  appropriate  grammar  and  two  used  phrases  and 
combined more than three words. One five-year-old par-
ticipant used two-word phrases; one three-year-old used 
single  words;  and  one  three-year-old  was  babbling  but 
had  not  yet  said  a  first  word.  Importantly,  participants 
who had not yet developed fluent speech were below the 
average age of achievement in this cohort (∼ 5y). Articu-
lation problems were reported in six of ten participants.

Using the CDC guidelines for skill development, which 
are  set  at  the  developmental  age  of  the  75th  percentile 
[48], two of the three motor milestones with CDC recom-
mended checkpoints were delayed on average across par-
ticipants.  Specifically,  44%  of  participants  were  delayed 
rolling over, 20% were delayed in sitting without support, 
and 60% were delayed taking independent steps. No loss 
of motor skills was reported.

Seven  participants  obtained  bladder  and  bowel  con-
trol.  Delays  were  present  for  both.  On  average,  bowel 
control  was  obtained  before  bladder  control.  Skill  loss 
was  reported  in  one  participant.  The  oldest  participant 
lost  bladder  control  at  24.5  years  and  had  not  regained 
the  skill,  though  bowel  control  remained.  The  caregiver 
reported these and other declines during the COVID-19 
pandemic and attributed them to a lack of structure and 
engagement in daily activities. Daily living skills generally 
improved when returning to a structured schedule.

Psychiatric & medical history

Nine  participants  carried  a  Diagnostic  and  Statisti-
cal  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fifth  Edition  (DSM-
5;  [58])  diagnosis  of  ASD.  Deficits  in  social/emotional 
reciprocity,  nonverbal  communication,  and  stereotyped 
behaviors were reported in all nine of those participants. 
Seven  caregivers  reported  symptoms  of  attention-defi-
cit  and  hyperactivity,  including  six  with  inattention  and 
impulsivity  and  five  with  hyperactivity.  Five  participants 
carried  a  diagnosis  of  attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder  (ADHD):  one  with  inattentive  type,  one  with 
hyperactive-impulsive type, two with combined type, and 
the  remaining  participant  was  uncategorized.  One  indi-
vidual was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder 
(OCD). Previous diagnoses of ID and global developmen-
tal delay were not directly ascertained.

Five participants took psychotropic medications in the 
past  and  two  were  actively  taking  medication.  Of  those 
on medication at the time of the evaluation, one was on

guanfacine for ADHD and the other was on both traza-
done  and  clonidine  for  sleep.  Regarding  prior  medica-
tions, methylphenidate for ADHD, two unnamed ADHD 
stimulants,  and  aripiprazole  were  all  reportedly  stopped 
due  to  side  effects.  Fluoxetine  was  prescribed  for  OCD 
but was stopped due to ineffectiveness. Lithium was tried 
for  mood  and  discontinued  in  one  participant  due  to 
challenges in achieving appropriate blood levels, and one 
participant  lisdexamfetamine  and  guanfacine  extended 
release were both stopped due to intolerability.

Medical history is summarized in Table 4. Four partici-
pants had tympanostomy. Two participants had a history 
of hearing problems reported: one due to increased fluid 
and another due to multiple ear infections. Both partici-
pants’ hearing returned to normal after correcting these 
issues. One participant had a single febrile seizure at age 
2 reported, but no presence of subsequent seizures.

Dysmorphology

Dysmorphic  features  were  reported  by  caregivers  and 
identified  through  images  provided.  Most  dysmorphic 
features  were  only  noted  in  one  participant  each.  Four 
participants  had  a  high  frontotemporal  hairline.  Three 
participants  had  full  cheeks,  two  had  an  overbite,  and 
two  had  a  long  philtrum.  The  following  features  were 
present  in  one  participant  each:  micrognathia,  bulbous 
nose, full lips, hyperextensibility, sacral dimple, and fifth 

finger  clinodactyly.  Similar  facial  gestalts  were  not  seen 
in the cohort.

Cognitive and adaptive functioning

DP-4  (Table  5)  Physical  domain  standard  scores  ranged 
from  47  (delayed)  to  101  (average).  Adaptive  Behavior 
standard  scores  ranged  from  53  (delayed)  to  88  (aver-
age). Social-Emotional Skills standard scores range from 
57  (delayed)  to  78  (below  average).  The  Cognitive  sub-
domain  standard  scores  ranged  from  47  (delayed)  to 
77  (below  average).  The  Communication  subdomain 
standard  scores  ranged  from  51  (delayed)  to  79  (below 
average).

Vineland-3  Adaptive  Behavior  Composite  standard 
scores  ranged  from  20  to  72  (Table  6).  The  Communi-
cation  domain  had  the  lowest  average  standard  score 
among  all  domains.  Six  participants  had  significantly 
higher  subdomain  scores  in  the  Receptive  subdomain 
compared  to  the  Expressive  subdomain  (> 1SD  differ-
ence),  two  participants  had  no  difference,  and  one  par-
ticipant had a significantly higher Expressive subdomain 
scores  than  Receptive.  All  participants  were  reported  to 
understand at least 50 words and eight participants said 
at least 50 words and used phrases with a noun and verb. 
Six  participants  were  reported  to  identify  all  letters  in 
lower  and  upper  case,  five  could  read  at  least  10  words, 
four could read simple sentences out loud, and two could

While  seven  had  bladder  and  bowel  control,  only  four 
used  the  bathroom  completely  independently,  and  only 
two shower or bathe independently. In the Socialization 
domain,  scores  across  Interpersonal  Relationship,  Play 
and Leisure, and Coping Skills fell within the low range. 
Finally,  standard  scores  for  the  Motor  domain  were  cal-
culated  for  the  six  participants  within  the  age  range  to 
calculate  normed  scores.  Motor  skills  represent  a  rela-
tive strength of this cohort compared to performance on 
other domains, however, both fine and gross motor skills 
remain delayed relative to age expectations.

Sensory symptomatology

Sensory  symptoms  were  evaluated  using  the  SAND 
interview  and  the  SP.  Sensory  Seeking  behaviors  were 
most  common  (7.8 ± 4.6),  followed  by  Hyperreactivity 
(5.6 ± 2.7), and Hyporeactivity (3.3 ± 3.5). The most com-
monly  reported  Sensory  Seeking  behaviors  were  creat-
ing  sounds  outside  of  functional  play  (6/10),  seeking 
pressure  including  pushing  objects  to  self  or  mouthing 
(6/10),  peering  at  or  inspecting  parts  of  toys  near  their 
eyes (5/10), fascination with certain textures (5/10), feel-
ing  textures  repeatedly  (5/10),  and  fascination  with  cer-
tain sounds (5/10). The most commonly reported sensory 
Hyperreactivity  behaviors  were  startling  or  being  both-
ered  by  certain  sounds  (6/10)  and  putting  their  hands 
over  their  ears  (5/10).  The  most  commonly  reported 
sensory  Hyporeactivity  behaviors  were  under-respon-
siveness  to  bright  or  flickering  lights  (4/10)  and  under-
responsiveness to temperature and/or pain (4/10).

On  the  SP,  Low  Registration  scores  (51.5 ± 7.1)  indi-
cated  a  definite  difference  in  sensory  processing,  with 
nine  participants  scoring  in  the  definite  and  one  in  the 
probable  difference  range.  Sensation  Seeking  scores 
(90.7 ± 12.3)  indicated  a  definite  difference  with  six  par-
ticipants  falling  in  the  definite  and  one  in  the  probable 
difference  range.  Sensory  Sensitivity  scores  (75.6 ± 8.8) 
indicated  a  probable  difference  in  sensory  process-
ing, with four participants in the definite and two in the 
probable  difference  range.  Sensation  Avoiding  scores 
(106 ± 9.5)  indicated  a  probable  difference,  with  three 
participants scoring in the definite and five in the prob-
able difference range.

Behavioral symptomatology

Average  T-scores  from  the  CBCL  indicated  that  With-
drawn Behaviors and Attention Problems fell in the clini-
cal range. Autism Spectrum, ADHD Symptoms, Activity 
Participation,  School  Participation,  Social  Participation, 
Thought Problems, and Critical Items all fell in the bor-
derline  range.  Of  the  ten  participants,  50%  were  in  the 
clinical range for Attention Problems and ADHD Symp-
toms  and  of  the  seven  assessed  for  thought  problems, 
57% were in the clinical range. Those in the clinical range 
matched the prevalence of participants who met criteria 
for  ADHD  when  assessed  in  the  psychiatric  evaluation. 
However,  thought  problems  were  not  noted  or  brought 
up by caregivers as a concern during the psychiatric eval-
uation  and  when  analyzing  individual  items,  the  most 
commonly  endorsed  items  in  the  Thought  Problems 
domain  were  related  to  ritualistic  and  repetitive  behav-
iors (RRBs) and likely reflect autism symptomology.

Average scores on the ABC domains were 9.9 ± 6.8 for 
Irritability (45 maximum score), 3.1 ± 3.2 for Social With-
drawal  (48  maximum  score),  3.3 ± 2.7  for  Stereotypy  (21 
maximum score), 15.3 ± 11.3 for Hyperactivity (48 maxi-
mum  score),  and  2.8 ± 1.9  for  Inappropriate  Speech  (12 
maximum score). At the individual item level, nine care-
givers reported distractibility. Eight reported temper tan-
trums,  inattention,  disturbing  others,  impatience,  and 
impulsivity. Seven caregivers also reported stamping feet 
or slamming doors, disrupting group activities, repetitive 
speech, and stereotyped behaviors.

On the RBS-R, difficulty with transitions was endorsed 
by  all  ten  caregivers.  Seven  caregivers  endorsed  sensory 
features  and  specific  interests.  The  Average  Total  Score 
was 20.4 ± 14.3 with a range between 1 and 47 points out 
of a maximum total of 129. The subscale scores were as 
follows: Stereotyped Behavior (3.7 ± 4.2) out of 18 points, 
Insistence on Sameness (6.2 ± 3.9) out of 33 points, Ritu-
alistic  Behavior  (3.1 ± 3.2)  out  of  18  points,  Restricted 
Behaviors (1.9 ± 1.7) out of 12 points, Compulsive Behav-
ior (3.1 ± 3.9) out of 24 points, and Self-Injurious Behav-
iors (2.4 ± 2.9) out of 24 points.

Quality of life and caregiver concerns

Caregiver  reports  on  the  VAS  identified  eight  catego-
ries of concern. Each caregiver reported three concerns, 
totaling 30 reports (Fig. 2). The most frequently reported 
concerns  were  cognitive  and  educational  ability  and 
ADHD  features  totaling  6  responses  each.  A  number  of 
behaviors were reported as top concerns including com-
munication,  social  skills,  independence,  RRBs,  and  self-
injury. Figure 2. Visual Analogue Scale Results.

Using the CFQL, quality of life was assessed in 8 cate-
gories. Scores in each subdomain ranged from 1 to 5 and 
were calculated as a within-participants average for each 
of  3  or  4  questions  in  that  subdomain.  Based  on  overall 
average scores in each category, where lower score indi-
cate  less  strain,  caregivers  rated  Relationship  Quality  of 
Life  highest  (M = 1.95)  followed  by  Financial  (M = 2.40), 
Caregiver  (M = 2.65),  Social  Network  (M = 2.65),  Cop-
ing  (M = 2.70),  Child  (M = 2.85),  Changes  to  Quality  of 
Life  (M = 2.94),  and  Family  Quality  of  Life  (3.53).  The 
questions  indicating  the  most  strain,  were  the  partici-
pant  requiring  reminders  to  complete  everyday  tasks 
(4.1 ± 0.99),  adding  stress  to  home  life  (4.1 ± 1.29),  and 
limiting  the  family  from  participating  in  social  activities 
(3.6 ± 1.17).

Comparison to SHANK3 cohort

Compared  to  an  age-matched  group  of  individuals  with 
PMS,  standard  scores  on  all  Vineland-3  domains  were 
significantly higher in the SHANK2 cohort (Table 7). The 
SHANK2  cohort  also  had  smaller  ranges  of  scores  on 
adaptive functioning than the PMS cohort.

Discussion
Here  we  present  the  first  prospective  evaluation  of  a 
cohort of individuals with SHANK2 disorder. The battery 
was  comprised  of  caregiver  interviews  with  a  psychia-
trist,  psychologists,  and  a  genetic  counselor,  caregiver 
forms, and review of records. Given the rarity of the syn-
drome,  all  data  was  collected  remotely  to  enable  enroll-
ment  across  geographic  regions.  The  comprehensive 
battery  measured  developmental  level,  psychiatric  his-
tory,  medical  history,  and  behavioral  features,  taking 
guidance from the standards for phenotyping a new rare 
genetic syndrome set forth in AlMail and colleagues [45].
Results  revealed  some  delays  in  motor  and  language 
milestones.  Varying  levels  of  expressive  language  were 
reported  with  seven  of  ten  participants  having  a  mini-
mum  of  phrase  speech  by  approximately  5.5  years  old; 
the  remaining  three  participants  were  all  younger  than 
this  age  and  therefore  their  developmental  trajectory 
is  not  yet  known.  Importantly,  and  in  contrast  to  PMS, 
there  was  no  reported  loss  of  skills,  with  the  exception 
of  toileting  in  one  participant  at  the  age  of  24,  which

Results  from  the  DP-4  indicate  relatively  preserved 
Physical  development,  similar  to  results  from  the  Early 
Skill  interview  and  Vineland-3  Motor  domains,  how-
ever,  all  scores  remained  below  age  expectations.  Past 

literature has found that motor skills are more impaired 
in  individuals  with  single  gene  conditions  than  idio-
pathic autism [59]. While motor skills were less impaired 
than  other  areas  in  this  cohort,  the  level  of  delays  here 
are  consistent  with  monogenic  conditions  associated 
with  neurodevelopmental  disorders.  The  other  domains 
(Communication,  Cognition,  Social-Emotional,  Adap-
tive) revealed scores approximately 2 standard deviations 
below  the  population  mean,  falling  in  the  significantly 
impaired range. On the Vineland-3, Communication was 
a  relative  weakness,  with  average  scores  a  full  standard 
deviation lower than the other domain scores, reflecting 
slightly  different  aspects  of  communication  compared 
to the DP-4, and mirroring results of previous SHANK2 
literature  [43–44].  Within  the  Communication  domain,

Notably,  unlike  other  genetic  syndromes,  including 
PMS, no participants had epilepsy. There was one febrile 
seizure  reported  and  no  other  seizures  reported.  No 
similar  facial  dysmorphic  features  were  observed  on 
examination. The only relatively consistent finding was a 
high frontotemporal hairline in four participants.

When  comparing  this  cohort  to  an  age-matched  sam-
ple  of  PMS  participants,  the  Vineland-3  was  used  as  an 
overall  proxy  of  functioning.  Individuals  with  SHANK2 
disorder  had  significantly  higher  adaptive  functioning 
compared to those with PMS. Though these genes belong 
to  the  same  family  and  hold  similar  roles  as  scaffolding 
proteins, results from this study suggest loss of SHANK3 
may  be  more  detrimental  to  human  development  than 
SHANK2.  Larger,  studies  are  necessary  to  replicate  this 
exploratory analysis.

This study was limited by its remote nature, where par-
ticipants  were  not  assessed  directly.  Cognitive  testing 
would be a valuable addition to future studies. As with all 
studies involving genetic disorders, sample bias is at play, 
where  often  only  individuals  who  present  with  severe 
developmental  delays  are  referred  for  genetic  testing. 
Individuals with more mild features may not be referred 
for  genetic  testing,  and  therefore,  results  may  not  fully 
capture the full spectrum of SHANK2 disorder. Similarly, 
the  prevalence  of  ASD  reported  in  this  cohort  may  be 
higher  because  the  presence  of  ASD  resulted  in  obtain-
ing genetic testing. Therefore, there was likely a selection 
bias based on this. The wide age range is another limita-
tion  of  this  study  and  age  effects  are  difficult  to  capture 
in  such  a  small  cohort.  All  participants  were  white  with 
constrained  racial  and  ethnic  diversity,  which  further 
limits  generalizability  of  results.  Additionally,  while  we 
predicted a 50/50 sex ratio, there were more females than 
males in this cohort. We do not believe this is due to an 
underlying sex difference in SHANK2 disorder, rather an 
outcome of a small study. This study also did not directly 
assess autism in this sample, which would have required 
an  in-person  visit.  Therefore,  the  conclusions  drawn 
about  autism  symptomology  are  based  upon  parent 
reporting  rather  than  clinician  observation  and  may  be 
biased. Finally, the comparison of SHANK2 to PMS was 
limited in its scope, comparing only the Vineland-3. The 
addition  of  cognitive  measures  in  the  SHANK2  cohort 
would  allow  for  more  robust  conclusions  to  be  drawn 
comparing  these  two  genetically  related  groups.  Future 
research should be conducted in person to further assess 
autism symptoms in SHANK2 disorder and how they dif-
fer from idiopathic autism using gold-standard diagnos-
tic assessments.

receptive  language  was  reported  as  significantly  better 
developed as a cohort than expressive language, suggest-
ing the participants can understand more than they can 
express  verbally.  However,  there  were  two  participants 
who  did  not  show  this  discrepancy  in  scores,  and  one 
who  had  significantly  better  expressive  than  receptive 
language,  indicating  variability  in  language  skills  within 
our  sample.  Overall,  Vineland-3  Composite  scores,  on 
average,  fell  between  2  and  3  standard  deviations  below 
the  population  mean.  Though  cognitive  abilities  and 
ID  status  were  not  directly  assessed,  it  is  estimated  that 
based  on  the  adaptive  behavior  measures,  most  partici-
pants are likely to meet criteria for ID.

In  terms  of  neurodevelopmental,  psychiatric,  and 
behavioral features, 90% of participants carried a formal 
diagnosis of autism, replicating the prevalence of the two 
previous  SHANK2  studies  [43–44].  Whether  the  rate  of 
autism  in  SHANK2  disorder  is  truly  this  high,  or  if  this 
represents  a  sample  bias  given  autism  is  often  a  reason 
for  referral  for  genetic  testing,  is  unclear.  Future  studies 
with  larger  cohorts,  recruited  from  a  variety  of  sources, 
may  help  clarify  autism  prevalence  in  this  disorder.  The 
CBCL  captured  withdrawn  behaviors  well.  Conversely, 
Social Withdrawal behaviors were generally not endorsed 
on  the  ABC.  Restricted  and  repetitive  behaviors  were 
endorsed  with  the  RBS-R,  picking  up  many  symptoms, 
most  notably  stereotypic  behaviors.  Sensory  behaviors 
were also commonly endorsed using the SAND interview 
and the Sensory Profile. The SAND identified a pattern of 
higher seeking and hyperreactivity compared to hypore-
activity, results that are opposite to those found in indi-
viduals  with  PMS  (SHANK3)  [20].  Symptoms  of  ADHD 
were commonly reported, and five participants carried a 
formal diagnosis of ADHD. The CBCL captured attention 
problems well although items on the ABC Hyperactivity 
domain  were  endorsed  at  a  lower  rate  than  in  the  psy-
chological evaluation given the high rate of ADHD in the 
cohort,  again  indicating  the  CBCL  may  be  performing 
better  than  the  ABC  in  this  cohort.  Though  most  care-
giver  surveys  chosen  for  this  study  have  been  used  and 
validated  in  IDD  populations,  some  do  not  always  per-
form well [60–62]. The measures here seemed to perform 
well, possibly due to the mild-to-moderate range in intel-
lectual delays estimated in this cohort compared to more 
severe delays seen in other disorders. In addition, though 
ADHD features were a commonly reported top concern, 
only  one  participant  was  currently  receiving  medication 
for  ADHD  symptoms;  this  lower-than-expected  use  of 
medication should be explored in future studies.

In  terms  of  medical  history,  commonly  reported  fea-
tures mirrored those of many genetic neurodevelopmen-
tal disorders such as hypotonia, recurrent ear infections, 
and gastrointestinal abnormalities [18, 46, 63–66]. Over-
all,  the  cohort  was  not  described  as  medically  complex. 

Silver et al. Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders           (2025) 17:25 Conclusions
Overall,  SHANK2  disorder  is  associated  with  develop-
mental and adaptive functioning impairments indicative 
of  a  likely  high  rate  of  ID,  high  rates  of  autism,  includ-
ing  sensory  symptoms  and  repetitive  behaviors,  and 
ADHD,  all  of  which  were  also  top  caregiver  concerns. 
Nonspecific  medical  comorbidities  were  reported  but 
individuals  were  not  described  as  medically  complex  or 
requiring  high  levels  of  medical  interventions.  Future 
studies should examine larger cohorts, capture longitudi-
nal data, and utilize in-person assessments.
