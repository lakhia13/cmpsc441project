Abstract
Background  Exercise has been identified as a promising non-pharmacological therapy for the management of 
depression, but there is still controversy over which type is most effective. We aimed to compare and rank the types of 
exercise that improve depression in postmenopausal women by quantifying information from randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs).

Methods  The PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, CNKI, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL 
Plus databases were searched to identify articles published from inception to 1 March 2024 reporting RCTs that 
examined the effectiveness of exercise on depression in postmenopausal women. The risk of bias was assessed using 
the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs. The quality of the evidence for each comparison was graded using the 
online confidence in network meta-analysis tool (CINeMA). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated 
using the mean and standard deviation of pre-to-post intervention changes and then pooled using a random 
effects model in a pairwise meta-analysis using Review Manager 5.4. Then, a frequentist network meta-analysis was 
conducted using a random effects model was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of different exercise types using the 
network package of Stata 15.

Results  This study included 26 studies involving 2,170 participants. The pairwise meta-analysis revealed that exercise 
had a significant positive effect on depression in postmenopausal women (SMD = -0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
= -0.94 to -0.48; I2 = 78%). The network meta-analysis revealed that mind-body exercise (SMD = -0.97, 95% CI = -1.28 
to -0.67), aerobic exercise (SMD = -0.58, 95% CI = -0.88 to -0.27) and multicomponent exercise (SMD = -0.57, 95% CI = 
-1.15 to -0.002) significantly reduced depression compared to the control intervention. Mind-body exercise had the 
highest probability of being the most effective intervention. Exercise interventions also showed positive effects on 
anxiety. Most studies were judged to have some concerns regarding their risk of bias, and the confidence in evidence 
was often very low according to CINeMA.

Conclusion  For postmenopausal women, there is very low to moderate quality evidence that exercise interventions 
are an effective antidepressant therapy, with mind-body exercise most likely being the optimal type.

Trial registration  This meta-analysis was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (registration number: 
CRD42024505425).

Introduction
Depression  is  acknowledged  as  a  leading  cause  of  dis-
ability  worldwide  [1,  2].  Current  diagnostic  guidelines 
and reports define it as a prolonged period of low mood 
or  loss  of  pleasure  or  interest  in  activities  [2],  possibly 
accompanied  by  persistent  symptoms  such  as  insomnia, 
fatigue, reduced self-efficacy and suicidal tendencies [3]. 
It often causes substantial suffering to patients and places 
a  significant  burden  on  their  families  and  society.  Even 
subthreshold depression can result in distress or disabil-
ity [4], and severe cases may lead to suicide [3].

Menopause  is  an  inevitable  and  critical  phase  in  the 
female  life  cycle  [5].  While  depression  occurs  in  all  age 
groups,  its  prevalence  is  notably  higher  in  women  dur-
ing  and  after  perimenopause  [6,  7].  A  large  meta-analy-
sis  showed  that  the  global  prevalence  of  depression  was 
33.9%  in  perimenopausal  women  and  34.9%  in  post-
menopausal women [8]. This increase is often attributed 
to  hormonal  fluctuations  in  estrogen  and  progesterone, 
sleep  disturbances,  and  heightened  stress  susceptibil-
ity  [4].  Ageing,  emerging  health  issues  and  changes  in 
family  dynamics  further  contribute  to  depression  [9]. 
Despite its significant impact on the health-related qual-
ity of life among postmenopausal women [10], the men-
tal  health  concerns  of  this  demographic  remain  largely 
unaddressed.

Common  clinical  treatments  for  depression  typically 
involve medication or hormone therapy and behavioural 
interventions  [11].  However,  these  interventions  often 
have known and unknown side effects [12], limited acces-
sibility  and  acceptance,  and  associated  stigma  [13].  The 
stigma associated with pharmacological and psychologi-
cal interventions may deter many from seeking treatment 
[14]. Notably, about two-thirds of adults with depression 
do  not  receive  adequate  care  [15],  increasing  to  three-
quarters  in  underdeveloped  regions  [16].  In  addition, 
approximately  one-third  of  patients  with  depression  do 
not  respond  to  multiple  approved  antidepressant  medi-
cations  [17].  Existing  research  indicates  that  postmeno-
pausal  women  tend  to  respond  less  to  antidepressants 
than  younger  women  [18].  Moreover,  pharmacological 
and psychological interventions often fail to address the 
physical  comorbidities  associated  with  depression  [19]. 
Therefore, while conventional treatments still require sig-
nificant attention and further research, there is a pressing 
need for more evidence-based treatments.

Exercise  is  often  defined  as  an  effective  complement 
or alternative to drugs and psychotherapy [20], noted for 
its  high  accessibility,  acceptability,  and  safety.  Due  to  its 
extensive  physiological  and  psychological  benefits,  the 
World  Health  Organization  recommends  it  for  diverse 
populations [21]. Research has shown that even physical 
activity  below  public  health  recommendations  can  yield 
significant mental health benefits [22]. A network meta-
analysis of over 200 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
showed that some exercise interventions may have more 
potent  antidepressant  effects  than  selective  serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors [20].

Given  its  benefits,  several  preliminary  studies  have 
explored  the  effects  of  exercise  interventions  in  post-
menopausal women [23–26]. Farzane et al. [24]. reported 
that eight weeks of pilates significantly improved depres-
sion  in  the  studied  population.  Similarly,  Gutiérrez  et 
al.  [25].  found  that  exercise  could  improve  depressive 
symptoms  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  depres-
sion. However, some studies have reported different find-
ings.  For  example,  Williams  et  al.  [26].  reported  that  12 
months  of  group  exercise  did  not  significantly  reduce 
depression  in  patients  compared  to  controls.  Addition-
ally, Afonso et al. [23]. discovered that yoga could signifi-
cantly  improve  patients’  depression,  whereas  stretching 
exercises (SE) could not.

The controversy over the effectiveness of exercise inter-
ventions  may  arise  from  several  factors.  Firstly,  differ-
ences  in  the  physiological  mechanisms  among  exercise 
interventions  can  lead  to  varied  effects  on  depression 
[20]. Secondly, the severity of depression may cause sig-
nificant differences in outcomes [27]. For example, stud-
ies  focusing  on  healthy  postmenopausal  women  with 
lower baseline levels of depression may encounter a floor 
effect [28]. Additionally, the different control groups used 
across studies [29], some of which may positively impact 
mental health, further complicate comparisons.

Unfortunately,  there  is  a  dearth  of  research  explor-
ing  the 
impact  of  exercise  on  depression  among 
postmenopausal women. In addition, the potential mod-
erating effects of baseline health status and intervention 
parameters  in  this  context  have  not  been  sufficiently 
studied.  Other  concerns  are  whether  improvements 
(assuming  effectiveness)  for  postmenopausal  women 
justify recommendation and whether the effects of vari-
ous  exercise  interventions  are  comparable.  The  lack  of

comprehensive systematic reviews on the effects of exer-
cise  on  depression  in  postmenopausal  women  impedes 
both  understanding  and  the  development  of  effective, 
evidence-based exercise prescriptions for this population.
In conclusion, there is an urgent need for a comprehen-
sive systematic review assessing the effects of exercise on 
depression  among  postmenopausal  women.  Moreover, 
given  the  variability  among  exercise  interventions  and 
the  inherent  limitations  in  pairwise  meta-analyses,  con-
ducting  a  network  meta-analysis  is  essential  to  discern 
the differential effects of various types of exercise. There-
fore,  this  study  had  two  aims.  First,  to  determine  the 
efficacy of exercise interventions in reducing depression 
levels in postmenopausal women and assess whether this 
efficacy  is  influenced  by  the  intervention  duration  and 
population  characteristics.  Second,  to  identify  the  opti-
mal  exercise  intervention  should  the  initial  intervention 
prove effective.

Methods
Data source and search strategy

This  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  was  prospec-
tively  registered  with  PROSPERO  (registration  num-
ber:  CRD42024505425)  and  is  reported  according  to 
the  updated  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic 
Reviews  and  Meta-Analyses  (PRISMA)  statement  [30] 
and  the  implementing  PRISMA  in  Exercise,  Rehabilita-
tion,  Sports  Medicine  and  Sports  Science  (PERSiST) 
guidelines  [31].  The  PRISMA  checklist  is  available  in 
Supplemental Material 1.

The  following  online  databases  were  searched  from 
their  inception  to  1  March  2024:  PubMed,  Web  of  Sci-
ence,  SPORTDiscus,  China  National  Knowledge  Infra-
structure  (CNKI),  The  Cochrane  Library,  PsycINFO, 
EMBASE  and  CINAHL  Plus.  The  search  strategy  was 
constructed  using  a  combination  of  medical  subject 
heading  (MeSH)  terms  and  their  synonyms.  The  MeSH 
terms included postmenopause, exercise, depression and 
randomized controlled trial. The synonyms for each term 
were selected and added to the search strategy based on 
their frequency of occurrence in specific databases. Bool-
ean logic operators were used to link these terms, and the 
search  strategy  was  customised  for  each  database’s  spe-
cific requirements. The complete search strategy, applied 
across all databases, is detailed in Supplemental Material 
2.  Additionally,  the  references  of  meta-analyses  on  rele-
vant topics were thoroughly searched to ensure the inclu-
sion of all articles meeting the study criteria.

Study selection and eligibility criteria

Articles  identified  in  the  electronic  databases  were 
imported into the EndNote software (version 20.0; Clari-
vate,  Philadelphia,  PA,  USA)  to  facilitate  the  removal 
of  duplicates.  Next,  two  researchers  (BH  and  YYD) 

independently  assessed  their  titles  and  abstracts  for 
potential  inclusion. Then,  they  screened  the  full  texts  of 
relevant  articles  against  the  study’s  specified  inclusion 
and  exclusion  criteria  to  identify  those  to  be  included 
in  the  analyses.  Any  discrepancies  in  study  selection 
between  the  two  researchers  were  resolved  through 
discussion.

The  Population, 

Intervention,  Comparison,  Out-
comes,  and  Study  Design  (PICOS)  framework  was  used 
to structure the eligibility criteria. Studies eligible for this 
meta-analysis were RCTs (1) examining postmenopausal 
women  without  hormone  therapy,  any  types  of  cancer, 
regular  exercise  habits  or  other  comorbid  conditions 
that may affect cognitive function; (2) examining at least 
one of the five exercise intervention arms of interest (SE, 
aerobic  exercise  [AE],  resistance  training  [RT],  mind-
body exercise [MBE] and multicomponent exercise [ME]) 
implemented for at least four weeks; (3) including a non-
exercise  control  group  (e.g.  usual  care,  wait-list  control 
conditions  or  health  education)  or  comparing  two  of 
the  exercise  interventions  of  interest  (only  included  in 
the  network  meta-analysis);  (4)  examining  the  pre-post 
effects  of  exercise  interventions  on  depression  using  a 
validated scale; and (5) published in English or Chinese.

Outcomes

The primary outcome assessed in this study was depres-
sion, a common mental disorder. Since anxiety is a com-
mon  comorbidity  of  depression  and  shares  numerous 
symptoms with it [3, 32], we designated anxiety as a sec-
ondary outcome measure.

Coding

The  characteristics  of  the  interventions  were  appropri-
ately coded based on physiological mechanisms and pat-
terns.  This  article  categorised  exercise  into  five  broad 
types:  SE,  AE,  RT,  MBE,  and  ME.  Detailed  descriptions 
of each type of exercise intervention are provided in Sup-
plemental  Material  3.  The  duration  of  the  interventions 
was coded in weeks or months, with six months being the 
threshold used to differentiate long-term and short-term 
interventions.

Data extraction

Two researchers (BH and YYD) independently extracted 
the data. Any disagreements were resolved through dis-
cussion  until  a  consensus  was  reached  or  by  consult-
ing  a  third  researcher  (PZZ).  The  following  data  were 
extracted: basic article information (first author, publica-
tion year, country, sample size for each arm and dropout 
rate),  participant  characteristics  (age  and  health  status), 
intervention  parameters  (exercise  intensity,  frequency, 
duration per session and overall length) and other infor-
mation  (comparator  information,  tools  used  to  assess

outcomes and reported outcomes [mean ± standard devi-
ation  (SD)]).  For  each  outcome,  we  extracted  the  mean 
differences directly or calculated them based on the pre- 
and  post-intervention  mean ± SD  and  sample  sizes  for 
the meta-analyses. When relevant statistics were incom-
pletely  reported,  we  calculated  the  mean  and  SD  using 
the sample size, standard error, confidence interval (CI), 
range and p-value. If the article lacked essential informa-
tion, the corresponding author was contacted to acquire 
the necessary details.

Risk of bias and certainty assessment

Two  researchers  (BH  and  YYD)  used  Version  2  of  the 
Cochrane  risk-of-bias  tool  [33](ROB  2.0)  for  RCTs  to 
assess  the  risk  of  bias  for  all  included  studies.  Any  dis-
agreements were resolved through discussion. The qual-
ity  of  the  included  studies  was  assessed  based  on  six 
indicators: (1) randomization process bias, (2) deviations 
from  intended  interventions  bias,  (3)  missing  outcome 
data  bias,  (4)  outcome  measurement  bias,  (5)  reported 
result  selection  bias  and  (6)  overall  bias.  Each  indica-
tor  has  three  risk  levels:  low,  some  concerns,  and  high. 
The overall bias of studies was classified as ‘low risk’ (all 
domains  low  risk),  ‘some  concerns’  (concerns  in  at  least 
one domain but no high risks), or ‘high risk’ (high risk in 
at least one domain).

We  used  the  Confidence  in  Network  Meta-Analysis 
[34]  (CINeMA)  web  tool  to  assess  the  quality  of  evi-
dence  for  each  comparison.  It  considers  six  factors  that 
could  lead  to  a  downgrade:  within-study  bias,  report-
ing  bias,  indirectness,  imprecision,  heterogeneity  and 
incoherence.  For  within-study  bias,  comparisons  were 
downgraded  when  most  of  the  studies  providing  direct 
evidence  for  comparisons  were  ‘some  concerns’  or  ‘high 
risk’.  For  imprecision,  we  considered  a ± 0.24  threshold 
for  standardised  mean  differences  (SMDs)  as  clinically 
meaningful [35]. For heterogeneity, CINeMA considered 
prediction  intervals.  Finally,  the  quality  of  evidence  for 
each comparison was categorised as high, moderate, low, 
or very low.

Statistical analysis

Pairwise  and  network  meta-analyses  were  conducted 
using  Review  Manager  (version  5.4;  Cochrane,  London, 
UK) or STATA (version 15.0; StataCorp, College Station, 
TX,  USA)  software.  Since  depression  and  anxiety  mea-
surements  were  continuous  or  sequential  and  measured 
on different scales, the effect estimates were represented 
as SMDs with 95% CIs. The statistical significance was set 
at P < 0.05.

In  the  pairwise  meta-analysis,  heterogeneity  among 
studies was evaluated using the I2 statistic and the Q test. 
The recommendations of the Cochrane Group [36], state 
that  an  I2  of  < 40%  signifies  low  heterogeneity,  30–60% 

signifies  moderate  heterogeneity,  50–90%  signifies  sub-
stantial  heterogeneity,  and  75–100%  signifies  consid-
erable  heterogeneity.  The  Q  and  I²  calculations  can  be 
found in Supplemental Material 4. A fixed-effects model 
was  used  when  I²  was  ≤ 50%,  and  the  random-effects 
model was used otherwise. Publication bias was assessed 
using  visual  interpretation  of  funnel  plots  and  Egger 
tests.  Once  significant  publication  bias  was  detected, 
the  trim-and-fill  method  was  used  to  adjust  the  results, 
ensuring the robustness of our findings. In the subgroup 
analyses,  participants’  age  (< 60  and  ≥ 60),  health  status 
(healthy,  with  depressive  symptoms  or  other  illnesses) 
and  intervention  duration  (short-term  and  long-term) 
were  assessed  as  categorical  variables.  Three  types  of 
sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted:  (1)  the  leave-one-
out method; (2) the exclusion of studies that used health 
education  as  the  control  group,  which  enabled  a  clearer 
observation  of  the  effects  of  exercise  interventions;  and 
(3) excluding studies judged to have an overall high risk 
of bias. Results that retained their significance after these 
analyses were deemed robust.

The  network  meta-analysis  was  performed  according 
to  the  current  operation  guidelines  [37]  and  based  on 
the  frequentist  framework.  It  was  performed  with  the 
following  steps.  First,  a  network  geometry  was  created 
to  explore  the  comparative  relationships  between  sev-
eral  exercise  interventions  and  controls.  Second,  global 
inconsistency tests were performed to statistically evalu-
ate  whether  the  network  meta-analysis’s  consistency 
assumptions were met. Local inconsistency was assessed 
using the node-splitting method. When a closed loop was 
formed  among  interventions,  a  loop  inconsistency  test 
was  conducted  to  assess  the  consistency  between  direct 
and  indirect  evidence  within  that  loop.  Third,  a  predic-
tive interval plot was created to illustrate the direct com-
parative effects of various exercise interventions. Fourth, 
the  interventions  were  ranked  to  determine  their  supe-
riority  based  on  the  surface  under  the  cumulative  rank-
ing  curve  (SUCRA)  and  mean  rank. The  SUCRA  offline 
area map was plotted; the larger the area under the curve 
or SUCRA value (0–100%), the more effective the inter-
vention in reducing depression. Finally, sensitivity analy-
ses were conducted, excluding studies judged to have an 
overall high risk of bias.

Results
Identification and screening of studies

A total of 1,250 articles related to the research topic were 
retrieved  from  the  online  databases,  and  an  additional 
four  were  identified  from  the  reference  lists  of  previous 
reviews. After removing duplicate studies using EndNote 
(n = 390),  864  eligible  articles  were  identified.  Following 
the  initial  screening  of  titles  and  abstracts,  94  articles 
were  considered  potentially  relevant.  Subsequently,  68

(Supplemental Material 5) that did not meet this study’s 
inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  excluded,  result-
ing  in  the  final  inclusion  of  22  studies  in  the  pairwise 
meta-analysis  and  26  in  the  network  meta-analysis.  The 
detailed study selection process is shown in Fig. 1.

Studies’ characteristics

The  quantitative  analysis  included  the  data  of  2,170 
participants  (1,425  in  the  treatment  group  and  745  in 
the  control  group)  from  26  RCTs  [23–26,  38–59].  The 

selected RCTs originated from 11 countries. Among the 
26  studies,  22  compared  the  effects  of  the  exercise  and 
control  interventions,  and  four  compared  the  effects  of 
various types of exercises.

The  included  RCTs  examined  the  effects  of  different 
exercise  interventions:  two  (100  participants)  examined 
the  effects  of  SE,  12  (657  participants)  examined  the 
effects of AE, four (220 participants) examined the effects 
of RT, 12 (334 participants) examined the effects of MBE, 
and three (114 participants) examined the effects of ME.

The participant characteristics differed across the stud-
ies included in this meta-analysis. Twelve studies targeted 
healthy  postmenopausal  women,  four  focused  on  post-
menopausal women with depressive symptoms, and eight 
examined  postmenopausal  women  with  other  health 
conditions, including obesity and heart failure. The mean 
age  of  participants  ranged  from  52.5  [56]  to  80.4  [40] 
years. The most common tool for measuring depression 
was the Geriatric Depression Scale (n = 6) [25, 40, 45, 46, 
52, 53], followed by the Beck Depression Inventory (n = 5) 
[23, 41, 47, 51, 56] and Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale (n = 4) [24, 38, 39, 43], while the remaining studies 
used  various  scales.  The  studies’  detailed  characteristics 
are provided in Supplemental Material 6.

Results of risk of bias and certainty assessment

Regarding  the  risk  of  bias  in  the  included  RCTs,  most 
were  judged  to  have  some  concerns  (n = 14,  53.8%),  fol-
lowed  by  low  risk  (n = 7,  26.9%)  and  high  risk  (n = 5, 
19.2%).  Most  RCTs 
implemented  and  adequately 
described randomization procedures. The main source of 
bias was the inadequate reporting of allocation conceal-
ment and blinding of assessors. Supplemental Material 7 
provides the risk of bias ratings for each study. The risk of 
bias assessment is summarised in Fig. 2.

Supplemental  Material  8  shows  the  strength  of  evi-
dence  for  each  network  estimate.  Overall,  the  com-
parison  between  MBE  and  the  control  intervention  had 
moderate  confidence,  while  the  other  comparisons  had 
very  low  confidence.  The  main  reasons  for  downgrad-
ing were imprecision and heterogeneity, primarily due to 
the  broad  CIs  and  prediction  intervals.  Furthermore,  all 
comparisons  had  some  concerns  regarding  within-study 
bias.  Reporting  bias  was  also  difficult  to  robustly  assess 

because a direct comparison was often only provided in 
fewer  than  10  studies.  No  studies  showed  problematic 
incoherence,  meaning  the  direct  and  indirect  evidence 
agreed.

Pairwise meta-analysis

Twenty-five  comparisons  from  22  RCTs  involving  1,564 
participants  (exercise  group = 819,  control  group = 745) 
were  eligible  for  pairwise  meta-analysis  on  depression. 
Exercise  interventions  demonstrated  a  clinically  sig-
nificant positive effect on depression in postmenopausal 
women (SMD = -0.71, 95% CI = -0.94 to -0.48, P < 0.001; 
Fig. 3), with an overall I2 of 78%. The funnel plot appeared 
slightly  asymmetric,  and  Egger’s  test  indicated  the  pres-
ence  of  slight  publication  bias  (P = 0.047;  Supplemental 
Material  9.1.1).  The  trim-and-fill  method  was  used  to 
account  for  potential  unpublished  studies.  The  results 
showed that no additional studies were needed to balance 
the  funnel  plot,  indicating  strong  stability  of  the  out-
comes (Supplemental Material 9.1.2).

The  subgroup  analyses  (Table  1)  revealed  that  exer-
cise interventions significantly reduced depression levels 
in  postmenopausal  women,  regardless  of  intervention 
duration,  age,  and  health  status.  However,  their  effect 
size  varied  across  different  subgroups,  with  short-term 
interventions  (SMD  =  -0.85,  95%  CI  =  -1.16  to  -0.55; 
I2 = 75%)  proving  more  effective  than  long-term  inter-
ventions (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI = -0.61 to -0.16; I2 = 55%), 
suggesting that intervention duration may be one source 
of  heterogeneity.  In  addition,  those  with  depressive 
symptoms  gained  greater  health  benefits  (SMD  =  -0.95, 
95%  CI  =  -1.44  to  -0.45;  I2 = 78%).  Moreover,  those  in 
the  early  postmenopause  (n = 7;  SMD  =  -0.70,  95%  CI  = 
-1.24  to  -0.16;  I2 = 85%)  and  late  postmenopause  (n = 18;

interventions.  These 
results remained unchanged after three types of sensitiv-
ity analysis (Supplemental Material 9.2): a leave-one-out 
approach,  excluding  studies  with  healthy  education  as 
the control group (SMD = -0.67, 95% CI = -0.93 to -0.42, 
P < 0.001; I2 = 80%) or excluding studies judged to have an 
overall high risk of bias (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI = -1.06 to

Network meta-analysis

Twenty-six  RCTs 
involving  2,170  patients  (exercise 
group = 1,425,  control  group = 745)  were  eligible  for  the 
network  meta-analysis.  Figure  4  shows  the  network  of 
pairwise comparisons across all RCTs. Inconsistency test 
based on network analysis revealed no significant global 
or local inconsistency (P > 0.05), indicating that the con-
sistency  assumption  could  be  accepted  at  the  overall 
level. Within the depression network, the loop inconsis-
tency  test  did  not  indicate  inconsistency  (inconsistency 
factor  (IF) = 0.10  to  0.67)  or  loop-specific  heterogeneity 
(τ2 < 0.001).  The  network  meta-analysis  results  revealed

that,  in  both  global  and  specific  closed-loop  contexts, 
direct and indirect  evidence does not  differ significantly 
(Supplemental Material 9.3).

The predictive interval plot (Fig. 5) shows the pairwise 
comparison  outcomes  among  interventions  and  their 
predictive  intervals.  It  indicated  that  only  MBE  (SMD  = 
-0.97, 95% CI = -1.28 to -0.67), AE (SMD = -0.58, 95% CI 
=  -0.88  to  -0.27)  and  ME  (SMD  =  -0.57,  95%  CI  =  -1.15 
to  -0.002)  significantly  reduced  depression  compared 
to  the  control  intervention.  The  pairwise  comparisons 

between exercise interventions indicated that MBE were 
significantly  more  effective  than  AE  (SMD  =  -0.40,  95% 
CI  =  -0.78  to  -0.02).  Figure  6  shows  the  rankings  of  the 
exercise interventions based on the cumulative probabil-
ity  plots  and  SUCRA.  MBE  had  the  highest  probability 
(SUCRA = 94.7%; Supplemental Material 9.4) of being the 
most effective exercise type, followed by AE and ME. The 
sensitivity  analysis  results  showed  that  when  five  stud-
ies judged to be at high risk of bias were excluded, MBE

remained the best intervention (SUCRA = 95.7%; Supple-

Secondary outcomes

For  anxiety,  13  RCTs  involving  1,076  patients  (exercise 
group = 578, control group = 498) were found to be eligi-
ble  for  pairwise  meta-analysis.  The  results  revealed  that 
exercise  interventions  positively  affected  anxiety  (SMD 
=  -0.53,  95%  CI  =  -0.72  to  -0.33,  P < 0.001;  I2 = 57.0%). 
The network meta-analysis included 15 RCTs with 1,285 
participants.  The  global  inconsistency  test  indicated  no 
significant  global  inconsistency  in  the  results  (P > 0.05). 
Within  the  anxiety  network,  the  loop  inconsistency  test 
did  not  indicate  high  inconsistency  (IF = 0.05  to  0.30) 
or  loop-specific  heterogeneity  (τ2 < 0.001).  The  results 
showed  that  AE  (SMD  =  -0.34,  95%  CI  =  -0.63  to  -0.05) 
and MBE (SMD = -0.69, 95% CI = -0.92 to -0.47) signifi-
cantly  reduced  anxiety  in  postmenopausal  women  com-
pared  to  the  control  intervention,  with  MBE  having  the 
highest  probability  (SUCRA = 95.4%)  of  being  the  most 
effective  exercise  type.  The  specific  results  of  the  meta-
analysis for anxiety are presented in Supplemental Mate-
rial 10.

Discussions
Main findings

This  meta-analysis  included  26  RCTs  with  2,170  par-
ticipants.  To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  pairwise 
and  network  meta-analysis  to  investigate  the  effects 

of  exercise  on  depression  in  postmenopausal  women, 
including  a  ranking  of  five  common  exercise  interven-
tions.  This  study  contributes  to  the  ongoing  debate 
about  the  efficacy  of  exercise  interventions  in  reducing 
depression  in  this  demographic,  confirming  that  exer-
cise  significantly  reduces  depression.  Among  the  five 
evaluated exercise interventions, only MBE, AE and ME 
significantly  reduced  depression.  MBE  emerged  as  the 
most  likely  optimal  type  for  alleviating  depression  in 
postmenopausal  women.  Furthermore,  subgroup  analy-
ses  demonstrated  that  exercise  interventions  signifi-
cantly  reduced  depression  in  postmenopausal  women, 
irrespective  of  their  duration,  participants’  age,  or  their 
health  status. The  subgroup  analysis  and  network  meta-
analysis  results  indicated  that  the  intervention’s  dura-
tion  and  exercise  type  may  be  sources  of  heterogeneity. 
In addition, we found that only MBE and AE significantly 
improved  anxiety,  with  MBE  showing  the  largest  effect. 
The  sensitivity  analysis  showed  robust  results  for  both 
pairwise and network meta-analysis.

Effect of exercise on depression in postmenopausal 
women

Similar  to  other  studies  in  diverse  populations  [20,  27, 
60–62],  our  study  demonstrated  that  exercise  interven-
tions  significantly  reduced  depression  levels  in  post-
menopausal  women.  Given  that  the  minimum  clinically 
significant  difference  established  in  earlier  study  were 
− 0.24 (SMD) for patients with major depressive disorders

Page 10 of 13

[35], the change observed here may be considered clini-
cally  significant.  The  robustness  of  our  pairwise  meta-
analysis  is  supported  by  three  sensitivity  analyses.  The 
antidepressant  mechanisms  of  exercise  are  manifold 
and,  while  not  fully  elucidated,  can  be  categorized  into 
biological  and  psychosocial  mechanisms  [9].  Regarding 
biological  mechanisms,  exercise  potentially  alleviates 
depression by enhancing neuroplasticity [63], promoting 
anti-inflammatory  responses  [64],  regulating  oxidative 
stress  [63],  and  modulating  the  neuroendocrine  system, 
including attenuating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
axis  response  to  stress  [65].  Psychosocial  mechanisms 
appear  to  be  more  varied.  Research  suggests  that  exer-
cise  improves  mental  health  by  enhancing  self-esteem 
[47], self-efficacy [9], social support [66], body image and 
social interaction [22].

Our  subgroup  analysis  of  the  primary  outcomes 
revealed  several  significant  phenomena  or  conclu-
sions that warrant further discussion. Firstly, short-term 
interventions  reduced  depression  to  a  greater  extent 
than  long-term  interventions,  consistent  with  numer-
ous previous studies [27, 29, 61]. A possible explanation 
is  that  some  long-term  control  groups  exhibit  a  placebo 
effect  [41],  and  participation  in  long-term  experiments 
increases  social  interaction  [26].  Alternatively,  longer 
experimental  periods  often  have  higher  dropout  rates, 
which  can  dilute  the  overall  effect  [61],  especially  with 
intention-to-treat  analysis  [48].  Another  possible  expla-
nation  is  that  the  effect  of  exercise  on  depression  may 
indeed  wane  over  time.  Secondly,  patients  with  depres-
sion  derive  greater  benefits  from  exercise,  potentially 
due  to  the  lower  baseline  level  of  depression  in  healthy 
populations,  which  illustrating  a  floor  effect.  Thirdly, 
our  findings  indicate  that  exercise  interventions  provide 
similar benefits across different age stages in postmeno-
pausal  women.  This  consistency  may  arise  from  signifi-
cant changes, such as hormonal fluctuations and shifts in 
social  roles,  occurring  primarily  during  menopause  [5]. 
Once this critical phase is passed, age appears to have a 
minimal  effect  on  the  efficacy  of  exercise  interventions 
for  depression.  However,  it  is  crucial  to  recognize  that 
the age categorisations based on the average age in study 
reports  may  not  adequately  reflect  the  diversity  of  ages; 
therefore,  caution  is  advised  when  interpreting  these 
results.

MBE  focuses  on  promoting  the  unity  of  mind,  body, 
and  behaviour  and  is  characterised  by  gentle  and  slow 
movements  [67].  The  network  meta-analysis  results 
showed  that  MBE,  ME  and  AE  significantly  reduced 
depression  in  postmenopausal  women,  while  the  other 
two types did not. The CIs of the effect sizes for SE, RT, 
and ME compared to the control intervention were rela-
tively  broad,  likely  due  to  the  limited  number  of  studies 
examining them. MBE may be the most suitable form of 

exercise intervention to reduce depression in postmeno-
pausal women, consistent with findings in elderly popula-
tions [62, 68]. This preference may arise from the gentler 
nature  of  MBE,  which  postmenopausal  women  often 
favour.  Unlike  other  exercise  forms,  MBE  uniquely  fos-
ter  interoceptive  states  [69],  potentially  explaining  their 
superior  antidepressant  effects.  Furthermore,  given  that 
the intensity of MBE and AE is generally lower, it is nota-
ble  that  when  exercise  intensities  are  comparable,  some 
exercise  modalities  [68]  may  be  more  effective  in  allevi-
ating  depression  in  postmenopausal  women  and  poten-
tially in a wider demographic.

Effect of exercise on anxiety in postmenopausal women

Anxiety  is  a  common  comorbidity  of  depression,  and 
not only do they share some similar symptoms, but they 
may also have a causal relationship [32]. Our study found 
that  exercise  interventions  could  have  a  moderate  miti-
gating  effect  on  the  anxiety  of  postmenopausal  women. 
Individuals  with  anxiety  tend  to  withdraw  from  social 
situations,  and  engaging  in  exercise  represents  a  change 
in  social  behavior  [70].  Exercise  interventions  can  also 
exert anti-anxiety effects by eliciting specific physiologi-
cal responses that may mimic sensations associated with 
anxiety  or  panic,  such  as  a  rapid  heartbeat  [71].  Some 
potential mechanisms through which exercise may com-
bat depression (e.g. enhancing self-efficacy through pro-
gressive, positive feedback [9]) are also used to explain its 
anti-anxiety effects. Additionally, our network meta-anal-
ysis found that MBE had the highest probability of being 
the  most  effective  exercise  type  for  alleviating  anxiety, 
further supporting our recommendation of MBE.

Implications for clinical practice and future research

This  pairwise  and  network  meta-analysis  provides  valu-
able  insights  and  recommendations  for  clinical  profes-
sionals  and  researchers.  Most  importantly,  it  confirms 
the  significant  antidepressant  effects  of  exercise  inter-
ventions  in  postmenopausal  women,  highlighting  the 
particular  efficacy  of  MBE.  These  should  be  consid-
ered  complementary  therapies  in  clinical  settings  due 
to  their  significant  benefits  for  depression  and  anxiety. 
Notably,  consistent  with  prior  research  [27,  29,  61],  we 
observed  that  long-term  interventions  did  not  yield  as 
favourable  results  as  short-term  interventions.  While 
several hypotheses are proposed to explain this phenom-
enon,  a  detailed  investigation  falls  outside  the  scope  of 
this  review  and  should  be  addressed  in  future  research 
through  multiple  follow-up  points  and  rigorously  con-
trolled  RCTs.  Despite  our  findings  supporting  the  supe-
rior  efficacy  of  MBE,  it  is  crucial  to  emphasise  that  the 
value  of  other  exercise  interventions  remains  undimin-
ished. In order to enhance adherence in clinical settings, 
postmenopausal  women  should  be  given  the  choice  of 

Han et al. BMC Public Health         (2024) 24:1816 their preferred exercise type, although MBE will likely be 
the most favoured. Additionally, while our study catego-
rised and analysed different types of exercises, the actual 
interventions  within  categories  may  still  vary  substan-
tially.  Therefore,  when  sufficient  studies  are  published, 
future research should further classify exercise interven-
tion methods.

Strengths and limitations

Our study had several strengths. To our knowledge, it is 
the  first  meta-analysis  to  examine  the  efficacy  of  exer-
cise  interventions  in  reducing  depression  in  postmeno-
pausal  women.  By  extending  standard  meta-analyses 
with  network  meta-analyses,  we  could  determine  the 
most  effective  types  of  exercise  interventions,  enhanc-
ing recommendations for clinical practice. Moreover, the 
robustness of our findings is supported by multiple sensi-
tivity and subgroup analyses, which also helped to iden-
tify  potential  sources  of  heterogeneity.  Lastly,  using  the 
ROB  2.0  and  CINeMA  online  tools  enabled  us  to  effec-
tively assess the risk of bias and the certainty of the evi-
dence in the included studies.

(e.g.  different  exercise 

However,  our  study  also  had  some  limitations.  Firstly, 
heterogeneity  was  difficult  to  avoid  due  to  the  experi-
intervention 
mental  design 
modalities) used in the included studies. To enhance the 
reliability  of  our  findings,  we  conducted  subgroup  and 
sensitivity  analyses  across  multiple  dimensions.  More-
over,  we  used  network  meta-analysis  to  rank  and  com-
pare exercise intervention modalities, identifying them as 
a likely significant source of heterogeneity. Secondly, the 
diverse scales used to measure depression may have also 
contributed to heterogeneity, although we prioritised the 
most  commonly  used  scales.  Thirdly,  the  predominant 
pre-post intervention design of the included studies lim-
ited  our  analysis  to  data  extracted  solely  from  interven-
tion endpoints due to the absence of long-term follow-up 
data. Fourthly, while we have retrieved as many relevant 
articles  as  possible,  our  inclusion  of  grey  literature  may 
still  have  deficiencies.  Lastly,  since  fewer  original  stud-
ies had examined SE, RT, and ME, their effect sizes had 
broader CIs. Consequently, results should be interpreted 
with caution. Future research should include larger sam-
ples to more thoroughly assess the efficacy of these exer-
cise interventions.

Conclusions
This pairwise and network meta-analysis synthesised the 
findings  of  26  RCTs.  It  highlighted  the  efficacy  of  exer-
cise  in  postmenopausal  women  and  provided  some  key 
findings  about  exercise  therapy  for  clinical  professionals 
and researchers. Exercise interventions have a significant 
effect  in  reducing  depression  levels  in  postmenopausal 
women, with MBE likely being the best form of exercise

intervention. The meta-analysis for anxiety also supports 
our  recommendation  for  exercise,  particularly  MBE. 
Future research should develop more acceptable exercise 
intervention  models  and  conduct  additional  multi-arm 
RCTs to provide robust direct evidence.
