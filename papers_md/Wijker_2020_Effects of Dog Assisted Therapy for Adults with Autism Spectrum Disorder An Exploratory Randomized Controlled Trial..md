Abstract
Effective treatments of highly prevalent stress-related outcomes such as depression and anxiety are understudied in adults 
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A randomized controlled trial with baseline, post-intervention, and 10-week follow-up, 
that explores the effects of animal assisted therapy (AAT) was conducted. In total, 53 adults with ASD with normal to high 
intelligence were randomized in an intervention (N = 27) versus waiting list control group (N = 26). The remarkable adher-
ence to the therapy program by study participants and the program’s clinically relevant effects indicate that AAT with dogs 
can be used to reduce perceived stress and symptoms of agoraphobia, and to improve social awareness and communication 
in adults with ASD with normal to high intelligence.

Stress-related mental health problems such as depression 
and anxiety are very common in adults with autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD), affecting up to 77% of this population (Joshi 
et al. 2013). Stress is strongly associated with depression and 
anxiety (Vreeburg et al. 2010), premature mortality and poor 
health outcomes (Slavich 2016), and severity of ASD traits, 
which include problems in social interaction and communi-
cation (Hirvikoski and Blomqvist 2015). To date, research 
on  effective  interventions  that  aim  to  reduce  stress  and 
stress-related outcomes in people with ASD or to improve 
their social interaction and communication has been very 
limited (Damiano et al. 2014). A few randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) conducted on interventions in ASD suggest 
that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-
based stress reduction (MBSR) can be effective for reducing

depression and anxiety (Sizoo and Kuiper 2017). This effect 
may partially be explained by physical stress reduction, e.g. 
measured using markers such as salivary cortisol (Vreeburg 
et al. 2010). To the best of our knowledge, no RCTs have 
been reported that directly target perceived stress in the adult 
ASD population.

Several studies not specific to adults with ASD have 
shown that physical interactions with animals reduce stress 
levels (Beetz et al. 2012). In children with ASD, animal 
assisted therapies (AAT) (i.e., interventions that incorpo-
rate trained animals) have also shown promising results 
for  stress-related  outcomes  (O’Haire 2013).  Improve-
ments in social interaction and communication have also 
been reported (Berry et al. 2013; Gabriels et al. 2015). 
AAT may be especially well suited to people with ASD 
because animals communicate non-verbally, which may 
be a less stressful form of interaction than a conversation 
with a therapist involving metacognitive and introspective 
aspects (Verheggen et al. 2017). It has been hypothesized 
that in therapeutic settings, animals act as social catalysts, 
causing patients to become more willing to communicate 
with  their  social  environment  which  in  turn  facilitates 
improvements in social interaction and communication 
(Gabriels et al. 2015). Although the described effects of 
AAT (mostly with dogs) in children with ASD are promis-
ing, it is not clear whether these results can be generalized 
to adults. Importantly, AAT studies in children report a

number of limitations such as small sample sizes, limited 
or no verification of the ASD diagnosis, limited descrip-
tions of the intervention, and lack of control groups, ran-
domization, and validated outcome measures (O’Haire 
2013).  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  no  interventions 
that include human–animal interactions have ever been 
reported in adults with ASD.

To summarize evidence on animal assisted therapy (AAT) 
in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we con-
ducted a systematic search of PubMed looking specifically 
for reports published in Dutch and English between January 
1, 2000 and December 31, 2015. Studies were eligible if they 
were treatment effect studies, included people with ASD, 
and contained at least one treatment group that incorporated 
a live animal. We identified a total of 18 studies. The animals 
in these studies included dogs, horses, guinea pigs, lamas, 
and dolphins. None of the studies included participants of 
18 years or older. We extended the systematic search to 
reports published between January 1, 1995, and April 16, 
2018, and still found no research that included participants 
with ASD who were 18 years or older.

Our study contributes to the scientific literature by spe-
cifically including adults with ASD, by using an appropriate 
sample size for an explorative effect study, and including a 
control group, randomization, and valid outcome measures.
Previous studies in children with ASD have shown that 
AAT offers promising results in terms of stress reduction 
and improvements in social communication skills. Our study 
shows that the highly understudied population of adults with 
ASD can also benefit from AAT in similar ways, including 
reduction of perceived stress, agoraphobia and improve-
ments in one of the core aspects in ASD, social responsive-
ness (as reported by proxies).

We considered the effects of AAT in children with ASD 
(O’Haire 2013; Gabriels et al. 2015) and hypothesized that 
in adults with ASD, AAT may result in stress reduction, 
improvements in social responsiveness (social awareness, 
communication, and motivation), and reduced depressive 
and anxiety symptoms, which are strongly related to stress 
(Vreeburg et al. 2010). Considering that stress-reducing 
effects  of  dogs  were  reported  in  the  general  population 
(Beetz et al. 2012) and that dogs are the animals most com-
monly employed in AAT with children with ASD (O’Haire 
2013), our aim was to explore the effects of AAT with dogs 
in adults with ASD with normal to high intelligence. We 
focused on self-perceived stress, social responsiveness, and 
psychological symptoms (such as depression and anxiety 
symptoms). Furthermore, we looked at AAT’s effects on 
self-esteem  in  this  same  group—an  important  addition, 
given that adults with ASD were found to have lower self-
esteem than adults without ASD and that self-esteem is 
strongly negatively correlated with the stress-related out-
comes depression and anxiety (Cooper et al. 2017).

Methods

Study Design

The randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two arms (the 
intervention condition and the waiting list control condition) 
was conducted between January 2015 and July 2017 and 
had an exploratory character due to the lack of evidence on 
AAT in adults with ASD. Subjects entered the study at seven 
pre-planned starting times, with recruitment continuing until 
17 February 2017. For each participant, baseline assessment 
was followed by the post-intervention assessment (T1, 10 
weeks post-baseline) and the follow-up assessment (T2, 20 
weeks post-baseline). All waiting list controls were offered 
the option of individual AAT after T2.

Detailed information about recruitment and screening 

procedures is reported elsewhere (Wijker et al. 2017).

Participants

All study participants were recruited sequentially in batches 
from the mental health care organization GGZ Oost Bra-
bant, The Netherlands, which has a psychiatric outpatient 
center for adults with ASD with normal to high intelligence. 
Information flyers in the waiting room and verbal informa-
tion from therapists were used for recruitment. Inclusion 
criteria were the following: diagnosed with ASD, between 
18 and 60 years of age, and an IQ of 80 or above. Because 
the intervention was developed to reduce perceived stress 
and comorbid symptoms in ASD, only participants with a 
score considered to be high on the Perceived Stress Scale 
(PSS; Cohen and Williamson 1988, scores > 19) and on 
the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis 
1994, scores > 132) were included. Exclusion criteria were 
current psychosis or suicide risk as indicated by the person’s 
psychologist or psychiatrist, institutionalization, allergy to 
dogs, fear of dogs, aversion to dogs, and participation in 
a treatment other than AAT during the study period (psy-
chopharmacological treatment was allowed as long as the 
medication remained stable during the study). When an ASD 
diagnosis and/or IQ score was missing, a standardized diag-
nostic procedure was conducted by a multidisciplinary team, 
by a combination of the autistic disorder interview-revised 
(ADI-R) (Lord et al. 1994), a semi-structured interview of 
the DSM-5 criteria (American Psychiatric Association 2013) 
and clinical observations. Subjects were enrolled if they ful-
filled diagnostic criteria of ASD and scored 80 or above on 
the total scale of the Dutch version of the Wechsler Adult 
Intelligence Scale III/IV (Wechsler 1997, 2008).

Participants provided verbal and written informed con-
sent. Participants were made aware both verbally and in

writing that they could end their participation and with-
draw at any point during the study. The medical ethics 
committee CMO region Arnhem-Nijmegen, The Nether-
lands approved the study.

1 ‘very untrue’ to 4 ‘very true’. A higher total score cor-
responds with higher rating of self-reported self-esteem. 
This instrument has a high validity and test–retest reliability 
(Franck et al. 2008).

Randomization and Masking

Procedures

Using computer-generated random numbers, participants 
within  a  batch  were  randomized  blindly  by  one  of  the 
researchers (RL) to one of the arms (the intervention condi-
tion or the waiting list control condition) after the baseline 
measurements.  The  researcher  (RL)  who  conducted  the 
effect analyses was masked to the condition to which a spe-
cific participant was assigned.

Outcomes

Perceived stress was measured using the Perceived Stress 
Scale (PSS; Cohen and Williamson 1988), which contains 
ten items rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 
‘never’ to 4 ‘very often’. A higher total score corresponds 
with a higher rating in self-perceived stress. The instrument 
has a good internal consistency and an adequate convergent 
validity (Cohen and Williamson 1988).

Psychological and physical symptoms were measured 
with the symptom checklist-90-revised (SCL-90-R; Dero-
gatis 1994). The Dutch version of the SCL-90-R contains 90 
items divided into eight subscales that measure psychologi-
cal and physical distress: anxiety, agoraphobia, depression, 
somatization, cognitive-performance deficits, interpersonal 
sensitivity and mistrust, hostility, and sleep difficulties. Each 
item is rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 
‘none’ to 5 ‘very severe’. A higher total score corresponds 
with higher levels of self-reported psychological and physi-
cal symptoms. The original SCL-90-R and the Dutch version 
of this instrument have excellent reliability and construct 
validity (Arrindel and Ettema 2002).

Impairments in social responsiveness were measured 
with the Social Responsiveness Scale for Adults (SRS-A; 
Noens et al. 2012). The Dutch version of the SRS-A contains 
64 items and four subscales: social awareness, social com-
munication, social motivation, and restricted interests and 
repetitive behavior. Each item is rated on a four-point Likert 
scale ranging from 1 ‘not true’ to 4 ‘almost always true’. 
A higher total score corresponds with more impairment in 
social responsiveness. This questionnaire has two versions: 
a self-report and an informant-report. The Dutch version has 
a good internal consistency and test–retest reliability and a 
sufficient intraclass correlation coefficient for the self-report 
and informant report (Noens et al. 2012).

Self-esteem  was  measured  using  the  Rosenberg  Self-
Esteem Scale (RSES; Rosenberg 1965), which contains ten 
items, each rated on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 

Animal assisted therapy (AAT) is a goal-oriented, (semi-) 
structured intervention provided by a certified professional 
incorporating a trained and certified animal (IAHAIO 2014). 
The therapy goals for children with ASD who participated in 
previous research on AAT were improving social interaction, 
verbal and non-verbal communication skills, and reducing 
physiological stress (O’Haire 2013). The AAT program for 
this trial was developed by therapists and dog behavioral 
specialists from the Dutch service dog foundation Sticht-
ing Hulphond Nederland and psychologists from the men-
tal health care organization GGZ Oost Brabant who have 
a specialization in autism. The program had a structured 
protocol and consisted of 10 weekly one-on-one sessions of 
60 min per session. A therapy dog was involved during all 
the therapy sessions. The therapists providing AAT had a 
college or university degree in mental health care and were 
specialized in working with adults with ASD. Additionally, 
the AAT therapists had completed advanced courses in dog 
behavior and welfare. The Dutch service dog foundation 
Stichting Hulphond Nederland provided the therapy dogs. In 
total, thirteen therapy dogs were involved in the study (two 
Labradors, four Labrador crossbreeds, one golden retriever, 
three golden retriever crossbreeds, two poodles, and one 
German Wirehaired Pointer). All of the participating dogs 
were trained and tested to work with people, and their mental 
and physical health care was strictly monitored by the ser-
vice dog foundation. Detailed information about the AAT 
program has been described elsewhere (Wijker et al. 2017).
At  baseline,  immediately  post-intervention,  and  at 
10-week follow-up (T0, T1, and T2), participants were asked 
to fill in questionnaires in the following order: Perceived 
Stress Scale (PSS), symptom checklist 90-revised (SCL-
90-R), Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (RSES) and Social 
Responsiveness Scale-Adults (SRS-A). A stimulus-poor 
laboratory setting was used at the mental health care organi-
zation. A research assistant checked for missing items and 
asked participants to complete the missing items before leav-
ing the assessment room. Participants received the SRS-A 
informant version and were asked to have a spouse, close 
family member, or friend complete the questionnaire. The 
same informants were to be used at all three assessments 
(T0, T1, and T2). Informants were asked to return the ques-
tionnaire during the week following each assessment. When 
the proxy-report was not returned, it was reported as missing 
and not included in analyses.

Statistical Analyses

IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0 was used 
for descriptive statistics and building mixed models. Miss-
ing items were extrapolated by the mean score of other scale 
items. In participants with missing items (n = 6), self-report 
scales (PSS, SCL-90-R, RSES and SRS-A self-reports) had 
no more than 10% of their items missing. Fourteen SRS-A 
questionnaires were not returned and therefore were not 
included in the analyses.

All participants in the intervention group participated in 
at least nine of the ten therapy sessions and for this reason 
we did not account for adherence (the number of sessions a 
participant received) as we had originally planned (Wijker 
et al. 2017).

To estimate the intervention effect, we used linear mixed 
models with random intercepts and accounting for repeated 
measurements within participants.

In line with the exploratory character of the study, both 
the total scales’ scores (PSS, SCL-90, RSES, and SRS-A) 
and the scores of the subscales (SCL-90 and the SRS-A) 
were used as outcomes. Standardized effect sizes (d) were 
calculated by dividing estimated effects by the standard 
deviation at baseline; d of < 0.20, between 0.20 and 0.49, 
between 0.50 and 0.79, and > 0.80 was interpreted respec-
tively as negligible, small, medium, and large (Cohen 1988). 
In addition, we did not correct for multiple testing and built 
two models per outcome: (1) with main fixed effects (the 
intervention condition [yes/no] and the assessment time 
points [T1 and T2 compared to T0] and (2) a mixed model 
with the same fixed terms and preplanned covariates age 
(years), gender (male versus female), having a dog at home 
at T0 (yes/no), and WAIS total IQ. During the trial, psycho-
tropic medication was changed for some participants, and 
therefore, additional analysis was run with dummy variable 
change in medication [yes/no] to explore effects on main 
outcome variables. To explore whether  the  intervention 
effect differed for T1 and T2, the models with an interaction 
term for the time points and the condition were compared to 
models without this interaction term. Likelihood ratio tests 
for the model fit comparisons were run in package lme4 
(Bates et al. 2014) in the statistical environment R (R Core 
Team 2013).

Results

In total, 68 respondents from GGZ Oost Brabant with ASD 
were screened for eligibility; eight were excluded because 
they did not meet the inclusion criteria, and seven declined 
to participate (Fig. 1). One participant in the control group 
dropped out after baseline due to physical illness and the 
need for intensive revalidation treatment (baseline data were

used in analyses). Three measurements of one of the partici-
pants were regarded as outliers and excluded from analyses 
(this was due to multiple personal problems and a stressful 
life event not related to the study).

Table 1a, b show several baseline characteristics. The 
average total IQ was 102.1 (SD = 13.7). A total of 18 (35%) 
participants had a dog at home at T0.

As preplanned, we tested whether the intervention effect 
might be different for T1 and T2 but, for all tested models, 
we did not find improvements of the model fit when the 
interaction term (time-points × intervention condition) was 
added. Therefore, effects were estimated without this inter-
action term.

Both the model with and the model without potential 
covariates provided a consistent picture of the estimated 
intervention effects (Table 2). The models showed compa-
rable effect sizes for perceived stress (PSS, estimated effect 
with  potential  covariates,  − 3.3;  95%  CI  − 6.1  to  − 0.5; 
p = 0.020;  d = 0.53). Although Fig.  2a demonstrates that 
stress decreased in the intervention condition at T1, and 
slightly increased at T2 (while only a small decrease of 
stress was found in the control condition), the differences 
in effects for T1 and T2 as compared to T0 were regarded 
as non-significant (the interaction term did not improve the 
model fits). Furthermore, a significant intervention effect 
was shown on impairments in social responsiveness rated 
by the informant (SRS-A(I), − 11.9; 95% CI − 20.3 to − 3.5; 
p = 0.010; d = 0.46). Figure 2b shows a decrease in impair-
ments in social responsiveness in both groups at T1 with 
an increase in impairments at T2 compared to T0 in the 
control group, and a slight decrease in impairments at T2 
in the intervention group. The significance threshold was 
not reached for the decrease in psychological and physi-
cal symptoms scores (SCL-90-R, − 14.7, 95% CI − 30.8 to 
1.4; p = 0.072; d = 0.26). Intervention effects on self-esteem 
(RSES, 0.8, 95% CI − 1.3 to 2.9; p = 0.440; d = 0.16) and 
deficits in social responsiveness rated by the participant 
(SRS-A, − 1.3, 95% CI − 7.9 to 5.3; p = 0.690;  d = 0.05) 
were not significant (respectively; Fig. 2d, e).

Mixed models adjusted for covariates showed small sig-
nificant intervention effects on the agoraphobia subscale of 
the SCL-90-R, and small to moderate significant interven-
tion effects on the informant-rated subscales ‘social aware-
ness’ and ‘social communication’ of the SRS-A question-
naire (Table 2). Although a small effect on the depression 
subscale was significant (d = 0.32, p = 0.042) in the model 
without the potential covariates, it did not reach the signifi-
cance threshold (d = 0.33; p = 0.055) in the model adjusted 
for the covariates.

Participants in the age-group between 47 and 60 years old 
had negligibly higher scores on deficits in social responsive-
ness, compared to the two younger age groups (18–32 and 
33–46  years)  (SRS-A,  0.8,  95%  CI  0.1  to  1.4; p = 0.031;

agoraphobia symptoms in adults with ASD. Furthermore, 
the  results  implied  that  AAT  reduced  impairments  in 
social responsiveness as rated by participants’ spouses, 
close family members, or friends. There was an indication 
that depressive symptoms reduced due to the therapy. The 
analyses implied that these effects, small to medium in 
size, remained at the 10-week follow-up.

Participant adherence to the therapy program was note-
worthy. All participants in the intervention group took part 
in at least nine out of the ten intervention sessions. Only 
one recruited participant, who was allocated to the waiting 
list control group, did not complete the study. The adher-
ence rate (98%) was higher than that reported in other ASD 
studies (Hesselmark et al. 2014; Turner-Brown et al. 2008; 
62–92%). Therefore, it can be argued that the intervention is 
feasible in adults with ASD who are motivated to receive it.
The reduction of self-perceived stress seen in the inter-
vention condition might be due to AAT’s focus on gain-
ing insight into participants’ own stress levels and finding 
ways to reduce stress. It could also be that AAT creates a 
relaxing context for participants. For example, each AAT 
session in our study included a period of free interaction 
with a dog. The positive effects of physical contact with 
an animal are supported by several studies in the general 
population  that  showed  reduction  of  self-perceived  or 
physiological  stress  due  to  human–animal  interactions 
(Beetz et al. 2012). More specific to ASD, two studies 
in children with ASD showed reductions of physiologi-
cal stress confirmed by lower (awakening) cortisol levels 
(Tabares et al. 2012; Viau et al. 2010). Viau et al. (2010) 
found  that  cortisol  awakening  response  decreased  in 

children with ASD after service dogs were placed in their 
homes. However, this effect disappeared after the dog was 
removed. In our study the intervention effect remained at 
the 10-week follow-up. It is plausible that the difference 
in follow-up effects might be explained by nature of the 
intervention, e.g. placing a service dog into a home com-
pared to including a therapy dog in a clinical setting. More 
research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms 
of the self-perceived stress reduction and a longer follow-
up may shed light on the intervention’s long-term effects.
Although the intervention showed a reduction of psy-
chological and physical problems, this effect did not reach 
the level of statistical significance for a combined scale 
score, and the effect-size only slightly outperformed the 
threshold  for  clinical  significance  of  d = 0.20  (Cohen 
1988).

Remarkably, exploration of subscales showed an inter-
vention effect on agoraphobia. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this variable has not been explored previously in 
AAT research in children with ASD. A possible explana-
tion for the effect on agoraphobia may be that during the 
last three sessions of the intervention, participants, accom-
panied by the therapist and the dog, worked on social fears 
and controlling environmental stimuli by leaving the men-
tal health facility and practice in the outside world. Social 
and/or environmental fear in the outside world reflects the 
main concept of agoraphobia. Another possible explana-
tion for the intervention’s effect on agoraphobia relates to 
the relationship between stress and agoraphobia (Vreeburg 
et al. 2010): the reduction in perceived stress may have 
resulted in a decrease of agoraphobia and fear in social

environments, while reduced agoraphobia might likewise 
reduce perceived stress.

using depression-specific instruments and recruiting par-
ticipants with a clinical diagnosis of depression.

Alongside agoraphobia, models both with and without 
covariates, showed a reduction in depression scores with 
clinical relevance (d > 0.20) in the intervention condition. 
When corrected for covariates, this effect did not reach 
statistical significance, which may point to some power 
problems. More research is certainly needed since pre-
vious  research  showed  the  relation  between  stress  and 
depression and therefore might indicate that reductions in 
perceived stress might also reduce depression (Vreeburg 
et al. 2010). Furthermore, the physical activity and social 
contact experienced during the therapy sessions might also 
reduce depressive feelings and thoughts and contribute to 
a participant’s sense of purpose. In future research, more 
focus on AAT’s effects on depression can be achieved by 

The proxy-reported improvements in social responsive-
ness are in line with findings in studies in children with ASD. 
However, these latter studies mainly show improvements on 
a more basic level of social communication (e.g., eye gaz-
ing, making sounds, or speaking words), which were rated 
using observations and video recordings (O’Haire 2013). 
Gabriels et al. (2015) used the same instrument used in our 
study, but to measure social responsiveness in a therapeu-
tic horseback-riding program for children with ASD. They 
found similar results in the proxy reports and hypothesized 
that improved social communication skills might be attrib-
uted to the unique capacity of animals to serve as a social 
support or act as a social catalyst in a therapeutic setting. 
This may make participants more willing to communicate

with their environment, leading to improvements in social 
responsiveness perceived by proxies. These might also have 
been underlying mechanisms in the adults in our study. How-
ever, several other mechanisms, such as modeling and natu-
ral (embodied) attunement (synchrony in movement, such 
as walking speed or eye gazing) might have played a role 
(Verheggen et al. 2017). More research is needed to examine 
these hypotheses.

Although  we  did  find  an  intervention  effect  in  proxy 
reports on social responsiveness, no effect was found for 
self-reports of the same outcome. Because adults with ASD 
may have poor self-awareness (Kievit and Geurts 2011), 
the validity of their self-reports might be unclear. We sug-
gest using other measures for social responsiveness, such 
as observational instruments, to explore the differences in 
results between proxy and self-reports.

Regarding potential covariates in our study, older age was 
associated with more impairment in social responsiveness. 
This is in line with Lever and Geurts (2018), who found 
an age-effect for self-reported ASD traits, with the highest 
scores in middle adulthood (39–54 years). It was suggested 

that higher demands such as work, social life, and raising 
children may explain the age effect (Lever and Geurts 2018).
Results  showed  no  significant  intervention  effects  on 
self-esteem. Literature shows that interventions directly 
focusing on improving self-esteem are more effective than 
interventions focusing on other targets (Haney and Durlak 
1998), as it was in our intervention. In contrast to high stress 
and psychological symptoms, low self-esteem was not an 
inclusion criterion for participants. In future research, it is 
important to consider how self-esteem should be targeted in 
ASD, especially when participants show average levels, as 
they did in our study.

The  study  protocol  was  executed  very  strictly;  study 
participants were very committed and showed up at every 
measurement.

A limitation of this study was the relatively small sample 
size. It is possible, that some of the effects would be signifi-
cant in a larger sample. Since this study has an exploratory 
character, a sample size of 30 to 40 participants per condi-
tion was regarded as sufficient (Hertzog 2008). Our sample 
size was comparable to that of other intervention studies in 

1 32162

adults with ASD (Sizoo and Kuiper 2017; Spek et al. 2013). 
Another limitation of the study is that generalization towards 
the global population might be limited due to lack of ethnic 
diversity in the sample and exclusion of institutionalized per-
sons, individuals with intellectual disability, and individuals 
with a fear of dogs.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized 
controlled trial that demonstrated benefits of an intervention 
involving therapy dogs in adults with ASD. Because of its 
clinically relevant effects and remarkable adherence, AAT 
can be regarded as a promising therapy for stress-related 
outcomes in this population. More research is needed on 
the effects of AAT in the ASD population and with larger 
sample sizes.
