College of Surgeons guidelines include screening and addressing mental health recovery in trauma 
centers. Yet, many trauma centers do not monitor and address mental health recovery, and it is a 
priority to learn how to implement evidence-informed mental health programs in trauma centers.

STUDY DESIGN:  This report describes our application of the Exploration, Preparation, 
Implementation, Sustainment model to implement the Trauma Resilience and Recovery Program 
(TRRP) in 3 Level I and II trauma centers to address patients’ mental health needs. TRRP is a 
scalable and sustainable stepped model of care—one of the few in the US—that provides early 
intervention and direct services after traumatic injury.

RESULTS:  Trauma centers are well positioned to accelerate patients’ mental health recovery 
via early identification, education, screening, and referrals to mental health agencies that provide 
best-practice care. We found that TRRP was acceptable to the 3 partnering trauma centers we 
studied. Early engagement of patient, provider, and hospital administration stakeholders enhanced 
buy-in during the early stages of the implementation process and promoted sustainability. Active 
processes to support monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation were critical.

CONCLUSIONS:  Our work demonstrates the feasibility of implementing and adapting TRRP, a 
cost-efficient and sustainable stepped care intervention, in Level I and II trauma centers. Several 
factors should be carefully considered by trauma centers seeking to integrate behavioral health 
interventions into their trauma program.

Each year, 3 million Americans experience injuries so severe that they require 
hospitalization.1 Traumatic injury contributes to individual and societal costs of more 
than $210 billion annually.2 At least 1 in 5 individuals hospitalized after traumatic injury 
develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and/or other health risk outcomes 
that may lead to poor physical recovery, functional impairment, and lost productivity.3 
Trauma centers are well positioned to address patients’ behavioral health needs. American 
College of Surgeons (ACS) guidelines include an expectation for routine screening and 
mental health treatment referrals4 and recently published best practice guidelines that 
outline recommendations for integrating screening, intervention, and referral services to 
improve outcomes for traumatic injury patients.5 Recent data indicate that many US 
trauma centers do not provide education, screening, and/or direct treatment services for 
traumatically injured patients.6–9 Programs adhering to the ACS best practice guidelines 
may consider various models of care. Examples may include in-person and/or technology-
based bedside and ongoing mental health screening, psychoeducation, brief inpatient 
intervention, family support, symptom self-monitoring, care management, pharmacotherapy, 
and outpatient psychological and/or psychiatric services.6 Whereas some models of mental 
health follow-up in trauma centers have been evaluated,10–12 few studies have examined 
implementation of established models.13 A recent large-scale implementation study14 sought 
to assess the effectiveness and implementation of a brief, front-line provider delivered 
stepped collaborative care intervention in 25 US Level I trauma centers, aiming to target 
symptoms of PTSD among adult traumatic injury survivors. Trauma center clinicians 
(eg social workers, nurses, physicians) completed a one-day workshop and the site 
interventionist received supervision over the course of the intervention implementation. 
Results demonstrated that the brief collaborative intervention was feasibly delivered by

trauma center providers and that when properly implemented, resulted in reduction of PTSD 
symptoms 6 months post-injury, and for firearm survivors, 6 and 12 months post-injury.

Implementation initiatives to integrate behavioral health programs into trauma centers often 
encounter numerous challenges and needs for adaptation due to the level of variability with 
respect to hospital resources, community partnerships, predominant mechanisms of injury, 
organizational culture, and other factors. Application and examination of implementation 
strategies is needed to inform adoption of mental health programs. This report describes 
a quality improvement effort to implement the Trauma Resilience and Recovery Program 
(TRRP) in 3 Level I and II trauma centers in the Southeastern US, guided by the 
Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS)15 framework. TRRP is an 
evidence-based program launched in 2015 at our Level I trauma center to address patients’ 
mental health recovery after traumatic injury. TRRP was informed by needs assessments 
with diverse samples of traumatic injury patients,16 and we have tested feasibility of our 
model with adults and youth.11,17 Each step of the TRRP model is supported by a significant 
body of research indicating the utility and effectiveness of mental health screening,10,18,19 
symptom self-monitoring,20–23 and referral to best-practice mental health treatment.24,25 
TRRP is an interdisciplinary model with 4 steps: (1) in-hospital patient education about 
mental health recovery after traumatic injury and mental health risk screening (~10 to 15 
minutes); (2) a 30-day, automated SMS-based service to promote mental health symptom 
self-monitoring (~5 minutes); (3) a brief, telephone-based mental health screening 30 days 
following hospital discharge to assess PTSD and depressive symptoms (~15 to 20 minutes); 
and (4) referral to best-practice mental health treatment for patients who exceed clinical 
thresholds for PTSD and/or depression (~10 to 15 minutes).

TRRP is directly in line with ACS best practice guideline recommendations5 in that it uses 
a robust bedside and 30-day screening protocol that includes education, use of standardized 
and well-validated screening instruments, and referral to relevant hospital and community-
based mental health treatment resources. TRRP staff are equipped with a comprehensive 
referral database of resources and trained to educate patients about when and how to access 
these resources, if needed. Use of post-discharge screening allows us to more carefully 
screen out patients identified as high-risk at bedside who have trajectories consistent 
with resilience or rapid natural recovery.5 Finally, patients may enroll in the automated 
symptom self-monitoring program to increase emotional awareness and engagement in 
services downstream and to mitigate mental health symptoms. We have found this model 
to be feasible with moderate to high and equitable levels of patient engagement at each 
step.11,17,26 The success of this model in our hospital system, coupled with the national 
movement toward embedding evidence-based mental health programs in trauma centers, set 
the stage for the current quality improvement initiative to implement TRRP in 3 Level I and 
II partnering trauma centers.

implementation of numerous mental health programs.27–29 EPIS recognizes the unique 
role of outer system (ie environment external to the organization) and inner organizational 
context (ie characteristics within an organization) and how the implementation process is 
affected by the interplay between these contexts (bridging factors) and factors relating to 
the characteristics of the practice (innovation factors). Implementation efforts using EPIS 
can uncover new or existing needs of a population, help to identify what treatments address 
those needs, guide integration of treatment into routine practice, and inform efforts to 
sustain it.15 The EPIS framework was chosen for several reasons. First, the EPIS framework 
facilitates balancing and contextualization of input from many sources (eg trauma center 
staff, administrators, community stakeholders) across all phases of implementation. Active 
involvement of these sources in decision-making enhances quality of the evolving 
implementation strategy and allows tailoring to the unique context of each trauma center.30 
Second, EPIS takes into consideration the specific needs and available resources of 
the trauma centers. Trauma centers have varying capacities and infrastructure, and this 
framework guided efforts to examine alignment of TRRP with each center’s capabilities and 
priorities. This increases potential for successful implementation and promotes long-term 
sustainability.30 Additionally, the EPIS framework emphasizes continuous monitoring of 
progress and outcomes. This enabled the identification of challenges or areas requiring 
improvement and facilitated timely adaptations and refinements.30 TRRP is a stepped 
care model that adheres to ACS best practice screening and intervention guidelines.5 It 
is readily adaptable based on patient needs and those resources available in a trauma center. 
We set forth to evaluate our implementation efforts, characterize needed adaptations, and 
evaluate how adaptations impacted program effectiveness, acceptability, and sustainability in 
3 trauma centers with diverse needs and resources (Table 1). We adhered to the SQUIRE 
2.031 reporting guidelines.

Phase 1: Exploration—Our goal was to promote adoption of TRRP, learn how to 
feasibly implement TRRP within the trauma center’s workflow, and identify strategies to 
promote sustainability. We identified and addressed several outer and inner context factors 
(eg leadership buy-in, available funding). First, initial communications with partnering 
centers were led by our trauma surgery chief. This reinforced the multidisciplinary nature 
of the effort and the critical role of a champion at the highest levels of leadership in 
trauma surgery. Second, we conducted a full-day site visit with each center to provide 
the larger trauma program and hospital team with education about mental health recovery 
following traumatic injury, ACS requirements for trauma center verification,5 and best 
practice approaches for education and intervention5 to formally present our model and 
clinical operations data; convey recognition that one size does not fit all and our intention to 
approach implementation guided by the needs of the center; answer questions about program 
implementation and potential areas of adaptation; and identify personnel responsible for 
delivering TRRP services. We explored factors to promote sustainability, such as billing 
and reimbursement practices. We offered sites the use of our web-based, HIPAA-compliant 
patient management database software system that provides a simple, cost-efficient patient 
navigator tool to support providers as they deliver TRRP and track patients’ symptoms 
and program engagement. Third, we assessed trauma center’s needs, resources, and 
organizational workflow. This included learning the responsibilities of trauma program staff

(eg managers, coordinators), patient volume/characteristics (eg injury mechanism, insurance 
status), existing screening practices and referral resources (eg psychiatric consultations), 
other services or departments that may serve as potential partners (eg outpatient behavioral 
health services), and perceived barriers (eg limited time/personnel) and facilitators (eg 
program recognized as a priority by hospital leadership) to TRRP implementation.

Phase 2: Preparation—A site-specific implementation plan was outlined. Because this 
initiative required partnering sites to be early implementers and evaluators of the TRRP 
implementation process, and because resource limitations were a known major barrier 
among trauma centers, each site received approximately $50,000 per year over a 3-year 
period (funded by the Duke Endowment) to support the initial roll-out of TRRP. However, 
because it was known at the time the partnerships were formed that the program could not 
be sustained with grant support beyond the award period, we addressed this at the onset. 
First, we problem-solved challenges to implementation based on centers’ available resources 
and workflow. We identified members of the implementation team, usually consisting of 
a provider to deliver TRRP services to patients, a supervisor to oversee operations, and 
additional personnel to assist with implementation (eg psychiatrist consultation for highly 
distressed patients). We identified possible model adaptations to anticipate implementation 
barriers (eg integration with current screening practices). Consistent with ACS best practice 
guidelines,5 we worked with each center’s implementation team and billing department 
to explore billing practices to promote sustainability (eg learning which healthcare 
providers could be reimbursed for services; which billing codes would be appropriate for 
reimbursement for each level of TRRP), strategies to integrate TRRP within providers’ daily 
workflow (eg scheduling time for bedside screening), and mental health service settings for 
referrals. We developed training materials and outlined strategies to manage potential crisis 
situations (eg patients with suicidal ideation) at bedside and during the 30-day mental health 
screen.

Phase 3: Implementation—Our goal was to train providers to deliver TRRP, monitor 
clinical operations, assess need for program adaptations, and identify opportunities for 
improved integration. We addressed several outer and inner context factors throughout the 
implementation process using several implementation strategies.32,33 First, we trained the 
implementation team on trauma-informed care and delivery of TRRP services, adhering 
to local adaptations made during the preparation phase. Second, we worked with the 
implementation team to monitor clinic operations to assess the degree to which TRRP 
was delivered according to the adapted model (ie audit/feedback; fidelity measurement), as 
well as patient engagement in each step of TRRP. This allowed identification of barriers 
to service delivery (eg certain components being more challenging to implement than 
anticipated). We managed resources needed to administer the program, including an iPad 
that uses our data management system to identify patients who are eligible for screening and 
referral. Third, we tracked billing and reimbursement and assessed potential cost-savings 
related to centers’ use of automated TRRP components. Finally, we assessed reactions to 
TRRP implementation as it related to the center’s ability to meet patients’ needs without 
disrupting organizational workflow. This allowed for an iterative adaptation process to help 
promote patient and provider satisfaction and sustainability.

Phase 4: Sustainment—We worked with each center to support development and 
execution of billing and reimbursement practices matched to the local care delivery model. 
Trauma centers that had the capacity to offer outpatient mental health treatment via an 
institutional department or embedded mental health provider were well positioned to sustain 
the full model due to revenue generated at Step 4. We actively worked with leadership to 
ensure that services were streamlined within their workflow, accounting for variable roles 
and responsibilities of key personnel.

RESULTS

Program implementation in Level I and II trauma centers

We partnered with 2 Level I and 1 Level II centers in the Southeastern US to implement 
TRRP within their respective trauma programs. These 3 centers were strategically chosen 
with guidance from our trauma surgery chief as they were diverse regarding geographic 
location (eg rural vs urban), patient volume, infrastructure and workflow (eg number of 
trauma team providers), and populations served to provide valuable data on best strategies 
for maximizing adoption and sustained use of TRRP. Given varying needs and resources, 
local adaptations and variations in the implementation process were necessary to promote 
adoption and sustainability (Table 2).

Site A: ACS-verified adult Level I trauma center

This site is an ACS nationally verified adult Level I trauma center providing care for 
traumatic injury spanning from prevention through rehabilitation. Most common injuries 
include motor vehicles collisions, gunshot wounds, and falls.

Phase 1: Exploration—Center leadership expressed a commitment to addressing the 
mental health needs of their patients from the beginning. The lead psychiatrist on the trauma 
unit readily adopted the role of TRRP “champion” and led initial internal conversations 
and coordinated efforts to ensure that all major trauma center stakeholders were present 
during our site visit, including hospital administration (eg chief operating officer), program 
leadership (eg trauma surgery chief), and other key personnel (eg nursing staff). Having 
all stakeholders together during our visit allowed facilitators and barriers to be assessed 
more readily. This resulted in a strong preliminary action plan that considered the roles 
and responsibilities of different providers, patient volume and characteristics, and structural 
barriers (eg limited space to conduct telephone-based 30-day screens).

Phase 2: Preparation—The implementation team consisted of the trauma program 
director, inpatient psychiatrist, and program manager. Given the limited time available 
among these providers to deliver direct TRRP services to patients, this site hired outside 
of the trauma program and our team assisted with the hiring process. The TRRP 
clinic coordinator was a retired trauma nurse who had previously worked in the trauma 
program, and as such, was familiar with the center infrastructure. Next, we outlined the 
responsibilities of each member. For example, the inpatient psychiatrist volunteered to assist 
with crisis management, as needed, for highly distressed patients at bedside and during the 
30-day screen. The trauma program manager agreed to oversee the responsibilities of the

TRRP coordinator and support clinical operations (~1 to 2 hours per week). Finally, we 
created a plan to address program implementation barriers identified during the Exploration 
phase. One key barrier was the lack of outpatient behavioral health services to provide 
treatment to patients who are symptomatic at the 30-day screen. In response, we worked 
with the implementation team to develop a comprehensive referral database of community-
based services in the respective catchment area.

Phase 3: Implementation—This phase began with training the TRRP coordinator on 
delivery of the model. Because the TRRP coordinator did not have previous experience 
providing mental health screening and education, we began with guided readings on 
best practices for screening and mental health services following injury. The coordinator 
then completed a 4-day training at our facility that included structured presentations, role-
plays on delivery of the TRRP model, and live observation of our experienced TRRP 
coordinator delivering bedside and follow-up services. This was followed by a 4-day training 
at the implementation site where our team provided guidance as the TRRP coordinator 
implemented clinical services. The implementation team observed service delivery and 
at the end of the training, we assessed the need for model adaptations. For example, 
we integrated bedside TRRP mental health screening services with the center’s already 
established protocol for alcohol use problems—screening, brief intervention, and referral to 
treatment (SBIRT), a required element of trauma care for all ACS-verified trauma centers. 
The adapted process therefore included the following: bedside education on common mental 
health symptoms following injury, enrollment of patients in TRRP follow-up, completion 
of TRRP and SBIRT bedside screenings, handoff patients with positive SBIRT screens to 
the psychiatrist for brief intervention, and referral and arranging for continued PTSD and 
depression symptom monitoring and follow-up. Our success in executing and sustaining this 
model of care over the first year led to the expansion of services to this site’s ACS-verified 
Level II pediatric trauma center at their request.

Phase 4: Sustainment—We encountered several challenges to establishing billing and 
reimbursement practices. First, the limited funds available to hire a TRRP coordinator were 
not sufficient to hire a licensed healthcare professional and therefore the coordinator who 
was hired was not able to bill for services. The coordinator did have significant return on 
investment in other ways that supported the trauma program, however, including delivery 
of SBIRT services, delivery of grand rounds presentations and other reports to update the 
site on progress, and regular coordination with the medical team. Second, the trauma center 
did not have an adjacent outpatient behavioral health center, limiting the site’s capacity to 
support sustainability through revenue generated via delivery of mental health treatment. 
However, because the trauma program had an inpatient psychiatrist, billable referrals for 
psychiatric consults for medication management or for patients in acute distress were 
possible. Additionally, we worked to develop procedures to systematically track program 
goals (eg enrollment, provision of service referrals). This included conducting in-person 
quarterly on-site booster sessions, consisting of live observation of service delivery, and 
holding monthly videoconferencing calls to assist the site to monitor clinical operations, 
problem-solve challenges, and adjust the delivery model as needed to improve potential 
for sustainability. At the end of the 3-year grant period, the TRRP coordinator was fully

integrated into the trauma program, was seen as a valuable member, and was granted 
full-time employment under the trauma program budget beyond the grant period.

Site B: ACS-verified adult Level I trauma center

Site B is an ACS-verified adult Level I trauma center and has a comprehensive 
multidisciplinary trauma team serving 3,500 trauma patients annually. The most common 
injuries result from motor vehicles collisions, motorcycle collisions, and falls.

Phase 1: Exploration—After an introductory session to initiate the partnership, our team 
held weekly conference calls with the trauma program director and trauma program manager 
to describe the TRRP program, learn more about the center, and answer questions related 
to program implementation. We guided the site team as they outlined an implementation 
plan with the support of their larger trauma program team. This was followed by a 
site visit with the trauma program director, trauma program manager, and hospital case 
manager to brainstorm how to overcome potential challenges to implementation (eg ability 
to screen all patients given large patient volume, use of technologies to support patient data 
management). For example, whereas the trauma program team recognized value in the use 
of a patient management system to assist in delivery of the TRRP model, there was concern 
about whether use of an external patient management system may be burdensome on 
providers who must also record encounters in the electronic medical record. This prompted 
a formal security review, before making decisions about the use of the patient management 
system.

Phase 2: Preparation—The implementation team consisted of the trauma program 
director, the trauma program manager, and the hospital case manager. Like Site A, existing 
personnel did not have sufficient bandwidth to manage full TRRP operations, so we 
assisted with the hiring process. The TRRP clinic coordinator held a bachelor’s degree 
in psychology and formerly worked as a substance abuse counselor providing counseling 
and crisis intervention. It was decided that the trauma program manager would oversee and 
support clinical operations. The hospital case manager, a licensed social worker, agreed 
to assist with crisis management and development of a comprehensive referral database 
to connect symptomatic patients to community-based services. Finally, we developed an 
implementation plan that considered noted barriers. For example, it was decided that patients 
would need to consent to having their data stored in the patient management system. A 
consent form was developed to explain how data would be stored in the system if a patient 
enrolled in TRRP.

Phase 3: Implementation—Training procedures were comparable to the other sites 
in that the TRRP coordinator completed 4 days of training at our center followed by a 
4-day training at their site. Guided readings were not needed due to the coordinator’s 
experience providing behavioral health services. Moreover, the TRRP coordinator required 
fewer shadowing experiences before moving into service delivery with observation. TRRP 
bedside service delivery procedures were adapted to include the consent process. The 
TRRP coordinator approached patients at bedside to describe the program. If interested 
in enrollment, patients consented to use the patient management system. Approximately,

97% of patients signed the consent and were enrolled in services. Those who did not 
consent were provided a standard flyer that provided basic psychoeducation and referral 
resources. Finally, we established monthly conference calls to consult on issues related 
to clinical operations and problem solve unforeseen barriers to implementation. During 
the first 3 months of TRRP delivery, we found much lower rates of engagement in our 
text messaging program (Step 2) than we have observed in our hospital system.20 We 
anticipated that the bedside script explaining the purpose and potential benefits of the text 
messaging program required further development, and we added rationale and examples to 
the existing script. We also found that during the 30-day screen, a higher than anticipated 
percentage of patients were requesting services for needs outside of mental health, including 
housing, transportation, and financial assistance. The implementation team identified and 
added community-based agencies to address these needs to the referral database.

Phase 4: Sustainment—We sought feedback on whether TRRP satisfactorily addressed 
the needs of the trauma program, which allowed us to develop comprehensive plans to 
promote patient engagement and reduce provider burden. We encountered challenges to 
billing and reimbursement because the TRRP coordinator was not a licensed healthcare 
professional who could bill for services. To this end, we sought to identify opportunities 
for the coordinator to be fully integrated within the trauma program, including attending 
key trauma program meetings, assisting with site review and accreditation visits, and 
assisting with research. Like the approach used at Site A, the TRRP coordinator also began 
administering SBIRT services at bedside. The ability for the TRRP coordinator to become 
integrally involved in the trauma program and be seen as a key member of the patient’s 
care team was essential to successful implementation. After the end of the grant period, the 
TRRP coordinator continued to effectively screen and connect patients to follow-up mental 
health services. The coordinator was granted full-time employment by the hospital under the 
trauma program budget.

Site C: State-verified adult Level II HCA-affiliated site

This site is a ACS-verified Level II adult HCA Healthcare-affiliated trauma center providing 
care to ~1,500 traumatic injury patients admitted annually from initial assessment and 
continuing through outpatient clinic follow-up to promote physical recovery. The most 
common injuries result from motor vehicles collisions, falls, motorcycle collisions, and 
gunshot wounds.

Phase 1: Exploration—We met with the leadership team, 2 trauma surgeons, and the 
chief operating officer, all of whom expressed enthusiasm about implementing TRRP and 
developing an avenue to refer symptomatic patients to the hospital’s outpatient behavioral 
health center. Moreover, as the site was a Level II center working to achieve Level I 
designation, leadership was particularly interested in collaborating in research to enhance 
their portfolio. Discussion of barriers focused on the site’s admitted trauma population—this 
Level II center treats a relatively high proportion, compared to most Level I centers, of older 
adults and patients who had experienced falls (vs injury due to penetrating mechanism). 
Patients with ground-level fall injuries tend to be less distressed at bedside and have fewer 
mental health needs in the weeks following injury that would require intervention.34

Phase 2: Preparation—It was decided that a TRRP coordinator would be hired 
externally given the limited availability of existing personnel to add extra duties. Our team 
assisted with the hiring process but encountered significant delays around onboarding due 
to HCA protocols (eg onboarding process, access to electronic medical record). The TRRP 
coordinator hired for this role held a bachelor’s degree in psychology and had experience 
as a research assistant on a clinical research program to improve quality of child mental 
healthcare. The implementation team consisted of (1) the TRRP coordinator, responsible for 
delivery of TRRP services; (2) director of trauma services, who oversaw daily operations; 
and (3) trauma program director, who assisted in problem-solving implementation barriers. 
Over the next few months, we worked to outline a preliminary implementation plan through 
biweekly calls that focused on barriers and facilitators identified during the Exploration 
phase. One noted barrier was that some of the patient units did not have private rooms. 
We developed protocols to maximize privacy in the shared space. One noted facilitator 
was the existence of an adjunct outpatient behavioral health center. We worked with the 
implementation team and the behavioral health team to outline a referral mechanism for 
symptomatic patients identified at the 30-day screen.

Phase 3: Implementation—We implemented the training process that was developed 
for Site A because the TRRP coordinator did not have previous clinical experience. We 
worked with the site to establish key performance indicators to capture rates of enrollment 
and engagement in services. Clinical operations data initially indicated lower levels of 
enrollment at bedside among older patients and among patients admitted after experiencing a 
fall, which comprised almost half of TRRP-eligible patients. Protocols for increasing patient 
engagement at bedside (eg providing more education about possible symptom trajectories) 
were applied, evaluated, and modified. Approximately one year into implementation, the 
TRRP coordinator resigned from the institution, which resulted in a pause in patient 
care as the position was filled. Due to lower patient volume and lower levels of patient 
engagement among patients with falls, it was observed that the previous TRRP coordinator 
needed approximately 20 hours per week to deliver TRRP services. Program leadership 
therefore decided to provide effort to the trauma administrative coordinator to take on TRRP 
coordinator duties. We repeated the training process and, because the new TRRP coordinator 
was already integrated into the trauma program, the transition was seamless with strong 
continuity of communication and reporting to the broader trauma care team around TRRP 
services, progress, and patient engagement.

Phase 4: Sustainment—First, we worked to achieve a consistent billing practice by 
referring patients with clinically elevated symptoms to the hospital’s outpatient behavioral 
health clinic. This included implementing a referral process and communication plan 
between the clinics to ensure that all referred patients were contacted. We maintained regular 
bimonthly communication to assess enrollment and engagement milestones and adjust the 
delivery model to ensure sustainability. For example, over time, it was decided that patients 
with injuries caused by ground-level falls generally had low risk for development of mental 
health problems and were not good candidates to approach for enrollment unless other risk 
factors were observed that warranted engagement. The TRRP coordinator balanced the dual

DISCUSSION

Challenges and lessons learned in implementing TRRP in Level I and II trauma centers

The implementation strategies at each phase of the EPIS model were guided by the outer 
organizational context (eg ACS policy, external funding), inner organizational context 
(eg leadership support, organizational workflow), and the interplay of these variables (ie 
bridging factors) as they served to identify local adaptations to facilitate the implementation 
and sustainment of TRRP (innovation factors). Common barriers and facilitators to 
implementation and program successes are summarized in Table 3. Below we provide 
recommendations for trauma centers seeking to integrate mental health programs into their 
existing services but that may have limited funds to do so.

Outer context—Trauma centers are well positioned to address the emotional recovery 
of traumatic injury patients by implementing programs that provide education, identify 
patients at risk for developing PTSD and/or depression, and provide referrals to mental 
health services. Stepped care models, like TRRP, are well-suited to provide these services 
within trauma centers because they are designed to match patients’ needs to the appropriate 
level of intervention. Whereas most patients will experience distress following an injury, 60–
80% of these patients will recover naturally over a 1 to 2-month period post-injury without 
additional intervention. However, many patients require additional services ranging from 
education to formal outpatient mental health treatment. Therefore, as recommended by the 
ACS Best Practice Guidelines,5 screening at multiple time points allows for the provision 
of targeted interventions to meet the specific needs of the patient both in-hospital and 
following discharge. Stepped care models offer a cost-efficient and sustainable solution for 
trauma centers to satisfy ACS guidelines. These models have also been found to be feasibly 
implemented in acute care settings and effective at addressing mental health symptoms post-
injury.11,12,14,17,35 The funding our team secured for this initiative allowed us to integrate a 
clinic coordinator at the time of initial launch of TRRP, thus mitigating concerns expressed 
during initial conversations regarding the limited availability of existing trauma center 
personnel to assist with program delivery. Because this was a pilot initiative, this funding 
was critical to assuring trauma center leaders that the financial risk of this partnership in the 
early years post-launch was low. Notably, once the model was implemented and managed 
successfully over time with grant support, all 3 partnering centers continued to implement 
the program without additional grant support. Moreover, the results of this pilot initiative 
will be valuable to future partners who may wish to implement TRRP or a similar program 
with fewer resources.

Inner context system-level factors: Organizational characteristics and 
leadership—Only 3 trauma centers were approached for this initiative and all 3 were 
enthusiastic partners, largely due to the recognized need to launch a mental health program 
for trauma patients coupled with the ability to do so with an established program, expert 
support, and adequate resources. This was critical to building momentum in the early

stages of the Exploration phase as well as active participation among key stakeholders 
in the Preparation phase; and it continued to motivate the implementation teams as 
they systematically monitored ongoing clinical operations and billing and reimbursement 
practices in the Implementation and Sustainment phases. Site champions facilitated the 
implementation process and held leadership roles within the trauma program which ensured 
effective decision making around model adaptations, direct clinical operations, and support 
for the TRRP coordinator in problem-solving barriers to service delivery. Finally, embedding 
the TRRP coordinators within the medical team was essential to the success of the program 
and ensured high and consistent levels of patient engagement. This also allowed assistance 
with delivery of other existing practices and protocols (eg SBIRT), which helped to promote 
sustainability of the position in the long-term.

Inner context individual-level factors: Individual characteristics and quality 
monitoring.—Mental health screening and referral does not require specialized mental 
health expertise and can be administered following appropriate training and oversight.5 As 
such, trauma centers have several staffing options to address the ACS requirements. TRRP 
coordinators hired to provide services had varied educational and employment backgrounds. 
Whereas all coordinators delivered TRRP services effectively and were fully integrated 
into the trauma program, we found that congruence between TRRP responsibilities and 
prior training and experience had significant implications for efficiency and quality of 
start-up activities. For example, coordinators who did not have a background in mental 
healthcare required additional training and oversight. This resulted in a prolonged training 
process and required increased monitoring (ie weekly check-ins, followed by monthly, then 
quarterly), as well as problem-solving barriers to implementation during the first several 
months. To support training and quality of care, we ensured that the implementation teams 
were integrally involved in the training planning and implementation process and were 
provided with easily accessible and user-friendly training protocols (eg manuals, recorded 
demonstration trainings) to be used to train new future personnel. We also worked to 
establish procedures that allowed each center to systematically track program goals and 
generate reports highlighting key performance indicators (eg number of patients screened 
and referrals offered). Finally, we learned that only licensed mental healthcare professionals 
can bill and receive reimbursement for services. Hiring trauma-informed psychologists and 
licensed clinical counselors or social workers should be carefully considered by trauma 
centers when implementing behavioral health programs.5 They can provide best-practice 
mental healthcare in the hospital and following discharge with minimal additional training 
and supervision, and their services are reimbursable. Centers that do not have licensed 
providers for screening and services should seek additional opportunities to generate 
revenue, such as referring to in-house outpatient behavioral health programs. Hiring a 
licensed provider who can generate revenue, in the context of future partnerships, may 
support the capacity to launch and sustain mental health programs without grant funding.

Bridging factors: Community–academic partnerships—Building partnerships with 
community mental health agencies was a top priority identified during the exploration phase. 
Centers without adjunct behavioral health clinics expressed concern about not knowing what 
resources were available in the community and how to refer patients to those resources,

if needed. Consistent with ACS guidelines,5 2 key priorities for discussion included the 
availability of best-practice mental health treatments and the local and national shortage 
of mental health providers that may produce long wait lists for referred patients. We 
worked with the implementation teams to conduct an online search of available community-
based organizations and created a comprehensive database of available resources, including 
information found in the organization’s website about services provided (eg individual 
therapy, family therapy), types of treatment provided (eg trauma-focused, substance use), 
types of providers delivering care (eg psychologists, psychiatrists), accepted insurance plans, 
and preferred referral process (eg online referrals). This enabled the TRRP coordinator 
to provide referrals to patients who screened positive on the 30-day screen, as well 
as education about available treatments and personalized recommendations for the most 
appropriate type of care. Implementing referral processes for centers with adjunct outpatient 
behavioral health clinics was also necessary. This involved meeting with outpatient clinic 
personnel to provide information on TRRP clinical operations, identifying and adopting 
existing referral processes for other hospital-based programs, and evaluating and adapting 
this process to ensure efficient referral of patients to needed care. Relatedly, because centers 
serve patients who live in geographically isolated areas or even out-of-state, we identified 
strategies to connect patients with local referrals. To this end, we worked to educate the 
implementation teams on the availability and use of credible behavioral health treatment 
locators for identifying facilities across the US (eg Substance Use and Mental Health 
Services Administration). Finally, because trauma center leadership voiced concerns around 
limited resources, and in particular the limited personnel available to deliver TRRP services, 
during the Exploration phase, trauma centers should consider additional partnerships within 
the trauma program to divide tasks associated with service delivery. For example, trauma 
centers can leverage nursing personnel to administer the bedside screening and rely on social 
work support to administer the 30-day screening and connecting symptomatic patients to 
appropriate mental health resources.

Innovation factors: Innovation fit

Adaptations to the TRRP model were necessary across all our sites and our research team 
conducted regular quality improvement evaluations to assess TRRP fit within the trauma 
program. One initial major area of focus was working toward integrating TRRP with 
existing embedded services, such as SBIRT, to help to support trauma program goals. 
During the implementation phase, we found this model to be successful in addressing 
another critical area of focus, reducing both patient and provider burden (ie completing 
different screens with different providers at different time-points during their stay), and 
in helping the TRRP coordinator to become an integral member of the trauma program. 
Trauma centers should consider integration with additional hospital-based programs, such 
as peer navigation programs (eg Trauma Survivors Network), to consolidate similar 
practices, reduce burden and increase overall satisfaction.5 Finally, we leveraged our 
HIPAA-compliant patient management database software system to track clinical operations 
to quantify service delivery efforts through creation of formal reports to share with trauma 
program leadership to promote program sustainability.

CONCLUSIONS

Page 14

Trauma centers in the US are uniquely positioned to address the mental health needs of 
traumatic injury patients through early identification, screening, and provision of follow-up 
services. In the current quality improvement initiative, our work demonstrates the feasibility 
of implementing and adapting TRRP, a cost-efficient and sustainable, technology-enhanced, 
stepped care intervention, in Level I and II trauma centers. Our prior work determined that 
TRRP is feasible and acceptable to both adult and pediatric traumatic injury patients and 
provided preliminary evidence that patients have high and equitable levels of engagement 
in the model. Although effectiveness of the full model in trauma centers has not yet been 
established, each step of the model is supported by a wide range of evidence, and our team is 
conducting 2 multi-site hybrid I effectiveness-implementation trials to rigorously assess the 
impact of the model with adults and adolescents.

Several factors should be considered by trauma centers seeking to integrate behavioral 
health interventions into their trauma program. Careful consideration of implementation 
frameworks is needed to adequately meet the needs of all traumatic injury patients and 
successfully integrate behavioral health services, such as TRRP, into existing trauma 
centers. We chose to use the EPIS framework to guide our implementation process 
as it incorporates several factors deemed as essential to program implementation and 
sustainment,30 including incorporation of partner input, consideration of available resources 
and needs, and enabling ongoing progress monitoring and adaptations to improve program 
delivery. Although we selected the EPIS model to guide our initiatives, there are many 
other implementation models36 that could be considered, and the conceptual framework 
that best fits the proposed intervention, patient needs, and existing organizational structure 
should be chosen. Consistent with ACS guidelines,5 engaging patient, provider, and hospital 
administration stakeholders early in the implementation process is critical for informing the 
most suitable intervention. As well, hospital systems need active processes for monitoring 
and evaluating implementation of behavioral health services, and informing adaptation as 
needed for patients, providers, and the larger hospital system. Notably, it is imperative that 
programs consider the unique needs of vulnerable patients, including children and victims of 
violent injury, and make adaptations beyond the standard implementation infrastructure (eg 
integrating violence prevention programs) to best meet needs of all traumatic injury patients.
