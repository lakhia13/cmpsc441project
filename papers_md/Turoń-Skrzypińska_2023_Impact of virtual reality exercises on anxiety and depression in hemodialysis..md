Renal replacement therapy is associated with reduced physical activity. The aim of the study was to 
assess the relationship between regular physical activity performed with the use of virtual reality and 
the occurrence of symptoms of anxiety and depression in hemodialysis patients. The study involved 
85 patients from the dialysis station at the Department of Nephrology, Transplantology and Internal 
Medicine PUM. The examined patients were randomly divided into study group and control group. 
The study group consisted of patients undergoing renal replacement therapy by hemodialysis, 
whose task was to perform VR exercises using the prototype of the NefroVR system for 20 min during 
hemodialysis. The control group consisted of patients undergoing renal replacement therapy by 
hemodialysis who were not assigned an intervention. An intragroup analysis was performed for the 
Beck and GAD scales. After the end of the exercise cycle in the study group there was a decrease in the 
score while in the control group there was an increase in comparison to the first result. The research 
showed that after a 3‑month exercises on a bicycle with the use of low‑intensity virtual reality, a 
decrease in depression symptoms measured by the Beck Depression Inventory was observed. The 
research showed that regular physical activity using virtual reality may be associated with a reduction 
in the occurrence of anxiety and depression symptoms in patients included in the chronic hemodialysis 
program.

Anxiety is one of the common psychiatric symptoms in patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) treated 
with hemodialysis (HD). Apart from anxiety, depressive disorders also often appear. Symptoms of anxiety and 
depression occur in 50% of patients receiving renal replacement therapy using hemodialysis, and the frequency 
of their occurrence is higher than in other chronic diseases. In addition, 12–52% of patients also experience 
anxiety during the dialysis itself. Both the symptoms of anxiety and depression significantly deteriorate the 
quality of life in these patients, contribute to the occurrence of problems in social, family and work life, also 
increase the mortality  rate1–3.

Virtual Reality (VR) is a term used to describe interactive computer-generated simulations that resemble real 
objects and events. The effect of the VR system as a supplement to rehabilitation is based on user interaction with 
simulated environments and receiving real-time feedback. Thanks to this, the performance of repeated functional 
actions is ensured, which facilitates the learning of motor functions. The use of VR gives the opportunity to 
change the environment and cut off the user from sounds and images that negatively affect the person’s mood. 
Virtual Reality programs are widely used in the treatment of balance and coordination disorders, improvement 
of mobility and gait in the course of neurological diseases. Few studies on rehabilitation in a group of people 
with chronic kidney disease have been found in the  literature4–6.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and long-term dialysis make these patients anxious about being less in control 
of their own health. Emerging serious health problems contribute to the development of negative emotions in 
the form of anger, dissatisfaction, and disappointment. Moreover, the patients have a problem with accepting the 
situation, and the anxiety about their well-being after each dialysis makes them feel  helpless7. The initiation of 
dialysis significantly reduces the ability to fulfill social roles not only in the family but also in society. Therefore, 
financial problems and the awareness of dependence on others occur, leading to the loss of meaning in  life8.

condition, malaise and hemodialysis treatment make it difficult for patients to undertake and perform physical 
activity. Moreover, the group of patients treated with renal replacement therapy usually has a negative attitude 
towards undertaking physical effort. The key is to encourage hemodialysis patients to exercise therapy and life-
style modification by increasing the attractiveness of exercise, monitoring physical activity, and highlighting the 
benefits of regular  exercise10–13. Regular exercise also promotes the secretion of endorphins, which may reduce 
depression and anxiety  symptoms2,14.

The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between regular physical exercises performed with the 
use of virtual reality and the occurrence of symptoms of anxiety and depression in the group of patients treated 
with renal replacement therapy by hemodialysis.

Materials and methods
The research was performed from March 2021 to February 2022. 102 people with the fifth stage of chronic kidney 
disease, treated with renal replacement therapy by hemodialysis, were qualified for the study by a nephrologist. 
(Fig. 1). In the analysis of the surveys, it was observed that in EXAMINATION No. I, 5 patients did not complete 
the Beck questionnaire completely, 6 patients did not complete the GAD-7 questionnaire completely. In the 
EXAMINATION No. II , 6 patients did not complete the Beck questionnaire and 8 patients did not complete 
the GAD-7 questionnaire.

Ultimately, 85 patients treated with renal replacement therapy by hemodialysis (58 men, 27 women) par-
ticipated in the study. In the study was recruited all patients were treated with renal replacement therapy by 
hemodialysis at the Clinic. The study group consisted of 39 people (29 men and 10 women), and the control 
group—46 people (29 men, 17 women).

The study and control groups included End-Stage Renal Disease patients from Department of Nephrology, 
Transplantology and Internal Diseases, Pomeranian Medical University, undergoing renal replacement therapy 
by hemodialysis due to complete absence of diuresis. Patients in both groups received 3 hemodialysis sessions 
per week. The average duration of one hemodialysis session was 223,85 ± 20,47 min (X ± SD) in study group and 
216,52 ± 28,92 min (X ± SD) in control group.

The study group was selected based on the qualifying and disqualifying criteria for the research. The qualifying 
criteria for the research project were: written consent to participate in the study, complete absence of diuresis, 
inclusion in the program of renal replacement therapy by hemodialysis for at least 3 months (frequency three 
times a week), age over 18 years. The disqualifying criteria for participation in the research project were: lack 
of consent to participate in the study, diseases of the musculoskeletal system preventing the participation in the 
study, severe cardiovascular diseases (heart failure in NYHA class III or IV), acute coronary syndrome in the last 
three months, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, visual disturbances that cannot be corrected, poorly controlled 
diabetes (HbA1c levels of over 8% for 3 months), senile dementia, other neurological or mental diseases that 
prevent giving consent to the study or understanding the nature of the study and the conditions of participa-
tion in it; malignant tumors; surgical procedures performed in the last month; amputation of a lower limb, as a 
mutilation that technically precludes the possibility of conducting the examination; epilepsy.

Qualification scheme for the research.  The examined patients were randomly divided into two groups: 
study group and control group depending on the assigned intervention. The study group consisted of patients 
undergoing renal replacement therapy by hemodialysis, whose task was to perform VR exercises using the pro-
totype of the NefroVR system for 20 min during hemodialysis. The exercises was conducted three times a week 
during the first (1–2) hours of HD treatment or until UF 2.5 was achieved.

The control group consisted of patients undergoing renal replacement therapy by hemodialysis who were 

not assigned a task.

Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/A prototype of the NefroVR system was used for the study. The system consisted of the following components 

placed on a mobile platform with ballast:

•  a base unit (responsible for connecting all components and running dedicated software)
•  a rehabilitation rotor with a flywheel and a manually adjustable load (for exercises during dialysis)
•  a panoramic screen for the patient
•  a touch control screen (for the person operating the device—a doctor, nurse, or physiotherapist)
•  a control kit (for the patient)—digital joystick and one button.

The device operated on the basis of audio-visual stimulation that provoked the patient’s physical activity. 
The patient connected to the device participated in a virtual experience—in a game where movement was only 
possible with the rehabilitation rotor included in the device. The speed of the rotor rotation had an impact on 
the patient’s pace in the game. The doctor/physiotherapist treating the patient was responsible for selecting the 
appropriate ratio of the number of rotor revolutions to speed in the game and for the physical resistance of the 
flywheel in the rotor. These parameters had to be matched to the patient’s current health condition, so that the 
load was not too intense (e.g., too high heart rate or blood pressure drop/increase below/above the permitted 
values). In the clinical trial phase, patients had a choice of 5 mini-games, the gameplay of which was scheduled 
for about 15–20 min. In addition to the rotor control, the patient had additional interaction options via a digital 
joystick and one button. The level of interactivity available to the patient at the stage of clinical trials was limited 
to such an extent as to minimize the time needed to introduce the patient to the NefroVR system.

Data were collected twice: at the time of joining the research project (E0), after the third month (E3). The 
approval of the Bioethics Committee No. KB-0012/144/2020 of 5 October 2020 was obtained to conduct the 
research project.

Description of the research performed in the study and control group.  Survey research.  At the 
time of entering the research, patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire prepared specifically for the study, 
containing demographic questions regarding the health condition and lifestyle of the participant.

The respondents were asked to complete the following questionnaires: Beck Depression Inventory, General 
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) before entering the study (examination No. I) and after its completion (examina-
tion No. II).

Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is an inventory used in the diagnosis of depression. It consists of 21 ques-
tions to which the patient answers individually. There are four variants of the answer. The level of depression is 
calculated from the number of points obtained after adding them up. Patients with a result of 0–10 points were 
classified as patients with no depression or with low mood, 11–27—with moderate depression, 28 and more—
with severe  depression15–19. The General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire is a test used in the diagnosis 
of anxiety disorders. The test consists of seven questions relating to the behavior and well-being over the period 
of last two weeks on a 4-point scale. Depending on the frequency of symptoms, patients receive 0 points (not 
at all), 1 point (several days), 2 points (more than half the days) and 3 points (nearly every day). A total score is 
calculated by adding up the points for each question. The 5-, 10- and 15-point cut-offs represent mild, moderate, 
and severe anxiety  levels20–23. Before performing physical activity, after 10 min of its duration and after the end 
of exercise, the patient was asked to indicate the level of exertion in a subjective, 20-degree BORG rating scale, 
where 6, 7 meant no or minimal exertion, 8, 9—very light exertion, 10, 11—light exertion; 12, 13—somewhat 
hard exertion; 14, 15—hard exertion, 16, 17—very hard exertion, 18, 19, 20—maximal exertion. Patients reached 
exertion of no more than 13 on the Borg scale (median: 8).

During each activity with the use of the NefroVR system, the doctor was responsible for monitoring the 
blood pressure in the study group. A value equal to or higher than 160/90 mmHg was adopted as the criterion 
for stopping physical effort.

Statistical analysis.  Statistical analysis was performed using the licensed program Statistica 13.0 (StatSoft, 
Inc. Tulsa, OK, USA). In order to characterize the group, descriptive statistics, means, standard deviations, medi-
ans, as well as multiplicities and percentages were used. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the normal-
ity of the distribution of the examined variables. The evaluation of quantitative data was performed using the 
Mann–Whitney U test. For the analysis of qualitative data, the  X2 test was used, if the numerical force in a sub-
group was low, the Yates correction was used. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test for dependent variables was used 
to evaluate the differences between the values of the scale scores before the exercise cycle and after the exercise 
cycle. The level of significance was p ≤ 0.01.

Institutional review board statement.  The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki, and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Pomeranian Medical University (No. KB-0012/144/2020 
of 5 October 2020).

Informed consent statement. 

Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study.

Analysis between the study group and control group in the results obtained in the scales and 
questionnaires used in the study.  The analysis of selected grouped scales in the study was performed 
in the study group and control group before the beginning of the exercise cycle (examination No. I) and after 
the end of the exercise cycle (examination No. II). In the evaluation of the scales in examinations I and II, no 
statistically significant differences between the groups were found. The analysis of the difference between the first 
examination and the second examination showed a significant decrease in scores in the study group on the Beck 
scale (p < 0.001) and the GAD scale (p < 0.001). The results are presented in Table 2.

An intragroup analysis was performed for the GAD-7 scale. In the examination No. II (after the end of the 
exercise cycle) compared to the examination No. I (before the beginning of the exercise cycle), a drop in the 
score was observed in the study group (p < 0.001). On the other hand, there was an increase in the control group 
(p = 0.002). The results are shown in Fig. 3.

Discussion
Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in patients treated with renal replacement therapy by 
 hemodialysis24–26. Factors that contribute to the emergence of depression and anxiety in this group of patients 
are the chronic nature of renal replacement therapy, physical symptoms (fatigue, insomnia, waiting for a possible 
kidney transplant) and the lack of prospects for complete  recovery26,27.

The studies by Zhang et al. (2014) showed that depression and anxiety were more common in the group of 
hemodialysis patients compared to the group of healthy  persons28. In addition, Murillo-Zamora et al. (2016) 
suggest that the prevalence of depression among adult patients undergoing HD is high and independent of the 
time since initiation of the  therapy29. Also, Li YN et al. (2016) emphasize that symptoms of anxiety and depres-
sion are observed in the majority of hemodialysis  patients30. The reported incidence of depression in the group 
of patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) ranges from 22.8% to 39.3%31.

The literature describes many of the benefits of practicing and increasing regular physical activity for the 
health and well-being of patients with chronic kidney  disease32–35. Despite this fact, in this group of patients 
there is still significantly lower level of physical activity compared to persons with normal kidney  function36,37.
Currently, we are also witnessing a dynamic increase in the number of clinical studies that unequivocally 
confirm the beneficial role of physical exercises in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However,

despite the existence of documented examples of effective exercise programs considered safe and therapeutically 
beneficial, physiotherapy in nephrology remains limited  worldwide5,6,32,38–40.

For several decades, scientists and clinicians have been conducting research or implementing exercise pro-
grams in hemodialysis patients, the main goal of which is to improve their health, including mental  health41. 
Blumenthal et al. (2012) believe that exercises can be one of the methods of treating depression in a different 
group of  patients42,43.

Own research showed that after a 3-month exercises on a bicycle with the use of low-intensity virtual reality, 
a decrease in depression symptoms measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was observed. Similar 
results were presented in the work of Rhee et al. (2019), who assessed a six-month physical activity during 
 hemodialysis44. Also, in the study of the relationship between physical activity and exercise with accessories 
during hemodialysis conducted by Esteve Simo et al. (2015), a reduction in the level of depression on the Beck 
scale was  found45. Similarly, the meta-analysis by Hargrove et al. (2021) demonstrated a reduction in depression 
symptoms measured on the Beck scale due to regular physical activity in patients treated with  hemodialysis46.

Research confirms that hemodialysis patients show symptoms of anxiety. The presented studies showed a 
decrease in anxiety symptoms measured by the GAD 7 questionnaire after the use of an intervention consisting 
in performing physical activity in virtual reality.

In the available literature, no studies were found that would be based on a similar analysis in the group of 
patients treated with hemodialysis. It was the first study to assess the effect of exercises with the use of virtual 
reality performed during hemodialysis on the occurrence of anxiety and depression symptoms in a group of HD 
patients. The performed preliminary examinations showed that there may be a relationship between physical 
activity with the use of virtual reality and the reduction of symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients treated 
with hemodialysis. The analysis of the literature confirmed the effectiveness of exercises with the use of virtual 
reality in the treatment of symptoms of depression and anxiety in other groups of  patients47–51.

Research on the use of virtual reality in reducing anxiety symptoms has also been reviewed. Viana et al. (2020) 
found that playing a exercises game appears to be a useful method of reducing anxiety in healthy  women52. In 
turn, Eijlers et al. (2019) showed that the use of VR effectively reduced anxiety in pediatric  patients53. Recently, 
VR technology has been used in clinical settings with positive outcomes for patients experiencing severe pain 
and psychological  phobias54.

During the analysis of the literature, research using virtual reality exercises, the aim of which was to improve 
physical fitness in groups of people treated with dialysis, has been  found5,55. In addition, it has been shown that 
the use of virtual reality during intradialytic exercises increases physical activity, improves physical fitness and 
the quality of life of persons undergoing  dialysis4.

Studies by other authors have confirmed the positive impact of virtual reality exercise on the quality of life. 
The use of video games during exercise training enables an interesting form of rehabilitation focused on fun and 
is an effective supplement to traditional  therapy56,57. Studies suggest that in adults undergoing hemodialysis, the

there was an increase (p = 0.002) in comparison to the first result.

negative symptoms of depression are reduced by aerobic  exercise58. Others also argue that symptoms of anxiety 
and depression in hemodialysis patients can be reduced with various treatments, including regular  exercise59. 
Also, a combination of aerobic and anaerobic training during dialysis is effective for symptoms of depression in 
terms of mental  health60.

There is no doubt that accumulating evidence documents the advantages and health benefits of positive 
emotions and psychological resources in the context of stress and illness-related trauma. VR technology can 
become a powerful tool for delivering mental health programs to clinical populations during outpatient treat-
ment  sessions61.

It is worth emphasizing that physical exercises with the use of virtual reality during hemodialysis treat-
ment means: the possibility of using the time that the patient spends in the dialysis center (no additional time 
is required outside of dialysis), attraction for patients (reduction of the monotony of dialysis), promotion of a 
healthy lifestyle, safety (medical supervision of the staff and availability of medical equipment) and improve-
ment of mental health.

Limitations.  This study has many limitations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was conducted in one 
dialysis center and a small number of participants was recruited.

The results obtained were also affected by the deteriorating health of CKD patients, renal replacement therapy 
and the presence of various comorbidities. In the study of patients with chronic kidney disease treated by hemo-
dialysis, it was difficult to find persons willing to participate in this project to assess their physical activity. It was 
also necessary to properly select physical activity in a way that would allow the examined persons to perform 
the recommended intervention. The size of the study group during the research project was reduced for inde-
pendent reasons, such as kidney transplants and deaths among project participants. In the conducted study, the 
psychological aspect of the introduction of virtual reality could have made hemodialysis patients more willing 
to perform physical activity. This could have been an independent factor affecting the course of the study. In 
the continuation of the research, it is necessary to increase the size of the study group, which would allow for a 
more accurate analysis of these relationships.

Conclusions
The research showed that regular exercises using virtual reality may be associated with a reduction in the occur-
rence of anxiety and depression symptoms in patients included in the chronic hemodialysis program. It is crucial 
to encourage patients to perform physical activity in virtual reality due to the possibility of improving their 
mental health. It is worth considering performing similar studies not only in the group of hemodialysis patients, 
but also among patients treated with other methods of renal replacement therapy.
