Community-Based Cluster-Randomized Trial to Reduce Opioid 
Overdose Deaths

A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.

Abstract

BACKGROUND—Evidence-based practices for reducing opioid-related overdose deaths include 
overdose education and naloxone distribution, the use of medications for the treatment of opioid 
use disorder, and prescription opioid safety. Data are needed on the effectiveness of a community-
engaged intervention to reduce opioid-related overdose deaths through enhanced uptake of these 
practices.

METHODS—In this community-level, cluster-randomized trial, we randomly assigned 67 
communities in Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio to receive the intervention (34 
communities) or a wait-list control (33 communities), stratified according to state. The trial was 
conducted within the context of both the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic and a 
national surge in the number of fentanyl-related overdose deaths. The trial groups were balanced 
within states according to urban or rural classification, previous overdose rate, and community 
population. The primary outcome was the number of opioid-related overdose deaths among 
community adults.

RESULTS—During the comparison period from July 2021 through June 2022, the population-
averaged rates of opioid-related overdose deaths were similar in the intervention group and 
the control group (47.2 deaths per 100,000 population vs. 51.7 per 100,000 population), for 
an adjusted rate ratio of 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.09; P = 0.30). The effect 
of the intervention on the rate of opioid-related overdose deaths did not differ appreciably 
according to state, urban or rural category, age, sex, or race or ethnic group. Intervention 
communities implemented 615 evidence-based practice strategies from the 806 strategies selected 
by communities (254 involving overdose education and naloxone distribution, 256 involving the 
use of medications for opioid use disorder, and 105 involving prescription opioid safety). Of 
these evidence-based practice strategies, only 235 (38%) had been initiated by the start of the 
comparison year.

CONCLUSIONS—In this 12-month multimodal intervention trial involving community 
coalitions in the deployment of evidence-based practices to reduce opioid overdose deaths, death 
rates were similar in the intervention group and the control group in the context of the Covid-19

pandemic and the fentanyl-related overdose epidemic. (Funded by the National Institutes of 
Health; HCS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04111939.)

Rates of opioid-related overdose deaths have been a rising scourge in the United States, 
with an increase in the annual number of deaths from 8050 in 19991 to 82,136 in 2022.2 
This increase was initially attributed to excessive opioid prescribing and more recently 
to the expansion of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply.3 Fentanyl has become the primary 
illicit opioid and has contaminated stimulants4 and counterfeit pills,5 along with escalating 
the rate of opioid-related overdose deaths disproportionately among Black and Indigenous 
populations.6,7

In 2016, the U.S. Surgeon General urged medical professionals to address the opioid crisis 
through advocacy, stigma reduction, uptake of treatment for opioid use disorder, and safer 
opioid prescribing.8 The National Academy of Medicine echoed this recommendation in 
2017.9 Both reports highlighted the value of evidence-based practices to prevent or reverse 
opioid overdoses. These practices include education regarding overdose prevention and 
naloxone distribution,10,11 the use of medications (including methadone and buprenorphine) 
for the treatment of opioid use disorder,12,13 and safer opioid prescribing, dispensing, and 
disposal practices (i.e., prescription opioid safety).14

Despite efforts to advance evidence-based practices in the United States,15 patient-level 
and organizational barriers such as stigma16 and regulations9 impede care delivery,9,17 
transportation options,18 prescriber access,19 and naloxone availability.20 In the United 
States, fewer than 1 in 5 persons with opioid use disorder received medications for treatment 
in 2021,21 with even lower rates among Black persons.22 Overdose education at the 
community level and the availability of naloxone distribution are inadequate to achieve a 
substantial reduction in opioid-related overdose deaths, according to simulation models.23

To address these barriers, the National Institutes of Health launched the HEALing (Helping 
to End Addiction Long-term Initiative) Communities Study (HCS), a large, multistate 
implementation-science trial focused on substance use.24 The HCS research consortium 
designed the community-engaged, data-driven Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention 
to rapidly scale up strategies to increase access to evidence-based practices and conduct 
communication campaigns in highly affected communities in Kentucky, Massachusetts, New 
York, and Ohio, with the primary goal of reducing the rate of opioid-related overdose 
deaths.25

Methods

TRIAL DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT

The HCS was a multisite, community-level, cluster-randomized, controlled trial to evaluate 
the CTH intervention in reducing the rate of opioid-related overdose deaths in highly 
affected communities.25 The trial was grounded in the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, 
Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) and the Practical, Robust Implementation and 
Sustainability Model (PRISM) implementation-science framework.26

The trial protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) was approved by 
Advarra, a company providing research review services that served as the single institutional 
review board for the trial. A waiver of consent and full waiver of Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization were granted for secondary data 
analysis. The data and safety monitoring board, chartered by the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse, monitored the trial. Data that are reported in this trial are protected by multiple 
data-use agreements among researchers and agencies providing the data.

The authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of 
the trial to the protocol. Details regarding the authors’ roles in manuscript preparation are 
provided in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.

TRIAL POPULATION

All the participating communities (the unit of analysis) had a high baseline rate of opioid-
related overdose deaths (≥25 per 100,000 adults); at least 30% of the communities were 
rural. The demographic characteristics of the trial populations were similar to those in the 
overall U.S. populations that have been severely affected by fatal opioid overdoses (Fig. S2).

TRIAL PROCEDURES, INTERVENTION, AND RANDOMIZATION

The CTH intervention was adapted from the evidence-based Communities That Care 
approach that used a five-phase process to support communities in selecting and 
implementing evidence-based practices to prevent adolescent substance use.27 The CTH 
intervention used a similar phased-planning process with community coalitions that 
included local residents who had involvement in the crisis of opioid use disorder through 
their vocation or personal experience.28 Coalitions assessed the local effect of opioid 
overdose using data to understand gaps and resources.29 They implemented communication 
campaigns promoting opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution, the use of 
medications for opioid use disorder, and messages to reduce stigma through print, digital, 
radio, outdoor, and social media channels.30 Funds were allocated to the HCS intervention 
communities to implement strategies for evidence-based practices and communication 
campaigns, with an average allocation per intervention community of $672,000 in New 
York, $922,500 in Ohio, $1.69 million in Kentucky, and $1.72 million in Massachusetts.

The HCS investigators have previously described the implementation-science framework26 
and the CTH intervention, along with strategies and implementation resources,31 
community-engaged processes to select and promote adoption and sustainability of 
evidence-based practices,29 communication campaigns to drive demand and reduce 
stigma,30 and community dashboards to support data-driven strategy selection.32 A strategy 
for evidence-based practices was considered to have been implemented if at least one service 
had been delivered. The number of persons who had been exposed to each strategy was 
not uniformly assessed. Thus, the pragmatic definition threshold for implementation was the 
provision of a single service.

We used a covariate-constrained randomization procedure,33 stratified according to state. 
Within each state, the intervention and control groups were balanced according to urban or 
rural classification, rate of opioid-related overdose deaths, and population.25

TIMELINE

OUTCOMES

Page 4

The intervention was delivered from January 2020 through June 2022 and later to the 
previous control communities from July 2022 through December 2023 (Fig. S3). Most 
implementation of evidence-based practices in the intervention communities occurred from 
September 2020 through June 2022, except for some early overdose education and naloxone 
distribution strategies in response to orders for early release of inmates from detention 
centers related to the coronavirus 2019 disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The comparison 
period between intervention and control communities was the 12-month period from the 
beginning of July 2021 through the end of June 2022.28

The primary outcome was the number of opioid overdose deaths among community adults, 
as determined from death certificates with drug overdose as an underlying cause of death 
(International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] codes X40 to X44, X60 
to X64, X85, and Y10 to Y14) due to opioids (contributing cause of death, ICD-10 codes, 
T40.0 to T40.4 and T40.6). In Kentucky, additional death-investigation records determined 
opioid involvement if specific drugs were absent from death certificates.34 Deaths were 
attributed to individual communities on the basis of the residence address on the death 
certificate. A post hoc secondary analysis evaluated the change in rates from 2019 through 
the comparison period as the outcome.

ADVERSE EVENTS

We used the mean rate of emergency medical service runs for a suspected opioid overdose 
per 1000 adults to assess potential adverse events and serious adverse events in the 
community. Adverse events and serious adverse events were reported if a community rate in 
a single month increased by more than 3 standard deviations above the moving average of 
the previous 3 months for adverse events or by more than 4 standard deviations for serious 
adverse events. The number of emergency medical service runs for a suspected opioid 
overdose was a surrogate measure for opioid-related overdose deaths because of the much 
shorter lag-time availability for data regarding such runs as compared with deaths (1 to 3 
months vs. 6 to 11 months).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

We determined that the inclusion of 67 communities would provide the trial with 99% 
power to detect a prespecified 40% reduction in the rate of opioid-related overdose deaths 
in the intervention group as compared with the control group and 83% power to detect 
a 20% reduction in the overdose death rate. We performed analyses using the intention-to-
treat principle for the 67 randomized communities. There were no missing data for these 
analyses. A negative binomial regression analysis modeled the population-averaged rate 
of opioid-related overdose deaths with the natural log of the adult community population 
as the offset, after adjustment for state, urban or rural classification, and community-level 
baseline rates.35 Small sample-adjusted empirical estimates of standard error were used to 
ensure valid inference.36 The model accounted for clustering by means of the overdispersion

parameter; the estimated positive value (i.e., variance exceeding mean) indicated that the 
negative binomial model was appropriate.

In prespecified exploratory analyses, the primary model was extended to assess the potential 
interaction of trial group and five variables: state, urban or rural category, age (categorical), 
sex, and race or ethnic group. We applied multiple-testing adjustments according to the 
Benjamini–Hochberg procedure37 (using sequential modified Bonferroni correction for 
multiple hypothesis testing) only to the P values from the five effect-modification tests. We 
report rate ratio estimates to compare the two groups of communities for each level of the 
given categorical variables, along with 95% confidence intervals adjusted by a Bonferroni 
correction on the basis of the number of levels.

We performed a secondary per-protocol analysis with the exclusion of one intervention 
community that withdrew before the initiation of the intervention. The primary test was 
two-sided, with a P value of less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance.

A series of post hoc analyses (Table S1) included four sensitivity analyses in which 
we fit a modified Poisson regression model, which assumed no overdispersion; used log 
transformation for the baseline rate of opioid-related overdose deaths, which excluded one 
community with no deaths at baseline; included an interaction between state and urban 
or rural category; included an interaction between the intervention group and the state, 
which generated a rate ratio averaged across states; and evaluated combinations of the five 
variables as listed above. We assessed the goodness of fit for both the negative binomial 
and Poisson models and determined that the negative binomial provided a better fit than 
the Poisson model on the basis of plots of deviance residuals (Fig. S4), various fit statistics 
(Table S2), and the positive dispersion parameter. All the analyses were performed with the 
use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute). The results of secondary and exploratory 
analyses that were not part of a hierarchical statistical plan and that controlled for multiple 
comparisons are reported as point estimates with 95% confidence intervals, from which 
causal inferences should not be made.

RESULTS

BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS

The 67 communities (adult population, 8.2 million) were randomly assigned to either 
the intervention group (34 communities, including 15 rural) or the control group (33 
communities, including 14 rural) (Fig. 1 and Fig. S5). The designated communities included 
48 counties, 14 municipalities (11 in Massachusetts and 3 in New York), and rural clusters 
of municipalities (5 in Massachusetts). The mean (±SD) baseline rate of opioid-related 
overdose deaths was similar in the intervention group and the control group (38.2±22.8 
and 37.1±20.3 per 100,000 population, respectively). Baseline community characteristics are 
shown in Table 1.38,39

IMPLEMENTATION OF EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES

Intervention communities implemented 615 evidence-based practice strategies (254 
involving overdose education and naloxone distribution, 256 involving the use of

medications for opioid use disorder, and 105 involving prescription opioid safety). However, 
only 235 of the 615 strategies (38%) were implemented before the comparison period: 
43% involving overdose education and naloxone distribution, 36% involving the use of 
medications for opioid use disorder, and 32% involving prescription opioid safety. Details 
regarding the implementation of these strategies are provided in Tables S3, S4, and S5.

RATES OF OPIOID OVERDOSE DEATHS

Unadjusted means and rate ratios for the number of opioid-related overdose deaths during 
the 12-month comparison period are reported according to trial group, state, urban or rural 
category, age, sex, and race or ethnic group (Table 2).40 The overall unadjusted rate ratios 
of opioid-related overdose deaths comparing the intervention group with the control group 
were 0.94 (on the basis of the mean unadjusted rates across communities) and 0.82 (on 
the basis of the sum of unadjusted rates across communities). In the primary adjusted 
analyses, the rate of opioid-related overdose deaths was 47.2 per 100,000 population for the 
intervention communities and 51.7 per 100,000 population for the control communities (rate 
ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.09; P= 0.30) (Table 3). The results of the 
per-protocol analysis were similar to those in the primary analysis (Table 3). There was no 
evidence of effect modification according to state, urban or rural category, age, sex, or race 
or ethnic group (Table 4), although there was substantial variability among states and among 
urban and rural locations.

ADVERSE EVENTS

The risks of adverse events and serious adverse events (as defined according to the number 
of opioid-related emergency medical service runs) were similar in the two groups (Table S6). 
None of the adverse events or serious adverse events were attributed to the trial intervention.

PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS AND NONCOMPLIANCE REPORTS

Five protocol deviations were reported with respect to consent procedures. One 
noncompliance report was related to a lack communication with the institutional review 
board regarding revisions to the trial protocol (Fig. S6).

DISCUSSION

The HCS was a large implementation-science trial focused on substance use involving 67 
communities with high rates of opioid-related overdose deaths in four states. During the 
comparison year (July 2021 through June 2022) across communities, 4517 deaths were 
linked to opioid overdoses. Despite the breadth and depth of the intervention, the risk 
of opioid-related overdose death was similar in the intervention group and the control 
group. Numerous factors may have tempered the effect of the intervention. Of these factors, 
three warrant discussion: the duration and intensity of the implementation, the Covid-19 
pandemic, and the evolving illicit drug market.

First, the evidence-based practices were addressed by a complex array of strategies for 
high-risk populations in health care, behavioral health, and criminal legal sectors. After the 
strategy selection process, only 10 months preceded the comparison period to establish

agency partnerships and implement evidence-based practices.28 The time frame was 
insufficient to initiate many strategies for evidence-based practices, which often required 
recruiting new staff from an increasingly scarce health care workforce, changing clinical 
practice workflows, or developing new interagency collaborations to introduce services (e.g., 
in criminal legal settings). Ultimately, 615 strategies were implemented, which suggests the 
effectiveness of the CTH intervention in mobilizing communities to pursue the adoption of 
evidence-based practices. However, greater penetrance of the practices through continuous 
quality improvement and longer time horizons may be needed to observe the full effect of 
the CTH intervention on opioid-related overdose deaths.41

Second, the intervention launch (in January 2020) occurred 2 months before the Covid-19 
shutdown, which severely disrupted systems targeted by the CTH intervention. Through 
a protocol amendment, 6 months were added for implementation, but the initiation of 
activities of the organizations was still delayed. Hence, the pandemic reduced the capacity 
of communities to implement the CTH intervention, which mitigated the potential for the 
intervention to affect the rate of opioid-related overdose deaths.

Third, the change in the illicit drug market may have reduced the effectiveness of the 
intervention, because fentanyl became a more prevalent opioid and a more commonly used 
adulterant in stimulants4 and counterfeit pills.5 Both fentanyl and, increasingly, xylazine42 
posed new challenges for opioid-overdose treatment. We do not know whether surges in 
fentanyl use over time were similar across communities.

The embrace of evidence-based practices by coalitions in the intervention communities 
varied considerably in part because of competing challenges posed by the Covid-19 
pandemic, the fentanyl epidemic, and continuing stigma related to drug use — all of which 
affected willingness and capacity to respond to the opioid crisis. The CTH intervention 
had a major effect on the implementation of evidence-based practices (615 of 806 that 
were selected) and communication campaigns (with 165 implemented). Failure to observe 
significant reductions in opioid-related overdose deaths may have resulted from the temporal 
lags between organizational implementation and the servicing of a sufficiently large number 
of affected persons. In retrospect, the prespecified 40% reduction in opioid-related overdose 
deaths was clearly ambitious. The trial may have been underpowered to detect substantially 
smaller yet clinically meaningful differences.

The trial has several strengths. The coalitions used timely data to inform the selection of 
many strategies for evidence-based practices and communication. Heterogeneous coalitions, 
including members with lived experience who were working with university and state 
public health partners, enhanced the decision-making process and established partnerships 
for future sustainability. The randomized, controlled trial design involving 67 communities 
that were balanced with respect to key covariates addressed threats to internal validity. 
Finally, coalitions created a sense of urgency and developed partnerships among community 
agencies, persons with lived experience, public health practitioners, and government officials 
to address the opioid crisis.

Several trial limitations are noteworthy. First, despite randomization, differences among 
states may have played a role in observed outcomes. For example, the number of residents 
in HCS communities in the state with the lowest population (Massachusetts, with 715,859 
residents) was less than 20% of that in the state with the highest population (Ohio, with 
3,984,476 residents). In addition, the steep rise in opioid-related overdose deaths during the 
Covid-19 pandemic was not uniform across states. For example, from January 2020 through 
June 2022, Kentucky had an increase in deaths of 77% as compared with an increase 
of 15% in Massachusetts.2 These differences led to variation in the absolute number of 
persons who could benefit from the allocated trial resources. It is possible that secular trends 
and contamination by the inadvertent exposure of control communities to evidence-based 
practice strategies may have attenuated the effect of the CTH intervention. For example, 
control communities could access non-HCS funds to address the opioid epidemic. These 
funds became more available in response to increases in opioid-related overdose deaths 
during the Covid-19 pandemic and may have resulted in activities that could have masked an 
intervention effect. Also, adults in control communities that were proximal to intervention 
communities may have been exposed to CTH evidence-based practices and communication 
campaigns. Another limitation is that the HCS did not consistently assess the number of 
persons who were affected by the strategies that were implemented in the intervention 
communities.

HCS investigators examined the potential of the community-engaged, data-driven CTH 
intervention to reduce the rate of opioid-related overdose deaths in highly affected 
communities. Intervention communities implemented hundreds of strategies to expand 
opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution, the use of medications for opioid 
use disorder, and safety measures for prescription opioid use, as well as communication 
campaigns to support these efforts. Although there were no significant between-group 
differences in the rate of opioid-related overdose deaths, the trial showed that the CTH 
community-engaged intervention, with its leveraging of community coalitions and a data-
driven approach, can bring about meaningful progress in implementing evidence-based 
practices.

Figure 1. Enrollment and Randomization.
Shown are the randomization procedures and analyses that were performed in the 67 
communities that participated in the HEALing Communities Study (HCS) in Kentucky, 
Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio. The HCS research consortium designed the 
Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention to rapidly scale up strategies to reduce the 
rate of opioid-related overdose deaths. One intervention community was not included in 
the per-protocol analysis because the community withdrew before the initiation of the 
intervention.

Plus–minus values are means ±SD. Listed are data for adults (≥18 years of age) during the comparison period from July 1, 2021, to June 30, 
2022. For communities that represent counties (48 of 67), population information is drawn from 2020 Bridged-Race Population Estimates.39 For 
communities that represent units smaller than counties (19 of 67), population information is drawn from 2017–2021 American Community Survey 
5-Year Estimates.40 Figure S2 in the Supplementary Appendix provides additional data regarding the total number of opioid-related overdose 
deaths in community subgroups.

Listed are results obtained during the comparison period from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022. Data were analyzed by means of a negative 
binomial model after adjustment for trial group, state (Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio), urban or rural category, and baseline rate of 
opioid-related overdose deaths. The natural log of the community population size during the comparison period is used as an offset.

†

P values are reported only for the primary analysis and for additional prespecified analyses that controlled for multiple testing.

Listed are results obtained during the comparison period from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022. A separate negative binomial model was fit for 
each test of effect modification. Each model included the fixed effects of trial group, state, urban or rural category, baseline opioid-related overdose 
death rate, stratification variable (age, sex, and race or ethnic group), and a two-way interaction between the trial group and the stratification 
variable.
