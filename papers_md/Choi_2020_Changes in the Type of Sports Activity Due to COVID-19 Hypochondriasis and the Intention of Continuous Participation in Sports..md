Abstract: This study focused on empirically analyzing sport activity participants’ perceptions of
hypochondriasis caused by fear of infection and changes in continuous participatory behavior patterns.
To this end, a comparative analysis was conducted with a focus on the forms of participation and
age of sport activity participants. For the ﬁnal comparative analysis, a 2 × 3 factorial multivariate
analysis of variance was conducted after conﬁrming the validity and reliability of data based on 229
questionnaires collected from healthy respondents who have never been infected with COVID-19.
The results showed statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between worry about illness, which is a
subscale of hypochondriasis, disease phobia, thanatophobia, and intent to continue according to age.
Statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were also found when considering the type of sport for worry about
illness, which is a subscale of hypochondriasis, disease phobia, symptom preoccupation, and intent
to continue. Furthermore, interaction eﬀects between the two independent variables, i.e., age and
type of sport, were found for disease phobia, a subscale of hypochondriasis, and thanatophobia.
In summary, age and type of sport, which are important factors for the COVID-19 infection and
symptoms, were found to aﬀect the sport activity patterns. These results proved that COVID-19 may
have caused the participants to have diﬀerent perceptions depending on their characteristics and
change their form of continuous participation. These ﬁndings will provide useful data for predicting
the perception and behavioral patterns of sports participants if diseases like COVID-19 occur in the
future. They also show how to live a healthy life through exercise.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background

According to Sato, Jordan, and Funk [1], there is an increased interest in healthy living in
contemporary society, as well as an eﬀort to attain it. In particular, the work–life balance, which has
taken center stage recently, implies that people can control and adjust their lives by themselves and
that they can reach a state of satisfaction with their lives by properly distributing psychological and
physical energy between their work and leisure [2]. Such a work–life balance is a universal concept
necessary to attain an enjoyable life for all classes of people (i.e., men, women, married, unmarried,
the youth, and the elderly), and it occurs in various dimensions (e.g., commitment to and reward of
work, as well as health and safety, human relations, and stress management) [3]. In this social climate,

leisure activities or outdoor physical activities are considered as very important activities that can
lead to one’s physical health, as well as psychological stability [4,5]. Recently, however, external or
environmental threats not encountered before have been increasing in number and frequency.

Recently, respiratory viruses have started to pose a mortal threat to the health of people around
the globe, and it is highly likely that they will continue to pose a threat to humanity. Speciﬁcally,
respiratory syndromes such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS) have been encountered in the past, and in 2019, a diﬀerent type of respiratory
syndrome called coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is paralyzing the world [6]. So far, because it
is known that COVID-19 is transmitted through droplets or personal contact, prevention guidelines for
sneezing and touching contaminated objects should be strictly observed [7]. Generally, COVID-19 has
an incubation period of 1–14 days, and it shows various respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough,
dyspnea, and pneumonia, which can range from mild to severe in severity [8]. Vaccines are currently
being developed, and the fatality rate is commonly known to be between 1% and 2%. However, death
is more frequent in the case of patients with underlying diseases, compromised immunity, or advanced
age [9].

Ultimately, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic in March
2020 [10]. That is, the COVID-19 pandemic is judged globally to be in the highest risk phase among
pandemic alert phases. The state of emergency was declared in almost all regions, including Asia,
North America, and Europe, and due to a sharp increase in the number of conﬁrmed cases of infection
and death, administrative orders were issued to temporarily shut down all facilities except the essential
ones, such as hospitals and grocery stores, and national infrastructure that supplies electricity or
water [11]. People have been advised to refrain from outside activities and isolate themselves at home,
and practice social distancing that minimizes contact with others [12].

People are anxious about the possibility of infection by the highly contagious virus despite various
social codes of conduct set to prevent its spread. The psychological anxiety of becoming infected by
someone in situations where total self-isolation is impossible due to the reality also aﬀects the lives of
most healthy people [13]. Researchers have considered hypochondriasis as a type of physical disorder,
but Rachman [14] has recently contended that it is desirable to understand it as excessive anxiety related
to disease. That is, hypochondriasis is conceptualized as a type of psychological anxiety disorders.
The reason is that the common psychological changes in hypochondriasis, such as severe anxiety
and over-interpretation of minor physical symptoms, are also frequently observed in typical anxiety
disorders [15]. Summarizing previous studies, it appears to be appropriate to consider hypochondriasis
as a syndrome due to interactions among complex symptoms rather than one symptom [16]. It may
be valid to consider the conceptualizations of hypochondriasis as complementary explanations of
the various aspects of hypochondriasis that are diﬃcult to deﬁne by one word rather than as being
exclusive to each other [17]. The reason for selecting hypochondriasis as an important factor in the
present study was that the epidemic of infectious viruses such as COVID-19 after SARS and MERS will
continue to occur in the future, and research on the majority of the citizens who are currently healthy
but experience anxiety about infection is required as much as the research on core subjects, such as the
eﬀective policies of government agencies that are responsible for developing therapeutic agents and
controlling diseases.

The variable used as a key factor in the present study was the intention of continuous participation.
This was done due to the fact that most people continue their everyday lives because the government
did not enforce measures such as mandatory travel restrictions despite the widespread fear or anxiety
caused by COVID-19. In particular, daily physical or leisure activities not only minimize psychological
damages such as hypochondriasis as pointed out above but also improve the immune system that
ﬁghts against viruses [18]. There are people who enjoy personal exercise that does not require
contact with other people and who practice social distancing, while there are others who continue to
participate in group exercises like before, and it was deemed meaningful to analyze whether there
were changes in the life patterns in a situation where COVID-19 continues to spread. It is known that

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4871

3 of 11

the intention of continuous participation arises from positive psychological outcomes such as pleasure,
joy, and satisfaction due to participation [19]. There are previous studies [18,20] reporting that physical
activities help maintain positive psychological state and reduce stress or anxiety, but group activities
in which contact with others occurs are extremely restricted in special situations where COVID-19
is prevalent. Consequently, analyzing changes that occur in the behavior of people who currently
participate in various types of sports activities may contribute to foreseeing and preparing for possible
future epidemics.

1.2. Objectives

In the case of South Korea where the present study was conducted, the number of conﬁrmed
cases sharply increased after the ﬁrst conﬁrmed case on 20 January 2020, but currently, there is a
decrease recorded [21]. However, psychological anxiety and concerns are increasing not only due to
limitations in outdoor activities, but also physical and leisure activities by voluntary social distancing
and compliance with self-isolation rules for an extended period. In addition, because COVID-19 is
transmitted through droplets or personal contact, physical activities are limited, which resulted in
changes in the leisure patterns of people. Accordingly, the present study analyzes the health concerns
caused by COVID-19 and the intention of people to continue to participate in sports. Speciﬁcally,
age (i.e., young, middle-aged, older adults) and type of sport (individual and group sport activities),
which may act as the most important variables for the COVID-19 infection, were set as independent
variables, and hypochondriasis and the intention of continuous participation were set as dependent
variables. The present study is considered to be an important research attempt that analyzes and
predicts the behavior of people not only in COVID-19 but also future pandemics because of the
continuous outbreaks of respiratory syndromes.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study Design

Data were collected from 10 March to 6 April 2020 in the Han River National Park and from
three large sports centers located in Seoul. The survey was conducted when the whole nation became
aware of the seriousness of COVID-19 in that the number of conﬁrmed cases sharply increased after
the ﬁrst conﬁrmed case on 20 January 2020, and on April 6 when the data collection was terminated,
there were 10,284 accumulated conﬁrmed cases: 6598 full recoveries, 3500 conﬁrmed cases receiving
medical care, and 186 deaths. Before participating in the survey, participants were asked if they were
currently diagnosed with COVID-19 or had been previously diagnosed but completely cured, and those
participants who had been infected were excluded. Subjects were healthy individuals (aged > 20 years)
who had been participating in physical activities continuously, and the questionnaire was completed
on a voluntary basis. In this study, physical activity has been deﬁned as any bodily movement resulting
in energy expenditure [22]. Furthermore, subjects were informed before their participation that there
was no advantage or disadvantage in the survey participation and that they could stop participating
any time. It took about 10 min to complete the questionnaire, and no sensitive personal information
was collected.

2.2. Participants

A total of 300 questionnaires were distributed, and 231 were collected (~77% response rate),
of which 229 responses were used in the statistical analysis after excluding incomplete or insincere
responses. The participants of the 229 collected responses were grouped according to the two
independent variables of age and type of sport used in the present study. First, subjects were grouped
into young, middle-aged, and older adults by their age depending on guidelines [23] for the classiﬁcation
of age group cutoﬀs. At the same time, they were divided into two groups of individual and group
sports, depending on the type of sport they participated in. In addition, the participants answered

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4871

4 of 11

basic questions such on their gender and the frequency of recent sport participation. The results of
descriptive statistical analysis of the participants in each group are presented in Table 1.

2.3. Instruments

The scale of hypochondriasis, which was used as the dependent variable in the present study, was
based on the Illness Attitude Scale (IAS) developed by Kellner [24]. The factor structure of the scale
was conﬁrmed by Yi [25], based on the illness attitude of college students. The scale was revised and
supplemented in the study by Moon [17], who investigated hypochondriasis from a psychological
perspective and revised and supplemented the material again for the present study. Speciﬁcally,
previous studies used nine subscales, while the present study uses four subscales of (a) thanatophobia,
(b) worry about illness, (c) disease phobia, and (d) symptom preoccupation, which are appropriate to
analyze hypochondriasis in COVID-19.

For the other dependent variable in the present study, intention of continuous participation,
the measuring methods of Courneya and McAuley [26], Poﬀ [27], and Jeon, Lee, and Kim [28] were
consulted. Their methods were revised and supplemented for the purpose of the present study and
reconstructed with four items for a single factor. All scales discussed above were on a 5-point Likert
scale, ranging from 1 point for “strongly disagree” to 5 points for “strongly agree.”

3. Results

3.1. Scale Validity and Reliability

The scales used in the present study have already been tested in previous studies, and their
validity and reliability were satisfactory. Exploratory factor analysis was performed before the full-scale
analysis because the scales revised and supplemented for the present study were diﬀerent, in addition
to the research topic, purpose, and target population. Speciﬁcally, excluding intention of continuous
participation, which was used as a single-factor dependent variable, factors with eigenvalue 1.00 or

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4871

5 of 11

greater were selected using a Varimax rotation to determine the factor structure of hypochondriasis of
people in a situation where COVID-19 is widespread. A total of four factors were selected, and details
are presented in Table 2.

Additionally, reliability between the items was tested based on Cronbach’s Alpha coeﬃcients,
and a Cronbach’s alpha > 0.7 was considered satisfactory [29]: (a) worry about illness, α = 0.813; (b)
disease phobia, α = 0.784; (c) symptom preoccupation, α = 0.787; (d) thanatophobia, α = 0.817; and (e)
intention of continuous participation, α = 0.857. The results showed that all scales used in the present
study had satisfactory statistical reliability.

3.2. Factorial Multivariate Analysis of Variance: Diﬀerences of Age and Type of Sport on Hypochondriasis and
Intention of Continuous Participation

A 2 × 3 factorial multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed to investigate the
main and interaction eﬀects of the two independent variables, age (i.e., young, middle-aged, and older
adults) and type of sport (i.e., individual and group activities) on ﬁve dependent variables (i.e., four
factors of hypochondriasis and a factor of intention of continuous participation).

The Wilks’ Λ multivariate F statistic found the statistically signiﬁcant main eﬀect of age on the
dependent variables [Wilks’ Λ = 0.496, F(10, 438) = 18.386, p < 0.05]. Speciﬁcally, the univariate
tests for worry about illness, F(2, 223) = 25.522, p < 0.05, disease phobia, F(2, 223) = 12.868, p < 0.05,
thanatophobia, F(2, 223) = 8.016, p < 0.05, and intention of continuous participation, F(2, 223) = 54.736,
and p < 0.05 based on age (i.e., young, middle-aged, and older adults) were found to be statistically
signiﬁcant. Detailed statistic results of the main eﬀect and mean scores of each factor by groups have
been described in Table 3.

As discussed above, statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found among the three age groups.
To determine which groups were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, a post hoc analysis was performed. First,
among the four variables that showed statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences, which were (a) worry about
illness, (b) disease phobia, (c) thanatophobia, and (d) intention of continuous participation, higher
scores were obtained in relatively higher age groups of middle-aged (G2) and older adults (G3) than
young adult group for worry about illness and disease phobia variables. In the case of thanatophobia,
higher average values were obtained for the older adult group (G3) than the other two groups. Lastly,
the intention of continuous participation variable showed that the younger the age group, the higher
the intent of continuous participation. The statistical results of post-hoc analyses are presented in
Table 4, and mean values between groups of the dependent variables are shown in Table 3.

Yet another main eﬀect of the type of sport on ﬁve dependent variables was also statistically
signiﬁcant [Wilks’ Λ = 0.494, F(5, 219) = 44.924, p < 0.05]. Additionally, the univariate tests found
there were statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between Worry about Illness, F(1, 223) = 183.419, p < 0.05,
disease phobia, F(1, 223) = 8.399, p < 0.05, symptom preoccupation, F(1, 223) = 12.680, p < 0.05,
and intention of continuous participation, F(1, 223) = 26.822, p < 0.05, depending on the type of sport
(i.e., individual and group activities). Detailed statistic results of the main eﬀect and mean scores of
each factor by groups have been described in Table 5.

Lastly, the results showed statistically signiﬁcant two-way interaction eﬀect of age and type of
sport on ﬁve dependent variables [Wilks’ Λ = 0.832, F(10, 438) = 4.210, p < 0.05]. Speciﬁcally, the test
indicated that the interaction eﬀects of age and the type of sport were statistically signiﬁcant for disease
phobia, F(2, 223) = 5.314, p < 0.05, and thanatophobia, F(2, 223) = 13.200, p < 0.05. Detailed statistic
results of interaction eﬀects have been described in Table 6, and the mean scores of each variable by
groups have been reported in Table 7.

4. Discussion

Currently, COVID-19, which is known to transmit through the respiratory system, not only
threatens human lives, but also puts national systems around the world at risk due to its rapid spread
through personal contact. Although social distancing is encouraged, long-term self-isolation has been
diﬃcult in some cases [30]. People are gradually attempting outside activities for minimum daily
living, especially outdoor sport activities by which people can strengthen the immune system and
obtain psychological stability. People who are infected with the virus are treated in isolation, but most
healthy citizens experience higher levels of anxiety of being infected along with the interruption of
daily life [31]. Therefore, the present study attempts to analyze the psychological state and changes in
the pattern of sports participation in the coronavirus pandemic by analyzing the COVID-19 health
concerns of citizens who continue their everyday leisure activities and their intent to continue to
participate in leisure activities. In particular, considering the experience from the outbreak of MERS
and SARS in the past and the current COVID-19, the ﬁndings of the present study are judged to
be useful as a preparation for future uncertainties in a situation where the eradication of the virus
is uncertain.

Based on the current released statistics, COVID-19 infection has shown higher fatality rates in the
elderly. In fact, the mortality in the elderly is ≥30% according to the statistics of the Korea Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention announced on April 24, which diﬀers greatly than the death rate
of about 1% in people < 60 years [9]. Thus, the present study analyzed the data using age as one of
the important independent variables for classifying the respondents. The results of the present study
showed that the higher the age, the higher the score for three of the four factors of hypochondriasis.
Speciﬁcally, a higher level of worries and fear for health was found in the two older age groups
(i.e., middle-aged and older age groups) compared to the young age group for the two factors of
worry about illness and disease phobia. In addition, higher scores were found for the older age
group, which is the oldest age group, for thanatophobia than the other two groups. This ﬁnding is
consistent with the fatality rate announced by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Government’s real-time announcement of the infections and deaths by COVID-19 may cause fear of
death in the elderly.

This ﬁnding of the present study is consistent with the interpretation of hypochondriasis as
excessive anxiety related to diseases and conceptualization as a type of psychological anxiety disorders
in recent studies [14–16]. In particular, in the case of highly contagious COVID-19, psychological
anxiety may be higher because infected persons cannot be identiﬁed by the naked eye. The lower scores
of the young age group for all factors statistically support the explanation that age is statistically a very

Discussion Currently, COVID-19, which is known to transmit through the respiratory system, not only threatens human lives, but also puts national systems around the world at risk due to its rapid spread through personal contact. Although social distancing is encouraged, long-term self-isolation has been difficult in some cases [30].

Thus, the present study analyzed the data using age as one of the important independent variables for classifying the respondents. The results of the present study showed that the higher the age, the higher the score for three of the four factors of hypochondriasis. Specifically, a higher level of worries and fear for health was found in the two older age groups (i.e., middle-aged and older age groups) compared to the young age group for the two factors of worry about illness and disease phobia. In addition, higher scores were found for the older age group, which is the oldest age group, for thanatophobia than the other two groups. This finding is consistent with the fatality rate announced by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Government’s real-time announcement of the infections and deaths by COVID-19 may cause fear of death in the elderly. This finding of the present study is consistent with the interpretation of hypochondriasis as excessive anxiety related to diseases and conceptualization as a type of psychological anxiety disorders in recent studies [14–16]. In particular, in the case of highly contagious COVID-19, psychological anxiety may be higher because infected persons cannot be identified by the naked eye. The lower scores of the young age group for all factors statistically support the explanation that age is statistically a very important factor for the hypochondriasis in COVID-19. Furthermore, lower age groups answered that they will continue their current leisure activities even for the question of Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4871

important factor for the hypochondriasis in COVID-19. Furthermore, lower age groups answered that
they will continue their current leisure activities even for the question of continued participation in
leisure activities. The will itself to participate in leisure activities is absolutely the matter of personal
choice since leisure activities following the infection rules are not regulated. In addition, no signiﬁcant
statistical diﬀerence was found in symptom preoccupation, which is the last factor of hypochondriasis,
by age, and it may be attributable to the role of safe and rapid diagnostic tests performed by the South
Korean government. Since rapid diagnostic tests are available for those experiencing mild symptoms
at community health centers nearby, citizens’ vague concerns about their symptoms appear to be
reduced regardless of their age.

Next, the present study compared and analyzed hypochondriasis and intent to continue according
to the type of sports activity continued by the questionnaire respondents. As discussed above,
COVID-19 is known to spread through contact between people [9]. Accordingly, the type of sport
is important when desiring to participate in a sports activity. Basically, keeping a 1–2-m distance
from others is recommended [7], but such social distancing is practically impossible in the case of
group sports. Of course, gathering of a large number of spectators such is the case when watching
professional sports is discouraged, but the participation itself is possible because its restriction has
not been enforced for speciﬁc sports. Accordingly, Type of Sports Activity was used as an important
independent variable that classiﬁes questionnaire respondents.

Consequently, respondents who answered that they participated in group sports showed relatively
higher scores than respondents who participated in individual sports considering worry about illness,
disease phobia, and symptom preoccupation among the four factors of hypochondriasis. This appears
to indicate that the psychological anxiety of people who participate in group sports is voluntary.
The score of group sport participants in intent to continue was on the contrary low considering the
results of hypochondriasis. These responses indicate that the individuals currently participate in
group sports but are anxious about their health and that they intend to discontinue group sports
activities in the future. It is understood that these individuals are slightly anxious when it comes to the
possibility of infection due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, and their will not to participate in group
sports anymore is shown. Participating in social movements is considered to be a positive response to
overcoming the virus.

Lastly, a meaningful phenomenon was found in the results of the interaction eﬀect of factorial
MANOVA performed in the present study. We analyzed the inﬂuence of the interaction between the two
independent variables (i.e., age and type of sport) on the ﬁve dependent variables (four hypochondriasis
subscales and one intent to continue). The results showed that there were interaction eﬀects between age
and type of sport on two dependent variables (i.e., disease phobia and thanatophobia). The interaction
showed that the higher the age, the score of disease phobia and thanatophobia increased, but in the
case of respondents who were in the highest age group and participated in group sports, it showed
relatively low scores. It means that the high fatality rate in the elderly generally tended to increase the
anxiety of the older age group, but the tendency was not found only in the elderly who participated in
group sports. In the case of golf, which was one of the group sports examined in the present study,
psychological awareness appeared to be lowered because a contact was made with a limited number
of people, and it is played outdoors. It appears to be, however, far from the social movements that
basically minimize contact with others and violate the rules. Therefore, it should be kept in mind that
the awareness must be maintained until the end of pandemic.

5. Conclusions and Limitations

There is now increased public knowledge that sports participation entails not only physical
beneﬁts but also mental and social beneﬁts, people’s interest in health has steadily increased. External
factors that limit people’s participation in sports or change their participation patterns, however,
have always existed. Among them, environmental factors have recently caused large changes in
people’s participation in sports. COVID-19, which was rampant at the end of 2019 and rapidly spread

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4871

through contacts with people and via the respiratory system, changed not only people’s daily lives
but also sports participation patterns. The present study analyzed the hypochondriasis and sports
participation types of people due to COVID-19 pandemic. Statistically signiﬁcant results were derived
by applying age and interpersonal contacts, which are important risk factors for COVID-19 infection,
shown by medical statistics indicators. Changes in daily life by these viruses are expected to continue
in the future as well, and it is hoped that the ﬁndings of the present study will be used as important
reference data.

However, this study used convenience sampling to draw the samples, which can lead to certain
restrictions in obtaining representativeness in research. Accordingly, it is necessary to take account
of various sampling methods that use probabilistic sampling in further research. Moreover, with
sport participants rapidly decreasing in number due to the spread of COVID-19, there were many
diﬃculties in securing research participants for this study. Follow-up research must remedy these
shortcomings. Finally, as this was not a clinical study but a social science study analyzing the
psychological characteristics of people, we investigated whether the participants had “ever been
infected with COVID-19” or “had suspicious symptoms” using a survey. Further research must
produce more scientiﬁcally sound results through the convergence with clinical science.
