Fear and decision-making in narcissistic 
personality disorder—a link between 
psychoanalysis and neuroscience
Elsa Ronningstam, PhD; Arielle R. Baskin-Sommers, MS

Introduction

N

arcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has its
roots  in  nearly  a  century  of  psychoanalytic  studies.
Kernberg’s1,2 and  Kohut’s3,4 groundbreaking  efforts  to
organize psychoanalytic theory and clinical studies into
comprehensive  descriptions  and  treatment  strategies
moved NPD towards recognition as a separate personal-
ity disorder. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV,5,6 NPD has been character-
ized as a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admi-
ration, and lack of empathy, with interpersonal entitle-
ment, exploitativeness, arrogance, and envy. Other notable
phenotypic characteristics include interpersonal distanc-
ing and avoidance, insecurity and vulnerability, hypersen-
sitivity, aggressivity, and proneness to shame.7-9
The transformation of NPD into a DSM diagnostic cate-
gory in 198010 required significant adjustments and nar-
rowing of extensive clinical observations. Several compo-
nents  and  characteristics  of  narcissistic  personality
pathology that were central in the psychoanalytic concep-
tualization of narcissism and NPD were left aside in the
final choice and formulation of the diagnostic trait criteria.
One such characteristic relates to the process and feeling
of fear, frequently acknowledged in psychoanalytic stud-
ies as a significant part of narcissistic pathology. Freud11

Linking  psychoanalytic  studies  with  neuroscience  has
proven increasingly productive for identifying and under-
standing personality functioning. This article focuses on
pathological narcissism and narcissistic personality disor-
der (NPD), with the aim of exploring two clinically rele-
vant aspects of narcissistic functioning also recognized in
psychoanalysis: fear and decision-making. Evidence from
neuroscientific studies of related conditions, such as psy-
chopathy, suggests links between affective and cognitive
functioning that can influence the sense of self-agency
and narcissistic self-regulation. Attention can play a cru-
cial role in moderating fear and self-regulatory deficits,
and the interaction between experience and emotion can
be  central  for  decision-making.  In  this  review  we  will
explore fear as a motivating factor in narcissistic person-
ality functioning, and the impact fear may have on deci-
sion-making in people with pathological narcissism and
NPD.  Understanding  the  processes  and  neurological
underpinnings of fear and decision-making can potentially
influence both the diagnosis and treatment of NPD.

noted narcissistic mortification as intense fear associated
with narcissistic injury and humiliation. He also observed
the shocking reaction when individuals face the discrep-
ancy between an endorsed or ideal view of the self and a
drastically contrasting realization.12 Rothstein13 associated
such fear of falling short of ideals with the loss of perfec-
tion and accompanying humiliation, an important aspect
of narcissistic personality functioning. Fiscalini14 empha-
sized fear of autonomy in narcissistic interpersonal rela-
tions, and Kohut4,15 pointed to fear associated with rejec-
tion, isolation, and loss of contact with reality, and loss of
admiration, equilibrium, and important objects. Recently,
Horowitz16 highlighted fear in the context of wishes and
defenses, and Kernberg17-19 has referred to the unfolding of
underlying fear in treatment of people with NPD, includ-
ing fear of dependency and destroying the relationship
with the analyst, fear of retaliation, of one’s own aggres-
sion and destructiveness, and fear of death. Maldonado20
identified the narcissistic intrapsychic trauma caused by
the loss of a bond with a good object associated with ideals
and meaning. Such a trauma threatens the individual’s
sense of continuity, coherence, stability, and wellbeing. In
the delicate balance between repairing such traumas and
working through conflicts, reactivations of fear inevitably
occur, especially in the context of aggression and shame.
An additional limitation in DSM is the absence of diag-
nostically  specified  levels  of  personality  functioning.
Narcissism ranges from healthy and proactive to patho-
logical and malignant. Consequently, pathological narcis-
sism and NPD often co-occur with consistent or intermit-
tent areas and periods of high functioning,21 including areas
or periods of real competence and qualities, as well as cog-
nitive, emotional, and interpersonal capabilities, and social
skills. In clinical and social psychological reports, identifi-
cation of narcissistic character pathology takes into con-
sideration the functional aspects of shifts between self-
enhancement and self-deflation, with intermittent periods
and areas of competent functioning. Dimensions of char-
acter functioning that enable such evaluation include self-
agency22-25 and self-directedness.26 These dimensions, which
capture the individual’s intentions, choices and strivings,
purpose and goals, causal influence, and prediction and
problem-solving skills, are especially useful for defining
narcissistic self- and self-esteem regulation. Decision-mak-
ing, a central component in self-regulatory and self-direct-
ing efforts, has gained attention in psychoanalytic studies,
and recently also in social psychological studies of narcis-
sism.

In order to advance our understanding of the different
components operating in pathological narcissism and
NPD it is necessary to further connect and integrate the
psychoanalytic and clinical, as well as the social psycho-
logical, conceptualization of the disorder. One unifying
approach may be to examine the neural underpinnings
in narcissism as a way to refine its phenotype. Research
on  empathy  and  empathic  functioning  has  already
proven such a link to be most constructive and informa-
tive for NPD,27-29 contributing to a significant change in
identifying empathy, not as absent or present, but as a
multifactorial and fluctuating capability.30 This research
has also influenced the discussion of the DSM-5 per-
sonality disorder section, suggesting that empathy is an
ability with inconsistencies and impairments, multiple
components, a functional range, and a regulatory role. 
The aim of this paper is to further identify possible links
between the psychoanalytic perspective on pathological
narcissism and NPD, and neuroscientific research on
narcissism and related pathologies. In this review, we will
focus primarily on fear, as it has been considered a cen-
tral and even a motivating factor in narcissistic person-
ality functioning in psychoanalytic and clinical studies.
Further, we will explore the impact that fear may have
on decision-making. Understanding the processes and
neurological underpinnings of fear and decision-making
can potentially influence both the diagnosis and treat-
ment of NPD. 

Fear

Fear is generally considered to be an emotional state, a
psychological and psychophysiological response to per-
ceived or anticipated threats or danger. Fear can often
serve as an adaptive alert and survival mechanism. As
such, it represents an ability to recognize danger and an
urge to either confront or to avoid or escape, but fear
can also in extreme situations cause paralysis and inabil-
ity to protect oneself. Fear differs from anxiety as it is a
response to real threats, a frightening object, event, or
experience, while anxiety is considered an anticipatory
warning signal, related to the expectation of unreal or
imagined danger, including intrapsychic, unconscious
conflicts and erotic feelings.31-34 From a psychoanalytic
perspective, fear can be triggered by concrete external
events as well as by internal subjective or emotional
experiences. Fear of not measuring up and falling short
can be triggered in specific situations, ie, in the context

of evaluation, performance, or exposure. Such fear dif-
fers from the more complex or ambiguous fear that in
the same way can threaten self-esteem, ie, fear of being
overwhelmed, and facing success or relationships and
intimacy, feelings of shame or guilt, and experiencing loss
of control.23,32,35,36 The subjective meaning ascribed to the
experience of external life events, such as changes, gains
and losses, challenges, or discouragements, can evoke
sudden unexpected fear. Intense overwhelming affect,
independently of whether the cause is external or inter-
nal, can also in itself be terrifying as it may challenge the
individual’s sense of internal control. 
Fear can also become maladaptive or pathological, as
such feelings, generated from an initial fear-provoking
event, persist and have a negative effect on day-to-day
behavior.37 Fear of dark and negative self-experiences or
of intolerable aspects of identity, in particular, can drive
protective self-aggrandizement as well as destructive sui-
cidal behavior enforced by overwhelming feelings of
despair.23,38 Certain events can also activate fears associ-
ated with earlier narcissistic trauma. Experiences in the
present are linked to disorganized and fragmented mem-
ories  of  earlier  mortifying  or  traumatic  experiences.
Sensory and emotional experiences associated with such
early trauma39 also contribute to the subjective percep-
tion and interpretation of a present event as traumatic,
ie, retraumatizing.
A  number  of  social  psychological  and  personality-
focused studies related to narcissistic functioning further
indicate that fear and fear avoidance, especially of fail-
ure, are important motivating factors, a “self-regulatory
strategy driven by specific achievement motives, namely,
fear of failure” (p 11).40 Those strategies involve achieve-
ment, competitiveness, improvement of performance,
and  perfectionism.40-42 Similarly,  fear  of  failure  and
accompanying shame can motivate procrastination or
avoidance of commitment and performance.43,44 On the
other  hand,  fear  management  can  also  involve  self-
enhancing  risk-taking  and  impulsivity.24,45 Defensive
behavior in response to exposure to failure and accom-
panying  fear  of  failure  is  considered  to  be  deeply
ingrained, with automatic efforts to avoid failure. In gen-
eral, these studies indicate that people who are afraid of
failing can be motivated or even susceptible to either
invest greater efforts in a task after being exposed to
failure information, or to completely avoid such efforts. 
Fear related to self-esteem regulation and risk of falling
short can underlie and motivate a range of behavior in

narcissistic personality disorder. High achievements can
be motivated by fear of incompetence and failure; self-
enhancement by fear of worthlessness and inferiority;
perfectionism by fear of shame and self-criticism; pur-
suit of special affiliations by fear of losing status or influ-
ence; interpersonal ignorance and distancing by fear of
humiliation, or being overpowered and lose control; and
avoidance by fear of shame and exposure. These studies
and observations raise several questions about the inter-
action between identifying, processing, and controlling
fear from the perspective of narcissistic self-regulation.
So far, studies have shown that people with high narcis-
sism  but  not  meeting  criteria  for  NPD  present  with
higher degree of alexithymia, ie, difficulties assessing
own and other’s emotions.46 However, it is possible that
by exploring neuroscientific evidence in narcissism and
related pathologies, researchers and clinicians may begin
to clarify and differentiate specific fear susceptibility and
fear processing in people with NPD.

Fear, narcissism, and neuroscience 

Over the last several decades there has been significant
growth in the understanding of the neurobiological basis
of fear. At the center of the fear circuitry is the amyg-
dala.  The  amygdala  mediates  processes  such  as  the
detection of emotionally arousing and/or salient stim-
uli.47 Additional regions (eg, nucleus accumbens, hip-
pocampus, some prefrontal regions, etc) form a neural
network involved in the perception of threat, fear learn-
ing, and fear expression.48 These areas individually medi-
ate symptoms of fear and collectively act to produce an
integrated fear response. Our nuanced understanding of
this complex neural network results from imaging (eg,
during fear conditioning studies), physiological (eg, skin
conductance, eye-blink response), and psychopharma-
cological studies that not only enhance the mechanistic
understanding of fear but also highlight the role of fear-
related dysfunction in the generation and maintenance
of various forms of psychopathology. 
Failure to properly regulate fear responses is central to
specific phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, general-
ized anxiety, and some Axis II disorders (ie, fear of sep-
aration and loss of support in dependent personality dis-
order (DPD) of abandonment in borderline personality
disorder (BPD), and of criticism, disapproval, and rejec-
tion  in  avoidant  personality  disorder  (APD).6 While
some disorders are largely associated with hypervigi-

C l i n i c a l   r e s e a r c h

lance and an over-reactive fear response (eg, anxiety dis-
orders and BPD), others are related to deficient fear
reactivity (eg, psychopathy). Studies on the relationship
between fear and narcissism have been sparse, both at a
phenotypic and mechanism level. One study of individ-
uals  with  narcissistic  traits,  as  measured  by  the
Narcissism Personality Inventory (NPI)49 reported that
they display diminished electrodermal reactivity to aver-
sive stimuli,50 indicating weak responses to punishment
or aversive cues. 
Despite the limited research directly examining fear and
narcissism, there are studies of other related conditions
with relevance to pathological narcissism that highlight
the  importance  of  fear  in  the  expression  of  psy-
chopathology. Specifically, the role of fear in psychopa-
thy-related disinhibition has been the focus of studies for
decades. NPD and psychopathy are considered to be
overlapping constructs, both expressing symptoms of
grandiosity, compromised empathic functioning, and cal-
lousness. In fact, Kernberg2 suggested that narcissism
might be the core of psychopathy.51-53 Psychopathic indi-
viduals generally display an inability to form genuine
relationships; limited (ie, grandiose) affective processing,
especially  with  respect  to  anticipatory  anxiety  and
remorse; an impulsive behavioral style involving a gen-
eral failure to evaluate anticipated actions and inhibit
the inappropriate ones; and a chronic antisocial lifestyle
that  entails  great  costs  to  society  as  well  as  for  the
affected individual.54 While both affective and behavioral
characteristics are important elements of psychopathy,
the affective deficits have traditionally been considered
to be the root cause of the psychopath’s problems. 
Affective deficits in psychopathy have most often been
understood  in  the  context  of  the  low-fear  model.55
Consistent with this model, psychopaths display poor
fear conditioning,55 minimal electrodermal response in
anticipation of aversive events,56 and a lack of startle
potentiation while viewing unpleasant versus neutral
pictures.57 However,  other  studies  examining  startle
potentiation (eg, fear-potentiated startle and emotion-
modulated startle) demonstrate that the psychopathy-
related fear deficit is not absolute, but rather conditional
depending on contextual variables.58-60 Neuroimaging evi-
dence suggests that psychopaths display reduced amyg-
dala activation than controls during aversive condition-
ing,  moral  decision-making,  social  cooperation,  and
reduced  memory  for  emotionally  salient  words.61-64
However, results from imaging studies focused on the

amygdala are ambiguous. Other research indicates that
the amygdala is hyper-reactive when psychopaths view
certain  emotionally  salient  scenes.65 Thus,  existing
research does not indicate the presence of a reliable fear
deficit in psychopathic individuals, though such deficits
may be revealed under specific circumstances.
One  explanation  for  the  inconsistent  nature  of  psy-
chopathy-related fear deficits may involve an abnormal-
ity  in  attentional  processes.  Developments  in  neuro-
science indicate that the function of the amygdala is more
complex than just fear processing, and likely plays a sig-
nificant role in attention and in detecting relevance.66
With regard to psychopathy, according to the response
modulation hypothesis, attention plays a crucial role in
moderating fear and self-regulatory deficits. Response
modulation  involves  the “temporary  suspension  of  a
dominant response set and a brief concurrent shift of
attention from the organization and implementation of
goal-directed responding to its evaluation” (p 717).67 In
the absence of normal response modulation, an individ-
ual  is  prone  to  ignore  crucial  contextual  information
needed  to  evaluate  his  or  her  behavior  and  exercise
adaptive self-regulation.68,69 Consequently, psychopaths
are oblivious to potentially meaningful peripheral infor-
mation because they fail to reallocate attention while
engaged in goal-directed behavior. This difficulty bal-
ancing demands to process goal-directed and peripheral
information  creates  a  bias  whereby  psychopaths  are
unresponsive to information unless it is a central aspect
of their goal-directed focus of attention. 
An important implication of the response modulation
hypothesis is that the emotion deficit of psychopathic
individuals varies as a function of attentional focus. A
recent  experiment  by  Newman  et  al60 involving  fear-
potentiated startle (FPS) provides striking support for
this hypothesis. Of note, existing evidence suggests that
FPS is generated via the amygdala.70 The task used in this
study required participants to view and categorize letter
stimuli that could also be used to predict the administra-
tion of electric shocks. Instructions engaged either a goal-
directed focus on threat-relevant information (ie, the
color that predicted electric shocks) or an alternative,
threat-irrelevant  dimension  of  the  letter  stimuli  (ie,
upper/lower case of the letter or its match/mismatch in a
2-back task). The results provided no evidence of a psy-
chopathy-related deficit in FPS under conditions that
focused  attention  on  the  threat-relevant  dimension.
However,  psychopathy  scores  were  significantly  and

inversely related to FPS under conditions that required
participants to focus on a threat-irrelevant dimension of
stimuli (ie, when threat cues were peripheral). 
In a follow-up study, Baskin-Sommers and colleagues59
specified this attentional-mediated abnormality in a new
sample of offenders by measuring FPS in four conditions
that crossed attentional focus (threat versus alternative
focus) with early versus late presentation of goal-relevant
cues.  First,  the  authors  replicated  the  key  findings
reported by Newman et al60: that psychopaths’ deficit in
FPS  was  virtually  nonexistent  under  conditions  that
focused attention on the threat-relevant dimension of the
experimental stimuli (ie, threat-focus conditions), but was
pronounced when threat-relevant cues were peripheral to
their primary focus of attention (ie, alternative-focus con-
ditions). More specifically, the psychopathic deficit in FPS
was only apparent in the early alternative focus condition,
in which threat cues were presented after the alternative
goal-directed focus was already established. 
These results confirm the idea that attention moderates
the fearlessness of psychopathic individuals and, more-
over, implicate an early attention bottleneck as a proxi-
mal mechanism for deficient response modulation in psy-
chopathy (see ref 71 for discussion of the bottleneck).
Additionally, Larson and colleagues (unpublished data)
recently completed an imaging study using this paradigm
with an independent sample of inmates. Results indicated
that  decreased  amygdala  activation  in  psychopathic
offenders occurred only during the early alternative focus
condition. Under this condition, psychopaths also exhib-
ited greater activation in selective attention regions of
the  lateral  prefrontal  cortex  (LPFC)  than  nonpsy-
chopaths, and this increased LPFC activation was asso-
ciated with decreased amygdala activation. In contrast,
when explicitly attending to threat, amygdala activation
in psychopaths did not differ from nonpsychopaths. This
pattern of amygdala activation closely parallels results
for FPS and, moreover, highlights the potential role of
LPFC in mediating the failure of psychopathic individu-
als to process emotion and other important information
when it is peripheral to the primary focus of goal-directed
attention. Overall, it appears that psychopathic individu-
als do ignore fear-related information, but only in the ser-
vice of focusing on a specific goal. For example, such an
inflexible focus on personal goals may underlie the self-
centered, callous traits associated with psychopathy and
may  leave  psychopathic  individuals  oblivious  to  the
potentially devastating consequences of their behavior.

While one relationship between fear and psychopathol-
ogy is related to deficient fear processing, another rela-
tionship between fear and psychopathology is related to
over-reactivity to fear. Specifically, research on other
forms of externalizing psychopathology, like borderline
personality  disorder,  report  increased  FPS  during
instructed fear conditioning72 and increased amygdala
activity while viewing emotional slides.73 Similarly, stud-
ies  of  trait  externalizing  demonstrated  significant
increases in FPS, amygdala, and emotion-related pre-
frontal cortex activity during fear conditioning.74 Thus,
these individuals appear unable to regulate their reac-
tion to fear, essentially becoming consumed by its pres-
ence, ultimately resulting in a cascade of emotion-driven
disinhibited behavior. 
Although this neuroscientific overview applies to near
neighbor psychopathologies, several findings introduce
possible links to fear processing in pathological narcis-
sism  and  NPD.  Similar  to  people  with  psychopathy,
focused attention on goals, such as ambitions, competi-
tion, and aspirations, and even on risk-taking efforts,
may, for some people with pathological narcissism and
NPD, enable ignorance of fear and serve as a fear mod-
ulator. The narcissistic individual’s awareness is then
directed away from potential triggers of feelings of fear
and towards more securing or rewarding self-enhancing
experiences. On the other hand, given the psychoanalytic
observations of profound fear in NPD, and the recogni-
tion of the thin-skinned75 and vulnerable narcissistic per-
sonality types,9 the question is whether some people with
pathological narcissism and NPD indeed are hypersen-
sitive or over-reactive to fear, or can have impaired capa-
bility to tolerate and/or process feelings of fear. It is also
possible that when people with pathological narcissism
or NPD have to face fear without the possibilities of
engaging in avoiding, goal-directed, or self-enhancing
strategies, the experience becomes overwhelming and
consuming,  forcing  drastic  decisions  with  seemingly
immediate short-term gains. Further research is needed
to parse these possibilities. One avenue for understand-
ing the role of fear in narcissism is to examine its impact
on functionality, in processes such as decision-making. 

Decision-making

Psychoanalytic  studies  have  primarily  attended  to  the
intrapsychic aspects of decision making. Identified as a sec-
ondary ego process linked between motivation and action,

1 9 5

14_CH_8001_BA_INTERIEUR.qxd:DCNS#55  3/06/13  18:03  Page 196

C l i n i c a l   r e s e a r c h

the unconscious courses involved in decision-making have
nevertheless been a prime focus of interest.76,77 Used to
institute defenses and reach resolutions or compromises,
decision-making is also influenced by physiological factors,
and part of symptom formation and psychopathology. Fear
can influence decision-making by engulfing either an indi-
vidual’s sense of agency or sense of identity, or both. The
former can affect competence, while the latter can cause
self-confusion and uncertainty about who one really is.
Although not currently acknowledged as a diagnostic or
clinical indicator of NPD, nevertheless, remarkable lapses
in some narcissistic individuals’ decisions can force them
into  unbearable  situations  and  life  crises  that  call  for
urgent need of intensive treatment. Sometimes such lapses
can have devastating consequences, including suicide.78 In
clinical settings, therapists can face a paradoxical discrep-
ancy between such patients' consistent self-control and
proactive competence, and their sudden disparate decision
strategies that seem ruled by immediate short-term gain
and misjudgment, or by ignorance of salient negative or
even destructive consequences, especially in interpersonal
or professional/financial areas. Usually referred to either
as narcissistic crises or trauma motivated by urgent, defen-
sive push for protection and enhancement of self-esteem,
or by avoidance of perceived inevitable ultimatums, many
of the roots and underpinnings for such decision-making
are still relatively unknown.
As with fear, there is an important normal aspect of deci-
sion-making, especially its role in self-esteem regulation
and sense of control, that contributes to an organizing
perception of being in charge of cause-effect, input-out-
come, and action-result. In particular, efforts to optimize
reward,  self-enhancement,  and  self-promotion  have
proved important. Decision-making as part of an agency
model for narcissistic personality functioning has been
studied in social psychology in the context of approach—
avoidance motivation, specifically in relationships and in
financial and business decisions.24,79-81 Narcissistic factors
accompanying and guiding decision-making can include
arrogance, overconfidence and overestimation, visibility,
or impulsivity and risk taking. Contrary to lapses in deci-
sion making, some people with pathological narcissism
or NPD can present with more consistent patterns of self-
promoting decision making, involving risk-taking, and
disregard or ignorance of both their own and others’ feel-
ings and wellbeing. On the other hand, it is also possible
that dysregulated feelings of fear can impact the decision-
making patterns of these individuals. 

Decision-making, narcissism, and neuroscience

In recent years, there has been a surge of research on
decision  making  from  a  neuroscience  perspective.
Though there are a number of decision-making models,
in this review we focus on a particular neurobiological
theory of decision making that highlights the interaction
between experience and emotion: the somatic marker
hypothesis. Antonio Damasio’s82 somatic marker hypoth-
esis posits that physiological processes, such as emotion,
act as signals to influence behavior. More specifically, for
each experience an association between that situation
and the corresponding somatic states (ie, emotions) is
made. The recurrence of a particular situation triggers
the reactivation of emotion-influenced neural patterns,
which biases decision-making toward choices that maxi-
mize reward and minimize punishment.
Damasio and others propose that the orbitofrontal cor-
tex,  specifically  the  ventromedial  prefrontal  cortex
(vmPFC), is central to decision-making. Patients with
lesions to the vmPFC display deficits in learning from
previous experiences, poor decision-making, flat affect,
and impairments in their ability to react to emotional sit-
uations.83 This  pattern  of  impairment  led  Damasio  to
hypothesize that the primary dysfunction of patients with
vmPFC damage was an inability to use emotions to aid
in decision-making (eg, in personal, monetary, and moral
domains). To test this hypothesis in an experimental con-
text, Bechara developed the Iowa Gambling Task. This
task consists of four decks of cards, each associated with
varying levels of reward and punishment (two decks are
low reward/low punishment [advantageous]; two decks
are high reward/high punishment [disadvantageous]). In
general, participants sample both the advantageous and
disadvantageous decks equally, but after experiencing a
number of high punishments, they shift predominantly to
advantageous decks. In contrast, subjects with vmPFC
damage tend to continue choosing from the disadvanta-
geous decks. Moreover, vmPFC lesion patients did not
display anticipatory emotional responses (eg, skin con-
ductance), indicating a deficit in anticipating the emo-
tional impact of future rewards and punishments (see ref
84 for review). Finally, individuals with lesions to the
amygdala also display impairments, similar to vmPFC
patients,  in  performance  on  the  Iowa  gambling  task.
However, unlike the vmPFC patients, those with amyg-
dala lesions display impairments in registering the emo-
tional impact of rewards and punishments, rather than

the anticipation of this feedback. Ultimately, emotional
states are elicited during decision-making and are repre-
sented in the brain through both cortical (eg, insular cor-
tex; vmPFC) and subcortical pathways (eg, mesolimbic
dopamine system; amygdala). Taken together, this model
provides a basis for understanding how basic motiva-
tional and emotional processes are related to complex
decision-making processes in a variety of contexts.
Increasingly, the principles gleaned from observing deci-
sion-making deficits in patients with lesions are being
applied to understanding a diverse range of pathologies
in  which  deficits  in  decision-making  are  evident  and
where emotions can play a critical role. Individuals with
NPD are characterized by a sense of entitlement (ie, self-
serving bias), taking advantage of others for personal
gain,  and  hypersensitivity  to  criticism/punishment.
However, it is possible that decision-making in such con-
text is a consequence of weak somatic markers due to
the underlying defect in emotional reactivity (see above
section on fear).
In a study by Krusemark et al85 undergraduates who
scored high on a questionnaire measure of narcissism
displayed reduced brain activity for self-serving attribu-
tions following success (positive) feedback. More specif-
ically, these individuals had decreased activity in bilat-
eral  occipital  cortex,  bilateral  temporal  cortex,  left
posterior parietal cortex, right dorsomedial prefrontal
cortex, and bilateral vmPFC (see also ref 46 for similar
neural patterns related to narcissism). As noted above,
deficits in vmPFC are associated with poor decision-
making, possibly because of the inability to integrate
affective information from external stimuli. Based on the
evidence that individuals with high narcissism displayed
reduced physiological responses to arousing cues,50 the
results reported by Krusemark and colleagues may sug-
gest that they make more self-serving attributions fol-
lowing success because of weak stimulus registration,
integration, and affective reactivity. 
The association between impaired decision-making and
vmPFC activity has also been made with psychopathy. A
number of laboratory paradigms demonstrate vmPFC-
related deficits in psychopathy, such as deficits in rever-
sal  learning,86,87 and  in  gambling  tasks.88,89 Moreover,
Koenigs and colleagues90 reported that a subgroup of
psychopathic offenders (ie, primary low-anxious psy-
chopaths) performed similarly to vmPFC lesion patients
in the Ultimatum and Dictator economic decision-mak-
ing games. Specifically, both primary psychopaths and

vmPFC lesion patients accepted fewer unfair offers in
the Ultimatum game and offered lower amounts to oth-
ers in the Dictator game. These results support the pur-
ported connection between psychopathy and vmPFC
dysfunction. Moreover, they suggest that, as in narcissis-
tic  individuals,  a  deficit  in  integrating  emotion  with
action may diminish the processes of self-insight and
self-reflection in psychopathic individuals. 
Further highlighting the potential utility of the somatic
marker hypothesis for understanding the decision-mak-
ing patterns of those with narcissism, individuals with
high narcissism display poor performance on the Iowa
Gambling Task in a manner similar to those with vmPFC
lesions81 and with psychopathy.91-93 Specifically, individu-
als with high narcissism chose significantly more from the
disadvantageous decks, which provided larger immediate
reward but resulted in long-term net loss. Lakey and col-
leagues81 suggested that narcissistic individuals are overly
focused on reward, which biased the appraisals of reward
and punishment, thus impeding adaptive decision-mak-
ing. However, these results may also reflect impairment
in the processing of negative affect (eg, fear), which often
guide  a  shift  in  decision-making  that  would  avoid
repeated punishment. Though the distinction between
these perspectives may seem subtle they suggest differ-
ential sources of affective decision-making impairment:
one related to hypersensitivity to reward and the other
related to insensitivity to negative affects. Overall, spe-
cific deficits in affect processing may contribute to this
decision-making impairment in people with pathological
narcissism and NPD, and future research will need to
parse and specify their decision-making and affective
capability. Regarding the brain mechanisms of patholog-
ical narcissism, there are multiple neural structures that
overlap  with  decision-making  processes,  notably  the
amygdala and vmPFC. Both brain regions have been
linked to narcissism, albeit currently through limited evi-
dence. Although at this time, it is impossible to make
definitive statements about the neural root of patholog-
ical narcissism, the development of theoretical models
that integrate emotion and decision-making would serve
to more precisely understand the self-centered, self-serv-
ing, and self-enhancing actions of narcissistic individuals.

Conclusion

The possible interactional patterns, both self-regulatory
and neural, between fear and decision-making as out-

lined above, implicate the advantage of integrating clin-
ical  studies  and  neuroscience  to  improve  our  under-
standing of pathological narcissism and the diagnosis of
NPD. The psychoanalytic perspective of fear and deci-
sion-making provide more in-depth conceptualizations
of narcissism to which neuroscience can add important
information and perspectives to further identify the inter-
vening processes in narcissistic personality functioning.
This has the potential of significantly improving the diag-
nosis  of  NPD  and  consequently  also  the  treatment
approach and strategies for patients with narcissistic per-
sonality functioning. Accordingly, narcissistically based
decision-making may be influenced by affect dysregula-
tion, such as hypersensitivity to fear. In addition, fear in
some individuals may be accompanied by other intense
feelings (ie, secondary feelings) such as shame, rage, self-
hatred,  etc,  or  by  early  self-esteem  related  traumatic
experiences,  making  feelings  of  fear  intolerable  and
therefore especially challenging to appropriately inte-
grate  in  the  decision  process.  Treatment  focusing  on
increasing self-reflection, insight, and ability for emotion
awareness and regulation would in such case potentially
help to redirect or alter the narcissistic patient’s decision-

making. Alternatively, patients with NPD may also be
overly goal-focused in the service of self-enhancement,
and hence, like people with psychopathy, be unable to
redirect their attention. Treatment efforts focusing on
understanding and integrating vulnerability and feelings
of fear in self-functioning and self-directedness would be
most meaningful for these patients. Importantly, these
two  treatment  alternatives  assume  that  narcissistic
patients possess the ability to both recognize and process
feelings of fear, even though they may for various reasons
be insensitive, ignorant, hypersensitive or over-reactive
to fear. However, it is also possible that neurocognitive
limitations in recognizing and integrating feelings of fear
greatly limit decision-making capabilities. In such case
treatment focusing on learning alternative strategies may
be more useful, but also require the patient’s motivation
and  realization  of  the  necessity  for  change.  Further
research is called for to fully identify such limitations. In
sum, strategies to address the role of fear and pattern of
decision-making may potentially diminish the common
risks for ruptures and premature termination, and ulti-
mately  promote  collaborative  alliance  building  with
patients with pathological narcissism and NPD. ❏

Narcissism, fear, and decision-making - Ronningstam and Baskin-Sommers

El temor y la toma de decisiones en el 
trastorno narcisista de la personalidad: una
relación entre psicoanálisis y neurociencias

Peur et prise de décision dans le trouble de
personnalité narcissique : un lien entre 
psychanalyse et neuroscience

Cada vez ha resultado más productiva la relación
entre los estudios psicoanalíticos y las neurociencias
respecto a la identificación y comprensión del fun-
cionamiento de la personalidad. Este artículo se
centra en el narcisismo patológico y en el trastorno
narcisista de la personalidad (TNP), con el objetivo
de explorar dos aspectos clínicamente relevantes
del funcionamiento narcisista que también se reco-
nocen en el psicoanálisis como son el temor y la
toma de decisiones. La evidencia que ha surgido de
los estudios neurocientíficos de condiciones rela-
cionadas, como la psicopatía, sugiere vinculaciones
entre el funcionamiento afectivo y cognitivo, las
que pueden influir en el sentido de auto-agencia
y la auto-regulación narcisista. La atención puede
jugar un papel esencial en la moderación del temor
y de los déficit auto-reguladores, y la interacción
entre experiencia y emoción puede ser central para
la toma de decisiones. En esta revisión se explora el
temor como un factor motivador en el funciona-
miento de la personalidad narcisista y el impacto
que puede tener el temor en la toma de decisiones
en personas con un narcisismo patológico y en el
TNP. La comprensión de los procesos y bases neuro-
lógicas del temor y la toma de decisiones puede
influir  potencialmente  tanto  en  el  diagnóstico
como en el tratamiento del TNP. 

Associer les études psychanalytiques et les neuros-
ciences  se  révèle  de  plus  en  plus  productif  pour
identifier et comprendre le fonctionnement de la
personnalité. Cet article s’intéresse au narcissisme
pathologique et au trouble de la personnalité nar-
cissique (TPN) afin d’explorer deux aspects clini-
quement pertinents du fonctionnement narcissique
reconnus aussi en psychanalyse : la peur et la prise
de décision. Des études neuroscientifiques sur des
troubles  associés,  comme  les  psychopathies,  ont
montré qu’il existait des liens entre le fonctionne-
ment affectif et cognitif pouvant influer sur le sens
de l’acte intentionnel et de l’autorégulation narcis-
sique. L’attention jouerait un rôle crucial dans la
modération de la peur et des déficits d’autorégu-
lation, l’interaction entre expérience et émotion
pouvant  être  centrale  pour  la  prise  de  décision.
Nous analysons ici la peur comme facteur stimulant
de la personnalité narcissique et son impact sur la
prise de décision chez les sujets souffrant de narcis-
sisme pathologique et de TPN. La compréhension
des  processus  et  des  bases    neurologiques  de  la
peur et de la prise de décision pourrait influer à la
fois sur le diagnostic et le traitement du TPN.
