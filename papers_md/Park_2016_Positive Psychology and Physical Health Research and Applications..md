Positive Psychology and 
Physical Health: Research and 
Applications

Abstract: Positive psychology is 
the scientific study of a healthy and 
flourishing life. The goal of positive 
psychology is to complement and 
extend the traditional problem-
focused psychology that has 
proliferated in recent decades. 
Positive psychology is concerned 
with positive psychological states (eg, 
happiness), positive psychological 
traits (eg, talents, interests, strengths 
of character), positive relationships, 
and positive institutions. We 
describe evidences of how topics of 
positive psychology apply to physical 
health. Research has shown that 
psychological health assets (eg, 
positive emotions, life satisfaction, 
optimism, life purpose, social support) 
are prospectively associated with good 
health measured in a variety of ways. 
Not yet known is whether positive 
psychology interventions improve 
physical health. Future directions for 
the application of positive psychology 
to health are discussed. We conclude 
that the application of positive 
psychology to health is promising, 
although much work remains to be 
done.

Health is a state of complete physical, 
mental, and social well-being and not 
merely the absence of disease or 
infirmity.

—World Health Organization1

Most would agree with this statement, 
but over the years, it has been largely a 
slogan. More recently, theory, research, 
and applications from the perspective of 
positive psychology have helped 
articulate the meaning of health and 

Research has shown that not only are 
physical, mental, and social well-beings 
important components for complete 
health, but they are also interconnected. 
Evidence is accumulating that a happy, 
engaged, and fulfilling psychological and 
social life is not just a consequence of 
good health, it is what leads people to 
live a healthy and long life.

This article provides a brief overview of 
what positive psychology is and addresses 
how theories, findings, and especially

umbrella term for the scientific study of 
the various contributors to a healthy and 
thriving life for the self and others (eg, 
positive emotions, life meaning, engaging

study of strengths, assets, and positive 
attributes. The topics of concern to

of psychological, social, and societal

assumes that life entails more than 
avoiding or undoing problems and that 
explanations of the good life must do 
more than reverse accounts of problems. 
Someone without symptoms or disorders 
may or may not be living well. Positive 
psychology urges attention to what is 
taking place on the other side of the zero 
point of being problem-free. It calls for as 
much focus on strength as on weakness, as 
much interest in building the best things in 
life as in repairing the worst, and as much 
attention to fulfilling the lives of healthy 
people as to healing the wounds of the 
distressed. Research findings from positive 
psychology are intended to contribute to a 
more complete and balanced scientific 
understanding of human experiences and 
ways to foster thriving in individuals, 
communities, and societies.

One of the triggers for the introduction 

of positive psychology was the 
realization that since World War II, 
psychology as a field had devoted much 
of its effort to identifying, treating, 
and—occasionally—preventing problems 
such as anxiety and depression.3 The 
yield of these problem-focused efforts 
has been impressive, but a myopic view 
of the human condition has resulted. It is 
as if psychology has viewed people as 
only fragile and flawed.

The goal of positive psychology is to 
complement and extend the problem-
focused psychology, and an important 
idea from positive psychology is that one 
way to solve problems is by identifying 
and leveraging individual and societal 
strengths and assets.5

The topics of concern to positive 

psychology can be divided into 4 related 
topics2,3:

•• Positive subjective experiences 

(happiness, gratification, fulfillment, 
flow)

•• Positive individual traits (strengths of 
character, talents, interests, values)
•• Positive interpersonal relationships 
(friendship, marriage, colleagueship)
•• Positive institutions (families, schools, 

businesses, communities)

The value of positive psychology is to 
use the scientific method to sort through 

various claims and hypotheses about 
what it means to live well or poorly and 
to identify the relevant circumstances in 
each case.

Positive Psychology 
and Health

Can physical health be clarified by a 
positive perspective in the same way that 
psychological well-being has been 
clarified? To return to the definition of 
health by the World Health Organization 
with which this article began,1 a positive 
perspective urges us to look beyond the 
mere absence of disease and infirmity to 
define what it means to be healthy in 
positive terms.6-8 Positive health can be 
characterized not only as a long and 
disease-free life but additionally in terms of

•• Less frequent and briefer ailments
•• Greater recuperative ability
•• Rapid wound healing
•• More physiological reserves
•• Chronic but nondebilitating diseases

Familiar within the field of 

epidemiology are the population-level 
concepts of DALYs (disability adjusted 
life years), HALYs (health-adjusted life 
years), and QALYs (quality-adjusted life 
years), which combine measures of 
morbidity and mortality into the same 
index.9 Along these lines, HLEs 
(happiness-adjusted life expectancies) 
measure the quality of life in a nation by 
forming the product of the average life 
expectancy and the average happiness 
(aka subjective well-being, life 
satisfaction) in that nation.10 Positive 
health concerns itself with the individual-
level analogues of these constructs.
The field of positive health as we 

envision it overlaps with allied 
approaches concerned with disease 
prevention, health promotion, and 
wellness. The value of positive health as 
an approach in its own right is that it 
makes explicit the need to consider good 
health as opposed to the absence of 
poor health. Studies of “wellness” often 
end up being studies of illness, much as 
studies of mental “health” are often 
studies of mental illness.

Concern with positive health leads to 

an examination of health assets, 
individual-level factors that produce 
positive health in one or more of the 
ways that it might be defined, over-and-
above the frequently studied risk factors 
for poor health, like high cholesterol, 
obesity, smoking, excessive alcohol use, 
and a sedentary lifestyle.8 Among the 
psychosocial risk factors frequently 
examined with respect to poor health are 
anger, anxiety, depression, and social 
isolation. By the logic of a positive 
perspective, the mere absence of these 
negative states and traits is not all that 
matters for physical health. Important as 
well are positive states and traits, and the 
contribution of these in their own right 
needs to be studied, controlling for 
negative states and traits as well as other 
usual-suspect risk factors.

There have been extensive studies on 

negative psychological factors such as 
stress, depression, hostility, and their 
effects on increased risk of various 
health problems.11 However, less known 
is whether certain positive psychological 
factors play a protective role against 
health risks. Research has shown that 
positive and negative emotions are not 
opposite and are only modestly 
correlated.12,13 Experiencing each of 
those emotions is also involved in the 
activation of different brain regions.14

For the past several years, researchers 

have examined the contributions of 
health assets, especially psychological 
ones, to good health, while they have 
controlled for established risk factors. 
Researchers need to examine both risk 
factors and health assets to understand 
relationships between both positive and 
negative psychological factors as they 
together contribute to health outcomes.
Carefully conducted research shows 
that positive health assets indeed predict 
good health assessed in a variety of 
ways.15 Among the positive psychology 
health assets foreshadowing good health 
are

•• Positive emotions16,17
•• Life satisfaction17,18
•• Optimism19-22
•• Forgiveness23

•• Self-regulation24
•• Vitality and zest25
•• Life meaning and purpose26-29
•• Helping others and volunteering30-32
•• Good social relationships33-35
•• Spirituality and religiosity36,37

There has been growing evidence that 

positive psychological characteristics 
affect health and longevity using various 
research methods including longitudinal 
prospective and experimental designs.

Perhaps, among the most well-known 

long-term studies that showed the 
possible link between positive 
psychological assets and health outcomes 
is The Nun Study.38 A group of American 
nuns who were members of the School 
Sisters of Notre Dame wrote 
autobiographical essays in their early 20s 
when they joined the Sisterhood. Six 
decades later, researchers who had 
accessed the convent archive scored the 
emotional content of 180 essays in terms 
of positivity, and investigated whether 
they were related to the mortality of 
nuns. Indeed, positive emotional content 
was significantly related to longevity. The 
nuns who expressed more positive 
emotions (those in the upper 25%) in 
their essays, strikingly, lived on average 
10 years longer than those expressing 
fewer positive emotions (those in the 
bottom 25%). In other words, happier 
nuns lived longer than less happy (but 
not depressed) nuns. Putting this in 
context, unhealthy behavior like smoking 
costs on average 7 years of one’s life.2

In another experimental study, Cohen 

and his colleagues examined the 
relationships between positive emotions 
and the vulnerability of catching the 
common cold.39 With 334 healthy adult 
volunteers in the community, they first 
measured both positive emotional 
experience, such as happy, pleased, 
lively, and relaxed, and negative 
emotional experiences, such as 
depressed, anxious, and hostile, over a 
few weeks using self-reports. Afterward, 
participants were invited to the study lab 
and exposed to rhinoviruses through 
nasal drops and monitored in quarantine 
for the development of the common 
cold. The researchers found that higher 

positive emotional experiences were 
related to lower risk of developing a cold 
and fewer reports of symptoms, while 
negative emotional experiences were not 
significantly related to catching a cold, 
but associated with reports of more 
symptoms. In short, this study showed 
that experiencing positive emotions was 
linked to greater resistance to developing 
the common cold.

The health benefits of positive 
psychological assets have been 
documented in different cultural settings 
as well. For instance, in Japanese culture, 
the most commonly used indicator of 
subjective well-being is the sense of “life 
worth living” (ikigai).29 In a population-
based prospective cohort study with  
43, 391 adults in Ohsaki, Japan, lack of 
the sense of “life worth living” (ikigai) 
was significantly associated with higher 
risk of all-cause mortality over time. 
Those who reported having an ikigai in 
their life in a survey were more likely to 
be alive at a 7-year follow-up compared 
to their counterparts who did not find a 
sense of ikigai. Interestingly, the increase 
in mortality risk was due to an increase 
in mortality from cardiovascular disease 
and external causes such as suicide, but 
not to morality from cancer. Having a 
sense of “life worth living” (ikigai) often 
means having a purpose in life and 
realizing the value of being alive which 
could serve as a motivation for living.
In our own study with US adults, 
having life purpose played a protective 
role for heart health.27 At a 2-year 
follow-up, the higher level of life 
purpose was prospectively related to 
lower risks of incidence of myocardial 
infarction among people with coronary 
heart disease at the baseline.

One of the ways to achieve a sense of 

life meaning and purpose is through 
helping others and doing regular 
volunteer work in communities. 
Research has shown that among elders, 
people who volunteer regularly are 
healthier and live longer.30,31 In a 
longitudinal study with a nationally 
representative sample of community-
dwelling older US adults, a study found 
that volunteerism predicted a lower risk 
of hypertension 4 years later.31 That is, 

those who had volunteered at least 200 
hours in the previous 12 months were 
less likely to develop hypertension risk 
compared to those who did not 
volunteer. However, lower levels of 
volunteering did not decrease the health 
risk of hypertension. It seems that 
dosage and intentions of volunteering 
matters for its health benefits. In another 
study, people who regularly volunteered 
for self-oriented motives did not exhibit 
lower risk for mortality 4 years later, 
while those who regularly and 
frequently volunteered for other-
oriented motives showed lower risk of 
subsequent mortality.32 In conclusion, it 
is good to be good!

One of the well-studied health-related 
positive psychology topics is optimism. 
Optimism is sometimes seen as 
pollyannaism, a naively rosy view of 
the world coupled with a “don’t worry, 
be happy” attitude. However, optimism 
the way researchers study it is a 
disposition to an expectation that the 
future will entail more positive events 
than negative ones.40 Optimists are 
neither in denial nor naive about 
challenges and difficulties in life. They 
simply attend to and acknowledge the 
positive.

Empirical research shows that 
optimism—usually assessed with 
self-report surveys—relates to good 
health and a long life. According to 
research, among asymptomatic men with 
HIV, optimism slowed the onset of AIDS 
over an 18-month follow-up.41,42 Over an 
8-year follow-up, optimism predicted 
better pulmonary function among older 
men, even when smoking was 
controlled.43 In a longitudinal study of 
older men and women, optimism 
predicted not only better health but also 
lower levels of pain.44 Our own research 
group recently reported a study of a 
large nationally representative sample of 
older adults (aged >50 years) in the 
United States showing that over a 2-year 
period, optimism predicted a lower 
likelihood of stroke, even after 
controlling for chronic illnesses, 
self-rated health, and relevant 
sociodemographic, biological, and 
psychological factors.45

In addition, the importance of social 
support and positive relationships on 
good health and well-being has long 
been documented. Supportive social 
relationships were associated with 
longevity, less cognitive decline with 
aging, greater resistance to infectious 
disease, and better management of 
chronic illnesses.33-35

Enough well-designed studies exist in 

support of the premise that health 
assets predict good health to warrant 
further investigation. Research so far 
provides compelling evidence that 
positive psychological health assets 
predict or are associated with various 
health outcomes and longevity among 
healthy populations. However, what is 
relatively unknown are the effects of 
positive health assets for recovery and 
long-term health outcomes among 
those with serious health problems 
such as cancer.

Furthermore, before we consider 

interventions that deliberately encourage 
these assets in order to reduce morbidity 
and mortality and to increase physical 
well-being, there are issues that need to 
be addressed.46

First, assuming that health assets do 

play a causal role, what are the 
mechanisms? Research to date has often 
been stark, usually demonstrating an 
association over time but not clarifying 
how it happens. We assume the 
pathways are multiple, from biological to 
emotional to cognitive to behavioral to 
social. For example, in the case of 
optimism, biologically, it has been linked 
to better immune system functioning, 
and behaviorally, people who are 
optimistic engage in healthier behaviors. 
They eat healthy, exercise, do not smoke 
or drink, and seek medical care when 
they need. Socially, optimists have better 
and more frequent social contacts. All of 
these are associated with health benefits.
It is unknown which pathway bears the 

most traffic or whether the mechanisms 
vary as a function of the specific health 
outcome (eg, cardiovascular disease vs 
the common cold) or as a function of the 
individual’s age, gender, or lifestyle. 
Again, the best a researcher can do is to 
identify plausible mechanisms in a given 

study and explicitly investigate their role 
as mediators.

Second, are health assets a cause of 

good health or merely a correlated 
marker of its real causes? Indeed, the 
array of positive health assets is 
challenging for researchers, who cannot 
study or control all possible assets in the 
same investigation. No single study 
relying on correlational data can be 
definitive, so it is the overall body of 
research investigating health assets that 
must be examined to draw causal 
conclusions.17

Third, do the apparent benefits of 
health assets generalize to all kinds of 
health outcomes? Much of the relevant 
research has ascertained general health 
and all-cause mortality, and some of this 
work has relied only on self-reported 
information about health status. When 
researchers look at specific health 
outcomes assessed in more objective 
ways, psychological health assets seem 
to be more predictive of cardiovascular 
health than they are of freedom from 
cancer. So the benefits of health assets 
may be disease specific. A wider variety 
of diseases needs to be investigated from 
the positive health perspective. Moreover, 
research is not clear about the relative 
contribution of health assets to disease 
onset, to disease progression, and/or to 
recovery.

Positive Psychology 
Interventions for 
Physical Health

Researchers and practitioners have 
begun to develop intervention strategies 
based on positive psychology to increase 
positive psychological assets such as 
positive emotions or life satisfaction to 
bolster physical health. Whether 
increasing positive psychological assets 
will turn to better health outcomes is 
inconclusive. These intervention efforts 
targeting health assets in order to lead to 
better health not only have practical 
significance but also theoretical 
importance because appropriately done 
intervention studies would strengthen the 
claim that health assets actually cause 
good health.

We refer to interventions informed by 

positive psychology as positive 
psychology interventions. Sometimes 
positive psychology interventions entail a 
specific technique, like counting one’s 
blessings at the end of the day or using 
one’s signature strengths of character in 
novels ways.47 At other times, the 
intervention uses a more-elaborated 
therapy package that combines different 
techniques, such as “Well-Being 
Therapy,”48 and Quality of Life Therapy,49 
among others.

Intervention studies allow us to 

conclude that interventions informed by 
positive psychology can indeed change 
positive psychological states and traits, 
sometimes in lasting ways.47,48 An 
important qualification is that long-term 
benefits do not result from one-shot 
interventions unless these lead to a 
change in how someone habitually 
lives.18 Perhaps, what is required is a 
sustained lifestyle change.

On the face of it, intervening to 

increase a health asset should also have 
benefits for physical health, given the 
association between health assets and 
health outcomes. However, this argument 
does not embody a syllogism. Health 
assets may not be direct causes of good 
health, and even if they are, changing 
them may not result in better health. Said 
another way, we do not yet know if the 
health benefits of deliberately cultivated 
happiness or optimism or life meaning 
have the same benefits as their naturally 
occurring counterparts.50

Needed is intervention research that 
incudes physical health as an explicitly 
measured outcome. While it is interesting 
and important to show that a positive 
psychology intervention increases the 
psychological well-being of medial 
patients, the more exciting issue is 
whether the intervention also affects 
their physical health. If so, how quickly 
would health benefits be evident? And 
what is the mechanism by which the 
intervention has an effect?

In studying the mechanisms by which a 

positive psychology intervention 
influences physical health, the role 
played by mundane behavior should not 
be neglected.46 There are 

203

well-documented “healthy” ways of 
behaving,51 including sleeping 8 hours a 
night, eating balanced meals, not 
smoking, not drinking to excess, and 
exercising regularly.

We suspect that positive psychology 

interventions, when successful, lead 
people not only to think and feel in 
more positive ways but also to behave in 
more healthy ways.40,46 For example, 
optimistic people are more actively 
engaged with the world and are better 
problem solvers than their pessimistic 
counterparts. They have more frequent 
and higher quality social contacts as well 
as more social support. All of these 
factors may lead to healthier behaviors 
and habits and eventually to better 
health.

Positive psychology intervention studies 

for better health outcomes are in their 
infancy. So far, nearly all positive 
psychology interventions primarily 
targeted changing health-related 
behaviors such as physical activity, not 
the health outcome directly. Researchers 
have shown that positive psychology 
interventions influence some of the 
biological and behavioral processes 
implicated in good health. For example, 
inducing positive emotions speeds 
cardiovascular recovery following a 
stressful event.52 Training in mindfulness 
meditation can boost immune function.53 
Psychosocial resilience training targeting 
positive emotions, cognitive flexibility, 
social support, life meaning, and active 
coping reduces total cholesterol among 
middle-aged adults.54 Researchers have 
begun to investigate how positive affect 
and affirmation influence physical 
activity and medication adherence 
among patients with coronary artery 
disease,55 asthma,56 and hypertension.57 
The next step in each case is to show 
that such interventions also increase 
good health as opposed to its possible 
precursors.

Using a randomized controlled clinical 

trial, a group of researchers recently 
developed an intervention strategy that 
enhances positive affect and self-
affirmation (PA/SA) and applied it to 3 
different high-risk clinical populations 
(eg, hypertension, asthma, coronary 

artery disease) to change their health-
related behaviors.55-57

In each clinical trial, patients were 
randomly assigned to either the patient 
education (PE) control group or the 
positive-affect/self-affirmation (PA/SA) 
intervention group. For the control 
group, each patient received an 
educational workbook, a pedometer, and 
a behavior contract for a physical activity 
goal. For the intervention group, each 
received PE control components and 
additionally, a PA/SA workbook chapter, 
bimonthly induction of PA/SA by 
telephone, and small mailed gifts. 
Patients in the PA intervention group 
were taught how to self-induce positive 
affect and self-affirmation using a 
workbook chapter, received bimonthly 
inducement of PA/SA by telephone, and 
unexpected small gifts (PA) mailed 
bimonthly several weeks before 
follow-up calls. During PA/SA induction 
phone calls, patients were told to “think 
about things that make you feel good” 
and take a moment each day to enjoy 
positive thoughts (PA), and to think 
about “proud moments” in their personal 
lives if they have a difficult time 
exercising (SA). For both groups, data 
were collected through a standardized 
bimonthly telephone follow-up for 12 
months.

Using this research design, researchers 
conducted 3 parallel studies. In study 1,55 
patients were recruited right after 
percutaneous coronary intervention to 
increase physical activity among people 
with coronary artery disease. Compared 
to the control group, patients in the 
intervention group engaged in 
significantly more physical activities. In 
study 2,56 physical activity among asthma 
patients who participated in the study 
was improved without differences 
between control and intervention groups. 
There was no significant effectiveness of 
intervention. In study 3,57 the 
intervention effect on enhancing 
medication adherence among 
hypertensive African Americans was 
examined. Patients in both control and 
intervention groups received a culturally 
appropriate hypertension self-
management workbook, a behavioral 

contract, and bimonthly telephone calls 
to help them better handle barriers to 
medication adherence. In addition, 
patients in the PA/SA intervention group 
received small gifts and bimonthly 
telephone calls to help them utilize 
positive thoughts into their daily routine 
and foster self-affirmation. At the 
12-month follow-up, the intervention 
group showed a significantly higher level 
of medication adherence compared to 
the control group (42% vs 36%). The 
reduction of blood pressure was found 
among participants without significant 
differences across groups.

Mixed results from these intervention 
studies leave questions that need to be 
clarified with more studies to better 
understand the effectiveness of a positive 
psychology intervention on the different 
health outcomes before they are 
implemented in health practices.

Another line of positive psychology 

intervention research that attracted 
significant attention in recent years is 
applications of mindfulness meditation. It 
is assumed that meditations induce 
positive affect and lead to good health. A 
study led by a neuroscientist, Richard 
Davidson, demonstrated that mindfulness 
meditation produces changes in brain 
and immune function in a positive way.53 
In this study, 25 healthy employees at a 
work site received an 8-week intensive 
clinical training in mindfulness 
meditation. A weekly training class met 
for about 3 hours, and a silent 7-hour 
retreat was held during week 6 of the 
training. In addition, participants were 
instructed to perform home meditation 
practices for 1 hour each day, 6 days a 
week with the guided audiotapes. Brain 
electrical activity was measured at the 
baseline, the end of training, and 4 
months after training. Also at the end of 
training, participants were vaccinated 
with influenza vaccine. Results from the 
meditation group were compared to 
those of the wait-list control group. 
Among the meditation group, brain 
activity in the left-sided anterior, 
associated with positive affect, was 
significantly increased. They also found 
significant increases in antibody 
concentrations to influenza vaccine in 

204

the meditation group. Interestingly, the 
size of increase in left-sided activation 
predicted the size of antibody 
concentration rise to the vaccine.
In sum, the effects of positive 
psychology interventions on health 
outcomes are inconclusive. As stated 
before, positive psychology interventions 
seem to be more effective on reducing 
health risks among healthy individuals in 
the short term. However, its long-term 
health effects, especially, on a population 
with different health problems, is not 
clear.

Conclusions

Positive psychology is a perspective 
that urges scientific attention to strengths 
and assets that contribute to health and a 
flourishing life. We have described what 
positive psychologists have learned 
about the relationships between positive 
psychological assets and physical health 
in the past decade.

To date, the application of positive 

psychology to health is promising, 
although much work remains to be 
done. On the positive side, research 
shows that what we call positive 
psychological health assets (eg, positive 
emotions, life satisfaction, optimism, 
positive relationships, life purpose) are 
prospectively associated with good 
health measured in a variety of ways. 
Also on the positive side, interventions 
have been developed that increase these 
assets; lasting effects require a lifestyle 
change.

Not yet known is whether positive 

psychology interventions improve 
physical health, reducing morbidity and 
mortality, speeding recovery from illness, 
and so on. Investigators are beginning to 
study the health effects of such 
interventions. Studies to date suggest that 
positive psychology interventions reduce 
some of the biological and behavioral 
processes that affect health, but the next 
step is to study good health per se.
We urge an open mind about the 

eventual success of such interventions. It 
is important not to get too far ahead of 
the data. Perhaps these interventions will 
work as intended, perhaps not. For 

example, the lesson from studies of 
psychological interventions targeting 
negative states and traits such as anger 
and depression in the hope of reducing 
cardiovascular disease, with which they 
are associated, is instructive. The success 
of these interventions is checkered at 
best.46 Whether the deliberate cultivation 
of positive health assets such as positive 
emotions or life purpose will be more 
successful in promoting good health than 
the reduction of psychological risk 
factors is not known, but is a question 
worth addressing.

In conclusion, growing evidence 
suggests that positive psychological 
assets are linked to health and longevity. 
However, more studies are necessary to 
learn more about when, why, how, and 
for whom positive psychological assets 
plays a role in good health and whether 
interventions that enhance these assets 
will yield health benefits. We urge a 
skeptical yet fair-minded attitude on the 
part of researchers and practitioners and 
that they pay particular attention to 
underlying mechanisms. Meanwhile, 
freedom from disease and longevity are 
not the only goals of life. Quality of life 
matters in addition to quantity of life. It 
is clear from research that experiencing 
frequent positive emotions, having sense 
of life purpose, paying attention to what 
is positive in life, and living a more 
socially integrated life is linked to one’s 
quality of life across the lifespan. Thus, 
helping people cultivate positive 
psychological and social assets in life has 
potential for leading to happier, more 
meaningful, and healthier lives.
