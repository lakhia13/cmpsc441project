Abstract

The start of a parenting journey in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) presents many stressors to 
parents. Previous research has shown parents of infants admitted to the NICU experience heightened 
stress, anxiety, and depression. Mental health support varies across Canadian NICUs with mixed results. 
One promising intervention that has not been explored in the NICU is Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy (ACT), a behavioural therapy that has had positive mental health-related outcomes in sim-
ilar parental populations. ACT differs from previous mental health interventions such as traditional 
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) as it involves mindfulness and acceptance to increase psycho-
logical flexibility. Increased psychological flexibility is linked to greater emotional well-being, a higher 
quality of life, and decreased stress, anxiety, and depression. There is a need for research investigating 
the utility of ACT in improving mental health outcomes for parents of preterm infants.

The start of a parenting journey in the neonatal intensive care 
unit (NICU) and the birth of a critically ill infant can present 
many challenges to parents, with stressors including the infant’s 
medical  condition  and  appearance,  the  NICU  environment, 
and alterations in parental role (1–3). Preterm infants are at in-
creased risk for complex medical conditions, frequent hospital-
izations, and neurodevelopmental impairment (2).

Parents of infants admitted to the NICU demonstrate higher 
levels of depression and anxiety compared to parents of healthy 
infants  (1).  Family-centred  interventions  to  address  parental 
mental health are important for parents as well as infants, be-
cause parental well-being and parent–child relationships influ-
ence long-term infant developmental outcomes (1).

Interventions to support parents in the NICU include edu-
cation, psychosocial support, and involvement in the develop-
mental support of the infant (4,5). Parent psychosocial needs, 
though identified as an important intervention component, re-
ceive limited attention (3), and mental health support offered 
to parents varies across Canadian NICUs. This commentary is 
a call to action for research on Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy (ACT) as a mental health intervention for parents of 
hospitalized preterm infants. ACT is an empirically supported 
behavioural  therapy  that  addresses  psychological  distress  by 
fostering  psychological  flexibility  (6),  a  model  of  treatment 
that  is  hypothesized  to  support  parental  mental  health  in  a 
novel way.

PARENTAL MENTAL HEALTH AND 
INTERVENTIONS IN THE NICU

The  NICU  experience  for  parents  is  often  characterized  by 
heightened  stress  and  high  rates  of  anxiety  and  depression 
(1,3,4).  The  medical  condition  of  preterm  infants  can  limit 
close physical contact between mother and baby, increasing the 
risk for attachment difficulties, altered infant development, and 
maternal  anxiety  and  depression  (7).  Paternal  experiences  of 
parenting preterm infants have been less researched (1,4), how-
ever fathers of preterm infants in the NICU have been shown 
to experience high stress, which may impact the parent–child 
relationship (1).

Parents engage in a variety of coping strategies to deal with 
the NICU experience. Some coping strategies are characterized 
by  experiential  avoidance,  which  involves  attempts  to  elim-
inate  or  avoid  the  content  or  frequency  of  unwanted  private 
events such as thoughts, feelings, memories, or sensations (6). 
Avoidant coping strategies are not inherently problematic and 
may  provide  temporary  respite,  but  can  unwittingly  result  in 
increased distress over the long-term (8). Greco et al. (2005) 
found  experiential  avoidance  partially  mediated  the  associa-
tion  between  NICU-related  stress  and  attachment  difficulties 
for mothers of preterm infants (9). Avoidance of thoughts and 
emotions  surrounding  the  preterm  birth  experience  may  de-
crease  a  mother’s  sensitivity  to  infant  cues,  and  subsequently 
decrease maternal responsiveness, impacting her ability to form 
a secure bond with her infant (10). Previous research also dem-
onstrates a correlation between experiential avoidance and ad-
verse mental health outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and 
posttraumatic stress (8).

A systematic review of early interventions to support parents 
of  preterm  infants  found  interventions  composed  of  psycho-
social  support,  education,  and/or  therapeutic  developmental 
interventions  had  positive  effects  on  depressive  symptoms, 
anxiety,  and  self-efficacy,  but  limited  effects  on  stress,  and  no 
overall significant effect on parental sensitivity/responsiveness 
(4). A meta-analysis of interventions for mothers in the NICU 
found using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) as an inter-
vention was associated with improvements in maternal depres-
sive  symptoms,  while  other  interventions,  such  as  education 
and kangaroo care, were not (5). The analysis of interventions 
targeting maternal anxiety symptoms, including CBT and ed-
ucation  based  interventions  indicated  no  statistically  signifi-
cant effect on reduction of anxiety symptoms, potentially due 
to a lack of studies meeting the meta-analysis inclusion criteria 
(5). Given these findings, there remains a gap in the literature 
for  high  quality  studies  assessing  mental  health  interventions 
for parents. A better understanding of the role of experiential 
avoidance  may  also  inform  the  development  of  interventions 
for parental mental health (9). ACT differs from current mental 
health interventions for parents as it promotes acceptance as a 

key mechanism of change to undermine unworkable levels of 
experiential  avoidance  (9,10),  making  it  conceptually  appli-
cable for parents in the NICU.

ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT 
THERAPY

ACT  interventions  focus  on  cultivating  acceptance  of  internal 
events, such as thoughts and feelings, to promote connection with 
one’s  personal  values  and  goals  (6).  Unlike  other  mindfulness-
based 
interventions  such  as  Mindfulness-Based  Cognitive 
Therapy  (MBCT)  and  Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy  (DBT), 
ACT  involves  mindful  attention  and  acceptance  as  a  means  of 
fostering psychological flexibility (6). Psychological flexibility is 
defined  as the  willingness to experience  difficult private events 
and the ability to choose actions in the present moment that align 
with one’s values (6). Psychological flexibility is the opposing ori-
entation  of  experiential  avoidance  (6).  Increased  psychological 
flexibility  is  linked  to  more  adaptive  psychological  functioning 
and parenting practises, greater emotional well-being, and higher 
quality of life (11). It is theorized that parents with increased psy-
chological flexibility may be better able to manage and cope with 
their preterm infant’s condition.

An  example  may  illustrate  how  ACT  would  fit  within  the 
NICU.  Consider  a  mother  experiencing  distress  about  how 
fragile her preterm baby is, and subsequently avoiding spending 
time in the NICU. An ACT approach may help her acknowl-
edge  that  this  avoidance  is  providing  short-term  relief,  but  is 
making her feel disconnected from her child while not reducing 
her anxiety in the long-term. Fostering a willingness to experi-
ence uncomfortable thoughts and feelings may help the mother 
choose actions that are aligned with her value of caring for her 
child, such as choosing to spend time at her baby’s bedside even 
in the presence of discomfort.

ACT  uses  six  core  processes  to  develop  psychological  flex-
ibility:  cognitive  defusion,  acceptance,  being  present,  the 
observing  self,  values  clarification,  and  committed  action  (6). 
Each process has its own specific methodology. Early evidence 
indicates the processes targeted by ACT are not targeted, or not 
targeted effectively, by CBT (6). Unlike traditional CBT, ACT 
does  not  attempt  to  directly  alter  or  decrease  one’s  distressing 
private  experiences.  Rather,  symptom  reduction  is  achieved 
through  increasing  psychological  flexibility  (6).  The  current 
literature  indicates  that  ACT  has  been  demonstrably  effective 
across a range of populations, psychological problems, and levels 
of severity (6).

ACT-based interventions can be less resource intensive and 
more  flexible  in  their  delivery  than  other  interventions.  This 
may address known barriers to engaging parents in the NICU, 
such as high rates of treatment refusal and participant attrition 
(4,5). When designing and delivering parent support, it is im-
portant to consider barriers to parental engagement including

low  socioeconomic  status,  obligations  outside  the  hospital, 
time constraints, and emotional and mental distress (3). Brief 
and flexible strategies may present advantages in retaining par-
ticipants (5). ACT offers a suitable approach for the NICU as it 
can be delivered in a variety of formats (i.e., individual or group 
sessions), and even brief interventions have demonstrated pos-
itive  outcomes  (6,12).  Unlike  highly  protocolized  interven-
tions, ACT can be delivered by a variety of trained facilitators 
including therapists (6), nurses (13), and parents (12), making 
it affordable and easily implementable.

EVIDENCE FOR THE USE OF ACT WITH 
PARENTS

To  date,  there  have  been  no  published  studies  investigating 
ACT  with  parents  of  preterm  infants,  but  previously  studied 
populations  include  parents  of  children  with  asthma,  autism, 
and  intellectual  disabilities.  A  randomized  controlled  trial 
using ACT with parents of children with asthma found that at-
tending four sessions decreased stress and anxiety in addition 
to reducing the frequency of emergency room visits for asthma-
related issues (13). Parents in the intervention group reported 
fewer negative emotional experiences, fewer stress symptoms, 
increased psychological flexibility, and higher quality of life at 
6 months postintervention (13).

A study of mothers of children with autism found participa-
tion in a single ACT workshop led to significant reductions in 
stress,  depression,  and  social  isolation  scores  (12).  A  qualita-
tive study by Reid et al. (2016) evaluated ACT for caregivers of 
young children with intellectual disabilities. Parents described 
positive changes that occurred after the workshop, including a 
new perception of their struggles, an improved ability to cope 
with stress, and the incorporation of mindfulness to their daily 
life (14).

These  studies  suggest  that  brief  ACT  interventions  with 
parents  are  feasible  and  can  lead  to  positive  changes  that  are 
maintained long-term (12,13). These findings are aligned with 
burgeoning mainstream interest in mindfulness-based interven-
tions to promote well-being, and are supported by a recent call 
for  further  exploration  of  mindfulness  and  acceptance-based 
strategies for parents of children with disabilities (15). While 
the experience of having a preterm infant differs from the expe-
rience of having a child with a chronic condition, these popu-
lations  share  features  of  parental  distress  and  long-term  child 
health concerns. These findings may therefore be generalizable 
to parents of preterm infants, and ACT may help parents cope 
while in the NICU and after discharge.

Given the potentially distressing experience of having a preterm 
infant in the NICU, there is a need for further research on inter-
ventions to support parental mental health, with the long-term 
goal  of  establishing  a  standardized,  evidence-based  approach. 

ACT can promote psychological flexibility and acceptance (6), 
increase quality of life (13), and decrease depression, anxiety, and 
stress (6,12,13). Enhanced psychosocial support for parents has 
the potential to improve parent–infant attachment and develop-
mental  outcomes  for  preterm  infants  (4).  Future  research  into 
family-centred care should explore the feasibility and impact of 
delivering ACT with parents of preterm infants.
