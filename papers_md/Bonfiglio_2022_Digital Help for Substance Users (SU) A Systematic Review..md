Abstract: The estimated number of Substance Users (SU) globally has currently reached a very high
number and is still increasing. This aspect necessitates appropriate interventions for prevention
and speciﬁc treatments. The literature shows that digital treatments can be useful in the context
of health services and substance abuse. This systematic review focuses mainly on research on the
effectiveness of digital treatments for SU. Data sources included studies found on PsycINFO, PubMed,
SCOPUS, and WebOfScience (WOS) database searches. The following keywords were used: TITLE
(digital OR computer OR software OR tablet OR app OR videogame OR seriousgame OR virtualreality)
AND ABSTRACT((mental AND health) AND (addiction OR dependence OR substance OR drug)). We
focused on peer-reviewed articles published from 2010 through 2021 using PRISMA guidelines. A
total of 18 studies met the inclusion criteria (i.e., type of intervention, efﬁcacy in terms of misuse
of substances and scored outcomes from questionnaire or toxicology tests, study methodology).
The studies included investigations of speciﬁc digital treatments for SU of various kinds of drugs.
The interventions were administered using personal computers, smartphones, or, in a few cases,
tablets. Most of the interventions focused on the cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) model and/or
on the use strategies, tips, or feedback. A minority provided information or training programs.
The current review shows that digital treatments and interventions are effective in reducing the
frequency of use, augmenting abstinence, or reducing the gravity of dependence for most of the
studies at post-treatment. However, due to the heterogeneity of the variables (i.e., substance type,
digital tool used, and treatment administered), there was a reduced generalizability of the results.
This review highlights the need to continue the research in this ﬁeld, and above all, to create effective
digital protocols.

1. Introduction

Digital treatments can be useful in the context of health services. Our attention
is directed to digital treatments for mental health [1] and, especially, to dependence
disorders [2–5]. There is increasing evidence of the expansion of digital tools and sys-
tems for assessment, intervention, support, and prevention in the ﬁeld of mental health
thanks to, in part, the evidence provided by many studies and scientiﬁc research on the
effectiveness of these treatments in helping people with mental health disorders [6]. The
convergence of digital technologies with the ﬁelds of mental health and health care, which
we can refer to as digital health or mHealth, has allowed for the increasing development
and diffusion of these technological tools, resulting in continuous innovation. This ﬁeld
is increasingly active and growing, and treatments range from screening and monitoring
to diagnosis and therapies (often administered alongside traditional therapies) [7–14]. It
makes use of ‘wearable’ devices—such as virtual reality helmets, patches, digital patches,
and tattoos—that have innumerable screening and monitoring functions and make use
of increasingly innovative technologies using artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms and nan-
otechnology. By contrast, ‘nonwearable’ technologies are based on the use of smartphone

applications, computer software and programs, internet platforms with psychoeducational
or therapeutic purposes, video games or training, avatars, or typical chat tools (such as chat-
bots) implementing artiﬁcial intelligence technologies [15]. The relationship between health
and digitalization was strongly highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic [16,17]. These
unprecedented times led to a big ‘boom’ in the use of technology in the health and mental
health ﬁelds, as many people experienced the difﬁculties of accessing services in the tradi-
tional way [18]. These technologies can help ﬁll possible gaps due to difﬁcult access to care,
especially for younger people, who are more prone to seeking technology-based healthcare
services. Digital interventions also have other advantages, such as availability at any day
of the week and at any hour (especially if they do not require an operator, as in the case
of chatbot interventions) and can be ‘on-demand’. In addition, many interventions have
lower costs than traditional treatments. Finally, they can help people who do not access
services in the traditional way due to shame and social stigma, thus increasing the number
of people who can use them [19]. Illness has costs for the individual and society; therefore,
it is necessary to ﬁnd as many solutions as possible to promote health and increase access
to health services (including digital healthcare solutions). Among health preservation
services, special attention should be paid to addiction or substance abuse [4,20]. Although
many studies and reviews [12,13] have focused on SU, more research is needed to prove
the effectiveness of speciﬁc digital treatments.

This is the reason why in this systematic review we focus on the digital based treat-
ments for SU [21,22]. SU is referred to habitual substance users and can also include
substance use disorders. A body of literature [5,23–26] shows the beneﬁt of using digital
mode to reach people who have limited access to treatments or presents other limitations
in accessing standard protocols. However, the ﬁeld of digital interventions for treating the
use of substances is vast and varied, and likewise, the interventions for such disorders, and
the digital tools currently available.

A principal point to consider in SU is that a dependent person lacks sufﬁcient control
over the use of a drug, thus acting with behavioral dyscontrol and in a discontinuum. A
principal characteristic of dependence syndromes is the uncontrollable desire to use sub-
stances such as drugs, alcohol, or tobacco. The literature also underlines that in dependence
syndromes, returning to substance use after a period of abstinence causes a more rapid
reappearance of the features of the syndrome that occur in nondependent subjects [27].

In addition, SU sometimes are refractory to any type of treatment and have very high
drop-out rates. Whereas in-person treatments have been validated and have provided
effective protocols, digital treatments do not have such a long history, and very often, their
protocols is not tied to the interface. If there are existing effective protocols, there needs
to be more connection between those who make the content and those who create the
technological instruments. Teamwork is needed to integrate the strengths of in-person
interventions with those of digital interventions. There is also a lack of individualized
treatments at the technology level. Hence, more focus is needed on this aspect.

This systematic review was made in order to better understand (i) the effectiveness of
digital treatments for SU, (ii) results indicated in each study, and (iii) which kind of digital
treatment is more effective in relation to the population of the study and to the speciﬁc
substance used. Furthermore, this review was designed to provide a framework that would
aid researchers in evaluating new literature, give new directions for future research, and
help to create useful and shareable treatments with adequate digital support.

2. Methods
2.1. Overview

This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting

Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [28,29].

PsycINFO, PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (WOS) databases were systemati-
cally searched, using the following keywords: TITLE (digital OR computer OR software OR
tablet OR app OR videogame OR seriousgame OR virtualreality) AND ABSTRACT ((men-

tal AND health) AND (addiction OR dependence OR substance OR drug)). The search
strategy has been included as Supplementary Materials S1. We focused on peer-reviewed
articles published from 2010 through 2021. Results were limited to English, Italian, and
Spanish language peer-reviewed journal publications. Primary searches were completed in
December 2021.

2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

To be included in the review, studies had to report treatments using digital technology
(i.e., using a computer, APP, tablet, or smartphone) for SU. SU participants should have
been selected either through formal diagnosis or self-identiﬁcation of current or past
problematic substance use. Outcomes have to be measured through validated and/or
standardized questionnaires (e.g., Alcohol Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test or AUDIT) or
through the Visual Analogue Scale, or questions asked by the authors of participants and
directly related to SU. Studies were also included if they refer to participants with several
psychiatric disorders, including SU.

Book chapters, meta-analyses, reviews, comments, letters, and theoretical papers
were excluded. Studies were also excluded if they: (i) did not report a digital technology
treatment for SU; (ii) considered problematic internet, app, or computer use; (iii) reported
use of the tools (e.g., computer or tablet) to administer surveys; (iv) used Virtual Reality
to reproduce the effects of drugs (e.g., hallucinations); (v) reported a standardization
or validation of a treatment using an app or a serious game. Moreover, ad hoc, or non-
validated instruments or indirect outcomes (e.g., depression or anxiety) were not considered
as outcomes.

2.3. Study Selection and Extraction Steps

All identiﬁed citations were imported into the bibliographic manager software Zotero
5.0 (Corporation for Digital Scholarship, Vienna, VA, USA). Duplicates were identiﬁed
and removed, after which abstracts, and titles were screened by two independent review-
ers (MLM and NSB) for eligibility. Discordant eligibility determinations were resolved
by consensus.

The full texts of the eligible records were then obtained and screened for eligibility
according to the exclusion criteria. Any doubts or conﬂicts were resolved by discussion
between the three reviewers (M.L.M., N.S.B., and M.P.P.), to reach a consensus.

2.4. Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers (M.L.M. and N.S.B.) created a data extraction standard-
ized form in Microsoft Word (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). The ﬁrst
author, year of publication, number of participants, diagnosis of participants, age, study
setting, comparator, outcomes, type of treatments, and devices used were extracted from
each included study. Any discrepancies in the extracted data were resolved by a third
reviewer (M.P.P.).

2.5. Synthesis

The study quality and characteristics of interest were tabulated and narratively de-
scribed. Two independent reviewers (M.L.M. and N.S.B.) assessed the quality of retrieved
studies [30]. A standardized quality tool was used based on the following quality criteria
(see Supplemental Material S2): a minimum of 50 subjects per sample, validated mea-
sures, follow-up, pre-post training design, randomized subject selection and/or condition,
presence of control condition, presence of placebo condition, and evidence of utility.

Each criterion was recorded as 1 (present) or 0 (absent). Score ranged from 0 to 8. The

higher the score the higher the quality of the study.

3.1. Study Selections and Extractions

A total of 530 abstracts were located, of which 325 were removed, being duplicates. A
total of 205 studies were screened against titles and abstracts. Subsequently, 139 studies
were excluded, and among the 66 studies assessed for full-text eligibility, 48 studies were
excluded. A total of 18 studies ﬁnally met our inclusion criteria and were included (Figure 1).
In the ﬁnal selection, only English studies were included.

Tests were administered at baseline
and at 6 and at 12 months.
A signiﬁcant difference was
found at 6 months on the FTND
(p = 0.01), reporting a lower score
as a means of reducing
dependence for the intervention
group, compared to the
control group.

Assessment was administered at
baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months.
There was a signiﬁcant reduction
in cannabis use over time in the
TBI group (p ≤ 0.05), but not in
the EUC group. Only
participants aged 18 to 25 years
who received TBI showed
signiﬁcant reductions in cannabis
use. Moreover, the reductions in
alcohol use after TBI were found
among men (p ≤ 0.01), but not
among women.
Although CBI reduced cannabis
use days when examined as a
sole outcome, it did not result in
signiﬁcant reductions in severity
of alcohol use and cannabis use
relative to EUC.

Effect sizes estimation revealed a
medium effect size for changes in
self-reported weekly alcohol
consumption (r = 0.55), and small
effect sizes for changes in
self-reported drug consumption
(r = 0.47), and severity of drug
(r = 0.29) and alcohol dependence
(r = 0.28).
Signiﬁcant reductions in SDS
score and in overall RPM were
also found (p ≤ 0.001).

Participants were provided with
access to the computer assisted
treatment program for 12 months,
and engaged with it as self-directed
treatment.
A medium effect size was found
for reductions in weekly opioid
use (r = 0.71), and small effect
sizes for reductions in severity of
opioid dependence (r = 0.42)
from baseline to post-treatment.
Improvements were also found in
all RPM six domains (p ≤ 0.001).

For most of the studies, the principal substance selected for treatment was alcohol (n = 12),
followed by marijuana/cannabis (n = 8), stimulants (e.g., amphetamines or cocaine) (n = 7),
tobacco (n = 5), opioids (n = 4), heroin (n = 4), other drugs (n = 3), and benzodiazepines
(n = 2). One study did not specify the type of drugs selected.

The majority of the interventions were administered through a personal computer
(PC)—i.e., with an on-line platform (n = 14). The use of smartphones (i.e., app for smart-
phones) was less common (n = 5), as well as tablets (n = 2).

Moreover, the selected studies reported a heterogeneity of the type of approaches
and models used for digital treatment. The majority used Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
(CBT) (n = 7), followed by Brief Alcohol Intervention (BAI) (n = 2), Informative intervention
(n = 2), Attentional Bias (n = 2), Interactive Voice Response (IVR) (n = 1), Digital Recovery
Support Services (D-RSS) (n = 1), e-Learning (n = 1), Computer-Guided Therapy (CBI)
(n = 1), Self-Determination Therapy (SDT) (n = 1), Health Action Process Approach model
(n = 1), Effectiveness of Computer-tailored Smoking Cessation Advice in Primary Care
(ESCAPE) (n = 1), and the Information-Motivation-Behavior model (n = 1).

Substance use outcomes were measured with validated measures (n = 13), or as a
means of frequencies of substances use (e.g., days of use, quantity of use) (n = 11), abstinence
(e.g., days of abstinence) (n = 3), recovery measures (e.g., functioning in domains that are
implicated in SUDs) (n = 5), or with biological tests (e.g., urine test) (n = 3).

As regards methodology and study design, most of the selected studies used follow-up
assessment (n = 16) or a pre-post evaluation after intervention (n = 2). Fewer studies have
divided samples in subgroups (e.g., separate conditions) (n = 10). Of these, nine studies
have randomized conditions and seven studies have added control groups/conditions. No
studies used a placebo condition.

As regards the results, 17 out of 18 studies indicated obtaining positive results at
least for one of the outcomes, as a means of reduced abstinence, days of use, or reduced
gravity of addiction. However, only four out of nine studies reported differences of utility
between groups or conditions, and three studies did not compare groups or conditions (see
Supplemental Material S2).

4. Discussion

This paper aimed to detect effectiveness of existing digital tools in reducing substance
use. We used restricted criteria to identify relevant studies and report (i) the type of
intervention, (ii) its efﬁcacy in terms of substance misuse and scored outcomes from
questionnaire or toxicology tests, and (iii) the study methodology.

Despite the optimism surrounding the use of digital interventions to reduce the misuse
of substances such as alcohol and tobacco, the evidences presented on the effects of such
interventions are weak. Digitally delivered interventions for substance misuse are likely to
require robust evidence of their effectiveness if they are to be widely adopted and compared
to real-world interventions and settings.

4.1. Outcomes and Measurements

Overall, 17 out of 18 studies reported at least one positive outcome for the reduction
of substance misuse in the evaluated population. Although the study quality and data
analysis were generally weak, the results suggested that digital interventions may produce
some reduction in substance misuse. However, not all of the selected studies measured
substance misuse or the gravity of dependence as primary outcomes.

We found that digital treatments and interventions are effective in reducing sub-
stance misuse—more precisely, decreasing the frequency of use, augmenting abstinence, or
reducing the gravity of dependence in most of the studies at post-treatment.

In addition, most studies have demonstrated treatment effectiveness as a function
of frequency measures, such as abstinence (n = 2) or the reduction in the amount of sub-
stance use (n = 9), rather than standardized (n = 3) or objective (n = 1) measures.
It
would be desirable, in our opinion, to prove the effectiveness of treatment using primarily

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 11309

11 of 16

standardized instruments that measure the severity of addiction and use objective instru-
ments (e.g., biomarkers). In fact, some of the studies selected in this review reported,
for example, a reduction in the frequency of use and in scoring scores, albeit not always
statistically signiﬁcant.

Moreover, most of the studies also measured treatment effectiveness for only one
substance. A treatment effect on the main substance (reported by the subject) does not

more likely to use more than one substance (poly-dependence) rather than one (mono-
dependence), resulting in increased severity of dependence and difﬁculty in treatment.
Therefore, to obviate possible bias in the results, one should measure the subject’s level of
addiction rather than the use of a speciﬁc substance.

Finally, only two studies used cognitive bias as a measure of dependence, and only
one found a reduction in bias at follow-up. Cognitive bias (e.g., the Stroop effect) is
a very reliable proxy measure because it is an objective measure of a subject’s level of
addiction. The use of a proxy measure, such as a cognitive bias (widely used in the
literature), could increase the reliability of the effectiveness of a digital treatment. The
variation in outcome measures and the main use of frequency and abstinence as outcomes—
instead of more objective measures—reﬂects the variability of the aims of the selected
studies (e.g., evaluating the cost effectiveness of an intervention), in which substance
misuse was considered merely a secondary outcome. It should be noted that this could
also reﬂect the lack of a gold standard for measurements [49], as mentioned by some of
the authors in the limitations section of their study [44], despite the existing literature
on some of the most studied substances [50–52]. A few studies have used an alternative
and more objective measure to cover this deﬁciency: toxicology screening tests [32,42,45].
Nevertheless, toxicology screenings have their own disadvantages, such as the inability to
detect mild use and the lack of privacy—users might prefer to avoid face-to-face contact
with professionals [2,3].

A minority of the selected studies computed the effect size [38–40] and found low or
medium effect sizes. If we compare the effect sizes resulting from digital interventions, as
reported in this review, with those of real-world interventions, we observe that real-world
treatment interventions produce not only small or medium but also large effect sizes [53,54].
Therefore, we suggest that future studies investigate novel approaches to increasing the
effect sizes of digital interventions.

4.2. Models and Approaches

Most of the interventions focused on the CBT model and/or on the use of strategies
(i.e., coping strategies), tips, or feedbacks. A minority provided information or training
programs (i.e., attentional bias). However, the variability of models and approaches
on which the interventions in the selected studies were based and the presence of very
few studies reporting multi-interventions-combinations of digital intervention [31,34,36]
and comparisons with the control condition (see Supplemental Material S1) reduce the
generalizability of the determined utility and effectiveness of the strategies used.

Regarding the effectiveness of treatments, those based on continuous programs to be
carried out in different steps, tailored with exercises and training, seem to be more effective
than short or spot interventions. For example, some teach how to use coping strategies
and require the subjects to follow a program over a certain period, some engage subjects
in psychoeducation or behavioral change programs (such as CBT) structured over a long
period, while others are tailored to the patients’ needs and provide counseling forums
and materials. In our opinion, greater effectiveness might be achieved by (a) medium-
and long-term treatments requiring continuity from the subject or (b) by having a solid
theoretical basis that has been proven to be effective in treating addiction. From this point
of view, it might be the treatment itself that is already effective, regardless of whether
digital technology is used or not.

4.3. Methodology and Intervention Design

Only three studies were able to blind personnel [31,36,52] and no studies reported
blinding participants to ensure that they were unaware of the other conditions and that the
outcome measures were unaffected by possible knowledge of the received intervention.
This leads to a high risk of performance and detection bias that, however, depends on the
nature of the digitally delivered behavioral interventions in most of the included studies.
Follow-up assessments indicated that the post-treatment effects were sustained for
up to three months from the interventions. This indicates that digital intervention is a
suitable approach to achieve a lasting small reduction in substance use. However, many
studies evaluate interventions within 12 months and only one study evaluates intervention
over 12 months [33]. Future research should aim to evaluate the effectiveness of digital
intervention programs beyond three years to better understand how program effects can
be sustained. Moreover, only a few studies compared and reported differences between the
groups, despite having divided their samples into subgroups. This could be a methodologi-
cal weakness leading to nongeneralized results.

However, the moderate successes of digital interventions support the notion that
interventions for substance misuse may have an impact of utility. Although not the focus of
this study, it has been widely acknowledged that digital interventions are more likely to be
successful in populations that have played an active role in their design [55,56]. Therefore,
future interventions should employ a centered design and intervention (UCDI) approach
throughout their design, development, and evaluation to elicit their potential in substance
misuse reduction. To pursue this aim, it is essential that the core user is carefully deﬁned in
the design of these digital interventions to increase the likelihood of addressing user needs
and expectations. This may be achieved through techniques such as persona building,
storytelling, and role playing [57]. User engagement and the acceptability of an intervention
are crucial to its success, indicating that UCDI processes may be a way to increase the
effectiveness of digital interventions and should be considered integral to the evaluation
process. The use of a UCDI is also important if we assume that most people using drugs
(e.g., club drugs) do not want to engage with traditional treatments or support services for
fear of stigma and due to concerns about relevance [58,59]

5. Conclusions

The effectiveness of existing digital treatments for reducing substance misuse among
SU in a wider population was reviewed. Unfortunately, the overall quality of the 18 included
studies was weak; thus, deﬁnitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of these interven-
tions could not be drawn.

There is a clear lack of studies with long-term follow-ups (more than 12 months),
control conditions, randomized samples, and blinded conditions. Moreover, there is a lack
of evidence for other populations, such as employees and ethnic minority groups. Future
primary studies and reviews should include these aspects. In addition, most of the useful
results were obtained with self-assessment outcomes and measures, such as frequency of
use and days of abstinence. Useful results on validated addiction assessment instruments
or through objective tools such as biomarkers and cognitive bias would certainly have
given greater reliability to the effectiveness of the treatments used.

A good portion of the studies selected for this review still provided useful results.
However, it is possible that these results depended mainly on the use of theoretical models
and techniques whose effectiveness are already known from literature. The lack of placebo
conditions and comparisons with control conditions represents another weak point that
does not help to determine how effective a digital intervention is.

In order to increasingly improve digital health interventions, it is desirable that authors
and creators of digital health tools increasingly involve users in the construction of the
intervention itself and in the design and guidelines of APPs and software. For example,
training and serious games (i.e., serious video games) seem to play a particularly signiﬁcant
role in the ﬁeld of mHealth. Especially serious games are becoming increasingly relevant.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 11309

13 of 16

For years, the video game industry has been developing products that not only entertain
but are also educational, pedagogical, and therapeutic, focusing on learning, memory, and
rehabilitation, and so on, enabling them to reach an increasingly broad audience. In the
ﬁeld of rehabilitation, for example, they make it possible to activate a dynamic process of
adaptive and programmed change in the user, in response to an unplanned change due
to a problem, disorder, or trauma that the individual presents. The possibilities offered
by treatments that use technologies such as serious games and training administered
through tablets or PCs are their functionality, their use even at a distance, and above all the
possibility of activating a process of short- and long-term changes, thanks to the continuous
and constant use of the serious game. The effectiveness of this type of intervention is, thus,
in line with the transformations taking place in the ﬁeld of care services. Certainly, what is
crucial is to continue to pursue research in this area that can ensure comprehensive services
that are accessible to all, can be functional, effective, reach the greatest number of users,
and can be shareable.

In this sense, it is necessary to design studies that involve users, health professionals,
designers, and developers to have truly applicable programs for reducing substance abuse
and addiction.

However, the results showed in this review suggest that the success of digital interven-
tions may not only be conﬁned to the misuse of illicit substances, but also to other aspects,
such as the changing of strategies, self-regulation, and behavioral mechanisms delivered
by the interventions [60,61]. Therefore, while digital interventions are a promising devel-
opment area, it is important that interventions undergo robust creation and evaluation
processes, and that effective implementation strategies be used that are best suited to their
context [62].

6. Limitations

This study has several strengths and limitations which should be noted. Even though a
rigorous search criterion was used, few databases were considered for searching. Moreover,
we did not include a gray literature search and reference list screening; thus, relevant
studies were potentially missed. The main use of only two reviewers throughout the
screening and quality appraisal processes could have led to the risk of bias. Finally, we did
not undertake a rigorous quality assessment of the reviews.
