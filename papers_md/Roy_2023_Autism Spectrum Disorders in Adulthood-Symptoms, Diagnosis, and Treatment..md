Autism Spectrum Disorders in 
 Adulthood—Symptoms, Diagnosis, 
and Treatment

Mandy Roy, Peter Strate

Summary

Background: The negative effect of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) persists into adulthood, with impacts on social interactions 
and occupational development. This article reviews the current status of clinical aspects of ASD in adulthood on the basis of 
ICD-11.

Methods: A selective search of PubMed and other relevant publications on ASD focused on changes in ICD-11 and on preva-
lence, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.

Results: The global lifetime prevalence of ASD is around 1%. A number of recent studies have concentrated on behaviors 
termed “camouflaging” (disguising symptoms typical of autism) and “stimming” (use of repetitive self-stimulation), which affect 
the mental health of those concerned. Standardized diagnostic instruments are available, but the data on validity in adulthood 
and on applicability are limited. Gestures, eye contact, facial expressions, social closeness, and reciprocity play particularly im-
portant roles in diagnosis. German-language treatment manuals lack randomized controlled studies: a validated treatment 
 strategy is currently available only in English. Investigation of the prognosis showed limitation of occupational perspectives (54% 
unemployment in the study sample) and 2.9 times higher mortality compared to the general population.

Conclusion: Individual treatment goals should be set, taking account of any coexisting psychiatric disorders. The process of 
 diagnosis remains clinical, using standardized instruments. Further improvement of diagnostic and therapeutic instruments for 
adult ASD is desirable.

A utism  spectrum  disorders  are  characterized  by  a 

 notably reduced intuition for social interactions, un-
usual  interests,  and  stereotypical  behaviors  (1).  In 
adulthood,  substantial  restrictions  to  professional  devel-
opment and to developing interpersonal relationships are 
common (1). This article aims to provide an overview of 
what  is  currently  clinically  known  about  the  symptoms, 
diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of autism spectrum 
disorders in adulthood.

Methods
We conducted a selective literature search in PubMed 
in  November  2021,  using  the  search  terms  “autism” 
and “Asperger syndrome” as well as “adult/adulthood” 
in  combination  with  “prevalence”,  “symptoms”, 
 “hypersensitivity”,  “diagnosis/diagnostic”,  “therapy/
treatment”;  the  search  was  updated  in  October  2022. 
Systematic  reviews,  meta-analyses,  and  randomized 
controlled  trials  were  preferentially  considered.  Fur-
thermore  we  consulted  both  S3  guidelines  for  ASD 
(diagnostic  evaluation;  therapy),  relevant  handbooks, 
and  online  publications  from  WHO  and  the  German 
Federal Statistical Office that were available up to Oc-
tober 2022.

Prevalence
Exact numbers on the prevalence of ASD in adults in 
Germany and trends over the past 20 years do not exist.

TABLE 1 

Diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) according to the ICD-11 and diagnostic codes according to intellectual development 
and possible functional speech impairment 

Diagnostic criteria for ASD according to the ICD-11, summarized. 

● Sustained deficits in initiating/maintaining social communication and social interaction

The following areas may be impaired:
–  Sympathy for or inappropriate reactions to the verbal/non-verbal communication of others
–  Integration of spoken language and non-verbal pointers (for example, eye contact, gestures, facial expressions)
–  Comprehension/use of speech/language in social contexts and ability to initiate mutual social chats and sustain these
–  Social awareness for behavior that is appropriate for the social context
–  Ability to imagine the feelings and emotional states of others and react to those
–  Mutual sharing of interests
–  Ability to establish typical peer relationships and maintain these

● Sustained restricted/limited repeated inflexible behavioral patterns or interests that are untypical/exaggerated for age orsociocultural context

These may include:
–  Lacking adapatability to new experiences; suffering as a result of trivial changes to a familiar environment or unexpected events
–  Inflexible adherence to certain routines,for example, following familiar routes or keeping to exact mealtimes
–  Sticking to rules excessively (for example, during play)
–  Obstinate, ritualized behavior patterns--for example, putting objects in order in a particular way
–  Repeated, stereotypical motor movements, such as moving the entire body, unusual movements of hands or fingers and bodily postures
–  Sustained preoccupation with special interests, objects, or certain types of stimuli
–  Hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity to sensory stimuli (noise, light, textures, smells, taste, heat, cold, and/or pain)
–  Onset of disorder in early childhood
–  Substantial impairments in personal, family related, social, professional, other areas

trends  we  interrogated  the  Information  System  of  the 
Federal  Health  Monitoring  database  using the  follow-
ing criteria:
●  Autism
● Clinical sample of inpatient treatment cases
● All lengths of stay of patients aged 20–50
● Diagnoses:  early  childhood  autism,  atypical 

 autism, and Asperger’s syndrome.

The data interrogation found for 2000 a total of 124 
treatment cases; by 2020 this had risen to 635 cases 
(2). This corresponds to an increase by a factor of five 
over this time period.

Two systematic reviews regarding ASD described 
for  Europe  prevalence  rates  of  0.38%  (Germany)  to 
1.55% (Spain) and for the USA of 1.7–1.85% (3) and 
a  global  median  prevalence  of  1% 
(Europe 
0.24–2.68%)  (4).  These  reviews  included  mostly 
studies  in  children;  only  few  studies  included  adults 
as  hardly  any  data  exist  for  this  group.  Prevalence 
rates reported 20 years ago were lower (including for 
Asperger’s  syndrome,  of  about  0.25%)  (5).  One 
 reason  for  this  increase  could  be  increased  attention 
regarding  ASD,  with  diagnostic  investigation  more 
common. But there are also indications that environ-
mental  factors  are  involved,  such  as ASD  after  val-

proate intake during pregnancy (6) and an older age 
of father or mother at the time of fertilization (7).

Changes in the ICD-11
The ICD-10 included in the chapter on pervasive devel-
opmental  disorders  the  categorical  diagnoses  of  early 
childhood  autism  and  atypical  autism,  as  well  as As-
perger’s syndrome (8). The crucial differential criterion 
to Asperger’s  syndrome  was  delayed  cognitive  devel-
opment  and  speech  development  in  early  childhood 
autism  (8).  It  transpired,  however,  that  the  validity  of 
the distinction of these diagnostic criteria was not satis-
factory and that transitions are fluent. Numbers and the 
severity of autism symptoms varied within and between 
the  diagnostic  subgroups  and  the  prognostic  predicta-
bility  of  the  subcategories  was  low  (9).  The  ICD-11 
therefore now includes in the chapter on neuronal de-
velopmental  disorders  in  analogy  to  the  DSM-V  the 
diagnostic category of autism spectrum disorders on a 
dimensional  basis  (1),  which  enables  further  specifi-
cation by means of the two characteristics of an intel-
lectual  development  disorder  and  the  degree  of  func-
tional speech impairment (Table 1). 

The previously separate symptom areas of difficul-
ties  in  social  interaction  and  communication  were 

88

M E D I C I N E

combined  into  one  symptom  area.  Here  too  the 
 separation was not valid—both areas have substantial 
overlap.  Deficits  in  communication  relate  materially 
to social interaction and are not of a structural nature 
(vocabulary  or  grammar)  (9).  Furthermore,  because 
of  its  frequent  occurrence,  hyper-  or  hyposensitivity 
to  sensory  stimuli  was  included  as  a  diagnostically 
relevant  symptom  of  ASD  (9)  (Table  2).  In  the 
ICD-11 the clinical severity across different phases of 
life is also described, including adulthood. The fact is 
mentioned  that  social  difficulties  in  dyadic  relation-
ships  can  be  better  managed  by  compensation  strat-
egies than in group constellations and special interests 
can  be  useful  professionally.  The  working  environ-
ment  should  therefore  be  adapted  to  the  person. 
 Furthermore, mention is made of the fact that a first 
diagnosis in adulthood often happens after decompen-
sation in the private or professional environment.

Symptoms
The  symptom  areas  of  ASD  in  the  ICD-11  comprise 
two categories (Table 1) (1):

● Difficulties in social interaction/communication 
● Limited  areas  of  interest/repetitive  behaviors  in-

cluding unusual sensory sensitivity. 

The  symptoms  present  typically  from  early child-
hood, are sustained, and lead to impairments in differ-
ent  areas  of  life—for  example,  in  family,  school, 
 professional, or social environments.

Persons with ASD have a reduced intuition for so-
cial situations, do not recognize body language intu-
itively,  and  interpret  language  in  a  very  concrete 
manner. In talks/chats they grasp the emotional level 
to an insufficient degree. Even though for their inter-
locutor,  communication—for  example  during  small 
talk—serves  to  shape  the  relationship,  for  persons 
with ASD  the  factual  information  level  is  of  crucial 
importance. 

Recently,  the  compensation  of  autistic  character-
istics—a  conscious  or  unconscious  behavior  known 
as  camouflaging  or  masking—has  been  studied  in  a 
systematic  manner.  A  unified  operationalization  of 
this  concept  does  not  exist  to  date.  Often,  however, 
this is understood to be the use of specific behaviors 
and cognitive strategies that autistic persons deploy to 
ensure that social deficits remain as invisible as poss-
ible. They have adapted to the non-autistic world so 
as to be less conspicuous and cope better within this 
world (10). Non-autistic behavior can be advantage-
ous  especially  in conducting partner  relationships  or 
friendships,  when  completing  education/training/ap-
prenticeships,  in  employment,  or  to  prevent  exclu-
sion.  Camouflaging  can,  for  example, 
include 
 suppression  of  repetitive  movements,  forcibly  sus-
tained  eye  contact,  or  the  use  of  learnt  formulaic 
phrases (10). Cook et al (2021) in a systematic review 
analyzed  18  studies  of  camouflaging  in  adults  with 
ASD (10). Nine of the studies analyzed an association 
with sex:

* Sample: n = 200 persons with ASD, age: 32 months – 38 years;  

the sample was categorized into four groups based on median age (10.3 ) and 
IQ (below or above 70) (16).

● In five studies, women with ASD deployed camou-

flaging more often than men with ASD

● One  study  confirmed  stronger  camouflaging  in  a 
non-binary  gender  identity  compared  with  male 
sex

● Three studies did not show any association.
An  association  with  camouflaging  and  mental 
wellbeing was investigated in 10 of the studies. Eight 
studies  showed  increased  depression,  anxiety,  and  a 
heightened perception of stress for a higher degree of 
camouflaging.

Repetitive  behaviors  comprised,  for  example, 
 rocking  and  twisting  movements,  knuckle  cracking, 
chewing items, or producing auditory stimuli such as 
whistling,  humming,  or  clapping.  This  self  stimu-
lation has recently become known in science as “stim-
ming.”  In  the  past,  these  stereotypical  behaviors  in 
children were categorized as redundant and gradually 
reduced by training wherever possible. Recent studies 
in  which  adults  with  ASD  were  questioned  in  an 
 interview or by means of a questionnaire showed con-
sistently  that  these  behaviors  have  an  important  self 
regulatory function (11–13): affected persons deploy 
self stimulation, initially often unconsciously, in order 
to  regulate  intense  positive  or  negative  emotional 
states, to soothe themselves, and to regain emotional 
control over themselves. In this setting, rhythm seems 
a  helpful  component  in  stimming,  and  focusing  the 
 attention on stereotypical behaviors results in a reduc-
tion  in  the  perception  of  overly  demanding  stimuli. 
Such stimuli are among the crucial causes of the in-
creased stress experience in ASD and can be extern-
ally  caused—for  example,  in  the  form  of  noise  or 
other sensory stimuli—or they are of an intrinsic na-
ture—for  example,  in  the  sense  or  debilitating 
thoughts and feelings (13). Those affected described 
as problematic the fact that stimming is often socially 
undesirable (11, 13), since repetitive noises or move-
ments are experienced by others as odd or disturbing. 
Suppressing  stimming,  however,  leads  to  further 
stress. Affected  persons  have  reported  improved  ac-
ceptance of stimming after explaining its function (13).

for 
example,  as  hypersensitivities  towards  auditory  or 
tactile stimuli, so that ticking clocks, humming elec-
trical devices, or light touches can be experienced as 
disagreeable  or  burdensome.  Studies  have  described 
that in 18–69% of people with ASD who are affected 
have  hyperacusis  (14).  The  underlying  causes  are 
 heterogeneous and can, among others, also result in a 
reduced/delayed stapedius reflex, anatomical particu-
larities of the semicircular canals of the ear, or abnor-
mal  neuronal  connections  in  the  olivary  nuclei  (14). 
The  other  sensory  modalities  too  can  be  affected  by 
changed sensitivity, visually, for example, in the form 
of  heightened  contrast  perception  or  an  extended 
 visual field (15). Olfactorily or gustatorily, hypersen-
sitivity  or  hyposensitivity  may  be  present  (15). 
Table 2 provides an overview of data on the rates of 
changed  sensitivity  of  the  sensory  modalities,  col-
lected by Leekam et al (2006) in 200 autistic children 
and  adults  (categorized  into  four  groups  by  IQ  and 
age) (16). In 64–83% more than one sensory modality 
was affected. The rates of changed auditory sensitiv-
ities was lower in this study than in the study reported 
by Danesh et al (14).

Diagnosis
The  diagnosis  of ASD  is  made  clinically.  To  date  no 
valid methods exist for confirming the diagnosis tech-
nically  or  biologically. The  diagnostic investigation  is 
done  mostly  in  specialized  centers  and  includes  a 
 detailed  psychiatric  examination  and  medical  history 
regarding the diagnostic criteria in childhood and adult-
hood.  The  Autism  Diagnostic 
Interview-Revised 
(ADI-R) (17) and the diagnostic observation scale for 
autistic disorders (ADOS-2) (18) are still the diagnostic 
gold  standard.  The ADI-R  comprises  93  items  and  is 

preferably undertaken with the patient’s parents. Mod-
ule 4 of the ADOS-2 was conceived for adults and in-
cluded special interview questions and test questions. A 
study  of  385  adolescents  with ASD  and  288  controls 
found by using machine learning that the isolated use of 
five  test  subgroups  of  the ADOS  module  4  (gestures, 
eye contact, facial expressions, social approaches, reci-
procity), with a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 
87%, were comparable with the application of the en-
tire test (19).

In the most recently published S3 guidelines for the 
diagnostic evaluation of ASD, neither of these two in-
struments  is  recommended,  and  nor  are  any  of  the 
other available standardized diagnostic interviews for 
use in adults, as there isn’t enough study evidence for 
their diagnostic validity, among others (20). The cur-
rent UK guidelines from the Institute for Health and 
Care  Excellence  (NICE)  (21)  do,  however,  recom-
mend several standardized interviews and instruments 
for diagnosing ASD in adults (Table 3).

A third-party medical history should be taken from 
a  person  who  experienced  the  affected  person  in 
childhood (for example, a parent or an older sibling). 
If available, comments from school reports or psychi-
atric preliminary reports are also helpful information 
sources.  On  contact,  especially  the  lacking  eye  con-
tact and lack of facial expression and a monotonous 
way of speaking may be conspicuous.

A  physical  exam  should  be  added  in  order  to,  for 
example,  ascertain  low-grade  ataxia  or  slight  uncer-
tainty in coordination as soft signs of ASD (22). Par-
ticularities  of  the  facial  skull  (Fragile  X  syndrome: 
narrow, elongated face, prominent ears and forehead, 
in 20–30% ASD), height, and development of second-
ary  sexual  characteristics  (Klinefelter  syndrome; 
above average height, reduced body hair; in 11–12%

ASD) can indicate syndromic autism (22). There are 
no precise data on the rates of syndromic disorders as 
a  cause  of  ASD;  according  to  estimates  rates  vary 
 between 10% and 20% (22).

An exploration regarding psychiatric comorbidities 
should  be  carried  out,  especially  depression 
(30–70%), anxiety disorders (45–56%), and attention 
deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHS)  (30%)  are 
common in ASD (22).

In  terms  of  perspective/outlook,  the  development 
of  objective  methods  to  add  to  the  diagnostic  reper-
toire is important. In a study of 664 persons with and 
without ASD, differences were seen on MRI scans of 
the brain by means of machine learning and a specific 
neuronal atlas was developed. This atlas helps ident-
ify the brains of patients with ASD with a precision of 
97±2% (23), although no prospective confirmation of 
this tool is available to date.

Therapy
The S3 guideline on the therapy of ASD (24) empha-
sizes  that  at  the  start  of  treatment,  clear,  individual 
therapeutic goals should be defined that can be geared 
towards the core symptoms of ASD as well as on co-
morbid  psychiatric  disorders.  For  adults  with  ASD 
without  intellectual  disability,  group  therapy  for  3–6 
months  with  6–8  participants  is  recommended,  which 
among others includes the following parameters (24):

● Discussions of situations in everyday life
● Training  in  small  talk,  conversational  technique, 

and establishing contact

● Dealing with stress, emotions, and conflicts.
German-language  manuals  for  psychotherapy  in 
adults  with  ASD  in  a  one-to-one  setting  (25)  and 
group  setting  (26,  27),  which  also  address  the  listed 
topics, exist (Table 4), but no randomized controlled 
trials  (RCTs)  have  been  published  for  these  so  far. 
The  therapeutic  concept  “PEERS  for  young  adults” 
(28), however, has been investigated in RCTs, but it is 
available in English only (Table 4). In adults patients 
with ASD  and  existing  mental  retardation,  the  treat-
ment  according  to  S3  guidelines  should  consist  pri-
marily of behavioral therapeutic training of everyday 
practical  activities  according  to  the  current  develop-
mental state of the patient (24). In concrete terms this 
may  mean,  for  example,  practicing  bodily  hygiene, 
housework, or an activity in a workshop (24).

Self  help  groups  can  also  provide  complementary 

support for affected persons.

A  further  important  area  is  job  support.  Studies 
have  shown  that  job  application  training,  where  job 
interviews  are  practiced  in  role  play  or  in  a  virtual 
 environment  and  small  talk  is  rehearsed,  and  which 
conveys  knowledge  regarding  finding  and  holding 
down a job,  improve the success of job  applications 
and  result  in  placements  in  the  first  workplace  (24, 
29, 30) (Table 4).

Thus far, no medication exists for treating the core 
symptoms of ASD. The S3 guidelines recommends in 
pronounced  stereotypical  behaviors  to  give  anti -
psychotic  drugs,  such  as  risperidone  or  aripiprazole 
(24) for a limited period of a few weeks. The evidence 
for use in adults is poor, however (effects size risperi-
done:  standardized  mean  difference  [SMD]=0.97; 
95%  confidence  interval  [0.21;  1.74];  effect  size  of 
aripiprazole  is  available  only  for  children/adoles-
cents:  SMD=0.48;  [0.26;  0.70])  (31).  For  comorbid 
anxiety  disorders  or  depressive  disorders,  selective 
serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  can  be  used 
(24)  and  for  comorbid  ADHD,  methylphenidate  or 
atomoxetine (24). 

Oxytocin  is  an  active  substance  that  has  been 
 investigated  in  studies  for  several  years  for  its 
 potential  future  clinical  application  (for  example, 
 administered via a nasal  spray).  Data continue  to  be 
heterogeneous, however. Some studies showed short-
term unsustained improvements in social interaction, 
recognition  of  emotions,  and  repetitive  behaviors, 
whereas other studies did not show any significant ef-

fect (32). The existing data therefore do not justify the 
use  of  oxytocin  for  the  treatment  of ASD  in  routine 
clinical practice.

Prognosis
Intellect  is  a  decisive  factor  in  the  prognosis  in ASD. 
Intellectual  disability  mostly  requires  comprehensive 
support,  a  structured  environment,  and  carers  (22). 
 Furthermore, a therapeutic living environment may be 
indicated. In high functioning ASD, impairments often 
affect the achievement of age-typical life goals. Often, 
persons have an above-average educational attainment, 
but no corresponding employment (22). In the authors’ 
own  studies  of  adults  patients  with ASD  (aged  20–62 
years, mean/average 36.5 years), 46 of 50 persons with 
ASD under study were in employment, 28% lived in a 
partner relationship, and 20% had children (33).

A  Swedish cohort  study of  27,122  persons  with  a 
diagnosis of ASD between 1987 and 2009 showed a 
higher  mortality  for  persons  with ASD  than  for  the 
general  population  (mortality  general  population 
0.91% versus persons with ASD 2.60%), with mortal-
ity increased in almost all causal diagnostic categories 
(34). 

This  illustrates  the  urgent  need  for  specific  treat-

ments and support for adults with ASD.

Conclusions
The estimated global median prevalence of ASD is 1%. 
The  diagnosis  is  still  made  clinically,  by  using 
 standardized instruments. The treatment comprises pri-
marily psychotherapeutic interventions. The prognosis 
in adults with ASD with regard to gainful employment 
and development of partner relationships is associated 
with limitations; mortality is higher than in the general 
population.

Conflict of interest statement 
The authors declare that no conflict of interest exists.
