Abstract
Inuit in Canada have among the highest suicide rates in the world, and it is primarily among their youth. Risk factors include known
ones such as depression, substance use, a history of abuse, and knowing others who have made attempts or have killed themselves,
however of importance are the negative effects of colonialism. This took place for Inuit primarily during the government era starting
in the 1950s, when Inuit were moved from their family-based land camps to crowded settlements run by white men, and children
were removed from their parents and placed into residential or day schools. This caused more disorganization than reorganization.
The most negative effect of this colonialism/imperialism for Inuit has been on their family and sexual relationships. Many Inuit youth
feel alone and rejected. Suicide prevention has been taking place, the most successful being community-driven programs developed
and run by Inuit. Mental health factors for Indigenous peoples are often cultural. It is recommended that practitioners work with the
community and with Inuit organizations. Empowered communities can be healing.

Abre´ ge´
Les Inuits du Canada de´tiennent des taux de suicide parmi les plus e´leve´s du monde, et ce, principalement chez les jeunes. Les
facteurs de risque sont notamment les facteurs connus comme la de´pression, l’utilisation de substances, des ante´ce´dents de
violence, et le fait de connaıˆtre d’autres personnes qui ont tente´ de se suicider ou qui se sont enleve´ la vie, quelle que soit
l’importance des effets ne´gatifs du colonialisme. Celui-ci a eu lieu pour les Inuits surtout a` l’e´poque du gouvernement des
anne´es 1950, quand les Inuits ont e´te´ de´place´s de leurs campements familiaux vers des re´serves surpeuple´es dirige´es par des
hommes blancs, et que les enfants ont e´te´ arrache´s a` leurs parents et place´s dans des pensionnats et des externats. Cela a
cause´ plus de de´sorganisation que de re´organisation. L’effet le plus ne´faste de ce colonialisme/impe´rialisme pour les Inuits s’est
fait sentir sur leurs relations familiales et sexuelles. Nombre de jeunes Inuits se sentent seuls et rejete´s. Des interventions de
pre´vention du suicide ont pris place, les plus re´ussies e´tant des programmes communautaires e´labore´s et fournis par des
Inuits. Les facteurs de sante´ mentale pour les personnes autochtones sont souvent culturels. Il est recommande´ que les
praticiens collaborent avec la communaute´ et les organisations Inuits. Des communaute´s habilite´es peuvent eˆtre gue´risseuses.

historical trauma.19-22 Prussing23 shows empirical evidence
supporting historical trauma behind negative mental health
outcomes of Indigenous peoples, including depression,
substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The
historical traumas for Inuit have resulted from such factors
as residential or boarding schools16 and forced lifestyle
changes. Million24 refers to residential schools as ‘‘coloni-
zation as abuse.’’ Identities and family relationships were
dramatically changed by historical traumas. While much of
the damage was done through assimilation policy, it also
occurred as a by-product of colonial expansion and expro-
priation.25 Much of this was documented in the 1996
Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples
in Canada. Some of this trauma has been passed down
generations through altered parenting, domestic violence,
and language loss.26,27 In healing, which will be discussed
later, individual responsibility is important even while his-
torical and current forces of injustice are acknowledged.28

The Inuit People in Canada: Who Are They?

Inuit in Canada have been subject to imperialism and colo-
nialism that have greatly affected their lives. Inuit constitute
about 5% of Indigenous peoples in Canada, totaling a little
over 50,000 people according to the 2006 Canada Census,
and live in the 4 regions called Inuvialuit, Nunavut, Nunavik,
and Nunatsiavut. Archaeologists have found evidence of life
on the island of Igloolik, Nunavut, 4000 years ago.29 The
first Indigenous people in the Canadian Arctic were the
Dorset, replaced about 1000 years ago by the Thule people,
from whom Inuit are descended. The first significant wave of
outsiders were whalers from Scotland and the United States,
from the mid-19th century to about 1920. These whalers
employed Inuit to help them, giving them flour, tobacco,
guns, and small boats. Many Inuit moved to be near the
ships, and disease took many Inuit lives. The next wave has
been called the ‘‘trinity’’: missionaries, the Hudson Bay fur
company, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. This
took place from about the 1920s to the 1950s. Some large
cultural changes happened because of this wave: Shamans or
traditional healers went underground after relatively rapid
conversion to Christianity,30 and sexual practice moved from
spouse exchange, which was practiced across the Arctic as
the exchange of partners for sex, to monogamy.31 Women
stopped tattooing their faces. Yet Inuit continued to live in
family camps on the land where they hunted and moved
seasonally. More diseases such as tuberculosis took many
Inuit lives in the 1950s. The great imperial/colonial event for
Inuit, however, was what Wenzel32 called the ‘‘government
era.’’ This took place between the 1950s and 1970s, as the
Canadian government took control over Inuit lives. Inuit
were moved from their land camps, where they had resided
for the previous 1000 years, to crowded settlements run by
white government Northern Service Officers. The children
were taken away to residential or day schools, and much
sexual abuse took place in some of the Catholic residential

schools. Children were taught that their parents and grand-
parents were inferior role models. Gender roles changed for
men, who as hunters had been providers; now many of the
men worked for the white government, collecting garbage
and so on. Prestige for men shifted from being the best
hunter to having the highest income, and a class system
developed.33 A split was created between Inuit who lived
in the settlement and those who still lived on the land. A
wage economy was started, and with very few jobs, poverty
was created. The move to settlement life was one of more
disorganization than reorganization, a breakdown of what
Damas34 referred to as networks of cooperation, a weaken-
ing of communication patterns and values.35 Inuit feared the
Qallunaat or White men.36 Inuit felt there were ‘‘too many
Kabloona (White) bosses.’’37

In my research, I have found that older Inuit believe that
their social problems began when they were moved to the
settlements. The ‘‘government era’’ was the most hurried and
extreme event in Inuit history. The most negative effect of
the rapid culture change has been on relationships, particu-
larly family and sexual relationships. This is serious for a
family-based collectivist culture. Studies have found that
family change has been the most negative repercussion of
colonialism for Indigenous peoples.8,38 Kinship has been the
foundation of Inuit social organization.39,40 Relationships
across generations were especially strong, as one’s parents
and grandparents were one’s teachers and mentors. This is
true for Indigenous peoples more generally,38 and Sahlins41
refers to this as a mutuality of being, where ‘‘kinsmen are
members of one another. Their mutuality may be a sameness
of being.’’ Arranged marriage was the Inuit tradition; how-
ever, when the first children who were sent to the schools
came of age, they were the first generation to forego
arranged marriage. At the time, most asked their parents for
permission to marry the person of their choice,42 but later
this stopped as the North American model of love, based on
individualism and choice, came to be practiced.43 Graburn44
identified what he called ‘‘the marriage problem’’ in the late
1950s and early 1960s related to change in the practice of
arranged marriage. Alcohol was causing problems among
couples, the children now grown who had been placed in
the residential and day schools, and the problems included
domestic violence.45 Brody46 and O’Neil47 found much
anger among young couples in the 1970s. In the early set-
tlements, a new and large adolescent peer group began to
distance itself from parents,33,48 forming a new youth cul-
ture. The large number of people in the settlements meant
that the family was less often considered the centre of life.49
Parenting has changed dramatically, and today many chil-
dren and their parents spend very little time together.

This gives a very brief account of the social perturbation
experienced by Inuit since the government era, and suicide
must be understood through the perturbation behind it.
Other issues include most Inuit not finishing high school,
the very high proportion of children under the age of 15,
and higher infant mortality and lower life expectancy than

the Canadian average. Life expectancy for Inuit for
2004-2008 was 67.7 years for Inuit men and 72.8 years for
Inuit women, compared with 77.5 years for men and
81.3 years for women in Canada.50 Unemployment is
extremely high, as is poverty, and there is a housing shortage,
such that the houses are very crowded. The suicides began in
the mid-1980s; the children of those who went to the residen-
tial and day schools began to kill themselves, and the suicide
rate continues to increase. In Nunavut, the suicide rate
between 1999 and 2003 was 122.4 per 100,000, which is
10 times that of Canada.51 The highest suicide rate was in
2013, with 46 suicides in Nunavut. Very few suicides were
recorded before 1980; however, Balikci52 reported Netsilik
suicides prior to 1970 across the age span, which was unusual
because Inuit suicides were traditionally among the elderly,
perhaps those who were sick or during times of famine. These
were altruistic suicides, whereas Balikci indicates that the
suicides he found were Durkheimian egoistic suicides, ones
following a sense of not belonging, of social alienation. In
Nunavut, Chachamovich53 found that almost half of the sui-
cides entailed depression and 21% were linked to alcohol
abuse. An earlier study found alcohol abuse among 46% of
Inuit suicides.54 Kirmayer et al.55 found the lifetime preva-
lence of suicidal ideation to be 43% and suicide attempts to be
34% among Inuit, with males having higher rates of attempts
and completion.

Suicides among Inuit thus involve some known risk fac-
tors, such as depression and substance abuse, parental sub-
stance abuse, physical abuse, recent life events, and suicide
or attempts among friends.55 Most studies of Inuit mental
health focus on substance abuse and suicide.56 Yet the colo-
nial effect has disrupted Inuit lives and may be behind some
of the other risk factors. Many youth feel alone and unloved
and are angry with their parents and their girlfriends or boy-
friends.57 This demonstrates the change in relationships,
especially family relationships, following the government
era. Kral58 found that 68% of suicides in 2 Inuit communities
were precipitated by a romantic relationship breakup, and
20% of people who committed suicide had a pending court
appearance, usually for break-ins or selling drugs. A number
of Inuit male youth threaten their girlfriends with suicide,
and sometimes their parents, and then carry out the act. Is
suicide also a form of revenge? Many Inuit youth lack a
healthy cultural model of love and sexuality. The romantic
relationship problems described decades ago by Burch,45
Graburn,44 Brody,46 and O’Neil47 may have become worse
today and are behind most of the suicides. Inuit living in
Nunavut are aware of this problem in romantic and parent-
child relationships. Inuit youth need guidance and mentoring
through this process.

Intervention and Prevention of Suicide
among Inuit
Harder et al.3 reviewed the research on Indigenous youth
suicide and found that risk factors included depression,

conduct disorders, substance and alcohol abuse, psychiatric
disorders, male sex, and having a friend who had attempted
suicide. Social and family support were found to be the most
protective factors for mental health. Also protective for men-
tal health was having a continuous sense of self and iden-
tity59 and having a connection with one’s culture, which
included engaging in culturally relevant activities with
respected others in the community such as elders. Factors
that are protective of mental health for Indigenous people are
often cultural. Gone60 refers to ‘‘culture as mental health
treatment’’ for Indigenous peoples, showing that it has
become common for mental health agencies serving Indi-
genous North Americans to conduct sweat lodges, talking
circles, pipe ceremonies, and smudging as well as other trib-
ally specific cultural practices. Gone finds that the therapeu-
tic mechanisms include those found in psychotherapy
research, including the therapeutic relationship and alliance,
empathy, and, in this case, cultural participation that sup-
ports Indigenous identification.

Suicide prevention programs have been attempted among
Inuit. Among the Yup’ik (Inuit people) of Alaska, a
community-based program for prevention of suicide and
alcohol abuse met with much community support. Allen
et al.61 showed that the Yup’ik community supported a pro-
gram that was designed by community members and univer-
sity researchers in collaboration. The program included
listening to elders for advice and youth travelling on the river
ice with their families. For Inuit, being on the land is heal-
ing62 and is a form of building resilience among youth.63 The
most important factor in Inuit youth resilience is talking to
friends and family members. Family was found to be the
most significant factor in Inuit well-being in one study, fol-
lowed by talking/communication and practicing cultural
activities.64 The Canadian government spent much money
in the late 1990s on training Inuit in Western suicide pre-
vention, but the rates continued to rise. Research shows that
evidence-based mental health programs do not work well
with North American minority populations,65-67 including
suicide prevention with Indigenous peoples.68 What do
appear to work are community-based programs such as the
one in Alaska.61 Some Inuit communities have put together
their own suicide prevention activities and programs, and
suicides have declined significantly.51,57 These are
community-driven programs, such as the Youth Centre that
was organized by a youth group in Igloolik, Nunavut. Health
Canada now has the National Aboriginal Youth Suicide Pre-
vention Strategy,69 which was developed in partnership with
Aboriginal organizations; with this program, communities
are funded to develop their own suicide prevention pro-
grams. Over 200 communities and organizations have been
funded at this time. This is a form of sovereignty on the
ground, part of Indigenous reclamation of control over their
lives called indigenism, the global Indigenous human rights
movement.70 Middlebrook et al.71 conclude that for suicide
prevention to be effective in Indigenous communities, the
communities must be directly involved. This is the self-

determination that is important in mental health, and Inuit
are making strides with this process. Signs of renewal are
alive among Inuit.72

Culture as healing is not the only intervention for Indi-
genous peoples. Many agencies, organizations, and commu-
nities have successfully combined Western and traditional
interventions, such as the Youth Centre in Igloolik. Gone73
showed how such an integrated method was successful in a
substance abuse treatment centre in a northern Manitoba
First Nations community. The program included counseling
sessions and field trips, powwow dances, pipe ceremonies,
and a fasting camp. Such integration of Western and tradi-
tional healing has been efficacious in other Indigenous com-
munities.74-77 A cultural approach, community ownership,
and collaboration were important factors in another native
substance abuse program.78 Community control over
resources is important for Indigenous suicide prevention.79
Indigenous cultural essentialism is to be avoided, and the use
of traditional healing is constantly evolving. How is such
integration of interventions to be accomplished?

Health research funders for Indigenous peoples have
established community collaboration and participation as a
research ethical principle.80-83 The Canadian Institutes for
Health Research (CIHR) has a Citizen Engagement Branch
that requests the participation of the general public; consu-
mers of health services, patients, caregivers, advocates, and
community representatives are to be involved in research
and program planning. The CIHR Pathways to Health Equity
for Aboriginal Peoples includes suicide prevention as a pri-
ority area. Collaboration means seeing expertise in the
Indigenous community and working with it. It is, according
to CIHR,80 ‘‘the building [of] reciprocal, trusting relation-
ships . . .
in a spirit of respect.’’ In a review of suicide
prevention programs for Aboriginal communities in Austra-
lia, Ridani et al.84 found that community-based approaches
that emphasize connectedness, belongingness, and culture
heritage are beneficial.

There is now good evidence that community-based parti-
cipatory research is important for the development of inter-
vention and prevention programs in health and mental
health.85-91 This entails the involvement of community mem-
bers in the design and running of these programs. Fostering
strong family connectedness, providing social support, and
using community-based and community-run programs are
important for Indigenous suicide prevention.92,93

Many Inuit live in urban areas in southern Canada.
According to Tomiak and Patrick,94 17% of Inuit live in
southern cities. Ottawa has the most Inuit, about 3000, and
the proportion of Inuit in Ottawa increased to 64% between
2006 and 2011.95 Some 5000 Inuit live in cities in southern
Canada.96 Ottawa has several Inuit agencies, including Tun-
gasuvvingat Inuit community centre with a Family Resource
Centre and the Ottawa Inuit Children’s Centre. As in the
North, urban Inuit have lower rates of employment and edu-
cational attainment. They report low levels of support for
their parenting, and they experience poverty, housing

shortages, linguistic barriers, and racial discrimination.96,97
Ottawa has subsidized Inuit housing in the area of Vanier,
and some Inuit are homeless.98 Yet Inuit there feel part of an
Inuit community, having a sense of unity.96

What is the practicing psychiatrist to do about suicidal
Inuit? Gone99 suggests that practitioners should consider
the distress of Indigenous peoples as symptomatic of unre-
solved intergenerational grief and historical trauma and
should incorporate cultural identity into treatment. He also
recommends collaborating with community members and
Indigenous agencies. In Ottawa, for example, this could
mean working with the Tungasuvvingat Inuit Family
Resource Centre, incorporating their suggestions as well
as referring patients to this centre. Working with Inuit fam-
ilies may also be beneficial, given the importance of kin-
ship for Inuit mental health. It will be important for
clinicians to think about Inuit life and culture and to incor-
porate this into any treatment.

Suicide among Inuit has taken place in the context of the
negative colonial repercussions of many Indigenous peo-
ples. Many are manifesting risk factors and mental disor-
ders, and their relational bond, ungajuk, or sense of
belonging, ilagijauttiarniq, has been disrupted. Family and
romantic problems have resulted, and suicides are tied to
these problems. The message of this paper is that we should
work with communities to provide intervention and preven-
tion programs. Such programs may combine traditional and
Western interventions, and the community must feel a
sense of control over the process. The empowerment of
communities is the goal,100 with the community having the
role of teacher.101 This will require collaboration with com-
munity members and leaders. It is a form of community,
cultural, and public psychiatry.102-105 It can also be called a
public health psychiatry, one that highlights community
engagement and prevention.
