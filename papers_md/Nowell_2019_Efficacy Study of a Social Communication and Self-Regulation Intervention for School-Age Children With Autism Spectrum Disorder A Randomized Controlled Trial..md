Efficacy Study of a Social Communication
and Self-Regulation Intervention
for School-Age Children With Autism
Spectrum Disorder: A Randomized
Controlled Trial

Sallie W. Nowell,a Linda R. Watson,b Brian Boyd,c and Laura G. Klingerd

Purpose: This study aimed to examine the initial efficacy of
a parent-assisted blended intervention combining components
of Structured TEACCHing and Social Thinking, designed to
increase social communication and self-regulation concept
knowledge in 1st and 2nd graders (n = 17) diagnosed with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their parents.
Method: A randomized delayed treatment control group
design with pre- and postintervention assessments of both
parents and children was implemented within a community
practice setting. Two follow-up assessments at 3 and
6 months postintervention were also completed.
Results: Overall, results indicate that the intervention is
efficacious in teaching social communication and self-
regulation concept knowledge to children with ASD and
their parents. Both parents and children demonstrated an

increase in social communication and self-regulation
knowledge after participating in the Growing, Learning,
and Living With Autism Group as compared to a delayed
treatment control group. The effects of the intervention did
not extend to parent–child interactions coded from video
recordings. Child treatment effects were maintained at the
3- and 6-month follow-up assessments.
Conclusions: Preliminary efficacy of the Growing, Learning,
and Living With Autism Group was established. Based
on parent report at the conclusion of the intervention,
this is a socially valid intervention for teaching social
communication and self-regulation skills to school-age
children with ASD.

I n the United States, current prevalence rates of au-

tism spectrum disorder (ASD) are reported between
one in 40 and one in 59 children (Baio et al., 2018;

Kogan et al., 2018). Nearly half of children with ASD have
average to above average cognitive ability (Christensen,
2016); yet, their adult outcomes are poor when compared
to peers with typical development (Dijkhuis, Ziermans,

Rutter, 2013) and peers with ASD who have below average
cognitive ability (Mordre et al., 2012). Autism symptom
severity, adaptive functioning, and exposure to early inter-
vention are all more predictive of positive adult outcomes
in ASD than cognitive ability alone (Anderson, Liang, &
Lord, 2014; Gray et al., 2014). Though average to above
average cognition increases the chances that an individual
with ASD will be employed, these individuals are less
likely to be involved in activities outside their homes than
their peers with lower cognitive skills (Taylor & Seltzer,
2011). Social communication and self-regulation are skill
areas in which individuals with ASD struggle. Social com-
munication deficits have been shown to negatively affect
academic performance (Welsh, Parke, Widaman, & O’Neil,
2001), be associated with psychiatric conditions like anxiety

and depression (Barnhill, 2001), and affect friendship and
employment outcomes in adulthood (Howlin et al., 2013).
Self-regulation deficits, specifically emotion regulation and
executive functioning difficulties, negatively impact engage-
ment in academic and social settings for children (Jahromi,
Bryce, & Swanson, 2013) and are correlated with self-
reports of lower quality of life compared to non-ASD peers
in young adulthood (Dijkhuis et al., 2016). Thus, there is
a need for interventions targeting social communication
and self-regulation in school-age children with ASD with
average or above average cognitive skills with the long-
term goal of improving adult quality of life outcomes.

Group interventions are common practice for target-

ing social communication goals in children with “high-
functioning” ASD (i.e., those with average to above average
cognitive abilities, including structural language skills in
the average range, but varying levels of autism symptom-
atology), but evidence for the efficacy of these groups has been
mixed (Rao, Beidel, & Murray, 2008). In 2010, Reichow
and Volkmar completed a review of social skills group in-
tervention studies for school-age children with ASD and
concluded that social skills groups met criteria (based on
Reichow, Volkmar, & Cicchetti, 2008) to be considered
an evidence-based practice for ASD.

It has been argued that cognitive behavioral therapy
approaches to teaching social communication skills, com-
monly referred to as social cognitive interventions, are more
effective than behavioral approaches for children with
high-functioning ASD because they teach social problem-
solving skills that can be used to change behavior flexibly
across contexts, rather than learning fixed social rules
(Crooke, Winner, & Olswang, 2016). For instance, head
nodding is a prosocial behavior that indicates that one is
listening to a communication partner. However, it is so-
cially appropriate to stop nodding and even look away
from a communication partner if they talk for too long or
say something with which one does not agree. A behav-
ioral approach may simply reward the child for nodding
while someone else is talking (note that this may be an
appropriate approach for a child with less social commu-
nication competence), whereas a social cognitive approach
that teaches why and how to use prosocial behaviors such
as nodding may be best for a high-functioning child who is
held to the same social standards as typically developing
peers. Bauminger (2007) conducted a 7-month school-based
social cognitive intervention with a group of children with
high-functioning ASD. Though the intervention effectively
improved the children’s social cognition skills (i.e., ability
to define and recognize emotions, social situations, and
constructs; better understanding of others; and improved
awareness of others), these effects did not generalize to
peer interactions. A major limitation of this study was that
it did not include a control group. In a randomized controlled
trial of a social cognitive intervention in a clinic setting with
children with high-functioning ASD, Lopata et al. (2010)
found treatment effects on social skills knowledge and under-
standing of nonliteral language. Furthermore, parent report
measures indicated an increase in social skills and a decrease

is withdrawal behaviors. Thus, there seems to be preliminary
evidence for social cognitive approaches to teaching social
communication skills to school-age children with high-func-
tioning ASD. Moreover, there are several evidence-based
practices that are used consistently by clinicians during
social cognitive interventions to improve social communica-
tion skills, including visual supports, modeling, reinforce-
ment, scripting, social skills training, structured play groups,
social narratives, and video modeling (Wong et al., 2015).
A blend of these practices or key ingredients may be essen-
tial to the success of social cognitive interventions.

Interventions targeting self-regulation have been

found to be efficacious for children with attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (Reid, Trout, & Schartz, 2005) and
learning disabilities (Reid, 1996) and have shown emerging
evidence for groups of children with ASD (e.g., Stoesz,
Montgomery, & MacKenzie, 2013). Though both social
communication and self-regulation are skill areas that pre-
dict outcomes for children with high-functioning ASD
and interventions targeting these skills have a promising
evidence base, we have identified no research on interven-
tions addressing both of these skill areas in high-functioning
school-age children. The purpose of this study is to examine
the initial efficacy of an existing parent-assisted community
intervention for school-age children with ASD that targets
both self-regulation and social communication skills.

When establishing efficacy for an intervention pro-

gram, it is important to remember that the extent to which
participants are satisfied with their intervention experience
has a significant impact on whether or not that interven-
tion is adopted and implemented (Kazdin, 1977). Just
because an intervention demonstrates efficacy on outcome
measures does not mean that it is appropriate or feasible
in “real-world” contexts (S. L. Carter, 2010). Social valid-
ity is broadly defined as participant satisfaction with inter-
vention procedures, goals, and outcomes (Wolf, 1978). It
has been argued that autism treatments cannot be consid-
ered truly evidence based without establishing social validity
(Callahan et al., 2016), and therefore, this was an addi-
tional aim of the study.

The Growing, Learning, and Living
With Autism Group

The purpose of the Growing, Learning, and Living

With Autism (GoriLLA) Group at the Chapel Hill TEACCH
Autism Center is to equip children diagnosed with ASD and
their parents with self-regulation and social communication
concept knowledge that can be applied throughout their daily
routines. The GoriLLA Group intervention package is a
blend of two widely used and complementary approaches:
(a) Structured TEACCHing (Klinger, Klinger, & Pohlig,
2007; Mesibov, Shea, & Schopler, 2005; Schopler, Lansing,
& Waters, 1983) and (b) components from the Social Think-
ing methodology (Hendrix, Palmer, Tarshis, & Winner,
2013; Winner & Crooke, 2009), specifically the five Social
Thinking concepts from We Thinkers! Volume 1: Social
Explorers (Hendrix et al., 2013; formerly named The

Nowell et al.: Efficacy of SC and SR Intervention 417

Incredible Flexible You) curriculum and components
from the Zones of Regulation curriculum (Kuypers, 2011).
This small group intervention is parent assisted, mean-
ing that parents are active participants in the groups,
and complete weekly homework activities with their
children to increase generalization of skills. Parents who
have participated in previous GoriLLA Groups anecdot-
ally report increased use and effectiveness of the inter-
vention strategies at home, and the demand for the
program is high. However, the efficacy of this interven-
tion has yet to be studied within the context of a con-
trolled trial.

The essential elements of Structured TEACCHing

are as follows: (a) structure the environment to make activ-
ities understandable, (b) use strengths in visual skills to
supplement weaker skills, (c) use special interests to pro-
mote engagement in learning, and (d) support self-initiated
meaningful communication (Mesibov & Shea, 2010). These
four Structured TEACCHing elements provide the frame-
work on which the GoriLLA Group is built. Activities are
environmentally structured such that tasks flow from left
to right and the duration of the task, end of the task, and
next task are always clear to participants. All activities in-
clude visual supports. For example, pictures of a flower
and a candle are used to visually support inhalation and
exhalation during deep breathing exercises and chair yoga
practice. Special interests are incorporated into activities,
when appropriate, to increase engagement. For instance,
the clinician may use an example from a child’s favorite
TV show if that child is not paying attention. Finally, spon-
taneous social communication skills such as asking questions
of others and head nodding are formally and informally
supported throughout the sessions. For example, the chil-
dren formally identify these skills in themselves using video
feedback, but the clinician may also informally label a
spontaneous comment that a parent made during the group.
The TEACCH model encourages parent-assisted inter-

vention to support generalization of clinic-taught skills to
daily routines across natural environments (Van Bourgondien
& Coonrod, 2013); therefore, parents are active participants
in the GoriLLA Group intervention. Though early behav-
ioral interventions for children with ASD often employ
parent coaching or parent-mediated approaches (see Nevill,
Lecavalier, & Stratis, 2018, for meta-analysis), the literature
on parent involvement in interventions for older children
with ASD is sparse. Frankel et al. (2010) tested a social
cognitive intervention called the parent-assisted chil-
dren’s friendship training program with children with high-
functioning ASD using a randomized delayed treatment
control group design. They found significant time by group
effects on parent measures of social skills and play date
behavior and child measures of popularity and loneliness
after the 12-week intervention. The same research group
(Laugeson, Frankel, Gantman, Dillon, & Mogil, 2012;
Laugeson, Frankel, Mogil, & Dillon, 2009) used a parent-
assisted model called PEERS to teach social competence
skills to adolescents with high-functioning ASD and found
improvements on parent report measures. The parent-assisted

nature of their PEERS treatment was hypothesized to con-
tribute to the maintenance of adolescents’ treatment gains
seen on social measures 1–5 years after the intervention
(Mandelberg, Frankel, Cunningham, Gorospe, & Laugeson,
2014). In a home-based observational study of emotion
self-regulation in 30- to 48-month-old children with ASD,
Laurent and Gorman (2018) found that parents matched
their behavior to their child’s developmental level and used
more behaviors consistent with parents of typically devel-
oping 2-year-olds; greater use of these parent behaviors
(i.e., physical engagement, helping, redirection, and physi-
cal comfort) was then associated with better child social
communication competence, but not child sensory process-
ing competence. Considering prior positive treatment out-
comes found in parent-mediated interventions for toddlers
with ASD (Gulsrud, Jahromi, & Kasari, 2010), implement-
ing an intervention of this type for elementary school–age
children with ASD should improve their social communica-
tion and self-regulation concept knowledge in these areas.

Social Thinking is a therapeutic, cognitive-based meth-

odology composed of several curricula, frameworks, and
strategies. The focus of the methodology is to build social
concepts and social cognitive knowledge for competencies
in understanding and using social behaviors (Crooke
et al., 2016; Winner, 2013). This methodology establishes
the awareness needed to adapt behavior and flexibly meet
social expectations across contexts and communication
partners (Crooke et al., 2016). Social Thinking components
are blended into the Structured TEACCHing framework to
create the GoriLLA Group program because they provide
a way to make abstract social concepts concrete for those
learners who may not infer meaning in language easily. In
this way, the visual and environmental supports of Structured
TEACCHing lend themselves easily to the concrete elements
of Social Thinking (e.g., holding up drawings of thought
bubbles to make the thoughts of others more salient). The
We Thinkers! Volume 1 curriculum is designed for high-
functioning social learners from preschool to early elemen-
tary school, and therefore, the vocabulary and activities are
appropriate for the young school-age children served by the
GoriLLA Group. Furthermore, the Social Thinking vocab-
ulary is “portable” in that it uses language-based strategies
that can travel with the child and the parent across social
environments, which promotes generalization. Emotion vo-
cabulary and self-regulation are known to be challenging for
children with ASD (Laurent & Rubin, 2004). For this reason,
sections of the widely used self-regulation curriculum from
Social Thinking, the Zones of Regulation (Kuypers, 2011),
are embedded in the GoriLLA Group intervention. Com-
ponents of the Social Thinking methodology, including the
Zones of Regulation, are popular and widely used for chil-
dren with ASD but do not have an established evidence
base. Moreover, there is a need for parent-assisted interven-
tions that tackle social cognitive concepts and self-regulation
in community settings for children with ASD. In fact,
very few randomized controlled trials have been conducted
with this type of social cognitive intervention package
for young children and even fewer examining the role of

Method

Participants in this study were 17 children diagnosed

with ASD and their parents (see participant demographics
in Table 1). To be included, the children had to (a) have a
medical diagnosis of ASD documented from The University
of North Carolina TEACCH Autism Program or another
clinic based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, 5th Edition criteria (American Psychiatric Associ-
ation, 2013) supported by an Autism Diagnostic Observation
Schedule (ADOS; Lord et al., 2012) and clinical parent in-
terview, (b) be included 80%–100% of the time in a first- or
second-grade regular education classroom, (c) read on a
first-grade level or above (based on parent report and/or
Individualized Education Plan), and (d) be able to tolerate
separation from their parents for up to 30 min. In addition,
parents and children had to be fluent English speakers. In-
clusion in 80%–100% of the school day was used as a proxy
of (a) readiness to participate in a group treatment program
and (b) cognitive ability to comprehend program material.
Reading on grade level was a necessary inclusion criterion
because concepts and vocabulary are presented at a first-
grade level and worksheets and visuals for the group require
first-grade literacy skills. Four families were bilingual, but all
parents reported that English was their child’s strongest lan-
guage. Though all children had a documented diagnosis of
ASD, only five children in this sample met the ASD cutoff
score of ≥ 15 on the Social Communication Questionnaire
(SCQ; Rutter, Bailey, & Lord, 2003) at the preintervention
assessment. Validation studies of the SCQ found that this
cut-point is less valid for use with children under the age of
7.5 years than for older individuals (Barnard-Brak, Brewer,
Chesnut, Richman, & Schaeffer, 2016; Lee, David, Rusyniak,

Landa, & Newschaffer, 2007) and that the SCQ is more sen-
sitive to children with lower cognitive and adaptive skills than
high-functioning children (Snow & Lecavalier, 2008). Further-
more, the SCQ is a screening tool and is not meant for diag-
nostic purposes like the ADOS. For these reasons, the
child’s original diagnosis using the ADOS was considered
more valid than the SCQ, and children who did not meet
SCQ criteria were still included in the study.

After randomization, the study groups (interven-

tion: n = 8; control: n = 10) were evenly matched on age,
t(16) = 0.62, p ≤ .73, and sex, χ2(1, 18) = 0.06, p ≤ .80.
Parents of children randomized to the delayed treatment
control group reported significantly fewer symptoms of
ASD on the SCQ, t(15) = –2.08, p ≤ .03, than parents of
the children in the intervention group. Race, ethnicity,
and parent education levels were not significantly differ-
ent between the groups.

Parents were asked to report interventions that their
child was currently receiving and had received from birth
to the start of the study. Children’s current treatment goals
overwhelmingly focused on social communication skills
and pragmatic language. Some children were also receiving
occupational therapy for handwriting or additional speech-
language therapy for fluency disorders. All of the children
had prestudy exposure to “social skills” instruction either
in a group or individual setting, most often with a speech-
language pathologist but occasionally with an occupational
therapist or psychologist. Parents reported that seven of
the children had been exposed to the Zones of Regulation
curriculum and eight of the children had previous or current
exposure to other components of the Social Thinking meth-
odology; in all but one case, if a child was exposed to one of
these curricula, he was also exposed to the other. Twenty-
five percent of the intervention group and 60% of the de-
layed treatment control group had previous exposure to
these curricula. Intervention dosage of Social Thinking and
the Zones of Regulation was highly variable as reported by
parents. Some parents reported that Social Thinking con-
cepts like “Whole Body Listening” along with non–Social
Thinking concepts were used in an intervention, while
other parents reported using vocabulary or following weekly
lessons from one or more components of the Social Think-
ing methodology. Furthermore, some parents did not pro-
vide an Individualized Education Plan or report details of
their child’s school intervention, so it is possible that some
of the school interventions also used these curricula.

Procedure

A randomized delayed treatment control group de-
sign was used to address the study aims. A recruitment
letter was mailed to parents of children on the clinic wait-
list for the GoriLLA Group (n = 37). Families from the
waitlist were given 2 weeks to respond to the letter or a fol-
low-up phone call before an e-mail announcing study re-
cruitment was sent to the clinic listserv of the Chapel Hill
TEACCH Center to fill the remaining participant openings
(approximately 2,800 e-mail addresses). The first author

screened parents by phone (n = 36) to see if they and their
children met minimum study inclusion criteria before invit-
ing them for an assessment. See Figure 1 for a flow chart
of study recruitment and retention.

Assessments took place at pre- and postintervention
and two follow-up visits, 3 and 6 months postintervention,
at the Chapel Hill TEACCH Center. At each 60- to 90-min
assessment, parent and child intervention strategy knowl-
edge was tested and a 15-min parent–child play interaction,
assessing application of strategies, was completed. Partici-
pants were given $25 for each assessment; thus, they were
compensated up to $100 for this study. The first author
and the GoriLLA Group clinicians administered all of the
preintervention assessments prior to randomization. Asses-
sors for the postintervention and follow-up assessments came
from a pool of five master’s students in speech-language pa-
thology who were blind to the family’s group allocation.

Our recruitment goal was to have 16 families partici-
pate in the study, as four families per group was considered
optimal by the clinicians; however, to account for possible
attrition during the delayed treatment period, two additional
families were overrecruited to the delayed treatment control
group. A sample size of 18 families was the largest sample
size deemed feasible for the study, given the constraints of
the clinical program. A total of 19 families completed
pretreatment assessments. Eighteen of the 19 families met
study inclusion criteria based on the preintervention assess-
ment. These 18 families were randomized in blocks of nine

to ensure equal chance of group membership in either the
intervention GoriLLA Groups or the delayed treatment
control groups (eight families randomized to the interven-
tion group; 10 to the control group). Two groups of four
families ran concurrently in the spring with the delayed treat-
ment groups receiving their services as usual in the commu-
nity while waiting to participate in the GoriLLA Group in
the fall. The 3- and 6-month follow-up visits for the inter-
vention groups in the fall served as the pre- and post-
intervention assessments for the delayed treatment groups
who received the GoriLLA intervention between these
assessment time points.

Participants were seen for the study using the same

HIPAA-compliant clinical procedures used at the Chapel Hill
TEACCH Center. Intervention sessions were billed as psycho-
therapy groups as part of standard clinic practices. GoriLLA
Groups met for 90 min weekly, and sessions consisted of
parent–child large and small group activities targeting social
communication and self-regulation (see session content sum-
maries in Table 2). Weekly 20- to 30-min parent breakout
sessions consisted of (a) review of the previous week’s home-
work, (b) discussion of the current week’s concept and brain-
storming how to practice at home, (c) group behavior problem
solving for one family, (d) discussion of what the children are
doing and how to support them in the upcoming parent–child
activity, and (e) assignment of “homework” for the week.

The intervention was delivered by teams of two

trained clinicians with master’s degrees, assisted by a clinical

psychology doctoral student or postdoctoral research fel-
low. Fidelity was monitored via video recordings of each
session; adherence checklists were monitored by the princi-
pal investigator, and deviations were discussed with the
clinical team at weekly meetings. Overall, clinician quality
and behavior management ratings were recorded by re-
search assistants to obtain an objective measure of the
quality of intervention implementation and behavior man-
agement in each session. These ratings were assigned from
video recordings once the intervention was completed. Par-
ents completed homework exercises and maintained a log of
strategies that they used each week. The core GoriLLA
Group strategies and concepts that were tested at pre-
and postassessments and logged each week by parents can
be viewed in Table 3.

All study procedures were reviewed and approved by

the institutional review board at the The University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. Informed parental consent was
obtained for all participants in the study. If children were
over the age of 7 years, they assented to their participation
in the study.

aStarting with Session #3, all sessions begin with snack and arrival worksheet (e.g., word search of group concepts), Get to Green GoriLLA
Plan, Zones Check-In, and vocabulary review. All sessions end with Get to Green GoriLLA Plan, Zones Check-In, Spotlight Friend, and Prizes.
These activities are described where they are introduced in Sessions 1 and 2 above.

descriptions; full measure available upon request). The COP
was developed by the GoriLLA Group clinicians to assess
GoriLLA Group concept and vocabulary knowledge, and
it was administered at all assessment time points. Children
were seated across from an examiner and asked to follow
a visual schedule as they progressed through materials
for each task. Items were scored on a 0–3 scale, with 3 in-
dicating mastery of the concept; total scores ranged from
0 to 66. A total score was used as the primary outcome
measure for children in the study.

To elucidate the effectiveness of the three major in-

tervention components of the GoriLLA Group, COP items
were divided into three theoretically based subscales: Social
Thinking, Self-Regulation, and Social Communication.
The Social Thinking subscale included core concepts and

vocabulary from one component of the Social Thinking
methodology, We Thinkers! Volume 1 (Hendrix et al.,
2013). One additional Social Thinking vocabulary–concept
pair (i.e., expected and unexpected behaviors) from the
We Thinkers! Volume 2: Social Explorers curriculum guide
(Hendrix, Palmer, Tarshis, & Winner, 2016) was intro-
duced in Session 1. Items included in the Social Thinking
subscale were Expected Versus Unexpected Behavior, the
Group Plan, Body in the Group, Thinking With Your
Eyes, Whole Body Listening, and Labeling Thoughts/
Feelings of Others. The Self-Regulation subscale included
select concepts and vocabulary from the Zones of Regulation
curriculum (Kuypers, 2011): identifying zone colors, stating
body states for each zone, sorting scenarios into reasonable
zones, demonstration of calming techniques, and coping

with two unexpected events during the assessment (e.g.,
skipping a scheduled fun activity and waiting to complete
a LEGO building task until the end of the assessment).
Finally, the Social Communication subscale included verbal
and nonverbal conversation skills taught in the GoriLLA
Group, which were coded across the entirety of the as-
sessment interaction with the examiner: sharing informa-
tion with others, taking turns in conversation, commenting
on topics unrelated to own interests, asking questions, using
appropriate body language (SENSE concept from McAfee,
2002, pp. 102–108), and recognizing emotion in others.

COP tasks were the same at all assessment time points,
but some stimuli (e.g., the particular social situations depicted
in photographs, the fun activity that needed to be skipped)
were changed to minimize memory effects. Assessors at
Time Points 2, 3, and 4 were master’s students in speech-
language pathology who were blind to the child’s group
allocation and established reliability with the test creators
by having over 80% scoring agreement on two sequential
assessment observations, either live or via video recording,
prior to administering and scoring the protocol indepen-
dently. Internal consistency of the COP was fair to good
(Cronbach’s alpha at pretest = .76, Cronbach’s alpha at
posttest = .81). Interrater reliability data were collected live
with a second research assistant independently scoring

seven (41%) of the postintervention assessments. The intra-
class correlation coefficient (ICC) for the total COP score
was .97, which is in the “excellent” range. ICCs for COP
items were in the “good” to “excellent” range (based on
Cicchetti & Sparrow, 1990), with a few exceptions; Item B5
(eye contact/gestures/body language; ICC = .16) and Item
K1 (following eye gaze; ICC = .42) seemed to be particularly
challenging social interaction skills to code when observing
rather than administering the assessment.

The Parent Report of Group Outcomes (PROGO;

C. V. Carter & Brady, 2016) consists of 12 multiple-choice
questions tapping general ASD knowledge as well as con-
cepts and vocabulary from GoriLLA Group sessions (see
Supplemental Material S2 for sample questions from the
PROGO; full measure available upon request). It includes
three open-ended hypothetical scenarios, and parents are
asked to describe the strategies they would use with their
child in that scenario. All parents completed this measure
at all assessment time points. Scenarios and the order of
the multiple-choice questions were changed to minimize
memory effects from pre- to posttest. Internal consistency
was fair for the multiple-choice questions on this measure
(Cronbach’s alpha at Time 1 = .55, Cronbach’s alpha at
Time 2 = .66). The open-ended scenario questions were
transcribed and coded for the number of times in each

scenario the parent reported that they would use a GoriLLA
Group strategy or vocabulary word. The total number of
strategies/vocabulary words reported in each scenario at
each time point was used in the analyses.

Generalization to Parent–Child Interaction Outcome Measure
The 3-Box Task (Brady-Smith et al., 1999; Howard,

Martin, Berlin, & Brooks-Gunn, 2011; NICHD Early
Child Care Research Network, 1999; Vandell, 1979) is a
semistructured parent–child play observation of parent and
child social interaction skills (e.g., Parental Sensitivity,
Child Engagement of Parent, Mutuality/Connectedness;
see Table 4 for a full list of subscales measured). This task
served as a measure of the generalization of strategies prac-
ticed in the GoriLLA Group to parent–child interaction
occurring outside the intervention context. Dyads are given
three numbered containers and asked to play with the box
contents in sequence over the course of 15 min. The exact
contents of the boxes changed at each assessment, but they
always included (a) a turn-taking game like Jenga, (b) a set
of pretend play figures and their accessories, and (c) a pic-
ture book. ICCs during a parent–child interaction with
36-month-olds from a previous research group (Early Head
Start Project) ranged from .54 to .69, with 89%–98% exact
coder agreement (Love et al., 2005). Ten child and parent
behaviors were rated from video on a 1–7 scale by a master’s
student research assistant who was blind to the family’s
study group allocation. A bachelor’s-level research assis-
tant was trained to independently score 20% of the videos
as a reliability check (i.e., one of every five recordings
was selected using a random number generator). Aver-
age rater agreement for the 10 ratings was good (mean
exact kappa = .81). For this sample, Parent Intrusive-
ness (exact kappa = .18) and Parent Engagement (exact
kappa = .36) had very low rater agreement compared to the
other scales.

Two self-regulation presses were added to the 3-Box
Task for this study in order to directly assess generaliza-
tion of the self-regulation concepts learned in the group to
parent–child interactions: (a) an auditory interruption that
occurred during the play session when a clock alarmed for
30 s and (b) a delayed gratification task wherein the child
was given a mini cupcake at the start of the play time and
told that they would receive a second cupcake if they delayed
eating the first cupcake until the examiner returned. The
alarm task was coded for child self-regulatory behaviors
(e.g., covering ears, asking parent to turn it off ) and atten-
tion shifts (e.g., looking at alarm, looking at parent for
assistance) during the 30-s period that the alarm is sound-
ing. The delayed gratification task was coded for parent
(e.g., distracting the child from the cupcake) and child
(e.g., touching the cupcake) behaviors in 30-s intervals across
the entire 15-min play period. See Table 4 for complete list
of the parent and child behaviors coded.

Social Validity Outcome Measure

The GoriLLA Group Social Validity Measure, based

on the Social Validity Questionnaire for Parents (Barrett,

2005), is an 11-item tool designed to tap parent satisfaction
with the goals, procedures, and effects of the intervention.
Items are coded from a scale of 1 (not at all ) to 4 (always).
Parents in the intervention group completed this measure
at posttest.

ASD Symptom Measure

The SCQ (Rutter et al., 2003) was completed by par-
ents at the preintervention assessment to describe the child’s
current clinical symptom levels of ASD.

Fidelity Measure

The GoriLLA Group Fidelity Tool was developed to

assess fidelity of the GoriLLA Group curriculum imple-
mentation (see Supplemental Material S3 for sample session
fidelity form; full fidelity form available upon request). It
includes documentation of attendance, an adherence check-
list of session activities and materials, and 5-point ratings for
overall Quality and Behavior Management skills used by
clinicians throughout the session (higher scores indicate
better skills; see Supplemental Material S4 for the quality
and behavior ratings used). Clinicians were asked to aim
for between 80% and 100% adherence to their session cur-
riculum. They codeveloped the adherence checklists with
the principal investigator and had access to them during
each session. Two master’s student research assistants in
speech-language pathology were trained to reliability on
the Quality and Behavior Management ratings and moni-
tored fidelity of the intervention from video recordings.
They were also trained in the core treatment components
of the GoriLLA Group and reviewed the manual and ma-
terials lists before coding each session. Interrater reliability
for Quality and Behavior Management ratings was estab-
lished by coding videos of the pilot group sessions until
there was greater than 80% agreement on ratings for three
consecutive videos. Each activity was rated for Quality and
Behavior Management by the raters, and an overall mean
of all the activity ratings in the session was used in the
analyses. Twenty percent of the recordings were randomly
selected for fidelity coding using a random number gener-
ator. Exact rater agreement on mean session quality rat-
ings was high at 91%. Monday and Thursday groups had
nearly identical mean quality ratings (Monday = 3.06,
Thursday = 3.07), indicating consistency of Quality dur-
ing the study. Rater agreement for Behavior Management
ratings was 100%. Mean behavior ratings were the same
(4.76) for Monday and Thursday groups, indicating con-
sistency of Behavior Management during the study.

Results

All analyses were conducted using JMP 13 Pro (JMP
Pro, 2014). Although multiple statistical tests were performed
within each outcome to address the research questions, in this
preliminary efficacy study project with a modest sample
size, we judged it more important to avoid overlooking
statistical signals of effectiveness of the GoriLLA Group

Efficacy of the GoriLLA Group in Increasing
Self-Regulation and Social Communication
Concept Knowledge

Time × Group interactions on the COP were tested
using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Significant time by group effects were found for the total
COP score, F(1, 15) = 6.90, p ≤.02, η2 = .32, indicating
that the intervention group improved their self-regulation
and social communication knowledge and skills during the
intervention period significantly more than the delayed
treatment group. When analyzed by subscale, a significant
Time × Group interaction was found for the Social Think-
ing subscale, F(1, 15) = 4.78, p ≤ .05, η2 = .24. Time by
group effects were not statistically significant for the Self-
Regulation subscale, F(1, 15) = 4.14, p ≤ .06, η2 = .22, or
the Social Communication subscale, F(1, 15) = 4.14, p ≤ .06,
η2 = .22, though effect sizes were large and favored the
intervention group in each case. When controlling for the
significant group differences in preintervention autism
symptoms on the SCQ, these effects were no longer significant,
though effect sizes were medium, favoring the intervention
group: Total COP score, F(1, 14) = 2.73, p ≤ .12, η2 = .11;
Social Thinking subscale, F(1, 14) = 2.34, p ≤ .15, η2 = .12.
Since nearly half of the children had been reportedly

exposed to Social Thinking and the Zones of Regulation
(in seven of eight cases, children were exposed to both),
COP performance differences between the children with
previous exposure to these curricula (n = 8) versus those
without previous exposure (n = 9) were examined. There
were no significant differences in preintervention COP
scores between children with previous Social Thinking
and Zones of Regulation exposure and children without
that exposure: Total COP score: F(2, 15) = 0.06, p ≤ .94;
Social Thinking subscale: F(2, 15) = 0.01, p ≤ .99; Self-
Regulation subscale: F(2, 15) = 2.10, p ≤ .16.

Repeated-measures ANOVA were used to test for

Time × Group interactions on the multiple-choice section
of the PROGO. A significant time by group effect was
found for the total score on the PROGO, F(1, 15) = 7.06,
p ≤ .02, η2 = .32, favoring the intervention group. When
analyzed separately by subscale, the Self-Regulation sub-
scale of the PROGO demonstrated a significant time by
group effect, F(1, 15) = 6.10, p ≤ .03, η2 = .29, but the
Social Thinking, F(1, 15) = 1.29, p ≤ .27, η2 = .08, and
ASD Knowledge, F(1, 15) = 1.91, p ≤ .19, η2 = .11, sub-
scales did not, though they had medium effect sizes.

Frequency counts of the number of GoriLLA Group

strategies and concepts reported in the three applied sce-
narios from the PROGO were analyzed using repeated-
measures ANOVA to test for Time × Group interactions for

each scenario. In the first scenario, targeting self-regulation
strategies, parents in the intervention group showed a pat-
tern of slightly increased GoriLLA Group strategies reported
from Time 1 to Time 2, but the Time × Group interaction
was nonsignificant, F(1, 15) = 2.75, p ≤ .12, η2 = .15. Simi-
larly, the second scenario, targeting Social Thinking con-
cepts, showed an increase from Time 1 to Time 2 in the
intervention group as compared to the delayed treatment
control group (mean at Time 1 = 0.6, mean at Time 2 = 0.4),
but there was not a significant Time × Group interaction,
F(1, 15) = 3.44, p ≤ .08, η2 = .19. Finally, the third scenario,
targeting Structured TEACCHing strategies, showed signifi-
cant time effects, F(1, 15) = 6.25, p ≤ .02, indicating that
both groups improved from pre- to posttest, but there were
no significant time by group effects, F(1, 15) = 0.90, p ≤ .28,
η2 = .08. However, in the case of all three scenarios,
medium to medium–large effect sizes favored the interven-
tion group.

Generalization of Self-Regulation and Social
Communication Concept Knowledge
to Parent–Child Interactions

No GoriLLA Group treatment effects were found to
generalize to parent–child social interaction behaviors coded
on the 3-Box Task. No Time × Group interactions were
found for parent, child, or mutuality/connectedness behav-
iors coded during this task. One unanticipated exception was
that Parent Detachment increased significantly for parents
who participated in the GoriLLA Group as compared to the
waitlist control group, F(1, 15) = 4.85, p ≤ .04, η2 = .24.
The Auditory Press during the 3-Box Task did not show
any Time × Group interaction effects. Finally, the Delayed
Gratification Press during the 3-Box Task interaction did
not demonstrate any significant time or time by group ef-
fects in the sample. In fact, more than half of the children
in the sample were “noneaters,” meaning that they made
an immediate decision to wait for the examiner to return in
order to receive a second cupcake and did not demonstrate
any behaviors counter to that decision during the 15-min
play period with their parent. This restricted the number of
parent and child behaviors that occurred during the inter-
actions. In contrast, about a third (n = 5) of the sample were
classified as “eaters,” meaning that, upon hearing the in-
structions, they immediately decided to eat the cupcake and
did so within minutes. This behavior also restricted the num-
ber of codable behaviors, as there was no longer a tempta-
tion in the room to elicit behaviors once the child finished
eating the cupcake. There were more “eaters” in the delayed
treatment control group (n = 4) than the intervention group
(n = 1) at the preintervention assessment, so a treatment ef-
fect was not possible to detect; however, it was noted that
“noneaters” were consistent with their decision across time
points and only one “eater” became a “noneater” from
the pre- to postassessment. Data from the 3-Box Task at
Time 3 and Time 4 were not analyzed due to lack of effects
between Time 1 and Time 2.

Social Validity

Seven of the eight intervention group parents who
received the GoriLLA Group intervention completed the
social validity measure. Items were rated on a 1–4 scale
with “1” indicating not useful at all and “4” indicating
very useful. Overall, parents rated the GoriLLA Group
as mostly useful to very useful for teaching social commu-
nication and self-regulation skills to their child, helping
them to support their child’s development in these areas,
and advocating for their child in community settings. Par-
ents unanimously felt that it was helpful for them to par-
ticipate in the group with other parents of children with
ASD. They also enjoyed attending the group and felt that
their child enjoyed the group experience most of the time
to all of the time. t Tests were used to examine differences
in the two GoriLLA Groups, which met on different days
of the week with slightly different clinician teams. Parents
in one of the groups felt that self-regulation skills were sig-
nificantly less useful for children with ASD in general
compared to the other group. These parents started the in-
tervention with slightly less self-regulation knowledge
than the other group, but these differences were not sta-
tistically significant: pretest, t(6) = 1.45, p ≤ .20; posttest,
t(6) = 0.87, p ≤ .42. Interestingly, their children started
and ended the groups with slightly more knowledge and
skills on the COP in this area, but these were also not sig-
nificant differences: pretest, t(6) = –1.20, p ≤ .28; posttest,
t(6) = –0.52, p ≤ .62. It is plausible that, because their chil-
dren had more knowledge and skills in this area, parents
did not feel that these skills were as important areas of
need for children with ASD as did parents of children in
the other GoriLLA Group. Otherwise, there were no sig-
nificant differences in social validity responses between
GoriLLA Groups that met on different days. Parents whose
children had participated previously in group interven-
tions with strategies and concepts from Social Thinking
and the Zones of Regulation tended to rate the usefulness
of the GoriLLA Group lower than those who were new
to the concepts. For example, one parent noted, “This felt
more like nice reinforcement of what we already know.”

Maintenance of Concept Knowledge
at 3 and 6 Months Follow-Up

Families in both study groups participated in follow-up

assessments at 3 and 6 months postintervention. These
assessments also served as pre- and postintervention assess-
ments for the delayed treatment group who received the
intervention between these time points. At the 3-month
follow-up assessment, just before the control group started
intervention, time by group differences were stable, with
the intervention group children performing significantly
better on the COP than the delayed treatment group chil-
dren, F(2, 13) = 4.81, p ≤ .03. This time by group difference
remained significant even after the control group completed
intervention at 6 months follow-up, F(3, 10) = 3.40, p ≤ .04,
because the intervention group continued to gain knowledge

(see Figure 2). ANOVAs from the 3- to 6-month follow-up
assessments showed significant gains in the intervention
group, F(1, 6) = 10.46, p ≤.02, but not in the delayed treat-
ment group, F(1, 8) = 4.10, p ≤ .10; however, there was
a trend toward replication of the effects of the GoriLLA
Group intervention on the COP for the delayed treatment
group. Furthermore, time by group effects on the Social
Thinking subscale, F(3, 10) = 3.29, p ≥ .07, approached
significance, and the Self-Regulation subscale was signifi-
cant, F(3, 10) = 6.54, p ≥ .01, when examined across all
four time points. The Social Communication subscale did
not demonstrate time by group effects over time. Time
by group effects on the PROGO were not statistically
significant at either the 3-month or the 6 month follow-up
assessments.

Treatment Fidelity
Attendance

Most families attended between 10 and 11 (M = 10.75,

SD = 1.49) of the 12 sessions; the number of absences
ranged from none to four. Parents reported the reasons for
absences were due to family and situational factors and
events (e.g., vacation, illness, school program), not the in-
tervention itself.

Adherence

With 100% rater agreement, the coded sessions ad-
hered to the lesson plan with 95% accuracy. In addition,
there was 100% compliance with the materials lists during
the coded sessions. There were no significant differences
found in mean adherence ratings between the two interven-
tion groups, suggesting that, despite differing clinician teams,
adherence to the curriculum was similar for both groups.

Clinician Quality

Quality ratings of “3” on the 5-point scale indicated

a high level of clinician knowledge and implementation of
the curriculum. Ratings higher than “3” indicated specific
instances of going above and beyond this level of quality
during the session. The mean quality rating across all rated
sessions was 3.07 (SD = 0.13). Considering that this mean
also reflects a mean quality rating over all activities within a
session, this overall quality rating suggests a consistently
high level of clinician knowledge and implementation of
the GoriLLA Group curriculum during the study.

Clinician Behavior Management

Group member Behavior Management by the clini-
cians was rated on a 5-point scale. For this rating, a “5”
indicates that either no undesirable behaviors occurred
during the session or that behaviors were managed quickly
and without any ongoing issue (e.g., needing to try more
than one strategy or reminding the child of the strategy
multiple times to manage the behavior). A “4” indicates a
high level of Behavior Management wherein use of strate-
gies by the clinician is effective for keeping the session
going, but multiple efforts or strategies to manage those

behaviors are needed. The overall mean behavior rating
across all activities within the coded sessions was high
at 4.76 (SD = 0.11), indicating a high level of Behavior
Management on the part of clinicians when it was neces-
sary during the rated sessions.

Discussion

This study examined the efficacy of a parent-assisted

blended intervention program using components from
Social Thinking and Structured TEACCHing to increase
social communication and self-regulation concept knowl-
edge in first and second graders diagnosed with ASD and
their parents. Overall, the results of this study indicate that
the GoriLLA Group intervention package demonstrates
preliminary efficacy for teaching social communication and
self-regulation concept knowledge to children with ASD and
their parents. Both parents and children demonstrated an
increase in social communication and self-regulation con-
cept knowledge after participating in the GoriLLA Group
as compared to a delayed treatment control group. Even
when controlling for preintervention group differences in
autism symptoms reported on the SCQ, effects of the child
measure remained moderate, though they were not statisti-
cally significant. Furthermore, in applied written scenario
responses, parents’ use of intervention strategies and vocabu-
lary increased from pre- to posttest, though results were not
statistically significant.

The key ingredients of this blended intervention pack-

age included (a) the use of the Structured TEACCHing
framework (environmental structure, visual supports),
(b) the concrete social vocabulary and strategies of We
Thinkers! Volume 1, (c) the self-regulation vocabulary
and strategies from the Zones of Regulation, and (d) the
use of parent assistance during activities. These ingredi-
ents combined to form a blended intervention package
that is not only effective in increasing concept knowledge
but also socially valid for those with ASD and their parents.
Though the Social Thinking subscale was the only child
measure (COP subscale) to reach statistical significance,
both the Self-Regulation and Social Communication sub-
scales had large effect sizes and approached statistical sig-
nificance ( ps = .06). Only the Self-Regulation subscale was
statistically significant for the parent (PROGO) measure;
yet, the effect sizes for the other subscales were moderate.
These effects show promise for the key GoriLLA Group
intervention package ingredients.

The effects of the GoriLLA Group intervention did

not generalize to parent–child interactions during the semi-
structured set of activities that were part of the pre- and
posttest assessment protocol. This is consistent with the
lack of generalizability to peer interactions found in other
social cognitive intervention studies (e.g., Bauminger, 2007).
It is possible that the dosage of this 12-week intervention
was inadequate to show generalization effects immediately
following intervention. Considering that the significant

Nowell et al.: Efficacy of SC and SR Intervention 429

changes seen on the COP and PROGO were primarily in
the area of concept knowledge, rather than application of
strategies, it is unlikely that application of strategies would
generalize beyond the clinic setting after a 12-week inter-
vention. An unanticipated finding from the coded parent–
child interactions on the 3-Box Task was that Parent
Detachment increased significantly from pre- to postassess-
ments in the dyads that participated in the GoriLLA Group.
One interpretation of this finding may be that parents who
participated in the GoriLLA Group were more confident
about their child’s ability to regulate themselves while
playing with toys and, as a result, demonstrated more de-
tached parenting characteristics at posttest. Intervention
group parents were also more comfortable in the building
from attending weekly GoriLLA Group sessions and may
have demonstrated more of their typical detached parenting
behaviors (e.g., answering e-mails on their phone while
their child played) than they would have at pretest or as
compared to the control group parents who may have had
the social motivation to impress the research team so that
their child would receive intervention.

The time by group effects seen on the COP were con-

sistent at the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments, as
were subscale results for Self-Regulation. Due to the par-
ent-assisted nature of the intervention, we assume that par-
ents continued to use the strategies and vocabulary from
the GoriLLA Group at home, which allowed their children
to continue to make gains relative to the control group,
even after the control group received the intervention. The
control group’s gains on the COP were not significant from
pre- (Time 3) to postintervention (Time 4); their mean
unweighted total score change during intervention was
2.88 compared to 4.52 in the intervention group. It is possi-
ble that, since the control group demonstrated significantly
fewer autism symptoms at the start of the study compared
to the intervention group, they had less room for growth
and made comparatively modest progress during the inter-
vention. The time by group effects for the PROGO were
not maintained at the follow-up assessments. Considering
the small sample size, it is challenging to interpret these
insignificant results, but further testing of this intervention
with a larger sample size is warranted.

Results indicate that the GoriLLA Group is a socially

valid blended intervention package for teaching social
communication and self-regulation skills to early elementary
school–age children with ASD. Overall, intervention group
parents reported that they enjoyed the groups, found the
content effective, and appreciated the opportunity to learn
alongside other parents of children with ASD. Furthermore,
fidelity data show that the GoriLLA Group was feasible
for clinicians to implement each week at a high level of
quality and behavior management, even with different clinical
teams and practicum students working with each group.

Limitations

There were some limitations to this study. In order

to complete the study in a community setting, some decisions

that affected the rigor of the research protocol were made.
First, the sample size, though it was the largest possible
given the resources at the Chapel Hill TEACCH Center,
was small and underpowered the analyses to detect effect
sizes that were less than large. Though the clinical sample
was representative of a “real-world” community sample
at the Chapel Hill TEACCH Center and included some
racial and ethnic diversity as well as four females with
ASD, the small sample size prevented examination of ra-
cial, ethnic, or sex differences in treatment outcome. Some
children in this study met the clinical ASD cutoff on the
SCQ, and some did not, meaning that this sample may
not be representative of other research samples of children
with ASD. Moreover, all children in this study were main-
streamed in their school setting and reading on grade level.
These were important research inclusion criteria to make
sure that all children could understand the manualized treat-
ment content; however, it is possible that minor modifications
could be made for lower functioning children to benefit
from the program. Ensuring that this intervention benefits
as many individuals with ASD as possible and that modifi-
cations are made, when necessary, for various subpopula-
tions within ASD is an important next research step.

Assessments were also affected by the community
setting in which this study took place. Space, time, and clinic
policies at the Chapel Hill TEACCH Center all had to be
taken into consideration and limited the number of mea-
sures that could be included in the protocol (e.g., using
the ADOS to confirm community diagnosis could not be ac-
commodated). Although there was plenty of clinical space
and time allotted for the usual four to five families seen for
pre–post GoriLLA Group assessments clinically, tripling the
number of assessments for the study put a strain on those re-
sources. In order to get families in for assessments within a 3-
week window at each time point, the majority of the research
assessments took place during evenings and weekends.

Furthermore, the GoriLLA Group interventionists

created both the parent and child measures based on their
years of experience implementing the groups. Alternate
measures of social communication and self-regulation were
considered for use in this study, but no standardized mea-
sures that were likely to detect the changes in the core tar-
gets of the GoriLLA Group after a low-dosage, 12-week
intervention period were available. The clinically developed
measures were revised with pilot data to be more objective
for research purposes, detect change over time, and establish
reliable administration and scoring procedures, but strong
psychometric properties were not established prior to use
of these measures for research purposes. Though all of the
psychometric data possible were collected and reported
to aid in interpreting results of these measures, the use of
validated measures as primary outcomes would strengthen
the results of this study. Further research is needed with
larger samples of children to further determine the psycho-
metric properties of the COP and the PROGO.

Since the GoriLLA Group is a blended treatment

model composed of two widely used curricula (Structured
TEACCHing and two components of the Social Thinking

430 Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools (cid:129) Vol. 50 (cid:129) 416–433 (cid:129) July 2019

Methodology: We Thinkers! Volume 1 vocabulary/concepts
and the Zones of Regulation vocabulary/concepts), treat-
ment contamination was another limitation of this study.
Over half of the participants had some previous or current
exposure to one of these curricula, although this is also a
reflection of what happens in real-world clinical practice
where children are often exposed to multiple interventions.
Despite asking parents about their child’s exposure to these
curricula, it was difficult to ascertain the extent to which
children had been exposed. Based on parent report in this
sample, it seems that there is considerable variation both
in services that claim to implement each of these curricula
and in the extent to which what is taught in these curricula
is communicated to parents. Therefore, controlling for
previous exposure to these curricula was a challenge. Com-
paring the pretest COP scores of children whose parents
reported previous exposure to Social Thinking and the
Zones of Regulation to children whose parents did not re-
port previous exposure yielded no significant differences;
however, it is certainly possible that other children in the
study had previous exposure to the GoriLLA Group con-
cepts and vocabulary at school and in private therapy ses-
sions of which their parents were not aware. In future
studies, communicating with school and private interven-
tionists may more accurately elucidate pretreatment expo-
sure to these curricula.

Conclusions

In summary, this initial efficacy study suggests that sig-
nificant changes in social communication and self-regulation
knowledge in first and second graders with high-functioning
ASD can be made and sustained in a low-intensity social
cognitive community-based treatment.
