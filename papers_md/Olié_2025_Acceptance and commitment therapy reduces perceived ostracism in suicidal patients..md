Abstract 
Introduction  Ostracism increases the risk of depression and suicidal behaviors. Mindfulness training, which is at the 
core of third‑wave behavioral therapies such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), might reduce social 
distress and inhibit negative affect.

Methods  This randomized controlled trial included 32 patients with a history of suicide attempt in the past year who 
followed seven weekly sessions of ACT or progressive relaxation therapy (PRT). To assess and compare the effects 
of ACT and PRT on social distress, patients performed a validated paradigm of social exclusion (the Cyberball Game) 
followed by completion of the Need Threat Scale (NTS) at inclusion (baseline) and within two weeks after the inter‑
vention ended (posttherapy).

Results  The included patients were mainly women (N = 28; 87.5%), and their mean age was 40 years (SD: 12 years). 
Twenty‑six patients (81%) experienced current depression. The postintervention NTS score was greater (lower social 
distress) in the ACT group than in the PRT group (group × time interaction; β = 0.47, p < 0.05), even after controlling 
for depressive symptoms (β = 0.27, p < 0.05). The NTS score change (between baseline and posttherapy) was corre‑
lated with changes in dispositional mindfulness (r = 0.46, p = 0.03), cognitive fusion (r = − 0.61, p <  10–3) and accept‑
ance (r = 0.57, p <  10–2).
Conclusion  ACT decreased social pain independently of its effect on depression. Reduced social pain was correlated 
with improved therapeutic processes and decreased suicidal ideation, highlighting the therapeutic potential of ACT 
for managing ostracism and suicide risk.

Introduction
Ostracism (i.e., being ignored and excluded) [1] frustrates 
the basic human needs required for human survival, such 
as  fulfillment,  belonging,  self-esteem,  control  and  the 
meaning  of  existence.  Ostracism  is  a  painful  experience

that  threatens  an  individual’s  self-concept  and  leads  to 
depression and suicidal behaviors [2, 3]. Suicide risk rep-
resents a major public health issue, with 700,000 people 
dying by suicide annually, according to the World Health 
Organization, making it the fourth leading cause of death 
among individuals aged 15–29. This statistic underscores 
the importance of addressing risk factors associated with 
suicidal  behaviors,  such  as  social  exclusion.  Most  sui-
cide  victims  experienced  at  least  one  or  more  adverse 
life events, in the last few months before their death [4]. 
Interpersonal  conflicts,  relationship  breakdown  and  job 
loss or difficulties are among the most prevalent events, 
all of which are social stressors confronting the individual 
with  some  form  of  social  exclusion  and  a  threat  toward

their  social  status.  The  most  recent  psychological  theo-
ries  of  suicide,  i.e.,  the  interpersonal  theory  of  suicide 
[5], the three-step theory of suicide [6] or the integrated 
motivational-volitional model [7] include social stressors 
such  as  exclusion  and  threats  to  social  status  as  funda-
mental elements in the development of suicidal ideation 
[8]. It is interesting to highlight that social exclusion facil-
itates risky decision-making underpinned by dysfunction 
of  prefrontal  cortex  in  suicide  attempters  [9].  Neuroim-
aging  studies  in  suicide  attempters  suggest  the  presence 
of brain alterations associated with suicidal vulnerability 
not  only  in  the  prefrontal  cortex  but  also  in  the  tempo-
ral and parietal cortices [10], which are involved in social 
cognition  processing  [11].  Indeed,  during  the  Cyberball 
game  (a  validated  paradigm  of  social  exclusion),  activa-
tion of the left insula and supramarginal gyrus is lower in 
patients with a history of suicidal acts than in psychiatric 
and healthy controls [12].

Mindfulness  training  develops  the  awareness  that 
emerges by intentionally paying attention to  the present 
moment  and  by  nonjudgmentally  experiencing  each 
moment.  Interestingly,  dispositional  mindfulness  is  cor-
related with a reduction in the activity and connectivity of 
brain regions associated with social distress and negative 
affect  inhibition,  resulting  in  better  emotion  regulation 
and less distress following social exclusion [13]. Disposi-
tional mindfulness also weakens the association between 
depressive  symptomatology  and  suicidal  ideation  in 
patients with a history of suicidal depression [14]. Mind-
fulness is at the core of third-wave behavioral therapies, 
such as dialectical behavioral therapy, which contributes 
to preventing suicidal behaviors in patients with border-
line personality disorder [15]. In a randomized controlled 
trial,  we  reported  that  in  patients  with  a  history  of  sui-
cide  attempts  in  the  past  year,  acceptance  and  commit-
ment  therapy  (ACT),  a  third-wave  behavioral  therapy, 
more efficiently reduced depressive symptomatology and 
suicidal ideation than did progressive relaxation training 
(PRT) [16]. The primary aim of this randomized control 
study is to determine whether ACT can reduce perceived 
ostracism in suicidal patients (using the Cyberball Game) 
independently  of  its  effects  on  depression,  thereby  alle-
viating  social  distress  that  heightens  the  risk  of  suicidal 
behaviors.

Methods
Study design

The present study was a secondary analysis of data from 
a  prospective  randomized  controlled  trial  (clinicaltrials.
gov;  Clinical  Trial  ID#NCT  02936700;  posted  on  2016-
10-18)  that  compared  ACT  and  PRT  effectiveness  for 
reducing suicidal ideation at month 3 after the interven-
tion ended in patients with a history of suicide attempts 

in the previous year [16]. Eligible participants were ran-
domly  assigned  (1:1  ratio)  to  ACT  or  PRT  for  7  weeks. 
The  randomization  sequence  was  centralized  and  com-
puted  in  permuted  blocks  of  two  or  four  by  the  study 
statistician in an order unknown by the investigators.

Participant selection

Participants  were  recruited  at  the  Department  of  Psy-
chiatric Emergency and Acute Care, University Hospital 
of  Montpellier  (France).  The  inclusion  criteria  were  age 
between  18  and  65  years  and  current  suicidal  behavior 
disorder according to the DSM-5 criteria (i.e., history of 
suicide  attempt  in  the  past  year).  A  suicide  attempt  was 
defined  as  a  self-damaging  act  carried  out  with  some 
intent  to  die,  distinguished  from  other  types  of  self-
destructive behavior [17].

The exclusion criteria were a lifetime history of schizo-
phrenia,  current  alcohol/illicit  drug  use  disorders,  cur-
rent  manic  or  hypomanic  episodes,  a  lifetime  history  of 
severe brain injury or neurologic disease, and pregnancy.

Treatments and procedures

The  experimental  intervention  consisted  of  seven  2-h 
sessions  (one  per  week)  of  ACT  on  the  basis  of  refer-
ence  books  [18].  Using  the  ACT  matrix  [19],  each  ses-
sion  focused  on  a  specific  skill:  (1)  Values  Identification 
and Clarification (conceptualization of values as a direc-
tion  or  internal  compass,  distinguishing  between  values 
and  goals,  and  identifying  the  patient’s  personal  values 
for  the  main  areas  of  life),  (2)  Understanding  the  Strug-
gle  Trap  and  Using  the  Matrix  (Explanation  of  the  trap 
of  struggling  and  presentation  of  the  decision-making 
model based on the matrix that develops the capacity to 
act in alignment with one’s values in the face of internal 
obstacles  instead  of  engaging  in  experiential  avoidance 
behaviors),  (3)  Acceptance  (Capabilities  for  identify-
ing  and  welcoming  emotions,  which  are  understood  as 
a collection of transient bodily sensations), (4) Cognitive 
Defusion  (changing  the  relationship  to  thoughts  rather 
than  the  content  of  the  thoughts,  with  techniques  such 
as  naming  the  story  and  prefacing  thoughts  with  “I  am 
having  the  thought  that”),  (5)  Present  Moment  Contact 
(enhancing  awareness  and  connection  with  the  present 
moment),  (6)  Self  as  Context  (identifying  oneself  as  the 
indestructible  context  or  observer  in  which  all  human 
impermanent  experiences  appear,  rather  than  as  the 
experiences  themselves),  (7)  Integration  and  Planning 
Forward  (integrating  the  skills  learned  throughout  the 
program  and  planning  for  their  continued  application 
in daily life). The control intervention consisted of seven 
2-h sessions (one per week) of PRT on the basis of Bern-
stein et al. [20]. Each session focused on learning to tense 
and relax groups of muscles. The PRT and ACT sessions

followed a similar pattern: homework review, acquisition 
of new therapeutic skills, and handing out a written sum-
mary. Both interventions were delivered by the same two 
therapists (DD and VA)

Clinical assessments

The clinical assessments were performed by two trained 
psychiatrists  who  were  blinded  to  the  group  alloca-
tion.  Patients  were  assessed  within  2  weeks  before  ther-
apy  initiation  (i.e.,  baseline)  and  within  two  weeks  after 
therapy  completion  (i.e.,  post-therapy).  At  baseline, 
sociodemographic variables were recorded; lifetime psy-
chopathology  was  assessed  with  the  Mini-International 
Neuropsychiatric  Interview,  and  borderline  personal-
ity  disorder  was  assessed  with  the  Structured  Clinical 
Interview  for  DSM-IV  Axis  II  Disorders.  At  both  vis-
its,  the  following  questionnaires  were  completed  on  the 
same  day  as  the  Cyberball  Game  (see  below),  prior  to 
participating in the task. Current depressive symptoma-
tology was assessed via the clinician-rated 30-item Inven-
tory  of  Depressive  Symptomatology  (IDS-C30)  and  the 
Quick  Inventory  of  Depressive  Symptomatology  Self-
Report  (QIDS-SR).  Suicidal  ideation  in  the  last  month 
and  the  number  of  lifetime  history  of  suicide  attempt 
were  assessed  with  the  Columbia–Suicide  Severity  Rat-
ing  Scale  (C-SSRS)  [21].  The  intensity  subscore  of  the 
C-SSRS was used to quantify suicidal ideation, with item 
scores summed to produce an overall measure of ideation 
severity.  The  therapeutic  processes  were  also  assessed. 
The  Acceptance  and  Action  Questionnaire  II  (AAQ-II) 
[22] was utilized to measure psychological flexibility and 
acceptance,  with  higher  scores  indicating  less  psycho-
logical  inflexibility.  Cognitive  fusion  was  assessed  with 
the  28-item  Cognitive  Fusion  Questionnaire  (CFQ-28) 
[23], which quantifies the extent to which individuals are 
entangled with their thoughts. The Philadelphia Mindful-
ness  Scale  (PHLMS)  [23]  assessed  mindfulness  through 
its two subscales—awareness and acceptance—reflecting 
the  individual’s  capacity  for  present-moment  awareness 
without  judgment.  The  Mindful  Attention  Awareness 
Scale  (MAAS)  [24]  measured  attention  to  and  aware-
ness  of  present  experiences,  with  higher  scores  signify-
ing  greater  mindfulness.  Current  intake  of  psychotropic 
drugs was recorded.

Experimental social exclusion: the Cyberball game

The Cyberball game, a validated paradigm of social exclu-
sion  [25],  was  performed  before  therapy  initiation  (i.e., 
baseline) and after therapy completion (i.e., posttherapy). 
The participants were informed that they would play with 
two  other  players.  The  participants  played  with  a  pre-
set  computer  program  and  were  given  a  cover  story  to 
ensure that they believed the other players were real. The 

Cyberball game comprises three successive conditions. In 
the first condition (implicit social exclusion), the partici-
pant watches the other “players” who play the Cyberball 
game.  In  the  second  condition  (inclusion),  the  partici-
pant  plays  with  the  other  two  players  and  receives  the 
ball  as  many  times  as  the  two  virtual  players  do.  In  the 
third condition, the participant is progressively excluded 
(the two virtual players do not throw the ball to the par-
ticipant). In total, the session includes 180 ball tosses (60 
tosses per condition). After the Cyberball game, patients 
completed the Need Threat Scale (NTS) [26] to measure 
their perception of social exclusion or social distress. The 
NTS  assesses  20  subjectively  experienced  consequences 
of  being  excluded  during  a  game,  including  sub-scores 
for self-esteem (e.g., “I feel liked”), belongingness (e.g., “I 
feel rejected”), meaningfulness (e.g., “I feel invisible”) and 
control  (e.g.,  “I  feel  powerful”),  on  a  scale  ranging  from 
1  (not  at  all)  to  5  (very  much).  In  addition,  items  were 
reverse coded when appropriate and averaged to generate 
a  composite  score  of  social  distress.  Higher  scores  indi-
cate lower perceptions of social exclusion.

Statistical analyses

Descriptive  statistics  were  used  to  summarize  the  base-
line  characteristics  of  the  two  groups:  medians  and 
min–max  for  continuous  variables  and  frequencies  and 
percentages for categorical variables. Groups were com-
pared  via  the  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test,  Chi-square  test 
(χ2),  or  Fisher’s  exact  test.  The  intervention  effect  over 
time  (changes  in  total  NTS  score  and  4  sub-scores)  was 
analyzed  via  a  mixed  model  for  repeated  measures. The 
model  included  time  (baseline  and  post-therapy),  group 
(ACT  and  PRT),  and  time-by-group  interactions  as 
fixed effects and a random patient effect. Additionally, a 
repeated  measures  correlation  analysis  of  the  NTS  total 
score, suicidal ideation severity, and scores of the differ-
ent therapeutic process questionnaires was performed to 
assess their associations over time. Statistical significance 
was set at α = 0.05, and analyses were performed with R 
version 4.3.3 (R Core Team, 2024), R Foundation for Sta-
tistical  Computing,  Vienna,  Austria.  The  data  are  avail-
able upon request to the authors.

Results
The  sample  included  32  patients  as  two  patients  from 
the  PRT  group  did  not  complete  the  study.  The  sample 
was  mainly  female  (28  women;  87.5%)  with  a  mean  age 
was  40  years  (SD:  12  years).  Twenty-six  patients  (81%) 
had current depression according to the DSM-5 criteria. 
Ssociodemographic  and  clinical  data  of  the  participants 
in the two groups (ACT and PRT) were not significantly 
different (Table 1)

In  the  Cyberball  game,  all  participants  felt  ignored 
and excluded and estimated the percentage of ball tosses 
they  received  realistically  (i.e.,  retrospective  manipula-
tion  check)  (Table  2).  The  feeling  of  exclusion  did  not 
differ  between  the  intervention  groups  or  across  time. 
Conversely,  the  feeling  of  being  ignored  significantly 
decreased  only  in  the  ACT  group  between  baseline  and 
posttherapy.

The  baseline  NTS  total  score  (2.64,  SD = 0.59  vs.  2.57, 
SD = 0.68);  p = 0.76)  and  subscores  were  not  different 
between  the  ACT  and  PRT  groups.  For  the  NTS  total 
score, the mixed model revealed a significant main effect 
of  time  (β = 0.35  p < 0.05),  but  not  of  group  (β = 0.07, 
p = 0.11),  and  a  significant  time × group 
interaction 
(β = 0.47, p < 0.05). The time × group interaction was also 
significant for the belonging subscore (β = 1.02, p < 0.05). 
Compared  with  the  baseline  values,  the  increases  in  the 
posttherapy  NTS  total  score  (p = 0.02)  and  subscore 
(p >  10–2) were greater in the ACT group than in the PRT 
group (Table 2).

After  adjusting  for  depression  level  (QIDS-SR  score), 
the  time × group  interaction  remained  significant  for 
both the NTS total score (β = 0.27, p < 0.05; Fig. 1) and the 
belonging subscore (β = 0.87, p < 0.05).

The changes in the AAQ-II, PHLMS and MAAS scores 
were  positively  correlated  with  the  increase  in  the  NTS 
score  (r = 0.57,  p ≤  10–2;  r = 0.46,  p = 0.03;  and  r = 0.5, 
p = 0.01, respectively) between baseline and posttherapy. 
The  changes  in  the  CFQ-28  score  and  suicidal  ideation 

severity  were  negatively  correlated  with  the  increase  in 
the  NTS  total  score  (r = -0.61,  p <  10–3  and  r = −  0.33; 
p = 0.06, respectively) between baseline and posttherapy.

Discussion
Compared  with  PRT,  ACT  resulted  in  a  reduction  in 
the NTS total score in patients with a history of suicide 
attempt  in  the  past  year,  independent  of  the  improve-
ment in depressive symptomatology. The Cyberball game 
elicits painful feelings due to social exclusion (i.e., social 
pain), which shares features with physical pain [27]. Our 
finding is particularly compelling because it underscores 
the  capacity  of  ACT  to  address  social  perceptions,  in 
addition to its effect on depressive symptoms. The reduc-
tion  in  the  perception  of  social  exclusion  is  notewor-
thy,  given  the  established  link  between  ostracism  and  a 
heightened  risk  of  suicidal  behaviors  [28].  It  also  aligns 
with  the  temporal  model  of  ostracism  effects  proposed 
by Williams [29]. According to this model, interventions 
such  as  ACT  prevent  the  intense  psychological  distress 
associated with the resignation stage by promoting adap-
tive  coping  strategies  during  the  previous  reflexive  and 
reflective stages of the reaction to ostracism.

Moreover,  the  feeling  of  being  ignored,  which  implies 
the interpretation of negative intent from others toward 
oneself,  was  significantly  reduced  by  ACT  but  not  PRT. 
ACT may help prevent the reflexive stage of ostracism by 
mitigating the perception of being ignored. Indeed, ACT 
may equip individuals with the resilience needed for not

The NTS total score changed significantly from before 
to after the intervention, with different trajectories in the 
ACT and PRT groups. By fostering increased psychologi-
cal  flexibility,  ACT  encourages  a  more  adaptative  rela-
tionship  with  one’s  thoughts  and  feelings  [30],  thereby 
mitigating the threat of ostracism to fundamental needs. 
This  effect  was  particularly  significant  for  the  belonging 
subscore,  reinforcing  the  pivotal  role  of  social  connec-
tions in the management of suicidal patients. Indeed, low 
belongingness is at the core of the interpersonal theory of 
suicide [31, 32]. The improved belongingness through the 
ACT  offers  perspectives  for  interventions,  highlighting 
the  ability  of  this  therapy  to  target  and  improve  critical 
dimensions that contribute to the suicidal process.

We found that suicidal ideation severity and the per-
ception  of  social  exclusion  decreased  concomitantly. 
However,  the  correlation  between  the  increase  in  the 
NTS  total  score  (reduction  in  social  distress)  and  the 
reduction  in  suicidal  ideation  severity  (C-SSRS  score) 
was  not  significant,  probably  due  to  a  ceiling  effect. 
Indeed, only 11 patients (34%) reported active suicidal 
ideation, limiting the possibility of achieving statistical 

significance.  Nevertheless,  this  observation  strength-
ens  the  importance  of  reducing  social  distress  in  sui-
cidal  patients.  Moreover,  we  found  that  social  distress 
progressively  decreased  with  changes  in  therapeutic 
processes,  including  psychological  flexibility,  cognitive 
defusion,  and  mindfulness.  It  emphasizes  the  pivotal 
role  of  ACT  in  bolstering  reflective  coping  strategies 
[29].  This  form  of  adaptive  coping  is  instrumental  for 
potentially  tharting  the  progression  to  the  resignation 
stage, where enduring psychological distress becomes a 
significant  concern.  Notably,  such  enduring  distress  is 
exacerbated by pain catastrophizing, a cycle of rumina-
tion  that  amplifies  the  perception  and  impact  of  pain. 
Pain  catastrophizing,  marked  by  magnification,  rumi-
nation and a pervasive sense of helplessness about pain, 
considerably  increases  the  intensity  and  persistence 
of  psychological  distress.  A  recent  study  reported  that 
in  patients  with  low  back  pain,  pain  catastrophizing  is 
an  independent  risk  factor  for  progression  to  chronic 
widespread  pain  [33].  Moreover,  pain  catastrophiz-
ing  is  enhanced  by  experiential  avoidance  (an  attempt 
to  evade  or  escape  unwanted  internal  experiences, 
including  thoughts,  feelings,  and  bodily  sensations), 
which is targeted by the ACT. The relationship between 
fear-avoidance  beliefs  and  pain  intensity  indicates  a

reciprocal  association:  patients  with  increased  fear 
avoidance  have  greater  pain  intensity,  which  in  turn 
induces  greater  fear  avoidance  [34].  Moreover,  a  com-
prehensive  meta-analysis  [35]  revealed  moderate  to 
strong associations between experiential avoidance and 
suicidal  behaviors.  By  fostering  psychological  flexibil-
ity,  mindfulness,  and  cognitive  defusion,  ACT  directly 
counters  the  detrimental  cycles  of  experiential  avoid-
ance,  pain  catastrophizing,  and  fear  avoidance  and 
decreases painful feelings related to the social exclusion 
and suicidal dimensions.

ACT,  as  a  third-wave  cognitive‒behavioral  therapy, 
emphasizes  acceptance  and  psychological  flexibility, 
which  are  crucial  for  navigating  through  disturbing 
thoughts  and  experiences.  This  approach  diverges  from 
attempts to control or avoid these experiences and facili-
tates  a  profound  change  in  the  individual’s  relationship 
with distressing thoughts and sensations [36]. By decreas-
ing rumination, ACT facilitates a shift toward increased 
resilience and meaningful life engagement. This enhance-
ment  of  psychological  processes  through  ACT  high-
lights  a  shift  toward  a  resilient  self-concept  anchored  in 
a  meaningful  life  and  counteracts  the  increased  implicit 
associations  of  "death"  and  "me",  relative  to  "life"  and 
"me", caused by ostracism [37]. As self-concept is at the 
root  of  all  our  experiences  [38],  understanding  the  pro-
cesses  underlying  self-concept  changes,  at  the  core  of 
recent developments in relational frame theory [39], is a 
major concern in psychotherapy.

Our  results  are  in  line  with  those  of  a  previous  study 
showing  that  dispositional  mindfulness,  a  key  aspect 
of  ACT,  is  negatively  associated  with  the  perception  of 
exclusion and ruminations following experimental exclu-
sion  [40].  They  also  provide  insights  into  the  dynamic 
nature of this association through the prospective design 
of  data  collection,  which  highlights  the  transformative 
potential  of  mindfulness  and  acceptance  in  addressing 
social  pain.  By  emphasizing  psychological  flexibility  and 
acceptance,  ACT  helps  individuals  reinterpret  experi-
ences  of  social  exclusion,  alleviates  immediate  distress, 
and promotes long-term well-being and resilience despite 
ostracism.

For  this  study,  patients  with  current  suicidal  behavior 
disorders were included because the risk of reattempts is 
highest in the first year following a suicide attempt. ACT 
may  be  initiated  during  this  critical  period  because,  in 
these patients, it reduces suicidal ideation and depression 
[16]  as  well  as  perceived  ostracism,  which  may  amplify 
interpersonal  difficulties  and  barriers  to  adherence  to 
care. The decreased feeling of social exclusion may con-
tribute to reducing suicidal ideation, restoring social con-
nections,  reducing  loneliness,  and  improving  adherence 
to care.

Our study has several limitations. The sample was small 
and included mainly women who feel more excluded and 
ignored  in  reaction  to  social  exclusion  [41].  This  may 
limit  the  generalizability  of  our  results.  The  Cyberball 
game has never been repeated in previous studies, raising 
the question of a learning effect. However, the absence of 
a significant reduction in the posttherapy NTS total score 
in the control group (PRT) and the realistic estimation of 
ball receipts indicate task validity even the second time.

The findings of this study pave the way for new research 
directions  on  the  application  of  ACT  in  reducing  social 
distress among suicidal patients. A valuable area of future 
research  could  explore  whether  ACT  might  also  reduce 
perceived  ostracism  in  other  at-risk  populations,  such 
as  adolescents  or  individuals  with  personality  disorders. 
Future  research  could  also  investigate  the  underlying 
mechanisms through which ACT reduces social distress, 
particularly by examining neurobiological features using 
functional  MRI  or  peripheral  measures  (for  example 
inflammatory or epigenetic markers).

In  conclusion,  ACT  offers  a  significant  therapeutic 
advantage to individuals who experience perceived ostra-
cism, particularly those with a history of suicide attempt. 
Through  psychological  flexibility,  mindfulness,  and  cog-
nitive defusion, ACT reduces immediate social pain and 
may  promote  long-term  resilience.  The  transformative 
potential of ACT, in redefining the relationship with dis-
tressing thoughts and experiences, underscores the criti-
cal role of relational frame theory advances in the future 
of  psychotherapy  to  address  the  complex  interplay  of 
self-concept,  social  pain  and  suicidality.  The  significant 
reduction in perceived social exclusion achieved through 
ACT  in  our  study  suggests  that  this  approach  could  be 
integrated  more  broadly  into  therapeutic  protocols  for 
patients at suicide risk, particularly in the early stages of 
post-attempt care when the risk of recurrence is high.
