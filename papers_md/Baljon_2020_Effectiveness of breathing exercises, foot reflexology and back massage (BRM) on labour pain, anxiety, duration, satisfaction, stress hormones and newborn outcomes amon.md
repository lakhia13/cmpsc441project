Introduction  Labour pain is among the severest 
pains primigravidae may experience during pregnancy. 
Failure to address labour pain and anxiety may lead to 
abnormal labour. Despite the many complementary non- 
pharmacological approaches to coping with labour pain, 
the quality of evidence is low and best approaches are 
not established. This study protocol describes a proposed 
investigation of the effects of a combination of breathing 
exercises, foot reflexology and back massage (BRM) on the 
labour experiences of primigravidae.
Methods and analysis  This randomised controlled trial 
will involve an intervention group receiving BRM and 
standard labour care, and a control group receiving only 
standard labour care. Primigravidae of 26–34 weeks 
of gestation without chronic diseases or pregnancy- 
related complications will be recruited from antenatal 
clinics. Eligible and consenting patients will be randomly 
allocated to the intervention or the control group stratified 
by intramuscular pethidine use. The BRM intervention will 
be delivered by a trained massage therapist. The primary 
outcomes of labour pain and anxiety will be measured 
during and after uterine contractions at baseline (cervical 
dilatation 6 cm) and post BRM hourly for 2 hours. The 
secondary outcomes include maternal stress hormone 
(adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol and oxytocin) 
levels, maternal vital signs (V/S), fetal heart rate, labour 
duration, Apgar scores and maternal satisfaction. The 
sample size is estimated based on the between- group 
difference of 0.6 in anxiety scores, 95% power and 5% 
α error, which yields a required sample size of 154 (77 
in each group) accounting for a 20% attrition rate. The 
between- group and within- group outcome measures 
will be examined with mixed- effect regression models, 
time series analyses and paired t- test or equivalent non- 
parametric tests, respectively.

strengths and limitations of this study

 ► This  single- blind,  parallel,  randomised  controlled 
trial will explore the combined effects of breathing 
exercises, foot reflexology and back massage (BRM) 
on pain and anxiety during labour in healthy primi-
gravidae with a singleton fetus.

 ► The  effects  of  BRM  will  also  be  examined  through 
objective physiological measurement of stress hor-
mone levels and comparison of these levels between 
groups before and after the intervention.

 ► The intervention will be applied for 1 hour and only 
once  during  the  first  stage  of  labour  after  cervical 
dilatation of 6 cm.

 ► Blinding of the primigravidae mothers is not possi-
ble, and there may be bias in the self- assessed sub-
jective outcomes such as the Visual Analogue Scale.
 ► The expertise and experience of the nursing gradu-
ates who are trained to be the massage therapists 
is  considered  an  important  factor  in  the  quality  of 
treatment provided and this may underestimate the 
effect of BRM.

IntroduCtIon
Many primigravidae have reported experiencing various 
levels  of  pain  during  labour  and  high  levels  of  anxiety 
about the labour process and its outcomes.1–3Anxiety esca-
lating to fear is a common issue related to labour, espe-
cially  among  primigravidae.4  5  Other  recorded  negative 
perceptions and psychological effects influencing labour 
experiences include distress and feelings of powerlessness 
during labour for women and their families.5–7

When poorly managed, labour pain may lead to severe 
consequences  for  women,  such  as  prolonged  labour,5  8 
which may increase the risk of fetal distress, head compres-
sion, intrauterine fetal death, low Apgar scores and phys-
ical  injuries  to  neonates.5  9  Prolonged  labour  results  in 
increased risk of caesarean section, induced labour and 
assisted  delivery  using  vacuum  and  forceps.10  11  Studies 
have  also  reported  negative  mental  impacts  on  women, 
sometimes even including postnatal post- traumatic stress 
disorder,12  13  and  subsequently  reduced  quality  of  life.14 
Feelings of anxiety often originate from possible birthing 
complications about which pregnant women have heard 
and read,4 5 15 16 and may even result in women refusing 
normal vaginal delivery and insisting on caesarean sections 
without  medical  indications.17  It  is  therefore  important 
for  healthcare  professionals  to  assist  and  educate  all 
expectant mothers on labour pain management.

Appropriate  labour  pain  management  and  interven-
tions  are  important  aspects  of  obstetric  care  to  ensure 
optimum outcomes for mothers and babies.18 Pharmaco-
logical interventions used in the management of labour 
pain  include  systemic  sedatives,  analgesics  and  regional 
anaesthesia.19  Examples  of  these  analgesics  are  aerosol 
and epidural opioids, intramuscular pethidine (IMP) and 
intravenous  sedatives.20  21  Some  of  these  are  expensive 
and  may  be  associated  with  adverse  effects  on  mothers, 
the labour process and neonates.22 In contrast, most non- 
pharmacological  methods  for  labour  pain  management 
are simple and non- invasive, and are often cheaper and 
safer  than  pharmacological  interventions.23–25  Studies 
have found that non- pharmacological approaches, partic-
ularly breathing exercises, have positive impacts on relief 
of labour pain,26–28 and anxiety in pregnant mothers.29–31 
This  is  especially  true  for  Lamaze  breathing,  deep 
breathing exercises,26–28 32 33 reflexology6 34 and massage.35 
linked 
Non- pharmacological  approaches  have  been 
to  shorter  labour  duration,36  and  improved  newborn 
outcomes.37  Our  systematic  review  found  that  massage 
is beneficial for relieving labour pain,38 and is associated 
with greater relaxation, higher alertness levels, improved 
mood and reduced stress hormone (cortisol) levels and 
anxiety symptoms.39

rationale
It is hypothesised that the non- pharmacological approach 
of labour pain management occurs via the alteration of 
nociceptive  stimuli  and  modification  of  the  processing 
of  nociceptive  input  at  the  central  level,  resulting  in 
an  overall  improved  sense  of  comfort  and  well- being,

ultimately leading to stronger coping capabilities by the 
mothers in labour.40

The physiological mechanism of breathing is a protec-
tive action as it is a fight- or- flight reflex triggered by the 
central  nervous  system.  Physiologically,  deep  abdominal 
breathing stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system. 
As a result, the blood circulation in pregnant women will 
undergo  oxygenation,  which  will  trigger  the  release  of 
endorphins  associated  with  decrease  in  heart  rate  and 
increase in feelings of calmness. At the same time, endor-
phins can also suppress the sympathetic system, leading 
to  a  decrease  in  the  release  of  stress  hormones  such  as 
cortisol.41 42

As for reflexology, so far there has been no constructive 
explanation  of  the  underlying  mechanism  in  reducing 
labour pain.6 36 The reflexology therapist will apply pres-
sure  three  times  on  specific  points  of  the  feet  that  are 
energetically  connected  to  certain  parts  and  organs  of 
the  body.  As  with  skin- to- skin  contact  during  massage, 
reflexology  point  pressure  could  trigger  the  release  of 
endogenous  endorphins  and  encephalins  that  help  to 
reduce labour pain, stress, fatigue and anxiety.43–46 Pres-
sure on the solar plexus at the border of the upper and 
middle  one- third  of  the  sole  is  believed  to  facilitate  the 
functions of the body’s nervous system.47 Pressure on the 
lower  part  of  the  forefoot  reflects  the  heart  and  lungs. 
While pressure on the bridge of the foot reflects the liver 
and  kidney,  the  heel  will  reflect  the  lower  back,  legs, 
pelvic region uterus and intestines. The uterine point is 
believed  to  be  located  in  the  indented  region  between 
the inner ankles and the sole.48 Therefore, it is believed 
to be helpful during labour. The pressure on toe and heel 
stimulate the reflex points in the pelvis. It is effective by 
releasing the oxytocin hormone which start and regulate 
the uterine contractions and relax during contractions.49
However,  there  are  several  postulated  theories  for  its 
mechanism of action. First, the autonomic–somatic inte-
gration  theory  suggests  that  the  pressure  applied  to  the 
feet  during  reflexology  compresses  the  receptors  in  the 
cells, thus opening up the ionic channels in the plasma 
membrane and triggering a local action with the poten-
tial to convey messages to the spinal cord and/or brain.46 
The  application  of  alternating  pressure  to  the  feet  may 
also  produce  predictable  reflexive  actions  within  the 
nervous system and activate the parasympathetic nervous 
system.50  Based  on  the  energy  theory  that  posits  that 
energy  moves  towards  the  head  from  reflex  points  that 
stimulate  the  neural  paths,  improve  blood  flow,  release 
the endorphins and relief pain.51 Another contemporary 
method  explains  that  reflexology  acts  through  ‘sympa-
thetic resonance’, in which an energy wave flows between 
therapist  and  client,  promoting  homeostatic  balance.52 
This  may  occur  through  local  enzymatic  reactions  on 
receptive fields or through an improved blood supply as 
a result of local skin temperature changes following the 
skin- to- skin contact.47 Reflexologists also believe that the 
application of deep pressure on certain reflex points of 
the sole and palm may break any calcium crystals and uric

acid accumulated in nerve endings that may cause block-
ages and induce pain.53

Reflexology  also  results  in  body  relaxation  and  stimu-
lation  of  any  blocked  nerve  endings,  which  may  propel 
any sluggish glands or organs to regain their normal func-
tioning.54 Ambiguity remains regarding the theories and 
mechanism of action of foot reflexology for labour pain, 
as compared with that for general pain.6 35 36 Nonetheless, 
it is plausible to believe that reflexology techniques would 
have similar physiological effects for labour pain that bring 
about  a  sense  of  well- being,  analgesia  and  subsequently 
the perception of pain relief.37 Figure 1 summarises the 
possible mechanisms of reflexology therapy.

Massage  therapy  is  another  type  of  commonly  used 
complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for the 
promotion of health and well- being.35 Massage is a potent 
mechanical stimulus that produces a short- lived analgesic 
effect by activating the ‘pain gate’ mechanism.55 Longer 
lasting  pain  control  appears  to  be  mediated  mainly  by 

the  descending  pain  suppression  mechanism  by  activa-
tion  of  descending  efferent  pathways.56  The  inhibition 
of  pain- transmission  neurons  involves  a  combination 
of  physiological  and  neurological  mechanisms  and  it  is 
commonly  activated  by  noxious  stimulation.57  Figure  2 
summarises the possible mechanisms action of massage 
therapy.58

The  three  aforementioned  therapies  (ie,  breathing 
exercises,  foot  reflexology  and  backmassage  (BRM)) 
for labour pain management have been shown to influ-
ence  the  secretion  of  certain  stress  hormones  such  as 
cortisol,  adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH)39  59 
oxytocin (OT),59 and possibly also the endorphins.44 45 
Endogenous oxytocin is a key component in the molec-
ular pathways that buffer reaction to stress and decrease 
sensitivity  to  pain  and  inflammation60;  cortisol  is 
an 
important  hormone  released  during  stressful 
conditions.39

significance of this clinical trial
Many studies have reported that not all pharmacological 
and non- pharmacological methods on their own are able 
to reduce labour pain satisfactorily. Despite the interven-
tion,  some  mothers  still  endure  some  pain,  anxiety  and 
prolonged  labour,  and  suffer  from  negative  maternal 
and  perinatal  consequences.5  15  16  From  the  perspective 
of complementary management, BRM are the techniques 
with the highest potential for managing pain and anxiety 
for primigravidae. Systematic reviews have concluded that 
CAM  interventions  to  manage  pain  and  anxiety  during 
labour have often been biased and/or poorly executed, 
thus  resulting  in  low  quality  of  evidence,61–64  or  no 
strongly  supported  evidence.65–67  Therefore,  there  is  a 
need for a rigorous and robust trial to examine the effect 
of  the  combined  intervention  of  BRM  on  labour  pain, 
anxiety, stress hormones, vital signs (V/S), fetal heart rate 
(FHR),  duration  of  labour,  Apgar  scores  and  maternal 
satisfaction among the primigravidae using multiple rele-
vant outcome measures.

MEthods And dEsIgn
This study aims to investigate the combined effect of BRM 
on labour pain, duration of labour, anxiety, maternal satis-
faction,  stress  hormones  and  newborn  outcome  among 
primigravidae  in  Saudi  Arabia.  The  specific  objectives 
are (1) to compare the effect of the combined breathing 
exercise,  foot  reflexology  and  back  massage  (interven-
tion)  on  labour  pain  intensity,  anxiety  level,  duration 
of  labour,  maternal  satisfaction,  stress  hormones  and 
neonatal outcome compared with the standard midwifery 
care  (control);  (2)  to  identify  the  predictors  of  pain, 
anxiety, duration of labour, the satisfaction of mother and 
neonatal  outcome  from  the  baseline  sociodemographic 
and obstetric characteristics.

study design
The  study  design  will  be  a  single- blind  parallel 
randomised controlled trial (RCT), in which participants 
are  randomly  assigned  to  receive  either  the  BRM  inter-
vention or control care.

study setting
This study will be conducted in the Makkah Maternity and 
Children Hospital (MCH) in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. The 
hospital is a tertiary- level, governmental referral hospital 
with  special  services  for  paediatrics,  gynaecology  and 
obstetrics.68 In Saudi Arabia, almost all tertiary hospitals, 
including our study site, offer systemic pharmacological 
agents,  either  intravenous  or  intramuscular  analgesics 
to  manage  pain  during  labour69;  however,  providing 
non- invasive  and  non- pharmacological  methods  of  pain 
relief  during  labour  is  not  common  practices.69  To  our 
best  knowledge,  the  combined  effect  of  BRM  on  primi-
gravidae  has  not  been  investigated  at  any  Saudi  Arabia 
hospital prior to this trial.

Participants
The  study  participants  will  include  primigravidae,  age 
20–35  years  old,  at  37–41  weeks  of  gestation,  and  in 
the  first  stage  of  labour.  The  inclusion  criteria  include 
singleton  pregnancy,  cephalic  presentation  and  regular 
contraction. In labour, the participants must achieve 6 cm 
of cervical dilatation, with a minimum of three contrac-
tions of at least moderate intensity every 10 min, in which 
the duration of the contraction must be between 30 s and 
60 s.

The exclusion criteria include diagnosis of underlying 
chronic  diseases  such  as  cardiovascular  disease,  kidney 
disease,  diabetes,  asthma,  mental  health  disorders, 
epilepsy  or  seizure;  pregnancy- related  diseases  such  as 
gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, cephalo- pelvic dispro-
portion,  polyhydramnios  or  oligohydramnios  or  deep 
venous thrombosis; and pregnancy complications such as 
placenta praevia, antepartum haemorrhage, fetal distress 
or being put on analgesics other than IMP.

recruitment
Recruitment  will  be  conducted  at  the  antenatal  clinic 
at  the  trial  site.  Only  those  who  plan  to  deliver  in  the 
trial hospital’s delivery room will be further briefed and 
assessed  for  their  eligibility.  At  this  hospital,  antenatal 
mothers are given monthly follow- up appointments until 
28 weeks’ gestation. The frequency increases to biweekly 
until  32  weeks’  gestation;  then  patients  are  seen  weekly 
until delivery.

For this study, we will approach primigravidae between 
26  weeks  and  34  weeks  of  gestation  in  equal  numbers 
based on the gestational weeks. This means that about an 
equal number of primigravidae at week of gestation of 26, 
28, 30, 32 and 34 will be recruited in order to spread out 
the occurrence of labour in the subsequent 2–3 months to 
increase the feasibility of the BRM intervention. Because 
participant recruitment and the training of the research 
team  members  are  estimated  to  last  up  to  2–3 months, 
women of 34+ weeks gestation cannot be recruited during 
this  period  because  they  will  inevitably  go  into  labour 
before the research preparations are complete.

At  the  antenatal  clinic,  the  principal  investigator  will 
provide  general  health  education  about  pain  manage-
ment during labour. The participant information sheet of 
this RCT will be provided for the eligible patients. If they 
are  interested  in  participating,  they  will  sign  a  written 
consent form and will be identified by a unique stamp on 
their antenatal cards. When the participants arrive in the 
labour room for delivery, they will be re- evaluated for the 
eligibility.

randomisation
Since IMP is a commonly prescribed analgesic in labour 
and  may  have  substantial  effects  on  the  primigravidae 
and neonates, randomisation will be stratified according 
to  the  administrative  status  of  IMP.  This  will  ensure  the 
same numbers of primigravidae with and without IMP in 
the intervention and control groups. To achieve this, we

use a block of size 4 with a 1:1 allocation ratio, leading to a 
possibility of 6 permutations. All possible block sequences 
will be randomly generated with the help of free software

simple- randomiser/ v1/.  A  random  list  will  be  created 
after  the  sample  size  number,  treatment  groups,  block 
sizes, list length and stratification factors are entered into 
the software. The order of the subjects will be used by the 
research coordinator who will be stationed in the delivery 
room to conduct the random group allocation for primi-
gravidae in labour who have achieved a cervical dilation 
of  6 cm.  The  principal  investigator,  outcome  assessors 
and  massage  therapist  in  this  trial  will  not  be  involved 
in  the  allocation  of  the  interventional  groups.  Figure  3 

outlines the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 
flow diagram.

data collection
Every questionnaire will be coded with a unique number. 
Data  collection  in  the  delivery  room  will  be  facilitated 
by  the  trained  research  coordinator  and  two  outcome 
assessors.  The  outcome  assessors  will  be  assigned  to  the 
control or the intervention group on the same day. Once 
the form is completed by the outcome assessors, it will be 
kept by the research coordinator in a safe location in the 
delivery room.

Throughout all of the outcome assessment time points, 
a massage therapist will be present in the delivery room of

both the intervention and control groups. For the inter-
vention  group,  the  primigravidae  in  labour  will  receive 
the  BRM  intervention  from  the  massage  therapist.  For 
the  control  group,  the  practicing  midwife  will  perform 
routine labour care such as touch therapy, ensuring that 
the mother lies on her left side, and providing encourage-
ment and counselling. The outcome assessor will measure 
and  assess  both  the  intervention  and  control  groups  at 
the same time points. Both groups will be equipped with 
similar extra equipment. This blinding effort is intended 
to  minimise  biases  during  the  outcome  assessment. 
However, blinding of the participants will be impossible 
due to the nature of the intervention.

Interventions
The BRM intervention consists of 5 min of breathing exer-
cise followed by 10 min of foot reflexology on each sole 
and 35 min of continuous massage over the lower limbs 
and  back.  The  massage  therapist  will  allow  the  primi-
gravidae to lie on the left side,70 to move and change her 
position during the intervention and answer any question 
or inquiry. Table 1 provides a detailed explanation of the 
BRM  intervention  procedure.  As  for  the  control  group, 
the  primigravidae  in  labour  will  receive  routine  labour 
room care.

training for the research team members
A  total  of  13  research  assistants  will  be  recruited  and 
trained  for  the  intervention  and  data  collection  from 
June to December 2019, (figure 4). They will be given the 
BRM training for 1 week by the principal investigator who 
has completed the professional massage and reflexology 
training  at  a  certified  training  centre  in  Malaysia  (Tim 
Body  Care  Training  Centre  1403695- D)  for  6 months 
including training and working.

study outcomes and measures
There  are  eight  outcomes:  two  primary  outcomes  and 
six secondary outcomes. The two primary outcomes are 
pain intensity and anxiety level (see table 2). Pain inten-
sity  is  measured  with  the  Present  Behavioural  Inten-
sity  (PBI)71  72  and  the  self- report  Visual  Analogue  Scale 
(VAS),73–77 while anxiety is measure with Anxiety Assess-
ment Scale for Pregnant Women in Labour (AASPWL).78
The  outcome  assessor  will  ask  the  pregnant  women 
to pick a colour on an A-4 sized paper that contains six 
different coloured parts, from no pain (score 1) to most 
severe pain (score 6) based on her level of pain.76 79 The 
researcher  selected  the  VAS  questionnaire  because  it  is 
an  acceptable  tool  and  relatively  easy  to  administer  to 
women in labour. Pain intensity will be measured at base-
line  before  the  intervention,  and  multiple  times  during 
and after contractions (figure 5A). During the interven-
tion, pain intensity will be measured after the breathing 
exercise  and  foot  reflexology  therapy  (after  25 min 
from the start of the intervention), followed by another 
assessment  halfway  through  the  massage  therapy  (after 
45 min) during and after contraction. Pain intensity will

be  measured  for  every  participating  primigravidae  in 
both the intervention and control group. For the control 
group,  pain  intensity  will  be  measured  first  at  baseline 
before the intervention at 6 cm. During the intervention, 
pain intensity will be measured after 25 min from the start 
of the intervention time, followed by another assessment 
after  45 min,  during  and  after  contraction.  On  comple-
tion of the intervention, the measurement will be taken 
immediately, and twice hourly thereafter during the first 
stage of labour (figure 5B).

The  AASPWL  will  be  used  to  assess  anxiety  during 
labour. The anxiety level will be measured at cervical dila-
tation of 6 cm, after the completion of the interventions, 
and  twice  every  60 min  during  the  first  stage  of  labour. 
For the control group, the assessment will be performed 
when the cervix is at 6 cm, after 1 hour (synchronised to 
the  completion  of  the  intervention  in  the  intervention 
group),  and  twice  every  60 min  during  the  first  stage  of 
labour (figure 5B).

The secondary outcomes measured in the RCT include 
maternal  stress  hormones  level,  maternal  V/S,  FHR, 
duration  of  labour,  neonatal  Apgar  score  and  maternal 
satisfaction80 (see table 3).

The  stress  hormones  level  will  be  measured  at  base-
line,  and  again  one  and  a  half  hour  after  the  patient 
has reached 6 cm of cervical dilatation (figure 5). Blood 
samples  will  again  be  taken  by  midwives  on  duty  in  the 
delivery  room.  This  will  occur  after  the  BRM  interven-
tion  in  the  intervention  group  (figure  5A),  and  at  the 
same time in the control group (figure 5B). The research 
assessors  will  collect  an  8 mL  blood  sample  in  a  plain 
tube, of which 3 mL is for ACTH, 3 mL for cortisol and 
2  mL  for  OT  hormones;  it  will  be  sent  immediately  to 
the MCH laboratory to carefully avoid any haemolysis of 
the samples. Hormones will be analysed by the sandwich 
ELISA  technique  using  commercial  kits  by  Cobas  e411 
Analyzer  (HITACHI,  USA)  for  ACTH  hormone,  and 

Open access

Abbot Architect I200 Analyzer (Abbott, USA) for Cortisol 
and OT hormones.

Since cortisol levels follow a diurnal variation or circa-
dian  rhythm  where  the  hormone  levels  peak  in  the 
morning and fall at night, and vary in accordance with a 
number of factors including age, time of day, stress level, 
sample  type,  laboratory  location  and  the  method  used 
for testing,81 82 we will use a chart from the laboratory to 
verify  the  normal  cortisol  range  in  the  morning,  noon, 
afternoon, evening or night, and compare these ranges to 
the blood samples taken to determine whether the blood 
test results of the participants before and after the inter-
vention are high, normal or low.

ACTH  and  cortisol  levels  are  interrelated.  When  the 
cortisol  levels  are  at  their  peak,  ACTH  levels  generally 
fall  and  vice  versa.83  Hence,  it  may  be  understood  that 
ACTH and cortisol have corresponding levels at any given 
point of time. This provides a relative value for both stress 
hormones. With regard to OT, the blood sample test for 
the pregnant woman will be higher if she receives an infu-
sion of OT during intervention.84 85 If the events are equal 
in both groups, we will proceed to the analysis as planned. 
If  the  events  are  many  and  unequal  in  both  groups,  we 
will either conduct a separate statistical analysis stratified 
according to the event of OT infusion. If the number of 
event  occurrences  is  low,  we  may  exclude  these  partici-
pants and analyse the outcome as planned. However, the 
author will investigate the oxytocin level before and after 
applying  the  BRM  in  addition  to  childbirth.  Oxytocin 
increases  with  contraction  and  hypothetically  with  and 
after BRM. The oxytocin will increase in the second stage, 
inhibit the stress hormones, and will increase after apply 
the BRM.

Maternal V/S and FHR will be collected twice at 6 cm 
cervical  dilatation  and  immediately  post- BRM  for  the 
intervention group, and the same data will be collected 
at  the  same  timing  for  the  control  groups.  The  Apgar 
Scores  (taken  from  the  delivery  room  medical  record) 
and  maternal  satisfaction  will  be  measured  only  once 
at the completion of the childbirth, before the transfer 
of the mother from the delivery room to the postnatal 
ward.

sample size
The  sample  size  estimation  was  based  on  a  review  of 
similar  literature  on  pain  and  anxiety  as  outcomes,  and 
calculated  using  G*power  free  software.86  We  estimated 
an effect size of 0.6 on anxiety mean score reduction in 
the  intervention  group  compared  with  the  control,86  as 
this  gives  a  larger  required  sample  size  compared  with 
that  based  on  the  primary  outcome  of  pain.  Thus,  with 
the  power  of  95%  at  α  error  0.05,  the  required  sample 
size is 128 for the two groups. It is further inflated to 154 
to account for a predicted 20% attrition rate. Therefore, 
a minimum number of 77 primigravidae will be recruited 
for each group.

statistical analysis
Data will be entered by a blinded enumerator. The data-
base  will  be  checked  for  accuracy  before  analysis.  The 
principal investigator has the overall responsibility for the 
compilation, maintenance and management of the study 
database. The analysis will be performed using IBM Statis-
tical Package for Social Science V.25.

Descriptive statistical analysis will be performed according 
to the distribution of the data, using means and SD for data 
with  normal  distribution,  and  median  and  IQRs  for  data 
that  are  not  normally  distributed.  Normality  testing  will 
be conducted for all continuous variables using different 
methods such as Histogram and p–p plot. Categorical vari-
ables will be reported in frequencies and percentages.

The  differences  between  the  groups  and  times  level 
will be analysed using a generalised linear mixed model 
(GLMM). GLMM is appropriate where repeated measure-
ments are made on the same statistical units. GLMM will 
also be used to accommodate non- normal distribution in 
outcome data. The variables of time in a categorical form, 
intervention group, group*time interaction and the base-
line  random  part  of  the  model  will  include  a  random 
intercept and an unstructured correlation matrix for the 
correlation  of  measurements  within  pregnant  women. 
The  fixed  part  of  the  model  will  include  pain  score, 
whereby the difference in pain score at every time point 
will be tested using a linear contrast. We will take the pain 

intensity measured with PBI and VAS at 1 hour post inter-
vention as the main coprimary outcomes. This is because 
the  effects  of  the  massage  and  reflexology  will  still  be 
observable, and thus the intervention group can be fairly 
compared with the control group.46 50–53

Any significant baseline imbalances will be adjusted for 
in the analysis. If necessary, multiple imputations will be 
conducted for the missing data. A calculated 95% CI and 
two- sided  α  of  0.05  will  be  used  to  test  significance.  In 
addition,  we  will  analyse  PBI  and  VAS  at  the  same  time 
points and measure the agreement between PBI and VAS 
by using the Spearman correlation coefficient and inter-
class  correlation.  We  will  analyse  other  outcomes  using

dIsCussIon
Safe  and  efficient  pain  management  is  important  for 
pregnant women and their families,18 and different types 
of  CAM  have  been  shown  to  be  beneficial  to  reduce 
or  alleviate  labour  pain.  However,  evidence  is  scarce 
regarding  the  effects  of  combined  therapies.87  There-
fore,  we  designed  this  trial  to  study  the  effects  of  BRM 
on  labour  pain  and  other  psychological  and  physiolog-
ical  impacts  among  primigravidae.  The  study  protocol 
for the RCT is to determine the combined effect of BRM 
on the intensity of pain and level of anxiety in primigrav-
idae during the first stage of labour. Additional outcomes 
that  will  be  assessed  include  stress  hormones,  maternal 
V/S,  FHR,  duration  labour,  neonatal  Apgar  score  and 
maternal satisfaction.

In this study, the intervention will be applied only once 
and only during the first stage of labour even though the 
first  stage  of  labour  among  primigravidae  takes  approx-
imately  8–12 hours.  By  timing  the  intervention  after 
cervical dilation of 6 cm, the effect of the combined BRM 
could exert its greatest influences (if any) on the labour 
experience of the primigravidae and neonatal outcome, 
because this period is believed to accompany the highest 
levels of labour pain.88 89

We will assess the outcomes using a mixture of subjec-
tive and objective tools. For example, pain intensity and 
anxiety levels are subjective measurements, based on the 
personal  feelings  and  judgments  of  the  respondents. 
Duration  of  labour,  neonatal  Apgar  score  and  maternal

stress  hormones  level  of  ACTH,  cortisol  and  oxytocin 
are  objective  measurements  that  will  indicate  the  stress 
response  to  the  BRM  intervention  conducted  on  the 
primigravidae. This is one of the strengths of our study.

VAS  is  one  of  several  ways  of  measuring  the  effective-
ness  of  BRM,  and  is  a  commonly  used  graphic  rating 
method.70  78However,  VAS  might  not  be  the  gold  stan-
dard to measure labour pain, given the inconsistency of 
its results and its ceiling effect.78 90Recognising this inad-
equacy,  we  will  ensure  that  the  participants  understand 
the VAS scoring at admission to the delivery room before 
they  are  asked  to  indicate  their  pain  level  later.  Labour 
pain  outcome  will  also  be  measured  via  pain  inten-
sity  assessment  using  the  PBI,74  which  will  be  rated  by 
outcome assessors. Multiple measurements will be taken 
during  and  after  contraction,  and  before  and  after  the 
intervention. There will also be other outcomes, related 
to  maternal  response  to  pain,  namely  anxiety  level  and 
maternal stress hormones.91

This study has several other limitations. First, the inter-
vention will be performed for 1 hour, during which it may 
be  interrupted  by  routine  medical  care  such  as  regular 
vaginal examinations, V/S measurements and FHR moni-
toring. However, we believe that this will not reduce the 
effect of the BRM intervention, because we can start the 
BRM before or after the labour care routine. Second, the 
process  of  labour  and  birthing  is  unpredictable  even  if 
the participants are at low risk. In certain instances, the 
process of the intervention might not go well as planned 
and this may reduce the sample size. Some patients may 
end up needing a caesarean section, and some may suffer 
from  other  obstetric  complications  during  delivery.  As 
a  result,  we  have  inflated  the  sample  size  accordingly. 
Third,  the  results  from  this  study  will  not  be  generalis-
able  to  multigravidae  as  we  include  only  primigravidae. 
Nevertheless,  we  believe  that  primigravidae  will  benefit 
the most from the intervention as they are likely to expe-
rience a higher level of labour pain and a longer duration 

Baljon KJ, et al. BMJ Open 2020;10:e033844. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033844of labour compared with multigravidae. Fourth, placebo 
effects  can  influence  patient  outcomes  after  (CAM), 
resulting in high rates of good outcomes, which may be 
wrongly attributed to specific treatment effects.92

We recognise that the expertise and experience level of 
the reflexologist is an important factor in the quality of 
treatment provided and this may affect the outcomes of 
the BRM. The massage therapists and the outcome asses-
sors  will  be  given  the  appropriate  training  on  the  BRM 
for  1 week  by  the  principal  investigator  who  attended  a 
professional training and was certified. After the training, 
they will be tested in a pilot study to ensure their compe-
tency in performing the BRM. Additional quality control 
measures for the outcome assessors are planned, as they 
will  be  assigned  to  the  control  delivery  room  or  the 
intervention  delivery  room  on  the  same  day.  All  of  the 
completed assessment forms will be reviewed and kept by 
the research coordinator in a safe location in the delivery 
room.  Any  issues  on  the  form  such  as  blank  spaces  and 
extreme values will be immediately clarified and resolved.
In  addition  to  labour  pain,  this  study  will  assess  the 
anxiety  level  of  pregnant  mothers.  Unlike  labour  pain, 
anxiety  level  can  be  affected  by  individual  characteris-
tics,  previous  life  experiences  and  other  environmental 
causes.93  However,  we  believe  that  these  factors  will  not 
play a significant role after effective randomisation.

Apart from the actual labour experience, there are a few 
other external factors that may affect maternal satisfaction, 
such as the delivery room services, the health of the baby, 
the gender of the child, family support and other psycho-
social  factors.  As  satisfaction  is  a  multidimensional  and 
complex feeling, it is difficult to measure with a single tool 
and to narrow it down to only the first stage of labour.

It is understood that a birthing process is a natural event, 
especially  for  low- risk  women.  Thus,  the  management 
of  labour  should  be  conducted  in  a  supportive  manner 
with minimal or no interferences. This study will provide 
high- quality evidence about the effects of the combined 
BRM for labour pain management. These findings will be 
important  for  hospitals  offerings  for  expectant  mothers 
in providing a rationale for their decisions about which 
alternative treatments to offer, to primigravidae and their 
family  members  during  decision- making  about  labour 
pain management.
