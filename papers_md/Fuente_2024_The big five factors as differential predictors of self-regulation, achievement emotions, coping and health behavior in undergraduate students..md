Abstract
Background  The aim of this research was to analyze whether the personality factors included in the Big Five model 
differentially predict the self-regulation and affective states of university students and health.

Methods  A total of 637 students completed validated self-report questionnaires. Using an ex post facto design, we 
conducted linear regression and structural prediction analyses.

Results  The findings showed that model factors were differential predictors of both self-regulation and affective 
states. Self-regulation and affective states, in turn, jointly predict emotional performance while learning and even 
student health. These results allow us to understand, through a holistic predictive model, the differential predictive 
relationships of all the factors: conscientiousness and extraversion were predictors regulating positive emotionality 
and health; the openness to experience factor was non-regulating; nonregulating; and agreeableness and 
neuroticism were dysregulating, hence precursors of negative emotionality and poorer student health.

Conclusions  These results are important because they allow us to infer implications for guidance and psychological 
health at university.

RESEARCHOpen AccessIntroduction
The personality characteristics of students have proven to 
be  essential  explanatory  and  predictive  factors  of  learn-
ing behavior and performance at universities [1–4]. How-
ever, our knowledge about such factors does not exhaust 
further questions, such as which personality factors tend 
toward the regulation of learning behavior and which do 
not? Or can personality factors be arranged on a contin-
uum to understand student differences in their emotions 
when  learning?  Consequently,  the  aim  of  this  study  was 
to  analyze  whether  students’  personality  traits  differen-
tially predict the regulation of behavior and emotionality. 
These  variables  align  as  different  motivational-affective 
profiles  of  students,  through  the  type  of  achievement 
emotions  they  experience  during  study,  as  well  as  their 
coping  strategies,  motivational  state,  and  ultimately 
health.

Five-factor model

Previous  research  has  shown  the  value  and  consistency 
of the five-factor model for analyzing students’ personal-
ity traits. Pervin, Cervone, and John [5] defined five fac-
tors as follows: (1) Conscientiousness includes a sense of 
duty,  persistence,  and  behavior  that  is  self-disciplined 
and  goal-directed.  The  descriptors  organized,  respon-
sible,  and  efficient  are  typically  used  to  describe  consci-
entious persons. (2) Extraversion is characterized by the 
quantity  and  intensity  of  interpersonal  relationships,  as 
well as sensation seeking. The descriptors sociable, asser-
tive,  and  energetic  are  typically  used  to  describe  extra-
verted  persons.  (3)  Openness  to  experience  incorporates 
autonomous  thinking  and  willingness  to  examine  unfa-
miliar ideas and try new things. The descriptors inquisi-
tive,  philosophical,  and  innovative  are  typically  used  to 
describe  persons  open  to  experience.  (4)  Agreeableness 
is quantified along a continuum from  social  antagonism 
to  compassion  in  one’s  quality  of  interpersonal  interac-
tions.  The  descriptors  inquisitive,  kind,  considerate,  and 
generous are often used to describe persons characterized 
by  agreeableness.  (5)  Finally,  neuroticism  tends  to  indi-
cate negative emotions. Persons showing neuroticism are 
often described as moody, nervous, or touchy.

This  construct  has  appeared  to  consistently  predict 
individual differences between university students. Prior 
research  has  documented  its  essential  role  in  explaining 
differences in achievement [6, 7], motivational states [8], 
students’ learning approaches [9], self-regulated learning 
[10].

Five-factor model, self-regulation, achievement emotions 
and health

The  relationship  between  the  Big  Five  factors  and  self-
regulation  has  been  analyzed  historically  with  much 
interest [11–15]. The dimensions of the five-factor model 

Page 2 of 11

describe  fundamental  ways  in  which  people  differ  from 
one  another  [16,  17].  Of  the  five  factors,  conscientious-
ness may be the best reflection of self-regulation capacity. 
More  recent  research  has  shown  consistent  evidence  of 
the relationship between these two constructs, especially 
conscientiousness, which has a positive relationship, and 
neuroticism, which has a negative relationship with self-
regulation [18, 19]. The Big Five factors are also related to 
coping strategies [20].

The  evidence  on  the  role  of  the  five-factor  model  in 
self-regulation,  achievement  emotions,  and  health  has 
been  fairly  consistent.  On  the  one  hand,  self-regulation 
has a confirmed role as a meta-cognitive variable that is 
present  in  students’  mental  health  problems  [21].  Simi-
larly, personality factors and types of perfectionism have 
been associated with mental health in university students 
[22]. In a complementary fashion, one longitudinal study 
has shown that personality factors have a persistent effect 
on self-regulation and health. Sirois and Hirsch [23] con-
firmed  that  the  Big  Five  traits  affect  balance  and  health 
behaviors.

Self-regulation, achievement emotions and health

Self-regulation  has  recently  been  considered  a  signifi-
cant behavioral meta-ability that regulates other skills in 
the university environment. It has consistently appeared 
to  be  a  predictor  of  achievement  emotions  [24],  cop-
ing strategies [25], and health behavior [26]. In the con-
text  of  university  learning,  the  level  of  self-regulation  is 
a determining factor in learning approaches, motivation 
and  achievement  [27].  Similarly,  the  self-  vs.  externally 
regulated behavior theory [27, 28] assumes that the con-
tinuum of self-regulation can be divided into three types: 
(1)  self-regulation  behavior,  which  is  the  meta-behavior 
or  meta-skill  of  planning  and  executing  control  over 
one’s  behavior;  (2)  nonregulation  behavior  (deregula-
tion), where consistent self-regulating behavior is absent; 
and  (3)  nonregulation  behavior,  when  regulatory  behav-
ior is maladaptive or contrary to what is expected. Some 
example  behaviors  are  presented  below,  and  these  have 
already  been  documented  (see  Table  1).  Recently,  Beau-
lieu and collaborators [29] proposed a self-dysregulation 
latent  profile  for  describing  subjects  with  lower  scores 
on  subscales  regarding  extraversion,  agreeableness  and 
conscientiousness and higher scores concerning negative 
emotional facets.
Table 1 here.
Consequently, the question that we pose - as yet unre-
solved - is whether the different personality factors pre-
dict a determined type of regulation on the continuum of 
regulatory behavior, nonregulatory (deregulatory) behav-
ior and dysregulatory behavior, based on evidence.

Aims and hypotheses

Based on the existing evidence, the aim of this study was 
to  establish  a  structural  predictive  model  that  would 
order personality factors along a continuum as predictors 
of university students’ regulatory behavior. The following 
hypotheses were proposed for this purpose: (1) personal-
ity factors differentially predict students’ regulatory, non-
regulatory  and  dysregulatory  behavior  during  academic 
learning;  they  also  differentially  determine  students’ 
type of emotional states (positive vs. negative affect); (2) 
the  preceding  factors  differentially  predict  achievement 
emotions  (positive  vs.  negative)  during  learning,  coping 
strategies  (problem-focused  vs.  emotion-focused)  and 
motivational  state  (engagement  vs.  burnout);  and  (3)  all 
these  factors  ultimately  predict  student  health,  either 
positively or negatively, depending on their regulatory or 
dysregulatory nature.

Method
Participants

Data  were  gathered  from  2019  to  2022,  encompassing 
a  total  of  626  undergraduate  students  enrolled  in  Psy-
chology,  Primary  Education,  and  Educational  Psychol-
ogy  programs  across  two  Spanish  universities.  Within 
this  cohort,  85.5%  were  female,  and  14.5%  were  male, 
with ages ranging from 19 to 24 years and a mean age of 
21.33 years. The student distribution was equal between 
the  two  universities,  with  324  attending  one  and  318 
attending  the  other.  The  study  employed  an  incidental, 
nonrandomized  design.  The  guidance  departments  at 
both  universities  extended  invitations  for  teacher  par-
ticipation, and teachers, in turn, invited their students to 
partake  voluntarily,  ensuring  anonymity.  Questionnaires 
were completed online for each academic subject, corre-
sponding to the specific teaching-learning process.

Instruments

Five personality factors  The Big Five Questionnaire [30], 
based on the version by Barbaranelli et al. [31], assessed 
scores  for  five  personality  factors.  Confirmatory  factor 
analysis  (CFA)  of  the  67  scale  items  resulted  in  a  five-
factor  structure  aligned  with  the  Big  Five  Model.  The 

outcomes demonstrated satisfactory psychometric prop-
erties  and  acceptable  fit  indices.  The  second-order  con-
firmatory model exhibited a good fit (chi-square = 38.273; 
degrees  of  freedom  (20–15) = 5;  p > 0.10;  chi/df = 7.64; 
IFI = 0.947; 
RMR = 0.0425;  NFI = 0.939;  RFI = 0.917; 
TLI = 0.937;  CFI = 0.946;  RMSEA = 0.065;  HoeLength 
index = 2453 (p < 0.05) and 617 (p < 0.01)). Internal consis-
tency of the total scale was also strong (alpha = 0.956; Part 
1 = 0.932 and Part 2 = 0.832; Spearman-Brown = 0.962 and 
Guttman = 0.932).

Self-Regulation:  The  Short  Self-Regulation  Question-
naire  (SSRQ)  [32]  gauged  self-regulation.  The  Span-
ish  adaptation,  previously  validated  in  Spanish  samples 
[33],  encompassed  four  factors  measured  by  a  total  of 
17 items. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed a con-
sistent  factor  structure  (chi-square = 845.593;  df = 113; 
chi/df = 7.483;  RMSM = 0.0299;  CFI = 0.959,  GFI = 0.94, 
AGFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.059). Validity and reliability val-
ues  (Cronbach’s  alpha)  were  deemed  acceptable  (total 
(α = 0.86;  Omega = 0.843);  goal-setting  planning  (α = 0.79; 
Omega = 0.784);  perseverance  (α = 0.78;  Omega = 0.779); 
decision-making  (α = 0.72;  Omega = 0.718);  and  learning 
from  mistakes  (α = 0.72;  Omega = 0.722)),  comparable  to 
those of the English version. Example statements include: 
“I usually keep track of my progress toward my goals,” “In 
regard to deciding about a change, I feel overwhelmed by 
the choice,” and “I learn from my mistakes.”

Positive-negative affect  The Positive and Negative Affect 
Scale (PANAS-N) [34], validated with university students, 
assessed  positive  and  negative  affect.  The  PANAS  com-
prises two factors and 20 items, demonstrating a consis-
tent confirmatory factor structure (chi-square = 1111.147; 
df = 169;  chi/df = 6.518;  RMSM = 0.0346;  CFI = 0.955, 
GFI = 0.963,  AGFI = 0.96,  RMSEA = 0.058).  Validity 
and  reliability  values  (Cronbach’s  alpha)  were  accept-
able  (total  (α = 0.891;  Omega = 0.857);  positive  affect 
(α = 0.8199; Omega = 0.784); and negative affect (α = 0.795; 
Omega = 0.776),  comparable  to  those  of  the  English  ver-
sion. Sample items include “I am a lively person, I usually 
get excited; I have bad moods (I get upset or irritated).”

Learning Achievement Emotion: The variable was mea-
sured using the Spanish version [35] of the Achievement 
Emotions  Questionnaire  (AEQ-Learning)  [36],  encom-
passing  nine  emotions  (enjoyment,  hope,  pride,  relief, 
anger, anxiety, hopelessness, shame, and boredom). Emo-
tions were classified based on valence (positive or nega-
tive) and activation (activating or deactivating), resulting 
in  four  quadrants.  Another  classification  considered  the 
source  or  trigger:  the  ongoing  activity,  prospective  out-
come, or retrospective outcome. Psychometric properties 
were  adequate,  and  the  confirmatory  model  displayed  a 
good  fit  (chi-square = 529.890;  degrees  of  freedom = 79; 
p > 0.08;  NFI = 0.964; 
chi/df = 6.70; 
CFI = 0.971; 
RFI = 0.957; 
RMSEA = 0.080;  HOELTER = 165 
(p < 0.05)  and  178 
(p < 0.01)).  Good  internal  consistency  was  found  for  the 
total  scale  (Alpha = 0.939;  Part  1 = 0.880,  Part  2 = 0.864; 
Spearman-Brown = 0.913  and  884;  Guttman = 0.903). 
Example items include Item 90: “I am angry when I have 
to  study”;  Item  113:  “My  sense  of  confidence  motivates 
me”; and Item 144: “I am proud of myself ”.

SRMR = 0.053; 
IFI = 0.973; 

TLI = 0.978, 

Engagement-Burnout:  Engagement  was  assessed  using 
a validated Spanish version of the Utrecht Work Engage-
ment Scale for Students [37], demonstrating satisfactory 
psychometric properties for Spanish students. The model 
displayed good fit indices, with a second-order structure 
comprising  three  factors:  vigor,  dedication,  and  absorp-
tion. Scale unidimensionality and metric invariance were 
verified  in  the  samples  assessed  (chi-square = 592.526, 
p > 0.09;  df = 84,  chi/df = 7.05;  SRMR = 0.034;  TLI = 0.976, 
IFI = 0.954,  and  CFI = 0.923;  RMSEA = 0.083;  HOEL-
TER = 153,  p < 0.05;  170  p < 0.01).  Cronbach’s  alpha  for 
this  sample  was  0.900  (14  items);  the  two  parts  of  the 
scale  produced  values  of  0.856  (7  items)  and  0.786  (7 
items).

Burnout:  The  Maslach  Burnout  Inventory  (MBI)  [38], 
in  its  validated  Spanish  version,  was  employed  to  assess 
burnout.  This  version  exhibited  adequate  psychomet-
ric  properties  for  Spanish  students.  Good  fit  indices 
were  obtained,  with  a  second-order  structure  compris-
ing three factors: exhaustion or depletion, cynicism, and 
lack  of  effectiveness.  Scale  unidimensionality  and  met-
ric  invariance  were  confirmed  in  the  samples  assessed 
(chi-square = 567.885,  p > 0.010,  df = 87,  chi/df = 6.52; 
SRMR = 0.054;  CFI = 0.956, 
IFI = 0.951,  TLI = 0.951; 
RMSEA = 0.071;  HOELTER = 224,  p < 0.05;  246  p < 0.01). 
Cronbach’s alpha for this sample was 0.874 (15 items); the 
two  parts  of  the  scale  were  0.853  (8  items)  and  0.793  (7 
items).

Strategies  for  coping  with  academic  stress: The  Coping 
Strategies Scale (Escala Estrategias de Coping - EEC) [39] 
was utilized in its original version. Constructed based on 
the Lazarus and Folkman questionnaire [40] using theo-
retical-rational  criteria,  the  original  90-item  instrument 

IFI = 0.903, 

RFI = 0.945; 

resulted  in  a  64-item  first-order  structure.  The  second-
order  structure  comprised  10  factors  and  two  signifi-
cant  dimensions.  A  satisfactory  fit  was  observed  in  the 
second-order  structure  (chi-square = 478.750;  degrees 
of  freedom = 73,  p > 0.09;  chi/df = 6.55;  RMSR = 0.052; 
NFI = 0.901; 
TLI = 0.951, 
CFI = 0.903).  Reliability  was  confirmed  with  Cronbach’s 
alpha values of 0.93 (complete scale), 0.93 (first half ), and 
0.90  (second  half );  Spearman-Brown  coefficient  of  0.84; 
and Guttman coefficient of 0.80. Two dimensions and 11 
factors  were  identified:  (1)  Dimension:  emotion-focused 
coping—F1.  Fantasy  distraction;  F6.  Help  for  action;  F8. 
Preparing for the worst; F9. Venting and emotional isola-
tion; F11. Resigned acceptance. (2) Dimension: problem-
focused  coping—F2.  Help  seeking  and  family  counsel; 
F10. Self-instructions; F10. Positive reappraisal and firm-
ness;  F12.  Communicating  feelings  and  social  support; 
F13. Seeking alternative reinforcement.

Student  Health  Behavior:  The  Physical  and  Psycho-
social  Health  Inventory  [41]  measured  this  variable, 
summarizing  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO) 
definition of health: “Health is a state of complete physi-
cal,  mental,  and  social  well-being  and  not  merely  the 
absence of disease or infirmity.” The inventory focused on 
the impact of studies, with questions such as “I feel anx-
ious  about  my  studies.”  Students  responded  on  a  Likert 
scale  from  1  (strongly  disagree)  to  5  (strongly  agree).  In 
the Spanish sample, the model displayed good fit indices 
(CFI = 0.95, GFI = 0.96, NFI = 0.94; RMSEA = 0.064), with a 
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.82.

Procedure

informed  consent  before 
All  participants  provided 
engaging in the study. The completion of scales was vol-
untary and conducted through an online platform. Over 
two  academic  years,  students  reported  on  five  distinct 
teaching-learning  processes,  each  corresponding  to  a 
different  university  subject  they  were  enrolled  in  dur-
ing  this  period.  Students  took  their  time  to  answer  the 
questionnaires  gradually  throughout  the  academic  year. 
The  assessment  for  Presage  variables  took  place  in  Sep-
tember-October of 2018 and 2019, Process variables were 
assessed in the subsequent February-March, and Product 
variables  were  evaluated  in  May-June.  The  procedural 
steps  were  ethically  approved  by  the  Ethics  Committee 
under reference 2018.170, within the broader context of 
an R&D Project spanning 2018 to 2021.

Data analysis

The ex post facto design [42] of this cross-sectional study 
involved  bivariate  association  analyses,  multiple  regres-
sion,  and  structural  predictions  (SEMs).  Preliminary 
analyses were executed to ensure the appropriateness of 
the  parameters  used  in  the  analyses,  including  tests  for 

Fuente et al. BMC Psychology          (2024) 12:267 Page 5 of 11

normality  (Kolmogorov-Smirnov),  skewness,  and  kurto-
sis (+-0.05).

Multiple  regression  Hypothesis  1  was  evaluated  using 
multiple regression analysis through SPSS (v. 26).

Confirmatory  factor  analysis  To  test  Hypotheses  2  and 
3,  a  structural  equation  model  (SEM)  was  employed  in 
this sample. Model fit was assessed by examining the chi-
square  to  degrees  of  freedom  ratio,  along  with  RMSEA 
(root mean square error of approximation), NFI (normed 
fit index), CFI (comparative fit index), GFI (goodness-of-
fit index), and AGFI (adjusted goodness-of-fit index) [43]. 
Ideally, all these values should surpass 0.90. The adequacy 
of the sample size was confirmed using the Hoelter index 
[44]. These analyses were conducted using AMOS (v.22).

Results
Prediction results

The predictive relationships exhibited a continuum along 
two  extremes.  On  the  one  hand,  conscientiousness, 
extraversion  and  openness  were  significant,  graded,  and 
positive predictors of self-regulation. On the other hand, 
Agreeableness  and  Neuroticism  were  negative,  graded 
predictors  of  self-regulation.  A  considerable  percentage 
of explained variance was observed (r2 = 0.499). The most 
meaningful finding, however, is that this predictive differ-
ential  grading  is  maintained  for  the  rest  of  the  variables 
analyzed:  positive  affect  (r2 = 0.571)  and  negative  affect 
(r2 = 0.524), achievement emotions during study, engage-
ment  burnout,  problem-  and  emotion-focused  coping 
strategies, and student health. See Table 2.

Structural prediction results
Structural prediction model

Three  models  were  tested.  Model  1  proposes  the  exclu-
sive  prediction  of  personality  factors  on  the  rest  of  the 
factors,  not  including  self-regulation.  Model  2  evaluated 
the  predictive  potential  of  self-regulation  on  the  factors 

of the Big Five model. Model 3 tested the ability of the Big 
Five  personality  traits  to  predict  self-regulation  and  the 
other factors. The latter model presented adequate statis-
tical values. These models are shown in Table 3.

Models of the linear structural results of the variables
Direct  effects  The  statistical  effects  showed  a  direct, 
significant,  positive  predictive  effect  of  the  personality 
factors  C  (Conscientiousness)  and  E  (Extraversion)  on 
self-regulation. The result for factor O (openness to expe-
rience) was not significant. Factors A (agreeableness) and 
N (neuroticism) were negatively related, especially the lat-
ter. In a complementary fashion, factors C and E showed 
significant, positive predictions of positive affect, while O 
and A had less strength. Factor N most strongly predicted 
negative affect.

Moreover,  self-regulation  positively  predicted  positive 
achievement  emotions  during  study  and  negatively  pre-
dicted  negative  achievement  emotions.  Positive  affect 
predicted  positive  emotions  during  study,  engagement, 
and  problem-focused  coping  strategies;  negative  affect 
predicted  negative  emotions  during  study,  burnout,  and 
emotion-focused  strategies.  Positive  emotions  during 
study negatively predict negative emotions and burnout. 
Engagement  positively  predicted  problem-focused  cop-
ing  and  negatively  predicted  burnout.  Finally,  problem-
focused  coping  also  predicted  emotion-focused  coping. 
Emotion-focused  coping  negatively  predicts  health  and 
well-being.

Indirect  effects  The  Big  Five  factors  exhibited  consis-
tent  directionality.  Factors  C  and  E  positively  predicted 
positive emotions, engagement, problem-focused coping, 
and  health  and  negatively  predicted  negative  emotions 
and burnout. Factor O had low prediction values in both 
negative and positive cases. Factors A and N were positive 
predictors  of  negative  emotions  during  study,  burnout, 
emotion-focused  coping  and  health,  while  the  opposite

Discussion
Based  on  the  Self-  vs.  External-Regulation  theory  [27, 
28], the aim of this study was to show, differentially, the 
regulatory,  nonregulatory  or  dysregulatory  power  of  the 
Big Five personality factors with respect to study behav-
iors,  associated  emotionality  during  study,  motivational 
states, and ultimately, student health behavior.

Regarding  Hypothesis  1,  the  results  showed  a  differ-
ential,  graded  prediction  of  the  Big  Five  personality  fac-
tors  affecting  both  self-regulation  and  affective  states. 
The  results  from  the  logistic  and  structural  regression 
analyses  showed  a  clear,  graded  pattern  from  the  posi-
tive predictive relationship of C to the negative predictive 
relationship of N. On the one hand, they showed the reg-
ulatory effect (direct and indirect) of factors C and E, the 
nonregulatory effect of O, and the dysregulatory effect of 
factors A and especially N. This evidence offers a differ-
ential  categorization  of  the  five  factors  in  an  integrated 
manner. On the other hand, their effects on affective tone 
(direct  and  indirect)  take  the  same  positive  direction  in 
C and E, intermediate in the case of O, and negative in A 
and  N.  There  is  plentiful  prior  evidence  that  has  shown 
this  relationship,  though  only  in  part,  not  in  the  inte-
grated manner of the model presented here [29, 45–47].

Regarding  Hypothesis  2,  the  evidence  shows  that  self-
regulation directly and indirectly predicts affective states 
in  achievement  emotions  during  study.  Directionality 
can be positive or negative according to the influence of 
C and E and of positive emotionality or of A and N with 
negative  affect.  This  finding  agrees  with  prior  research 
[29, 48–51].

Regarding  Hypothesis  3,  the  results  have  shown  clear 
bidirectionality.  Subsequent  to  the  prior  influence  of 
personality  factors  and  self-regulation,  achievement 
emotions  bring  about  the  resulting  motivational  states 
of  engagement-burnout  and  the  use  of  different  cop-
ing  strategies  (problem-focused  vs.  emotion-focused).

Positive achievement emotions during study predicted a 
motivational  state  of  engagement  and  problem-focused 
coping  strategies  and  were  positive  predictors  of  health; 
however,  negative  emotions  predicted  burnout  and 
emotion-focused  coping  strategies  and  were  negative 
predictors  of  health.  These  results  are  in  line  with  prior 
evidence [49, 52, 53]. Finally, we unequivocally showed a 
double, sequenced path of emotional variables and affec-
tive motivations in a process that ultimately and differen-
tially predicts student health [54, 55].

In conclusion, these results allow us to understand the 
predictive relationships involving these multiple variables 

in  a  holistic  predictive  model,  while  previous  research 
has addressed this topic only in part [56]. We believe that 
these results lend empirical support to the sequence pro-
posed by the SR vs. ER model [27]: the factors of consci-
entiousness  and  extraversion  appear  to  be  regulators  of 
positive  emotionality,  engagement  and  health;  openness 
to  experience  is  considered  to  be  nonregulating;  and 
agreeableness  and  neuroticism  are  dysregulators  of  the 
learning process and precursors of negative emotionality 
and poorer student health [57]. New levels of detail—in a 
graded heuristic—have been added to our understanding

of  the  relationships  among  the  five-factor  model,  self-
regulation, achievement emotions and health [23].

Limitations and research prospects

A  primary  limitation  of  this  study  was  that  the  analysis 
focused exclusively on the student. The role of the teach-
ing  context,  therefore,  was  not  considered.  Previous 
research  has  reported  the  role  of  the  teaching  process, 
in  interaction  with  student  characteristics,  in  predict-
ing  positive  or  negative  emotionality  in  students  [49, 
58].  However,  such  results  do  not  undercut  the  value  of 
the  results  presented  here.  Future  research  should  fur-
ther analyze potential personality types derived from the 
present categorization according to heuristic values.

Practical implications

The relationships presented may be considered a mental 
map  that  orders  the  constituent  factors  of  the  Five-Fac-
tor  Model  on  a  continuum,  from  the  most  adaptive  (or 
regulatory) and deregulatory to the most maladaptive or 
dysregulatory. This information is very important for car-
rying out preventive intervention programs for students 
and for designing programs for those who could benefit 
from training in self-regulation and positivity. Such inter-
vention could improve how students experience the dif-
ficulties  inherent  in  university  studies  [47,  59],  another 
indicator of the need for active Psychology and Counsel-
ing Centers at universities.
