Introduction: Education and training in Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH) play an important 
role in building global capacity and contribute to safer working conditions. The shortage of occupational 
health professionals, the lack of knowledge and a high number of occupational accidents and diseases 
stress the demand for providing further education and training in OEH. This need is especially urgent in 
low and middle-income countries. Three international courses on OEH provide valuable insights on how 
to develop successful trainings in the field and how to contribute to the creation of healthy and safe 
workplaces.
Methodology and Results: The courses “Global Occupational and Environmental Determinants of  Diseases: 
a multidisciplinary and multicultural approach for prevention” (University of Brescia, Italy), “Advanced 
International  Training  Course  in  OEH”  (Chulabhorn  Research  Institute,  Bangkok,  Thailand)  and  “Teach-
ing  interventions  crossing  borders”  (Ludwig-Maximillians-Universität,  Munich,  Germany)  offer  a  unique 
networking  opportunity  for  health  professionals  from  low-,  middle-  and  high-income  countries.  Three 
main characteristics of  learning were identified as successful for adult learning in OEH: Interdisciplinary 
learning allows exchanging skills and knowledge and therefore closes gaps between the several disci-
plines within OEH. Experiential  learning enables participants to reflect on their personal experiences, e.g. 
through workplace visits. Finally, active learning empowers the learner to take the leading role in the 
learning process using e.g. problem- or project-based learning approaches.
Conclusion: Training and education in OEH should become a higher priority by including it in the standard 
public health and medical curricula. For this, train the trainer approaches are essential in many countries. 
Any OEH training should follow the interdisciplinary, experiential and interactive learning approach and 
should be accessible to participants from all regions.

New global courses on Occupational and 
Environmental Health
Education  and  training  of  health  workers  and  clinician 
partners play an enormous role in the success of any pre-
vention practice effort in the public health arena. Younger 
generations of professionals are necessary to sustain the 
gains current practitioners have achieved and this need is 
acutely felt in the fields of occupational and environmen-
tal health particularly in its global perspective.

Even  as  the  World  Health  Organization  estimates  that 
24% of the global burden of disease and death is attrib-
utable to occupational and environmental exposures [1], 
a  severe  global  shortage  exists  in  the  number  of  health 
professionals trained in environmental and occupational 
health  (OEH).  This  shortage  is  especially  acute  for  occu-
pational  physicians  [2]  and  is  likely  to  worsen  in  future 
years  with  a  globally  growing  working  population, 
steady  increases  in  chemical  production,  and  increas-
ing  global  demand  for  safer  workplaces  and  healthier 
environments [3].

Education and training are critically important for build-
ing global capacity in OEH. Training is needed to enhance 
the  knowledge,  skills,  and  practice  of  the  current  work-
forces in these fields and to build the future generation of 
workers. Working professionals, both those trained in OEH 
and those serving in roles without formal specialty instruc-
tion, need training to improve safety and health practices, 
design safer workplaces and provide cleaner environments.
This Special Issue of the Annals of Global Health is the 
second  volume  of  a  series  of  three  international,  multi-
disciplinary  recurring  courses  on  Occupational  and 
Environmental Health:

437

1.  “Global  Occupational  and  Environmental  Determi-
nants  of  Diseases:  a  Multidisciplinary  and  Multicul-
tural Approach for Prevention,” University of Brescia, 
Italy [4].

2.  “Advanced  International  Training  Course  in  Occu-
pational  and  Environmental  Health,”  Chulabhorn 
Research Institute, Bangkok, Thailand [5].

3.  “Teaching  Interventions  Crossing  Borders,”  at  the 
Ludwig Maximillian  University of Munich, Germany 
[6, 7].

In addition to high-quality, hands-on training in occupa-
tional  and  environmental  health,  these  courses  provide 
unique opportunities for networking among students and 
professionals  from  both  public  health  and  medical  spe-
cialties,  from  high-income  and  low  and  middle-income 
countries, and for developing multi-national approaches 
to continuing education that extend beyond the courses. 
Students  and  faculty  attending  the  courses  are  encour-
aged to provide information about occupational and envi-
ronmental health in their countries, including topics such 
as  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  (OSH)  services  cover-
age  and  organization;  workers’  benefits  and  compensa-
tion; ratification and implementation of policies from the 
International  Labour  Office  (ILO)  and  the  World  Health 
Organization (WHO); preventive interventions in environ-
mental health; and remediation of hazardous waste sites. 
The  Munich  course  is  additionally  focused  on  another 
important task of the OSH experts: how to train workers, 
managers, and the community, as well as healthcare and 
safety  professionals  and  political  stakeholders.  Course 
participants  learn  how  to  set  up  a  competency-based 
training program for adult learners, according to a ‘train 
the trainer’ approach.

Active  learning  methods  are  offered  by  all  three 
courses  and  thus  provide  opportunities  for  network-
ing  and  bi-directional  exchange  of  ideas  and  experi-
ences between faculty and participants. This was mainly 
achieved by the structure of the courses allowing ample 
time for groupwork, discussion, and presentation by par-
ticipants. Education and training programs provide highly 
valuable outputs when participants are actively involved, 
are encouraged and have opportunities to illustrate data 
and critical policy aspects from their personal experience 
or work on a concrete problem (problem-based-learning). 
This  is  especially  relevant  for  occupational  and  environ-
mental health, given the extreme lack of information and 
research data from the global perspectives, the need for 
education [8] and capacity building [9].

The  LDOH  Foundation  (Learning  and  Development  of 
Occupational Health) has the mission to support profes-
sionals through developing and promoting quality educa-
tion and information on Occupational Safety and Health. 
Influenced by our three courses, LDOH started supporting 
health  professionals  through  developing  and  promoting 
good quality education and information on Occupational 
Safety and Health. A library of online and blended lessons, 
modules and courses from all over the world is available at 
the LDOH website (https://ldoh.net/). LDOH is involved 
in two EU-funded projects focusing on capacity building 

for  Occupational  and  Environmental  Health.  The  first 
takes  place  in  Turkey,  where  the  Ministry  of  Health  has 
implemented the project Scientific Performance of Public 
Health  Institution  of  Turkey  (ESPrIT  –  http://esprit-ohs.
eu/en/), funded by the EU Horizon2020 program. ESPrIT 
includes  a  one-week  training  module  in  occupational 
health  surveillance  to  illustrate  the  principles  of  adult 
learning:  goal  oriented,  practical  and  problem  centred. 
Step  by  step  information  (20-minute  presentations)  is 
provided  on  the  different  phases  of  a  surveillance  pro-
ject  and  small  interdisciplinary  groups  work  on  a  mutu-
ally chosen subject. The other is an Erasmus+ programme 
coordinated by the University of Milan, Italy, jointly with 
ten  universities  in  Central  Asia  and  India  in  which  edu-
cational materials for a blended learning Master Program 
in Occupational and Environmental Health are developed.
This  Special  Issue  is  an  example  of  what  participants 
can  produce  to  fill  the  knowledge  gap  about  the  global 
context,  by  providing  data  on  specific  situations  in  the 
many parts of the world from which they come. This data 
is absolutely necessary to provide more accurate estimates 
on the global burden of occupational and environmental 
diseases and to optimize preventive strategies. Data avail-
able today is almost completely related to Higher Income 
Countries  [10–11]  and  do  not  reflect  accurately  the  cur-
rent trends in most countries of the world.

According  to  a  recent  survey  by  the  International 
Occupational  Medicine  Society  Collaborative  on  Global 
Trends in Occupational Medicine [2], the number of occu-
pational physicians is not sufficient to meet demand. This 
trend is likely to worsen with increased demand and fewer 
trainees [3]. In addition, legislative and government sup-
port  for  occupational  medicine,  while  present  in  some 
countries,  is  not  universal,  due  to  a  lack  of  understand-
ing by employers and government officials of the benefits 
of an occupational medicine service. These two elements 
(shortage of professionals and lack of  knowledge) clearly 
indicate  the  severe  need  for  education  and  training  in 
Global Occupational and Environmental Health. This dis-
cipline can also attract and offer potential for career devel-
opment for students from Higher Income Countries, who 
are showing increasing interest in Global Health and may 
be attracted to the Occupational and Environmental field.

Scope of the Discipline and Statement of Need
Occupational  safety  and  health  is  a  broad  field  that 
addresses critical issues to help ensure workers and work 
places remain safe. No matter the profession, specific job 
or  workplace,  there  are  hazards  present  that  need  to  be 
controlled. In the US, there were 4,836 fatal work injuries 
[12]  and  approximately  2.9  million  nonfatal  workplace 
injuries and illnesses in 2015 [13]. Globally, it is estimated 
that  2.3  million  workers  are  killed  each  year  (including 
352,769  fatal  work  injuries  and  almost  2  million  from 
occupational diseases) and there are over 313 million non-
fatal  occupational  accidents  [14].  The  burden  is  particu-
larly  heavy  in  low  and  middle-income  countries,  where 
manufacturing  is  mostly  concentrated  and  health  and 
safety  law  and  its  application  is  often  not  implemented 
properly [15].

Lucchini et al: Education and Training438 

In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health 
Act was enacted to “assure safe and healthful working con-
ditions for working men and women [16].” The European 
Union Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work 
2014–2020 lists the goal of “ensuring a safe and healthy 
work environment for over 217 million workers in the EU 
[17].” Other countries have enacted safety and health leg-
islation to enhance safety and protect workers, with much 
of the legislation included in country profiles on the ILO 
website [18].

There  is  a  critical  need  for  education  and  training  in 
occupational safety and health to address basic and more 
advanced threats to worker health. Training is needed for 
the  current  and  future  OSH  workforce.  Working  profes-
sionals,  trained  in  OSH,  together  with  those  profession-
als working in roles potentially related to OSH, may gain 
capacity through short-courses and collaborate with OSH 
trained  professionals  to  improve  safety  and  health  prac-
tices  and  design  safer  workplaces.  Training  the  future 
occupational  health  workforce  will  enable  the  practices 
and actions taken to date to be sustained and to be built 
upon for the benefit of future generations.

Interdisciplinary, Experiential and Active 
Education in Occupational Safety and Health
Educators need to look at the methods and practices used 
to provide occupational safety and health training. OSHA 
standards  provide  minimal  guidance  for   training  content 
and delivery methods [19]. Developing and implementing 
training programs is difficult, as OSH is a broad field and 
encompasses  many  disciplines   including,  among  others, 
occupational medicine and nursing, industrial/occupational 
hygiene, occupational safety, ergonomics, and occupational 
psychology.  The  focus  of  OSH  practice  is  the  worker  or 
workplace, and each of these disciplines focus on a portion 
of the overall field of OSH. Industrial/occupational hygiene 
looks  at  worker  exposures,  occupational  safety  identi-
fies  workplace  injury  hazards,  and  occupational  medicine 
examines health threats to workers and clinical care when 
they are injured or ill. Training must include how each of 
these distinct disciplines overlap and intersect.

Interdisciplinary Learning
OSH training should be interdisciplinary and include expe-
riential  learning  as  the  basis  for  the  development  and 
implementation of training programs. This interdisciplinary 
approach will bridge the gap between the OSH disciplines, 
and  refine  the  focus  of  OSH  practice  on  improving  the 
health and safety of workers and reducing hazards in the 
work place. Interdisciplinary training programs also provide 
opportunities for trainees to present their professional and 
country-based experience of a topic, thus improving their 
skills and knowledge base across disciplines. Erickson [20] 
writes  about  “interdisciplinarity”  as  a  means  to  increase 
safety  performance.  Interdisciplinarity  “integrates  knowl-
edge from different disciplines. It blends the assumptions 
and  practices  of  each  into  an  integrative  relationship  to 
accomplish a larger purpose such as improving safety per-
formance.”  Recognizing  the  importance  of  this  approach, 
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 

(NIOSH) provides extramural funding to support Education 
and Research Centers (ERCs) to provide high-quality, inter-
disciplinary graduate training, research training, continuing 
education, and outreach in the core occupational safety and 
health  disciplines  [21].  The  ERCs  are  model  training  pro-
grams that are based on the understanding and awareness 
of the interdisciplinary nature of OSH professional practice.

Experiential Learning
Incorporating experiential learning into training programs 
provides  valuable  opportunities  for  trainees  to  visualize 
occupational  hazards.  The  experiential  learning  theory 
(ELT)  defines  learning  as  “the  process  whereby  knowl-
edge is created through the transformation of experience. 
Knowledge results from the combination of grasping and 
transforming  experience  [22].”  Experiential  learning  is  a 
cycle that includes experiencing, reflecting, thinking, and 
acting.  Training  developed  with  the  ELT  identifies  why 
what students are learning is important, it allows partici-
pants to practically navigate through content, and it uses 
real  life  examples  and  scenarios  to  anchor  instruction. 
Experiential learning connects prior knowledge with new 
knowledge [23], allowing trainees to reflect on their per-
sonal experiences to transform the way they understand 
and act on what they learned.

The  New  York  and  New  Jersey  ERC  (NYNJ  ERC)  devel-
oped their Historical Perspectives on Occupational Safety 
and Health course in 2006 to provide trainees with inter-
disciplinary,  experiential  learning  opportunities.  In  the 
Historical Perspectives course, trainees visit workplaces to 
experience  how  workers  work  and  experience  the  occu-
pational  hazards  and  controls  at  work  sites.  These  work 
place visits are a highlight of the academic training pro-
vided by the NYNJ ERC. Trainees’ comments on the course 
exemplify  the  value  of  interdisciplinary  and  experiential 
learning. Several direct quotes from the evaluation from 
the Historical Perspectives course include:

•	 “How  crucial  inter-professional  education  is  to  be-
come  a  good,  competent  occupational  medicine 
physician.  Seeing  workers  at  their  own  sites,  helps 
you learn and appreciate their work conditions, their 
challenges and hazards on a whole new level that can 
never be learned as well from a classroom or clinic.”
•	 “This  experience  opens  my  eyes  to  question  condi-
tions  of  fellow  workers,  to  ask  more  informed  ques-
tions  about  what  is  being  done  to  prevent  not  only 
injury in the work place but what can we do to sys-
tematically improve and prevent injury and promote 
well-being in the first place.”

•	 “Workers  may  not  feel  empowered  to  advocate  for 
themselves  if  an  employer  asks  them  to  complete 
tasks that are not compliant with the restrictions. This 
is something that I will keep in mind. With the knowl-
edge that I am gaining through experiences like this 
tour I will be able to advocate for workers.”

•	 “The  more  powerful  aspect  of  learning  comes  from 
experiencing  things  first  hand,  and  from  relevant 
‘people,’ not just teachers. That kind of learning goes 
deeper and lasts longer.”

Lucchini et al: Education and Training439

Active Learning
Based on the constructivism learning theory, when devel-
oping (adult) learning programs in OSH, as in any other 
discipline,  learning  is  considered  as  an  active  process 
controlled by the learner and based on his/her previous 
experiences [24]. Such experiences always differ from one 
person to another but are even more pronounced among 
participants from high, middle and low-income countries 
like those attending these courses. Therefore, in the set-
ting of the described summer courses it was essential to 
take this previous experience into account. It also has to 
be acknowledged that rather than just listening to the lec-
turer,  learners  remember  more  when  they  interact  with 
each other and work on real and relevant topics [25, 26]. 
Furthermore, thanks to current technology, every learner 
has  all  information  right  at  hand.  Therefore,  the  most 
important task of the teacher is to act as a facilitator and 
accompany the learner to find, understand and apply cur-
rent evidence [25, 27].

Based  on  theoretical  considerations,  the  Munich  sum-
mer course uses a very interactive problem and employed 
a  project-based  learning  approach  during  which  partici-
pant  develop  a  teaching  intervention  for  their  workers, 
managers,  and  community,  targeting  a  concrete  OSH 
problem in their home country. After successfully formu-
lating “smart” (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, 
Timely)  learning  objectives  for  the  training,  participants 
approach a teaching scheme structured in five phases of 
learning: 1) Adjusting and initial setting of the ‘tone’ and 
best  mood  for  learning;  2)  Reactivation  of  learners’  pre-
vious  knowledge;  3)  Information  about  the  new  knowl-
edge; 4) Processing of the new information; 5) Evaluation, 
according  to  the  ‘ARIPE’  (Adjust,  Reactivate,  Inform, 
Process,  Evaluate)  model  [28].  The  ARIPE  steps  follow 
and  support  the  learning  process  [28].  For  each  ARIPE-
step, participants become familiar with several interactive 
methods  that  can  be  applied  within  the  different  social 
forms  of  learning  and  that  ensure  an  active  role  of  the 
target  group.  Participants  in  the  Munich  course  directly 
apply  the  ARIPE  structure  with  the  interactive  methods 
to  the  teaching  intervention  they  develop.  In  order  to 
encourage exchange, participants work in small groups of 
up to four students, supported by tutors. Back home, par-
ticipants apply their teaching intervention to their target 
groups and evaluate the outcomes.

Models for Education and Training
Based  on  the  models  of  interdisciplinary,  experiential, 
and active learning, all three training courses incorporate 
site visits, including visits to a marble quarry and milling 
operations, a steel plant and an automobile parts manu-
facturing facility in Italy, to the Ramathibodi Hospital, the 
largest health care center in Bangkok, and to a large car 
manufacturing facility in Germany. The addition of these 
workplace  visits  enable  the  participants  to  understand 
the  complexities  of  work,  experience  how  work  impacts 
worker safety, and identify ways to control workplace haz-
ards.  Based  on  trainee  feedback,  the  inclusion  of  these 
work  place  visits  is  a  valuable  learning  experience.  One 
trainee  commented  that  he  “gained  practical  workplace 

insight and experience” from the visits to the workplaces. 
Another  commented,  “The  interdisciplinary  approach 
helps us to resolve various issues and come up with com-
mon solutions that will benefit the workforce.”

The  model  used  by  the  NYNJ  ERC  and  the  Summer 
Programs  is  not  new.  Over  300  years  ago  Bernardino 
Ramazzini  visited  workplaces  to  observe  how  various 
types  of  work  were  performed  and  to  discuss  illnesses 
with workers [29, 30]. In 1910 Alice Hamilton investigated 
the  “dangerous  trades”  in  Illinois,  visiting  workplaces  to 
see  the  conditions  faced  by  workers  and  to  understand 
the hazards present that were making workers ill [31]. The 
concept of experiential learning in OSH, that you need to 
see the hazards and experience what workers are facing, is 
the core concept that is incorporated in the design of the 
programs described.

Utilizing  interdisciplinary  and  experiential  learning 
is  a  powerful  way  to  provide  information,  because  the 
learners experience the conditions faced by workers. The 
programs offered by the NYNJ ERC, the Brescia Summer 
Program,  the  Bangkok  International  training  course  and 
the Munich Summer School are examples and models that 
can be utilized by others across the globe. By experiencing 
the work places, trainees are able to understand the value 
of  interdisciplinary  OSH  teams,  and  working  collabora-
tively ultimately improve health and safety conditions for 
workers and work places.

Recommendations

•	 Given  the  deficit  of  specialist  expertise  in  the  field 
globally, education and training in Occupational and 
Environmental health must be given a greater priority 
at the national, regional and global level.

•	 Capacity  building  as  a  priority  may  be  achieved 
through a ‘Train the trainer’ approach, where the tar-
get groups plays an active role.

•	 Courses  should  be  intensified  and  offered  more  ex-
tensively also to generalists in clinical medicine and 
public  health,  covering  all  geographical  areas  and 
with special focus on sectors with high occupational 
and environmental hazards.

•	 Training should be fully interdisciplinary using an ac-

tive, experiential learning approach.

•	 Aspects  of  Occupational  and  Environmental  health 
should be integrated into standard public health and 
medical curricula when possible, to optimize human 
resources and capacity building.

This  Special  Issue  of  the  Annals  of  Global  Health  will 
show-case  the  professional  efforts  of  the  participants  of 
the  three  international  courses  described  above.  While 
some  participants  had  occupational  health  training  and 
are authors here, the majority were generalists in clinical 
medicine  or  public  health,  who  were  engaged  in  occu-
pational/environmental  health  activity  in  their  home 
countries,  as  a  ‘collateral’  assignment.  Their  documenta-
tion of local problems and solutions from their countries, 
described here, are first-hand “reports from the field” and 
help to close the existing knowledge gap between coun-
tries, regarding the occupational health agenda globally.
