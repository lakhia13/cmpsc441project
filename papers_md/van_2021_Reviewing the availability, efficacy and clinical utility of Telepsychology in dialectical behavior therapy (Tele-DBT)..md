Abstract

Background: Telepsychology is increasingly being implemented in mental health care. We conducted a scoping
review on the best available research evidence regarding availability, efficacy and clinical utility of telepsychology in
DBT. The review was performed using PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Our aim was to help DBT-therapists make empirically
supported decisions about the use of telepsychology during and after the current pandemic and to anticipate the
changing digital needs of patients and clinicians.
Methods: A search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycARTICLES and Web of Science. Search terms for
telepsychology were included and combined with search terms that relate to DBT.

Results: Our search and selection procedures resulted in 41 articles containing information on phone consultation,
smartphone applications, internet delivered skills training, videoconferencing, virtual reality and computer- or video-
assisted interventions in DBT.

Conclusions: The majority of research about telepsychology in DBT has focused on the treatment mode of
between-session contact. However, more trials using sophisticated empirical methodologies are needed.
Quantitative data on the efficacy and utility of online and blended alternatives to standard (i.e. face-to-face)
individual therapy, skills training and therapist consultation team were scarce. The studies that we found were
designed to evaluate feasibility and usability. A permanent shift to videoconferencing or online training is therefore
not warranted as long as face-to-face is an option. In all, there is an urgent need to compare standard DBT to
online or blended DBT. Smartphone apps and virtual reality (VR) are experienced as an acceptable facilitator in
access and implantation of DBT skills. In addition, we have to move forward on telepsychology applications by
consulting our patients, younger peers and experts in adjacent fields if we want DBT to remain effective and
relevant in the digital age.

Background
Telepsychology,1 i.e. the provision of psychological ser-
vices using telecommunication or digital technologies
(e.g. internet, telephone applications and virtual reality),
is on the rise [2–6]. COVID-19 accelerated this trend
[7]. However, a scoping review about the efficacy and
clinical utility of telepsychology in DBT is lacking. The
aim of the current review is to help DBT-therapists
make empirically supported decisions about the use of
telepsychology during and after the current pandemic
and to anticipate the changing digital needs of patients
and clinicians.

Standard DBT is an empirically supported, cognitive
behavioral treatment for adults and adolescents suffering
from chronic suicidal and self-harming behavior, charac-
teristic for borderline personality disorder (BPD) [8, 9].
DBT is a comprehensive program that consists of four
primary modes of treatment delivery, to address the
multiple needs of suicidal patients [9–11]. In individual
therapy, patients figure out how they can take realistic
steps to a life worth living and how to stay motivated. In
skills training, the focus is on acquiring skills from
trainers and peers. Consultations outside of office hours,
preferably
facilitate
individual
generalization of skills to situations where patients need
them the most, e.g. during suicidal crises. Even though
this mode is often called “phone consultation”, DBT-
teams have used all kinds of technology to stay in touch
with clients [12]. The therapist consultation team, lastly,
helps individual therapists and skills trainers to deliver
adherence treatment and remain motivated throughout
the process [9, 11].

Although primarily designed for suicidal and self-
harming behavior, DBT remains effective when tailored
to fit the needs of other clinical populations, age groups,
or treatment settings [13, 14]. A significant part of this
customizability relates to the underlying treatment ra-
tionale, Marsha Linehan’s biosocial theory. This theory
explains maladaptive behavior, including suicidal behav-
ior and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), as manifestations
of pervasive emotion dysregulation or as ways of coping
with it [9, 15]. Emotion regulation capacity is a trans-
diagnostic and dimensional construct, assumed to play a
key role in a broad range of mental illnesses [15–18]. Es-
pecially the DBT skills training is evolving from a treat-
suicidal patients with BPD to a
ment mode for
transdiagnostic intervention [9]. Telepsychology is in-
creasingly being used in DBT supervision and -training
for professionals [19–25] and in mental health care in
general [26, 27]. Arguments both in favor and against

1Standard terminology is lacking as yet [1], reason why we use the
term telepsychology to broadly refer to concepts such as e-health, tele-
medicine, telepsychiatry, digital health, teletherapy.

such an evolution can be made. On the one hand, evi-
dence suggests that the efficacy of telepsychology is
comparable to face-to-face care in diverse populations
and settings [28–30]. On the other hand, studies about
telepsychology have primarily focused on short-term ef-
fects [31–33]. In addition, there is insufficient research
to consider any telepsychology intervention as evidence-
based for suicidal ideation, self-harm or BPD [34, 35].
However, a comprehensive overview of research regard-
ing the use of telepsychology in DBT is lacking.

We conducted a scoping review to fill this research
gap [36]. Since we are interested in the use of telepsy-
chology in DBT in all of its capacities and welcome the
evolution toward dimensional theoretical constructs in
psychiatry, we did not restrict ourselves to one specific
diagnostic category. The overarching aim was to docu-
ment the best available research evidence regarding the
efficacy and clinical utility of telepsychology in DBT. In
doing so, we used the definitions of the American Psy-
chological Association (APA) [37, 38]. Treatment efficacy
referred to the scientific evaluation of whether a treat-
ment works. Clinical utility comprised the applicability,
feasibility, and usefulness of the intervention in specific
situations, as well as the generalizability of an interven-
tion whose efficacy had been established [37, 38]. To ob-
tain a detailed overview, we reviewed all
types of
research evidence (i.e. clinical opinion, observation, con-
sensus among recognized experts, systematized clinical
observation, quasi experiments, randomized controlled
trials) that could help answer our research questions. At
the same time, we took the difference in methodological
quality into account when interpreting the results [39,
40]. Within our overarching aim, we had three specific
research questions (RQ):

RQ1:What do we know about the efficacy and clinical
utility of telepsychology in standard DBT, i.e. using tele-
in support of skills
com for between-session-contact,
generalization?

RQ2: To what extent is telepsychology equivalent or
superior to face-to-face contact in other modes of DBT
treatment, i.e. individual therapy, skills training, consult-
ation team?

RQ3: Does the addition of telepsychology to standard
DBT modes, −strategies, −procedures and skills increase
the efficacy or clinical utility of DBT?

Methods
Criteria and identification of studies
A search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycARTI-
CLES and Web of Science (WoS) until the 9th of March
2021,
following PRISMA-ScR guidelines [36]. Search
terms for telepsychology were included and combined
with search terms that relate to DBT. Search terms
(Additional file 1) and syntax (Additional file 2) were

modified as necessary for each database. Only 1) English,
French, German and Dutch manuscripts from 2) peer-
reviewed sources, that 3) provided quantitative or quali-
tative research evidence 4) on efficacy or clinical utility
of 5) the use of digital technology 6) in DBT treatment
or 7) implementation of telepsychology in DBT treat-
ment were considered. To identify other potentially rele-
vant studies we 1) crosschecked the reference lists and
citing articles of identified studies, 2) checked the refer-
ences of The Oxford Handbook DBT [13], and 3)
screened the references of Phone Coaching in Dialectical
Behavior Therapy [12] (Fig. 1).

Selection of studies
All records from the database searches were imported in
EndNote. This collection was electronically and manually
deduplicated. The titles and abstracts were screened for
eligibility by two review authors independently (HvL, RS).
Records that clearly did not fulfill the criteria were ex-
cluded. The remaining references were made available in
full text and assessed for eligibility by the same two review
authors (HvL, RS) (Additional file 3). Conflicting decisions
were discussed until agreement was reached. If necessary,
we consulted with two other authors (UW, LvdB).

For the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and pre-
post studies, detailed descriptions of design, participants,

experimental and comparator interventions, measures,
and statistical significance of changes in the primary out-
come variables can be found in Table 1. If an effect was
significant, we also reported Cohen’s d or calculated it
ourselves, following the formulas and procedures men-
tioned in Lakens et al. [41]. In the results section, we go
over the main findings per research question and per
technology.

Results
Sample of studies
The original database search yielded 804 reports. Cross-
checking and screening The Oxford Handbook DBT and
Phone Coaching in Dialectical Behavior Therapy resulted
in 10 records. This sample of 814 records contained 196
duplicates. After screening titles and abstracts, 83 refer-
ences were selected as potentially eligible, of which 41
clearly met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). A detailed
overview of the 83 full-text articles that we assessed, and
the reason why specific articles were excluded, can be
found in Additional file 3.

Study characteristics
In total, 41 studies were selected. The majority of the
studies consist of observational data, secondary analyses,

focus groups and surveys, patients’ opinions and expert
opinions. Eighteen out of forty-one studies focused on
the frequency, efficacy and utility of phone consultation.
Nine studies focused on the added value of smartphone
applications. Nine studies focused on internet delivered
skills training. Four studies focused on virtual reality in
DBT. One study focused on a computer program and
one study focused on learning a DBT skill by means of
video. All studies were in the initial stage of clinical re-
search (i.e. feasibility, acceptance, usability).

Efficacy and clinical utility of telecom for between-session-
contact, in support of skills generalization (RQ1)

therapist

satisfaction,

Telephone Looking first at the treatment efficacy, we
did not find any RCTs or pre-post studies about the
added value of phone consultation in DBT. However,
there are articles that contain data on phone consult-
ation frequency and associations with treatment out-
come. Chalker et al. [52] investigated the association
between phone calls, satisfaction (patients and thera-
pists), and treatment outcome (patients) in a standard
DBT program with adults diagnosed with BPD. More
frequent between-session contact was significantly asso-
ciated with client
satisfaction,
treatment retention and decrease in psychosocial prob-
lems. There was no association between violation of per-
the
limits regarding phone calls and any of
sonal
outcome measures. Oliveira and Rizvi [53] studied the
frequency of phone calls and text messaging in a sample
of patients with BPD who were participating in 6
months of standard DBT. Results showed that therapists
received an average of 2.55 phone calls a month. Lim-
brunner et al. [54] investigated DBT phone consultation
to reduce eating disorder-related urges in DBT for eating
the average
disordered adults. Results indicated that
number of calls ranged between 0 to 4 calls per day. The
duration of the phone consultation range between 1 to
30 min, with an average of 6 min.

[10].

[55, 56]

In later articles

The other studies focus on the clinical utility of phone
consultation. Linehan formulated most of her expert
opinions regarding phone consultation in the DBT treat-
ment manual
she
highlighted aspects of this mode of treatment and sub-
stantiates the assumption that DBT reduces the contin-
gency of between-session contact and suicidal behavior.
Linehan emphasizes the importance of timing, i.e. calling
before self-destructive behavior takes place, and content,
i.e. focused on skills in a ‘matter of fact’ tone. She also
asserts that the individual therapist is best placed to pro-
vide phone consultation, since it is the only person who
can assuage relationship cracks between sessions, knows
the patients learning history and current skills, and can

discuss the chain of events that led up to the consult-
ation. At the same time, Linehan accentuates the neces-
sity of teaching the patient skillful ways of asking for
help (i.e. “making the therapist want to talk to them on
the phone”), because it can be life saving for chronic sui-
cidal patients. This requires firm but flexible use of per-
sonal limits that may vary by patient, time and context.

In response to the first RCT of Linehan et al. [57], on
the effectiveness of DBT, R.E. Hoffman wrote ‘a letter to
the editor’ [58] where several comments and questions
about the trial were posed, including the comment that
for the treatment as usual (TAU) condition, telephone
consultation 24/7 is not feasible. Linehan and Heard ac-
knowledged that the availability of therapists probably
had been greater in DBT compared to TAU. However,
the actual amount of telephone calls per month did not
differ. Linehan and Heard also pointed out that there
was no correlation between the number of phone calls
and the number of parasuicide episodes in DBT, in con-
trast to TAU, where such a correlation was found.

Implementation studies and expert opinions provide
some additional insight in the clinical utility of telephone
consultation in DBT. Chugani and Landes [59] con-
ducted a survey amongst clinicians to investigate the im-
plementation of DBT in College Counseling Centers. A
frequently reported barrier to implement the standard
DBT program was the unwillingness of individual thera-
pists to offer phone consultation. Flynn et al. [60] re-
ported similar findings in a survey exploring challenges
experienced by clinical sites of implementation of DBT
in community settings. Common issues concerned ther-
apists’ reluctance, lack of management support and is-
sues regarding clinical responsibility. Landes et al. [61,
62] made a step-by-step inventory of the implementation
process of DBT in the Veterans Health Administration
(VHA) healthcare system. Barriers in the implementa-
tion of DBT in a routine setting, rated as ‘unable to
overcome’, were all related to phone consultation. In
Landes et al. [63], the authors identify four specific chal-

expected disastrous impact of phone consultation on the
therapists’
life and professional career (among others:
being called each night, burnout, inadvertently reinfor-
cing maladaptive behavior and thus enhancing suicide
risk, risk of being sued). At the same time, common er-
rors (among others:
failure to orient patients, errors
concerning contingency management, using phone con-
sultation for other needs than skill generalization, con-
tact recovery or encouragement, setting limits when they
are not crossed) and the need of support, validation and
problem solving in the therapist consultation team are
discussed. Finally, Steinberg et al. [70] emphasizes the
importance of making informed decisions concerning
parental
involvement in phone consultation, therefore
they wrote a decision-tree to assist in determining when
parental involvement is necessary with adolescents.

Videoconferencing Chu et al. [71] describe two case
studies on the DBT school refusal (DBT-SR) program.
In this program, DBT strategies were used to target
emotional and behavioural dysregulation (including in-
ternalizing problems like anxiety and depression)
in
youth that refuse to go to school. DBT for adolescents
(DBT-A) [72] served as the foundation for DBT-SR. Chu
et al. added Web-Based Coaching (WBC), via video-
conferencing, to the traditional option of phone consult-
ation. This way, both youth and parents could be present
and the therapist could directly observe and coach inter-
actions among multiple family members. WBC sessions
lasted 5 to 30 min and had a flexible format. The fre-
quency depended on the number of school days the
youth had missed the previous week. Results of two case
studies show that WBC seemed to provide unique value
that improved generalizability of skill acquisition and a
sense of support. Both youth, parents and therapists
commented that WBC helped increase morning struc-
ture, provided real-time assessment and encouragement/
support, and helped youth and parents practice skills at
critical times.

Efficacy and clinical utility of telepsychology in other modes

Internet We found two controlled trials about the effi-
internet-delivered DBT skills training. Lungu
cacy of
[44] developed and evaluated the effectiveness of a com-
puterized, transdiagnostic DBT skills training for Emo-
tion Regulation (iDBT-ER) for adults with a wide range
of psychopathology. This online intervention consisted
of 81-h weekly sessions: the first two sessions focused on
mindfulness skills, followed by six sessions on emotion
regulation skills. Every session followed the same struc-
session material, mindfulness
ture: an overview of

practice, homework review, teaching new skills (using
videos), practicing new skills (variety of online assign-
ments), assigning new homework and anticipating po-
tential obstacles. Results of this pilot were compared to
a matched historical control group who received face-to-
face DBT skills training (DBT-ST). Participants of the
iDBT-ER reported progress in all of the primary out-
comes, namely emotion dysregulation, psychopathology
(anxiety, depression), general distress, DBT skills prac-
tice and mindfulness skills practice. Compared to the
historical control group, pre-post effect sizes were simi-
lar for skills practice. Pre-post effect sizes were lower for
iDBT-ER concerning anxiety, depression and general
distress. Compared to DBT-ST,
iDBT-ER reported a
strong and significant increase in self-reported mindful-
ness (See Table 1).

Wilks et al. [50, 51, 73, 74] performed an RCT to
evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of an
eight-session internet delivered DBT skills training inter-
vention (iDBT-ST), for suicidal adults who engage in
heavy episodic drinking. Each session lasted approxi-
mately 30–50 min and included 2–3 new DBT skills.
Each skill was introduced via a short video. Finally, par-
ticipants engaged in interactive and guided practice. At
the end of each session, participants selected a home-
work exercise. Participants received DBT worksheets
and were encouraged via daily emails and/or text messa-
ging. One third of all participants completed the
training. No clinical differences were found between
drop-outs and completers of iDBT-ST (See Table 1). Re-
sults showed that technical problems appeared to pose
barriers to treatment feasibility and completion. How-
ever, over the four-month study period, an immediate
and significant reduction in suicidal
ideation, alcohol
use, alcohol quantity and frequency and emotion regula-
tion compared to the waiting list controls was found,
with large effect sizes for suicidal ideation and alcohol
consumption.

Videoconferencing Salamin et al. [42] compared the
diary card data of seven patients suffering from border-
line personality disorder during two periods: 8 weeks
prior to confinement (i.e., set of measures to slow down
the spread of COVID-19) and during 8 weeks of con-
finement. From the 16th of March 2020 to the 26th of
April 2020, individual therapy, DBT skills training and
consultation team meetings were only possible by means
of phone consultation or videoconferencing. Moreover,
DBT skills training was limited to 45 min (instead of 2
h) per week and was provided individually. Using a
multilevel approach, they found a significant decrease in
self-reported binge-eating, fear, shame/ guilt and tension
even when they switched to videoconferencing. At the
including suicidal

behaviour, NSSI, anger outbursts, and experiences in-
cluding sadness, anger, happiness, emptiness and suicidal
ideation did not change significantly in this period of
time. Self-reported distress increased significantly (See
Table 1).

Lopez et al. [43] performed a pilot study comparing
group cohesion between patients who participated in a
DBT skills training group via Video Teleconferencing
(VTC) and an in-person DBT group. The primary diag-
nosis of the patients was depression but patients with bi-
polar and anxiety disorders were also included. Results
show that the relationship with the facilitator and the
feeling of their learning capacity did not differ between
the two groups. There was a significant difference on the
relation to member interaction and group cohesion be-
tween the two groups (Table 1). The VTC group found
it harder to connect with each other in the virtual envir-
onment. Compared to the in-person DBT group, the
VTC group had a significant better attendance although
they reported that attending the group via telehealth
would not have been their first choice. Treatment via
VTC was preferable to no treatment at all.

Concerning the clinical utility, one survey study and
one expert opinion was found. Lakeman and Crighton
[75] conducted a survey amongst clinicians to explore
the impact of the COVID-19 measures on various DBT
programmes for patients with BPD and obstacles to en-
gaging with patients and colleagues via online platforms.
Results show that the primary obstacles to providing
DBT via online platforms were service and clinician
centred obstacles. Few clinicians expressed confidence in
being able to adapt to online DBT. Clinicians had no ex-
perience of using online platforms and some did not
have access to internet or privacy in their home environ-
ment. The authors concluded that clinicians need to be
supported through education, supervision and coaching
in the use of telehealth interventions.

O’Hayer [76] highlighted challenges and opportunities
of comprehensive DBT for BPD via the online video
conferencing platform ZOOM. Challenges in the skills
training were that patients tended to get distracted, feel
ashamed or disconnect. Opportunities included using
the chat function to communicate with participants,
spontaneous ‘virtual tours’ during the break and the abil-
ity to choose a screen name. Challenges for the individ-
treatment were less engagement and increased
ual
concerns about the therapist being distracted. Overall,
patients reported that they felt less connected.

Video Waltz et al. [77] performed an RCT to evaluate
the feasibility of a psychoeducational video to learn
adults with BPD naïve to DBT a novel DBT skill. In the
experimental condition participants viewed the experi-
mental video first and watched the control video after a

week (designed to control time, attention and repeated
testing). In the control group the order was reversed.
Follow up was 1 week later. In the experimental video
Marsha Linehan taught ‘opposite action’, part of the
emotion regulation module of DBT [78]. Twenty percent
of the participants dropped out. All remaining partici-
pants used the opposite action skill one or more times
in the week after watching the experimental video. At
follow-up, a significant reduction in painful emotions
was reported as well as an increase in knowledge, in-
crease in expectations of a positive outcome, and high
satisfaction after watching the video of opposite action
(Table 1).

Efficacy and clinical utility of adding telepsychology to
standard DBT modes, −strategies, −procedures (RQ3)

Mobile (web) application Four trials provided data on
the efficacy and clinical utility of DBT mobile applica-
tions. Rodante et al. [46] investigated the acceptability
and preliminary effectiveness of an interactive mobile-
health application in 18 adults who participated in DBT
at least a month and showed suicidal behaviours or
NSSI. The app, named CALMA, provided DBT skills
and evidence-based tools to prevent suicide. There were
four modalities: “out of crisis”, “I need help”, “problem-
solving” and “emergency”. The emergency modality pro-
vides users with their emergency contacts and the possi-
bility
is
automatically activated if the app detects that distress
does not decrease after three attempts to use skills.
Bayesian analysis2 showed a high probability of de-
ideation (p = .966), suicidal plan (p =
creased suicidal
.849), suicidal gesture (p = .760), thoughts about NSSI
(p = .909) and NSSI
(p = .826)
in the group where
CALMA was added to DBT. The authors reported a
high probability of a greater decrease in suicidal ideation
and NSSI in DBT + CALMA, compared to DBT only.
However, all interval of the comparisons included zero.
The app also showed good acceptability by users.

Rizvi et al. [47] explored the feasibility of a DBT Coach
smartphone app for the emotion regulation skill ‘oppos-
ite action’. Adults diagnosed with BPD and a comorbid-
ity with substance abuse disorders, already in standard
DBT treatment, received a smartphone with the app for
10–14 days, which they could use whenever needed. The
app consisted of instructions on how to apply the oppos-
ite action skill, and mindfulness. Each app usage started
intensity and
and ended with a rating on emotional
urges to use drugs on a 0–10 Likert scale. The app was

cance testing and Bayesian procedures, we decided to cite the primary
outcomes of Rodante et al. in the text instead of Table 1

Page 9 of 15

on average used 15 times over the course of 13 days.
Participants reported that the use of the app strength-
ened their knowledge and self-efficacy in execution of
the skill. The intensity of the emotions and the urge to
abuse substances decreased significantly after usage and
finally a decrease in depression, psychological distress
and in overall substance use during the trial was found
(See Table 1). An extended version of the DBT Coach
was evaluated by Rizvi, Hughes and Thomas [48]. The
app was used by adults diagnosed with BPD and had a
recent history of NSSI. The app was used as an add on
to 6 months of standard DBT. The app included skills
from mindfulness, emotion regulation, interpersonal ef-
fectiveness and distress tolerance. Results showed a re-
duction in distress and in urges of self-harm directly
after using the app. Frequency of use did not correlate
with treatment outcomes, except for the frequency of
NSSI episodes, where higher use led to fewer episodes
(See Table 1). Over 90% of the participants reported that
the app was easy to understand and to use, and that they
would use the app if available outside the trial.

Schroeder et al. [79] developed “Pocket Skills”, a mo-
bile web app that uses texts, videos and images of Mar-
sha Linehan to teach DBT-skills (i.e. basics, mindfulness,
emotion regulation, distress tolerance and addiction). A
conversational agent promotes engagement to the app
and use of the skills. Pocket Skills also gives access to a
DBT diary card day by day. Participants were adults di-
agnosed with depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder
(GAD), BPD, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or
bipolar disorder. Schroeder et al. conducted a 4-week
field study. Participants were randomized in two groups.
The experimental group received semi-personalized text
messages each morning like ‘One of your mindfulness
goals is to reduce pain, tension and stress! Keep prac-
ticing mindfulness skills!’. The other group received non-
personalized text messages. Depression, anxiety and dys-
functional coping decreased, and the use of DBT skills
increased (Table 1). Participants who received daily
semi-personalised messages practiced more skills, which
resulted in faster improvements. However, we found no
information about the randomization process and the
number of participants in each group. The app was rated
‘very usable’. Exit-survey data confirmed that Pocket
Skills helped patients to stay engaged in DBT and prac-
tice their skills.

Four articles contained descriptions of clinical utility
by opinions and qualitative data on DBT-applications for
smartphones and tablets. Austin et al. [80] evaluated a
smartphone application that was developed to support
DBT. Participants who were receiving DBT used the
app. Overall, there was a positive perception of the app’s
efficacy and usability. Helweg-Joergensen et al. [49] de-
veloped a smartphone application as an adjunct to DBT

to fill in DBT diary cards, called mDiary. Adults who
were enrolled in active DBT treatment used the app for
at least 4 weeks. The diary card data could be consulted
by therapists online. The authors concluded that the
mDiary App was an acceptable and relevant innovation
for both patients and therapists, although patients expe-
rienced a better usability than therapists. Cristol [81] de-
scribes the perspective of one BPD patient in DBT on
how using technology in DBT can be validating and
helpful
in discovering typical responses to common
stressors. This patient tried several mobile applications
and found ‘Daylio’ most useful. The usage of this app
helped this patient to minimize stigma as using a smart-
phone is a common habit, in contrast to filling our diary
cards using paper and pencil. Washburn and Parrish
[45] described their experience with the DBT Self-Help
mobile application, that gives access to key DBT skill
sets such as mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional
regulation and interpersonal effectiveness. They recom-
mended the application for patients already enrolled in a
DBT program.

Virtual reality Looking first at the treatment efficacy,
Navarro-Haro et al. [82] evaluated the virtual reality Dia-
lectical Behavior Therapy (VR DBT) mindfulness skills
training in a pre-post study with patients with a GAD.
Patients were randomly assigned to a Mindfulness-Based
Intervention (MBI) with or without 10 min of VR DBT
Mindfulness skills training. The MBI consisted of seven
modules, once a week. Following the first six sessions of
the MBI, half of the participants also took part in six in-
dividual 10-min sessions of VR DBT mindfulness skills
training. During the VR DBT mindfulness skills sessions,
a participant made use of a headset, float down a 3D
computer-generated river while listening to one of three
mindfulness skills training audio tracks. The audio tracks
‘observing visuals’ and ‘wise
were ‘observing sound’,
mind’. Both groups showed a significant decrease in
GAD symptoms (see Table 1). The MBI plus VR DBT
group retained significantly more participants than the
MBI group alone. Additional pre-post
improvements
showed that the MBI plus VR DBT group improved in
the non-judging facet of mindfulness, the interference
subscale of the Emotion Regulation Scale and the state
of relaxation after all the VR DBT sessions.

There are three studies concerning the clinical utility
of virtual reality. First, Navarro-Haro et al. [83] investi-
gated the clinical utility of virtual reality (VR) by using
immersive VR to facilitate mindfulness skills training in
DBT, as described above. They wrote a case study of a
32-year-old woman diagnosed with BPD and substance
use disorder who received standard DBT. Key measure-
ments were administered before and after each VR DBT
mindfulness skills training session and results showed

van Leeuwen et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation            (2021) 8:26 

Page 10 of 15

that urges to commit suicide, self-harm, quit therapy,
use substances and negative emotions measured by the
diary card were all reduced after each VR mindfulness
session.

Gomez et al. [84] used the VR DBT mindfulness skills
training in a case study of a 21-year-old male with severe
skin burn covering one third of his body. The primary
assessment consisted of measurements of post-traumatic
stress disorder, mindfulness acceptance and positive and
negative emotions before and after each VR DBT skills
training. Results show that the patient accepted the VR
DBT and wanted to continue using mindfulness. There
was a small reduction in PTSD symptoms after four VR
DBT sessions and the reduction in negative emotions
was most pronounced after the first VR DBT session but
decreased even more the second time and stayed near
zero the third and fourth time. Positive emotions were
very high after the VR DBT sessions. The same virtual
reality enhanced DBT mindfulness skills training was
used by Flores et al. [85]. They describe a case study in-
vestigating the feasibility of the virtual reality enhanced
DBT (VR DBT) mindfulness skills training for two pa-
tients with spinal cord injury. The primary assessment
consisted of measurements of depression, anxiety and
positive and negative emotions before and after each VR
DBT skills training. Results showed that patients not
only accepted VR as part of their treatment, but also
liked using it. Both patients showed a reduction in rat-
ings of depression, nervousness/anxiety and reported be-
ing less emotionally upset after the VR DBT skills
training. Patient 1 showed also a reduction of negative
emotions, where the negative emotions of patient 2 in-
creased directly after the VR DBT mindfulness skills
session.

(DBT-PTSD)

Computer program Görg et al. [86] examined the ac-
ceptance and feasibility of the computer program MOR-
PHEUS, as a part of a Dialectical Behavior Therapy Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder
residential
treatment, that allows computer-assisted in sensu expos-
ure and exercise in self-management during the treat-
ment of PTSD. MORPHEUS can be used to record, and
listen to the recordings of, in sensu exposure sessions.
Meanwhile playing the recorded sessions patients moni-
tor their level of distress and state dissociation. If the
level of state dissociation is too high, MORPHEUS offers
one of the 15 diverse skills in order to regulate them-
selves. Patients received a 12-week multicomponent resi-
dential treatment based on the principles of DBT. All
participants were diagnosed with PTSD and used
MORPHEUS as often as it was required in the standard
DBT-PTSD protocol, that is, at least 2 to 5 times a week.
Results show that patients found the skills helpful to
block dissociation and wanted to use the program again

in therapy and would recommend this program to a
friend. Meanwhile, patients rather used their DBT skills
during exposure instead of using the digital skills in
MORPHEUS.

Discussion
We conducted a scoping review to help DBT-therapists
make empirically supported decisions about the use of
telepsychology during and after the current pandemic
and to anticipate the changing digital needs of patients
and clinicians.

of

in

support

Our first focus was the efficacy and clinical utility of
telepsychology in standard DBT, i.e. using telecom for
between-session-contact,
skills
generalization. The literature provides us with valuable
information about using telephone and videoconferenc-
ing to support this mode of treatment. Despite the fact
that telephone was the first technology that was used to
provide between-session coaching, quantitative informa-
tion on efficacy and utility of phone coaching by the in-
dividual therapist remains limited. We found data about
frequency of out of session contact [52–54], percentages
for which calls are made in telephone consultation [53,
54], associations between out of session contact and de-
crease in drop out and greater change of psychological
symptoms [52]. However, an RCT about the added value
of out of office availability is missing. This is striking,
given the function telephone consultation has, the fact
that this treatment mode is a key barrier for the imple-
mentation of DBT [59–63] and that experts describe
how out of office availability places a substantial strain
on DBT teams. A RCT in suicidal BPD patients that
compares 24/7 access to between-session coaching pro-
vided by the individual therapist versus another service/
application versus no between-session coaching is deli-
cate. However, a trial performed by Nadort et al., about
the added value of telephone availability in schema fo-
cused therapy (SFT) for BPD, suggests that it is feasible
[87]. An alternative would be to build on previous work
of Oliviera and Rizvi [53] and collect more fine-grained
data on the between-sessions contact in ongoing and fu-
ture DBT –trials. As there is a strong increase of re-
search into DBT [87], a meta-analysis on the subject
could be within reach.

Our second focus was to identify research about tele-
psychology in DBT modes of treatment that are usually
provided face-to face (i.e. individual therapy, skills train-
ing or consultation team). Quantitative studies on indi-
therapy or DBT skills training by means of
vidual
communication
synchronous
videoconferencing
with trainers and peers) or blending face-to-face individ-
ual therapy with interactive online modules (i.e. asyn-
chronous communication with trainers) are scarce, and
in an early phase of clinical research: evaluating

feasibility, acceptance and usability. We did not find
RCTs that tested the hypothesis that online or blended
DBT is superior or at least equally effective as standard,
face-to-face DBT. At the same time, we observe a steady
increase of online or blended care in clinical practice,
with the coronavirus pandemic as a catalyst [7, 26, 27].
In the absence of sufficient evidence, we think it is advis-
able to return to face-to-face contact as soon as possible
and to remain aware of selection bias, confirmation bias
and technology optimism. Cautioning against bias is not
the same as stating that online or blended DBT is not ef-
ficacious or useless. Despite the concerns and challenges
that were reported (i.e. technical
issues, difficulties to
achieve connectedness and group cohesion [43, 74, 75],
we found no reports of serious adverse events or loss of
learning
to
videoconferencing-platforms during the pandemic [42,
74, 75]. Treatment via videoconferencing was preferable
to no treatment at all [74]. In addition, the results of
pre-post studies about acquiring DBT-skills by means of
internet-delivered modules [44, 50, 51, 73] and the psy-
choeducational video [76] are promising. The next step
is to test the efficacy of online or blended DBT in trials
with more sophisticated methodologies, and to under-
stand what works for whom, why and in what circum-
stances. Recent RCTs
that were performed in the
adjacent field of telepsychology in DBT-trainings and
-supervision for clinicians can be a source of inspiration
[19–24].

The third and last focus was to review the efficacy
or clinical utility of adding telepsychology to standard
DBT modes, −strategies, −procedures and skills. We
did not find a trial that investigated the added value
of standard DBT + telepsychology in comparison to
standard DBT. However, smartphone apps are experi-
enced as an acceptable facilitator in access and im-
plantation of DBT skills and led to decrease of a
broad range of psychopathology [46–48, 78–80]. One
patient described how usage of an application could
help to minimalize stigma, as the use of a smartphone
is experienced as a common habit [72]. The advan-
tages of a mobile application is that daily personal
(text) messages can be added to support using the
app.
semi-
Individuals who received such daily
personalised messages practice more skills than those
who do not, which results in faster improvement [48].
Future applications could extend current functional-
ities,
for example by creating tailored and gamified
content, easily accessible at the right place and time
[88]. It is also worth investigating to what extent ad-
vanced mobile applications could be a assistive tech-
nology
the
implementation of out of office availability. Further-
more, we could add the use of wearables to passively

for DBT therapists,

especially

in

monitor patients’ state and become even more effect-
ive in orienting patients to DBT skills when they need
them the most [89, 90]. In line with the positive ex-
periences of using mobile applications, the prelimin-
ary results of using VR to facilitate mindfulness skills
training are positive [45, 82–84]. The usage of VR
helped preventing drop-out in GAD patients [45] and
two case studies showed that patients liked using VR
[83, 84].

In our introduction, we stated that is important to
anticipate the needs of future patients and clinicians
[90–93]. In performing our scoping review we could
not help but wonder whether we aren’t always a
couple of steps behind of our youngest patients. For
example, we know from clinical practice that patients
in DBT skills training groups stay in touch via mobile
apps and social media, to share information and to
support each other. There are podcasts, youtubers
and influencers that discuss DBT-skills. These phe-
nomena may have a larger impact on acquisition and
generalization of DBT skills than we think (for better
or for worse). At the same time, we know that people
build identities and friendships online, and that con-
flicts, ostracism, bullying and abuse are increasingly
taking place in virtual environments. Maybe it is time
to add worksheets about ‘digital technology skills’
in
the next DBT skills manual? The point here is that,
more than ever, we think that it is wise to consult
with our patients, younger peers and experts in adja-
cent fields if we want to remain accessible, effective
and relevant in a digital age.

Conclusion
A shift towards videoconferencing and online trainings
is justifiable if it is the only way to get an evidence-based
treatment like DBT to patients that need it. However,
current research evidence does not support a permanent
shift towards online or blended DBT. It is pivotal and
timely to increase efforts to investigate the efficacy of
online/ blended DBT, compared to standard face-to-face
DBT. In addition, we need to gain insight into the bene-
fits of out-of-office availability (e.g. ‘phone consultation)
as a standard module of DBT for suicidal patients.
Lastly, other technologies should continue to be ex-
plored, as smartphone applications, virtual reality, social
media platforms, podcasts, semi-automated online com-
munication and more, all hold promise for assessment,
skill acquisition and generalization. We need to move
forward on this, to improve both the range and effective-
ness of existing approaches, to address the high demand
for professional support and to anticipate the needs of
