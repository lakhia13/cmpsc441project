Abstract: Background: A four-level community-based intervention aiming simultaneously to improve the care for depression and to prevent
suicidal behavior has been implemented in the German city Munich. Aims: Changes in suicide rates in Munich during 2009–2014 were analyzed
with respect to a 10-year baseline. The same was true for a control region (Cologne) and Germany minus Munich. Method: The interventions
included training of primary care providers, a public awareness campaign, training of community facilitators, and support for patients and
relatives. Analyses included repeated-measures, generalized linear models. Results: In Munich, the suicide rate significantly decreased during
the intervention period compared to baseline (percentage change = (cid:1)15.0%; p < .001, 198 compared to 222 suicides per year). Differences in the
change for Munich and the change for the control locations (Cologne; (cid:1)1.7%; p = .71) and Germany minus Munich ((cid:1)6.2%; p = .09) were not
significant. Limitations: Data on suicide attempts were unavailable. Conclusion: In Munich, a clinically and statistically significant decrease in
suicide rate was found. This change was numerically but not significantly larger than in the control regions. The results are promising, however.
Because of low suicide base rates and limited power, no strong conclusions can be drawn concerning suicide preventive effects of the
intervention.

Keywords: depression, suicide, Munich Alliance Against Depression

The risk of suicidal behavior is strongly increased in pa-
tients with mental disorders, especially depressive disor-
ders (Chesney et al., 2014). Improving the treatment of
depressive disorders should therefore be an important
element in suicide prevention programs. In this context,
interest
community-based interventions are of special
because they are promising tools for both prevention of
suicidal behavior and improvements regarding the care of
patients with depression (Hegerl et al., 2013, 2021; World
Health Organization, 2012; Zalsman et al., 2016). So far,
many suicide prevention studies focus on changes of
knowledge and awareness of depression, and far fewer
studies examine with sufficient statistical power whether
corresponding campaigns have significant effects on the
number of suicides (Pirkis et al., 2019).

Multifaceted community-based interventions have been
shown to be the most promising approach to reduce sui-
cidal acts (suicides and suicide attempts); in this context,
the most broadly implemented and evaluated concept is
the four-level intervention approach of the European and
the German Alliance Against Depression (GAAD; Hegerl

et al., 2021). Intervention effects of such programs were
studied using suicidal acts (suicides and suicide attempts)
as the primary outcome. Suicides and suicide attempts
were combined in these studies to increase the statistical
power and to reduce the risk of overlooking clinically
relevant effects. Compared to control regions, significant
effects were found in several, although not all, studies
(Hegerl et al., 2006, 2010, 2019).

Suicide rates were used as the primary outcome in other
regions where data on attempted suicides were not
available. Significant reductions compared to baseline and
control regions were reported for the cities Regensburg
(Germany; Hübner-Liebermann et al., 2010) and Szolnok
(Hungary; Sz´ekely et al., 2013).

Because of the promising findings from the model
project in Nuremberg (Hegerl et al., 2006, 2010), similar
community-based interventions have been implemented
in other German cities and regions (to date, in more than
85 German cities and communities). Among these is
Munich, the third largest German city. The aim of this
study is to analyze changes of suicide rates in Munich

interventions in Munich
during 6 years of four-level
compared to a 10-year baseline. These changes were
then compared to those in the fourth largest German city
(Cologne) and to those in Germany without Munich. The
latter analysis, however, was performed bearing in mind
that the statistical power is low and the risk is high of
overlooking even highly relevant antisuicidal effects.
According to an effect size analysis even for a 6-year
intervention period and cities of this size, differences
between the intervention region (Munich) and a control
region (Cologne) regarding the decline of suicides being
smaller than 28.84% are likely not to become statisti-
cally significant (Faul et al., 2007; for details, see Text
E1 in Electronic Supplementary Material 1 [ESM 1]).
Therefore, data are presented in a more descriptive
manner.

Through exploratory analyses, we investigated effects of
the Munich Alliance Against Depression on the suicide
rates for several subgroups (males, females, and four age
groups: <25; 25–44; 45–64; > 64 years), too.

Materials and Methods

Regions

The intervention region (city of Munich) is a large city in the
south of Germany and the capital of the federal state Ba-
varia with 1,562,096 inhabitants (time point: December 31,
2020; Rzehak, 2021). Munich is characterized by a com-
prehensive psychiatric and psychotherapeutic care system
including Departments of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at

two university medical centers. These institutions are
supplemented by outpatient care provided by more than
400 psychotherapists and more than 140 psychiatrists.

The control region (Cologne) is a large city in the
state North Rhine-Westphalia with
German federal
1,088,040 inhabitants (time point: December 31, 2020;
Reker, 2021). So far, Cologne is the only German city of
over one million inhabitants without a local alliance
against depression. Psychiatric care in Cologne is provided
by three psychiatric hospitals which are supplemented by a
day clinic and further outpatient care provided by both
psychiatrists and psychotherapists. The distance between
the intervention region (Munich) and the control region
(Cologne) is about 456 km.

Suicide and population data for Munich, Cologne, and
Germany were collected by using freely available online
data files of the Central Statistical Office of Germany
(Statistisches Bundesamt, 2017).

Table 1 shows that the mean annual unemployment rate
in the observation period (2009–2014) at Cologne (9.83%)
was clearly higher than the corresponding rate in Germany
as a whole (7.22%). In contrast, the average annual un-
employment rate in Munich (2009–2014; 5.33%) was
markedly lower than the aforementioned unemployment
rates in Cologne and Germany as a whole. The proportion
of females in Cologne in the observational period was very
similar to that in Germany (51%). In Munich, it was higher
(53.50%). Although the mean proportion of inhabitants
being younger than 25 years in the observational period
were similar in all three regions (23–24%), the corre-
sponding percentage of the elderly (older than 64 years)
was lower in Munich and Cologne (17.9%) than in Ger-
many as a whole (20.8%).

The annual rate of immigration in the observational
period was much higher in Munich (80.5%) than in Co-
logne (59%) and Germany (46%). The same was true for
the mean household income (Munich: 2,172 €; Cologne
and Germany: <1,700 €).

Regarding the health service access in the observational
period as measured by the mean number of hospital beds
per 1,000 inhabitants, it was best in Munich (8.31) and
worst in Germany as a whole (6.18), with this number
being in between for Cologne (7.14).

Intervention Activities Within the Multilevel
Suicide Prevention Program

In the GAAD concept, suicide prevention is aimed via
activities implemented simultaneously at
levels
(Hegerl et al., 2006, 2013). The GAAD program is man-
ualized and includes a step-by-step guide on how to be
active on each of the four levels of the GAAD program and
how to coordinate the simultaneous implementation of
these activities.

four

Level 1: Primary care physicians are trained by using
materials such as patient screening questionnaires, bro-
chures for educational purposes, and tools to support the
recognition and treatment of depressive disorders in pri-
mary care.

Level 2: Targeting the general public, a professional
awareness campaign concerning depression is implemented
with the key messages: “Depression can hit everybody,”
“Depression has many faces,” and “Depression can be
treated.”

Level 3: Training is provided to gatekeeper and com-
munity facilitators such as geriatric care givers, pharma-
cists, teachers, police officers, clergy, and social workers.
Further activities include the implementation of a media
guide for journalists to improve media coverage of suicide
and to reduce the risk of imitation suicides.

Level 4: This level comprises support for patients with
depression and their relatives. A variety of information
materials were provided, self-help groups were supported,

leisure activities were organized, crisis lines were im-
plemented, and online discussion forums for patients with
depressive disorders and their relatives were offered.

Table 2 summarizes the intensity of the interventions
targeting suicide prevention and an optimized care for
depression in Munich in the first 6 years after the foun-
dation of the Munich Alliance Against Depression.

Outcomes

The outcome variable was the annual rate of suicides as
provided by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany
(Statistisches Bundesamt, 2017). Suicides were defined as
intentional self-harm, resulting in death according to the
International Classification of Diseases and related health
problems, 10th revision (World Health Organization,
1992), categories X60–X84. In this context, suicide rates
were defined as the number of suicides per 100,000 in-
habitants for Munich, Cologne, and Germany minus
Munich.

Statistical Analysis

For pre–post comparisons, the mean suicide rates per year in
the 6-year intervention period for the Munich Alliance
Against Depression (2009–2014) and the 10-year baseline
period (1998–2007) were calculated and compared by using
Mann–Whitney U tests (due to the small sample size). To
estimate the incidence ratio of the annual suicide rate be-
tween the intervention and baseline periods, a negative bi-
nomial regression for modeling count variables was chosen.
Using the negative binomial regression model that is ap-
propriate for the analysis of rare events and has less re-
strictions than the Poisson regression model, the incidence
ratios for the suicide rate and the resulting percentage
changes (PCs; PC = [incidence ratio (cid:1) 1] × 100) could be
computed.

Moreover, changes in suicide rates in Munich com-
pared to baseline were compared to corresponding

changes in Cologne and in Germany without Munich by
applying repeated-measures, generalized linear models
with a negative binomial distribution and a log-link func-
tion. The independent variables in the full model were
“region” (Munich vs. Cologne; Munich vs. Germany minus
Munich), “period” (0 = baseline period, 1 = intervention pe-
riod), and the interaction of the factors region and period. A
significant interaction between region and period would
mean that the dependent variables (suicide rate) differen-
tially change over time between the two regions.

Analogous analyses were performed for the following
subgroups: males, females, and four age groups: <25;
25–44; 45–64; >64 years.

All statistical tests were two-tailed, and the significance

level was set at α = .05.

Results

Mann–Whitney U tests revealed that the suicide rate sig-
nificantly decreased during the 2009–2014 intervention
period compared with the baseline period (1998–2007) in
Munich (PC = (cid:1)15.0%; U = 0; p < .001), but not in the control

whereas the corresponding decline in Cologne was not
statistically significant (PC = (cid:1)5.3%; U = 25; p = .64).

For younger individuals (age: <25 years), significant
changes in suicide rates during the intervention period as
compared to the baseline period did not occur in any region.
In contrast, the suicide rates for individuals aged 25–44
years significantly decreased during the intervention pe-
riod compared with baseline in all three selected regions
(PC: (cid:1)23.2% to (cid:1)33.2%; U ≥ 3; p ≤ .031).

A corresponding significant change of suicide rates in
individuals aged 45–64 years was restricted to Germany
minus Munich (PC = (cid:1)3.1%; U = 9; p = .022).

Suicide frequencies and rates are shown in Table 3, and
the corresponding trend plots for the total population are
presented in Figure 1.

The PCs of suicide rates during the intervention period
as compared to the baseline period are summarized in
Table 4. In this context, the absolute value for the dif-
ference in the change in suicides for Munich and the
change for Cologne (13.3%) was lower than the critical
cutoff value derived from the corresponding effect size
estimation (28.84%).

A numerically more pronounced decline in annual
rates for suicides in Munich compared with corre-
sponding changes for the control regions Cologne and
Germany minus Munich was found. For five of six sub-
groups, effects in the expected direction (more pro-
nounced decrease in suicide rates in Munich in the
intervention period as compared to the control regions)
were found. Only for younger individuals (age < 25 years),

a paradoxical trend (increase in suicide rates in Munich
during the intervention period vs. decrease of suicide
rates in the control regions in this period) was present.
However, according to the generalized linear models with
the predictors region and period, there were no significant
region × period interactions regarding suicide rates (see
Table E1 in ESM 1).

Discussion

Overall Effects of the Interventions on
Suicide Rates in Munich

A clinically and statistically significant reduction in suicide
rates (PC = (cid:1)15.0%) was observed during the 6-year four-
level intervention in Munich compared to a 10-year baseline.
The effect was clinically significant in view of 24 fewer
suicides in Munich compared to baseline (mean baseline
frequency: 222; see Table 3). In the same time period, no
significant decline in suicide rates was observed in the control
regions Cologne and Germany without Munich. This re-
duction was observed despite the fact that the interventions
within the Munich Alliance Against Depression in the 6-year
intervention period were not performed with sufficient in-
tensity at all four levels: In the first intervention year (2009),
general practitioners had not been trained in Munich at all,
and in the intervention years (2012 and 2014), posters had
not been distributed in Munich.

R. Mergl et al., Munich Alliance Against Depression

As expected by the power analysis, this decline did not
significantly differ from corresponding changes in the
control regions (city of Cologne [PC = (cid:1)1.7%] and Ger-
many minus Munich [PC = (cid:1)6.2%]. The same was true for
subgroup analyses focusing on age and gender. Thus, the
corresponding findings have to be interpreted with much
caution.

It could be argued that the implementation of all four
levels of our multicomponent community-based inter-
vention was not necessary to be effective regarding
suicide prevention. In this context, it has to be empha-
sized that Harris et al. (2016) could show for a similar
multilevel community-based intervention program im-
plemented in the context of the OSPI-Europe research
project that all four countries which had conducted
suicide prevention according to this program had been
able to achieve synergistic effects adding value beyond
the sum of separate intervention levels (see also Hegerl
et al., 2019). Thus, it can be concluded (see Hegerl &
Kohls, 2016, p. 179) that “the complexity of the syner-
gistic causal chains in multi-level community-based in-
terventions makes it rather unfeasible to single out the
specific size of the contribution to the suicide preventive
effect of a certain measure in the entirety of the multi-
level intervention.”

Methodological Strengths and Limitations

One strength of the Munich Alliance Against Depression
is the fact that it refers to a well-established multilevel
intervention model (Hegerl et al., 2021) and enabled the
evaluation of a complex community-based suicide pre-
vention program with a 6-year intervention period. The
intervention and control region consisting of two large
German cities was a further strength of our study.
Several limitations should also be mentioned:

1. A major shortcoming is that data on attempted sui-
cides were not available. Using suicides and suicide
attempts combined as the primary outcome would
have clearly increased the statistical power. Without
attempted suicide data, the statistical power was too
low to detect even clinically highly relevant anti-
suicidal effects.

2. The selection of the control region Germany minus
Munich could be criticized in view of the fact that a
variety of suicide prevention activities were ongoing in
a high number of German regions in the intervention
and baseline period (see K¨ohler et al., 2021; National
Suicide Prevention Program: https://www.suizidprae-
vention-deutschland.de/). However, their intensity is
not well-documented, and therefore, we refrained from
region
excluding these regions from the control

Germany. We excluded only Munich (Germany minus
Munich).

3. Other possible metrics and markers of effectiveness were
not analyzed in view of limited resources. For example, it
would have been very interesting to address the question
whether the positive effects of the Munich Alliance
Against Depression regarding the reduction of the num-
ber of suicides had been associated with higher pre-
scription rates of antidepressant drugs, improved attitudes
toward patients with depressive disorders, treatment of
depression and suicide prevention, lower personal de-
pression stigma, and enhanced confidence in general
practitioners regarding the clinical management of de-
pression and suicidality (Hegerl et al., 2019).

Conclusions

The Munich Alliance Against Depression was associated
with a significant and clinically relevant decrease in the
general suicide rates in the 6-year intervention period
(2009–2014; (cid:1)15%). This provides further support for the
antisuicidal effect of the four-level intervention concept, as
shown in previous studies (Hübner-Liebermann et al.,
2010; Sz´ekely et al., 2013).

However, statistical power was low due to the fact that data
on attempted suicides were not available. Therefore, an
overall decline in suicide rates compared to control regions
(Cologne, Germany minus Munich) could not be shown.
