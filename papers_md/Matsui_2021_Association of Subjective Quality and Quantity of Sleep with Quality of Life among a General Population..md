Abstract: This study aimed to determine whether both subjective sleep quality and sleep duration
are directly associated with quality of life (QOL), as well as indirectly associated with QOL through
insomnia symptoms. Individuals aged 20–69 years without mental illness (n = 9305) were enrolled
in this web-based cross-sectional survey. The Short Form-8 was used to assess physical and mental
QOL. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and extracted items related to subjective
sleep quality and sleep duration. Insomnia symptoms were also extracted from the PSQI. The
hypothesized models were tested using structural equation modeling. Worse sleep quality, but not
shorter sleep duration, was related to worse physical QOL. Both worse sleep quality and shorter
sleep duration were related to worse mental QOL. Insomnia symptoms mediated these relationships.
Subgroup analyses revealed a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and physical/mental
QOL. However, the relationship between sleep quality and physical/mental QOL was consistent
regardless of sleep duration. The results suggest that subjective sleep quality has a more coherent
association with QOL than subjective sleep duration. Because of its high feasibility, a questionnaire
on overall sleep quality could be a useful indicator in future epidemiological studies of strategies for
improving QOL.

Quality of life (QOL), deﬁned as “an individual’s perception of their position in life
in the context of the culture in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations,
standards and concerns [1],” is a well-established concept in the ﬁelds of health and
medicine. QOL is useful for predicting treatment and intervention success, and can be
used as a qualitative health indicator that goes further than biomedical outcomes, such as
curing disease and survival [2].

There is a close relationship between sleep and QOL in patients with a variety of
physical and psychiatric illnesses and sleep disorders, and in the general population in

all age groups [3]. Both quantitative and qualitative aspects of subjective sleep evaluation
are reported to affect QOL. Several cross-sectional reports have indicated that short sleep
duration is associated with lower QOL in the general population [4–9]. Simultaneously, a
number of cross-sectional studies in the general population have reported that poor sleep
quality is also associated with lower QOL [9–16]. In accordance with these ﬁndings, a
recent longitudinal study reported that an increase in both sleep duration and sleep quality
contributed to the improvement in QOL [17].

Although most epidemiological studies have assessed subjective sleep quality using
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [18] as a standard measure [19], some studies
have used insomnia symptoms as a measure of sleep quality [20,21]. The PSQI has also
been used as a screening tool for insomnia [18,19]. However, insomnia symptoms are
inherently different from sleep quality measures, given that sleep quality itself reﬂects
a subjective feeling of restfulness and satisfaction with sleep [22]. Furthermore, studies
that have assessed both subjective quality and duration of sleep, in which sleep quality
was assessed using the PSQI, have shown that sleep quality is more strongly associated
with health outcomes [9,17]; however, total PSQI scores include components related to
both sleep quality and sleep duration [18], which might limit determining whether the
qualitative or quantitative components of sleep are most important.

Questionnaires measuring overall sleep quality (C1, answer to the question “During
the past month, how would you rate your sleep quality overall?”) and subjective sleep
duration (C3, answer to the question “During the past month, how many hours of actual
sleep did you get at night?”) were included in the PSQI as independent factors from other
insomnia symptoms. Furthermore, because of its high feasibility and usability, a ques-
tionnaire on subjective sleep quality may be valuable for investigating the relationships
between subjective quality of habitual sleep, QOL, and various health outcomes in epi-
demiological studies. We suspected that subjective quality and quantity of sleep might
independently affect health-related outcomes because these reﬂect different aspects of
an individual’s sleep experience; however, no studies have examined this using a single
question on subjective sleep quality and sleep duration thus far. Therefore, we set out to
conduct a preliminary cross-sectional investigation on how QOL is related to subjective
sleep quality and quantity.

The purpose of the present study was to determine how subjective quality and du-
ration of sleep inﬂuence physical and mental QOL in the general population without a
history of psychiatric disorders. We hypothesized that both worse sleep quality and shorter
sleep duration, respectively representing qualitative and quantitative assessments of sleep,
would be directly associated with worse physical and mental QOL, as well as being indi-
rectly associated with worse physical and mental QOL through insomnia symptoms. Our
goal was to clarify which qualitative and quantitative sleep assessments were more closely
associated with QOL. To address this question, we tested our hypothetical mediation
model using structural equation modeling (SEM). Although a cross-sectional study design
cannot express cause-effect relationships, SEM can reveal direct and indirect pathways of
associations separately and express complicated relationships in a path diagram [23,24].
We performed the analysis not only for the entire sample but also for three subgroups
categorized according to habitual sleep duration, based on the same hypothesis considering
the possibility of a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and QOL [5,6].

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants

The present study was conducted as part of an epidemiological study to investigate
excessive daytime sleepiness in subjects with suspected attention deﬁcit hyperactivity
disorder [8,25]. The ethics committee of the Neuropsychiatric Research Institute approved
this study. The survey was conducted in February 2015 through Rakuten Research Inc., an
online marketing research company with approximately 2.3 million registered Japanese
users. The research ﬁrm randomly contacted selected individuals between the ages of

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 12835

20 and 69 years old across the country, stratiﬁed by region, sex, and age, with an email
including links to online questionnaires. It was clearly stated that this survey was related
to sleep. Participants were provided with an informed consent form through the survey
website. Among the 10,000 subjects who completed the questionnaires, 178 subjects whose
data were missing and 517 subjects with self-reported ongoing treatment for mental illness
were excluded. Finally, 9305 subjects were included in the analysis.

2.2. Study Measures

The questionnaire in this study included demographic information regarding age,
sex, height, weight, occupation, smoking status, habitual alcohol ingestion, and the pres-
ence/absence of currently treated diseases [8,25]. Because body mass index was not
normally distributed as a continuous variable, we divided it into ﬁve groups: less than
18.5 kg/m2, 18.5 to less than 25 kg/m2, 25 to less than 30 kg/m2, 30 to less than 35 kg/m2,
and 35 kg/m2 or greater [26].

QOL was measured using the Japanese version of the Short Form-8 (SF-8) [27,28].
The SF-8 is an abbreviated version of an original 36-item health survey and contains
psychometrically based physical and mental health summary measures. Physical QOL
(physical component summary (PCS)) includes general health, physical function, role-
physical, and bodily pain; mental QOL (mental component summary (MCS)) includes
vitality, social function, mental health, and role-emotional. Scores of these domains were
calculated according to standard methods [27].

The Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [18,29] was applied
to assess sleep quality, sleep duration, and insomnia symptoms. The PSQI is a standard-
ized self-rated questionnaire developed to measure self-reported sleep disturbances. The
19 items are categorized into seven components and are evaluated with a score of 0 to
3. The PSQI components are as follows: subjective sleep quality (C1), sleep latency (C2),
sleep duration (C3), habitual sleep efﬁciency (C4), sleep disturbances (C5), use of sleeping
medication (C6), and daytime dysfunction (C7). The C5 score is calculated from answers
to nine detailed questions, including a question regarding the frequency with which the
respondents “wake up in the middle of the night or early morning” (C5a), which is also
evaluated with a score of 0 to 3. We used the C1 score to evaluate sleep quality. C1 was
scored according to the subjective rating of overall sleep quality during the past month as
follows: very good (0), fairly good (1), fairly bad (2), and very bad (3). For the assessment
of sleep duration, we used actual responses to the question on subjective sleep duration
over the past month, which was reported in hours, rather than the C3 score itself. Given
that difﬁculty falling asleep, difﬁculty maintaining sleep, and early-morning awakening
are core symptoms of insomnia [30,31], we used the C2 score to assess difﬁculty initiating
sleep and C5a score to assess difﬁculty maintaining sleep and/or waking up earlier than
desired. C2 and C5a were scored according to the frequencies of difﬁculty in falling asleep
within 30 min and waking up in the middle of the night or early morning, respectively, as
follows: not during the last month (0), less than once a week (1), once or twice a week (2),
and three or more times a week (3).

2.3. Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics and correlational analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0 J
software (IBM Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.001 to account
for the large sample size and multiple comparisons. In our prior analysis, age, categorized
BMI, and existence of currently treated diseases signiﬁcantly correlated with PCS and age,
sex, categorized BMI and existence of currently treated diseases signiﬁcantly correlated
with MCS (Spearman, p < 0.001 for all variables); therefore, we used these variables as
covariates. The kurtosis of the individual variables was examined to conﬁrm the normality
of the distributions [32]. To examine the hypothesized relationships between sleep quality,
sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and physical or mental QOL, we performed a path
analysis using SEM with Amos 26.0 (IBM Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The following hypotheses

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 12835

were proposed: (1) worse sleep quality and shorter sleep duration would be associated
with worse physical/mental QOL and (2) insomnia symptoms would partially mediate the
effect of sleep quality and sleep duration on physical/mental QOL. Two proposed path
models were run separately for physical QOL and mental QOL to test our hypotheses
(Figure 1). As subgroup analyses, these path analyses were also performed in each of
the three groups: short sleep group (≤6 h, n = 2394), intermediate sleep group (>6 h to
≤8 h, n = 6105), and long sleep group (>8 h, n = 806) [33]. These models were determined
as a good ﬁt using the following criteria: chi-squared test of model ﬁt (χ2), root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA < 0.08), non-normed ﬁt index (NFI > 0.90), and
comparative ﬁt index (CFI > 0.90) [23,24]. A bootstrapping procedure using 5000 bootstrap
samples was conducted to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of the direct and indirect effects
(mediation model) by calculating 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs), which were established
by Preacher and Hayes [34]. We have reported the standardized coefﬁcients. Thus, it was
possible that paths that were constrained to be equal in the analysis of multiple groups had
different beta coefﬁcients based on the standardized metric.

3.1. Correlation between Variables

Among the total sample (n = 9305), 4641 (49.9%) were women, 1832 (19.7%) were
current smokers, 4541 (48.8%) had habitual alcohol consumption, 5192 (55.8%) had regular
work, and 2738 (29.4%) were receiving treatment for physical disease. The means (standard
deviation) of the variables assessed in the study were as follows: age, 45.8 (13.5) years;
BMI, 22.2 (3.5) kg/m2; total PSQI score, 5.8 (3.5); PCS score, 48.6 (7.0); MCS score, 48.6
(7.6); C1 in the PSQI, 1.2 (0.7); C2 in the PSQI, 1.3 (1.6); C5a in the PSQI, 0.8 (1.1); and
habitual sleep duration, 405.2 (63.1) min. Weak correlations were found between sleep
quality and difﬁculty initiating sleep, difﬁculty maintaining sleep and/or waking up earlier
than desired, physical QOL, and mental QOL. Correlations between sleep duration and
difﬁculty initiating sleep or difﬁculty maintaining sleep and/or waking up earlier than
desired were not signiﬁcant. The correlations between sleep duration and physical QOL
and mental QOL were signiﬁcant, but both were considered to be negligible [35] (Table 1).

These models were deter-mined as a good fit using the following criteria: chi-squared test of model fit (χ2), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA < 0.08), non-normed fit index (NFI > 0.90), and comparative fit index (CFI > 0.90) [23,24].

3.2. Mediation Analysis

We examined the hypotheses in two models to assess the inﬂuence of sleep quality and
sleep duration on physical QOL (A) and mental QOL (B). All absolute kurtosis values were
less than 3.00 [36]. The model-ﬁt indices suggested that these models ﬁtted the data well:
(A) χ2 = 325.2, RMSEA = 0.058, CFI = 0.952, NFI = 0.951, and (B) χ2 = 357.4, RMSEA = 0.051,
CFI = 0.957, NFI = 0.956. Speciﬁcally, the model accounted for 10.3% of the variance in
physical QOL (A) and 18.4% of the variance in mental QOL (B). The SEM results are shown
in Figure 2.

presented. Numbers in brackets represent 95% conﬁdence intervals. Dashed lines are used to represent indirect effects, and

ﬁgure for the sake of brevity. * p < 0.001. QOL, quality of life. R2, R squared value.

In model (A), path coefﬁcients suggested that worse sleep quality was directly associ-
ated with worse physical QOL (β = 0.203, 95% CI 0.168 to 0.237; p < 0.001). The results of
bootstrapping indicated a trend for an indirect association between worse sleep quality
and worse physical QOL (β = 0.042, 95% CI 0.018 to 0.066; p = 0.001). Meanwhile, sleep
duration was not signiﬁcantly associated with physical QOL. Moreover, the results of the
bootstrapping indicated a trend for an indirect association between longer sleep duration
and worse physical QOL (β = −0.006, 95% CI −0.010 to −0.002; p = 0.001). In model (B),
path coefﬁcients suggested that worse sleep quality was directly associated with worse
mental QOL (β = 0.167, 95% CI 0.132 to 0.201; p < 0.001). The results of bootstrapping
indicated an indirect association between worse sleep quality and worse mental QOL
(β = 0.136, 95% CI 0.113 to 0.165; p < 0.001). Shorter sleep duration was also directly associ-
ated with worse mental QOL (β = 0.039, 95% CI 0.017 to 0.060; p < 0.001). However, the
results of bootstrapping indicated an indirect association between longer sleep duration
and worse mental QOL (β = −0.017, 95% CI −0.025 to −0.011; p < 0.001), which showed
the opposite direction from the direct association.

Demographic and clinical data for the three subgroups (short sleep group, intermedi-
ate sleep group, and long sleep group) are shown in Table S1. All path analyses performed
in each group showed a good model ﬁt (Table S2). The relationship between sleep quality
and physical/mental QOL was mostly consistent among the three subgroups. In the short
sleep group, unlike the results in the total sample, (1) there was a trend for a direct corre-
lation between shorter sleep duration and worse physical QOL (β = 0.056, 95% CI 0.010
to 0.105; p = 0.005), (2) the correlation between sleep duration and insomnia symptoms
was negligible in both models (A-SS, p = 0.689 and B-SS, p = 0.745), and (3) the correlation
between insomnia symptoms and physical QOL was not signiﬁcant (p = 0.067) (Figure 3).
In the long sleep group, unlike the results in the total sample, (1) there was a signiﬁcant
direct correlation between longer sleep duration and worse physical QOL (β = −0.131, 95%
CI −0.203 to −0.060; p < 0.001), (2) the correlation between sleep duration and insomnia

In the long sleep group, unlike the results in the total sample, (1) there was a sig-nificant direct correlation between longer sleep duration and worse physical QOL (β = −0.131, 95% CI −0.203 to −0.060; p < 0.001), (2) the correlation between sleep duration and insomnia symptoms was not significant in either model (A-LS, p = 0.069 and B-LS, p = 0.077), and (3) the correlation between insomnia symptoms and physical QOL was negli-gible (p = 0.927) (Figure 3). The results of the path analysis in the intermediate sleep group were identical to those for the entire sample (Table S2). Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 12835

4. Discussion

This is the ﬁrst study to examine the relationships between subjective sleep qual-
ity/quantity and QOL in the general population using PSQI sub-items. The present study
conﬁrmed the hypothesis that overall sleep quality as a subjective measure, which is one
of the items of the PSQI, signiﬁcantly correlated with both physical and mental QOL, as
well as being indirectly related through insomnia symptoms. The relationships between
sleep quality and physical or mental QOL seemed more apparent than the relationships
between sleep duration and physical or mental QOL, given that sleep quality had a con-
sistent association with both physical and mental QOL across the subgroups of sleep
duration. Some studies have assessed sleep quality using the C1 score of the PSQI as in this
study [37–39], but none of them have examined the contrast between quality and duration
of sleep. Because this is a preliminarily study suggesting an association between QOL in
a cross-sectional design, future studies should clarify how subjective sleep quality and
quantity affect future health-related indicators.

Contrary to our hypothesis, there was a clear association between longer sleep dura-
tion and insomnia symptoms; moreover, longer sleep duration was indirectly associated
with poorer mental QOL via insomnia symptoms. Those with long subjective sleep du-
ration in this study can be described as those who spent a long time in bed; for them,
sleep restriction may alleviate insomnia symptoms [40]. Sleep restriction therapy is part
of a package of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) [41,42], but it has been
suggested to be effective against insomnia symptoms when used alone [43]. Given the

Given the contri-bution of CBT-I to the improvement of QOL [44,45], the possible contribution of shortened sleep duration to improved mental and physical QOL in the long sleep group can be in-terpreted as being consistent with these previous reports. Int.

contribution of CBT-I to the improvement of QOL [44,45], the possible contribution of
shortened sleep duration to improved mental and physical QOL in the long sleep group
can be interpreted as being consistent with these previous reports.

Among the entire sample, shorter sleep duration was directly associated with worse
mental QOL. However, contrary to our hypothesis, sleep duration was not directly asso-
ciated with physical QOL. This result is consistent with some previous literature [46,47],
but differs from reports that both physical and mental QOL are associated with sleep dura-
tion [4,7]. Notably, the results of the subgroup analyses suggested that in the short sleep
group, longer sleep duration tended to correlate with better physical QOL, while in the
long sleep group, longer sleep duration signiﬁcantly correlated with worse physical QOL.
These ﬁndings suggest that the relationship between sleep duration and physical QOL was
not linear but U-shaped, which is consistent with some previous reports [5,6]. However,
regardless of the length of sleep duration, the relationship between sleep duration and
mental QOL was weak. These differences between physical and mental QOL in their rela-
tionship to sleep duration are similar to those found in studies of the general population in
the United Kingdom and United States [4]. Although the ﬁndings of this study suggest
that the relationship between sleep duration and mental QOL is modest, considering the
well-documented importance of sleep duration with respect to lower QOL [4–9,46], the
health risks of habitual short sleep duration should still be emphasized.

The current study had several limitations. First, this study used a cross-sectional
research design in which causality could not be established. Future research should
consider using an experimental or longitudinal research design to examine the associations
between sleep quality, sleep duration and QOL. Second, difﬁculty initiating sleep, difﬁculty
maintaining sleep, and early morning awakening are three independent items in the
diagnostic criteria for insomnia [30,31]; however, in the current study, difﬁculty maintaining
sleep and early morning awakening were evaluated as a single item. This limitation was
due to the design of this study, which examined the hypothesis using subscales of the
PSQI. Third, this study used an internet-based survey. It has been suggested that internet
users may have more sleep problems and sleep less, potentially biasing the sample [48]. In
addition, because the potential participants were informed in advance that the survey was
about sleep, it is possible that people interested in sleep actively chose to participate in this
study. Fourth, we excluded subjects who were receiving treatment for mental illness, which
was based on self-report and not a direct diagnosis. We may have overlooked participants
with mental illness when it was undiagnosed or undeclared.

5. Conclusions

The results of the present study suggested that subjective sleep quality was sig-
niﬁcantly associated with both physical and mental QOL and that sleep duration was
signiﬁcantly associated with mental QOL. Because sleep quality was associated with both
physical and mental QOL regardless of sleep duration, it may have the potential to inﬂu-
ence subsequent health-related outcomes. Future longitudinal studies should examine the
association between sleep quality/quantity and health outcomes using objective indicators.
