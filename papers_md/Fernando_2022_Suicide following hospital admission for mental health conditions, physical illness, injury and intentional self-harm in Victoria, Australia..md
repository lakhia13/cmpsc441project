Abstract

Objective

The majority of suicide decedents have had contact with health services close to their death.
Some of these contacts include admissions to hospitals for physical and mental health con-
ditions, injury and intentional self-harm. This study aims to establish and quantify the risks of
suicide following hospital admission for a range of mental and physical illnesses.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was carried out on existing morbidity and mortality data in Victoria.
Data was extracted from the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset and the Victorian Suicide
Register. Unplanned hospital admissions among adult patients (> = 15 years of age), dis-
charged between 01 January 2011 and 31 December 2016 (2,430,154 admissions), were
selected. Standardised Mortality Ratios were calculated for conditions with at least five
linked suicides within one year of discharge from hospital.

Results

Forty-three conditions defined at the three-digit level of the International Statistical Classifi-
cation of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision, were associated with at
least five subsequent suicides (within one year of hospital discharge); 14 physical illnesses,
5 symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, 12 mental health condi-
tions, and 12 types of injury and poisonings. The highest Standardised Mortality Ratios were
for poisonings (range; 27.8 to 140.0) and intentional self-harm (78.8), followed by mental
health conditions (range; 15.5 to 72.9), symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and labora-
tory findings (range; 1.4 to 43.2) and physical illnesses (range; 0.7 to 4.9).

Suicide post hospital admission for mental & physical health conditions, injury and ISH in Victoria

Conclusions

Hospital admissions related to mental health conditions and injury and poisonings including
self-harm were associated with a greater risk of suicide than physical conditions. Mental
health conditions such as depressive episodes, personality disorders and psychotic epi-
sodes, injuries caused by intentional-self-harm and poisonings by certain types of drugs,
carbon monoxide and hormones such as insulin can be prioritised for targeting suicide pre-
vention initiatives for persons discharged from hospitals.

Introduction

Suicide is a major public health concern globally, with an estimated 800,000 suicides occurring
worldwide every year [1]. In 2018, there were 3,046 suicides registered in Australia which
relates to 8 deaths per day [2]. Recent statistics published by the Coroner’s Court of Victoria
showed that there were 2,787 suicides in the state of Victoria between 2016 and 2019, which
averages to 697 suicides per year [3].

Studies in Western, developed countries have consistently shown that a high proportion of

people who die by suicide have a diagnosed, or diagnosable mental health condition at the
time of death [4–7]. In addition to mental health conditions, physical illness has consistently
been associated with suicide. A recent study found that physical illness was indicated as the
main reason for suicide in almost 20% of cases [8], and another study has shown a link
between hospital admissions for constipation, gastritis, diabetes, alcoholic liver disease, pneu-
monia and urinary tract infections and increased risk of suicide [9]. Studies have also shown
that certain injuries such as traumatic brain injury are likely to increase the risk of suicide [10,
11], and non-fatal suicide attempts are also strongly correlated with subsequent suicide [12–
14].

The majority of people who die by suicide have had contact with health services (i.e., gen-
eral practitioners, outpatient or inpatient services) proximal to their death [15–20]. These con-
tacts represent potential suicide prevention opportunities [16], through identification of
persons at risk of suicide, provision of treatment and/or delivery of interventions.

The main aim of this study is to establish and quantify risks of suicide following hospital
admissions for a range of mental health conditions, physical illnesses, injury and intentional
self-harm in Victoria.

Methods
Study design

A retrospective analysis of existing morbidity and mortality data in the state of Victoria, Aus-
tralia was carried out for this study.

Data sources and linkage

Morbidity data was extracted from the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset (VAED) and
mortality data was extracted from the Victorian Suicide Register (VSR) and the Victorian
Death Index (VDI).

The VAED is a unit record data file maintained by the Department of Health and Human

Services on all public and private hospital admissions in Victoria, which consists of patient
demographics and morbidity information. Morbidity information includes 40 fields related to

disease, injury and external causes, coded to the International Statistical Classification of Dis-
eases and Related Health Problems Tenth Revision, Australian Modifications (ICD-10-AM)
[21].

The VSR is an ongoing register established by the Coroners Court of Victoria and contains
information on all suspected and coroner-determined suicides reported to the Victorian Coro-
ners Court [22].

The VDI contains all death-records for Victoria, and is obtained from the Registrar of

Births, Deaths and Marriages in Victoria.

Data provision and linkage was undertaken by the Centre for Victorian Data Linkage
(CVDL). Data linkage performed by CVDL used patient-specific identifiers and deterministic
data linkage. The Coroners Court of Victoria (CCOV) supplied VSR data to CVDL via secure
data exchange portals. CVDL linked the VSR data with the VAED and VDI, and all data were
de-identified. The de-identified datasets, containing a linkage identification number, were
transferred to researchers at Monash University using the secure data exchange portal.

Study population

Inclusion criteria. The study population consisted of adults (> = 15 years of age) with
unplanned hospital admissions in Victoria, Australia, discharged between 01 January 2011
and 31 December 2016 (3,640,529 episodes) as recorded in the VAED. They were followed up
until 31 December 2017 in the VSR and VDI. Consecutive records of inward transfers from
other hospitals or statistical separations (changes in care type) within the same hospital were
considered to be part of one period of care (POC). All initial POCs, that is the POC that
included the index (initial) admission for each patient were retained for final analysis. In cases
where the patient was newly admitted subsequent to the initial POC, these records were also
retained and included as unique POCs, provided the subsequent admission took place at least
one-year post discharge of the previous admission.

Exclusion criteria. Planned admissions were excluded as some of these were for diagnos-
tic investigations (which are not always indicative of the presence of a particular disease), and
the rest were ‘elective’ medical or surgical treatment. These also include kidney patients on
routine dialysis treatments (with multiple admissions) and cancer patients on chemo therapy
etc. (with multiple admissions), which does not allow for ideal incidence estimation. The fol-
lowing were also excluded: POCs ending with a death in hospital (because the outcome-of-
interest was death following discharge), hospital admissions of intersex people (to preserve
confidentiality of small cell counts: recorded intersex status was rare), admissions with missing
principal diagnosis codes (205 admissions) and admissions with unrealistic time to death (i.e.,
admission dates occurring after the date of death: 951 records (0.03%), which could be due to
data linkage inaccuracy). The final number of episodes retained for the analysis was 2,430,154.

Outcome measure

The study outcome measure was suicide within one year of hospital discharge. The rationale
for starting the 1-year follow-up at discharge (and not at admission) was to capture only post-
discharge exposure: suicide during the hospital admission was therefore excluded.

Selection of conditions

The conditions considered for this study were physical illnesses (acute and/or chronic); injury;
symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings; and mental health conditions.
All conditions were analysed at the three-digit level in the ICD-10-AM ranging from A00-T79
appearing in the principal diagnosis field at admission. Conditions were included if they were

associated with at least five suicides within one year of discharge from hospital (43 conditions
fulfilled these criteria).

Due to known associations between intentional-self harm and subsequent suicide, admis-

sions for intentional self-harm were also examined. Intentional self-harm admissions were
selected if the external cause codes "X60" to "X84" (intentional self-harm) appeared in any of
the 40 diagnosis fields in the VAED—–this was necessary as intentional self-harm cannot be
coded as a principal diagnosis.

Independent variables

Patients were classified into three age groups (15–24, 25–64, > = 65 years), two gender groups
(male and female), three geographic region groups (metropolitan, regional/rural and
unknown/interstate/overseas) and four marital status groups (never married, married/de
facto, divorced/separated/widowed and not stated). This information was sourced from the
hospital admissions data. Socio economic status was classified as per the Socio-Economic
Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) [23], based on the patient’s area of residence. The specific SEIFA
used in this study was the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Advantage and Disadvantage;
with state deciles based on local government areas; decile one indicates relatively the greatest
disadvantage and least advantage.

Statistical methods

Descriptive analysis of admissions linked to a suicide within one year was carried out using
means, medians and proportions. The main measure used to assess the ‘risk’ of mortality
within one year of hospital discharge in the study population was the Standardised Mortality
Ratio (SMR). The SMRs compare the observed suicide mortality in the study population in
each diagnosis group with the expected suicide mortality in the general population. Suicide
mortality rates for the general population was computed using suicide data from the VSR and
population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics [24]. SMRs were calculated using the
indirect method adjusting for age (5-year groups) and gender [25].

Survival analysis was carried out on conditions with high SMRs (SMR>5) to assess for
competing risks due to non-suicidal deaths. Survival analysis was limited to index POCs.
Those alive at one year were censored. Analysis was carried out with and without accounting
for competing risks (i.e., death due to causes other than suicide) using the cumulative inci-
dence function method as defined by Fine and Gray [26] and the Cox proportional hazards
model, respectively. The independent variables age group, gender, marital status, geographic
region and SEIFA were assessed for association with the outcome of suicide using a stepwise
forward regression; all except SEIFA were significant to the outcome (assessed using the
Akaike Information Criterion [27]). All tests were carried out at the 5% level of significance.
SAS software, Version 9.4 [28] and Stata 16.0 (StataCorp) [29] was used to analyse the data.
The study was approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee
(Project no: 14647). Historical administrative data was used. Name, date of birth and other
identifiers were removed from the dataset by the data custodians prior to release of the data to
the researchers. Due to the magnitude of the dataset, it was impractical to obtain consent.

Results
Overview of study population

A total of 1,737,743 patients with 2,430,154 hospital admissions during the study period 2011
to 2016 were selected for analysis; more than half of patients were aged 25–64 years (56.6%),

and 60% were female. Seventy-one conditions related to injury, mental and physical illness
were identified at the three-digit level of the ICD-10-AM from these hospital admission
records.

Conditions associated with at least five suicides

Forty-three of the 71 conditions were linked to at least five suicides in the 1-year follow-up
period: these consisted of 14 physical illnesses, 5 symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and
laboratory findings, 12 mental health conditions, and 12 types of injury and poisonings. Select-
ing only hospital admissions with one of these 43 conditions appearing in the principal diag-
nosis field resulted in a sub-set of 756,007 admissions (by 538,910 patients) (Table 1). The
most common mental health conditions were disorders due to the use of alcohol, and schizo-
phrenia. The most common physical conditions were pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction
and cellulitis. Among symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, pain in
throat and chest, and abdominal and pelvic pain were the most common conditions. Among
injury and poisonings, injuries to the head, and wrist and hand were most common.

Suicides

Over the five-year study period, 756,007 hospital admissions related to the selected 43 condi-
tions (conditions with at least five suicides) were associated with a total of 631 suicides within
one year of hospital discharge (Table 2). The mean and median ages of those who died by sui-
cide following hospital admission for the selected 43 conditions were approximately 44 and 43
years respectively, and males accounted for 67.2%.

Schizophrenia, depressive episodes, reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders,
throat and chest pains, nonopioid poisonings, poisoning by antiepileptic, sedative-hypnotic
and antiparkinsonism drugs and poisoning by psychotropic drugs were some of the conditions
associated with the highest numbers of suicides (>30) during the follow-up period.

SMRs were calculated for each of the 43 conditions: poisonings had the highest SMRs rang-
ing from 27.8 (CI 14.1–49.5) for poisoning by narcotics and psychodysleptics to 140 (CI 61.2–
276.9) for carbon monoxide poisoning; 81% of these were intentional-self-harm incidents.
SMRs related to mental and behavioural disorders followed, ranging from 15.5 (CI 10.4–22.3)
for mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol to 72.9 (CI 58.7–89.6) for depressive
episodes (Fig 1). Admissions with a diagnosis code indicating depressive episodes, that also
had external cause codes indicating intentional self-harm, had double the SMR (SMR = 150.0
(95% CI 38.2–408.2)) compared to admissions with depressive episodes overall (SMR = 72.9
(95% CI 58.7–89.6)) (not shown in tables). Of the physical illnesses, gastritis had the highest
SMR of 4.9 (CI 2.2–9.8). Among Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory find-
ings, admissions related to Symptoms and signs involving emotional state had a high SMR of
43.2 (CI 25.6–68.7) with 50% of these coded to suicidal ideation.

Intentional self-harm

Out of the 43 selected conditions (conditions with > = 5 suicides), external cause codes were
particularly relevant to poisoning-related admissions, which were mostly coded as caused by
intentional self-harm, and intracranial injuries, which were mostly coded as caused by assaults
(not shown in tables). Since intentional self-harm is known to be associated with suicide, self-
harm related admissions were selected and further analysed. One-hundred and sixty-seven sui-
cides were associated with intentional self-harm related admissions in the year prior to suicide
(Table 3). It is important to note that there is an overlap with the numbers presented in Tables
2 and 3; i.e., of the 167 suicides presented in Table 3, the majority (n = 127) are also included

in Table 2. The mean and median age of those who died by suicide following self-harm related
hospital admission was approximately 41 years, and 41.3% of those who died were female.

Death by other causes

Death due to other causes pose a competing risk for suicide. To ascertain the impact of com-
peting risks, survival analysis was carried out for 23 conditions (those with an SMR > = 5).
The baseline variables considered to have an association with increased hazard of suicide
death were age-group, gender, marital status and geographic region. Due to the small number
of suicides associated with most conditions, statistically reliable conclusions could not be
drawn for most of them. Proportions of death by other causes, and details of the survival analy-
sis is provided in the Table A and B in S1 File. Overall, adjusting for competing risks had no
significant impact on the estimated likelihood of suicide for any of the conditions.

Statistical model outputs can be found in the S2 File.

Discussion

This study aimed to assess the risk of suicide following hospital admission for mental health
conditions, physical illnesses, injury and poisoning and specifically for intentional self-harm.
Standardised Mortality Ratios were used to assess the risk of suicide for each health condition
following hospital-discharge relative to the age- and sex-matched suicide risk in the general
population. Poisonings (including those resulting from intentional self-harm) had some of the
highest SMRs, followed by mental health conditions. These were followed by symptoms and
signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings involving cognitive functions and emo-
tional states, while the lowest SMRs were for physical illnesses. Age, gender, marital status and
geographic region of residence were confounders that were associated with selected conditions
as well as the outcome of suicide.

The risk of suicide varied with the type of condition. Separation from hospital for treatment

of a mental health condition was associated with a greater risk of suicide (high SMR) within

the 1-year follow-up period than for a physical illness. This was expected given previous
research has found many mental health conditions to be associated with suicide [30–32]. Simi-
larly, injury and poisoning related hospital admissions also showed a greater risk of suicide in
the 1-year follow-up period after discharge when compared to physical illnesses. Again, this is
expected given that many of the injury and poisoning admissions were a result of intentional
self-harm and there is a known link between suicide attempts and subsequent suicide [12–14].
This study found little, and in some instances no, increased risk of suicide for most of the
selected physical illnesses; a similar finding was reported by Roberts, John, Kandalama, Wil-
liams, Lyons and Lloyd in a study of similar design [9] in the United Kingdom. Therefore, hos-
pital admission for certain mental health conditions and injuries (in particular poisonings) are
still priority groups for interventions; these could be focussed on high-risk groups identified at
hospital discharge.

Mental health conditions are a known risk factor for suicide. Certain mental health condi-

tions found to have high SMRs in this study were similar to those found to increase suicide
risk in a recent meta-review [30]; these were substance use and schizophrenia, depressive epi-
sodes, personality disorders, and bipolar disorders. Further two other studies also found high
relative risks for conditions such as depressive disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders,
personality disorders, substance use disorders, and anxiety disorders [31, 32]. In the current
study, suicidal ideation was also found as a secondary diagnosis among many of the admissions
with a principal diagnosis of a mental health condition. Suicidal ideation and tendencies

as Symptoms and signs involving emotional state, which could explain why symptoms and
signs involving emotional state showed high SMRs in this study.

Certain types of injuries, including poisonings, are known to be risk factors for suicide. Cer-
tain poisonings observed in this study had high SMRs, indicating a high risk of subsequent sui-
cide associated with discharge from hospital following a poisoning-related admission. This is
expected as 81% of these poisoning cases resulted from intentional self-harm rather than unin-
tentional incidents. Admissions for poisonings from benzodiazepines, analgesics and antipy-
retics such as 4-aminopheno derivatives (which commonly include paracetamol),
antidepressants and antipsychotics were common among those who died by suicide within 1
year. This study confirms that hospital-admitted poisonings can be linked to subsequent sui-
cide, and provides details regarding the types of poisonings that are associated with suicide,
using Victorian hospital admissions data. The current study found carbon monoxide poison-
ing to have a high SMR. The Victorian government’s assertive outreach trials (HOPE program)
target people treated in hospital for suicide attempts. People who have engaged in a suicide
attempt using a method that was shown to have particularly high suicide risk in this study, for
example carbon monoxide poisoning should be strongly encouraged to participate in these
HOPE trials; people who present after carbon monoxide poisoning should be a priority for
prevention. This has also been shown in a previous study by Hampson, Rudd and Hauff [33].
Among injuries other than poisonings, those with high SMRs were intracranial injuries
(mostly concussive injury), other head injuries and open wounds of forearm. Open wounds of
the forearm are likely indicative of intentional self- harm from cutting, which is a known risk
factor for subsequent suicide [34]. This once again provides further support for known links
between self-harm and suicide.

Certain physical illnesses are known to be associated with suicide. The physical illnesses with an
SMR > 3 in this study were gastritis (some of which were alcohol related), constipation, and type 2
diabetes mellitus (SMR just under 3); the same three illnesses were found to have the highest SMRs
in a study of similar design conducted by Roberts, John, Kandalama, Williams, Lyons and Lloyd [9]
in the United Kingdom. Roberts, John, Kandalama, Williams, Lyons and Lloyd discussed that gas-
trointestinal diseases were often alcohol related (also seen in the current study) and constipation
could be a side-effect of certain medications (e.g., opioids; constipation is also a known adverse effect
for some pharmaceuticals to treat epilepsy, anaemia, pain, depression and other mental disorders).
They noted that suicide risks were also linked to therapeutic medications such as those used for epi-
lepsy and Parkinson’s disease (also seen in the current study). They noted that endocrine disorders
that relate to poor blood glucose control (i.e. potentially indicative of poor chronic disease manage-
ment) were also linked with suicide risk (also seen in the current study).

Strengths

This study was drawn from state-wide population-level databases, providing reliable estimates of sui-
cide risk following discharge from hospital for a range of physical and mental conditions. Data link-
age provided appropriate follow-up. It also provided estimates intrinsic to Victoria, where the
physical conditions identified as potential predictors of subsequent suicides were slightly different to
what was seen elsewhere in the world (e.g., England and Wales [9]). Locally relevant data is key to
informing locally applicable interventions. The competing risk modelling carried out in this study
has demonstrated that death due to other causes is not a significant competing risk for suicide.

Limitations

The SMRs computed in this study are limited to incidents serious enough to warrant hospital
admission and do not include incidents that did not result in hospital admission.

PLOS ONESuicide post hospital admission for mental & physical health conditions, injury and ISH in Victoria

Sample size was also a study limitation: larger samples lead to more comprehensive lists of

conditions (48 conditions), as shown by Roberts, John, Kandalama, Williams, Lyons and
Lloyd [9]. Comparatively, the current study consisted of a much smaller sample of admissions;
however, 43 conditions were captured.

Selection of a condition is based on the fact that it was associated with at least five suicides.

This could occur due to two reasons. The first is that the condition may be common (e.g.,
throat and chest pain); common conditions are therefore selected not because of a dispropor-
tionate risk of suicide, but because the overall case numbers are high, and eventually five sui-
cides are likely to be observed. The second is that the condition can be associated with
increased suicide risk. These underlying reasons for inclusion of conditions should be consid-
ered when drawing conclusions from this study.

The current study limited the selection of cases to those with an unplanned admission. This
may result in loss of information on conditions that require ongoing hospital monitoring (e.g.,
kidney patients on dialysis). Furthermore, suicide risk among those with unplanned admis-
sions may be different to suicide risk among those with planned admissions. Suicide risk
among planned admissions is beyond the scope of this study. Future work in this area can
expand the study scope and also include specific illnesses and treatments that fall within this
category and retaining planned admissions.

Modelling techniques require a certain number of cases with the outcome (i.e., suicide, in

this study) in order to produce reliable estimates of association between exposure variables
and outcomes. Suicide is a rare event. In this study, for many of the physical or mental health
conditions, there were insufficient numbers of cases with a suicide outcome to provide reliable
estimates for the survival analysis that was performed. In interpreting the results, it should be
noted that the absence of a statistically significant result does not necessarily demonstrate the
absence of a correlation: for some conditions, case numbers were insufficient for statistical
testing. Replicating this study in a larger population (e.g. a national study) would help to
address this study limitation.

Conclusions

Specified mental health conditions and types of injury and poisonings can be prioritised for
targeting suicide prevention initiatives for persons discharged from hospitals: hospitals can
therefore serve as a service contact point as well as a suicide risk identification platform.
Among mental health conditions, priority can be given to depressive episodes, followed by
personality disorders and psychotic episodes. Among poisonings, priority can be given to poi-
soning by antiepileptic, sedative-hypnotic and antiparkinsonism drugs, poisoning by nono-
pioid analgesics, antipyretics and antirheumatics, poisoning by unclassified psychotropic
drugs, carbon monoxide poisoning and poisoning by hormone pharmaceuticals such as insu-
lin. Intentional self-harm is an injury type that can also be prioritised. Staff working in clinical
mental health services and emergency departments, could be advised of the findings relating
to high suicide risk associated with particular methods or conditions, to assist with targeted
suicide prevention.
