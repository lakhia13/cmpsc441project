Editorial on the Research Topic

Disaster-related psychiatric disorders: assessment, recovery, intervention

Studies of the 9/11 attack in the US have led to new critical understanding and insights
into disaster psychiatry, highlighting screening, trauma responses, long-term mental health
impacts, and intervention strategies. Related research have paved the way to increased
public awareness of Post-Traumatic Distress Disorder (PTSD) and their impact on
survivors, ﬁrst responders, and families (1). There have also been renewed focus on early
intervention efforts, and mindfulness that PTSD often exacerbate previous vulnerabilities
and typically coexists with other mental illness such as depression, anxiety, and substance
use disorders (2), calling for integrated treatment approaches (3). It has also pointed to
long-term effects of PTSD, affecting some survivors with persistent mental health
challenges, and how symptoms sometimes worsen over time (4). The ﬁeld has learned to
shift towards more community-based interventions, resilience training, and development
of more mental health programs tailored to trauma care (5).

In this Research Topic: Disaster-Related Psychiatric Disorders: Assessment, Recovery,
Intervention, researchers have continued to expand our knowledge in disaster and trauma
related effects, studying numerous man-made and natural disasters, with Covid-19 being a
global threat as another important backdrop. While the current understanding is that
disasters and their impacts are highly heterogeneous (6), these studies contribute nuanced
new knowledge that are informative to the ﬁeld at large.

In Lee et al. studies of bereaved families from a fairy disaster in Korea, they showed
long-term prevalence of PTSD symptoms in family members who lost loved ones, and
highlighted how psychological state of optimism are protective against PTSD, but being
avoidant and isolative worsened such. The presence of these factors likely reﬂect both
personal and cultural attributes, providing potential area of foci in treatment and support.
Addressing another disaster, studies by Berthail et al. on the Paris attack in 2015 drew
newer attention to the fact that physical reactions to the traumatic event and tendency to
engage in intrusive thoughts suppression are associated with elevated development of
PTSD. These ﬁndings call for attention to both psychological and biological underpinnings

for PTSD, and could contribute to early screening success for those
who will be vulnerable in developing PTSD. To focus on protective
factors, First’s study focused on disaster resilience, conceptualized
as how various internal and external factors interact to inﬂuence an
individual’s ability to adapt and recover following exposure to a
disaster. The knowledge that such factors related to resilience can
modify development of PTSD and depression give rise to areas of
interest for both population and clinical levels of intervention. The
study also found that more exposure to disaster losses was
associated with more resilience, so exposure to disaster is related
to development of resilience itself, as intuitive as it may sound;
however, there is some critical doses of such loss that can
overwhelm an individual’s resilience when the exposure levels are
cumulative and ongoing (7), with an implication that timely and
targeted support is critical in fostering resilience. Moving the ﬁeld
more upstream and using a preventative framework, Rizzi et al.
have studied earthquake survivors in Morocco, particularly in a
highly vulnerable population of pediatric cancer patients and
caregivers, and advocated a focus on the communication,
education, and having well deﬁned disaster preparedness plans as
a way to increase population health and resilience.

In a parallel world to the local and single event disasters, the
Covid pandemic with its protracted and global impact at social,
economical, and population health levels has trained a spotlight on
the importance of disaster preparation and management. Out of
this global disaster, a number of authors have contributed work to
further our understanding on the manifested impact the pandemic
has had. Yuan et al. have reported how the pandemic disaster could
exacerbate a previously vulnerable and disadvantaged population
living with HIV in a large Chinese sample of participants. Medved
et al. remarked on increase in substance use and addictive behaviors
in those with severe mental illness, occurring during the pandemic
and compounded by the disaster of an earthquake in Croatia. The
double-disaster predicted the acute need for special attention for
those who are already vulnerable. Combined, these authors point to
an importance of a more progressive, selective approach in
protecting the most vulnerable during challenging times (8).

In other fronts, Teckchandani et al. examined those who were
not known yet to be vulnerable, but found those with higher
potential to have mental health concerns tend to be less likely to
engage in some forms of proactive mental health training in a police
cadet population that is known to face higher incidences of mental
health challenge, including PTSD as part of their professional
hazard. Their study is noteworthy for how to identify and engage
in an upstream approach for health promotion and illness
prevention. Another vulnerable group, by choice or by external
factors is people with a history of migration. Renner et al. reviewed
the relationship between migratory grief –deﬁned as related to
interpersonal, material and abstract losses - and psychopathology.

Not surprisingly, migratory grief predicted depression and
psychological distress, but their public health and social policy
implications are ever more relevant in today’s global political
climate regarding immigration and resettlement issues. Lastly,
taking on actual studies of refugee youth, Schumacher et al.
examined PTSD and beyond in refugee minors in Germany, and
found a large proportion over (40%) of the participants met
diagnostic criteria for depression and many of whom showed
comorbid PTSD diagnosis. They stressed the importance of
recognizing latent depressive symptoms that develop from the
original PTSD symptoms associated with the ﬂight and stress as
part of the refugee experience for many.

In summary, the Research Topic in disaster related psychiatric
disorders expanded knowledge in assessment, understanding, and
paved new paths towards more effective and tailored intervention,
with aim to promote fuller recovery, particularly mindful of those
who are already or known to be vulnerable. Studying these
populations from the margins could ultimately help us to
understand more on how to address disaster related mental
health challenges for the general population at large.
