Abstract

Bipolar disorder (BD) poses a significant public health concern, with roughly one-

quarter of sufferers attempting suicide. BD is characterized by manic and depres-

sive mood cycles, the recurrence of which can be effectively curtailed through lithium

therapy. Unfortunately, the most frequently employed lithium salt, lithium carbon-

ate (Li2CO3), is associated with a host of adverse health outcomes following chronic
use: these unwanted effects range from relatively minor inconveniences (e.g., polydip-

sia and polyuria) to potentially major complications (e.g., hypothyroidism and/or renal

impairment). As these undesirable effects can limit patient compliance, an alternative

lithium compound with a lesser toxicity profile would dramatically improve treatment

efficacy and outcomes. Lithium orotate (LiC5H3N2O4; henceforth referred to as LiOr),
a compound largely abandoned since the late 1970s, may represent such an alterna-

tive. LiOr is proposed to cross the blood–brain barrier and enter cells more readily than

Li2CO3, which will theoretically allow for reduced dosage requirements and amelio-
rated toxicity concerns. This review addresses the controversial history of LiOr, com-

plete with discussions of experimental and clinical efficacy, putative mechanisms of

action, adverse effects, and its potential future in therapy.

Unfortunately, Li2CO3-based therapy is not without issues. First
and foremost, Li2CO3, much like other approved lithium compounds,
has a narrow therapeutic window coupled with a side-effect pro-

sive and manic/hypomanic mood cycles, with the severity of each cycle

varying according to the specific class; for example, BD I, BD II, and

cyclothymia. (Culpepper, 2014). Depressive states are characterized

by feelings of persistent sadness, anhedonia, sleep disturbance, and

file that ranges from inconvenient (e.g., nausea) to potentially life-

fatigue, whereas mania and hypomania are noted for euphoria, loss

threatening (e.g., renal dysfunction). Unsurprisingly, patient non-

tionship between GSK3β and BDNF (Fiol et al., 1994; Grimes &

Jope, 2001; Gupta et al., 2014), it is possible that lithium upreg-
ulates BDNF levels through the inhibition of GSK3β; application
of GSK3β antagonists increases transcription of the BDNF gene

(Yasuda et al., 2009).

These findings implicate dysregulation of GSK3β in BD pathogene-

sis, and appear to establish the inhibition of its activity as a likely medi-

ator of lithium’s therapeutic actions.

with Li2CO3 was seemingly forgotten, as the use of lithium in psychi-
atry would not experience a revival until 1949 courtesy of Australian

psychiatrist John Cade (Shorter, 2009).

3.4 Where does lithium orotate enter the
picture?

As previously discussed, GSK3β and IMPase are potentially at the root

of much of BD symptomatology. Given that both enzymes display intra-

cellular localization, it is possible that a lithium formulation that more

readily crosses biological membranes, or displays increased intracel-

lular residency-time, would result in greater control of BD symptoms.

LiOr has been proposed to do just that, with evidence from animal stud-

ies suggesting that not only does LiOr yield higher brain concentra-
tions of Li+ than Li2CO3, but also that the levels of Li+ progressively
build over the course of 24 h (Kling et al., 1978). If inhibition of GSK3β

and IMPase are truly the mechanisms through which lithium exerts its
therapeutic actions, then these observed elevations in brain Li+ may
enable the employment of LiOr at concentrations that are substantially

lower than those currently prescribed for Li2CO3. Furthermore, the
sustained increase in brain Li+ over 24 h may allow for a more robust
and consistent control of symptoms between doses.

AND THEIR USES

4.3

The rise of lithium carbonate

At the Bundoora Repatriation Hospital in 1949, John Cade hypothe-

sized that excess uric acid was related to mania and summarily began

treatment on 10 manic patients with lithium citrate and Li2CO3, citing
the success of Garrod in using lithium to manage gout (Shorter, 2009).

Cade noted that some of the patients responded quite well to the med-

ication, with a subset of patients becoming capable of discharge from

the hospital (Cade, 1949).

The timing of Cade’s success was unfortunately inopportune, as in

that same year, 1949, lithium chloride had failed as a replacement for

sodium chloride in the management of hypertension (Corcoran et al.,

1949). Reports of lithium poisoning were widespread due to the exces-

sive use of lithium chloride-based table salt substitutes such as Milosal

and Foodsal. After several deaths, the Food and Drug Administration

(FDA) banned the use of lithium salt substitutes.

Despite the concerns surrounding the use of lithium chloride, tri-

als involving Li2CO3 use in BD continued in Australia and Denmark
(Noack & Trautner, 1951; Schou et al., 1954). Interest in North Amer-

ica began to build in the 1960s, likely due to the advent of the Cole-

man flame photometer (Shorter, 2009; Coleman flame photometer, ),

which allowed for the accurate tracking of blood lithium levels, and the

arrival of Samuel Gershon who had previously worked with lithium at

side-effect profile

Li2CO3, which dissociates readily in solution, requires administration
of doses large enough to force elemental lithium/the lithium ion (Li+)
across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and into cells via sodium trans-

porters such as the sodium-hydrogen antiporter (NHE) (Ennis et al.,

1996; Luo et al., 2018), and/or simple diffusion. The main issues with
this treatment are two-fold: (1) the dose required results in serum Li+
concentration that may result in significant toxicity (Gitlin, 2016; Tim-

mer & Sands, 1999), which (2) contributes to patient non-adherence

on account of the unpleasant side-effect profile (Jawad et al.,

2018).

Li2CO3 is a thoroughly studied compound in the management of BD.
Dosage guidelines are well established, and both short- and long-term
toxicity concerns are well understood. Despite being the current gold
standard for the control of mania and the prevention of mood episode
recurrences, Li2CO3 is not without its share of issues, namely a
narrow therapeutic window and a potentially severe toxic effect
profile that may limit patient compliance

Pharmacokinetics of Li2CO3: A brief overview

its potential in the cessation of alcohol abuse (Olbrich et al., 1991)

Li2CO3 is highly bioavailable following oral administration, with an esti-
mated 80–100% of the ingested dose absorbed through the upper

intestinal tract (Ward et al., 1994). Li2CO3 displays a relatively low
volume of distribution (Mason et al., 1978), and its cellular influx and

efflux appears to be driven by a combination of sodium-dependent pas-

sive and active transport mechanisms; in general, as sodium goes, so

and safety of lithium aspartate relative to Li2CO3.

difference relative to Li2CO3 (Guelen et al., 1992; Shelley & Silver-
stone, 1986), to significant reductions in peak serum lithium levels

(Tyrer et al., 1982). No major differences in side-effect profile have

been noted (Sachs et al., 2000; Shelley & Silverstone, 1986). While

currently—though infrequently—employed in the treatment of BD

(largely in patients who have trouble swallowing caplets), lithium cit-

rate does not appear to offer any additional benefit over Li2CO3.

6.3

Lithium chloride

Research into the use of lithium oxybutyrate in BD is very limited,

though a study by Liubimov et al. in 1980 demonstrated antimanic

potential. In addition, the group noted that lithium oxybutyrate may

potentially be more effective and less toxic than Li2CO3 (Liubimov
et al., 1980). Others have found an antiarrhythmic effect in lithium

oxybutyrate, which may suggest beneficial effects of the medication

beyond just the control of BD symptoms (Petrova et al., 1987). The

pharmacokinetics of lithium oxybutyrate relative to Li2CO3 has not
been explored. Considering the promise displayed and the overall lack

of investigation into its efficacy, further exploration into lithium oxybu-

tyrate is warranted.

While approved for use in BD, lithium chloride is used rarely, if ever,

relative to Li2CO3. Lithium chloride sees much of its use occur in ani-
mal studies, largely due to ease of dosing via intraperitoneal injec-

In 2014, a study conducted by Smith et al. explored the pharmacokinet-

istered orally in rats, both lithium chloride and Li2CO3 displayed
similar absorption and elimination patterns, with Li2CO3 resulting in
generally higher plasma lithium levels at each tested concentration

(Morrison et al., 2016). Given the minor differences in pharmacoki-

netics between the two compounds, as well as the limited shelf life of

lithium chloride, owing to its hygroscopicity, there does not seem to be

any reason to consider lithium chloride for use over traditional Li2CO3
preparations.

6.4

Lithium aspartate

Lithium aspartate, the salt of aspartic acid and lithium, is not approved

by the FDA for use in the treatment of BD. At present, literature explor-

ing its efficacy and/or safety is sparse. Select studies have investigated

ics of lithium salicylate and lithium lactate. They noted that both the

lactate and salicylate formulations displayed reduced bioavailability

relative to Li2CO3. However, despite lesser bioavailability, the authors
proposed that lithium salicylate may represent a safer alternative to

Li2CO3 on account of its more stable absorption and excretion pat-
tern characterized by lower peak Li+ levels with an elongated plateau
for serum concentration (Smith et al., 2014). It has previously been
suggested that lithium compounds with less severe Li+ concentration
spikes and smoother blood level curves could reduce the toxicity of

lithium therapeutics (Lippmann & Evans, 1983). In fact, this is one of

the arguments supporting a) the use of sustained-release Li2CO3 for-
mulations, as well as b) the administration of multiple daily doses (less

Li2CO3 ingested per dose) in place of bulk dosing (Chokhawala et al.,
2020; Couffignal et al., 2021).

important findings: (1) LiOr yielded significantly greater concen-
trations of the lithium ion (Li+) in the brain than was observed for
equivalent doses of Li2CO3 (Kling et al., 1978), and (2) LiOr impaired
renal function to a greater extent than Li2CO3 when employed at
concentrations of 2 mmol Li+/kg body weight. The adverse effects
on the kidneys reported by Smith et al. (1978) effectively closed

the gates on future inquiries into the use of LiOr. While the caution

advised is understandable, further research into the effects of LiOr
on both kidney function and serum/brain Li+ levels must be con-
ducted across a range of concentrations before LiOr can be ruled

out for use in psychiatric applications; after all, the doses employed

transition states (Evans & Guy, 2004; Lieberman et al., 1955).

It has also been suggested that orotic acid may exert effects beyond

just the promotion of DNA/RNA synthesis through the actions of its

downstream metabolites. For example, some have noted that orotic
acid could increase β-alanine pools as a consequence of upregulated

uridine synthesis and subsequent metabolism (Aonuma et al., 1969;
McCarty & DiNicolantonio, 2014). β-alanine is a rate-limiting pre-

cursor in the synthesis of carnosine (Boldyrev et al., 2013) which is a

known antioxidant agent (Kohen et al., 1988,1991; Pavlov et al., 1993).

Thus, endogenous and dietary orotic acids may confer cytoprotection
via downstream increases in the antioxidants β-alanine and carnosine

by both Kling and Smith were quite high (Kling et al., 1978; Smith

(McCarty & DiNicolantonio, 2014). Furthermore, uridine itself serves

& Schou, 1979).

Given the assertion that LiOr results in greater serum concentra-
tions of Li+ than Li2CO3, it is entirely possible that LiOr could result
in therapeutically relevant concentrations of Li+ at markedly reduced
concentrations relative to what are typically employed during Li2CO3
therapy. Such reduced dosage requirements may alleviate the delete-

glycosylation reactions, and contributes to neuronal and glial commu-

While the existing literature suggests that orotate salts present an

efficacious means by which to deliver minerals, modern research is

lacking. Studies on both the potential efficacy of orotic acid as a min-

eral carrier and its mechanisms of action in accomplishing said goal of

mineral delivery are needed.

Early interest in orotic acid as a carrier for

7.3
lithium (lithium orotate)

LiOr is the salt of orotic acid and lithium. As discussed previously,

LiOr and various other orotate complexes—such as, calcium diorotate

(Nieper, 1970)—were presented in the early 1970s as a superior means

of mineral delivery by Hans Nieper (Nieper, 1970, 1973). He proposed

that orotates cross biological membranes and enter cells more read-

ily than traditionally employed salt formulations. Despite early success

marked by clinical efficacy (Nieper, 1973) in humans, and an increase in

brain lithium levels relative to Li2CO3 demonstrated in animal studies
(Kling et al., 1978), research into LiOr was effectively curtailed follow-

ing concerns regarding potential renal toxicity in 1979 (Smith & Schou,

1979).

Interestingly, LiOr is once again attracting attention (Dell’Osso et al.,

2016; Devadason, 2018; Lakhan & Vieira, 2008) for its putative abil-
ity to yield higher serum and brain Li+ concentrations than observed
from equivalent doses of Li2CO3 (Kling et al., 1978). A recent edi-
torial penned by Peter Devadason (2018) effectively highlights the

growing interest in LiOr as a medication delivered in trace and/or

supplemental dosages. The author notes the deleterious impacts of

inadequate lithium intake, the reported benefits of LiOr administra-

tion, and the general lack of safety concerns associated with low-dose

LiOr supplementation (Devadason, 2018). Given the known issues

associated with Li2CO3 use, perhaps it is time to explore LiOr in greater
detail.

Can lithium orotate enter the CNS more

readily than lithium carbonate?

7.4.1
biological membranes

Potential for enhanced passage across

Proponents of LiOr argue that orotates do not dissociate at phys-

iological pH and thus exist in sera as electrically neutral com-

pounds (Figure 3a). This is perhaps best evidenced by magne-

sium orotate dihydrate, which is poorly soluble in water and is

known to not bind gastric acid. Further, in contrast to the more

easily dissociable magnesium salts, magnesium orotate dihydrate

does not exhibit a laxative effect following oral administration

(Classen, 2004).

A neutral, non-dissociated LiOr complex could potentially cross the
BBB and cell membranes with greater efficiency than the Li+ and car-
bonate ions of Li2CO3 (Nieper, 1973; Sartori, 1986), which dissociate
readily in solution. Also, as orotate is a precursor to uracil, orotates

F I G U R E 3

Proposed mechanisms underlying the efficacy of orotic

acid as a mineral carrier. (a) Mineral orotates may display limited
dissociation in biological solutions, allowing them to exist in sera as
non-dissociated, electrically neutral compounds. (b) It has been
suggested that LiOr preferentially dissociates in the intracellular
compartment, perhaps through mechanisms involving the uptake of
orotic acid into the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. (c) Given its
structural similarity to non-charged pyrimidines, LiOr may be able to
make use of nucleotide transporters for passage across cell
membranes, as is observed for non-charged pyrimidines such as
fluorouracil

may make use of nucleotide transporters (e.g., the uracil transporter)

resident in cell membranes (Figure 3c). Non-ionized fluorouracil is a

substrate for such transporters, while charged pyrimidines are not

(Wohlhueter et al., 1980), which suggests neutral orotate complexes

may also be substrates. Finally, orotate is known to utilize the urate

transporter 1 (URAT1) for traversal across membranes in the kidney

(Miura et al., 2011), which may suggest that passage into the CNS is

possible via URAT1 located within the choroid plexus (Chiba et al.,

2020; Uemura et al., 2017).

Lithium may be liberated from the orotate carrier within the cell during

the incorporation of orotate into the synthesis pathway, allowing for
enhanced intracellular accumulation of Li+ relative to Li2CO3, which

apy by BD patients (i.e., <1000 mg or ∼10–15 mg/kg) is unlikely to

contribute to the growth of cancerous cells, as stimulation of cancer-

ous cell growth was observed at orotic acid concentrations exceeding

100 mg/kg (Laconi et al., 1993). Nevertheless, use of orotic acid formu-

lations, be it for lithium, magnesium, iron, or copper, is potentially not

advisable for individuals known to be at risk for oncogenesis.

a carbonate (Kling et al., 1978). Furthermore, when administered at
2 mmol Li+/kg as an orotate, Li+ progressively accumulated within
the brain in a manner not observed for Li2CO3; Li2CO3 maintained a

While LiOr effectively reduced relapse occurrence at the relatively low

dose of 150 mg (Sartori, 1986), Li2CO3 demonstrates only mild efficacy
at therapeutic dosages, that is, >600 mg (Fawcett et al., 1987). Further-

more, other studies have shown no effect of Li2CO3 on avoidance of
relapse (Dorus et al., 1989), leading some to conclude that Li2CO3 is
not an effective treatment for alcoholism (Lejoyeux & Ades, 1993). No

additional studies concerning the use of LiOr in the treatment of alco-

holism have been conducted outside of the work by Sartori (1986). In

sum, LiOr may reduce the occurrence of relapse in alcoholism at sub-

therapeutic doses, while Li2CO3 does not appear to be similarly effec-
tive even at markedly higher concentrations, lending credence to the

notion that LiOr may be a more efficacious formulation.
