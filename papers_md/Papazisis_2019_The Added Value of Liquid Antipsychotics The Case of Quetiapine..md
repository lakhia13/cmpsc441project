Abstract: Background: Antipsychotic drugs are the cornerstone of schizophrenia treatment and are 
also indicated  for other psychotic and mood disorders. Different  antipsychotic drugs and their for-
mulations are available, though liquid forms have been overlooked. 

Methods: Herein the added value of liquid antipsychotics is reviewed, with a focus on the recently 
introduced liquid quetiapine, a frequently used antipsychotic. 

Results: Liquid antipsychotics are  easily administrated via the preferable oral route, while compli-
ance  under  supervised  administration  is  transparent.  Liquid  forms  could  be  preferred  in  patients 
with  swallowing  difficulties,  which  are  common  in  elderly  patients  and  often  concealed.  In  this 
population,  the  availability  of  liquid  antipsychotics  could  prevent  errors  in  medication  administra-
tion,  which  could  possibly  render  caregivers  labile  to  any  harm  caused  to  the  patient.  Aspiration, 
however, remains a risk with liquid formulations. Common errors in medication administration are 
the omission of treatment and alteration of solid oral formulations. Regarding quetiapine, omission 
of  treatment  could  be  associated  with  non-adherence  as  well  as  discontinuation  symptoms,  while 
alteration  of  extended  release  formulation  could  alter  its  pharmacokinetics.  Mildly  agitated  and 
cooperative  patients  are  another  target  population  of  liquid  antipsychotics,  which  can  induce  fast 
sedation avoiding involuntary intramuscular injections. The combination of sedative properties and 
low  incidence  of  extrapyramidal  symptoms  makes  liquid  quetiapine  a  valuable  option  for  these 
patients, yet the current evidence is limited. 

Conclusion: The liquid form of quetiapine can facilitate pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia and can 
be defined as value added medicine bringing key benefits not only to the patients and caregivers but 
also to the health care system. 

Keywords: Antipsychotic, quetiapine, liquid, schizophrenia, dysphagia, agitation. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

  Antipsychotic drugs are the cornerstone of  the  treatment 
of  schizophrenia  and  other  psychotic  disorders  and  are  also 
indicated  for  bipolar  disorders  and  as  add-on  treatment  for 
major depression [1]. Successful pharmacotherapy lies in the 
proper  selection  of  antipsychotic  drugs  and  adherence  to 
treatment.  Currently  available  antipsychotics  have  distinct 
pharmacological  properties.  Selection  of  antipsychotic 
treatment  is based on several factors, such as prior response 
or side effects, efficacy and safety profile of the drug, patient 
characteristics,  as  well  as  patient’s  preference  and  route  of 
administration.  Non-response  or  incident  side  effects  could 
lead to a change of antipsychotic drugs; switching from one 
atypical antipsychotic to another is reported in about 30-50% 
of outpatients a year [2]. 

  Compliance  with  treatment  should  be  assessed  before 
evaluating  the  poor  efficacy  of  antipsychotics.  Compliance

macology, School of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thes-

(or adherence) is very challenging in chronic  illness and es-
pecially  in  psychotic  disorders.  Non-compliance  rates  of 
antipsychotics  vary  between  studies,  with  mean  rates  being 
about 40-50% of patients with schizophrenia, but they can be 
even  higher.  Consequences  of  non-compliance  are  relapse 
and  persistent  symptoms,  as  well  as  re-hospitalization  and 
increased cost of treatment. Patients’ preference and attitudes 
towards specific antipsychotic drugs must be taken into con-
sideration when selecting an  antipsychotic because  they can 
facilitate compliance with treatment [3]. 

  Different  formulations  of  antipsychotics  have  been  de-
veloped  to  improve  clinical  outcome  and  treatment  compli-
ance.  Oral  formulations  are  considered  first-line  treatment 
for  schizophrenia.  Short-acting  intramuscular  injections  are 
useful in non-cooperative and agitated patients, whereas de-
pot  formulations  of  antipsychotics  are  suggested  when  poor 
compliance  with  oral  medication  is  evident  during  mainte-
nance  treatment  [4].  Rapidly  dissolving  tablets  and  liquid 
antipsychotics are easily administrated via the preferable oral 
route,  and their  compliance under supervised  administration 
is transparent [5]. However, liquid antipsychotics have been 
overlooked and a small number of antipsychotics is available 
in  liquid  form  [6]  (Table  1).  The  most  recently  introduced

form is liquid quetiapine, which could be an important addi-
tion to the list of liquid antipsychotic drugs. Liquid antipsy-
chotics  could  have  unique  place  in  pharmacotherapy,  espe-
cially in patients with agitation and questioning adherence as 
well as with swallowing difficulties [7]. 

  A  further  issue  raised  in  the  context  of  the  current  cost-
constrained environment is the increasing demand for robust 
evidence  to  demonstrate  the  additional  benefit  of  a  new 
medicine  versus  the  therapeutic  strategy.  Medicines,  based 
on  known  molecules,  that  address  healthcare  needs  and  de-
liver  relevant  improvements  for  patients,  healthcare  profes-
sionals and/or payers  are defined as value added  medicines. 
Benefits  include  improved  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability 
profile, better adherence, better quality of life, better conven-
ience of use and/or patient preference’ [8]. Herein, the phar-
macological profile and the clinical utility of the liquid form 
of  antipsychotics  will  be  reviewed  focusing  on  the  added 
value of the recently introduced liquid quetiapine.

are presented in parallel (Fig. 1), since norquetiapine is sug-
gested to  mediate some of  the  clinical effects of quetiapine, 
especially  the  antidepressive  and  anxiolytic  properties  [9]. 
Quetiapine  displays  moderate  affinities  to  serotonin  5-HT2A 
and  dopamine  D2  receptors,  as  well  as  stronger  affinities  to 
histamine  H1.  Norquetiapine  is  structurally  similar  to  tri-
cyclic  antidepressants  and  it  is  a  potent  norepinephrine 
transporter (NET) inhibitor and 5-HT1A partial agonist [9]. In 
addition, antagonism on muscarinic and adrenergic receptors 
could  contribute  to  some  of  the  therapeutic  or  side  effects. 
Both immediate release (IR) and extended release (XR) for-
mulations  are  available  for  quetiapine  [10,  11].  Quetiapine 
IR displays a faster onset but shorter duration of action than 
quetiapine XR. 

  Quetiapine is  approved by both Food and Drug Admini-
stration (FDA) and European  Medicines Agency (EMA) for 
the  treatment  of  schizophrenia,  bipolar  disorder  and  as  an 
augmentation  treatment  for  major  depressive  disorder  [10, 
11]. Quetiapine is not indicated for the patients under the age 
of 18 years old by EMA. Though, quetiapine is approved by 
FDA  for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  patients  from  13 
years old and bipolar mania from 10 years old [12]. Quetiapine 
is generally safe with common adverse event reactions being 
sedation,  postural  hypotension,  metabolic  disturbances  (in-
cluding  weight  gain,  hyperglycemia,  increased  total  choles-
terol  and  triglycerides),  and  antimuscarinic  side  effects  (in-
cluding dry mouth and constipation). Other adverse reactions 
such  as  extrapyramidal  symptoms,  increased  prolactin  and 
sexual dysfunction are presented less frequently in compari-
son to other antipsychotics [13]. 

  Quetiapine is  an atypical  antipsychotic drug with unique 
pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic  properties.  The 
pharmacodynamic  profiles  of  quetiapine  and  norquetiapine 

  Despite  these  indications,  quetiapine  is  also  extensively 
off-label  used  for  insomnia,  generalized  anxiety  disorder, 
obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  psychosis  associated  with

Table 2.  Posology of liquid quetiapine. A titration phase is required during the first four days of treatment. Usual effective dose for 
schizophrenia and for  moderate  to severe manic episodes is 400-800mg (20-40ml) and for depressive episodes  in bipolar 
disorder is up to 300mg (15 ml). For depressive episodes of bipolar disorder in individual patients could benefit by 600mg 
(30ml) or require a minimum dose of 200mg (10ml) due to poor tolerability [15].

Parkinson’s  disease,  delirium,  substance  use  disorders,  per-

sive  disorder.  Quetiapine  has  also  been  used  in  dementia-
related  psychiatric  manifestations,  though  antipsychotics 
have received a black box warning of increased mortality in 
dementia. The efficacy and safety of quetiapine for the above 
disorders are yet to be determined [14]. 

  Besides IR and XR tablets, liquid quetiapine has recently 
been  developed  in  the  form  of  oral  suspension.  Quetiapine 
oral suspension has  the  indications  and pharmacokinetics of 
quetiapine IR tablets. Each 1ml of the  liquid contains 20mg 
of quetiapine fumarate,  and different doses can be achieved 
depending on the indication (Table 2) [15]. 

3.  THE  ADDED  VALUE  OF  LIQUID  ANTI- 
PSYCHOTICS:  CLINICAL  UTILITY  IN  SPECIAL 
CONDITIONS AND SUBPOPULATIONS 

3.1. Prevalence and Identification of Swallowing Difficul-
ties: The Need for Proper Management 

  Age-related physiological changes and comorbidities can 
reduce swallowing capabilities in the elderly patients, as well 
as  several  diseases  and  drugs  that  could  impair  any  of  the 
synchronized  neural  and  muscular  mechanisms  (Table  2). 
According  to  the National  Health Service (NHS),  the medi-
cal  term  for  swallowing  difficulties  is  dysphagia,  thus  the 
terms can be used interchangeably [16]. Swallowing difficul-
ties  are  suggested  to  be  overlooked,  yet  with  important 
health consequences. They  are present in  about one-third of 
patients during lifetime, and  they could be  more frequent in 
the  elderly  or  certain  settings.  As  a  result,  they  range  be-
tween 10-35% in patients older than 65 years old  and up to 
70%  in  nursing  homes  [17,  18].  Selective  discomfort  on 
swallowing pills seems to be more frequent to general swal-
lowing problems. Tablets and capsules are intrinsically diffi-
cult  to swallow due  to the small size, bad taste and rigidity, 
which  could  induce  discomfort  and  psychological  aversion. 
A  large  number  of  patients  experience  discomfort  swallow-
ing tablets or capsules, while swallowing liquid or food com-
fortably, with a prevalence ranging among studies from 25 to 
50% of patients [19]. 

Swallowing difficulties may raise an additional barrier to 
compliance  with  treatment,  but  relevant  studies  are  lacking 
in  patients  on  antipsychotic  treatment.  Pill  characteristics

such  as  big  size,  sticky  tablets  and  bad  taste  seem  to  be 
common causes of swallowing discomfort and they may de-
motivate patients to comply with treatment [18]. A consider-
able  number  of  patients  with  discomfort  when  swallowing 
pills  are  non-adherent  to  treatment,  with  about  4%  of  them 
ceasing  the  treatment  and  10-14%  delaying  or  missing  the 
doses  [19].  However,  the  rates  of  non-adherence  may  be 
higher due to swallowing discomfort. A prospective study in 
community  pharmacies  suggested  that  23%  of  patients  with 
swallowing  difficulties  reported  intentional  omission  of 
treatment as  a  coping mechanism [18]. Another preliminary 
survey in community pharmacies reported that about 70% of 
the  responders  omitted  medication  due  to  swallowing  dis-
comfort [20]. 

  The high prevalence of swallowing difficulties, the asso-
ciated economic and health burden, as well as the increasing 
number  of  elderly  populations,  raise  alertness  for  proper 
management  of  medication  administration  to  these  patients. 
A  simple  question  about  the  presence  of  potential  swallow-
ing  difficulties  might  be  a  good  initial  step.  Observation  of 
the  patients  during  swallowing  of  food,  liquid  and/or  pills 
would  easily  and  reliably  identify  patients  with  swallowing 
difficulties.  Further  diagnostic  investigation  and  etiological 
treatment would be the best option, yet it is limited only for 
certain pathological conditions [17]. 

3.2.  Dysphagia  in  Schizophrenia  and  Antipsychotic-
induced Dysphagia 

  Dysphagia  is  common  in  schizophrenia  which  affects 
about 23% inpatients, yet it is still poorly studied. Behavioral 
symptoms related to illness seem to contribute to swallowing 
difficulties, but antipsychotic drugs per se may impair swal-
lowing  [21].  First,  drug-induced  dysphagia  should  be  ex-
cluded, since discontinuing the causative drug could improve 
swallowing.  A  recent  systematic  review  found  that  both 
typical  and  atypical  antipsychotics  could  be  associated  with 
oropharyngeal dysphagia, yet the current level of evidence is 
low  and  several  confounding  factors  can  infiltrate  the  asso-
ciation. The association with individual antipsychotics is not 
consistent,  but  haloperidol  and  risperidone  were  the  most 
frequently typical and atypical antipsychotic associated with 
dysphagia respectively [22]. 

  Antipsychotic-related  dysphagia  has  been  related  to  ex-
trapyramidal  symptoms  (EPS)  and  to  a  lesser  degree,  with 

 
 
104    Current Clinical Pharmacology, 2019, Vol. 14, No. 2 

Papazisis and Siafis 

disrupted  salivary  function  and  sedation.  Swallowing  diffi-
culties related to EPS could be resolved with switching to a 
SGA  with  low  incidence  of  EPS  [23],  such  as  quetiapine, 
olanzapine, aripiprazole  and clozapine [24]. Xerostomia  im-
pairs bolus formation and it could be induced by drugs with 
antagonistic  properties  on  muscarinic  receptors.  Moisture 
foods and candies to stimulate saliva production or artificial 
saliva could be of great help in some patients [17]. Sedative 
agents  can  inhibit  the  swallowing  reflex  by  acting  on  the 
swallowing  center  in  the  brainstem.  Some  antipsychotic 
drugs  have  sedative  properties,  though  they  could  be  tran-
sient as well as could be confounded by the concomitant use 
of  benzodiazepines  or  multiple  sedative  agents  [24].  It 
should be noted that xerostomia and sedation can be caused 
by  a  large  number  of  psychotropic  drugs,  therefore  poly-
pharmacy should be avoided. 

3.3.  Liquid  Antipsychotics  Versus  other  Coping  Strate-
gies for Swallowing Issues 

  Healthcare  professionals  should  evaluate  patients  with 
swallowing  difficulties  and  recommend  appropriate  man-
agement  plans.  When  possible,  etiological  treatment  of 
dysphagia  must  be  preferred  and  exclusion  of  drug-induced 
dysphagia  is  mandatory.  However,  swallowing  difficulties 
are often concealed and not reported. Patients and caregivers 
follow coping strategies often by their own volition, such as 
using facilitating techniques, omitting treatment, crushing, as 
well  as  splitting  and  mixing  tablets  with  foods  and  liquids 
[19].  These  strategies  are  usually  inappropriate  and  poten-
tially harmful. Licensed oral non-solid drug formulations can 
be a cost-effective solution when oral route administration is 
sufficient,  otherwise,  other  routes  of  administration,  e.g.  in-
tramuscular  administration,  should  be  used.  Liquid  antipsy-
chotic  may be preferable, yet  studies that  compare different 
coping strategies are lacking. 

3.3.1. Omitting Antipsychotic Treatment 

  Omission  of  treatment  seems  to  be  common  in  nursing 
homes,  and  it  might  be  higher  in  patients  with  swallowing 
difficulties  (9.8%  versus  2.9%)  [25].  Besides  reduced  non-
adherence,  abrupt  cessation  of  antipsychotics  could  lead  to 
discontinuation  syndromes.  The  symptoms  of  quetiapine 
discontinuation  syndrome  may  include  headache,  nausea, 
vomiting,  insomnia,  psychosis,  anxiety,  irritability,  and 
tachycardia.  The  IR  formulations  seem  to  be  more  likely  to 
induce  discontinuation  syndrome  in  comparison  to  quetiap-
ine  XR  [26].  Since  liquid  quetiapine  can  be  more  easily 
swallowed  and  masked  with  sweeteners,  it  could  increase 
adherence  rates  in  patients  with  swallowing  difficulties  re-
ducing the consequences of treatment omission. 

3.3.2. Altering Solid Oral Dosage Formulation 

  Another  common  coping  strategy  is  alteration  of  oral 
solid formulations by crushing, opening, splitting and mixing 
pills  with  food  or  liquids.  These  procedures  might  be  unli-
censed  and  change  the  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  the 
medication. As a result, they may be accompanied by poten-
tial harms for the patients as well as caregivers may be ren-
dered  liable  to  any  harm  caused.  Consensus  guidelines  and 
audit standards suggest that manipulations of dosage form as 
well  as  mixing  medicines  with  food  should  be  last  options 

and  they  should  be  used  only  after  consideration  and 
multidisciplinary  consultations  when  other  suitable  prepara-
tions are not available [17, 27]. 

First  of  all,  most  of  the  crushing  methods  have  limited 
reproducibility  and  poor-quality  control.  This  could  lead  to 
under-dosage or over-dosage due to unequal splitting as well 
as  to  the  loss  of  substance  [28].  Loss  of  substance  can  be 
significant when crushing methods are inappropriate and can 
be associated with substantial economic cost [29]. In certain 
cases, alteration of pharmacokinetic properties might be cru-
cial. Manipulation of extended-release pills can lead to faster 
absorption  of  the  drug  making  patients  prone  to  adverse 
events and severe intoxication, which can sometimes be fatal 
[19]. According to that, quetiapine XR should be swallowed 
as a whole and never be crushed, chewed or splitted [11]. A 
retrospective  study  of  a  case  series  suggested  that  acute 
quetiapine  overdose  could  be  associated  with  hypotension, 
tachycardia,  seizures,  respiratory  depression,  coma  or  even 
death  [30].  Overdose  in  geriatric  patients  might  be  more 
dangerous due to reduced clearance rates as well as frequent 
comorbidities. In addition, manipulating film-coated quetiap-
ine  IR  could  lead  to  bitter  taste  which  may  demotivate  pa-
tients  to  comply  with  treatment.  Crushing  conventional-
release  pills  and  especially  when  mixed  with  food  or  drink 
can also impair bioavailability and absorption [28]. 

  Regarding  the  risk  of  inappropriate  manipulation  meth-
ods faced by the caregivers, aerosolization of substances can 
expose caregivers to  the toxic,  carcinogenic  and pharmacol-
ogical  effects  of  the  substance  [31].  Most  importantly,  ethi-
cal  and  legal  issues  can  be  raised  by  manipulation  of  solid 
oral  dosage  formulations.  Since  the  use  of  manipulated  for-
mulations is outside the licensed restrictions of a medication, 
it  can  be  characterized  as  an  off-label.  Off-label  use  should 
be  based  on  scientific  evidence  as  well  as  it  requires  in-
formed  consent  from  the  patients,  who  could  be  limited  in 
geriatric  patients  especially  with  cognitive  impairment  and 
severe  mental  illness  [28].  As  a  result,  caregivers  could  be 
labile of any possible harmful outcome when they administer 
manipulated  formulations  in  patients  with  swallowing  diffi-
culties. 

  Despite the potentially harmful consequences, manipula-
tion  of  formulations  is  quite  common,  with  a  study  about 
70%  of  patients  attending  community  pharmacies  reporting 
that  they  crush  or  open  pills  to  overcome  swallowing  diffi-
culties [20]. Another survey in patients attending community 
pharmacies  suggested  that  manipulation  of  dose  was  com-
mon,  with  crushing  or  cutting  being  the  most  prominent 
(26%  of  coping  strategies  used)  followed  by  mixing  with 
food  or  drink  (13%)  and  opening  capsules  (2%).  However, 
only  4.5%  of  coping  strategies  requested  other  suitable  for-
mulations  [18].  Nurses  or  caregivers  have  the  responsibility 
to  administer  medication  in  nursing  homes  and  long-term 
care  facilities,  where  elderly  patients  with  swallowing  diffi-
culties or refusing to comply with medication are prominent. 
Liquid  formulations  are  rarely  available,  so  that  medication 
manipulation  is  a  common  practice.  A  cross-sectional  study 
suggested that about one-third of inpatients with severe men-
tal illness receive their medication mixed with food or drink, 
and in some patients (10%), administration is concealed due 
unavailability of consent. Main reasons for manipulating and

mixing medication with food or drink were swallowing diffi-
culties in about 62%  and refusal  to comply with medication 
in about 47% [27]. Especially in the elderly psychiatric inpa-
tients, who commonly have swallowing difficulties, medica-
tion  administration  errors  including  inappropriate  dosage 
manipulation are suggested to be more frequent, particularly 
regarding the antipsychotics dosage [25, 32, 33]. 

3.3.3. Liquid Versus Orodispersible Antipsychotics in Swal-
lowing Difficulties 

  Both liquid and orodispersible antipsychotics can be pre-
ferred to other solid oral dosage formulations in patients with 
swallowing  difficulties.  Systematic  studies  that  compare 
both formulations  are  lacking, but preliminary evidence can 
suggest that liquid antipsychotics could be more easily used. 
In  the  previous  observational  study  about  the  manipulation 
of  medication  in  geriatric  inpatients,  orodispersible  tablets 
contained 1% of the drugs. However, they were misused and 
still  crushed  with  consequently  possible  modification  of  the 
efficacy  [32].  In  another  observational  study  in  care  home 
residents  with  swallowing  difficulties,  caregivers  prepared 
orodispersible  tablets  according  to  the  instructions  of  the 
capsule  formulations  of  the  medication  [25].  As  a  result, 
orodispersible  tablets  can  be  wrongly  used  as  conventional 
pills,  possibly  due  to  lack  of  training  of  caregivers  and  pa-
tients.  Orodispersible  tablets  seem  to  facilitate  swallowing 
and be more  acceptable than other solid formulations  in pa-
tients  with  dysphagia  [34],  yet  oropharyngeal  residues  as 
well  as  airway  compromise  did  not  differ  between  orodis-
persible  and  conventional  tablets  [35].  However,  liquid  for-
mulations,  especially  thin  liquids,  might  be  associated  with 
an increased risk of  aspiration and aspiration-induced pneu-
monia.  Proper  volume  of  liquid,  increased  viscosity  as  well 
as  proper  swallowing  techniques  could  reduce  the  risk  of 
aspiration  [36].  Medication  administration  errors  can  also 
accompany  the  use  of  liquid  formulations,  especially  crude 
estimation  of  volume  could  result  in  inaccurate  doses.  Ad-
ministration and preparation of liquid formulations should be 
performed according to the summary of product characteris-
tics  and  all  related  information  should  be  included  in  the 
patient  information  leaflet.  As  a  result,  liquid  formulations 
could  be  an  attractive  alternative  to  oral  solid  formulations, 
but  the  risk  of  aspiration  as  well  as  potential  administration 
errors should be considered and evaluated. 

3.4.  Emergency  Setting:  Agitated  Patients  with  Schizo-
phrenia or Bipolar Disorder 

  Episodes  of  agitation  and  aggression  are  frequently  pre-
sented in about 90% of patients with schizophrenia or bipo-
lar disorder during their lifetime, and they require proper and 
prompt  treatment  [37].  Expert  consensus  recommendations 
suggest  that  goals  of  treatment  of  agitation  are  to  stabilize 
the  patient,  avoid  possible  restrictive  settings,  as  well  as  to 
ensure  the  physician-patient  relationship  and  arrange  an  af-
ter-care  plan.  In  this  setting,  the  agitated  patients  should  be 
rapidly  calmed  without  over-sedation  and  they  should  be 
involved in selecting both the drug and route of  administra-
tion. In addition, oral administration, especially of dispensa-
ble  tablets  and  solutions/suspensions  should  be  preferred  to 
intramuscular injections in mildly agitated patients [38]. 

  A  recent  systematic  review  of  RCT  could  not  identify 
consistent  superiority  of  any  pharmacological  interventions 
for  agitation  related  to  schizophrenia  and  bipolar  disorder. 
The  identified  literature  involved  olanzapine,  aripiprazole, 
haloperidol,  risperidone,  ziprasidone  and  lorazepam,  mostly 
administrated  via  parenteral  routes  [37].  Short-acting  intra-
muscular antipsychotics should be used mostly in emergency 
settings and when the patients are not cooperative. Parenteral 
administration of antipsychotics could disintegrate the thera-
peutic alliance with the patient, since they are invasive, pain-
ful  and  often  involuntary  administrated  [7].  Other  formula-
tions,  such  as  liquid  antipsychotics,  might  be  preferred  in 
cooperative and  less agitated patients.  Liquid  antipsychotics 
are more easily administrated, have a fast onset of action and 
secure  compliance  in  comparison  to  tablets,  as  well  as  they 
might be preferred by patients and strengthen the physician-
patients’  relationship.  Despite  the  limited  clinical  evidence, 
liquid antipsychotics seem to be efficacious and tolerable as 
the tablet and intramuscular formulations [4]. 

  Liquid quetiapine could be a reasonable choice for mildly 
agitated  patients.  In  a  short-term  liquid,  quetiapine  could 
stabilize  agitated  patients  with  its  combined  antipsychotic 
and  sedative  properties.  The  efficacy  and  tolerability  of 
quetiapine,  including  the  liquid  formulation,  have  not  been 
studied  extensively  in  patients  with  agitation.  Clinical  trials 
suggest  that  quetiapine  is  superior  to  placebo  and  does  not 
differ  significantly  to  haloperidol  for  aggression  and  agita-
tion  in  patients  with  psychosis  [38].  In  long-term,  liquid 
quetiapine  can  improve  adherence  to  treatment.  Liquid 
quetiapine could be selected by mildly agitated patients will-
ing  to  cooperate.  It  can  secure  compliance  with  treatment 
under  supervision,  avoiding  unnecessary  and  involuntary 
administration  of  intramuscular  injections.  Along  with  the 
reduced  risk  for  extrapyramidal  symptoms,  these  will  im-
prove  patients’  perceptions  and  attitudes  towards  the  treat-
ment,  making  them  more  willing  to  comply  with  mainte-
nance  treatment.  Since  SGA  are  preferred  during  mainte-
nance  treatment,  liquid  quetiapine  or  its  other  formulations 
could  be  continued  during  maintenance  treatment  avoiding 
unnecessary switching of antipsychotics. 

CONCLUSION 

  Liquid  quetiapine  has  the  same  efficacy  and  safety  pro-
file  with  immediate  release  oral  form  of  quetiapine.  Conse-
quently, it can be used for the same indications (schizophre-
nia,  bipolar  disorder).  Our  review  suggests  that  the  liquid 
form  of  quetiapine  has  significant  clinical  utility  in  patients 
with  poor  adherence,  in  emergency  settings  as  well  as  in 
patients with swallowing difficulties, thus, it can be defined 
as  value  added  medicine.  Value-added  medicines  represent 
an opportunity for increasing the cost-effectiveness of treat-
ments  or  services  that  may  bring  substantial  value  to  indi-
vidual patients and society. They may also represent an op-
portunity  to  limit  therapeutic  escalation  by  increasing  the 
number of treatment options and to reduce budget impact by 
creating an intermediate step before switching to more costly 
products.  Additionally,  they  offer  the  opportunity  to  tailor 
and expand access of well-known therapies to particular pa-
tient  subgroups’  needs,  such  as  vulnerable  patients  or  pa-
tients requiring frequent dosing adjustments [39]. The liquid

Papazisis and Siafis 

quetiapine form has added value for the patients delivered by 
the convenience of use and its use in specific subpopulation 
with  high  unmet  needs  (dysphagia/swallowing  difficulties). 
These  improvements  may  enhance  adherence,  health  out-
comes or quality of life, and match patients’ and/or caregiv-
ers’  preferences.  However,  the  risk  of  aspiration  and  poten-
tial  administration  errors  cannot  be  excluded  and  should  al-
ways be considered with the use of liquid formulations [40]. 

  Concluding, the liquid form of quetiapine can be defined 
as  value  added  medicine  bringing  key  benefits  to  the  pa-
tients,  the  caregivers  and  also  to  the  health  care  system. 
Since  value-added  medicines  may  contribute  to  favorably 
impact healthcare budgets  and bring substantial value to in-
dividual patients and the society, the liquid form of quetiap-
ine should be implemented in routine clinical practice.
