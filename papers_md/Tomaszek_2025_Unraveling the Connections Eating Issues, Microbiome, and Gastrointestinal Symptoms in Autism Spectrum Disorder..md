Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition character-
ized by challenges in social communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. It
is also associated with a high prevalence of eating disorders, gastrointestinal (GI) symp-
toms, and alterations in gut microbiota composition. One of the most pressing concerns
is food selectivity. Various eating disorders, such as food neophobia, avoidant/restrictive
food intake disorder (ARFID), specific dietary patterns, and poor-quality diets, are com-
monly observed in this population, often leading to nutrient deficiencies. Additionally,
gastrointestinal problems in children with ASD are linked to imbalances in gut micro-
biota and immune system dysregulation. The aim of this narrative review is to identify
previous associations between the gut–brain axis and gastrointestinal problems in ASD.
We discuss the impact of the “microbiome–gut–brain axis”, a bidirectional connection
between gut microbiota and brain function, on the development and symptoms of ASD. In
gastrointestinal problems associated with ASD, a ‘vicious cycle’ may play a significant role:
ASD symptoms contribute to the prevalence of ARFID, which in turn leads to microbiota
degradation, ultimately worsening ASD symptoms. Current data suggest a link between
gastrointestinal problems in ASD and the microbiota, but the amount of evidence is limited.
Further research is needed, targeting the correlation of a patient’s microbiota status, dietary
habits, and disease course.

1. Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental conditions char-
acterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication, alongside restricted or
repetitive behaviors [1]. The median prevalence of ASD is estimated at 0.72% [2], and recent
studies report a continued rise over time, both at the national level and within specific
subgroups [3]. While the core features of ASD are well-established, there is increasing
recognition of the presence of feeding disorders, gastrointestinal issues, and changes in
gut microbiota among affected individuals [4]. Common gastrointestinal symptoms in-
clude constipation, abdominal pain, and diarrhea [5]. Additionally, research indicates a
significant disparity in feeding problems between children with and without ASD, with
those in the former group being approximately five times more likely to experience such

issues [6]. Moreover, patients with ASD often exhibit a high incidence of selective eat-
ing patterns, such as food neophobia and food selectivity, which are both components
of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) [7,8]. These eating difficulties are
frequently influenced by behavioral rigidity (difficulty in adapting to changes in routine,
environment, or expectations, leading to repetitive and restricted behaviors [9]), sensory
sensitivities, and anxiety—key characteristics of ASD [10].

The complex interplay between feeding problems, gastrointestinal symptoms, and the
gut–brain axis in children with ASD presents a critical area of investigation. By examining
these intricate interactions, we aim to answer the question: what is the link between gastric
symptoms, ASD, and microbiota?

2. Materials and Methods

The aim of this narrative review was to describe evidence for a three-way interaction
between ASD, eating issues, and gut microbiota alterations, specifically examining how
food selectivity patterns in ASD affect gut microbiota composition and its potential feedback
effects on ASD symptoms through the gut–brain axis.

We included studies from the years 2000–2024. During the initial search, we included
both original and review articles to identify potential records and original studies during
the screening process. The PubMed database was searched on 31 November 2024, for
studies published between 2004 and 2024 using the following search terms and their
combinations: “ARFID, genetics, food selectivity, sensory sensitivity, food neophobia,
ASD, children, mealtime, dietary patterns, diet quality, gastrointestinal symptoms, vitamin
deficiency, micronutrients, metabolic syndrome, gut microbiota, microbiome, microbiota-
gut-brain axis”.

Subsequently, duplicates were removed using EndNote 21 software (some studies
appeared multiple times due to the use of various combinations of search terms). Since
this work is a narrative review, we did not establish strict inclusion criteria for the articles.
During the screening process, we included studies that focused on nutritional problems in
children with ASD, as well as selected studies describing this issue in animal models. Based
on titles and abstracts, the authors excluded studies that focused strictly on adults and
conference abstracts. We also excluded studies not written in English. We also included
supporting literature covering possible therapies.

Our flexible search strategy reflects the need to synthesize information from diverse
sources due to the substantial heterogeneity of human studies, which precludes further syn-
thesis. Consequently, we emphasize that this work is a narrative review, which constitutes
its primary limitation.

3. Eating Disorders Associated ASD

Feeding abnormalities in individuals with ASD can begin early in life, even during
breastfeeding. Common challenges during this period include disorganized and vigorous
sucking that continues despite the child being satiated [11]. A study by Provost et al. found
that children with ASD often struggle to eat in various settings, with over half experiencing
difficulties dining at regular restaurants and facing challenges when eating at friends’
homes [12]. These issues can manifest in reactions such as screaming, crying, and tantrums
when encountering unknown foods or when others are eating [13].

Another category of eating-related difficulties is food selectivity (FS), commonly
defined by three domains: food refusal, limited food variety, and high-frequency single
food intake [14]. Rejection can stem from food sensory factors or preferences for its
appearance [15]. Molina-López et al. compared 55 ASD children to 91 neurotypical (NT)
peers using the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) [16]. Results showed FS in 60.6% of

Nutrients 2025, 17, 486

3 of 28

the ASD group versus 37.9% of the NT group, with FS defined as rejecting over 33% of
offered foods. Similarly, Sharp et al. found that 78% of 70 ASD children omitted one or
more food groups, most often vegetables (67.1%) [15]. Bandini et al. also observed this
trend in a study comparing 53 ASD and 58 NT children aged 3–11, where ASD children
rejected 41.7% of foods compared to 18.9% in NT peers [17].

One of the key components of food selectivity is food neophobia (FN). FN is defined
as a reluctance or even fear of trying new foods [18]. While FN is also common in NT
children, it often is transient for them. ASD children, on the other hand, tend to present this
behavior constantly over time [19]. Wallace et al. state that FN is more prevalent within the
ASD population than in NT children [20]. Interestingly, the paper shows that FN in the NT
population leads to lower Body Mass Index (BMI), whereas when combined with ASD, it
leads to higher BMI. Kral et al. confirm that ASD children are significantly more reluctant
to try unfamiliar food [21].

4. Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is a clinically diagnosable type of food
selectivity, characterized by significant limitations in both the quantity and variety of food
consumed. However, unlike FS or FN, to be diagnosed, it must result in malnutrition,
substantial weight loss, or nutritional deficiencies, often requiring reliance on nutritional
supplements or tube feeding to maintain health. Unlike anorexia nervosa (AN) or bulimia
nervosa (BN), ARFID is not associated with body image concerns or a desire to be thin.
In addition to physical health consequences, the disorder can cause notable difficulties in
personal, social, educational, or occupational functioning, particularly when social eating
situations provoke distress or avoidance [22].

The prevalence of ARFID in the general population is not well established, but esti-
mates suggest it may affect between 0.5% and 5% of people [23]. Research has shown that,
in comparison to individuals with AN or BN, patients with ARFID tend to be younger,
are more likely to be male, and are often diagnosed with co-occurring psychiatric and/or
medical issues [24].

In a comprehensive, nationwide study conducted in Sweden involving 16,951 twin
pairs aged 6 to 12 years, findings revealed a high heritability for ARFID, indicating that
genetic factors significantly contribute to the disorder’s development. Additionally, the
study found that non-shared environmental factors played a smaller yet significant role [25].
Koomar et al. conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants asso-
ciated with ARFID. The study found one genome-wide significant single nucleotide poly-
morphism on chromosome 5 near the gene ZSWIM6. This gene has been previously impli-
cated in neurodevelopmental conditions like cognitive impairment and schizophrenia [26].
ARFID often presents with characteristics similar to those observed in children and
adolescents with ASD. Among children diagnosed with ARFID, the prevalence of ASD
ranges from 8.2% to 54.8% [27]. In contrast, the prevalence of ARFID in the general pediatric
population is significantly lower, estimated at approximately 3.2% based on self-reported
data from primary school children [28].

4.1. ARFID Subtypes

DSM-5 [29] and ICD-11 [30] identify three main subtypes of ARFID: lack of interest,
sensory–sensitivity-based and fear/aversive. A fourth subtype, combined presentation,
may be diagnosed when multiple causal factors are present.

The lack of interest subtype often experiences difficulties with the act of eating, such
as taking small bites and requiring prolonged time to finish meals. The sensory–sensitivity
subtype exhibits a restricted variety of foods due to sensory issues and aversions to certain

Nutrients 2025, 17, 486

4 of 28

items. This group usually displays profound rigidity in their eating behaviors, manifesting
as food selectivity and food neophobia. The aversive subtype develops avoidance behaviors
due to specific experiences or fears, such as choking or vomiting. This pattern of nutritional
restriction often evolves from a traumatic event or a deep-seated fear of choking, pain, or
nausea, leading to significant anxiety surrounding food intake. However, this subtype
may represent a distinct and mutually exclusive category, showing no overlap with the
characteristics of other presentations [31].

Sanchez-Cerezo et al. performed a surveillance study utilizing latent class analysis
(LCA) [32]. They assessed the following six binary factors: lack of appetite, lack of interest
in eating or food, difficulties with practicalities of feeding behaviors (e.g., small bites or slow
eating), sensory sensitivity (e.g., sensitivity to taste, smell, color, or texture), rigid eating
behaviors (e.g., brand-specific preferences or food items cannot touch on the plate), and
fear of aversive consequences of eating (e.g., choking or vomiting). Researchers classified
319 children and adolescents in the UK and Ireland into the four mentioned subtypes of
ARFID. The combined subtype was the most prevalent (38.2%), characterized by high
probabilities of all assessed symptoms except fear of eating. The Sensory subtype (29.5%)
displayed predominantly sensory sensitivity and rigid eating behaviors, while the Lack
of Interest subtype (25.1%) manifested through a pronounced lack of appetite and food
interest as well as medium practical difficulties. The fear subtype, the least common one
(7.2%), presented with strong fear of aversive consequences, shorter symptom duration,
and elevated anxiety levels. It is worth noting that analysis of the classes revealed that
the combined and sensory subtypes had significantly more ASD occurrences than the
other classes.

According to Eddy et al., the distribution is slightly different—the predominant sub-
type of ARFID is characterized by insufficient food intake and a lack of interest in feeding,
accounting for 57.6% of cases [33]. The second most common subtype involves a limited
diet based on sensory preferences, comprising 21.2% of cases. Conversely, the subtype
associated with aversive or traumatic experiences is relatively rare.

The most common subtype of ARFID in individuals with ASD is linked to heightened
sensory sensitivities [34]. Although patients with ASD display increased sensitivity to
sensory aspects of food and show reduced interest in eating, they do not significantly
differ from non-ASD patients in their concern about aversive consequences, such as fear of
choking or vomiting [35] (Table 1).

4.2. ARFID Impact on Gut Microbiome

ARFID affects the gut microbiota by altering microbial diversity and composition.
Children with ARFID exhibit changes in gut microbiota diversity, showing higher diversity
indices compared to healthy controls. There is an increased abundance of potentially
pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacterales and Bacteroidaceae—including species like
Bacteroides vulgatus—and a significant reduction in beneficial Bifidobacterium species. This
dysbiotic state suggests an imbalance between harmful and beneficial bacteria, potentially
affecting the gut–brain axis (further expanded below in Sections 9 and 10) [36].

5. Impact of Sensory Processing Issues, Behavioral Rigidity, and Anxiety
on Food Preferences

A key characteristic of autism is the presence of Restrictive and Repetitive Behaviors
(RRB) [37]. In addition, autistic children often exhibit sensory processing issues, such as
atypical sensory modulation (ASM), where they respond disproportionately to sensory
stimuli [38]. Patients with ASD typically exhibit much higher levels of oral sensory over-
sensitivity (SOR) compared to those without ASD [39].

Because of that, children with ASD may have strong reactions to specific food attributes
such as smell, taste, appearance, temperature, texture, or composition. These sensory
oversensitivities could be one of the reasons why FS is so common among ASD children [19].
A study by Byrska et al. compared the FS patterns of children with ASD to NT children
based on various food traits [40]. The authors found that ASD children are more likely
to refuse food that is sour, sticky, or when ingredients are mixed or touched on the plate,
compared to NT children. Similarly, Hubbard et al. report that ASD children often reject
food based on texture or consistency and when ingredients are combined, while these
factors are less significant for NT children [41].

Intolerable food consumption often leads to refusal behaviors such as crying, pushing
away the feeder or spoon, turning the head, blocking the mouth, and, in some instances,
more severe reactions like fleeing from the table, aggression, or self-harm [42].

A longitudinal study by Suarez et al. [43] and a follow-up [44] examined sensory
over-responsivity (SOR) and FS over time. Using a custom SOR questionnaire and the
Repetitive Behaviors Scale–Revised (RBS-R) for repetitive behaviors (RRB), they found
that SOR was significantly linked to FS, with this relationship persisting over two years.
Increased SOR also predicted more severe FS, but RRB was not an independent predictor,
suggesting a strong correlation between SOR and RRB. Bandini et al. also confirm that food
repertoire in ASD patients does not increase over time [45].

Eating disorders, particularly food selectivity, food neophobia, and avoidant/restrictive
food intake disorder, are highly prevalent among individuals with autism spectrum dis-
order due to sensory processing issues, behavioral rigidity, and anxiety. These challenges
often result in a limited dietary variety, persistent nutritional deficiencies, and social diffi-
culties, with sensory sensitivities playing a critical role.

6. Dietary Patterns in Children with ASD

It is well documented that a properly varied diet greatly impacts children’s cognitive
and physical development [46]. Unfortunately, parents of children with ASD regularly face
significant challenges in providing a balanced and nutritious diet for their children [8].

The initial stages of feeding are significant for a child’s growth and development
and require considerable attention in the context of ASD [47]. Xiang et al. conducted
a comprehensive investigation into the feeding patterns of children with ASD and their
typically developing (TD) counterparts. The researchers observed that children diagnosed
with ASD were breastfed for a shorter duration than TD controls, with an average of
8 months compared to 10 months, respectively. An analysis of results from the Autism
Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) revealed that
children who were breastfed for 12 months or more exhibited lower scores than those
who were breastfed for less than 6 months. Furthermore, ASD-diagnosed children were
introduced to complementary foods at a later stage and demonstrated a lower acceptance
rate. This resulted in longer periods of bottle-feeding [48].

A questionnaire study conducted by Emond et al. indicated that individuals with
ASD exhibited feeding difficulties from infancy and had diets that were less diversified
from the age of 15 months. At six months of age, parents reported challenges with the
introduction of solid foods and described their children as “slow eaters”. Additionally,
children consumed less fruit and vegetables, sweets, and carbonated beverages. However,
no differences were observed in weight, height, or BMI at 18 months and seven years
between the ASD patients and the control group [49].

The findings of a study by Evans et al. also indicated a lower consumption of fruits
and vegetables in the ASD group compared to typically developing children. Contrary to
findings in the above-mentioned study, autistic children displayed a preference for snack
foods and dairy-free sweetened soft drinks [50].

The research group of Plaza-Diaz et al.

identified a comparable pattern in their
investigation. A lower intake of fruits and vegetables was reported in the ASD children.
Foods of high fat and high energy content, including juices, snack foods, confectionery, and
baked goods, characterized the subjects’ dietary choices. Additionally, an increase in dairy
consumption was associated with a greater intake of cereals and pasta. Children exhibited
lower consumption of lean meat and eggs, with excessive intake of fatty meats. Parents
also reported that their children were more likely to eat meat when it was shredded [51].
A further study conducted by Raspini et al. indicated that preschoolers diagnosed
with ASD consumed a greater quantity of soft drinks, sweetened fruit juices, and snacks
(including cookies, puddings, crackers, breadsticks, fried fish, and French fries) than age-
matched peers with TD. The participants consumed greater quantities of yogurt, milk,
and red meat. Conversely, their intake of raw vegetables, fruits, and cereals diminished,
reducing fiber intake. Children with ASD also exhibited increased consumption of simple
carbohydrates and processed foods [52].

In their study, Malhi et al. observed that children with ASD demonstrated a reduced
intake of a range of food items, including fruits and vegetables (such as spinach, tomatoes,
potatoes, oranges, and papaya) and proteins [53].

The study by Diolordi et al. identified a statistically significant reduction in milk and
yogurt consumption among children with ASD compared to the control group. Addition-
ally, researchers noted a marked decrease in vegetable intake within the ASD group, with
41% of children (mean age 58.3 months) never consuming vegetables, in contrast to only
6.9% of TD children. A significantly higher frequency of rice and pulse consumption was
also observed among children with ASD. Additionally, the individuals ingested greater
quantities of snacks, fruit juices, pasta, pizza, and biscuits. There was no notable diver-

Nutrients 2025, 17, 486

gence in fruit intake between the two cohorts. Although children with ASD consumed less
meat and fish overall, these differences were not statistically significant. Notably, 27.3% of
children with ASD had never tried fish, compared to none in the TD group. Such aversions
may be attributed to the flavor of fish or the presence of bones [54].

Schreck et al. conducted an in-depth investigation into the specific food preferences of
children with ASD, using data gathered through caregiver-completed questionnaires. Their
study identified food items consumed by over 50% of children with ASD. Among fruits
and proteins, commonly consumed items included apples, grapes, apple and grape juice,
baked chicken, chicken nuggets, hot dogs, ice cream, and peanut butter. Preferred starches
among this group included cake, cookies, crackers, French fries, pasta, pizza, potato chips,
pretzels, spaghetti, and white bread [55].

Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder typically have a restricted and selective diet.
Studies indicate that their diet often includes limited fruits and vegetables. Commonly
consumed foods include high-calorie snacks, processed foods, and carbohydrate-rich
items such as pasta, pizza, biscuits, and white bread. Dairy intake is reduced with lower
milk and yogurt consumption, while dairy-free soft drinks and sweetened fruit juices
are frequently preferred. Protein intake is also limited, with lower lean meats and fish
consumption. A typical meal might consist of products like chicken nuggets, French fries,
or pasta, accompanied by fruit juice, with limited fresh vegetables or varied protein sources
(Figure 1).

Figure 1. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often display selective eating habits,
favoring high-calorie snacks, processed foods, and refined carbohydrates like pasta, pizza, and white
bread while consuming fewer fruits, vegetables, lean meats, fish, and whole grains. Dairy intake is
typically low, while sweetened beverages and juices are preferred. These dietary patterns increase
the risk of nutritional deficiencies, including calcium, iron, iodine, zinc, and vitamins A, D, E, and B
complex. Calcium and vitamin D deficiencies can impair bone development, while a preference for
calorie-dense foods raises the risk of obesity and metabolic conditions like diabetes and hypertension.

7. Diet Quality of Patients with ASD

A review of the diets of children with autism may raise concerns about their adequate
nutrition and the provision of all necessary macro- and micronutrients. Food selectivity,
neophobia, and the avoidance of specific foods, coupled with a preference for others, places
children with ASD at greater risk of nutritional deficits. Moreover, as parents experience
a range of challenges when introducing new foods, their rising anxiety, concern, and
frustration frequently result in children being served the same meals repeatedly [8,56].
Parents tend to concentrate on mealtime behavior, rather than reflecting on the appropriate
nutritional approaches for their children [57].

In the study mentioned above by Plaza-Diaz et al., the research group was character-
ized by higher energy density and elevated levels of saturated fats, calcium, and vitamin
C, while showing deficiencies in iron, iodine, and B vitamins (such as riboflavin and folic
acid) [51]. Consistent findings across various studies indicate additional deficiencies in
micronutrients: calcium, zinc, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, selenium, and cop-
per [58–60]. Vitamins A, C, D, and E deficiencies are also commonly identified [61]. In
some cases, severe vitamin C deficiency has even resulted in scurvy [62]. Several studies
have indicated that children with ASD exhibit impaired bone development and reduced
mineral density, which in turn increases the risk of fractures. This may be associated with
reduced consumption of calcium and vitamin D [63].

Feeding disturbances in ASD children may contribute significantly to the risk of
malnutrition. Children with ASD are particularly vulnerable to being underweight, often
due to reduced caloric intake from selective food rejection [64]. At the same time, they face
an increased risk of overweight and obesity, attributed to preferences for calorie-dense foods
high in carbohydrates, simple sugars, and fats [65].A study conducted in Turkey revealed
that the majority of the sampled children exhibited either overweight or obesity (58.5%).
Furthermore, 11% of the children were classified as thin (3rd–15th percentile) or severely
thin (<3rd percentile) [59].The results of a study based on US nationally representative
data indicate that the prevalence of obesity in children with ASD was 30.4%, compared
to 23.6% of children without autism [66]. These dietary patterns may also heighten their
susceptibility to metabolic conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and
diabetes [67].

In their study, Demir et al. found that the dietary behavior of children with ASD may
affect their anthropometric outcomes, as children with ASD had higher BMI z-scores and
lower height z-scores compared to healthy controls [68].

Despite the limited variety of foods consumed and food refusal, most research did not
show significant differences in total caloric, carbohydrate, protein, or fat intake between
the ASD and typically developing control groups [69].Current literature lacks a definitive
consensus on these findings, necessitating further research to achieve greater clarity. A
notable limitation of survey-based studies assessing dietary patterns and nutrient intake
in children with ASD is their reliance on questionnaire data, which depends heavily on
the accuracy and recall of participants regarding food types and quantities consumed.
Additionally, these questionnaires are often administered over a short time frame (e.g., one
to several days), which may not adequately reflect long-term dietary patterns. Furthermore,
many studies focus on cohorts from specific countries, potentially introducing cultural and
dietary differences that limit the generalizability of findings to children in other regions.

8. Characteristic of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Children with ASD

Among patients with ASD, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are frequently reported
as more prevalent and severe. The occurrence of GI symptoms among children with ASD
varies widely across studies, ranging from 9% to 84%, compared to 9–37% in children
without ASD [70]. The most commonly reported symptoms include abdominal pain and
discomfort, constipation, diarrhea, soiling, flatulence, nausea or vomiting, and gastroe-
sophageal reflux (GERD) [71]. Moreover, food allergies are more frequently found in
children with ASD, with a rate of 20–25% compared to only 5–8% in children without
ASD [72].

Food selectivity and behaviors associated with ARFID impact the gut microbiota
composition. Neophobia reduces microbial diversity in the intestines. This decreased
diversity is hypothesized to contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal
pain and irregular stool consistency, ranging from loose to hard stools [73].

What is more, avoiding large food groups can also affect the gastrointestinal system
and exacerbate symptoms like reflux, abdominal pain, nausea, or issues with intestinal
motility [74].

A significantly lower intake of fruits and vegetables reduces fiber consumption, and
combined with insufficient fluid intake, may hinder healthy intestinal transit and increase
the likelihood of constipation [75].

Diarrhea in individuals with ASD may be influenced by dietary preferences, such
as excessive carbohydrate and low-fat consumption, as well as overfeeding, food aller-
gies/intolerances, and anxiety or stress. Excessive consumption of sugary drinks or fruit
juices may also be a contributing factor, due to the high concentrations of fructose, sorbitol,
and mannitol they contain. It should be noted that overflow incontinence in the course of
constipation can be mistaken for diarrhea [76]. Pica, which involves eating non-food items,
can also increase the risk of diarrhea by irritating the digestive tract, causing bacterial or
parasitic infections, and causing nutrient imbalances [77].

It is not fully understood why children with ASD are more likely to have reflux, but it
is thought that delayed gastric emptying, impaired esophageal motility, and differences in
sensory processing may contribute [19].

Abdominal pain and discomfort in individuals with ASD may stem from a heightened
sensitivity to internal sensations, including pressure on the abdomen, the texture of clothing,
and other internal stimuli [78,79]. However, any gastrointestinal symptoms in children
with ASD should always be considered in the context of common gastrointestinal disorders
in the pediatric population.

Some drugs can also impact GI tract function; for example, stimulants can cause
abdominal pain, while beta-blockers can result in constipation, diarrhea, and stomach
irritation [80,81]. Antipsychotics and antiepileptic drugs can also cause constipation [82].
Because GI symptoms affect children’s ability to concentrate and cause anxiety, they
can interfere with development and learning skills. Treating these symptoms can improve
behavior, cognitive function, school performance, and overall well-being. Clinicians should
consider that behaviors perceived as “picky” may be protective responses. Children
with ASD, who often struggle to communicate symptoms, require closer observation.
Parents and clinicians must recognize vocal, sensory, and motor cues that may signal GI-
related pain [83]. Vocal indicators may include throat clearing, guttural sounds, screaming,
moaning, or sobbing. Motor behaviors might include pressing the abdomen, pointing,
certain repetitive and unusual movements, abnormal posture, or aggressive and self-
injurious actions [84]. GI problems can also cause frequent swallowing, spitting, ear
rubbing, and coughing and contribute to sleep problems [85] (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience gastrointestinal (GI)
symptoms, which are communicated through non-verbal cues due to their difficulty in expressing dis-
comfort. These cues can be categorized into vocal behaviors (e.g., throat clearing, moaning, sobbing),
motor behaviors (e.g., abdominal pressing, pointing, self-injury), aggressive behaviors (e.g., irritabil-
ity, tantrums), and sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep) [83,84]. Common
causes include dysbiosis, gastroesophageal reflux, stomach pain, constipation, and medication side
effects [72,82,86]. Early identification of these behaviors is crucial for timely intervention, improving
the child’s overall well-being.

The prevalence of GI symptoms in children with ASD shows considerable variability
between studies, most likely due to differences in study populations, methodologies,
and diagnostic criteria. Verbal communication difficulties are also a significant barrier to
collecting reliable data. Further research is also required for a better understanding of
the relationship between the increased incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients
diagnosed with autism and the gut–microbiome–brain axis.

9. The Gut–Brain Axis and Gut Microbiota in ASD

The gut–brain axis is a bidirectional communication network linking the central
nervous system (CNS) with the enteric nervous system (ENS). It plays a crucial role in
maintaining homeostasis and influences many processes, including behavior, mood, and
cognition [87].

The trillions of microorganisms living in our gastrointestinal tract, elegantly named
the gut microbiota, have garnered enormous interest from the scientific world this past
decade. This complex system has become a crucial area of study in understanding various
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including ASD (Figure 3).

Figure 3. The gut–brain axis is a complex, bidirectional communication network linking the cen-
tral nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), playing a key role in regulat-
ing mood, cognition, and overall health. This interaction occurs through four primary pathways:
(A) the neural pathway, where the vagus nerve facilitates direct communication between the gut
and brain [88]; (B) the endocrine pathway, involving the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis
and gut hormones like GLP-1 and PYY to mediate stress responses and regulate appetite [89–91];
(C) the immune system pathway, where cytokines and immune cells modulate neuroinflammation
and brain function [92,93]; (D) the microbial metabolites pathway, where microbial byproducts like
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) influence neurotransmitter production and maintain blood–brain
barrier integrity [94–97]. Disruptions in these pathways, such as dysbiosis or increased intestinal per-
meability, can lead to neuroinflammation, altered neurotransmitter levels, and various neurological
or psychiatric disorders [98,99].

Gastrointestinal disturbances affect up to 70% of children with ASD, making them
one of the most prevalent problems of this condition [100]. Moreover, the severity of
these symptoms correlates with the severity of ASD [101,102]. This implies a potential
role of the gut microbiota in ASD. The composition and function of gut microbiota are
shaped by multiple factors, including mode of delivery at birth, genetic predisposition,
physical activity levels, dietary patterns, environmental exposures, infections, and antibiotic
usage [103].

Research findings on the characteristic gut microbiota composition in individuals
with ASD remain inconsistent, with studies often reporting contradictory results regarding
specific bacterial species. Scientists use varying approaches to analyze the composition of
gut microbiota. Culture-dependent methods isolate and identify viable bacterial species.
Real-time PCR quantifies specific bacterial taxa through DNA amplification and detection.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) allows for visualization and identification of
specific bacterial populations using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes targeting
ribosomal RNA. 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing provides culture-independent, compre-
hensive profiling of the bacterial communities through high-throughput sequencing of
the conserved 16S rRNA gene regions, enabling taxonomic classification of the diverse
bacterial populations present in the samples [104,105].

In their meta-analysis, Xu et al. analyzed 9 studies to summarize previous literature
on the topic of gut microbiota in ASD [106]. They concluded that participants with ASD
had lower amounts of Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Escherichia coli, and Entero-
coccus and higher quantities of Faecalibacterium and Lactobacillus. There was also a slight
increase in the abundance of Ruminococcus and Clostridium [106]. A larger meta-analysis

examining 18 studies revealed some contrasting findings. While this study confirmed the
increased abundance of Faecalibacterium and decreased levels of Bifidobacterium in ASD
children, it showed higher levels of Bacteroides—contrary to Xu et al.’s findings. The study
also identified three predominant bacterial phyla in ASD children (Bacteroidetes, Firmi-
cutes, and Actinobacteria) and found increased levels of Parabacteroides, Clostridium, and
Phascolarctobacterium, along with reduced Coprococcus abundance [107].

Desbonnet et al. documented that germ-free (GF) mice prefer to spend more time
in isolation rather than interacting with other mice. They also showed that colonizing
these mice with pathogen-free gut microbiota increased sociability but did not affect social
novelty [108]. Some studies show that mice with gut microbiota depleted by antibiotics
also show disorders in social behavior [109,110]. Offspring of mice that were fed with a
high-fat diet (HFD) during pregnancy showed ASD-like social symptoms. Introducing
certain bacteria, such as L. reuteri, improved social deficits in these mice [110]. Improvement
of social behavior was correlated with increased levels of oxytocin in the hypothalamus,
a hormone crucial for the modulation of social interactions [111]. The vagus nerve is a
prerequisite for the effectiveness of reversing social deficits by L. reuteri, as vagotomized
mice did not show improvements in social behavior after introducing L. reuteri [112].

Bove et al. demonstrated a potential role of chemical signaling in a BTBR mice model.
BTBR mice are an inbred mouse strain that present human autism-like behaviors [113].
Analyses of serum and intestinal contents showed decreased amounts of 5-amino valeric
acid (5AV) and taurine, weak gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists. Ad-
ministering 5AV and taurine to BTBR mice improved their social behavior and reduced
repetitive behaviors [114].

The immune pathway’s role in linking gut microbiota and the brain is clearly outlined
in a model of ASD induced by maternal polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) [115].
Poly(I:C) is a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that triggers the
typical inflammatory response seen during viral infections [116]. It is a crucial part of
the maternal immune activation (MIA) hypothesis that proposes disturbance of fetal neu-
rodevelopment in response to inflammatory reaction [117]. In offspring of mice treated
with poly(I:C), there are alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota, as well as
increased levels of the microbial metabolite 4-ethylphenylsulfate (4EPS), which can in-
duce anxiety-like behaviors [115]. Supplementation of MIA offspring with the human
commensal Bacteroides fragilis corrected defects in gut permeability, reduced anxiety-like
and stereotypic behavior, as well as decreased levels of 4EPS [115]. These findings further
confirm the role of the microbiota–gut–brain axis in ASD.

10. How ARFID, Dietary Selectivity, and Dietary Neophobia Can Affect
the Gut Microbiome?

Despite the topic’s importance, research remains limited, with just one study by Ye
et al. addressing the topic of ARFID and its impact on the gut microbiota [36]. Their study
included 102 children with ARFID and 33 healthy children (HC). The researchers analyzed
stool samples using 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing. 16S rDNA sequencing tar-
gets the conserved 16S ribosomal RNA gene to enable bacterial taxonomic classification
based on hypervariable regions. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing sequences all microbial
DNA present in a sample without target amplification [104]. While 16S rDNA sequencing
allows for bacteria identification only to the genus level, metagenome sequencing allows
for more precise information, such as information at the species level. Ye and colleagues
found that the richness of microbial species (Chao1 index) was greater in healthy children,
while the diversity of microbial species (Shannon index and Simpson index) was higher
in the ARFID group. The microbial composition differed between groups, with the HC

Nutrients 2025, 17, 486

13 of 28

group characterized by enrichment of Actinobacteriota and its hierarchical taxa (class Acti-
nobacteria, order Bifidobacteriales, family Bifidobacteriaceae, and genus Bifidobacterium).
Conversely, the ARFID group showed elevated levels of both Enterobacterales (including
family Enterobacteriaceae) and Bacteroidaceae (including genus Bacteroides and species
B. vulgatus) [36] (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Children with ARFID exhibited higher microbial diversity but lower species richness
compared to healthy children. Their gut microbiota showed increased levels of potentially harmful
bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides vulgatus, which have mixed effects on gut
health—both reducing inflammation in some contexts and promoting inflammatory bowel disorders
in others [36,118–121]. In contrast, beneficial Bifidobacterium species, known for supporting gut health,
were significantly reduced in the ARFID group [122].

Analysis of the ARFID group revealed alterations in their gut bacterial composition.
These changes followed two concerning patterns: an increase in potentially harmful bac-
teria and a decrease in beneficial ones. The increased bacteria included members of the
Enterobacteriaceae family, which are well-known for their pathogenic associations [118].
Another increased species was Bacteroides vulgatus, which shows complex effects on gut
health. While Bacteroides species generally benefit gut health by producing short-chain
fatty acids (SCFAs) [119], B. vulgatus specifically has shown contradictory effects: it can
both reduce inflammation in some conditions [120] and promote inflammatory bowel dis-
orders in others [121]. Concurrent with these increases, ARFID patients showed markedly
reduced levels of beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Given Bifidobacterium’s established role
in immune regulation, inflammation control, and potential anti-aging effects [122], this
bacterial profile suggests a dysbiotic state that may contribute to ARFID pathogenesis.

11. The Gut–Brain–Behavior Cascade: A Self-Perpetuating Model in
Autism Spectrum Disorder

When considering all the aspects mentioned above, a compelling pattern emerges.
Research shows that individuals with ASD experience FS and ARFID significantly more
often than the NT population. Their selective and limited diet reduces gut microbiota
diversity [123,124]. Furthermore, an imbalanced gut microbial flora can intensify autistic
behaviors. This creates a cycle—ASD symptoms can contribute to the development of
ARFID, which leads to microbiota degradation, further exacerbating ASD symptoms and
creating a self-reinforcing loop. (Figure 5).

Nutrients 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 29   metagenome sequencing allows for more precise information, such as information at the species level. Ye and colleagues found that the richness of microbial species (Chao1 index) was greater in healthy children, while the diversity of microbial species (Shannon index and Simpson index) was higher in the ARFID group. The microbial composition diﬀered between groups, with the HC group characterized by enrichment of Actinobacteriota and its hierarchical taxa (class Actinobacteria, order Biﬁdobacteriales, family Biﬁdobacteriaceae, and genus Biﬁdobacterium). Conversely, the ARFID group showed elevated levels of both Enterobacterales (including family Enterobacteriaceae) and Bacteroidaceae (including genus Bacteroides and species B. vulgatus) [36] (Figure 4).  Figure 4. Children with ARFID exhibited higher microbial diversity but lower species richness compared to healthy children. Their gut microbiota showed increased levels of potentially harmful bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides vulgatus, which have mixed eﬀects on gut health—both reducing inﬂammation in some contexts and promoting inﬂammatory bowel disorders in others [36,118–121]. In contrast, beneﬁcial Biﬁdobacterium species, known for supporting gut health, were signiﬁcantly reduced in the ARFID group [122]. Analysis of the ARFID group revealed alterations in their gut bacterial composition. These changes followed two concerning pa(cid:308)erns: an increase in potentially harmful bacteria and a decrease in beneﬁcial ones. The increased bacteria included members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which are well-known for their pathogenic associations [118]. Another increased species was Bacteroides vulgatus, which shows complex eﬀects on gut health. While Bacteroides species generally beneﬁt gut health by producing short-chain fa(cid:308)y acids (SCFAs) [119], B. vulgatus speciﬁcally has shown contradictory eﬀects: it can both reduce inﬂammation in some conditions [120] and promote inﬂammatory bowel disorders in others [121]. Concurrent with these increases, ARFID patients showed markedly reduced levels of beneﬁcial Biﬁdobacterium species. Given Biﬁdobacterium’s established role in immune regulation, inﬂammation control, and potential anti-aging eﬀects [122], this bacterial proﬁle suggests a dysbiotic state that may contribute to ARFID pathogenesis. 11. The Gut–Brain–Behavior Cascade: A Self-Perpetuating Model in Autism Spectrum Disorder When considering all the aspects mentioned above, a compelling pa(cid:308)ern emerges. Research shows that individuals with ASD experience FS and ARFID signiﬁcantly more often than the NT population. Their selective and limited diet reduces gut microbiota diversity [123,124]. Furthermore, an imbalanced gut microbial ﬂora can intensify autistic Nutrients 2025, 17, 486

Figure 5. A self-perpetuating cycle links ASD symptoms, ARFID development, and gut microbiota
degradation. Sensory processing issues in ASD, such as atypical sensory modulation and oral over-
sensitivity, drive food selectivity and neophobia, increasing ARFID prevalence [39]. ARFID disrupts
gut microbiota, reducing beneficial species like Bifidobacterium and increasing harmful bacteria like
Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides vulgatus [36]. This dysbiosis affects the gut–brain axis through neural,
endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways, exacerbating ASD symptoms via neuroinflammation,
altered neurotransmitter production, and heightened stress responses [97,98,125–127].

The gut–brain axis is a bidirectional communication system connecting the gastroin-
testinal tract and central nervous system through neural, endocrine, and immune pathways.
Recent research shows that gut health significantly influences brain function and behavior,
particularly in neurodevelopmental conditions like ASD [128].

The gastrointestinal tract contains its own nervous system called the enteric nervous
system (ENS) [129,130], often known as the “second brain”, which communicates with the
brain primarily through the vagus nerve. The ENS consists of millions of neurons that
control digestive functions [131], while the vagus nerve provides bidirectional commu-
nication through sensory and motor fibers [88], allowing the gut and brain to exchange
information about mechanical changes, hormone levels, and various other physiological
signals [132,133]. Gut dysbiosis may worsen or induce ASD symptoms through multiple
biological mechanisms and metabolic pathways.

The endocrine pathway connects ASD and the gut–brain axis through hormone
secretion from enteroendocrine cells (EECs) [134,135]. These cells produce serotonin,
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and peptide YY (PYY), affecting brain function and be-
havior [89,90,136]. While gut-produced serotonin cannot cross the blood–brain barrier,
it influences mood and social behavior through peripheral systems [136–140]. The gut
microbiota affects serotonin production by regulating tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1)
enzyme. GLP-1 and PYY signal the brain via the vagus nerve, impacting appetite and
feeding [89]. Disrupted endocrine signaling from altered gut microbiota may influence
ASD behaviors and feeding patterns.

The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, another key pathway, is affected by
gut microbiota changes [91]. Dysbiosis leads to heightened stress responses with elevated
cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels [141,142]. Research with germ-
free mice shows that lacking gut microbiota causes exaggerated HPA stress responses [143].
This chronic HPA activation can worsen anxiety, cognitive function, and stress responses in
ASD individuals.

This creates a cycle—ASD symptoms can contribute to the development of ARFID, which leads to microbiota degradation, further exacerbating ASD symptoms and creating a self-reinforcing loop. (Figure 5).  Figure 5. A self-perpetuating cycle links ASD symptoms, ARFID development, and gut microbiota degradation. Sensory processing issues in ASD, such as atypical sensory modulation and oral over-sensitivity, drive food selectivity and neophobia, increasing ARFID prevalence [39]. ARFID disrupts gut microbiota, reducing beneﬁcial species like Biﬁdobacterium and increasing harmful bacteria like Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides vulgatus [36]. This dysbiosis aﬀects the gut–brain axis through neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways, exacerbating ASD symptoms via neuroinﬂammation, altered neurotransmi(cid:308)er production, and heightened stress responses [97,98,125–127]. The gut–brain axis is a bidirectional communication system connecting the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system through neural, endocrine, and immune pathways. Recent research shows that gut health signiﬁcantly inﬂuences brain function and behavior, particularly in neurodevelopmental conditions like ASD [128]. The gastrointestinal tract contains its own nervous system called the enteric nervous system (ENS) [129,130], often known as the “second brain”, which communicates with the brain primarily through the vagus nerve. The ENS consists of millions of neurons that control digestive functions [131], while the vagus nerve provides bidirectional communication through sensory and motor ﬁbers [88], allowing the gut and brain to exchange information about mechanical changes, hormone levels, and various other physiological signals [132,133]. Gut dysbiosis may worsen or induce ASD symptoms through multiple biological mechanisms and metabolic pathways. The endocrine pathway connects ASD and the gut–brain axis through hormone secretion from enteroendocrine cells (EECs) [134,135]. These cells produce serotonin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and peptide YY (PYY), aﬀecting brain function and behavior [89,90,136]. While gut-produced serotonin cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, it inﬂuences mood and social behavior through peripheral systems [136–140]. The gut microbiota aﬀects serotonin production by regulating tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) enzyme. GLP-1 and PYY signal the brain via the vagus nerve, impacting appetite and feeding [89]. Disrupted endocrine signaling from altered gut microbiota may inﬂuence ASD behaviors and feeding pa(cid:308)erns. The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, another key pathway, is aﬀected by gut microbiota changes [91]. Dysbiosis leads to heightened stress responses with elevated Nutrients 2025, 17, 486

Furthermore, altered gut microbiota can lead to immune system modulation resulting
in neuroinflammation [92]. The gut microbiota influences the development and function of
microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells [93]. Dysbiosis leads to decreased maturity and
function of microglia in a mouse model [144], contributing to neuroinflammation associated
with ASD [98].

Microbial metabolites provide another gut–brain communication pathway. SCFAs

produced by gut bacteria are the most often mentioned in the context of ASD.

High propionate levels correlate with ASD-like behaviors in rodent studies, affecting
neural organization and behavior [145]. On the contrary, increasing butyrate levels may
improve social interactions and decrease repetitive behaviors [146]. Sodium butyrate
additionally decreases neuroinflammation [147,148].

SCFAs additionally influence neuroplasticity and neurogenesis by modulating neu-
rotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor
(NGF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) [149,150].

SCFAs also maintain blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity through tight-junction protein

regulation, as demonstrated in studies with germ-free mice [94–96].

GF mice present numerous social deficits, like reluctance towards new relationships
and avoiding contact with unknown mice. They spend significantly more time on repetitive
behaviors like self-grooming. Hence, they are often treated as ASD mouse models and used
to assess intestinal microbiome impact on behavior [124].

Research on them [114] shows that transplanting fecal microflora from ASD donors
to GF mice induced autistic behavior, specifically increased repetitive behavior, decreased
locomotion, and communication, compared to mice with NT donors microbiota. This is
further confirmed by Xiao et al. [151], who performed a similar experiment, where mice
seeded with ASD microbiota presented more autistic-like behaviors.

In a mouse model of ASD induced by maternal Poly(I:C), alterations in gut microbiota
composition and increased levels of the microbial 4EPS are observed in offspring, which can
induce anxiety-like behaviors. Supplementing these offspring with the human commensal
Bacteroides fragilis improved gut permeability, reduced anxiety-like and repetitive behaviors,
and decreased 4EPS levels [115]. The effects of gut microbiota on eating behavior and ASD
symptoms are summarized in Table 2.

This self-perpetuating cycle highlights the deep connection between feeding disor-
ders, gut health, and ASD symptoms. While no direct research has confirmed this cyclic
relationship in its entirety, analysis of each individual step reveals this pattern. Further
research is needed to fully understand these connections and to confirm the findings from
animal models. There is a lack of specific evidence for alterations in sensory–sensitivity
being modulated by gut microbiota, but there are multiple mechanisms allowing the gut
microbiome to influence the host’s brain development and function.

Breaking this cycle requires a holistic approach with interventions targeting each
stage. To address ASD symptoms that contribute to ARFID, behavioral strategies can be
employed. To manage ARFID and its effects on the microbiota, implementing specific
dietary recommendations can help ensure balanced nutrition and support gut health.
Restoring microbiota balance and alleviating ASD symptoms may involve the use of
probiotics and regular physical activity. Together, these interventions aim to improve
outcomes and overall well-being for individuals affected by both conditions.

12. Clinical Implications and Future Research Directions

Research suggests a complex relationship between ASD, selective eating disorders like
ARFID, and gut microbiota. Sensory oversensitivity in individuals with ASD often leads
to restrictive diets, which can reduce gut microbiota diversity. This, in turn, may impact
brain function through the gut–brain–microbiota axis, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of
gastrointestinal and behavioral challenges.

To address these challenges, multidisciplinary therapeutic approaches that emphasize
nutrition could improve both gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms in individuals
with ASD.

A multidisciplinary approach should prioritize psycho-educational and therapeutic
activities, such as behavioral strategies, that engage both the patient and their parents.
Behavioral treatment strategies are based on the combination of adjustments to the mealtime
setup, attitude management, and caregiver training. Behavior management procedures
are planned to enhance adaptive behaviors and decrease maladaptive behaviors [166]. A
commonly used method is also a simple mixing of preferred and non-preferred food [154].
The goal of all these programs is to reduce challenging behaviors and expand the variety
and quantity of foods children accept, minimizing nutritional risks. Ismail et al. emphasize
that parents play a crucial role in ensuring their children receive sufficient nutrition [167].
Parental perceptions of their child’s nutritional status, particularly diet quality, are shaped
by a variety of social, biological, economic, and psychological factors. Parents who realize

Nutrients 2025, 17, 486

17 of 28

and indicate concern about their child’s unhealthy weight are often more motivated to
improve the family’s diet and effectively manage the child’s eating and physical activity
habits. Tan et al. highlight that parental strategies to enhance food acceptance in children
typically involve offering a variety of meals at home, regularly introducing new and similar
foods, providing positive reinforcement, and modeling healthy eating behaviors [168].
However, practices such as controlling food intake, pressuring the child to eat, restricting
portions, or using rewards can negatively impact mealtime behavior. The study also
suggests that parents often experience heightened emotional responses during mealtimes,
which can influence how they interact with their children.

In the future, a multidisciplinary approach could consider incorporating dietary and
supplementation-based treatments. However, evidence supporting the effectiveness of
specific diets, such as the anti-inflammatory or ketogenic diets, is currently limited.

In the case of the anti-inflammatory diet, its potential relevance stems from the elevated
levels of oxidative stress and inflammation observed in individuals with ASD, which are
thought to play a key role in the disorder’s pathogenesis [169]. These processes are closely
interconnected, as inflammatory responses can induce oxidative stress and mitochondrial
dysfunction. This interaction can amplify oxidative damage, creating negative feedback that
disrupts brain development and functioning and potentially contributes to the development
of neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD. Plant-based antioxidants such as carotenoids,
phenolics, flavonoids, and vitamins are known for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant,
and immune-boosting properties. Thus, an antioxidant-rich diet can help reduce issues
associated with ASD by decreasing the harmful effects of Reactive Oxygen Species. These
nutrients may support neurological and gastrointestinal health, helping to improve food
tolerance and potentially alleviate sensory sensitivities and food neophobia [170].

The ketogenic diet (KD), on the other hand, has limited evidence suggesting it may
reduce bacterial dysbiosis and promote BDNF levels, as noted by Allan et al. [171]. They
observed a reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β
and IL-12p70, in the plasma of ASD patients after following the KD. They also noted a
significant reduction in plasma levels of BDNF, a key factor involved in neuroinflammation
in the central nervous system that has been previously associated with ASD. The KD
demonstrated a positive effect on gut microbiota, enhancing diversity and promoting a
more balanced composition. These results indicate improved gut health and a reduction in
the pathogenic potential of gut microbes. During KD, there is an increased level of ketone
bodies, like β-hydroxybutyrate, which can cross the BBB and may have neuroprotective
effects resulting in behavioral improvement in children with ASD. The precise mechanism
by which gut flora interact with liver-derived ketone bodies remains unclear. Interest-
ingly, the gut-derived short-chain fatty acid butyrate shares structural similarities with
β-hydroxybutyrate and has been proposed as a potential supplement for ASD. However,
the effectiveness of such a regimen raises concerns, particularly in cases of increased ARFID,
which may result in nutritional deficiencies. A strict KD would require careful oversight
by a dietitian to ensure adequate intake of nutrients like iron and amino acids, preventing
potential worsening of the condition in ASD patients due to non-adherence. Additionally,
there is insufficient evidence on the long-term effects of this diet, and no current studies con-
clusively support its recommendation. The KD can cause side effects [172]. Most of them
are manageable with careful monitoring, particularly in the initial weeks. Common issues
include hypoglycemia, dyslipidemia, gastrointestinal symptoms, carnitine deficiency, bone
conditions (e.g., osteopenia, osteoporosis), nephrolithiasis, and growth delays, requiring
close supervision in pediatric cases. Rare complications, such as pancreatitis, prolonged QT
intervals, and transient vascular changes, have also been reported. Long-term studies in

Nutrients 2025, 17, 486

children with epilepsy on KD highlight potential risks to bone health, including increased
fractures and reduced bone mineral density.

Given the role of the microbiota in ASD, therapeutic approaches extend beyond dietary
interventions. Dysbiosis of the microbiota can also be directly targeted with probiotics.
Probiotic intake has been shown to benefit health by promoting positive changes in gut
microbiota, and studies suggest that probiotic interventions in children with ASD may
be a valuable complementary therapy for symptom relief [173,174]. Kwak et al. suggest
that modulating the gut microbiome with psychobiotics—probiotics known to positively
affect neurological function and hold potential for treating psychiatric conditions—offers
a promising therapeutic approach for ASD [175]. Psychobiotic strains commonly belong
to the Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria families. In ASD, the gut microbial composition is
significantly altered, with differences in the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio and reduced
levels of Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia compared to neurotypical children. These micro-
bial communities are integral to the production of substances such as SCFAs, which have
key neurobiological roles in the microbiota–gut–brain axis, and 4-ethylphenylsulfate, a
tyrosine metabolite implicated in ASD-like behaviors. Liu et al.’s analysis reveals probiotic
interventions with Lactobacillus plantarum have been explored in the Taiwanese popula-
tion. The Taiwanese study involved a one-month treatment with over 70 children and
pre-adolescents, showing some symptom improvements, though none were statistically
significant. Longer treatments, however, demonstrated significant benefits in reducing
irritability, stereotyped behaviors, and hyperactivity. Despite these promising results, the
studies were limited by small sample sizes and a lack of analysis of baseline gut microbiota
composition [176]. The main limitation of the impact of probiotics is that there are not
many studies available on the impact of long-term supplementation. In addition, the risks
involved have not been clearly proven so far. Although research is limited, probiotics are
suspected to have a beneficial effect in alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals
with ASD.

Such a small amount of evidence does not allow the transfer, at this point, of the
realities of research to the daily lives of patients. From a nutrition and diet perspective,
attention should also be paid to the potential role of physical activity, which occupies
an essential place in the nutritional pyramid. Regular physical activity is essential for
individuals with ASD as it not only enhances physical health but also improves behavioral
outcomes [177]. Due to a higher prevalence of sedentary lifestyles among this population,
which contributes to obesity and related health issues, promoting active lifestyles is crucial.
Both children and adults with ASD often encounter challenges such as difficulties in social
interaction, communication impairments, and a tendency towards inactivity. Engaging in
regular physical exercise can help alleviate these challenges by enhancing motor skills, im-
proving social interactions, and reducing anxiety and behavioral problems [178]. Research
has shown that activities like swimming, horseback riding, and structured group exercises
significantly improve social skills, communication, and motor coordination [179]. Addi-
tionally, exercise can decrease problem behaviors such as repetitive actions and self-injury
by promoting relaxation and increasing the release of neurotransmitters like endorphins
and dopamine, which enhance brain function [180]. Incorporating physical activity into
the daily routine of individuals with ASD requires understanding their preferences and
providing appropriate motivation. Tailoring activities to individual interests can increase
participation and enjoyment, thereby maximizing the benefits of exercise [181].

Overall, there is increasing evidence supporting the role of dietary interventions in
improving gastrointestinal symptoms in children with ASD. However, more research is
needed before such data can be used as formal guidelines. New studies, ideally randomized
or cross-sectional, should focus on children with similar, preferably significant, ARFID and

Nutrients 2025, 17, 486

19 of 28

subject them to the described interventions. Studies should include different age groups to
capture developmental differences; gender-specific analyses are also recommended due
to potential gender-dependent differences in microbiota composition. Methodologically,
research should employ advanced techniques like 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomics
while controlling for confounding factors such as baseline diet or medication use. Practical
challenges such as parental adherence, cultural dietary practices, and socioeconomic con-
straints must be addressed through caregiver training and psychoeducational programs.
Additionally, the long-term impact of these interventions must be evaluated, alongside
the monitoring of peripheral blood concentrations of vitamins, minerals, inflammatory
markers, and bone status through X-rays. Even with such studies, challenges related to the
nature of ASD and research rigor will remain. Therefore, these studies should be conducted
over an extended period, at least one year, and involve multiple centers.

13. Limitations and Strengths

Our review faces several limitations, most notably the lack of a systematic approach,
which impacts the robustness of the findings. This is a relatively new and emerging field of
research, and as such, the limitations often stem from the exploratory nature of the studies
conducted so far. A key issue is the heterogeneity of the data, with many studies involving
small sample sizes, focusing on specific populations (e.g., single ethnicities or regions), or
relying heavily on parental reports, which can introduce subjective bias and reduce the
generalizability of the results. Additionally, much of the mechanistic understanding is
derived from animal models, which may not fully translate to human conditions. Incon-
sistent findings regarding gut microbiota composition in individuals with ASD further
complicate interpretations, reflecting methodological differences across studies. The pre-
dominance of cross-sectional research, rather than longitudinal studies, also limits our
ability to establish temporal relationships or causality between ASD symptoms, ARFID, and
gut dysbiosis. Evidence for therapeutic interventions, including dietary modifications and
probiotics, remains limited, with the long-term effects of approaches such as ketogenic or
anti-inflammatory diets still unclear. Moreover, many proposed mechanisms, particularly
those linking sensory sensitivities in ASD to microbiota alterations, lack robust validation.
The variability in microbiota analysis techniques and reliance on parental observations
further introduce biases related to family dynamics and reporting accuracy, hindering
comparability and synthesis of results. To establish definitive causal relationships within
the proposed cycle and determine the impact of specific interventions, further research,
particularly with more standardized methodologies and larger, more diverse sample sizes,
is essential.

The strengths of this study lie in its holistic approach, offering a thorough exploration
of the complex relationships between ASD, eating challenges, gastrointestinal symptoms,
and gut microbiota. By integrating these diverse aspects, the paper provides a valuable and
insightful perspective on how they are interconnected. A significant strength is the intro-
duction of a novel conceptual framework, which illustrates the bidirectional relationships
where ASD symptoms worsen ARFID, leading to changes in gut microbiota that, in turn,
exacerbate ASD symptoms. The study also offers valuable therapeutic insights, discussing
a variety of strategies, including behavioral interventions, parental involvement, dietary
modifications, and the potential of emerging treatments like probiotics and psychobiotics.
Because of that, it offers practical recommendations for multidisciplinary approaches to
improve outcomes for individuals with ASD. Additionally, the study seeks to identify
important gaps in current research, suggesting key areas for future investigation.

While our review focuses on exploring dietary patterns, gastrointestinal symptoms,
and the composition of the gut microbiota in children diagnosed with ASD, Schneider

Nutrients 2025, 17, 486

20 of 28

et al. [182] have addressed a related topic within the context of ARFID. Their conceptual
model of the microbiota–gut–brain axis provides valuable insights into how restrictive
eating behaviors can influence gut microbiota diversity and, in turn, affect psychological
and physiological processes.

Both reviews highlight the significant role of dietary selectivity in shaping gut micro-
biota and its potential implications for gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms. However,
ASD-specific factors, such as heightened sensory sensitivities, distinguish the challenges
faced by this population. These sensitivities often lead to selective eating patterns that
exacerbate nutritional deficiencies and uniquely impact gut microbiota composition. We
observe some shared conclusions by comparing findings, particularly regarding the bidi-
rectional relationship between diet and the gut–brain axis. Nonetheless, our review places
greater emphasis on how the specific characteristics of ASD, including sensory-related
food selectivity, contribute to these interactions, aiming to complement and build upon the
insights provided by Schneider et al. [182].

14. Conclusions

ASD is closely linked to dietary selectivity, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and gut
microbiota alterations, forming a self-perpetuating cycle that impacts both physical and
behavioral health. The interplay between ASD symptoms, ARFID, and gut dysbiosis
highlights the crucial role of the gut–brain axis in neurodevelopmental disorders. While
evidence suggests that dietary interventions, probiotics, and behavioral strategies can
improve symptoms, further research is needed to establish standardized therapeutic ap-
proaches. A multidisciplinary strategy addressing both dietary and gut health is essential
for optimizing outcomes and improving the quality of life for individuals with ASD.
