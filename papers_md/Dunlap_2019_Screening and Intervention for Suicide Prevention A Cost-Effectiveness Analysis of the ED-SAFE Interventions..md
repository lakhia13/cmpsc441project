Abstract

Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States and imposes substantial 
economic costs. Studies suggest that suicide screening followed by an intervention may be 
effective at identifying suicidal individuals and preventing recurring self-harm, but few cost-
effectiveness studies have been conducted to determine whether the increased costs of screening 
and intervention are justified by improvements in patient outcomes. This study provides a cost-
effectiveness analysis of universal screening plus intervention implemented within a hospital

emergency department (ED) to prevent suicides and reduce self-harm behavior. Participants 
(n=1,339) were recruited in eight EDs located across the United States between August 2010 
and November 2013. The participating EDs ranged from small community hospitals to large 
academic center hospitals, and these sites sequentially implemented two study interventions—
universal screening combined with treatment as usual and universal screening plus intervention—
that were compared to treatment as usual. Our study demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of these 
interventions, relative to treatment as usual, in detecting and reducing suicide acts 12 months 
post ED visit. Costs of implementing universal screening plus intervention were $1,063 per 
participant, approximately $500 more per participant than universal screening with treatment as 
usual. Although more costly, universal screening plus intervention was more effective relative to 
universal screening and treatment as usual for the suicide outcome. While the choice of universal 
screening plus intervention depends on the value placed on the outcome by decision makers, our 
results suggest that there could be potential for significant cost savings in implementing such 
suicide prevention measures.

INTRODUCTION

Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States and imposes substantial 
economic costs with estimates associated with suicide and suicide attempts around $95 
billion annually (1–2). This substantial social and economic toll has prompted calls for 
more research and intervention to help prevent suicide and self-harm behaviors. Attention 
has been focused on emergency departments (EDs) as a currently underutilized location for 
suicide prevention efforts 3–4). In the United States, approximately 500,000 suicide-related 
visits to the ED occur annually and up to 25% of individuals presenting for suicide attempts 
in the ED will make another attempt (5–6).

Few studies have examined screening and intervention as a suicide prevention (7, 8, 9, 
10, 11), and findings from these studies suggest that screening and follow-up interventions 
may be effective and/or cost-effective relative to usual care. For example, Denchev and 
colleagues estimated the expected cost-effectiveness of three outpatient interventions (i.e., 
follow-up postcards and care letters, follow-up telephone outreach, and suicide-focused 
cognitive behavioral therapy) to reduce suicide risk among individuals presenting at hospital 
EDs relative to usual care. They found each of these interventions to be cost-effective 
relative to usual care, assuming a willingness to pay ≥$50,000 per life year. This study 
aims to add to the knowledge base by analyzing the cost-effectiveness of suicide screening 
and intervention implemented as part of a larger suicide prevention study— the Emergency 
Department Safety Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation (ED-SAFE) study.

ED-SAFE STUDY DESIGN

Participants in the ED-SAFE study were recruited in eight general EDs across seven U.S. 
states from August 2010 through November 2013 (12). The participating EDs ranged from

small community hospitals to large academic center hospitals (13). The sites were randomly 
assigned to one of four cohorts with each cohort assigned to a different start date from 
which they progressed through three study phases sequentially. The three phases included: 
treatment-as-usual (Phase 1); universal screening (Phase 2); and universal screening + 
intervention (Phase 3).

In the treatment as usual phase, participants were screened and treated per the ED’s existing 
suicide-related protocols to establish a study baseline and comparison group. In the universal 
screening phase, a universal screening protocol for suicidality was implemented by ED 
nurses. The universal screen, the Patient Safety Screener-3 (PSS-3), was a 3-item measure 
that assessed depressed mood, active suicidal ideation in the past two weeks, and lifetime 
suicide attempt (12).

In the universal screening + intervention phase, screening was enhanced by adding an 
assessment of the level of suicide risk through a physician-led secondary suicide risk 
assessment for patients who screened positive on the PSS-3. The intervention included 
the provision of a self-administered personal safety plan (a structured tool to identify early 
warning signs for suicidal behavior and internal and external coping resources) mental 
health treatment information and suicide hotline resources at ED discharge. Following 
discharge, universal screening + intervention phase participants were contacted through a 
series of telephone calls. These intervention telephone calls were based on the Coping Long 
Term with Active Suicide Program (CLASP) protocol and modified for use with ED patients 
(14). CLASP-ED telephone calls were provided by a centralized team of psychologists 
and counselors which served all eight EDs. Each participant who screened as needing the 
intervention was eligible to receive up to seven telephone sessions while a participant’s 
significant other or family member was eligible to receive up to four telephone sessions. 
These sessions were spread out over the course of one year. The sessions evaluated current 
suicide and psychological status and reviewed the patient safety plan (12).

Study participants were enrolled in the ED-SAFE study by research assistants at each 
ED site. Individuals with any level of harm ideation or behavior upon entry to the ED 
were eligible to be approached for study inclusion. Across all phases, 1,376 participants 
were enrolled of which 1,339 had sufficiently complete data to be included in the cost-
effectiveness analysis. Only 3% of enrolled participants were excluded due to missing data 
which was proportionally distributed over the three phases.

METHODS

Cost Estimates

Screening and intervention costs were calculated from the provider perspective (i.e., the 
hospital ED) to provide critical information to entities evaluating whether they should 
expand suicide prevention services. We worked with the study’s clinical staff, from 
December 2011 to June 2016, to identify clinical activities typically performed as part of 
the screening and intervention. The economic study was deemed not human subject research 
and waived by IRB. We did not include costs incurred by other entities or costs incurred by 
patients (e.g., travel costs). We also did not include costs associated with research activities

since these activities were not part of real-world clinical care. We used a micro-costing 
approach and collected cost data at the activity level from each site for each study phase. 
This information was collected through two telephone interviews with each site’s principal 
investigator, other ED administrative staff or research assistants as needed, and supervisory 
staff performing the CLASP-ED component.

Data on resources used to perform the activities were combined with price data such as 
hourly wages and rents to produce a total unit cost estimate for each activity. Hourly wages 
and other salary data were collected for each staff type and, if a specific staff wage was 
not available, we used the mean hourly wage for that staff type from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics Wage Data by Metropolitan Area (http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oessrcma.htm) 
adjusted to 2015 U.S. dollars using the Consumer Price Index. Space costs were estimated 
using an average rental rate for medical and hospital office space where each site was 
located as obtained from real estate listing found on LoopNet (www.loopnet.com) and 
cross-referenced with findings from the Newmark Grubb Knight Frank National Office 
Market Report (15).

The activities performed for each patient were multiplied by the estimated unit cost for each 
activity to produce a cost per patient by site and phase. The quantity of activities performed 
for each patient was tracked as part of the ED-SAFE study through chart reviews of the 
patient’s index ED visit. Summing across patients within a phase and site yields the total 
cost of the phase at a site. We then calculated the average across sites to get an average cost 
for each phase at the site level. All costs are calculated in 2015 U.S. dollars (2015 $).

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

Effectiveness Measures (Screening and suicide outcomes)—Screening outcomes 
measures for the cost-effectiveness analysis included percentage of ED patients screened for 
suicide risk and percentage of ED patients who screened positive for suicide risk. These 
measures were developed using screening data from the study’s screening log database 
that included nearly 250,000 patients entering the eight ED sites during each phase of the 
ED-SAFE study. For each site, the percentage of ED patients screened was calculated by 
dividing the number of screened patients at the ED site by the total number of patients 
entering the ED site during the relevant phase. Because the universal screening approach 
was the same in the universal screening and universal screening + intervention phases, the 
percentage of clients screened was averaged across these two phases to calculate a single 
value for percentage of patients screened for each site that was compared to each site’s 
treatment as usual screening percentage. A similar calculation was done for the percentage 
of patients who screened positive.

Suicide outcome measures included a suicide composite measure that included any suicide 
attempts or death by suicide over the 12 months following the index ED visit (14). This 
measure was operationalized as patient-level counts of the number of suicidal acts over the 
12-month period following the index ED visit.

Following the methodology used in the study’s main suicide outcome paper, we calculated 
predicted values for the number of suicidal acts with a negative binomial model to account

for over-dispersion in the outcome (16). Each model included categorical variables for study 
phase, and dichotomous variables for ED site. The model also included several patient-level 
variables representing patient demographics and baseline status (16).

Cost-Effectiveness—Separate cost-effectiveness analyses were performed to compare 
the three phases across the screening and suicide outcome effectiveness measures. In 
each case, we calculated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) which combined 
differences in cost and effect between the phases (17). We first ranked the phases in 
increasing order of average cost. The ICER was then computed as the difference in average 
cost divided by the difference in average effectiveness.

For the screening measures, we examined use of a universal screen relative to treatment as 
usual. We divided the ED sites into two groups—those sites without any screen prior to 
the study (n = 4) and those sites with an informal, non-universal screen prior to the study 
(n = 4) and conducted separate cost-effectiveness analyses for each group. This allowed us 
to examine the cost-effectiveness for going from no screening to universal screening and 
going from an informal non-universal screen to universal screening. An informal screen 
was defined as using a set of non-standardized questions to determine suicidal ideation or 
behavior, and, therefore, these screens were not equivalent to universal screening. Costs used 
for these analyses were the average screening costs per month per site.

For the suicide outcome measure, we examined universal screening + intervention relative to 
universal screening and treatment as usual with all eight ED sites included in the analysis. 
For these analyses, we used total phase costs per patient.

Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curves—We calculated a cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curve (CEAC) to show the probability that a given phase is the cost-
effective option as a function of a decision maker’s willingness to pay (WTP) for the 
suicide composite outcome. The CEAC incorporates the joint variability of the cost 
and effectiveness estimates and allows us to better capture the variability in our cost-
effectiveness analysis in lieu of confidence intervals for the ICERs (18–19). We used a 
nonparametric bootstrap method to calculate the CEAC that compares the phases for the 
suicide outcome measure.

Table 1 presents costs and outcomes associated with the addition of universal screening for 
four sites without a formal screen in the treatment as usual phase. As shown, the average 
percentage of patients screened substantially increased moving from treatment as usual to 
the universal screening —from 8% to 71% (p < 0.01). The percentage of patients screening 
positive for suicidality also increased from 3.3% to 6.8% (p < 0.05). The addition of 
universal screening was associated with an average increase in monthly site-level costs of 
$604 (p< 0.05). Taking the increase in costs ($604) over the change in screening rates (71% 
- 8%) yields an ICER of approximately $10 per one percentage point increase in monthly 
screening rate. Similarly, the ICER comparing universal screening to treatment as usual for

the percentage of patients who screen positive for suicidality was approximately $174 per 
percentage point increase in the rate of individuals who screen positive for suicidality.

Table 2 presents results for those ED sites that already had informal screening approaches 
prior to the implementation of universal screening. These sites increased their screening 
rates by 46 percentage points—from 37% to 83% (p < 0.10). They also increased the 
percentage of patients who screened positive by approximately 2 percentage points—from 
2.7% 4.8% (n.s.) The increase in costs is $215 (p < 0.10). For overall screening rates, 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for universal screening relative to treatment as usual is 
approximately $5 per one percentage point increase in monthly screening rate. For positive 
screens for suicidality, the ICER is approximately $106 per one percentage point increase in 
the rate of individuals who screen positive for suicidality.

The median participant age was 37 years with 56% women. Sixty-seven percent of 
participants were non-Hispanic White, 15% were non-Hispanic African American, 12% 
were Hispanic, and 5% identified as non-Hispanic other. Over 70% of the sample had a 
history of previous suicide attempts and over one-third had made an attempt in the week 
prior to the ED visit (16).

As shown in Table 3, the average per-patient costs for treatment as usual and the universal 
screening phase were estimated as $513 and $566 per month, respectively. Universal 
screening + intervention costs significantly more at $1,063 per patient per month (p < 0.01) 
with the addition of the telephone sessions driving this increase. The universal screening 
+ intervention phase is also more effective in averting suicide attempts and deaths by 
suicide relative to both universal screening and treatment as usual. Similarly, the universal 
screening phase is more costly but more effective relative to treatment as usual, although this 
cost difference is not statistically significant. Moving from treatment as usual to universal 
screening decreased the average number of averted suicide attempts and deaths by suicide 
by approximately 0.02 (0.454–0.435, n.s.), increased cost of $53 (n.s.) and yielded an ICER 
of $2,789 per averted suicide attempt or death by suicide over the 12 months post-ED visit. 
Moving from universal screening to universal screening + intervention further decreased 
suicide attempts and deaths by 0.099 (0.435–0.336, p < 0.01), increased costs by $497 (p < 
0.01), yielding an ICER of $5020 per averted suicide attempt or death by suicide (see online 
Appendix 2 for incremental scatterplots).

Figure 1 includes the CEACs for the number of suicides attempts or death by suicide. The 
CEACs show the probability that a phase is cost effective relative to alternatives for a given 
willingness-to-pay amount. The treatment as usual and universal screening phases have the 
highest probability of being cost-effective for low willingness-to-pay values (< $5,000). 
However, once the willingness-to-pay amount is greater than $5,000, universal screening + 
intervention has the highest probability of being cost-effective and this probability is greater 
than 80% for willingness-to-pay values exceeding $6,000. If a decision maker is willing to

pay over $6,000 then the universal screening + intervention phase has the highest probability 
of being cost-effective and is their optimal choice.

DISCUSSION

Suicide detection and prevention efforts that target individuals presenting at EDs are a 
critical component in reducing suicide acts and death by suicide given the high number 
of suicide-related ED visits that occur annually in the United States. Understanding the 
cost-effectiveness of these services can aid in their implementation and dissemination as 
well as in the development of further suicide prevention efforts.

Implementing universal screening increased average costs between $215 and $604 dollars 
per month depending on whether the ED already had an informal screening process in 
place. However, with the increased use of universal screening the percentage of participants 
screened and the percentage of participants who screened positive for suicide risk increased. 
The calculated ICER shows that it costs about $106 to $174 per percentage point increase in 
the monthly screened positive rate.

These results suggest that universal screening may be a cost-effective screening intervention 
relative to treatment as usual. However, once a patient is positively identified with suicidal 
risk, a cost-effective treatment is needed. Universal screening + intervention showed a 
reduction in the per-person number of suicide attempts and death by suicide relative to 
treatment as usual and universal screening. The effectiveness study conducted in Miller et 
al. (15) showed that these results are statistically significant. However, this reduction comes 
at a cost, with universal screening + intervention per-participant costs almost double those 
of treatment as usual and universal screening. While universal screening + intervention costs 
more than treatment as usual and universal screening, the increased effectiveness suggests 
that universal screening + intervention may be more likely to be the optimal choice among 
these three alternatives. Our analysis shows that for willingness-to-pay values above $5,000 
per suicide attempt or death by suicide, universal screening + intervention has the highest 
probability of being the cost-effective choice.

For the suicide outcome with an estimated ICER of $5,020 per averted suicide attempt 
or death by suicide it is possible to illustrate the potential cost savings of the universal 
screening + intervention with existing literature. We focus on suicide attempts because, 
although deaths by suicide were captured in our data, they were a rare event within the 
study follow-up period. Shepard (2) estimates the annual cost of nonfatal attempted suicides 
in the United States at $5.34 billion (2015 dollars) with 395,000 suicide attempts officially 
reported annually. Calculating a per-person cost yields an estimate of $13,522 annually. 
Therefore, universal screening + intervention yields a cost savings of $8,497 per averted 
suicide attempt from a societal perspective ($13,522-$5,025). Based on the annual 395,000 
reported suicide attempts, if even just 25% of these attempts were averted each year through 
use of universal screening + intervention, society would benefit by cost savings of $839 
million annually. These results show that the combination of suicide screening in the ED and 
a post-ED intervention for those who screen positive provides both economic and clinical 
value to society (15).

Our study has a few limitations. First, we relied on the study PIs’ judgment as to which 
activities are primarily research-related and which would be used in best ED practice. 
Furthermore, study PIs provided data on labor time needed to complete activities in each 
phase rather than relying on time logs or other mechanisms for direct measurement as these 
approaches were deemed too burdensome for the ED staff. Second, we did not include 
all the costs associated with administrating a universal screening such as ongoing training 
and quality control measures (e.g., record checks). Finally, our analysis is conducted in the 
context of an ED; the effectiveness and cost estimates presented here are unlikely to apply in 
other clinical settings.

Despite these limitations, our study makes an important contribution to the literature by 
providing further economic evidence of the value of suicide screening and intervention in 
an ED setting. Our study demonstrates the potential cost-effectiveness of both universal 
screening and intervention relative to treatment as usual in detecting and reducing suicide 
acts at 12 months post-ED visit. While the choice of universal screening and intervention 
as an economically optimal intervention depends on the value placed on these outcomes by 
decision makers, our results suggest that there is the potential for significant societal cost 
savings in implementing such suicide prevention measures.

A universal screen for suicidality in emergency departments increases costs 
while increasing the percentage of patients identified at risk for suicide.

A universal screen combined with a telephone-based intervention with those 
at risk for suicide costs about 50% ($500) more per participant while reducing 
the number of suicide attempts and deaths about 10% (0.1) 12-months post 
ED.

Universal screening + intervention post ED discharge is likely to be cost-
effective if the willingness-to-pay is over $5,000 per averted suicide attempt 
or death.

Based on the annual 395,000 reported suicide attempts, if even just 25% of 
these attempts were averted each year through use of universal screening + 
intervention, society would benefit by cost savings of $839 million annually.
