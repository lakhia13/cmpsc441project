Abstract: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) involves deliberate and intentional injury to body
tissue that occurs in the absence of suicidal intent. Typical examples here might include self-
cutting, burning, or self-hitting. Behavior of this kind is fundamentally unsettling as well as
perplexing. It is also the case that self-harming behavior of any kind runs counter to a
fundamental survival instinct. In the past, behaviors such as these were viewed as self-
mutilation and considered to be a form of attenuated suicide. Much has changed over time,
culminating in the entry of NSSI Disorder into DSM-5 as a condition in need of further
study. In this review we describe the evolution of the NSSI construct and consider current
issues in its diagnosis and assessment.

Background
To begin to understand something, we must be able to identify and deﬁne it. Unless
terms and concepts are clear, scientiﬁc progress will naturally be slow. Over the last
20 years, the study of what we now call nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) has become
a topic of widespread interest. In this review, we trace the evolution of NSSI as an
independent clinical construct, highlighting recent developments in the conceptua-
lization of NSSI and drawing attention to the issues and challenges that remain.

Historical Perspective
Clinical interest in behaviors that involve intentional acts of self-injury dates back
to the 1930s and to the psychoanalyst Karl Menninger. Menninger used the term
self-mutilation, considering such acts to be a form of attenuated suicide.1 Following
this, in the early literature, all nonfatal and deliberate forms of self-injury were
viewed as suicide attempts, regardless of whether there was any expressed suicide
intent.2,3 Not everyone endorsed such an approach, however. Writing in 1969,
Kreitman, Philip, Greer, and Bagley noted that, “the great majority of patients so
designated are not in fact attempting suicide” (pp 746–7).4 Others complained that
the term ‘attempted suicide’ is now misapplied to acts with a wide variety of
intentions […], all of which are expressed in similar types of behavior, namely
acts of self-poisoning or self-injury. (pp. 31)5

Reinforcing this point, in 1983, Pattison and Kahan6 noted that not all self-
harming behaviors could be classiﬁed as suicidal; instead, they observed that many

people will intentionally cause physical harm and damage
to themselves without any intent to kill themselves.

In addition to debate about the motivation for self-
injurious acts,
the proliferation of descriptive terms to
describe self-destructive behaviors created confusion.7,8
Terms such as “parasuicide”,4 “self-injury”,5,9 delicate
self-cutting syndrome,10 and “deliberate self-harm” or
“non-fatal deliberate self-harm”11 have all been used to
describe self-injurious behaviors that did not result
in
death. This has been the case regardless of whether or
not suicide intent was reported.

In recent years, however, support has grown for a more
intent-based deﬁnition of suicidal behavior.12 In his widely
acclaimed 1987 book, Bodies Under Siege, Armando
Favazza13 described both historical and current manifesta-
tions of self-mutilation and set the stage for systematic
research on this topic. He also deﬁned self-mutilation as
“the deliberate destruction or alteration of one’s body
intent.” (see14 page
tissue without conscious suicidal
xviii). Although intent is difﬁcult to measure, recognition
of the importance of intent in the deﬁnition of suicide and
non-fatal suicidal behaviors has allowed the study of NSSI
to advance. More speciﬁcally it has facilitated the separa-
tion of self-injurious behavior (a broad and general cate-
gory) into suicidal behavior (which involves the presence
of at least some intent to die) and nonsuicidal self-injur-
ious behavior. In the latter case, there is no intent to die.

in some instances,

What Do We Mean By NSSI?
For a behavior to be classiﬁed as NSSI (according to both
Favazza’s deﬁnition and the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria) it
must be intentional and deliberate. Accidentally cutting
oneself is not NSSI. However,
the
role of intentionality can be challenging to establish. For
example, NSSI sometimes occurs during dissociative
episodes.15 If the person engages in NSSI when they are
detached from reality, can the NSSI be considered inten-
tional? Of course, if the motivation for self-injury in such
instances is to feel something, some degree of intention-
ality may perhaps be assumed. Nonetheless, the example
of self-injury occurring in the context of dissociation high-
lights the importance of developing a clearer deﬁnition for
intentionality to the extent that this is possible.

As we have noted and as the name itself suggests,
NSSI must also be nonsuicidal. Although there is intent
to self-injure, there is no intent to die. Additionally, as
currently conceptualized and as codiﬁed in the DSM-5
criteria, NSSI must be direct, meaning there should be

no intervening steps between the action and the injury.8
This excludes most forms of self-poisoning (with the
exception of swallowing something such as bleach that
burns mouth tissue) from being classiﬁed as NSSI.17
NSSI also does not include socially sanctioned behaviors.
For mainstream Western cultures, this restriction primarily
excludes behaviors such as body piercings and tattoos.
However, we need to recognize here that different cultures
sanction different body modiﬁcation
and subcultures
practices.16

The extent of bodily damage is also relevant. NSSI
involves a moderately intense injury.16 Use of the word
moderate, however, does not mean that the self-injury is of
little clinical concern. Most deﬁnitions include some var-
iant of “destruction of body tissue,” and the current DSM-
5 deﬁnition speciﬁes bleeding or bruising. The key point
here is that more minor and highly normative behaviors
such as lip-biting, scab-picking, and nail-biting are not
considered NSSI (although they are sometimes included
in assessment measures). Skin picking and hair pulling are
also excluded. When mild, these behaviors cause little
bodily damage. And when severe, a different and more
problem-speciﬁc diagnosis of skin excoriation disorder (in
the former case) or trichotillomania (in the latter case) may
be warranted. It should be noted, however, that the type of
behavior a person engages in does not invariably dictate
the degree of bodily damage that occurs. Severe damage
could, in theory, be caused by behavior that might other-
wise be considered mild and normative (eg, lip biting). In
such cases, this behavior might appropriately be consid-
ered to be NSSI.

In addition, major self-injury, such as might occur in
people with psychosis, is excluded from DSM-5 criteria.
Such behavior is infrequent (eg, once in a lifetime) and
involves extreme behaviors such as removing an eye or
severing a limb.8 Finally, NSSI must be distinguished from
the stereotypic self-injury that occurs in many develop-
mental disorders. Stereotypic self-injury (eg, repetitive
head-banging), often occurs at very high frequencies
(many times per hour). The behavior is ﬁxed and rhythmic
in nature.8 It also tends to serve functions distinct from
those reported among people who engage in NSSI. More
speciﬁcally, it is routinely performed in front of other
people and in the absence of shame and guilt.18 For
these reasons, stereotypic self-harming behaviors are not
considered NSSI.

The construct of NSSI has gained widespread accep-
tance in the USA, Europe, Australia, and many other parts

of the world. Nonetheless, some researchers continue to
advocate for combining all non-fatal self-injurious beha-
viors into one category of “self-harm.” Kapur et al19, for
example, have argued that naming these behaviors “NSSI”
is inaccurate given that they are highly comorbid with
suicidal behavior. They also note that it is relatively com-
mon for people who engage in self-harming behaviors
(such as self-poisoning) to report being ambivalent about
living or dying (also see20). This calls into question the
extent to which NSSI is indeed nonsuicidal. We consider
this next.

How Nonsuicidal Is NSSI?
By deﬁnition, NSSI must occur in the absence of suicidal
intent. Yet NSSI can hardly be considered entirely nonsuicidal.
NSSI and suicidal thoughts and behaviors frequently co-occur.
This has been noted in community and clinical samples, across
age groups, and across sexes (see21 for a review). In addition to
strong concurrent associations, NSSI longitudinally predicts
suicidal thoughts and behaviors and the strength of this rela-
tionship is as strong (or even stronger) than that observed for
suicidal thoughts and behaviors.22

It is also the case that many people engage in NSSI
behaviors while (at times) experiencing thoughts of sui-
cide, and even with a hope that they might die from these
behaviors. Nonetheless, suicidal thoughts and hopes for
death are markedly higher in suicidal behaviors so there
is a difference in degree.23,24 In addition, and reminiscent
of Menniger’s1 idea of attenuated suicide, there is evi-
dence that people may engage in NSSI as a way to avoid
acting on thoughts of suicide.25 Indeed, several studies
demonstrate that people may engage in NSSI to help
cope with, and prevent themselves from acting on, suicidal
thoughts.26–28 In other words, for some people, self-harm-
ing via NSSI may serve to regulate and reduce suicidal
thoughts and intentions. It is important to note, however,
that not everyone who engages in NSSI does so for this
reason, and the majority of people who engage in NSSI
report multiple functions for these behaviors.29

Together, this work highlights that NSSI and suicidal
thoughts and behaviors overlap in meaningful and non-
trivial ways. Despite these overlaps, we maintain that it is
still useful to categorize NSSI and suicidal behaviors as
distinct. Many people who engage in NSSI deny any cur-
rent or prior suicidal thoughts and behaviors.24 Similarly,
many people who report suicidal thoughts and behaviors do
not engage in NSSI behaviors. Indeed, most people enga-
ging in NSSI endorse using these behaviors to help regulate

emotion.29 Nonetheless, research seeking to understand the
overlap among these behaviors could shed light on why
these behaviors are comorbid, and could provide important
insights into both treatment and prevention.

Other Forms Of Self-Harming
Behaviors
NSSI is not the only way that people can hurt themselves.
Other behaviors, such as drinking too much alcohol, using
drugs and sharing needles, engaging in risky behaviors, or
engaging in disordered eating behaviors immediately come
to mind. Intentional poor medication adherence for a phy-
sical illness such as diabetes or heart disease could provide
a further example. As with NSSI, each of these behaviors
can cause physical harm, physical pain, and negative con-
sequences in both the short- and longer-term.

As stated earlier, NSSI requires direct and intentional
inﬂiction of harm, and the harm inﬂicted must occur
immediately after the behavior itself (eg, blood/wound
immediately after self-cutting).8 In the case of most indir-
ectly harmful behaviors, immediate personal harm is not a
primary motivator of the behavior, and any physical harm
and/or pain occurs downstream of the behavior itself. Yet
direct and indirect forms of self-injury often co-occur. For
example, nearly 25% of people who engage in NSSI report
disordered eating behaviors,30 and just over 25% of people
who are diagnosed with anorexia nervosa or bulimia ner-
vosa report comorbid NSSI.31 There is also evidence that
people report engaging in these eating disordered beha-
viors with some intent to cause physical harm – both in the
moment and in the longer-term.24 This is especially so for
those who engage in restrictive eating. On average, such
individuals report a greater desire to hurt themselves in the
longer-term via restrictive eating than do people who
engage in binge eating or who use other compensatory
behaviors. What this suggests is that traditionally deﬁned
“indirect” self-harming behaviors may have some directly
harmful intentions in common with NSSI.

Nonetheless, distinguishing between direct and indirect
forms of self-injury may be warranted. Although people
who engage in direct and indirect forms of self-harm
share many similarities,32,33 there are also some key differ-
ences. For example, St. Germain and Hooley32 compared
people who engaged in both NSSI and indirect forms of
self-harm with people who engaged in only indirect forms
of self-harm (e.g., disordered eating, substance abuse, stay-
ing in abusive relationships, reckless behaviors). Results

showed that those who engaged in both NSSI and indirectly
harmful behaviors reported higher levels of self-criticism
and increased suicide proneness compared to those who
engaged only in indirect forms of self-harm. Of course,
this single study involved only a relatively small sample
of participants and combined different forms of indirect
self-injury (eg, disordered eating, substance abuse, staying
in an abusive relationship, reckless behaviors) together.
More research is now needed to examine this issue in a
more systematic manner.

Especially valuable will be research that examines
whether and how people who engage in speciﬁc forms of
indirect self-injury differ from individuals who engage in
NSSI. As an illustration, researchers are now examining the
similarities and differences between individuals with disor-
dered eating and those who engage in NSSI.34 We also need
to know whether the extent of these differences varies
depending on the type of indirect self-injury examined.

The key point here is that self-injurious behaviors may
be better understood as lying on a spectrum rather than as
entirely distinct categories of behaviors. It is likely that
direct self-harming intentions differ across individuals and
even within individuals across time. Researchers and clin-
icians seeking to understand the motivations underlying
the broad spectrum of these behaviors may gain important
insights by asking questions about self-harming intentions
rather than automatically assuming their absence based on
the speciﬁc behavior or behaviors reported. For example,
some people who engage in indirectly self-injurious beha-
viors may fail to be recognized as being in need of treat-
ment for self-harming thoughts and behaviors because of
the assumptions that clinicians already have about
the
motivations for their behavior (eg, addiction, fear of gain-
ing weight, etc.). Work of this kind thus has implications
for access to treatment as well as the type of intervention
that a given individual may receive. It may also encourage
us to reevaluate (or perhaps re-afﬁrm) the boundaries of
what we currently consider to be NSSI.

for several

Why Are Deﬁnitions Important?
Deﬁnitional
reasons,
issues are important
including their impact on prevalence estimates. Most clin-
icians and NSSI researchers are primarily interested in
people who engage in what we have termed moderate
NSSI behaviors, particularly individuals who engage in
these behaviors frequently. Unfortunately, many NSSI stu-
dies, particularly those relying on self-report assessment
instruments, capture infrequent and minor NSSI behaviors.

This leads to inﬂated NSSI rates. For example, Lloyd-
Richardson et al35 found that 55 percent of an adolescent
community sample endorsed some form of NSSI behavior.
This was reduced to 27.7% when only moderate NSSI (eg,
self-cutting, burning) was considered, and fewer than 5%
of respondents endorsed engaging in moderate NSSI beha-
viors more than ﬁve times. Similarly, Tang et al36 found
that 33.6% of a large sample of Chinese adolescents
endorsed some kind of NSSI, but only 11.9% endorsed
moderate NSSI; fewer than 1% reported engaging in mod-
erate NSSI behaviors more than ﬁve times. These discre-
pancies in prevalence estimates highlight the importance
of having consensus deﬁnitions that map on to concep-
tually coherent and clinically meaningful behaviors. For
example, minor (ie, behaviors that cause mild pain and/or
temporary harm; picking at a scab) and moderate NSSI
appear to be qualitatively different phenomena. Compared
to minor NSSI, moderate NSSI tends to be associated with
greater psychopathology, as well as more psychiatric hos-
pitalizations, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts.35,37–39

Is NSSI A Symptom Or A Distinct
Clinical Condition?
NSSI has been included as a symptom of borderline per-
sonality disorder since personality disorders ﬁrst ofﬁcially
entered the DSM in 1980.40 Even today, many clinicians
and researchers continue to view NSSI in terms of border-
line personality disorder. However, within the past several
years this perception has been changing. Research has
demonstrated that NSSI is associated with a range of
internalizing, externalizing, and personality disorders, and
can even occur
in the absence of any psychiatric
diagnosis.41–43 In short, there is substantial evidence that
NSSI is distinct from borderline personality disorder and
all other psychiatric diagnoses. Reﬂecting this, NSSI dis-
order (NSSI-D) entered DSM-5 in 2013 as a Condition for
Further Study.44

NSSI-D In DSM-5
The diagnostic criteria for NSSI-D are summarized in
Table 1. Criterion A concerns the frequency and duration
of NSSI. More speciﬁcally, to meet the criterion, “inten-
tional self-inﬂicted damage”44 must have occurred on 5 or
more days over the past year. This threshold was based on
the idea that ﬁve or more acts of NSSI provided evidence
of a repetitive problem.45

Table 1 NSSI Disorder: Summary of Proposed Diagnostic Criteria*

A: Self-inﬂicted acts such as cutting, burning, or hitting intended to cause moderate physical damage to the body (e.g., bruising, bleeding, or pain)
occurring on 5 or more days over the past year.

B: Engagement in self-injurious behavior is done with the expectation that at least one of the following consequences will occur shortly afterwards:

1. Relief from negative feelings or thoughts.
2. Resolution of an interpersonal problem.

3. Creation of a positive mood state.

C: At least one of the following occurs immediately before the act of intentional self-injury:

1. Negative thoughts or feelings (eg, distress, depression, anger, anxiety, tension, or self-criticism).

2. Preoccupation with the planned self-injurious behavior that is hard to control.
3. Frequent thoughts of self-injurious behavior – even if no action is taken.

D: Socially sanctioned behavior such as tattooing or body piercing is excluded, as is self-inﬂicted damage that is enacted in a cultural or religious
context. Common and mild behaviors such as nail biting and scab picking are also excluded.

E: Engagement in nonsuicidal self-injury results in clinically signiﬁcant distress or causes problems in social or occupational functioning or
impairments in other important areas of life.

F: The self-damaging behavior cannot be better explained by another mental disorder or medical diagnosis. It is also required that the self-injurious
behavior not occur only during psychotic episodes, intoxication, periods of delirium, or be stereotyped and repetitive.

Note: *Based on DSM-537.

A key issue, however, is whether the threshold of ﬁve
NSSI days in the past year is too low to meaningfully
differentiate between clinical and subclinical groups of peo-
ple who engage in NSSI. Although many clinicians might
reasonably be concerned if a patient or client showed evi-
dence of NSSI behavior on ﬁve or more occasions over a
one-year period, NSSI researchers have noted that a higher
threshold might provide better separation between indivi-
duals meeting diagnostic criteria for NSSI-D and indivi-
duals who are subthreshold. For example, in a sample of
community adults, Andover46 found that those diagnosed
with NSSI-D engaged in NSSI on 86 days (mean fre-
quency) in the past year compared to only 6 days for
those who did not meet diagnostic criteria. A similar dis-
crepancy was noted by Washburn et al47 using a clinical
sample. In that study, the NSSI-D group engaged in NSSI
on an average of 76.8 days compared to a mean of 1.9 days
for the non-disordered group. Using a discriminant function
analysis approach with a large sample of adolescent inpa-
tients, Muehlenkamp et al47 identiﬁed 3 different groups.
An NSSI frequency of 25 or more days represented the
most severe group and a frequency of 5–24 days identiﬁed a
group with relatively less overall pathology compared to a
low frequency (1–4 days) group.

Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that raising the
frequency cut-off beyond that currently proposed in DSM-
5 may be warranted. Nevertheless, as Muehlenkamp et al48
threshold of 5 NSSI days may
also note,

the current

validly identify those in need of clinical attention. Early
intervention with such individuals might prevent
the
development of a more severe disorder with more asso-
suicidal
ciated psychopathology as well as greater
thoughts and plans. To the extent that this is the case, a
frequency of ﬁve acts or episodes of NSSI on at least 5
days over the past year may be both clinically meaningful
and give cause for concern.

Criterion B of NSSI-D in the DSM-5 requires that
individuals engage in NSSI for one or more of the follow-
ing reasons: (1) to obtain relief from a negative feeling or
cognitive state, (2) to resolve an interpersonal difﬁculty, or
(3) to induce a positive feeling state.44 Although most
individuals who engage in NSSI endorse at least one of
these three motivations,49,50 other motivations, including
self-punishment and coping with suicidal thoughts, are
neglected (for a meta-analysis and systematic review of
functions of NSSI, see29). Initial research further indicates
that most people endorse more than one NSSI function.51
Motivations for NSSI also tend to vary based on other
comorbid diagnoses that might be present (eg, posttrau-
matic stress disorder versus major depressive disorder).52
NSSI motivations may also vary over time as well as being
inﬂuenced by factors such as culture and race/ethnicity,
although research on this topic has not yet been conducted.
More broadly, is a focus on the motivations of NSSI
clinically informative? In other words, does Criterion B
help to differentiate individuals who do and do not meet

diagnostic criteria for NSSI-D? When comparing indivi-
duals who do and do not meet the frequency criterion for
NSSI-D across both college undergraduates and adolescent
and adult patients, Brausch et al51 found that the endorse-
ment of motivations for NSSI was present regardless of
NSSI frequency or the sample studied. This ﬁnding could
be taken as evidence that Criterion B may not add diag-
nostic value and may not aid in distinguishing between
individuals who self-injure and those who meet NSSI-D.
However, considering the motivations for self-injury may
still be important. In cases where self-injury is motivated
by other factors (eg, desire to be part of a group; to
intimidate others) this would help create a boundary con-
dition that could be of value to clinicians.

The C Criterion of DSM-5 highlights the thoughts or
mood states that are required to accompany self-injurious
behavior. These include interpersonal difﬁculties or nega-
tive thoughts or feelings prior to NSSI, preoccupation with
NSSI that is hard to control, or frequent thoughts of NSSI
even if these are not always acted on. Although these
features are clearly related to NSSI engagement,
they
may not be especially helpful in distinguishing clinically
signiﬁcant NSSI from less severe and more intermittent
NSSI. The vast majority of people who engage in NSSI do
so in the context of negative thoughts or feelings or fol-
lowing negative interpersonal events.47,50 Moreover, even
though one study found that preoccupation with NSSI and
difﬁculties resisting urges to self-injure was reported by
fewer
than half of a sample of German adolescent
inpatients,53 failure to meet Criterion C is almost never
the reason that people are not diagnosed with NSSI-D.54
To the extent that this is the case, Criterion C may not be
especially informative when it comes to distinguishing
between those who engage in self-injury and those warrant
a formal NSSI-D diagnosis.

The D criterion is useful, however, because it creates
boundary conditions and formally excludes socially sanc-
tioned behaviors such as body piercing. It also excludes
very minor and common forms of self-injury such as scab
picking or nail biting. In a related manner, the F criterion
is helpful because it speciﬁes when self-injurious behavior
should not be considered to reﬂect NSSI-D (eg, when self-
injury occurs exclusively in the context of psychosis, or in
individuals with developmental disorders as a part of
repetitive stereotypies). As we have already noted, not all
self-injurious behavior is NSSI. The F Criterion clariﬁes
the contexts where this is the case. Criterion F excludes
self-injury that occurs during psychotic episodes, and also

speciﬁes other disorders that may involve behaviors that
might look like forms of NSSI but are not regarded as such
trichotillomania [hair pulling], excoriation [skin
(eg,
picking]).

Although the F criterion is clearly helpful, care is
needed with regard to its interpretation. Excluding acts of
self-injury that occur only during episodes of psychosis
removes from diagnostic consideration body modiﬁcation
behaviors that result from delusions (eg, belief that this
will save the world) or command hallucinations. However,
we do not interpret this criterion to mean that any person
with a history of psychosis should automatically be
excluded from ever receiving a diagnosis of NSSI-D.
Much depends on the person’s clinical state at the time
of the self-injury as well as their motivations for the
behavior (highlighting again the potential value of criter-
ion B). If someone engages in NSSI during periods of
remission (eg, when not actively psychotic) and if their
behavior meets all other DSM-5 criteria, a diagnosis of
NSSI-D would likely be warranted.

impairment

Finally, we consider Criterion E. This is a common
criterion throughout the DSM and requires that the beha-
vior or its consequences be associated with clinically sig-
in speciﬁed areas of
niﬁcant distress or
functioning. With respect to NSSI, however, this is poten-
tially problematic. NSSI is often used to improve mood
and to alleviate distress. Within the framework of a recent
conceptual model, these are considered to be affective
beneﬁts.55 This may help explain why a minority of people
who meet criteria for NSSI-D report that the behavior has
not caused them distress.50 Individuals with a history of
NSSI engagement are also not always certain that they
want to stop self-injuring.46 Indeed, in one study, only
12% of college students with a NSSI history expressed a
desire to stop the behavior (cited in Brausch).56

In contrast, Gratz et al49 found that Criterion E, relative
to other NSSI-D criteria, most strongly distinguished
between those who did and did not meet criteria for
NSSI-D. In assessing Criterion E, Gratz and colleagues
adopted a multidimensional approach that required clini-
cians to make dimensional ratings (0–4 scale) about NSSI-
related interference on a variety of indicators of impairment.
Although more research on this topic is warranted, the
ﬁndings of this study suggest that a more comprehensive
assessment may be necessary to gauge the extent to which
self-injurious behavior causes clinically signiﬁcant distress
or impairment. Because NSSI is often used as a form of
emotion regulation, people who engage in self-injury may

not always be in the best position to have full insight into
the problems such behaviors may cause for them.

When distress and impairment are measured more
indirectly, most individuals with NSSI show greater levels
of impairment than do those with NSSI who do not meet
NSSI-D criteria.52 Speciﬁcally, individuals who meet cri-
teria for NSSI-D score higher than those with subthreshold
NSSI or no history of NSSI on variables such as past
month suicide ideation and attempts, loneliness, and pro-
blems with emotion regulation.41 To the extent that these
variables can be regarded as proxies for distress and
impairment, the validity of Criterion E would seem to be
supported. However, one key issue is the extent to which
higher scores on measures of psychopathology, life satis-
faction, and other variables that are used as proxies might
be due to other comorbid conditions (such as depression or
borderline personality disorder). What is relevant here is
whether NSSI itself is the source of the distress and impair-
ment. At the present time, this is not fully clear. A survey
than 50% considered
of clinicians found that
Criterion E to be a prototypic feature of NSSI-D.57
However, shame and guilt over NSSI often follow engage-
ment in this behavior. If these are considered to be indi-
cators of distress or impairment, the consequences of NSSI
are likely to be viewed as more problematic.58 Going
forward it will be important to clarify just how Criterion
E should be evaluated and what forms of evidence are
most valid.

The Assessment Of NSSI
In recent years, several interview-based and self-report
measures have been developed to assess NSSI. Just as
deﬁnitions and terms for NSSI have varied over time,
these measures assess NSSI with varying underlying
assumptions and language. Ideally, more consensus deﬁni-
tions for NSSI would allow for more consistent assessment
of these behaviors across measures. However, to date, the
reverse has primarily been true; researchers have adopted
deﬁnitions consistent with the measures they are using
rather than ﬁrst deciding on an optimal deﬁnition.

As a result, NSSI assessments are not always consis-
tent in what they measure. Whereas some include single-
items, assessing only the presence or absence of NSSI
engagement, others
include assessment of numerous
NSSI characteristics, including the frequency, functions,
contexts, sensations/body parts injured, controllability, and
likelihood of continuing these behaviors. The manner in
which these characteristics are assessed also varies.

Although a full consideration of all measures assessing
NSSI is beyond the scope of this review, in the following
sections we provide a brief overview of some of the key
attributes of the most commonly used measures. First,
however, we highlight three newer instruments designed
to assess NSSI-D.

NSSI-Disorder
Most NSSI assessments predate the entry of NSSI-D into
the DSM-5 as a condition for further study. As such, they
do not formally assess NSSI-D diagnostic criteria. To
address this limitation, the Clinician-Administered Non-
Suicidal Self
the
Alexian Brothers Assessment of Self-Injury Scale
(ABASI),47 and the Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Disorder
Scale (NSSIDS)54 have been developed.

Index (CANDI),49

Injury Disorder

Published in 2015, the CANDI assesses all NSSI-D
criteria as outlined in DSM-5. Each criterion is assessed
with a yes/no question, and follow-up questions assess
frequency, duration, intensity, functions, and impairment
of NSSI on continuous Likert-type scales. The CANDI has
demonstrated adequate internal consistency, construct
validity, and interrater reliability in a community sample
of young adults who endorsed NSSI.48 However,
this
measure has not yet been administered to the general
community, and the predictive validity of the CANDI
across time remains unexamined.49 Nevertheless,
this
measure shows promise. Notably though, since NSSI-D
diagnostic criteria include an extremely narrow inclusion
of motives for NSSI,
the CANDI does not provide a
comprehensive assessment of NSSI functions.

Like the CANDI,

the ABASI assesses all NSSI-D
diagnostic criteria. However, the ABASI is a self-report
measure (it is not clinician administered) and it is designed
to assess NSSI-D in individuals who already report enga-
ging in NSSI. The ABASI assesses 21 types of NSSI
behaviors, and includes the phrase “to hurt yourself or
cause pain” when assessing speciﬁc forms of NSSI beha-
viors (eg, ﬁghting, tattooing, over-exercising, food restric-
tion) to clarify that these behaviors are completed for the
explicit purpose of self-injury.47 Consequently, this mea-
sure assesses some behaviors (such as food restriction) that
do not result in damage to the skin, again raising the
question of whether we should include indirect forms of
self-injurious behaviors when assessing NSSI-D. The
ABASI has demonstrated adequate test–retest reliability
and internal consistency in a large and demographically
rich sample of patients admitted to an acute treatment

program that treats NSSI, and factor analyses indicate that
this instrument accurately reﬂects NSSI-D Criteria A
through F. However, given that only one study to date47
has validated this measure, future research on the psycho-
metric properties of the ABASI is needed.

Similar to the ABASI, the NSSIDS,54 also published in
2015, is a self-report measure that assesses diagnostic cri-
teria for NSSI-D. However, this 16-item measure is entirely
faithful to current NSSI-D criteria; as such it does not assess
other indirectly harmful behaviors such as restrictive eating.
The NSSIDS uses Likert-scale items to assess each NSSI-D
criterion. It also includes explicit items to identify distress
and impairment (Criterion E) following NSSI (eg, “does
engaging in self-harm cause you stress?”). Items designed
to identify rule-outs for NSSI-D (Criterion F) are also
included (eg, “how often do you engage in these behaviors
when under the inﬂuence of drugs or alcohol?”). In two
samples of college students with a history of NSSI, the
NSSIDS was shown to have strong internal reliability and
construct validity, suggesting that this scale could mean-
ingfully distinguish individuals with self-injury who do and
do not meet NSSI-D criteria. However, test–retest reliability
and divergent validity for this scale has not yet been
assessed. Of note, this research also found that individuals
who met NSSI-D criteria exhibited more anxiety and
depressive symptoms than did those whose self-injurious
behavior did not meet NSSI-D criteria. Additionally, a con-
siderable proportion of individuals who met criteria A
through D did not endorse Criterion E. This again raises
the notion that individuals who engage in NSSI may often
not endorse distress over NSSI given the effective short-
term mood beneﬁts of this behavior.

Thoughts About Self-Injury
Thoughts of NSSI are not included in the current DSM-5
diagnostic criteria. However, assessment
tools that ask
about thoughts can provide insight into risk for ﬁrst-time
or continued NSSI engagement. Some NSSI assessments
ask about thoughts of NSSI in addition to actual NSSI
engagement. The Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behavior
Interview (SITBI),59 for example, is a widely used and
comprehensive semi-structured interview for adolescents
and adults. One advantage of this measure is that
it
assesses the presence, frequency, duration, and type of
NSSI thoughts and behaviors (in addition to suicidal idea-
tion, plans, preparations, gestures, and attempts).

Severity Of Injury
Two issues emerge when considering assessment of the
severity of NSSI. First, assessments vary in whether they
include or exclude mild and only slightly damaging self-
harming behaviors. For example, several measures including
the Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation (FASM),35
Inventory of Statements about Self-Injury (ISAS),60 and
Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI)61 provide checklists
of different forms of NSSI that include picking at scabs/
wounds, rubbing skin against rough objects, and self-pinch-
ing. These measures may capture a wider representation of
self-harming behaviors, and may be particularly useful in
understanding the future risk of moderate self-harming beha-
viors. However, as we noted earlier, inclusion of these
“milder” behaviors in assessment tools may result in higher
rates of NSSI endorsement than would be observed using
other measures.

Relatedly, some NSSI assessments include behaviors
that may be better captured by other forms of psycho-
pathology. For example, the FASM includes hair pulling
as a form of NSSI, which may be better accounted for by
trichotillomania. The ABASI47 also includes over-exercis-
ing; this may be better accounted for by an eating disorder
diagnosis. Other assessments include more severe self-
harming behaviors, like bone breaking (eg, DSHI).

A second key issue is how to deﬁne severity in general.
Whereas some researchers consider the degree of tissue
damage inﬂicted, others focus more on the recency or
frequency of the behaviors. Although both factors are
likely important, lack of consensus on how to deﬁne and
measure severity is apparent across assessment measures.
It is also worth noting that the number of methods used
may also be an indicator of severity overall.39,62

Direct Versus Indirect Forms Of Self-
Injurious Behavior
Contrary to the requirements listed in the DSM-5 that NSSI
be direct, not all NSSI assessments require this criterion. As
noted earlier, direct self-injury requires that the behavior
immediately results in harm/tissue damage. Behaviors like
overdosing on pills would therefore be considered indirect
self-injury, as the harm they cause is downstream of the
behavior itself.20 Several NSSI measures include these
kinds of indirectly self-damaging behaviors (eg, swallowing
chemicals, as in the ISAS or over-exercising, as in the
ABASI).

Hooley et al

Intentionality
Not all NSSI measures clarify that the self-inﬂicted injury
be intentional (eg, Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory [OSI]).63,64
Although some may argue that this is tacit in the measure
the degree to which people would say “yes” to
itself,
harming themselves via accidental injury (eg, accidental
overdose, accidental cut while chopping food), without
realizing that
the assessment concerns intentional self-
injury, remains unclear.

Frequency And Recency
Assessment measures often vary in how they determine
they use.
frequency as well as in the time-frame that
Regarding how frequency is operationalized, most assess-
ments examine the number of NSSI episodes engaged in
(eg, the SITBI). However, some assessments ask about the
number of days in which NSSI is engaged in over different
intervals (eg, Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Assessment Tool
[NSSI-AT]).65 This approach parallels NSSI-D criteria.
Other assessments avoid questions about the speciﬁc num-
ber of episodes or days, and instead ask participants or
interviewers to rate the frequency of behaviors on a Likert-
type scale ranging in frequency and intensity. This is the
case for the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and
Schizophrenia (K-SADS)66 for example.

NSSI Functions
Several measures (such as the SITBI, the FASM and the
ISAS) include an assessment of NSSI functions. However,
the measures tend to vary in the number and types of
functions assessed. For example, whereas the FASM
assesses 23 functions, including interpersonal and intraper-
the
sonal motivations, others assess 13 functions (eg,
the SITBI).
ISAS) or a handful of
Additionally, there is variability in how these functions
are assessed, with some only questioning the frequency
with which NSSI is engaged in for a speciﬁc function (eg,
FASM, SITBI), and others assessing the self-identiﬁcation
with speciﬁc functions (eg, ISAS). Consequently, preva-
lence estimates of functions of NSSI differ considerably
depending on the assessment measure that is used.29

functions

(eg,

Is There A Preferred Assessment
Measure?
We are not of the opinion that any single measure of NSSI
is best or that any speciﬁc measure should be universally
used. The measure that any investigator selects should be

based on the purpose of the study or the issues under
investigation. However, we do believe that
the wide
range of questions used to assess NSSI, including dispa-
rate underlying assumptions and assessment methods, is
problematic.
Investigators need to be mindful of the
strengths and limitations of any measure they employ,
carefully considering the issues and concerns noted
above. Readers of the NSSI literature should also remain
aware that, as mentioned earlier, differences in the deﬁni-
tion of NSSI can create large differences in the rates of
NSSI observed. A meta-analysis of the prevalence of NSSI
conducted by Swannell, Martin, Page, Hasking, and St.
John67 reported higher rates of NSSI when checklists of
behaviors, rather than open-ended questions, were used.
Rates of NSSI endorsement were also higher when parti-
cipants were anonymous, which is more likely to be the
case for self-report compared to interviewer-based assess-
ments. Problems such as these limit reliability and replic-
ability across studies.

Concluding Comments
The addition of NSSI-D into the DSM represents a major
step forward for research in this area. A more precise
deﬁnition brings with it improved communication about
what NSSI is and is not. It also provides a catalyst for
research into clinically signiﬁcant NSSI.

We must remember, however that the proposed DSM-5
criteria are exactly that – proposed criteria. They represent
a beginning rather than an end point. Whether NSSI
should remain categorical (diagnosis versus no diagnosis)
or be assessed dimensionally (on a scale of severity)
remains an open question. In one study, an ordinal scale
of NSSI severity – relative to a categorical item of NSSI-D
– was found to relate more closely to measures of psycho-
pathology and impairment.47 Such a ﬁnding supports the
broader movement
research and practice
towards a more dimensional approach to psychopathology
symptoms and diagnoses.68

in clinical

The validity of the current DSM-5 criteria remains to
be fully established and many changes are to be expected
for the future. An increase in the frequency threshold for
Criterion A may be required. A more extensive considera-
tion of the minimum number and types of NSSI motiva-
tions that should be covered in Criterion B may also be
necessary if this criterion is to remain central to the diag-
nosis of NSSI-D. Moreover, as Kapur et al19 have noted,
the exclusion of non-suicidal self-poisoning leaves this

form of self-injurious behavior in the “classiﬁcatory wild-
erness” (see19 pp. 326).

Also unclear at the present time, is where – if it is added to
the formal diagnostic nomenclature – NSSI-D will be placed.
Given the mood beneﬁts NSSI provides, should we think of it
as a variant of an Addictive Disorder? Or does it belong with
the Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders?
Other possibilities might
include placing NSSI-D with
Depressive Disorders, Anxiety Disorders, OCD and Related
Disorders, or perhaps even with Neurodevelopmental
Disorders. Yet another option would be to add NSSI as a
speciﬁer for other disorders (eg, major depressive disorder
with NSSI). However, this approach assumes that other clinical
conditions will be present. This is not always the case. Given
the current state of knowledge, we believe it is premature to
make a speciﬁc recommendation on this matter.

Despite these challenges, we agree with Selby et al43 and
also with Brausch56 that recognizing NSSI-D brings with it
many advantages. Efforts to create a consistent deﬁnition of
NSSI will improve assessment. In addition to generating
better estimates of prevalence in small-scale studies, it will
also permit NSSI-D to be included in larger epidemiological
studies. Preliminary recognition of NSSI-D is also likely to
facilitate treatment development. Speciﬁc interventions for
NSSI are now being developed.69,70 However, much more
needs to be done. Given the link between NSSI and suicide
risk, treating NSSI may enhance suicide prevention efforts.
This provides a powerful incentive to focus research atten-
tion to this area in a timely way.
