Abstract

BACKGROUND: Addressing school violence is an important public health goal. To assess the 
role of school mental health curricula in violence prevention, we evaluated effects of an anti-
stigma curriculum on violence victimization/perpetration.

METHODS: An ethnically/socioeconomically diverse sample of 751 sixth-graders (mean age 
11.5 years) across 14 schools in Texas were block-randomized by school (2011–2012) to receive 
singly or in combination: (1) a mental illness anti-stigma curriculum; (2) contact with two young 
adults with mental illness; or (3) merged control (printed materials/no intervention). Pre-posttest 
assessments were self-completed during health education classes; prior to randomization, 484 
(64.5%) agreed to two-year, home-based longitudinal assessments. Statistical models tested short- 
and long-term effects on physical, verbal, and relational/social violence victimization/perpetration.

RESULTS: At one-month post-test, students who received the curriculum versus control made 
fewer verbal threats (p<.05). Those with high-level mental health symptoms in the curriculum 
group versus control used less violence overall and received fewer verbal threats from peers short-
term (p<.05). Curriculum effects of reducing violence perpetration sustained long-term among 
adolescents with high-symptoms (p<.01). The comparator contact intervention was ineffective 
short- and long-term.

CONCLUSIONS: Implementing efficacious mental health curricula can serve as a multipronged 
strategy with anti-bulling efforts to prevent violence and improve mental health.

School violence—bullying, fighting, harassment, weapon use, cyberbullying, and gang 
violence—is an important and preventable public health problem in the United States.1,2 
School violence is unwanted, intended to harm, and can happen once or repeatedly. Often it 
occurs among peer relationships with unbalanced power dynamics.3,4 Roles can involve 
harming others (“bully/perpetrator”), receiving harm (“victim”), or both (“bully/victim”). 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies these behaviors to include 
physical acts such as kicking or hitting, verbal harassment such as making threats of harm or 
teasing, relational/social aggression such as spreading rumors or purposely “leaving 
someone out”, and online/cyber-bullying, and also advises examining these domains 
separately.5–7 Finally, ongoing surveillance has identified suicide and homicide as the 
second and third leading causes of death in 2016 among youth (10–24 years old) in the 
United States, respectively, highlighting how school violence remains a critical public health 
challenge.2,8

Generally, adolescents who are perceived as different, quiet, weak, or less popular by their 
peers are vulnerable to violence victimization of all types/domains.6,9–12 Adolescents with 
mental health problems, often perceived as different, experience “othering” as a component 
of mental illness stigma,13 and therefore are particularly vulnerable to participation in school 
violence as a victim and/or perpetrator versus not experiencing violence at all.9,10,14–19 
While those with mental health problems are more likely to be victims than perpetrators, 
when they do use violence, they are commonly acting as “bully/victims”—those who 
simultaneously are victims and perpetrators of violence among their peers.9,10,14,15 Rarely 
do adolescents with mental health problems engage in one-sided violence perpetration.14,15 
It is important for prevention efforts to reduce violence among adolescents with mental 
health problems who very often experience concurrent victimization with perpetration as 
“bully/victims”.

School anti-bullying interventions have been successful in reducing school violence.11,20–23 
However, unknown is whether anti-bullying efforts can reduce violence specifically for 
students with mental health problems. Given that mental health symptoms are associated 
with experiencing violence, it is also unknown whether interventions that de-stigmatize 
mental illness can be effective in addressing victimization for those with mental health

problems. Further, it is unknown whether students with such problems can change their own 
behaviors following school-based intervention. An approach that effectively reduces mental 
illness stigma could potentially also foster feelings of acceptance and social integration 
among students with mental illness and thereby reduce their use of violence when faced with 
peer conflict. This study addresses these gaps in knowledge by evaluating whether a mental 
health curriculum among sixth-graders—previously shown to effectively reduce stigma and 
increase help-seeking24,25—can also effectively, (1) reduce violence that students with 
mental health problems receive from their peers, and (2) change behaviors among students 
with mental health problems. This evaluation is conducted to assess short- and long-term 
anti-stigma intervention effects on self-reported violence victimization/perpetration among 
an ethnically/socioeconomically diverse sixth-grade sample across mental health status.

The school mental health curriculum (described below; not proprietary to any author, write 
contact@mentalhealthconnection.org for more information) was designed to promote the 
acceptance of differences, foster empathy, and change mental illness stigma—aiming to 
break down “us” versus “them” with mental illness knowledge and empathy thereby 
attacking a core aspect of stigma.13 A comparator intervention arm involved contact with 
two young adults who shared their experiences relating to their mental illness diagnosis. 
Previous research has found that both education- and contact-based mental illness anti-
stigma programs are effective strategies for changing behavioral intentions among 
adolescents, particularly avoiding or social distancing from a person with a mental illness.26 
Concerning school violence prevention, we hypothesized that the empathy-based school 
mental health curriculum that reduced stigma also met school violence prevention guidelines
—reduce individual risk factors, improve interpersonal relationships, improve the school 
mental health context, and change broader social norms.27,28 We expected the curriculum to 
reduce school violence particularly among students with mental health problems, and for 
effects to endure over the two-year follow-up.

METHODS

Data came from the Texas Stigma Study (2011–2015), a longitudinal evaluation of a mental 
illness anti-stigma intervention among a large multi-ethnic sixth-grade sample that aimed to 
improve mental illness-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.24,25 The selection of 
participants, design, and procedures are described in detail elsewhere.24,25 Using a fully-
crossed 2×2×2 factorial design (8 cells), three unique anti-stigma interventions were block-
randomized across sixth-grade classes in 14 participating schools in an urban area in Texas. 
Schools were ranked according to performance on standardized exams and were combined 
to create relatively equal-scoring pairs of schools that were then randomly assigned to an 
intervention cell to achieve about equal percent passing standardized exams across the cells. 
Block-randomization pragmatically reflected the way the interventions would be delivered if 
adopted for wide-scale use and reduced the possibility of cross-contamination between 
students receiving different interventions within the same school. Thus, each school was 
block-randomized to receive singly or in combination one of the following: (1) mental health 
anti-stigma curriculum, (2) contact with two young adults with mental illness, or (3) printed 
materials with anti-stigma messaging. Before the study began, two large schools dropped out 
for reasons unrelated to the study. Therefore, the study was repeated during a second

Participants

academic year with a new set of sixth-grade students in five smaller participating schools 
that were demographically similar to the lost schools. Each school’s entire sixth-grade class 
received the randomly assigned intervention during their health education class. The schools 
and participants were unaware of their assignment prior to agreeing to participate. The 
current study evaluates the short- and long-term effectiveness of the anti-stigma curriculum 
on influencing violence victimization/perpetration compared to the comparator interventions 
of contact and materials.

During health education classes, self-completed assessments on laptops measured mental 
health symptoms and violence victimization/perpetration at pre-test/baseline and one-month 
post-intervention. Prior to randomization, a sub-sample agreed to 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month 
follow-up assessments to be completed at their homes. While offered in English and 
Spanish, all students completed assessments in English. Both students and parents/guardians 
gave assent/consent for participation. Students were not included in the study without signed 
forms. Students and parents/guardians received a modest monetary incentive for returning 
signed forms and for completing each assessment.

All sixth-grade students from participating schools were invited. Of the 751 students 
agreeing to participate (60% of all invited), 721 completed pre-posttest assessments (see 
Appendix Figure 1 for participant flow diagram). The study sample is representative of 
publicly available classroom enrollment data across age, race/ethnicity, sex, and 
socioeconomic status; therefore, there is little evidence of non-response bias at baseline. At 
baseline, mean age was 11.5 years and more than half were girls (Table 1). The sample, like 
the broader population it was drawn from, was ethnically and socioeconomically diverse: 
77% self-identified as a racial/ethnic minority, 70% came from a household income <
$50,000, about the national and Texas median income in 2011,29 and 57% had a parent/
guardian with a high school diploma or less. Prior to randomization, a sub-sample (N=484; 
64.5% response rate) agreed to participate longitudinally. Short- and long-term samples, and 
loss to follow up in the long-term, did not significantly differ by sex, race/ethnicity, 
socioeconomic status, or intervention group (see Appendix Tables 1 and 2),24 resulting in 
432 complete cases in the longitudinal sample. Finally, 265 adolescents in the short-term and 
171 in the long-term sample screened in the top tertile (36%) of mental health symptoms and 
are considered high-level symptoms.

Interventions

The school mental health curriculum entitled, ‘Eliminating the Stigma of Differences’, was a 
three-module, three-hour anti-stigma curriculum with didactic presentations, group 
discussion, and homework materials. Designed for easy dissemination, the curriculum met 
state health education curricula requirements,30 and was delivered by health education 
teachers with no prior specialized training (see Appendix Table 3 for further description).25 
Module 1 topics included: the bases on which we judge others to be different; the definition, 
causes, and consequences of stigma; and ways to end stigma, including educating oneself 
about the differences, stopping others from making fun of these differences, and taking care 
and being mindful of the words people say to each other. Modules 2 and 3 described

examples of mental illness, included discussions of causes and treatments, and provided 
content that stimulated empathy for others.

Two other intervention components—contact with two young adults with a mental illness 
and printed materials with anti-stigma messaging—did not include themes regarding 
accepting differences. The contact intervention involved two young adults with a mental 
illness who were trained to speak for 10-minutes about their life and social experiences 
before, during, and after being diagnosed with a mental illness, followed by group 
discussion for the duration of the one-hour class period. The two young adults also discussed 
their experiences with psychiatric treatment and recovery.

The printed materials with anti-stigma messaging included bookmarks that were distributed 
and posters that were hung up in classroom settings during the intervention period. However, 
current analyses and prior reports found little evidence that printed materials induced 
changes on the outcomes of interest; the group receiving materials appeared the same as the 
no-intervention group and was merged with control.24,25

Each component was designed to reflect its real-world application if implemented resulting 
in different durations—three-hour curriculum, one-hour contact, one-time distribution of 
materials. We hypothesized that the curriculum component, which employed principles of 
active learning and fostered empathy would facilitate a reduction in violence victimization/
perpetration among the students who received it. As the contact and materials components 
did not discuss differences or being mindful of the negative ways in which others are treated, 
particularly peers with a mental illness, we hypothesized that contact and materials would 
not reduce violence victimization/perpetration.

Violence Victimization/Perpetration.—Drawing on the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention guidelines for research in school violence,4 we measured the frequency of 
violence victimization/perpetration in the physical, verbal, and social domains using the 19-
item Problem Behavior Frequency Aggression Scale.31,32 Owing to very low prevalence of 
very high frequency responses, responses to each item were dichotomized as “0 times” and 
“1+ time(s)” (see Appendix Table 4 for item wording/responses). Using exploratory factor 
analysis, we examined content validity of the clustered items, constructed scales, and tested 
their reliability and correlations with one another, as previously reported.14 “Physical” items 
involved physical contact such as hitting or pushing. “Verbal” items included harassment 
and making threats. “Social” items concerned spreading rumors or intentionally being “left 
out”. Six variables representing the type and role of violent behaviors were created: used 
physical violence, used verbal threats, used social aggression, received physical violence, 
received verbal threats, and received social aggression (alphas=.78–.86).

Mental health status.—A 23-item symptoms checklist from the National Institute of 
Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version IV provided a compact 
self-reported screen.33 Items examined attention-hyperactive symptoms such as “felt too 
active or fidgety”, depressive symptoms such as “felt really sad or depressed”, and anxious 
symptoms such as “worried too much”. Exploratory factor analysis indicated that using the

full scale (alpha=.87) fit the data better than sub-scales focused on more specific symptom 
content; thus, all items were combined to create a global mental health score. Adolescents 
with high symptoms were identified as those scoring in the top tertile of the checklist at any 
assessment period. Upon examining depressive-anxious (alpha=.83) and hyperactive-
attention (alpha=.67) symptoms separately, no difference in results were found.

Covariates.—Participants self-reported sex (female—referent), race/ethnicity (non-Latinx 
white—referent), and household income (≥$50,000—referent). Social desirability bias was 
examined using a reliable scale for research on children as measures were self-reported.34,35 
Fidelity to the curriculum content, quality of delivery, including teacher effectiveness, 
enthusiasm, and satisfaction, and level of student engagement were assessed by two 
observers in each classroom (intraclass correlation=.93) with a 60-item measure based on 
two existing tools with good psychometric properties.36,37 Longitudinal analyses also 
controlled for an indicator for time.

Data Analysis

The short-term evaluation used all pre-posttest data (N=751) while the longitudinal 
evaluation used additional 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month follow-up data (N=484). Poisson 
regression models were used to test main effects of the curriculum, contact, and materials 
components versus control on counts of self-reported violence victimization/perpetration 
outcomes; no over-dispersion was detected. A three-way interaction of the intervention 
components was examined. The materials group was no different from control, and all three-
way interaction tests were not statistically significant. Thus, final models tested the main 
effects of receiving the curriculum or contact component, versus materials/no intervention 
merged control, on physical, verbal, and social violence victimization/perpetration.

The study design obviated potential self-selection of students into the intervention. 
Nevertheless, owing to block-randomization of schools, significant pre-test differences were 
found across intervention groups on race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (Table 1; 
p<.05). To control for these pre-intervention group differences, the pre-test value of the 
outcome variable was included in the model. We also examined whether including 
sociodemographic covariates or variables indicating social desirability bias, fidelity to the 
curriculum, and number of mental health symptoms changed point estimates after 
controlling for the pre-test values of the outcome. None of the covariates were statistically 
significant and their inclusion in the models did not change the findings. For model 
parsimony, short-term effects models controlled for pre-test values of the violence outcomes 
only, while long-term effects models controlled for pre-test values of each outcome as well 
as time, sex, race/ethnicity, and household income. Finally, we tested interactions between 
all covariates and the interventions to test whether effects varied across these factors. As 
stratified analyses across sex showed similar results, the combined findings are presented. 
Stratification by mental health status showed slightly different results; thus, the sub-sample 
with high-symptoms are presented.

To test whether short-term effects sustained, generalized estimating equations models 
examined long-term effects of the curriculum and contact interventions on each outcome in

the total longitudinal sample and sub-sample with high-symptoms. Generalized estimating 
equations models accounted for the clustering of assessments within individuals over time, 
and specified a Poisson family and corresponding log link to appropriately model the 
distribution of the outcome.38,39 An exchangeable correlation structure and robust standard 
errors were used to allow the estimates to be maximally valid in the event of model 
misspecification.38,39 Predicted counts of violence victimization/perpetration across 
intervention groups were generated from the generalized estimating equations results. P-
values less than .05 were considered statistically significant. Data analysis was performed 
using STATA/SE Version 14.2.40

Minimal missing data was found in the longitudinal sample: 2% of adolescents had missing 
mental health status due to nonresponse of the checklist across all observed time points. 
Concerning violence victimization/perpetration, <3% were missing, also due to item 
nonresponse in the full sample, while <1% were missing in the high-symptom sub-sample. 
Most missing data affected household income (8% missing) where missing values were 
imputed using other variables that were found to be correlated with income and also all 
available covariate and outcome data in the models. Generalized estimating equations 
analyses were conducted for each of 20 multiple imputed data sets and results were 
combined according to Rubin’s rules,41 improving the overall analytic sample size from 
N=432 in the complete case to N=445 in the imputation analyses. The size and direction of 
the effect of the covariates were similar when using complete or imputed samples. 
Intervention effects on violence perpetration attenuated using the imputed dataset; thus, 
results from the imputation analyses are presented.

RESULTS

Short-term Effects

Table 2 displays the results from the Poisson regression models testing short-term effects 
(one-month) of the curriculum and contact interventions on the victimization/perpetration of 
physical, verbal, and social violent behaviors in the total sample and the sub-sample 
screening high with mental health symptoms. With respect to perpetration, overall, students 
who received the curriculum versus the materials/no intervention group significantly 
decreased their use of verbal threats (p<.05). Adolescents with high-level symptoms who 
received the curriculum versus control also used fewer verbal threats (p<.05), physical 
violence (p<.01), and social aggression (p<.01) one-month post-intervention. No effects on 
perpetration was found for those in the contact group versus control in either the full or high-
symptom sub-sample.

Regarding violence victimization (Table 2), students with mental health problems in the 
curriculum group versus control received fewer verbal threats from their peers one-month 
post-intervention (p<.05). No curriculum effects were found for the full sample or high-
symptom sub-sample for physical or social violence victimization. Finally, students with 
high-symptoms in the contact group versus control received 1.29 times more physical 
violence (p<.01). No other contact effects were found for victimization.

Long-term Effects

Page 8

Reductions in violence perpetration sustained over the two-year period (Table 3). Students 
with high-symptoms receiving the curriculum versus control saw 0.73 reduction in the use of 
verbal threats (p<.05) and 0.77 reduction in the use of social aggression (p<.05) during the 
two-year follow-up. In the total sample, no significant long-term curriculum or contact 
effects were found on perpetration.

For violence victimization in the total sample, students in the contact group versus control 
experienced more physical violence (p<.05) during the two-year follow-up; a similar pattern 
was found in the high-symptom sub-sample for physical violence (p<.01) and verbal threats 
(p<.05). No other long-term effects on victimization were observed.

From the models presented in Table 3, predicted counts of all perpetrated violence, including 
physical, verbal, and social domains, in those receiving the curriculum or contact versus 
control were generated (Figures 1–2). Generally, violent behaviors declined during the two-
year period. All students receiving the curriculum versus control perpetrated significantly 
less violence at post-test (Figure 1); this pattern was not significant at later periods. In the 
high-symptom sub-sample, those receiving the curriculum versus control saw sustained, 
significantly lower perpetration throughout the two-year follow-up (Figure 2). No 
differences in perpetration was found for the contact group.

DISCUSSION

This study presents an evaluation of a block-randomized school mental health anti-stigma 
curriculum on school violence. The curriculum has been previously demonstrated to de-
stigmatize mental illness and promote mental health help-seeking.24,25 This current study 
extends the promise of the curriculum to reducing physical, verbal, and social violent 
behaviors, particularly the perpetration of verbal threats among all students in the short-term, 
and the perpetration of physical, verbal, and social violence among students with mental 
health problems over two-year follow-up. The contact intervention was not effective. 
Although students with mental health problems are more likely to experience violence 
victimization than perpetration,14 we find that these students’ behaviors respond to 
intervention—one that by extension may be fostering feelings of inclusion at school. 
Furthermore, analysis of all students showed that those who received the curriculum saw 
short-term declines in making verbal threats. Although school violence behaviors peak in 
middle adolescence, students receiving the curriculum reported a decline in perpetration 
rather than the expected incline.

The contact intervention had no discernable impact on violence perpetration, and it appeared 
to slightly increase physical violence victimization, particularly among those with mental 
health problems. This finding was perhaps due to the absence of a discussion about 
differences among peers in the contact intervention that was offered in the curriculum. 
Despite both curriculum- and contact-based interventions being effective in reducing mental 
illness stigma-related attitudes among students/adolescents,26 our study provides new 
evidence concerning the impact of these interventions on school violence.

The findings suggest that the curriculum goes beyond the provision of information about 
mental illnesses and their causes and may promote messages of empathy and acceptance that 
resulted in lessened violence perpetration. Moreover, the curriculum encourages active 
involvement of students in and outside the classroom to help them better understand 
differences between people and enhance acceptance of people with differences. Together, the 
didactic material, in-class discussions, and homework assignments comprising the 
curriculum appear to provide the necessary content and activity for facilitating behavioral 
change among students with mental health problems and their peers. As short-term 
reductions were found across all types of violence perpetration among students with mental 
health problems, this finding suggests that students with mental health problems are able to 
change their behaviors following intervention, as well as their peers with respect to use of 
verbal harassment.

Of clinical and public health importance, students with mental health problems in the 
curriculum group received fewer verbal threats from peers in the short-term. As this outcome 
included incidents of being threatened by a weapon such as a gun or knife in the past 30 
days, as a sensitivity test, we further assessed short-term effects on this single item: those 
with high mental health symptoms receiving the curriculum versus control saw lower odds 
of being threatened with a weapon (Odds Ratio=0.55, 95%CI:0.48,0.63). For students with 
mental health problems, experiencing one less threatening incident involving a weapon may 
also lower risk of injury or death, demonstrating the curriculum’s potential to deescalate 
violence and enhance general school safety.

No short- or long-term effects of the curriculum on received social aggression was found. 
This was perhaps partly due to how social aggression measures may have also included 
experiences outside of the school context, perhaps from the broader community, and 
therefore, outside of the scope of the intervention. The lack of effects of the curriculum on 
received social aggression also indicated no evidence of an increase in received social 
aggression among those with mental health problems following changes in stigma in the 
classroom due to the curriculum. That is, no unintentional harm to those with mental health 
problems was created post-curriculum after changing classroom norms around stigma.25 
Furthermore, non-significant findings for received social aggression suggested no “special” 
or “positive” treatment resulting from the curriculum. This type of treatment is a less 
acknowledged form of stigma that occurs when those with mental health problems are 
differentially treated with excessive, and oftentimes unwanted, positive attention.42 
Nevertheless, all students who received the curriculum regardless of mental health status 
reported significant declines in making verbal threats of violence.

Limitations

Limitations of the original study that produced the data for this analysis have been 
previously published, including that two schools dropped out before the study began and 
40% of all those invited did not participate.25 While these limitations may affect 
generalizability, the study sample was representative of publicly available classroom 
enrollment data. Additional limitations of this current analysis require discussion. First, all 
violent behaviors measures were reported simultaneously, preventing an assessment of

Conclusions

directionality between roles and types. For instance, situations of self-defense or escalation 
of verbal/social behaviors into physical ones was unclear. Second, the assessment of violent 
behaviors asked about occurrences but not severity. Additional reports from bystanders, 
faculty/staff, or parents could improve the assessment. However, the validated Problem 
Behavior Frequency Aggression Scale assessed intervention effects on common school 
violence behaviors. Finally, the mental health assessment was not reflective of diagnoses or 
impairment among students. Thus, the student sub-sample with high mental health 
symptoms represented those who screen high on the checklist. Nevertheless, those in the 
high-symptom group reported an average of three times more symptoms than those in the 
bottom tertiles suggesting clinical need.

School violence is an enduring public concern in the United States. Despite the limitations 
described above, this randomized field experiment provides a promising assessment of how 
efficacious school mental health curricula can produce multi-dimensional benefits to 
recipients and their social contexts, particularly reducing experiences of violence among 
students with mental health problems. This study is novel in that the intervention was 
implemented at an opportune age early in the development of violence victimization/
perpetration and mental health problems among school-aged peers. The study employed 
randomization, longitudinal measures with good psychometric properties, robust 
comparators, and a diverse school-based sample. Generally, a curriculum focused on mental 
illness stigma and accepting differences can address several dimensions, having broad 
application for addressing several stigmatized statuses.

IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH

Implementing efficacious school mental health curricula focused in anti-stigma can serve as 
part of a multipronged strategy, along with other anti-bullying efforts, to improve the context 
in schools regarding mental health issues and prevent school violence. Our study found that 
sixth-grade is an appropriate time to implement such a strategy and that addressing mental 
health may be an important component to any intervention aimed at reducing school 
violence. Moreover, the curriculum is easy to use in school settings and ready for 
dissemination, requiring just three hours to implement with no prior specialized training, 
which may be appealing given the demands on schools’ and teachers’ time. In light of this, it 
is recommended that school leaders and stakeholders examine the state of their current 
mental health curricula/programs. In particular, current school mental health curricula/
programs should be assessed for being evidenced-based, appropriate for the setting, context, 
and student demographic, and inclusive of effective anti-stigma strategies. In order to gain 
the benefit of reducing school violence jointly with promoting school mental health, it is 
recommended for school mental health curricula to go beyond mental health literacy of 
different types of illnesses and treatments to also ensure the successful implementation of 
evidenced-based mental illness anti-stigma strategies such as the curriculum evaluated in 
this study.
