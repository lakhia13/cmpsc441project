ADHD is a developmental disorder characterized by an ongoing pattern of one or more of the following types of symptoms:

- Inattention, such as having difficulty paying attention, keeping on task, or staying organized

- Hyperactivity, such as often moving around (including during inappropriate times), feeling restless, or talking excessively

- Impulsivity, such as interrupting, intruding on others, or having trouble waiting one’s turn

It is common for people to show these behaviors some of the time. However, for people with ADHD, the behaviors are frequent and occur across multiple situations, such as at school, at home, at work, or with family and friends.

## Why is NIMH studying ADHD?


ADHD is one of the most common disorders diagnosed in children. Symptoms begin in childhood and usually continue into the teen years and adulthood. ADHD often co-occurs with other disorders and conditions, such as conduct problems, learning disorders, sleep problems,anxiety, ordepression, which can make the conditions harder to diagnose and treat.

For many people with ADHD, symptoms cause problems in daily life. Symptoms can make it hard to get things done; interfere with school, work, or other activities; and strain social relationships. Children with ADHD are at increased risk for injuries, social problems, family stress, and poor grades. Teens and adults with ADHD are more likely to engage in risky behaviors, such as substance use and unsafe sexual activity.


## How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic?


NIMH supports research into the possible causes of ADHD. Researchers are investigating factors such as genes, hormones and other molecules, brain structure and activity, and prenatal and early life exposures. NIMH-supported research is also exploring the behavioral profiles of children and adults with ADHD to better diagnose and treat the disorder. This includes identifying symptoms associated with particular types of ADHD and their presentation at different ages.

We’re also supporting research on treatments, services, and interventions for people with ADHD and their families. Standard ADHD treatments include medication and psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, parent training, and school interventions. Newer treatments include neurofeedback, cognitive training, mindfulness, and neuromodulation. Researchers are looking at these treatment approaches separately and together and comparing their effectiveness for different ADHD symptoms. Additionally, researchers are exploring new technologies, like mobile apps and virtual reality, that can deliver information to people in real time to help them change their behavior.
