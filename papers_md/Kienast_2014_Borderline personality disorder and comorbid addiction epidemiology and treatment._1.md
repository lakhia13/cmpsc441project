Borderline Personality Disorder  
and Comorbid Addiction

Epidemiology and Treatment

Thorsten Kienast, Jutta Stoffers, Felix Bermpohl, Klaus Lieb

SUMMARY
Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) affects 2.7% of adults. About 
78% of adults with BPD also develop a substance-related disorder or addiction 
at some time in their lives. These persons are more impulsive and clinically 
less stable than BPD patients without substance dependency. They display 
 suicidal behavior to a greater extent, drop out of treatment more often, and 
have shorter abstinence phases. The combination of borderline personality 
 disorder with addiction requires a special therapeutic approach. 

Methods: This review is based on a selective literature search about the treat-
ment of patients with BPD and addiction, with particular attention to Cochrane 
Reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCT).

Results: The available evidence is scant. In two RCTs, Dialectical Behavior 
 Therapy for Substance Use Disorders (DBT-SUD) was found to improve patients’ 
overall functional level (standardized mean difference, 1.07–1.78) and to in-
crease the number of abstinence days (effect strength [ES], 1.03) and negative 
urine samples (ES, 0.75). Dual focus schema therapy (DFST) was evaluated in 
three RCTs. Because of methodological problems, however, no useful quanti-
tative comparison across trials is possible. In one RCT, dynamic deconstructive 
psychotherapy (DDP) was found to have only a moderate, statistically insignifi-
cant effect. Only a single study provides data about potentially helpful drug 
therapy over the intermediate term. 

Conclusion: Patients with borderline personality disorder and comorbid addic-
tion should be treated as early as possible for both conditions in a thematically 
hierarchical manner. There is no evidence for any restriction on drug therapy to 
prevent recurrent addiction in these patients. The psychotherapeutic tech-
niques that can be used (despite the currently inadequate evidence base) in-
clude DBT-SUD, DFST, and DDP. These patients need qualified expert counseling 
in choosing a suitable type of psychotherapy. Specific treatment is available in 
only a few places, and the relevant treatment networks in Germany are just 
 beginning to be constructed.

T he treatment of patients with borderline personal-

ity  disorder  (BPD)  and  comorbid  addiction  is 
complex. Frequently, there is uncertainty among health 
professionals  about  how  to  respond  to  patients’ 
 self-harm behavior and how to design treatment plans. 
Consequently, intuition-guided treatment often ends up 
in  difficult,  ill-fated,  doctor-patient  relationships  and 
impedes the use of effective therapeutic interventions.

Case vignette
27-year-old  Ms.  K.  fits  the  criteria  for  BPD  with  co-
morbid addiction. Clinically, the patient presented with 
severe daily self-harming by cutting herself at the ex-
tremities  and  repeatedly  inflicting  burns  to  various 
parts of her body. The desired effects of this behavior 
were  relief  of  tension  and  self-punishment,  with  the 
consequences  at  times  posing  a  vital  threat  to  the 
 patient.  In  addition,  she  consumed  excessive  amounts 
of  alcohol,  combined  with  heroine,  cannabis  and 
 benzodiazepine dependences. To that point, periods of 
abstinence had been interrupted by craving and family 
conflicts.  Ms.  K.  has  been  experiencing  suicidal 
ideation,  including  4  suicide  attempts,  since  age  14. 
Numerous  treatment  were  terminated  early,  either  by 
the patient or the institution. 
This paper provides an overview of:

● the  available  studies  on  the  efficacy  of  psycho-
pharmacotherapy  as  well  as  psychotherapy,

 medicine. 

to 

The three types of psychotherapy evaluated as being 

effective will be presented.

Epidemiology
The results from the National Epidemiological Survey 
on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) of over 
43 000  adult  individuals,  completed  in  the  United 
States,  showed  a  point  prevalence  rate  for  borderline 
personality  disorders  (BPD)  of  2.7%  (1).  Lower 
 income,  younger  age  (<30  years),  marital  status 
 (separated, divorced, widowed), and lower educational 
attainment  were  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of 
 occurrence  of  the  disorder  (2).  With  3.0%,  BPD  was 
significantly more frequently diagnosed in women than

Alcohol-dependent patients with personality 
 disorder are different from those without 
 personality  disorder in that they show
– an increased general psychopathological burden (7)

– an earlier onset (7, 8)

– more severe dependence symptoms (7, 8)

– a lower level of social functioning (9)

– more frequent use of other drugs (9, 10)

– increased suicidal behavior (8, 11)

– shorter periods of abstinence and more frequent relapses (10, 11)

– more frequent patient- and center-initiated treatment dropout (12).

– Overall, the long-term prognosis of the dependence disorder is poorer (13).

in men (2.4%). However, this difference may be the re-
sult  of  a  diagnostic  bias  and  the  disorder  may  be 
equally distributed between the sexes (3).

Patients with BPD
The  most  frequent  comorbid  psychiatric  disorders  in 
BPD  patients  are  anxiety  and  affective  disorders,  in-
cluding posttraumatic stress disorder. The overall life-
time  prevalence  for  these  comorbidities  is  approxi-
mately  85%,  followed  by  substance-related  disorders 
with  a  lifetime  prevalence  of  78%  (2).  However,  two 
further studies found lower lifetime prevalence rates for 
the use of dependence-producing substances. In a Ger-
man  sample  of  147  patients,  lifetime  prevalence  was 
similar (57.1% [4]) to the 64.1% found in a US study 
(5). In Germany, tobacco dependence (54%), followed 
by  alcohol  dependence  (47%)  and  drug  dependence 
(22%)  were  the  most  common  substance  dependence 
comorbidities  (1).  Overall,  the  probability  of  occur-
rence of a drug dependence (odds ratio [OR] 10.1) and 
alcohol  dependence  (OR  5.38)  or  a  substance-related 
disorder in general (OR 4.50) is significantly increased 
among BPD patients compared with that in the general 
population (2).

Patients with dependence disorders and various personality 
disorders
Conversely,  increased  prevalence  rates  for  personality 
disorders  are  also  found  in  patients  with  dependence 
disorders, e.g. a rate of approximately 57% in alcohol-
related  disorders.  Here,  with  13%  of  cases  the  most 
common diagnosis was BPD (6) (Box).

Focused on patients with borderline personality disorder and 
comorbid substance dependence disorders
The  behavior  of  these  patients  is  characterized  by 
greater  impulsivity  compared  with  patients  diagnosed 
with  only  one  of  the  two  disorders.  Clinically,  this 
manifests  as  a  preference  for  short-term  rewards  and 

the reduced ability to work towards mid- or long-term 
rewards (11, 14). The findings regarding an aggravation 
of  BPD  symptoms  with  comorbid  dependence 
 disorders are inconsistent (15–17). Even though the fre-
quency of substance-related disorders in BPD patients 
decreases over the years (18), addiction is found to be a 
factor associated with a more unfavorable diagnosis in 
initially  diagnosed  with  both  BPD  and 
patients 
 dependence disorder, as remissions, defined as a drop 
below the minimum number of criteria required for the 
diagnosis  of  BPD  according  to  DSM,  occur  less  fre-
quently: Remissions in BPD patients without comorbid 
addiction were four times more likely to occur within a 
period  of  six  years  compared  with  patients  with  such

p<0.001) or mood disorders (HR 1.97, p<0.001) (18).

Etiology and phenomenology of substance use 
in BPD patients
Substance use is caused by multiple factors. BPD  patients 
often use dependence-producing substances in an attempt 
to  mitigate  emotions  perceived  as  over whelmingly 
negative  or  to  replace  these  by  a  pleasant  state,  such  as 
feeling  intoxicated  (self-medication   hypothesis).  Apart 
from that, the use of addictive substances can also be trig-
gered by factors related to the social environment, such as 
peer pressure. The patterns of use show the same diversity 
as  in  the  general  population.  Substances  are  frequently 
taken with the intention to produce a state similar to disso-
ciation. Thus, the frequency of use can follow an episodic 
through to a dependent pattern of use (19).

Treatment of borderline personality disorder 
and comorbid substance dependence
In  the  following,  an  overview  of  the  specific 
 treatment  options  for  BPD  patients  with  comorbid 
 dependence  disorder  will  be  provided  which  is  based 
on  current  Cochrane  Collaboration  reviews  (20,  21) 
and  a  complementary  recent  search  of  the  literature 

for  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  in  Medline 
(Figure).  To   estimate  treatment  effects,  standardized 
mean  differences  (SMDs)  and  risk  ratios  (RRs) 
were  calculated  for  continuous  and  categorical  data, 
 respectively.

Treatment
Psychopharmacotherapy
Since in patients with BPD comorbid dependence dis-
orders are typically regarded as an exclusion criterion 
for  pharmacotherapy  studies  (21),  the  available  evi-
dence is limited to one randomized controlled treatment 
trial  (RCT)  on  alcohol-dependent  patients  with  BPD. 
This  study  compared  254  alcohol-dependent  patients 
with

● comorbid BPD
● comorbid anti-social personality disorder or
● none of the two personality disorders.
The studies investigated the efficacy of 
● placebo
● 50 mg naltrexone (an opioid antagonist)
● 50 mg naltrexone plus 250 mg disulfiram or
● 250  mg  disulfiram  plus  placebo  for  addiction-

 related and general psychiatric symptoms.

The results were: 
● Pharmacological  relapse  prevention  in  patients 
with alcohol dependency and comorbid BPD was 
equally  effective  as  in  patients  with  alcohol 
 dependency without comorbid BPD.

● Pharmacotherapy  with  disulfiram  or  naltrexone 
reduced craving to the same extent as the intake of 
placebo.

In addition, no drug was superior to the others (22). 
There  are  no  studies  on  other  addictive  substances 
available.

Note  to  clinicians:  Patients  with  alcohol  depen -
dence  and  comorbid  BPD  benefit  to  the  same  extent 
from  pharmacotherapy  as  patients  with  dependence 
disorder  without  comorbid  BPD.  Consequently,  phar-
macological  relapse  prevention  should  always  be 
 offered to patients with BPD and alcohol dependence, 
with continued administration if successful (10).

Psychotherapy
Data  on  the  efficacy  of  psychological  therapies  are 
somewhat  more  robust  (20).  Presently  available  from 
comorbid patient populations are RCTs and manuals on 
Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy  for  Substance  Use 
 Disorders (DBT-SUD) (23–26), a version of dialectical 
behavior  therapy  specifically  developed  for  comorbid 
patients,  on  dynamic  deconstructive  psychotherapy 
(DDP)  (27–30),  a  psychodynamic  approach,  and  on 
schema  therapy  for  addiction  (Dual  Focus  Schema 
Therapy, DFST) (31–34).

Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy  for  Substance  Use 
Disorders  (DBT-SUD)—DTB-SUD  is  a  behavioral 
therapy which, because of its transparency and specifi-
cally developed educational concept, is easier to learn 
than any other method currently available for this pa-
tient  group.  It  takes  a  solution-focused  approach  and 
teaches  these  patients  to  assume  personal  responsibil-
ity.

Fundamental  principles:  1.  Simultaneous  treatment 
of both disorders: Patients with BPD frequently use ad-
dictive substances to control tensions and emotions, in 

Deutsches Ärzteblatt International | Dtsch Arztebl Int 2014; 111(16): 280–6 

the same way they use self-harm, for example. Would 
only the self-harm behavior be addressed, an increased 
use  of  additive  substances  would  probably  occur,  and 
vice versa (shifting of symptoms). For this reason, it is 
recommended  to  simultaneously  treat  the  dependence 
disorder and BPD.

2. Patient attachment: A key principle is the system-
atic use of attachment strategies. These strategies foster 
regular participation even of patients who find it very 
difficult to do so.

3. Dialectical abstinence: The principle of dialectical 
abstinence  enables  the  therapist  to  keep  the  focus  on 
what  is  possible  for  the  individual  patient  instead  of 
 demanding radical changes in their consumption beha-
vior. Abstinence  is  the  ultimate  goal  of  the  treatment 
which  is  to  be  achieved  step-by-step  along  the  thera-
peutic path. Therefore, vital skills are trained before the 
substance is withdrawn to ensure that during early ab-
stinence, in the event of a crisis patients can resort to 
skills they have already learnt.

4. Skills training: Learning a battery of specific skills 

to cope with addictive behavior.

Implementation: DBT-SUD consists of:
● weekly  individual  therapy  (the  psychotherapy 
processes are worked upon and the further thera-
peutic steps are planned and coordinated),

● weekly  educative  group  therapy  for  skills  train-

ing,

● visiting self-help groups and addiction counseling 

facilities, 

● telephone coaching for patients, and
● supervision for therapists.
Key to the therapy’s efficacy are the lived eight basic 
assumptions of DBT for therapists and the targeted use 
of the six distinct validation strategies stated for DBT-
SUD.

Efficacy:  So  far,  DBT  has  been  evaluated  in  two 
RCTs  (Table  1)  in  which  significant  improvements  of 
the  level  of  general  functioning  and  addiction-related 
problems were found. The findings regarding treatment 
compliance  are  contradictory.  The  available  data 
 indicate that patients from the DBT-SUD group make 
more use of group therapy compared with patients from 
the  control  group.  In  addition,  it  was found that  DBT 
patients  provided  more  plausible  information  about 
their  actual  substance 
intake,  showing  a  higher 
 correlation with objective urine sample data (Table 1).

Note  for  clinicians:  It  is  advantageous  to  start  the 
treatment  program  when  patients  are  not  in  a  state  of 
severe  crisis  and  do  not  use  large  amounts  of 
 substances,  since  learning  new  skills  to  regulate  their 
emotions and addictions requires an increased learning 
ability  of  the  affected  individuals.  It  is  possible  to 
search 
in  Germany  using,  for 
example, the contact form of the DBT umbrella associ-
ation:  www.dachverband-dbt.de.  (References:  23–25, 
manual in 26).

treatment  spaces 

Dynamic Deconstructive Psychotherapy (DDP)— 

DDP is one of the depth-psychological methods.

Fundamental principles: DDP combines elements of 
neuroscience,  object  relations  theory,  and  Derrida’s 
 deconstruction  philosophy.  The  treatment  of  BPD 

symptoms and the dependence disorder is provided at 
the same time.

Implementation:  Treatment  is  provided  in  four 
phases over a period of 12 months in weekly individual 
therapy sessions.

In  phase  1,  the  focus  is  on  establishing  therapeutic 
alliance.  Patients  learn  to  identify  and  verbalize  emo-
tional experiences. In phase 2, the affected individuals 
analyze  their  interpersonal  emotional  experiences  and 
become aware of their polarizing evaluations. In phase 
3 and 4, patients learn to become aware of their subjec-
tive interpretation and make their judgments closer to 
reality.  In  phase  4,  the  patients  learn  to  distance 
 themselves from idealizing phantasies.

Efficacy:  Currently,  one  study  on  DDP  is  available 
(Table 2), showing moderately positive, but not statisti-
cally significant effects on symptoms of both BPD and 
addiction.  The  dropout  rate  was  lower  for  DDP 
(Table 2).

Note for clinicians: DDP is almost unknown in Ger-
many; a central search tool for treatment spaces is not 
available. (References: 27–29, manual in 30).

Dual  Focus  Schema  Therapy  (DFST)—Schema 
therapy makes use of depth psychological and behav -
ioral therapy elements. The term “maladaptive schema” 
to  unfavorable  cognitive,  emotional  and 
refers 

Deutsches Ärzteblatt International | Dtsch Arztebl Int 2014; 111(16): 280–6

284 

behavior al  reflexes  shaped  by  memories,  feelings, 
thoughts,  and  behavioral  patterns.  Such  schemas  are 
 activated  by  key  stimuli  in  typical  situations,  guiding 
behavior  even  where  they  are,  directly  or  indirectly, 
detrimental to the affected individual.

Fundamental principles: Here again, the treatment of 
BPD  symptoms  and  the  dependence  disorder  is 
 provided at the same time. DFST postulates:

● that  failed  attempts  to  satisfy  important  basic 
needs  may  lead  to  the  development  of  maladap-
tive  schemas  and  harmful  coping  strategies  in 
young people.

● the existence of 18 distinct maladaptive schemas, 
each  of  which  can  be  assigned  to  1  of  5  over -
arching clusters. The patient–therapist team aims 
at 
these 
 schemas,  followed  by  perceiving  the  underlying 
basic  needs  and  satisfying  them  in  an  adequate 
manner.

identifying  and 

inhibiting 

initially 

● the  subclassifications  of  personality  disorders 
have no bearing on the work with schema therapy. 
Based on this approach, DFST logically interprets 
substance use as a maladaptive strategy for coping 
with moods or conflicts.

Implementation:  Treatment  with  DFST  combines 
personality-related  with  pragmatic  addiction-specific 
strategies.  These  include,  besides  relapse  prevention 
training, skills training with regard to interpersonal re-
lationships,  emotion  regulation,  stimulus  control,  and 
coping  with  craving,  as  well  as  methods  to  change 
schemas  and  coping  strategies.  The  implementation 
takes  place  in  individual  therapy  and  skills  training 
sessions.

Efficacy:  Presently, 3  RCTs on DFST are  available 
in which DFST is compared with general (31) and per-
sonalized  (33)  drug  counseling  and  an  Alcoholics 
Anonymous  12-step  program  modified  for  opioid  de-
pendent patients (32), respectively. All studies showed 
(uniformly across all groups) very high dropout rates of 
about  60%,  which  certainly  needs  to  be  interpreted 
against  the  background  of  each  treatment  setting 
(homeless  drop-in  center,  forensic  hospital).  Conse-
quently, there is little point in undertaking quantitative 
group  comparisons  between  these  studies.  Table  3 
 provides  a  solely  narrative  overview;  however,  these 
findings should be interpreted with great caution (Table 
3).

Note  for  clinicians:  To  search  for  treatment  spaces 
for DFST in Germany, the following website is avail-
able: www.verhaltenstherapie.de (31–33).

Conclusion
Only few data are available on the efficacy of pharma-
cotherapy or psychotherapy in this patient population. 
Recommendations  for  longer-term  pharmacotherapy 
are 
the  standard  addiction  medicine 
 approaches  and  the  treatment  of  emotion  regulation 
 disorders.  First  steps  towards  a  systematic  treatment 
using psychotherapy have been taken; however, further 
therapy research based on randomized controlled trials 

limited 

to 

M E D I C I N E

with larger patient populations is needed. It would, in 
particular,  be desirable that  independent  groups  of  re-
searchers  evaluate  the  various  methods.  Despite  the 
very  limited  data  presently  available,  it  should  be 
 recommended to use DBT-SUD, DDP or DFST, at least 
as  methods  of  psychotherapy.  All  available  studies 
 report  positive  developments  for  symptoms  of  both 
BPD and addiction with treatment over time, but it is 
currently not possible to postulate that a certain therapy 
should be preferred over others because of its superior-
ity. Likewise,  the  absence of solid  evidence  (compare 
DFST)  should  not  be  misinterpreted  as  proof  of  their 
lack of efficacy.

All 3 approaches have in common:
● the  therapists’  consistently  positive  attitude  of 

 appreciation,

● the therapists’ high levels of expertise in the treat-

ment of BPD and dependence disorders, 

● the separate offering of skills training and socio-

therapy, and

● the simultaneous treatment of both disorders.
Therapists  offering  one  of  the  three  methods 
 discussed above can achieve better treatment outcomes 
as  these  psychotherapies  have  a  systematic  treatment 
approach  for  which  special  scientific  and  supervisory 
expertise is at hand.
