ABSTRACT
Attachment insecurity (i.e., attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance) has been found to contribute 
to PTSD symptom severity in Veterans. However, little is known of the unique contribution of attachment 
insecurity  on  individual  PTSD  symptom  clusters.  In  a  community  sample  of  106  combat-deployed 
Veterans, active duty service members, and reservists, this study examined: (1) the relationships between 
childhood  family  experience,  combat  experience,  attachment  insecurity,  and  PTSD symptom  clusters, 
and (2) the influence of attachment insecurity on PTSD symptom clusters. Results revealed significant 
correlations between attachment anxiety and all PTSD symptom clusters (rs = .22 –.43) and attachment 
avoidance  and  PTSD  symptom  clusters,  except  the  avoidance  cluster  (rs  =  .21  −.36).  Four  multiple 
regression  analyses  were  employed  to  address  the  second  study  aim.  Childhood  family  experiences 
predicted negative alterations in cognitions and mood (β = –.30) and alterations in arousal and reactivity 
(β  =  –.20).  Further,  combat  experience  significantly  predicted  each  symptom  cluster  of  PTSD  (βs  = 
.03 –.44). In the second step, attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were added to each model. 
Attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance predicted negative alterations in cognitions and mood 
(βs = .22 and .35) and alterations in arousal and reactivity (βs = .27 and .17). Inconsistent with previous 
research,  attachment  insecurity  did  not  predict  symptoms  of  avoidance.  These  results  highlight  the 
impact of attachment among a diverse sample of trauma exposed individuals and may provide insights 
for clinical implications and therapeutic approaches when working with Veterans and military personnel 
high in attachment insecurity.

What  is  the  public  significance  of  this  article?—This 
paper  examines  the  influence  of  attachment  insecurity 
(i.e., attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance), while 
accounting  for  childhood  family  experiences  and  combat 
exposure among a community sample of military personnel 
and Veterans endorsing symptoms of posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD). Results revealed that attachment insecur-
ity predicted specific PTSD symptom clusters. These find-
ings  suggest  that  attachment  anxiety  and  attachment 
avoidance uniquely contribute to a range of PTSD sympto-
matology among those not engaging in treatment, and may 
be relevant to clinicians when encountering similar inter-
personal styles in treatment formulation. 

It  has  been long established  that the  parent-child rela-
tionship and other early experiences contribute to attach-
ment  style  in  childhood  (Ainsworth,  Blehar,  Waters,  & 
Wall,  1978;  Bowlby,  1973,  1988;  Mikulincer  &  Shaver, 
2012), and provide a blueprint for subsequent relationships 
in  adulthood  (Hong  &  Park,  2012).  In  fact,  attachment 

theory (Bowlby, 1969/1982, 1988) provides a valuable life-
span  developmental  framework  for  understanding  the 
mechanisms underlying coping with trauma, since experi-
encing trauma does not always lead to the development of 
PTSD  (Elwood,  Hahn,  Olatunji,  &  Williams,  2009).  In 
military  personnel  and  Veterans,  previous  studies  have 
drawn links between stressful or negative childhood events 
(e.g., sexual abuse, physical abuse, family instability; King, 
King,  Foy,  Keane,  &  Fairbank,  1999;  Lapp  et  al.,  2005; 
Merrill  et  al.,  1998;  Vogt  et  al.,  2011),  combat  exposure 
(e.g.,  Richardson,  Frueh,  &  Acierno,  2010)  and  posttrau-
matic  stress  disorder  (PTSD).  However,  there  is  limited 
research  examining  the  combined  impact  of  childhood 
experiences and combat exposure on attachment insecurity 
and PTSD symptom clusters.

An individual’s attachment orientation is believed to be 
the manifest patterns of care-seeking behavior that reflect 
the person’s internal working model of themselves, others, 
and the relational patterns that have emerged between the 
two (Bowlby, 1973). Bowlby (1988) delineated three terms

for conceptualizing a child’s attachment orientation. First, 
a  child  is  said  to  have  a  secure  attachment  orientation 
when caregivers provide a safe base for the child through 
consistency  and  availability,  especially  during  times  of 
perceived  danger  or  fear  (Ainsworth  et  al.,  1978; 
Alexander, 2009; Bowlby, 1978). Moreover, the child relies 
on  the  caregiver  to  be  attentive  and  supportive  in  novel 
situations, while also offering appropriate levels of com-
fort  (Ainsworth  et  al.,  1978).  A  child  is  said  to  have  an 
anxious  resistant  attachment  orientation  (henceforth 
referred  to  as  attachment  anxiety/anxious  attachment) 
when  the  caregiver  inconsistently  responds  to  their 
needs and they fear being abandoned. Consequently, the 
child is often overly clingy and is ambivalent about explor-
ing their environment. Next, an anxious avoidant attach-
ment  orientation  (henceforth  referred  to  as  attachment 
avoidance/avoidant attachment) results from a caregiver 
who consistently does not meet the child’s needs, dispos-
ing them to reject their need for close relationships and the 
support  of  others.  Researchers  have  identified  a  fourth 
orientation  (dismissive-disorganized)  embodying  charac-
teristics  of  both  anxious  resistant  and  anxious  avoidant 
orientations (George & Solomon, 1999). In sum, children 
exposed to an inconsistent or unsafe caregiver are unable 
to internalize a consistent working model to obtain secur-
ity, contributing to the development of an insecure attach-
ment  style  (Bowlby,  1973),  which  can  result  in  negative 
relational  beliefs,  emotional  difficulties,  and  psycho-
pathology (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2012, 2016).

Akin to secure infants and children, adults with a secure 
attachment style seek support from their partners, friends, 
or family (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016). Moreover, securely 
attached adults feel comfortable with intimacy, expressing 
themselves,  and  communicating  their  needs  to  others 
(Levine & Heller, 2011). Adults high in attachment anxiety 
can  experience  a  fluctuation  of  emotions,  feelings  of  jea-
lousy, and a preoccupation with reciprocity in relationships 
(Bartholomew, 1990; Hazan & Shaver, 1987), and may also 
engage  in  interpersonally  clingy  behaviors,  including  an 
overreliance or overdependence on others (Bowlby, 1978; 
Haak, Keller, & DeWall, 2017). Lastly, adults high in attach-
ment avoidance tend to be socially avoidant and exhibit fear 
of becoming attached to others (Bartholomew, 1990) result-
ing in discomfort with closeness, minimization of feelings 
(Kobak & Sceery, 1988), emotional detachment, and diffi-
culties trusting others (Hazan & Shaver, 1987; Sable, 1992).

Childhood family and combat experiences in service 
members and Veterans

Compared  to  the  general  population,  Veterans  report 
a  higher  number  of  negative  childhood  experiences 
(Blosnich,  Dichter,  Cerulli,  Batten,  &  Bossarte,  2014; 

McGuinness & Waldrop, 2015; Wolfe et al., 2005). Family 
environment may be a catalyst prompting military enlist-
ment. Research has suggested that enlistment may provide 
an  escape  from  an  unfavorable  or  dysfunctional  home 
environment,  particularly  among  male  ethnic  minorities 
(Blosnich  et  al.,  2014;  Bachman,  Segal,  Freedman-Doan, 
O’Malley, & Michigan Univ., 1998; Ivany & Hoge, 2015). 
Nontraditional family environments (e.g., single parent and 
step parent households; Spence, Henderson, & Elder, 2013) 
and low socioeconomic status and disadvantaged families 
(Kleykamp,  2006)  have  also  been  correlated  with  high 
enlistment,  with  lowest  enlistment  rates  observed  among 
intact  two-parent  households  (Bachman  et  al.,  1998). 
However, it should also be noted that positive experiences 
within military families have also been found to contribute 
to a youth’s desire to join the military (Gibson, Griepentrog, 
& Marsh, 2007).

For service members and Veterans, the military pro-
vides  a  sense  of  belonging,  social  connectedness,  and 
security  (Spence  et  al.,  2013;  Williams  et  al.,  2004). 
Understanding of attachment relationships may be espe-
cially important among service members during deploy-
ment.  For  example,  while  deployed,  service  members 
display  attachment-seeking  behaviors  demonstrated 
through  group,  team,  and  unit  cohesion  (Turner, 
Wood,  Parks,  &  Shafer,  2016);  social  connectedness 
may mitigate stressful events.

PTSD and attachment insecurity

In general, when someone with an insecure attachment 
orientation encounters a situation that they perceive as 
unsafe and appraise that they lack the resources to cope, 
they may have one of two reactions. If the individual is 
high  in  attachment  anxiety  and  believes  that  they  are 
unable  to  help  themselves,  they  may  become  very 
demanding  and  hyperactive  about  obtaining  the  love, 
care, and support of others (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003, 
2007),  which  can  result  in  hypervigiliance  surrounding 
the  attachment  figure’s  behaviors  until  the  individual 
perceives  that  support  is  available  (Mikulincer,  Shaver, 
&  Horesh,  2006).  The  authors  postulate  that  these 
hyperactivating  strategies  may  reactivate  the  traumatic 
event  due  to  deficits  in  coping  resources,  which  can 
interfere  with  the  individual’s  ability  to  work  through 
the 
(Mikulincer  et  al.,  2006). 
Collectively,  these  experiences  may  mirror  symptoms 
consistent  with  the  alteration  in  arousal  and  reactivity 
symptom  clusters  of  PTSD 
and 
(American  Psychiatric  Association,  2013).  In  contrast, 
if  the  individual  is  high  in  attachment  avoidance,  they 
may isolate from others and refuse to ask for, or accept 
emotional support, which may contribute to avoidance 

traumatic  event 

reexperiencing 

and emotional numbing (Mikulincer et al., 2006). These 
reactions  are  similar  to  symptoms  of  the  PTSD  avoid-
ance  and  negative  alterations  in  cognition  and  mood 
clusters (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Both 
reactions  enable  the  symptoms  of  PTSD,  because  they 
promote an oscillation between avoidance and intrusive 
recollections  of  the  trauma,  potentially  related  to 
changes  in  the  individual’s  assumptions  about  the 
world,  others,  and  their  ability  to  cope  with  traumatic 
experiences  (Janoff-Bulman,  1992),  and  may  increase 
the  likelihood  of  experiencing  those  specific  trauma- 
related symptoms.

Previous  studies  have  reported  significant  correla-
tions  between  higher  levels  of  attachment  anxiety  and 
attachment  avoidance  and  PTSD  symptom  severity 
among  military  and  civilian  populations  (e.g.,  Clark  & 
Owens,  2012;  Currier,  Holland,  &  Allen,  2012;  Dekel, 
Solomon, Ginzburg, & Neria, 2004; Dieperink, Leskela, 
Thuras,  &  Engdahl,  2001;  Escolas  et  al.,  2012;  Huang, 
Chen,  Su,  &  Kung,  2017;  Owens  et  al.,  2014;  Renaud, 
2008; Venta, Hatkevich, Mellick, Vanwoerden, & Sharp, 
2017).  Among  Veterans,  past  research  has  found 
a consistent relationship between attachment avoidance 
and  PTSD  severity  for  Vietnam  (Owens  et  al.,  2014; 
Renaud,  2008)  and  Operation  Enduring  Freedom/ 
Operation  Iraqi  Freedom  (Clark  &  Owens,  2012; 
Currier  et  al.,  2012;  Owens  et  al.,  2014)  Veterans  and 
active duty soldiers (Escolas et al., 2012), whereas attach-
ment  anxiety  has  demonstrated  a  more  inconsistent 
relationship  with  PTSD  severity.  However,  few  studies 
have examined the influence of attachment insecurity on 
specific PTSD symptom clusters and, to our knowledge, 
this  relationship  has  not  been  examined  in  a  Veteran 
population since the addition of the negative alterations 
in cognitions and mood cluster to the PTSD diagnosis in 
the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental 
Disorders-5th  Edition  (DSM-5;  American  Psychiatric 
Association, 2013).

Among  non-Veterans,  previous  research  has  found 
attachment insecurity to be associated with the intrusions 
and  avoidance  PTSD  symptom  clusters  (Bogaerts, 
Daalder,  Van  Der  Knaap,  Kunst,  &  Buschman,  2008; 
MacDonald  et  al.,  2008).  Such  findings  are  consistent 
with  the  assumptions  of  attachment  theory  and  how  an 
individual  high  in  attachment  anxiety  and  avoidance, 
respectively tend to cope with a perceived threat or danger 
(Mikulincer et al., 2006). Similarly, in a sample of former 
prisoners of war (POWs), those with an insecure attach-
ment style were more likely to have PTSD, and exhibited 
greater PTSD symptom severity in each of the symptom 
clusters  as  compared  to  those  with  a  secure  attachment 
style.  Attachment  style  was  also  a  stronger  predictor  of 
PTSD  symptoms  than  of  combat  exposure  (Dieperink

et  al.,  2001).  Although  these  finding  are  also  consistent 
with the theoretical underpinnings of attachment theory, 
such that a secure attachment style may buffer the dele-
terious  effects  of  trauma  (Mikulincer  et  al.,  2006),  they 
also emphasize the importance of considering the role of 
the attachment relationship in addition to combat experi-
ences on the development of PTSD.

Due  to  propensity  of  combat-deployed  Veterans 
and service members reporting high rates of negative 
family  experiences,  including  pre-military  trauma 
(Blosnich  et  al.,  2014;  King  et  al.,  1999;  Lapp  et  al., 
2005;  McGuinness  &  Waldrop,  2015;  Merrill  et  al., 
1998;  Wolfe  et  al.,  2005),  and  deployment-related 
trauma,  understanding  the  impact  of  attachment 
style may be particularly relevant among this popula-
tion.  Within  the  literature  specific  to  attachment,  as 
well as more broadly, researchers often examine PTSD 
in  military  and  Veteran  populations  without  investi-
gating  specific  pre-military  experiences  as  predictors 
of this post-trauma reaction. This potentially implies 
that  only  combat  experiences  directly  contribute  to 
PTSD,  without  considering  other  traumatic  experi-
ences  that  Veterans  encounter  at  higher  rates  than 
the  general  population,  such  as  childhood  abuse 
(Wolfe  et  al.,  2005).  Further,  this  overlooks  family 
environments  that  ill  prepare  the  Veteran  to  cope 
following  a  traumatic  experience  (King  et  al.,  1999; 
Vogt et al., 201). Expanding upon the limited research 
on  the  influence  of attachment  insecurity  in  trauma- 
exposed  Veterans,  active  duty  service  members,  and 
reservists,  the  current  study  examined  the  impact  of 
attachment  anxiety  and  attachment  avoidance  on 
symptom  clusters  of  PTSD.  We  hypothesized  that 
low  levels  of  optimal  childhood  family  functioning, 
high  levels  of  combat  experiences,  and  high  levels  of 
attachment insecurity would be significantly related to 
individual  symptom  clusters  of  PTSD.  We  also  pre-
dicted that dimensions of attachment insecurity would 
predict  symptom  clusters  of  PTSD  when  controlling 
for childhood and combat experiences.

Method

Procedure

Data was drawn from a larger study that was conducted 
following  review  and 
institutional  approval  at  the 
University of Houston. The larger study utilized multiple 
forms  of  participant  recruitment  (i.e.,  online  via  social 
media  and 
from 
February  2015  to  July  2016.  Eligibility  criteria  included 
current or previous enlistment in the United States mili-
tary, at least one deployment to a combat zone over the 

in  person)  and  was  conducted

past  25  years,  and  being  an  English  speaker.  Multiple 
strategies were employed to recruit a community sample 
of  combat  Veterans.  Some  participants  were  recruited 
internally,  through  college  courses  and  received  course 
credit  for  either  recruiting  a  combat  Veteran  who  met 
study criteria and completed the survey on their behalf, or 
for  completing  the  survey  themselves  if  they  met  study 
criteria.  Additionally,  agencies  were  contacted,  soliciting 
their  help  with  recruitment  by  providing  recruitment 
materials  to  Veterans  within  their  network/agency  elec-
tronically  (e.g.,  listservs  and  on  social  media  accounts) 
and/or  in  hard  copy.  Participants  were  also  recruited 
using a convenience snowball sampling method on social 
media  sites  (e.g.,  Facebook,  Reddit,  and  Tumblr).  All 
external  participants  received  a  5  USD  Starbucks  gift 
card  as  an  incentive  for  participation.  In  total,  47.2%  of 
participants  were  recruited  through  the  university  and 
52.8%  were  recruited  via  fliers,  listservs,  and  through 
social  media.  Additionally,  the  scope  of  this  study  was 
limited to male combat Veterans due to the variation in 
interpersonal  trauma  experiences  between  genders  (see 
Tolin & Foa, 2006), and trauma experiences that female 
Veterans commonly experience at higher rates than males 
(e.g.,  childhood  physical  and  sexual  assault:  Seifert, 
Polusny, & Murdoch, 2011; Wolfe et al., 2005; and mili-
tary sexual trauma:; Himmelfarb, Yaeger, & Mintz, 2006; 
Yaeger, Himmelfarb, Cammack, & Mintz, 2006).

All  participants  completed  demographic  items  and 

questionnaires via SurveyGizmo.

Participants

Data were collected from 195 male participants. A total 
of  80  participants  were  removed  from  analysis  due  to 
inattention (i.e., missing two or more attention checks; 
n = 67), invalid job title/rank (n = 11), or both (n = 2). 
The participants who were removed from analysis were 
not  significantly  different  from  those  included  in  ana-
lyses on age, race, marital status, branch, service status, 
or  era  of  service.  They  were,  however,  significantly 
higher on PTSD symptom severity (d = .75), attachment 
avoidance (d = .38) and anxiety (d = .39), but not combat 
or childhood experiences. These differences may be due 
to participants not appropriately attending to items. An 
additional nine participants were excluded from analysis 
due to incomplete or completely missing data either the 
Childhood  Family  Experiences  Scale  (n  =  8),  PTSD 
Symptom Checklist-5 (n = 1), the Combat Experiences 
Scale (n = 1), or multiple scales of interest (n = 2).

The  final  analysis  sample  included  106  participants, 
including Veterans (n = 71; 67%), active duty service mem-
bers  (n  =  16;  15.1%),  reservists  (n  =  17;  16%),  and  two 
participants whom declined to answer about their current 

military status. Their average total PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL- 
5) score was 25.88 (SD = 17.33, range 0– 73). One-third of 
the sample (n = 35) had a PCL above the clinical cut-point 
score  for  PTSD,  with  a  total  PCL  score  of  33  or  greater 
(Weathers et al., 2013). The average age of participants was 
34.64 years old (SD = 11.67). The majority of participants 
were  Caucasian  (56.6%)  and  in  a  relationship  (i.e.,  either 
married or in committed relationship (61.3%; see Table 1 
for full demographic information).

Measures

Deployment risk and resiliency inventory  2 (DRRI-2)
Participants  completed  two  scales  from  the  DRRI-2  for 
this study (Vogt, Smith, King, & King, 2012; Vogt et al., 
2013). The instrument was designed to assess psychoso-
cial  factors  that  have  implications  for  the  mental  health 
and wellbeing of war Veterans. The DRRI-2 contains 17 
different scales that can be administered independently or 
as a complete set.

Childhood family experiences scale (CFES). Childhood 
family  functioning  was  assessed  using  the  CFES,  a  12- 
item  self-report  scale  capturing  optimal  experiences  in 
regards  to  communication  and  closeness  with  family 
members during childhood (e.g., “I got along well with 
my  family  members”).  Participants  rated  items  on 
a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly 
agree),  with  higher  scores  indicating  more  positive 
childhood  family  experiences.  The  internal  consistency 
reliability  of  the  measure  is  .95  and  scaled  scores  have 
been  negatively  correlated  with  PTSD  severity  for  Iraq 
and  Afghanistan  war  Veterans  (Vogt  et  al.,  2013).  The 
internal consistency reliability in the current sample was 
identical to the validation study (α = .95).

Combat  experiences  scale  (CES). Combat  experiences 
were assessed using the CES, a 17-item self-report scale 
of combat-related circumstances (e.g., “I was exposed to 
hostile  incoming  fire”).  Participants  rated  items  on 
a  6-point  Likert  scale  (1  =  never to  6  = daily  or  almost 
daily), with higher scores indicating greater exposure to 
the aftermath of combat. The internal consistency relia-
bility  of  the  scale  among  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  war 
Veterans  is  .91  and  the  scale  positively  correlated  with 
PTSD  severity  (Vogt  et  al.,  2013).  Consistent  with  the 
validation  study,  the  internal  consistency  reliability  of 
the scale in this sample was excellent (α = .94).

Experiences in close relationships-short  form (ECR-S)
Attachment insecurity was assessed using the ECR-S, a 12- 
item  self-report  questionnaire  designed  to  assess  attach-
ment anxiety and attachment avoidance by asking respon-
dents about their general demeanor in close relationships 
(e.g., “I need a lot of reassurance that I am loved by my 
partner;”  Wei,  Russell,  Mallinckrodt,  &  Vogel,  2007). 
Participants  were  instructed  to  respond  to  items  on 
a 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly 
agree) based on how they “generally experience relation-
ships, not just in what is happening in a current relation-
ship”  (Wei  et  al.,  2007).  The  ECR-S  has  shown  good 
internal consistency with military samples for attachment 
anxiety (between .73 and .68) and attachment avoidance 
(between .81 and .77; Clark & Owens, 2012; Owens et al., 
2014).  The  current  sample  also  exhibited  good  internal 
consistency for both the attachment anxiety (α = .80) and 
avoidance (α = .84) subscales.

PTSD checklist-5 (PCL-5)
PTSD  symptom  cluster  severity  was  assessed  using  the 
PCL-5  (Weathers  et  al.,  2013).  The  PCL-5  is  a  20-item 
self-report  questionnaire  evaluating  the  degree  of  dis-
turbance related to a traumatic event(s) within the past 
month  using  the  DSM-5  criteria.  Participants  were

instructed to respond to items on a 5-point Likert scale 
according  to  the  degree  of  distress  (1  =  not  at  all  to 
5  =  extremely)  while  keeping  their  worst  very  stressful 
experience in mind. Although the PCL-5 does not pro-
vide a diagnosis of PTSD, a provisional diagnosis can be 
attained by treating items rated “2” or greater as an item 
endorsed for a specific symptom, endorsing the appro-
priate  number  of  symptoms  for  each  cluster  (i.e.,  1 
intrusion item, 1 avoidance item, 2 negative alterations 
in  cognitions  and  mood  items,  and  2  alterations  in 
arousal  and  reactivity  items),  and  a  having  total  above 
the clinical cut-point score of 33 (Weathers et al., 2013). 
The full scale  has  demonstrated strong internal  consis-
tency (α = .94) among trauma-exposed college students 
(Blevins, Weathers, Davis, Witte, & Domino, 2015) and 
Veterans  who  were  deployed  to  Iraq  or  Afghanistan 
(α  =  .96;  Hoge,  Riviere,  Wilk,  Herrell,  &  Weathers, 
2014).  The  four  subscales  representing  the  various 
symptoms  clusters  of  PTSD  also  demonstrated  high 
internal  consistency,  with  Cronbach’s  alpha  ranging 
from  .75  (alterations  in  arousal  and  reactivity)  to  .83 
(avoidance)  in  a  sample  of  treatment-seeking  active 
duty  service  members  (Wortmann  et  al.,  2016).  In  the 
current sample, the four subscales representing the var-
ious  symptoms  clusters  of  PTSD  also  demonstrated 
good to excellent internal consistency, with Cronbach’s 
alpha ranging from .83 (avoidance) to .93 (intrusions).

Data analytic plan

The  current  study  is  a  secondary  analysis  of  a  larger 
investigation.  Analyses  were  conducted  using  IBM 
SPSS  25.0.  First,  correlations  were  examined  among 
the  variables  of  interest.  To  examine  how  attachment 
anxiety and attachment avoidance were related to PTSD 
symptom  cluster  severity,  four  hierarchical  multiple 
regression analyses were conducted. As the contribution 
of  childhood  family  and  combat  experiences  has  been 
documented previously these variables were entered into 
the  equation  in  the  first  step.  Attachment  anxiety  and 
attachment avoidance were entered into the second step 
of the equation to examine the unique predictive quality 
of these variables on PTSD symptom cluster severity. To 
account for multiple analyses the Bonferroni correction 
was  used.  In  examining  the  overall  model  fit,  p  =  .013 
was used to determine model significance.

Results

Consistent  with  previous  literature  and  current  study 
hypotheses,  greater  attachment  anxiety  and  attachment 
avoidance  were  associated  with  greater  reported  severity 
of  the  PTSD  intrusion  symptoms,  negative  alterations  in 

384

cognitions  and  mood,  and  alterations  in  arousal  and 
reactivity  symptom  clusters  (rs  .21  –  .43,  ps  <  .05). 
Additionally, attachment anxiety was positively correlated 
with  self-reported  PTSD  avoidance.  Combat  experiences 
were  significantly  related  to  all  four  symptom  clusters  of 
PTSD  (rs  .37  –  .47,  ps  <  .01).  Partially  consistent  with 
expected  results,  positive  childhood  family  experiences 
were  negatively  correlated  with  the  negative  alterations 
in  cognitions  and  mood  and  alterations  in  arousal  and 
reactivity  symptom  clusters  (rs  –  .35  and  –  .26,  respec-
tively,  ps  <  .01).  However,  positive  childhood  family 
experiences  were  not  significantly  related  to  reported 
PTSD intrusion or avoidance symptoms (see Table 2).

Next,  multiple regressions were  conducted  to examine 
the  relationship  among  childhood  family  experiences, 
attachment  anxiety,  and  attachment  avoidance  as  they 
relate  to  the  PTSD  symptom  clusters  (see  Table  3). 
Regression analyses revealed partial support of the hypoth-
eses.  Consistent  with  hypotheses,  combat  and  childhood 
family  experiences  were  significantly  associated  with  all 
four  symptom  clusters.  Change  in  the  R2  was  calculated 
for  each  of  the  PTSD  symptom  clusters  to  determine 
whether after controlling for childhood and combat experi-
ences,  attachment  anxiety  and  attachment  avoidance 

significantly contributed to PTSD symptom cluster sever-
ity.  Attachment  anxiety  and  attachment  avoidance 
explained a significant proportion of variance for the nega-
tive alterations in cognitions and mood and alterations in 
arousal and reactivity, such that greater attachment anxiety 
and  attachment  avoidance  were  significantly  associated 
with  increased  negative  alterations  in  cognitions  and 
mood and alterations in arousal and reactivity symptoms. 
Neither  attachment  anxiety  nor  attachment  avoidance 
were  significantly  associated  with  intrusion  or  avoidance 
symptom  clusters  after  controlling  for  childhood  family 
and combat experiences.

Discussion

The current study examined the unique contribution of 
attachment  insecurity  on  PTSD  symptom  clusters  for 
a  community  sample  of  Veterans,  active  duty  service 
members,  and  reservists.  Although  the  current  study 
sample  was  not  recruited  from  a  mental  health  clinic, 
self-reported  symptoms  of  PTSD  as  measured  by  the 
PCL-5  suggested  that  approximately  one-third  of  the 
participants endorsed symptoms above the clinical cut-
off, suggesting probable PTSD among those participants.

Past  research  found  positive  associations  between 
attachment insecurity and overall PTSD symptom sever-
ity,  as  well  as  individual  symptom  clusters,  such  as  the 
intrusion and avoidance symptom clusters among various 
populations (e.g., Clark & Owens, 2012; Dieperink et al., 
2001; Huang et al., 2017; Venta et al., 2017). Aligned with 
past  research,  we  found  positive  relationships  between 
attachment insecurity and the intrusion symptoms, nega-
tive alterations in cognitions and mood, and alterations in 
arousal and reactivity clusters. Upon further examination, 
both  attachment  anxiety  and  attachment  avoidance  sig-
nificantly predicted negative alterations in cognitions and 
mood  and  alterations  in  arousal  and  reactivity.  These 
results suggest that individuals high in attachment anxiety 
and attachment avoidance may experience higher rates of 
self-blame,  negative  thoughts  and  emotions  related  to 
others, feeling distant or detached from others, hypervi-
gilance,  and  irritability  or  angry  outbursts  (American 
Psychiatric  Association,  2013;  Bartholomew,  1990; 
Hazan  &  Shaver,  1987;  Sable,  1992).  Consistent  with 
attachment  theory,  individuals  exposed  to  a  traumatic 
event who are high in attachment insecurity may experi-
ence changes in their beliefs about themselves, others, and 
the  world  in  regards  to  their  ability  to  cope  (Janoff- 
Bulman,  1992),  which  may  contribute  to  alterations  in 
mood  and  cognition  as  observed  in  PTSD.  This  finding 
may  be  especially  pronounced  among  those  high  in 
attachment avoidance due to the propensity to engage in 
emotionally numbing behaviors (Mikulincer et al., 2006).
Contrary to previous research (e.g., Bogaerts et al., 2008; 
Clark & Owens, 2012), the current study did not find that 
attachment anxiety or attachment avoidance predicted the 
PTSD  symptom  cluster  of  avoidance.  This  means  that 
within  our  sample,  tendencies  to  avoid  relying  on  others 
or overly rely on others for emotion regulation and support 
did  not  predict  tendencies  to  cognitively  or  behaviorally 
avoid reminders of trauma. There may be several explana-
tions  for  this  finding.  First,  the  current  study  utilized 
a  diverse  sample  recruited  from  the  community  rather 
than  a  treatment-seeking  sample.  Additionally,  although 
many  of  the  participants  endorsed  symptoms  of  PTSD 
greater  than  the  clinical  cutoff  for  probable  PTSD,  the 
majority of the sample did not. This could highlight impli-
cations  for  an  Other  Specified/Unspecified  Trauma  and 
Stressor Related disorder, in which individuals who experi-
ence negative childhood experiences and combat naturally 
recover from PTSD and experience less functional impair-
ment compared to a treatment-seeking sample. Lastly, this 
non-significant finding could suggest that attachment style 
may  have  less  impact  on  the  avoidance  PTSD  symptom 
cluster  after  controlling  for  childhood  family  experiences 
and combat trauma. This hypothesis is supported by corre-
found 
lational  analyses  of  the  current  study  that

a  significant  relationship  between  attachment  insecurity 
and PTSD avoidance. Instead, it is possible that symptom 
severity  within  this  cluster  is  more  strongly  impacted  by 
other  factors,  such  as  trauma  type.  The  findings  of  the 
current study highlight the importance of evaluating attach-
ment style  in Veterans,  active duty  service members,  and 
reservists  endorsing  symptoms  of  negative  alterations  in 
cognitions and mood and alterations in arousal and reac-
tivity,  as  they  may  be  experiencing  greater  preoccupation 
and difficulties regulating negative emotions in important 
relationships,  as  evidenced  in  a  community  sample. 
However, future research is needed and may seek to com-
pare  differences  in  attachment  style  among  those  seeking 
treatment  compared  to  those  who  are  not  seeking 
treatment.

that  significant  findings  were  observed 

Although the current study utilized a community sam-
ple,  the  findings  may  help  inform  clinicians  when  con-
sidering  the  influence  of  attachment  insecurity  on 
symptom  presentation  and  psychotherapy  options. 
Given 
in 
a  community  sample  with  a  range  of  PTSD  symptom 
severity,  it  is  possible  that  similar  results  would  emerge 
among  those  Veterans  and  military  personnel  seeking 
treatment  due  to  greater  functional  impairment  contri-
buting to treatment-seeking behavior. Understanding the 
impact of attachment insecurity on PTSD symptoms may 
emphasize  a  need  to  address  interpersonal  functioning, 
negative cognitions, and heightened arousal more directly 
among  individuals  seeking  treatment.  For  instance, 
Veterans,  active  duty  service  members,  and  reservists 
high  in  attachment  anxiety  and  attachment  avoidance 
may benefit from interventions incorporating interperso-
nal skills development (e.g., group-focused interventions, 
couples’  therapy).  These  interventions  could  potentially 
facilitate  more  effective  relationship  functioning,  aid  in 
restructuring  negative  attachment-based  belief  systems, 
and  bolster  confidence  when  interacting  with  others. 
The use of closed group interventions may be particularly 
useful with a military population due to past experiences 
operating as a unit and through the consistency offered by 
a closed versus open group in facilitating the revision of 
attachment-related  beliefs.  Consequently,  incorporating 
such  interventions  may  have  the  potential  to  indirectly 
address negative alterations in cognitions and mood and 
alterations in arousal and reactivity associated with inter-
personal functioning. However, due to the cross-sectional 
nature of  the  current study,  we  are  unable  to  determine 
the causal relationship between attachment insecurity and 
PTSD  symptoms.  As  a  result,  rather  than  interventions 
aimed  at  improving  an  individual’s  attachment-related 
beliefs,  treatment  addressing  trauma-focused  cognitions 
may similarly positively impact attachment-related cogni-
tions and difficulties. Future research should examine the 

386

effect  of  such  interventions  on  treatment  outcomes 
among a similar population endorsing attachment anxiety 
and attachment avoidance.

Limitations & future directions

Whereas much of the previous literature examining PTSD 
in  Veterans  and  military  personnel  focuses  on  differing 
military statuses separately, this study utilized a combined 
and diverse sample of Veterans, active duty service mem-
bers, and reservists. However, examining these groups con-
jointly  may  also  be  a  limitation,  as  Veterans,  service 
members, and reservists may have different military experi-
ences and may be impacted by their attachment relation-
ships in different ways depending upon their military status 
at  the  time  the  study  was  conducted.  For  instance,  the 
importance  of  secure  attachments  within  the  context  of 
unit cohesion may be more important among active duty 
service members as compared to Veterans. Future research 
may  aim  to  replicate  this  study,  comparing  the  effect  of 
attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance across mili-
tary status, as the importance (e.g., unit cohesion) and types 
(i.e.,  spouse,  children,  battle  buddies)  of  attachment  rela-
tionship may vary across military service status. Moreover, 
subsequent  research  may  compare  each  of  these  three 
groups  on  self-reported  attachment  difficulties  post- 
trauma and examine the impact on overall PTSD symptom 
severity and symptom clusters. Future research should also 
expand upon these data with treatment-seeking Veterans, 
active duty service members, and reservists as our sample 
may not be generalizable to a clinical sample due to only 
one-third of participants endorsing trauma-related symp-
toms  above  the  clinical  cut  off  for  probable  PTSD.  As 
a result, clinicians may see a greater severity of these symp-
toms  and  interpersonal  difficulties  among  those  seeking 
treatment.  An  additional  limitation  of  the  current  study 
was that we excluded females from participation. This was 
done  because  the  variation  in  traumatic  experiences 
between genders would have introduced an additional con-
found within this domain of inquiry. However, the impact 
of  attachment  insecurity  on  PTSD  symptom  clusters 
among  female  Veterans  and  service  members  should  be 
examined in future research.

As this was a secondary analysis of self-report mea-
sures,  we  were  unable  to  determine  a  specific  index 
trauma or assess for the presence of depressive symp-
toms.  An  additional  limitation of the  current study  was 
that  no  formal  verification  of  current  or  past  military 
experience  was  required  to  participate.  However,  strict 
validity  items  of  military  specific  experiences  were 
embedded  within  the  demographics  questionnaire  to 
increase  validity.  Future 
request 
Certification  of  Release  of  Discharge  from  Active  Duty 

research  could 

(i.e.,  DD  214)  to  further  validate  military  service  within 
a community sample. Relatedly, approximately one-third 
of participants had their data removed from analyses due 
to failed attention and validity checks, which may suggest 
that  they  were  not  appropriately  attending  to  survey  or 
did not find the questions of interest or worth completing 
accurately.  This  may  be  related  to  the  variety  of  survey 
methods  employed,  as  some  participants  may  not  have 
been  Veterans  and  completed  the  survey  because  they 
were extrinsically  motivated  for  course credit  or the  gift 
card,  rather  than  intrinsically  motivated  based  on  their 
personal experiences. Additionally, several questionnaires 
utilized  in  the  larger  study  included  questions  requiring 
detailed questions/responses about traumatic experiences 
and trauma-related guilt. These questions may have been 
distressing to participants, resulting in non-completion of 
the remainder of the survey.

Based  on  a  priori  power  testing  the  regression  ana-
lyses  were  slightly  under  powered;  however,  the  effect 
sizes  found were  medium  to  large  suggesting the  small 
sample  size  may  not  have  affected  the  findings.  Lastly, 
due  to  the  small  sample  size  and  number  of  analyses 
performed, no control variables were added to the ana-
lyses.  As  a  result,  it  is  unclear  how  demographic  vari-
ables,  such  as  race,  who  raised  the  participant,  era  of 
military  service,  have  impacted  the  results.  Future 
research should explore these impacts.

Due  to  the  impact  of  childhood  family  functioning 
and combat experiences on later development of PTSD 
(Clark & Owens, 2012; Currier et al., 2012; Huang et al., 
2017; Venta et al., 2017; Vogt et al., 2011), coupled with 
increased  exposure  to  multiple  traumatic  experiences 
among  Veterans  and  military  personnel  (Blosnich 
et  al.,  2014;  McGuinness  &  Waldrop,  2015;  Wolfe 
et  al.,  2005),  it  is  important  to  understand  the  impact 
of  attachment  insecurity  on  subsequent  functioning. 
Whereas  Veterans  and  military  personnel  high  in 
attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance may still 
experience  trauma-related  symptoms,  they  may  not 
experience  functional  impairment  resulting  in  treat-
ment-seeking  behavior.  Moreover,  the  non-significant 
influence  of  attachment  anxiety  and  attachment  avoid-
ance on PTSD avoidance in the current sample may lend 
additional support to the role of attachment security on 
tempering  PTSD  symptom  severity,  particularly  in 
symptom  clusters  associated  with  greater  interference 
in daily functioning, such as avoidance. Future research 
should further examine this impact.

In summary, we found that experiencing high levels of 
attachment  anxiety  and  attachment  avoidance,  can  con-
tribute to severity of PTSD negative alterations in cogni-
tions and mood and alterations in arousal and reactivity, 
regardless  of  childhood  family  functioning  and  combat 

experiences in Veterans, active duty service members, and 
reservists. These findings speak to the importance of the 
contribution  of  attachment  anxiety  and  attachment 
avoidance on symptoms of PTSD over and above child-
hood  experiences  and  combat  trauma.  Application  to 
a  clinical  sample  may  involve  incorporating  assessment 
of  attachment  style,  which  could  facilitate  clinicians  in 
conceptualizing cases to inform treatment recommenda-
tions to best ameliorate presenting complaints.
