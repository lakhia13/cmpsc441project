Abstract

With the Food and Drug Administration designation in 2017 of 3,4-methylenedi-
oxymethamphetamine  (MDMA)  as  a  breakthrough  therapy  in  post-traumatic 
stress  disorder  and  psilocybin  in  treatment-resistant  depression,  psychedelic 
drugs have continued to garner the attention of researchers and clinicians for their 
promise  of  unmatched,  rapid  improvement  in  a  multitude  of  psychiatric 
conditions.  Classic  psychedelic  drugs  including  psilocybin,  lysergic  acid 
diethylamide, and ayahuasca, as well as non-classic drugs such as MDMA and 
ketamine,  are  currently  being  investigated  for  a  potential  therapeutic  role  in 
trauma, depressive disorders, and other psychopathologies. However, psilocybin 
and  MDMA  each  have  a  functional  profile  well-suited  for  integration  with 
psychotherapy.  The  present  review  focuses  on  psilocybin  and  MDMA  in 
psychedelic-assisted  therapy  (PAT),  as  these  studies  compose  most  of  the 
literature  pool.  In  this  review,  we  discuss  the  current  and  future  uses  of 
psychedelic drugs, with an emphasis on the role of MDMA and psilocybin in PAT 
in the setting of trauma and related comorbidities on the efficacy of psychedelic 
drugs across multiple psychiatric disorders. The article concludes with thoughts 
for  future  research,  such  as  incorporating  wearables  and  standardization  of 
symptom scales, therapy styles, and assessment of adverse drug reactions.

INTRODUCTION

The psychedelic renaissance of modern psychiatry can trace its resurgence to 2017-2018, when the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) designated breakthrough therapy status to psilocybin in treatment-
resistant  depression  and  3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA)  in  post-traumatic  stress 
disorder (PTSD). Psychedelics can be broadly categorized as classic psychedelics that act as agonists at 
the 5-HT2A receptor [i.e., psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ayahuasca/dimethyltryptamine], 
empathogens that increase serotonin levels (i.e., MDMA), antagonists at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors 
(i.e.,  ketamine),  and  atypical  hallucinogens  with  effects  across  neurotransmitter  systems[1,2]. 
Psychedelic-assisted  psychotherapy  (PAT)  involving  MDMA  or  psilocybin  composes  most  of  the 
literature pool, though studies involving other psychopathologies and compounds have also been 
investigated to a lesser extent. The predominance of both psilocybin and MDMA in the literature may 
be attributed to the properties that make each an ideal adjunct to psychotherapy.

Psilocybin  and  its  active  metabolite  psilocin  are  derived  from  psychoactive  mushroom  species 
originally used in ceremonial settings to facilitate spiritual experiences in Central and South America, 
later introduced to Western culture in the 1950s[1,3]. As a classic psychedelic, psilocybin is a 5-HT2A 
receptor agonist that was found to produce rapid yet enduring improvement in treatment-resistant 
depression and major depressive disorder (MDD)[4-6]. More recently, psilocybin was compared to 
escitalopram in a double-blind trial. Both treatments were found to have similar efficacy in depression, 
which will be discussed in more detail in the present article[7].

Psilocybin further enhances its synergism with psychotherapy by evoking a sense of unity, ego-
dissolution, and awe through “mystical” experiences[8-10]. As described by Vaid et al[11] (2022), PAT 
may enable the processing of emotional experiences that were previously inaccessible due to trauma 
blocks. This promotes reconnection with the self and “foundational identity deficit repair,” a re-stabil-
ization of the core ideas that together represent the conscious identity, self-esteem, and other aspects of 
the  self[11]. As  will  be  described  later  in  this  article,  patients  in  recent  studies  report  significant 
reductions  in  symptom  rating  scales,  with  benefits  partly  attributed  to  this  mystical  component-
experiences of oneness or ego-dissolution, connection to self-essence, and a broadened perspective 
beyond self-imposed limits on thought processes and rigid mental frameworks that may once have been 
adaptive responses to life events[12,13].

MDMA was initially developed by Merck & Co. for hemostasis in 1912, and its psychoactive effects 
were not published until 1978. After becoming popularized as recreational drug “ecstasy” in the 1980s
[1,14,15], the  Drug  Enforcement  Agency  cited  concerns  of  abuse  potential  and  neurotoxicity  and 
assigned  schedule  I  status  to  MDMA  in  1985.  MDMA  is  part  of  a  class  of  psychedelics,  termed 
empathogens or enactogens, that increase empathy and social connection. Its effects are primarily 
mediated by serotonergic activity, including serotonin/norepinephrine transporter reuptake inhibition 
and partial agonism of serotonin receptors (5-HT2A, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C)[1]. By far, MDMA studies formed 
most of the research elicited by the PubMed search terms. The reasons for the clear bias in the literature 
and  its  consequences  are  varied  and  discussed  in  the  future  directions  section.  Nevertheless,  the 
research has yielded promising results across psychopathologies, though most research aligns with its 
FDA designation for PTSD. A recent double-blind, phase 3 clinical trial found that 67% of participants 
receiving  MDMA-assisted  psychotherapy  no  longer  met  PTSD  criteria  after  2  mo[16]. These 
improvements are attributed to several downstream changes in cognition that further complement 
psychotherapy.

Fonseka LN et al. Role of psilocybin and MDMA

MDMA has been previously shown to decrease amygdala response when patients are presented with 
angry faces, as well as increase ventral striatum response when viewing happy faces, further supporting 
that MDMA reduces threat response, enhances reward, and facilitates positive social interactions[1,17,
18]. MDMA has the reputation of generating feelings of closeness, connection, and emotional empathy, 
although similar features also exist in classic psychedelics[19,20]. However, MDMA uniquely offers 
augmentation of the therapeutic alliance, easefully lowering barriers and enabling the patient to process 
traumatic memories without feeling overwhelmed[1,21].

MDMA,  psilocybin,  and  other  psychedelics  appear  to  induce  a  temporary  period  of  increased 
neuroplasticity  with  associated  changes  in  psychological  flexibility[21,22]. Psilocybin  studies  have 
demonstrated increased neurogenesis, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis that facilitate the recondi-
tioning of fear memory and the reversal of stress-induced changes to the prefrontal cortex[23-25]. The 
plasticity counters the deficits in fear memory extinction seen in PTSD, alleviating distress from the 
cycle of avoidance and flashbacks associated with persistent traumatic memories[26-28]. Kéri et al[29] 
suggest that psychedelic-induced serotonin-glutamate interactions affect memory pathways responsible 
for memory destabilization and reconsolidation[29]. The neuroplastic and fear memory changes enrich 
the benefits drawn from combination with psychotherapy.

The present focus is on psychedelics involved in PAT, namely MDMA and psilocybin as these studies 
compose much of the literature pool. A literature review was conducted through PubMed database 
search of ((psilocybin) OR (MDMA)) AND (trauma). The search was also performed on Reference 
Citation Analysis (https://www.referencecitationanalysis.com/). The aim is to summarize the literature 
on psychedelic drugs, with an emphasis on the role of MDMA and psilocybin in PAT in the setting of 
trauma and related depressive disorders, from 2020 to 2022, bridging the gap from Reiff et al’s review 
encompassing articles from 2007 to 2019 on the efficacy of psychedelic drugs across multiple psychiatric 
disorders[1]. The article concludes with thoughts for future research, such as incorporating wearables 
and standardization of symptom scales, therapy styles, and assessment of adverse drug reactions.

PSILOCYBIN

With  its  FDA  designation  for  treatment-resistant  depression,  it  follows  to  begin  the  discussion  of 
psilocybin with updates in depression, a common comorbidity in trauma-related conditions. Carhart-
Harris et al[7] published a clinical trial comparing psilocybin vs escitalopram in 59 patients with MDD
[7]. The psylocibin group (n = 30) received 25 mg of psilocybin at the start and a second dose at 3 wk, all 
while receiving 6 wk of daily placebo. The escitalopram group (n = 29) received 1 mg of psilocybin at 
the start and a second dose of 1 mg at 3 wk, with daily oral escitalopram 10 mg throughout the 6-wk 
study. The primary outcome measure was changes from baselines scores (range 0 to 27) on the quick 
inventory of depressive symptomatology (QIDS-SR-16), with a response defined as reduction in score of 
at least 50% and remission defined as a score of 5 or less.

A  response  occurred  in  70%  of  the  psilocybin  group  and  48%  of  the  escitalopram  group,  while 
remission occurred in 57% of the psilocybin group and 28% of the escitalopram group. Although these 
differences do not reach significance, it is notable that both psilocybin and escitalopram appear, at a 
minimum, to have equivalent impacts. The lack of control group prevents the comparison of each 
treatment to a baseline population, but it is promising that the efficacy is similar between psilocybin and 
escitalopram. The authors report that while the initial trial design included a placebo group, this became 
too  practically  complex  and  expensive.  Other  limitations  of  the  study  include  the  duration,  as 
escitalopram may require more time to display its full efficacy. Additionally, the patients in the trial 
were not from varying socioeconomic or ethnic backgrounds, limiting external validity. The study also 
included many secondary outcomes, including scores on other symptom scales, but these were not 
considered useful as the data were unadjusted for multiple comparisons.

Further  analysis  of  the  study  was  conducted  by  Murphy  et  al[30]  regarding  the  influence  of 
therapeutic alliance. It was found that increased strength of therapeutic alliance led to greater emotional 
breakthrough  and  mystical  experiences  across  two  PAT  sessions[30]. Interestingly,  the  average 
symptom severity scores at baseline were in the range for moderate depression[7], highlighting an 
additional application for psilocybin beyond treatment-resistant depression.

In a patient population with moderate to severe MDD, Davis et al[31] performed an 8-wk intervention 
consisting of two psilocybin dosing sessions less than two weeks apart with supportive psychotherapy. 
Exclusion  criteria  illustrate  the  reduced  the  severity  of  depression  within  the  sample  population: 
Selected patients were screened to avoid current antidepressant use, past diagnosis with a psychotic 
disorder, serious suicide attempts, or prior psychiatric hospitalization. However, enrolled patients 
required a score of at least 17 on the GRID-Hamilton depression rating scale (GRID-HAMD), the scale 
used to evaluate outcomes in this study at weeks 1 and 4 post-treatment with psilocybin. A total of 27 
patients were selected and randomized into an immediate-treatment group (weeks 1-4, n = 14) and 
delayed-treatment group (weeks 5-8, n = 12), which served as a waiting list control condition that later 
received PAT as well. At baseline, the mean GRID-HAMD score was 22.8 with SD 3.9. Patients receiving 
immediate treatment showed significant reductions at weeks 1 and 4, with mean scores returning at 8.0

(SD 7.1) during week 1 and 8.5 (SD 5.7) at week 4. Overall, 17 patients demonstrated reductions in 
GRID-HAMD scores of at least 50%, 14 patients went into remission, and 3 patients dropped out before 
completing the intervention. Although preliminary, the effect sizes seen with psilocybin in this trial are 
several times larger than that seen in psychotherapy or antidepressant monotherapy[31-33].

The efficacy of psilocybin seen in depression studies likely offers benefits in a trauma-centered 
approach,  due  to  the  widespread  comorbidity  of  trauma  with  depressive  disorders.  The  role  of 
psilocybin continues to expand outside its FDA designation for treatment-resistant depression. Khan et 
al[34] reported on an open-label study that provided psilocybin-assisted therapy in traumatized AIDS 
survivors. The authors noted reductions in PTSD symptoms, attachment anxiety, and demoralization. 
The  intent  underlying  psychedelic  use  appears  to  be  important.  One  survey  demonstrated  that 
therapeutic intent behind past psychedelic use in patients with history of child maltreatment showed 
significant reductions in complex trauma symptoms and internalized shame[35]. This further suggests 
that  psilocybin’s  benefits  extend  beyond  depression  and  into  trauma-related  pathologies.  Though 
outside the scope of the present article, psilocybin is being explored across several domains including 
substance use disorders, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease[36].

Adverse reactions
In the psilocybin and escitalopram study, the escitalopram group had a higher prevalence of anxiety, 
dry mouth, sexual dysfunction, and reduced emotional responsiveness. Due to these side effects, four 
patients self-discontinued the medication and one patient modified regimen to half a daily dose. No 
patients in the psilocybin group requested dose adjustment or discontinuation[7]. In the trial by Davis et 
al[31], participants reported mild-to-moderate headache, as well as difficult emotions during in-session 
time only. No serious adverse events were reported or observed[31].

MDMA

In 2021, Mitchell et al[16] reported data from a double-blind, phase 3 clinical trial found that 67% of 
participants receiving MDMA-assisted psychotherapy ceased to meet PTSD criteria after 2 mo[16]. The 
MDMA-treated group (n = 46) showed significant decreases on clinician-administered PTSD Scale for 
DSM-5 (CAPS-V) compared to inactive placebo with therapy (n = 44). Participants attended three 
experimental sessions, spaced four weeks apart. The first session started with 80 mg MDMA and the 
option for a supplemental half-dose of 40 mg, 1.5-2.5 h later. For the next two sessions, the initial dose 
was increased to 120 mg with supplemental half-dose of 60 mg. No tolerability issues led to participants 
being withheld the supplemental doses.

MDMA-assisted therapy led to increases in posttraumatic growth, encompassing increased positivity 
towards self-perception, relationships, or philosophy of life[37]. Scores from 60 participants, pooled 
from three phase 2 clinical studies meeting PTSD criteria, were assigned to treatment with 75-125 mg 
MDMA  (n  =  45)  or  active  control  (0-40  mg  MDMA,  n  =  15).  The  MDMA  group  had  significantly 
improved  scores  on  the  posttraumatic  growth  inventory  and  greater  reduction  in  PTSD  symptom 
severity  at  12  mo,  and  67%  of  participants  no  longer  met  criteria  for  PTSD.  MDMA  may  promote 
adaptive stress responses in PTSD that lead to the downstream benefits seen in recent research, such as 
reduced ratings of PTSD symptom severity by clinicians[38,39].

MDMA has also been studied in the setting of couples therapy, in which one partner has a current 
diagnosis of PTSD. One study included 6 romantic dyads, in which both partners received MDMA 
followed by couples’ cognitive behavioral therapy. This led to improved happiness and significant 
reductions across PTSD symptoms, as unanimously rated by patient, partner, and clinician[40]. Further 
analysis of this study found enduring improvements in post-traumatic growth, social intimacy, and 
relational support at 6-mo follow up[41].

These benefits extend to common comorbidities seen in PTSD such as depression[42], substance use
[43] and sleep disorders[44], with improvements in Pittsburgh sleep quality index scores that remained 
significant at one-year follow up. MDMA also shows promise in various other psychopathologies 
including eating disorders[45] and end of life anxiety associated with life-threatening illness[46], in 
which patients reported increased ability to cope as they faced illness and existential fears, as well as 
overall improved quality of life. See Table 1 for a summary of relevant articles discussed in the above 
psilocybin and MDMA sections.

Adverse reactions
Mitchell et al[16] concluded that MDMA was safe and well-tolerated and note that the treatment did not 
induce abuse potential, suicidality, or QT prolongation[16]. Other studies show that risk factors for 
developing  hyperthermia  may  include  adolescent  age  and  increased  alcohol  consumption[47-49]. 
Hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis are likely context-dependent, occurring at lower frequency when 
used with therapeutic intent rather than recreational use in the setting of other risk factors[47,50]. 
Likewise,  the  “come  downs”  previously  associated  following  MDMA  use  may  be  due  to  research 
confounds related to environment and drug sourcing, as clinically administered MDMA has noticeably

lacked this side effect[51]. Other reports in the literature include hepatotoxicity that improved with 
vitamin E[52], and a case of spinal cord injury suspected to be due to the serotonin surge induced by 
MDMA, as the vasoconstrictive properties of serotonin may have induced ischemia[53].

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Dual therapy
As the evidence for each treatment builds independently, the future may include the integration of both 
treatments in sequence. In this scenario, MDMA would likely be used first as it has a larger influence on 
building  therapeutic  alliance.  The  augmented  therapeutic  alliance  would  allow  for  a  potentially 
improved psilocybin experience upon switching at next session, aligning with previously discussed 
research  that  strong  therapeutic  alliances  are  associated  with  greater  mystical  experiences  and 
emotional  breakthroughs.  Treatment  with  MDMA  has  been  associated  with  persistent  depressive 
symptoms, and the antidepressant effects of psilocybin may alleviate this following administration[42]. 
In a model described by Oehen and Gasser[54], MDMA tended to be used in the first phase to build the 
therapeutic alliance and increase the patient’s openness to change, leading to enhanced resilience and 
lowered  stress  levels.  Once  further  changes  were  noticed,  such  as  improved  self-regulation,  less 
negative self-perception, and increased tolerance to trauma exposure, LSD was introduced to assist 
psychotherapy. The deepening of the therapeutic process led to improvement per clinical judgment, 
without adverse events.

Standardization
Although variation in research methodology is needed to enrich the literature pool, standardization in 
several aspects may allow for more informed comparisons between treatment modalities. Symptom 
rating scales for depression (i.e, QIDS-SR, GRID-HAMD) and PTSD (i.e, CAPS-IV, CAPS-V) varied, with 
some studies using subjective reports of PTSD diagnostic criteria. Similarly, the therapy modalities that 
accompanied psychedelic administration were diverse, including uniquely developed forms of therapy 
as in the accept-connect-embody manualized therapy developed in a psilocybin trial[7,30], supportive 
therapy[31], and  couples’  cognitive  behavioral  therapy[40]. The  future  may  look  more  like  the 
manualized MDMA-assisted therapy provided through public benefit corporation Multidisciplinary 
Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). MAPS also has an ethics code, a vital addition to future

protocols as patients are placed in a state of increased suggestibility and affective instability during and 
after the treatment[55]. This critical period requires a trauma-informed approach to care, with support 
for transgender and gender diverse patients[56]. Lastly, the method of eliciting adverse drug reactions 
may benefit from standardization. Studies varied in terms of asking open-ended questions, prompting 
for specific symptoms, and documenting clinical observations. It is comforting that current studies have 
not shown any serious adverse events, and future studies may benefit by drawing upon a standardized 
set of common symptoms.

Wearables
Wearable technology has previously demonstrated efficacy as a bridge between patients and providers 
in mental health, such as in MDD, dementia, schizophrenia[57-59]. Wearables are likewise being used in 
non-psychiatric contexts, including medical monitoring in oncology and gastroenterology[60,61]. It 
follows that wearables may have clinical utility in monitoring patient symptoms during and after PAT. 
Daily functioning, including wearable-derived sleep and activity data, is incorporated in a protocol 
examining the effects of microdosed psychedelics and may be a useful metric to track long term changes 
following psychedelic treatment[62].

CONCLUSION

The literature on PAT using psilocybin or MDMA is strongly supportive across psychiatric conditions, 
especially trauma and related comorbidities. Both treatments seem to have benefits beyond the FDA 
breakthrough designations of treatment-resistant depression for psilocybin and PTSD for MDMA. As 
adjuncts to psychotherapy, psilocybin and MDMA show a pattern of rapid and sustained symptom 
relief. Future studies may consider the advantages of a standardized approach to symptom rating 
scales, therapy styles, and assessment of adverse drug reactions. Wearables may also offer additional 
metrics to examine the long-term trends in activity and sleep. As clinical trials continue to show positive 
results,  providers  and  patients  become  closer  to  seeing  the  effects  translate  to  the  clinic  and  the 
community.
