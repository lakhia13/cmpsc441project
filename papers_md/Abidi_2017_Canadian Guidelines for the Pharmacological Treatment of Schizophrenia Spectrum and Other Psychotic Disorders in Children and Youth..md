Abstract
Objective: Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders often have their onset in adolescence. The sequelae of
these illnesses can negatively alter the trajectory of emotional, cognitive, and social development in children and youth if left
untreated. Early and appropriate interventions can improve outcomes. This article aims to identify best practices in the
pharmacotherapy management of children and youth with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

Methods: A systematic search was conducted for published guidelines for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum dis-
orders in children and youth (under age 18 years). Recommendations were drawn from the National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence guidelines on psychosis and schizophrenia in children and youth (2013 and 2015 updates). Current guidelines
were adopted using the ADAPTE process, which includes consensus ratings by a panel of experts.

Results: Recommendations identified covered a range of issues in the pharmacotherapy management of children and youth
with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Further work in this area is warranted as we continue to further understand their
presentation in the developing brain.
Conclusions: Canadian guidelines for the pharmacotherapy management of children and youth with schizophrenia spectrum
disorders are essential to assist clinicians in treating this vulnerable population. Ongoing work in this area is recommended.

Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders are
illnesses that carry significant morbidity and mortality for
those affected. These illnesses often have their onset in ado-
lescence and can significantly interfere with the normal tra-
jectory of development. Early interventions with appropriate
and stage-specific psychological and pharmacological mod-
alities can, however, lead to better and, in some, optimal
outcomes in this population. The following recommenda-
tions were developed to assist clinicians in providing phar-
macological interventions for children and youth up to the
age of 18 years (termed early onset) with schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorders. The recommenda-
tions and associated discussions were drawn from a number
of sources, with the greatest weight placed on evidence
based on randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews
available in this age range as well as consensus statements

reflecting good clinical practice. These guidelines can be
used with reference to our similar chapter for adults,1 with
particular emphasis here placed on a differential approach to
pharmacological treatment for children and youth. In out-
lining these items, the working group has drawn primarily
from the 2013 National Institute for Health and Care Excel-
lence (NICE) guidelines for the treatment of psychosis and
schizophrenia in young people.2 The term “psychosis” in
these guidelines refers to the group of psychotic disorders
characterized by hallucinations or delusions and experiences
that alter perception, thoughts, emotionality, and behaviour,
all of which can markedly impair the trajectory of social,
emotional, and physical health of a young person. These dis-
orders include primarily schizophrenia but also schizoaffec-
tive disorder, schizophreniform, and delusional disorder. The
key features that define these illnesses in youth and adults and
assist in confirming an accurate and reliable diagnosis are
outlined in our guidelines for the assessment and diagnosis
of patients with schizophrenia and other spectrum disorders.1,3
As with all mental disorders, schizophrenia spectrum and
other psychotic disorders in youth are identified on the basis
of clinical features. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V)4 emphasizes a
dimensional perspective of symptom presentation that is par-
ticularly applicable to children and youth, recognizing that
symptom domains for psychosis can differ depending on the
age and stage of development and can potentially be a man-
ifestation of multiple diagnostic categories. That is to say
that children and youth’s interpretation of internal and exter-
nal perceptual experiences can be influenced greatly by fac-
tors such as intellect and emotional maturity as well as by
exposure to developmental stressors, environmental triggers,
cultural dynamics, and family belief systems. The perception
of a psychotic experience can in fact be a normal variant for
very young children5 and indeed in isolation is relatively
common and clinically benign even in adolescents, occur-
ring in 15% to 20% in some studies.6 Furthermore, the per-
ception of a psychotic experience may be the manifestation
of a medical etiology or other psychiatric causes such as
primary mood or anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive
disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder.5 Clinicians thus
need to be aware that while many adults with schizophrenia
report the initial onset of symptoms prior to age 18 years,7
the interpretation of the clinical significance of the psychotic
experience in childhood and adolescence is complex. These
factors emphasize the need for diagnostic diligence when
evaluating children and youth seeking help for psychotic
experiences: the experience may be significant for other ill-
nesses that benefit from interventions specific to that etiol-
ogy but may also, at the same time, herald a risk for the onset
of the later development of schizophrenia or other psychotic
spectrum disorder.8,9

Children and youth with transient or attenuated psychotic
symptoms who may be at a clinical high risk for developing
psychosis and schizophrenia require recognition as earlier
identification and interventions can improve outcomes.10

Predicting based on attenuated symptoms, which youth will
convert to a psychotic disorder, is a challenge. Research and
knowledge in this area have increased substantially in recent
years. The specific recommendations for the assessment and
approach to psychological and pharmacological interven-
tions for persons at risk are addressed in our chapter that
focuses on the high-risk population.11 Diagnostic accuracy
for youth with psychosis may be improved by the utilization
of semistructured interviews designed for youth such as the
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for
School-Age Children12 or the Kiddie Schedule for Affective
Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS).13 These interviews
should only be utilized as an addition or augment to a com-
prehensive diagnostic assessment that includes interviews
with the child or adolescent and the family plus a review
of past health records and any other available information
from resources such as school. Certainly, given the chal-
lenges in this field in attempting to recognize and treat youth
with psychosis, expertise and skill in child and adolescent
psychopathology and development are assets.

The prevalence of childhood-onset schizophrenia (prior
to age 12 years) is quite rare, affecting 1.6 to 1.9 per 100,000
in the child population.14 The prevalence increases rapidly
after age 14 years, particularly in males, and accounts for
about 25% of all psychiatric admissions in young people
between 10 and 18 years of age.15 While the course of illness
is similar in early-onset cases to that of adult-onset cases,
with symptoms in keeping with the phases of illness (pro-
drome, acute, recovery, residual), an important clinical char-
acteristic associated with the early course of psychotic
disorders is age. Early-onset psychosis is associated with
more severe psychopathology.7 Left untreated, psychosis
and schizophrenia in children and youth can contribute to
major causes of morbidity and are associated with comorbid
conditions, substance misuse, and physical health problems.16
The risk of suicide for persons with schizophrenia is higher
in those with earlier onset.17 Furthermore, an earlier onset of
psychosis predicts a potentially poorer prognosis, with about
30% requiring long-term intensive social, emotional, and
psychiatric support.18 Other factors associated with poor
long-term outcomes along with early onset include low pre-
morbid social functioning, insidious onset, lower intellectual
function, and negative symptoms.18 Of particular import,
however, is that recent research shows that early identification
and specialized stage-specific treatment that includes devel-
opmentally oriented, psychosocial, and cognitive-behavioural
interventions, along with expert medical interventions, have
the potential to alter this pessimistic course and optimize
outcomes for this population.19

As with adults, the cornerstone of treatment for psychosis
in children and youth is a comprehensive approach including
both psychosocial and pharmacological (antipsychotic med-
ication) interventions. While evidence supporting antipsy-
chotic efficacy in this population is somewhat limited, it is
certainly increasing.20 The increased incidence of medical
and psychiatric morbidity in this age group, secondary to the

illness itself and heightened sensitivity to adverse effects of
medication (such as metabolic disturbances and movement
disorders), warrants heightened vigilance to identify and
confirm the diagnosis before interventions with antipsycho-
tic medication are offered to children and youth.7,8 Early
interventions for psychosis services often require expertise
in identifying and treating early-onset presentations of psy-
chosis. Consultation with or care within such specialized
services can assist in providing the appropriate diagnosis and
ongoing care for this younger population. These services
also carry as their mandate the fostering of a seamless transi-
tion of care for children and youth with psychosis who
require consistent longstanding intensive treatment.

In summary, confirming the diagnosis of psychosis early in
the course of the illness, that is, in children and youth, can be
difficult, but it is crucial to identify the most appropriate and
least harmful treatment modalities. Meeting full diagnostic
criteria according to the DSM-V for schizophrenia and other
psychotic spectrum disorders is the threshold for pharmaco-
logical interventions suggested by these guidelines. Early
interventions using both psychological and pharmacological
modalities can foster optimal outcomes for youth, enhancing
their potential to attain recovery. For best practice, these
guidelines must be used in conjunction with those specific
to psychological treatment recommendations for children and
youth with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic dis-
orders in order to foster optimal outcomes.21

Methods

The methods for the Canadian Schizophrenia Guidelines are
described in brief here; please see the Introduction and
Methodology paper for an in-depth description.

The Canadian Schizophrenia Guidelines were developed
using the ADAPTE process.22 Recognizing that the devel-
opment of guidelines requires substantial resources, the
ADAPTE process was created to take advantage of existing
guidelines and reduce the duplication of effort.

The first phase of the ADAPTE process, the setup phase,
involved preparing for the ADAPTE process. We assembled
a national multidisciplinary panel from across Canada,

including stakeholders with expertise in schizophrenia and
mental health, health policy, patient advocacy, and lived
experience with schizophrenia. Endorsement bodies for the
guidelines include the Canadian Psychiatric Association and
the Schizophrenia Society of Canada, who were also heavily
involved in the dissemination and implementation strategy.
The second phase of the ADAPTE process, the adaptation
phase, involved the process of identifying specific health
questions; searching for and retrieving guidelines; assessing
guideline quality, currency, content, consistency, and applic-
ability; decision making around adaptation; and preparing
the draft-adapted guideline. We searched for guidelines on
schizophrenia in guideline clearinghouses and on the web-
sites of well-established guideline developers for mental
health disorders including the NICE, the Scottish Intercol-
legiate Guidelines Network, the American Psychiatric Asso-
ciation, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry, and the European Psychiatric Association. A
MEDLINE search was also performed using the terms
“guideline” as the publication type and “schizophrenia” as
the title or clinical topic. Inclusion criteria were that the
guideline needed to be published after 2010, the guideline
needed to be written in English, and recommendations had to
be developed using a defined and systematic process. We
identified 8 current guidelines that were potentially suitable
for adaptation. These guidelines were reviewed and evalu-
ated in duplicate using the AGREE II tool,23 an instrument to
evaluate the methodological rigour and transparency with
which a guideline is developed. Based on this evaluation,
we determined that 6 guidelines were of suitable quality and
content for adaptation (Table 1). Recommendations from
each guideline were extracted and divided based on content
and reviewed by the relevant working group. Following the
ADAPTE process, working groups selected guidelines and
recommendations to create an adapted guideline. Each work-
ing group carefully examined each recommendation, the
evidence from which the recommendation was derived, and
the acceptability and applicability of the recommendation to
the Canadian context. After reviewing the recommendations
from the guidelines, the working groups decided which rec-
ommendations to accept and which to reject and which

638

The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 62(9)

recommendations were acceptable but needed to be modi-
fied. Care was taken when modifying existing recommenda-
tions not to change the recommendations to such an extent
that they were no longer in keeping with the evidence upon
which they were based. Please see Appendix 1 for how and
why recommendations in this article were modified from
their original form.

Each working group developed a final list of recommen-
dations from the included guidelines that were presented to
the entire guideline panel at an in-person consensus meeting.
Working group leaders presented each recommendation and
its rationale to the panel. Anonymous voting by the entire
panel using clicker technology was performed for each rec-
ommendation. Recommendations required agreement by
80% of the group to be included in the Canadian guidelines.
If a recommendation did not receive 80% agreement, the
group discussed the recommendation and whether minor
modifications to the recommendation would alter the like-
lihood that the recommendation would pass. In these situa-
tions, recommendations were modified (as described above),
and the group revoted at a later date using an online anon-
ymous survey. Whenever modifications in wording were
made to original recommendations, the text “modified rec-
ommendation from” appears in the Canadian Schizophrenia
Guidelines, and the source of each recommendation is writ-
ten beside the recommendation statement. The strength or
grade of the recommendation is provided in parentheses, if
applicable, using the system that the recommendation came
from. The grades of recommendation for each guideline and
their meaning are explained in brief in Table 2 (see the
Introduction and Methodology paper for a more detailed
description). Once the voting and consensus process was
completed, each working group created a separate paper that
contains all the recommendations adapted from the included
guidelines, with accompanying text explaining the rationale
for each recommendation.

During the finalization phase, the Canadian Schizophre-
nia Guidelines were externally reviewed by those who will
be affected by their uptake: practitioners, policy makers,
health administrators, patients, and their families. The exter-
nal review asked questions about whether the users approve
of the draft guideline, strengths and weaknesses, and sug-
gested modifications. The process was facilitated through
the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry and the Schizophrenia
Society of Canada. The Canadian Psychiatric Association
Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee reviewed and
approved the guideline methodology process.

Results
General Principles of Care

While the principles outlined below did not emerge directly
as a result of the ADAPTE process (as per the Methods
section above), they are endorsed as values and principles
of care worth stating as they are often shared by clinicians

working with children and youth with schizophrenia and
psychotic spectrum disorders:

(cid:2) Having training, expertise, and experience working
with youth and families can assist in best understand-
ing the complexities of the identification, diagnosis,
and treatment of psychosis at early stages.

(cid:2) Assessments of the capacity to make treatment deci-
sions occur on an ongoing basis according to para-
meters outlined by provincial standards.

(cid:2) Treatment decisions should occur in partnership with
the child/youth along with his or her caregiver. Fostering
the child or youth’s autonomy and active participation in
treatment decisions as much as possible helps to opti-
mize treatment satisfaction and ongoing engagement.
(cid:2) Offering ongoing psychoeducation regarding psychosis
to both the young person and family will optimize treat-
ment satisfaction and foster improved clinical outcomes.
(cid:2) Acknowledging and addressing the impact of barriers
such as comorbidity and stigma at specific stages of
recovery can positively influence treatment decisions.
(cid:2) Clinicians need to ensure that they communicate
clearly and verify that they are well understood by
parents or carers and the child or young person. This
means taking into account the young person’s devel-
opmental level, emotional maturity, and cognitive
capacity including any learning disabilities, sight or
hearing problems, or delays in language development.
(cid:2) Treatment interventions should be offered within a

culturally competent atmosphere.

(cid:2) Maintenance of the continuity of care and consistency
of therapeutic relationships optimizes intervention
outcomes. If a transition between care services or
programs is unavoidable, a seamless transition pro-
cess is preferred.

First Episode of Psychosis

Early Identification

Recommendation 1. Urgently refer all children and young
people with a first presentation of sustained psychotic symp-
toms (lasting 4 weeks or more) to a specialist mental health
service or early interventions in psychosis service, which
includes a consultant psychiatrist with training in child/
adolescent mental health.

[Modified recommendation from NICE (Strong)]

Schizophrenia spectrum disorders are among the most
serious and persistent mental health disorders that can affect
children and adolescents. Numerous studies support the ben-
efits and improved outcomes of a shorter duration of
untreated psychosis and illness in the population with a first
episode of psychosis,24 as is further discussed in the adult
guidelines.1 Literature regarding the benefits of early detec-
tion and a shorter duration of untreated psychosis exists in
children and early adolescents,25-27 including evidence for

Strength of recommendations
The wording used denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).
Interventions that must (or must not) be used
We usually use “must” or “must not” only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally, we use “must” (or “must not”)

if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.

Interventions that should (or should not) be used: a “strong” recommendation
We use “offer” (and similar words such as “refer” or “advise”) when we are confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention

will do more good than harm and be cost-effective.

Interventions that could be used
We use “consider” when we are confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients and be cost-effective, but
other options may be similarly cost-effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely
to depend on the patient’s values and preferences than for a strong recommendation.

benefits to executive functioning.26 Early detection and
management are of utmost importance. In those assessed
to be at a high risk, longitudinal follow-ups may even allow
for the timeliest identification, management, and improved
positive outcomes.10

Further study of the development of schizophrenia and its
different stages will hopefully lead to the implementation of
prevention and early intervention strategies.28,29 Specialized
services may aid in achieving these goals.30,31 Specialized
services should aim to optimize the accurate diagnosis of
schizophrenia spectrum disorders at an earlier stage and to
reduce the duration of untreated psychosis and of untreated
illness. Research looking at factors associated with the dura-
tion of untreated psychosis will prove helpful in planning
systems of care for this population.32

Recommendation 2. Antipsychotic medication in children
and young people with a first presentation of sustained

psychotic symptoms should not be started in primary care
unless it is done in consultation with a psychiatrist with train-
ing in child and adolescent mental health.

[NICE (Strong)]

The prescription rate of antipsychotics in children and
adolescents, often off label, has been an increasingly recog-
nized concern.33-36 Antipsychotics are often prescribed for
nonpsychotic and non-bipolar disorders37 and in this age
group often may not be indicated. Given the high side-
effect potential and burden of these agents, their use should
be most judicious and with clear indications.

As also discussed in the recommendation above, special-
ists with expertise in the area of psychosis are best suited for
informing decisions about the initiation of antipsychotic
pharmacotherapy and appropriate investigations and moni-
toring38 in the context of a thorough biopsychosocial man-
agement plan.

640

The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 62(9)

Use of Antipsychotics

Recommendation 3. For children and young people with a
first episode of psychosis, offer antipsychotic medication in
conjunction with psychological/psychosocial interventions.
[Modified recommendation from NICE (Strong)]

One-third of all adults with schizophrenia have their
onset before age 18 years.15 Schizophrenia identified in
children and adolescents is clinically continuous with
adult-onset schizophrenia.18,39 Compared with adult onset,
the early-onset phenotype carries worse prognostic factors
including more severe expression of the illness, lower
premorbid social/emotional adjustment, cognitive impair-
ments, and negative symptoms. Furthermore, adolescents
with psychosis have longer treatment delays than adults39,40
possibly due to the misidentification of presenting symp-
toms. The earliest initiation of comprehensive treatment
including both pharmacological and psychosocial interven-
tions will lead to better outcomes.19 Antipsychotic medicine
is as effective as with adults and should be offered once the
diagnosis is confirmed.7

Recommendation 4. The choice of antipsychotic medica-
tion and mode of administration should be made by the
parents/carers of younger children, or jointly with the young
person and his or her parents/carers, and health care profes-
sionals. Provide age-appropriate information, and discuss
the likely benefits and possible side effects of each drug,
including the following:

(cid:2) metabolic (including weight gain and diabetes),
(cid:2) extrapyramidal (including akathisia, dyskinesia, and

dystonia);

(cid:2) cardiovascular (including prolonging the QT interval);
(cid:2) hormonal (including increasing plasma prolactin);

and

(cid:2) other side effects (including unpleasant subjective
experiences, interactions with other medications).

[Modified recommendation from NICE (Strong)]

There is a lack of evidence for efficacy differences or
clinical superiority between the various antipsychotic
classes or generations (except for clozapine for treatment-
refractory cases)7 or modes of administration. As such,
choosing an antipsychotic for this population must be made
in conjunction with the patient and/or family, taking into
account their choice and other factors including heightened
vulnerability to adverse effects, administration preference
(oral or intramuscular), side-effect profile, medical status
of patient, pharmacodynamics , and risk for other iatrogenic
morbidity. The need to monitor for adverse effects is
paramount.7,41

ticularly if

it is specified in the Health Canada drug product
database,
a physical examination has identified a specific car-
diovascular risk (such as the diagnosis of high blood
pressure),
there is a personal history of cardiovascular disease, and
there is a family history of cardiovascular disease such
as premature sudden cardiac death or a prolonged QT
interval.

[Modified recommendation from NICE (Strong)]

Schizophrenia spectrum disorders are associated with an
inherent 2- to 3-fold excess mortality, with the vast majority,
regardless of the age of onset, related to cardiovascular ill-
ness or obesity-related cancer.42 Antipsychotic medication
can contribute to cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality in
this population, the risk for which requires monitoring and
prevention. Markers of an increased risk have been associ-
ated with the duration of lifetime exposure to antipsychotic
medication, reinforcing the need to assess all patients before
and during treatment and to prioritize lower risk antipsycho-
tics and the management of cardiometabolic adverse effects
that may arise.42

Recommendation 6. Treatment with antipsychotic medica-
tion should be considered an explicit individual therapeutic
trial. Include the following:

(cid:2) From a discussion with the child or young person and
his or her parent or carer, record the side effects that the
child or young person is most and least willing to
tolerate.

(cid:2) Record the indications and expected benefits and risks
of oral antipsychotic medication and the expected
time for a change in symptoms and appearance of side
effects.

(cid:2) At the start of treatment, give a dose below the lower
end of the licensed range for adults if the drug is not
licensed for children and young people and at the
lower end of the licensed range if the drug is licensed
for children and young people; slowly titrate upward
within the dose range recommended by the Health
Canada drug product database.
Justify and record reasons for dosages above the dose
range recommendations in the Health Canada drug
product database.

(cid:2)

(cid:2) Record the rationale for continuing, changing, or
stopping medication and the effects of such changes.
(cid:2) Carry out a trial of the medication at the optimal

dosage for 4 to 6 weeks.

[Modified recommendation from NICE (Strong)]

Recommendation 5. Before initiating or changing antipsy-
chotic medication for a child or young person with schizo-
phrenia, depending on the medication being considered and

health and the effects of antipsychotic medication in chil-
dren and young people is occurring and that responsibility

care.

open discussions regarding the risk/benefit ratio of therapies
important to the youth and family is of great value.

[Modified recommendation from NICE (Strong)]

Given the lack of efficacy differences between antipsy-
chotics (except clozapine), it is important to consider
rational pharmacotherapy strategies when treating children
and youth with psychosis. Patients with early-onset psycho-
sis are a more vulnerable group than adults, often with a
more severe expression of illness and neurodevelopmental
deficits, leading to a potential increased risk for adverse
events related to pharmacotherapy. Moreover, this popula-
tion may have a potential positive response at lower doses of
antipsychotic medicine than those used in adults.43,44 Inter-
ventions must be timely but also judicious and cautious in
terms of the selection of treatment options, dosing, and
change strategies that have both optimizing efficacy and
minimizing adverse effects as the targets.45 Dosing should
occur slowly and be targeted to efficacy rather than weight,
and abrupt switches of medication should be avoided to
minimize rebound phenomena.45,46

Systematic monitoring of adverse effects (e.g., metabolic,
neuromotor), using standardized scales if available starting
from baseline, is crucial in order to increase the effectiveness
of medication and decrease nonadherence.7,46 It is important
to maintain an honest and transparent approach with the
youth and family at all intervals of the intervention in order
to increase engagement in the process.

Treatment resistance is defined by a lack of satisfactory
improvement for the patient despite adequate antipsychotic
trials for 6 to 8 weeks.47 Furthermore, it is also important to
consider multiple causes of the inefficiency of medication
before engaging in alternatives or a switch. Potential
confounders might include nonadherence, medical illness,
comorbidities including substance abuse, stressors, polyphar-
macy and drug interactions, adverse effects, poor optimization
of current treatment, and need for psychosocial interventions.7

Recommendation 8. Discuss any nonprescribed therapies
that children or young people, or their parents or carers, wish
to use (including complementary therapies) with them. Dis-
cuss the safety and efficacy of the therapies and possible
interference with the therapeutic effects of prescribed med-
ication and psychological interventions.

[NICE (Strong)]

Maintaining a therapeutic alliance with the youth and fam-
ily throughout the duration of treatment will positively affect
the course and outcomes of illness.48 The lack of alliance may
be a predictor for poor engagement, which is directly related
to medication nonadherence, rehospitalization rates, severity
of symptoms, and dropout rates.49 Youth with early-onset
psychosis are particularly vulnerable to drop out in the first
few years of illness.48 It is imperative to utilize the opportu-
nity for early treatment gains by maintaining a stance of
transparency and honesty with the patient and family. Adopt-
ing an evidence-informed approach while also engaging in

Recommendation 9. Discuss the use of cannabis, alcohol,
tobacco, and prescription and nonprescription medications
and drugs with the child or young person, and parents or
carers, where this has been agreed on. Discuss their possible
interference with the therapeutic effects of prescribed med-
ication and psychological interventions and the potential of
drugs to exacerbate psychotic symptoms.

[NICE (Strong)]

The comorbidity of schizophrenia and substance use dis-
order affects both early-onset high-risk cases as well as first-
episode cases of schizophrenia. Amphetamines and other
stimulants along with cannabis, alcohol, and nicotine are
most commonly used by adolescents, which is also the group
most at risk for the development of psychotic disorders.50
Stimulants, often used by older adolescents as “study drugs,”
that is, to maximize wakefulness, along with cannabis, may
have harmful effects across the spectrum of psychotic dis-
orders by triggering onset, worsening established psychotic
symptoms, or precipitating relapse, which all contribute to
the overall burden of psychosis.51 Furthermore, nicotine and
alcohol use enhances morbidity risks already associated with
the illness itself including an inherent 2- to 3-fold excess
mortality, with the vast majority, regardless of the age of
onset, related to cardiovascular illness and obesity-related
cancer.42 According to international comparisons of alcohol
and cannabis use by young people, Canada ranks among the
leading countries for rates of prevalence.52-54 It is thus espe-
cially important to discuss with young people, particularly
those at a genetic risk for schizophrenia, the potential
adverse effects of drug use on their health.

In the last decade, a vast amount of literature has sup-
ported the association between an increased risk for psy-
chosis and exposure to cannabis, particularly in those
individuals who are genetically vulnerable.55,56 In terms
of risk factors that carry a poor prognosis, cannabis use,
other comorbidities (such as depression), and medication
nonadherence are the 3 most strongly associated with poor
outcomes including the risk of relapse.57,58 Similar to other
modifiable risk factors that may have a weak individual
effect on outcomes, cannabis, if acting in concert at specific
critical periods of neurodevelopment, may in fact impact
the expression and neuroprogression of the genetic risk for
schizophrenia.58 Individuals who regularly use cannabis
during adolescence double the risk of reporting psychotic
symptoms or being diagnosed with schizophrenia during
adulthood.59 Longitudinal studies have identified a 40%
greater risk of psychotic disorder in those who have ever
used cannabis (controlling for other variables) in what may
be a dose-dependent relationship between use and the risk
of schizophrenia.60 Further, some studies have reported that
cannabis use at an earlier age may decrease the age of onset
of the first episode of schizophrenia by 2.7 years.61 Canna-
bis use during treatment has also been associated with poor

outcomes such as increased hospitalization rates, increased
relapse rates, and worse medication adherence rates.62

Recommendation 10. Do not initiate regular combined
antipsychotic medication, except for short periods (e.g.,
when changing medication).

[NICE (Strong)]

Case reports supporting the unconventional use of antipsy-
chotics in treatment-refractory schizophrenia in adults do exist;
however, at this time, there is no clear evidence in youth with
psychosis for a positive balance of increased efficacy versus
the risk for adverse effects with combined antipsychotic use.7

Early Postacute Period

Recommendation 11. Review antipsychotic medication reg-
ularly as clinically indicated, including observed benefits and
any side effects.

[Modified recommendation from NICE]

Recommendation 12. In the early period of recovery fol-
lowing an acute episode, reflect on the episode and its
impact with the child or young person and his or her parents
or carers, and make plans for recovery and possible future
care using a realistically optimistic approach to recovery.
[NICE (Strong)]

Recommendation 13. Inform the child or young person and
his or her parents or carers that there is a high risk of relapse
if medication is stopped in the 1 to 2 years following an acute
episode.

[NICE (Strong)]

Recommendation 14. If discontinuing/tapering antipsycho-
tic medication, undertake it gradually, and monitor regularly
for signs and symptoms of relapse.

[Modified recommendation from NICE (Strong)]

Recommendation 15. After discontinuing/tapering antipsy-
chotic medication, continue monitoring for signs and symp-
toms of relapse for at least 2 years.

[Modified recommendation from NICE (Strong)]

Despite the initial positive response to antipsychotic med-
ication for most young people with a first episode of schizo-
phrenia, a longer term prognosis is less impressive, with up
to 80% experiencing a relapse within 5 years of the initial
remitted episode.63 Nonadherence to medication is one of
the most profound predictors of relapse after a first episode
of psychosis.64 Strategies to prevent second and subsequent
episodes are of great significance as the risk of persistent
psychotic symptoms increases with repeated relapses.65,66
Relapses may lead to a reduction in gray matter,67 which
can reduce responses to medication and negatively influence
social, emotional, and vocational goal attainment, particu-
larly in the younger population.63

Overall, available evidence suggests that intensive psy-
chosocial strategies, combined with low-dose antipsychotic

medication, are effective in reducing relapse rates in youth
and adults.63 Maintaining a therapeutic alliance with close
monitoring in the early years following the first episode is
crucial in setting the parameters for long-term recovery.68,69
Most specialized early psychosis programs have relapse pre-
vention as a core component of treatment and have proven
effective in reducing relapse rates.63 Research investigating
medication discontinuation strategies following remission is
lacking in both adult and younger onset cases of schizophrenia.
Generally, it does appear that the maintenance of medication is
superior in preventing relapses; however, more trials are
needed.63 Nonetheless, in the younger population at an earlier
stage of brain development, the long-term exposure to adverse
effects of medication and associated impairments in social and
occupational function must always be weighed against the risk
of relapse and further illness episodes. The potential value of
intensive psychosocial interventions matched with disconti-
nuation strategies requires further investigation.

For youth with early psychosis, many, but not all, will
require lifelong maintenance treatment with antipsychotic
medication.63 After a prolonged remission period, a small
number may be able to discontinue antipsychotic medication
with a re-emergence of psychotic symptoms. In such cases,
given the high risk of relapse, longer term monitoring is
recommended. Unfortunately, the exact length of treatment
required after the first episode in early-onset psychosis in
youth has not been adequately studied or clarified.

Subsequent Acute Episodes of Psychosis
or Schizophrenia.

Recommendation 16. For children and young people with
an acute recurrence of psychosis or schizophrenia, offer anti-
psychotic medication in conjunction with psychological
interventions (family intervention with individual cognitive
behavioral therapy [CBT]).

[NICE (Strong)]

Recommendation 17. For children or young people with
an acute exacerbation or recurrence of psychosis or schi-
zophrenia, offer antipsychotic medication or review the
existing medication. The choice of drug should be influ-
enced by the same criteria recommended for starting treat-
ment. Take into account the clinical responses to and side
effects associated with current and previous medication,
and monitor as described in current recommendations.

[NICE (Strong)]

Up to 80% of patients with a first episode (adult) experi-
ence a relapse within 5 years of remission of the first epi-
sode.63,64 Specialized programs have been found to be
effective in preventing relapses, particularly those that include
a combination of approaches such as outreach, cognitive
behavioural therapy, medication, family support, and educa-
tion.70 More research is required that will allow us to indivi-
dualize treatment in youth with psychosis, possibly through

the identification of clinical biomarkers of response or the risk
of adverse effects related to specific treatments.7

Hospital Care.

Recommendation 18. If a child or young person needs
hospital care, this should be in a setting appropriate to his
or her age and developmental level.

[NICE (Strong)]

Management of Acute Aggression or Agitation.

Recommendation 19. Health care professionals using urgent
sedation and/or restraint in children and young people with
schizophrenia should be trained and competent in undertaking
these procedures in children and young people.

[NICE (Strong)]

Recommendation 20. Occasionally, children and young
people with psychosis or schizophrenia pose an acute risk to
themselves or others during an acute episode and may need
urgent sedation. Be particularly cautious when considering
high-potency antipsychotic medication (such as haloperidol)
in children and young people, especially those who have not
taken antipsychotic medication before, because of the
increased risk of acute dystonic reactions in this age group.

[NICE (Strong)]

Recommendation 21. When clinically appropriate after
urgent sedation, offer to the child or young person and care-
givers the opportunity to discuss their experiences. Provide
them with a clear explanation of the decision to use urgent
sedation/restraint. Record this in their notes.

[NICE (Strong)]

Acute aggressive episodes and disruptive behaviour can
occur in young people with psychosis as part of their pre-
sentation. Any form of aggression has the potential for
severe and unexpected adverse outcomes for the patient and
others. It is important to uncover the origin of the behaviour
as it may have a bearing on the development of a treatment
plan as well as the prevention of future aggression.

When dealing with aggressive or disruptive behaviour, it
is recommended to start with nonpharmacological interven-
tions; this can be successful in de-escalating the behaviour
and minimizing the use of medications. If nonpharmacolo-
gical techniques are insufficient to control the behaviour, the
consideration of medication may be required. Oftentimes, an
intramuscular option is preferred or required, particularly in
the hopes of avoiding physical restraint, which can be very
distressing for the young person and family.71,72

Benzodiazepines (oral or intramuscular) are often used in
emergency situations; they have a rapid onset of action and a
good safety profile. It is important to be aware of the potential
risk for a paradoxical response in young people.73 The use of an
antipsychotic may be preferred in cases where a diagnosis of
schizophrenia is confirmed. Ideally, the use of an antipsychotic
that has been of previous benefit to the youth is preferred.

When prescribing antipsychotics, the potential for
adverse effects warrants attention. Extrapyramidal side
effects including acute dystonia are notably associated with
a younger age and the vulnerable developing brain, limiting
the use of typical antipsychotics in the pediatric popula-
tion.74 There is insufficient evidence to support the prescrip-
tion of antihistamines in cases of agitation.75

Promoting Recovery and Providing Possible
Future Care in Primary Care.

Recommendation 22. Ensure that responsibility for moni-
toring the physical health of children and young people
remains clearly established between primary care and speci-
alty services. Monitoring the physical health of children and
young people with schizophrenia should occur at least once a
year or more often if clinically indicated. Primary care phy-
sicians/clinicians should bear in mind that people with schi-
zophrenia are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease than
the general population.

[Modified recommendation from NICE (Strong)]

Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and first-
generation antipsychotics (FGAs) are mostly used off label
for Canadian children and youth. Aripiprazole has been
approved for the treatment of youth under 18 years of age
with schizophrenia.76 The efficacy of SGAs does not come
without their risks, as noted above. The risk of weight gain
and associated metabolic abnormalities including dyslipide-
mia is greatest with olanzapine, followed by clozapine and
quetiapine.42,44,76 The risk of neurological side effects such
as parkinsonism, akathisia, and other extrapyramidal effects
is greatest with risperidone, olanzapine, and aripipra-
zole.7,42,76 SGAs can cause other adverse effects of concern
including sialorrhea, sedation, sexual dysfunction, and pro-
longed QTc.42,76 Prescribers need to be well aware of these
effects and the implications for individual patients and
should consult with colleagues in primary care and pediatri-
cians as required for effective management and treatment
strategies in order to collaboratively avoid long-term and
potentially iatrogenic health consequences. Evidence-based
monitoring protocols are available for prescribers of SGAs
(and FGAs) to assist in minimizing the risk for poor out-
comes, and their use is strongly encouraged.76 Good practice
principles suggest adopting regular and consistent monitor-
ing practices in collaboration with primary care when pre-
scribing for youth with early-onset psychosis.

Interventions for Children and Young People Whose
Illness Has Not Responded Adequately to Treatment.

Recommendation 23. Offer clozapine to children and young
people with schizophrenia whose illness has not responded
adequately to pharmacological treatment, despite the sequen-
tial use of adequate doses of at least 2 different antipsychotic
drugs each used for 6 to 8 weeks.

[NICE (Strong)]

644

The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 62(9)

Treatment resistance is defined by a lack of satisfactory
improvement in symptoms, despite 2 adequate trials (6–8
weeks’ duration) of an antipsychotic.47,70 As noted above,
before considering a switch to clozapine or other augmenta-
tion strategies for which evidence might be lacking, it is
important to investigate for other causes of inefficiency such
as nonadherence, medical illness, comorbidities including
substance abuse, stressors, polypharmacy and drug interac-
tions, adverse effects, poor optimization of current treat-
ment, and need for psychosocial interventions.7,70

Clozapine has documented superior efficacy for adults
and children/youth with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.77-80
Furthermore, following the initial response, there are often
increased clinical responses in the ensuing 6 to 8 months.
Benefits of clozapine have been sustained in long-term main-
tenance studies, some for up to 2 to 9 years.77 Importantly,
many patients sometimes experience multiple adverse
effects secondary to clozapine. However, tolerability
related to potentially fatal hematological adverse events
does not appear to be of much concern, evidenced by low
discontinuation rates.77,78 With rigourous and preventa-
tive monitoring strategies as required for a clozapine pre-
scription in Canada, events such as neutropenia and
agranulocytosis are transient/mild and rare, respectively.
Metabolic abnormalities seem comparable to SGAs such as
olanzapine and warrant similar judicious monitoring.80
A switch to or initiation of clozapine for treatment-resistant
patients certainly requires thoughtful consideration and trans-
parency. Both the psychiatrist and patient/family must
commit to the increased monitoring requirements and
carefully balance the risk/benefit ratio of clozapine initiation.

Conclusions

The current guidelines were developed to assist clinicians in
treating youth who present with symptoms in keeping with
early-onset schizophrenia or other psychotic spectrum disor-
ders. These guidelines do not present the sole standard of care
and can be used in conjunction with good judgment in light of
specific patient circumstances and available resources.

Research in the treatment of youth with schizophrenia or
psychotic spectrum disorders is increasing. The importance of
early detection, diagnosis, and indicated prevention in this
population represents a significant paradigm shift in the per-
ception of outcomes for youth with this illness. Previously
held pessimistic attitudes toward a prognosis for youth with
schizophrenia are no longer warranted. A comprehensive,
thoughtful, and diligent approach to management, along with
an honest and transparent stance with the patient and family
regarding treatment, can enhance the patient’s potential to
achieve positive results and optimal long-term outcomes.
