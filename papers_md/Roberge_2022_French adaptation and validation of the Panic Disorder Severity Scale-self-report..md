Abstract 
Background:  The aims of this study were to conduct a cross-cultural validation of the Panic Disorder Severity Scale – 
Self-Report (PDSS-SR) and to examine psychometric properties of the French-Canadian version.

Methods:  A sample of 256 adults were included in the validation study based on data from the baseline interview of 
a clinical trial on transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy for mixed anxiety disorders. Participants completed the 
Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS-5), and self-report instruments including the PDSS-SR, Beck 
Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Mobility Inventory for Agoraphobia (MIA), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), Patient Health Ques-
tionnaire (PHQ-9), Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Penn State Worry Questionnaire 
(PSWQ). The cross-cultural adaptation in French of the PDSS-SR included a rigorous back-translation process, with an 
expert committee review. Sensitivity to change was also examined with a subgroup of patients (n

Results:  The French version of the PDSS-SR demonstrated good psychometric properties. The exploratory factor 
analysis supported a one factor structure with an eigenvalue > 1 that explained 64.9% of the total variability. The con-
firmatory factor analysis (CFA) corroborated a one-factor model with a good model fit. Internal consistency analysis 
showed a .91 Cronbach’s alpha. The convergent validity was adequate with the ADIS-5 clinical severity ratings for

Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS-SR) [2] distinguishes itself 
as  a  comprehensive  panic  disorder  severity  scale  and 
appears  valuable  for  both  clinical  practice  and  research. 
However,  to  our  knowledge,  the  PDSS-SR  has  not  yet 
been adapted and validated in French.

The  PDSS-SR  was  developed  as  a  self-report  version 
of  the  Panic  Disorder  Severity  Scale  (PDSS),  a  widely 
used  brief  clinician-administered  instrument  for  assess-
ing  the  severity  of  panic  disorder  [3].  The  PDSS  shows 
adequate  psychometric  properties  with  respect  to  inter-
rater  reliability,  internal  consistency,  construct  valid-
ity  and  sensitivity  to  change  [3–5].  The  PDSS  has  been 
translated  in  multiple  languages  with  validation  studies 
reporting  good  reliability  and  validity  when  compared 
to  the  original  English  version  (e.g.,  [6,  7]).  Despite  the 
relevance  of  this  instrument,  in  some  contexts,  it  is  not 
feasible  to  train  interviewers  to  administer  the  PDSS 
interview,  and  therefore,  Houck  et  al.  [2]  developed  the 
self-report version of the PDSS (PDSS-SR). Both versions 
contain 7 items, and each item is scored from 0 to 4, with 
increasing values corresponding to increasing severity of 
panic symptoms [2, 3]. The PDSS-SR assesses the sever-
ity of each of 7 dimensions of panic disorder (frequency 
of  panic  attacks,  distress  during  panic  attacks,  anticipa-
tory  anxiety,  agoraphobic  fear/avoidance,  interoceptive 
fear/avoidance,  impairment  in  occupational  and  social 
functioning)  during  the  last  week  on  a  scale  from  0  to 
4.  A  0  indicates  that  the  patient  did  not  experience  the 
item, and 4 indicates the most severe reaction. This self-
report  scale  has  good  internal  consistency  (Cronbach’s 
α = 0.92),  test–retest  reliability  (ICC = 0.81),  interrater 
reliability,  and  sensitivity  to  change  [2].  The  main  dif-
ference  between  the  clinician  and  self-report  versions  is 
the  period  covered  by  the  assessment  –  the  last  month 
and the last week, respectively. The rationale behind this 
difference  was  to  minimize  recall  bias  for  the  PDSS-SR 
and  to  allow  the  administration  of  the  questionnaire  on 
a  weekly  basis  to  monitor  panic  symptoms  [2].  A  vali-
dation  study  conducted  with  a  five-item1  version  of  the 
instrument,  excluding  occupational  and  social  interfer-
ence items, reported moderate reliability and validity [5]. 
The  PDSS-SR  has  been  translated  and  validated  in  Chi-
nese, Swedish, Spanish and Korean, and studies reported 
excellent  internal  consistency  (Cronbach’s  α  between 
0.80  to  0.93),  good  to  excellent  correlation  with  PDSS 
(r = 0.68 to 0.98), good to excellent test–retest reliability 
(ICC between 0.65 to 0.96), adequate convergent and dis-
criminant validity, and a significant sensitivity to change 

1  The version of the PDSS-SR used by Wuyek et al. [5] included only five items 
because of a clerical error (personal communication, Martin M. Antony). The 
correct version of the PDSS-SR includes seven items.

[6,  8–10].  However,  there  was  dissimilarity  in  the  factor 
structure  of  the  PDSS-SR,  with  the  Korean  version  sup-
porting  a  unidimensional  structure  [8],  the  Chinese  and 
Spanish  versions  supporting  a  two-factor  model  [9,  10], 
and the Swedish version yielding inconclusive results [6]. 
Recent  studies  have  also  suggested  thresholds  for  prob-
able panic disorder with the PDSS-SR [9] and a very brief 
2-item  version  focusing  solely  on  distress  during  panic 
attacks and agoraphobic avoidance [11].

The  goal  of  our  study  was  to  conduct  a  cross-cultural 
adaptation and validation of the PDSS-SR for the assess-
ment  of  panic  disorder  with  a  French-Canadian  sample 
of adults with anxiety symptoms taking part in a clinical 
assessment  to  enrol  in  a  randomized  controlled  trial  of 
transdiagnostic  group  cognitive-behavioral  therapy.  The 
specific  objectives  of  the  study  were  to:  1)  describe  the 
validity and reliability of the French-Canadian adaptation 
of the PDSS-SR; 2) explore the optimal cut-off score for 
probable diagnosis; 3) examine sensitivity to change with 
a subset of patients meeting DSM-5 criteria for panic dis-
order enrolled in the clinical trial.

Methods
Participants

Data were drawn from the baseline assessment (T0) and 
posttreatment assessment (T1) of participants to a prag-
matic  clinical  multicentre  trial  of  transdiagnostic  group 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders 
conducted in Quebec, Canada. The study was conducted 
in  three  integrated  health  and  social  services  centers, 
comprising  Quebec  City  and  adjacent  areas  (i.e.,  urban 
and rural population of 737 000 inhabitants); Estrie (i.e., 
urban and rural population of 474 000 inhabitants); and 
Laval  City  (i.e.,  predominantly  urban  population  of  435 
000  inhabitants).  Complete  methodology  and  primary 
outcome  results  for  the  trial  were  described  previously 
[12].  The  trial  inclusion  criteria  comprised  the  follow-
ing:  (1)  ages  18  to  65,  (2)  fluent  in  spoken  and  written 
French; (3) DSM-5 diagnostic criteria met for at least one 
of  the  following  principal  anxiety  disorders:  Panic  Dis-
order,  Agoraphobia,  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder  and/
or Social Anxiety Disorder with a clinical severity rating 
(CSR) ≥ 4  on  the  Anxiety  and  Related  Disorders  Inter-
view Schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS-5) [13]. The trial exclu-
sion  criteria  comprised:  (1)  active  suicidal  intentions, 
psychosis,  bipolar  disorder,  and  active  substance-related 
and addictive disorder in the past 12 months; (2) marked 
cognitive impairment; (3) consultation with a psychiatrist 
in the past 12 months.

A three-stage process was used for patient recruitment. 
First,  we  advertised  the  study  in  the  general  population 
and  community-based  care  settings  through  regional 
newspapers,  geo-located  Facebook  and  Google  AdWords

publicity,  and  bulletin  boards.  Self-referred  individuals 
completed  a  brief  screening  online  survey  that  included 
the  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder-7  (GAD-7;  cut  point 
value ≥ 8 for anxiety disorders) [14], and other measures. 
Second,  clinical  evaluators  completed  a  brief  telephone-
screening  interview  with  potential  participants.  Third, 
face-to-face  clinical  assessment  interviews  were  con-
ducted  with  potential  candidates  to  assess  their  eligibil-
ity based on the ADIS-5 assessment (T0). All participants 
taking  part  in  the  third  stage  of  assessment  (T0)  of  the 
clinical  trial  and  returning  baseline  questionnaires,  with 
a principal anxiety disorder, regardless of being enrolled 
in  the  trial,  were  potentially  eligible  for  the  secondary 
validation  study.  The  sample  for  objectives  1  and  2  was 
composed of all T0 participants with a complete dataset. 
The sample for objective 3 was composed of participants 
enrolled  in  the  clinical  trial,  meeting  DSM-5  criteria  for 
panic disorder and with a complete pre-post dataset.

The study was approved by the principal ethics review 
board  (Comité  d’éthique  de  la  recherche  du  Centre 
intégré  universitaire  de  santé  et  de  services  sociaux  de 
l’Estrie – Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke, 
#MP-22–2016-570)  and  the  boards  of  the  other  insti-
tutions  (Comité  d’éthique  de  la  recherche  de  l’Institut 
universitaire  en  santé  mentale  de  Quebec,  #2017–166; 
Comité scientifique et d’éthique de la recherche – CISSS 
de Laval, #2016–2017 / C54). All patients gave their writ-
ten informed consent.

Intervention

The experimental condition was a transdiagnostic group 
cognitive-behavioral  therapy  program  that  comprised 
education and self-monitoring, specific cognitive restruc-
turing, graduated exposure and response prevention, and 
generalized cognitive restructuring [15]. The intervention 
was delivered to groups of 8–10 patients over a 12-week 
period  by  two  psychologists  or  psychotherapists.  The 
treatment-as-usual  (TAU)  control  group  continued 
receiving usual care with no  restrictions  throughout the 
trial.

Diagnostic interview

The ADIS-5 was used to assess DSM-5 diagnostic crite-
ria for anxiety disorders and comorbid mental disorders 
[13]. A significant clinical improvement at posttreatment 
for panic disorder was defined as a clinical severity rating 
(CSR) < 4  or  at  least  a  2-points  decrease  on  the  8-point 
scale.

PDSS‑SR translation

To  conduct  a  cross-cultural  translation  of  the  PDSS-SR 
[2]  in  French  for  Canada,  we  followed  previously  pub-
lished  guidelines  [16,  17].  Two  forward  translations  of 
the  original  English  PDSS-SR  were  performed,  includ-
ing  one  by  a  professional  translator  and  the  other  by  a 
research  assistant.  The  rationale  to  having  two  forward 
translations is that it allows both translations to be com-
pared,  permitting  the  identification  of  translation  errors 
and  varied  interpretations  of  phrasing  of  items  in  the 
source  language  [17].  The  two  translated  questionnaires 
were  then  reconciled  into  one  French-Canadian  version 
through  a  consensus  discussion.  The  process  of  recon-
ciliation allowed any differences between forward trans-
lations  to  be  compared  and  the  preferred  phrasing  was 
integrated into the final version. Minor differences were 
observed  in  the  translation  but  were  easily  solved  by  an 
expert  committee  composed  of  the  research  team  and 
collaborators  involved  in  the  translation  process.  Addi-
tionally, this process minimizes the chances that the final 
French-Canadian  version  could  be  biased  toward  one 
translator’s  writing  style  [17].  Following  this,  two  back 
translations  were  carried  out  by  fluent  English  speakers 
to ensure that all questions retained their original mean-
ing  when  returned  to  the  source  language.  These  back 
translations  were  compared  to  the  original  English  ver-
sion of the PDSS-SR, and minor revisions of the French 
phrasing  were  conducted  to  ensure  conceptual  equiva-
lence  of  all  items.  The  instrument’s  instructions,  ques-
tions,  and  response  options  were  reviewed  to  ensure 
synonyms  and  expressions  had  similar  meanings  and 
were culturally equivalent, to solve any remaining gram-
matical difficulties, and assert reading level adequacy.

Measures

The  initial  in-person  assessment  interview  (T0;  pre-
form, 
random  assignment)  comprised  the  consent 
administration  of  the  ADIS-5  and  a  questionnaire  on 
sociodemographic  data,  health  care  costs,  medication, 
and  work  performance  by  a  trained  PhD  level  evalua-
tor. Patients were also given a participant’s booklet with 
the self-report questionnaires, and the same booklet was 
used at T0 and T1. Only measures used for the secondary 
validation study are described here.

Other self‑report questionnaires

The  patient’s  booklet  comprised  instruments  with  good 
psychometric properties and validated in French. Meas-
ures  of  anxiety  symptoms  included  the  Beck  Anxiety 
Inventory  (BAI)  [18,  19],  the  Mobility  Inventory  for  Ago-
raphobia  (MIA)  [20,  21],  the  Social  Phobia  Inventory 
(SPIN) [22, 23] and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire 
(PSWQ)  [24,  25].  Depressive  symptoms  were  assessed 
with  the  Patient  Health  Questionnaire  (PHQ-9)  [26, 
27].  The  Sheehan  Disability  Scale  (SDS)  was  used  as  a

measure  of  disability  in  work,  social  life  and  family  life 
[28]. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was also adminis-
tered to examine the severity of insomnia and associated 
difficulties [29, 30]. Only the self-reported questionnaires 
used for this validation study were listed, but other were 
used in the main study.

Procedure
Data analyses

The factor structure of the PDSS-SR was examined with 
exploratory  factor  analysis  (EFA)  and  with  confirma-
tory factor analysis (CFA). For the EFA, Promax rotation 
was used, factors with eigenvalues > 1 were retained and 
a  factor  loading  higher  of  0.40  was  retained  to  explain 
the target factor. A first analysis was performed without 
imposing  any  factor  and  a  second  by  imposing  two  fac-
tors according to previous research. Then, CFA with one-
factor  was  used  to  examine  the  fitness  of  the  structure 
obtained with EFA. The diagonally weighted least squares 
estimation  method  was  used  since  it  was  more  appro-
priate  for  ordinal  data  [31].  The  model  fit  was  assessed 
with  standardized  root  mean  square  residual  (SRMR), 
adjusted  goodness  of  fit  index  (AGFI)  and  normed  fit 
index (NFI). A SRMR below 0.08, AGFI higher 0.95 and 
NFI higher 0.95 indicate a good model fit [32].

Internal consistency of the French-Canadian PDSS-SR 
was assessed using Cronbach’s α. Convergent and discri-
minant  validity  were  examined  with  Spearman  correla-
tions  as  several  variables  were  not  normally  distributed 
[33].  The  correlations  were  assessed  for  the  total  score 
and items of the PDSS-SR with ADIS-5 CSR for anxiety 
and  depressive  disorders,  as  well  as  different  self-report 
questionnaires.  Based  on  the  concept  of  panic  disorder 
and  previous  studies  [5,  6,  8,  10],  this  allowed  for  the 
examination  of  convergent  validity  with  another  meas-
ure  of  panic  disorder  (ADIS-5)  and  related  agoraphobia 
(ADIS-5,  MIA),  of  anxiety  symptoms  (BAI),  as  well  as 
disability  (SDS).  For  discriminant  validity,  lower  cor-
relations  were  expected  with  other  questionnaires  that 
measure different constructs (ADIS-5, ISI, PHQ-9, SPIN, 
PSWQ), although comorbidity would need to be consid-
ered in the interpretation of findings. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves for the PDSS-SR were com-
puted to evaluate the performance of the score to distin-
guish participants with and without panic disorder with 
the PDSS-SR full scale. We also conducted an exploratory 
analysis  of  the  2-item  version  recommended  by  Forsell 
et al. [11]. The Youden index was used to define the best 
cut-offs.

To examine sensitivity to change, a linear mixed regres-
sion model was performed with the maximum-likelihood 
method and the variance components correlation matrix 
on  the  PDSS-SR  considering  the  intervention  group, 

time  and  interaction  (evolution  between  groups).  The 
intra-group and intra-site variability of therapy was con-
trolled  with  a  random  effect  on  the  participants  nested 
in the therapy groups, nested in the three sites. To con-
trol for the variability between groups, a second random 
effect on the therapy groups nested in the three sites was 
added.  Since  the  residuals  were  normally  distributed, 
bootstrap  resampling  was  not  necessary.  Sensitivity  to 
change  was  analysed  for  two  scenarios  of  improvement 
at baseline (T0) and posttreatment (T1) assessment peri-
ods  in  participants  with  panic  disorder  enrolled  in  the 
clinical  trial,  including  the  comparison  of  experimental 
and active control conditions and the comparison of par-
ticipants with significant clinical improvement for panic 
disorder based on ADIS-5 CSR score for panic disorder. 
CFA analyses were performed with SAS version 9, other 
analyses  were  performed  with  IBM  SPSS  Statistics  ver-
sion 25. GraphPad Prism version 7 was used to create the 
figures.

Results
Participants

A  complete  baseline  dataset  was  available  for  256  par-
ticipants, 
including  sociodemographic  data,  ADIS-5 
interview  and  self-report  questionnaires.  Table  1  shows 
the  sociodemographic  and  clinical  characteristics  of  the 
sample.  Participants  were  mostly  women  (85.2%),  and 
the mean age was 36.9 years (SD = 12.4, range = 18–79). 
The majority of participants had at least a postsecondary 
degree  (88.9%)  and  52.9%  were  married  or  living  with  a 
partner.  The  sample  was  mostly  composed  of  partici-
pants with comorbid anxiety and related disorders, with 
DSM-5  criteria  being  met  for  generalized  anxiety  disor-
der (77.7%), social anxiety disorder (61.7%), panic disor-
der (40.6%), agoraphobia (29.3%), and depression (23.8%).

Factor structure and confirmatory factor analysis

The  EFA  had  only  one  eigenvalue > 1  for  a  one-factor 
structure,  explaining  64.9%  of  the  total  variability,  and 
each  item  was  well  represented  (eigenvalue  4.54;  factor 
loadings = 0.77  to  0.83)  (Table  2).  The  eigenvalue  of  the 
second factors was 0.77 and explained 11.0% of the total 
variability. These results suggested a one-factor structure. 
As several authors in the literature reported a two-factor 
structure,  we  also  explored  this  possibility.  By  repeat-
ing  the  exploratory  analysis  with  two  imposed  factors, 
we observed that items 1, 2 and 3 were well represented 
on  the  second  factor  with  factor  loading > 0.40,  and  that 
items  4  to  7  were  well  represented  on  the  first  factor.  A 
CFA was subsequently performed and confirmed a one-
factor model with all fit indices indicating a good model 
fit  (SRMR = 0.0602,  AGFI = 0.9842  and  NFI = 0.9859).

Internal consistency

Cronbach’s  α  for  the  French-Canadian  PDSS-SR  was 
0.91.  Mean  score  for  French  PDSS-SR  was  8.73 ± 6.20. 
Mean  scores  and  standard  deviations  for  individual 
items, corrected item-total correlations, Cronbach’s α by 
omitting items from the scale and correlations between 
items  are  presented  in  Table  3.  Corrected  item-total 
correlations  range  between  0.69  to  0.76,  indicating  a 
good relationship with the PDSS-SR when the item was 
excluded.

Convergent and discriminant validity

Table  4  shows  the  correlation  coefficients  between  the 
French-Canadian PDSS-SR, ADIS-5 and other self-report 
measures.  Spearman  correlations  were  used  for  all  vari-
ables as PDSS-SR and ADIS-5 were not normally distrib-
uted. For the ADIS-5 CSR, there was convergent validity 
with panic disorder (r = 0.56) and agoraphobia (r = 0.39), 
with  no  significant  correlation  observed  for  other  anxi-
ety and related disorders, except generalized anxiety dis-
order (r = 0.13). Correlations for each of the seven items 
with ADIS-5 CSR for panic disorder ranged from r = 0.40 
for  distress  to  r = 0.55  for  severity  of  anticipatory  anxi-
ety. Item correlations with ADIS-5 CSR for agoraphobia 
ranged  from  r = 0.24  for  distress  to  r = 0.46  for  agora-
phobic  fear  and  avoidance.  For  other  ADIS-5  CSR  diag-
nosis, there were no item correlations over r = 0.21 (i.e., 
work  impairment  correlated  with  generalized  anxiety 
disorder).

Considering  convergent  validity  based  on  self-report 
measures,  the  PDSS-SR  was  more  correlated  with  BAI 
(r = 0.63)  and  MIA  (with  a  companion:  r = 0.50,  alone: 
r = 0.47) than with SDS (r = 0.37). As the correlation with 
the  PHQ-9  was  low  (r = 0.28),  but  significant,  a  test  of 
dependent  correlation  was  computed  by  comparing  the 
correlation  between  PDSS-SR,  BAI  and  PHQ-9.  Results

showed  that  the  PDSS-SR  was  more  correlated  with 
the  BAI  than  the  PHQ-9  (z = 5.11,  p < 0.001).  Moreover, 
the  correlation  between  PDSS-SR  and  PHQ-9  was  not 
significant  after  adjusting  for  SDS  with  partial  correla-
tions  (r = 0.10,  p = 0.11).  For  discriminant  validity  with 
other  self-report  measures,  the  correlation  was  lower 
with SPIN (r = 0.17), PSWQ (r = 0.11) and ISI (r = 0.19). 
PDSS-SR  items  were  predominantly  correlated  with 
the  BAI  (r = 0.44  to  r = 0.53),  the  MIA  accompanied 
and  alone  (r = 0.27  to  r = 0.50)  and  the  SDS  (r = 0.21  to 
r = 0.46) than with other measures.

Sensitivity and specificity of cut-off scores

A  ROC  curve  analysis  was  performed  to  detect  partici-
pants for whom DSM-5 criteria were met for panic disor-
der within our sample, based on the PDSS-SR score (see 

Fig. 1). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.82 (95% CI 
0.77-0.87; p < 0.001). The Youden index indicated that the 
optimal  threshold  was  9  with  a  sensitivity  of  78.8%  and 
a specificity of 70.4%. In our sample, this corresponds to 
a  positive  predictive  value  (PPV)  of  64.6%  and  a  nega-
tive predictive value (NPV) of 82.9%. The Supplementary 
Table  1  presents  sensitivity,  specificity,  Youden  index, 
PPV and NPV for each cut-point for the PDSS-SR.

A  ROC  curve  analysis  was  also  performed  to  detect 
panic  disorder  based  on  the  2-item  PDSS-SR  composed 
of items 2 (i.e., distress during panic attacks) and 4 (i.e., 
agoraphobic  avoidance)  [11].  The  correlation  with  the 
original  scale  was  r = 0.93  and  the  AUC  was  0.80  (95% 
CI 0.74-0.85; p < 0.001). The best cut-off for the very brief 
scale was 4, with a sensitivity of 60.6% and a specificity of 
85.5%.

of participants (n = 42) met criteria for clinical improve-
ment  based  on  an  ADIS  CSR  score < 4  or  a  decrease  of 
at  least  2  points.  From  the  linear  mixed  model,  no  sig-
nificant difference was observed in time or in group, but 
the interaction was significant, with a larger decrease in 
PDSS-SR  score  over  time  in  the  intervention  condition 
(difference  between  group  of  4.31;  95%  CI  1.63–6.99, 
p = 0.002).

Discussion
We  conducted  a  cross-cultural  translation  and  valida-
tion  of  the  PDSS-SR  for  French-Canadians  based  on 
secondary  data  from  a  clinical  trial  on  transdiagnostic 
group  cognitive-behavioral  therapy  for  anxiety  disor-
ders in adults. Data for the validation study were drawn 
from the initial assessment of potential participants with 
anxiety symptoms interested in enrolling in the trial and 
from a subset of participants with panic disorder enrolled 
in  the  trial  with  a  complete  dataset  at  posttreatment  to 
examine  sensitivity  to  change.  The  results  obtained  are 
essentially similar to those reported for the original Eng-
lish language version of the PDSS-SR [2] and from subse-
quent  validation  studies  [5,  6,  8–10],  which  support  the 
relevance of this self-report instrument in measuring the 
severity of panic disorder.

The  factor  structure  of  the  PDSS-SR  is  not  consist-
ent  across  studies.  The  EFA  and  CFA  suggested  a  one-
factor  structure  well  represented  by  all  the  seven  items, 
with 65.5% of the variability explained by this factor, that 
was  consistent  with  Lee  et  al.  [8].  Santacana  et  al.  [10] 
reported a two-factor structure (items 1 and 2,items 3 to 
7). Liu et al. [9] also obtained a closely related two-factor 
loading (items 1 to 3,items 4 to 7). Svensson et al. [6] were 
more cautious in stating that the CFA did not confirm a 
two-factor structure, but the EFA suggested a two-factor 
structure.  While  our  study  does  not  resolve  the  issue  of 
the  factor  structure  for  the  PDSS-SR,  it  complements 
previous  studies  with  a  heterogenous  sample  of  partici-
pants with diverse anxiety and related disorders, and with 
extensive comorbidity.

The  results  of  the  validation  showed  excellent  inter-
nal  consistency,  with  moderate  to  high  correlations 
between  items  (i.e.,  0.49  to  0.79),  and  the  deletion  of 
any  items  would  not  improve  the  Cronbach’s  alpha. 
The  mean  PDSS-SR  score  was  comparable  to  the  initial 
study’s mean score of 9.0 (SD = 6.6) with a mixed sample 
of  outpatients  [2],  and  lower  than  in  studies  conducted 
exclusively  with  patients  meeting  panic  disorder  crite-
ria,  ranging  from  10.49  (SD = 4.58)  in  the  Chinese  sam-
ple [9], to 10.82 (SD = 5.06) in the Korean version [8], to 
12.43  (SD = 4.51)  in  the  Swedish  version  [6]  and  12.57 
(SD = 5.33) in the Spanish version [10].

Sensitivity to change

We completed the sensitivity analysis with a subgroup of 
72 patients for whom ADIS-5 criteria were met for panic 
disorder  at  baseline,  and  who  were  enrolled  in  the  trial 
with a complete dataset at T0 and T1 (Fig. 2). Two defi-
nitions of clinical improvement were examined. First, we 
conducted  a  comparative  analysis  between  participants 
randomized  to  the  intervention  condition  (n = 36)  com-
pared to participants in the TAU only active control con-
dition  (n = 36).  At  T0,  there  was  no  difference  in  mean 
(SD) score for PDSS-SR in intervention and control con-
ditions  respectively  (12.6 ± 5.0  vs  12.3 ± 5.8;  p = 0.777). 
Results of the linear mixed model indicated a significant 
difference in time (p = 0.009) and a significant difference 
for the interaction (difference between group of 3.74; 95% 
CI  1.29–6.18,  p = 0.003),  suggesting  that  the  decrease  in 
PDSS-SR  score  over  time  was  significantly  larger  in  the 
intervention  condition.  Second,  we  categorized  partici-
pants  (n = 67)  based  on  clinical  outcomes  as  an  indica-
tor  of  significant  clinical  improvement.  Overall,  62.7%

Our  results  demonstrate  good  construct  validity  for 
the  French-Canadian  PDSS-SR,  with  the  scale  correlat-
ing significantly with the clinician-reported ADIS-5 CSR 
for  panic  disorder  and  agoraphobia,  but  not  with  other 
anxiety  and  related  disorders.  For  self-report  measures 
of anxiety, the highest correlations were observed for the 
general  measure  of  anxiety  (i.e.,  BAI),  agoraphobia  (i.e., 
MIA)  and  disability  (i.e.,  SDS),  but  significant  correla-
tions were also noted for symptoms of social anxiety dis-
order (i.e., SPIN), insomnia (i.e., ISI) and depression (i.e., 
PHQ-9). This  was  expected  due  to  high  rates  of  comor-
bidity  in  our  mixed  sample  of  participants  with  anxiety 
and depressive symptoms. In other validation studies, the 
examination of the same concepts led to overall moderate 
to  large  significant  correlations  with  diverse  self-report 
instruments, and variations in range were expected con-
sidering  the  clinical  characteristics  of  each  sample  in 
terms  of  principal  diagnosis,  comorbidity  and  severity. 
In  the  Lee  et  al.  (2009)  [8]  study  based  on  a  sample  of 
patients  with  principal  diagnoses  of  panic  disorder,  cor-
relations with general anxiety with the BAI were similar, 
but  were  higher  for  agoraphobia  and  depression.  Sven-
sson  et  al.  [6]  also  reported  a  similar  correlation  with 
agoraphobia,  but  a  higher  correlation  with  depression. 
Wuyek  et  al.  [5]  reported  lower  range  correlations  with 
self-report agoraphobia (r = 0.27-0.29), which could per-
haps  be  related  to  the  exclusion  of  interference  items  of 
the scale. Also of interest, the correlation with disability 
(r = 0.37) was lower  than for  the other studies  using the 
same  self-report  measure  with  respectively  r = 0.77  and 
r = 0.63 [6, 10]. To explore the impact of a predominantly 
panic  disorder  sample  on  correlations  with  disability, 
we  conducted  a  subgroup  analysis  with  participants  for 
whom DSM-5 criteria for panic disorder were met in our 
sample,  and  the  correlation  with  disability  increased  to 
r = 0.56.

We  examined  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the 
7-item  PDSS-SR  as  a  potential  screener  for  panic  disor-
der.  The  optimal  statistical  cut-off  to  identify  panic  dis-
order in our heterogenous sample was 9 according to the 
ROC curve, with higher sensitivity (78.8%) and specific-
ity  (70.4%),  which  is  same  cut-point  reported  by  Forsell 
et  al.  [11].  However,  it  is  in  contrast  with  the  cut-point 
of  4  identified  by  Liu  et  al.  [9]  that  presented  high  sen-
sitivity  (96.0%)  but  lower  specificity  (61.3%).  Choosing 
the  optimal  threshold  is  challenging  and  depends  on 
the  research  or  clinical  goal  of  the  assessment,  regard-
ing the potential consequences of false positive and false 
negative classification. The dissimilar curve profiles may 
be  related  to  the  comparison  group  without  panic  dis-
order  in  both  studies,  as  Liu  et  al.  [9]  included  patients 
with  other  anxiety  disorders  and  also  “healthy  subjects.” 
The  examination  of  cut-points  applicable  in  clinical  and 

research  settings  is  a  key  emergent  area  of  psychomet-
ric  research  with  the  PDSS-SR,  and  we  provided  a  sup-
plementary file with sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV 
to  support  decision  making  and  comparison  with  other 
studies to clarify optimal cut-points. For the exploratory 
examination  of  the  very  brief  PDSS-SR  for  screening, 
the optimal cut-point was determined as 4, and specific-
ity  was  high  (85.5%),  but  the  sensitivity  of  the  scale  was 
low (60.7%). As a comparison point, with the cut-off of 3 
established by Forsell et al. [11], the sensitivity was higher 
(74.0%) but the specificity was lower (71.1%), which may 
be preferable in a brief screening context.

Finally, we examined whether the PDSS-SR was sensi-
tive to change with a subsample of participants enrolled 
in  the  clinical  trial  for  whom  panic  disorder  diagnostic 
criteria  were  met  based  on  the  ADIS-5,  and  our  results 
are consistent with previous studies [8, 10]. They support 
sensitivity to change of the PDSS-SR when comparing the 
transdiagnostic group CBT condition and active control 
condition, as well as with a classification based on signifi-
cant clinical improvement.

Among the strengths of the study, we conducted a rig-
orous  adaptation  and  validation  of  the  PDSS-SR  with 
an  heterogenous  sample  of  participants  seeking  care  for 
anxiety disorders, with a range of principal and additional 
anxiety  and  related  disorders,  severity,  and  psychiatric 
comorbidity. These findings complement previous valida-
tion  studies  focusing  specifically  on  panic  disorder.  The 
convergent  validity  of  the  PDSS-SR  was  demonstrated 
with  the  clinician-administered  ADIS-5  according  to 
DSM-5  diagnostic  criteria,  an  analysis  not  yet  reported 
in  the  available  literature.  Shear  et  al.  [3]  had  initially 
demonstrated convergent validity between the clinician-
administered  PDSS  and  panic  disorder  diagnoses  with 
DSM-III-R. The clinical trial also allowed for the exami-
nation  of  sensitivity  to  change  with  clinician-reported 
and self-report measures. Among limitations to consider 
in  the  interpretation  of  the  results,  the  study  design  did 
not allow for temporal stability assessment and the soci-
odemographic  characteristics  of  the  sample  may  limit 
generalization, with a predominant sample of women and 
over 40% having a university degree.

Conclusion
Our  data  indicate  that  the  French-Canadian  PDSS-SR 
has comparable psychometrics properties to the original 
version of the PDSS-SR and provide further support for 
sensitivity to change as well as for the use of the instru-
ment  as  a  screener  with  a  cut-off  value.  These  are  key 
considerations  to  encourage  the  widespread  use  of  the 
PDSS-SR. The PDSS-SR is brief and closely aligned with 
DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for panic disorder, much like 
the  widely  used  PHQ-9  for  depression.  The  assessment

efficacy  and  brevity  of  the  PDSS-SR  for  panic  disorder 
provides support to increased use in research and clini-
cal  practice  to  screen  for  panic  disorder  and  to  assess 
diagnostic-specific  clinical  progress  over  time.  Further-
more, while global measures of anxiety symptomatology 
are often used in epidemiological surveys, clinical trials 
and mental health monitoring, the PDSS-SR contributes 
to the perspective that efficient diagnosis-specific meas-
urement  for  anxiety  disorders  is  also  attainable  at  the 
population level.
