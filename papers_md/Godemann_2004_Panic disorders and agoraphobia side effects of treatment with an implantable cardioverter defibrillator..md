Summary

Background: Implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD)
treatment has reduced the mortality of patients with a high risk
of sudden cardiac death. However, ICD discharges may cause
anxiety with respect to new discharges and lead to preventive,
for example, phobic, behavior. This study evaluated the fre-
quency of panic disorders and agoraphobia in patients with
ICD and assessed the risk factors in their development.

Hypothesis: Treatment with ICD represents a risk factor in

the development of anxiety disorders.

Methods: Ninety patients with ICD were examined using a
standardized  lifetime  Diagnostic  Interview  of  Psychiatric
Syndromes (DIPS). This interview makes it possible to esti-
mate the incidence of panic disorders and agoraphobia. The
impact of the severity of the underlying cardiac disease, the
number of ICD discharges, and the subjective appraisal of the
shock experience on the development of panic disorders and
agoraphobia was assessed.

Results: Fifteen patients (16.7%) developed anxiety disor-
ders after ICD implantation. The incidence was 21% in pa-
tients with and 6.9% in patients without ICD discharge. In
patients with two or more ICD discharges annually, the inci-
dence of panic disorders and agoraphobia was higher than

that in patients with a single ICD discharge annually (62 vs.
10%,  p < 0.01).  The  intensity  of  self-observation  of  their
body was significantly related to the development of anxiety
disorders (p < 0.001).

Conclusion: Panic disorders and agoraphobia are frequent
side effects of ICD treatment. Risk factors in the development
of these disorders are two or more ICD discharges annually
and a negative cognitive appraisal of ICD discharges. Thera-
peutic efforts should aim at reducing the number of ICD dis-
charges and provide early psychological treatment.

Introduction

In the United States, more than 300,000 individuals die an-
nually from sudden cardiac death,1 and an estimated 500,000
people  experience  out-of-hospital  cardiac  arrest  each  year.
Those who survive have a high recurrence rate of malignant ar-
rhythmias or sudden death. Since its introduction 20 years ago,
the implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) has been used
in an increasing number of patients to prevent sudden death.
Implantation of an ICD lowers overall mortality in patients
with documented malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias.2–4
In addition, ICD therapy improves survival in high-risk pa-
tients who had never previously experienced a sustained ven-
tricular tachyarrhythmia.5, 6 Thus, ICD treatment is becoming
an increasingly important factor, both for the primary and the
secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death.

Implantable cardioverter/defibrillator shock delivery for the
termination of rapid ventricular tachyarrhythmias may cause
sudden severe pain.7 Since the 1980s, there have been reports
of patients with ICD suffering from symptoms of depression
and anxiety.8, 9 Some authors7, 10 found a correlation between
the number of shocks and anxiety, but others did not.8, 11, 12
The latter interpret anxiety symptoms as a consequence of
cognitions, especially the fear of dying.12

A major drawback in these studies is that anxiety symptoms
were mainly assessed by self-rating instruments (e.g., Spiel-
berger’s state anxiety inventory).13 This, however, does not al-
low for the determination of a specific psychiatric disease. A
clinical psychiatric examination has only been performed in
small groups of patients with ICD.8, 9, 14 In these studies, no or
only minimal association was found between shocks and psy-
chiatric disorders. Furthermore, there was no information on
whether these anxiety disorders developed after ICD implan-
tation or whether they were related to the underlying heart dis-
ease or to the side effects of ICD therapy.

We therefore used a standardized diagnostic interview, to-
gether  with  multiple-level  self-  and  observer-rating  instru-
ments, to assess psychiatric morbidity, especially the incidence
of panic disorders and agoraphobia after ICD implantation,
and to identify factors contributing to their development.

Materials and Methods

Patient Population

All patients with ICD currently involved in long-term out-
patient monitoring at the Department of Cardiology at the Free
University  of  Berlin  and  the  German  Heart  Institute  were
asked to participate in the study. Patients were not included
when (1) their place of residence was outside of Berlin, (2)
ICD implantation was < 1 year previously, or (3) language or
intellectual and/or physical restrictions were present that did
not allow the diagnostic assessment used in the study.

Diagnostic Assessment

Patients were examined using the Diagnostic Interview of
Psychiatric Disorders (DIPS),15 a semi-structured, standard-
ized interview that focuses on the diagnosis of anxiety disor-
ders and registers both the presence of a mental disorder and
the time at which it developed (e.g., before or after ICD im-
plantation). Therefore, DIPS allows the exact calculation of
the prevalence and a good estimation of the incidence of psy-
chiatric disorders. All patients participating in this study were
well able to remember the start of their panic attacks. The in-
terview is based on the diagnostic criteria in the revised Diag-
nostic Statistical Manual III (DSM-III-R). To fulfill the crite-
ria for panic disorders, patients have to be subject to repeated
attacks  of  anxiety  with  bodily  sensations  such  as  vertigo,
sweating, and paresthesia; specific catastrophic thoughts like
“I will die” or “I will fall down and nobody will help me;” and
a continuous fear of new attacks.16 Agoraphobia is an anxiety
disorder associated with avoidance of complex stimuli such as
crowed  places  (e.g.,  supermarkets),  crowds,  and  cramped
spaces (e.g., elevators).16

Patients with a history of ICD discharges filled out a self-
assessment scale on cognitive coping with shocks. The scale
consisted of seven items that had to be answered on a five-point
Liket scale (“I do not agree” to “I agree fully”) (internal consis-
tency: Crohnbach’s alpha 0.86). This instrument was designed

by us, as no other published instruments are available that ade-
quately assess coping styles in patients with ICD discharges.

Implantable Cardioverter/Defibrillator Therapy Definitions

The patients were treated with third-generation ICDs capa-
ble of delivering shock therapy and antitachycardia pacing.
All ICD devices were programmed with a ventricular tachy-
cardia (VT) and a ventricular fibrillation (VF) zone. In the 
VT zone, usually four ramp sequences were programmed,
followed by shock therapy. In the VF zone, only shocks with
the maximum shock level of 30–34 J were programmed. If
patients were not pacemaker dependent, the bradycardiac in-
tervention frequency was programmed at 40 beats/min. The
number of shocks and shock clusters delivered by the ICD
were registered. A shock cluster is defined as being more than
three discharges within 24 h. Shock episodes were classified
as appropriate if symptoms such as presyncope or syncope
occurred, if the evaluation of the ICD Holter monitor revealed
a sudden-onset tachycardia and a stability < 30 ms, and if an
intracardial electrogram from the ICD memory showed al-
tered  QRS  complexes.  If  these  criteria  were  not  fulfilled,
shock episodes were classified as “inappropriate” and defined
as supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (i.e., sinus tachycardia
or atrial fibrillation).

Statistical Analysis

The statistical evaluation was performed using the Statis-
tical Package for Social Sciences, version 10.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, Ill., USA). Differences in continuous variables be-
tween subgroups of patients were assessed by t-tests. Associa-
tions between continuous variables or nominal variables were
analyzed by chi-square tests. The Mann-Whitney U-test was
used to compare ranges of cognitive shock appraisals in pa-
tients with as opposed to without anxiety disorders. A multi-
variate regression analysis was used to determine the effect of
different variables on the development of panic disorders and
agoraphobia. Statistical significance was defined for a p value
of < 0.05.

Results

A  total  of  126  patients  fulfilled  the  inclusion  criteria.
Thirty-three patients refused to take part in the study and three
patients were excluded from the analysis because they had al-
ready suffered from an anxiety disorder prior to ICD implan-
tation. Thus, 90 patients (mean age 59.5 years, 86.7% men)
were included in the analysis. The characteristics of this pa-
tient population are given in Table I. Of the study patients,
56.7%  had  been  resuscitated  prior  to  ICD  implantation;
67.8% of patients with ICD had experienced at least one ICD
shock. There was no difference between included and exclud-
ed patients regarding age, gender, and ejection fraction.

Panic disorder and/or agoraphobia could be diagnosed in 15
patients (16.7%). According to DSM-III-R criteria, we found

an isolated panic disorder in two cases, an isolated agorapho-
bia in eight, and a combination of panic disorder and agora-
phobia in five. Most of these disorders developed within the
first year after ICD implantation. In addition, 12 depressive
disorders, 2 social phobias, 6 specific phobias, and 1 alcohol
dependency were diagnosed. Six depressive disorders devel-
oped after ICD implantation, whereas the other psychiatric
disorders had developed prior to ICD implantation.

During follow-up, 61 of the 90 patients (68%) had ICD dis-
charges. In these patients, the incidence of panic disorders
and agoraphobia was 21% (13/61). In contrast, those patients
without ICD discharge had a significantly lower incidence at
6.9% (2/29). As shown in Table II, patients with anxiety dis-
orders had approximately four times as many ICD discharges
compared with patients without anxiety disorders. The inci-
dence of patients with two or more ICD discharges per year

was 62% (8/13), whereas only 10% of patients (5/48) had less
than two ICD discharges per year (p < 0.01). There was no
difference between the two groups with regard to age, gender,
underlying cardiac disease, ejection fraction, duration of fol-
low-up after ICD implantation, or history of cardiac arrest
with successful resuscitation.

Cognitive coping style with respect to ICD discharge was
significantly related to the development of anxiety (Table III).
Patients with anxiety disorders pay more attention to possible
body changes and are constantly expecting the next discharge.
In addition, patients with anxiety disorders report more affec-
tive symptoms; they feel depressed after ICD shocks and re-
port more anxiety with regard to the next ICD discharge.

A multivariate logistic regression showed that the coping
style (odds ratio 2.3) and the number of ICD clusters (odds ra-
tio 2.3) are risk factors in the development of panic disorders
and agoraphobia, predicting the difference between patients
with and without anxiety disorders (Table IV).

Discussion

This study investigated the psychiatric status of patients
with ICD and, using structured psychiatric assessment meth-
ods, analyzed the impact of psychological and somatic var-
iables on the development of anxiety disorders. The main find-
ings are that patients with ICD are under substantial risk of
developing panic disorders and agoraphobia following ICD
implantation, and that both the number of ICD discharges and
catastrophic cognitions contribute to the development of these
anxiety disorders.

Incidence of Anxiety Disorders

In our study, the incidence of panic disorders and/or agora-
phobia in patients with ICD was 16.7%. This is approximate-
ly 100 times higher than that in the general population, in
which the 1-year incidence of panic disorders has been found
to be 0.14%.17 Other authors have reported a smaller inci-
dence of panic disorders and agoraphobia (range 5–15%) in
patients with ICD.8, 9, 14 However, the patient population in
these studies was smaller and the follow-up shorter compared
with our study. Furthermore, the reported number of shocks
was lower (between 33 and 50%) of patients.8, 12 By contrast,
in our study approximately two-thirds of the patients experi-
enced ICD discharges. Overall, our results indicate that, in the
context of ICD treatment, panic disorders and agoraphobia are
frequent and may be both a characteristic finding in this severe-
ly sick patient population and, in part, a side effect of this life-
saving therapy.

Relation between Implantable Cardioverter/Defibrillator
Shocks and the Development of Anxiety Disorders

In our study, 68% of patients had ICD shocks after ICD im-
plantation. In this group, the incidence of anxiety disorders
was higher than in those patients who had not suffered shocks.
There was no relation between the incidence of anxiety dis-
orders  and  the  underlying  cardiac  disease,  left  ventricular
ejection fraction, or other cardiac parameters. These findings
suggest that anxiety disorders are not primarily related to the
severity of the underlying cardiac disease, but may be directly

associated with ICD shocks. Our data are consistent with
some7, 10, 18 but not all previous studies.8, 9 In a small series of
patients, Lüderitz et al.7 found that patients receiving more
than five shocks showed a significant increase in anxiety dur-
ing a 12-month follow-up. In another retrospective analysis,
approximately 50% of patients with ICD reported anxiety re-
lated to ICD discharges, and for 30% of patients ICD shock
delivery was the most distressing aspect of ICD treatment.10
Hermann et al. found that negative attitudes in patients with
ICD are more frequent in those who have received shocks
during follow-up.18 By contrast, Chevalier et al.8 found no re-
lation between psychological well-being and ICD discharges.
In their study, 10 patients suffered from a psychiatric illness (4
from depression, 2 from phobia, and 4 from a general anxiety
disorder), but the authors could not show any relation with the
number of shocks. However, in that study only 15 patients
(45%) experienced a shock, and the total number of shocks is
not reported. Another small study with only 20 patients could
not show a correlation between psychiatric syndromes and
the number of shocks, but there was a tendency for inadver-
tent shocks to be associated with psychiatric disorders such as
depression or panic disorders.9

Our results suggest that the psychological theory of classic
conditioning plays an important role as a potential mechanism
for the development of anxiety disorders.19 This theory states
that an aversive unconditioned stimulus such as an ICD dis-
charge is associated with unpleasant body sensations. The sen-
sations are linked to information on the environment of the pa-
tients (e.g., confined places), which then become conditioned
and may subsequently evoke discomfort and anxiety even
without the original stressor.20 Patients then try to reduce this
discomfort by avoiding certain stimuli that may indicate im-
pending discomfort. This initiates an operant conditioning
mechanism which may lead to progressive avoidance behav-
ior, that is, phobic reactions.21

Catastrophic Fears—A Possible Risk Factor in the
Development of Anxiety Disorders

Since avoidance behavior is mediated by cognitive process-
es, patients with anxiety tend to interpret body sensations as
catastrophic events,22, 23 and more especially as indicators of
impending catastrophes; as a consequence, they are prone to
observe  themselves  more  intensely.24 We  have  also  found
these characteristics in our patients, who paid great attention to
their bodies in order to avoid being surprised by an ICD dis-
charge (Table IV). Our results are consistent with the data of
Pauli et al.,12 who reported that patients with ICD with high
anxiety  levels  have  increased  catastrophic  fears  compared
with healthy controls. Although patients with anxiety disor-
ders do not have a different perception of their heart rhythm
from that of normal subjects,25 they are constantly trying not to
overlook the prodroma of an ICD discharge. They also try to
avoid potentially dangerous situations which may, in the final
instance, lead to avoidance behavior. This operant negative re-
inforcement has been found to be the core process in the devel-
opment of phobias. Thus, anxiety levels may be related more

closely to cognitive concepts than to objectively distressing
experiences  or  medical  complications.12 These  cognitive
schemata may be both a consequence and expression of anxi-
ety following psychological traumatization by ICD discharges
and a premorbid characteristic shown by the patients; howev-
er, it could also be that higher anxiety levels and dysfunctional
schemata increase the probability of shocks by triggering VT.
Another aspect of the development of anxiety disorder is
that patients with malignant tachyarrhythmias, who have also
experienced resuscitated cardiac arrest, have a fear of dying
suddenly. Prior to ICD implantation, this is surely a realistic
fear which should improve after ICD implantation.26, 10 The
reassuring and consoling effect of ICD therapy is clearly not
understood by all patients, since in one study12 26% of patients
still suffer from a fear of dying, even after ICD implantation.

Diagnostic and Therapeutic Consequences

The diagnosis of anxiety disorders in patients with ICD can
be a difficult clinical task, since anxiety problems are often re-
ported by the patients. Complex avoidance behavior, as found
in agoraphobia, is often misinterpreted by the patients them-
selves as successful coping. Furthermore, panic attacks rarely
occur in medical settings because patients feel secure in such
an environment.27 Therefore, it is necessary to ask patients
about certain anxiety characteristics and, in case of doubt, a
psychiatrist should be consulted.

A reduction of ICD discharges, including optimal pro-
gramming for each individual, probably reduces psycholog-
ical distress and may therefore reduce the incidence of anxi-
ety disorders. Thus, all efforts should be undertaken to avoid
inappropriate or appropriate ICD discharges by ICD pro-
gramming and, in some patients, by additional antiarrhyth-
mic drug treatment.28

Treatment with cognitive behavioral techniques29 has been
shown to be effective in the treatment of panic disorders and
agoraphobia. Pharmacologic treatment options are serotoner-
gic reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) such as paroxetine.30 Benzodi-
azepines are a reasonable method of treatment for reducing
acute anxiety states, mainly in panic disorders, although there
is a risk of the patient developing a dependency. Bourke et al.14
reported on three patients with ICD with panic disorders or
agoraphobia, who were successfully treated by cognitive be-
havioral therapy in combination with benzodiazepines and
SSRI; however, controlled clinical trials on the treatment of
anxiety disorders in patients with ICD have not been undertak-
en so far.

Limitations

A limitation of this study is the retrospective cross-section-
al design and the variable time of patient exploration after ICD
implantation. However, the estimation of the incidence of anx-
iety disorders was based on a validated psychiatric lifetime in-
terview, which allows the starting point of psychiatric diseases
to be determined.

Conclusion

Clin. Cardiol. Vol. 27, June 2004

The present study shows that panic disorders and agora-
phobia are frequent after ICD implantation, and that the inci-
dence of these disorders is related to the occurrence of ICD
discharges. The results further support central psychological
theories such as classical and operant conditioning with cog-
nitive paradigms in the development of anxiety disorders. It 
is necessary to look carefully for psychiatric disorders in pa-
tients with ICD, so that treatment can start as early as possible.
