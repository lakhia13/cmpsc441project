Researchers
circumstances may precipitate more severe grief following COVID-19 deaths compared to
(other) natural deaths. Systematic research on these hypotheses may help identify those
most at risk for severe grief reactions, yet it is scant.
Objective: To compare loss characteristics, loss circumstances, and grief levels among people
bereaved due to COVID-19, natural, and unnatural causes.
Methods: Adults bereaved through COVID-19 (n = 99), natural causes (n = 1006), and unnatural
causes (n = 161) completed an online survey. We administered self-report measures of
demographic variables (i.e., age, gender), loss characteristics (i.e., time since loss, relationship
with the deceased, intensive care admission, expectedness of death), loss circumstances (i.e.,
saying goodbye appropriately, COVID-19 infection, quarantine, ﬁnancial setbacks, social
support satisfaction, altered funeral arrangements, funeral satisfaction), and prolonged grief
symptoms.
Results: COVID-19 deaths (vs. other deaths) more often were parental deaths and less often
child deaths. COVID-19 deaths (vs. natural deaths) were more often unexpected and
characterized by an inability to say goodbye appropriately. People bereaved due to COVID-
19 (vs. other deaths) were more often infected and quarantined. COVID-19 deaths (vs. other
deaths) more often involved intensive care admission and altered funeral arrangements.
COVID-19 deaths yielded higher grief levels than natural deaths (but not unnatural deaths).
Expectedness of the death and the inability to say goodbye appropriately explained this eﬀect.

Conclusions: Bereavement due to COVID-19 is characterized by a unique set of
characteristics and circumstances and elevated grief levels. Improving opportunities to say
goodbye before and after death (e.g., by means of rituals) may provide an important means
to prevent and reduce severe grief following COVID-19 deaths.

COVID-19, duelo natural y no natural: comparaciones exhaustivas de las
circunstancias de la pérdida y la gravedad del duelo

Antecedentes: El duelo agudo es más severo después de las muertes por COVID-19 que las
muertes naturales. El trastorno de duelo prolongado (PGD, por sus siglas en inglés) también
parece ser prevalente después de las muertes por COVID-19. Los investigadores plantean la
hipótesis de que las características especíﬁcas de la pérdida y las circunstancias relacionadas
con la pandemia pueden precipitar un duelo más severo después de las muertes por
COVID-19 en comparación con las muertes naturales. La investigación sistemática sobre
estas hipótesis puede ayudar a identiﬁcar a las personas con mayor riesgo de sufrir
reacciones de duelo graves, pero es escasa.
Objetivo: Comparar las características de la pérdida, las circunstancias de la pérdida y los
niveles de duelo entre las personas en duelo debido al COVID-19, causas naturales y no
naturales.
Métodos: Adultos en duelo por COVID-19 (n = 99), causas naturales (n = 1006) y causas no
naturales (n = 161) completaron una encuesta en línea. Administramos medidas de
autoinforme de variables demográﬁcas, características de la pérdida (es decir, ingreso en
cuidados intensivos, muerte inesperada), circunstancias de la pérdida (es decir, despedirse
adecuadamente, infección por COVID-19, cuarentena, contratiempos ﬁnancieros, satisfacción
con el apoyo social, arreglos funerarios alterados, satisfacción con el funeral), y síntomas de
trastorno de duelo prolongado.
Resultados: Las muertes por COVID-19 (frente a otras muertes) fueron con mayor frecuencia

naturales) fueron más a menudo inesperadas y se caracterizaron por la incapacidad de
despedirse adecuadamente. Las personas en duelo debido al COVID-19 (frente a otras
muertes) más frecuentemente se infectaron y tuvieron que hacer cuarentena. Las muertes
por COVID-19 (en comparación con otras muertes) involucraron con mayor frecuencia la
admisión a cuidados intensivos y la alteración de arreglos funerarios. Las muertes por
COVID-19 produjeron niveles de duelo más altos que las muertes naturales (pero no las
muertes no naturales). La expectativa de la muerte y la incapacidad de decir adiós
explicaron apropiadamente este efecto.
Conclusiones: El duelo por COVID-19 se caracteriza por un conjunto único de características y
circunstancias de pérdida y niveles elevados de duelo. Mejorar las oportunidades para decir
adiós antes y después de la muerte (p. ej., mediante rituales) puede proporcionar un medio
importante para prevenir y reducir el duelo después de las muertes por COVID-19.

COVID-19、自然和非自然丧亲：丧失情况和哀伤严重程度的综合比较

Dear Editor,

With over 6 million registered deaths the COVID-
19 pandemic has left an estimated 54 million people
(Verdery, Smith-Greenaway,
bereaved worldwide
Margolis, & Daw, 2020; World Health Organization,
2022). COVID-19 deaths are believed to increase the
prevalence of severe, persistent and disabling grief,
termed prolonged grief disorder (PGD) (Eisma, Boe-
len, & Lenferink, 2020; Wallace, Wladkowski, Gibson,
& White, 2020). PGD is included in the International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases eleventh edition (ICD-11:
World Health Organization, 2018) and in a diﬀerent
form in the text revision of the Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5-TR: Amer-
ican Psychiatric Association, 2020).

Speciﬁcally, loss characteristics, such as intensive
care admission and unexpected death, and loss cir-
cumstances, such as infection, quarantine, diﬃculties
saying goodbye, altered funeral services, ﬁnancial set-
backs, and reduced social support, are hypothesized to
interfere with the grieving process (e.g. Eisma et al.,
2020; Wallace et al., 2020). Accordingly, many
researchers predict a worldwide increase in PGD and
associated mental health problems (e.g. Eisma et al.,
2020; Gesi et al., 2020; Simon, Saxe, & Marmar, 2020).
Some quantitative studies have shed light on grief
following COVID-19 deaths. One study showed that

acute grief in the ﬁrst 6 months post-loss is more
severe following COVID-19 deaths than (other) natu-
ral deaths but not unnatural deaths (Eisma, Tam-
minga, Smid, & Boelen, 2021). Other researchers
demonstrated high symptom levels of acute and pro-
longed grief, posttraumatic stress, depression, and
anxiety in COVID-19 bereaved samples (Breen, Lee,
& Neimeyer, 2021; Murata et al., 2021; Tang, Yu,
Chen, Fan, & Eisma, 2021). Together, this suggest a
higher prevalence of PGD and related mental health
problems following COVID-19 deaths (Eisma & Boe-
len, in press).

To identify who is most at risk following COVID-
19 deaths, some researchers have examined associ-
ations between demographic and loss-characteristics
in COVID-19 bereaved samples (Breen
and grief
et al., 2021; Eisma et al., 2021; Neimeyer & Lee,
2021; Tang et al., 2021). However, the speciﬁc loss
characteristics and circumstances proposed to aggra-
vate grief reactions to COVID-19 deaths have not sys-
tematically been compared across causes of death,
making it unclear whether such factors explain vari-
ations in grief reactions. Therefore, we aimed to con-
such loss
duct a comprehensive comparison of
characteristics and circumstances between samples of
adults who have experienced deaths due to COVID-
19, natural causes, and unnatural causes. We included

variables that have been previously examined in this
context, including the relationship with the deceased,
expectedness of the death, and satisfaction with social
support (e.g. Eisma et al., 2021). Additionally, we have
included variables that have been proposed to inﬂu-
ence grief following COVID-19 deaths, yet that have
not yet been compared across loss types, namely
pre-death intensive care admission, the opportunity
to say goodbye, altered funeral arrangements, satisfac-
tion with the funeral, being infected with COVID-19
and quarantined oneself, and experiencing ﬁnancial
setbacks. We predicted that grief
levels following
COVID-19 deaths are higher than following natural
deaths (Eisma et al., 2021). We explored which loss
characteristics and circumstances explain these diﬀer-
ences to help identify factors that could be instrumen-
tal in preventing and mitigating severe grief reactions
following COVID-19 deaths.

Methods

The Ethical Committee Psychology of the University of
Groningen approved the present version of
this
ongoing study (date: 7-12-2021, registration number:
PSY-1819-S-0175). Adult bereaved participants were
recruited online on a Web site (www.psyned.nl) of a
Dutch national mental health care organization
(Psyned) where they could complete an online self-
test
for Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder
(Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
5, DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Before participating, people were presented with infor-
mation about the study procedure such as aims, anon-
ymity, and voluntariness. All participants provided
online informed consent. After survey completion, par-
ticipants received a preliminary indication if they met
criteria for Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder
per DSM-5 accompanied by a cautionary message on
its 12-month time-criterion and a disclaimer that only
a licensed professional can establish diagnoses. Two
papers were published on previously collected data
within this project (Eisma & Tamminga, 2020; Eisma
et al., 2021). The data analyzed for this study is new
and was collected between December 2020 and August
2021. This data collection period included a national
lockdown from December to March, the start of a vac-
cination programme in January, and loosening of gov-
ernment regulations from May to August.

The self-test included measures of demographic
characteristics (age, gender),
loss-related character-
istics (time since loss, relationship with the deceased,
cause of death, expectedness of the death, intensive
care admission) and circumstances (opportunity to
say goodbye appropriately, COVID-19 infection,
quarantine, ﬁnancial setbacks, and alterations in fun-
eral arrangements). We assessed satisfaction with
social support and satisfaction with the funeral on a

ﬁve-point Likert-scale (from very unsatisﬁed = 1 to
very satisﬁed = 5). Grief severity was measured with
Inventory Self Report Plus
the Traumatic Grief
(TGI-SR+) (Lenferink, Smid, de Keijser, & Boelen,
2022). This 22-item scale assesses current criteria for
PGD per ICD-11 and DSM-5-TR on a ﬁve-point
Likert-scale (from 1 = never to 5 = always). Since few
adults bereaved due to COVID-19 within our sample
met time-criteria of these disorders, summed scores
of items tapping symptoms of PGDICD-11 (α = .88)
and PGDDSM-5-TR (α = .88) were the dependent vari-
ables in the group comparisons.

Prior to the analyses, duplicates (n = 53), non-
adults (n = 60), participants that did not complete
the additional questions (n = 15), and participants lab-
elling the cause of loss as ‘diﬀerent’ (n = 191), were
removed from the dataset, leaving 1266 participants.

demographic and loss characteristics,
stances, and symptom levels using Fisher’s exact test
for categorical variables and ANOVAs with Least
Square Diﬀerence post-hoc tests (implying a two-
sided signiﬁcance level of .05 for these tests) for con-
tinuous variables. For signiﬁcant group diﬀerences
on grief levels, we examined which dummy coded

ANCOVAs. SPSS 26.0 was used for all analyses. We
applied a two-sided signiﬁcance level of .05. Missing
data was handled through listwise deletion.

Results

Table 1 shows descriptive statistics and group com-
parisons of sociodemographic characteristics and
loss characteristics and circumstances reported by
adults bereaved by COVID-19, natural causes, and
unnatural causes. COVID-19 deaths yielded higher
grief levels than natural deaths (PGDICD-11, d = 0.31;
PGDDSM-5-TR, d = 0.23), but not unnatural deaths
(PGDICD-11 d = 0.16; PGDDSM-5-TR, d = 0.05). Since
comparison groups diﬀered on time since loss, we
ran a sensitivity analysis limiting group comparisons
on grief levels to people bereaved within the last 6
months due to COVID-19 (n = 76), unnatural causes
(n = 50), and natural causes (n = 450). This eliminated
diﬀerences on time since loss between people bereaved
due to COVID-19 and other causes (ps > .15). Again,
COVID-19 yielded more severe acute grief levels than
natural losses with the same eﬀect sizes (PGDICD-11, d
= 0.35, PGDDSM-5-TR, d = 0.23). However, the eﬀect on
PGDDSM-5-TR grief levels was only marginally signiﬁ-
cant (p = .068), likely due to power issues. Again, no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences
emerged
between those bereaved by unnatural deaths and

in acute

grief

COVID-19 deaths (PGDICD-11 d = 0.16; PGDDSM-5-TR,

Using the full sample, we ran two ANCOVAs (see
Supplemental File A), including variables showing sig-
niﬁcant group diﬀerences as (simpliﬁed dummy-
coded) covariates and cause of death (natural vs.
COVID-19) as a between-group factor, showing sig-
niﬁcant eﬀects on PGDICD-11 grief
levels, F(10,
1094) = 4.65, p < .001, and PGDDSM-5-TR grief levels,
F(11, 1094) = 3.50, p < .001. We regarded variables
that related signiﬁcantly to cause of death and grief
levels that rendered the association between these vari-
ables insigniﬁcant as mediators of this relationship (cf.
Baron & Kenny, 1986). Loss was ‘expected nor unex-
pected’ (vs. other), saying goodbye appropriately (vs.
not), and death of a parent (vs. other relation), fully

explained the group diﬀerence for PGDICD-11 grief
severity, F(1, 1094) = 2.95, p = .09, explaining 63% of
the relation between cause of death on grief severity.

between cause of death and grief severity.

Discussion

Parental bereavement was more common and child
bereavement was less common for COVID-19 deaths
compared to other types of death. Indeed, older adults
more frequently die from COVID-19 whereas children
are more often not severely aﬀected (Williamson et al.,

2020). COVID-19 deaths compared to natural deaths
were more unexpected, which aligns with the results
from one prior comparison study (Eisma et al.,
2021). COVID-19 bereaved compared to naturally
bereaved reported limited opportunities to say good-
bye appropriately. Possibly,
this can partly be
explained by the fact that COVID-19 deaths versus
other deaths are more frequently preceded by inten-
sive care admission and anteceded by altered funeral
services. Qualitative research has similarly identiﬁed
a lack of appropriate goodbyes and funeral rites as
an important stressor for people bereaved during the
pandemic (e.g. Hamid & Jahangir, forthcoming). We
also conﬁrmed the occurrence of secondary stressors
among COVID-19 bereaved persons (Eisma et al.,
2020; Gesi
experiencing
COVID-19 deaths versus other deaths had themselves
more often been infected and quarantined. Pandemic-
related ﬁnancial setbacks did not diﬀer across groups.
Satisfaction with both social support and funeral ser-
vices did not diﬀer across groups. This conﬁrms that
social support is not experienced diﬀerently across
loss types (Eisma et al., 2021). Additionally, it suggests
that the alterations of funeral services that are more
often experienced by people bereaved due
to
COVID-19 do not strongly aﬀect satisfaction with
these services.

Whereas prior studies focused only on a few loss-
related characteristics and circumstances proposed to
aﬀect grief due to COVID-19 deaths (e.g. Eisma
et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2021), the present study
focused on a more comprehensive selection of poten-
tial risk-factors (Eisma et al., 2020; Wallace et al.,
2020). Additionally, the inclusion of diﬀerent com-
parison groups of people experiencing natural deaths
and unnatural deaths enabled us to establish the
unique nature of loss-experiences and grief reactions
associated with COVID-19 bereavement. Limitations
include using a convenience sample, a cross-sectional
design, and self-report measures. The ﬁrst may pose a

we could not establish diagnoses. Additionally, only
Dutch bereaved adults were examined. While some

(Eisma & Boelen,
2021) particularly death expectedness and saying
goodbye appropriately appear important in under-
standing such diﬀerences in grief severity. Enabling
people to say goodbye to their loved ones within pal-
liative care setting appears an important goal to pre-
vent severe grief reactions. Treatment of people with
severe grief
following COVID-19 deaths may be
enhanced by exposure exercises focusing on the
events surrounding the death and applying farewell
rituals (Reitsma, Boelen, de Keijser, & Lenferink,
2021; Wojtkowiak, Lind, & Smid, 2021).
