An  increasing  number  of  universities  and  colleges  in  the  United  States  are 
offering  coursework  on  adaptive/therapeutic  riding  and  the  incorporation  of 
horses in human service areas such as psychotherapy, education, occupational 
therapy,  physical  therapy,  and  speech-language  pathology.  The  first  study 
to  identify  coursework  in  these  areas  was  published  in  2018.  In  order  to  track 
development  over  time,  we  conducted  a  replication  study  to  determine  the 
prevalence  of  coursework  on  horses  in  human  services  at  higher  education 
institutions.  Information  gathered  for  the  2021–2022  academic  year  included 
the  institution  name,  geographic  location,  number  of  courses  and  their  focus, 
academic department offering the course, and level of study. We identified 122 
courses provided by 48 higher education institutions in 29 states in the following 
areas: adaptive/therapeutic riding (N =  82, 67.2%), mental health (N =  19, 15.6%), 
education/learning  (N  =  2,  1.6%),  and  equine  movement  in  physical  therapy, 
occupational  therapy,  and  speech-language  pathology  (hippotherapy)  (N  =  1, 
0.8%).  Survey  or  overview  courses  (N  =  18,  14.8%)  were  also  identified.  These 
courses were offered both at the undergraduate (N =  114, 93.4%) and the graduate 
level (N =  8, 6.6%) by a total of 48 departments that either focused on animals, 
such as equine science, animal science, and agriculture (N =  27, 54%) or focused 
on humans, such as health science or liberal arts (N =  23, 46%). The results inform 
a discussion on changes over time as well as current challenges and opportunities 
for academic programs offering coursework about horses in human services.

1 Introduction

Interest in the inclusion of horses in human services and in adaptive/therapeutic riding 
continues to grow in the United States of America (USA). There are several human service and 
activity  areas  where  horses  are  involved,  which  determine  the  training  required  of  the 
professional providing the service. In the U.S., horses are included in two broad areas of human 
services: in therapy services and in education or learning services (1). Therapy services involve 
a  licensed  therapist  with  additional  training  who  may  incorporate  elements  of  equine 
interactions, equine movement, and the equine environment in their overall treatment approach 
and  plan,  tailored  to  the  client’s  needs  and  goals  (2).  Examples  include  the  use  of  equine 
movement  (hippotherapy)  in  physical  therapy,  occupational  therapy,  or  speech-language

pathology  services  (3)  and  interactions  with  horses  that  are 
incorporated  into  psychotherapy  (4).  Professionals  providing 
educational or learning services that are based on learning frameworks 
and  focused  on  goals  related  to  areas  such  as  skill  development, 
academic achievement, or organizational development can include 
equine interactions to enhance the service they are providing (1). 
Adaptive riding, a term used concurrently with therapeutic riding and 
therapeutic  horsemanship  lessons  (stylized  in  this  publication  as 
adaptive/therapeutic riding) is provided by an instructor and provides 
access  to  horses  and  horsemanship  activities  for  those  who  may 
experience disability-related barriers for interacting with horses in 
typical  equestrian  environments  or  who  otherwise  need 
accommodations when doing so (1).

Coursework focused on horses in human services and in adaptive/
therapeutic riding at universities and colleges in the United States has 
become more common. Undergraduate and graduate students who 
are  interested  in  pursuing  a  career  that  includes  interacting  with 
horses within these services or activities can find a variety of programs, 
courses, majors, minors, and certificates offered by higher education 
institutions.  The  content  of  these  offerings  varies  widely  in 
prerequisites, scope, specificity, learning objectives, and cost (5). With 
the exception of a conference that was organized by Middle Tennessee 
State University in 2014, specifically addressing coursework of this 
nature  in  higher  education  (6),  no  dedicated  network  exists  for 
academic professionals who administer coursework in these areas. 
This  may  contribute  to  delays  in  adopting  the  latest  terminology, 
concepts, and guidelines, and a lack of clarity about what constitutes 
foundational  and  advanced  knowledge  in  the  focus  area  of  the 
coursework.  The  Professional  Association  of  Therapeutic 
Horsemanship International (PATH Intl.) offers a higher education 
membership  to  academic  institutions  whose  coursework  enables 
students to become certified primarily in adaptive/therapeutic riding 
or that offer activities in this area at their college equestrian center (7). 
At  the  time  of  publication,  12  higher  education  institutions 
are members.

Coursework  on  horses  in  human  services  and  adaptive/
therapeutic  riding  in  higher  education  has  not  received  much 
attention  in  previous  literature.  A  total  of  eight  English-language 
articles were identified (5, 8–14), of which four were published as 
conference abstracts (8, 9, 13, 14). These articles focused primarily on 
adaptive/therapeutic  riding,  including  feasibility  to  implement 
coursework (12) and the education and skills preferred by adaptive/
therapeutic riding centers when hiring staff (10). In addition, four 
doctoral dissertations related to higher education coursework were 
found (15–18). Service-based learning opportunities in undergraduate 
programs  involving  adaptive/therapeutic  riding  have  also  been 
discussed (11, 19, 20).

With  the  exception  of  a  survey  focusing  on  the  number  of 
academic institutions with connections to North American Riding for 
the Handicapped Association (NARHA) adaptive/therapeutic riding 
centers  (NARHA  is  now  PATH  Intl.)  (8),  the  first  comprehensive 
review of coursework in U.S. universities and colleges concerning 
horses  in  human  services  and  adaptive/therapeutic  riding  was 
published in 2018 (5). The study, which was led by the second author 
of  the  present  study,  found  110  courses  offered  in  the  2016–2017 
academic year at 39 U.S. higher education institutions (universities 
and colleges). Courses were categorized per course content focus area, 
per geographic location (state), per level of learning (undergraduate 

or graduate), and per the department or academic area where the 
course was offered.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the current 
prevalence and nature of coursework focused on horses in human 
services  and  adaptive/therapeutic  riding  in  U.S.  higher  education 
institutions through a comprehensive scoping review, which included 
number  of  courses,  number  of  higher  education  institutions, 
geographic  location,  course  focus  area,  level  of  learning,  and 
department or academic area for the 2021–2022 academic year. In 
order to track development in this area over time, we replicated the 
most recent review conducted in this area (5).

2 Methods

As no registry or database exists for coursework involving horses 
in human services and adaptive/therapeutic riding, and in order to 
replicate  the  2018  study  (5),  we  conducted  a  scoping  review  via 
internet search. Scoping reviews allow researchers to identify and map 
the available evidence and identify knowledge gaps, and are especially 
appropriate when a topic has minimal preexisting academic research 
(21).  We  consulted  the  preferred  reporting  items  for  systematic 
reviews  and  meta-analyses  extension 
for  scoping  reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) in our reporting (22).

2.1 Inclusion criteria

We used the following criteria for selecting courses for inclusion 

in this review:

  a)  The  course  was  offered  by  an  accredited  post-secondary 
academic institution (university or college) in the United States.
 b)  The  course  was  listed  in  the  2021–2022  publicly  accessible, 
online academic course catalog, or, in the case of academic 
certificates, an online record of certificate being offered during 
2021 or 2022.

  c)  The course title and/or description referenced adaptive riding/
therapeutic riding or specified the incorporation of horses or 
equines  in  mental  health;  physical  therapy,  occupational 
therapy,  speech-language  pathology;  education/learning,  or 
was  described  as  a  survey  course  on  one  or  several  of 
these areas.

Special  topics  courses,  elective  courses,  internships,  and 
practicums that were not clearly identified in the course catalog as 
meeting criteria (c) were excluded from the review.

2.2 Information sources and search 
procedure

The search was conducted between April, 2022 and January 2023 
(10 months) using the internet search engine Google. The search terms 
used were “equine,” “horse,” “therapeutic,” “adaptive,” “equine-assisted,” 
“facilitated,” and “human-horse,” paired with “course,” “university,” 
“college,” and “higher education.” Examples of search results included 
a course or program webpage, a course catalog entry, a news story or 

Frontiers in Veterinary Science

Connolly and Ekholm Fry 

10.3389/fvets.2023.1305353

other informational item related to the institution. After evidence of 
a  course  and  accompanying  academic  institution  was  identified 
through  search  results,  we  located  the  2021–2022  course  catalog 
through the institution’s website search function and searched it using 
the  following  terms:  “equine,”  “horse,”  “therapeutic,”  “adaptive,” 
“equine-assisted,”  “facilitated,”  “therapy,”  “learning,”  and  “human-
horse.” In addition, when a course that met all three inclusion criteria 
was  identified,  it  was  cross-checked  with  the  dataset  used  in  the 
2018 study.

2.3 Data extraction and categorization

During data extraction, we recorded the following information: 
the course title and description, the name of the institution offering 
the course, the geographic location of the institution, the level of study 
(undergraduate  or  graduate),  and  the  academic  department  or 
academic area through which the course was offered. All items could 
be accessed for each course.

In the United States, undergraduate courses are offered within 
four-year bachelor’s degree programs, and two-year associate degree 
programs. In this study, we defined graduate-level courses as those 
offered within master or doctoral programs, post-masters programs, 
or other graduate-level certificate programs offered by a university. 
Following the groupings created in the 2018 study (5), we categorized 
departments or academic areas as either primarily focused on animals, 
such as equine science, animal science, and agriculture, or on humans, 
such as health science, social science, and liberal arts.

2.4 Determination of course content focus 
area

To  track  development  over  time  in  coursework  prevalence, 
we  used  the  same  five  categories  created  in  the  2018  study  (5)  to 
determine  course  focus  area.  Due  to  updates  in  terminology  and 
concepts, we renamed and updated the descriptions for each category 
(1).  This  did  not  substantially  alter  the  nature  of  the  categories. 
Importantly, when determining the focus area of each course, it was 
necessary to evaluate the nature of course content not simply through 
terms used but through the context provided by the course description. 
All focus area determinations were rated by both authors and any 
discrepancies  were  resolved  by  discussion.  We  used  the  following 
descriptions for the focus areas.

2.4.1 Adaptive/therapeutic riding

Adaptive riding, also known as therapeutic riding and therapeutic 
horsemanship (1), is the provision of riding and other horsemanship 
lessons to individuals who may experience disability-related barriers 
for interacting with horses in typical equestrian environments or who 
otherwise need accommodations when doing so. This is provided by 
a riding instructor.

interactions within their theoretical orientation and chosen therapy 
approaches with the purpose of enhancing treatment outcomes for the 
client if specifically trained to do so (4).

2.4.3 Education/learning

Educational  or  learning-based  services  are  based  on  learning 
frameworks  and  focused  on  goals  related  to  areas  such  as  skill 
development, 
organizational 
development. Professionals working in these areas can include equine 
interactions to enhance the service they are providing (1).

achievement, 

academic 

and 

2.4.4 Equine movement in physical therapy, 
occupational therapy, and speech-language 
pathology

Occupational therapists, physical therapists, and speech-language 
pathologists use purposeful manipulation of equine movement as a 
therapy  tool,  also  known  as  hippotherapy,  to  engage  sensory, 
neuromotor and cognitive systems to promote functional outcomes 
within the patient’s plan of care (2).

2.4.5 Survey/overview course

This category comprised of survey, overview, and introductory 

courses that included an overview of several focus areas.

2.5 Comparison with previous scoping 
review

We compared the results of our scoping review with the results of 

the 2018 study (5) to track changes over time.

3 Results

3.1 Courses and institutions

A total 122 courses were offered at 48 higher education institutions 

across the United States.

3.2 Geographic location

Higher education institutions in a total of 29 states (57.9%) offered 
coursework while 21 states did not have any academic institutions 
offering relevant coursework (Figure 1). The state with the largest 
number of courses offered was North Carolina (N = 14) and the state 
with the largest number of higher education institutions offerings 
coursework  was  Pennsylvania  (N  = 5).  Except  for  the  Pacific 
Northwest, all major geographic areas of the contiguous United States 
had higher education institutions offering relevant coursework. No 
coursework was identified in Hawaii or Alaska.

2.4.2 Mental health

3.3 Course content focus area

Mental health professionals, such as clinical psychologists, mental 
health clinical counselors, clinical social workers, marriage and family 
therapists,  psychiatrists,  and  psychiatric  nurse  practitioners  who 
provide  psychotherapy  or  clinical  counseling,  may  include  equine 

Categorizing the 122 courses according to content focus resulted 
in the following: adaptive/therapeutic riding (N = 82, 67.2%), mental

primarily human-focused departments.

3.4 Level of learning

A total of 114 courses (93.4%) at 43 institutions were offered at the 
undergraduate level and a total of 8 courses (6.6%) at 5 institutions 
were  offered  at  the  graduate  level.  If  a  course  was  open  to  both 
undergraduates and graduate students, it was counted only once and 
categorized as an undergraduate course.

3.5 Department

A total of 48 departments or academic areas provided relevant 
coursework at 48 higher education institutions. Of the 48 departments 
offering coursework, 26 (54.2%) were focused on animals, such as 

3.6 Comparison to previous scoping review

When comparing results from the present study for academic year 
2021–2022  with  results  from  the  academic  year  2016–2017  (5), 
we found that the number of total courses offered has increased by 12, 
from  110  to  122  courses  total.  The  number  of  higher  education 
institutions  offering  courses  has  increased  by  9,  from  39  to  48 
institutions.  Geographically,  the  same  number  of  states  have 
institutions  offering  relevant  coursework  (N  = 29).  There  was  an 
increase in undergraduate courses, from 93 in 2016–2017 to 114 in 
2021–2022, totaling 21 courses. Meanwhile, there was a decrease in 
graduate courses, from 17 in 2016–2017 to 8 in 2021–2022, totaling 9 
courses. The number of departments offering relevant coursework has 
increased by 11, from 39 to 48. The percentage of coursework offered 
either  through  primarily  animal-focused  or  human-focused

departments has changed slightly. In the academic year of 2016–2017, 
coursework was offered by 19 departments (48.7%) that were focused 
on animals, such as equine science, animal science, and agriculture, 
and by 20 (51.3%) departments focused on humans, such as health 
science, social science, or liberal arts. In the academic year of 2021–
2022, coursework was offered by 27 departments (54.0%) focused on 
animals,  and  by  23  (46.0%)  focused  on  humans  (see  Table  2). 
Regarding  course  focus  area,  there  was  an  increase  in  adaptive/
therapeutic  riding  courses  and  survey/overview  courses,  and  a 
decrease in mental health and education/learning courses. There was 
no change in courses offered on equine movement in physical therapy, 
occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology (see Table 1).

4 Discussion

We conducted a study focused on the prevalence of coursework 
in U.S. higher education in areas of horses in human services and 
adaptive/therapeutic riding for the academic year of 2021–2022. This 
study successfully replicated the first comprehensive scoping review 
in this area (5) and provides data for tracking coursework development 
over time. Our results show an increase in coursework offered by 
higher education institutions by comparing offerings in the academic 
year  of  2016–2017  with  2021–2022.  By  recording  the  number  of 
courses and institutions, the geographic location of the institution, the 
focus of course content, the level of study (undergraduate or graduate), 
and the academic department or academic area through which the 
course was offered, we discovered several notable developments.

An additional 9 academic institutions started offering coursework 
in the five-year time period covered by the data comparison, bringing 
the total number of institutions from 39 in 2016–2017 to 48 in 2021–
2022. In addition, 12 additional courses were offered in 2021–2022, 
primarily  at  the  undergraduate  level. The  number  of  departments 
offering coursework increased from 39 to 48. Institutions offering 
relevant coursework are located in over half of U.S. states and location 
by state remained more or less the same in the comparison period. 
When considering course focus, the largest increases were found in 
the number of adaptive/therapeutic riding courses and in the survey/
overview courses offered. One exception to the overall increase in 
coursework was in the focus areas of horses in mental health and 
horses in education where a decrease in offerings was found. One 
institution  that  in  2016–2017  had  offered  10  courses  total  at  the 
graduate level, five courses in mental health and five in education/
learning, had stopped doing so by 2021–2022, which likely has a large 
impact in those areas. This may have also impacted the overall number 

of courses offered at the graduate level, which had declined by 2021–
2023.  The  percentage  of  courses  offered  primarily  through 
departments  focused  on  animals,  such  as  equine  science,  animal 
science, and agriculture, in contrast with those focused on human 
health  science,  social  science,  or  liberal  arts  had  also  changed 
somewhat  between  the  two  comparison  points.  In  the  2016–2017 
academic  year,  48.7%  of  coursework  was  offered  by  departments 
focused on animals, and 51.3% by departments focused on humans. 
In  the  2021–2023  academic  year,  56.6%  of  coursework  offered  by 
departments focused on animals and 43.4% by departments focused 
on humans.

While coursework in the relevant areas has increased, the issues 
noted in the previous scoping review have remained, namely those 
surrounding  terminology  and  conceptualization  of  services  and 
activities that involve horses. These challenges have been discussed 
extensively in recent years (1, 4). Issues concerning the terms used to 
describe services and how to understand interactions with horses in 
human services and adaptive/therapeutic riding impacted the current 
study  in  several  ways.  Identifying  and  categorizing  coursework  is 
dependent on shared understanding of what is described. The most 
challenging aspect of conducting this scoping review was to discern 
what  a  course  was  about  based  on  the  available  course  title  and 
description. Often, the course title included the word “therapy,” but 
the course description focused solely on adaptive/therapeutic riding, 
referencing riding lessons, instructions, adapted equipment, and such. 
Categorizing  such  a  course  offering  in  one  of  the  two  healthcare 
service  areas,  mental  health  or  equine  movement  in  occupational 
therapy, physical therapy, or speech language pathology, would have 
been incorrect, although these are the only areas that involve therapy. 
As such, conducting any kind of review in the area of horses in human 
services  and  in  adaptive/therapeutic  riding  requires  considerable 
knowledge  about  the  nature  of  services  and  activities,  not  just 
commonly used terminology, as this may be used inappropriately. 
Using combinations of words that involve “therapy” or “intervention” 
while  meaning  adaptive/therapeutic  riding  emerged  as  the  largest 
issue  concerning  terminology  for  higher  education  institutions  to 
address, as the majority of course offerings are focused on adaptive 
riding lessons for individuals with disabilities.

Appropriate conceptualization of horses in human therapy and 
learning  services  and  the  separate  activity  of  adaptive/therapeutic 
riding is also necessary in order to not mislead students about course 
offerings. For instance, a total of 13 courses with a specific focus on 
therapy services were offered at the undergraduate level in 2021–2023. 
When courses that focus on therapy services where equine interactions 
are included are offered at the undergraduate level, it should be clear to

students that they cannot provide psychotherapy, occupational therapy, 
physical therapy, or speech language therapy independently without a 
master’s degree in the U.S. and that this does not change when equine 
interactions  are  included  as  part  of  the  service.  The  choice  of 
department  by  which  a  course  about  horses  in  human  services  is 
offered  is  another  interesting  aspect.  Unlike  education/learning 
services, where no specific level of academic training is required for 
professionals in most cases, human services, such as psychotherapy, 
require  advanced  academic  degrees  and  licensure  in  order  for  the 
professional to provide the service. As such, courses offered by animal-
focused departments may be limited in how they are able to prepare 
students for professional work in human services. In light of these 
limitations, it makes sense that adaptive/therapeutic riding, the largest 
area  of  coursework  by  far,  is  offered  at  an  undergraduate  level  by 
primarily animal-focused departments. Interestingly, in a recent survey 
of adaptive/therapeutic riding center staff involved in hiring decisions, 
less than half (42%) indicated that having a bachelor’s degree was a 
major consideration in hiring for a management position, and only 
22% indicated that they “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that having a 
bachelor’s degree with major/minor in adaptive/therapeutic riding or 
with a focus on horses in human services was important (10).

Another conceptual challenge arises when institutions offer minors 
within bachelor’s degrees with titles that reference horses in human 
health or adaptive/therapeutic riding, but do not offer any courses 
specific to the topic area. Instead, students may complete credits in 
areas  such  as  human  development,  anatomy,  equine  science,  and 
equine business. Institutions with minors or tracks built this way were 
not included in this study as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. It 
is arguably misleading for students to pursue a minor where they do 
not get direct instruction in the topic area they are interested in.

The delineation of and descriptions used for the four main course 
focus areas in this study follow currently proposed terminology and 
conceptual guidelines (1, 2, 4). As the most current national guidelines 
were published immediately preceding the 2021–2022 academic year, 
it  is  not  expected  that  coursework  included  in  this  review  would 
be informed by them. Perhaps due to the lack of opportunities for 
professional exchange between instructors who offer academic courses 
in these unique areas, there appears to be large differences in course 
content, which only further contributes to issues with terminology 
and conceptualization. Based on course descriptions reviewed in this 
study, no agreement seems to exist regarding what constitutes basic or 
introductory knowledge in these distinct course topic areas, and, as a 
result, what should be included in survey courses or taught at different 
academic levels.

Course offerings are not static, and the data provided in this article is 
specific to what took place during the 2021–2022 academic year. The 
possible  impact  of  COVID  on  the  development  of  new  course 
offerings  and  delivery  of  existing  courses  in  this  area  should  also 
be taken into consideration when reviewing the data.

Our suggestions for future research echo those proposed in the 
2018 review (5) and feel particularly critical in light of the increase in 
course offerings. Examination of curricula and their connection to 
competencies and standards of professional practice in the various 
areas of coursework is of central importance. Surveying instructors 
and course creators could result in telling information about how 
course  content  varies  across  institutions.  Finally,  an  increase  in 
support and information exchange between instructors and academic 
units across institutions may serve to strengthen the development and 
quality of course offerings in this area.

Publisher’s note

As no database exists outside of course catalogs for individual 
institutions,  it  is  possible  that  courses  meeting  criteria  have  been 
omitted due to not having been found during internet searches. In 
addition, the inclusion criteria leave out student-designed electives 
and other academic activities taking place outside of standard courses.
