ABSTRACT
Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been shown to negatively aﬀect
health in adulthood. Estimates of associations between ACEs and chronic painful conditions
are lacking.
Objectives: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate associations between
exposure to ACEs and chronic pain and pain-related disability in adults.
Methods: We searched 10 electronic databases from inception to February 2023. We included
observational studies assessing associations between direct ACEs (childhood sexual, physical,
emotional abuse, or neglect) alone or in combination with indirect ACEs (witnessing domestic
violence, household mental illness), and adult chronic pain (≥3 months duration) and pain-
related disability (daily activities limited by chronic pain). Pairs of reviewers independently
extracted data and assessed study risks of bias. Random-eﬀect models were used to
calculate pooled adjusted odds ratios [aOR]. Tau square [T2], 95% prediction intervals [95%
PI] and I2 expressed the amount of heterogeneity, and meta-regressions and subgroup
meta-analyses investigated sources of heterogeneity (PROSPERO: CRD42020150230).
Results: We identiﬁed 85 studies including 826,452 adults of which 57 studies were included in
meta-analyses. Study quality was generally good or fair (n = 70). The odds of reporting chronic
pain in adulthood were signiﬁcantly higher among individuals exposed to a direct ACE (aOR,
1.45, 95%CI, 1.38–1.53).
Individuals reporting childhood physical abuse were signiﬁcantly
more likely to report both chronic pain (aOR, 1.50, 95CI, 1.39–1.64) and pain-related
disability (1.46, 95CI, 1.03–2.08) during adulthood. Exposure to any ACEs alone or combined
with indirect ACEs signiﬁcantly increase the odds of adult chronic painful conditions (aOR,
1.53, 95%CI, 1.42–1.65) and pain-related disability (aOR, 1.29; 95%CI, 1.01–1.66). The risk of
chronic pain in adulthood signiﬁcantly increased from one ACE (aOR, 1.29, 95%CI, 1.22–1.37)
to four or more ACEs (1.95, 95%CI, 1.73–2.19).
Conclusions: Single and cumulative ACEs are signiﬁcantly associated with reporting of chronic
pain and pain-related disability as an adult.

Métodos: Buscamos en 10 bases de datos electrónicas desde su inicio hasta febrero de 2023.
Incluimos estudios observacionales que evaluaron las asociaciones entre ACEs directas (abuso
sexual, físico, y emocional en la infancia, o negligencia) solas o en combinación con ACEs
indirectas (presenciar violencia doméstica, enfermedad mental en el hogar), y dolor crónico
en adultos (≥3 meses de duración) y discapacidad relacionada con el dolor (actividades
diarias limitadas por el dolor crónico). Pares de revisores extrajeron los datos de forma
independiente y evaluaron los riesgos de sesgo de los estudios. Se utilizaron modelos de
efectos aleatorios para calcular las medidas agrupadas de probabilidades ajustadas [aOR].
Tau cuadrado [T2], intervalos de predicción del 95% [PI 95%] e I2 expresaron la cantidad de
heterogeneidad, y las meta regresiones y los metaanálisis de subgrupos investigaron las
fuentes de heterogeneidad (PROSPERO: CRD42020150230).
Resultados: Identiﬁcamos 85 estudios que incluyeron 826.452 adultos, de los cuales 57
estudios se incluyeron en los metaanálisis. La calidad de los estudios fue en general buena o
regular (n = 70). Las probabilidades de reportar dolor crónico en la edad adulta fueron
signiﬁcativamente mayores entre las personas expuestas a una ACE directa (ORa, 1,45; IC del
95%, 1,38–1,53). Las personas que reportaron abuso físico en la infancia tenían
signiﬁcativamente más probabilidades de reportar tanto dolor crónico (ORa, 1,50,
IC 95,
1,39–1,64) como discapacidad relacionada con el dolor (1,46, IC 95, 1,03–2,08) durante la
edad adulta. La exposición a cualquier ACE sola o combinada con ACEs indirectas aumenta
signiﬁcativamente las probabilidades de sufrir afecciones dolorosas crónicas en adultos
(ORa, 1,54; IC del 95%, 1,44–1,65) y la discapacidad relacionada con el dolor (ORa, 1,29; IC
del 95%, 1,01–1,66). El riesgo de dolor crónico en la edad adulta aumentó signiﬁcativamente
desde un ACE (aOR, 1.29, 95%CI, 1.22–1.37) a cuatro o más ACEs (1.95, 95%CI, 1.73–2.19).
Conclusiones: Las ACE únicas y acumulativas se asocian signiﬁcativamente con el reporte de
dolor crónico y discapacidad relacionada con el dolor en la edad adulta.

1. Introduction

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are harms
directly occurring to a child or teenager such as phys-
ical, sexual, or emotional abuse, or neglect by a parent
or caregiver, or can be indirect through household dys-
function or living environments such as parental death,
divorce, substance abuse, or severe sickness of a parent
or sibling (Control, 2019). Over 1 billion children – half
of all children in the world – are exposed to ACEs each
year (Hillis et al., 2016), and in 2019, the estimated past-
year prevalence of ACEs were 44% in high-income
countries (Hillis et al., 2016), and 59% in low- and
middle-income countries (Hillis et al., 2016). 19% of
European adults report having experienced two or
more ACEs and 16% of US adults report having experi-
enced four or more types of ACEs (Control, 2019).

Prior reviews have highlighted the negative impact
of ACEs on physical,(Hughes et al., 2017) psychologi-
cal (Moore et al., 2015), and behavioural health (Kal-
makis & Chandler, 2015), and even early mortality
(Grummitt et al., 2021).

ACEs are estimated to result in 37.5 million disabil-
ity-adjusted life years globally and carry an estimated
ﬁnancial cost of $1.3 trillion per annum across
North America and Europe, with over 75% of these
costs arising in individuals reporting two or more
ACEs (Bellis et al., 2019).

Chronic pain is deﬁned as an unpleasant sensory
and emotional experience associated with, or resem-
bling that associated with, actual or potential tissue
damage (Nicholas et al., 2019). Highly prevalent
chronic pain conditions including musculoskeletal
disorders (MSDs) and non-musculoskeletal disorders

(non-MSDs) such as headache and migraine, are lead-
ing causes of years lived with disability (James et al.,
2018). In the US alone, medical costs and lost pro-
ductivity of chronic pain including joint pain and
arthritis amount to between US$560 and US$635 bil-
lion per year, exceeding the costs of diagnoses such
as heart or lung disease, injuries, diabetes, or cancer
(Gaskin & Richard, 2012).

Prior reviews examining the link between ACEs and
chronic pain and pain-related disability have included
studies with insuﬃcient attention to the design of con-
trol groups and to sample size (Davis et al., 2005; Häu-
ser et al., 2011; Irish et al., 2010; Paras et al., 2009;
Romans & Cohen, 2008), and have generated mixed
results, particularly in terms of which ACEs (e.g. phys-
ical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect) are associated with
speciﬁc chronic pain condition later in life (Arnow,
2004; Bombay et al., 2009; Bussières et al., 2020; Davis
et al., 2005; Norman et al., 2012; Paras et al., 2009;
Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2009; Tidmarsh et al., 2022; Weg-
man & Stetler, 2009). Previous meta-analyses reporting
an increase odds of long-term musculoskeletal (MSK)
and general pain symptoms from childhood sexual
abuse failed to clearly deﬁne symptom duration and
type of painful conditions (Irish et al., 2010) or to report
the eﬀect of ACEs on somatic pain and headache separ-
ately (Petruccelli et al., 2019).

Other reviews suggested an increased risks of poor
health outcomes with multiple ACE exposures (≥ 2 vs
no ACE (Bellis et al., 2019) and ≥ 4 vs no ACE
(Hughes et al., 2017)), but whether a dose–response
relationship exists between the number of ACEs and
persistent pain or pain-related disability remains

unclear. Therefore a comprehensive synthesis
needed (Bussières et al., 2020).

is

We aimed to determine the extent of the relation-
ship between exposure to ACEs and adult chronic
pain and its related disability. We also explored
whether unique and cumulative ACEs exposure
(type and number) increase the risk of developing
chronic pain and related disability (i.e. daily activities
limited by chronic pain) in adulthood.

2. Methods

This review is reported according to the MOOSE
Guidelines for Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews
of Observational Studies and the PRISMA-P (Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Ana-
lyses Protocols) guidelines (Shamseer et al., 2015;
Stroup et al., 2000). Our published protocol (Bussières
et al., 2020) mirrored recent recommendations on
methods for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
observational studies (Dekkers et al., 2019; Mueller
et al., 2018), and was prospectively registered in PROS-
PERO (CRD42020150230).

2.1. Search strategy

The MEDLINE (Ovid) strategy was developed by a
health science librarian (JB), peer-reviewed by a
second librarian using the PRESS standard (Bethell
et al., 2017; McGowan et al., 2016), and adapted in
nine other databases using search ﬁlter to identify
observational studies (SIGN, 2019), reporting associ-
ations and risks of chronic pain from single or mul-
tiple ACEs. For complete search history see: https://
doi.org/10.5683/SP3/BMAR8N. Bibliographies of rel-
evant articles were searched for other relevant articles.
Authors were contacted and asked to provide any
non-signiﬁcant or unpublished ﬁndings regarding
ACEs and physical health. No additional studies
were obtained by this method.

2.2. Selection criteria

The search was performed on 29 August 2019, with no
language restrictions, and last updated on 22 February
2023 (Figure 1). Results were imported into Rayyan
Intelligent systematic review system (Ouzzani et al.,
2016). Two authors double screened 25% of the refer-
ences to establish coder reliability, and then pairs of
reviewers
and
abstracts, and proceeded similarly for full text screen-
ing of potentially eligible articles. Any discrepancies
were discussed and resolved through consensus. For
inclusion, studies had to meet the following criteria:

direct types (childhood sexual, physical, emotional
abuse or neglect) (WHO, 2006), alone or in combi-
nation, with indirect types (household dysfunction
including witnessing domestic violence, frequent
fear of family member, parental divorce, caregiver
death,
incarcerated household member, serious
childhood illness/injury, economic hardship, par-
illness,
ental unemployment, household mental
bullying, witnessing a violent crime)
(Bethell
et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2017) and compared
them with individuals who had not suﬀered any
ACEs. Reports comparing a single ACE to cumu-
lative ACEs were also eligible;

(2) report deﬁnitions and measurements for chronic
pain in accordance with the IASP deﬁnition and
indicators of disability such as activity limitation
due to chronic pain using discrete and/or con-
tinuous outcomes (Nicholas et al., 2019);
(3) test the associations between (1) and (2);
(4) be a cross-sectional, case control, nested case–con-
trol, or cohort study measuring chronic pain or
chronic pain-disability in adulthood, with a sample
size of at least 100 in each group or 200 for con-
tinuous outcomes as per recent recommendations
when conducting systematic reviews of observa-
tional studies (Dekkers et al., 2019; Hughes et al.,
2017). Single case studies and randomized con-
trolled trials were not included.

We excluded studies based on high-risk populations
(eg, people who are homeless, incarcerated or have a
primary diagnosis of substance abuse) because few indi-
viduals have low ACE exposure in such populations. In
addition, these individuals are at higher risk of adult
victimization, self-harm, and overall poor physical
and mental health; these factors possibly confound
the association between ACEs and chronic pain and
disability, thereby producing non-generalizable results
(Hughes et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2021; Sheahan & War-
drop, 2023). We also excluded studies including people
born severely prematurely, which is known to modify
the pain pathway leading to altered pain in adulthood
(Williams & Lascelles, 2020); investigating the assess-
ment, treatment or mechanisms of chronic pain; and
of adults with clear medical explanations for their
pain, such as fractures, sprains, burns, visceral disease,
neuropathic injury, or cancer. When ﬁndings from iter-
ations of the same survey were reported, we included
data only from the most recent. For studies with insuﬃ-
cient data to evaluate eligibility, we contacted the study
authors twice for clariﬁcation before excluding.

2.4. Study quality

Included articles were independently assessed for
methodological quality by pairs of assessors using a
modiﬁed form adapted from the Scottish Intercollegi-
ate Guidelines Network (SIGN) checklist for cohort
and case–control studies (Baker et al., 2010), and the
Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool for cross sectional
studies (Moola et al., 2017). Individual criteria were
rated as recommended by these tools (e.g. ‘yes’, ‘no’,
‘can’t determine’,
‘not reported’)
‘not applicable’,
based on the information reported in the study. The

overall quality of individual studies was also rated as
‘high’, ‘fair’, or ‘poor’ (eTables 1–3 in the Supplement).
Any discrepancies were resolved through consensus.

2.5. Data synthesis

We performed a qualitative synthesis of ﬁndings and
stratiﬁed results based on the type of chronic pain dis-
orders (MSDs or non-MSDs) and direct ACEs alone
or combined with indirect ACE exposures. Data
were then summarized and tabulated according to
the variables listed above and reported narratively.

Meta-analysis was done separately for outcomes of
chronic pain and pain-related disability and for indi-
viduals exposed to direct ACEs and to at least two
types of ACEs (vs no ACE) using Comprehensive
Meta-Analysis Version 3 Pro, Biostat Inc. P values
less than 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. We calcu-
lated pooled ORs with the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-
Jonkman method for random eﬀects meta-analysis,
which has been shown to outperform the standard

DerSimonian-Laird method we had originally planned
on using (Schmidt et al., 2009). As the majority of
studies reported sociodemographic adjustments and
adjusted ORs, we elected not to transform these into
RRs (Grant, 2014). Adjusted positive and negative
counts by condition and ACEs category were gener-
ated for use in the meta-analysis. Covariates from pro-
portional hazards models were treated as RRs. For
each study, all categories of ORs for more than one
ACEs were combined to give an OR for two or more
ACEs by use of a weighted mean method.

We used visual inspection of forest plots and the I²
statistic to assess heterogeneity among pooled studies
(Higgins et al., 2022). Prespeciﬁed subgroup analyses
were conducted to explore consistency across results
by various factors including study design, type of con-
dition, and if there was at least two studies available
(Häuser et al., 2011). To test the hypotheses of a sub-
group eﬀect, a test of interaction with a predetermined
2-tailed alpha level of 0.05 was used (Altman & Bland,
2003). We conducted sensitivity analyses by excluding
outlying studies (so that study 95% CIs did not overlap
those of pooled measures), and by exploring the
impact of the risk of diﬀerent biases on the results in
regression analyses. When possible, we explored
potential sources of heterogeneity, for outcomes with
at least ten samples and high heterogeneity between
estimates, by meta-regression. We did univariate ana-
lyses to test the individual association of the following
covariates (when relevant) with pooled estimates:
number of ACEs measured, study setting (general
population, community, clinical), country (North
America, Europe, Asia), and year of publication. We
explored risk of publication bias using visual inspec-
tion of funnel plots when at least ten samples were
included in the meta-analysis.(Higgins et al., 2022)
We generated forest plots showing ORs and 95% CIs
for each study and the overall random-eﬀects pooled
estimate. We also performed the Begg and Mazumdar
rank correlation test and Egger tests (Häuser et al.,
2011).

3.2. Meta-analysis

Compared to those who reported no ACE, the odds of
reporting chronic pain conditions later in life was sig-
niﬁcantly higher among individuals exposed to a
direct ACE (aOR, 1.45; 95%CI, 1.38–1.53; Tau square
(T2) = 0.031; prediction interval (95%PI) = 1.02–2.07;

I2 = 71.8%), including childhood neglect (aOR, 1.38;
95%CI 1.15–1.66; 7 studies), sexual abuse (aOR,
1.37; 95%CI, 1.25–1.49; 27 studies), and emotional
abuse (aOR, 1.56; 95%CI, 1.36–1.78; 12 studies). Indi-
viduals reporting childhood physical abuse were sig-
niﬁcantly more likely to report chronic pain (aOR,
1.50; 95%CI, 1.39–1.64; 27 studies) and pain-related
disability (aOR, 1.46; 95%CI, 1.03–2.08; 8 studies)
during adulthood (Table 2, Supplementary ﬁgures 1–

lower quality studies. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence in the odds of pain-related disability among indi-
viduals reporting sexual or emotional abuse or neglect,
compared to individuals without AECs.

Pooled estimates from seven case–control studies
(Bradford et al., 2012; Häuser et al., 2012; Ju et al.,
2020; Park et al., 2016; Rahal et al., 2020; Sumanen

neck pain, ﬁbromyalgia, headache and migraine, irrita-
ble bowel syndrome, and posterior pelvic pain (Figure
2). Exposure to any ACEs increased the odds of pain-
related disability (Dennis et al., 2019; Fowler et al.,
2020; Nicol et al., 2016; Park et al., 2014b; Santo et al.,
2022) (aOR, 1.29; 95%CI, 1.01–1.66) (Table 2, Sup-
plementary ﬁgure 5).

Pooled aORs for the association between any ACEs
and nine speciﬁc types of chronic primary pain con-
ditions ranged from aOR, 1.29 (95%CI, 1.22–1.37)
for spine pain and arthritis to aOR, 1.95 (95%CI,
1.73–2.19) for chronic pelvic pain syndrome (Table
2). Eﬀect size slightly increased after removing lower
quality studies (aOR, 1.6; 95%CI 1.44–1.76; Q=8.95,
df=2; p=.01).

The risk of any chronic pain in adulthood signiﬁ-
cantly increased from one AEC (Aﬁﬁ et al., 2016;
Anda et al., 2010; Bellis et al., 2018; Brennenstuhl &
Fuller-Thomson, 2015; England-Mason et al., 2018;

et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2021; Park et al., 2016; Tietjen
et al., 2015; 2017; Waehrer et al., 2020) (aOR, 1.29;
95% CI, 1.22–1.37) to four or more ACEs (Anda
et al., 2010; Bellis et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2018; Char-
tier et al., 2010; Hanlon et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021;

et al., 2019; Schlauch et al., 2022; Waehrer et al.,
2020) (aOR, 1.95; 95%CI, 1.73–2.10) regardless of the
pain condition (Figure 3), and for speciﬁc MSDs and
non-MSDs (Table 3). Lastly, pooled ORs from three
studies (Chartier et al., 2010; Fowler et al., 2020; Gilliam
et al., 2020) reporting on cumulative ACEs (n = 2–6
exposures)
in relation to disability suggested an
increased risk but it was not statistically signiﬁcant
(aOR, 1.77; 95%CI, 0.82–3.82).

3.3. Heterogeneity and publication bias

There was considerable heterogeneity between esti-
mates for all outcomes. In sensitivity analysis, exclud-

test and Egger’s regression intercept were also signiﬁ-
cant. However, no publication bias was found for
direct types of ACEs on chronic painful conditions
(Supplementary ﬁgures 6–8).

4. Discussion

We consistently found that ACE exposures are
associated with chronic pain conditions in adulthood
across types of ACEs, types of painful conditions,
geographical location, and over time. Pooled aORs
ranged from 1.31 for single exposure to 1.98 for mul-
tiple exposures. We also found a statistically signiﬁ-
relationship. Pooling ORs
cant
revealed signiﬁcant associations between individuals
reporting a single type of abuse or neglect and
adult chronic pain. Because these painful disorders
are very common, a modest increase in risk implies
a large number of additional cases and thus an
important impact on population health.

dose–response

Over 1 billion children – half of all children in
the world – are exposed to physical, sexual, or
emotional violence or neglect each year
(Hillis
et al., 2016). The endemic magnitude of ACEs,
their health consequences (Hughes et al., 2017),
and their combined attributable costs (estimates
between 2–6% of gross domestic product in Euro-
pean countries) (Hughes et al., 2021), compel urgent
action. For optimum impact, policies and pro-
grammes designed to prevent and detect ACEs, and
treat related consequences should be multisector,
spanning health, social services, education, and jus-
tice sectors (Control, 2019; WHO, 2014).

Our ﬁndings suggest ACE exposure is associated
with the most common and costly chronic pain con-
ditions,
including back and neck pain and other
MSDs, which account for the highest total health
care spending compared to other health conditions
(Dieleman et al., 2020). People with ACEs tend to
have a higher chronic disease burden, barriers to treat-
ment engagement, and greater health care utilization
in adulthood (Hargreaves et al., 2019). Adult patients
exposed to ACEs may not be achieving optimal health
outcomes due to the physiological and psychological
eﬀects of toxic stress (Tidmarsh et al., 2022; Werth-
man et al., 2022). While the relative contributions of
these mechanisms are not yet well understood, emer-
ging evidence links ACEs to changes in genetic
structural and functional
expressions
changes in the brain and clinical phenomena in adult-
hood (Lobo et al., 2022). ACEs may be associated with
heightened pain sensitivity later in life (Pierce et al.,
2023). Childhood neglect also predicts a ﬂattened cor-
tisol proﬁle in adults, which, in turn, predicts elevated
daily pain and emotional symptoms (Yeung et al.,
2015). Further, a wide range of psychological, social,
and contextual factors need to be considered in the

that aﬀect

development, maintenance, and treatment of chronic
pain conditions (Mao, 2017). Our ﬁndings support
the need to broaden healthcare provider understand-
ing of the associations between ACEs and chronic
pain, and adequately prepare them to provide
trauma-informed care (TIC) pain management (Ranj-
bar & Erb, 2019; Tidmarsh et al., 2022). In the clinical
identiﬁ-
setting, TIC encompasses the prevention,
cation, and assessment of trauma, response to trauma,
and recovery from trauma as a focus of all services
(Forkey et al., 2021). TIC emphasizes physical,
psychological, and emotional
safety and creates
opportunities for patients to rebuild a sense of control
and empowerment (Ranjbar & Erb, 2019). Speciﬁc
recommendations have been oﬀered for TIC practices
in rehabilitation settings (Baca & Salsbury, 2023; Ranj-
bar & Erb, 2019). Results from a recent observational
study suggest that adults with and without ACEs
endorsed signiﬁcant improvements in pain and func-
tioning following participation in an intensive inter-
disciplinary pain rehabilitation programme 2 to 3
times per week for 2 to 4 h each day over a period
of 10 weeks (Craner & Lake, 2021). Treatment
included individual pain psychology, physical and
occupational therapy, and medical visits with opioid
tapering with a focus on functional restoration focus,
rather than seeking to relieve pain, to help patients
increase engagement in physical reconditioning and
valued life activities. Current eﬀorts to improve the
management of chronic pain conditions might be
more successful if we broaden professional under-
standing of the links between ACEs and chronic
pain. Adding early childhood adversities as a risk fac-
tor for chronic pain and disability to pain manage-
ment
entry-level
education (Augeard et al., 2022) may increase educa-
tors and future clinicians awareness and promote
reﬂexivity.

competency proﬁle

to guide

We aimed to overcome limitations of prior reviews
(Davis et al., 2005; Häuser et al., 2011; Irish et al., 2010;
Norman et al., 2012; Petruccelli et al., 2019; Wegman
& Stetler, 2009) by having two expert librarians create
and independently review search strategies performed
in 10 databases, only including studies with samples of
over 100 subjects per arm, using strict deﬁnitions for
ACE exposure and chronic pain and disability, and
including only studies using validated instruments to
measure both exposure and outcomes. Pooling ORs
revealed signiﬁcant associations, not previously sum-
marized elsewhere, between individuals reporting a
single type of abuse (physical, sexual, emotional) or
neglect (emotional, physical) and adult chronic pain.
While our ﬁndings align with prior meta-analyses
examining the eﬀect of ACEs on chronic pain (Davis
et al., 2005; Irish et al., 2010), arthritis (Norman
et al., 2012), migraine and/or chronic headache (Nor-
man et al., 2012), and ﬁbromyalgia (Häuser et al.,

2011), we also found signiﬁcant associations between
any ACE and spine pain, musculoskeletal pain,
chronic headache, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome,
and posterior pelvic pain. Few meta-analyses have
explored the cumulative eﬀect of ACEs on chronic
pain. A recent meta-analysis (Petruccelli et al., 2019)
reported that the odds of combined somatic pain
and headache during adulthood gradually increased
with multiple ACEs. Our review supports a substantial
gradual increased risk from 1 ACE to ≥4 ACEs for any
adult chronic pain, and for painful MSDs and non-
small diﬀerences
MSDs pooled separately. The
observed between 2 to 3 ACEs and 3 to 4 or more
ACEs respectively may be due to the relatively small
number of included studies per level, the varying
type, severity, number, duration, timing, and method
of assessment of ACEs and chronic painful conditions.
Further, the response to an ACE may vary depending
on the individual’s underlying characteristics, resili-
ence, and vulnerability (Finlay et al., 2022).

Methodological challenges included the varying
terminology, operational deﬁnitions of ‘‘child abuse
and neglect’’, and tools used to measure ACEs across
studies. Further, diﬀerent subtypes of child maltreat-
ment are correlated with one another, which makes
it diﬃcult to extract the impact of a speciﬁc type of
maltreatment with an outcome variable. The accuracy
of self-reported ACEs is also uncertain. Nonetheless,
due to the hidden nature of ACEs, global data suggests
self-reported child sexual abuse is 30 times higher and
physical abuse is 75 times higher than oﬃcial reports
(Hillis et al., 2015). Thus, self-reports are considered
an essential measurement tool, and the fact that results
were consistent adds credibility. Other environmental/
indirect ACEs such as major natural disasters, school
shootings, and warzones are often not measured,
further exacerbating the issue of underreporting
(Abdelhamid et al., 2023; Holloway et al., 2023).
There is an urgent need to more comprehensively
identify individuals who have experienced ACEs as
well as the timing, duration, and subjective severity
of such experiences. The majority (84%) of included
studies used a cross-sectional design. While these are
useful designs to identify associations, they do not per-
mit distinction between cause and eﬀect, and are
prone to selection and recall bias (Mann, 2003). How-
ever, the ﬁndings from the case–control studies reveal-
ing signiﬁcant increased risks of adult chronic painful
conditions (Bradford et al., 2012; Ju et al., 2020; Park
et al., 2016; Rahal et al., 2020; Sumanen et al., 2007;
Tietjen et al., 2015), were consistent with four of the
ﬁve cohort studies with follow-up times ranging
from 4 to 30 years, included in this review (Chandan
et al., 2020; Kopec & Sayre, 2005; Raphael et al.,
2001; Raphael & Widom, 2011; Swanson et al.,
2013). We were unable to pool results from cohort
across
studies. Nonetheless,

populations, geography, and study design add credi-
bility to our conclusions. Still, confounding variables
are the major problem in analysing cohort studies
(Mann, 2003).

Substantial heterogeneity was present for most out-
comes, which could only partially be explained by sub-
group and sensitivity analyses. Further, the analyses of
subgroup diﬀerences were underpowered because of
the small number of studies included for each ACE
(Cuijpers et al., 2021). Only the association between
pain-related disability and any ACEs as well as phys-
ical abuse could be conﬁrmed by meta-analysis. Few
studies were eligible to explore the association
between emotional abuse or neglect and disability.
Emotional abuse and neglect are diﬃcult to operatio-
nalize, and these were deﬁned diﬀerently across the
studies. Therefore, the strength of this association
might be underestimated.

Future research should aim to prospectively assess
the association between ACEs and chronic pain and
disability employing analytic methods to enhance cau-
sal inference (e.g. Propensity scores, G-Methods, Cau-
sal mediation analysis, Fixed eﬀects
regression)
described elsewhere (Visontay et al., 2021). ACEs
may be more accurately understood in terms of
classes, rather than using summative scores, resulting
in more accurate predictive models (O’Donnell et al.,
2017) Latent class analyses can provide deeper under-
standing of how certain risk factors may diﬀerentially
be associated with ACE subgroups by maximizing the
homogeneity within groups, (i.e. individuals within a
class would respond similarly to certain maltreatment
items) and the heterogeneity between groups, (i.e.
individuals between classes will respond diﬀerently)
(Elklit & Murphy, 2022). In addition, to mitigate
their impact, future research is needed to understand
the biological mechanisms by which ACEs inﬂuence
health and disease throughout the lifespan.

In conclusion, single and cumulative ACEs appears
to signiﬁcantly increase the risk of reporting adult
chronic pain and related disability. There is a need
to reduce ACEs worldwide and address their associ-
ated societal burden.
