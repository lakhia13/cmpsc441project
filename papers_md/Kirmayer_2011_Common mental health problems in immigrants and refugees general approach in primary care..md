Abstract

Background: Recognizing and appropriately treating men-
tal health problems among new immigrants and refugees
in primary care poses a challenge because of differences in
language  and  culture  and  because  of  specific  stressors
associated with migration and resettlement. We aimed to
identify risk factors and strategies in the approach to men-
tal health assessment and to prevention and treatment of
common  mental  health  problems  for  immigrants  in  pri-
mary care.

Methods: We  searched  and  compiled  literature  on  preva-
lence and risk factors for common mental health problems
related  to  migration,  the  effect  of  cultural  influences  on
health and illness, and clinical strategies to improve men-
tal  health  care  for  immigrants  and  refugees.  Publications
were selected on the basis of relevance, use of recent data
and quality in consultation with experts in immigrant and
refugee mental health.

Results: The migration trajectory can be divided into three
components:  premigration,  migration  and  postmigration
resettlement.  Each  phase  is  associated  with  specific  risks
and exposures. The prevalence of specific types of mental
health problems is influenced by the nature of the migra-
tion experience, in terms of adversity experienced before,
during  and  after  resettlement.  Specific  challenges  in
migrant  mental  health  include  communication  difficulties
because of language and cultural differences; the effect of
cultural  shaping  of  symptoms  and  illness  behaviour  on
diagnosis,  coping  and  treatment;  differences  in  family
structure  and  process  affecting  adaptation,  acculturation
and  intergenerational  conflict;  and  aspects  of  acceptance
by the receiving society that affect employment, social sta-
tus and integration. These issues can be addressed through
specific inquiry, the use of trained interpreters and culture
brokers,  meetings  with  families,  and  consultation  with
community organizations.

Interpretation:  Systematic  inquiry  into  patients’  migration
trajectory and subsequent follow-up on culturally appropri-
ate  indicators  of  social,  vocational  and  family  functioning
over  time  will  allow  clinicians  to  recognize  problems  in
adaptation  and  undertake  mental  health  promotion,  dis-
ease prevention or treatment interventions in a timely way.

Key points

• Among immigrants, the prevalence of common mental
health problems is initially lower than in the general
population, but over time, it increases to become similar to
that in the general population.

• Refugees who have had severe exposure to violence often
have higher rates of trauma-related disorders, including
post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain or other
somatic syndromes.

• Assessment of risk for mental health problems includes
consideration of premigration exposures, stresses and
uncertainty during migration, and postmigration
resettlement experiences that influence adaptation and
health outcomes.

• Clinical assessment and treatment effectiveness can be

improved with the use of trained interpreters and culture
brokers when linguistic and cultural differences impede
communication and mutual understanding.

C hanging  patterns  of  migration  to  Canada  pose  new

challenges to the delivery of mental health services
in primary care. For the first 100 years of Canada’s
existence,  most  immigrants  came  from  Europe;  since  the
1960s, there has been a marked shift, with greater immigra-
tion from Asia, Africa, and Central and South America.1 The
mix  differs  across  the  provinces,  although  nearly  all  immi-
grants settle in Canada’s largest cities.2 The task of prevent-
ing, recognizing and appropriately treating common mental
health  problems  in  primary  care  is  complicated  for  immi-

ture, patterns of seeking help and ways of coping.3–6

economic stability are especially important in ensuring good
health outcomes.22,23 

In  consultation  with  experts  in  immigrant  and  refugee
mental health, we reviewed the literature to determine associ-
ated risks and clinical considerations for primary care practi-
tioners  in  the  approach  to  common  mental  health  problems
among  new  immigrant  or  refugee  patients.7–10 In  this  paper,
we  review  the  effect  of  migration  on  mental  health,  use  of
health  care  and  barriers  to  care.  We  outline  basic  clinical
strategies for primary mental health care of migrants includ-
ing the use of interpreters, family interaction and assessment,
and working with community resources.

Methods

We designed a search strategy in consultation with a librar-
ian  scientist  to  identify  systematic  reviews  and  guidelines
that  address  clinical  considerations  for  assessment,  treat-
ment  and  prevention  of  common  mental  disorders  among
immigrants  and  refugees  in  primary  care.  The  search  cov-
ered  MEDLINE,  HealthStar  (Ovid),  EMBASE,  PsycINFO,
CINAHL  and  the  Cochrane  Database  of  Systematic
Reviews from January 1998 to December 2009. This search
was  supplemented  by  articles  identified  through  evidence
reviews  conducted  for  other  topics  in  the  guidelines  of  the
Canadian  Collaboration  for  Immigrant  and  Refugee  Health
(CCIRH)  (e.g.,  depression,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,
intimate  partner  violence  and  child  maltreatment).  Articles
were  selected  on  the  basis  of  relevance  to  key  questions,
recent  publication  and  quality  of  evidence.  Details  of  the
search  and  selection  strategy  can  be  found  on  the  CCIRH
website  (www.ccirh.uottawa.ca).  We  provide  a  descriptive
synthesis and discussion of the results.

Results

The  search  identified  840  articles  addressing  detection,  pre-
vention and management of common mental health problems
among immigrants and refugees in primary care. There were
no  published  guidelines.  After  assessment  for  relevance  and
quality,  we  retained  113  articles,  including  10  systematic
reviews and 5 meta-analyses (Figure 1).

How does migration affect mental health?
Rates  of  mental  disorders  vary  in  different  migrant  groups,
but  these  differences  do  not  simply  reflect  the  rates  in  the
countries  of  origin.11 Instead,  prevalence  of  specific  types  of
problems and rates of health care use in particular groups can
be linked to migration trajectories in terms of adversity expe-
rienced  before,  during  and  after  resettlement  and  to  policies
and  practices  that  determine  who  gains  admittance  to
Canada.12 Table  1  lists  some  of  the  migration-related  factors
that  influence  mental  health  and  that  can  be  explored  in  a
clinical  assessment.12–23 The  effect  of  these  factors  varies
greatly with their severity and with their specific meaning for
patients,  their  families  and  their  communities,  as  well  as  for
the  wider  society.  Postmigration  factors  that  moderate  the
effects of premigration stress and that ensure employment and

In general, population studies find that the health of immi-
grants tends to be better than that of the general population in
both  the  sending  and  receiving  countries.24,25 Immigrants  to
Canada  often  show  slightly  lower  rates  of  mental  disorders
than  the  general  population.26,27 The  2000–2001  Canadian
Community  Health  Survey  found  that  newly  arrived  immi-
grants (length of residence less than one to four years) had the
lowest rates of depression (odds ratio [OR] 0.33, 95% confi-
dence  interval  [CI]  0.26–0.41)  and  alcohol  dependence  (OR
0.05,  95%  CI  0.02–0.12)  compared  with  the  Canadian-born
population.28 Rates in immigrants varied by region of origin,
with the highest rates found among immigrants from Europe
and the lowest among those from Africa and Asia. 

The  “healthy  immigrant  effect”  reflects  the  fact  that
immigrants must pass through a variety of filters to achieve
immigrant status. However, the health of immigrants tends to
worsen over time to match that of the general population.29,30
For example, a recent analysis of data from the United States
found that rates of depression and other disorders were lower
for new immigrants (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5–0.9) but rose over

time to local levels. Rates were similar to those in the general
population for immigrants who arrived before age 12 and for
the children of immigrants.31 In contrast, systematic reviews
and meta-analyses confirm that refugees are at substantially
higher risk than the general population for a variety of spe-
cific psychiatric disorders — related to their exposure to war,
violence,  torture,  forced  migration  and  exile  and  to  the
uncertainty  of  their  status  in  the  countries  where  they  seek
asylum  —  with  up  to  10  times  the  rate  of  post-traumatic
stress  disorder  as  well  as  elevated  rates  of  depression,
chronic pain and other somatic complaints.22,32–35 Exposure to
torture  is  the  strongest  predictor  of  symptoms  of  post-trau-
matic stress disorder among refugees.35

Strong evidence shows that some groups of migrants have
an elevated incidence of psychotic disorders after migration.36–39
A recent meta-analysis found a mean weighted relative risk of
schizophrenia  among  first-generation  migrants  of  2.7  (95%
CI 2.3–3.2); even higher rates were found in the second gen-
eration.40 Factors  related  to  increased  risk  included  coming
from  a  developing  country  and  an  area  where  most  of  the
population is black, suggesting that racism and discrimination
have a role in elevated incidence. A similar effect of migra-
tion  has  not  been  found  for  mood  disorders  in  the  United
Kingdom,41 but there is evidence for an increase in the preva-
lence  of  common  mental  disorders  among  men  (but  not
women)  from  the  Caribbean  after  migrating  to  the  US.42
These issues have not been studied in Canada, although expo-
sure  to  racism  and  discrimination  has  been  shown  to  have

negative  effects  on  the  mental  health  of  immigrants  and
refugees.43–45

Migration involves three major sets of transitions: changes
in personal ties and the reconstruction of social networks, the
move  from  one  socio-economic  system  to  another,  and  the
shift  from  one  cultural  system  to  another.46,47 The  migration
trajectory  can  be  divided  into  three  components:  premigra-
tion, migration and postmigration resettlement. Each phase is
associated  with  specific  risks  and  exposures.  The  premigra-
tion period often involves disruptions to usual social roles and
networks. During migration, immigrants can experience pro-
longed uncertainty about their citizenship status as well as sit-
uations that expose them to violence.19 Those seeking asylum
in  particular  sometimes  spend  extended  periods  in  refugee
camps  with  poor  resources  and  endemic  violence.  In  some
countries,  asylum  seekers  are  kept  in  detention  centres  with
harsh  conditions,  which  lead  to  a  sense  of  powerlessness.48
This  sense  can  provoke  or  aggravate  depression  and  other
mental health problems.18,49,50

Once  future  status  is  decided,  resettlement  usually  brings
hope and optimism, which can have an initially positive effect
on well-being. Disillusionment, demoralization and depression
can  occur  early  as  a  result  of  migration-associated  losses,  or
later, when initial hopes and expectations are not realized and
when immigrants and their families face enduring obstacles to
advancement in their new home because of structural barriers
and  inequalities  aggravated  by  exclusionary  policies,  racism
and  discrimination.45,51,52 For  example,  some  immigrants

encounter  difficulties  in  having  their  credentials  recognized,
which  compromises  their  ability  to  find  work  commensurate
with their education level.33 Events that evoke elements of past
trauma and loss can contribute to the re-emergence of anxiety,
depression  or  post-traumatic  stress  disorder.53 An  extensive
body of qualitative research of good quality and surveys with
clinical  and  community  samples  suggests  that  the  main
domains  of  resettlement  stress  include  social  and  economic
strain,  social  alienation,  discrimination  and  status  loss,  and
exposure to violence.17,18,54–56 Culture change itself poses distinct
challenges for individual identity and family life.47 Risk factors
for mental health problems can differ for men and women; for
example, language proficiency often has a greater influence on
men’s employment and subsequent mental health.57

In  general,  immigrants  and  refugees  are  less  likely  than
their Canadian-born counterparts to seek out or be referred to
mental health services, even when they experience compara-
ble  levels  of  distress.58–63 This  can  reflect  both  structural  and
cultural  barriers,  including  the  lack  of  mobility  or  ability  to
take  time  away  from  work,  lack  of  linguistically  accessible
services,  a  desire  to  deal  with  problems  on  one’s  own,  the
concern that problems will not be understood by practitioners
because  of  cultural  or  linguistic  differences,  and  fear  of
stigmatization.64–68 In  many  developing  countries,  mental
health services are associated only with custodial or hospital
treatment  of  the  most  severely  ill  and  psychotic  patients.
Partly as a consequence, and also because of specific cultural
explanations  of  illness,  mental  disorders  are  highly  stigma-
tized in most countries, and patients are extremely reluctant to
attribute symptoms to a mental disorder. The stigma of a psy-
chiatric diagnosis affects not only patients but also their sib-
lings and other family members.

Adolescents and children
Research on the mental health of adolescents who are immi-
grants or refugees shows wide variation in rates across stud-
ies.15,69 Although  some  studies  from  treatment  facilities  and
small  community  samples  find  that  migrant  youth  are  at
higher  risk  for  psychopathologic  disorders,  including  post-
traumatic stress disorder, depression, conduct disorder (juve-
nile  delinquency)  and  problems  resulting  from  substance
abuse,  results  from  a  few  large-scale  community  surveys
show  that  the  rate  of  psychiatric  disorder  among  immigrant
youth  is  not  higher  than  that  of  native-born  children.25,70 In
fact,  many  immigrant  youth  do  exceptionally  well  upon
arrival and some surpass their native-born peers in aspiration
and  academic  achievement.71 Other  studies  reveal  that  many
children coping with a history of exposure to war and politi-
cal violence manage to have relatively good mental health.72–74
Studies in many countries including Canada find high lev-
els  of  distress  and  depression  among  young  refugees.15,32,75–77
During  the  premigration  period,  most  refugee  children  and
their  families  face  social  upheaval  and  disruptions  to  their
social and educational development. During migration, many
youth are separated from their parents and no longer have the
emotional,  physical  and  financial  support  of  their  relatives.
Unaccompanied minors and children with unstable living sit-
uations  are  at  particularly  high  risk  for  mental  health  prob-

lems.78–81 In  the  postmigration  phase,  youth  often  face  accul-
turative stress and family poverty.82 Even after being reunited
with their families, children and adolescents must learn a new
language,  renegotiate  their  cultural  identity,  and  deal  with
social  isolation,  racism,  prejudice  and  discrimination.83 As
youth acculturate, many come into conflict with parents and
relatives  who  hold  ideals  and  values  different  from  those
being adopted by their children. Postmigration factors, includ-
ing the quality of reception and support in the country of asy-
lum, are important predictors of long-term outcome.33,84,85

Women
The  many  roles  and  responsibilities  of  immigrant  women  in
the home and the workplace can impede their access to men-
tal  health  services.86 Immigrant  women  are  at  two  to  three
times  the  risk  of  their  Canadian-born  counterparts  for  post -
partum  depression.87–89 Women  generally  do  not  proactively
seek  help  for  postpartum  depression.90 Barriers  to  seeking
help  that  could  be  more  common  or  have  a  greater  effect
among  migrant  women  include  a  lack  of  knowledge  about
postpartum  depression  and  treatment  options,  reluctance  to
disclose  emotional  problems  outside  the  family,  unwilling-
ness to undertake medical treatment for what is perceived as a
psycho social  problem,  concern  that  maternal  mental  illness
will  burden  or  stigmatize  the  family,  feelings  of  shame  at
being labelled mentally ill, and fear of losing one’s children
to authorities.90–92

Refugee women seen in specialized clinics have high rates
of exposure to violence and post-traumatic stress disorder that
often have not been addressed clinically.93 Experts emphasize,
however,  that  exploring  the  history  or  sequelae  of  rape  or
other forms of sexual violence requires great clinical sensitiv-
ity and should always be guided by patients’ needs and com-
fort levels.53,94

Seniors
Seniors  make  up  a  smaller  proportion  of  the  refugee  and
immigrant  population  in  the  initial  migration,  sometimes
arriving later to join the family. Risk factors for psychological
distress  among  newly  arrived  older  immigrants  include
female  sex,  less  education,  unemployment,  poor  self-rated
health,  chronic  diseases  (heart  disease,  diabetes,  asthma),
widowhood  or  divorce,  and  lack  of  social  support  or  living
alone.95–97 When seniors join an already settled family, issues
can include slower rates of learning the language and accul-
turation; separation from extended family, peers and familiar
surroundings; decreased social support and isolation because
extended family and community networks are lost; increased
dependency on others because of language and mobility diffi-
culties; fewer opportunities for meaningful work and produc-
tivity; and loss of status as a respected elder in the new cul-
tural context.98,99

Clinical considerations

Which clinical strategies are effective?

and treating common mental health problems in primary care

for the general population can be extended to migrants from
diverse  backgrounds.  However,  experts  in  migrant  mental
health agree that, for maximum effectiveness, attention must
be given to various contextual and practical issues that influ-
ence  illness  behaviour,  patient–physician  communication
and  intercultural  understanding.100 Specific  challenges  in
migrant mental health include communication, cultural shap-
ing of symptoms and illness behaviour, the effect of family
structure  and  process  on  acculturation  and  intergenerational
conflict, and the receiving society’s facilitation of or imped-
ance  of  adaptation  and  social  integration.25 There  is  limited
but consistent evidence from qualitative studies and clinical
experience in intercultural primary care that these challenges
can  be  addressed  through  specific  enquiry  into  social  and
cultural  context,  the  use  of  interpreters  and  culture  brokers,
meetings  with  families  and  consultation  with  community
organizations.101–104

How does culture affect health and illness?
Because migration often brings people together from very dif-
ferent  cultural  backgrounds,  it  is  important  to  give  explicit
attention  to  cultural  dimensions  of  the  illness  experience.105
Place  of  origin  can  affect  exposure  to  endemic  diseases,
childhood immunization and health care experiences. Culture
can profoundly influence every aspect of illness and adapta-
tion, including interpretations of and reactions to symptoms;
explanations  of  illness;  patterns  of  coping,  of  seeking  help
and  response;  adherence  to  treatment;  styles  of  emotional
expression  and  communication;  and  relationships  between
patients,  their  families  and  health  care  providers.106 The  out-
line for cultural formulation in the Diagnostic and statistical
manual of mental disorders, fourth edition,  provides a basic
set of considerations that can be incorporated into assessment
of patients to explore clinically relevant aspects of their iden-
tity,  illness  explanations,  psychosocial  environment  and
expectations for patient–physician relationships.107–110

Most patients in primary care with mental health problems
present  with  physical  complaints,  which  can  lead  to  under-
recognition  and  treatment  of  common  mental  disorders.111
Patients with depression or anxiety sometimes focus on physi-
cal symptoms or use culture-specific bodily idioms to express
distress.111,112 Medically  unexplained  symptoms,  particularly
pain, fatigue, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms,
are  common  in  the  community  and  in  primary  care.113 When
interviewed outside medical settings, more patients report psy-
chosocial  stressors,  which  they  sometimes  are  reluctant  to
reveal to physicians because they think such stressors are inap-
propriate topics for medical attention or they believe that their
situation will not be understood.64,114 There is limited but emerg-
ing  evidence  that  information  about  associated  psychological
distress  and  social  predicaments  can  be  elicited  by  enquiring
about the effect of the physical symptoms or other presenting
concerns on activities of daily living, stressors, social supports,
functioning in work and family, or community contexts.113,115–118
Use  of  multiple  sources  of  help  is  common  among
migrants,  who  may  consult  traditional  forms  of  healing  as
well as biomedical practitioners.119 In urban settings, patients
make  use  of  treatments  from  many  traditions  in  addition  to

Review

those related to their own cultural background or geographic
region  of  origin.120 If  medications  are  being  considered  or
pres cribed,  it  is  important  to  enquire  about  whether  the
patient  is  using  any  home  remedy  or  complementary  medi-
cine  that  might  interact  with  the  metabolism  and  effective-
ness of a prescribed drug.121 Broad questions about use of any
medication, food or substance taken for health or medicinal
purposes can be followed by specific questions about the use
of  commonly  available  substances,  such  as  St.  John’s  wort
(Hypericum  perforatum)  or  Ginkgo  biloba,  and  about
whether  patients  receive  medicines  from  family,  friends  or
country of origin. Finally, questions about previous or ongo-
ing  consultations  with  a  physician,  healer  or  helper  from
their own or other communities can uncover medication use
or other health concerns that can affect adherence, treatment
response and coping.6,122

Working with interpreters and culture brokers
Although most immigrants to Canada have some knowledge
of English or French, they might be limited in their ability to
express their concerns, describe symptoms and social predica-
ments, and negotiate treatment. Any patient who has limited
proficiency in the languages known by the clinician should be
encouraged to use a medical interpreter. Failure to use inter-
preters has been identified as one of the most important barri-
ers to accessing services for newcomers.123 Professional inter-
preters should be used to facilitate communication; telephone
interpreting  services  can  be  used  when  no  local  interpreter
can be found.124 Recent systematic reviews find that the use of
professional  interpreters,  rather  than  ad  hoc  translators  (e.g.,
family friends, children, staff), improves communication sub-
stantially  and  helps  reduce  disparities  in  use  of  a  range  of
medical  services.101,103 Professional  interpreters  can  improve
communication  and  increase  disclosure  of  psychological
symptoms  among  asylum  seekers,14,125–127 and  can  be  used  to
deliver  psychosocial  interventions.128 Working  effectively
with interpreters involves a collaborative process and specific
skills (Box 1).6

Except  in  urgent  situations  where  there  is  no  alternative,
family members or untrained lay people should not be used as
interpreters.129 Several studies have documented the limits of
nurses  acting  as  interpreters.  Because  they  are  closer  to  the
physician’s  position,  nurses  or  other  health  professionals
might  not  convey  some  of  the  doubts  and  concerns  or
requests made by the patient.130

Interpreters  or  other  mediators  can  also  take  the  role  of
culture broker and advocate, translating not language but cul-

concerns  about  confidentiality  vis-à-vis  other  members  of
their linguistic community, they could perceive the presence
of an interpreter or culture broker as threatening. Each situa-
tion requires a specific assessment of the patient’s needs and
requirements for communication in the language in which he
or she is most fluent and comfortable.

Box 1: Clinical approach to working with interpreters
and culture brokers

Before the interview

• Meet with the interpreter to explain the goals of the inter-

view.

• Discuss whether the interpreter’s social position in country

of origin and local community could influence the
relationship with the patient.

• Explain the need for especially close translation in the
mental status examination (e.g., to ascertain thought
disorder, emotional range and appropriateness, suicide
risk).

• Ask the interpreter to indicate when a question or

response is difficult to translate.

• Discuss any relevant etiquette and cultural expectations.

• Arrange seating in a triangle so that the clinician is facing

the patient and the interpreter is to one side.

During the interview

•

Introduce yourself and the interpreter and explain your
roles.

• Discuss confidentiality and ask for the patient’s consent to

have the interpreter present.

•

Look at and speak directly to the patient; use direct speech
(e.g., “you” instead of “she” or “he”).

• Avoid jargon or complex sentence constructions; use clear

statements in everyday language.

•

Slow down your pace; speak in short units to allow the
interpreter time to translate.

• Do not interrupt the interpreter; keep looking at the

patient while the interpreter is speaking.

• Clarify ambiguous responses (verbal or nonverbal) and ask

the patient for feedback to make certain that crucial
information has been communicated clearly.

• Give the patient a chance to ask questions or express

concerns that have not been addressed.

After the interview

• Discuss the interview and ask the interpreter to assess the

patient’s degree of openness or disclosure.

• Consider translation difficulties and misunderstandings
and clarify any important communication that was not
translated or was unclear, including nonverbal
communication.

• Ask the interpreter if he or she had any emotional
reactions or concerns of his or her own during the
interview.

• Plan future interviews; whenever possible, work with the
same interpreter or culture broker for the same patient.

culture brokers can be found at www.mmhrc.ca.

any  health  problem  and  accompany  patients  to  physicians’
visits.  Migration  can  stress  and  fragment  families;  close
members might be left behind, sometimes in dangerous cir-
cumstances. The tendency to focus on the patient in primary
care  must  be  supplemented  by  close  attention  to  the  family
system and social network, which can include crucial mem-
bers  in  other  countries.  It  is  important  to  acknowledge  and
welcome  family  members  who  accompany  the  patient.
Rather  than  excluding  them  because  of  privacy,  meeting
family  members  together  soon  before  meeting  alone  with  a

patient  can  be  an  important  step  to  building  trust  and  a
source of valuable information.

Rules  of  confidentiality  and  disclosure  should  be  applied
in a way that respects cultural context. For example, although
Canadian law protects confidentiality for youth older than 14
years and recognizes adult status at age 18, the cultural legiti-
macy  of  parental  authority  over  adolescents  should  be  taken
into account. For counselling and treating youth, interventions
should be framed in ways that avoid alienating family mem-
bers or aggravating intergenerational conflicts. Similarly, dis-
closure of diagnostic issues and family “secrets” (e.g., about
traumatic  events)  should  be  approached  carefully,  with  an
understanding of what is at stake for the family. Finally, when
ambivalence  toward  treatment  or  nonadherence  is  an  issue,
involvement  of  such  mediators  as  a  key  family  member  or
trusted  family  ally  in  discussions  of  the  different  treatment
alternatives can strengthen the therapeutic alliance, empower
the family and provide necessary support to the patient.124

Working with community organizations
Resettlement  after  migration  is  strongly  affected  by  the
policies,  practices  and  opportunities  of  the  resettlement
society as well as existing ethnocultural community organi-
zations and religious institutions, which support migrants in
work  and  in  legal,  religious  and  social  aspects  of  their
adaptation.9,23,132 The  presence  of  welcoming  links  within
ethnic  communities  or  religious  congregations  can  buffer
the effects of migration losses, isolation and discrimination.
Migrant youth living in communities with a high proportion
of  immigrants  from  the  same  background  are  better
adjusted,  partly  because  they  have  positive  role  models,  a
stronger sense of ethnic pride and social support, which can
help them deal with the stressors of poverty, discrimination
and  racism.71 Becoming  familiar  with  existing  community
and  religious  organizations  can  help  practitioners  identify
and  mobilize  psychosocial  support  and  other  resources
when needed.

In  urban  centres  with  large  immigrant  populations,  com-
munity  resources  can  be  divided  into  two  broad  categories:
multiethnic organizations that offer services related to settle-
ment  and  integration,  and  groups  specific  to  various  ethnic
backgrounds  that  provide  a  sense  of  belonging  and  support
for  a  particular  ethnocultural  identity.  Before  referring  a
patient, it is important to identify which community he or she
feels part of and not to assume that the patient necessarily will
feel comfortable with a group that shares aspects of national,
religious or ethnic identity.

It  is  useful  for  practitioners  to  have  a  list  of  community
resources  for  specific  needs  (e.g.,  housing,  food,  language
courses, social support) and of the ethnocultural groups these
resources  represent.  However,  a  personalized  referral  (e.g.,
giving  a  specific  name  or  calling  the  person  in  front  of  the
patient) is much more likely to result in success, particularly
in the case of a depressed, anxious and traumatized patient for
whom  re-establishment  of  a  social  network  is  difficult
because of fear and distrust. In smaller communities, develop-
ing networks across social sectors and ethnocultural groups as
well as with colleagues in other centres can be useful.133

Conclusion and research needs

Migration  poses  specific  stresses,  yet  most  immigrants  do
well  with  the  transitions  of  resettlement.  Systematic  enquiry
into the migration trajectory and subsequent follow-up on cul-
turally appropriate indicators of social, vocational and family
functioning  will  allow  clinicians  to  recognize  problems  in
adaptation  and  undertake  mental  health  promotion,  preven-
tion or treatment interventions in a timely fashion. 

Because  the  evidence  is  limited,  research  is  needed  to
develop  and  evaluate  primary  care  strategies  for  promoting
mental  health  and  preventing  mental  illness  that  respond  to
the  increasing  diversity  of  immigrants  and  refugees  in
Canada.
