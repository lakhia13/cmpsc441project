Combat-exposed Veterans are at increased risk for developing psychological distress, mood disorders, and trauma and stressor-
related disorders. Trauma and mood disorders have been linked to alterations in brain volume, function, and connectivity. However,
far less is known about the effects of combat exposure on brain health. The present study examined the relationship between
severity of combat exposure and cortical thickness. Post-9/11 Veterans (N = 337; 80% male) were assessed with structural
neuroimaging and clinically for combat exposure, depressive symptoms, prior head injury, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Vertex-wide cortical thickness was estimated using FreeSurfer autosegmentation. FreeSurfer’s Qdec was used to examine
relationship between combat exposure, PTSD, and prior head injuries on cortical thickness (Monte Carlo corrected for multiple
comparisons, vertex-wise cluster threshold of 1.3, p < 0.01). Covariates included age, sex, education, depressive symptoms,
nonmilitary trauma, alcohol use, and prior head injury. Higher combat exposure uniquely related to lower cortical thickness in the
left prefrontal lobe and increased cortical thickness in the left middle and inferior temporal lobe; whereas PTSD negatively related
to cortical thickness in the right fusiform. Head injuries related to increased cortical thickness in the bilateral medial prefrontal
cortex. Combat exposure uniquely contributes to lower cortical thickness in regions implicated in executive functioning, attention,
and memory after accounting for the effects of PTSD and prior head injury. Our results highlight the importance of examining
effects of stress and trauma exposure on neural health in addition to the circumscribed effects of speciﬁc syndromal pathology.

INTRODUCTION
Over 2.7 million US service members have deployed as part of
Operation Enduring (OEF), Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and New Dawn
(OND; [1]). Military personnel serving since the onset of OEF may
increasing exposure to
be subjected to multiple deployments,
combat trauma, and risk of combat-related disorders [2, 3]. Severe,
prolonged stress associated with combat deployments has been
consistently linked with increased prevalence of co-occurring
psychological disorders,
including PTSD, depression, alcohol
misuse, and anxiety [3–8], and decreased executive function and
sustained attention, and increased reaction time [9]. Psychological
disorders relate to combat exposure and neuropsychological
dysfunction [10–12], and may mediate the relationship between
combat exposure and neuropsychological abilities. However, the
results from one study suggest post-deployment neuropsycholo-
gical performance remained signiﬁcantly altered after controlling
for effects of PTSD and depressive symptoms, suggesting a unique
impact of combat exposure on brain function [9].

Mechanistic research linking chronic stress to changes in the brain
highlights a critical role for the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
(HPA) axis [13–16].
In animal and human studies, chronic stress
cytokines,
is

associated with dysregulated cortisol

levels,

glucocorticoid receptors, and corticotropin-releasing hormone
levels,
increased catecholamine levels, decreased acetylcholine,
and increased pro-inﬂammatory response [13–16]. This dysregula-
tion may weaken a cells’ resilience, lead to cellular atrophy, and/or
inhibited neurogenesis [13]. In Veterans, combat exposure and stress
relate to lower grey matter volume within the left ventromedial
prefrontal and bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [17], and
lower grey matter volume in the right posterior insula [18].

Cortical thickness, another index of neural health, is a proxy for
neuronal density and provides more speciﬁcity of brain-related
changes as compared with grey matter volume [19]. Decreased
cortical thickness is associated with decreased cognitive abilities in
adults [20–22]. Thus, cortical thickness is a prime biomarker for our
study to further interrogate established associations between
combat exposure and alterations in cognitive abilities [9]. A small
number of studies have examined differential effects of prolonged
stress on cortical thickness in combat Veterans [23–26]. One study
found Veterans with chronic pain exhibited an inverse relationship
between combat and cortical thickness in the left inferior frontal
gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and right superior parietal gyrus, and
those without chronic plain displayed a positive relationship [25].
Similarly, Veterans exposed to childhood trauma exhibit a positive

relationship between PTSD symptoms and cortical
thickness
within the paracentral and posterior cingulate, whereas Veterans
without childhood trauma demonstrate a negative relationship
[26]. This line of research suggests early life trauma and chronic
pain inﬂuence combat-related changes in cortical thickness.

Research examining the unique effects of combat exposure in
relation to cortical thickness indicates severity of combat exposure
relates to lower cortical thickness within the left lateral prefrontal
cortex, regardless of PTSD diagnosis [23, 24]. In addition, PTSD
may moderate the relationship between combat stress and
cortical thickness. Both studies investigating these intersecting
relationships suggest stronger negative relationships between
combat exposure and cortical thickness in Veterans without a
PTSD diagnosis than Veterans with PTSD [23, 24]. These results
suggest combat exposure may have a unique, negative impact on
cortical thickness. However, the role of highly comorbid condi-
tions, particularly head injury and depression, were not previously
ascertained. This study sought to examine the role of highly
comorbid conditions
in assessing the
associations between combat and cortical thickness. If replicated,
this line of research will underscore the importance of examining
neural health in combat-exposed Veterans regardless of PTSD
diagnosis.

in combat Veterans

Given the high prevalence rate of PTSD in OEF/OIF/OND
Veterans [27], it is unsurprising most research has focused on the
impact of PTSD on neural health as opposed to the effect of
combat exposure. PTSD diagnosis and severity relate to lower
insular
cortical thickness primarily within the postcentral gyri,
cortex, precuneus, fusiform, and entorhinal cortices, with more
widespread ﬁndings (i.e., more regions throughout the brain in
which PTSD related to lower cortical thickness) when examining
lifetime burden of PTSD symptoms (cumulative effect of PTSD
symptoms [28]). PTSD has also been linked with lower cortical
thickness within the prefrontal cortex when controlling for
depressive symptoms [23, 29]. PTSD-speciﬁc research provides
signiﬁcant insight into the effects of this particular diagnosis on
neural health. However, diagnosis-speciﬁc approaches limit a
critical understanding of how extended exposure to life-
threatening stressors,
i.e., combat exposure, may impact neural
health in all Veterans, not just those meeting diagnostic criteria
for PTSD.

Another complicating factor of combat on neural health is head
injury. Approximately 19% of military personnel sustain a head
injury during a deployment, a signiﬁcant risk factor for the
development of PTSD, with the vast majority of head injuries
being classiﬁed as mild traumatic brain injuries [30], and
accelerated brain aging [31]. In Veterans, history of a head injury
is associated with decreased cortical thickness within the right
inferior temporal, right insular, and right inferior frontal gyrus [32].
Similarly, Veterans with both PTSD and head injury exhibit lower
cortical thickness within the postcentral and middle temporal gyri
[28]. However, it remains unclear how combat may affect cortical
thickness beyond the effects of PTSD and previous head injuries.
This study examined the impact of combat on neural health as
measured by cortical thickness. In addition, we examined whether
the effects of combat are distinct from the inﬂuence of PTSD and
previous head injuries in a large sample of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans.
We adopted a data-driven approach to identify regions uniquely
associated with combat exposure, while controlling for common
combat-related conditions. Based on prior research examining the
relationship between combat and cortical thickness [23, 24], we
hypothesized severity of combat exposure would relate to lower
frontal cortex
cortical
independent of PTSD diagnosis.
In addition, we hypothesized
PTSD, above and beyond the effects of combat, would relate to
decreased cortical thickness throughout the prefrontal cortex, and
prior head injuries would relate to lower cortical thickness in the
lobes. To further explore intersecting relationships of
temporal

thickness in regions within the left

combat, PTSD and head injuries, we also explored interaction
effects of combat, PTSD, and head injuries on cortical thickness.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Subjects were recruited between 2005 and 2018 from a post-
deployment mental health repository of 3877 US military Veterans
[33]. Subjects included Veterans who served since 11 September
2001 between the ages of 18 and 59. Subjects underwent
screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria based on information
available in this repository and subsequent telephone contact. Full
inclusion and exclusion criteria are included in Supplementary
Material. Important exclusion criteria included penetrating head
loss of consciousness ≥30 min, history of neurological
injury,
disorders (e.g., seizure, stroke, multiple sclerosis, chronic ence-
phalitis, cerebrovascular disease, CNS neoplasm), severe chronic
failure, heart
medical conditions (e.g.,
failure, severe metabolic disturbance), neurosurgery, and Axis I
psychiatric disorders other
than PTSD and co-morbid Major
Depression. A total of 341 Veterans met inclusion criteria for the
present analysis. All subjects provided written informed consent.
Study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review
Boards at Duke University Medical Center and Durham VA Medical
Center.

Clinical assessment
information was available from the post-deployment
Clinical
mental health repository. Diagnostic assessment of mental health
was based in the DSM-IV-Text Revision [34], and assessed using
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis 1 Disorders (SCID;
[35]). SCIDs were administered by trained research personnel. The
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI–II; [36]), Combat Exposure Scale
[37]), and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test
(CES;
(AUDIT; [38]) were used to assess depression, severity of combat
exposure, and alcohol use, respectively. The Traumatic Life Events
Questionnaire (TLEQ) pre- and post-military index scores were
summed to estimate non-military trauma [39]. Veterans self-
reported history of head injuries by indicating (yes/no) if they had
been diagnosed with a head injury on the physical health subscale
of the National Vietnam Veterans’ Readjustment Study Medical
Questionnaire [40]. A supplemental analysis was conducted in a
subset of Veterans (n = 205) who completed a traumatic brain
injury interview ([33]; see Supplementary Material and Supple-
mentary Fig. S2).

Neuroimaging assessment
Scanning was conducted on a GE Discover MR750 3.0 Tesla MRI
scanner. A T1-weighted anatomical image was acquired using a
3D FSPGR sequence (TR/TE = 7.53/2.9 ms, ﬂip = 12°, FOV = 240
mm, 256 × 256 × 162 matrix, 1 mm slices). Images were prepro-
cessed using FreeSurfer version 5.3.0 image analysis suite (http://
surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/ [41]). Quality assurance was con-
ducted according to the ENIGMA Cortical Quality Control Guide
2.0 (available
at http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/imaging-
protocols/) by two trained raters. Four scans failed quality
assurance due to pathology, leaving a total of 337 scans available
for analysis. Cortical thickness estimates were extracted bilaterally
from individual anatomical
images using the ENIGMA cortical
thickness pipeline (available at http://enigma.usc.edu).

Statistical analyses
Relationships between combat, PTSD, and cortical thickness were
examined using FreeSurfer’s Qdec (Monte Carlo corrected for
multiple comparisons, vertex-wise cluster threshold of 1.3, p < 0.01
[42]). Qdec is a vertex-based (whole-brain) general linear model
approach developed to identify relationships between clusters of
vertex-wise cortical thickness and a predictor variable (i.e., severity

of combat exposure). This approach identiﬁes regions of the
cortex signiﬁcantly related to the predictor and maps these
clusters onto a predeﬁned naming scheme based on the Desikan-
Killiany atlas [41]. We examined main and interaction effects of
combat exposure, PTSD diagnosis, and head injuries adjusting for
age, sex, education, prior head injury, depression, alcohol use, and
nonmilitary trauma. Effect sizes were calculated for each effect.
Subject-level mean cortical thickness values were extracted from
each identiﬁed region of interest. Linear models were used to
assess multiple adjusted R2 values, and calculate Cohen’s f 2.
Education data were missing for one subject, and was imputed
using the average score (3.9, equivalent to a technical trade school
or an associate degree). Given the relationship between age and
decreased cortical thickness [43], interaction effects of age were
also examined (see Supplementary Material and Supplementary
Fig. S3). All analyses were conducted using R Statistical Software
Package (version 3.4.1; available at cran.org).

RESULTS
Demographic and clinical characteristics
Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1
In the present sample, 28.2% of
and Supplementary Table S1.
Veterans met criteria for PTSD, and 10.7% of the sample endorsed
experiencing at least one head injury. Severity of combat exposure
ranged from 0 (light) to 37 (heavy), with an average severity of light
to moderate (mean = 10.5, SD = 10.5). There was a large range of
depression symptoms from 0 (minimal) to 58 (severe), with average
in the minimal range (mean = 10.8, SD = 11.6). Average alcohol use
was below the threshold for harmful drinking (threshold ≥8; mean
= 3.8, SD = 4.5; range 0–26). The number of noncombat trauma
exposures ranged from 0 to 20 (mean 2.1, SD = 2.8).

Vertex-wise analysis of cortical thickness
Qdec results, including peak z-values, peak coordinates, anatomi-
cal
location, and effect sizes for each model, are presented in
Table 2. Higher combat exposure related to lower cortical
thickness in the left rostral middle frontal (peak z = −3.32) and
right lateral orbitofrontal (peak z = −3.35) cortices (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S1). When controlling for the effects of PTSD, Qdec
analysis revealed severity of combat exposure negatively relates to
cortical thickness in regions within the left hemisphere spanning
the medial prefrontal and superior frontal cortex (peak z = −3.94)
and positively relates to cortical thickness in the lateral inferior
and posterior cortex (peak z = 5.61; Fig. 1a). PTSD, when
controlling for combat exposure, signiﬁcantly related to lower

(peak z = −3.07), extending into the lateral occipital and inferior
temporal cortex (Fig. 1b). An interaction effect was identiﬁed for
combat exposure and PTSD on cortical thickness within the right
precuneus (peak z = 5.74) extending into the isthmus cingulate
(Fig. 2). Veterans with PTSD exhibited a steeper, positive
correlation between combat exposure and cortical
thickness
compared with Veterans without PTSD.

Veterans who endorsed a head injury exhibited increased
cortical thickness within the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex
(Fig. 3a). Veterans with a head injury exhibited increased cortical
thickness within the left rostral anterior cingulate cortex (peak z =
4.12) extending into the medial orbitofrontal, superior frontal, and
caudal anterior cingulate cortices, the left rostral middle frontal
cingulate (peak z = 3.36) extending into the lateral orbitofrontal
cortex, and the right rostral anterior cingulate (peak z = 2.87)
extending from the posterior cingulate to the medial orbitofrontal
cortex. Veterans with and without head injuries exhibited an
inverse relationship between combat exposure and cortical
thickness within the right superior frontal cortex (peak z = 4.36;
Fig. 3b). Veterans who endorsed a head injury exhibited increased
cortical thickness in this region compared with Veterans without
head injuries. When examining PTSD diagnosis, Veterans with a
head injury and PTSD diagnosis exhibited increased cortical
thickness within the bilateral superior
frontal cortex (right
hemisphere peak z = 3.90,
left hemisphere peak z = 4.69)
compared with those without a PTSD diagnosis (Fig. 3c).

DISCUSSION
This study examined the impact of combat exposure on vertex-
wise cortical thickness in a large sample of OEF/OIF/OND combat
Veterans. We speciﬁcally sought to clarify the unique contributions
of combat exposure on cortical thickness by controlling for the
inﬂuence of PTSD and sustained head injuries. Using a Qdec
analysis, we identiﬁed (1) severity of combat exposure negatively
related to cortical thickness in regions spanning the left superior
prefrontal cortex and positively related to cortical thickness in the
left
(2) PTSD diagnosis was
negatively related to cortical thickness within the right fusiform;
and (3) history of head injury related to increased cortical
thickness bilaterally within the medial prefrontal cortex. The
lateralization and directionality of results points to a differential
impact of combat, PTSD, and head injuries on neural health.

Prior research examining combat and PTSD conducted in small
samples of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with N = 69 [23] and N = 41
[24], provides evidence that combat exposure relates to altera-
tions in cortical thickness. Furthermore, while these previous
investigations included adjustments for prior head injuries, neither
explored the unique effects of head injuries on cortical thickness,
representing a critical gap in our current understanding of how
combat exposure may uniquely impact cortical thickness. This

combat exposure and lower cortical thickness beyond the effects
of PTSD and previously sustained head injuries.

Consistent with previous ﬁndings, present

results indicate
severity of combat exposure signiﬁcantly relates to lower cortical
thickness within the left medial prefrontal and superior frontal
cortex,
including rostral middle frontal, superior frontal, medial
orbitofrontal, and rostral anterior cingulate cortices when control-
ling for depressive symptom severity, history of head injury,
nonmilitary trauma, alcohol use, age, sex, and education (Fig. 1a).
The medial and superior aspects of the prefrontal cortex have
been consistently implicated in a range of cognitive functions,
including executive functioning, decision-making, reward proces-
sing, sustained attention, memory, and emotion processing and
regulation [45]. In fact, we have previously shown a relationship
between increased PTSD severity in Veterans and increased
functional activation during emotionally valenced stimuli (com-
pared with neutral stimuli) in the ventral frontolimbic regions, and
decreased activation during executive function tasks within the
middle frontal gyrus, dorsal anterior cingulate, and inferior parietal
lobule [46]. In addition, another study examining the relationship
between cortical
thickness and cognitive inhibition indicates
Veterans with PTSD-related disinhibition exhibited lower cortical
thickness within the left medial orbitofrontal, rostral anterior
cingulate, and frontal pole [47]. However, these previous studies
did not examine the inﬂuence combat exposure may have on
cortical thickness or brain function. Therefore, current ﬁndings
suggest alterations within the frontal
lobe may be a result of
combat exposure severity as opposed to being solely circum-
scribed to PTSD diagnosis.

We also identiﬁed a positive relationship between combat
exposure and cortical thickness in the left middle and inferior
temporal cortex (Fig. 1b), extending into the fusiform,
lateral
occipital, banks of the superior temporal sulcus, inferior parietal,
and supramarginal cortices. Acute onset of PTSD has been
signiﬁcantly associated with reduced cortical thickness in bilateral
frontal and inferior parietal regions, and right lateral occipital lobe
[48]. The lateral occipital cortex is thought to play a role in the
integration of multisensory information and object recognition
[49, 50]. While functional implications of reduced cortical thickness

in relation to PTSD diagnosis are speculative given our current
focus on structural alterations, our ﬁndings are consistent with the
dysfunction in visual and multisensory processing and recognition
reported in combat-exposed Veterans. In fact, previous research in
Veterans, suggests PTSD is linked with reduced functional
activation of the lateral occipital lobe during repeated exposure
to emotionally valenced stimuli, suggesting this region may
underlie difﬁculties with habituation in Veterans with PTSD [51].
Notably, previous research did not control for trauma exposure.
Thus, our results indicate combat exposure may have a unique
impact on cortical thickness within the lateral middle and inferior
temporal regions.

To determine if the observed pattern of cortical thickness was
unique to combat severity, we also explored the relationship
between PTSD and cortical thickness, controlling for combat
exposure. Our results were partially consistent with previous
ﬁndings in Veterans which identify a unique impact of combat and
PTSD on cortical thickness. However, prior ﬁndings identiﬁed more
widespread effects of PTSD on cortical thickness, particularly lower
cortical thickness throughout the frontal cortex [23]. In compar-
ison, our results suggest PTSD may have a unique impact on
cortical thickness within the right fusiform (Fig. 1c), which parallels
ﬁndings associated with PTSD and grey matter volume in this
region [52]. More speciﬁcally, Veterans with a diagnosis of PTSD
exhibited lower cortical thickness within the right fusiform cortex

recognition. We have previously found Veterans with PTSD,
compared to trauma-exposed controls, exhibit increased activa-
tion of this region when viewing emotional, trauma-related cues
[53]. Thus, present results provide additional evidence linking
PTSD with alterations in the fusiform region.

In line with previous research conducted in smaller samples
[23, 24], we found an interaction effect of PTSD on the relationship
between combat exposure and cortical thickness. Veterans with
PTSD exhibited a steeper positive relationship between combat
exposure and cortical thickness compared with Veterans without

risk factor for the development of PTSD. However, longitudinal
research is needed to further understand the temporal relation-
ships between combat exposure, development of PTSD, and
cortical thickness.

We also examined the impact of head injuries on cortical
thickness controlling for both combat exposure and PTSD. In the
context of Veteran populations, one study examining the effects
of mild head injuries on cortical thickness in a small sample of
Veterans found mild head injuries were associated with decreased
cortical thickness within the right inferior temporal, insular, and
inferior frontal gyrus [32]. Similarly, Veterans with both a history of
PTSD and a head injury exhibit lower cortical thickness within the
postcentral and middle temporal gyri [28]. In contrast to previous
ﬁndings, prior diagnosis of a head injury in this study signiﬁcantly
related to increased cortical thickness within bilateral rostral
anterior cingulate and left rostral middle frontal cortices (Fig. 3a).
As noted above, regions in the medial frontal cortex are involved
in higher order
including executive functioning,
decision-making, and emotional processing [45]. A similar pattern
of cortical thickness emerged when examining the interaction of
the combat exposure severity (Fig. 3b) and PTSD (Fig. 3c) with
head injuries on cortical thickness in the superior frontal cortex, in
which Veterans with head injuries plus higher levels of combat or
PTSD exhibited increased cortical thickness in this region.
It is
plausible increased cortical thickness may be associated with
changes in functional and structural connectivity in Veterans who
have sustained a head injury when controlling for the effects of
PTSD and combat. Previous research in patients with and without

PTSD is associated with hyperactivation of this region during
symptom provocation [55]. Unexpectedly, Veterans with PTSD
exhibited lower cortical thickness at lower levels of combat
exposure compared with those without PTSD, and those with
PTSD exhibited a positive relationship between combat severity
and cortical thickness in these regions. Therefore, it is possible
lower cortical thickness prior to combat exposure may represent a

Fig. 3 Main and interaction effects of prior head injuries and cortical thickness. a When controlling for combat exposure, and PTSD, prior head
injuries relate to increased cortical thickness in the bilateral rostral anterior cingulate cortex (left hemisphere peak z = 4.12, peak x, y, z
coordinates = −10.7, 33.2, 18.2, model R2 = 0.20, head injury β = 0.05; right hemisphere peak z = 2.87, peak x, y, z coordinates = 8.6, 32.0, −8.6,
model R2 = 0.08, head injury β = 0.04), and the left rostral middle frontal cortex (peak z = 3.36, peak x, y, z coordinates = −22.6, 50.8, 0.4,
model R2 = 0.12, head injury β = 0.07) when compared with those did not sustain a prior head injury. b Veterans with and without a head
injury exhibited a negative relationship between combat exposure and cortical thickness within the right superior frontal cortex; however,
those with a head injury exhibited increased cortical thickness in this region compared with those without a head injury (peak z = 4.36, peak x,
y, z coordinates = 10.3, 60.4, 2.5; model R2 = 0.11; interaction β = 0.001). c Veterans with a head injury and PTSD diagnosis exhibited increased
cortical thickness compared with those with a head injury and no PTSD in the left (peak z = 3.90, peak x, y, z coordinates = 10.3, 60.4, 2.5;
model R2 = 0.21; interaction β = 0.03) and right (peak z = 4.69, peak x, y, z coordinates = 8.5, 62.5, −0.5; model R2 = 0.10; interaction β = 0.02)
superior frontal cortex

the prefrontal cortex, may represent a compensatory mechanism
in patients with head injuries [56, 57]. Furthermore, head injuries
the functional and structural connectivity
may also impact
between networks leading to widespread network dysregulation
[56–58]. However, the functional implications of increased cortical
thickness are purely speculative, given our focus on structural
assessment of neural health. Future research employing more
thorough assessments of head injuries, and functional neuroima-
ging will help clarify if increased cortical thickness is in fact
associated with compensatory processing in Veterans who have
sustained head injuries.

Limitations
While present results suggest combat has a differential impact on
neural health compared with the effects of PTSD, the study was
not without limitations. First, head injuries were examined using a
dichotomous self-report measure limiting our ability to examine
the inﬂuence of number or severity of head injuries on cortical
thickness, and limiting our ability to examine the impact of blast
exposure with and without concussive symptoms. The number
that endorsed head injuries in the present sample (10%) is lower
than prevalence rates of 20% in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans [30]. This
discrepancy may be due to our assessment of diagnosed head
injuries. Future research should include thorough assessment of
head injuries and blast exposure. In addition, as with most studies
examining combat-related PTSD,
there were high levels of
collinearity between combat severity, PTSD, depression, and TBI
in the present sample (correlations ranging from 0.29 to 0.42, all

p’s < 0.01). This may inﬂuence our ability to determine the unique
effects of combat, PTSD, and head injuries on cortical thickness.
Assessment of depression, combat, alcohol use, head injury, and
trauma exposure were based on self-report measures, which are
subject to bias. The SCID was used to assess PTSD. While the SCID
is a validated assessment of PTSD diagnosis, the gold-standard
assessment
is the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS;
[59–61]), which was only available in 79% of the sample. Last,
many individuals with PTSD are prescribed psychotropic medica-
tion, which may impact neural health [62]. Medication information
was not assessed in the full sample warranting future research to
examining potential effects of psychotropic medication on cortical
thickness.

CONCLUSION
We examined the impact of combat exposure on neural health by
assessing the contributions of various sources of heterogeneity in
a large sample of combat Veterans (N = 337). The results show
combat exposure severity, controlling for PTSD, signiﬁcantly
relates to lower cortical thickness within the left prefrontal lobe,
including the rostral middle frontal, superior
frontal, medial
orbitofrontal, and rostral anterior cingulate cortices, and increased
cortical thickness within the left middle and inferior temporal
cortex. PTSD relates to lower cortical thickness within the right
fusiform extending into the lateral occipital and inferior temporal
cortex. Veterans who sustained a head injury exhibit increased
cortical thickness bilaterally in the medial prefrontal cortex. This

may indicate combat exposure severity, PTSD, and prior head
injuries have differential impacts on cortical thickness in Veteran
research designs and
populations. Utilization of
implementation of multimodal neuroimaging approaches (i.e.,
functional and structural assessments) are warranted and will
clarify the functional implications of the present ﬁndings.
