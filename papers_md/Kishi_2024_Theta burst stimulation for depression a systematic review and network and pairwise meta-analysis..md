In clinical practice, theta burst stimulation (TBS) presents as a more efﬁcient and potentially more effective therapeutic modality
than conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), as it allows for the delivery of more stimuli in less time and at
similar intensities. To date, accelerated treatment plans according to various continuous (cTBS) and intermittent TBS (iTBS) protocols
for depression have been proposed. To investigate which of the TBS protocols provided a favorable risk-beneﬁt balance for
individuals with depression, this systematic review and random-effects model network meta-analysis was conducted. The study
outcomes included response rate (primary), depression symptom improvement, remission rate, all-cause discontinuation rate,
incidence of switch to mania, and incidence of headache/discomfort at treatment site. In this meta-analysis, a total of 23
randomized controlled trials (n = 960, mean age = 41.88 years, with 60.78% females) were included. Approximately 69.57% of the
trials included individuals with an exclusive diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The following six TBS protocols (target) were
evaluated: cTBS (right-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [R-DLPFC]), cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (left-DLPFC [L-DLPFC]), iTBS (L-DLPFC), iTBS
(L-DLPFC) + iTBS (R-DLPFC), iTBS (left-dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) + iTBS (right-dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), and iTBS
(occipital lobe). Compared to sham, cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC), iTBS (L-DLPFC), and iTBS (occipital lobe) had a higher
response rate (k = 23); cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC) and iTBS (L-DLPFC) dominated in the depression symptom improvement
(k = 23); and iTBS (L-DLPFC) had a higher remission rate (k = 15). No signiﬁcant differences were found for all-cause discontinuation
rate (k = 17), incidence of switch to mania (k = 7), and incidence of headache/discomfort at treatment site (k = 10) between any
TBS protocols and sham. Thus, cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC) and iTBS (L-DLPFC) demonstrate favorable risk-beneﬁt balance for
the treatment of depression.

INTRODUCTION
is recom-
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
mended as treatment
individuals with pharmacological
for
treatment-resistant depression (TRD) according to evidence
[1–3]. The most common method of rTMS therapy includes
placing a treatment coil on the patient’s scalp over the frontal lobe
that generates electromagnetic pulses, which induce electric ﬁelds
modulating the targeted left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-
DLPFC) and functionally connected networks [4–6]. The conven-
tional treatment plans involve high-frequency ( ~ 10 Hz) rTMS (HF-
rTMS)
targeting L-DLPFC (HF-rTMS [L-DLPFC]). However, as
treatment sessions last approximately 40 min and the initial
course of treatment typically consists of ﬁve treatments per week
over a 6-week period, the daily application over the course of
multiple weeks and the delayed time-to-response limit
its
practicality for both patient and treatment clinics [7, 8]. In 2018,
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved intermittent

theta burst stimulation (iTBS) using 600 pulses targeting L-DLPFC
(iTBS [L-DLPFC]) as a treatment for depression based on the
evidence of noninferiority over conventional HF-rTMS (L-DLPFC) in
a large multi-center trial
[8]. While conventional HF-rTMS (L-
DLPFC) treatment takes approximately 40 min per session, the
similar effective dose of TMS with iTBS (L-DLPFC) can be delivered
in just 3 min.

In a previous pairwise meta-analysis [9], we showed that iTBS (L-
DLPFC) and HF-rTMS (L-DLPFC) demonstrate no signiﬁcant
differences in efﬁcacy, acceptability, and safety proﬁles. Thus,
iTBS (L-DLPFC) could be offered as a more practical and potentially
more efﬁcient therapeutic modality clinically. However, the FDA-
approved single daily iTBS (L-DLPFC) course still
requires a
considerable 6-week treatment duration of ﬁve daily treatments.
Accelerated iTBS protocols have been proposed to address this
issue, delivering multiple iTBS sessions per day to deliver a
number of pulses within shorter timeframes. These accelerated

protocols not only have the potential to treat more patients within
the same time period but also to reduce patient visit frequency to
rTMS clinics, thereby enhancing overall accessibility and treatment
adherence [10].
To date,

treatment
the most accelerated iTBS (L-DLPFC)
protocol has been the Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT)
[11]. This protocol comprises 10 sessions of iTBS (L-DLPFC) that are
delivered daily, for a total of 18,000 pulses per day (i.e., total
number of pulses of conventional iTBS 6-week protocol) on ﬁve
consecutive days [11]. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of SNT
demonstrated that iTBS (L-DLPFC) outperformed sham in depres-
sive symptom improvement with a large effect size (Cohen’s
d > 0.8) [11].

To date, in addition to iTBS (L-DLPFC), numerous other theta
burst stimulation (TBS) protocols such as continuous TBS (cTBS)
over the right DLPFC (R-DLPFC)
(cTBS [R-DLPFC]) have been
proposed (Table S1). Thus, this systematic review and random-
effects model network meta-analysis was conducted to investi-
gate, which TBS protocols produced favorable risk-beneﬁt balance
for individuals with depression.
In the current meta-regression
analyses, since potential modiﬁers associated with TBS efﬁcacy in
individuals with depression remain unknown, we attempted to
identify variables in participants, treatment, and/or study design
that inﬂuence the effect size for response rate (the primary
outcome of the current study). Our meta-regression further aimed
at identifying TBS response modiﬁers and the interplay between
these modiﬁers and the sham response in the formation of
effect sizes.

METHODS
This study was conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (Table S2)
[12, 13] and was registered on the Open Science Framework (https://
osf.io/m6tf3). The literature search, data transfer accuracy, and
calculations were evaluated by at least two authors.

Search strategy and inclusion criteria
In Fig. S1, detailed information regarding the search strategy is
demonstrated. The inclusion criteria for the studies were as
follows: (1) published and unpublished RCTs that had at least two
TBS treatment sessions, (2) RCTs including individuals with both or
either major depressive disorder (MDD) and/or bipolar depression
(BDep), (3) RCTs including individuals with TRD and/or individuals
with no TRD. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) RCTs that
included individuals with a dual diagnosis of depression and
substance-use disorders and (2) RCTs that included individuals
with other psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia other than
MDD and BDep. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and
Embase databases for studies published prior to August 4, 2023.

Outcome measures, data synthesis, and data extraction
The current study outcomes included the response rate (primary),
depression symptom improvement,
remission rate, all-cause
discontinuation rate, incidence of switch to mania, and incidence
of headache/discomfort at treatment site. In Table S3, the data
synthesis for efﬁcacy outcomes is demonstrated. We conducted a
meta-analysis for the outcomes, which included at least ﬁve RCTs.
The extracted data were analyzed according to the intention-to-
treat or modiﬁed intention-to-treat principles. We searched for the
data in published systematic review articles if required data were
missing in the studies. We also attempted to contact the original
investigators to obtain unpublished data.

Meta-analysis methods
Both pairwise and frequentist network meta-analyses were
performed using the random-effects model [14, 15]. The risk ratio
the standardized mean
(RR)

for dichotomous variables or

difference (SMD) for continuous variables was calculated, with
95% conﬁdence intervals (95% CI). Network heterogeneity was
assessed using τ2 statistics. For pairwise meta-analyses, I2 statistics
was utilized to evaluate heterogeneity. Statistical evaluation of
incoherence was performed using the design-by-treatment test
(globally) [16] and the Separating Indirect from Direct Evidence
(SIDE) test (locally) [17]. The surface under the curve cumulative
ranking probabilities were used to rank the treatments for each
outcome. To validate the analysis, we determined whether the
distribution differences were sufﬁcient by comparing the distribu-
tion of the possible effect modiﬁers across treatments included in
the network meta-analysis using the Kruskal–Wallis test (contin-
uous variables) and the Pearson chi-squared test or the Fisher
exact test (categorical variables) and by evaluating their actual
impact on the treatment effect via meta-regression analyses
[18–20]. The potential confounding factors were as follows: mean
age, female proportion, total number of participants, minimum
depressive symptoms at baseline, diagnostic classiﬁcation, pub-
lication year, overall risk of bias, coil localization/targeting method,
and total number of sessions during the study (Table S4). We
evaluated overall risk of bias for every RCT using version 2 of the
Cochrane risk of bias
(https://
for
www.riskofbias.info/). Finally, the results were incorporated into
the Conﬁdence in Network Meta-Analysis application, an adapta-
tion of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Develop-
ment, and Evaluation approach, to evaluate the credibility of the
ﬁndings of each of the network meta-analyses [21–23].

For TBS protocols that only outperformed from a sham with
respect to primary outcome in our network meta-analysis (i.e.,
cTBS [R-DLPFC] + iTBS [L-DLPFC] and iTBS [L-DLPFC]), a single-
group summary meta-analysis was conducted to identify the exact
response rates with 95% CIs in both the TBS and sham groups. We
conducted meta-regression analyses to examine whether the
differences in the characteristics of the participants, treatment,
and/or study design inﬂuenced the effect size of the protocols for
the primary outcome. The following moderators were involved: 1.

3. factors related to the study design: (16) publication year and
(17) overall risk of bias (Appendix S1). Furthermore, the following
two sensitivity pairwise meta-analyses were performed:
(1) a
sensitivity pairwise meta-analysis excluding an RCT [24] including
only individuals with mixed episode from the primary pairwise
meta-analysis of cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC) and (2) another
sensitivity pairwise meta-analysis excluding an SNT study [11]
from the primary pairwise meta-analysis of iTBS (L-DLPFC). Some
differences were observed in the study characteristics between
SNT study and others. For example, an interim analysis was used
for the SNT study. While this could incite several biases [25], this
interim analysis was preplanned by the authors to be conducted if
the study showed a large effect size of active compared with sham
treatment (Cohen’s d > 0.8). The superiority of the protocol could
be explained by several
factors: First, the SNT study utilized
individualized targets derived from repeated runs of high-
resolution functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging.
Second, stimulation intensity was adjusted for differences in the
target-depth. Third, the hourly administration of the protocol with
50-min intersession interval
leads to a cumulative effect, and
ﬁnally, SNT had a higher total number of pulses than other studies.
The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software Version 3 (Biostat Inc.,
Englewood, NJ, USA) was used to conduct a pairwise meta-
analysis and meta-regression.

RESULTS
Study characteristics
A ﬂowchart of the literature search and a detailed explanation of
the process are presented in Fig. S1. A total of 546 articles were
initially identiﬁed; of these, 146 were duplicates, after title and
abstract screening, 366 articles were excluded, and a further 11
were excluded after full-text review. No additional study was found
from previous review articles. Finally, a total of 23 RCTs (n = 960,
mean age = 41.88 years, with 60.78% females) were included in the
meta-analysis [11, 24, 26–46]. Approximately 69.57% trials only
included individuals with MDD. We evaluated six TBS protocols
(target): cTBS (R-DLPFC), cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC), iTBS (L-
iTBS (left-dorsomedial
DLPFC),
prefrontal cortex) + iTBS (right-dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), and
iTBS (occipital lobe). The study characteristics are summarized in
Table S1. None of
the studies were provided with industry
sponsorship. In most of the studies, the overall risk of bias was
evaluated as “some concerns” (Table S5). Across different compar-
isons, there was no evidence of transitivity assumption violations
when comparing the study characteristics (Table S4).

iTBS (L-DLPFC) + iTBS (R-DLPFC),

Network meta-analysis results
cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC),
iTBS (L-DLPFC), and iTBS
(occipital lobe) had a higher response rate compared to the sham
(k = 23, Fig. 1, Appendix S1). The RRs (95% CIs) for cTBS (R-
DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC), iTBS (L-DLPFC), and iTBS (occipital lobe)
were 1.897 (1.110, 3.244), 2.003 (1.283, 3.126), and 10.666 (1.154,
98.603), respectively. No global consistency was found for the
primary outcome, although global heterogeneity was moderate to
high. In the meta-analysis results, a signiﬁcant local inconsistency
was found for only iTBS (L-DLPFC) vs. sham regarding the
response rate between network meta-analysis (RR [95% CI] =
2.003 [1.283, 3.126]) and pairwise meta-analysis (RR [95% CI] =
2.290 [1.437, 3.649]). No comparisons were included in at least
10 studies other than iTBS (L-DLPFC); however, the funnel plots of
the response rates demonstrated symmetry (Appendix S1). No
potential confounding factors were associated with the effect size
the primary outcome on the meta-regression analyses
of
(Appendix S1).

Both, cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC) and iTBS (L-DLPFC)
demonstrated superiority over sham in depression symptom
improvement (k = 23, Fig. 1, Appendix S2). The SMDs (95% CIs)
for cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC) and iTBS (L-DLPFC) were
−0.947 ( − 1.502, −0.392) and −0.625 ( − 1.052, −0.198), respec-
tively. Moreover,
remission rate
iTBS (L-DLPFC) had a higher
compared the sham (RRs [95% CIs]) = 2.162 (1.012, 4.618), k = 15,
Fig. 1, (Appendix S3). No signiﬁcant differences were found for the
all-cause discontinuation rate (k = 17, Fig. 1, Appendix S4),
inci-
dence of switch to mania (k = 7, Appendix S5), and incidence of
treatment site (k = 10, Appendix S6)
headache/discomfort at
between TBS protocols included in each outcome and sham.
Global heterogeneity was high in terms of depression symptom
improvement and remission rate and low for all-cause discontinua-
tion rate, incidence of switch to mania, and incidence of headache/
discomfort at treatment site (Appendices S2–S6). Considerable local
heterogeneity was noted for the depression symptom improve-
ment and remission rate in a few speciﬁc comparisons (Appen-
dix S2 and S3). Although we failed to evaluate global inconsistency
for remission rate and switch to mania owing to the insufﬁcient
number of treatment loops, no signiﬁcant global inconsistency for
other outcomes was observed (Appendices S2–S6). Although we
did not conduct the SIDE test for the remission rate and incidence
of switch to mania due to the insufﬁciency of the number of
treatment loops, we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant local inconsistency for
all comparisons in the depression symptom improvement, all-cause
discontinuation rate, and incidence of headache/discomfort at
treatment site (Appendices S2–S6).

In the majority of the comparisons, the within-study bias was
assessed as “some concerns.” Moreover, because funnel plots with
<10 studies were not meaningful [25], all comparisons other than
iTBS (L-DLPFC) vs. sham for publication bias were evaluated as
“some concerns.” Moreover, if the comparison only had an indirect
evidence,
the comparison was downgraded to one level.
Consequently, conﬁdence in the evidence was generally assessed
as low or very low.

Pairwise and single-group summary meta-analysis results
While iTBS (L-DLPFC) was superior to sham regarding the response
rate (RR [95% CI] = 2.290 [1.437, 3.649]), no signiﬁcant difference
was found for the outcome between cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-
DLPFC) and sham (RR [95% CI]) = 1.745 [0.926, 3.286],
(Appendix S1). The exact response rate (95% CI)
in cTBS (R-
DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC) and sham was 43.42% (28.04, 60.18) and
25.80% (17.26, 36.68), respectively. The exact response rates (95%
CI) for iTBS (L-DLPFC) and sham were 44.95% (31.82, 58.83) and
17.85% (10.58, 28.51), respectively.

The meta-regression analysis for cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-
DLPFC) demonstrated that studies including individuals with TRD
were associated with a larger effect size for the response rate than
studies on individuals with no TRD (Appendix S1). Although in the
sham group, the factor was not associated with the exact response
rate, studies including individuals with TRD were associated with a
more optimal response rate in the cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-
DLPFC) group than studies including individuals with no TRD
(Appendix S1). The meta-regression analysis for cTBS (R-DLPFC) +
iTBS (L-DLPFC) revealed that studies with fewer pulses during a
trial were associated with larger effect size for the response rate
than studies with more pulses during a trial
(Appendix S1).
Although the number of pulses during a trial were not correlated
with an exact response rate in the cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-
DLPFC) group, studies with fewer pulses during a trial were
associated with a lower exact response rate in the sham group
compared with studies with more pulses during a trial
(Appendix S1).

The meta-regression analysis for iTBS (L-DLPFC) showed that
studies with more pulses during a session were associated with
larger effect size for the response rate compared to studies with
fewer pulses during a session (Appendix S1). Although the
number of pulses during a session was not associated with exact
response rate in the iTBS (L-DLPFC) group, studies with more
pulses during a session were associated with a lower exact
response rate in the sham group compared to studies with fewer
pulses during a session (Appendix S1). Similar
results were
demonstrated in a subgroup including studies with 1000 and
more pulses during a session, but not in another subgroup
including studies with <1000 pulses (Appendix S1).

The sensitivity analysis for cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC)
excluding one RCT including individuals with mixed episode
showed that cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC) had a higher
response rate compared to the sham (RR [95% CI] = 2.435
I2 = 0.00%). The sensitivity analysis for iTBS (L-
[1.537, 3.859],
DLPFC) excluding the SNT study also revealed that iTBS (L-DLPFC)
had a higher response rate compared to the sham (RR [95% CI] =
2.111 [1.316, 3.386], I2 = 46.76%).

DISCUSSION
This is the ﬁrst systematic review and network meta-analysis
comparing efﬁcacy, acceptability, and safety of various TBS
treatment protocols for individuals with depression. Our results
suggest that iTBS (L-DLPFC) had a favorable risk-beneﬁt balance
for the treatment of depression because iTBS (L-DLPFC) had a high
efﬁcacy and better acceptability and safety proﬁles for individuals
with depression. In Fig. 2, efﬁcacy and acceptability are illustrated

treatment site was not reported. Although TBS protocols were
considered as well-tolerated, because rTMS is known to rarely
induce convulsions [48], clinicians must monitor individuals with
depression.

Our

study had some limitations. First,

Our network meta-analysis demonstrated that iTBS (occipital
lobe) had a higher response rate compared the sham. However,
no signiﬁcant differences in the improvement of depression
symptoms and remission rate between iTBS (occipital lobe) and
sham were observed. Importantly, these results were just based on
one small study [34]. Moreover, this study did not provide any
available data on acceptability. Hence,
larger trials might be
needed to explore the efﬁcacy and safety of iTBS (occipital lobe).
the number of
participants and the studies included in our meta-analysis were
small compared with the meta-analysis for the pharmacological
treatment [49–54]. Second, the study participants included in the
meta-analysis took numerous drugs. For example, benzodiazepine
use might impede the rTMS response, while a psychostimulant
use might be associated with a greater response to rTMS [55, 56].
Third, we used the efﬁcacy data from the day closest to the TMS
treatment completion.
If the antidepressant effect in the TBS
treatment group persists and the antidepressant effect in the
sham group is attenuated, the effect size could be greater when
observed for over a prolonged period. Consequently, larger-scale,
long-term studies of the TBS protocols are warranted to evaluate
the longevity of its effects (e.g., through continuation study).
Furthermore, our study did not address several considerations for
informed choices in daily clinical practice, such as the integration
with pharmacotherapy, other nonpharmacological interventions,
and an analysis of cost-effectiveness.

In conclusion, cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC) and iTBS (L-
the

DLPFC) demonstrate a favorable risk-beneﬁt balance for
treatment of depression.

One of our hypotheses was that

as a two-dimensional graph. We deem that cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS
(L-DLPFC) also improves symptoms in individuals with depression
without mixed episodes, while iTBS (L-DLPFC) alone is a more
straightforward choice and has become the most prominent.
Furthermore,
individuals with depression, cTBS (R-DLPFC)
alone had no therapeutic efﬁcacy. Thus, cTBS (R-DLPFC) may not
be suited for individuals with depression. However, as the number
of participants and studies included in our meta-analysis was
small, larger studies are warranted to generate a robust evidence.
the number of pulses
administered is related to a greater antidepressant effect. This is
supported by the fact that the SNT protocol showed the largest
iTBS protocols
effect size for the primary outcome among all
targeting the L-DLPFC [11]. However, associations between the
magnitude of the effect size for the response rate and number of
pulses during the trial were not found, not only in cTBS (R-
DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC) but also in iTBS (L-DLPFC). Studies with
fewer pulses during a trial were associated with larger effect size
for the response rate than studies with more pulses during a trial
for cTBS (R-DLPFC) + iTBS (L-DLPFC), and the factor also only
inﬂuenced the sham response (less pulses during a trial were
associated with a lower response rate). For the iTBS (L-DLPFC)
protocol, studies with a higher number of pulses during a session
was associated with a larger effect size than studies with a fewer
number of pulses during a session, and the factor also inﬂuenced
the sham response (more pulses during a session were associated
with a lower response rate). Furthermore, other factors related to
the number of pulses were not associated with the effect size
magnitude. Thus, our study results failed to elucidate the
association between the number of pulses and the magnitude
of antidepressant effect of TBS treatment. However, as SNT utilized
a unique treatment protocol not used in other studies as
mentioned above, differences in procedures (including targeting)
between SNT and other studies could inﬂuence the magnitude of
response.

For the accelerated iTBS protocol, in both active and sham iTBS
groups, positive correlations were found between intersession
response rate. However, because the
interval and the exact
coefﬁcients of both treatments were similar, the intersession interval
was not associated with the effect size of the primary outcome.

For iTBS (L-DLPFC), no signiﬁcant difference in the effect size for
the primary outcome between the MDD and BDep were found.

iTBS (L-DLPFC) was considered as one of
the treatments for MDD and BDep.

Although most studies included in our systematic review
