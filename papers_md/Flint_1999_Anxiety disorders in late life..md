OBJECTIVE To review the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of anxiety disorders in
late life.
QUALITY OF EVIDENCE Epidemiologic and comorbidity data are derived from well designed random-
sample community surveys. There are virtually no controlled data specific to treatment of anxiety in
the elderly. Guidelines for treating anxiety disorder.sin late life, therefore, must be extrapolated from
results of randomized controlled trials conducted in younger patients.
MAIN MESSAGE Generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia account for most cases of anxiety
disorder in late life. Late-onset generalized anxiety is usually associated with depressive illness and, in
this situation, the primary pharmacologic treatment is antidepressant medication. Most elderly people
with agoraphobia do not give a history of panic attacks; exposure 'therapy is the preferred treatment for
agoraphobia without panic.
CONCLUSIONS Physicians need to make more use of antidepressant medication and behavioural
therapy and less use of benzodiazepines in treating anxiety disorders in late life.

OBJECTIF Passer en revue l'epidemiologie, les caracteristiques cliniques et la prise en charge des trou-
bles d'anxiete chez les personnes agees.
QUALITE DES DONNEES Les donnees epidemiologiques et sur la comorbidite sont tirees d'etudes bien
con,ues a echantillonnage ale'atoire dans la collectivite. II n'existe presque pas de donnees controlees
portant precisement sur le traitement dq l'anxiet6 chez les personnes agees. Les lignes directrices pour
le traitement des troubles d'anxiete durant l'age mu'r doivent donc etre extrapolees des resultats
d'etudes aleatoires controlees effectuees chez des patients plus jeunes.
PRINCIPAL MESSAGE Les troubles d'anxiete generalisee et l'agoraphobie comptent parmi les cas les
plus frequents d'anxiete chez les personnes agees. LUanxiete generalisee d'apparition tardive est habi-
tuellement associee 'a une maladie depressive et, dans de tels cas, la principale pharmacotherapie est
de recourir aux antidepresseurs. La majorite des personnes agees qui souffrent d'agoraphobie n'ont
pas d'antecedents du syndrome de la panique; une thferapie d'exposition est le traitement de choix pour
l'agoraphobie sans panique.
CONCLUSIONS Les medecins doivent utiliser davantage les antidepresseurs et les therapies du com-
portement et moins recourir aux benzodiazepines dans le traitement des troubles d'anxiete chez les
gens d'age mur.

ymptoms of anxiety lie on a continuum of
severity ranging from a short-lived, appro-
priate response to a threatening situation
to a chronic pathologic state that causes
great distress and interferes with social and occupa-
tional functioning. The term anxiety disorder is used
to describe conditions in which pathologic anxiety is
the predominant feature. These conditions include
phobic disorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety
disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).'

Although anxiety disorders in general are less
prevalent among the elderly than among younger
adults, they remain relatively common in late life.2 For
example, the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study,
which surveyed adults in five areas of the United
States, found that 5.5% of people aged 65 or older met
criteria for phobic disorders, panic disorder, or OCD in
the month preceding the survey.3 In addition, general-
ized anxiety disorder, which was examined at three of
the five sites, was diagnosed in 2.2% of elderly people.4
People with anxiety disorders make heavy use of med-
ical services,5 but despite this, most cases of anxiety
disorder in late life are not diagnosed or treated.6'7
When treatment is given, benzodiazepines are
overused and antidepressant medications and behav-
ioural therapies are underused.668'9 Because the conse-
quences of untreated or inadequately treated anxiety
are distress, functional impairment, and increased
medical morbidity and mortality,102 physicians need
to learn more about detection and appropriate treat-
ment of anxiety disorders in the elderly. This article
reviews the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and
management of these disorders in late life.

Quality of evidence
MEDLINE was searched to identify relevant English-
language articles published from 1980 to 1998. Key
words used in the search were "aged" in combination
with each of "anxiety disorders" and "anxiety," and
"anxiety disorders" in combination with "controlled
clinical trials." The bibliographies of retrieved articles
were reviewed to identify other relevant papers.

Epidemiologic data reported in this article are derived
from well designed random-sample community surveys
conducted in North America and Europe. Only one of
these surveys was undertaken in Canada (in Edmonton).

.........................................................................

Dr Flint is an Associate Professor ofthe Department of
Psychiatry at the University ofToronto, Ont, and Head of
the Geriatric Psychiatry Program at the University Health
Network.

These studies report prevalence rates in people aged 65.
or older for periods ranging from 1 month to 12 months
preceding the survey (period prevalence). Data on
comorbidity are derived either from these epidemiologic
surveys or from clinical samples. Treatment data specific
to the elderly are derived from case reports or uncon-
trolled studies and, therefore, are generally weak. For the
most part guidelines on treating anxiety disorders in late
life must be extrapolated from the results of randomized
controlled trials in younger adults.

Anxdety disorders
Anxiety disorders have a mean age of onset in the
20s." Left untreated, they tend to be chronic, with
symptoms that are either continuous or episodic.13
Most primary anxiety disorders in late life have per-
sisted from younger years.2 New-onset anxiety in
elderly people is often associated with depressive ill-
ness or medical disorders.2 At any age, anxiety disor-
ders are more common in women than men.2

Phobic disorders. Phobias are characterized by per-
sistent and irrational fears of situations, objects, or
activities that result in a compelling desire to avoid
phobic stimuli. Phobias include agoraphobia, specific
or simple phobia, and social phobia.'

Most epidemiologic studies have found that phobias
are the most common anxiety disorder in late life.
Period prevalence ranges from 0YO to 12%Y6, with a median
rate of 3.1%.3683417 Agoraphobia is more common than
specific phobia or social phobia.68"5 In contrast with
other anxiety disorders, many cases of agoraphobia in
late life are new-onset'8 In younger people, agoraphobia
is usually a conditioned response to panic attacks.'9
Elderly people with agoraphobia, however, rarely give a
history of panic attacks,818 and other factors appear to
be related to onset of this disorder in old age. Lindesay18
found that many subjects with late-onset agoraphobia
attributed the start of their fears to traumatic events,
such as physical illness, falls, or muggings.

In evaluating whether an elderly person has a pho-
bic disorder, it is important to assess the appropriate-
ness of the anxiety. Some people might be mistakenly
labeled agoraphobic when their avoidance of a situa-
tion is, in fact, realistic. For example, a frail person
who has had several falls on the street might subse-
quently refuse to leave the house because of a valid
concern about further falls and injury. Conversely,
some elderly people might be reluctant to leave home
because they misattribute symptoms of anxiety (eg,
chest tightness, dyspnea, or dizziness) to medical
conditions and fear they will collapse on the street.

Generalized anxiety disorder. This disorder is
characterized by excessive anxiety and worry accom-
panied by motor tension (muscle tension, restlessness,
fatigue) and hypervigilance (difficulty concentrating,
irritability, insomnia).' The disorder is chronic; symp-
toms occur on most days for 6 months or more.' It dif-
fers from panic disorder in that the symptoms are
pervasive and do not occur as discrete episodes.'

Generalized anxiety disorder is the second most com-
mon anxiety disorder among the elderly. Period preva-
lence rates range from 0.7%9 to 7.1%, with a median rate of
2.2%.46815-17 Generalized anxiety seldom starts as a
"pure" disorder in late life, and most cases of late-onset
generalized anxiety are associated with depressive ill-
ness.8,2022 hlerefore, if older people have symptoms of
generalized anxiety, clinicians should always enquire
about core depressive symptoms. Anxiety that is symp-
tomatic of depression usually resolves with appropriate
antidepressant teatnent' Occasionally, however, anxi-
ety symptoms persist and, in these cases, there could be
increased risk of depressive relapse or recurrence.23

Panic disorder. Panic disorder is characterized by
recurrent attacks of panic. A panic attack is a discrete
period of intense fear or discomfort during which
some somatic symptoms of anxiety, such as dyspnea,
chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, and choking, devel-
op abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes.'
Epidemiologic studies have found that panic dis-
order is uncommon in late life, with period preva-
lence rates of 0.3% or less.3'6'8"4 This disorder rarely
starts for the first time after the sixth decade of life.2
When elderly people do experience panic attacks,
symptoms are similar to those experienced by
younger people, although patients with late-onset
panic attacks might have fewer symptoms and might
do less to avoid the attacks than younger people.24
Most late-onset panic attacks are associated with
depressive disorders or medical illnesses, in particu-
lar cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and chronic pul-
monary diseases.25'26

Posttraumatic stress disorder. Posttraumatic
stress disorder develops in people who have been
exposed to markedly distressing trauma that is out-
side the range of normal human experience. The
trauma is then re-experienced in a variety of ways
including distressing recollections, dreams, and
flashbacks. Other symptoms of PTSD include persis-
tent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma,
numbing of general responsiveness (eg, feeling
detached from other people), and symptoms of
hyperarousal (eg, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle
response).'

There are no data on the period prevalence of
PTSD in the general elderly population. Most
research into PTSD in late life has examined people
who are survivors of the Holocaust or who were pris-
oners of war during World War IJ.27-3o In these
groups, symptoms of PTSD tend to be chronic and to
persist into late life in up to 70% of cases.2730 A few
investigators have also noted an association between
the occurrence of stressful life events in old age (eg,
reminders of the war experience, deteriorating
health, or bereavement) and worsening or re-emer-
gence of PTSD symptoms.31 32 A PTSD can also
develop for the first time in late life following natural
and other disasters.3334 For most of these lateonset
cases, the distress diminishes over time, but quite a
few people continue to experience symptoms for at
least 2 years after the disaster.34 A consistent finding
of PTSD research is that the intensity and chronicity
of symptoms are positively correlated with the
severity of trauma.

Obsessive compulsive disorder. The essential fea-
ture of OCD is recurrent obsessions, compulsions, or
both.' Obsessions are ideas, thoughts, or impulses
that are experienced as senseless and intrusive and
persist despite attempts to suppress them.
Compulsions are repetitive, purposeful behaviours
performed in response to obsessions or in a stereo-
typical fashion, with the goal of reducing distress or
preventing some dreaded event or situation. The
activity is either not connected in a realistic way with
what it is designed to prevent or is clearly excessive
(eg, ritualized hand-washing, repeated checking).
Period prevalence of OCD in the elderly varies
from 0% to 1.5%, with a median rate of 0.6%.3141617
Approximately 5% of patients attending specialty
OCD clinics are aged 60 or older.35'36 In most of
these cases, the OCD began much earlier in life.
Preliminary research suggests that the symptoms of
this illness do not change markedly as people
grow older.36

Comorbidity
Depression. Anxiety often coexists with depres-
sion.4 In the elderly, anxious depression is probably
the most common presentation of anxiety in primary
care.37 Major depression is present in up to 70% of
older people with generalized anxiety disorder8'20
and in quite a few people with phobias or PTSD.8,18"34
Similarly, 20% to 30% of elderly patients with major
depression have generalized anxiety disorder,
and up to 75% of older depressed patients have
clinically significant subsyndromal symptoms of
generalized anxiety.9 38

Dementia. Recent epidemiologic research has found
that the prevalence of anxiety disorders alone (ie,
without depression) is not increased in people with
dementia.39 Anxiety symptoms are often present,
however, in people with dementia and, in these cases,
anxiety is frequently associated with depression.7
Agitation is frequently seen in people with demen-
tia. Agitation is purposeless motor hyperactivity or
restlessness. It is not synonymous with anxiety, but
in some people with dementia it might be a behav-
ioural expression of subjective anxiety that cannot be
communicated through words.

Medical illness. There is a complex interplay
between anxiety, medical illness, and the medica-
tions used to treat these conditions. First, realistic
worry and pathologic anxiety could be conse-
quences of physical illness. Second, anxiety might

CME

itself contribute to medical morbidity or mortality
(eg, people with high levels of anxiety are at
increased risk of hypertension,10 arrhythmias follow-
ing myocardial infarction,1" and death from cardio-
vascular disease12).

Third, anxiety might be misdiagnosed as a med-
ical condition or vice versa. Generalized anxiety dis-
order, panic disorder, and PTFSD have autonomic and
other physical symptoms that might be mistakenly
attributed to medical illness, with the result that
affected patients receive unnecessary investigations
and medications and do not receive appropriate treat-
ment for anxiety. Patients with anxious depression
might also focus on somatic complaints, such as
fatigue, pain, or constipation and, as a consequence,
the mood disorder might be missed. On the other
hand, some medical conditions, such as hyperthy-
roidism, hypercalcemia, pheochromocytoma, or
paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, might mimic an anxi-
ety disorder but are usually correctly diagnosed fol-
lowing careful evaluation.

Fourth, anxiety-like symptoms might be caused by
toxicity from stimulants (eg, theophylline, [B-agonists,
sympathomimetics, thyroxine, amphetamines, caf-
feine) and withdrawal from depressants (eg, benzodi-
azepines, alcohol). Finally, increased disability could
result from excessive benzodiazepine use by people
with physical illness and anxiety (eg, benzodi-
azepines might reduce respiratory drive in patients
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,40 lead-
ing to a vicious circle of worsening dyspnea and anxi-
ety and increased prescription of medications for
these conditions).

Management
For most people, acute situational anxiety improves
with support, reassurance, and the passage of time.
Formal psychotherapy and pharmacologic treatment
are reserved for people with pathologic anxiety,
defined as anxiety persisting for more than several
weeks or when the anxiety, regardless of its duration,
is causing serious distress or impairment in function.

Cognitive and behavioural treatments. Cogni-
tive and behavioural strategies have well established
efficacy for treating anxiety disorders in younger
adults. Cognitive therapy is consistently more effec-
tive than no therapy or placebo for panic disorder
with or without agoraphobia, generalized anxiety dis-
order, PTSD, and social phobia.'3 Exposure therapy
is particularly useful for treating phobic avoidance
and compulsive rituals.'3

Anxiety disorders in late life

There has been little evaluation of cognitive and
behavioural therapies for elderly patients. Case
reports have described use of exposure therapy to
successfully treat older people suffering from OCD
or phobic avoidance.4'42 Preliminary uncontrolled
data suggest that cognitive-behavioural therapy could
benefit older patients with panic disorder43 but, to
date, is ineffective for elderly subjects with chronic
primary generalized anxiety disorder.'

Exposure therapy encourages patients to face
feared situations or objects. Exposure usually occurs
in a graded fashion over several weeks. Best results
are obtained when exposure is prolonged rather than
brief, takes place in real life rather than in fantasy,
and is regularly practised by patients through self-
exposure homework. Exposure therapy requires min-
imal training and can be carried out in primary care
settings. Elderly people with agoraphobia are often
supported at home by family members or domiciliary
services. It is important that behavioural therapy is
accompanied by withdrawal of any unnecessary sup-
port, because the ongoing presence of supports will
reinforce the phobic behaviour and will likely under-
mine the behavioural intervention.45

The premise of the cognitive model of anxiety is
that it is not events per se but peoples' expectations
and interpretations of events that are responsible for
the anxiety. According to this theory, anxious people
overestimate the danger inherent in a situation,

thereby causing an activation of autonomic and
behavioural manifestations of anxiety. They then mis-
interpret these sensations as a further source of
threat, leading to a vicious circle that maintains or
exacerbates their anxiety disorder.46 Cognitive thera-
py involves identifying, evaluating, controlling, and
modifying these negative thoughts and cognitive dis-
tortions and attributions. Cognitive therapy is quite
brief (five to 20 sessions) and highly structured and
is usually carried out by a psychiatrist or psycholo-
gist trained in the procedure.

Cognitive and behavioural treatments obviously
need to be tailored to people's physical and cognitive
capacity. They might not be useful for elderly people
with severe physical limitations or moderate-to-
severe intellectual impairment.

Pharmacologic treatment.
Antidepressants: Controlled trials involving patients of
various ages have found that several anxiety disor-
ders respond to antidepressant medications
(Table 1'3'74'). Case reports and case series suggest
that older people with these disorders can also bene-
fit from antidepressants. 2641'49'50 The elderly, however,
might be particularly vulnerable to the anticholiner-
gic, hypotensive, and cardiac effects of imipramine
and clomipramine, which are, respectively, the tri-
cyclic antidepressants of choice for treatment of
panic disorder and OCD. Therefore, selective

serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which do not
cause these adverse effects, are preferable first-line
treatment for these disorders in the elderly. If started
at too high a dose, SSRIs could initially exacerbate
symptoms of anxiety and, therefore, anxious patients
should be started at a lower dose (eg, 5 mg/d of
paroxetine or 25 mg/d of sertraline).

Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines are an effective
treatment for acute situational anxiety, generalized
anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social phobia
(Table 1).13As previously noted, most elderly people
with symptoms of generalized anxiety also have
depressive illness and, in these cases, the primary
pharmacologic treatment should be antidepressant
medication. Some patients with anxious depression,
however, might also need short-term benzodiazepine
treatment until the antidepressant becomes effective.
All benzodiazepines have the capacity to cause
cognitive impairment, psychomotor impairment,
instability of gait, falls, and hip fractures.51'52 For older
people, benzodiazepines that are metabolized by con-
jugation (eg, lorazepam, oxazepam) are preferred
because their clearance is unaffected by aging and,
therefore, their active ingredients are less likely to
accumulate and cause toxicity.5'

Most elderly people who are prescribed benzodi-
azepines do not require them on an ongoing basis.
Sometimes, however, long-term benzodiazepine treat-
ment is necessary. In particular, some patients with
long-standing primary generalized anxiety disorder,
who have been maintained on benzodiazepines for
years, experience significant worsening of anxiety
when attempts are made to withdraw the medication,
even when the dose is tapered very gradually. In such
cases, if the benzodiazepine is not causing serious side
effects, it is usually least disruptive to patients to contin-
ue the medication and monitor them regularly. If side
effects do become an issue as people grow older, dose
reduction rather than complete discontinuation might
be the best compromise. Long-term use of benzodi-
azepines for treatment of insomnia is not warranted for
most patients, and many patients can be successfully
withdrawn from benzodiazepine hypnotics.53

Buspirone: Research data suggest that buspirone is
an effective treatment for generalized anxiety disor-
der.52 Unlike benzodiazepines, buspirone is nonsedat-
ing, does not cause serious cognitive or psychomotor
impairment, does not suppress respiratory drive, is
unlikely to cause dependence, and does not cause with-
drawal symptoms following
discontinuation.52
Therefore, from the point of view of tolerability and
safety, buspirone has advantages over benzodiazepines

in later life. Some research data suggest, however, that
buspirone has less efficacy for patients previously treat-
ed with benzodiazepines.525' Therefore, its usefulness
for managing elderly patients with chronic generalized
anxiety disorder, many of whom have been treated with
benzodiazepines, is unclear. Also, because buspirone
has a delayed onset of action of several weeks, it is not
suitable for acute situational anxiety or for acute treat-
ment of anxiety symptoms associated with depression.
Buspirone might have a role in treatment of general-
ized anxiety in nondepressed patients with chronic
medical illness (eg, patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease).52

Conclusion
Generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia
account for most cases of late-onset anxiety. Late-
onset generalized anxiety disorder is usually associat-
ed with depressive illness and, in this situation, the
primary pharmacologic treatment is antidepressant
medication, not benzodiazepines. Most people with
late-onset agoraphobia do not give a history of panic
attacks. Cognitive-behavioural therapy is the treat-
ment of choice for agoraphobia without panic. #
