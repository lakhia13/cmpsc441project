Background: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted rapid, reflexive transition from face-to-face to online healthcare. 
For  group-based addiction services, evidence for the impact  on service  delivery and participant  experience is 
limited. 
Methods:  A  12-month  (plus  2-month  follow-up)  pragmatic  evaluation  of  the  upscaling  of  online  mutual-help 
groups  by SMART  Recovery  Australia  (SRAU)  was  conducted  using  The  Reach  Effectiveness  Adoption  Imple-
mentation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Data captured by SRAU between 1st July 2020 and 31st August 
2021 included participant questionnaires, Zoom Data Analytics and administrative logs. 
Results:  Reach:  The  number  of  online  groups  increased  from  just  6  pre-COVID-19  to  132.  These  groups  were 
delivered  on  2786  (M  = 232.16,  SD  = 42.34  per  month)  occasions,  to  41,752  (M  = 3479.33,  SD  = 576.34) 
attendees. Effectiveness: Participants (n = 1052) reported finding the online group meetings highly engaging and 
a positive, recovery supportive experience. 91 % of people with experience of face-to-face group meetings rated 
their online experience as equivalent or better. Adoption: Eleven services (including SRAU) and five volunteers 
delivered group meetings for the entire 12-months. Implementation: SRAU surpassed their goal of establishing 100 
groups. Maintenance: The average number of meetings delivered [t(11.14) = -1.45, p = 0.1737] and attendees [t 
(1.95) = -3.28, p = 0.1880] per month were maintained across a two-month follow-up period. 
Conclusions: SRAU scaled-up the delivery of online mutual-help groups in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Findings support the accessibility, acceptability and sustainability of delivering SMART Recovery mutual-help 
groups  online.  Not  only  are  these  findings  important  in  light  of  the  global  pandemic  and  public  safety,  but 
they demonstrate the potential for reaching and supporting difficult and under-served populations.   

1. Introduction 

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  had  a  profound  impact  on  mental 
health  and  wellbeing.  A range of  mental  health  related consequences 
have been documented, (Ornell et al., 2020) including elevated rates of 
stress, anxiety and depression worldwide (Torales et al., 2020; Hossain 
et al., 2020). Hazardous rates of alcohol use, smoking and other sub-
stances  have  also  increased  (Ornell  et  al.,  2020).  Other  potentially 

problematic  behaviours  associated  with  internet  use,  gambling  and 
gaming have risen to unprecedented levels (Dubey et al., 2020). People 
with  pre-existing  experience  of  mental  health  conditions  and/  or 
addictive  behaviours  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  the  psychological 
impact of the pandemic (Ornell et al., 2020; Hossain et al., 2020). 

The isolation and physical distancing measures introduced to miti-
gate the impact of COVID-19 significantly disrupted face-to-face service 
provision for people with experience of addictive behaviours, (Du et al.,

Beck et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

2020) necessitating increased use of online technologies by health and 
social care providers. Remote delivery allows the provision of accessible, 
flexible,  tailored  support  even  under  restrictive  pandemic  conditions 
(Rauschenberg  et  al.,  2021).  Accumulating  evidence  supports  the 
feasibility and acceptability of using video-conferencing platforms (e.g. 
Zoom) to deliver healthcare (Kruse et al., 2017). Preliminary evidence 
also supports the clinical and cost effectiveness of telehealth for people 
with  addictive  behaviours  (Kruse  et  al.,  2020;  Jiang  et  al.,  2017;  Lin 
et al., 2019). However, evidence for group-based telehealth services is 
currently limited (Gentry et al., 2019). Given that social connectedness 
is central to recovery from addictive behaviours; (Bathish et al., 2017) 
remote access to group-based services may be particularly important for 
addressing  the  mental  and  behavioural  challenges  arising  from  the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

Mutual-help  groups  are  one  of  the  most  common,  accessible  and 
valued methods for accessing support for addictive behaviours (Kasku-
tas  et  al.,  2014;  Kelly  and  Yeterian,  2011).  A  range  of  mutual-help 
groups  are  available,  including  12-step  programs  (e.g.  Alcoholics 
Anonymous)  and  other  secular  options,  including  SMART  Recovery, 
Women for Sobriety and LifeRing. (Zemore, 2017) Increasing evidence 
supports  the  benefits  of  mutual-help  groups  for  improving  substance 
use, (Beck et al., 2017; Kelly et al., 2020) and mental health outcomes. 
(Bassuk et al., 2016) Mutual-help groups have been found to enhance 
recovery supportive social connections, coping skills, self-efficacy and 
recovery  motivation.  (Tracy  and  Wallace,  2016;  Kelly,  2017)  People 
may also be more willing to attend mutual-help groups due to the stigma 
associated with accessing specialist addiction services. (Faulkner et al., 
2013; du Plessis et al., 2020; Watson, 2019; Eddie et al., 2019) However, 
compared to current understanding of face-to-face mutual-help groups, 
comparatively  less  is  known  about  remote  access  delivery.  (Ashford 
et al., 2020; Bergman et al., 2018) Much of the evidence is derived from 
either evaluations of asynchronous groups (e.g. forums), (Haug et al., 
2020; Schwebel and Orban, 2022; Bergman et al., 2017; Chambers et al., 
2017) or virtual delivery of 12-step groups, (Penfold and Ogden, 2021; 
Bender et al., 2022; Hoffmann and Dudkiewicz, 2021; Galanter et al., 
2022; Senreich et al., 2022; Barrett and Murphy, 2021) with scant evi-
dence  for  online  SMART  Recovery  groups.  (Timko  et  al.,  2022;  Beck 
et  al.,  2022)  Given  that  not  all  individuals  engage  well  with  12-step 
approaches,  research  examining  participant  experience  of  alternative 
approaches is an important priority. (Bergman et al., 2021). 

SMART  Recovery  mutual-help  groups  incorporate  evidence-based 
principles and strategies (e.g. motivational interviewing and cognitive 
behavioural  therapy)  to  offer  support  for  a  range of  addictive behav-
iours. (Kelly et al., 2017) SMART Recovery group based meetings are 
based on a four-point program (building motivation, coping with urges, 
problem  solving  and  lifestyle  balance)  and  all  meetings  are  led  by  a 
trained facilitator. (SMART, xxxx) SMART Recovery Australia (SRAU) 
partners with volunteers and a range of general health, mental health 
and addiction service providers across the private, public and not for 
profit sectors to deliver mutual-help groups nationwide. 

1.1. The current evaluation 

Prior  to  COVID-19,  Australian  SMART  Recovery  groups  provided 
support to approximately 2200 people each week across 346 face-to-face 
groups and just six online groups. To meet the continued support needs 
of  people  with  addictive  behaviours  during  the  pandemic,  SRAU  was 
awarded funding by the Commonwealth Government of Australia under 
the  Drug  and  Alcohol  Program  to  upscale  online  delivery  of  SMART 
Recovery groups. SRAU sought to establish at least 100 online groups 
during the 12-month funded project. To maximise sustainability, SRAU 
set a goal of 80 % of groups delivered by third-party providers (including 
trained  facilitators  located  within  private,  not-for-profit  and  govern-
ment run health and social care organisations), and 20 % by SRAU staff 
and  volunteers.  This  goal  was  based  on  the  staff,  time  and  resources 
available  in-house  for  delivering  mutual-help  groups.  To  address 

inequity in service provision, SRAU also sought to establish groups for 
targeted  cohorts  (women  and  culturally,  linguistically  and  gender 
diverse people). The current evaluation examined the Reach Effective-
ness Adoption Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) of the scaling 
up of SRAU’s online mutual-help groups in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

2. Methods 

Ethics approval was granted by the Joint University of Wollongong 
and  Illawarra  Shoalhaven  Local  Health  District  Health  and  Medical 
Human Research Ethics Committee (2020/ETH02893). This evaluation 
was  conducted  across  a  14-month  period,  comprising  the  12-month 
funded  SRAU  project,  and  subsequent  2-months.  It  was  informed  by 
the  RE-AIM  (Reach  Effectiveness  Adoption  Implementation  Mainte-
nance)  framework.  (Glasgow  et  al.,  2019)  This  framework  is  a  well- 
utilised, evidence based approach that is employed within health-care 
and  community  settings  to  direct  the  planning  and  evaluation  of  in-
novations to service delivery. (Glasgow et al., 2019) To maximise the 
uptake  and  sustainability  of  healthcare  innovations,  this  framework 
guides  evaluators  to  consider  key  factors  across  the  level  of  the  indi-
vidual,  service  provider,  setting  and  organisation.  Aligned  with  pub-
lished recommendations for ensuring that these considerations guide the 
evaluation of real-world initiatives, we adopted a pragmatic approach 
(Glasgow  and  Estabrooks,  2018)  that  leveraged  real-world  data 
captured  by  SRAU.  The  definition  of  each  RE-AIM  domain,  (Glasgow 
and Estabrooks, 2018) operationalisation within the current evaluation 
and data sources are summarised in Table 1. Briefly, Reach focuses on 
data  collection  at  the  level  of  attendees  and  meetings;  Effectiveness  is 
indexed by participant evaluation; Adoption focuses on data collection at 
the  level  of  the  provider  and  organisation;  Implementation  outcomes 
focus  on  the  overall  initiative  and  are  therefore  derived  from  apriori 
targets established by SRAU and Maintenance focuses on the two months 
following  the  12-month  funding  period  with  regard  to  attendees  and 
meetings. For context, we begin by summarising how SRAU approached 
the task of upscaling online service provision. 

2.1. Summary of SRAU methods 

To  begin,  SRAU  supported  existing  facilitators  to  transition  their 
face-to-face groups online. Contact was made with volunteers and third- 
party providers to explore the option of moving their group(s) online. 
SRAU  provided  interested  parties  with  log-in  details  for  Zoom,  sup-
ported them to set-up their Zoom account and helped orient them to the 
Zoom platform (as needed). Facilitators then nominated the preferred 
date and time of their group, which was added by SRAU to the list of 
advertised groups available on the SRAU website. SRAU endeavoured to 
offer a support call following the first online group conducted by each 
facilitator. 

New  facilitators  were  also  trained  using  a  purpose  built  online 
training platform developed in 2019. This two phase training involves 
four modules of training content, and a collection of  video role-plays 
demonstrating SMART Recovery group facilitation skills. A skill devel-
opment  session  with  a  SRAU  trainer  and  four  trainees  conducted  via 
Zoom  comprised the  second  phase. Following  completion  of training, 
facilitators were asked to notify SRAU if they wished to start an online 
group. Interested facilitators were then supported to establish a group as 
per the methods outlined above. Over the course of the project SRAU 
developed  several  resources  to  support  facilitators.  This  included  a 
PowerPoint slideshow to help guide the structure of online groups, and a 
Facilitator Network Facebook group for all online and in-person facili-
tators. SRAU also offered fortnightly facilitator support groups via Zoom 
to any interested facilitators.

Note. aTo account for the facilitator, ‘attendees’ are defined as (total number of participants (cid:0) 1) × the total number of groups; bAverage delivery per month per group is 
derived from the total number of times the each group was delivered, divided by the number of months it was delivered at least once; cIn addition to descriptive 
statistics, the number of volunteers and service providers who delivered online groups at least once within every month of the evaluation was calculated and used as an 
index of ongoing engagement; c Calculated as the number of Unique meeting IDs used to deliver groups (n = 174) minus the number of IDs only used once (n = 42) 
minus the six existing meetings. 

2.2. RE-AIM evaluation 

2.2.1. Data source 

Throughout the total 14-month evaluation period (1st July 2020 to 
31st August 2021) SRAU routinely collected data using three primary 
methods: self-report participant questionnaire, Zoom data analytics and 
administrative  logs.  The  research  team  also  conducted  a  concurrent 
qualitative evaluation to explore participant and facilitator experience 
with  online  groups.  These  qualitative  findings  will  be  reported 
separately. 

2.2.1.1. Self-report  participant  Questionnaire. A  self-selected,  conve-
nience sample of participants was recruited. SRAU embedded a link to 
an  online  Survey  Monkey  questionnaire  in  the  post-group  Zoom  exit 
page.  This  brief  questionnaire  was  developed  in-house  by  SRAU  to 
routinely capture participant data and was presented at the end of every 
meeting held across the duration of the evaluation. Participants were 
asked  to  complete  the  questionnaire  only  once,  based  on  their  most 
recent  online  group  experience.  The  questionnaire  captured  basic  de-
mographic information and reason/s for attending the online group that 
day. It also contained items to assess participant experience of the group. 
A series of five-point Likert scale items assessed participant engagement 
(the degree to which participants felt they were welcomed, supported, 
and  had  an  opportunity  to  contribute);  experience  (skill  of  the  facili-
tator,  experience  of  technical  difficulties);  and  self-reported  contribu-
tion of the online group to recovery (acquisition of practical information 
and strategies, degree to which the group was experienced as helpful 

and intention to continue attending). Participants’ use of the ‘seven-day 
plan’ in the current and preceding group was also assessed. The seven- 
day  plan  is  a  change  plan,  (SMART,  2016;  SMRT,  2015)  that  com-
prises  one  or  more  realistic,  personally  meaningful  goals  for  the  up-
coming  week.  For  example,  participants  from  Australian  SMART 
Recovery groups (Gray et al., 2020) have described how they use the 
seven-day plan to set targets for changing their behaviour of concern (e. 
g. reducing or abstaining from use) and/ or more general lifestyle goals 
(e.g. commencing, increasing or maintaining engagement in self-care, 
social, recreational or vocational activities). Progress towards this plan 
is  reviewed  in  subsequent  groups  and  the  plan  revised  as  needed 
following  feedback  and  self-reflection.  Although  a  range  of  tools  are 
available  to SMART  Recovery  participants,  the  survey  focused specif-
ically on participant use of the seven-day plan because goal setting is 
central  to  the  structure  of  Australian  SMART  Recovery  groups  and 
leaving a session with a seven-day plan is an essential strategy for taking 
specific action toward goal achievement. For example, prior research in 
Australian  SMART  Recovery  groups  found  that  participants  who  left 
meetings with a seven-day plan were more likely to report the use of 
behavioural  activation.  (Kelly  et  al.,  2015)  Finally,  participants  were 
asked to rate their satisfaction with online delivery relative to face-to- 
face groups.  Completion of  the  questionnaire  was  anonymous, volun-
tary and no incentive was provided. 

A total of 1107 questionnaires were completed across the 12-month 
period  of  funding.  Duplicate  respondents  were  identified  based  on  a 
combination of IP address, gender and age (n = 21). Thirty-four par-
ticipants  declined  to  have  their  anonymous  data  used  for  research 

AddictiveBehaviors139(2023)1075773A.K. Beck et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

purposes,  leaving  a  sample  of  1052  survey  respondents.  Participant 
postcode was used to classify the location of respondents according to 
the five categories of ‘remoteness’  defined by the Australian Standard 
Geographical  Classification  (ASGC;  Major  City,  Inner  Regional,  Outer 
Regional, Remote, Very Remote). 

2.2.1.2. Zoom  data  analytics. Information  pertaining  to  the  usage  of 
online groups was automatically captured by Zoom throughout the 14- 
month evaluation period. The ‘meetings’ section of the Zoom dashboard 
was used to download information about each SMART Recovery group 
meeting  held  (including  ‘meeting  ID’,  host,  topic,  ‘number  of  partici-
pants’  and  ‘meeting  duration’).  ‘Meeting  ID’  is  the  unique  identifier 
assigned by Zoom to an online group (based on the specified host, time, 
day  and  whether  or  not  the  meeting  is  recurring).  We  defined  an 
‘established’ group as one that occurred more than once. Therefore, the 
number  of  online  groups  established  is  defined  as  (total  number  of 
unique meeting IDs used to deliver an online group) – (meeting IDs only 
used once) – (the number of online groups running prior to the current 
evaluation). The number of ‘groups delivered’ (i.e. ‘meetings’) is defined 
as the total number of online SMART Recovery groups delivered via the 
SMART  Recovery  zoom  account  across  the  evaluation  period  (i.e. 
including  one-off  meetings).  The  ‘number  of  participants’  metric  in 
Zoom  is  derived  from  the  number  of  log-ins  to  a  given  group  and 
captured and stored as an aggregate value. Although we are unable to 
account  for  multiple  log-ins  by  the  same  attendee  across  the  study 
period, to account for the facilitator, we defined “attendees”  as: (total 
‘number of participants’ – 1) × the total number of ‘groups delivered’. 

2.2.1.3. Administrative  logs. SRAU  maintained  administrative  logs 
using Arlo Training Management Software and Microsoft Excel to cap-
ture data pertaining to project milestones, third-party organisations and 
facilitator training (e.g. training completion; registration as a facilitator; 
facilitator name and organisation; facilitator email address). The num-
ber of third-party providers with the potential ‘capacity’ to deliver on-
line groups is based on the number of third-party providers who a) were 
provided with log-in details and were oriented to the Zoom platform, b) 
had one or more facilitators complete training and/ or c) delivered one 
or more online groups during the 12-month funded project period. 

2.2.2. Statistical analysis 

Each element of the RE-AIM framework was analysed separately. The 
CSV files for the participant questionnaire and all Zoom Data analytics 
were  downloaded  and  analysed  using  SPSS  or  Microsoft  Excel.  All 
quantitative  data  was  summarised  using  descriptive  statistics  (mean, 
standard deviation, range, sum and/ or proportion), as appropriate. To 
examine consistency of group delivery across time, we firstly calculated 
the total number of times that each group was delivered and then the 
number of months in which it was delivered at least once. These values 
were used to generate an estimate of the average number of times per 
month each group was delivered while accounting for the varied dura-
tion of delivery across the 12–months of the evaluation. Aligned with 
recommendations for reducing bias and controlling Type I error when 
comparing two independent groups, (Delacre et al., 2017) we adopted a 
conservative approach and compared the average number of groups and 
attendees per month during the maintenance phase to the preceding 12- 
month  evaluation  period  using  separate  Welch’s  t-tests.  (Gaetano, 
2019). 

2.3. Results 

2.3.1. Reach 

Between 1st July 2020 and 30th June 2021 a total of 2786 meetings 
were delivered to approximately 41,752 attendees. In any one month, an 
average  of  232.16  (SD  = 42.34;  Range  = 178–312)  meetings  were 
delivered  to  an  average  of  3479.33  (SD  = 576.34;  Range  = 2512  to 

4538) attendees. For each meeting delivered there was an average of 
14.98 (SD = 10.85; Range = 1–73) attendees. On average, each group 
was delivered on approximately 16 occasions (M = 16.98, SD = 17.54; 
Range = 1–66) across approximately-four months (M = 4.89, SD = 4.07; 
Range  = 1–12),  equating  to  roughly-three  meetings  per  month,  per 
group. 

The characteristics of survey respondents are presented in Table 2. 
Approximately half of respondents were male (n = 547, 52 %) and aged 
35–44 (n = 275, 26.1 %). Approximately 2 % were of Aboriginal and/ or 
Torres  Strait  Islander  descent  (n  = 26).  The  majority  of  respondents 
were located in ‘major city’ locations (n = 753, 71 %). Use of alcohol 
was the most frequently endorsed reason for attending an online SMART 
Recovery group (n = 761; 72 %), followed by tobacco (n = 139; 13.2 %) 
and methamphetamine (n = 136; 12 %) use. More than a third selected 
multiple behaviours (n = 406, 38.6 %; M = 1.63, SD = 1.17; Range =
0–11) as their reason for attending. A total of 485 (46.1 %) participants 
attended an online SMART Recovery group for the first time on the day

that they completed the survey. 

2.3.2. Effectiveness 

Participant responses regarding engagement, experience and recov-
ery are presented in Table 3. Self-reported engagement with the online 
group  meetings  was  strong,  with  the  majority  of  survey  respondents 
endorsing ‘agree’  or ‘strongly agree’ with feeling welcomed (n = 986, 
93  %),  supported  (n  = 961,  91  %)  and  having  an  opportunity  to 
contribute (n = 962, 91 %). Participant experience was largely positive, 
with the majority of participants endorsing ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ to 
the meeting being well facilitated (n = 970, 92 %), although one in five 
respondents  (n  = 219,  20.81  %)  endorsed  either  ‘agree’  or  ‘strongly 
agree’  to  experiencing  technical  difficulties.  Online  groups  made  a 
positive contribution to the recovery of the majority of respondents with 
85 % (n = 900) leaving the meeting with practical information, strate-
gies and/ or resources; 90 % experiencing the group as helpful (n = 948) 
and  91  %  (n  = 965)  intending  to  continue  attending  online  SMART 
Recovery groups. Of the 567 (53.9 %) participants who had attended a 
SMART  Recovery  meeting  previously,  370  (35  %)  had  attended  the 
previous week. Of those, 262 (70.8 %) left that meeting with a seven-day 
plan. Of the participants who completed a seven-day plan the preceding 
week, the majority reported that they found the plan to be very (n = 118, 
45 %) or extremely (n = 80, 31 %) helpful. 

A  total  of  555  participants  responded  to  the  question  about  how 
online groups compared to face-to-face (SRAU added this question after 
data collection had commenced). Just over one-third (n = 210, 37 %) 
had only attended online meetings, so could not make a comparison. Of 
the remaining 345 participants, approximately half indicated that online 
meetings were either ‘better’ (n = 89, 26 %) or ‘much better’ (n = 89, 26 
%)  than  face-to-face  meetings  and  just  over  one  third  felt  they  were 
‘about the same’ (n = 129, 37 %). 

47  different  services.  Service  information  for  the  remaining  21  in-
dividuals was not provided. Of these 47 services, less than one third (n =
13, 27.6 %) went on to deliver an online meeting. 

2.3.4.

Implementation 

The  number  of  new  online  SMART  Recovery  mutual-help  groups 
established  during  the  initial  12-month  evaluation  period  (n  = 126) 
exceeded  SRAU’s  a-priori  target  of  100.  Aligned  with  their  target 
involvement of third-party providers, almost 80 % of all meetings (n =
2118, 76 %) were delivered by third-party providers. Third-party pro-
viders included a range of private, not-for-profit and government run 
organisations delivering addiction services, general health or social care 
within  community,  residential  and/  or  inpatient  settings.  Regarding 
equity, of the 2786 meetings delivered, 375 (13.4 %) were targeted to 
provide a dedicated support space for: women (n = 134, 4.8 %); men (n 
= 55, 1.9 %); young people (n = 56, 2 %); family and friends (n = 118, 
4.3 %); people of Aboriginal and/ or Torres Strait Islander descent (n =
11, 0.3 %) and Korean language speakers (n = 1, 0.03 %). 

2.3.5. Maintenance 

In the two-months following the funded 12-month project, a further 
500 meetings (M = 250, SD = 1.41, Range = 249–251 per month) were 
delivered.  These  meetings  were  attended  by  approximately  8988  at-
tendees (M = 4494, SD = 367.69, Range = 4234–4754 per month), with 
an average of 17.97 (SD = 12.73) attendees per meeting (Range = 1 to 
103). The average number of meetings [t(11.14) = -1.45, p = 0.1737] 
and  attendees  [t(1.95)  = -3.28,  p  = 0.1880]  per  month  during  the 
maintenance phase did not significantly differ from the preceding 12- 
month evaluation period. 

3. Discussion 

2.3.3. Adoption 

Half  (n  = 38,  50  %)  of  the  third-party  service  providers  with  the 
potential capacity to deliver online groups delivered at least one online 
meeting  during the 12-month  evaluation period. The total number of 
SRAU staff, volunteers and third-party providers per month who deliv-
ered  online  meetings  across  the  initial  12-month  evaluation  period is 
presented  in  Fig.  1.  A  total  of  11  services  (including  SRAU)  and  five 
volunteers delivered online meetings for the entire 12-month duration of 
the evaluation. 

A total of 130 new facilitators completed training during the initial 
12-month evaluation period, comprising 109 individuals working across 

The  COVID-19  pandemic  triggered  widespread  closure  of  SMART 
Recovery mutual-help groups across the world. (Kelly et al., 2021) To 
meet the continued support needs of people affected by addictive be-
haviours,  SRAU  undertook  a  project  to  expand  the  delivery  of  online 
mutual-help groups. In light of limited evidence for the delivery of on-
line groups for addictive behaviours, the purpose of the current evalu-
ation was to assess the impact of this real-world healthcare innovation. 
Although  we  are  unable  to  partial  out  the  increase  in  online  service 
provision that would have occurred naturally within the context of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, this pragmatic evaluation demonstrated positive 
change across all domains of the RE-AIM framework. (Glasgow et al.,

2019; Glasgow and Estabrooks, 2018) Moreover, this study contributes 
new knowledge on the characteristics of attendees and how these online- 
groups  were  experienced  by  participants  during  the  COVID-19 
pandemic. 

Regarding participant characteristics, the age, location and primary 
behaviour of concern reported by participants in the current study ap-
pears broadly consistent with published Australian data for face-to-face 
groups.  (Raftery  et  al.,  2019;  Kelly  et  al.,  2021;  Beck  et  al.,  2021) 
However, consistent with recent evidence for the gender distribution of 
online mutual-help groups, (Timko et al., 2022; Beck et al., 2022) the 
current sample does appear to comprise a larger proportion of females 
(46.8  %)  than  that  of  Australian  face-to-face  groups  (31.9  %-39  %). 
(Raftery et al., 2019; Kelly et al., 2021; Beck et al., 2021) This may be 
due to the increase in the number of women only groups offered during 
the study period. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that women seeking 
treatment  for  addictive  behaviours  may  prefer  single  gender  groups. 
(Sugarman et al., 2022) Telehealth may also help to overcome a range of 
barriers  encountered  by  women  when  trying  to  access  treatment  and 
support. (Goldstein et al., 2018). 

Our findings also point to the potential therapeutic benefit of online 
mutual-help groups. Participant evaluation of online SMART Recovery 
groups was extremely positive with regard to engagement, experience 
and  impact  on  recovery.  The  majority  of  survey  respondents  felt 
welcomed, supported  and able  to contribute. This  is especially prom-
ising  given  that  group  cohesion  may  be  adversely  affected  in  online 
settings. (Sugarman et al., 2021) Indeed, of those who had previously 
attended face-to-face groups 89 % felt that online groups were just as 
good (37 %) or better (52 %). Similarly, in a survey of 12-step attendees, 
the majority found that online meetings were at least ‘as effective’ for 
promoting abstinence as face-to-face meetings. (Galanter et al., 2022) 
Given  the  widespread  and  rapid  transition  of  face-to-face  healthcare 
services to virtual delivery seen during COVID-19, (Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. Using Telehealth to Expand Access to Essential 
Health  Services  during  the  COVID-19  Pandemic.,  2020)  concerns 
regarding the resultant impact on participant experience and the quality 
of  service  provision  have  been  raised.  (Mark  et  al.,  2021;  Sugarman 
et  al.,  2021)  The  current  study  adds  to  a  growing  body  of  evidence 
(Galanter et al., 2022; Senreich et al., 2022; Timko et al., 2022) (but see 
also (Barrett and Murphy, 2021) that goes some way to allaying these 
concerns. 

Although 20 % of respondents in the current evaluation experienced 
technical difficulties, the majority still found the groups to be helpful. 

Participants  gained  knowledge  that  supported  recovery  and  many 
engaged in the seven-day plan, an important behaviour change strategy. 
These findings are promising since active engagement and coping skills 
represent important predictors of treatment outcome within face-to-face 
mutual-help groups. (Marcovitz et al., 2020; Kelly et al., 2009) Evalu-
ations  to  examine  the  contribution  of  online  mutual-help  groups  to 
participant recovery are needed. However, given that online treatment 
and  support  may  be  less  effective,  (Gentry  et  al.,  2019;  Jenkins- 
Guarnieri  et  al.,  2015)  and  less  suitable  for  certain  clinical  groups, 
(Bergman  and  Kelly,  2021)  clarifying  the  participant  and  contextual 
variables that influence the effectiveness of online mutual-help groups 
represents an important challenge for future research. 

This  study  also  provides  preliminary  evidence  in  support  of  the 
feasibility  of  delivering  SMART  Recovery  mutual-help  groups  online. 
SRAU  surpassed  its  project  target  and  established  a  total  of  126  new 
online  groups  in  12-months.  Prior  to  this  initiative,  only  six  online 
groups were available. Under pandemic conditions, SRAU worked with 
volunteers  and  third-party  service  providers  to  deliver  over  2700 
meetings  to  approximately  42,000  attendees.  In  the  subsequent  2- 
months,  at  a  time  when  face-to-face  service  provision  began  to 
resume, a further 500 meetings were delivered to over 8,000 attendees, 
with the average number of meetings delivered and attendees per month 
maintained.  Evidence  regarding  virtual  support  groups  for  addictive 
behaviours is limited, but promising. (Oesterle et al., 2020; Bergman and 
Kelly, 2021) Within the broader literature, evidence for the feasibility of 
online  service  provision  for  addictive  behaviours,  (Mark  et  al.,  2021; 
Molfenter et al., 2021) and the willingness of providers (Molfenter et al., 
2021;  Cantor  et  al.,  2021)  and  patients  (Sugarman  et  al.,  2021)  to 
engage with this mode of service delivery is growing. However, virtual 
delivery  of  groups  also  comes  with  a  range  of  practical  and  clinical 
challenges (e.g., connectivity, safety and size). (Sugarman et al., 2022; 
Sugarman et al., 2021) The impact of these challenges on the delivery, 
experience and effectiveness of online treatment and support is unclear. 
Further research is needed to understand how best to optimise online 
service provision for addictive behaviours. 

Our  findings  also  lend  insight  into  two  key  opportunities  for 
extending  the  reach  of  online  SMART  Recovery  mutual-help  groups. 
Firstly,  there  is  a  need  to  improve  access  for  priority  clinical  groups. 
(Institute,  2020)  This  includes  young  people,  older  people,  culturally 
and  linguistically  diverse  populations  and  people  identifying  as  gay, 
lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex. (Institute, 2020) Although we 
are  unable  to  comment  on  the  actual  number  of  people  within  these 

AddictiveBehaviors139(2023)1075776A.K. Beck et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

priority groups who attended an online meeting across the evaluation 
period,  consistent  with  published  Australian  data  from  face-to-face 
SMART  Recovery  meetings,  (Raftery  et  al.,  2019;  Beck  et  al.,  2021) 
the  majority  of  participants  who  completed  the  online  questionnaire 
identified with a binary gender, were aged between 35 and 54 and did 
not identify as Aboriginal and/ or Torres Strait Islander, suggesting a 
need  to  continue  actively  targeting  the  priority  clinical  groups  noted 
above.  Improved  understanding  of  how  best  to  address  the  support 
needs  of these individuals is  essential. (Kelly et al., 2021) World-first 
evidence to inform the cultural adaptation of SMART Recovery groups 
for Aboriginal and/ or Torres Strait Islander peoples is now available 
(Dale et al., 2021; Dale et al., 2021) and an evaluation of an adapted 
version of SMART Recovery informed by young people for young people 
is currently underway. Further research is needed to understand how 
these findings may also inform the delivery of online groups. 

Secondly,  to  maximise  access  and  accessibility  of  online  SMART 
Recovery groups, there is a need to understand and address barriers to 
online delivery. Based on the number of third-party providers delivering 
face-to-face  groups  pre-COVID,  and  the  number  subsequently  trained 
during the evaluation period, the 38 third-party providers who delivered 
online groups represents approximately half of those with the capacity 
to  do  so.  This  is  driven  in  part  by  the  number  of  organisations  who 
completed training during the evaluation but did not go on to deliver an 
online group. Provider attitudes (e.g. preference and comfort) play a key 
role  in  willingness  to  deliver  telehealth  services  for  addictive  behav-
iours. (Mark et al., 2021) Practical considerations, for example provider 
and patient access to adequate technology have also been implicated. 
(Bergman  and  Kelly,  2021)  Although  accessibility  issues  are  more 
challenging  to  overcome  (indeed,  one-fifth  of  survey  respondents 
encountered significant technical difficulties), ensuring that providers 
are well-equipped to handle the unique challenges of online group de-
livery  is  essential.  Drawing  from  the  face-to-face  training  literature, 
ongoing  supervision,  feedback  and  self-reflection  is  likely  to  be  key. 
(Schwalbe et al., 2014; Frank et al., 2020; Caron and Dozier, 2021) We 
also observed wide variation in the duration that each online group was 
implemented.  Although  we  can  speculate  that  changes  in  COVID-19 
restrictions  and  participant/  provider  preference  for  a  return  to  face- 
to-face service provision may have played a role in whether or not on-
line  groups  were  maintained,  further  evidence  is  needed.  To  help 
characterise the individual, provider and organisational characteristics 
that  may  influence  the  sustainability  of  online  groups,  qualitative 
evaluations informed by established implementation frameworks (e.g. 
the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research) (Schwebel 
and Orban, 2022) may be of benefit. 

3.1. Strengths and limitations 

A  key  strength  of  this  evaluation  is  the  use  of  an  established, 
evidence-based framework within the context of a real-world innovation 
in  service  delivery.  The  RE-AIM  (Glasgow  et  al.,  2019;  Glasgow  and 
Estabrooks,  2018)  framework  ensured  that  this  evaluation  was 
comprehensive  and  conducted  at  the  level  of  the  individual,  group, 
service provider and organisation. However, several limitations are also 
worth mentioning. Firstly, findings are largely based on Zoom data an-
alytics.  Although  this  provides  unique  insight  into  participant  use  of 
online groups, the number of attendees is derived from the number of 
log-ins and is therefore likely to be a slightly inflated estimate (e.g. due 
to people logging into the same group multiple times). As this data is 
stored in aggregate by Zoom, we are also unable to identify the number 
of unique attendees. Secondly, data pertaining to the characteristics and 
experience of participants are subject to bias. Findings are derived from 
a small subsample of people who self-selected to complete the online 
questionnaire.  Administration  of  the  questionnaire  at  the  end  of  the 
group also means that we did not capture the characteristics of those 
attendees who left early (and therefore may have been less satisfied with 
the  group).  The  majority  of  the  participants  also  completed  the 

questionnaire at the end of their first meeting, meaning we are unable to 
comment  on  whether  and  how  the  experience  and  characteristics  of 
participants may have changed across time. Thirdly, although it is not 
uncommon  to  use  self-reported  Likert  scale  questionnaires  as  a  prag-
matic index of effectiveness (e.g.), (Miller et al., 2021) these findings 
would  be  strengthened  via  the  use  of  standardised,  validated  in-
struments, for example by assessing quality of life and other participant 
reported  outcomes.  Recent  developments  in  routine  outcome  moni-
toring (Kelly et al., 2021; Beck et al., 2021; Kelly et al., 2020) may be of 
use. Finally, the design of this pragmatic evaluation is such that we are 
unable  to  draw  causal  inferences  regarding  the  increase  in  online 
mutual-help provision observed. 

3.2. Conclusions 

The current evaluation describes how SRAU scaled-up the delivery of 
online SMART Recovery mutual-help groups in response to the COVID- 
19 pandemic. SRAU worked alongside volunteers and a diverse range of 
third-party service providers to deliver online SMART Recovery groups 
to more than 50,000 attendees across the 14-month evaluation period. 
Testimony to the feasibility and acceptability of delivering mutual-help 
groups online, groups were well attended and evaluated favourably by 
participants. Efforts to maximise existing capacity within partner orga-
nisations, enhance engagement with priority client groups and identify 
and  address  the  training  and  support  needs  of  online  facilitators  are 
warranted. Together with the current evaluation, these findings can be 
used to ensure that SRAU is well positioned to continue delivering an 
important  and  accessible  support  option  to  a  diverse  range  of  people 
affected by addictive behaviours.
