Abstract

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), like other psychiatric disorders, represents an 
evolving construct that has been refined and developed over the past several decades in response to 
research into its clinical nature and structure. The clinical presentation and course of the disorder 
have been extensively characterised. Efficacious medication-based treatments are available and 
widely used, often alongside complementary psychosocial approaches. However, their 
effectiveness has been questioned because they might not address the broader clinical needs of 
many individuals with ADHD, especially over the longer term. Non-pharmacological approaches 
to treatment have proven less effective than previously thought, whereas scientific and clinical 
studies are starting to fundamentally challenge current conceptions of the causes of ADHD in 
ways that might have the potential to alter clinical approaches in the future. In view of this, we 
first provide an account of the diagnosis, epidemiology, and treatment of ADHD from the 
perspective of both the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
and the eleventh edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Second, we review the 
progress in our understanding of the causes and pathophysiology of ADHD on the basis of science 
over the past decade or so. Finally, using these discoveries, we explore some of the key challenges 
to both the current models and the treatment of ADHD, and the ways in which these findings can 
promote new perspectives.

Introduction

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), like other psychiatric syndromes, has been 
refined and developed over the past 50 years, from its first contemporary description in the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (second edition; DSM-II) as a

hyperkinetic reaction of childhood to its current inclusion in DSM-51 as a lifespan 
neurodevelopmental condition with specific criteria for children and adults, a change 
reflected in its counterpart, the International Classification of Diseases (11th revision; 
ICD-11).2 This process of diagnostic evolution has been the result of periodic review and 
reformulation shaped by both research and clinical drivers. From a research perspective, the 
ADHD diagnostic formulation can be considered a part of a larger working hypothesis about 
the nature and structure of the disorder.3 As such, this diagnostic formulation is tested 
against empirical evidence so that it represents an increasingly accurate approximation of 
nosological reality as reflected in established research findings. Because the primary purpose 
of diagnostic systems is to provide intuitive and implementable guides for clinical decision 
making, the threshold for diagnostic innovation is set high and the pace of diagnostic 
evolution has been incremental in nature.4 Furthermore, as diagnostic systems in psychiatry 
have adopted a descriptive or phenomenological approach, considerations of the underlying 
causes of ADHD have been excluded from this process of re-evaluation and refinement. 
However, this diagnostic framework might be set to change. Progress in the aetiology and 
pathophysiology of ADHD challenges our current ways of thinking about the condition, 
while raising the prospect of new and potentially more effective clinical approaches.

Developing a broader range of more effective clinical approaches for people with ADHD, 
through the use of scientific discoveries, represents an important goal for the field.

ADHD is a prevalent, impairing condition that is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric 
disorders and creates a substantial burden for the individual, their family, and the 
community.5 Medication-based treatment strategies have proven efficacious and cost-
effective in the short term and a number of compounds are available, recommended, and 
widely used.6,7 However, the long-term effectiveness of these treatments on key educational, 
vocational, and social outcomes remains uncertain.8,9 Furthermore, such effects are 
compounded by low adherence, especially after extended use in adolescence.10 These 
limitations are probably the result of both biological and psychosocial processes (eg, the 
build up of medication tolerance, ADHD-related stigma, and social resistance to 
medication).8,11 Clearly, there is a pressing need for better long-term treatments for ADHD. 
By changing the way the field thinks about the causes of ADHD, scientific progress might 
help stimulate the development of new strategies for increasing the effectiveness of current 
treatments or the evolution of new alternatives. This Seminar will explore the issue of long-
term treatment in three sections. The first section provides an account of the consensus about 
the clinical condition of ADHD, its diagnosis, epidemiology, developmental course, and 
treatment. The second section presents an up-to-date overview of ADHD science, focusing 
on advancements in aetiology and pathophysiology. The final section briefly explores how 
some of the most important scientific discoveries are beginning to challenge conceptions of 
ADHD in specific ways and examines the prospect that they will encourage new clinical 
perspectives and approaches.

Clinical consensus

Diagnosis

ADHD is a clinical diagnosis requiring a detailed evaluation of current and previous 
symptoms and functional impairment. A full family, gestational, and developmental history 
should be taken.12 The American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-5 defines ADHD in 
children (younger than age 17 years) as the presence of six or more symptoms in either the 
inattentive or hyperactive and impulsive domains, or both (panel 1). Fewer symptoms (ie, at 
least five symptoms in either domain) are required to meet the adult diagnostic criteria. The 
age of symptom onset was modified from before age 7 years in DSM-IV to before age 12 
years in DSM-5 to permit greater flexibility when diagnosing adults. Additionally, whereas 
DSM-IV divided ADHD into three subtypes on the basis of the predominant 
symptomatology (inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive, or combined), DSM-5 replaced the 
term “subtype” with “presentation” to emphasise that symptom clusters can change as 
patients mature and develop.14 The ICD has updated its diagnostic formulation to bring it 
into line with DSM-5, moving ADHD from the disruptive to the neurodevelopmental 
disorder domain, exchanging the label hyperkinetic disorder with ADHD, and including 
inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive presentations of symptoms.15 Distinct from DSM-5 
and ICD-10, ICD-11 describes the essential features of the disorder, without giving a precise 
age of onset, duration, or number of symptoms.15 We reviewed the diagnostic challenges, 
common comorbidities, and the role of neuropsychological tests (appendix pp 1–3).

Although ADHD is chronic in nature, and treatment is typically provided over several years, 
the course of the disorder can vary from one patient to the next. Longitudinal studies suggest 
the possibility of at least four developmental trajectories: early onset (preschool ADHD [3–5 
years]), middle childhood (6–14 years) onset with a persistent course, middle childhood 
onset with adolescent offset, and adolescent or adult onset (16 years and older).16–18 
Treatment approaches and particular medications overlap substantially across these 
trajectories (as we discuss later), but prognosis might differ and understanding these disease 
courses might aid in treatment planning (eg, whether a child with ADHD no longer needs 
medication when they reach adolescence). Efforts are underway to predict the onset and 
course of ADHD across the lifespan. For example, on the basis of four longitudinal cohorts, 
Caye and colleagues19 developed a risk calculator of childhood characteristics, such as 
intelligence quotient (IQ) and childhood maltreatment, that collectively estimates risk for 
adult ADHD. Establishing of robust predictors of clinical course would aid treatment 
decisions, informing, for instance, the duration of interventions and periods of elevated risk.

Epidemiology

Accurately estimating the number of individuals affected by ADHD in a population is 
essential to health service planning. This estimate allows the burden associated with the 
disorder to be approximated and then the required investment to be made. Furthermore, 
accurate epidemiological data across time and countries can help test the validity of the 
ADHD diagnosis, and might provide indications about its causes and pathophysiology.20 
Initial studies in the 1970s and 1980s provided a wide range of prevalence estimates, which, 
when interpreted in the context of the rapidly increasing number of children treated with

medication at the time, raised societal concerns about inconsistent and excessive diagnosis. 
These studies also created disputes about the validity of the diagnosis. Some suggested the 
disorder was nothing more than a cultural product of competitive developed societies, its 
increasing use spurred on by the influence of the pharmaceutical industries trying to build 
market share. Meta-analytic studies investigating the factors responsible for this variability 
in prevalence were important in resolving such disputes. Two studies were especially 
influential and aggregated 102 studies21 (and then an additional 41 studies)20 involving 
community samples of children and adolescents from 35 countries in six continents 
worldwide and estimated the prevalence of ADHD as 5·29% (95% CI 5·01–5·56).21 Follow-
up meta-regression analyses indicated that the variability in previously reported ADHD 
prevalence was, in fact, attributable to methodological differences between studies, 
specifically in the diagnostic criteria, sources of information, and the requirement of 
functional impairment for diagnosis factors that varied between regions and countries.21,22 
Point prevalence from Europe, Oceania, South America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East 
did not differ from those from North America, nor did the prevalence change across time 
from 1985 to 2012.21,22 These data suggest that ADHD prevalence worldwide is stable when 
study methods are consistent. In general, studies done in the same populations with 
equivalent rating scales do not detect temporal changes in the number or severity of 
symptoms,23 supporting the meta-analytical data, with only some studies pointing to 
decreasing24 and fewer to increasing rates of subthreshold symptoms.25

Meta-analyses have estimated the prevalence of ADHD in adults aged 19–45 years at 2·5% 
(95% CI 2·1–3·1).26 Longitudinal studies following clinical samples of children with ADHD 
document a general decline of symptoms; meta-analytic data estimate that 15% of patients 
will persist with full diagnostic criteria in adulthood and 40–60% of patients will be 
classified as partial remitters.27 Prevalence in adults is higher than would be expected by the 
persistence rates from children, suggesting the emergence of new cases during development. 
In fact, studies of prospectively followed up, representative community samples showed the 
emergence of ADHD during adolescence and adulthood, indicating a new developmental 
subtype of the disorder,28 a finding discussed further in subsequent sections of this Seminar.

ADHD seldom affects only one functional domain but impacts many aspects of an 
individual’s wellbeing, including physical health, and academic, social, and occupational 
functioning. Often arising in childhood, ADHD can also be chronic in nature, frequently 
continuing through adolescence and beyond, at least at the level of impairment. Evaluation 
of treatment outcomes therefore should incorporate multiple components, such as 
psychoeducation, learning and academic support, school accommodation, intervention for 
management of symptoms, parental practices, and assessment and treatment of associated 
disorders. Treatment approaches are also likely to evolve as a patient matures. For example, 
parental practices have a large role in the treatment of a child aged 6–12 years, whereas 
psychoeducation regarding the risk of substance abuse and motor vehicle accidents becomes 
more central when a patient reaches adolescence. In our proceeding discussion of different 
approaches to managing ADHD, the degree of unmet clinical need in many countries where

Medication

only a small percentage of individuals with the condition receive any treatment should be 
acknowledged.29

With respect to the management of ADHD symptoms, US,30 Canadian,31 Latin American,32 
and European33 medical organisations all recommend the use of psychostimulant 
medications. Many of these ADHD resources and guidelines can be found online.33,34 
However, most of these organisations recommend beginning with psychoeducation and 
behavioural management, particularly for individuals with mild symptoms and impairment.
6,35 US guidelines differ and suggest that medication is considered with initial treatment.30 
For children younger than 6 years old, there is consensus that treatment should start with 
behaviour management in the form of parent training and that medication should be reserved 
for more severe or unresponsive cases. The National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) guidelines,33 for example, recommend that medication management for 
children younger than 5 years be considered only when parent training has been attempted 
and a second opinion has been obtained from a provider with expertise in ADHD in young 
children.

Medications for ADHD are categorised into stimulants (or psychostimulants) and non-
stimulants, with several different formulations, delivery systems, and pharmacokinetic 
profiles available (table). Importantly, the availability of medications varies worldwide, with 
very few options accessible in some countries.

First used in children in the 1930s, psychostimulants continue to be first-line medications for 
management of ADHD symptoms and consist of formulations of methylphenidate and 
amphetamine. Mechanisms of action for both are similar. Methylphenidate blocks 
presynaptic dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, thereby increasing catecholamine 
transmission; amphetamine also inhibits both transporters, but additionally increases the 
presynaptic efflux of dopamine.36 The efficacy of psychostimulants in reducing ADHD 
symptoms in short-term treatment has been shown in numerous clinical trials of both 
children and adults with ADHD. For instance, a meta-analysis including more than 10000 
children and adolescents (with trials lasting approximately 3 months) found that 
methylphenidate and amphetamine both had moderate-to-large effect sizes when symptom 
change was rated by clinicians (SD for methylphenidate 0·78; SD for amphetamine 1·02) 
and teachers (SD for methylphenidate 0·82; data not available for amphetamine).37 A meta-
analysis of 18 studies suggested that methylphenidate is also efficacious in adults, with an 
effect size of 0·6 based on self-reported and clinician-reported symptom change.38 
Moreover, another meta-analysis encompassing more than 8000 adult participants showed 
moderate effect sizes for both methylphenidate (0·49) and amphetamine (0·79).37 An 
additional meta-analysis of children with ADHD across 22 trials and adolescents with 
ADHD across nine trials compared methylphenidate and amphetamine and found both 
interventions highly efficacious, with slightly larger effects sizes for amphetamine (0·99) 
relative to methylphenidate (0·72).39 The side-effect profiles of these drugs are similar, with 
the most common side-effects being appetite suppression, insomnia, dry mouth, and nausea, 
but amphetamine might be somewhat more prone to side-effects.40 Side-effects are generally

similar for adults and children, but might be more common in young children (ie, aged 5 
years and younger).41 NICE guidelines33 recommend that medication treatment should 
begin with methylphenidate for children older than 5 years, but to then switch to 
amphetamine if the response is inadequate. For adults aged 18 years and older, the NICE 
guidelines recommend starting with either methylphenidate or the amphetamine 
formulation, lisdexamfetamine.

Three additional areas of concern with stimulant medications merit further consideration. 
First, there are the effects of long-term stimulant treatment on growth, specifically height 
and weight velocity. Although studies have yielded mixed results, most suggest that 
consistent stimulant use over several years can affect growth trajectories.42,43 Based on 
childhood growth models, consistent long-term stimulant use might lead to modest 
reductions in adulthood height (approximately 1–3 cm), but more substantial increases of 
weight and body-mass index (although initial treatment can cause modest weight loss).41 
These effects, however, are potentially attenuated by introducing so-called drug holidays (eg, 
not taking medication over holiday periods or summers) and are arguably outweighed by the 
benefits of treatment.44,45 Second, given the potential euphorigenic effects of stimulants, 
concern that stimulant use might increase the likelihood of subsequent substance abuse and 
dependence has been considerable.46 However, this concern is not reflected in longitudinal 
research as studies have either suggested that stimulant use has no effect on, or can even 
lower, substance abuse risk.46–48 In many developed countries, stimulant diversion is a 
related concern, by which individuals without ADHD acquire stimulants, often with the goal 
of increasing academic or vacation productivity.49 Further research is needed to understand 
the prevalence and impact of such use. Finally, a third concern is that stimulants, with their 
sympathomimetic properties, increase the likelihood of cardiovascular events. Although 
initial research from small, retrospective samples indicated the presence of associations 
between stimulant use and sudden cardiac death,49 large scale registry studies have generally 
been reassuring, showing no relationship between serious cardiovascular events and 
stimulant use.51,52

Relative to stimulants, non-stimulant medications have lower responses and effect sizes and 
thus are typically reserved for patients who respond poorly or have intolerable side-effects to 
trials of stimulant formulations. Non-stimulant medications include the norepinephrine 
transporter inhibitor, atomoxetine, and the α-2 agonists, guanfacine and clonidine (table). 
Most treatment guidelines deem non-stimulant medications second-line treatments to be 
considered if treatment with stimulants proves inadequate. NICE guidelines,33 for example, 
suggest that children with ADHD are switched to atomoxetine or guanfacine if their 
response to methylphenidate or amphetamine is poor; for adults, the recommendation is to 
switch to atomoxetine, as there is less evidence for α-2 agonists in adult ADHD.

A meta-analysis of 25 trials of atomoxetine in children with ADHD indicated a moderate 
effect size (SD 0·64); however, a large portion of patients (approximately 40%) had 
persistent symptoms requiring additional clinical intervention.53 Atomoxetine is also 
effective in adults, albeit with a more modest effect size (approximately 0·33) based on a 
meta-analysis of 12 trials.54 Trials of long-acting α-2 agonist formulations (extended-release 
guanfacine and extended-release clonidine) in children indicated medium effect sizes (0·5–

0·6).55,56 These formulations are often used as adjuvants to stimulants in patients with 
inadequate response to monotherapy, or in patients with comorbid aggression, insomnia, or 
tic disorders.57 A clinical trial of extended-release guanfacine suggested similar effect sizes 
for adults with ADHD, but additional research is still needed to confirm these results.58 In 
summary, the efficacy of ADHD medications has been clearly shown in the short term, with 
effect sizes and side-effects generally similar for adults and children. However, non-
medication interventions do often differ between the age groups. Cognitive behavioural 
therapy and occupational coaching have a more substantial role in adult management, 
whereas home-based and school-based behavioural treatments are recommended for 
children (as we discuss later).

In the context of well controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs), medications 
undoubtedly show short-term efficacy; however, their more general clinical value has been 
questioned. For example, once out of the rigorous context of an RCT, adherence is generally 
low, especially in adolescence, which undermines the practical effectiveness of medication 
treatments.59 Long-term, naturalistic follow-up studies also cast doubt on the persistence of 
treatment effects, perhaps because of the development of tolerance with chronic dosing.60 
Taking academic-related outcomes as an example, a meta-analysis including 34 trials found 
that methylphenidate had only small and inconsistent effects on academic performance, 
improving general productivity, and accuracy in mathematics, but not reading.61 
Furthermore, in a sample of 370 children with ADHD followed up prospectively, stimulants 
were observed to have no effect on the number of school dropouts.62 Similarly, in an 8-year, 
naturalistic follow-up of the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD (MTA) study,8 null effects of 
psychostimulant treatment were reported across several functional domains, including 
academic achievement, social function, and overall levels of impairment. Findings from 
national registries have been more encouraging. For example, a Swedish registry found a 
substantial lowering of criminality during periods of stimulant use,63 a US-based insurance 
registry described a reduction in motor vehicle accidents,64 and a Taiwanese registry 
suggested a lowering of depression risk.65 Additional positive effects on shorter-term 
outcomes such as traumas and injuries notwithstanding,66 long-term functional outcomes are 
an essential area for further attention in the clinical management of ADHD.

The limitations of medication treatment for ADHD highlight the importance of the 
continued search for new and improved approaches to its management. In this regard, 
several new compounds are being explored. For example, the association between ADHD 
and de novo mutations in genes related to the expression of metabotropic glutamate 
receptors67 has led to trials of glutamate modulators (eg, fasoracetam) in children with 
ADHD.68 Trials are also underway to examine the effects of agents targeting nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptors, because of the putative role of acetylcholine in regulating arousal 
and attention.69 Small studies of transdermal nicotine in adults and children with ADHD 
have shown promising initial results, but still require confirmation with larger RCTs.70,71

Psychosocial and non-pharmacological approaches

Non-pharmacological approaches have either been adapted from other clinical areas or 
newly developed to complement medication treatment, and are recommended as part of the

multimodal approach.33 Access to effective non-pharmacological approaches is especially 
important for children aged 3–5 years for whom medication is not recommended, when 
there is a preference against medication expressed by families, or when there is resistance to 
medication use from clinicians and national organisations.29 The MTA72 study has provided 
important evidence about the value of generic psychosocial treatments when applied to 
ADHD. The MTA was a US-based, multisite study of young children aged 7–9·9 years with 
ADHD that allowed for comorbid conditions other than bipolar, autism, or psychosis, as 
long as the comorbidity did not require treatment incompatible with the study treatments. 
The MTA study found that treatment with either methylphenidate alone or in combination 
with psychosocial treatment (including home-based and school-based behavioural treatments 
and a summer school-based treatment) provided similar effects on ADHD symptoms after 
14 months. However, combined treatment was superior to methylphenidate alone in 
improving some other functional outcomes, such as academic performance, parent–child 
relations, and social skills.72 Analogous findings from other studies have led to 
recommendations that combined treatment (a stimulant and parent training) is preferable to 
medication alone for most children with ADHD.35 Conversely, the benefits of parent 
training as the sole intervention are less clear. One meta-analysis suggested that symptom 
improvement with parent training is minimal when assessments are based on raters probably 
masked to treatment allocation (eg, teachers).73 Similarly, neurofeedback, another popular 
non-pharmacological intervention, has shown promise in single arm or uncontrolled studies, 
but the effects do not separate from placebo with rigorous placebo control (eg, mock or 
sham neurofeedback) and masked raters.74 Attentional and executive functioning training 
with interactive computer games (eg, Cogmed Working Memory Training) produces robust 
performance improvements on the training tasks.75 However, the translation of these effects 
to improvements in ADHD symptoms has not been replicated,75,76 despite promising 
findings from initial studies.77 Placebo-controlled trials of dietary treatments (such as the 
exclusion of additives or supplements with free fatty acids) have shown value;78 however, 
the effects are generally modest, although larger for exclusions when food intolerance is 
present. Interventions like physical exercise and meditation might have complementary 
benefits, but evidence for their short-term or long-term control of symptoms remains sparse.
79,80 Because of the equivocal effects of non-pharmacological interventions on ADHD 
symptoms to date, additional research is needed to show the efficacy of these interventions, 
and their combination, within the context of multimodal treatments.81

Scientific progress in understanding the causes of ADHD

Having reviewed the clinical consensus about ADHD as represented in DSM-5 and ICD-11, 
we now provide an overview of scientific developments in our understanding of the 
pathogenesis, causes, and pathophysiology of ADHD. Through this overview, we want to 
convey the great strides made by researchers in understanding the disorder. These 
developments will create a platform for our exploration of the ways in which science is 
challenging our conceptions of ADHD and how these insights might stimulant new 
treatment approaches.

Aetiology

A more thorough review of the published literature on genetic influences in ADHD is 
provided in the appendix (pp 3–4) but, briefly, the heritability for ADHD is high and most 
estimates range between 70% and 80%.82 Genome-wide association studies have 
successfully identified 12 genome-wide significant risk loci, yet these associations account 
for approximately 22% of the disorder’s heritability (as discussed later). Studies have also 
shown enrichment of certain copy-number variants in ADHD,83,84 but these results require 
replication.

Numerous environmental exposures are associated with ADHD and have been suggested as 
putative causal factors. Nevertheless, given the complexity of the causal process (including 
the correlations between genetic and environmental exposures) and the reliance on 
observational (rather than experimental) study designs, most of these associations have yet 
to be shown as causal. In this context, many prenatal and perinatal risk factors, such as 
prematurity and low birthweight, have been more consistently associated with ADHD, with 
family studies suggesting that these effects cannot be explained by genetic confounding.
85–87 Intrauterine exposure to tobacco, and maternal stress and obesity during pregnancy, are 
also associated with ADHD, but they can be explained, at least in part, by confounding 
genetic factors.88 Evidence is inconclusive or insufficient in relation to intrauterine exposure 
to alcohol and drugs and prenatal and perinatal birth-related complications.

Postnatal factors and social determinants have also been implicated in ADHD. For instance, 
experimental evidence shows that exposure to artificial food colourings and flavourings 
increases the severity of ADHD symptoms, but the effects are small.89 The links between 
ADHD and exposure to pollutants and pesticides are largely correlational in nature. 
Innovative designs such as mendelian randomisation are starting to be used to test causal 
interpretations of these effects, albeit initial attempts have been disappointing.90 Although 
associations between ADHD and parenting style have been noted, they are likely to be due 
to an evocative gene–environment correlation whereby a child’s behaviour elicits harsh and 
unsupportive parenting, which leads to an escalation of problems and the development of 
coercive cycles within families.91 Evidence that supports social determinants of ADHD 
comes from a naturally created experiment: the adoption of children exposed, from soon 
after birth, to extreme deprivation in state institutions before the fall of the Communist 
regime in Romania in the late 1980s. Following on from earlier studies showing an 
association between institutional neglect and ADHD, Kennedy and colleagues92 reported a 
7-times increase in ADHD in individuals who had experienced more than 6 months of 
deprivation as children compared with those who experienced less than 6 months. The 
magnitude of this effect, combined with the strength of the design (contrasting those with 
more and less than 6 months deprivation), means that this result is unlikely to be attributable 
to pre-existing genetic or intrauterine risk.93 However, the severity of the adversity 
experienced by these children is an extraordinary, or rare, environmental variant and the 
effect of less extreme exposures on ADHD risk is not as clear.

The mismatch between twin-based estimates of ADHD heritability (approximately 70–80%) 
and the estimates of genetic contribution based on the aforementioned genome-wide 
association study (about 22%) challenges researchers to account for the approximate 50%

gap in the familial transmission of ADHD. Clearly, this gap cannot be explained by rare de 
novo mutations, which, by definition, are not inherited. To answer this question, some have 
looked to the study of gene–environment interactions. The plausibility of this hypothesis (ie, 
that gene–environment interactions account for the gap between heritability estimates and 
genetic contributions based on the genome-wide association study), in part, rests on the fact 
that the standard twin heritability model pools genetic main effects with gene–environment 
interactions into a single heritability term. To differentiate gene–environment interactions 
from genetic main effects, studies have combined specific risk alleles (mainly relating to 
neurotransmitter genes) and specific exposures (eg, social stressors such as intrauterine 
exposure to substances and psychosocial risk factors). Despite some studies finding 
suggestive results, to date convincing replications are absent.94 Another approach focuses on 
epigenetic modifications in individuals with ADHD. Although this approach cannot, by 
itself, account for missing heritability, it has so far indicated differential DNA methylation in 
genes related to monoaminergic and GABAergic systems, and also in genes involved in 
neurodevelopmental processes.95 However, partly because of their reliance on the harvesting 
of genetic material from peripheral tissues (which might not reflect changes in the brain), the 
actual extent to which these modifications are causal remains to be seen.96 To improve our 
understanding of gene–environment interactions, and presumably ADHD causality, large-
scale prospective studies such as the UK Biobank and the US-based ECHO and ABCD 
studies might prove helpful. These studies include biospecimens for genome-wide 
sequencing, detailed measures of phenotypic variance, and longitudinal assessments of 
environmental exposures, with adequate power to detect interactions and small effects. Over 
the next 5–10 years, we anticipate that these efforts will yield good results.

Pathophysiology

ADHD is associated with deficits across a range of cognitive domains (panel 2). Global 
cognitive effects, as reflected in IQ below population norms, are well documented,97 as are 
more circumscribed cognitive and motivational correlates. For example, laboratory studies 
have found replicated evidence of deficits in executive functions such as behavioural 
inhibition, working memory, set-shifting, and planning and organisation in groups of 
individuals with ADHD compared with non-affected controls.98,99 However, within such 
groups, the specific pattern of individual executive function impairment varies dramatically 
from one individual with ADHD to another. This variation means that, although some 
individuals will show a pervasive pattern of impairment across different executive functions, 
others will display profound impairment in a particular executive function (eg, working 
memory) but be unaffected in other areas (eg, the ability to inhibit). Some patients will show 
no executive function impairment at all. This further emphasises the importance of issues of 
heterogeneity for current conceptions of ADHD.100,101 Moreover, deficits in executive 
functions are by no means specific to ADHD and are similarly reported in many other 
psychiatric conditions.102–104

Other cognitive domains, separable from (although potentially interacting with) executive 
functions, have also been implicated in ADHD. These include difficulties in regulating one’s 
psychological state in response to changing environmental circumstances by, for instance, 
trying to moderate one’s degree of arousal (so-called cognitive energetic factors). Clinically,

this means that ADHD symptoms are exacerbated during lengthy and seemingly mundane 
tasks.105 Furthermore, some people with ADHD show altered patterns of motivation106 and 
respond differently to positive and negative reinforcement.107,108 In this regard, difficulties 
in delaying gratification or waiting for important outcomes are motivational hallmarks for 
many with ADHD. These could be the result of either an inability to curb behavioural urges 
(ie, behavioural inhibition), or atypical responses to the expectation of future rewards, which 
often present as a heighted aversion to delay.109 Once again, there is great heterogeneity in 
the expression of these motivational and cognitive impairments.100

By highlighting the context-specific and dynamic nature of cognitive deficits in ADHD, the 
growing evidence of cognitive–energetic and motivational problems in ADHD has changed 
the way the pathophysiology of ADHD is considered. An especially important emergence 
has been the idea that ADHD is not always the result of a fixed deficit that affects 
performance across all settings, but rather it varies considerably from setting to setting.
110,111 For instance, ADHD symptoms and associated cognitive problems are much more 
common on tasks that are long and repetitive (with a low amount of stimulation) than they 
are on interesting tasks, in which there are frequent and engaging things happening. The 
most robust laboratory indication of the power of context, or setting, to shape the 
performance of people with ADHD is seen in how reaction time and accuracy change as the 
rate of stimulus presentation is varied. Patients with ADHD make more mistakes than 
controls only under very fast and very slow conditions.112

Regarding brain structure and function, findings from neuroimaging research complement 
the cognitive and motivational profiles associated with ADHD. Because of its important role 
in executive functions, early neuroimaging research focused principally on the prefrontal 
cortex, showing functional and maturational abnormalities associated with ADHD.113,114 
For example, youth with ADHD show on average a 2–3 year delay in reaching peak 
thickness of much of the cerebrum, including the prefrontal cortex.115 Over the last decade, 
neuroimaging research in ADHD, along with other psychiatric disorders, has shifted its 
focus of inquiry away from discrete neural substrates and towards the role of distributed 
neural circuits, recognising the importance of understanding the function, organisation, and 
development of interacting brain regions.116 Emerging from this work, several large neural 
networks have been implicated in ADHD, including the default mode network (DMN), 
dorsal and ventral attentional networks, salience networks, and frontostriatal and 
mesocorticolimbic circuits (or the dopaminergic meso- limbic system).5 Functional 
neuroimaging studies have shown reduced connectivity within the DMN of children aged 6–
17 years with ADHD and a pattern suggestive of delayed DMN neuromaturation,117 
consistent with earlier structural MRI studies pointing to delayed maturation of the cerebral 
cortex.115 The function of the DMN is hypothesised to underlie the normative capacity for 
mind-wandering and introspection, but in ADHD might reflect a tendency towards 
distractibility, potentially due to impaired regulation of attentional resources.118 Similar 
research highlights atypical interactions between the DMN and the dorsal and ventral 
attentional networks, and the salience network, suggesting that the DMN, and its 
relationship to mindwandering, might interfere with, or disrupt, attentional networks’ 
capacity to maintain externally, focused attention.5,118

In addition to the DMN and attentional networks, individuals with ADHD also manifest 
abnormalities within the dopaminergic mesolimbic system, a neural circuit associated with 
motivated behaviours, anticipated outcomes, and reinforced learning.98 For example, relative 
to healthy controls, individuals with ADHD show reduced volumes of the nucleus 
accumbens (a key node within the mesolimbic system),119,120 reduced activation of the 
mesolimbic system when anticipating rewarding outcomes,121 and reduced fractional 
anisotropy (a diffusion MRI indicator of white matter organisation) within white matter 
tracts of the mesolimbic system.122

Despite these advances in our understanding of the neurobiology of ADHD, several 
concerns persist. First, most neuroimaging studies of ADHD have been cross-sectional in 
design, and thus unable to reach causal interpretations. For example, adaptations to a 
disorder versus underlying causes cannot be disambiguated from cross-sectional, case-
control designs. Combining neuroimaging and RCTs is a potentially fruitful approach to 
overcome the limitations of correlational neuroimaging research, identifying causal effects 
of interventions (although not causal factors that give rise to the disorder itself) on brain 
structure and function.123 Second, neuroimaging studies of ADHD often have small samples 
and poor reproducibility. False findings might have arisen from inadequate control over 
multiple statistical comparisons, imaging confounds such as head motion and partial 
averaging, and inadequate clinical phenotyping (eg, relying solely upon parental reports for 
diagnostics). By contrast, one mega-regression analysis of structural MRI studies from more 
than 1700 youth with ADHD reported reduced volumes in multiple subcortical structures, 
including those associated with the aforementioned attentional and reward systems.120 
However, the effect sizes across all regions were small (Cohen’s d <0·2), highlighting the 
fact that many previous neuroimaging studies were underpowered and risked false-positive 
results. Finally, the small effect sizes reported by large mega-analyses, such as ENIGMA, 
suggest that neuroimaging is unlikely to have clinical use as a diagnostic tool, at least not 
until substantial methodological advances have been made.

What are the prospects for clinical advances in response to scientific 

advances?

In this final section, we briefly discuss four means by which scientific findings are 
challenging the way ADHD is conceptualised and explore the prospect that these can 
improve the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in the future.

Dimensionality

All evidence confirms that ADHD is best understood as the extreme end of a continuum and 
that people with ADHD differ from those without ADHD by degree rather than in kind. Yet, 
both DSM-5 and ICD-11 continue to operationalise ADHD as a categorical diagnosis: a 
syndrome defined by symptom thresholds that suggest the existence of discrete boundaries 
between health and disorder, and between unaffected and impaired. However, there is no 
evidence that this definition of ADHD is correct, and so current clinical boundaries are 
somewhat arbitrary, built on clinical experience about the number and severity of symptoms 
or degree of impairment that warrants intervention. Are there viable alternatives to the

current categorical models that better reflect the underlying reality of the condition? Despite 
concerns about clinical applicability, several different dimensional models have been 
proposed, but none have been judged to have the simplicity and immediacy of the current 
approaches.124

Heterogeneity

As aforementioned, science leaves us in no doubt that ADHD is a complex and 
heterogeneous disorder. Individuals with the condition differ from one another in myriad 
ways and at multiple levels, such as in their genetic risks, environmental exposures, brain 
structures, and cognitive and motivational profiles. Recognising that ADHD is a 
heterogeneous disorder presents appreciable challenges to researchers (studies designed to 
explore this heterogeneity require large samples, multiple measures that capture the full 
range of deficits, and the use of sophisticated multivariate analytical approaches), but also 
offer potential clinical opportunities. Acknowledging heterogeneity might lead to the 
adoption of precision medicine: the tailoring of treatments to target an individual’s 
underlying cognitive and brain processes.125 For instance, executive training might be 
efficacious for individuals with ADHD and executive dysfunctions, but not for those with 
motivational or cognitive energetic abnormalities. Neuropsychological subtyping of ADHD 
populations has been proposed to facilitate this sort of approach.98,125 However, progress is 
hampered by a lack of consensus regarding the pathophysiological dimensions of greatest 
clinical relevance and whether individuals cluster along these dimensions to form 
identifiable subgroups. Addressing the challenges of heterogeneity is central to the Research 
Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative of the US-based National Institute of Mental Health.

Development

ADHD is a lifespan disorder with roots in early childhood126 and branches extending into 
adolescence and adulthood.127 We’ve previously highlighted evidence that several different 
developmental forms of ADHD appear to exist, which are currently not distinguished in 
diagnostic approaches. The developmental core of the ADHD phenotype will remain marked 
by childhood onset and adulthood persistence, but four developmental types with potential 
clinical relevance are starting to emerge. However, much still needs to be learned about 
differential prognosis or treatment response of individuals with these distinct developmental 
phenotypes. Taking a developmental perspective focuses attention on the likely value of 
early intervention and prevention strategies.128 Interventions aimed at delaying the initial 
onset or reducing the impact of ADHD continue to be hindered by a lack of understanding 
of the early cognitive and behavioural precursors and predictors of later ADHD that would 
allow for the cost-effective early identification of at-risk individuals.129 We are also devoid 
of effective interventions that can be implemented during the first years of life, although 
novel approaches to strengthening underlying brain networks are being trialled.130 
Additional strategies, aimed at reducing the escalation and effect of the disorder, have 
effectively focused on the use of parent training, psychoeducation, and support to reduce the 
risk of emergence of comorbid conditions and associated impairment.131

Overlapping causes

Page 14

Our Seminar highlights a surprising degree of overlap between ADHD and other psychiatric 
conditions in terms of both aetiology and pathophysiology. This overlap, like evidence of 
dimensionality and heterogeneity, challenges current diagnostic systems, and lends 
conceptual support for approaches that attempt to identify common pathophysiological 
processes that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries (eg, RDoC initiative), rather than 
those that diverge at the level of the clinical DSM or ICD phenotypes.132 The assumption of 
a transdiagnostic framework, such as RDoC, is that shared vulnerability processes can be 
successfully targeted to treat different clinical conditions. For example, where similar 
executive deficits are present across a range of different neurodevelopmental conditions 
(ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, and psychosis), the same executive control training 
approaches could have clinical value.133 Similarly, a transdiagnostic framework might 
provide some insight into why causal factors can give rise to ADHD, and other psychiatric 
conditions. For instance, gestational diabetes is associated with increased risk for ADHD in 
the offspring.134 Although genetic confounding has not been excluded, preclinical research 
suggests that this observation might be attributable, at least in part, to the effects of maternal 
hyperinsulinaemia or adiposity on the development of the fetal mesolimbic system.135,136 
One could therefore hypothesise that this same prenatal exposure has transdiagnostic 
implications, increasing risk for other conditions related to mesolimbic dysfunction, such as 
Tourette’s syndrome and substance use disorders.135,137 However, to date, evidence 
supporting treatment or causal implications of a transdiagnostic framework is largely absent.

Conclusions

ADHD is a common, highly heritable, and impairing condition. Efficacious treatments are 
available but limited in many ways. We believe that the enormous strides made over the past 
10 years by scientists in understanding the nature and causes of ADHD challenge accepted 
models of ADHD and might have the potential to encourage new clinical improvement. 
However, this advancement will take both time and considerable investment to identify the 
specific processes and systems to target, develop new and innovative interventions to target 
these processes, and discover the best ways to tailor them to a patient’s individual needs.

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched PubMed for articles published between Jan 1, 1980, and March 1, 2019, 
with an emphasis on the previous 10 years. English and non-English language 
publications were considered in our search. We included primary and review articles 
resulting from these searches, along with relevant references cited within those articles. 
Given the broad scope, yet restricted space, of our review, we occasionally cite review 
papers in place of primary reports. We used the search terms: [ISP check]“ADHD”, 
“neurobiolog*”, “neural circuits”, “brain imaging”, “genetics”, “endophenotypes”, 
“impulsivity”, and “psychostimulant”.

Panel 1:

Criteria for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder

The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
criteria

Inattention

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Often cannot give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in 
schoolwork, at work, or with other activities

Often has trouble holding attention on tasks or play activities

Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly

Often does not follow through on instructions and does not finish schoolwork, 
chores, or duties in the workplace (eg, loses focus, or is side-tracked)

Often has trouble organising tasks and activities

Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to do tasks that require mental effort 
over a long period of time (such as schoolwork or homework)

Often loses things necessary for tasks and activities (eg, school materials, 
pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, and mobile 
telephones)

Is often easily distracted

Is often forgetful in daily activities

Hyperactivity and impulsivity

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat

Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected

Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is not appropriate 
(adolescents or adults might be limited to feeling restless)

Often unable to play or take part in leisure activities quietly

Is often “on the go” or acting as if “driven by a motor”

Often talks excessively

Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed

Often has trouble waiting their turn

Often interrupts or intrudes on others (eg, conversations or games)

The eleventh edition of the International Classification of Diseases criteria

•

•

Persistent pattern (at least 6 months) of inattention,* hyperactivity-
impulsivity,* or both

Onset typically in early to mid-childhood

Panel 2:

Cognitive domains associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder

•

•

•

•

•

•

Arousal: preparedness for action or behavioural activation

Executive functions: a broad range of higher-order cognitive processes, 
including decision making, planning, and working memory

Behavioural inhibition: capacity to restrain one response, or urge, in favour of 
another, often more automatic, response

Motivation: pursuing outcomes of potential value on the basis of subjective 
determinations

Set shifting: changing behavioural patterns to meet new environmental 
demands (eg, adjusting to new rules or expectations)

Working memory: short-term memory that allows for mental operation of 
information (eg, mental arithmetic) and often considered one type of 
executive function
