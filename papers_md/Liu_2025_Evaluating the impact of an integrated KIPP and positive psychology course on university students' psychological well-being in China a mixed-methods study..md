Introduction: This study evaluated the impact of an integrated general education 
course—Building a Flourishing Life: Integrating KIPP and Positive Psychology—
on  the  psychological  well-being  of  university  students  in  China.  Drawing  on 
the  dual  frameworks  of  the  Knowledge  is  Power  Program  (KIPP)  and  the  VIA 
character strengths model, the intervention aimed to promote happiness and 
reduce depression and anxiety.
Methods:  Using  a  mixed-methods  approach,  we  collected  pre-  and  post-
intervention survey data (N = 116), performed fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative 
Analysis  (fsQCA)  to  identify  configurational  pathways,  and  applied  directed 
content analysis to qualitative interview responses.
Results:  Quantitative  results  showed  significant  increases  in  happiness  and 
decreases  in  depression  and  anxiety,  which  highlighted  the  additive  and 
substitutive  roles  of  strengths-based  practices.  Qualitative  findings  reinforced 
these  outcomes.  The  fsQCA  findings  showed  that  no  single  module  was 
necessary for the observed improvements in psychological well-being. Instead, 
multiple combinations of modules functioned synergistically.
Conclusion:  This  study  contributes  to  the  growing  literature  on  culturally 
responsive  positive  education  and  addresses  recent  critiques  regarding  the 
contextualization of psychological interventions in higher education.

1 Introduction

Mental health issues among Chinese students have become a significant concern in recent 
years. A meta-analysis of 113 studies has demonstrated a high prevalence of depression in this 
population, estimated at 28.4% (Gao et al., 2020). These challenges are often exacerbated by 
academic pressure, social expectations, and the complexities of transitioning to adulthood, 
highlighting the urgent need for effective interventions to enhance psychological well-being. 
In response, the integration of positive psychology into university curricula has emerged as a 
promising strategy. Globally, positive psychology principles have been increasingly applied in

educational settings, described as a “fast-developing area of research” 
(Shankland and Rosset, 2017). Large-scale initiatives across diverse 
countries  also  underscore  the  international  momentum  behind 
positive education (Seligman and Adler, 2018).

Positive  psychology,  pioneered  by  Seligman  and  Peterson, 
emphasizes the cultivation of strengths, resilience, and overall well-
being. As foundational figures in the field, Peterson and Seligman 
(2004) identified six core virtues—wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, 
temperance,  and  transcendence—operationalized  through  24 
culturally validated character strengths, which form the basis of the 
widely  used  Values  in  Action  (VIA)  Inventory  of  Strengths.  This 
framework has been extensively integrated into educational settings, 
from  early  childhood  programs  to  higher  education  curricula.  A 
notable application of the VIA framework is the Knowledge is Power 
Program  (KIPP),  a  U.S.-based  public  charter  school  network  that 
emphasizes seven key character strengths—curiosity, gratitude, self-
regulation, grit, social intelligence, optimism, and zest (Lester, 2024). 
Building on the principles of positive psychology, KIPP is a structured 
character education model that operationalizes these traits through 
embedded  school  practices,  including  the  widely  used  Character 
Report  Card  (Duckworth,  2009).  This  model  translates  abstract 
constructs  into  observable  behaviors  and  provides  a  practical 
framework for evaluating and supporting student growth.

The effectiveness of KIPP has been demonstrated in large-scale 
studies. A randomized controlled trial of over 2,000 students found that 
attending KIPP middle and high schools substantially increased college 
enrollment and graduation rates, closing gaps for Black and Hispanic 
students in the U.S. (Demers et al., 2023). Further evidence from the 
2024 KIPP Impact Report showed that alumni graduate from college 
at three times the national average and benefit from mental health and 
career support (KIPP Foundation, 2024). International adaptations also 
show promise; for example, a Danish program inspired by KIPP and 
Seligman improved academic performance, motivation, and well-being 
among  at-risk  youth  (Andersen  et  al.,  2016).  Relatedly,  character 
strengths such as gratitude and optimism are consistently linked to 
greater happiness and lower distress across cultures (Nikoozadeh and 
Pirhayati, 2023; Brito and Soares, 2023; Martínez-Martí et al., 2020).

interventions. 

Despite these successes, few studies have examined how structured 
strength-based interventions can be adapted for the Chinese university 
context. Chinese students often experience high levels of perfectionism, 
parental pressure, and stigmatization surrounding mental health help-
seeking  (Liu  et  al.,  2019;  Ning  et  al.,  2022).  Lambert  et  al.  (2023) 
emphasized the importance of culturally sensitive adaptations when 
applying  Western  psychological 
In  response, 
we developed a course titled Building a Flourishing Life: Integrating 
KIPP and Positive Psychology, designed as a general education elective 
for Chinese undergraduates. The course represents a novel integration 
of the VIA framework, which provides the theoretical foundation, and 
the KIPP model, which offers a behaviorally grounded approach to 
character education. This dual-framework approach aims to create a 
developmentally appropriate, culturally relevant, and pedagogically 
feasible  intervention  to  enhance  student  well-being.  The  course  is 
structured into five thematic modules: Strengthening Relationships, 
which focuses on fostering empathy, kindness, and social intelligence; 
Discovering Strengths, Self-Regulation, and Balance, designed to help 
students  identify  their  signature  strengths  and  develop  emotional 
regulation  skills;  Building  Resilience,  which  equips  students  with 
strategies to overcome adversity and persevere through challenges; 

Finding  Meaning  and  Joy  (Transcendence),  aimed  at  cultivating 
gratitude, hope, and a sense of purpose; and Integrating Strengths into 
Daily Life, which provides practical applications for using character 
strengths in academic, personal, and social contexts. By embedding 
KIPP’s seven key character strengths within the VIA framework, the 
course delivers a holistic and culturally grounded model for university 
student well-being.

While positive psychology interventions are increasingly used in 
educational contexts, the explicit integration of the KIPP character 
education model within a higher education course remains rare—
especially in the Chinese cultural setting. Therefore, this study adopts 
a mixed-methods design to evaluate the impact of the integrated KIPP 
and Positive Psychology course on the psychological well-being of 
university students in China. Quantitative data were collected using 
standardized measures of happiness, depression, and anxiety, while 
qualitative insights were derived from in-depth student interviews. To 
rigorously assess the course’s effectiveness, three analytical strategies 
were  employed:  pre-post  statistical  analysis,  fuzzy-set  Qualitative 
Comparative  Analysis  (fsQCA),  and  a  directed  content  analysis 
approach of qualitative data. To the best of our knowledge, no previous 
studies  have  employed  a  mixed-methods  approach  to  assess  the 
impact of such an integrated program in a Chinese university setting. 
This study not only contributes to the expanding body of literature on 
positive psychology’s application in higher education but also informs 
future initiatives aimed at addressing mental health challenges among 
university students in China. By bridging the gap between theory and 
practice, this research offers valuable insights into the potential of 
combining KIPP’s character education model with positive psychology 
to promote flourishing and resilience in university students.
The central research question guiding this study is:
RQ1:  How  does  the  course  influence  students’  psychological 

well-being?

Three hypotheses guide the quantitative analysis:

H1a: Students will report significantly higher happiness levels 

after completing the course.

H1b: Students will report significantly lower depression levels 

after completing the course.

H1c: Students will report significantly lower anxiety levels 

after completing the course.

To strengthen the coherence of the mixed-methods design, the 
fsQCA  component  is  framed  by  the  following  exploratory 
research question:

RQ2: Which combinations of course modules are associated with 
higher levels of happiness and lower levels of depression and anxiety 
among students who completed the course?

configurational  patterns—that 

The fsQCA, based on transformed quantitative data, aimed to 
uncover 
is,  how  different 
combinations of curricular modules are associated with psychological 
well-being. This exploratory approach is well suited for capturing 
complexity in educational contexts, where multiple pathways may 
be associated with similar mental health outcomes. It complements 
the variable-centered quantitative analysis by offering a system-level 
perspective on how course components interact to shape students’ 
well-being.

RQ3: How do students perceive the personal and psychological 
impact of the course, and what mechanisms do they identify as most

influential in fostering well-being? This question guided the thematic 
analysis, which allowed us to triangulate findings and offer culturally 
contextualized  interpretations  of  how  students  engaged  with  the 
course material and experienced its effects on their emotional lives.

In  this  study,  the  term  “KIPP-PP  integrated  course”  is  used 
consistently to denote the intervention. This terminology highlights 
the deliberate integration of VIA-based positive psychology, which 
provides the theoretical foundations of character strengths and well-
being, with the KIPP model, which offers practical and behaviorally 
grounded strategies for character development.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Participants

The study employed a longitudinal design to track changes in 
participants’ psychological well-being throughout the duration of the 
KIPP-PP integrated course at a large university in Southeastern China. 
The  pre-test  questionnaire  was  administered  during  the  first  class 
session in September 2024, while the post-test was conducted during 
the final class session in December 2025. This data collection strategy 
yielded a high response rate of 97% across both survey administrations. 
All surveys were conducted in person during regular class sessions, 
which were part of a required general education course. No material 
incentives  were  offered  for  participation;  however,  students  were 
informed that the surveys were part of the teaching evaluation process 
aimed at improving course quality and understanding student well-
being.  We  acknowledge  that  this  context  may  have  introduced 
response bias due to students’ perceived obligation to comply with 
academic requirements. To match pre- and post-course responses 
while protecting participants’ privacy, a self-generated identification 
code system was used. Each student was instructed to create a unique 
alphanumeric  code  based  on  a  combination  of  personal  but 
non-identifying cues (e.g., the first letter of their first name + birth 
month + last digit of their student number). This code was used solely 
for  data  matching  purposes  and  could  not  be  linked  back  to  the 
student’s  identity  by  the  researchers.  All  questionnaires  were 
completed  anonymously  in  person  during  class  sessions,  and  no 
names,  student  numbers,  or  other  identifying  information  were 
collected. Students were assured that their participation was voluntary, 
that their data would be kept confidential, and that their decision to 
participate or withdraw would have no impact on their course grades.

2.2 Intervention

The intervention consisted of the KIPP-PP integrated course. This 
15-week course (100 min per week) was designed to synergize the 
theoretical principles of the VIA-based positive psychology framework 
with the practice-oriented structure of KIPP. The integration of these 
frameworks aimed to provide students with both the mindset and 
practical strategies to enhance psychological well-being. The course 
was organized around five thematic modules, each targeting one or 
more of the following core outcomes: increasing happiness, reducing 
depression,  and  reducing  anxiety.  These  modules  were  not  only 
theoretically informed but also grounded in applied activities such as 

gratitude  journaling,  character  strength  reflection,  self-regulation 
training, and small-group discussions.

First,  the  Strengthening  Relationships  module  focused  on 
cultivating empathy, kindness, love, and social intelligence through 
various interpersonal activities such as group discussions, role-playing 
exercises, and collaborative projects. Students were encouraged to 
engage  in  exercises  where  they  practiced  active  listening,  shared 
personal  experiences,  and  provided  support  to  peers  in  building 
positive relationships. The module aimed to increase happiness by 
enhancing relational satisfaction and fostering emotional connections, 
especially beneficial for students struggling with social isolation or 
self-criticism. Additionally, the module worked to reduce depression 
and  anxiety  by  offering  emotional  support,  encouraging  healthy 
communication, and helping students develop trust and meaningful 
connections with others.

Second, the Discovering Strengths, Self-Regulation, and Balance 
module emphasized the identification of personal signature strengths 
(e.g., perseverance, emotional regulation, self-awareness) and their 
mindful  application  in  daily  life.  Activities  included  strength 
identification exercises, journaling prompts, self-reflection activities, 
and group discussions on how to utilize personal strengths. Students 
also participated in mindfulness meditation and cognitive reappraisal 
techniques, which helped them better manage stress and challenges. 
This module played a central role in reducing depression and anxiety 
by enhancing self-acceptance and providing students with tools for 
emotional regulation, while also contributing to increased happiness 
by fostering self-confidence, emotional growth, and a positive outlook 
on personal abilities.

Third, the Building Resilience module drew upon KIPP’s emphasis 
on grit and growth mindset, equipping students with coping strategies 
to face adversity and persevere through difficulties. Activities included 
reframing setbacks as opportunities, role-playing stressor responses, 
group problem-solving tasks, and personal storytelling where students 
shared challenges they had overcome. Students also engaged in goal-
setting workshops to track progress and stay motivated in the face of 
challenges. This module aimed to reduce both depression and anxiety 
by building psychological flexibility and fostering a future-oriented, 
optimistic outlook, empowering students to better handle setbacks in 
both academic and personal contexts.

Fourth, the Finding Meaning and Joy (Transcendence) module, 
drawing  from  VIA’s  transcendence  virtues  (e.g.,  hope,  gratitude, 
appreciation of beauty), utilized gratitude journaling, mindfulness 
exercises, purpose-oriented reflection, and group activities such as 
appreciation circles where students shared moments of gratitude with 
peers.  This  module  aimed  to  reduce  anxiety  and  depression  by 
cultivating inner calm and existential coherence, while simultaneously 
promoting increased happiness through the amplification of positive 
emotions like gratitude and joy. Students were also encouraged to 
engage in random acts of kindness and daily reflection on meaningful 
life  moments,  helping  them  appreciate  the  positive  aspects  of 
their lives.

Fifth, the Integrating Strengths into Daily Life module helped 
students translate learned character strengths into academic, social, 
and  personal  routines.  For  example,  students  practiced  applying 
perseverance during exam preparation and emotional awareness in 
managing relationships. The module involved interactive workshops 
on time management, stress reduction techniques, and goal-setting 
with a focus on leveraging character strengths in real-life situations.

This module supported all three psychological outcomes—happiness, 
depression, and anxiety—by reinforcing sustainable behavioral change 
and enhancing psychological self-efficacy. Students participated in 
peer support groups, where they shared their progress in applying 
character strengths and discussed challenges and successes. In sum, 
each module was designed to serve one or more of the psychological 
goals (increasing happiness, reducing depression, reducing anxiety) 
by  engaging  with  empirically  supported  character  strengths.  The 
structure was both holistic and adaptable, reflecting the course’s dual 
commitment to theoretical integrity and cultural relevance within the 
Chinese  higher  education  context.  A  detailed  mapping  of  course 
modules, activities, and associated VIA/KIPP virtues is provided in 
Supplementary Table 1.

2.3 Measures

2.3.1 Quantitative measures

Happiness  was  assessed  using 

the  Oxford  Happiness 
Questionnaire (OHQ) (Hills and Argyle, 2002), a well-established self-
report measure of subjective well-being. The OHQ comprises 28 items 
rated on a six-point Likert scale, with higher scores reflecting greater 
levels of happiness. The scale has demonstrated robust psychometric 
properties, including high internal consistency and strong construct 
validity  across  diverse  populations.  In  this  study,  the  OHQ  was 
administered both before and after the course to evaluate changes in 
participants’ happiness levels. One item, “There is a gap between what 
I want to do and what I have done,” was removed not merely due to 
statistical indicators, but because multiple participants during the pilot 
testing  and  informal  class  feedback  reported  that  its  wording  was 
vague and semantically ambiguous in the Chinese context. This item 
was considered culturally inappropriate and confusing, thus affecting 
the conceptual clarity of the scale. Empirically, the item showed a 
relatively weak factor loading and lower communality compared to 
other  items.  After  removal,  Cronbach’s  α  slightly  increased  (from 
0.9411  to  0.9443),  factor  loadings  became  cleaner,  and  item–total 
correlations improved, with all remaining items exceeding accepted 
thresholds.  These  results  suggest  that  the  adapted  OHQ  retained 
strong  reliability  and  improved  construct  validity  in  the  Chinese 
university student sample.

Depression was measured using Tung’s Depression Inventory for 
college  students,  a  self-report  tool  designed  to  assess  depressive 
symptoms (Lin et al., 2008). The original scale consisted of 32 items, 
with responses ranging from “never or extremely rare – less than one 
day”  (0)  to  “often  or  always  –  five  to  seven  days”  (3)  per  week. 
However, the item “I often space out” was perceived by students as 
unclear  and  not  representative  of  depression  symptoms  in  their 
everyday experience. Based on participant feedback and linguistic 
mismatch,  we  excluded  the 
item  to  enhance  the  cultural 
appropriateness of the scale. Specifically, the item showed the lowest 
communality (0.438) and a weaker item–total correlation (r = 0.369) 
compared  to  the  rest  of  the  scale  (most  >  0.55).  After  removal, 
Cronbach’s α increased from 0.951 to 0.953, factor loadings became 
clearer,  and  item–total  correlations  strengthened,  with  all  items 
demonstrating acceptable psychometric properties.

Anxiety was evaluated using the Burns Anxiety Inventory (Burns-
A), a 33-item self-report scale designed to measure the severity of 
anxiety symptoms (Burns, 1993). The inventory is divided into three 

subscales: anxious feelings (6 items), anxious thoughts (11 items), and 
physical symptoms (16 items). The anxious feelings subscale assesses 
emotional states such as nervousness, excessive worry, and fear. The 
anxious thoughts subscale evaluates cognitive patterns associated with 
anxiety,  including  difficulties  concentrating  and  fears  of  isolation, 
rejection, or losing control. The Physical Symptoms subscale captures 
somatic manifestations of anxiety, such as chest tightness, dizziness, 
muscle tension, and difficulty breathing. Participants rated each item 
based on the frequency of their experiences in recent days using a 
four-point Likert scale (0 = not at all, 3 = a lot). The anxiety inventory 
exhibited good internal consistency in this study, with a Cronbach’s α 
of 0.96.

2.3.2 fsQCA measures

First,  to  explore  the  configurational  pathways  linking  specific 
course components to psychological outcomes, we conducted fsQCA 
using  calibrated  post-intervention  data.  The  fsQCA  focused  on 
identifying  combinations  of  five  thematic  course  modules—
Strengthening Relationships, Discovering Strengths, Self-Regulation 
and  Balance,  Building  Resilience,  Finding  Meaning  and  Joy,  and 
Integrating Strengths into Daily Life—that were associated with high 
or low levels of happiness, depression, and anxiety.

Moreover, the three outcome variables were: Happiness (high vs. 
low): based on the post-test happiness scale, calibrated using the 75th 
percentile as the threshold for full membership (fuzzy score = 0.95), 
the 50th percentile for crossover (0.5), and the 25th percentile for full 
non-membership  (0.05).  Depression  and  Anxiety  (low  vs.  high): 
reverse calibrated to reflect low depression and low anxiety as desirable 
outcomes, using similar percentile thresholds.

2.3.3 Qualitative measures

For  the  qualitative  component,  semi-structured  interviews 
were conducted with all 116 students who completed both the 
pre-  and  post-course  questionnaires.  Interviews  took  place 
immediately after the completion of the course during the final 
class session in December 2025, ensuring that participants could 
reflect on their experiences while the content and its impact were 
still fresh, thereby minimizing recall bias. Each interview lasted 
approximately 45 min and was conducted in a private meeting 
room  on  the  university  campus  to  provide  a  comfortable  and 
confidential environment.

The interview guide was designed to explicitly probe the domains 
of happiness, depression, and anxiety to ensure alignment with the 
quantitative  outcomes.  Accordingly,  a  directed  content  analysis 
approach was employed. To ensure feasibility and quality, interviews 
were conducted by a team of ten trained research assistants, each with 
prior experience in qualitative interviewing. This structure enabled 
one-to-one interviews with all 116 participants within the available 
timeframe.  Each  assistant  was  assigned  approximately  11  to  12 
participants, allowing interviews to be completed in parallel while still 
ensuring depth and consistency. The research assistants followed a 
standardized  semi-structured  protocol,  and  all  interviews  lasted 
approximately 45 min. This team-based approach made it possible to 
achieve  full  coverage  of  the  sample  without  compromising  data 
quality. Interviews were audio-recorded with participant consent and 
later transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were anonymized, with only 
participant codes retained, and all qualitative data (audio files and 

Frontiers in Psychology

transcripts) were stored securely on a password-protected university 
server accessible only to the research team. A codebook detailing the 
coding process and theme definitions was maintained separately from 
the data to preserve confidentiality.

Ethical approval for the qualitative component was obtained from 
the  university’s  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB).  Participants 
provided informed consent, including agreement for audio recording 
and use of anonymized quotations in publications. For students aged 
18 and above, only their individual consent was required. However, 
because  the  course  included  some  first-year  students  who  were 
17 years old at the time of enrollment, parental or guardian consent 
was  additionally  obtained  for  these  underage  participants,  as 
mandated  by  the  university’s  IRB  guidelines.  Raw  data  (e.g., 
transcripts, recordings) will not be publicly shared, but anonymized 
transcripts  and  the  codebook  may  be  made  available  to  qualified 
researchers upon request, subject to ethical compliance.

Semi-structured 

interviews  explored  students’  subjective 
experiences  of  the  course.  The  interview  protocol  included  the 
following prompts: In what ways, if any, has your sense of happiness 
changed after taking this course? Can you describe any moments or 
activities in the course that helped you feel more emotionally uplifted? 
Have you noticed any changes in your feelings of anxiety, depression 
or happiness since participating in the course? Were there specific 
modules  or  practices  that  helped  you  cope  better  with  negative 
emotions  or  daily  challenges?  How  did  the  course  influence  your 
understanding or use of your personal strengths? Do you think the 
course content connected with your cultural background or personal 
values? Why or why not? These questions were anchored in the three 
core psychological targets of the course and guided a directed content 
analysis  guided  by  pre-specified  domains  (happiness,  depression, 
anxiety) of student reflections.

2.4 Data analysis

intervention, 

The present study adopted a mixed-methods approach to evaluate 
the  psychological  outcomes  of  the 
integrating 
quantitative analyses of pre-post changes with qualitative insights into 
students’ lived experiences. To ensure a comprehensive understanding 
of  the  intervention’s  effects,  a  triangulated  approach  was  used, 
integrating both quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative 
results, derived from pre-post surveys, identified significant changes 
in  students’  happiness,  depression,  and  anxiety.  The  fsQCA  and 
qualitative interviews, conducted after the quantitative data collection, 
provided  a  deeper  understanding  of  these  changes  by  capturing 
students’  personal  reflections  and  perceptions  of  the  course.  The 
qualitative phase used directed content analysis to elaborate how and 
why  changes  might  have  occurred,  treating 
interviews  as 
complementary evidence aligned to the three predefined outcomes 
rather than as fully inductive theme generation. We also coded and 
reported  disconfirming  evidence  (neutral,  mixed,  and  critical)  to 
reduce confirmation bias. Findings are framed as illustrative accounts 
within  these  domains.  This  integration  of  both  data  types  helped 
contextualize and explain the quantitative findings, offering a fuller 
picture of the intervention’s impact on students’ well-being.

The data collection was conducted sequentially. First, quantitative 
data  were  collected  through  pre-  and  post-test  surveys,  assessing 
happiness, depression, and anxiety before and after the course. These 

data  were  analyzed  using  paired-sample  t-tests.  Following  the 
quantitative  analysis,  fsQCA  and  qualitative  interviews  were 
conducted  with  all  participants  to  capture  their  reflections  on  the 
course. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis, allowing 
us to identify key themes related to the students’ experiences and 
perceived  outcomes.  By  conducting  qualitative  analysis  after  the 
quantitative analysis, we were able to provide further insight into the 
patterns  identified  in  the  quantitative  phase,  enriching  our 
understanding  of  how  specific  course  components  influenced 
students’ psychological well-being.

The qualitative component of this study was exploratory in nature, 
aimed at gaining in-depth insights into students’ lived experiences, 
perceptions, and reflections on the course. This qualitative approach 
served  to  complement  the  quantitative  data,  providing  a  more 
nuanced understanding of how the intervention influenced students’ 
psychological well-being. The qualitative interviews helped to explain 
the  patterns  observed  in  the  quantitative  analysis  and  provided 
additional  context  regarding  the  mechanisms  through  which  the 
course affected students’ happiness, depression, and anxiety.

2.4.1 Quantitative analysis

Paired-sample  t-tests  were  conducted  to  assess  within-subject 
changes in psychological well-being—namely, happiness, depression, 
and anxiety—across the intervention period. While these analyses 
provided estimates of average treatment effects at the group level, they 
did  not  capture  the  configurational  complexity  by  which  distinct 
combinations 
differentially 
of 
influence outcomes.

course  modules  might 

2.4.2 fsQCA analysis

To complement the variable-centered approach of paired-sample 
t-tests, we employed fsQCA to identify multiple, equifinal pathways 
through which course modules influenced students’ psychological 
outcomes. Unlike regression models, which assume linear and additive 
effects, fsQCA enables the exploration of configurational complexity 
by examining how different combinations of conditions are associated 
with similar results (Fiss, 2011; Greckhamer et al., 2018).

Although our sample size (N = 116) may appear modest, it is well 
within the suitable range for fsQCA applications. While the method 
was originally developed for small and intermediate samples (<50), 
recent systematic reviews have demonstrated its application across a 
wide  spectrum  of  sample  sizes,  including  studies  with  several 
thousand cases, underscoring its methodological flexibility (Geremew 
et al., 2024). Importantly, fsQCA has been increasingly applied in 
educational  research  to  uncover  multiple  equifinal  pathways  to 
outcomes, such as in studies of classroom silence (Chen N. C. et al., 
2025) and teachers’ adoption of digital learning tools (Chen J. et al., 
2025). These precedents reinforce the appropriateness of fsQCA for 
our evaluation of a multi-component university course.

In  our  mixed-methods  evaluation  of  the  KIPP-PP  integrated 
course—which  comprises  five  interactive  modules—fsQCA  was 
particularly  valuable  for  capturing  the  nuanced  ways  in  which 
different  module  combinations  fostered  well-being  across  student 
subgroups. This configurational insight complements the aggregate-
level changes identified through t-tests and enriches understanding of 
how course components collectively are associated with psychological 
outcomes. Notably, while many studies use fsQCA as a stand-alone 
method, our design integrates fsQCA alongside pre–post quantitative

analysis and qualitative thematic analysis. This triangulated approach 
strengthens validity by linking statistical evidence of improvement, 
configurational  pathways  of  module  engagement,  and  students’ 
lived experiences.

The fsQCA was conducted on calibrated post-test data. Condition 
variables reflected participation in each of the five modules (coded as 
1 = full engagement, 0 = limited or no engagement) based on both 
instructor  attendance  records  and  student  self-reports.  Outcome 
variables—happiness,  depression,  and  anxiety—were  transformed 
into fuzzy sets using the direct calibration method (Ragin, 2008), with 
anchors at 0.95 (full membership), 0.50 (crossover), and 0.05 (full 
non-membership).  To  assess  robustness,  sensitivity  analyses  were 
conducted by applying alternative calibration thresholds (0.90 / 0.45 / 
0.10) alongside the original (0.95 / 0.50 / 0.05). Depression and anxiety 
were  reverse-calibrated  so  that  higher  fuzzy  scores  reflected  more 
desirable psychological states (i.e., lower symptoms). This system-level 
approach  revealed  multiple  equifinal  pathways  that  would  remain 
invisible in variable-centered analyses. By embedding fsQCA within 
a mixed-methods framework, our study leveraged its unique strengths 
to  capture  the  heterogeneous  ways  students  benefited  from  the 
KIPP-PP integrated course.

2.4.3 Qualitative analysis

We  analyzed  transcripts  using  a  directed  content  analysis 
strategy (Hsieh and Shannon, 2005). First-cycle coding applied a 
priori categories (increase in happiness, reduction in depression, 
reduction in anxiety) derived from the interview guide and study 
hypotheses. Second-cycle coding identified mechanism-oriented 
subcodes (e.g., emotional regulation, gratitude practices, meaning-
making, relationship repair) and countervailing patterns (neutral, 
mixed, and critical responses). Two independent coders worked 
blind  to  each  other’s  first-cycle  codes;  discrepancies  were 
adjudicated, achieving Cohen’s κ = 0.85. While our categories were 
deductively  anchored,  subcodes  were  developed  to  nuance  each 
domain.  The  final  report  illustrates  student  accounts  within  the 
three  predefined  domains  (happiness,  depression,  anxiety)  and 
documents boundary conditions, rather than presenting inductive 
theme generation.

The interviews were conducted in Chinese, as the study was 
conducted  at  a  university  in  China,  and  all  participants  were 
Chinese-speaking.  After  the  interviews,  the  transcripts  were 
translated into English by a bilingual researcher proficient in both 
Chinese and English to ensure accuracy and consistency. Moreover, 
a bilingual coder reviewed the final English translations and the 
original  Chinese  transcripts  to  ensure  consistency  and  preserve 
intended meaning. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and 
carefully reviewed for accuracy. Moreover, two independent coders 
conducted the analysis. Although the first author was the course 
instructor, bias was minimized by training both coders on the VIA 
framework and KIPP model, ensuring they worked independently 
during coding, and blinding the first author to the second coder’s 
initial codes. Coders were also blinded to each other’s initial codes, 
with  discrepancies  resolved  through  discussion,  achieving 
intercoder reliability (Cohen’s κ = 0.85). Member checking with 20 
participants confirmed the accuracy of themes. To further mitigate 
bias, the first author kept a reflexive journal, coders maintained 
awareness of positionality, and peer review and member checking 

ensured findings were grounded in participants’ voices rather than 
researcher expectations.

3 Results

The  final  sample  consisted  of  116  undergraduate  students. 
Participants  were  from  diverse  academic  disciplines,  including 
Business  (n = 30),  Fine  Arts  (n = 25),  Communication  (n = 24), 
Physical  Education  (n = 20),  Politics  and  Public  Administration 
(n = 10), and Engineering (n = 7), reflecting a broad representation 
across the university (see Table 1). The mean age of participants was 
19.8 years (SD = 1.2), ranging from 17 to 22. In terms of university 
year level, students came from all four academic years, with an average 
level of 2.32 (SD = 1.07). In terms of year of study, 32 students were in 
Year 1, 28 in Year 2, 31 in Year 3, and 25 in Year 4. As for gender 
distribution, of the 116 participants, 68 were male and 48 were female.
To  address  mental  health  baseline  status  and  potential  course 
effects, pre- and post-test data were collected using standardized self-
report  measures  of  happiness,  depression,  and  anxiety.  Results 
indicated  a  modest  improvement  in  subjective  well-being,  with 
happiness scores increasing from a mean of 3.97 (SD = 0.75) to 4.07 
(SD = 0.74). More notably, depression scores decreased from 21.14 
(SD = 15.09) to 16.28 (SD = 11.74), and anxiety scores dropped from 
20.67 (SD = 16.78) to 15.63 (SD = 13.32), suggesting reductions in 
negative affective symptoms (see Table 2).

3.1 Paired sample correlations

The  correlations  between  pre-  and  post-course  scores  were 
analyzed to assess the consistency of participants’ responses over time. 
The results revealed strong and statistically significant associations for 
all  three  variables.  For  happiness,  the  correlation  coefficient  was 
r = 0.821  (p < 0.001),  suggesting  a  high  degree  of  consistency  in 
participants’ self-reported happiness levels before and after the course. 
Similarly, for depression, the correlation was r = 0.741 (p < 0.001), 
demonstrating a strong relationship between pre- and post-course 
scores.  Anxiety  also  showed  a  robust  correlation,  with  r = 0.784 
(p < 0.001)  (Table  3).  These  findings  suggest  that  participants’ 
responses were highly stable across the two time points, reinforcing 
the reliability of the observed changes and providing confidence in the 
validity of the effects.

Reported values include means, SD, and observed ranges (minimum–maximum) for 
demographic variables (gender, age, university year level) and psychological measures 
(happiness, depression, anxiety) assessed at both pre-test and post-test. Higher scores on the 
Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ; range: 1–6) reflect greater happiness, whereas 
higher scores on the Oxford Depression Questionnaire (range: 0–93) and Oxford Anxiety 
Questionnaire (range: 0–99) reflect greater symptom severity.

3.2 Paired-sample t-tests

Paired-sample  t-tests  were  conducted  to  evaluate  whether  the 
observed  changes  in  happiness,  depression,  and  anxiety  were 
statistically significant. To address the issue of inflated Type I error due 
to multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction was applied (adjusted 
α = 0.05/3 = 0.017). The results demonstrated statistically significant 
improvements  across  all  three  psychological  outcomes,  with 
accompanying effect sizes to reflect practical significance (Table 4).

For  happiness,  the  mean  difference  was  −0.11  (SD = 0.44),  t 
(115) = −2.65, p = 0.009 (Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.027), indicating 
a small but significant increase in subjective happiness following the 
course. The effect size was small (Cohen’s d = 0.25), suggesting that 
although the change was statistically reliable, its practical magnitude 
was modest (Figures 1, 2). For depression, the analysis revealed a 
mean reduction of 4.86 points (SD = 10.15), t (115) = 5.16, p < 0.001 
(Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.001), with a moderate effect size (Cohen’s 
d = 0.48). This finding suggests a significant decrease in depressive 
symptoms among participants (Figures 3, 4).

For anxiety, the mean reduction was 5.04 points (SD = 10.42), t 
(115) = 5.21, p < 0.001 (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.001), accompanied 

3.3 Results from the fsQCA

The  fsQCA  analysis  examined  how  different  combinations  of 
course  modules  were  associated  with  students’  psychological 
outcomes. No single module was observed to function as a necessary 
condition for happiness, depression, or anxiety, implying that well-
being  outcomes  were  associated  with  the  combined  influence  of 
multiple components rather than any single dominant factor.

First, regarding happiness, two distinct pathways were associated 
with  higher  or  lower  happiness.  Students  who  engaged  in  both 
Discovering  Strengths,  Self-Regulation  and  Balance  and  Building 
Resilience reported greater happiness, suggesting that self-regulatory 
and resilience-based skills were linked to positive affect. In contrast, 
students who primarily participated in Strengthening Relationships 
and Integrating Strengths into Daily Life without sufficient support 
from self-regulation and resilience modules tended to report lower 
happiness.  Table  5  displays  configurations  that  are  associated 
with happiness.

Second, as for depression, four different pathways were linked to 
reduced  depression.  Most  prominently,  configurations  combining 
Strengthening  Relationships,  Building  Resilience,  and  Finding 
Meaning and Joy were associated with lower depressive symptoms, 
highlighting the importance of social connection, coping strategies, 
and meaning-making. Alternative configurations also showed that 
self-regulation  and  daily  strength  application  could  buffer  against 
depression even when interpersonal modules were less central. Table 6 
displays configurations that are associated with depression.

Third, regarding anxiety, two stable pathways were associated with 
reduced anxiety. In some cases, Integrating Strengths into Daily Life 
alone was sufficient to align with lower anxiety, underscoring the value 
of applying character strengths in everyday routines. Another pathway 
involved  Strengthening  Relationships,  Building  Resilience,  and 
Finding  Meaning  and  Joy,  which  together  provided  relational, 
emotional,  and  existential  resources  for  managing  stress.  Table  7 
displays configurations that are associated with depression.

Overall, these results indicate that improvements in well-being 
were  associated  with  multiple,  equifinal  configurations  of  course 
modules, consistent with the configurational logic of fsQCA. Detailed 
calibration  thresholds,  and  necessity  analyses  are  reported  in  the 
Supplementary Tables S2–S5.

Besides, sensitivity analyses using stricter calibration thresholds 
(0.90/0.45/0.10)  produced  results  that  were  consistent  with  the 
original models, with only minor variations for depression. Detailed 
statistics are reported in the Supplementary Tables S6–S9.

3.4 Qualitative results

In line with our directed content analysis approach, the results are 
organized into three themes corresponding to the predefined outcome 
domains gained from the integrated KIPP and Positive Psychology 
course: reduction in depression, reduction in anxiety, and increase in 
happiness. These outcomes were attributed to specific combinations of 
course modules and were further aligned with corresponding KIPP/

3.4.2 Theme 2: reduction in depression

Student accounts illustrated that the integrated modules helped 
alleviate  depressive  symptoms  by  fostering  emotional  regulation, 
cognitive reframing, and self-awareness. This directly addresses RQ1: 
How does the course influence students’ psychological well-being? 
Specifically, it supports H1b.

For example, the combination of the Strengthening Relationships, 
Finding Meaning and Joy (Transcendence), and Integrating Strengths 
into Daily Life modules was especially impactful. “The course helped 
reduce my depression by teaching me to view relationships with optimism 
and empathy. It brought positive energy to my relationship and gave me 
a goal to pursue in life.” (P24).

Another group of students emphasized how perseverance and 
meaning-making  played  a  central  role  in  mitigating  depressive 
thoughts. They particularly referenced the Discovering Strengths, Self-
Regulation and Balance, and Finding Meaning and Joy modules. “I 
realized that life is not always joyful, but overcoming difficulties makes 
us stronger. As long as we do not give up, there’s always light ahead.” 
(P9). In total, 40% of students mentioned improved relationships as 
reducing depression, and 45% highlighted meaning-making as crucial 
for mitigating depressive thoughts.

3.4.3 Theme 3: reduction in anxiety

Students reported that the Strengthening Relationships, Building 
Resilience, and Finding Meaning and Joy (Transcendence) modules 
helped them reduce anxiety by promoting self-acceptance, emotional 
stability, and relational understanding. This directly responds to RQ1 
regarding the course’s effect on psychological well-being, particularly 
H1c. “After taking this course, I feel calmer and more grounded. I’ve 
learned not to let others’ opinions hurt me—only by loving and affirming 
myself  can  I  feel  truly  confident.  It  has  significantly  reduced  my 
depression and anxiety.” (P101).

Another  student  described  gratitude  as  a  tool  for  redirecting 
emotional attention away from worry: “Practicing gratitude helped me 
shift  focus  from  worries  to  positive  feelings…  the  greatest  help  was 

improvements 

learning to be grateful. It clearly reduced my anxiety.” (P68). In addition, 
one  participant  highlighted 
in  mindset  and 
interpersonal skills: “These modules helped me develop a better mindset 
and stronger interpersonal skills, which reduced my anxiety in daily life. 
This  course  gave  me  a  healthier  outlook.  I  worry  less  when  facing 
setbacks and understand myself better. I’m more patient with others, and 
my life feels more peaceful—my anxiety has definitely reduced.” (P65). 
Overall, 50% of participants cited self-affirmation as key in managing 
anxiety, and 40% emphasized gratitude as a way to reduce anxiety by 
fostering positive emotions.

Although  the  three  primary  themes—Increase  in  Happiness, 
Reduction  in  Depression,  and  Reduction  in  Anxiety—were  most 
prominent in the qualitative dataset, the analysis also revealed neutral, 
mixed,  and  critical  perspectives.  Approximately  15%  of  students 
expressed neutral reflections, noting that the course did not noticeably 
change their well-being but still provided useful knowledge (e.g., “The 
course was interesting, but I cannot say it changed my happiness or mood 
much.” P52). Around 12% of participants voiced mixed responses, 
indicating partial benefits combined with ongoing challenges (e.g., 
“Some modules made me feel calmer, but my anxiety still comes back 
during exams.” P87). In addition, about 8% of students raised critical 
reflections,  reporting  discomfort  or  skepticism  regarding  certain 
modules. For example, several noted that relationship-focused content 
sometimes heightened pressure (“Discussions about family relationships 
made me feel more stressed because my situation is complicated.” P41), 
while others questioned the long-term sustainability of course practices 
(“Gratitude journaling worked at first, but I stopped doing it after the 
course  ended.”  P29).  These  perspectives  were  carefully  considered 
during coding and theme development to avoid confirmatory bias. The 
presence of neutral, mixed, and critical reflections underscores the 
diversity of student experiences. Their inclusion during the analytic 
process  helped  refine  coding  decisions,  ensure  proportional 
representation, and confirm that the primary domains were adequately 
illustrated by student accounts rather than imposed solely by course 
objectives.  In  addition,  it  is  noteworthy  that  student  accounts 
referencing reductions in depression were more frequent and detailed 
than those addressing anxiety or happiness. This uneven distribution 
of qualitative material may reflect the relative salience of depressive 
symptoms in students’ lived experiences, and suggests that the course’s 
perceived impact was especially pronounced in this domain.

4 Discussion

This study evaluated the impact of an integrated KIPP and Positive 
Psychology course on university students’ psychological well-being in 
China,  using  a  mixed-methods  design  that  included  pre-post 
quantitative analysis, fsQCA, and qualitative interviews. The findings 
offer  valuable  insights  into  how  strength-based  education—when 
culturally adapted and structurally anchored—can enhance students’ 
happiness while reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety.

First, to answer RQ1 and support H1a–H1c, paired-sample t-tests 
demonstrated statistically significant changes: happiness increased, 
depression decreased, and anxiety decreased. The effect sizes ranged 
from small to moderate, which is consistent with findings typically 
observed in educational well-being interventions. These results align 
with recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses showing that multi-
component  positive  psychology  interventions  generally  yield

small-to-moderate  improvements  in  well-being  and  reductions  in 
distress among university students (Hendriks et al., 2019; Hobbs et al., 
2022).  The  qualitative  data  further  elaborated  on  the  research 
questions and hypotheses of the study. For happiness, the statistical 
results showed a small but significant increase, which was further 
corroborated by the qualitative findings. Specifically, students reported 
increased happiness through enhanced emotional regulation, self-
awareness, and gratitude, as captured in qualitative interviews. For 
example, one student shared, “I became more confident and positive, 
which significantly increased my happiness” (P34), which aligned with 
the quantitative finding of a moderate increase in happiness scores. 
This  convergence  of  results  across  both  datasets  underscores  the 
validity of the course’s impact on increasing happiness.

Similarly, for depression, the paired-sample t-test demonstrated a 
significant reduction in depressive symptoms, which was mirrored by 
the qualitative data. Students emphasized the role of the course in 
alleviating depression through strategies like emotional regulation, 
cognitive reframing, and meaning-making. For instance, one student 
noted, “I realized that life is not always joyful, but overcoming difficulties 
makes us stronger” (P9), aligning with the quantitative finding of a 
moderate decrease in depression scores. These qualitative accounts 
help deepen the understanding of how the course were associated with 
this  reduction,  with  emotional  resilience  and  social  connections 
playing  pivotal  roles.  Anxiety  reduction,  as  shown  by  the  paired-
sample t-test result, was another key outcome of the course. Students 
frequently  cited  the  importance  of  self-acceptance  and  emotional 
stability  in  managing  anxiety.  “Practicing  gratitude  helped  me  shift 
focus from worries to positive feelings… the greatest help was learning to 
be grateful. It clearly reduced my anxiety.” (P68). This qualitative insight 
complements the quantitative results, which indicated a significant 
decrease in anxiety scores, highlighting the role of both individual and 
social factors in alleviating anxiety.

Moreover, to address RQ2 and RQ3, the fsQCA results provided 
deeper insights into the specific course modules and configurations 
that are associated with improved psychological well-being. These 
configurational findings were both complemented and nuanced by 
insights  derived  from  students’  qualitative  reflections.  The  fsQCA 
findings showed that no single module was necessary for the observed 
improvements 
in  psychological  well-being.  Instead,  multiple 
combinations of modules functioned synergistically, reinforcing the 
value of adopting a systems-oriented perspective. These quantitative 
patterns were largely reflected in students’ subjective experiences, as 
captured through qualitative interview data. For example, both fsQCA 
and  qualitative  data  pointed  to  the  combination  of  “Discovering 
Strengths,  Self-Regulation  and  Balance”  and  “Building  Resilience” 
modules as particularly effective in increasing happiness. Students 
reported gaining enhanced self-awareness, confidence, and emotional 
regulation skills that allowed them to adopt more optimistic mindsets 
and reframe difficulties in adaptive ways. One student noted, “This 
course gave me a structured path for personal growth and helped me 
live a healthier, happier life” (P7), echoing the identified sufficiency of 
this configuration in the fsQCA analysis.

Similarly,  fsQCA  identified  several  pathways  that  effectively 
reduced  depression,  notably  those  involving  Building  Resilience, 
Finding Meaning and Joy, and Integrating Strengths into Daily Life. 
Students’ reflections corroborated this, with many expressing that the 
course helped them manage low moods by teaching them how to 
cultivate  gratitude,  reinterpret  setbacks,  and  derive  meaning  from 

adversity. “I realized that life is not always joyful, but overcoming 
difficulties makes us stronger,” one student shared (P9), highlighting 
the existential and emotional coping mechanisms that aligned with 
the fsQCA pathways.

In terms of anxiety reduction, both analytic methods highlighted 
the  importance  of  Integrating  Strengths  into  Daily  Life.  FsQCA 
suggested that it could serve as a stand-alone sufficient condition for 
anxiety reduction. Qualitative reports echoed this, with students citing 
how applying learned character strengths in daily routines helped 
them feel more grounded, calm, and capable of navigating stress. For 
instance, one student stated, “Practicing gratitude helped me shift 
focus from worries to positive feelings… the greatest help was learning 
to be grateful. It clearly reduced my anxiety.” (P68).

relationships—central 

However, it is worth noting that fsQCA identified a configuration 
where  students  who  received  “Strengthening  Relationships”  and 
“Integrating Strengths into Daily Life” without the support of more 
introspective modules (such as “Discovering Strengths” or “Building 
Resilience”) tended to report lower happiness levels. Some qualitative 
comments hinted at possible emotional strain from relational topics. 
For  instance,  a  few  students  mentioned  that  content  related  to 
the 
romantic  or 
“Strengthening Relationships” module—was associated with feelings 
of discomfort or pressure. These students reported that their existing 
interpersonal difficulties were not always adequately addressed, and 
that expectations to “improve” relationships were experienced as an 
additional source of stress. This suggests that relational modules, while 
generally  beneficial,  may  require  greater  scaffolding  or  emotional 
readiness to prevent unintended emotional burden—an important 
nuance not captured in fsQCA but visible through qualitative nuance. 
One possible explanation is that university students may experience 
heightened pressure when addressing relationship-building topics, 
such as romantic relationships or social interactions, which are central 
to the Strengthening Relationships module. Future research could 
further explore this dynamic to better understand how relationship-
focused content impacts student well-being and stress levels.

The findings of the study are consistent with earlier work showing 
that positive psychology interventions enhance well-being and reduce 
psychological distress (Peterson and Seligman, 2004; Quinlan et al., 
2019). Beyond this foundational evidence, more recent systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses underscore both the effectiveness and the 
cultural contingencies of positive psychology interventions. Multi-
component positive psychology interventions are generally effective 
across  populations,  but  outcomes  are  moderated  by  cultural  and 
contextual factors, underscoring the importance of adaptation beyond 
Western contexts (Hendriks et al., 2019; Hendriks et al., 2020; van 
Agteren  et  al.,  2021).  In  higher  education  specifically,  positive 
psychology  courses  have  been  shown  to  significantly  improve 
happiness, reduce depression and anxiety, and strengthen resilience 
among university students. Tarrats-Pons et al. (2025), for example, 
reported that positive psychology interventions alleviated depression 
and enhanced optimism among Spanish undergraduates. Similarly, 
Hobbs et al. (2022) reviewed 27 global studies and found that 85% 
reported positive outcomes, including increased life satisfaction and 
happiness, though many studies faced methodological limitations. 
Together, this literature positions positive psychology interventions as 
globally promising tools for promoting student well-being, while also 
highlighting  the  necessity  of  cultural  tailoring  to  align  with  local 
values and practices.

At the same time, scholars have raised concerns about cultural 
transferability and contextual fit. Lambert et al. (2023), for instance, 
caution that positive psychology interventions, while beneficial, may 
risk promoting a one-size-fits-all model of well-being that does not 
always reflect the lived realities of students in non-Western contexts. 
Our  qualitative  findings  provide  partial  support  for  this  concern. 
Several  students  reinterpreted  course  content  through  culturally 
specific values, such as relational harmony and emotional moderation, 
and expressed ambivalence toward modules focused on interpersonal 
change. In particular, 15% of students reported neutral experiences, 
suggesting that although the course was informative, its impact was 
uneven and may not have reached students whose baseline well-being 
was  less  affected.  Another  12%  described  mixed  outcomes, 
highlighting challenges in sustaining benefits outside the classroom. 
This underscores the potential value of follow-up strategies—such as 
booster sessions, digital tools, or reflective assignments—to reinforce 
skills and promote long-term change. Meanwhile, 8% voiced critical 
reflections, particularly regarding the relational modules. Sensitive 
topics  such  as  family  or  romantic  relationships,  while  important, 
sometimes generated additional stress or discomfort. These concerns 
point to the need for greater scaffolding, optional participation, or 
supplementary  support  resources  (e.g.,  small-group  guidance  or 
counseling  referrals)  to  ensure  students  feel  both  supported  and 
respected when engaging with such content. Addressing these neutral, 
mixed, and critical perspectives not only mitigates unintended stress 
but also enhances the inclusivity and sustainability of the program. By 
integrating culturally sensitive adjustments and responsive scaffolding, 
the  course  can  evolve  beyond  a  standardized  model  toward  a 
strengths-based  approach  that  is  both  adaptable  and  more  deeply 
aligned with the diverse needs of Chinese university students.

Despite the promising findings, this study has several limitations. 
First,  the  research  was  conducted  at  a  single  university  in 
southeastern China, which may constrain the generalizability of the 
results to other higher education contexts. Replicating this study 
across diverse institutional and regional settings would enhance the 
external  validity  of  the  findings.  Second,  although  the  pre-post 
comparisons  indicate  significant  short-term  improvements  in 
psychological well-being, the durability of these effects over time 
remains  unknown.  Future  longitudinal  studies  should  include 
follow-up  assessments  to  evaluate  the  long-term  impact  of  the 
course.  Third,  while  the  removal  of  one  item  from  each  of  the 
happiness  and  depression  scales  was  informed  by  semantic 
ambiguity  and  cultural  inappropriateness  based  on  participant 
feedback, this modification may limit direct comparability with prior 
studies using the full standardized scales. Future research should 
retain all original items to facilitate cross-cultural validation and 
ensure consistency with existing literature. Fourth, the absence of a 
control group limits the ability to attribute observed changes solely 
to the intervention. Future studies could adopt a randomized design 
to more rigorously assess causality. However, the combination of 
pre-post comparisons, fsQCA configurational analysis, and student 
interviews  offers  triangulated  evidence  that  strengthens  internal 
validity despite this limitation. Fifth, while all survey responses were 
confidential, the lack of complete anonymity in data collection may 
have introduced some degree of social desirability bias. To mitigate 
this,  participants  were  reminded  that  their  responses  would  not 
affect  their  grades  or  be  shared  with  instructors.  Besides,  while 
fsQCA  enabled  the  identification  of  multiple  configurations 

contributing  to  well-being  outcomes,  this  method  also  carries 
specific limitations. For example, fsQCA results are sensitive to the 
calibration  thresholds  chosen  during  data  preparation,  which 
introduced  a  degree  of  subjectivity  in  translating  continuous 
variables  into  fuzzy  sets.  Although  we  followed  established 
guidelines and used both empirical and theoretical justifications for 
our calibration anchors, the potential for interpretive bias remains. 
Future  research  may  benefit  from  combining  fsQCA  with 
longitudinal or hybrid-comparative designs—such as panel studies 
or  mixed-methods  quasi-experiments—to  triangulate  findings. 
Finally,  given  that  interview  questions  explicitly  referenced 
happiness,  depression,  and  anxiety,  qualitative  evidence  may 
overweight  those  domains.  While  the  use  of  directed  content 
analysis  usefully  complements  the  quantitative  outcomes,  it 
inherently  constrains  the  scope  of  findings  by  focusing  on 
pre-specified domains and does not capture broader or unexpected 
aspects of student experience. We partially mitigated this by training 
interviewers  to  probe  for  unexpected,  null,  or  negative  effects, 
quantifying neutral/mixed/critical content, and reporting counter-
examples.  Future  work  should  incorporate  broader  life-domain 
prompts (e.g., day-in-the-life narratives), blinding interviewers to 
hypotheses, and separating interview timing from course completion 
to further reduce demand characteristics.

that 

combines 

framework 

This study adds to the growing literature on integrated positive 
psychology interventions in higher education by explicitly embedding 
the  KIPP  character  framework  into  a  Chinese  university  context. 
Unlike programs focusing solely on cognitive or emotional skills, this 
course emphasized applied character development across emotional, 
social, and existential domains, aligning with calls for holistic and 
culturally  adapted  well-being  education.  Moreover,  by  adopting  a 
mixed-methods 
quantitative, 
configurational, and qualitative evidence, our study extends beyond 
outcome evaluation to uncover the specific mechanisms and student 
experiences  that  drive  psychological  change.  Our  findings  carry 
practical  implications  for  curriculum  design  and  mental  health 
promotion  in  higher  education.  First,  modules  that  target  self-
regulation,  resilience,  and  meaning-making—especially  when 
delivered in an integrated fashion—should be prioritized. Second, 
educators  should  recognize  that  interpersonal  modules  may 
be  double-edged:  while  they  offer  opportunities  for  emotional 
connection, they may also heighten stress for students unprepared to 
navigate relational vulnerability. Providing adequate scaffolding and 
optional engagement modes can help mitigate this issue. At the policy 
level,  this  study  affirms  the  feasibility  and  potential  benefits  of 
embedding  structured  character  education  into  general  education 
courses. The global expansion of positive psychology education—
documented in Australia, the U. S., and other nations (Allen et al., 
2017; Seligman and Adler, 2018)—finds resonance in our findings, 
especially in light of the unique challenges faced by Chinese university 
students, such as academic stress, perfectionism, and stigma around 
mental  health  help-seeking.  As  mental  well-being  becomes  an 
increasingly recognized pillar of educational success, programs like 
“Building a Flourishing Life” offer evidence-informed strategies to 
promote flourishing in youth populations. Additionally, the findings 
highlight  the  necessity  of  an  approach  that  integrates  multiple 
character  strengths  rather  than  relying  on  isolated  interventions. 
Beyond curriculum design, these findings have broader implications 
for mental health policies in higher education. Universities should

consider incorporating strength-based interventions into counseling 
and support services, providing students with structured opportunities 
to cultivate resilience and well-being. Given the significant reductions 
in  depression  and  anxiety  observed  in  this  study,  there  is  strong 
justification  for  scaling  up  such  interventions  to  reach  a  broader 
student population.
