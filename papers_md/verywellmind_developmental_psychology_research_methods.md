- Experimental Research Methods

There are many differentdevelopmental psychologyresearch methods, including cross-sectional, longitudinal, correlational, and experimental. Each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages. The one that a scientist chooses depends largely on the aim of the study and the nature of the phenomenon being studied.

Research design provides a standardized framework to test a hypothesis and evaluate whether the hypothesis is correct, incorrect, or inconclusive. Even if the hypothesis is untrue,the researchcan often provide insights that may prove valuable or move research in an entirely new direction.

In order to study developmental psychology, researchers utilize a number of different research methods. Some involve looking at different cross-sections of a population, while others look at how participants change over time. In other cases, researchers look at how whether certain variables appear to have a relationship with one another. In order to determine if there is a cause-and-effect relationship, however, psychologists much conduct experimental research.

Learn more about each of these different types of developmental psychology research methods, including when they are used and what they can reveal about human development.


## Cross-Sectional Research Methods


Cross-sectional researchinvolves looking at different groups of people with specific characteristics.

For example, a researcher might evaluate a group of young adults and compare the corresponding data from a group of older adults.

The benefit of this type of research is that it can be done relatively quickly; the research data is gathered at the same point in time. The disadvantage is that the research aims to make a direct association between a cause and an effect. This is not always so easy. In some cases, there may be confounding factors that contribute to the effect.

To this end, a cross-sectional study can suggest the odds of an effect occurring both in terms of the absolute risk (the odds of something happening over a period of time) and the relative risk (the odds of something happening in one group compared to another).﻿﻿


## Longitudinal Research Methods


Longitudinal researchinvolves studying the same group of individuals over an extended period of time.

Data is collected at the outset of the study and gathered repeatedly through the course of study. In some cases, longitudinal studies can last for several decades or be open-ended. One such example is the Terman Study of theGifted, which began in the 1920s and followed 1528 children for over 80 years.

The benefit of this longitudinal research is that it allows researchers to look at changes over time. By contrast, one of the obvious disadvantages is cost. Because of the expense of a long-term study, they tend to be confined to a smaller group of subjects or a narrower field of observation.


### Challenges of Longitudinal Research


While revealing, longitudinal studies present a few challenges that make them more difficult to use when studying developmental psychology and other topics.

- Longitudinal studies are difficult to apply to a larger population.

- Another problem is that the participants can often drop out mid-study, shrinking the sample size and relative conclusions.

- Moreover, if certain outside forces change during the course of the study (including economics, politics, and science), they can influence the outcomes in a way that significantly skews the results.

For example, in Lewis Terman's longitudinal study, the correlation betweenIQandachievementwas blunted by such confounding forces as the Great Depression and World War II (which limited educational attainment) and gender politics of the 1940s and 1950s (which limited a woman's professional prospects).


## Correlational Research Methods


Correlational researchaims to determine if one variable has a measurable association with another.

In this type of non-experimental study, researchers look at relationships between the two variables but do not introduce the variables themselves. Instead, they gather and evaluate the available data and offer a statistical conclusion.

For example, the researchers may look at whether academic success in elementary school leads to better-paying jobs in the future. While the researchers can collect and evaluate the data, they do not manipulate any of the variables in question.

A correlational study can be appropriate and helpful if you cannot manipulate a variable because it is impossible, impractical, or unethical.

For example, imagine that a researcher wants to determine if living in a noisy environment makes people less efficient in the workplace. It would be impractical and unreasonable to artificially inflate the noise level in a working environment. Instead, researchers might collect data and then look for correlations between the variables of interest.


### Limitations of Correlational Research


Correlational research has its limitations. While it can identify an association, it does not necessarily suggest a cause for the effect.Just because two variables have a relationship does not mean that changes in one will affect a change in the other.


## Experimental Research Methods


Unlike correlational research, experimentation involves both the manipulation and measurement ofvariables. This model of research is the most scientifically conclusive and commonly used in medicine, chemistry, psychology, biology, and sociology.

Experimental research uses manipulation to understand cause and effect in a sampling of subjects. The sample is comprised of two groups: an experimental group in whom the variable (such as a drug or treatment) is introduced and a control group in whom the variable is not introduced.

Deciding the sample groups can be done in a number of ways:

- Population sampling, in which the subjects represent a specific population

- Random selection, in which subjects are chosen randomly to see if the effects of the variable are consistently achieved


### Challenges in Experimental Resarch


While the statistical value of an experimental study is robust, it may be affected byconfirmation bias. This is when the investigator's desire to publish or achieve an unambiguous result can skew the interpretations, leading to a false-positive conclusion.

One way to avoid this is to conduct adouble-blind studyin which neither the participants nor researchers are aware of which group is the control. A double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) is considered the gold standard of research.
