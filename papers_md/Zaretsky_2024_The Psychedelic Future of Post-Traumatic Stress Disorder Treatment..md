Abstract: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can occur following 
exposure to a traumatic experience. An estimated 12 million U.S. adults are presently affected by this 
disorder.  Current  treatments  include  psychological  therapies  (e.g.,  exposure-based  interventions)  and 
pharmacological treatments (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)). However, a signifi-
cant  proportion  of  patients  receiving  standard-of-care  therapies  for  PTSD  remain  symptomatic,  and 
new approaches for this and other trauma-related mental health conditions are greatly needed. Psyche-
delic compounds that alter cognition, perception, and mood are currently being examined for their ef-
ficacy  in  treating  PTSD  despite  their  current  status  as  Drug  Enforcement  Administration  (DEA)-
scheduled  substances.  Initial  clinical  trials  have  demonstrated  the  potential  value  of  psychedelic-
assisted  therapy  to  treat  PTSD  and  other  psychiatric  disorders.  In  this  comprehensive  review,  we 
summarize the state of the science of PTSD clinical care, including current treatments and their short-
comings. We review clinical studies of psychedelic interventions to treat PTSD, trauma-related disor-
ders,  and  common  comorbidities.  The  classic  psychedelics  psilocybin,  lysergic  acid  diethylamide 
(LSD),  and  N,N-dimethyltryptamine  (DMT)  and  DMT-containing  ayahuasca,  as  well  as  the  entac-
togen  3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA)  and  the  dissociative  anesthetic  ketamine,  are 
reviewed. For each drug, we present the history of use, psychological and somatic effects, pharmacol-
ogy, and safety profile. The rationale and proposed mechanisms for use in treating PTSD and trauma-
related disorders are discussed. This review concludes with an in-depth consideration of future direc-
tions  for  the  psychiatric  applications  of  psychedelics  to  maximize  therapeutic  benefit  and  minimize 
risk in individuals and communities impacted by trauma-related conditions. 

Keywords: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), Ayahuasca, Ketamine, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), psilocybin, psychedelics, trauma. 

1. INTRODUCTION 
  The  21st  century  has  seen  a  significant  increase  in  re-

drugs  for  the  treatment  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD)  and  other  trauma-related  mental  health  conditions. 
Interest  in  studying  the  safety,  efficacy,  and  mechanisms  of 
psychedelic-assisted therapy for PTSD has been fueled by a

MDMA-assisted  therapy  for  PTSD  is  close  to  approval  by 
the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA),  placing  a 
spotlight  on  the  potential  utility  of  other  psychedelic  PTSD 
treatments. Such compounds act through related mechanisms 
(Table  1),  and  understanding  their  functioning  may  identify 
novel  targets  for  intervention  in  PTSD  and  other  trauma-
related  mental  health  conditions.  Envisioning  the  future  of 
psychedelic  treatments  for  PTSD  and  related  disorders  ne-
cessitates  a  careful  examination  of  what  is  known  and  un-
known about the impacts of trauma exposure, the subjective 
and  objective  effects  of  psychedelic  compounds,  the  pro-
posed  psychological  and  biological  mechanisms  of  psyche-
delic-assisted  psychotherapy,  and  the  ways  in  which  these 
treatments might support recovery after trauma exposure.

The Psychedelic Future of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    637 

In  examining  potential  treatments  for  PTSD,  it  must  be 
noted  that  aspects  of  the  etiology  and  pathophysiology  of 
PTSD are not fully understood. For instance, although trau-
ma-related  conditions  such  as  PTSD  are  thought  to  be  pre-
cipitated  by  exposure  to  traumatic  experiences,  such  expo-
sures  clearly  represent  necessary  but  not  sufficient  explana-
tions for disease onset and persistence. Indeed, nearly every 
person  will  experience  a  significant  traumatic  event  in  their 
lifetime  [1,  2],  but  only  a  minority  will  develop  PTSD  [3]. 
The  majority  experience  initial  acute  reactions,  such  as  in-
creased  arousal  and  hypervigilance,  that  typically  resolve 
over time. However, others will continue experiencing more 
enduring  symptoms  [3].  Suppose  initial  trauma-related 
symptoms  do  not  abate,  and  lead  to  significant  distress  or 
functional  impairment.  In  that  case,  those  affected  can  be 
diagnosed  with  PTSD  or  other  trauma-related  disorders  de-
fined  in  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental 
Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5) or other standards. 

  A  range  of  treatments  for  PTSD  and  trauma-related  dis-
orders  are  currently  available.  Many  established  treatment 
guidelines recommend various forms of cognitive behavioral 
or  exposure-based  psychotherapy  as  the  first-line  treatment 
[4,  5].  These  treatments  have  demonstrated  efficacy  for  the 
PTSD  population.  However,  the  effectiveness  of  these  ap-
proaches  is  compromised  by  high  treatment  dropout  rates  - 
an  average  of  29%  and  as  high  as  55.8%  -  particularly  in 
studies attempting to evaluate these approaches in real-world 
clinical  settings  like  the  Veterans  Administration  (VA) 
health service [6-8]. Dropout rates may be influenced by the 
distress induced by the instruction to confront traumatic ma-
terial  that  cannot  be  tolerated  within  the  context  of  the  per-
son’s current emotional and mental state. Dropout may also 
occur when patients feel emotionally numb and are unable to 
engage  emotionally  with  the  material.  While  cognitive  be-
havioral therapy (CBT) seeks to promote desensitization and 
habituation to traumatic memories and triggers, and promote 
new learning to replace negative cognitive schemas that per-
petuate  symptoms,  these  goals  can  best  be  accomplished  in 
patients who can remain within an optimal window of arous-
al without becoming hyper- or hyperaroused [9]. Inadequacy 
of  addressing  co-occurring  disorders  [10]  and  other  compli-
cating  characteristics  such  as  problems  with  interpersonal 
trust,  incoherent  self-organization,  and  dissociation  [11-14] 
may  also  render  these  treatments  inaccessible  to  or  ineffec-
tive for many patients. 

  Additionally, many therapies for PTSD have been devel-
oped  within  the  context  of  a  fear  extinction  model.  Fear  re-
sponses are easier to model and evoke in animals, which has 
allowed for insight into the neurological mechanisms of fear, 
including the activity and connectivity of the amygdala, pre-
frontal  cortex,  and  anterior  cingulate  cortex,  among  others 
[15].  The  role  of  this  fear  circuitry  has  been  replicated  in 
individuals with PTSD [16, 17], but it has been challenging 
to model other aspects that involve more cognitive and emo-
tional components of the disorder [18-22]. Furthermore, fear 
conditioning alone cannot fully explain the development and 
maintenance  of  PTSD  since  this  is  a  multifactorial  disorder 
influenced  by  various  aspects,  including  cognitive,  environ-
mental, genetic, and social factors. Therefore, although it has 
been  expedient  to  conceptualize  both  the  disorder  and  the 
treatment  of  PTSD  through  a  lens  of  fear  extinction,  it  is 

appropriate  to  incorporate  a  more  ecological  and  contextual 
approach that would provide a better understanding of PTSD 
to  also  allow  consideration  of  other  responses  like  shame, 
guilt, loss, or moral injury, which are more difficult to model 
in animals and study from a biological perspective. 

  Medications used to treat PTSD span all psychopharma-
cologic  classes,  with  all  treatments  repurposed  from  their 
original indications [23]; in other words, to date, no drug has 
been  developed  and  approved  specifically  for  this  disorder 
based  on  PTSD-specific  pathophysiology.  The  two  FDA-
approved  medications  for  PTSD,  the  selective  serotonin 
reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  sertraline  and  paroxetine,  were 
originally  developed  for  use  in  major  depressive  disorder 
(MDD),  a  condition  with  some  overlapping  but  essentially 
distinct  neurochemical  features  [24].  Accordingly,  these  an-
tidepressants  have  both  been  found  to  be  only  minimally 
more effective than placebo [25, 26]. Since their approval in 
1999  and  2000,  respectively,  no  new  pharmacologic  agents 
have  been  FDA-approved  for  the  treatment  of  PTSD  [27]. 
The tolerability and side effects of existing psychiatric medi-
cations  also  limit  their  long-term  use,  and  some  pharma-
cotherapies may induce a numbing effect that limits the op-
portunity  for  individuals  to  fully  process  their  emotions  re-
sulting  from  their  traumatic  experiences.  The  paradigm  of 
targeting  a  drug  to  a  specific  underlying  biochemical  path-
way  implicated  in  the  etiology  of  PTSD  has  recently  been 
questioned, though such target engagement is heralded as the 
standard on which rationales for pharmacotherapy in psychi-
atry should be developed [23]. This has led to a recent inter-
est in novel, alternative strategies that show promise even if 
their  mechanisms  of  action  remain  elusive.  In  addition,  the 
idea that treatments should be designed to counteract specific 
features  of  pathophysiology  may  be  subject  to  reconsidera-
tion as new approaches are found to be effective in a transdi-
agnostic manner. 

Psychedelic-based  treatments  have  been  proposed  as  al-
ternative options for PTSD due to unique characteristics that 
may  promote  healing  from  trauma  in  a  more  encompassing 
and enduring way than existing targeted treatments by offer-
ing  an  opportunity  for  patients  to  engage  in  an  emotionally 
intense process of introspection and insight. Importantly, this 
approach relies on a combination of medication plus psycho-
therapy.  The  psychedelic  substances  induce  transient  emo-
tional, perceptual, and cognitive alterations [28-31] that may 
promote an optimal state of arousal likely required for effec-
tive trauma processing [9]. Within this window of tolerance, 
the  psychological  effects  of  psychedelics  include  cognitive 
flexibility,  psychological  introspection  and  insight,  connect-
edness, self-compassion, interpersonal trust, empathy, spirit-
uality,  and/or  dissolution  of  a  sense  of  a  separate  self  (ego 
dissolution)  [32-37],  which  can  aid  healing  from  identity-
altering trauma. 

  Clinical trials are now underway to investigate the safety 
and  efficacy  of  psychedelic-assisted  therapies  for  the  treat-
ment of PTSD as well as other psychiatric conditions. In this 
treatment modality, the psychedelic is  administered only one 
to three times, under close professional supervision, and em-
bedded in a psychotherapeutic process. Following promising 
results  from  several  Phase  II  studies  [38,  39],  MDMA-
assisted  therapy  received  FDA  breakthrough  status  for  the

treatment  of  PTSD.  With  Phase  III  multi-site  randomized, 
placebo-controlled  trials  recently  completed  [40],  MDMA-
assisted  treatment  is  expected  to  receive  FDA  approval  by 
2024.  When  compared  with  conventional  treatments,  Phase 
III  results  of  MDMA-assisted  therapy  demonstrated  lower 
dropout  rates  (7.6%),  as  well  as  very  high  response  rates 
(80%),  with  only  ~1/3  of  participants  meeting  diagnostic 
criteria for PTSD at trial completion [40]. Beyond symptom 
reduction,  MDMA-assisted  therapy  is  also  associated  with 
more  holistic  measures  of  personal  growth  and  well-being, 
including  improvements  in  quality  of  life  [41],  and  post-
traumatic  growth  [42].  Other  psychedelic-assisted  therapies 
do  not  yet  have  published  data  for  the  treatment  of  PTSD, 
but  promising  Phase  II  results  include  psilocybin-assisted 
psychotherapy  for  treatment-resistant  depression  (TRD)  and 
alcohol  use  disorder  (AUD).  Given  the  transdiagnostic  po-
tential  of  these  treatments,  these  psychedelic-assisted  thera-
pies,  which  have  been  shown  to  be  medically  safe  [43,  44], 
may have value in the treatment of PTSD and trauma-related 
disorders.  The  main  psychedelics  under  current  investigation  
(Table 1) are MDMA, psilocybin, LSD, and DMT/ayahuasca; 
these  drugs  will  be  the  focus  of  this  paper,  along  with  the 
dissociative  anesthetic  ketamine,  which  has  been  FDA-
approved  for  treatment-resistant  depression  (TRD)  and  has 
active clinical trials for PTSD. 

  As  psychiatry  prepares  for  a  new  phase  of  exploration 
involving the use of psychedelics, it is important to consider 
how psychedelics could be integrated into care for the treat-
ment  of  trauma  sequelae  within  the  context  of  the  conven-
tional  mental  health  infrastructure.  This  paper  provides  a 
review of the literature regarding the use of psychedelics in 
psychiatry  as  related  to  the  treatment  of  trauma  disorders. 
Additionally,  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  psychedelics,  in-
cluding  their  history,  subjective  and  objective  effects,  and 
pharmacotherapy,  is  provided,  as  well  as  information  about 
the  clinical  trial  data  for  each  drug  and  the  possible  role  of 
psychedelics in treating those affected by trauma. 

Furthermore, this review examines issues relevant to the 
future of psychedelics for the treatment of PTSD and trauma-
related disorders. While data thus far suggest that psychedel-
ic-assisted  psychotherapy  (PAP)  has  the  potential  to  be  a 
successful treatment for PTSD, several features of these ap-
proaches can also be risky; hence, we discuss both risks and 
benefits  of  this  approach.  Considerations  of  potential  psy-
chological  harms  associated  with  psychedelic-assisted  psy-
chotherapy  are  discussed  throughout.  Additionally,  as  these 
treatments  are  time-intensive  and  require  significant  human 
resources,  issues  related  to  scalability  and  feasibility  will 
have  to  be  considered.  Current  knowledge  about  the  influ-
ence of set (state of mind) and setting (physical environment) 
on  the  therapeutic  psychedelic  experience  is  reviewed,  and 
we  consider  future  work  to  elucidate  these  influences.  We 
comment on the design of clinical trials involving psychedel-
ic-assisted  psychotherapy,  including  the  selection  of  appro-
priate control conditions and re-imagining exclusion criteria, 
and  we  consider  the  role  of  the  placebo  effect  in  assessing 
the  utility  of  psychedelics.  Combination  therapies  and  di-
verse psychosocial interventions are considered. We provide 
recommendations  for  alternative  metrics  that  might  better 
capture  the  effects  of  psychedelics  than  traditional  outcome 
measures.  The  potential  for  Machine  Learning  (ML)  and 

other  advanced  computational  analysis  strategies  to  predict 
the  outcomes  of  psychedelic-assisted  therapies  is  discussed. 
Finally, we consider the use of psychedelics beyond treating 
trauma-related disorders, for the purposes of personal growth 
in  promoting  psychological  wellness  and  resilience,  as  well 
as  presenting  the  possibility  that  psychedelics  may  hold 
promise to facilitate societal healing. 

2. PTSD OVERVIEW 

2.1. Phenomenology and Epidemiology   

Post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  is  a  specific  psy-
chological response that can develop following exposure to a 
traumatic event. It is characterized by the presence of symp-
toms  across  four  distinct  symptom  clusters:  functional  im-
pairment  and  disruption  in  interpersonal,  occupational,  and 
social  domains,  and  chronicity  of  symptoms  [45].  The  first 
of  the  four  symptom  clusters  involves  repeated,  unwanted, 
intrusive  thoughts  about  the  traumatic  event,  which  can  oc-
cur  in  response  to  direct  reminders  as  well  as  unprovoked. 
Such  intrusions  might  take  the  form  of  memories,  night-
mares,  or  flashbacks  or  may  involve  re-experiencing  the 
emotions  or  physiological  sensations  that  a  person  had  dur-
ing  the  traumatic  event.  The  distress  caused  by  these  intru-
sions  may  lead  to  the  second  category  of  symptoms,  which 
involves  avoidance  of  thoughts  and  feelings  related  to  the 
trauma, as well as avoidance of people, places, and situations 
that might lead to remembering the traumatic event. Avoid-
ance can be present through the use of distractions or mind-
altering substances, changes in a person’s routines, or disen-
gagement  from  conversations  or  activities,  among  other  be-
haviors. The urge to avoid reminders of the trauma may also 
be  driven  by  the  third  cluster  of  symptoms,  which  involves 
negative beliefs and emotions. Such beliefs may encompass 
broader  thoughts  about  self,  others,  or  the  world  or  may  in-
clude distorted levels of blame regarding the event. Persistent 
negative emotions may also be present, such as guilt, shame, 
or  anger,  and  conversely,  people  with  PTSD  may  have  diffi-
culty  experiencing  positive  feelings.  Finally,  in  response  to 
trauma,  many  individuals  experience  increased  arousal;  in 
other  words,  their  bodies  express  responses  to  trauma  in  a 
variety of ways that can involve behavioral reactions such as 
expressions  of  anger,  aggression,  or  reckless  behavior,  as 
well as tension and hypervigilance, pronounced startle reac-
tions, or difficulties with sleep and concentration. 

  Most individuals exposed to a traumatic event experience 
some  combination  of  these  symptoms  in  the  acute  period 
following  a  traumatic  event,  which  is  understood  to  be  a 
form of self-preservation [46]. It is the lack of natural resolu-
tion over time and the sustained effects of emotional distress 
and impaired daily functioning that lead to the clinical diag-
nosis  of  PTSD  [47].  Such  diagnosis  is  typically  given  no 
sooner  than  one  month  after  the  trauma,  in  part  because  of 
these  acute  stress  reactions;  over  the  course  of  the  first 
months  following  a  trauma,  rates  of  traumatic  stress  symp-
tomatology decrease significantly [46, 48]. A review of lon-
gitudinal  studies  found  that  few  cases  of  PTSD  emerge  for 
the first time after the first 3 months [49]. However, there is 
a  “delayed  expression”  subtype  of  PTSD,  in  which  an  indi-
vidual does not meet full diagnostic criteria until 6 months or 
longer after the traumatic event [50]. This specifier may not

be accurately represented in many reviews due to short study 
periods that do not capture the later emergence of symptoms; 
additionally, methods of estimation calculations, differences 
in  populations,  and  inconsistent  symptom  scales  can  all  im-
pact  the  measurement  of  delayed  expression  prevalence. 
Rates of delayed onset have been calculated by multiple sys-
tematic reviews as approximately 24% of all cases of PTSD 
[51,  52],  with  significantly  higher  rates  in  military  popula-
tions as compared with civilian populations  [53]. Systematic 
reviews  have  found  that  while  it  is  rare  for  the  very  first 
signs  of  PTSD  to  occur  after  6  months,  it  is  not  as  uncom-
mon  for  individuals  with  delayed  expression  to  have  some 
subthreshold  symptoms  that  increase  to  meet  full  criteria 
after  some  time  [53,  54].  It  should  be  noted  that  symptom 
trajectories  for  PTSD  are  generally  heterogeneous;  some  de-
layed  expression  may  be  influenced  by  additional  triggering 
events,  and  the  effects  of  earlier  subthreshold  symptoms  on 
delayed  expression  diagnoses  need  to  be  further  elucidated 
[53, 54].  Diagnoses of PTSD are given following assessment 
of  trauma-related  symptoms  within  the  context  of  criteria 
specified  in  diagnostic  manuals  such  as  the  Diagnostic  and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5) 
[55] or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases 
and Related Health Problems 11th Edition (ICD-11) [56]. 

  The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  has  measured 
lifetime exposure to trauma as 70.4%, with an average of 2.9 
traumatic events experienced [57]. The global prevalence of 
PTSD  has  been  calculated  at  3.9%,  or  5.6%  of  trauma-
exposed individuals, though these numbers vary significantly 
between  countries  [58,  59].  The  variation  may  be  due  to  a 
number  of  factors,  including  the  prevalence  of  trauma,  cul-
tural  differences  in  conceptualizations  of  trauma,  stigma 

against  disclosure,  and  normalization  of  distress  [59].  The 
most commonly reported traumatic experiences globally are 
the unexpected death of a loved one and exposure to death or 
serious injury [57]. However, these experiences are less like-
ly to result in PTSD than less common events such as rape or 
assault. A survey of adults in the United States (US) indicat-
ed  that  89.7%  of  individuals  had  experienced  at  least  one 
DSM-5  Criterion  A  traumatic  event,  and  8.3%  were  deter-
mined  to  have  met  criteria  for  PTSD  in  their  lifetime  in  re-
sponse to a specific Criterion A event [1]. PTSD prevalence 
is ~6-8% in the general population of the U.S., increasing to 
~25% in those who have undergone severe trauma, including 
combat veterans, refugees, and assault victims [60, 61]. The 
measurements associated with epidemiological data are var-
ied,  with  prevalence  rates  dependent  on  diagnostic  methods 
and data collection procedures, among other factors [62, 63]. 

  Despite  the  variation  of  measurement,  epidemiology 
studies  report  some  global  consistencies.  The  number  of 
trauma exposures is correlated with increased prevalence and 
impairment  related  to  PTSD,  as  well  as  a  younger  age  of 
onset [64], and individuals with a history of trauma in child-
hood  have  a  higher  risk  of  developing  PTSD  in  adulthood 
[65]. PTSD is more likely to occur in victims of interperson-
al  violence,  including  rape,  abuse,  and  assault,  as  well  as 
among  those  exposed  to  combat,  torture,  or  kidnapping  [1, 
62].  Interpersonal  traumas  are  the  most  frequently  reported 
traumatic event for persons who meet the criteria for PTSD 
[58]  and  have  the  highest  conditional  risk,  though  the  fre-
quency  of  unexpected  losses  of  loved  ones  leads  to  a  high 
percentage  of  individuals  with  PTSD  reporting  this  experi-
ence despite the lower conditional risk [57]. 

 
 
The Psychedelic Future of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    641 

  Despite this variability in conditional risk, and the impact 
of the type of traumatic event on subsequent symptomatolo-
gy,  there  is  insufficient  research  into  how  this  might  affect 
the  full  symptom  profile  or  treatment  efficacy.  One  factor 
that may influence the high conditional risk of interpersonal 
trauma is that it can lead to greater rumination on an individ-
ual’s  own  role  in  the  event  and  possibly  subsequent  blame, 
shame, or guilt than they might experience following an im-
personal event such as a natural disaster [66]. Conversely, in 
developing  nations,  the  conditional  risk  of  natural  disasters 
may be higher, possibly due to the more impairing impact of 
resource  loss  [67],  which  could  lead  to  a  different  PTSD 
symptom  profile  than  an  individual  who  develops  PTSD 
following  an  assault.  Such  differences  are  important  to  ex-
amine in the context of understanding both the development 
of PTSD and the appropriate treatment modalities. 

2.2. Individual Risk Factors 

In addition to the type of trauma experienced, individuals 
may  be  impacted  differently  depending  on  a  wide  array  of 
psychological,  historical,  sociological,  and  biological  risk 
factors, as well as their communities, environments, person-
ality  traits,  and  developmental  histories.  Reports  may  differ 
between  countries  due  to  varying  societal  stigmas  or  socio-
political  environments  [68],  and  social  or  gender-based  dif-
ferences  may  relate  to  the  higher  rates  of  PTSD  among 
women than men [1, 58, 60]. The availability and quality of 
social support after a trauma is a strong determinant of post-
traumatic stress [69], with negative social interactions related 
to the trauma (e.g., blame, notably more common for wom-
en)  having  a  particularly  strong  impact  on  risk  for  chronic 
PTSD  [62].  Disadvantaged  social,  intellectual,  and  educa-
tional status, as well as certain minority racial or ethnic iden-
tities, are also determinants of PTSD risk [47, 62, 69, 70]. 

Potential  heritability  of  PTSD  has  been  established 
through  studies  of  twins  [71,  72].  Other  evidence  also 
demonstrates  that  PTSD  appears  to  run  in  families.  For  ex-
ample, children of parents with PTSD are significantly more 
likely to develop PTSD in response to trauma [73, 74]. How-
ever, these observations only imply the influence of genetic, 
epigenetic, and environmental factors on heritability. Specif-
ic genes for PTSD have not been identified, but large consor-
tia have detected a series of genes that are considered to in-
crease the risk for PTSD according to trauma type and gen-
der  [75].  Different  symptom  clusters  (e.g.,  avoidance)  are 
reported to be associated with greater genetic influence than 
others  (e.g.,  re-experiencing)  [72].  Risks  related  to  the  de-
velopment  of  PTSD  in  response  to  specific  types  of  trauma 
can also have a genetic influence (e.g., greater genetic herit-
ability for PTSD resulting from assaultive trauma [76]). Fac-
tors that can be considered heritable through both natural and 
environmental  impact,  including  personality  types  [77],  at-
tachment  styles  [78],  and  childhood  exposure  to  adverse 
events  or  family  environmental  stressors  [79],  have  also  all 
been associated with increased risk of developing PTSD af-
ter a traumatic event.  

2.3. Protective Factors 

Protective factors that aid in psychological recovery fol-
lowing  trauma  include  strong  social  support  [62]  and  a  se-

cure  attachment  style,  which  may  assist  individuals  in  re-
sponding to and adapting to traumatic loss [80]. Such factors 
might mitigate the development of PTSD. Early experiences 
of  stability  and  quality  caregiving  can  increase  resilience, 
and  it  is  possible  that  exposure  to  nontraumatic  but  still 
stressful  events  during  development  can  help  individuals 
develop  greater  abilities  to  cope  with  future  stressors  [81]. 
Emotion regulation, including executive functioning, as well 
as  cognitive  flexibility  and  more  conscious  cognitive  reap-
praisal  strategies,  are  linked  to  psychological  resilience  fol-
lowing trauma [81]. Such protective factors may also be en-
hanced by above-average cognitive capacity, through which 
an individual may be able to reduce more persistent negative 
effects  of  trauma  exposure  due  to  higher-order  cognitive 
reasoning and verbal encoding of traumatic events [62]. 

2.4. Prognosis  

  The prognosis for PTSD is highly variable due to its het-
erogeneity, exemplified by a wide range of remission rates in 
various  studies,  from  6-92%  [82-84].  Most  individuals  who 
undergo  a  traumatic  experience  will  meet  the  criteria  for 
Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) soon after the event as part of a 
normal  trauma  response,  but  a  majority  of  these  cases  will 
spontaneously  resolve  in  the  first  few  weeks  following  the 
event  [48].  For  those  diagnosed  with  PTSD,  approximately 
one-third  will  no  longer  meet  the  criteria  for  PTSD  after 
three  months,  while  ~40%  will  have  a  chronic  course  [49]. 
Between  18%-50%  of  patients  experience  stable  recovery 
within  3-7  years,  with  the  remaining  persons  demonstrating 
either a recurrent or chronic course [84]. Typically, untreated 
PTSD  that  does  not  self-resolve  improves  gradually,  with 
symptoms never fully dissipating [82]. A meta-analysis of 42 
studies,  including  a  total  of  81,642  participants,  found  the 
average remission rate of adults with PTSD to be 44% over 
the  course  of  40  months  [85].  Approximately  30%  of  pa-
tients will not have full remission of symptoms even after 10 
years [86]. Notably, even for patients who undergo treatment 
and no longer meet the criteria for PTSD, residual and possi-
bly functionally impairing symptoms can remain [87-89]. 

  Hyperarousal  and  dissociation  symptoms  are  predictive 
of  more  severe  disease  and  suicidality  [83].  Other  factors 
that  predict  poorer  prognosis  are  intensity  of  the  traumatic 
event,  time  elapsed  since  first  encounter  with  the  traumatic 
event, female gender, younger age, and illiteracy [90]. Based 
on  a  machine  learning  (ML)  model  that  considered  type  of 
traumatic event, sociodemographic characteristics, and prior 
history  of  mental  health  disorders  and  trauma  exposure, 
traumatic  events  associated  with  the  highest  proportions  of 
PTSD cases were unexpected death of a loved one, rape, and 
sexual assault, and this was in line with a broader pattern of 
interpersonal  violence  accounting  for  the  largest  risk  for 
PTSD  [70].  Traumatic  events  that  were  intentionally  perpe-
trated  were  more  predictive  of  a  diagnosis  of  PTSD  in  vic-
tims  than  traumatic  events  that  were  unintentional  [49]. 
Comorbid psychiatric disorders and physical disease are pre-
dictive of long-term course, while social supports are predic-
tive of shorter course [84]. 

  Overall, PTSD is associated with a quantitative reduction 
in quality of life [91]. Partially due to physical and psychiat-
ric comorbidities, patients with PTSD show increased hospi-

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

talizations and healthcare utilization compared with the gen-
eral  population  [92,  93].  Individuals  with  PTSD  experience 
lost  productivity,  averaging  42.7  lost  days  of  work  per  year 
[94].  Relationship  problems  are  more  prevalent  in  PTSD 
patients and can lead to significant distress [95]. 

PTSD  predisposes  individuals  to  suicide,  with  lifetime 
suicidal  ideation  1.9  times  higher  [96]  and  suicide  attempts 
twice the rate as in the general population when controlling 
for  socioeconomic  characteristics  and  comorbid  conditions 
[96-98]. Patients with MDD who have comorbid PTSD have 
2.5 times the risk of subsequent suicide attempts when com-
pared  with  patients  having  MDD  without  comorbid  PTSD 
[99].  Further  discussion  of  the  common  comorbidities  and 
their  prevalence  rates  in  association  with  PTSD  is  provided 
in Section 2.9. 

2.5. Brief History of the Development of the PTSD Diag-
nosis  

  Though the diagnosis of PTSD is relatively new, the im-
pact  of  trauma  on  psychological  functioning  has  been  de-
scribed throughout history and literature. The modern history 
of  PTSD  begins  in  the  19th  century  when  the  effects  of 
trauma were highlighted by early experts in the field of psy-
chology and psychoanalysis, including in Breuer and Freud’s 
“Studies on Hysteria” (1895) and Kraepelin’s “fright neuro-
sis” (1896) [100-102]. The concept of “Railway Spine,” pro-
posed in the mid-1800s, was an early attempt to explain psy-
chological  sequelae  to  trauma  through  a  physical  lens.  In-
flammation of the spine was posited as a core factor in post-
traumatic reactions following railway collisions; psychologi-
cal factors, such as hysteria and neurasthenia, were incorpo-
rated into this theory over time, but this fundamental attribu-
tion of traumatic symptoms to spinal injury led to treatments 
that  did  not  adequately  address  psychological  needs  [103-
105]. Militaries began to recognize the impact of trauma on 
psychological functioning, defining terms such as “soldier’s 
heart” (Civil War) [67, 106] and “shell shock” (World War I) 
[107, 108], among others [67, 100, 109, 110]. However, the-
se were also often attributed to physical causes: “disordered 
action of the heart” during the South African War was con-
sidered a result of the exertion of equipment and webbing on 
a soldier’s chest; “shell shock” in World War I was initially 
considered a result of exploding shells; and “Gulf War Syn-
drome”  was  hypothesized  to  be  related  to  toxins  to  which 
soldiers  were  exposed  (as  reviewed  in  Jones,  2006)  [111]. 
The  terms  “KZ  Syndrome”  and  “concentration  camp  syn-
drome”  arose  when  survivors  of  Nazi  concentration  camps 
were  observed  to  exhibit  anxiety,  irritability,  concentration 
disturbance, sleep disorders, and flashbacks, and these were 
thought  to  be  a  medical  process  of  accelerated  aging  [112, 
113]. 

It is only recently that the psychological effects of trauma 
have  become  increasingly  accepted  and  explored  in  a  more 
official  and  academic  manner.  While  the  concept  of  “gross 
stress disorder” was included in the first edition of the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-I) [114] in 1952, it was 
removed when the second edition was published in 1968 [67, 
115] (DSM-II). In this second edition, there was still a cate-
gory  of  “transient  situational  disturbances”  that  included 
“adjustment  reactions,”  but  these  highlighted  a  belief  at  the 

time that traumatic stress was transient rather than enduring 
and instructed alternative diagnoses to be given if the symp-
toms  persist  after  the  index  stressor  is  removed  (DSM-II) 
[115].  Prior  to  the  publication  of  the  next  edition,  however, 
there  was  a  shift  in  societal  views  of  survivors  of  trauma. 
This  era  involved  greater  attention  to  and  awareness  of  the 
effects  of  child  abuse,  rape,  and  interpersonal  violence,  and 
research  into  child  abuse  syndrome,  rape  trauma  syndrome, 
and battered women’s syndrome increased [67]. Additional-
ly, veterans of the Vietnam War experiencing post-traumatic 
reactions were highlighted in advocacy for better awareness 
of  the  impact  of  war.  Thus,  a  set  of  symptoms  was  formal-
ized  into  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  (PTSD)  in  the 
Third  Edition  of  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual 
(DSM-III)  in  1980  [116].  While  including  this  diagnostic 
category  in  the  DSM  provided  some  benefits,  including 
treatment  access  and  support  for  survivors,  controversy  ex-
isted  regarding  the  pathologizing  of  natural  reactions  to 
trauma, as well as possible legal or societal repercussions. 

  The  defined  criteria  for  this  disorder  have  continued  to 
evolve as research expands our understanding of trauma and 
PTSD; while each iteration of the DSM aims to improve the 
diagnostic criteria based on increasing empirical understand-
ing  of  trauma-related  symptoms,  significant  difficulties  re-
main  that  are  associated  with  defining  and  categorizing  the 
disorder. Many aspects of the development and presentation 
of PTSD are not yet well understood, and between different 
diagnostic manuals (e.g., the DSM-5 and the ICD-11), crite-
ria vary. The various definitions of PTSD have attempted to 
define  phenomenology  and  have  not  particularly  taken  into 
account the genetic, epigenetic, environmental, or social fac-
tors  that  can  influence  trauma  reactions  in  both  normative 
and maladaptive ways. In the process of elucidating risk fac-
tors for PTSD, there is a tendency to pathologize biological, 
physiological,  and  psychological  changes  that  result  from 
trauma, while some may actually reflect adaptive responses. 
The ubiquitous role of traumatic stress in mental and physi-
cal  illness  emphasizes  the  importance  of  developing  treat-
ments  that  are  less  focused  on  reversing  specific  symptoms 
of PTSD but rather allow for an inquiry into and evaluation 
of the role of stress from existential, physical, psychological, 
social, and spiritual perspectives. The current understanding 
of  the  underlying  biological,  psychological,  and  social  as-
pects  of  this  diagnosis,  as  well  as  contemporary  treatment 
options, will be discussed further in the following sections. 

2.6. PTSD Assessment & Diagnosis 

  Evaluating  PTSD  can  pose  diagnostic  challenges.  This 
may be a result of the disorder’s heterogeneous presentation 
[117-119]  and  variability  in  PTSD  symptom  onset  [57]. 
PTSD symptoms can overlap with symptoms of other disor-
ders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic dis-
order, and specific phobias, further complicating assessment 
and diagnostic processes [120]. Stigma and shame surround-
ing  trauma,  as  well  as  avoidance,  may  pose  challenges  for 
individuals  to  accurately  identify  and  describe  their  symp-
toms and can lead to underreporting [121, 122]. Trauma sur-
vivors  may  seek  PTSD  treatment  not  only  to  alleviate  their 
symptoms  but  also  for  validation  of  their  survivor  status  or 
compensation claims, which can give rise to concerns related 
to secondary gain [10, 123]. Clinicians should also consider 

 
 
The Psychedelic Future of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    643 

potential  cultural  variations  in  the  expression  of  trauma-
related  symptoms,  coping  strategies,  and  communication 
styles  [124],  all  of  which  may  influence  the  process  of  as-
sessment  for  PTSD.  Given  these  notable  challenges,  it  is 
crucial  that  clinicians  receive  specialized  training  in  the  as-
sessment and diagnosis of PTSD to ensure accurate and ap-
propriate treatment [2, 119, 125]. Techniques might include 
asking open-ended questions to elicit information about rele-
vant events, taking a comprehensive trauma history, and us-
ing a variety of assessment tools to measure the full range of 
symptoms [125, 126]. 

Specific assessment procedures may vary and can consist 
of  a  range  and  combination  of  approaches  [47],  including 
initial screenings for exposure to traumatic events and prob-
able  PTSD,  comprehensive  structured  and  semi-structured 
clinical  interviews,  and  symptom  severity  self-report  ques-
tionnaires [47, 127]. Clinicians should also assess the severi-
ty and time frame of PTSD symptoms. This can involve the 
use  of  standardized  diagnostic  tools,  such  as  the  Clinician-
Administered  PTSD  Scale  for  DSM-5  (CAPS-5)  [128]  or 
Structured  Clinical  Interview  of  DSM-V  Disorders  (SCID-
V) [129], which can provide a systematic and structured ap-
proach to PTSD assessment. It is also important to consider 
the dynamic nature of PTSD, as some individuals may expe-
rience a chronic and persistent course of symptoms. In con-
trast, others may experience episodic symptoms that are trig-
gered by specific events or situations [58]. 

2.7. Neurobiology of PTSD  

  The  neurobiology  of  PTSD  (Fig.  1)  can  be  considered 
through  a  framework  of  sensitization  and  recalibration,  in 
which  the  activation  of  neurological  systems  and  structures 
in  response  to  trauma-related  cues  occurs  more  intensely, 
and the signals to end such responses are less effective. Early 
research  reported  that  individuals  with  PTSD  experience 
more  intense  startle  responses,  as  demonstrated  through  au-
tonomic  and  physiological  reactions,  than  trauma-exposed 
individuals  without  PTSD,  and  there  is  a  slower  return  to 
baseline  following  these  reactions  [130,  131].  These  studies 
were extended through neuroimaging research that examined 
neurological  responses  to  fear-related  stimuli.  For  example, 
in  response  to  images  of  fearful  faces,  individuals  with 
PTSD demonstrated increased activation of the amygdala, a 
brain  structure  associated  with  arousal  and  fear  response 
[16].  Concurrently,  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex  (mPFC), 
associated with attenuation of the fear response, showed less 
activation  than  in  a  sample  of  healthy  controls  [16].  This 
combination  of  increased  sensitivity  to  triggers  and  de-
creased  ability  to  return  to  baseline  can  lead  to  more  sus-
tained arousal and a lack of habituation to triggers. Dysregu-
lation of emotions in PTSD is associated with complications 
in  the  amygdala  and  mPFC,  as  well  as  the  hippocampus, 
insula,  and  anterior  cingulate  cortex  (Fig.  1).  Excessive 
amygdala response may be regulated in part by hippocampal 
activity, specifically that involved in cognitive flexibility and 
the  formation  of  new  associations  [132].  The  hippocampus 
has  been  a  structure  of  interest  in  PTSD  research  due  to  its 
influence on memory and information processing, which are 
often  impaired  in  individuals  with  PTSD  (Fig.  1).  Smaller 
hippocampal volume is associated with a risk of developing 
PTSD  [59, 133, 134], and may be related to difficulty con-

textualizing  and  re-interpreting  a  traumatic  event  in  a  way 
that  facilitates  recovery  [132].  Impaired  or  insufficient  con-
textual processing in the hippocampus may also be related to 
the  generalization  of  an  exaggerated  response  to  trauma-
related  triggers  [132].  Individuals  with  PTSD  have  also 
demonstrated decreased activity in the precuneus [17, 135], a 
structure  in  the  parietal  lobe  related  to  self-consciousness 
and  processing,  as  well  as  episodic  memory  retrieval  and 
mental imagery [136]. Greater decreases in precuneal activi-
ty correlate with greater PTSD symptom severity [17, 135]], 
and  may  relate  to  memory  retrieval  deficits,  dissociation 
[135],  and  the  ability  to  relate  memories  to  current  context 
[17].   

In  PTSD  literature,  these  structures  and  processes  have 
been  related  to  the  concepts  of  fear  conditioning  and  fear 
extinction. Fear conditioning is based on the classical learn-
ing  paradigm  wherein  fear  is  induced  by  pairing  a  neutral 
(cue or context) conditioned stimulus (CS) with an aversive 
unconditioned  stimulus  known  to  invoke  a  fear  response 
(e.g., trauma), with the later consequence of CS presentation 
independently  eliciting  fear.  Fear  extinction  occurs  upon 
repeated  exposures  to  the  CS;  without  exposure  to  an  aver-
sive unconditioned stimulus, the fear response gradually de-
clines.  Early  research  into  fear  conditioning  and  extinction 
relied  on  animal  models,  providing  direction  toward  the 
amygdala  as  a  primary  structure  of  fear  responses  and  the 
prefrontal  cortex  as  central  to  emotion  regulation  (as  re-
viewed by Milad and Quirk [15]).  However, animal models, 
in  general,  are  limited  in  regard  to  their  generalizability  to 
humans, and often, the methods used to simulate trauma and 
PTSD in animal models insufficiently incorporate the unique 
factors  that  lead  to  human  vulnerability  and  resilience  to 
PTSD  [18].  Furthermore,  the  PTSD  response  is  not  just  a 
matter  of  fear  but  also  other  characteristics  that  can  include 
shame,  guilt,  and  moral  injury.  It  is  important  to  note  that 
while  exposure-based  therapies  may  attempt  to  extinguish  a 
conditioned fear response, the repeated provocation of mate-
rial  that  provokes  shame  and  guilt  may  be  intolerable  and 
lead  to  a  worsening  of  symptoms.    These  are  the  types  of 
subtleties  not  captured  by  animal  models  of  fear  extinction. 
While  some  of  the  human  research  into  the  brain  regions 
indicated as important in animal research is described below, 
it is important to expand beyond the neurobiological factors 
indicated  by  animal  fear  models  of  PTSD,  to  account  for  a 
more complete human and psychological experience. 

  Nonetheless,  it  is  certainly  the  case  that  when  the  fear 
conditioning model has been applied to patients with PTSD, 
it  has  been  demonstrated  that  stress  during  childhood  and 
PTSD in adults are both associated with cortical atrophy and 
decreased  PFC  and  anterior  cingulate  cortex  (ACC)  volume 
[137].  These  contribute  to  cortical  hypoactivation  that  im-
pairs  the  extinction  of  fear  responses  and  top-down  inhibi-
tion of reactivity to emotional stimuli [137]. In a study using 
fMRI to investigate the circuitry of stimulus-induced positive 
emotional  processing,  it  was  found  that  hippocampal/ 
parahippocampal  activation  was  lower  in  participants  with 
PTSD  compared  with  matched  controls  when  exposed  to 
positive  stimuli  [138]  and  hyperactivated  in  these  same  re-
gions when exposed to negative stimuli [139]. This elevated 
activity  has  been  associated  with  heightened  amygdala  acti-
vation [140, 141], though the amygdala of people with PTSD

Fig. (1). The human brain as affected by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The regions of the brain associated with changes in response 
to trauma and stress include the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. The amygdala, an area of the brain known for emotional pro-
cessing and fear conditioning, has shown increased activation as well as increased functional connectivity with other regions, including the 
insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), in PTSD patients [144]. The hippocampus, a region known for the critical role it plays in memory 
consolidation,  is  also  affected  by  PTSD,  with  patients  showing  decreased  volume  and  functionality  [59,  133,  134].  The  prefrontal  cortex, 
which is involved in cognitive control and emotional regulation, is also altered in PTSD, with reduced activity and resting state functional 
connectivity during cognitive tasks [143, 145]. Furthermore, recent PTSD fMRI imaging studies have found hyperactivation in the amygdala, 
decreased  connectivity  between  amygdala  and  mPFC,  increased  connectivity  between  the  amygdala  and  hypothalamus/brainstem,  and  de-
creased activity in the Default Mode Network (DMN) (ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), inferior parietal lobe (IPL), posterior cingu-
late cortex (PCC)) and Central Executive Network (CEN) (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC)) [146]. The-
se findings suggest that PTSD’s effects result in complex changes in brain structure and function involving multiple regions and networks, as 
represented in this figure. (A higher resolution/colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article). 

has also been found to be more active while in a resting state, 
not only in response to stimuli [17].  

  There  may  be  an  overall  decrease  in  hippocampus-
amygdala coupling [142] and increased connectivity between 
the amygdala and the insula as well as the ACC, which could 
relate  to  fear  acquisition,  anticipation  of  negative  events, 
contextualization  of  threat  and  safety,  and  re-experiencing 
symptoms  of  PTSD  [142].  Together,  these  findings  indicate 
that individuals with PTSD assign a dysfunctional amount of 
salience  and  personal/autobiographical  meaning  to  negative 
stimuli  [143],  and  may  experience  deficiencies  in  emotion 
regulation  or  cognitive  control  over  emotional  responses 
[142]. Coupled with reduced top-down modulation from the 
frontal lobe, this may facilitate the hyper-reactive responses 
characteristic of PTSD [143]. 

  However,  neurological  responses  associated  with  PTSD 
are not universal, and different patterns may relate to differ-
ent  forms  of  symptom  expression.  PTSD  can  involve  defi-
ciencies in emotion appraisal, management, and resolution - 
functions associated with activity in the ACC and prefrontal 
cortex (PFC) [143]  (Fig.  1). A dynamic tension can be ob-
served between two extremes of emotional dysregulation that 
are representative of PTSD: The intensification of emotions, 
caused by an under-modulation of the emotional response, is 
associated with diminished activity in the PFC (Fig. 1). Con-

versely, emotional numbness and detachment, relating to an 
over-modulated  response,  can  be  connected  to  heightened 
inhibition  of  limbic  regions  [147].  For  individuals  who  pre-
sent with the dissociative subtype of PTSD, such hypoarous-
al  has  been  characterized  by  abnormally  high  activation  of 
the  ACC  and  mPFC  in  response  to  trauma  narratives  and 
hyperinhibition  of  limbic  regions,  including  the  amygdala 
and hippocampus [148].   

  This  pattern  of  dysregulation  in  which  stress-activated 
symptoms appear to be unconstrained, leading to hyperreac-
tivity, is also recapitulated in the endocrine axis [2]. One of 
the  key  pathways  in  the  neurobiological  response  to  trauma 
is  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)  axis  [149-151], 
which  is  activated  acutely  following  exposure  to  a  stressor. 
The  response  involves  a  hormonal  cascade  that  leads  to  the 
release  of  cortisol:  the  hypothalamus  releases  corticotropin-
releasing  hormone  (CRH),  which  travels  to  the  pituitary 
gland, where it stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH). ACTH then acts on the adrenal cortex to 
cause the release of cortisol, the glucocorticoid hormone that 
regulates the body’s response to stress, as well as adrenaline 
(epinephrine)  and  norepinephrine.  After  an  acute  stress 
event,  cortisol  serves  as  a  negative  feedback  mechanism, 
inhibiting  the  hypothalamus  and  pituitary  gland  and  thus 
containing the catecholamine system and reducing the levels 
of adrenaline.

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    645 

In  addition  to  fear  conditioning  and  extinction  models, 
the role of guilt and shame have been strongly implicated in 
the  development  of  PTSD  [21,  152].  These  emotions  have 
been  implicated  in  the  Default  Mode  Network  (DMN)  and 
Salience  Network  (SN),  structures  that  are  related  to  self-
focused  emotions  [153].  Potential  increases  in  DMN  func-
tioning may lead to rumination and preoccupation with nega-
tive evaluation of one’s actions, while potential increases in 
SN  functioning  might  impact  emotional  reactivity,  and  in-
creased  integration  between  these  systems  may  increase  the 
impact  of  guilt  on  re-experiencing  symptoms  [21].  Shame, 
conversely,  may  be  related  to  negative  evaluations  of  the 
self,  and  associated  with  possible  reduced  functioning  in 
these  areas  and  thus  reduced  introspection  and  increased 
likelihood  of  dissociation  [21].   In  individuals  diagnosed 
with  PTSD,  recall  of  morally  injurious  events  appears  to 
initiate blame-related processing of physiological experienc-
es; this is demonstrated in the SN and subsequently induces 
emotional  and  cognitive  changes  in  service  of  numbing  or 
detaching [154]. 

It should be noted in both animal and human models that 
the heterogeneity of behavioral changes is a vital considera-
tion in creating nuanced models of PTSD. Trauma exposure 
can  lead  to  significant  differences  in  both  behavioral  and 
neurological  responses  depending  on  an  animal’s  level  of 
fearfulness  and  prior  adaptability  [155].  Studies  have 
demonstrated that the chronic exposure of rodents to gluco-
corticoids  leads  to  synaptic  dysfunction  and  atrophy  of  the 
PFC  and  hippocampus,  areas  of  the  brain  where  similar 
structural changes have been seen in patients with PTSD and 
depression  [156,  157].  This  is  both  relevant  for  modeling 
human behavior and is an important consideration related to 
the  limits  of  animal  research  that  may  not  account  for  such 
individual differences. 

  As a group, patients with PTSD often exhibit lower am-
bient  cortisol  levels.  Prospective  studies  have  demonstrated 
that  cortisol  levels  are  also  lower  before  and  shortly  after  a 
traumatic event, suggesting that an attenuated glucocorticoid 
response to trauma may perpetuate sympathetic nervous sys-
tem  activation,  possibly  facilitating  the  consolidation  of 
traumatic memories [59, 73, 158]. In contrast, a strong emo-
tional memory can, at times, be considered protective in that 
it can aid an individual in identifying potential danger should 
the threat that caused the trauma continue; in this context, the 
memory leads to maladaptive levels of distress and generali-
zation of triggers even once the acute threat is no longer ap-
plicable. Additionally, PTSD is associated with greater num-
bers of glucocorticoid receptors, which are required for corti-
sol to induce the stress response, and these receptors are also 
demonstrably more responsive [73]. Hypersensitivity to cor-
tisol in patients with PTSD has been a commonly reproduced 
finding  in  the  literature  [149,  159-161].  Evidence  of  gluco-
corticoid  responsivity  has  been  observed  using  a  number  of 
neuroendocrine  challenge  strategies  such  as  the  low-dose 
dexamethasone  suppression  test  [160-162],  the  metyrapone 
stimulation test [163, 164], and in vitro glucocorticoid recep-
tor challenges using lysozyme to stimulate immune function 
in  live  lymphocytes  [165].  More  recently,  glucocorticoid 
receptor  responsiveness  has  been  demonstrated  in  induced 
neurons  derived  from  pluripotent  stem  cells  reprogrammed 

from  skin  cells  in  combat  veterans  with  PTSD  [166].  The 
glucocorticoid receptors at which cortisol acts can also bind 
chaperone proteins, such as FK506, which lowers their affin-
ity for cortisol. FK506 and the gene that regulates it, FKBP5, 
have  thus  been  of  particular  interest  in  PTSD  research,  as 
they may provide valuable insight into the cortisol response. 

It  should  be  noted  that  there  is  variability  in  hormonal 
markers within and across many groups of trauma survivors, 
reflecting  both  the  reactive  nature  of  hormones  to  environ-
mental perturbations (consistent with their function) and the 
methodological  challenges  in  capturing  ambient  baseline 
states.  Still,  numerous  studies  using  sophisticated  neuroen-
docrine  challenges  have  been  able  to  identify  perturbations 
in both catecholamine and neuroendocrine hormonal systems 
reflective of a system reset that is hyperreactive to environ-
mental cues. 

  While  numerous  neurological  structures  and  circuits  are 
indicated  in  the  characteristics  of  PTSD  (Fig.  1),  broader 
mechanisms of over- or under-modulation of responses lead 
to the symptoms of PTSD, as well as increased sensitivity to 
stress  and  decreased  attenuation  of  the  resultant  responses. 
This causes what may initially be adaptive reactions aimed at 
protecting an individual from danger by increasing their abil-
ity to assess for and react to threats, to generalize and inten-
sify.  If  the  threat  response  is  unable  to  deactivate  appropri-
ately, then it is difficult for an individual to feel safe in any 
context. 

2.8. Other Molecular and Functional Markers of PTSD 

In addition to the neurological processes described above, 
several different types of molecular processes and functional 
biomarkers have been identified as having associations with 
PTSD.  These  biomarkers  are  not  universally  present  in  all 
trauma  survivors  with  PTSD,  however,  and  are  often  influ-
enced by numerous factors, but they can provide insight into 
both risk and recovery.  

  The largest meta-analysis to date regarding gene expres-
sion analysis for PTSD identified a number of differentially 
expressed  genes,  with  interleukin-1ß  (IL1B)  considered  the 
most  significant.  IL1B  is  a  pro-inflammatory  cytokine,  and 
the authors posit that this may relate to the increased rates of 
autoinflammatory  and  autoimmune  disorders  in  individuals 
with  PTSD  [167].  This  meta-analysis  also  identified  differ-
entially  expressed  genes  related  to  cell  growth  and  health, 
anti-bacterial  and  anti-fungal  immunity,    immune  response, 
and  cellular  responses  to  oxidative  stress  [167].  This  meta-
analysis  built  on  prior  research  that  emphasized  the  role  of 
inflammatory  markers  as  targets  for  identification  or  inter-
vention,  although  awareness  of  potential  moderators  (e.g., 
comorbid  depression,  medication  use)  should  be  considered 
[168].  Notably,  inflammatory  markers  in  individuals  who 
have  recovered  from  PTSD  do  not  appear  to  differ  from 
those  with  no  history  of  PTSD;  only  currently  active  PTSD 
appears  to  correlate  with  this  elevated  inflammation  [169]. 
Furthermore,  neuroimaging  studies  have  demonstrated  that 
inflammatory markers are related to functional and structural 
changes  in  the  amygdala,  hippocampus,  and  frontal  cortex 
that are associated with stress and emotional regulation [170] 
(Fig. 1).

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

  The identification of epigenetic marks on genes has also 
been  important  in  PTSD  discovery;  in  fact,  early  studies  of 
epigenetics  focused  on  PTSD  because  epigenetic  marks  can 
be highly influenced by environmental exposures. Epigenetic 
marks are involved in gene regulation and began to be identi-
fied in the 1980s in relation to stress and mental health. Re-
searchers  have  also  found  indications  of  DNA  methylation 
changes associated with psychological symptoms, with some 
evidence  that  certain  gene  methylation  may  be  associated 
with treatment prognosis or symptom severity [171]. Yehuda 
et  al.  evaluated  methylation  changes  in  association  with  the 
glucocorticoid receptor gene in combat veterans with PTSD 
and found correlations between lower methylation in the 1R 
exon promoter of the NR3C1 gene and glucocorticoid activi-
ty [172]. Such changes are important because they may also 
explain many of the changes in immune-related gene expres-
sion in PTSD as well as its association with physical illness-
es  since  glucocorticoids  are  involved  in  both  mental  and 
physical processes. In a previous study of veterans receiving 
prolonged  exposure  to  psychotherapy,  glucocorticoid  recep-
tor  gene  (NR3C1)  methylation  was  assessed  prior  to  treat-
ment  and  was  able  to  predict  treatment  response,  while 
methylation of the FKBP5 gene decreased concurrently with 
symptom decrease [171]. Additionally, measurements of the 
length of telomeres, which are repeating segments at the end 
of  chromosomes  that  promote  genetic  stability,  have  been 
considered  as  potential  biomarkers.  Decreases  in  telomere 
length  are  often  associated  with  signs  of  aging  and  are  hy-
pothesized to occur in the context of PTSD. However, stud-
ies  have  found  that  such  a  marker  is  only  associated  with 
PTSD  when  certain  criteria  are  met.  One  study  found  that 
shortened  telomeres  were  correlated  with  re-experiencing 
symptoms,  but  no  other  symptom  clusters  and  only  early  in 
the  disorder  [173].  Another  study  of  combat-exposed  indi-
viduals  found  that  telomere  length  only  differed  from  con-
trols when adjusting for specific factors, including the severi-
ty of combat exposure, while the use of SSRIs was found to 
be protective against telomere shortening [174]. 

Furthermore,  there  have  been  indications  of  changes  in 
metabolism  [175],  as  well  as  evidence  of  PTSD  biomarkers 
that are linked to metabolic, hepatic, and cardiovascular con-
ditions  [176].  Specific  proteins  associated  with  PTSD  have 
also  been  identified,  as  well  as  differences  in  the  composi-
tion of the gut microbiota between the group with PTSD and 
the trauma-exposed resilient group [177]. These and the pre-
viously discussed biomarkers are examples of a broader un-
derstanding  in  the  field  of  the  myriad  ways  in  which  PTSD 
affects the body, from the molecular to the immunological to 
the  psychological  levels  [178].  As  with  all  aspects  of  the 
disorder, this is an ever-expanding field; while evidence for 
certain  biomarkers  is  strong,  numerous  factors  affect  the 
accuracy  of  these  predictors.  Pre-existing  risk  factors  and 
conditions,  specifics  of  the  trauma  and  symptom  profiles, 
and  environmental  contexts  can  all  impact  the  relevance  of 
these biomarkers for individuals. However, the more clearly 
they  can  be  understood,  the  more  effectively  they  can  be 
used  in  identifying  potential  treatments;  if  specific  bi-
omarkers can correlate with success for certain types of med-
ications  or  psychotherapies,  this  could  allow  for  more  suc-
cessful, individualized treatment opportunities. 

2.9. Common Co-occurring Disorders 

In patients with PTSD, comorbidity with other disorders 
is  common  [179],  and  awareness  of  the  potential  co-
occurring  difficulties  that  patients  experience  can  inform 
effective  treatment  planning.  Within  the  general  population, 
an estimated 80+% of individuals with PTSD will experience 
at  least  one  additional  lifetime  mental  health-related  illness, 
and  ~50%  will  experience  three  or  more  psychological 
comorbidities  [180].  Alarmingly,  among  clinical  popula-
tions,  the  rates  of  comorbidity  can  exceed  90%  [180,  181]. 
Common  comorbidities  associated  with  PTSD,  including 
major depressive disorder (MDD), suicidality, substance use 
disorder  (SUD),  anxiety,  chronic  pain,  and  sleep  disruption 
have been studied in the context of PTSD in recent years. In 
considering these high rates of overlap, it is crucial for men-
tal  health  professionals  and  clinical  researchers  to  continue 
the  pursuit  of  a  holistic  conception  of  trauma-related  disor-
ders  that  recognizes  the  ways  in  which  co-occurring  disor-
ders may impact presentation, severity, and treatment as we 
collectively seek novel, empirically-based interventions. 

  MDD is a prevalent comorbidity, with half of diagnosed 
PTSD  patients  concurrently  suffering  from  this  disorder 
[121].  This  combination  contributes  to  serious  distress  for 
patients,  including  worsened  treatment  prognosis  compared 
with  each  disorder  individually,  impaired  neurocognitive 
functioning,  and  increased  risk  of  suicidality  [182,  183].  A 
study  of  U.S.  military  personnel  showed  that  soldiers  diag-
nosed  with  both  MDD  and  PTSD  were  almost  three  times 
more  likely  to  report  seriously  considering  suicide  or  at-
tempting  suicide  within  the  past  year  than  those  with  either 
diagnosis alone [184]. 

Substance  use  disorder  (SUD)  is  another  common 
comorbidity; alcohol use disorder (AUD), in particular, is the 
most  regularly  associated,  with  prevalence  rates  ranging 
from 36%-52% of PTSD patients [185]. A separate epidemi-
ologic  study  reported  that  57.7%  of  those  with  lifetime 
PTSD have had either a lifetime alcohol use disorder (AUD), 
drug use disorder (DUD), or both [186, 187]. Moreover, es-
timates of comorbidity rates have been higher in certain pop-
ulations,  such  as  combat  veterans  [188].  Patients  with  both 
disorders tend to have more severe clinical profiles, are more 
difficult  to  treat,  and  thus  have  poorer  treatment  outcomes 
[185]. 

  Anxiety is often considered to be a common symptom of 
PTSD, but the rate of patients with PTSD who are also clini-
cally  diagnosed  with  generalized  anxiety  disorder  (GAD) 
ranges from 39% to 97% [189]. However, the causation be-
hind  these  wide-ranging  prevalence  rates  of  comorbidity 
cannot easily be ascertained. Though the exact mechanism of 
overlap  between  PTSD  and  anxiety  still  requires  further  re-
search,  the  crossover  and  commonality  of  shared  symptoms 
is  quite  clear.  For  example,  patients  who  have  been  diag-
nosed  with  a  life-threatening  illness  (LTI)  tend  to  struggle 
with  anxiety  and  intrusive  thoughts,  similar  to  symptoms 
common in PTSD [190]. 

  Chronic pain is another comorbidity often seen in PTSD 
patients. The rate of PTSD in patients presenting for chronic 
pain treatment is estimated to be ~10% [191]. Veterans who 
report  having  chronic  pain  are  significantly  more  likely  to 

 
 
 
The Psychedelic Future of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    647 

have a concurrent diagnosis of PTSD, with a rate of PTSD as 
high as 50.1% in this population [192]. Individuals with this 
comorbidity  report  greater  pain,  PTSD  symptoms,  depres-
sion,  anxiety,  and  opioid  use  than  those  with  only  one  of 
these conditions [193]. 

  Difficulties  related  to  sleep  are  another  very  common 
comorbid challenge seen in PTSD patients, with ~50%-70% 
of individuals having co-occurring sleep disorders [194]. The 
underlying  pathophysiological  processes  linked  to  dysregu-
lated circadian rhythms can impede recovery from exposure 
to  trauma  and  undermine  positive  clinical  response  rates  to 
evidence-based PTSD treatments [191, 195]. 

PTSD has also been linked to the development of medi-
cal  issues,  including  cardiovascular,  dermatological,  muscu-
loskeletal, pulmonary, and metabolic diseases. PTSD result-
ing from exposure to war trauma greatly increases the possi-
bility  of  developing  these  somatic  ailments  when  compared 
with  non-combat-exposed  controls  without  PTSD  [196]. 
Additionally,  PTSD  is  frequently  comorbid  with  neurologi-
cal conditions, including post-traumatic epilepsy and chronic 
headaches  [60].  In  general,  PTSD  is  associated  with  in-
creased  general  health  symptoms,  general  medical  condi-
tions,  and  worse  health-related  quality  of  life.  Specifically, 
the severity of pain, cardio-respiratory problems, and gastro-
intestinal  symptoms  were  more  frequently  reported  [197]. 
One potential mechanism for the increased physical illnesses 
is an increase in allostatic load: the accumulation of neurobi-
ological,  behavioral,  and  psychological  stressors  present  in 
PTSD may lead to these additional physical illnesses [198]. 

  The  substantial  question  that  has  arisen  with  respect  to 
comorbidity  is  whether  these  disorders  reflect  true  co-
occurring conditions or are manifestations of the response to 
the same trauma that might have resulted in a greater array of 
consequences  than  can  be  captured  by  the  diagnosis  of 
PTSD.  The other alternative is that PTSD gives rise to sec-
ondary comorbid conditions that occur as the body is trying 
to adapt to the symptoms of PTSD, including poor behavior-
al health habits that may rapidly decrease health. 

2.9.1. Dissociation and PTSD 

In  2013,  a  dissociative  subtype  of  post-traumatic  stress 
disorder (PTSD) was added to the DSM-5 [55]. The subtype 
diagnosis, as defined within the DSM, involves meeting the 
full  criteria  for  PTSD  and  showing  comorbid  “persistent  or 
recurrent”  symptoms  of  derealization  and/or  depersonaliza-
tion. More broadly, dissociation has been viewed as an alter-
ation  in  consciousness  that  includes  changes  in  memory, 
perception,  sense  of  agency,  and  relationship  to  one’s  envi-
ronment  [199].  The  likelihood  of  experiencing  dissociation 
within  the  context  of  an  adverse  traumatic  event  has  been 
linked with threats that are prolonged and repeated, wherein 
the victim recognizes the futility of attempting to escape the 
situation  and  resorts  to  dissociation  as  an  adaptive  defense 
mechanism  [200,  201].  Meeting  the  DSM  criteria  has  also 
been linked with poorer treatment outcomes [202, 203].  

  Later in this paper, we will discuss the use of the dissoci-
ative  anesthetic  ketamine  in  greater  detail.  It  is  critical  here 
to clarify that dissociation is viewed through a different lens 
within the context of the therapeutic potential that psychedel-

ic psychotherapy illustrates, in particular with the use of ket-
amine,  than  it  is  diagnostically  [204,  205].  However,  the 
neurobiological  mechanisms  between  induced  dissociation 
and  trauma-related  dissociation  remain  to  be  further  ex-
plored,  including  similarities  and  differences,  as  well  as  the 
potentially adaptive nature of dissociation. 

2.10. Treatment 

  Treatments,  both  psychological  and  pharmacological, 
have been shown to be effective in improving outcomes for a 
subset  of  PTSD  patients,  although  pre-,  peri-,  and  post-
traumatic risk factors can significantly impact the efficacy of 
treatments  [206].  Some  data  have  supported  the  idea  that 
early interventions can decrease the development of chronic 
PTSD by 50% [207]. Although currently, available therapies 
have  limitations  in  efficacy,  seeking  help  should  still  be  a 
priority of emphasis for those experiencing PTSD symptoms, 
as studies have documented that patients who undergo some 
form of treatment have, on average, a much shorter duration 
of symptoms when compared with patients who do not seek 
treatment [208].  

  Current  treatments  are  focused  on  both  psychotherapy 
and  pharmacotherapy  [47,  206].  Both  strategies  are  often 
employed as first-line treatments [206, 209], but importantly, 
collaborative  decision-making,  which  takes  into  account 
patient  preference  and  clinician  guidance,  is  itself  seen  to 
have therapeutic effects [210]. A comprehensive presentation 
of  the  numerous  available  PTSD  treatment  strategies,  both 
established and experimental, is beyond the scope of the cur-
rent  paper,  but  [206]  provides  an  excellent  recent  compre-
hensive review of this topic. The current section will present 
key highlights of PTSD therapies, including the evidence for 
their use. 

2.10.1. Psychotherapies 

  Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBTs) 
are presently the most validated treatment strategy for PTSD 
[211] and often include imaginal exposure, a revisiting of the 
traumatic experience under the guidance of the therapist [47, 
212],  as  well  as  strategies  to  revise  the  traumatic  memory 
[212]. These therapies are easier to study than longer forms 
of  unstructured  psychodynamic  or  group  psychotherapy, 
although  many  patients  report  that  those  latter  therapies  are 
also helpful to them. In exposure-based therapies, the thera-
pist assists the patient in processing safe but feared stimuli in 
the  absence  of  feared  consequences,  with  the  goal  of  extin-
guishing the automatic fear response (also called fear extinc-
tion)  [47].  So-called  “gold  standard”  psychotherapies  for 
PTSD  include  CBTs  such  as  Cognitive  Processing  Therapy 
(CPT) and Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy [47, 213]. CBT 
involves  targeting  maladaptive  thought  patterns,  emotions, 
and behaviors that may fuel symptoms [47]. CPT is a type of 
cognitive therapy that focuses on utilizing cognitive restruc-
turing to accurately integrate trauma-related information and 
experience with pre-existing belief systems [214]. Prolonged 
Exposure (PE) therapy is an exposure-based psychotherapeu-
tic  strategy  that  involves  four  therapeutic  components:  psy-
choeducation, in vivo exposure, imaginal exposure, and emo-
tional  processing  [215].  Eye  Movement  Desensitization  and 
Reprocessing (EMDR) is also among the most common and 

 
 
648    Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4 

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

recommended psychotherapeutic approaches [47]. In EMDR, 
patients  revisit  traumatic  memories  while  engaging  in  bilat-
eral/saccadic eye movements [47, 216]. 

  Additional  trauma-focused  psychotherapy  strategies  in-
clude  Narrative  Exposure  Therapy  (NET),  which  incorpo-
rates  modified  versions  of  PE  and  TF-CBT  to  focus  on  the 
patient’s life narrative, with the goal of improving the coher-
ence and contextualization of the traumatic experience in the 
context  of  the  person’s  life  [206,  217,  218].  Brief  Eclectic 
Psychotherapy  (BEP)  [219,  220]  is  a  manualized  therapy 
strategy that integrates components of CBT, psychodynamic 
psychotherapy, imaginal exposure, and grief therapy [206]. It 
addresses  the  patient’s  feelings  of  shame,  guilt,  and  anger 
and  emphasizes  the  expression  of  trauma-associated  grief 
[206]. A distinctive feature is that it includes a ritual of clo-
sure, such as writing a letter to the perpetrator of the trauma 
and burning the letter at the end of treatment [206, 221]. 

  Although these approaches are described as “gold stand-
ard,”  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses  reveal  roughly 
similar levels of efficacy and acceptability among these and 
other  psychotherapy  strategies  to  treat  PTSD  [222,  223]. 
Initial  outcomes  appear  strong:  One  meta-analysis  reported 
that patients treated using PE have better outcomes on post-
treatment PTSD measures than individuals treated using con-
trol conditions [180]. A systematic review of clinical trials of 
EMDR  found  that  this  strategy  demonstrated  a  significant 
reduction in PTSD symptoms compared with control condi-
tions, and the majority of studies indicated that it was equally 
effective  as  other  trauma-focused  treatments.   Notably, 
EMDR  may  be  faster  and  more  tolerable  for  patients  in  re-
ducing symptoms [224]. In another meta-analysis of psycho-
therapies for PTSD with a minimum of 12 months follow-up, 
trauma-focused therapy (TFT), CBT, and EMDR were asso-
ciated  with  large  effect  sizes  for  pretest  compared  with  fol-
low-up.  However,  only  small  effect  sizes  were  found  when 
compared  with  non-directive  control  groups  that  included 
treatment  as  usual  (TAU),  social  counseling,  educational 
groups, and Present-Centered Therapy (PCT) [223].  

  Non-trauma-focused  psychotherapies  are  also  available. 
Present-centered 
therapy  (PCT)  [225,  226],  mentioned 
above,  is  a  time-limited  treatment  that  aims  to  improve  the 
patient’s  adaptive  responses  to  current  life  stressors.  Strate-
gies  used  in  this  type  of  therapy  include  problem-solving, 
expression of feelings, and psychoeducation [206]. A diary is 
used  to  record  concerns  in  between  therapy  sessions  [206]. 
Interpersonal  Psychotherapy  (IPT)  [227,  228]  focuses  on 
relational aspects that contribute to PTSD symptoms. It is a 
time-limited  therapy  that  was  adapted  from  treatment  for 
Major  Depressive  Disorder  (MDD)  [206].  Finally,  Stress 
Inoculation Training (SIT) [222, 229], which is derived from 
CBT, aims to enable patients to identify and cope with stress 
in  order  to  manage  PTSD  symptoms  [206].  It  can  involve 
strategies  including  cognitive  restructuring,  role  play,  im-
proving  assertiveness,  breathing  exercises,  and  deep  muscle 
relaxation [206]. 

It should be noted that effect sizes may not fully illustrate 
the  broader  clinical  factors  present  in  patient  outcomes;  a 
review of RCTs for military-related PTSD found that despite 
large  within-group  effect  sizes,  approximately  two-thirds  of 
participants  still  met  criteria  for  PTSD  after  treatment  with 

CPT or PE, and one-third to one-half of participants did not 
report  clinically  significant  symptom  changes.  Additionally, 
while  CPT  and  PE  were  significantly  more  effective  than 
waitlist conditions, outcomes, particularly at follow-up, were 
comparable  to  those  of  non-trauma-focused  therapies  [230]. 
While  this  review  found  that  approximately  one-fourth  of 
individuals  dropped  out  of  trauma-focused  treatments,  an-
other study comparing PE to CPT found that more than half 
of the participants in PE and almost half of the participants in 
CPT dropped out of treatment [6]. However, this study also 
showed  significant,  meaningful  decreases  in  PTSD  symp-
toms as rated by clinicians and notably used a population of 
participants reflective of a “clinically realistic” veteran popu-
lation. These varying outcome data indicate that while “gold 
standard” therapies have strong outcomes in relation to wait-
list  controls,  they  are  more  comparable  to  other  treatments 
that may be less empirically validated; this attests to the dif-
ficulty  of  blinding  for  psychological  interventions.  These 
data  also  indicate  the  importance  of  developing  treatments 
that are both successful at providing avenues for meaningful 
change while also being tolerable enough to allow for greater 
completion rates. 

2.10.2. Pharmacotherapies 

Pharmacological treatments are the second strategy often 
used  for  PTSD  [47].  These  have  the  advantage,  relative  to 
psychotherapy, of requiring far less time, effort, and therapy-
associated distress on the part of the patient and are typically 
more  accessible  since  they  do  not  require  weekly  meetings 
with  a  trained  therapist.  However,  selective  serotonin 
reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs),  the  current  front-line  pharma-
cotherapy for PTSD, provide suboptimal response rates, with 
<30%  of  patients  achieving  full  remission  and  typically  re-
quiring weeks of use to achieve any therapeutic effect [231, 
232].  Effect  sizes  for  the  benefits  of  these  medications  are 
much smaller than for psychotherapeutic treatment strategies 
[26,  206,  233],  and  their  adverse  effects  and  potential  for 
PTSD  relapse  upon  discontinuation  are  characteristics  that 
make  them  less  attractive  as  first-line  treatment  strategies 
[211]. 

  Moderate-certainty  evidence  supports  the  use  of  SSRIs, 
the  first-line  agents  in  pharmacotherapy  for  PTSD  [234].  A 
systematic  review  [234]  found  that  SSRIs  improved  PTSD 
symptoms in 58% of participants as compared with the pla-
cebo response rate of 35%. SSRIs may help with symptoms 
including reduced hyperarousal, avoidance, numbing, and re-
experiencing  [47,  235].  The  FDA-approved  SSRIs  are  ser-
traline and paroxetine. Both have been found modestly supe-
rior to placebo in multisite clinical trials [236-239]. Howev-
er, both were found to cause side effects that resulted in in-
creased  study  dropout  compared  with  placebo  [234].  In  a 
longitudinal study of 154,953 veterans newly diagnosed with 
PTSD  over  the  course  of  a  year,  71.8%  of  veterans  discon-
tinued  medication  treatment  within  180  days,  and  34.6% 
within  30  days  [240].  Additionally,  the  antidepressant  SSRI 
fluoxetine  is  supported  by  evidence  from  randomized  con-
trolled trials (RCTs) [206]. 

  The  noradrenergic  and  specific  serotonergic  antidepres-
sant  (NaSSA)  mirtazapine  and  the  tricyclic  antidepressant 
(TCA)  amitriptyline  have  also  been  reported  to  improve 

 
 
The Psychedelic Future of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    649 

some  PTSD  symptoms,  but  this  is  based  on  low-certainty 
evidence  [234].  Some  evidence  supports  the  use  of  trazo-
done, an antidepressant serotonergic compound that produc-
es  sedation,  for  improving  PTSD-related  nightmares  and 
insomnia [241], but larger studies are needed to confirm the-
se  effects.  The  serotonin-norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitor 
(SNRI)  venlafaxine  has  been  assessed  in  a  few  studies  and 
reported  to  have  a  comparable  effect  to  SSRIs  [242];  it  is 
among only a few drugs to treat PTSD that are supported by 
high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [206, 243]. 
Prazosin,  an  antiadrenergic  compound,  has  additionally 
shown benefit for sleep disturbances in PTSD [47, 244], and 
it  has  consequently  been  recommended  as  the  first-line 
treatment  for  PTSD-related  sleep  disturbances  [244].  In 
some  studies,  prazosin  has  demonstrated  not  only  benefits 
for  reducing  nightmares  and  improving  sleep  but  also  help-
ing with other PTSD symptoms, including hyperarousal and 
overall  global  functioning  [245,  246].  However,  a  recent 
systematic review and meta-analysis reported that its benefits 
extend only to improving nightmares and that more research 
is  needed  to  better  characterize  its  effects  [247].  Additional 
classes  of  drugs,  including  benzodiazepines,  monoamine 
oxidase  inhibitors  (MAOIs),  and  dual-uptake  inhibitors, 
which block the reuptake of both serotonin and norepineph-
rine, are used to treat PTSD [234]. However, the use of these 
medications is not well supported [234]. Treatment with an-
tipsychotics has also shown no benefit when compared with 
placebo [234].  

  Current evidence does not support that pharmacotherapy 
in  combination  with  psychotherapy  is  more  effective  than 
either  intervention  alone  [248-250].  Additionally,  many 
medications are used chronically [251], as they are typically 
utilized to alleviate specific symptoms rather than the broad-
er PTSD profile and underlying barriers to recovery. 

2.10.3. Additional Treatment Strategies 

  Beyond  psychotherapy  and  pharmacotherapy,  additional 
treatment  strategies  for  PTSD  have  been  tested  and  remain 
under  active  investigation.  Mind-body  interventions  have 
demonstrated value, with mindfulness and yoga interventions 
showing  moderate  to  large  effect  sizes  to  improve  PTSD 
symptoms  [252].  In  this  vein,  relaxation  techniques  [47] 
have to date been used only as control conditions to compare 
against  other  interventions  and  have  been  inferior  to  each 
intervention,  yet  have  demonstrated  large  symptom  im-
provements  within  the  relaxation-intervention  groups  [252]. 
Preliminary  evidence  has  supported  additional  alternative 
approaches,  including  neurofeedback,  transcranial  magnetic 
stimulation,  somatic  experiencing,  acupuncture,  as  well  as 
saikokeishikankyoto, an herbal preparation, and several oth-
ers, although further research is needed to establish the value 
of  these  therapies  [23,  253].  Though  there  is  less  academic 
research  into  their  efficacy  compared  with  standard  thera-
pies, prospective patients often express interest in alternative 
treatments  and  somatic  therapies.  Given  the  often  intense, 
distress-inducing  nature  of  more  empirically  supported  psy-
chotherapeutic treatments, the drawbacks of pharmacothera-
py,  and  the  limited  available  adaptations  to  increase  tolera-
bility,  it  is  understandable  that  individuals  with  PTSD  may 
be drawn to these alternatives that emphasize focus on phys-
iological well-being and connectedness. 

2.10.4. Factors Affecting Treatment Success 

  Treatment  success  for  PTSD  appears  to  depend  on  nu-
merous factors [206] that are not yet well understood [254]. 
Burback  et  al.  [206]    present  a  thorough  review  of  factors. 
Among these considerations, combat veterans typically expe-
rience less success with their PTSD treatments than civilians 
[10], and this population also has higher dropout rates from 
research  studies,  particularly  for  trauma-focused  therapies 
[255,  256].  In  general,  military-based  trauma  is  associated 
with lower treatment success and higher dropout rates [256]. 
This  may  be  due  to  a  number  of  factors,  including  limited 
disclosure about the trauma upon returning from deployment 
and,  thus,  limited  opportunity  for  support  to  mitigate  the 
severity  of  PTSD.  A  comorbid  diagnosis  of  depression  and 
higher  severity  of  symptoms  when  starting  treatment  has 
been  found  to  correlate  with  less  reduction  of  symptoms 
through treatment, while recency of the traumatic experience 
was associated with more success in treatment [257]. Higher 
education level and adherence to treatment may also be cor-
related with better outcomes [257]. Patients’ premorbid per-
sonality and psychological traits can influence their engage-
ment  with  therapy  and  subsequent  treatment  success  [206]. 
Another  factor  that  could  affect  treatment  success  is  a  pa-
tient’s readiness for PTSD treatment. In veterans with PTSD, 
readiness to accept treatment has been shown to be correlat-
ed with higher levels of participation [258]. Also, an increase 
in utilization of VA mental health care services was found to 
be  associated  with  a  higher  level  of  readiness  for  change 
[259]. This may indicate that regardless of the potential effi-
cacy of the treatments provided, the ability to engage in them 
is  dependent  on  many  different  factors,  and  the  level  of  en-
gagement will impact whether they can be effective in reduc-
ing symptoms and distress.  

2.10.5. The Need for Improved Treatments for PTSD 

  As  described  in  the  sections  above,  in  the  four  decades 
since  PTSD  was  first  included  in  the  DSM,  progress  has 
been  made  in  characterizing  the  biopsychosocial  context  in 
which it occurs. What is clear is that PTSD is a complex and 
heterogeneous  condition,  both  in  terms  of  predisposing  fac-
tors as well as its clinical presentation and responsiveness to 
treatment [206, 254]. As illustrated by the high rates of med-
ical  and  psychiatric  comorbidity  as  well  as  impairments  in 
many  domains  of  functioning,  it  seems  that  the  effects  of 
trauma are not limited to PTSD symptoms. Instead, there is a 
complex  interplay  of  adaptive  and  maladaptive  responses 
that  are  not  easily  disentangled.  Treatment  interventions 
have largely targeted one specific component of PTSD, such 
as exposure-based treatments focusing on correcting the gen-
eralized  fear  response  to  the  traumatic  memory  or  medica-
tions targeting depressive symptoms or sleep. For some indi-
viduals,  these  treatments  are  efficacious  in  accomplishing 
those goals, which can have a significant positive impact on 
a person’s life. However, for many people, these treatments 
are partially or completely ineffective or intolerable, and the 
morbidity  and  mortality  of  PTSD  remain  high.  Yet  the  ca-
nonical translational scientific approach to developing novel 
treatments has not resulted in new options. Given the signifi-
cant  impact  of  study  dropout  and  the  limited  efficacy  of 
trauma-focused  treatments,  it  is  vital  to  explore  treatment 
options  that  can  effectively  reduce  symptoms  in  a  manner 

650    Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4 

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

that  is  more  tolerable,  and  that  leads  to  a  greater  likelihood 
of completion of an efficacious treatment. 

3.  PSYCHEDELICS  FOR  THE  TREATMENT  OF 
PTSD 

3.1. Overview 

3.1.1. Introduction to Psychedelics  

Psychedelic-assisted therapy is a paradigm shift in many 
ways. This treatment was not born out of a particular neuro-
biological framework; it does not attempt to reverse or quiet 
any  hypothetical  underlying  pathophysiology,  nor  does  it 
necessitate  that  certain  content  is  addressed  during  the  ses-
sions. Rather, through acute and subacute effects, a psyche-
delic  substance  facilitates  a  biological,  psychological,  and 
physiological state in which a psychotherapeutic intervention 
can  have  a  significant  and  durable  impact  [260].  In  a  thera-
peutic context, the substance is thought to enhance access to 
psychologically  relevant  material,  including  prior  traumatic 
experiences, for processing in real time [261]. The treatment 
focuses not on symptom reduction per se but instead on more 
holistic  and  patient-driven  intentions.  For  example,  these 
might include rediscovering and rebuilding trust, safety, and 
acceptance  in  oneself  and  others,  mindfulness,  connection, 
curiosity, or a sense of well-being. This differs significantly 
from modern psychiatric care, which often relies upon daily 
ingestion  of  a  psychotropic  medication  with  the  intent  of 
targeting  certain  symptoms  and  neurochemical  pathways  to 
attain  a  therapeutic  effect.  While  such  care  is  often  coupled 
with  psychotherapy,  the  psychotherapy  is  frequently  deliv-
ered by a different clinician than the medication prescriber.  

  The  exploration  of  psychedelic-assisted  therapy  in  this 
context is still in its early stages. A recent systematic review 
and meta-analysis of numerous pharmacotherapies combined 
with  psychotherapy  reported  a  demonstrated  benefit  to  the 
use  of  the  psychedelic  compound  MDMA  combined  with 
therapy when compared with placebo; this comparative ben-
efit was not demonstrated with any other pharmacotherapies 
[248].  Similarly,  recent  and  ongoing  clinical  trials  suggest 
that this compound and other psychedelics show promise for 
the  treatment  of  PTSD  when  used  in  a  psychotherapeutic 
context  [262,  263].  A  pooled  analysis  of  MDMA-assisted 
therapy studies reported the dropout rate as 7.6% [39], indi-
cating  greater  tolerability  than  other  PTSD  psychotherapy 
treatments. The following sections provide a brief history of 
the  use  of  psychedelics  to  treat  psychiatric  disorders  and 
describe  the  characteristics  of  the  psychedelic  compounds 
3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine  (MDMA),  psilocy-
bin,  lysergic  acid  diethylamide  (LSD),  N,N-dimethyltryp-
tamine  (DMT)-containing  ayahuasca,  and  ketamine  (Table 
1), and review the evidence for their use to treat PTSD and 
other  trauma-based  disorders,  as  well  as  associated  comor-
bidities. 

3.1.2. History of Psychedelic Use for Psychiatric Disorders 

Psychedelics  (Table  1)  have  been  used  for  millennia  in 
numerous  cultures  globally  for  a  broad  range  of  purposes, 
including  religious  and  medicinal  contexts  [264],  but  they 
are relatively new to Western mental healthcare. The modern 
era of psychedelic use began in the late 19th century and was 

characterized by the isolation or synthesis, systematic study, 
and experimental use of these drugs [265-267]. In the 1950s, 
established and increasing interest in mescaline research was 
extended  to  study  LSD,  psilocybin,  and  DMT  [266-268]. 
During this era, and following the discovery of LSD, the role 
of neurochemistry in psychiatric disorders started to be con-
sidered  [269].  Studies  conducted  during  this  early  period 
often  relied  on  anecdotal  reports  and  lacked  modern  stand-
ards for credible research. Prior to 1963, no standards existed 
to protect patients and research subjects, and often, their con-
sent was not secured. 

  The  popularization  of  psychedelics  for  recreational  use 
led  to  the  ban  of  LSD  in  the  U.S.  in  1966,  followed  by  the 
establishment of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
(DEA)  in  1973;  this  new  office  designated  psychedelics  as 
Schedule I substances, defined as having no medical use and 
a high potential for abuse. From 1962 onward, regulations by 
the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  restricted 
research  involving  psychedelic  drugs,  although  clinical  re-
search  on  psychedelics  continued  until  1976.  Subsequent 
research  largely  involved  in  vitro  and  animal  studies  focus-
ing on characterizing the putatively harmful effects of these 
drugs  and  employed  high  doses  administered  frequently. 
Notably,  the  scheduling  of  psychedelics  predated  the  estab-
lishment of the PTSD diagnosis in the DSM-III in 1980. 

  The  modern  era  of  psychedelic  research  began  in  1990 
when  the  FDA  established  a  group  to  oversee  psychedelic 
research, and in the following year, that agency granted per-
mission to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic 
Studies (MAPS) to conduct studies of DMT and MDMA in 
healthy humans. In 2001, a pilot study of psilocybin to treat 
obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  was  approved  [270]. 
Research  in  the  subsequent  two  decades  has  emphasized 
studying the safety profile of psychedelics, and to date, these 
compounds have been reported as medically safe [43]; how-
ever, the psychological safety profile for patients is still be-
ing investigated. 

3.1.3. Current Legal Status of Psychedelics 

Presently,  psychedelics  remain  Schedule  I  drugs  in  the 
U.S. and are illegal in most Western countries. Societal per-
ceptions of psychedelics continue to evolve, with some U.S. 
states  legalizing  psychedelics  such  as  psilocybin  for  thera-
peutic  and/or  recreational  purposes  [271]  and  selected  other 
countries permitting their use for therapeutic purposes [272]. 
An  important  distinction  exists  between  the  decriminaliza-
tion  or  legalization  of  these  drugs  occurring  in  selected  re-
gions  and  medically  directed  psychedelic-assisted  psycho-
therapy treatments, which remain highly regulated. In recent 
years, a modern renaissance of psychedelic research has oc-
curred  in  the  U.S.  and  in  other  countries,  with  government 
approvals being granted to study these drugs in a variety of 
therapeutic  contexts  and  venture  capital  funding  numerous 
applications  of  these  compounds.  Relevant  to  this  review 
paper,  the  limitations  of  currently  approved  treatments  for 
PTSD have motivated the study of psychedelics to treat this 
condition and other trauma-related disorders (Tables 2-7), as 
well  as  other  diagnoses  associated  with  trauma  exposure 
(Table 8). Studies to date suggest that psychedelics may have 
benefits  that  differentiate  them  from  other  pharmacothera-

peutic options to treat these disorders; for example, they may 
offer  transdiagnostic  benefits  that  can  improve  a  range  of 
symptoms  [273],  as  compared  with  traditional  pharmaceuti-
cals that target the mitigation of specific disease mechanisms 
or symptoms. Psychedelics are poised for FDA approval for 
selected uses, with MDMA close to being granted FDA ap-
proval to treat severe PTSD following a successful Phase III 
trial [40]. This review paper presents a summary of research 
that  has  been  conducted  to  date  on  psychedelics  for  the 
treatment of PTSD, other trauma-related disorders, and asso-
ciated comorbidities. 

3.1.4. Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy 

  The  FDA  mandates  that  all  psychedelic  psychotherapy 
modalities employ treatment manuals for therapists. Psyche-
delic-assisted  psychotherapy  (PAP)  consists  of  preparation 
sessions,  an  experiential  session  typically  lasting  several 
hours  in  which  the  psychedelic  compound  is  administered, 
and  integration  sessions  afterward.  This  process  may  repeat 
depending on the number of times the psychedelic is admin-
istered. Like other types of psychotherapy, it is believed that 
successful  treatment  outcomes  in  PAP  are  dependent  upon 
therapists receiving intensive training in the therapeutic mo-
dality and maintaining adherence to various principles, some 
of  which  are  discussed  below  [274-276].  Central  to  achiev-
ing  positive  therapeutic  outcomes,  the  therapeutic  alliance 
between  the  patient  and  therapists  is  paramount  [277].  In 
modern  PAP  research,  therapists  are  trained  to  maintain  a 
non-directive  and  empathic  stance  [274,  278,  279]  with  an 
attitude  of  openness,  compassion,  and  curiosity  toward  a 
patient’s  present-moment  experience.  This  concept  is  also 
introduced  to  the  patient  to  establish  a  framework  for  non-
judgmentally  permitting  the  surfacing  of  thoughts,  feelings, 
and memories for processing within the therapeutic container 
[274, 279]. In PAP trials for PTSD, therapists are required to 
have  appropriate  background,  education,  and  experience 
working  with  patients  suffering  from  PTSD  and  should  be 
experienced in other therapy modalities for PTSD. While the 
therapists are present to support the patient, a general princi-
ple of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is that the partici-
pant  is  empowered  to  trust  their  own  innate  processes  of 
psychological healing [274, 278]. 

  Establishing a safe set and setting for participants in PAP 
is of the utmost importance, which in turn places a high de-
gree of responsibility on the therapists. Many aspects of PAP 
are  still  being  explored.  As  researchers  identify  the  psycho-
logical effects of PAP - both therapeutic and harmful - flexi-
bility  with  therapeutic  interventions  is  key,  as  the  optimal 
psychotherapeutic  techniques  have  not  yet  been  determined 
and  are  likely  to  differ  by  individual.  Caution  and  extreme 
attention to detail must also be emphasized in the training of 
therapists  as  they  enter  a  non-traditional  therapeutic  land-
scape  in  which  the  participants  are  under  the  influence  of 
potent compounds that often leave them vulnerable. 

3.1.5. Set and Setting 

  To present the mechanisms of modern PAP, it is essential 
to  understand  the  intricate  methods  used  in  creating  the 
“therapeutic  container”  wherein  the  therapeutic  process  un-
folds  through  careful  attention  to  “set”  and  “setting”.  These 

terms have historically been appreciated as critical to facili-
tating  a  positive  subjective  experience,  both  in  recreational 
and clinical contexts. “Set” refers to the mindset, disposition, 
attitude, and expectations of the participant and the therapists 
offering  support,  while  the  “setting”  refers  to  the  environ-
ment  wherein  the  drug  is  taken  and  includes  any  external 
sensory  influences  present  in  the  physical  space.  It  is  the 
combination of the drug’s profound effects on the sensations, 
emotions, and cognitions, with the set and setting, that influ-
ence the myriad acute subjective experiences of psychedelics 
[274, 280].  

  The physical setting of PAP has varied between sites, but 
certain  themes  are  generally  considered  in  the  design  of  a 
therapeutic  environment,  with  particular  attention  paid  to 
prioritizing  the  comfort  of  the  participant  [281].  While  the 
design of PAP clinical spaces has not been standardized and 
is not based on any empirical data, general qualities are en-
couraged. For example, the room should be private to mini-
mize potential distractions; be safe, clean, cozy, and aestheti-
cally pleasing, with dim lighting; and contain a comfortable 
bed with soft blankets and pillows [274]. Adding to comfort, 
participants  will  often  have  their  preparatory  psychotherapy 
sessions within this clinical space to increase familiarity and 
reduce anxiety [282].

effects of each drug, the therapeutic rationale for its applica-
tion  to  treat  PTSD,  and  the  clinical  research  supporting  its 
use in this context. 

3.2. MDMA 

3.2.1. Introduction and History 

  MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) is the most exten-
sively studied psychedelic-assisted therapy for PTSD to date. 
MDMA-AT  involves  the  administration  of  1-3  controlled 
doses  (ranging  between  75-125  mg  depending  on  the  study 
design and use of supplemental doses) of MDMA (Table 1), 
accompanied by psychotherapy. Patients also receive several 
sessions  of  preparation  before  MDMA  administration  and 
several  sessions  of  integration  afterward.  The  treatment  is 
designed to facilitate the exploration and processing of trau-
matic experiences in a safe and supportive environment. Re-
cent clinical trials have shown that MDMA-AT can be effec-
tive  in  reducing  symptoms  of  PTSD,  including  anxiety,  de-
pression, and avoidance behaviors. MDMA-AT demonstrat-
ed  large  effect  sizes  for  the  treatment  of  PTSD  during  six 
Phase II clinical trials [39, 282]. In 2021, the first Phase III 
clinical  trial  using  MDMA-AT  for  PTSD  was  published, 
reporting  MDMA-AT  to  be  safe  and  efficacious  [40].  The 
results of the second Phase III trial will determine whether it 
will  become  an  FDA-approved  treatment.  However,  more 
research  is  needed  to  fully  understand  the  potential  benefits 
and risks of this novel therapy. 

  MDMA, or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (Table 
1; Fig. 2), was first synthesized in 1912 by the pharmaceuti-
cal company Merck, but its psychoactive properties were not

Fig. (2). Chemical  structures  of  the  five  psychedelic  and  psychedelic-like  compounds  included  in  this  review  paper.  Classic  psychedelics 
include psilocybin, a tryptophan indole-based alkaloid with a base N,N-dimethyltryptamine structure and an added phosphoryloxy substituent 
at  position  4;  lysergic  acid  diethylamide-25  (LSD),  a  semisynthetic  ergoline  composed  of  an  indole  system  and  tetracyclic  ring;  and  N,N-
dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the psychoactive component of ayahuasca, a structural analog of tryptamine with two added N-methyl substituents. 
The  entactogen  3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA)  is  a  ring-substituted  phenethylamine  that  possesses  chirality  but  is  typically 
produced in its racemic form. MDMA has a 2-(methylamino)propyl group at position 5 that is an addition to the base form of 1,3-benzodioxole. 
The dissociative anesthetic, ketamine, is a racemic mixture composed of two enantiomers, (S)- and (R)-ketamine. Ketamine is a cyclohexanone 
molecule on which a 2-chlorophenyl group and a methylamino group substitute for the hydrogens typically found at position 2. 

recognized  until  the  1970s  [283].  In  1976,  MDMA  was  re-
synthesized  by  the  prolific  American  chemist  Alexander 
Shulgin,  who  remarked  on  its  properties:  “My  mood  was 
light,  happy,  but  with  an  underlying  conviction  that  some-
thing significant was about to happen. There was a change in 
perspective both in the near visual field and in the distance. 
My  usually  poor  vision  was  sharpened.  I  saw  details  in  the 
distance that I could not normally see. After the peak experi-
ence had passed, my major state was one of deep relaxation. 
I  felt  that  I  could  talk  about  deep  or  personal  subjects  with 
special clarity, and I experienced some of the feeling one has 
after  the  second  martini,  that  one  is  discoursing  brilliantly 
and with particularly acute analytical powers” [284]. 

Shulgin introduced the substance to psychotherapist Leo 
Zeff, who began using it to facilitate therapy sessions [284]. 
Zeff's  positive  experiences  with  MDMA  and  its  potential 
therapeutic  benefits  led  to  its  spread  among  therapists  and 
psychiatrists [285]. They recognized the profound subjective 
effects on humans, including enhanced feelings of closeness 
to  others,  well-being,  and  insightfulness.  MDMA  was  first 
referred  to  as  an  “empathogen''  in  1983  [286],  and  later,  as 
an “entactogen”, derived from Greek and Latin roots to mean 
“touching  within”  [287].  Indeed,  while  MDMA  has  been 
observed  to  enhance  empathy,  the  effects  of  MDMA  more 
pertinently  allow  patients  to  retrieve  repressed  and  often 
traumatic memories from within their psyches, a characteris-
tic better encapsulated by the term “entactogen” [288].  

  Concurrently, MDMA gained popularity outside of ther-
apeutic settings, where it was known more broadly as “ecsta-
sy” [289]. MDMA use carries a number of risks, both acute 
and long-term, especially when used in uncontrolled settings 

or  in  combination  with  other  substances.  In  the  short  term, 
MDMA use can lead to acute adverse effects, including de-
hydration,  hyperthermia,  hyponatremia,  and  serotonin  syn-
drome, which can be fatal in severe cases [290-292]. Long-
term  MDMA  use  has  been  linked  to  various  adverse  out-
comes,  including  neurotoxicity,  cognitive  impairment,  and 
mood disturbances such as depression and anxiety [293]. It is 
important that these risks are carefully considered before any 
potential therapeutic use. Many, but not all, of the risks asso-
ciated with MDMA are mitigated in a controlled and moni-
tored setting, and will be discussed below.  

  The  following  section  will  provide  an  overview  of 
MDMA-AT, and review MDMA’s pharmacology, subjective 
and  objective  effects,  and  known  adverse  effects.  Then,  the 
proposed mechanisms underlying MDMA’s therapeutic ben-
efits for PTSD will be discussed, and clinical trials evaluat-
ing MDMA-AT for the treatment of PTSD will be reviewed. 

3.2.2. Therapeutic Model 

In a psychiatric context, MDMA is used as a facilitator of 
psychotherapy.  The  therapeutic  structure  of  MDMA-AT 
typically  includes  multiple  preparatory  sessions,  during 
which  a  patient  is  given  information  about  the  process  and 
the effects of MDMA and provides information on their own 
expectations and background. This preparation also serves as 
an opportunity for patients to develop a therapeutic relation-
ship with their therapists prior to experiencing MDMA. Fol-
lowing  preparation,  there  is  a  dosing  session  in  which  the 
patient ingests MDMA while accompanied by the two thera-
pists  with  whom  they  have  been  working.  This  is  then  fol-
lowed  by  multiple  integration  sessions,  in  which  the  patient

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

and  therapists  meet  again  to  process  and  integrate  the  psy-
chedelic experience [274]. 

  Throughout  the  MDMA-AT  sessions,  participants  are 
invited  to  use  eyeshades  to  allow  for  deeper  introspection, 
and headphones with a playlist of ambient or classical music. 
A 1970s study suggested that during PAP, carefully selected 
music  can  increase  the  probability  of  effective  results  and 
decrease  the  probability  of  unwanted  anxiety  [294].  Re-
searchers  have  claimed  that  music  has  a  central  therapeutic 
function in PAP [295]. Music has been thought to serve as a 
vehicle for participants to move through the variety of emo-
tions  that  may  emerge  during  their  treatment.  Playlists  with 
songs of varying tempos, volumes, and lengths are compiled 
prior  to  the  sessions  and  can  be  curated  by  the  therapists  to 
follow  and  reinforce  the  flow  of  a  therapy  session  [274]. 
Instrumental  music  is  usually  employed,  as  it  may  direct 
listeners  inward.  The  absence  of  lyrics  in  the  participant’s 
native language is encouraged, as lyrics could introduce con-
tent and themes that might detract from the non-directiveness 
central  to  MDMA-AT.  As  personality,  preferences,  situa-
tional  mindset,  and  other  factors  likely  interact  to  varying 
degrees with musical selection, this is an essential aspect of 
MDMA-AT and PAP that stands to benefit from further in-
vestigation, as it potentially could be utilized to enhance the 
therapeutic efficacy of sessions. 

3.2.3. Psychological Effects 

3.2.3.1. Subjective Effects 

  MDMA is commonly referred to as an entactogen [288], 
a  class  of  pharmacological  drugs  that  have  acute  anxiolytic 
effects,  promote  social  cohesion  and  unity,  and  can  lead  to 
profound states of introspection and personal reflection. Sev-
eral  recent  research  studies  have  demonstrated  properties  of 
MDMA  that  are  consistent  with  this  description.  For  exam-
ple,  MDMA  promotes  compassion,  relaxes  psychological 
defenses,  reduces  fear  of  emotional  injury,  improves  toler-
ance  of  distressing  memories,  enhances  trust,  and  increases 
the capacity for introspection [296-299]. These qualities are 
thought to facilitate the exploration of trauma-related materi-
al in PTSD treatment. Additionally, studies on MDMA usage 
outside the context of therapy have identified trends regard-
ing  the  elicitation  of  increased  self-compassion,  enhanced 
sociability,  increased  cognitive  and  emotional  empathy,  eu-
phoria,  feelings  of  closeness  and  love  for  others,  a  sense  of 
inner  peace  or  peace  with  the  world,  and  enhanced  sensa-
tions [300, 301]. Challenging or unpleasant subjective expe-
riences  are  also  reported  by  participants  (Table  1).  These 
include  anxiety,  paranoia,  racing  thoughts,  loss  of  control 
over self, overwhelming emotions, and the vivid recollection 
of traumatic or frightening memories [292, 302, 303]. How-
ever, within the supportive and structured clinical setting of 
MDMA-AT, these challenges may serve as catalysts for the 
therapeutic  process.  It  is  essential  to  understand  the  im-
portance of set and setting or the context in which the drug is 
taken. For this reason, it is difficult to generalize the subjec-
tive  effects  of  MDMA  when  used  non-therapeutically  from 
the  effects  reported  in  clinical  studies.  Furthermore,  this 
point  illustrates  that  the  therapeutic  container  may  be  the 
most critical predictor of MDMA’s subjective effects. 

Predicting  participant  reactivity  to  MDMA  has  been  the 
subject  of  a  recent  pooled  analysis  of  10  randomized,  dou-
ble-blind,  placebo-controlled,  cross-over  studies  performed 
in the same laboratory (N = 194) [304]. This study found that 
proportional  to  MDMA  plasma  concentrations,  participants 
with  a  higher  “openness  to  experience”  personality  trait  re-
sponded  with  more  “closeness”  and  scored  higher  on  do-
mains of “oceanic boundlessness” and “visionary restructur-
alization”  in  response  to  MDMA.  In  contrast,  participants 
with  higher  “neuroticism”  traits  experienced  more  “anxious 
ego dissolution” and “impaired control and cognition” [304]. 
Though these differences in personality traits are interesting 
and may certainly play a role in reported subjective effects and 
treatment outcomes, again, the emphasis here must be placed 
on the engagement and relationship shared with the therapists. 
In  particular,  PTSD  patients  often  struggle  with  establishing 
trust and may lean towards higher levels of trait neuroticism. 
Thus, therapists have a substantial role in using the subjective 
effects experienced, whether positive or negative and galva-
nizing individual growth and adaptation from them. 

3.2.3.2. Cognitive Effects 

3.2.3.2.1. Long-Term Neuropsychological Effects  

Following  its  scheduling  by  the  DEA  in  1985,  many 
NIH-funded  studies  began  examining  the  effects  of  recrea-
tional  or  experimental  use  of  MDMA.  The  general  conclu-
sion from that literature has been that long-term recreational 
use  (of  untested  compounds,  at  unknown  doses,  possibly 
combined  with  the  use  of  other  substances)  has  a  negative 
impact  on  neurocognitive  domains  such  as  verbal  memory, 
visual  memory,  working  memory,  attention,  and  executive 
function,  among  others  [305,  306].  Subsequently,  the  relia-
bility and robustness of causality between MDMA exposure 
and  adverse  neurocognitive  outcomes  have  been  questioned 
due to methodological concerns and evidence of publication 
bias  [307-309].  The  studies  reporting  the  harmful  effects  of 
MDMA  have  been  criticized  for  their  retrospective  design, 
disallowing baseline cognitive function to be assessed prior to 
MDMA exposure. However, as we have asserted above, stud-
ies of the neuropsychological effects of the recreational use of 
MDMA may not be relevant to understanding the neurocogni-
tive effects of therapeutic doses for a variety of reasons.  

Studies  examining  recreational  usage,  typically  among 
younger  populations,  reported  that  chronic,  heavy  use  of 
ecstasy  is  associated  with  depressed  mood,  sleep  disorders, 
impulsiveness  and  hostility,  persistent  elevation  of  anxiety, 
and  selective  impairment  of  working  memory,  episodic 
memory, and attention [310]. Reports of long-term deficits in 
serotonergic  activity  leading  to  complications  in  memory 
were also claimed to be associated with the recreational use 
of  MDMA  [311].  However,  there  are  important  distinctions 
between  recreational  and  therapeutic  use.  For  instance,  ob-
servational studies have found that among heavy recreational 
ecstasy users, the pills taken generally contained MDMA but 
were  often  combined  with  other  drugs  such  as  3,4-
methylendioxy-N-ethylamphetamine  (MDEA)  and  metham-
phetamine [312, 313]. Additionally, the dose of MDMA per 
pill ranged from 0 to 245 mg, and users consumed, on aver-
age, from one-half to five pills, with the total dose consumed 
ranging up to 280 mg, dosing levels that far exceed the cur-

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    655 

rent clinical standard dose used in MDMA-AT [313] (Table 
1).  Often,  the  recreational  usage  of  this  drug  occurs  at  rave 
events, where a higher risk of dehydration and hyperthermia 
can  lead  to  fatal  outcomes.  Further  confounding  results  on 
the  long-term  effects  of  MDMA,  recreational  ecstasy  users 
typically engage in poly-drug use [314]. 

In  consideration  of  the  factors  above,  the  resulting  im-
pacts  on  neurocognitive  domains  are  poorly  translatable  to 
controlled  clinical  research.  In  order  to  better  establish  cau-
sality,  future  research  should  move  away  from  evaluating 
recreational  users  in  uncontrolled  samples  and  focus  on  ex-
amining  long-term  neuropsychological  effects  in  clinical 
samples  with  verifiable  MDMA  purity  and  dosage  [307]. 
Accordingly, it is important to understand neuropsychologi-
cal effects associated specifically with MDMA-AT, and only 
a few studies to date have assessed this, as described next. 

  Three  studies  have  examined  the  effects  of  MDMA-AT 
on  cognitive  function  at  1  to  2  months  after  treatment  via 
administration  of  the  Repeatable  Battery  for  Assessment  of 
Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) [315], a well-validated 
measure  of  memory,  attention,  processing  speed,  visual-
spatial and constructional abilities, and expressive language; 
as  well  as  the  Paced  Auditory  Serial  Addition  Task  (PA-
SAT),  an  instrument  designed  to  measure  auditory  pro-
cessing  speed  and  mental  flexibility  [316,  317].  These  as-
sessments  were  performed  prior  to  treatment  and  at  1  to  2 
months following MDMA or placebo experimental sessions. 
Across  the  studies,  there  was  no  evidence  that  MDMA-AT 
impaired  cognitive  functioning  based  on  the  RBANS  and 
PASAT. A pooled analysis of these three studies discovered 
no  significant  differences  between  the  MDMA  and  placebo 
groups on domains of cognition as tested by the RBANS and 
PASAT [275]. Future trials would benefit from continuing to 
assess  neuropsychological  outcomes  and  extending  the  fol-
low-up period to better understand the effects of MDMA-AT 
on cognition in clinical populations.  

3.2.4. Somatic Effects 

  MDMA  is  known  to  induce  changes  in  measurable  vital 
signs (Table 1), including body temperature, heart rate (HR), 
and  blood  pressure  (BP),  with  a  significant  dose-response 
effect on BP but not on HR or body temperature [318-321]. 
A pooled analysis of nine Phase I MDMA studies in healthy 
subjects was conducted to inform the safety pharmacology of 
MDMA  in  healthy  participants  [322].  Across  these  studies, 
MDMA  produced  a  measurable  increase  in  body  tempera-
ture, with core body temperatures rising above 38℃, up to a 
maximum  of  39.1℃  at  peak  [322].  This  effect  seems  to  be 
related  to  increases  in  noradrenergic  signaling,  as  the  effect 
has  been  blunted  with  pre-administration  of  norepinephrine 
(NE)  reuptake  inhibitors.  These  increases  in  body  tempera-
ture are described as tolerable and transient, with no reported 
clinically significant outcomes under controlled laboratory or 
experimental  settings  [40,  282].  MDMA  dose-dependently 
induces  transient  hypertension,  with  ~33%  of  participants 
demonstrating systolic BP >160 mmHg and 4% demonstrat-
ing systolic BP of ~180 mmHg, with no clinically significant 
adverse  events  (AEs)  resulting  from  these  elevations  in  BP 

[322].  Across  Phase  I  clinical  trials,  ~29%  of  participants 
also became tachycardic (HR > 100 beats per minute (bpm)) 
[322], with the maximum HR measured across clinical trials 
as  140  bpm;  again,  no  clinically  significant  AEs  related  to 
these  elevations  in  HR  were  reported.  Given  these  sympa-
thomimetic effects, early clinical trials excluded participants 
with known hypertension, but more recent clinical trials have 
permitted  these  participants  if  their  hypertension  was  con-
trolled  well  with  medications  and  they  had  completed  a  ca-
rotid ultrasound and nuclear stress test [323]. 

3.2.5. Pharmacology 

3.2.5.1. Drug Properties 

  MDMA is a ring-substituted phenethylamine (Fig. 2) that 
is structurally similar to, but functionally distinct from, am-
phetamines and mescaline. MDMA possesses chirality but is 
typically produced in its racemic form as a white crystalline 
powder. Dosing can vary, with the therapeutic dose ranging 
between 75 mg and 125 mg, regardless of body weight (Ta-
ble  1).  The  onset  of  action  typically  occurs  30-60  minutes 
after  oral  administration,  with  peak  effects  occurring  be-
tween 75-120 minutes and the total duration of effects lasting 
3-6  hours.  In  MDMA-AT,  typically,  a  second  half-dose  is 
given after ~2 hours to extend the duration of effects up to 8 
hours.  Some  of  the  proposed  pharmacokinetic  and  pharma-
codynamic  mechanisms,  as  well  as  MDMA’s  receptor  pro-
file (Table 1), are reviewed below. 

3.2.5.2. Pharmacokinetics (Metabolism) 

  MDMA  is  primarily  (50-75%)  metabolized  by  hepatic 
cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). MDMA is first metabo-
lized  to  its  only  psychoactive  metabolite,  3,4-methylene-
dioxyamphetamine  (MDA),  mainly  by  CYP2D6  (>  30%) 
and  CYP3A4,  as  well  as  by  catechol-O-methyltransferase 
(COMT).  Nonlinear  pharmacokinetics  arise  via  autoinhibi-
tion of CYP2D6 and CYP2D8, resulting in zero-order kinet-
ics at higher doses, with sustained and higher concentrations 
of MDMA, particularly if the user ingests consecutive doses 
of the drug. MDMA and MDA are then further metabolized 
to inactive metabolites that are excreted in the urine (8-11%) 
as  conjugated  glucuronide  or  sulfate  metabolites  in  addition 
to the unchanged parent compound. The elimination-half-life 
is 7-9 hours [324]. 

3.2.5.3. Pharmacodynamics  

  MDMA’s  effects  on  neurotransmission  have  been  well 
characterized  both  in  rodents  and  in  humans  as  promoting 
neurotransmitter  release,  inhibiting  monoamine  reuptake 
transporters,  acting  directly  or  indirectly  upon  downstream 
receptors,  and  modulating  several  neurohormones,  all  con-
tributing  to  its  characteristic  subjective  and  physiological 
effects  [325-327].  MDMA  potently  inhibits  membranal 
monoamine reuptake transporters with relative selectivity for 
NET > SERT > DAT [326, 328] (Fig. 3). MDMA also acts 
to  reverse  the  typical  action  of  biogenic  monoamine  trans-
porters,  permitting  it  to  enter  presynaptic  nerve  terminals 
during  ion  exchange  in  place  of  extracellular  K+,  where  it

Fig.  (3).  Mechanisms  of  MDMA.  Left:  Typical  neurotransmission.  Right:  MDMA  acts  by  increasing  synaptic  monoamine  concentrations 
through three mechanisms: (1) inhibition of presynaptic membranal monoamine transporters with relative selectivity for NET > SERT > DAT 
[326, 328]; (2) reversal of monoamine transporters by MDMA entering presynaptic nerve terminals during ion exchange in place of extracel-
lular K+ and directly stimulating efflux of cytoplasmic monoamines; (3) binding as a substrate for vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT2 
causing  efflux  of  monoamines  from  vesicles  into  the  cytoplasm  and  inhibiting  uptake  of  monoamines  into  the  vesicles.  In  addition  to  the 
above, MDMA demonstrates affinity as an agonist at various receptors, including 5HT1A, 5HT2A, 5HT2B, 5HT2C, 5HT4, adrenergic, dopamine 
D1 and D2, among others [326, 329, 330]. Bottom Right: Within the hypothalamus, the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucle-
us (PVN) contain cell bodies of oxytocinergic neurons [330, 331]. These neurons contain presynaptic 5-HT4 and postsynaptic 5-HT1A recep-
tors  that,  when  stimulated  by  serotonin,  trigger  the  release  of  oxytocin  [329,  330].  Oxytocin  (OT)  has  several  downstream  targets  that  are 
thought to contribute to a wide range of behavioral and physiological effects [332] associated with MDMA and potentially underlie some of 
the therapeutic efficacy of MDMA-AT for PTSD [333, 334]. (A higher resolution/colour version of this figure is available in the electronic 
copy of the article). 

directly  stimulates  efflux  of  cytoplasmic  monoamines.  This 
drug additionally acts as a substrate for the vesicular mono-
amine  transporter  VMAT2,  causing  efflux  of  monoamines 
from  vesicles  into  the  cytoplasm  (Fig.  3).  In  addition  to 
modulating  synaptic  monoamine  concentrations  through 
mechanisms  outlined  above,  MDMA  has  direct  receptor  
action,  with  varying  affinities  as  an  agonist  at  serotonin  
5-HT1A,  5-HT2A,  5-HT2B,  and  5-HT2C;  a1-,  a2A-,  and  
b-adrenergic; dopamine D1 and D2; muscarinic M1 and M2; 
histamine  H1;  acetylcholine  nicotinic;  and  trace  amine-
associated (TAAR1) receptors [326] (Table 1). 

  To elucidate the importance of serotonin in mediating the 
entactogenic effects of MDMA, various human studies have 
experimentally pre-treated healthy controls with SSRI agents 
[327]  such  as  fluoxetine  [335],  paroxetine  [336],  and  cital-

opram [337], which compete with MDMA for SERT binding 
sites,  thought  to  prevent  transporter-mediated  serotonin  re-
lease. Pre-treatment with these agents attenuated many of the 
subjective,  physiological,  and  immunological  effects  of 
MDMA,  including  positive  mood,  feelings  of  sociability, 
closeness to others, emotional excitation, and systolic blood 
pressure,  among  others.  These  findings  suggest  that  seroto-
nin  release  is  at  least  partially  involved  in  the  prosocial  ef-
fects  of  MDMA  that  are  thought  to  be  therapeutically  rele-
vant  for  MDMA-AT.  In  addition  to  serotonin  release, 
MDMA  agonism  at  serotonin  5-HT1A  and  5-HT2A  receptors 
(Fig.  3)  appears  to  be  at  least  partially  contributory  to  its 
prosocial  effects,  as  demonstrated  through  experimental  co-
administration of MDMA with receptor antagonists, such as 
pindolol  and  ketanserin  [326,  338-340].  However,  these  re-

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    657 

sults  should  be  interpreted  with  some  caution,  as  ketanserin 
has  been  demonstrated  to  not  be  fully  selective  for  5-HT2A 
receptors [341]. 

  Other  evidence  from  a  pooled  analysis  of  four  Phase  II 
clinical trials points toward the role of serotonin in the thera-
peutic action of MDMA on PTSD and other fear-related dis-
orders.  Specifically,  participants  who  underwent  an  antide-
pressant  taper  (n  =  16)  prior  to  MDMA-AT  in  Phase  II 
MDMA  clinical  trials  were  found  to  have  significantly  re-
duced  responses  to  the  active  intervention  compared  with 
those who did not undergo a taper (n = 34) [325]. The study 
found that individuals who did not undergo an antidepressant 
taper prior to MDMA-AT demonstrated a significantly lower 
CAPS-5  score  (mean  =  45.7,  SD  =  27.17)  than  the  taper 
group (mean = 70.3, SD = 33.60), with more participants in 
the  non-taper  group  (63.6%)  no  longer  meeting  criteria  for 
PTSD  at  the  primary  endpoint  compared  with  those  in  the 
taper group (25.0%). There was also a significant difference 
between the non-taper and taper groups in changes in depres-
sion  symptom  severity  scores  and  measured  peak  systolic 
and  diastolic  blood  pressures,  with  the  non-taper  group 
demonstrating  greater  reductions  in  depression  symptom 
severity  and  higher  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressures. 
The  interpretation  of  these  findings  is  limited  by  the  small 
sample  size  and  would  benefit  from  including  participants 
from  Phase  III  clinical  trials.  Nevertheless,  the  results  are 
consistent with what is well-known about chronic SSRI use, 
in that they desensitize and downregulate 5-HT1A autorecep-
tors and produce changes in downstream gene transcription, 
leading to the downregulation of SERT, presumably impact-
ing  the  mechanisms  by  which  MDMA  exerts  its  potent  ef-
fects [325, 342]. 

  The  role  of  noradrenergic  signaling  on  the  effects  of 
MDMA  was  also  similarly  examined  through  pre-treatment 
with  NET  inhibitor  reboxetine,  with  significant  impacts  on 
subjective and physiological effects. Specifically, reboxetine 
pretreatment  led  to  attenuation  of  stimulation,  emotional 
excitation, and anxiety, as well as the blissful state and expe-
rience of unity elicited by MDMA; cardiovascular responses 
to MDMA were also reduced. Some adverse effects, such as 
tremors  and  restlessness,  were  diminished,  suggesting  the 
role of norepinephrine (NE) in their etiology. These findings 
are  consistent  with  the  role  of  NET-mediated  NE  release  in 
the  more  stimulant-typical  emotional  excitation  and  cardio-
vascular  response  to  MDMA.  Subjectively  improved  sense 
of well-being was not impacted by reboxetine pre-treatment, 
suggesting that this quality of MDMA is likely related more 
to  increased  serotonin  release  and  correspondent  agonist 
activity [343, 344]. 

  Consistent  with  the  above,  one  study  demonstrated  that 
most of the prosocial, psychostimulant-like, and entactogenic 
effects  of  MDMA  are  blocked  after  pre-treatment  with  the 
serotonin  and  norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitor  (SNRI)  du-
loxetine,  highlighting  the  important  role  of  SERT  and  NET 
reuptake  inhibition  in  the  subjective  and  physiologic  effects 
of  MDMA  [345].  Of  note,  dopamine  (DA)  activity  has  not 
been found to play a clinically meaningful role in the subjec-
tive  effects  of  MDMA  [340],  differentiating  it  from  other 
psychostimulants in its class, though some evidence suggests 
that  dopamine  release  is  enhanced  following  repeat  admin-

istrations  of  MDMA,  potentially  explaining  some  of  its  lia-
bility for misuse [346]. 

In  addition  to  the  neurotransmitter  changes  detailed 
above, MDMA uniquely leads to a marked increase in oxy-
tocin,  a  neurohormone  associated  with  trust  and  bonding. 
The  connection  between  MDMA-associated  elevations  in 
oxytocin  and  prosocial  behavior  has  been  observed  most 
robustly  in  animal  models  [347,  348],  leading  to  the  theory 
that  oxytocin  mediates  many  of  the  prosocial  effects  seen 
with MDMA in humans [298, 299, 334, 349]. A step further 
would  be  to  posit  that  oxytocin  is  involved  in  the  enhanced 
formation  of  a  therapeutic  alliance  seen  in  MDMA-AT. 
However,  experimental  data  thus  far  in  humans  have  not 
been  unanimously  conclusive  in  support  of  this  hypothesis, 
and  some  studies  have  failed  to  find  associations  between 
serum oxytocin concentrations and the subjective, emotional, 
empathic,  or  prosocial  effects  of  MDMA  [339,  350-352]. 
These  studies  are  not  without  limitations,  though,  as  serum 
oxytocin  levels  may  poorly  reflect  levels  seen  within  the 
brain. Further variability in the importance of oxytocin in the 
entactogenic  effects  of  MDMA  may  also  be  due  to  genetic 
variations.  Bershad  and  colleagues  [353]  examined  the  dif-
ferential effects of MDMA in healthy controls with oxytocin 
receptor  gene  (OXRT)  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms 
(SNPs) and found that individuals with the A/A allele geno-
type at rs53576 did not experience increased sociability after 
MDMA compared with G allele carriers. In a separate study, 
Vizeli and Liechti [348] discovered further genotypic varia-
tion  in  the  subjective  effects  of  MDMA,  with  individuals 
possessing  oxytocin  receptor  variant  rs1042778TT  demon-
strating  significantly  greater  feelings  of  trust  but  not  cogni-
tive or emotional empathy, with MDMA use, compared with 
those  having  other  receptor  variants.  Other  secondary  phar-
macodynamics of MDMA include dose-dependent increases 
in  cortisol,  prolactin,  adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH), 
dehydroepiandrosterone  (DHEA),  and  vasopressin  (AVP), 
with  changes  in  these  hormones  postulated  to  contribute  to 
the  acute  subjective  and  physiological  effects  of  MDMA  
[321, 354-358]. 

3.2.5.4. Safety Profile & Adverse Effects 

3.2.5.4.1. Adverse Effects 

In  the  most  recently  published  placebo-controlled  Phase 
III clinical trial of MDMA-AT for PTSD, the most frequent-
ly reported AEs within the MDMA group were muscle tight-
ness  (63%),  decreased  appetite  (52.2%),  nausea  (30.4%), 
hyperhidrosis  (19.6%),  feeling  cold  (19.6%),  restlessness 
(15.2%), mydriasis (15.2%), postural dizziness (13%), brux-
ism (13%), and nystagmus (13%) [40, 359] (Table 1). 

  Across  all  MAPS-sponsored  clinical  trials,  one  serious 
cardiac  adverse  reaction  occurred,  in  which  a  participant 
experienced  an  increase  in  the  frequency  of  pre-existing 
premature  ventricular  contractions.  Upon  hospital  monitor-
ing,  the  workup  revealed  no  cardiac  events,  and  there  were 
no  medical  sequelae  [359].  In  Phase  III  trials,  there  was  no 
increase  in  suicidality  in  the  MDMA  group  and  no  serious 
adverse  events  related  to  suicidality  in  the  MDMA  group 
[40].

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

In a long-term follow-up study from pooled Phase II tri-
als, at 12-month follow-up, seven participants (8.4%) report-
ed  experiencing  harm,  and  two  participants  reported  the 
harm  still  present.  The  most  commonly  reported  harm  was 
worsened mood, though none were rated as severe. Suicidal 
ideation  at  long-term  follow-up  was  24%  compared  with 
60% at baseline [39].  

  Notably,  some  patients  who  had  been  identified  as  re-
sponders  in  their  respective  studies  reported  adverse  conse-
quences  after  study  completion  that  they  attributed  to  their 
psychedelic  experiences.  This  has  included  suicidality  and 
other psychiatric decompensation [360]. Such forms of harm 
during  PAP  have  recently  been  probed  and  uncovered  in 
media reports and articles. For instance, the concept of over-
dependency, in which patients become overly reliant on their 
therapeutic relationship, has become a potential concern; this 
requires  further  investigation  [360].  Additional  concerns 
have  been  raised  around  the  lack  of  empirical  evidence  for 
the  psychological  support  provided  during  dosing  sessions, 
which  includes  the  use  of  tools  like  physical  touch,  where 
physical  contact  between  patients  and  therapists  is  allowed 
or  encouraged  to  provide  reassurance  or  emotional  support. 
As a participant’s state of consciousness is altered under the 
drug's effects and suggestibility is increased, boundaries and 
consent  can  become  a  serious  issue  [360].  The  most  severe 
outcome resulting from a level of intimacy that can occur in 
PAP occurred with a case of sexual boundary violation in a 
Phase  II  trial  of  MDMA-AT.  This  not  only  highlighted  a 
professional  and  ethical  failure  of  the  individual  therapists 
but also exposed the potential for real danger if safety moni-
toring  and  supervision  are  not  in  place  [360].  Seeking  pro-
gress  in  health  care  has  always  involved  identifying  where 
failure  has  arisen  so  as  to  facilitate  safe,  effective  advance-
ment;  PAP  must  not  be  viewed  any  differently.  Clearly, 
long-term  observational  trials  are  warranted  in  light  of  the 
concerns that have been raised. 

3.2.5.4.2. Interactions 

  As  MDMA  is  a  substrate  and  inhibitor  of  CYP2D6  en-
zymes, interactions with other CYP2D6 substrates or inhibi-
tors are well documented [327]. Some examples of substrates 
include  tricyclic  antidepressants  (amitriptyline,  clomipra-
mine,  desipramine)  and  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitor  antide-
pressants (citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine) [327]. Of clini-
cal  significance,  pre-treatment  with  paroxetine,  reboxetine, 
and  duloxetine  has  been  demonstrated  to  increase  MDMA 
plasma concentrations by 30%, 20%, and 16%, respectively, 
via CYP2D6 inhibition, with the added paradoxical effect of 
reducing  the  increases  in  systolic  blood  pressure  and  heart 
rate associated with MDMA ingestion. These drug combina-
tions  are  also  documented  to  largely  attenuate  most  subjec-
tive  and  physiological  effects  of  MDMA.  One  apparent  ex-
ception  is  noted  with  pre-treatment  by  bupropion,  which 
typically  increases  MDMA  plasma  concentration  by  15% 
and  is  also  associated  with  increased  positive  subjective  ef-
fects of MDMA and longer duration of action [327, 333]. As 
MDMA  is  a  substrate  and  inhibitor  for  CYP2D6  enzymes, 
the  risk  of  serotonergic  toxicity  and  other  life-threatening 
reactions seems to be most pronounced when MDMA is ad-
ministered  concomitantly  with  CYP2D6  inhibitors  such  as 

fluoxetine  and  paroxetine,  among  others,  in  case  studies  re-
viewed by Papaseit and colleagues [327]. 

  Other  important  drug-drug  interactions  include  the  con-
comitant use of agents that directly or indirectly affect 5-HT, 
such  as  monoamine  oxidase  inhibitors,  antihistamines  such 
as  chlorphenamine,  and  herbal  remedies  such  as  St.  John’s 
Wort or ginseng, among others. These can potentially induce 
a potentially fatal serotonergic toxicity, also known as sero-
tonin syndrome [327]. 

3.2.6. Rationale & Mechanisms for PTSD Treatment 

3.2.6.1. Social Effects  

  One  aspect  of  MDMA  that  clearly  distinguishes  it  from 
other  psychoactive  agents  is  its  enhancement  of  social  con-
nection  through  heightened  feelings  of  closeness  and  empa-
thy  [300],  historically  earning  its  label  as  an  empathogen. 
The mechanisms that underlie these reliable and reproducible 
prosocial changes in naturalistic and laboratory settings have 
been  explored  over  the  last  two  decades  through  placebo-
controlled studies. A meta-analysis performed by Regan and 
colleagues [361] aimed to quantify the effect size of sociabil-
ity  across  27  placebo-controlled  human  studies  with  a  total 
of 592 participants, and discovered that the average effect of 
MDMA on sociability is moderate to large (d = 0.86; 95% CI 
[0.68,  1.4];  r  =  .39;  95%  CI  [.32,  .46]).  While  the  studies 
included in the above reviews and meta-analysis did not in-
clude  clinical  samples  with  PTSD,  they  do  highlight  an  im-
portant and unique effect of MDMA that may help to contex-
tualize the efficacy of MDMA-AT for PTSD seen in clinical 
trials. 

  Many studies examining recreational MDMA users have 
gathered  subjective  reports  of  socially-relevant  mood  states 
such as feeling ‘loving’, ‘talkative’, ‘extroverted’, ‘sociable’, 
‘self-confident’,  ‘friendly’,  ‘open’,  ‘trusting’,  and  ‘close  to 
other people’, among others [301, 334, 339, 349, 351, 361]. 
These findings have been consistently reported, with MDMA 
robustly  increasing  prosocial  feelings  relative  to  placebo 
[301,  361].  Several  of  these  studies  also  evaluated  the  im-
pacts of MDMA on cognitive versus emotional empathy, i.e., 
the ability to identify and decode others’ emotional and men-
tal states for facial, verbal, and behavioral cues or the spon-
taneous  experience  of  others’  affective  states,  respectively. 
Interestingly,  the  findings  of  these  studies  have  largely 
demonstrated  that  MDMA  dampens  cognitive  empathy  by 
impairing  awareness  of  others’  negative  facial  emotional 
expressions, such as fear or anger [299, 301, 343, 362, 363], 
and enhances emotional empathy, particularly by increasing 
affective  responses  to  positive  emotions  identified  in  others 
[339, 345, 349, 364, 365].  

  A  recent  meta-analysis  found  a  moderate-to-large  effect 
(d  =  0.86;  95%  CI  [0.68,  1.04];  r  =  0.39;  95%  CI  [0.32, 
0.46]) of the acute effects of MDMA on self-reported socia-
bility-related  outcomes,  including  feelings  of  being  loved, 
increased  talkativeness,  and  an  overall  amplification  of 
friendliness  both  felt  receptively  and  outwardly  expressed 
[361].  These  subjective  changes  may  help  to  develop  a 
stronger  alliance  built  upon  trust  between  clients  and  thera-
pists,  which  could  lead  to  improved  treatment  outcomes 
[366, 367]. 

 
The Psychedelic Future of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    659 

  These  findings  have  been  strengthened  by  functional 
magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI)  data  that  have  shown 
attenuated amygdala reactivity to angry faces while enhanc-
ing  ventral  striatum  response  to  happy  faces  in  a  dose-
dependent  fashion  [365].  In  addition  to  impacting  social 
cognition,  some  studies  have  shown  that  MDMA  can  alter 
the  evaluation  of  self  by  enhancing  feelings  of  authenticity 
[368], increasing one’s willingness or ability to consider and 
share  emotional  memories  in  the  presence  of  another  [369], 
and cultivating perceptions of empathy from others in social 
interactions [298]. Perhaps synergistically, MDMA may also 
decrease  concerns  of  negative  evaluations  by  others  (i.e., 
decreasing social anxiety) [368], reducing the degree of per-
ceived social rejection from others and blunting the adverse 
effects  of  social  rejection  on  mood  and  self-esteem  [370]. 
Together, these alterations in social cognition may contribute 
to  the  benefits  and  potential  of  MDMA-AT  for  PTSD  by 
strengthening  the  formation  of  the  therapeutic  alliance 
through  enhancing  patient  perceptions  of  therapist  empathic 
awareness  and  tolerance  of  patient  distress  related  to  trau-
matic  memories.  The  therapeutic  alliance  is  considered  key 
to the success of treatment outcomes in PTSD, with one sys-
tematic  review  and  meta-analysis  finding  that  therapeutic 
alliance  is  a  significant  predictor  of  PTSD  outcomes  across 
various  types  of  psychological  therapies,  with  a  moderate 
effect size (aggregated correlation effect size r = 0.34) [371]. 
As MDMA is able to induce a subjective experience of feel-
ing  loving,  trusting,  and  talkative,  this  may  encourage  open 
and  honest  communication  [361],  strengthening  the  thera-
peutic  alliance  and  contributing  to  enduring  change  [371]. 
Furthermore, as mentioned above, MDMA has been demon-
strated  to  attenuate  the  perception  of  negative  emotions  in 
others  [365],  potentially  blunting  the  hypervigilant  disposi-
tion observed in those with trauma-related disorders and con-
tributing  to  a  sense  of  psychological  safety  while  working 
with  therapists.  Notably,  findings  concerning  dampened 
cognitive empathy toward emotions of negative valence and 
findings  of  increased  emotional  empathy  have  been  mixed 
[339, 349, 351, 372, 373], and caution is therefore warranted 
regarding  conclusions  about  the  prosocial  mechanisms  of 
MDMA-AT. These inconsistent results may reflect the limi-
tations intrinsic to the assessment of prosocial effects within 
laboratory conditions in the absence of other people and em-
phasize  what  is  already  well  characterized  about  the  im-
portance  of  ‘set  and  setting’  with  PAP  [281]:  specifically, 
that the prosocial effects of MDMA are most salient in social 
or relational settings [281, 298, 361, 368, 369, 372]. 

3.2.6.2. Insights from Neuroimaging Studies 

  The  body  of  neuroimaging  research  related  to  under-
standing  the  neural  correlates  of  the  subjective  effects  of 
MDMA (Fig. 4) is limited, though a few studies have begun 
to  elucidate  some  of  the  network  and  regional  changes  that 
may offer potential insights into the mechanisms underlying 
MDMA’s  therapeutic  efficacy  in  treating  PTSD.  A  limited 
body of neuroimaging research has also aided in our under-
standing of the mechanistic underpinnings of the efficacy of 
MDMA  in  treating  PTSD  by  elucidating  some  of  the  net-
work  and  regional  changes  that  relate  to  its  subjective  ef-
fects.  Early  work  by  Gamma  and  colleagues  [374]  utilized 
positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  to  examine  regional 

cerebral  blood  flow  (rCBF)  changes  after  a  single  dose  of 
MDMA  in  healthy  participants  and  discovered  distributed 
rCBF decreases in the motor and somatosensory cortex, tem-
poral  lobe  including  left  amygdala,  cingulate  cortex,  insula, 
and  thalamus,  and  increases  in  the  ventromedial  frontal  and 
occipital cortex, inferior temporal lobe, and cerebellum (Fig. 
4).  Of  particular  interest  is  the  observed  decrease  in  left 
amygdala  CBF,  a  brain  structure  wherein  increased  activity 
has been positively correlated with anxiety or sadness [374], 
and  has  been  observed  to  be  activated  during  expression  of 
trauma-related memory scripts in patients with PTSD [375]. 
The attenuation of activity in the amygdala has been consist-
ently  observed  across  neuroimaging  studies,  with  Carhart-
Harris  and  colleagues  [376]  measuring  reduced  CBF  in  the 
right amygdala, hippocampus, and other structures in healthy 
participants  after  MDMA,  with  ratings  of  the  intensity  of 
positive  mood  effects  of  MDMA  correlating  with  the  de-
creased  CBF  in  the  right  amygdala  and  hippocampus.  An-
other study utilized fMRI to examine the neuronal effects of 
MDMA on healthy participants exposed to socially threaten-
ing  (angry  and  fearful  faces)  and  socially  rewarding  (happy 
faces)  stimuli  [365].  They  found  that  MDMA  results  in  an 
attenuation  of  amygdala  reactivity  to  angry,  but  not  fearful, 
faces while appearing to enhance ventral striatum responses 
to  happy  faces.  This  mechanism  has  been  suggested  to  par-
tially  underlie  some  of  the  benefits  observed  when  combin-
ing MDMA with psychotherapy in those with PTSD. Specif-
ically,  patients  with  PTSD  are  often  hypervigilant  in  as-
sessing social threats, perhaps inhibiting the formation of the 
the  expression  of  distressing 
therapeutic  alliance  and 
thoughts and feelings. MDMA’s ability to reduce sensitivity 
to the subtle signs of negative emotions in others, such as in 
the  therapist  during  MDMA-AT,  may,  therefore,  facilitate 
therapeutic engagement [363]. 

  Also central to the psychotherapeutic process of MDMA-
AT in the treatment of PTSD is the revisiting and disclosure 
of  traumatic  memories.  One  of  the  rationales  for  the  use  of 
MDMA  as  an  aid  to  psychotherapy  is  that  it  is  thought  to 
allow  the  patient  to  engage  with  traumatic  material  more 
easily  [275].  This  hypothesis  was  probed  by  Carhart-Harris 
and  colleagues  [377]  with  an  fMRI  study  investigating  the 
effects  of  MDMA  on  the  recollection  of  favorite  and  worst 
autobiographical  memories  (AMs)  in  17  healthy  volunteers. 
Participants reported experiencing their worst AMs as signif-
icantly  less  negative  after  MDMA,  with  associated  reduced 
activations in the left anterior temporal cortex (Fig. 4), which 
is proximal to and densely connected with the amygdala. On 
the  other  hand,  participants  reported  their  favorite  AMs  as 
more  vivid,  emotionally  intense,  and  positive  after  MDMA, 
suggesting an intensification of emotionally positive memo-
ries.  This  finding  was  associated  with  increased  activations 
of  ventral,  visual,  and  somatosensory  cortices.  Together, 
these findings suggest that MDMA may be useful in psycho-
therapy for PTSD by lessening the impact of painful memo-
ries,  allowing  the  patient  to  engage  with  traumatic  material 
in  a  more  manageable  way  by  increasing  the  threshold  for 
hyperstimulation or ‘flooding’ via attenuation of left anterior 
temporal cortical responses to AMs [377]. 

  Changes  in  resting  state  functional  connectivity  (RSFC) 
after  MDMA  have  also  been  investigated  via  seed-based 
RSFC analyses with target regions of interest related to social

Fig. (4). Effects of MDMA on the brain. MDMA reduces cerebral blood flow in the right amygdala and hippocampus [376]. fMRI findings 
show  that  MDMA  attenuates  amygdala  reactivity  in  response  to  participant  exposure  to  angry  faces  while  amplifying  ventral  striatum  re-
sponse to happy faces [365]. The left anterior temporal cortex, a region proximal to and densely connected with the amygdala, demonstrates 
reduced  activation  in  healthy  participants  following  MDMA  intake.  This  reduced  activity  occurred  while  participants  were  reflecting  upon 
their worst autobiographical memories and was correlated with a reportedly less negative subjective experience of these memories. In con-
trast, participants reported their favorite autobiographical memories as more emotionally intense and positive after MDMA, which correlated 
with increased activations of the ventral visual and somatosensory cortices [377]. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the 
ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex is attenuated following MDMA consumption, an observation that has also been 
found following psilocybin administration [376, 378, 379]. Patients with PTSD demonstrate increased RSFC between the medial prefrontal 
cortex  and  hippocampus  [375],  whereas  MDMA  decreases  RSFC  between  these  two  regions  [376].  Additionally,  increases  in  amygdala-
hippocampal RSFC were observed after MDMA administration [376]; a notable finding as decreased amygdala-hippocampal RSFC has been 
seen in patients with PTSD [142]. Lastly, MDMA has been shown to decrease Salience Network FC, specifically between the right insula and 
superior frontal gyrus [380]. (A higher resolution/colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article). 

and  affective  processing.  Increased  ventromedial  prefrontal 
cortex  (vmPFC)-posterior  cinculate  cortex  (PCC)  coupling, 
associated  with  rumination  and  depression  [379],  has  been 
studied  by  Carhart-Harris  and  colleagues  [376].  Additional-
ly, in separate studies, observations have been made suggest-
ing  that  both  MDMA  and  psilocybin  decrease  the  vmPFC 
and  PCC  RSFC  [376,  378].  Other  network  changes  include 
decreased  medial  prefrontal  cortex  (mPFC)-hippocampal 
RSFC,  brain  regions  wherein  increased  activity  has  been 
observed  in  PTSD  [375],  and  increases  in  amygdala-
hippocampal  RSFC  [376],  a  finding  that  is  notable  as  de-
creased  amygdala-hippocampal  RSFC  has  been  observed  in 
patients with PTSD [142]. 

  Another  brain  region  of  interest,  the  insula  (Fig.  4),  has 
been  demonstrated  to  play  a  crucial  role  in  both  interocep-
tion, defined as the sensing of the internal state of one’s body 
[381], and anxiety [382], with increased activation observed 
in patients with PTSD [383]. This region has been highlight-
ed  as  an  ‘anchor’  of  the  Salience  Network  (SN),  which  has 
been experimentally demonstrated to integrate conflict moni-
toring, interoceptive-autonomic, and reward-processing cen-
ters  and  has  been  shown  to  have  increased  activity  in  those 
interpreted  to  have  trait  anxiety  [384]  and  PTSD  [385]. 
MDMA  has  been  shown  to  decrease  SN  functional  connec-
tivity (FC), specifically between the right insula and superior 

frontal gyrus (Fig. 4), speculatively explaining the therapeu-
tic role of MDMA in psychiatric disorders with anxiety as a 
core feature, such as PTSD [380]. 

3.2.6.3.  Reopening  of  a  Critical  Period  for  Social  Reward 
Learning 

Further  emphasizing  the  importance  of  ‘set  and  setting’ 
as  central  to  the  pronounced  prosocial  effects  induced  by 
MDMA, rigorous investigations on mouse models performed 
by  Nardou  and  colleagues  [329]  suggest  that  MDMA  is  ca-
pable of reopening the critical period for social reward learn-
ing  when  administered  in  social  settings.  This  finding  was 
distinctly absent in social isolation and may shed light on the 
absence of prosocial effects seen in some studies examining 
humans  in  social  isolation  in  the  laboratory.  Nardou  et  al. 
[329] conducted a series of experiments that reported mice to 
be maximally sensitive to social reward learning cues during 
adolescence,  with  a  declining  sensitivity  in  adulthood.  This 
critical  period  is  marked  by  a  change  in  the  magnitude  of 
oxytocin-dependent long-term depression (LTD) of glutama-
tergic inputs to medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accum-
bens.  Intraperitoneal  MDMA  was  observed  to  reopen  this 
critical period of social reward learning by binding to SERT, 
causing  efflux  of  5-HT,  and  activating  5-HT4  receptors  on

the postsynaptic parvalbumin oxytocin neuron terminals. The 
resultant synaptic release of oxytocin was observed to induce 
metaplastic  upregulation  of  oxytocin  receptors,  inducing 
LTD of excitatory transmission. The theory of MDMA reo-
pening  a  critical  period  of  learning  may  help  to  explain  the 
durability  of  benefits  extending  beyond  the  experimental 
sessions  and  emphasize  the  centrality  of  the  psychosocial 
intervention that occurs while the period is reopened [260]. 

3.2.6.4. Epigenetic Considerations 

  Epigenetic markers for PTSD have been a source of sig-
nificant  research,  and  DNA  methylation  changes  have  been 
implicated  as  potential  markers  of  treatment  prognosis  or 
symptom severity [171]. Given the importance of these find-
ings  on  the  broader  understanding  of  PTSD  and  subsequent 
treatments,  researchers  have  begun  exploring  epigenetic 
mechanisms  in  the  context  of  MDMA-AT  treatment  re-
sponse.  An  initial  examination  in  a  subsample  of  patients 
from  a  Phase  III  clinical  trial  found  that  DNA  methylation 
changes on CRHR1 and NR3C1 genes correlated with symp-
tom  reduction  after  treatment,  with  the  latter  demonstrating 
significantly  more  change  in  participants  who  experienced 
MDMA-AT compared with placebo [386]. This was a small 
sample  that  limited  analyses  to  three  HPA-axis-related 
genes; future research with larger cohorts and expanding the 
genes  of  interest  would  provide  further  insight  into  the  epi-
genetic mechanisms of MDMA-AT.  

3.2.6.5. Optimal Zone of Arousal 

In  the  trauma  literature,  a  helpful  framework,  the  ‘win-
dow  of  tolerance,’  was  developed  by  Siegel  [387]  to  better 
conceptualize  how  to  optimize  tolerability  and  efficacy  in 
psychotherapy for anxiety and trauma-related disorders. This 
framework  is  based  upon  the  well-established  finding  that 
patients with PTSD and trauma-related disorders are vulner-
able  to  states  of  hyperarousal  (e.g.,  emotional  flooding,  im-
pulsivity,  hypervigilance,  intrusive  imagery,  disorganized 
cognitive  processes)  [9,  388]  and  hyperarousal  (e.g.,  emo-
tional  flatness  or  numbness,  disabled  cognitive  processing, 
helplessness  or  hopelessness)  [9,  388],  largely  preventing 
patients from processing traumatic material in psychotherapy 
[9].  The  “optimal  arousal  zone”  [389],  between  the  two  ex-
tremes  of  hyper-  and  hypoarousal,  generates  a  “window  of 
tolerance”  wherein  emotional  and  physiological  arousal  re-
lated to traumatic material can be processed without disrupt-
ing the functioning of the system [9, 387]. Through the com-
bination  of  mechanisms  detailed  above,  MDMA  is  able  to 
buffer  against  the  onset  of  hyper-  and  hypoarousal  states 
[333], thereby inducing an “optimal arousal zone” for several 
hours  while  in  a  safe  psychotherapy  setting,  permitting  a 
deeper exploration of trauma-related events and their effects 
on relationships and other aspects of the patient’s life [274]. 

3.2.6.6. Memory Reconsolidation and Fear Extinction Hy-
potheses 

Several  investigations  have  suggested  that  MDMA-AT 
reduces PTSD symptoms by altering the process of memory 
reconsolidation  and  aiding  in  the  learning  process  of  fear 
extinction  [296,  390-392].  This  model,  supported  by  evi-
dence in animal models (reviewed in [391]), is beginning to 

be  investigated  in  human  samples  [390,  393],  and  might  be 
the  next  step  in  translating  preliminary  evidence  described 
above,  including  pharmacodynamic  changes  in  neurotrans-
mitters and hormone systems involved in learning, memory, 
and fear extinction (e.g., 5-HT, DA, NE, acetylcholine, glu-
tamate, cortisol, oxytocin, BDNF) [394]. 

  The general premise of memory reconsolidation is based 
upon the concept that a recalled memory enters a labile state 
for a limited period prior to reconsolidation, permitting mod-
ification  by  a  protein  synthesis-dependent  process.  This  re-
called  memory  is  then  contrasted  with  the  present  moment, 
creating a prediction error or mismatch, allowing revision of 
the  memory  through  molecular  mechanisms.  As  the  subjec-
tive  state  induced  by  MDMA  is  often  considered  positive, 
through  neurochemical  changes  including  increased  release 
of monoamines such as serotonin and dopamine, and is expe-
rienced within the therapeutic container intrinsic to MDMA-
AT,  often  experienced  as  safe  and  supportive,  the  memory 
can be amended with less fear [391, 392, 394]. 

Fear  extinction  is  based  on  the  classical  learning  para-
digm  described  previously  in  Section  2.7:  Neurobiology  of 
PTSD.  MDMA’s  hypothesized  ability  to  contribute  to  fear 
extinction has been attributed to direct and indirect effects of 
increased  serotonin  [395,  396]  and  regional  and  network 
changes induced by MDMA. Notable network changes (Fig. 
4) include the attenuated activity of the amygdala [363, 374], 
left anterior temporal cortex [377], and insula [380]; increas-
es  in  amygdala-hippocampal  RSFC  [376];  inhibited  top-
down overmodulation of the mPFC on emotional processing 
of limbic regions [394]; and perhaps others. 

3.2.6.7. Post-Traumatic Growth 

Post-traumatic growth (PTG) has been defined as the posi-
tive  psychological  change  associated  with  self-perception, 
interpersonal relationships, and philosophy of life after strug-
gling  with  challenging  life  circumstances.  Gorman  and  col-
leagues  [42]  examined  this  construct  via  a  pooled  analysis  
(n  =  60)  of  three  MAPS-sponsored  Phase  II  clinical  studies 
of  MDMA-AT  for  PTSD  that  included  the  Posttraumatic 
Growth  Inventory  (PTGI)  [397].  PTG  was  measured  be-
tween the experimental vs. control groups, with the MDMA 
group demonstrating more PTG (p < 0.001) and a larger re-
duction  in  PTSD  severity  (p  <  0.001)  compared  with  the 
placebo group, with a large effect size (Hedges’ g = 1.14 for 
the  PTGI  and  g  =  0.88  for  the  CAPS-IV)  and  durability  of 
effects at 1-year follow-up. The authors note that while PTG 
was correlated with reductions in PTSD symptom severity, it 
is unknown whether PTG itself is causally decreasing PTSD 
symptom severity or, rather, is a product of the reduction in 
PTSD symptom severity [42]. Future research efforts should 
aim to ascertain whether this construct represents an underly-
ing  psychological  mechanism  of  MDMA-AT,  as  this  may 
inform  the  optimization  of  MDMA-AT  treatment  protocols 
to more effectively ameliorate symptoms of PTSD. 

3.2.7. Evidence Involving MDMA for PTSD Treatment 

3.2.7.1. Clinical Trials 

  Clinical  trials  of  MDMA-AT  (Table  3)  have  been  con-
ducted for PTSD (including a pilot of MDMA-assisted cou-

ples 
therapy).  Six  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-
controlled Phase II trials and one Phase III trial have evalu-
ated the safety and efficacy of MDMA-AT for PTSD. Inclu-
sion  criteria  for  these  trials  required  eligible  participants  to 
have  symptoms  of  PTSD  for ≥   6  months  with  a  CAPS-5 
score  of ≥   50  for  the  Phase  II  trials  [282]  and ≥   35  for  the 
Phase  III  trial  [40],  reflecting  severe  PTSD.  Phase  II  trials 
also  required  participants  to  have  at  least  one  prior  inade-
quate  response  to  psychotherapy  and/or  pharmacotherapy. 
Prospective participants were excluded if they had a comor-
bid  primary  psychotic  disorder,  bipolar  I  disorder,  dissocia-
tive  identity  disorder,  eating  disorders  with  active  purging, 
current  borderline  personality  disorder,  current  alcohol  or 
substance use disorders, as well as if they had medical comor-
bidities  that  could  make  receiving  a  sympathomimetic  agent 
harmful,  such  as  uncontrolled  hypertension,  arrhythmia,  or 
baseline  prolongation  of  QT  interval.  Participants  were  also 
required to taper off their psychiatric medications prior to be-
ginning, though as needed, the use of sedative-hypnotics and 
anxiolytics  was  permitted.  Initial  screening  procedures  in-
cluded medical and psychiatric evaluations [40, 282]. 

Following  screening  procedures,  participants  were  ran-
domized  to  receive  either  a  placebo,  active  control  (25-40 
mg), or active dose (75-125 mg) of MDMA. Controls varied 
across  studies,  with  some  utilizing  an  inactive  placebo  and 
others  using  a  low  dose  of  MDMA  (25  mg,  30  mg,  or  40 
mg).  Participants  assigned  to  the  control  groups  were  given 
the  option  to  “cross  over”  and  receive  two  or  three  active 
MDMA-AT sessions [282]. 

From  2004-2017,  six  randomized,  placebo-controlled 
Phase II clinical trials were conducted evaluating the effica-
cy and safety of MDMA-AT in the treatment of moderate to 
extreme PTSD (Table 3). These studies are summarized by a 
pooled  analysis  and  long-term  follow-up  (LTFU)  study 
[282]. Changes in CAPS-5 scores were examined as the pri-
mary outcome, with results demonstrating a statistically sig-
nificant  change  between  the  active  and  control  groups  (p  < 
0.001),  and  a  large  treatment  effect  size  (d  =  0.8).  In  the 
MDMA  group,  54%  of  participants  no  longer  met  PTSD 
diagnostic criteria at 1-2 months compared with 23% of the 
control group [282]. Jerome and colleagues [39] performed a 
separate pooled analysis of these same participants to evalu-
ate  PTSD  symptoms  at  LTFU  and  determine  if  there  were 
any  additional  benefits  and  harms  that  emerged  between 
study exit (1-2 months) and 12 months. At 12 months post-
treatment, 67% of participants who had received MDMA-AT 
no  longer  met  the  criteria  for  PTSD,  a  significant  increase 
compared with participants who no longer met the criteria at 
the  study  exit.  These  results  indicate  that  MDMA-AT,  with 
appropriate  preparation  and  follow-up,  supports  clinically 
significant improvements in PTSD symptoms at least 1 year 
post-treatment [39]. 

In 2021, results were published of a randomized, double-
blind,  placebo-controlled  Phase  III  clinical  trial  evaluating 
the  efficacy  and  safety  of  MDMA-AT  to  treat  patients  with 
severe PTSD across 15 study sites, with expanded inclusion 
criteria  permitting  participants  with  often  excluded  features 
such  as  dissociation,  depression,  and  childhood  trauma  to 
participate  [40]  (Table  3).  Participants  in  the  experimental 
arm received 80 mg of MDMA with an optional 40 mg sup-

plemental dose during the first experimental session and 120 
mg  of  MDMA  with  an  optional  60  mg  supplemental  dose 
during  the  second  and  third  experimental  sessions.  Results 
showed  that  MDMA  significantly  attenuated  PTSD  symp-
toms  as  compared  with  placebo,  demonstrating  a  large  pla-
cebo plus psychotherapy-subtracted effect size of Cohen’s d 
= 0.91 and within-group treatment effect size of Cohen’s d = 
2.1 in the MDMA group and Cohen’s d = 1.2 in the placebo 
group.  MDMA  also  significantly  reduced  clinician-rated 
functional  impairment  as  measured  by  the  Sheehan  Disabil-
ity  Scale  (SDS)  between  treatment  arms,  with  a  moderate 
effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.43). Importantly, 28 of 42 (67%) 
of  the  participants  in  the  MDMA  group  no  longer  met  the 
diagnostic  criteria  for  PTSD  after  three  sessions,  and  14  of 
42 participants (33%) met the criteria for remission. In other 
exploratory analyses, MDMA was found to be equally effec-
tive in participants demonstrating features typically associat-
ed  with  resistance  to  currently  available  treatments,  includ-
ing those with the dissociative subtype of PTSD, a history of 
alcohol  or  substance  use  disorder,  or  severe  childhood  trau-
ma,  and  was  able  to  reduce  symptoms  of  depression  with  a 
moderate effect size of treatment (d = 0.67) [40]. 

Feduccia  and  colleagues  [398]  compared  the  efficacy  of 
MDMA-AT  to  the  two  FDA-approved  medications  for 
PTSD, sertraline and paroxetine, as per Phase III clinical trial 
data. The effect sizes of currently indicated medications are 
approximately  halved  (sertraline:  Cohen’s  d  =  0.31-0.37; 
paroxetine:  Cohen’s  d  =  0.45-0.56)  compared  with  that  of 
MDMA-AT  (Cohen’s  d  =  0.9)  [398].  While  the  efficacy  of 
these treatments cannot be compared directly to one another 
without  head-to-head  trials,  the  data  are  compelling  and 
promising  that  effective  treatment  for  PTSD  may  be  on  the 
horizon,  with  potential  advantages  over  the  daily  pharma-
cotherapy model currently in place. 

sessions 

  Given the success of MDMA-AT for PTSD in individu-
als,  Monson  and  colleagues  [399]  conducted  a  small  and 
uncontrolled  study  examining  the  safety  and  efficacy  of 
therapy 
MDMA-facilitated  cognitive-behavioral  conjoint 
(CBCT)  for  PTSD  in  six  couples  wherein  one  partner  was 
diagnosed with PTSD (Table 3). The couples underwent two 
MDMA  experimental  sessions  in  conjunction  with  manual-
ized  CBCT,  with  MDMA  dosages  of  75  mg  and  100  mg,  
and optional supplemental half doses, for the first and second 
experimental 
respectively.  Primary  outcome 
measures  included  the  CAPS-5,  patient  and  partner-rated 
PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and Couples Satisfac-
tion  Index  (CSI),  which  were  assessed  at  baseline,  between 
the two experimental sessions, at the end of the study, and at 
3  and  6  months  follow-up.  Results  indicated  significant  im-
provements  in  clinician-assessed,  patient-rated,  and  partner-
rated  PTSD  symptoms,  with  follow-up  effect  sizes  ranging 
from d = 1.85-3.59. Significant improvements were also not-
ed  in  patient  depression,  sleep,  emotion  regulation,  and 
trauma-related  beliefs,  and  inpatient-  and  partner-rated  rela-
tionship  adjustment  and  happiness  (Table  3).  The  authors 
note  that  across  all  outcomes,  the  effects  were  generally 
largest at 6 months follow-up [399], a finding consistent with 
the durable and growing benefits of MDMA-AT for PTSD at 
12  months  [39].  While  this  study  is  small  and  has  obvious

tion  in  those  suffering  from  PTSD,  and  may  also  aid  in  the

cal symptoms of PTSD. 

3.2.8. Conclusion 

  MDMA is a promising therapeutic for PTSD when com-
bined with manualized psychotherapy, with efficacy demon-
strated  even  in  clinical  profiles  of  PTSD  often  associated 
with treatment resistance [40]. The data thus far suggest that 
MDMA-AT is potentially non-inferior to, and may have cer-
tain  advantages  over,  existing  treatments  for  PTSD  [398], 
though  head-to-head  studies  are  required  to  clarify  this 
knowledge gap. MDMA-AT also reflects a potential for the 
emergence  of  a  new  paradigm  for  the  treatment  of  trauma-

related  disorders  that  differs  from  the  contemporary  psychi-
atric  model.  The  unique  entactogenic  properties  of  MDMA 
induce  a  subjective  state  that  fosters  prosocial  effects,  de-
creased  threat  recognition,  and  improved  trust,  creating  a 
simultaneous emotional vulnerability and engagement, char-
acterized  as  “the  optimal  zone  of  arousal”  in  the  safe  and 
supportive  therapeutic  container  established  by  the  thera-
pists.  Within  this  space,  distressing  memories  and  emotions 
can  be  processed  in  a  more  tolerable  way,  possibly  giving 
way  to  new  insights,  healing,  resilience,  and  post-traumatic 
growth  (PTG).  Changes  associated  with  MDMA  are  begin-
ning  to  be  examined  with  neuroimaging  techniques,  with 
early observations thus far substantiating measurable chang-
es  in  neural  connectivity  (Fig.  4)  that  correlate  with  subjec-
tive reports.

3.3. Classic Psychedelics 

3.3.1. Introduction and History 

“Classic  psychedelics”  are  a  category  of  psychoactive 
substances  derived  or  synthesized  from  natural  resources. 
These compounds are often associated with activity at sero-
tonergic  receptors,  most  notably  the  5-HT2A  receptors, 
though other receptors, including dopaminergic and adrener-
gic,  are  thought  to  have  significant  roles  in  their  psychoac-
tive effects (as reviewed in [400]). Classic psychedelics can 
be  divided  into  tryptamines  and  phenethylamines,  which 
have differing chemical structures and receptor-binding pro-
files  [401].  The  link  with  serotonin  is  often  more  strongly 
emphasized  with  tryptamine  compounds;  this  association 
was proposed soon after the discovery of the serotonin mole-
cule, which biochemists noticed had a structural resemblance 
to  tryptamines  that  were  concurrently  popular  in  scientific 
research  [402].  While  fundamental  differences  exist  among 
the classic psychedelics, including their chemical structures, 
receptor profiles, and associated neurobiological and psycho-
logical  effects,  they  are  categorized  together  due  to  overall 
similarities in structure and mechanisms of action. The three 
classic  psychedelics  of  focus  in  this  review  are  psilocybin, 
lysergic  acid  diethylamide-25  (LSD-25,  simplified  to  LSD), 
and  ayahuasca  (Table  1;  Fig.  2).  These  compounds  were 
chosen  due  to  the  depth  of  the  historical  and  contemporary 
research into their psychotherapeutic properties. 

3.3.1.1. Psilocybin 

  Throughout  history,  pre-Columbian  Mesoamerican  cul-
tures  used  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  in  cultural,  therapeu-
tic,  and  religious  rituals.  Ingestion  of  hallucinogenic  mush-
rooms in ritual ceremonies is a practice that was widespread 
throughout  the  Valley  of  Mexico  and  Central  America,  and 
is  thought  to  date  back  at  least  3,500  years.  The  Maya  and 
Aztecs  consumed  Psilocybe  cubensis,  known  to  them  as 
k’aizalaj  Okox  and  teonanácatl,  respectively.  These  mush-
rooms were also consumed by the Huastec, Totonac, Mazatec, 
and Mixtec peoples [403]. 

Several  16th-century  historians,  notably  the  Spanish 
Franciscan  friar  Bernardino  de  Sahagún,  published  ethno-
graphic  research  studies  in  the  Mesoamerican  region  and 
described Aztecs using sacred mushrooms, or “God’s Flesh”, 
during their religious ceremonies [403, 404]. Efforts to study 
hallucinogenic mushrooms continued in the early 20th centu-
ry,  but  these  academic  pursuits  were  halted  by  the  Second 
World  War.  It  was  not  until  1957,  with  the  publication  of 
“Seeking  the  Magic  Mushroom”  in  Life  magazine,  that  the 
general  public  was  first  introduced  to  psychoactive  mush-
rooms. This photo essay chronicled the trip made to Huautla 
de  Jiménez  in  Oaxaca,  Mexico,  by  amateur  mycologist  R. 
Gordon  Wasson,  his  wife  Valentina  Pavlovna  Wasson,  and 
New  York  Society  photographer  Allan  Richardson.  During 
this  trip,  they  were  allowed  to  participate  in  a  mushroom 
ritual  with  Mazatec  curandera  Maria  Sabina  [405].  Wasson 
conducted a follow-up expedition shortly thereafter and was 
joined  by  French  mycologist  Roger  Heim,  who  identified 
several of the mushrooms as species of the genus Psilocybe. 
After  successfully  cultivating  the  mushrooms  in  France, 
Heim sent a sample of dried Psilocybe mexicana mushrooms 

for  chemical  analysis  to  Albert  Hofmann,  who  then  charac-
terized the active compound in these mushrooms and named 
it  psilocybin  (Table  1;  Fig.  2).  Hofmann  also  identified  the 
dephosphorylated  form  of  psilocybin,  which  he  named 
psilocin [268]. 

3.3.1.2. LSD 

In  addition  to  psilocybin,  Hofmann  was  involved  in  the 
synthesis  and  exploration  of  another  classic  psychedelic, 
lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (Table 1; Fig. 2). Hofmann 
developed this compound in 1938 while exploring the phar-
macological  properties  of  ergot  alkaloids  in  the  attempt  to 
develop a circulatory and respiratory stimulant. The variation 
of  LSD  specifically  known  for  its  hallucinogenic  properties 
was  the  25th  lysergamide  he  synthesized  (LSD-25).  While 
initially, the compound appeared unnotable, aside from some 
slight restlessness in test animals, he resynthesized it in 1943 
to  continue  testing.  During  this  time,  he  was  inadvertently 
exposed to the compound and experienced restlessness, diz-
ziness, visual imagery and stimulation, and a “not unpleasant 
intoxicated-like  condition”.  Hofmann  tested  the  compound 
on himself more purposefully following this experience, and 
while  this  involved  adverse  events  such  as  difficulty  speak-
ing, paranoia, and fear of death, he also reported an internal 
calm and witnessed fantastic imagery towards the end of the 
experience,  waking  up  the  following  day  with  a  positive 
sense of well-being and connection to the world around him 
[265]. 

  Contemporary psychiatrists were seeking ways to induce 
an  intoxicated  state  that  might  aid  the  treatment  of  patients 
with  psychosis,  having  observed  improved  verbalization  of 
internal struggles when in a “toxic delirium” [406]. LSD was 
seen as a promising substance that could facilitate the reacti-
vation  of  difficult  emotional  states  with  enough  positive  ef-
fects to allow for tolerable engagement with painful memo-
ries.  It  was  also  thought  to  induce  disruptions  in  repressive 
barriers without the sedative effects of other substances used 
at  the  time  [406].  Early  use  of  LSD  in  human  subjects  pro-
vided  a  range  of  outcomes,  with  smaller  doses  leading  to 
predominantly  euphoric  reports.  Many  experiments  were 
conducted without appropriate medical supervision or appre-
ciation for the subjective effects [265]. Werner Stoll is often 
credited  as  having  published  the  first  therapeutic  study  on 
LSD, and the use of LSD in research expanded significantly 
in  the  subsequent  years,  leading  to  multiple  symposia,  with 
alcohol  use  disorder  (AUD)  and  end-of-life  anxiety  becom-
ing the most common indications of study [267]. Dutch psy-
chiatrist Jan Bastiaans touted LSD as particularly helpful for 
“inhibited  fighters,”  whom  he  defined  as  traumatized  indi-
viduals who have rich, intense life experiences. In particular, 
he  noted  that  trauma  survivors  typically  struggle  to  express 
their emotions and found they were able to do so more effec-
tively during treatment with LSD [407].  

Increasing  recreational  use,  misconceptions  about  the 
subjective  effects  of  the  drug,  lack  of  adequate  regulation, 
and  expiration  of  the  patent  led  the  original  developers  of 
LSD to discontinue production in 1965 [265]. However, rec-
reational use and clinical experimentation continued.

3.3.1.3. Ayahuasca 

  Ayahuasca  is  a  classic  psychedelic  derived  from  plants 
with a rich religious and spiritual history. Ayahuasca, mean-
ing “vine of the soul” in the indigenous Quechua language, is 
an  Amazonian  brew  with  psychoactive  properties  derived 
from the synergistic effect produced by two plants. In addi-
tion  to  its  medicinal  properties,  it  is  widely  known  for  its 
uses  in  shamanic  and  ritualistic  ceremonies  as  a  mode  of 
communication  between  the  spirits  of  plants  and  humans 
[408].  The  most  common  preparation  involves  boiling  the 
bark and stems of Banisteriopsis caapi, which contain the β-
carboline  alkaloids  harmine,  tetrahydroharmine  (THH),  and 
harmaline,  with  the  leaves  of  Psychotria  viridis  containing 
DMT [409] (Table 1; Fig. 2). 

  Ayahuasca, also known as hoasca, yage or yaje, namate, 
and daime, is widely used among indigenous tribes through-
out the Amazon Basin, particularly Peru, Colombia, and Ec-
uador, as well as Brazil [410]. Archeological evidence in the 
form of figurines, vessels, and snuffing trays has shown the 
use  of  psychoactive  plants  as  early  as  1500  BC  [410],  alt-
hough  it  is  unclear  if  this  included  ayahuasca.  To  this  day, 
the  origins  of  its  use  and  preparation  have  not  been  deter-
mined.  Shamans,  known  as  ayahusaceros  in  Iquitos,  Peru, 
claim  that  the  origin  of  their  knowledge  about  ayahusaca’s 
unique  preparation  comes  from  the  plants  themselves,  re-
ferred  to  as  “the  plants  that  teach”  [411].  The  earliest  pub-
lished report on the use of ayahuasca was written by Ecuado-
rian  geographer  Manuel  Villavicencio  in  1858  [412],  spur-
ring  the  beginning  of  Western  ethnographers  investigating 
the  chemical  and 
taxonomic  properties  of  ayahuasca 
throughout  the  mid-19th  to  early  20th  centuries.  It  has  long 
been a part of Mestizo folk medicine in the northwest Ama-
zon  as  a  means  of  healing  physical,  mental,  and  spiritual 
ailments. Additionally, ayahuasca plays a central role in reli-
gious  sacraments  within  Brazilian  syncretic  churches,  most 
notably  the  União  do  Vegetal  (UDV)  and  Santo  Daime. 
Since  the  Western  discovery  of  its  potential  for  improved 
insight, personal growth, and emotional, spiritual, and physi-
cal healing, its indigenous use has become popularized, gain-
ing global attention [413]. In addition to various independent 
and  religious  retreats,  nonprofits  such  as  the  Heroic  Hearts 
Project and Veterans of War [414, 415] have been developed 
to connect veterans with ayahuasca centers to ensure access 
and promote healing from trauma among this population that 
may  reap  particular  benefits  from  ayahuasca's  unique  thera-
peutic  potential.  Increasingly,  clinical  investigations  are  be-
ing  conducted  to  clarify  and  determine  the  validity  of  its 
proposed therapeutic uses. 

3.3.2. Therapeutic Model 

  As  evidenced  through  the  histories  of  these  substances, 
classic  psychedelics  have  long  been  used  for  therapeutic 
purposes.  Modern  research  has  begun  utilizing  more  struc-
tured  descriptions  and  protocols  regarding  the  therapeutic 
process in order to more accurately assess the specific condi-
tions for which they are helpful and the therapeutic contexts 
that allow for optimal treatment. It is likely that the frame of 
these therapies will change as more exploration into the pro-
cess occurs, as there are many unanswered questions, includ-
ing  the  optimal  number  and  frequency  of  doses,  the  most 

supportive  set  and  setting,  and  the  nature  and  number  of 
therapy  providers.  Summarizing  existing  knowledge,  a  re-
view of the current standards for classic psychedelic-assisted 
psychotherapies is provided below.   

3.3.2.1. Psilocybin 

  Most  commonly,  psilocybin-assisted  psychotherapy  is 
administered by two therapists across three phases: pretreat-
ment  sessions,  treatment  sessions,  and  post-treatment  ses-
sions [278, 416, 417]. The duration and number of pretreat-
ment sessions vary across clinical trials [278]; however, they 
always  occur  before  the  first  psilocybin  treatment  session 
and are intended to build the therapeutic alliance and prepare 
the patient to undergo the experience safely [278, 416, 417].  

  The  treatment  sessions  during  which  the  active  com-
pound is ingested vary in duration and frequency across trials 
[278].  During  the  treatment  session(s),  participants  are  en-
couraged  to  lie  down,  wear  eyeshades,  and  listen  to  music. 
These sessions should be conducted in an aesthetically pleas-
ing  room  designed  to  resemble  a  living  room  and  thus  en-
hance patients' feelings of comfort [416, 417]. This pleasant 
environment  and  the  presence  of  music  during  psychedelic 
treatment  sessions  contributes  to  meaningful  experiences 
[295, 418-420], and the music has been described by partici-
pants  with  treatment-resistant  depression  (TRD)  as  substan-
tially  influencing  their  therapeutic  experience  [295].  The 
therapeutic  approach  used  during  the  treatment  session  is 
inner-directive  and  supportive,  with  direct  interaction  be-
tween participants and therapists typically increasing toward 
the last hour of the treatment session. This is in contrast with 
MDMA-assisted  therapy  (MDMA-AT),  which  consists  of  a 
more  continuous  and  substantial  therapist  involvement  over 
the  course  of  the  treatment  session  [278].  This  therapeutic 
style is thought to facilitate meaningful or spiritually signifi-
cant  experiences  [417,  421]  in  which  the  individual  is  the 
source  of  healing,  and  psychedelic-assisted  psychotherapy 
(PAP)  only  functions  to  facilitate  that  inner  healing  process 
[422]. 

  To  that  end,  participants  are  encouraged  to  direct  their 
attention  to  their  internal  experience  during  the  psilocybin 
treatment  sessions.  The  systematized  review  mentioned 
above found that all 11 trials that were investigated used this 
non-directive,  supportive  therapeutic  approach  in  order  to 
facilitate a meaningful or mystical-type experience. In these 
trials,  therapists  provided  psychological  support  in  several 
forms  during  the  session,  such  as  through  reassuring  touch, 
reality  orientation,  and  nonjudgmental,  empathic  listening 
[278].  

  The number and duration of post-treatment sessions also 
varies across clinical trials of psilocybin [278], but all trials 
have dedicated at least one post-treatment session to debrief-
ing  about  the  patient’s  experience  during  the  treatment  ses-
sion.  Some  studies  refer  to  post-treatment  sessions  as  “inte-
gration sessions'' because they aim to help the patient process 
the experience in such a way that ultimately leads to lasting 
therapeutic effects. In the debriefing process, the patient pro-
vides  a  detailed  account  of  the  experience  and  is  asked  to 
reflect on the significance of the experience [416]. In psilo-
cybin-assisted psychotherapy models that incorporate multi-
ple  dosing  sessions,  debriefing  sessions  can  and  often  do

occur  between  treatment  sessions  [278].  In  addition  to  de-
briefing,  “integration”  may  also  include  additional  therapy 
sessions  over  weeks  to  months,  intended  to  further  explore 
the content of the psychedelic experience. With regard to the 
treatment of psychiatric conditions like PTSD, Bogenschutz 
and  Forcehimes  [416]  specify  that  the  integration  process 
would  also  include  exploring  the  meaning  and  implications 
of  the  experience  in  relation  to  the  area  of  desired  change. 
They posited that this exploration could entail (a) a new un-
derstanding of the symptoms, (b) a change in the symptoms 
or  how  they  are  experienced,  (c)  new  intentions  around  the 
management  of  the  symptoms,  (d)  new  insights  about  how 
the symptoms can be managed, and (e) behavioral changes to 
better manage symptoms [416]. 

3.3.2.2. LSD 

  The vast majority of research into LSD-assisted psycho-
therapy occurred prior to the more modern standardization of 
treatment protocols. While there is a broad range of literature 
on  the  psychological  effects  that  clinicians  and  researchers 
produced in the 1950s and ‘60s, there was significant varia-
tion  in  treatment  settings  and  procedures,  and  that  variation 
continues  to  the  present  day.  A  single  dose  of  LSD  is  the 
most common dosing procedure, though repeated doses with 
multiple weeks in between, as well as dose escalation proce-
dures, have been utilized [423].  

  Albert Hofmann’s initial proposal for the therapeutic use 
of  LSD  involved  gradually  increasing  doses  throughout 
treatment.  He  differentiated  between  psycholytic  therapy, 
which involved lower doses over the course of multiple ses-
sions  and  included  integration  in  group  discussions  and  art 
therapy,  versus  psychedelic  therapy,  in  which  participants 
engaged  in  intense  preparation  before  being  given  a  single 
high  dose  of  LSD  in  order  to  produce  a  “shock  effect”  and 
subsequent mystical experience [265]. Treatment approaches 
in  the  following  decades  continued  to  utilize  psycholytic 
therapy  to  uncover  material  for  analysis,  incorporating  low 
doses  of  LSD  into  long-term  therapy  with  psychotherapy 
utilized before, during, and after dosing sessions [424]. Psy-
chedelic therapy was also utilized with great frequency, alt-
hough  some  researchers  divided  it  into  two  subcategories: 
psychedelic-chemotherapy,  which  focused  primarily  on  the 
administration of the drug and provided limited (if any) inte-
gration, and psychedelic-peak therapy, which utilized higher 
doses  than  psycholytic  therapy  but  incorporated  intensive 
concurrent psychotherapy.  

Psychedelic-peak therapy appears to most closely reflect 
current  PAP  protocols.  In  order  to  achieve  the  peak  experi-
ence  of  this  form  of  therapy,  preparation  occurred  over  an 
average  of  20  hours  and  involved  establishing  rapport  and 
preparing  patients  to  let  go  of  themselves  and  be  open  to 
what  is  encountered  during  the  experience.  Experimental 
sessions  occurred  in  treatment  rooms  designed  to  feel  like 
comfortable living spaces, with both the therapist and a nurse 
present. Patients typically reclined with eye shades and with 
music  playing  to  facilitate  immersion  in  the  experience. 
Therapy  to  follow  up  on  the  experience  began  even  as  the 
drug  effects  faded  and  then  continued  the  following  day  to 
help  integrate  experiences.  If  a  true  peak  experience  oc-
curred,  it  was  expected  that  patients  would  experience  an 

“afterglow  effect”  in  which  improved  mood,  energy,  inter-
personal engagement, and freedom from ruminative thoughts 
and  feelings  would  occur,  slowly  fading  over  time  but  with 
continued influence on feelings and behaviors [424]. 

  A  systematic  review  [423]  of  RCTs  between  1950  and 
2019  involving  LSD-assisted  therapy  for  individuals  with 
mental  illnesses  identified  treatment  programs  ranging  sig-
nificantly  in  terms  of  depth  of  preparation,  length  of  pro-
gram,  and  level  of  structure.  Preparation  for  these  studies 
could  be  a  brief  orientation  or  a  weeks-long  program,  and 
study  durations  ranged  from  24  hours  to  90  days.  This  re-
view  also  found  significant  variation  in  the  physical  envi-
ronment, with some studies describing intentionally comfort-
able  or  well-decorated  rooms.  Some  early  studies  in  the 
1950s  and  ‘60s  were  structured  such  that  participants  were 
unattended or restrained to the bed by a belt. While some of 
these earlier studies provided minimal preparation or educa-
tion prior to dosing, more modern studies emphasize the set, 
providing greater amounts of information, time, and attention 
to  participants  before  dosing.  The  longer  preparation  times 
appear  to  trend  toward  better  outcomes  for  participants, 
though  not  statistically  significantly  so,  although  this  is  un-
derstudied  [423].  However,  multiple  researchers  have  inter-
preted these trends as potential indications that preparation is 
a key factor in therapeutic outcomes [423]. 

3.3.2.3. Ayahuasca 

  The social, physical, and cultural context of treatment, in 
addition to individuals’ intentions, expectations, and prepara-
tion,  greatly  shape  the  ayahuasca  experience.  Ayahuasca 
ceremonies, or “retreats,” have become increasingly popular 
and  are  most  commonly  located  in  the  Amazon,  Peru,  and 
South  America,  where  the  settings  vary  among  traditions, 
cultures,  and  denominations  [425].  However,  these  ceremo-
nies typically involve groups of ~10-20 participants led by a 
group  of  trained  facilitators  and  a  spiritual  leader.  Ceremo-
nies  typically  take  place  at  night,  with  each  participant  pro-
vided their own seating and plastic bucket for purging. Tra-
ditional singing, chanting, dancing, smoke blowing, and mu-
sic  known  as  icaros  are  conducted  throughout  to  communi-
cate  with  human  and  plant  spirits  [425].  While  experiences 
are often reported to be cathartic, transcendent, and spiritual, 
they  are  also  physically  and  emotionally  draining  processes 
that  demand  vulnerability  [426].  Essential  to  the  treatment 
process  is  the  group  facilitation  sessions  following  dosing, 
where  participants  reflect  on,  interpret,  and  integrate  their 
powerful experiences.  

Improvements in subjective psychological measures have 
been  attributed  to  the  naturalistic  setting  of  ayahuasca  use 
[427].  The  prosocial  and  supportive  environment  generated 
in ayahuasca ceremonies and integrative sessions may influ-
ence participants to be uniquely open and receptive to group 
dynamics  [427,  428].  Moreover,  it  has  been  proposed  that 
ayahuasca, among other classic psychedelics, creates a “lim-
inal state,” in which these substances promote disruption and 
disorientation  of  the  pre-ritual  self,  creating  a  state  vulnera-
ble  to  transition  [426].  A  therapeutic  set  and  setting  then 
promote  psychological,  behavioral,  and  cognitive  growth, 
whereas inadequate or poor assistance may result in harm or 
regression [426].

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

  Given  the  strong  therapeutic  ties  of  ayahuasca  to  its  use 
in cultural and ritualistic settings, research has sought to fur-
ther elucidate the contextual and personal factors influencing 
mental  health  outcomes.  One  group  of  ceremony  leaders 
identified  seven  integral  personal  features  that  are  essential 
to  successful  treatment  [429]:  (1)  honesty  and  respect,  (2) 
recognition  and  volition,  (3)  readiness  and  willingness,  (4) 
internal  and  external  resources,  (5)  cleansing,  (6)  intention 
setting,  and  (7)  nonattachment,  openness,  and  surrender. 
More  broadly,  participants  should  be  honest  about  their 
preparation for ceremonies and retain respect for the specific 
approach and behaviors asked of them in the process. Partic-
ipants  authentically  desiring  healing,  as  opposed  to  trying  a 
novel experience or being pressured to come, are best suited 
to actually experiencing the benefits of the process. Coming 
prepared with goals and hopes for the ceremony is necessary 
for  grounding  participants  and  providing  direction  during 
ceremonies;  however,  participants  should  also  be  open  and 
receptive to surrendering to the experience, as messages and 
lessons  come  in  unexpected  forms.  Similarly,  participants 
should  feel  prepared  and  ready  to  engage,  as  they  must  not 
only be willing to experience difficulty and surrender to the 
full  range  of  the  experience  but  also  have  the  “internal  and 
external resources” of physical, psychological, and emotion-
al strength to participate. Leaders also expressed that restrict-
ing  diet,  medication,  and  sexual  activity  is  needed  to  be 
cleansed  to  feel  the  full  potential  of  ayahuasca.  Following 
sessions, leaders emphasized the importance of time, sharing 
experiences  with  others,  and  applying  learned  insights  and 
lessons.  They  reported  that  individuals  requiring  repeated 
ceremonies and returning to retreats were those not applying 
and actively taking the time to integrate, reflect, and incorpo-
rate the lessons from their ayahuasca ceremonies. 

  While the structure of these ayahuasca ceremonies differs 
greatly  from  the  clinical  or  research  setting  in  which  other 
psychedelics have been studied, there appears to be a similar 
emphasis  on  the  importance  of  preparation,  as  well  as  sup-
port during the psychedelic experience and in aid of integra-
tion  afterward.  These  concepts  should  be  considered  a  core 
part of the therapeutic experience of each of the classic psy-
chedelics.  As  the  following  sections  of  this  review  consider 
the  subjective  and  objective  effects  of  these  substances, 
along with the chemical, biological, and neurological mech-
anisms, it is important to remember the influence of the ther-
apeutic container in supporting these mechanisms to achieve 
positive psychological outcomes.   

3.3.3. Psychological Effects 

3.3.3.1. Subjective Effects 

  The subjective effects of classic psychedelics are relevant 
to  psychedelic-assisted  psychotherapy  (PAP)  in  that  they 
provide  highly  salient  material  as  well  as  novel  perceptions 
of self, others, the environment, and their interactions [265]. 
When administered in the context of an ongoing psychother-
apeutic process, the content of the experience - and how the 
participant relates to the content - becomes personally signif-
icant [430]. Whether or not particular shared components of 
the  experience  are  associated  with  clinical  outcomes  is  a 
question  still  being  actively  investigated  and  will  be  dis-
cussed below. The specifics of an individual subjective expe-

rience (i.e., what the participant will actually see, hear, feel, 
smell, etc.) vary widely even within the same person and are 
almost entirely unpredictable. At the same time, each classic 
psychedelic  compound  generally  has  some  common  higher-
order features. As will be described, on a group level, there 
are documented differences between each of the compounds; 
however, whether those differences are inherent to the chem-
ical and pharmacologic properties of the compound or rather 
to the typical cultural associations tied to the compound and 
the  setting  in  which  ingestion  takes  place  has  not  yet  been 
disentangled.  Therefore,  any  commentary  on  which  specific 
classic  psychedelic-induced  subjective  experience  is  best 
suited for the treatment of PTSD remains speculative. 

  The ingestion of these compounds has been described as 
an aesthetic experience involving changes in and intensifica-
tion of all sensory modalities. The phenomenon of synesthe-
sia,  which  involves  the  stimulation  of  one  sensory  pathway 
causing  perceived  activation  of  a  different  sense,  can  result 
in perceptions of “apparent pulsations or lifelike movements 
in objects such as flowers or stones, the appearance of great 
beauty  in  ordinary  things,  release  of  powerful  emotions 
through  music,  and  eyes  closed  visions  of  beautiful  scenes, 
intricate  geometric  patterns,  architectural  forms,  historical 
events,  and  almost  anything  imaginable"  [424].  Visual  phe-
nomena dominate the experience induced by these substanc-
es,  although  all  sensory  modalities  have  been  implicated  in 
the  effects  of  classic  psychedelics  [431].  Common  visual 
phenomena  tend  to  be  “elementary”  in  quality  and  include 
increased color saturation, intensification of textures, visual-
ization of geometric shapes, rhythmic movements of objects, 
micropsia and macropsia, and afterimages of objects in mo-
tion  [432].  When  ingested  as  a  brew,  ayahuasca  has  been 
reported  to  produce  visual  imagery  akin  to  highly  vivid 
dreams,  with  elements  from  personal  memory  such  as  peo-
ple,  places,  and  past  experiences  accompanied  by  complex 
scenes, also described as “seeing with eyes shut” [433, 434]. 
Complex  visions  such  as  objects,  animals,  or  people  have 
been  observed  after  psilocybin  and  LSD  intake;  however, 
unlike hallucinations, typically, the person remains aware on 
some level that the changes are drug-induced [35, 432, 435-
437].  Complex  hallucinations  involving  autobiographical 
content  or  personal  life  situations  have  also  been  reported 
[436,  438].  Likewise,  psilocybin  has  been  found  to  trigger 
recall  of  emotionally  salient  autobiographical  memories 
[280]. Individuals given intravenous DMT report a complete 
replacement  of  their  waking  reality  with  an  “alternate  uni-
verse”  filled  with  intricate  and  bizarre  visual  objects  and 
sentient, interactive “beings” that quickly fade when the drug 
is stopped [439, 440].  

  Auditory  perception  is  affected  to  a  lesser  extent  and 
seems  to  consist  of  intensification  and  misperception  of 
sound [35, 436]. The subjective response to music seems to 
be  intensified  under  psychedelics,  and  music  is  often  em-
ployed both in ceremonial psychedelic use as well as in psy-
chedelic-assisted  psychotherapy  (PAP)  to  help  guide  the 
process  [441].  The  importance  of  music  to  the  therapeutic 
quality  of  psilocybin-assisted  psychotherapy  has  been  re-
ported  by  participants  with  treatment-resistant  depression 
(TRD),  in  which  they  describe  music  as  substantially  influ-
encing  their  therapeutic  experience  [295].  These  qualitative 
reports were reinforced by selective correlations between the 

The Psychedelic Future of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    669 

musical  experience,  the  occurrence  of  mystical  experiences, 
and  insightfulness  during  sessions.  Moreover,  reductions  in 
depression ratings 1 week post-psilocybin were significantly 
predicted by the music experience variables [295].  

Some people also experience changes in tactile [442] and 
olfactory perception [443] induced by LSD, as well as gusta-
tory  perception  induced  by  psilocybin  and  LSD  [443-445]. 
Experiences  of  synesthesia  are  reported  under  the  influence 
of psilocybin and LSD, with audio-visual synesthesias being 
one of the most prominent experiences induced by LSD [35, 
436].  

  Another  commonly  described  subjective  phenomenon 
seen  with  classic  psychedelics  is  a  loss  of  subjective  self-
identity or separate self. This concept is also known to sever-
al  spiritual  traditions  and  schools  of  psychology.  The  many 
terms used to describe this phenomenon include “ego death” 
and  “ego  dissolution”.  As  supported  by  three  placebo-
controlled trials and a meta-analysis [32, 33, 446, 447], ego 
dissolution arises and intensifies in a dose-dependent manner 
and  is  associated  with  increased  emotional  and  sensory 
arousal, recall of emotionally salient autobiographical mem-
ories,  and  capacity  for  introspection  [280].  Since  the  first 
scientific  reports  in  the  1950s,  this  phenomenon  has  been 
described and often associated with the absence of adequate 
psychological  support  [448].  Trained  peer  support  has  been 
an  avenue  in  the  community  for  helping  to  mitigate  harms 
associated with distressing psychedelic experiences [449]. In 
a  supportive  and  controlled  setting,  clinical  doses  (Table  1) 
of  serotonergic  psychedelics  can  induce  a  pleasurable  sense 
of self-dissolution associated with feelings of bliss, oneness, 
and  insightfulness  [280].  However,  ego  death  can  also  be  a 
terrifying experience that requires skilled navigation with the 
patient  and  therapists.  The  guidelines  requiring  psychologi-
cal support for modern clinical trials have largely been pro-
tective  in  minimizing  prolonged  or  counter-therapeutic  suf-
fering  related  to  anxious  ego-dissolution  (AED)  during  the 
experience: In the largest Phase II trial of psilocybin, rescue 
medication  (lorazepam)  for  acute  anxiety  during  the  experi-
ence  was  only  given  once  to  one  of  79  participants  with 
treatment-resistant depression (TRD) who received 25 mg of 
psilocybin,  with  none  given  in  the  10  mg  or  1  mg  groups. 
Furthermore, in the context of an ongoing psychotherapeutic 
process,  challenging  or  unpleasant  parts  of  the  experience 
may  sometimes  be  a  central  part  of  the  therapeutic  mecha-
nism in the long term [450]. However, it has also been noted 
that experiences marked by extreme fear or panic have been 
associated with negative mental health outcomes [451].   

  Classic  psychedelics  can  also  occasion  mystical-type 
experiences,  characterized  by  a  noetic  quality,  sacredness, 
transcendence  of  time  and  space,  ineffability,  deeply  felt 
positive  mood,  unity,  and  the  sense  that  all  things  are  alive 
[421].  These  so-called  “mystical”  experiences  of  ego-
dissolution resemble experiences reported during deep medi-
tation  and  religious  exaltation  [280].  In  healthy  volunteers, 
psilocybin-induced mystical experiences are associated with 
sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance [452], 
as  well  as  openness  [37].  In  a  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled trial, healthy volunteers who took ayahuasca were 
similarly  found  to  have  mystical,  transcendent  experiences 
[453].  In  contrast,  a  study  of  LSD  in  healthy  participants 

found  that  mystical  experiences  were  infrequent,  especially 
compared  with  what  had  been  reported  with  psilocybin,  but 
suggested  that  the  set  and  setting  (here  a  laboratory  rather 
than a therapeutic setting) may play a role [454]. In a follow-
up double-blind, randomized crossover study in a laboratory 
setting comparing the effects of LSD and psilocybin, no dif-
ferences were reported in any attribute of subjective experi-
ence except duration [455]. Indeed, in addition to drug dos-
age, non-drug effects such as personality traits (trait absorp-
tion),  intention,  context,  music,  and  nature  settings  likely 
predict  or  potentiate  the  psychedelic-occasioned  mystical 
experience [456]. In a psilocybin clinical trial for treatment-
resistant  depression  (TRD),  oceanic  boundlessness  (highly 
correlated  with  mystical  experiences)  was  found  to  have  a 
strong  positive  correlation  with  therapeutic  outcomes  [457]. 
While  clinical  trials  have  yet  to  be  published  on  treating 
trauma  with  classic  psychedelics,  a  survey  study  examined 
the  psychological  mechanisms  of  psychedelics,  reducing 
distress  for  individuals  who  have  experienced  race-based 
trauma. The intensity of the reported acute effects, and spe-
cifically  the  greater  intensity  of  mystical-type  experiences 
and insight experiences, were significantly and highly corre-
lated  with  changes  in  mental  health  symptoms,  especially  a 
greater  reduction  in  distress  related  to  the  racial  trauma 
[458]. 

3.3.3.2. Cognitive Effects 

Since  the  first  LSD  studies  in  the  1950s,  efforts  have 
been  made  to  characterize  various  changes  in  cognition  un-
der the acute effects of classic psychedelics [266]. However, 
because  scientific  standards  for  conducting  and  reporting 
research  have  significantly  evolved,  this  section  will  only 
include modern studies. In consideration of safety and a risk-
benefit  assessment  of  psychedelic  treatments,  any  known 
lasting impairments in cognition are discussed. On the other 
hand, acute changes in several domains of cognition may aid 
in the therapeutic effects of the substances. Relevant findings 
are highlighted below. 

3.3.3.2.1. Memory Impairments 

  Classic  psychedelics  produce  transient,  self-limiting, 
dose-dependent  impairments  in  various  forms  of  memory, 
such  as  spatial  and  verbal  working  memory,  as  well  as  se-
mantic and autobiographical memory [459]. In investigating 
spatial working memory with the Spatial Span task from the 
Cambridge  Neuropsychological  Test  Automated  Battery 
(CANTAB), low doses of psilocybin have not indicated im-
pairment  [460],  whereas  medium  to  high  doses  have  illus-
trated  deficits  [461].  At  low  doses  of  LSD,  no  effects  on 
working  memory  or  spatial  working  memory  have  been 
found  using  the  N-back  and  CANTAB  tests,  respectively 
[462, 463]. Bouso et al. reported mixed results on neuropsy-
chological  performance  2  hours  following  ayahuasca  inges-
tion.  Participants  demonstrated  impaired  working  memory 
using the Sternberg Task, as well as decreased reaction time, 
but  preserved  accuracy  on  the  Stroop  Task.  Moreover,  in 
comparing experienced users to occasional users of ayahuas-
ca, acute negative effects on higher cognition were only seen 
in less experienced users, indicating that long-term use is not 
associated  with  worsened  executive  function  [464].  The  au-

 
 
670    Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4 

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

thors  propose  that  experienced  users  could  develop  mecha-
nisms  to  compensate  for  the  acute  impairing  effects  of  aya-
huasca  on  executive  function,  but  that  further  research 
should be conducted. 

3.3.3.2.2. Social Cognition and Behavior 

  Current  research  suggests  that  serotonergic  psychedelics 
modulate  social  cognition  and  behavior.  The  majority  of 
studies  have  focused  on  psilocybin  and  LSD,  which  have 
elicited  decreased  fear  recognition  and  enhanced  emotional 
empathy, particularly for positive facial cues [465-467]. Pro-
social behavior following psilocybin administration has been 
reported, with participants demonstrating reduced feelings of 
social isolation and rejection [30] in addition to decreases in 
avoidance  and  increases  in  acceptance  and  connectedness 
[468].  Alterations  in  sociality  and  emotion  have  been  sup-
ported by neuroimaging, wherein psilocybin has led to con-
nectivity  changes  during  facial  emotional  processing  tasks, 
as  well  as  reductions  in  fear  recognition  assessed  via  func-
tional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI)  and  electroen-
cephalography (EEG) [469, 470]. Similar findings, including 
decreased  recognition  of  fearful  and  sad  faces,  have  been 
replicated for LSD [466, 471]. This drug also increases pro-
social  and  empathic  scores  related  to  openness,  trust,  close-
ness,  and  desire  to  be  with  others.  Regarding  ayahuasca’s 
impact  on  empathy,  one  placebo-controlled  study  reported 
increased  emotional  empathy  to  negative  stimuli  post-
ceremony  [427],  while  another  trial  only  found  increased 
emotional empathy 1 week following the ayahuasca ceremo-
ny and reported an acute effect on cognitive empathy 1-day 
post-ceremony  [472].  In  contrast  with  LSD  and  psilocybin, 
ayahuasca  may  not  have  the  same  effect  of  reducing  fear 
recognition in facial emotional processing tasks [473]. 

3.3.3.2.3. Mindfulness 

  Mindfulness  is  the  adaptation  of  a  non-judgmental,  de-
tached view of one's own thoughts, emotions, and experienc-
es. Classic psychedelics have been associated with increased 
mindfulness and insightfulness [474-477]. Trials have found 
that psilocybin enhances mindfulness-related capacities [478, 
479]. In a placebo-controlled trial of 39 experienced medita-
tors,  psilocybin  was  shown  to  deepen  meditative  states  and 
promote  more  positively  experienced  self-dissolution,  with 
higher  rates  of  mindfulness  lasting  up  to  4  months  post-
treatment  [479].  In  contrast,  a  healthy  control  trial  of  LSD 
did not demonstrate significant changes in mindfulness over-
all;  however,  individual  changes  in  mindfulness  correlated 
with acute psychedelic and mystical experiences [480]. Mul-
tiple trials have illustrated that ayahuasca induces changes in 
mindfulness,  particularly  in  non-judgmental  inner  experi-
ence,  which  is  a  measure  of  freedom  from  the  inner  critic, 
self-acceptance,  and  unconditional  empathy  for  oneself  and 
others [474, 475, 481-485]. Sustained significant increases in 
this  domain  have  been  reported  up  to  1  month  [483]  and  2 
months  post-intervention  [474].  Following  one  dose  of  aya-
huasca, participants showed increases in “decentering”  [472, 
475, 486], which is the metacognitive capacity of an individ-
ual to assess and observe his or her thoughts and emotions in 
an  objective  way  as  temporary  cognitive  events  [487].  This 
decentering and acceptance has been proposed as the mecha-

nism  by  which  ayahuasca  has  been  seen  to  durably  reduce 
the  severity  of  grief [488]  as  well as reframing stress, emo-
tional pain, and trauma [475, 489, 490]. 

3.3.3.2.4. Creativity  

  Creativity  is  another  key  aspect  of  cognition  that  is  re-
portedly enhanced by psychedelics. Two constructs of crea-
tivity  include  divergent  and  convergent  thinking  [491].  Di-
vergent  thinking  promotes  an  open  and  imaginative  stance, 
allowing  multiple  ideas  and  solutions  to  exist  at  once,  pro-
moting  cognitive  flexibility  [492].  In  contrast,  convergent 
thinking  focuses  on  generating  a  single  well-defined  solu-
tion.  In  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial,  psilocybin 
acutely  decreased  convergent  thinking  and  some  aspects  of 
divergent  thinking  during  the  psychedelic  state.  However,  7 
days  post-dose,  participants  generated  more  novel  ideas 
[493].  These  increased  scores  in  divergent  thinking  were 
predicted  by  decreases  in  the  Default  Mode  Network 
(DMN), while increased connectivity between the DMN and 
frontoparietal  control  network  predicted  decreases  in  acute 
and  long-term  convergent  thinking.  These  findings  suggest 
that  psychedelics  may  influence  creativity  beyond  the  acute 
phase of the experience, as thought content is less rigid and 
inflexible,  opening  a  window  of  opportunity  for  effective 
therapeutic intervention [493].  

  A lower dose of LSD in healthy controls led to increased 
symbolic thinking and decreased convergent thinking [494]. 
In  contrast,  microdosing  LSD  in  a  small  group  (n=20)  of 
healthy  volunteers  has  not  been  shown  to  affect  convergent 
thinking [463, 495]. Ayahuasca has been reported to enhance 
creative  divergent  thinking  while  decreasing  convergent 
thinking [472, 489]. Visual creativity, in particular, was en-
hanced after ayahuasca [496]. Finally, ayahuasca users have 
demonstrated the production of an increased number of orig-
inal  solutions  to  the  task  after  the  immediate  effects  have 
dissipated [477].  

3.3.3.2.5. Suggestibility 

Psychedelic-induced suggestibility is a replicated finding 
[480]. While suggestibility may positively influence the psy-
chedelic  experience  and  therapeutic  outcomes,  there  is  also 
the  dangerous  potential  of  false  memories  or  beliefs  being 
developed  in  a  similar  process  [491].  This  finding  of  in-
creased suggestibility has been replicated in healthy controls. 
Another study found that LSD increased adaptation to opin-
ions expressed by a control group, but only if opinions were 
relatively similar to one's own [497]. 

3.3.4. Somatic Effects 

In  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  investigating  the 
therapeutic  effects  of  psilocybin  (25  mg,  20  mg/70  kg,  and 
30  mg/70  kg),  transient  increases  in  heart  rate  and  blood 
pressure  have  been  recorded  (Table  1),  although  vital  signs 
spontaneously  returned  to  baseline  during  psilocybin  treat-
ment sessions [498-500]. Increased blood pressure and heart 
rate are also common somatic reactions to LSD [466] (Table 
1),  with  some  studies  showing  blood  pressure  increasing  at 
doses  of  50  μg  or  higher  and  heart  rate  increasing  at  doses 
above  100  μg  [33].  Ayahuasca  has  been  associated  with  in-

creased blood pressure (Table 1), where significant increases 
have been found in diastolic and systolic blood pressure rela-
tive  to  placebo  [501].  Findings  for  ayahuasca’s  impact  on 
heart  rate,  however,  have  been  mixed.  Tachycardia  was  re-
ported in 1 out of 24 volunteers in a double-blind pilot study 
and occurred more frequently (200 out of 641 participants) in 
those  with  psychiatric  conditions  and  medications  [502]. 
Other trials reported significant increases in heart rate, reach-
ing  a  maximum  of  105  bpm  in  one  participant  [503],  and 
another finding a maximum increase of 5 bpm at 60 minutes 
post-administration [504]. 

  Classic  psychedelics  have  been  shown  to  elicit  neuroen-
docrine  and  immunological  alterations.  Psilocybin  acutely 
increases  circulating  adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH), 
cortisol,  prolactin,  and  thyroid-stimulating  hormone  (TSH), 
although this increase in circulating hormones was not corre-
lated  with  anxiety  or  other  stress-induced  symptoms  [447]. 
Similarly, LSD increases circulating cortisol, cortisone, cor-
ticosterone,  prolactin,  oxytocin,  and  epinephrine  [35,  505]. 
Moreover, LSD downregulates IL2, IL4, and IL6 and upreg-
ulates  mitogen-activated  protein  kinase  phosphatase-1  in 
vitro,  perhaps  highlighting  its  anti-inflammatory  activity 
[506].  Ayahuasca  has  also  been  shown  to  elicit  similar 
changes.  Particularly,  it  has  been  shown  to  induce  acute  in-
creases in cortisol [503, 507], as well as growth hormone and 
prolactin  [503].  Healthy  participants,  as  well  as  those  with 
major  depression,  demonstrated  an  increase  of  nearly  100% 
in  salivary  cortisol  levels  1  hour  and  40  minutes  following 
dosing  [507].  For  ayahuasca,  decreases  have  been  recorded 
in  lymphocytes  at  1.5  and  4  hours  post-administration,  as 
well  as  decreased  CD4  and  increased  natural  killer  (NK) 
cells at 1.5 and 2 hours as compared with placebo [503]. In a 
placebo-controlled trial of ayahuasca for patients with treat-
ment-resistant  depression  (TRD),  significant  decreases  in  c-
reactive  protein  (CRP)  in  both  control  and  TRD  patients 
were  found  48  hours  after  ayahuasca  dosing  [508].  Patients 
also illustrated a significant correlation between CRP reduc-
tions  and  Montgomery-Asberg  Depression  Rating  Scale 
(MADRS) improvement. However, no significant effects were 
found  for  IL6  or  BDNF  [508].  This  work  indicates  that  aya-
huasca  may  have  a  modulatory  effect  on  immunity  and  war-
rants  further  investigation  into  how  the  anti-inflammatory 
properties of psychedelics play a role in alleviating psychiat-
ric  disorders  with  aberrant  inflammatory  profiles,  such  as 
PTSD and TRD [503, 509]. 

3.3.5. Pharmacology 

3.3.5.1. Drug Properties 

Psilocybin  (O-phosphoryl-4-hydroxy-N,N  dimethyltryp-
tamine)  (Table  1;  Fig.  2)  and  psilocin  (4-hydroxy-N,N-
dimethyltryptamine)  are  tryptophan  indole-based  alkaloids 
found  in  mushrooms  belonging  to  the  genera  Psilocybe, 
Panaeolus,  Conocybe,  Gymnopilus,  Stropharia,  Pluteus,  and 
Panaeolina. LSD can be classified as a semisynthetic ergoline 
within the broader category of serotonergic hallucinogens. The 
basic LSD molecule is composed of an indole system and tet-
racyclic  ring  (Fig.  2),  with  four  known  isomers  that  can  be 
derived, only one of which (d-LSD) demonstrates the psycho-
active  properties  of  interest  [510].  N,N-dimethyltryptamine 

(DMT)  (Table  1;  Fig.  2),  the  psychoactive  component  of 
ayahuasca, is a structural analog of tryptamine. 

3.3.5.2. Pharmacokinetics 

3.3.5.2.1. Psilocybin 

Psilocybin  (Table  1;  Fig.  2)  and  psilocin  are  chemically 
classified  as  tryptamine  psychedelics.  They  have  a  low  tox-
icity index, with an LD50 of 280 mg/kg in rats and 285 mg/kg 
in mice. Translated to humans, a 60-kg person would need to 
ingest  17  g  (around  500-600x  the  dose  typical  of  clinical 
trials)  of  isolated  psilocybin;  however,  no  lethal  dose  has 
officially  been  found  in  humans.  Psilocybin  administered 
orally or parenterally is rapidly dephosphorylated to psilocin 
by  gastrointestinal  and  hepatic  alkaline  phosphatases  and 
esterases.  Psilocybin  is  a  prodrug  of  the  pharmacologically 
active  metabolite  psilocin,  which  readily  crosses  the  blood-
brain  barrier  and  is  responsible  for  producing  psychoactive 
effects  [478].  Psilocin  follows  linear  pharmacokinetics  and 
has an elimination half-life in plasma of ~50 minutes, where-
as  psilocybin  has  an  elimination  half-life  of  ~160  minutes 
(Table  1).  In  humans,  psilocin  is  detectable  in  significant 
amounts in the plasma within 20-40 minutes after oral inges-
tion,  with  concentrations  peaking  after  80-100 minutes.  The 
acute  effects  dissipate  significantly  within  ~4-6 hours.  Most 
psilocin  is  renally  eliminated  as  psilocin-O-glucuronide  in 
humans [511].  

3.3.5.2.2. LSD 

  Upon ingestion, LSD (Table 1; Fig. 2) is absorbed in the 
digestive tract and metabolized into multiple similar inactive 
metabolites [510], the primary of which is 2-oxo-3-hydroxy 
LSD (O-H-LSD)  [33]. Plasma half-life has ranged in studies 
between 2.6 hours [466] to 3.6 hours [510]. Plasma concen-
trations increase with higher doses in a proportional manner 
[33], and peak plasma concentrations have been demonstrat-
ed at 1.4 hours post-administration for a 100 μg dose and 1.5 
hours for a 200 μg dose [466] (Table 1); maximum excretion 
of  LSD  is  reached  between  4-6  hours  after  ingestion  [510]. 
On  average,  LSD  can  be  detected  in  blood  for  6-12  hours 
and in urine for 2-4 days post-ingestion [510]. The slow dis-
sociation rate and long half-life are hypothesized to relate to 
conformational receptor changes when LSD binds to 5-HT2A 
and  5-HT2B  receptors,  which  leads  to  “trapping”  and  poten-
tially a longer-lasting psychoactive effect [512]. Tolerance to 
LSD has been demonstrated after 2-3 days of daily moderate 
doses, though that tolerance abates after 4 days of non-LSD 
use [510]. This rapid buildup of tolerance may relate to a low 
likelihood of addiction or abuse of this drug, as abstinence is 
needed  in  order  to  re-experience  subjective  effects  at  the 
same  intensity  as  prior  to  exposure  [513].  There  are  no 
known  human  cases  of  a  lethal  overdose,  but  the  LD50  is 
estimated to be 200-1000 μg/kg (~60-300x a high therapeutic 
dose) [514].  

3.3.5.2.3. Ayahuasca 

  Endogenous  DMT  (Table 1;  Fig.  2)  is  mainly  produced, 
stored,  and  metabolized  in  the  brain;  however,  research  has 
not been conducted to determine its rate of synthesis, release, 
or  clearance  in  humans,  given  the  challenge  of  peripheral 
measurement and the likelihood that it may only be found in 

 
 
672    Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4 

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

specific  brain  areas  or  cell  types  [515].  DMT  is  pharmaco-
logically  active  when  given  intravenously  or  smoked,  and 
only  orally  active  when  coadministered  with  monoamine 
oxidase  inhibitors  (MAOIs).  As  previously  mentioned,  aya-
huasca  is  composed  of  the  plants  B.  Caapi  and  P.  Viridis, 
which contain β-carboline alkaloids and DMT, respectively. 
The β-carbolines harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine 
(THH) are selective reversible inhibitors of the isoenzyme A 
type  of  MAO  [409,  516].  In  preventing  the  gastrointestinal 
and  hepatic  degradation  of  DMT  via  this  MAO  inhibition, 
the β -carbolines  thereby  allow  DMT  to  enact  its  psychoac-
tive  effects  and  prolong  the  effects  by  several  hours  [517]. 
No LD50 has been established in humans, but as extrapolat-
ed  from  animal  studies,  the  estimated,  highly  conservative 
LD50  of  DMT  is  8  mg/kg  [518],  which  is  at  least  10  times 
greater  than  a  ceremonial  dose.  DMT  does  not  seem  to  in-
duce tolerance [519]. 

  When  administered  orally,  DMT  is  primarily  oxidized 
and inactivated by MAO-A. When administered parenterally 
or  when  MAO-A  is  inhibited,  DMT  is  metabolized  by  liver 
enzymes,  including  cytochrome  P-450  (CYP450),  to  DMT-
N-oxide [515, 517, 520]. Less than 1% of administered DMT 
is  excreted  in  urine  unchanged  [520].  DMT’s  subjective  ef-
fects  are  correlated  with  peak  plasma  concentrations,  which 
vary  in  time and level based on the route of administration. 
In  oral  administration  of  ayahuasca,  the  peak  is  reported  to 
occur around 1.5-2 hours after ingestion [501]. Research on 
ayahuasca’s  absorption,  distribution  metabolism,  and  excre-
tion  is  preliminary  and  limited  [521].  Accordingly,  further 
investigation of ayahuasca’s pharmacology and the synergis-
tic metabolic effects of its constituents is needed. 

3.3.5.3. Pharmacodynamics 

  The classic psychedelics (Table 1; Fig. 2) are also some-
times  referred  to  as  “serotonergic  psychedelics”  [29]  due  to 
their structural similarity to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 
5-HT) and their associated actions on the 5-HT serotonergic 
system [522] (Fig. 5), though this classification may be lim-
ited  in  regards  to  the  broader  scope  of  receptors  on  which 
they act. Classic psychedelics are known as a group of ago-
nists of 5-HT2A receptors (Table 1), which are considered the 
receptors most directly related to psychedelic and hallucino-
genic effects [29, 510]. Psilocin (the main metabolite of psil-
ocybin), LSD, and DMT demonstrate 16% [523], 60% [524], 
and  40%  [523]  activation  efficacy,  respectively,  at  5-HT2A 
receptors.  The  psychedelic  effects  of  psilocybin  in  humans 
correlate  with  5-HT2A  receptor  occupancy  in  the  prefrontal 
cortex (PFC) and other cortical regions as measured by posi-
tron  emission  tomography  (PET)  scan  [525].  Preclinical 
studies have shown that the head-twitch response in rodents - 
a key behavioral proxy for the subjective hallucinogenic re-
sponse  in  humans  -  is  likely  specific  to  5-HT2A  receptor 
stimulation  [525].  Notably,  when  LSD  is  administered  with 
5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin, subjective effects are 
significantly reduced (i.e., the effects of 100 μg are reported 
equivalent to that of a 25 μg dose) [33]. However, the utility 
of ketanserin in this way for implicating 5-HT2AR is limited 
by its affinity at several other receptors, including 5-HT2C as 
well as α1A-, α1B-, α2B, α1D-adrenergic, and histamine H1 
receptors [341]. Similarly, the 5-HT2A receptor is central to, 
but  not  exclusively  responsible  for,  DMT’s  psychedelic  ef-

fects; the drug’s potency has been correlated with its affinity 
and  agonist  activity  at  the  receptor  sites  [526,  527].  5-HT1A 
receptors,  5-HT2C  receptors,  sigma-1  opioid  receptors,  and 
NMDA  receptors  are  all  targets  of  DMT  and  contribute  to 
psychotropic  and  physical  effects  [528].  Though  it  binds  to 
this  receptor  with  relatively  high  affinity  (IC50  75  ±  1  nM), 
other psychedelics bind with greater affinity without produc-
ing  the  same  visual  effects  of  DMT  [529],  suggesting  that 
mechanisms  beyond  5-HT2A  are  important  in  understanding 
the psychedelic experience imparted by each substance. 

  Additional serotonergic receptors have been identified as 
being activated by the classic psychedelics (Table 1; Fig. 5), 
though potentially with less direct impact on the psychedelic 
experience  than  5-HT2A.  Psilocin  binds  to  the  5-HT2C,  
5-HT1A,  and  5-HT1B  receptors  [532],  as  well  as  5-HT2B,  
5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, 5-HT7, and 5-HT6 [512, 533]. LSD has been 
demonstrated  to  interact  with  5-HT1A,  5-HT1B,  5-HT1D,  and 
5-HT1E;  additional  evidence  of  some  effects  of  LSD  on  
5-HT2B,  5-HT2C,  5-HT5A,  5-HT6,  and  5-HT7  receptors  has 
been noted, but without clarity on the significance [510, 512, 
533].  Though  the  acute  effects  of  LSD  decrease  activity  in 
serotonergic and dorsal raphe nucleus neurons via activation 
of the 5-HT1A receptors, repeated doses have increased activ-
ity in the dorsal raphe nucleus in a manner similar to that of 
classic  antidepressants.  The  activity  of  LSD  on  5-HT2C  re-
ceptors may be related to its non-addictive nature, a hypothe-
sis  thought  to  be  true  for  the  other  classic  psychedelics,  as 
well [512]. More specifically, 5-HT2C receptors are associat-
ed  with  decreased  self-administration  of  addictive  substanc-
es,  suppression  of  dopamine  (DA)  transmission  and  inhibi-
tion  of  mesolimbic  dopamine  neurons,  and  suppression  of 
Kv1.x  channels  [513].  Serotonin  can  also  modulate  behav-
ioral  effects  and  interact  with  dopaminergic  pathways  in  a 
way that decreases addictive factors, and an increase in cen-
tral  serotonin  release  may  moderate  relevant  dopaminergic 
systems [513]. DMT exhibits agonist activity at 5-HT1A and 
partial agonist activity at 5-HT2C receptors, which are rich in 
the  choroid  plexus  [512,  534].  DMT  has  also  exhibited  an 
affinity  for  the  serotonergic  receptors  5-HT1B,  5-HT1D,  
5-HT2B,  5-HT5A,  5-HT6,  and  5-HT7  [534].  However,  with 
minor  or  unknown  contributions  to  the  neurophysiological 
effects  of  ayahuasca    [535],  some  additional  evidence  is 
available for DMT’s affinity to 5-HT2C and 5-HT1E receptors 
[533]. Callaway et al. proposed that there is overall upregu-
lation of 5-HT2A receptors, as it was found that repeated aya-
huasca users exhibited an increase in platelet 5-HT2A mRNA 
transporter  sites  [536].  DMT’s  action  on  other  serotonergic 
receptors,  such  as  5-HT1A  and  5-HT2C,  is  modulatory.  The  
5-HT1A receptor is predominantly pre-synaptic with inhibito-
ry  effects,  acting  to  decrease  serotonergic  tone,  particularly 
in  the  raphe  nucleus,  where  it  is  found  in  high  concentra-
tions. 5-HT2C receptors have been shown to exhibit profound 
desensitization with repeated doses, while the hallucinogenic 
activity  of  DMT  does  not  exhibit  tolerance  [534,  537]. 
DMT’s effects on serotonergic receptors may also be modu-
lated by THH. As previously described, while THH primari-
ly plays a role in MAO inhibition, it has also been shown to 
act as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor [538]. Moreover, Glen-
non  and  colleagues  found  that β -carbolines  can  bind  to  5-
HT2A with modest affinity; however, they do not exhibit ag-
onist activity [539].

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    673 

Fig.  (5).  Molecular  mechanisms  of  classic  psychedelics.  Serotonergic  psychedelics  activate  5-hydroxytryptamine  2A  (5-HT2A)  receptors, 
causing  glutamate  release  and  alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic  acid  (AMPA)  potentiation.  The  resulting  release  of 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activates tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptors, ultimately resulting in activation of the 
mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway and increasing expression of synaptic proteins [530]. Classic psy-
chedelics also bind to the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)  5-HT2A receptors on the post-synaptic cell, activating downstream cascades. 
One of these cascades is the Gq-mediated response pathway, leading to production of phospholipase C (PLCβ) that catalyzes the production 
of second messengers inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), in turn activating protein kinase C (PKC) and then extra-
cellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) to mobilize intracellular calcium and, eventually, changes in gene expression. This and other 
intracellular pathways are part of the pro-neuroplastic effects of classic psychedelics [531]. (A higher resolution/colour version of this figure 
is available in the electronic copy of the article). 

  Though  LSD  is  often  grouped  with  psilocybin  and  aya-
huasca,  it  is  an  ergoline  compound  (Table  1)  rather  than  a 
tryptamine;  as  an  ergoline,  LSD  acts  on  dopaminergic  and 
adrenergic receptors at a level greater than DMT or psilocin, 
in  addition  to  the  serotonergic  receptors  discussed  [280].  In 
particular,  the  D3,  D2,  D4,  D1,  D5,  and  Alpha2A  receptors 
have  been  indicated  [533].  Modulatory  downstream  effects 
have  been  proposed  as  responses  to  LSD’s  effect  on  use  in 
the  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA)ergic,  dopaminergic, 
and glutamatergic systems [280]. Animal studies have shown 
that  high  doses  of  LSD  activate  trace  amine-associated  re-
ceptors  1  (TAAR1),  which  then  modulate  dopamine  (DA) 
activity  in  the  ventral  tegmental  area  (VTA)  [280].  In  ro-
dents, at high doses, the activated 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A recep-

tors in the mPFC lead to decreases in the firing rate of 5-HT 
neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus as well as decreased do-
paminergic activity in the VTA. Contrastingly, low doses do 
not  appear  to  affect  the  dopamine  activity  in  VTA  neurons, 
although  there  is  decreased  activity  in  the  5-HT  neurons 
[28].  It  has  been  proposed,  following  animal  studies,  that 
LSD may act in two phases, with the second phase incorpo-
rating the dopamine D2 receptor [540]. 

Psilocin  and  DMT  also  show  some  indication  of  action 
on  dopamine  receptor  D1  [533],  and  psilocin  also  activates 
D3 [541] (Table 1). Beyond the dopaminergic system, DMT 
is  found  to  act  on  receptors  α2B,  α2C,  α1B,  α2A,  α1A, 
SERT,  and  Sigma-1  [533].  It  also  acts  on  the  imidazoline 
receptor,  which  plays  a  potential  therapeutic  role  in  hyper-

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

tension,  metabolic  syndromes,  and  chronic  pain  through  the 
modulation of its three receptor subtypes [542]. It has addi-
tionally  been  shown  that  metabotropic  glutamate  receptor  2 
(mGluR2) is an essential modulator in the neuropsychologic 
response to DMT and other classic psychedelics. Formation 
of a 5-HT2AR-mGluR2 complex produces the psychotropic 
and  behavioral  effects  of  hallucinogenics,  whereas  these  ef-
fects are absent in mGluR2 knockout mice [516, 543].  

Sigma  1R  agonism  has  been  proposed  to  mediate  the 
psychedelic effects of DMT [544] and is posited to be a key 
factor related to the differences in subjective effects between 
ayahuasca and other classic psychedelics [544, 545]. Moreo-
ver,  Sigma  1R  is  involved  in  mitigating  inflammatory  pro-
cesses  such  as  increased  nitric  oxide  signaling,  calcium 
dyshomeostasis,  apoptosis,  mitochondrial  dysfunction,  oxi-
dative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Sigma 
1R’s  protection  against  cellular  stress  responses  indicates 
that  DMT  may  play  a  neuroprotective  role.  Particularly, 
DMT’s agonist activity at Sigma 1R is believed to impact an 
adaptive  process  that  restores  ER  homeostasis,  called  un-
folded protein response (UPR) [516]. Deficits in the regula-
tion  of  these  proteins  have  been  associated  with  neuropsy-
chiatric  and  degenerative  conditions  [546].  DMT-Sigma  1R 
activation also exhibits antioxidant action by protecting cells 
against  reactive  oxygen  species  and  activating  the  antioxi-
dant response elements [547]. 

3.3.5.4. Safety Profile & Adverse Effects 

  Classic  psychedelics  have  been  generally  reported  as 
safe, with a recent systematic review of trials for psilocybin, 
ayahuasca,  and  LSD  reporting  no  serious  or  long-term  ad-
verse events among all 16 studies [548]. A systematic review 
of clinical trials that assessed the safety of psilocybin, LSD, 
and ayahuasca found that serious adverse reactions are more 
likely to occur in a recreational context [43]. In experimental 
and clinical settings, such reactions are mitigated within the 
therapeutic process, usually without the need for psychiatric 
medication.  Induction  of  prolonged  psychotic  symptoms  by 
psychedelics  is  a  hypothetical  outcome  that  has  long  been 
feared and is of primary concern to scientists designing clini-
cal research on these substances, yet this has not been docu-
mented in any modern psilocybin, LSD, or ayahuasca clini-
cal  trial  [43].  This  may  be  attributed  to  exclusion  criteria, 
which  routinely  exclude  participants  with  a  personal  and/or 
family  history  of  psychosis  [43,  417,  549].  Conversely,  re-
peated  lifetime  exposure  to  psychedelic  compounds  is  asso-
ciated with lower levels of suicidal ideation and behavior, as 
well as lower levels of psychological distress and incidence 
of  psychiatric  diagnoses  [512].  Modern  safety  protocols  for 
psychedelic  research  have  significantly  reduced  the  likeli-
hood  of  such  occurrences.  Overall,  modern  research  has 
demonstrated classic psychedelics to be non-toxic and physi-
ologically  safe,  even  at  very  high  doses  [43].  While  severe 
adverse reactions are rare, mild adverse events are relatively 
common, as described below. 

3.3.5.4.1. Psilocybin 

  The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  events  (AEs)  for 
psilocybin in RCTs are headache (33-44%) and nausea (21-
33%)  [498-500]  (Table  1).  An  open-label,  dose-escalating 

trial in healthy volunteers found that the most common AEs 
were  hypertension,  tachycardia,  and  headaches  (Table  1). 
These  AEs  were  mild  and  transient,  and  were  successfully 
treated with supportive therapy. Vital signs returned to base-
line  within  8  hours  without  medical  intervention.  Adverse 
events were not found to be dose-dependent [550].  

In  a  retrospective  analysis  of  110  participants,  two  were 
documented as having “unusually intense reactions” to a low 
dose  of  psilocybin  and  were  thus  excluded  from  further  ex-
perimentation  due  to  safety  concerns.  Another  participant 
experienced  a  transient  hypotensive  reaction  with  dizziness, 
fainting,  and  vomiting  after  having  received  a  low  dose  of 
psilocybin  and  was  thus  removed  from  the  study.  Two  par-
ticipants withdrew from the study and were unwilling to con-
tinue  their  participation  after  experiencing  intense  anxiety, 
fear  of  loss  of  ego/control,  and  negative  thoughts  under  the 
influence  of  high-dose  psilocybin.  These  five  AEs  were  re-
solved  by  the  end  of  the  experimental  day.  This  study  also 
evaluated  the  abuse  potential  of  psilocybin  and  found  that 
most  participants  (~90%)  reported  “no  change”  in  their  use 
of  psilocybin  following  treatment  sessions,  as  well  as  “no 
change” in their consumption of other substances [436].  

In a double-blind study investigating the acute and long-
er-term  psychological  effects  of  a  high  dose  of  psilocybin 
compared  with  methylphenidate  in  36  healthy  volunteers, 
31% experienced significant anxiety and/or dysphoria during 
psilocybin  treatment,  and  17%  experienced  paranoia.  These 
AEs are resolved by the end of the treatment session without 
medical  intervention  [421].  This  study  was  extended  by  a 
dose-effect  investigation  of  psilocybin  in  18  healthy  volun-
teers, which found that feelings of anxiety, fear, and paranoia 
increased  in  frequency  with  increasing  doses.  Overall,  39% 
of participants reported experiencing extreme anxiety/fear at 
some  point  during  the  treatment  sessions  [36].  Both  studies 
found mild, transient increases in heart rate and blood pres-
sure  (Table  1)  that  returned  to  baseline  by  the  end  of  the 
treatment session without medical intervention [36, 421]. At 
the 14-month follow-up, there were no reports of AEs, symp-
toms  of  Hallucinogen-Persisting  Perception  Disorder 
(HPPD), or increased substance use [36].  

Participants  in  one  RCT  were  followed  for  12  months 
after  psilocybin-assisted  psychotherapy  treatment  for  major 
depressive disorder (MDD), during which there were no re-
ports of serious AEs such as suicide attempts, worsening of 
suicidal 
ideation,  self-injurious  behavior,  symptoms  of 
HPPD,  or  psilocybin  use  outside  the  study  [551]  (Table  8). 
However,  in  a  Phase  II  RCT  for  treatment-resistant  depres-
sion (TRD), four instances of suicidal ideation and three re-
ports  of  non-suicidal  self-injury  (NSSI)  were  documented 
within  3  weeks  post-treatment.  In  the  period  between  3  and 
12  weeks  post-treatment,  four  additional  reports  of  suicidal 
ideation  and  two  reports  of  NSSI  were  reported.  Such  in-
stances were not reported by participants in the control group 
within  either  period.  All  three  participants  in  the  25-mg 
group  who  reported  suicidal  behavior  after  week  3  had  a 
history  of  suicidal  behavior  or  nonsuicidal,  self-injurious 
behavior  before  the  trial  and  did  not  respond  to  psilocybin 
treatment [552].  

  A  possible  explanation  that  could  account  for  these  dif-
ferences in post-treatment AEs is the fact that the study con-

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    675 

ducted by Gukasyan et al. [551]  (Table 8) was a single-site 
RCT that followed 27 participants with MDD (unspecified to 
be  treatment-resistant)  at  a  single  site  in  the  United  States, 
whereas the study conducted by Goodwin et al. [552] was an 
RCT  that  followed  233  participants  with  treatment-resistant 
depression (TRD) at 22 sites located in 10 different countries 
across Europe and North America. Thus, using a larger sam-
ple of participants with TRD may have lent itself to detecting 
these AEs more readily. Taken together, these findings sug-
gest that the psychological and physiological effects of psil-
ocybin are generally well tolerated and pose a very low risk 
of  serious  AEs  acutely  and  in  the  long  term,  but  that  care 
must be taken to ensure the continued safety of participants 
in these studies. 

3.3.5.4.2. LSD 

  Early researchers in the field of LSD-assisted treatments 
cautioned  against  the  use  of  LSD  with  significantly  de-
pressed  individuals,  believing  that  LSD  can  intensify  what-
ever state an individual is in, and thus, depression can devel-
op  into  a  more  intense  despair  [265].  More  comprehensive 
research  into  the  effects  of  LSD  has  found  that  the  most 
common unpleasant reactions to LSD ingestion are reported 
to be anxiety or panic (Table 1), which can include fears of 
death  or  loss  of  control,  despair,  or  other  frightening 
thoughts  and  feelings.  Paranoid  ideation,  temporary  depres-
sion, or mood instability may persist in the days following a 
person’s use of LSD. Somatic effects that have been reported 
for  LSD  are  nausea  (30%),  decreased  appetite  (25%),  mild 
headache (20%), dizziness (45%), lightness in limbs (35%), 
and  trembling  (45%).  Parasympathetic  responses  such  as 
sweating, salivation, bradycardia, and hypotension have been 
observed [510] (Table 1).  

In a systematic review of clinical trials, two cases of seri-
ous adverse events following the use of LSD were reported: 
a tonic-clonic seizure in a  participant with a history of sei-
zures  and  a  case  of  prolonged  psychosis  in  a  patient  with  a 
history  of  psychotic  episodes,  who  recovered  without  com-
plications [423]. Cases of prolonged psychosis [553], suicide 
[448], and death [554] have also been linked to LSD. How-
ever,  of  note,  these  studies  were  performed  in  1969  and 
1973, respectively, and more stringent exclusion criteria are 
present  in  modern  studies  [43,  417,  549].  Modern  clinical 
trials  investigating  the  long-term  safety  profile  of  LSD  are 
lacking [43]. 

3.3.5.4.3. Ayahuasca 

  Ayahuasca  (Table  1;  Fig.  2)  is  generally  well  tolerated, 
with  a  favorable  safety  profile.  The  most  common  side  ef-
fects  are  nausea  (71%)  and  vomiting  (47-57%)  (Table  1), 
though  vomiting  or  purging  is  reported  to  be  integral  to  the 
therapeutic process of ayahuasca [453, 555]. Transient anxie-
ty (50%), headaches (42%), and restlessness (50%) have also 
been  reported  [453].  Additional  autonomic  side  effects  in-
clude  dizziness,  increased  body  temperature,  and  mydriasis 
at 2 hours following dosing [503]. 

  Given  the  unique  ceremonial  setting  from  which  much 
knowledge of ayahuasca is derived, its safety and side effects 
will be discussed within this context. A systematic review of 
adverse events associated with ayahuasca use reported cases 

of  psychotic  episodes,  some  of  which  were  associated  with 
personal  or  family  history  of  bipolar  disorder,  psychosis,  or 
the  concomitant  use  of  other  drugs  [556].  Particularly,  the 
combination  of  ayahuasca  with  cannabis  has  been  shown  in 
some  cases  to  produce  extreme  anxiety,  panic,  or  psychosis 
acutely [503, 521, 557]. Given case reports of psychotic epi-
sodes and the transient alterations in mental state induced by 
ayahuasca,  those  with  a  personal  history  of  psychosis  are 
typically  excluded  [558].  Long-term  ritualistic  use  of  aya-
huasca,  however,  has  not  been  associated  with  an  increased 
incidence  of  psychotic  or  cognitive  disorders  [558],  though 
some  persistent  negative  psychological  consequences,  such 
as restlessness and disorientation, have been reported in nat-
uralistic surveys [502].  

  Ayahuasca  is  known  to  have  possible  chemical  interac-
tions  with  monoaminergic  and  serotonergic  substances  due 
to the risk of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) func-
tion  of β -carbolines.  Thus,  substances  like  tryptophan,  anti-
depressants  (including  SSRIs  and  SNRIs),  as  well  as  psy-
chostimulants  (amphetamines,  MDMA,  and  methylpheni-
date),  risk  the  potential  development  of  serotonin  syndrome 
if  combined  with  ayahuasca  and  should  be  strictly  avoided 
[556,  557,  559].  Unlike  other  MAOIs  like  first-generation 
drugs  such  as  phenelzine,  tranylcypromine,  and  isocarboxa-
zid,  ayahuasca  is  not  associated  with  hypertensive  crises. 
The  first  generation  of  these  drugs  constitutes  irreversible 
MAOIs  and  requires  strict  dietary  exclusion  of  tyramine-
containing  foods;  however,  ayahuasca  does  not  require  the 
same  restrictions,  likely  because β -carbolines  are  highly  se-
lective  inhibitors  of  MAO-A,  which  is  more  specific  for 
tryptamines  like  serotonin  over  tyramines  [557].  A  dietary 
regimen before and after an ayahuasca ceremony is typically 
recommended  for  spiritual  purposes,  and  ayahuasca  is  typi-
cally administered on an empty stomach [557]. 

  Deaths  related  to  ayahuasca  have  been  anecdotally  re-
ported, although all have been due to coingestion with other 
substances,  such  as  5-MeO-DMT,  DMT, β -carboline,  tryp-
tamine,  MAO  inhibitors,  and  high  doses  of  nicotine  [518, 
560]. No deaths have been reported in the scientific literature 
directly due to ayahuasca consumed by itself [518, 556]. 

3.3.6. Rationale & Mechanisms of Classic Psychedelics for 
PTSD Treatment 

3.3.6.1. Neuroplasticity 

  Neuroplasticity refers to structural and functional chang-
es  that  occur  in  the  brain  throughout  the  lifespan  and  in  re-
sponse to experiences and stimuli. Neuroplasticity underlies 
an  individual's  ability  to  learn  and  adapt  to  their  changing 
environment.  Components  of  adult  neuroplasticity  vital  for 
neurocognitive  functioning  include  neurogenesis,  the  devel-
opment  and  retraction  of  dendritic  spines,  and  changes  that 
occur  in  the  synaptic  communication  between  two  neurons. 
Enhancing  neuroplasticity  in  service  of  facilitating  the  reor-
ganization  of  neural  circuits  has  long  been  a  sought-after 
therapeutic  target  in  psychiatry  [561].  It  has  been  hypothe-
sized that the therapeutic effect of antidepressants, for exam-
ple,  may  occur  in  part  through  modulating  signaling  path-
ways involved in neuroplasticity [562]. In PTSD, neurogene-
sis  (one  form  of  neuroplasticity)  can  promote  fear  memory 
extinction and decrease PTSD behaviors [512]. Psychedelics 

 
676    Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4 

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

have  been  found 
to  have  substantial  neuroplasticity-
enhancing  properties  [563],  leading  to  a  novel  program  of 
drug discovery in a class of experimental compounds dubbed 
psychoplastogens. However, neuroplasticity is a neutral pro-
cess,  not  inherently  changing  in  the  direction  of  positive 
health [564]. Thus, using psychedelics to increase neuroplas-
ticity is a method by which psychotherapy can be enhanced, 
but  not  necessarily  a  method  of  inducing  positive  change 
without the support of a therapeutic set, setting, and support-
ive team.  

  When  treating  cultured  cortical  neurons  with  psychedel-
ics,  Ly  et  al.  [565]  found  that  serotonergic  psychedelics  in-
creased dendritic arbor complexity, robustly promoted neuri-
togenesis,  and  demonstrated  significantly  greater  potency 
than ketamine (with LSD demonstrating the highest potency) 
[565]. In animal models, DMT and LSD were also found to 
promote  spinogenesis,  and  psychedelics  were  demonstrated 
to promote synaptogenesis through increased density of syn-
apses,  though  not  the  size.  These  effects  were  abrogated  by 
the  use  of  5-HT2A  antagonist  ketanserin,  indicating  that  the 
5-HT2A receptors play a key role in the demonstrated neuro-
genesis. 

Following  the  activation  of  5-HT2A  receptors  by  classic 
psychedelics, a series of neurological systems and structures 
are  triggered.  5-HT2A  stimulates  the  release  of  glutamate 
from  the  presynaptic  cell,  which  then  activates  the  AMPA 
receptor  of  the  postsynaptic  cell,  which  in  turn  initiates 
BDNF release and a cascade of intracellular events. 5-HT2A 
agonism on the postsynaptic cell also causes activation of G-
coupled  protein  receptor  pathways,  eventually  resulting  in 
increased gene expression of transcription factors involved in 
neuroplasticity.  This  includes  most  notably  factors  such  as 
immediate-early  genes  c-Fos  [566]  and  early  growth  re-
sponse protein (EGR) 1 and 2 [567], as well as brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [512, 568], a primary modulator 
of neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. These factors have also 
been  shown  to  play  a  role  in  memory  [569]  and  attention 
[570].  While  treatment  of  cortical  neurons  with  LSD  and 
DMT  did  not  result  in  increased  expression  of  BDNF  tran-
script, there was a demonstrated, though not statistically sig-
nificant, increase in BDNF protein levels [565].   

  BDNF-dependent  synaptic  plasticity  and  neurogenesis, 
particularly  in  the  hippocampus,  are  necessary  for  memory 
reconsolidation  and  fear  extinction  [571,  572].  Notably,  in 
individuals with psychiatric disorders, including PTSD, gene 
expression  of  BDNF  is  typically  decreased;  in  fact,  genetic 
variability affecting transcriptional downregulation of BDNF 
may confer susceptibility to PTSD [512]. Pharmacologically 
modulating the expression of BDNF, in turn, can have thera-
peutic  value,  such  as  decreasing  the  likelihood  of  a  fear  re-
sponse  re-emerging  after  fear  extinction  occurs  [571].  AM-
PA  receptor  potentiation,  including  by  classic  psychedelics, 
has  been  shown  to  enhance  neuroplasticity  and  benefit  psy-
chiatric  treatments,  and  has  speculatively  been  thought  to 
play a role in the subjective “resetting” feeling reported after 
psychedelic  use  [512].  Significant  increases  in  BDNF  have 
not been consistently measured following doses of LSD be-
low  200  μg  [280].  Following  the  use  of  ayahuasca,  BDNF 
levels  are  higher  than  those  in  placebo  controls,  and  higher 
levels  of  BDNF  in  these  individuals  correlated  with  lower 

ratings  of  depression  post-ayahuasca  use  [573].  However, 
peripheral BDNF is known to be affected by many biological 
and methodological factors, and therefore, its relationship to 
central BDNF is complicated [574]. 

3.3.6.2. Neurobiology of Subjective Effects 

  The  subjective  effects  induced  by  classic  psychedelics 
have  been  posited  to  impact  the  psychological  outcomes  of 
psychedelic-assisted  psychotherapy.  These  include  somatic, 
self-conceptual,  and  mystical-type  experiences.  The  role  of 
ego-dissolution and mystical experiences in the treatment of 
PTSD  is  yet  to  be  determined,  as  there  is  currently  no  pub-
lished  research  that  assesses  how  these  subjective  effects 
relate to PTSD or other trauma-focused treatments. Any po-
tential benefit needs to be tempered with the risk that classic 
psychedelics carry of inducing a psychologically distressing 
response. However, the ability to detach from one’s self and 
recognize  thoughts  and  emotions  as  temporary  [487],  also 
known  as  decentering,  has  been  implicated  in  various  psy-
chiatric disorders [484]. Enhanced decentering capacity pre-
dicts  both  acute  and  enduring  improvements  in  distress  fol-
lowing 
interventions 
(MBIs)  and  mindfulness  CBT,  as  demonstrated  in  individu-
als  with  PTSD  and  other  disorders  [487,  575,  576].  En-
hanced  mindfulness,  and  specifically  decentering  capacity, 
may be facilitated by classic psychedelics within the context 
of a supportive therapeutic environment.  This may enhance 
recognition  of  interoceptive  cues  and  negative  internal 
thoughts, thereby promoting habituation and decreased reac-
tivity in PTSD.   

treatment  with  mindfulness-based 

  These effects of classic psychedelics are likely influenced 
by  various  increases  and  decreases  in  neurological  activity 
and connectivity. For example, psilocybin-induced decreases 
in  activity  measured  within  the  anterior  cingulate  cortex 
(ACC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) have been asso-
ciated  with  subjective  effects,  including  changes  in  con-
sciousness,  with  the  magnitude  of  the  decrease  correlating 
with  the  intensity  of  the  effects  [378].  Significantly  de-
creased  blood  flow  in  the  posterior  cingulate  cortex  (PCC) 
has also been observed, and it is hypothesized that this may 
relate to potential changes in consciousness, sense of self, or 
ego  functioning  [378].  Changes  in  cortical  thickness  of  the 
PCC have been found in regular users of ayahuasca, and the 
extent  of  thinning  was  inversely  correlated  with  self-
transcendence,  transpersonal  feelings,  and  spirituality;  this 
was  suggested  to  potentially  impact  self-referential  thought 
and  attention  [577].  Coupling  between  the  PCC  and  the 
mPFC  was  also  decreased  with  psilocybin  use  [378]  and 
upon  ingestion  of  LSD,  which  induces  hypo-connectivity 
observed  in  cortical  areas  related  to  associative  networks, 
including medial and lateral PFC, cingulum, insula, and tem-
poroparietal  junction.  Conversely,  LSD  has  been  demon-
strated  to  induce  hyper-connectivity  in  the  sensory  and  so-
matomotor  areas,  including  the  occipital  cortex,  superior 
temporal  gyrus,  precuneus  and  postcentral  gyrus  [578].  No-
tably,  decreased  activity  in  the  precuneus  has  been  demon-
strated in individuals with PTSD [17, 135], and reduction in 
symptoms  following  successful  PTSD  treatments,  such  as 
EMDR,  have  correlated  with  increased  activity  in  this  area 
[579].  This  structure  is  correlated  with  aspects  of  episodic 

 
The Psychedelic Future of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    677 

memory retrieval, self-referential reflection, perspective tak-
ing, and self-consciousness [136]; thus, the increased activity 
in  this  area  following  the  use  of  classic  psychedelics  may 
have  an  effect  on  personal  identity  and  self-concept,  and 
warrants further study. 

  Changes  in  connectivity  following  classic  psychedelic 
use  appear  negatively  correlated;  that  is,  those  who  showed 
greater  increases  in  connectivity  of  sensory  areas  demon-
strated greater decreases in associative network connectivity. 
This  appears  likely  to  underlie  the  psychedelic-altered  state 
of consciousness. The changes in somatomotor network con-
nectivity,  which  connectivity  has  previously  been  theorized 
to  relate  to  an  individual’s  perception  of  their  own  agency 
and  sense  of  self,  significantly  correlated  with  subjective 
effects  of  LSD,  including  “blissful  state,  disembodiment, 
changed meaning of percepts, elementary imagery, and spir-
itual  experience”  [578].  Visual  hallucinations  are  correlated 
with increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), rest-
ing  state  functional  connectivity  (RSFC),  and  decreased  al-
pha power, while ego-dissolution and changes in conscious-
ness  are  correlated  with  decreased  DMN  integrity,  PH-RSC 
RSFC, and decreased PCC alpha power [580]. The DMN has 
been  implicated  in  numerous  aspects  of  the  psychedelic  ex-
perience and thus is described in further detail below. 

3.3.6.3. Default Mode Network Changes 

Studies  have  shown  significant  changes  in  global  brain 
connectivity following the ingestion of psilocybin and LSD, 
in  particular  in  the  Default  Mode  Network  (DMN).  The 
DMN includes brain structures in the ventromedial and dor-
sal  PFC  as  well  as  the  hippocampus,  and  is  associated  with 
high-level  functions  linked  to  self-construct  [581].  Activity 
in the DMN increases with self-referential thought and other 
internally  focused  processes  and  is  overactive  in  many  psy-
chiatric disorders, including PTSD, possibly associated with 
increased  rumination  or  negative  evaluations  of  self  [512] 
and potentially with the emotions of guilt and shame that can 
characterize certain proposed phenotypes of PTSD (see Sec-
tion 2.7: Neurobiology of PTSD) [21].  

  While  under  the  acute  effects  of  psilocybin,  LSD,  or 
DMT,  structures  within  the  DMN  demonstrate  decreased 
connectivity [280, 582] and increased between-network con-
nectivity  [583].  Regions  in  the  DMN  also  host  a  density  of 
cortico-cortical  connections  and  are,  therefore,  viewed  as 
connector  hubs,  facilitating  effective  communication  be-
tween  brain  regions.  Perhaps  that  is  why  disruption  in  the 
DMN by classic psychedelics may have such significant ef-
fects  on  consciousness  [378].  Changes  apparent  in  this  net-
work  associated  with  classic  psychedelics  result  in  more 
cognitive  flexibility,  potentially  enhancing  divergent  think-
ing  [297].  Within  the  DMN,  classic  psychedelics  demon-
strated decoupled functional connectivity between the mPFC 
and  PCC,  which  are  areas  related  to  self-other  distinction, 
self-related  cognition,  and  self-mentalizing  [280,  577,  582]. 
In  fact,  psilocybin-induced  decreases  in  functional  connec-
tivity  between  the  mPFC  and  PCC  in  healthy  volunteers  is 
correlated with the intensity of self-dissolution and predicted 
positive  changes  in  psychosocial  functioning  4  months  later 

[479]. Therefore, it could be hypothesized, though it has not 
been  evaluated,  that  such  changes  may  aid  in  decreasing 
PTSD  symptoms  related  to  persistent  negative  cognitions 
and rumination. However, many studies on DMN inter- and 
intra-connectivity in trauma and PTSD have had mixed find-
ings,  some  with  positive  and  some  with  negative  coupling 
associated  with  PTSD  diagnosis  and  symptom  severity 
[584]. This could be explained by distinctions between sub-
systems within the DMN [585]. These complex dynamics are 
also  true  of  psychedelics,  where  DMN  within-network  con-
nectivity was found to be increased one week and one month 
after  treatment  in  depressed  individuals  [586],  in  contrast 
with acute DMN disintegration [587].  

Furthermore, the DMN and its connectivity to the Central 
Executive Network (CEN) and Salience Network (SN) have 
been  hypothesized  to  be  associated  with  PTSD  symptoms, 
though this has not been confirmed. The CEN is active dur-
ing cognitively demanding tasks, goal-directed behavior, and 
cognitive control of emotions. The SN arbitrates between the 
DMN  and  CEN  depending  on  the  perceived  threat  level  of 
internal and external stimuli. In PTSD, weak connectivity in 
the DMN and CEN is further disrupted by increased SN ac-
tivity [588]. Although no research has investigated how clas-
sic psychedelics affect these networks in patients with PTSD, 
it is known that psilocybin alters the activity and connectivi-
ty of these networks and could thus be a possible means by 
which it can treat PTSD [589]. 

3.3.6.4. Cortico-Striato-Thalamo-Cortical (CSTC) Model 

  The  cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical  (CSTC)  feedback 
loop has been suggested as a potential model for explaining 
certain mechanisms of action through which classic psyche-
delics  produce  change.  The  CSTC  is  involved  in  regulating 
consciousness and attention, as the thalamus acts as a gate so 
that only a subset of sensory information reaches the cortex 
at  any  given  time  (Fig.  6).  Stimulation  of  5-HT2A  receptors 
may disrupt thalamic gating and alter connectivity within the 
CSTC  pathways,  causing  a  flood  of  information  that  may 
contribute  to  the  subjective  experience  of  the  psychedelic 
state  [525,  590].  Neuroimaging  studies  examining  individu-
als while under the acute effects of LSD have provided sup-
port  for  this  hypothesis,  perhaps  by  activating  pyramidal 
neurons  in  layer  V  of  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex  that  pro-
ject to GABAergic neurons of the ventral striatum, which in 
turn inhibit pallido-thalamic neurons in CSTC circuits [591]. 
There  is  evidence  of  increased  functional  connectivity  be-
tween  the  thalamus  and  the  sensory-somatomotor  cortical 
regions,  as  well  as  the  posterior  cingulate  cortex  (PCC), 
while there is decreased functional connectivity between the 
thalamus and the temporal cortex [280]. The role of 5-HT2A 
stimulation  in  this  CSTC  disruption  was  tested  in  a  double-
blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with 
25  healthy  participants  utilizing  pretreatment  with  ketanser-
in,  a  5-HT2A  receptor  antagonist,  followed  by  LSD  admin-
istration  [590].  While  ketanserin  has  been  recently  noted  as 
not being 5-HT2A-specific, LSD’s effect on the thalamic gat-
ing  of  PCC  activity  was  abolished  by  ketanserin,  while  the 
LSD-induced  decrease  in  striatal  input  to  the  thalamus  was 
preserved.

Fig. (6). Effects of classic psychedelics on the brain. Psilocybin decouples functional connectivity between the ventral medial prefrontal cor-
tex (vmPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in the Default Mode Network (DMN). Acute decreases in cerebral blood flow and BOLD 
signaling are observed in the thalamus and in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices following psilocybin ingestion [378]. The intensity 
of the subjective effects of psilocybin is predicted by the magnitude of decreased activity within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and me-
dial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) [378]. Psilocybin also decreases amygdala reactivity to negative and neutral stimuli [592]. LSD reduces associ-
ative  connectivity  (i.e.,  medial  and  lateral  prefrontal  cortex,  cingulum,  insula,  and  temporoparietal  junction)  and  simultaneously  increases 
sensory-somatomotor (i.e., occipital cortex, superior temporal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and precuneus) brain-wide and thalamic connectivity 
[578]. LSD, similar to psilocybin, acutely decouples functional connectivity between the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingu-
late cortex in the DMN. Moreover, LSD decreases connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex, which has been corre-
lated with clinically measured ratings of “ego-dissolution” and “altered meaning” [580]. Ayahuasca ingestion significantly decreases activity 
through most parts of the DMN, including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Addi-
tionally, functional connectivity within the PCC/precuneus is significantly decreased [577, 582]. (A higher resolution/colour version of this 
figure is available in the electronic copy of the article). 

3.3.6.5.  Relaxed  Beliefs  Under  pSychedelics  (REBUS) 
Model

  The  “Relaxed  Beliefs  Under  pSychedelics”  (REBUS) 
model  argues  that  classic  psychedelics  decrease  the  control 
that “higher” cortical networks have on “lower” levels such 
as  subcortical  limbic  regions,  including  the  hippocampus, 
amygdala,  and  thalamus,  as  well  as  sensory  cortices.  The 
reduction in top-down control may allow for the sensitization 
of  incoming  stimuli  in  prediction  circuits,  thereby  introduc-
ing entropy and allowing fixed expectations about the world 
to be updated by new incoming information [593]. This brain 
entropy, when measured by Lempel-Ziv complexity (quanti-
fication of the uncertainty contained in time series data) via 
magnetoencephalography  (MEG),  is  correlated  with  the 
overall intensity of the psilocybin-induced psychedelic expe-
rience [280]. Using tactile stimuli, another study corroborat-
ed  psilocybin-induced  aberrations  in  prediction  error  pro-
cessing via attenuation of top-down processes [594]. Similar-
ly, ayahuasca-induced EEG changes revealed decreased top-
down information flow, and the higher excitability of poste-
rior  regions  and  decreased  excitability  of  frontal  regions 
were  associated  with  the  promotion  of  new  insights  and  as-
sociations  [595].  When  considering  how  REBUS  might  be 
clinically  useful  for  treating  PTSD,  it  could  be  inferred  that 
maladaptive  patterns  of  interpreting  internal  and  external 
cues are disrupted, facilitating the development of new ways 
of experiencing oneself and the world [589]. 

3.3.6.6. Fear Extinction 

Fear  extinction,  a  phenomenon  in  which  a  new  memory 
is acquired that inhibits fear memory and response, has been 
linked  to  molecular  processes  that  mediate  neuroplasticity, 
and is postulated to be a potential therapeutic mechanism for 
PTSD  [596].  As  described  in  Section  2.7:  Neurobiology  of 
PTSD, there are structural changes and neurological activity 
related  to  fear  responses  that  have  been  specifically  identi-
fied among individuals with PTSD, including decreased PFC 
and ACC volume, lower hippocampal/parahippocampal acti-
vation  to  positive  stimuli  and  higher  activation  to  negative 
stimuli,  and  heightened  amygdala  activity.  Classic  psyche-
delics  have  been  shown  to  promote  molecular  and  cellular 
increasing  spine  density,  neurite 
neuroplasticity  [597], 
growth,  dendritic  branching,  synapse 
formation,  and 
strengthening  synaptic  connections  in  rat  cortices  [565]. 
Though animal studies may be limited in their generalizabil-
ity  to  human  subjects,  these  data  indicate  that  the  neuro-
plastic effects of psychedelics could potentially be therapeu-
tic by reversing these structural changes and influencing fear 
conditioning and fear extinction.  

Psilocybin has been shown to extinguish trace fear condi-
tioning  in  mice  [598].  In  humans,  a  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled fMRI study showed reductions in amygdala reac-
tivity  to  negative  and  neutral  stimuli  70-90  minutes  after 
psilocybin  administration  in  healthy  volunteers,  which  was 
significantly  correlated  with  increased  positive  mood  [592]. 

 
 
 
 
The Psychedelic Future of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    679 

A  deeper  investigation  into  this  finding  revealed  that  psilo-
cybin had a modulatory effect on threat-induced connectivity 
between the amygdala and primary visual cortex, indicating 
that psilocybin may attenuate sensitivity to threatening visual 
stimuli  [599].  In  a  different  study  using  an  angry  face  dis-
crimination task, there was a reduction in functional connec-
tivity between the amygdala and the striatum after psilocybin 
administration  in  healthy  participants  [600].  This  finding 
calls into question how salience appraisal is affected by psil-
ocybin,  given  that  the  connectivity  between  the  amygdala 
and  the  basal  ganglia  functions  to  evaluate  the  salience  of 
stimuli  [601].  Moreover,  in  healthy  volunteers,  decreased 
negative  affect  and  reduced  amygdala  response  to  negative 
stimuli were observed 1 week after psilocybin administration 
but  returned  to  baseline  1  month  after  administration.  Posi-
tive affect, however, remained elevated after 1 month [586]. 
Taken  together,  it  is  speculated  that  psilocybin  can  amelio-
rate fear responses triggered by traumatic memories and as-
sociated stimuli, thus allowing patients to confront and pro-
cess their traumatic experiences [137, 263]. 

Similar  to  psilocybin,  LSD  administration  has  been 
shown  to  reduce  amygdala  reactivity  in  healthy  subjects 
when  exposed  to  fear-inducing  stimuli,  and  this  effect  ap-
pears  to  be  associated  with  acute  subjective  psychedelic  ef-
fects [471]. The effects of LSD were most significant in rela-
tion to the left amygdala, which researchers suggest may be 
associated  with  less  successful  habituation  than  the  right 
amygdala. LSD also appeared to reduce activity in the right 
mPFC,  which  may  relate  to  emotional  functioning.  These 
results  indicate  that  LSD  may  be  a  helpful  aid  in  resolving 
processing  biases  in  response  to  fear-inducing  or  negative 
stimuli [471]. In contrast to such responses to fear-inducing 
stimuli, more global hyperconnectivity between the amygda-
la and other brain regions can occur via LSD use [578]. 

  While  under  the  acute  effects  of  ayahuasca,  amygdalar 
hyperactivity  seen  in  a  single-photon  emission  computed 
tomography (SPECT) study is hypothesized to facilitate pro-
cessing  and  reconsolidation  of  traumatic  memories  and  ex-
tinction of fear associated with memory recall [504, 545]. It 
remains to be studied whether this acute amygdalar hyperac-
tivation is related to post-treatment hypoactivation to neutral 
and  negative  stimuli.  Individuals  with  PTSD  present  with  a 
decrease in naturally occurring serotonin due to reduced ser-
otonergic  signaling;  this  impacts  the  modulation  of  arousal 
and  incites  exaggerated  startle  responses  to  stimuli  [602]. 
Animal models show that ayahuasca appears to increase lev-
els of serotonin in the hippocampus at high doses and at all 
doses,  increasing  serotonin,  noradrenaline,  and  dopamine  in 
the amygdala [603]. Amygdalar dopamine is involved in fear 
extinction,  and  as  the  GABAergic  system  is  a  mediator  of 
amnesic effects, it is notable that GABA levels decrease and 
dopamine  increases  in  the  amygdala  following  the  use  of 
ayahuasca  [604,  605],  though  animal  models  suggest  that 
this may be dose-dependent [603]. 

3.3.6.7. Memory 

Following a trauma, the way in which a person’s memory 
of  the  event  is  encoded  can  strongly  impact  their  post-
traumatic  recovery.  As  described  in  Section  2:  PTSD  Over-

view  of  this  review,  an  incomplete  glucocorticoid  response 
and more enduring sympathetic activation can lead to memo-
ries  being  too  strongly  associated  with  intense  emotions 
when encoded; this can lead to significant distress and gen-
eralization of triggers [59, 73, 158]. This can relate to unin-
tended  intrusions  of  the  memory  or  related  emotional  or 
physiological states. Classic psychedelics promote a form of 
recall  in  which  such  aversive  memories  are  often  brought 
back up to the forefront of the mind alongside a heightened 
emotional  valence.  Recollection  of  memories  under  classic 
psychedelics  is  reported  to  be  more  vivid,  emotionally 
charged,  and  immersive,  where  the  type  of  memories  re-
called, such as those of childhood trauma or recent autobio-
graphical  events,  depends  on  set  and  setting  [459].  Gaining 
access  to  traumatic  memories  with  such  clarity  and  height-
ened  emotional  valence  is  proposed  to  be  one  of  several 
mechanisms  by  which  classic  psychedelics  may  promote 
healing  from  trauma  [606].  This  may  be  facilitated  by  the 
Sigma 1R receptor, which has been proposed to be involved 
in  “anti-amnesic”  pathways,  thus  assisting  in  memory  re-
trieval  [503].  Additionally,  classic  psychedelics  typically 
lead to increased circulating glucocorticoids such as cortisol 
[35,  447,  503,  505,  507],  and  ayahuasca  has  been  shown  to 
moderately  impact  the  autonomic  nervous  system  and  pro-
duce  robust  activation  of  the  HPA  axis  [503],  which  could 
potentially contrast with the initial incomplete glucocorticoid 
response  to  trauma.  Exposure  Therapy  (ET),  involving  re-
peated  exposure  to  a  feared  context  without  the  associated 
danger, is not dissimilar to the role that classic psychedelics 
may play in the context of safe and supportive spaces. How-
ever,  it  is  also  possible  that  the  nature  of  recollection  of 
memories under classic psychedelics is too vivid, emotional-
ly charged, and immersive and could, therefore, be too over-
stimulating and distressing to promote healing.  

Since  the  advent  of  psychedelic-assisted  psychotherapy, 
it  has  been  thought  that  traumatic  events  are  re-lived  under 
the effects of LSD in a manner beyond that of a typical recall 
of memory and thus are more potently addressed in treatment 
[265].  For  the  patient  with  PTSD,  simply  the  act  of  staying 
open to and immersing in these strange and novel perceptual, 
cognitive,  and  emotional  alterations  might  bring  either  an 
empowering  sense  of  mastery  or  a  re-traumatization.  Fur-
thermore,  the  process  of  making  meaning  out  of  whatever 
the  experience  may  be  -  whether  harrowing,  euphoric,  or 
anywhere and everywhere on the spectrum - is a large part of 
the  psychotherapeutic  intervention  [607,  608].  Using  data 
from EEG recordings, psilocybin-induced insightfulness has 
been  associated  with  lagged-phase  synchronization  of  delta 
oscillations  in  multiple  brain  regions,  including  parahippo-
campal,  retrosplenial  cortex  (RSC),  and  lateral  orbitofrontal 
cortex (OFC). It has been posited that the retrieval and reat-
tribution  of  autobiographical  memories  may  profoundly  in-
fluence these insights [476]. It is likely that both the type of 
memories recalled and the resultant experience of such recall 
can be influenced by the set and setting in which psychedelic 
use  occurs  [459].  Some  investigators  believe  that  traumatic 
memories elicited during psychedelic use might be reconsol-
idated  with  new  affective  associations  such  as  feelings  of 
safety,  curiosity,  and  self-compassion  [392].  Psychedelics 
induce  somatic,  perceptual,  and  emotional  alterations  in 
which  participants  may  re-encounter  or  re-experience  trau-

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

matic  memories  in  the  context  of  a  contained  environment 
with  the  guidance  of  a  trained  healer  [602].  Neuroimaging 
research  may  also  support  this  therapeutic  schema,  wherein 
participants  had  increased  activity  in  brain  regions  that  are 
involved in emotional arousal and processing, as well as so-
matic  awareness  and  subjective  feeling  states  [504,  582].  It 
can be proposed that this allows participants to identify, en-
counter,  and  interpret  distressing  thoughts  and  memories 
and,  with  the  guidance  of  healers  and  structured  interpreta-
tion sessions, improve disruptive reactions tied to such trau-
matic events. 

3.3.6.8. Social Behavior 

PTSD  symptoms  negatively  impact  the  quality  of  inter-
personal  relationships  -  avoidance  and  shame,  in  particular, 
mediate social withdrawal and isolation [609, 610]. A poten-
tial therapeutic mechanism of classic psychedelics for PTSD 
is their impact on social functioning and processing. Enhanc-
ing  social  connections  and  interpersonal  functioning  has 
been  correlated  with  improvement  in  trauma-related  symp-
toms [611]. While the effects of classic psychedelics on so-
cial  functioning  in  individuals  with  PTSD  are  yet  to  be  in-
vestigated,  a  broader  understanding  of  their  influence  on 
social behavior has been examined, and it is conceivable that 
psychedelic  therapies  may  transform  the  way  individuals 
perceive  their  interactions  with  others,  thereby  altering  the 
impaired social functioning associated with PTSD.  

  The  neuropharmacological  mechanisms  underlying  the 
prosocial effects of classic psychedelics have been associated 
with  5-HT2A  receptor  agonism  [465].  The  prefrontal  cortex 
(PFC)  is  a  key  brain  region  that  modulates  social  behavior, 
and the layer V pyramidal glutamatergic neurons of the me-
dial  PFC  (mPFC)  are  primary  modulators  of  the  behavioral 
effects of LSD (Fig. 6). The use of LSD causes an increase in 
spine  density  in  cortical  neurons,  activating  cortical  AMPA 
and  5-HT2A  responses  that  promote  social  behavior.  The 
mechanistic  target  of  rapamycin  complex  1  (mTORC1)  ap-
pears to be a key complex in this process (Fig. 5), as the use of 
a  mTORC1  inhibitor  reverses  the  process,  and  dysregulation 
of mTORC1 is associated with social deficit disorders [612]. 

  Both  psilocybin  and  LSD  acutely  enhance  prosocial  be-
havior and influence social cognition [613], and their ability 
to  enhance  connectedness  is  proposed  to  play  an  essential 
role  in  their  therapeutic  efficacy  [614].  Patients  who  en-
dorsed  treatment  effectiveness  after  undergoing  psilocybin-
assisted  psychotherapy  for  treatment-resistant  depression 
(TRD) indicated a renewed sense of connection as a key me-
diating  factor.  This  sense  of  connectedness,  as  defined  by  a 
connection to self, others, and the world in general, was also 
reported  acutely  during  psilocybin-assisted  psychotherapy 
sessions  and  endured  for  several  months  after  treatment 
[468].  In  follow-up  interviews  to  an  open-label  pilot  study 
investigating the effects of psilocybin treatment on smoking 
cessation, participants reported that psilocybin induced feel-
ings of love and connection with their environment and with 
other  people  whom  they  deemed  important  for  quitting 
smoking. These patients also reported engaging more in pro-
social  and  altruistic  activities  after  psilocybin  treatment 
[615].  In  a  prospective  study  using  online  self-reported 
measures, reductions in the personality domain Neuroticism 

and  increases  in  Agreeableness  and  Social  Connectedness 
were found after consuming a psychedelic. These changes in 
Neuroticism  and  Agreeableness  covaried  over  time,  which 
may  be  suggestive  of  common  processes  involving  emotion 
regulation [616]. In the long term, self-reported measures in 
interpersonal  closeness  and  positive  altruistic  effects  have 
been sustained for up to 14 months following 1-2 administra-
tions of psilocybin [617]. Self-reported increases in positive 
altruistic  effects  were  similarly  reported  up  to  12  months 
following LSD administration [618]. 

3.3.7.  Evidence  Involving  Classic  Psychedelics  for  PTSD 
Treatment 

  To  date,  there  have  been  no  published  results  of  RCTs 
investigating  the  efficacy  of  classic  psychedelics  as  a  treat-
ment  for  PTSD.  However,  there  are  currently  studies  in  the 
phase  of  recruiting  that  aim  to  provide  proof  of  concept  for 
these  medications  as  potential  treatment  options  (Table  2). 
Despite  this  preliminary  stage  of  research  into  PTSD  treat-
ment,  some  evidence  to  support  this  endeavor  can  be  found 
in the surveys and trials reviewed below. 

  One  prospective  study  that  involved  convenience  sam-
ples  of  individuals  using  a  psychedelic  found  that  classic 
psychedelics  reduced  self-reported  experiential  avoidance,  a 
finding  that  was  significantly  correlated  with  reductions  in 
depression  and  suicidal  ideation  [619].  Another  cross-
sectional,  observational  study  assessed  the  effects  of  psyche-
delic  substances  on  individuals  who  had  experienced  racial 
trauma. The researchers recruited Black, Indigenous, and Peo-
ple of Color (BIPOC) who had used a classic psychedelic sub-
stance in the natural environment (i.e., not in the context of a 
research study). They found a decrease in self-reported symp-
toms  of  traumatic  stress  that  correlated  significantly  with  the 
acute  psychedelic  effects  of  psilocybin  and  other  hallucino-
gens  [458].  Participants  reported  decreases  in  symptoms  of 
stress, traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety after their psy-
chedelic experience, in contrast with their reported symptoms 
prior to the experience, and there were no significant differ-
ences  in  results  based  on  the  type  of  substance  used.  Given 
that  the  majority  of  individuals  reported  their  psychedelic 
experience as having occurred 3 or more years ago, there is 
also evidence of enduring benefit [458]. Though the indica-
tions of this study are important, as BIPOC are significantly 
underrepresented in psychedelic research, it should be noted 
that  only  individuals  who  endorsed  benefits  from  their  psy-
chedelic experiences were included in this study. Thus, further 
research assessing a broader community, as well as research in 
a  clinical  context,  should  be  conducted  to  more  accurately 
assess  the  effects  of  psychedelic-assisted  psychotherapy  on 
mental health symptoms related to race-based trauma. 

3.3.7.1. Psilocybin 

  According  to  ClinicalTrials.gov,  there  is  one  open-label 
clinical  trial  set  to  study  the  safety  of  investigational 
COMP360  (a  proprietary,  pharmaceutical-grade,  synthetic 
psilocybin  formulation)  administered  under  supportive  con-
ditions  in  participants  with  PTSD,  as  well  as  an  open-label 
clinical trial set to study the therapeutic effects of psilocybin 
in  patients  with  treatment-resistant  PTSD.  Both  trials  are 
currently still in the recruitment phase (Table 4).

  As summarized by Khan et al. [620], some evidence sug-
gests  that  psilocybin  has  the  potential  to  be  an  effective 
treatment option for PTSD. In a single-arm, open-label study 
investigating the safety and feasibility of psilocybin-assisted 
group  therapy  for  demoralization,  PTSD  symptoms  were 
examined  as  a  secondary  outcome.  This  study  recruited  a 
sample  of  ages  18  or  older,  gay-identified,  long-term  AIDS 
survivors,  who  demonstrated  a  decline  in  PTSD  severity 
from baseline by the end of treatment. This effect was main-
tained  at  a  3-month  follow-up  with  moderate  effect  sizes. 
However, the relevance of these findings is limited, as only 3 
of  the  18  participants  had  a  baseline  PTSD  severity  score 
above the clinical cut-off [621].  

Some evidence suggests that psilocybin can reduce trans-
diagnostic features of PTSD, such as avoidance and feelings 
of disconnectedness [620]. In follow-up interviews conduct-
ed  6  months  after  psilocybin  psychotherapy  for  treatment-
resistant  depression  (TRD),  participants  reported  shifting 
from  avoidance  to  acceptance  of  traumatic  memories  and 
painful emotions. They also endorsed increased understand-
ing  and  compassion  for  past  abusers,  greater  access  to  
autobiographical  material,  and  a  sense  of  reconnection  with 
self,  others,  and  the  world  [468].  Moreover,  follow-up  
studies to clinical trials assessing psilocybin-assisted psycho-
therapy for end-of-life anxiety reported that participants were 
able  to  retrieve  and  process  traumatic  childhood  memories 
[622]. 

3.3.7.2. LSD 

  The use of LSD to treat PTSD has not been studied in a 
modern,  rigorous,  randomized  clinical  trial,  and  the  diagno-
sis  of  PTSD  did  not  formally  exist  when  the  first  wave  of 
research  on  LSD  was  conducted,  thus  making  it  difficult  to 
evaluate  early  research  into  LSD-based  trauma  treatments. 
There  are  some  indications  that  it  may  be  efficacious  (e.g., 
[407]); however, researchers have expressed concern that the 
effects  of  LSD  might  interact  with  and  exacerbate  trauma-
related  symptoms.  Hofmann  argued  that  LSD’s  tendency  to 
enhance  whatever  emotional  state  a  person  is  in  when  they 
consume it may make it inappropriate for those who may be 
in  an  unhappy,  fearful,  or  disturbed  state  of  mind  [265].  To 
date,  the  research  for  LSD  has  been  most  robust  for  the 
treatment  of  alcohol  use  disorder  (AUD)  and  anxiety  disor-
ders  (see  Section  2.9:  Common  Co-Occurring  Disorders). 
However,  some  preliminary  research  into  the  effects  of  this 
drug  on  trauma  sequelae  has  been  conducted,  the  results  of 
which are presented below. 

  Though  there  have  been  no  clinical  trials  investigating 
the effects of LSD on PTSD, the Swiss Federal Act on Nar-
cotics and Psychotropic Substances grants case-by-case per-
mission  to  use  MDMA  and  LSD  to  assist  psychotherapy. 
The combined use of these substances was described in clin-

for treating patients with complex PTSD (c-PTSD). For these

patients,  treatment  followed  International  Society  for  Trau-
matic Stress Studies (ISTSS) treatment guidelines, including 
a  phased  approach  incorporating  psychoeducation,  emotion 
regulation,  exposure,  cognitive  processing,  targeting  emo-
tions, and reorganizing memory functions before undergoing 
the  psychedelic  experience.  For  all  participants,  additional 
preparatory  steps,  including  individual  therapy  when  neces-
sary, were taken to ensure readiness for the psychedelic ex-
perience.  Twelve-person  group  psychedelic  experiences  (in-
cluding  one  preparatory  and  one  integrative  meeting)  took 
place  4  times  per  year,  with  three  therapists  attending.  In 
regards to which substance was selected for each participant 
in each group's psychedelic experience, patients with trauma 
typically  started  with  MDMA.  The  rationale  of  using 
MDMA first in these cases was to help foster trust and com-
fort with a less intense and more prosocial, empathic experi-
ence. LSD was then utilized in a second phase of treatment if 
agreed  upon  when  the  traumatic  material  it  could  produce 
would be better tolerated. The optimal dose was found with-
in the first few sessions. Generally, patients who were highly 
emotionally  controlled  responded  better  to  higher  doses  of 
LSD,  whereas  those  with  emotional  instability  and  impul-
siveness seemed to benefit from lower doses. 

  One  notable  outcome  indicated  that  for  c-PTSD,  partici-
pants  appeared  to  need  more  psychedelic  experiences,  with 
ranges of 1-9 MDMA sessions and 1-12 LSD sessions being 
utilized.  Participants  with  trauma-related  disorders  overall 
experienced  better  outcomes  than  those  in  other  diagnostic 
subgroups,  such  as  depression,  and  were  more  likely  to  ac-
cept the process as one that is lengthy and involves revisiting 
traumatic  events  as  well  as  engaging  in  challenging  self-
examination. They also found that for individuals with trau-
matic  experiences,  LSD  was  able  to  target  a  patient’s  deep-
rooted  negative  self-beliefs  in  a  way  that  MDMA  alone  did 
not.  Finally,  an  effect  of  the  group  modality  was  that  core 
members of the group began to meet outside of the therapeu-
tic  context  to  provide  support  to  each  other  and  to  model 
secure  attachment,  responsibility,  and  care  to  incoming  par-
ticipants. 

  Adverse  events  included  evidence  that  individuals  with 
comorbid  borderline  traits  had  more  difficult  experiences, 
though they notably elicited high levels of support from their 
co-attendees. Suicidal thoughts and mild self-harm occurred 
but were managed within integrative psychotherapy, with no 
suicide  attempts  reported.  One  woman,  with  a  past  episode 
of  childhood  sexual  abuse  as  the  focus  of  her  LSD  session, 
experienced a prolonged delusional phase; this was resolved 
during the integration phase and with the use of limited med-
ication for sleep. 

3.3.7.3. Ayahuasca 

Similar to psilocybin and LSD, there are no clinical trials 
investigating  the  efficacy  of  ayahuasca  for  the  treatment  of 
PTSD. However, survey data (Table 6) have implicated posi-
tive outcomes for ayahuasca users in regard to symptom mit-
igation. For example, a large survey spanning over 50 coun-
tries, 6 languages, and 6,877 participants utilized the Psycho-
logical  Well-Being-Post-Traumatic  Changes  Questionnaire 
to  measure  psychological  growth  in  individuals  who  had 
used  ayahuasca.  Though  they  did  not  specifically  measure 

trauma  history  or  PTSD  symptoms,  outcome  data  indicate 
improvements  in  psychological  well-being  using  this  meas-
ure, though mediated by a number of factors, including self-
insights,  mystical  experience,  integration,  level  of  fear,  and 
community  [624].  Recent  research  has  indicated  that  aya-
huasca  has  rapid  and  long-acting  antidepressant  and  anxio-
lytic effects [453, 625, 626]. One cross-sectional longitudinal 
trial of long-term ayahuasca users found that 83.3% reported 
clinical  improvement  that  lasted  up  to  6  months  [625].  Per 
the  Mini  International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  (MINI), 
45%  of  participants  met  diagnostic  criteria  for  psychiatric 
diagnoses  at  baseline,  and  65%  of  those  subjects  no  longer 
met  diagnostic  criteria  at  1-month  follow-up.  The  authors 
report  this  is  in  line  with  their  previous  work  developing  a 
self-administered  questionnaire  that  found  among  380  long-
term ayahuasca users, 56% of the subjects reported reducing 
their use of prescription drugs [627].  

  Another  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  of  Santo 
Daime  religion  members  found  significant  attenuation  in 
hopeless and panic-like parameters in the Beck Hopelessness 
Scale (BHS) and Anxiety Sensitivity Index - Revised (ASI-
R)  psychometric  scales,  respectively,  1  hour  following  ad-
ministration [628]. However, participants did not have panic 
or  depressive  disorders,  and  long-term  changes  were  not 
measured.  Despite  these  limitations,  this  trial  demonstrates 
an  acute  decrease  in  hopelessness  and  panic-like  symptoms 
during ayahuasca administration, which could be relevant in 
the  context  of  recall  of  traumatic  experiences  in  those  with 
PTSD. 

3.4. Ketamine  

3.4.1. Introduction and History 

  The  dissociative  anesthetic  ketamine  (Table  1;  Fig.  2) 
was first synthesized in 1962 by chemist Calvin Stevens as a 
more  suitable  clinical  anesthetic  to  phencyclidine  (PCP) 
[629,  630].  It  was  approved  for  this  application  by  the  U.S. 
Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  in  1970  [631].  While 
ketamine  is  not  classified  as  a  psychedelic,  it  is  included  in 
this  review  because  its  use  is  relevant  and  promising  for  the 
treatment  of  PTSD  and  other  trauma-related  disorders,  and 
similar  to  psychedelics,  it  is  a  treatment  that  involves  an  al-
tered state of consciousness. Additionally, it is sometimes re-
ferred to in community settings as a psychedelic, and thus, it is 
helpful  to  explore  the  similarities  and  differences  between 
them when considering the future of psychedelic medicine. 

  Researchers  observed  that  individuals  who  were  given 
ketamine rapidly entered into a distinct state of altered con-
sciousness that involved a disconnection from their immedi-
ate  surroundings  [632].  These  unique  effects  prompted  the 
categorization of ketamine as a dissociative anesthetic [629]. 
Around  this  same  time  period,  ketamine  began  to  surge  in 
popularity  as  a  psychoactive  party  drug  used  in  recreational 
contexts  [633].  In  1999,  the  DEA  designated  ketamine  as  a 
Schedule  III  controlled  substance  due  to  growing  concerns 
over diversion and abuse of the drug [634]. To this day, ket-
amine  remains  commonly  used  outside  of  clinical  contexts 
worldwide  for  its  dissociative  and  euphoric  effects,  fueling 
ongoing  investigation  into  its  potential  for  abuse  and  its 
long-term effects [635, 636].

  Ketamine was first noted as a potential psychiatric thera-
peutic  by  the  Mexican  psychiatrist  Salvador  Roquet  in  the 
1970s. His controversial work included the induction of ex-
treme psychological states and sensory overload via psycho-
active drugs in his patients. Roquet believed that administer-
ing  ketamine  in  subanesthetic  doses  produced  “profound 
changes  in  psychological  functioning”  that  catalyzed  his 
patients’ progress in psychotherapy [637, 638]. However, the 
model  proposed  by  Roquet  failed  to  gain  momentum  in 
mainstream psychiatry. A pivotal study published in 2000 by 
Berman and colleagues [204] generated significant interest in 
ketamine's  therapeutic  potential,  as  it  demonstrated  that  ad-
ministering  subanesthetic  IV  doses  of  ketamine  to  patients 
with major depressive disorder (MDD) may have a rapid and 
significant antidepressant effect within 72 hours of treatment 
[204]. These findings were replicated by investigators at the 
National  Institute  of  Mental  Health  (NIMH)  in  2006,  who 
demonstrated  that  a  single  subanesthetic  ketamine  dose  re-
duced symptoms of suicidal ideation and depression as rap-
idly  as  2  hours  post-administration  in  treatment-resistant 
depression (TRD) populations [639]. Hundreds of additional 
studies  exploring  ketamine’s  influence  on  symptoms  of  de-
pression  and  suicidal  ideation  have  since  been  initiated 
[633]. In 2019, the FDA approved the first ketamine-derived 
mental  health  treatment,  Spravato,  an  intranasal  esketamine 
(the  S-enantiomer  of  ketamine)  prescribed  as  augmentation 
therapy for TRD [632]. The duration of the rapid effects re-
mains to be better studied [637]. Over the past two decades, 
ketamine has also gained recognition as a potential treatment 
for  various  mental  health  conditions,  including  depression 
[204], suicidal ideation [640, 641], and PTSD [642]. 

Preliminary  studies  suggest  that  ketamine  may  rapidly 
reduce symptoms of chronic PTSD [637, 643], but the exist-
ing  trials  (reviewed  below)  will  require  replication  and  ex-
tension. Furthermore, the underlying molecular mechanisms, 
duration  of  treatment  benefits,  and  potential  risks  for  thera-
peutic ketamine within the context of PTSD, described in the 
following sections, also remain to be defined. Ongoing clini-
cal trials of ketamine to treat PTSD seek to answer some of 
these questions. 

3.4.2. Therapeutic Model 

  The  FDA-approved  esketamine  dosing  model,  which  is 
the  prevailing  medical  model  of  clinical  ketamine  admin-
istration, and much of the existing body of research on keta-
mine’s  therapeutic  value  are  based  on  a  “biochemical  para-
digm”  [644].  This  paradigm  is  grounded  on  the  assumption 
that  ketamine’s  therapeutic  benefit  stems  primarily,  if  not 
solely,  from  its  pharmacological  effects,  with  negligible  in-
fluence  from  any  supporting  psychotherapy  or  the  individu-
al’s  subjective  experience.  This  approach  diverges  from  
the  psychedelic-assisted  psychotherapy  framework  found 
throughout  current  research  on  the  therapeutic  potential  of 
psychedelics [263]. Indeed, it is debatable whether ketamine 
is  a  psychedelic  and/or  whether  its  subjective  qualities  con-
tribute  to  efficacy  vs.  constitute  unwanted  side  effects.  Ac-
cordingly,  unlike  most  psychedelic-assisted  psychotherapy 
models,  the  standard  setting  for  ketamine  administration  is 
clinical  and  aesthetically  neutral,  with  minimal  attention  to 
the  physical  setting,  music,  structured  preparation,  or  post-
session  integration  intended  for  reflection  upon  the  experi-

ence  [263].  Within  this  model,  psychotherapeutic  support 
and direct engagement with a therapist or therapist team are 
under-emphasized [637], and an individual’s subjective drug 
experience is considered nonessential. 

In recent years, private boutique clinics offering ketamine 
treatment  for  various  mental  health  disorders,  including 
PTSD, have become increasingly prevalent [645]. The treat-
ment models utilized by these clinics assume the efficacy of 
ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP), which has yet to be 
fully  explored  in  systematic  studies.  There  is  a  belief  that 
psychotherapy  may  prolong  the  initial  gains  experienced 
after  ketamine  use,  but  there  is  little  clarity  on  the  optimal 
format. Administration methods and doses of ketamine vary 
significantly  (Table  1),  as  do  the  number  of  ketamine  ses-
sions.  Additionally,  no  standard  form  of  psychotherapy  is 
utilized,  nor  does  a  standard  exist  for  when  in  the  process 
psychotherapy  occurs  (i.e.,  before,  during,  or  after  the  keta-
mine administration) [645]. Despite the lack of standardiza-
tion  and  empirical  evidence,  however,  KAP  has  gained 
popularity  among  some  mental  health  practitioners  and  pa-
tients seeking alternative treatments. 

3.4.3. Psychological Effects 

3.4.3.1.  Subjective  Effects:  Dissociative,  Psychotomimetic, 
and Psychedelic Effects 

  Acute  subanesthetic  ketamine  administration  is  associat-
ed  with  a  spectrum  of  dissociative,  psychotomimetic,  and 
psychedelic  subjective  effects  [645,  646],  which  are  largely 
dose-dependent  [629].  These  can  vary  widely  within  and 
between  users  [647].  Ketamine’s  dissociative  effects  (Table 
1)  can  include  perceptual  distortions  and  the  induction  of 
transient  feelings  of  detachment  from  self  and  the  environ-
ment. Whether or not the dissociative effects of ketamine are 
predictive of treatment outcomes has been a topic of contro-
versy, with insufficient evidence to draw conclusions [648]. 
Discussed  at  length  throughout  the  psychedelic  literature  is 
the  idea  of  context  being  crucial  to  the  efficacy  of  PAP 
[649], and this may be a factor in the therapeutic efficacy of 
the  dissociative  states  elicited  in  ketamine-assisted  psycho-
therapy.  Further  research  is  needed  to  explore  the  relation-
ship  between  ketamine-induced  dissociation  and  antidepres-
sant  response.  Ketamine  is  also  associated  with  transient 
psychotomimetic  effects,  especially  for  populations  with  a 
predisposition for psychosis. In individuals with schizophre-
nia,  for  example,  ketamine  can  exacerbate  psychotic  phe-
nomena [646].  

  Ketamine’s  psychoactive  effects  have  led  many  to  con-
sider this drug as a psychedelic. However, ketamine is not a 
classic  psychedelic,  and  it  may  be  that  its  status  as  a  legal 
drug  has  prompted  many  who  are  interested  in  performing 
psychedelic-assisted therapy to assert that ketamine is a psy-
chedelic based on its subjective effects. Indeed, subanesthet-
ic doses can cause similar subjective effects such as eupho-
ria,  transient  dissociation,  alterations  in  the  perception  of 
time  and  space,  derealization,  mystical-type  effects,  confu-
sion,  and  paranoia  [532,  647,  650].  While  some  view  these 
as  side  effects  to  be  mitigated,  other  researchers  and  practi-
tioners  seek  to  leverage  the  psychedelic  experiences  associ-
ated  with  ketamine  administration,  believing  that  transper-
sonal  experiences  may  provide  therapeutic  benefits  in  the 

context  of  psychotherapy,  including  stimulating  new  per-
spectives  and  insights.  This  treatment  model  is  broadly  re-
ferred to as ketamine-assisted psychotherapy [532]. It should 
be noted, however, that to date, no systematic studies exam-
ining the efficacy of KAP have been conducted. 

3.4.3.2.  Cognitive  Effects:  Memory  and  Cognitive  Impair-
ments 

  Ketamine  (Table  1;  Fig.  2)  antagonizes  N-methyl-D-
aspartate  receptors,  most  localized  to  the  hippocampus  and 
cerebral  cortex,  and  implicated  in  memory  and  cognition 
[651].  NMDA  antagonists  are  thought  to  interfere  with  hip-
pocampal  long-term  potentiation,  the  proposed  neuronal 
mechanism  for  learning  [651].  Subanesthetic  ketamine  has 
been shown to affect memory and cognition during and im-
mediately  following  administration,  including  impairments 
to episodic, semantic, and procedural memory, verbal fluen-
cy, vigilance, and delayed recall, as well as decreased recog-
nition  and  concentration  [652].  Data  obtained  from  long-
term  ketamine  abuse  studies  suggest  enduring  reductions  in 
memory  and  cognitive  ability  beyond  exposure  to  the  drug; 
however,  these  studies  are  based  on  recreational  use,  and 
similar long-term effects have not been identified thus far in 
the  study  of  repeat  clinical  ketamine  or  esketamine  admin-
istration  for  depression  [652,  653].  Research  in  this  area  is 
ongoing [653].  

3.4.4. Somatic Effects 

  The  effects  of  ketamine  can  vary  depending  on  factors 
such  as  dose  and  route  of  administration.  Generally,  the 
acute  effects  of  a  single  dose  of  ketamine  last  between  30 
minutes  and  several  hours  [654]  (Table  1).  Ketamine  pro-
duces  a  range  of  dose-dependent  somatic  effects,  including 
changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate, as 
well as alterations in the perception of pain and temperature 
[630, 631]. 

3.4.5. Pharmacology 

3.4.5.1. Drug Properties: Structure 

Structurally,  ketamine  (Fig.  2)  is  a  racemic  mixture  com-
posed of two enantiomers, (S)- and (R)-ketamine. Ketamine’s 
(S)-enantiomer has a higher affinity to the primary binding site 
on  N-methyl-D-aspartic  acid  receptors  (NMDARs)  than  its 
(R)-enantiomer  counterpart,  and  is  3-4  times  more  potent  in 
inducing  anesthesia  [655].  Some  studies  using  animal  mod-
els  of  depression  have  suggested  potential  advantages  for 
therapeutic  utilization  of  (R)-ketamine  over  (S)-ketamine, 
including longer-lasting antidepressant effects, more signifi-
cant  changes  in  neuroplasticity,  and  fewer  psychotomimetic 
effects [656, 657], although the literature is inconclusive. 

3.4.5.2. Pharmacokinetics (Metabolism) 

  Ketamine’s  bioavailability  and  onset  of  action  depend 
largely  on  its  route  of  administration  [649]  (Table  1).  As 
ketamine is both water- and lipid-soluble, it can be adminis-
tered  intravenously  (IV),  intramuscularly  (IM),  rectally,  in-
tranasally,  orally,  sublingually,  subcutaneously,  and  via  in-
jection into the epidural space [629]. In clinical trials to date, 
IV  ketamine  has  been  considered  the  ideal  dosing  method, 

 
 
The Psychedelic Future of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    685 

with  100%  bioavailability  and  rapid  onset  of  action  [629, 
655].  IM  ketamine  demonstrates  93%  bioavailability  [629], 
whereas  rectal,  intranasal,  and  oral  bioavailability  are  ap-
proximately  45%,  30%,  and  20%,  respectively  [658].  These 
other  forms  have  been  primarily  used  off-label  in  clinics 
[659, 660], but are not as well researched. 

  Upon administration, ketamine rapidly crosses the blood-
brain  barrier  and  is  distributed  throughout  the  body,  with  a 
relatively short distribution half-life of 10-15 minutes [629]. 
Metabolization of ketamine is extensive and primarily occurs 
within  the  liver  [658].  Ketamine  is  initially  metabolized  to 
the  active  metabolite  norketamine  (norKET)  via  nitrogen 
demethylation, a process that is catalyzed primarily by hepat-
ic enzymes CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 [658, 661]. Norketamine 
is  subsequently  metabolized  to  hydroxynorketamine  (HNK) 
by  CYP2A6  and  CYP2B6  and  to  dehydronorketamine 
(DHNK) by CYP2B6 [661]. 

that 

Preliminary research into the therapeutic potential of spe-
cific  ketamine  metabolites  has  grown  in  recent  years,  with 
some  studies  employing  mouse  models  of  depression 
demonstrating 
the  metabolite  (2R,6R)-hydroxynor-
ketamine  ((2R,6R)-HNK)  produces  similar  antidepressant 
effects  to  ketamine  without  the  observed  side  effects. 
(2R,6R)-HNK  does  not  affect  NMDA  receptors,  thus  sug-
gesting that NMDAR blockade may not be as fundamental to 
ketamine’s  antidepressant  effects  as  previously  believed 
[662]. 

In adults, ketamine and its two enantiomers (S-ketamine 
and  R-ketamine)  have  short  elimination  half-lives  of  180 
minutes and 155-158 minutes, respectively. Ketamine and its 
metabolites  are  primarily  excreted  by  the  kidneys  as  urine, 
with  2%  excreted  unchanged,  2%  as  norketamine,  and  16% 
as  DHNK.  The  remaining  80%  of  the  drug  is  excreted  as 
conjugates of HK and HNK with glucuronic acid [661].  

3.4.5.3. Pharmacodynamics 

  Many studies investigating ketamine for the treatment of 
depression  and  other  psychiatric  indications  utilize  intrave-
nous  ketamine  at  a  subanesthetic  dose  of  0.5  mg/kg  over  a 
40-minute  infusion,  resulting  in  a  maximal  plasma  concen-
tration (Cmax) of (cid:2)185 ng/ml or (cid:2)0.78 μM ketamine [652, 
663,  664].  In  addition  to  IV  administration,  the  therapeutic 
effects of intranasal (IN) and, less commonly, intramuscular 
(IM)  administration  of  ketamine  have  been  investigated  in 
other study designs [665, 666] (Table 1).  Ketamine is a non-
competitive NMDAR antagonist [662] (Fig. 7). Its effects on 
the  central  nervous  system  are  thought  to  be  related  to  glu-
tamate receptor binding [631] (Fig. 7). 

3.4.5.3.1. Mechanism of Action 

  Ketamine’s  neuropharmacology  is  complicated,  and  the 
precise  mechanisms  of  action  remain  poorly  understood 
[661].  Multiple  potentially  complementary  mechanisms  of 
action have been hypothesized [661]. Its rationale for use in 
treating  PTSD  is  similarly  unclear.    One  such  hypothesis 
proposes that ketamine facilitates the release of glutamate in 
the mPFC via NMDAR antagonism on GABAergic interneu-
rons  at  subanesthetic  doses  [646,  655,  668]  (Fig.  7).  Gluta-
mate subsequently binds to postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-

5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic  acid  receptors  (AMPARs), 
stimulating  an  increase  in  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor 
(BDNF), with downstream activation of the mammalian tar-
get of rapamycin (mTOR) [646] thereby inducing neuroplas-
ticity and facilitating dendrite growth, potentially underlying 
ketamine’s  therapeutic  effects  [668]  (Fig.  7).  Another  pro-
posed mechanism suggests that ketamine exerts an inhibitory 
effect on NMDAR-mediated spontaneous neurotransmission, 
thereby attenuating the activity of eukaryotic elongation fac-
tor  2  kinase  (eEF2k),  impeding  phosphorylation  of  eEF2, 
and upregulating the translation of BDNF [661, 667]. Other 
mechanisms hypothesized to mediate ketamine’s antidepres-

  Recent  evidence  also  suggests  that  ketamine-induced 
effects  on  the  subgenual  anterior  cingulate  cortex  (sgACC) 
activity may be involved in the drug’s mechanism of action 
(Fig.  8).  Hyperactivity  in  the  sgACC  has  been  linked  to 
MDD, and normalization of sgACC activity has been associ-
ated  with  response  to  antidepressant  treatment  [646,  674, 
675]. A recent study in nonhuman primates found that keta-
mine  injected  directly  into  the  sgACC  reversed  depressive-
like  impairments  produced  by  sgACC  overactivation  [675]. 
Similarly,  a  study  on  individuals  with  MDD  found  that 
sgACC hyper-activation to positive monetary incentives was 
blunted by ketamine infusions [674]. 

Studies have uncovered other potential molecular targets 
for ketamine in the treatment of depression, such as the acti-
vation  of  human-recombinant  μ,  κ,  and  δ  opioid  receptors 
[646, 661, 676]. Data from a recent rodent study suggest that 
the opioid system is necessary for the antidepressant actions 
of  ketamine  in  rodent  models,  but  ketamine  likely  does  not 
act as an opioid in order to produce these effects [677].  No-
tably, Williams et al. also concluded that ketamine’s antide-
pressant effect requires activation of the opioid system after 
observing  that  pretreating  individuals  with  TRD  using  nal-
trexone,  an  opioid  antagonist,  significantly  attenuated  the 
antidepressant  and  anti-suicidal  ideation  effects  of  a  subse-
quent  ketamine  dose  [678].  However,  a  pilot  study  (n  =  5) 
challenged  these  findings  [679],  and  the  role  of  the  opioid 
system  in  ketamine’s  antidepressant  effects  requires  clarifi-
cation through larger replication studies [680]. 

  Ketamine  may  affect  additional  targets,  including  volt-
age-gated  sodium  channels,  hyperpolarization-activated  cy-
clic  nucleotide-gated  (HCN)  channels,  and  sigma  receptors. 
Ketamine’s  interactions  with  these  targets  are  extensively 
reviewed elsewhere [633, 652].  

3.4.5.4. Safety Profile & Adverse Effects 

  Given  the  potential  benefits  observed  with  multiple  ket-
amine  dosing  sessions  and  the  need  for  maintenance  treat-
ment after stabilization of symptoms, it is essential to better 
understand  possible  risks  associated  with  maintenance  dos-
ing schedules and long-term use; safety and tolerability must 
be assessed in this context. Notable adverse effects of long-
term  ketamine  use  can  include  psychotic-like  symptoms, 
memory  impairments,  and  bladder  damage  [651,  681,  682],

Fig. (7). Molecular mechanisms of ketamine, highlighting the glutamatergic system where the cellular mechanisms of ketamine and classic 
psychedelics  may  converge:  Ketamine  antagonizes  NMDA  receptors  on  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA)ergic  interneurons,  leading  to 
disinhibition (releasing the breaks on hyperpolarization) of the target glutamatergic cortical neuron and in turn causes a glutamate surge. Glu-
tamate then acts on  α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors in the post-synaptic cell, leading to increased 
BDNF release, activation of the tropomyosin-related kinase receptor type B (TrkB), and activation of mTORC1, essentially increasing rapid 
BDNF translation and leading to an upregulation of plasticity genes [661]. A particular ketamine metabolite, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine 
[(2R,6R)-HNK], may additionally promote synaptic potentiation [530]. Ketamine may also block spontaneous neurotransmission mediated by 
NMDAR, preventing the phosphorylation of eEF2 and resulting in increased translation of BDNF [661]. Ketamine selectively inhibits extra-
synaptic NMDARs, which is believed to de-suppress mTORC1 activity, leading to increased protein synthesis [661, 667]. (A higher resolu-
tion/colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article). 

and adverse effects following a single dose can include acute 
physiological  and  psychological  changes  (Table  1).  Select 
side effects and potential adverse events will be discussed in 
greater detail below. 

3.4.5.4.1. Neuroanatomy (Long-Term Effects) 

In  a  2022  systematic  review,  Strous  et  al.  [683]  found 
key changes in neuroanatomy associated with long-term ket-
amine  abuse.  These  changes  include  lower  gray  matter  vol-
ume,  primarily  in  the  frontal,  parietal,  and  occipital  lobes, 
lower white matter integrity in the frontal and temporoparie-
tal lobes, and lower thalamo- and corticocortical connectivi-
ty.  Lower  activity  in  the  spatial  memory  and  motor  brain 
regions, higher functional connectivity between the dorsolat-
eral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and right orbitofrontal cortex 
with white matter volume, and higher dopamine D1 binding 
in the DLPFC were also identified. These differences suggest 
that  chronic  ketamine  users  may  experience  structural  and 
functional  changes  in  cortical  gray  and  white  matter.  These 
changes also appear to be correlated with the frequency and 

amount  of  ketamine  consumed  by  long-term  users,  suggest-
ing  that  increased  dose  and  duration  of  ketamine  use  may 
affect  brain  structure  and  function  more  significantly  [683]. 
These  neuroanatomical  differences  provide  a  potential  ex-
planation  for  harmful  psychological  and  cognitive  side  ef-
fects associated with chronic ketamine use [684]. 

3.4.5.4.2. Urinary and Gastrointestinal Toxicity (Long-Term 
Effects) 

  Chronic  recreational  ketamine  use  has  been  associated 
with gastrointestinal (GI) and urinary complications. Report-
ed GI complications of long-term ketamine use are epigastric 
pain,  cholestasis  and  biliary  dilatation,  and  hepatic  toxicity 
[685, 686]. These GI issues may be due to NMDA receptor 
blockade  in  the  smooth  muscle  [687].  Urological  complica-
tions  associated  with  prolonged  recreational  ketamine  use 
include  ulcerative  cystitis,  dysuria,  frequency  and  urgency, 
incontinence, and gross hematuria [652, 688-690]. In recrea-
tional  users,  ketamine-associated  urinary  and  GI  disorders 
typically  occur  during  long-term  use  and  lessen,  or  entirely

Fig. (8). Effects of ketamine on the brain. Ketamine administration produces rapid, focal decreases in activity within the ventromedial frontal 
cortex, including the orbitofrontal cortex and the subgenual cingulate. This decrease was strongly predictive of ketamine’s dissociative effects 
[670]. Ketamine increases neural activation in the midcingulate cortex, the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the insula bilat-
erally, and the thalamus. Ketamine also decreases neural activity in a cluster within the subgenual/subcallosal part of the anterior cingulate 
cortex,  the  orbitofrontal  cortex,  and  the  gyrus  rectus  [671].  In  the  Executive  Control  Network  (ECN),  ketamine  significantly  increases  the 
functional connectivity with parts of the anterior cingulum and superior frontal gyrus. Ketamine decreases connectivity between the Salience 
Network (SN) and the calcarine fissure, which is significantly correlated with negative symptoms (PANSS) [672]. Finally, ketamine decreas-
es functional connectivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and increases connectivity in the intraparietal cortices [673]. (A higher reso-
lution/colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article). 

resolve, the longer a person is abstinent [691, 692]. No evi-
dence of ketamine-induced urological toxicity has been iden-
tified thus far in adults receiving ketamine for the treatment 
of  mood  disorders  or  repeated-dose  esketamine  for  TRD 
[693, 694]. Early data suggest a possible association between 
repeated-dose  ketamine  administration  and  hepatobiliary 
adverse events [695]. These studies are important in consid-
ering the repeated use of ketamine in a therapeutic context. 

3.4.6.  Rationale  &  Mechanisms  of  Ketamine  for  PTSD 
Treatment 

3.4.6.1. Therapeutic Rationale of Ketamine for PTSD 

  Multiple  neurobiological  and  psychological  mechanisms 
have been suggested to explain ketamine’s potential efficacy 
as  a  treatment  option  for  PTSD  [263].  These  rationales  are 
predicated  on  hypothetical  assumptions  about  the  nature  of 
PTSD. For example, some have hypothesized that PTSD is a 
“synaptic disconnection syndrome” characterized by damage 
to synaptic connectivity caused by long-term stress exposure 
that  could  play  a  key  role  in  PTSD  neuropathology  [696, 
697].  Furthermore,  neuroimaging  research  has  identified 
associations  between  PTSD  symptoms  and  changes  in  ana-
tomical and functional connectivity [588, 698, 699]. Accord-
ingly,  some  researchers  hypothesize  that  ketamine  admin-
istration  may  reverse  these  structural  changes  through  the 
promotion  of  synaptogenesis  in  the  hippocampus  and  pre-
frontal  cortex  [698].  Ketamine  has  been  demonstrated  to 
induce  synaptic  plasticity  within  hours  post-
rapidly 

administration,  leading  to  measurable  short-term  improve-
ments in core depressive symptoms [700, 701]. 

  A 2021 neuroimaging study [698] evaluated predictors of 
response  and  neuroimaging  correlates  of  ketamine-induced 
PTSD  symptom  improvements  collected  from  participants 
with  PTSD  in  a  repeated-dose  IV  ketamine  vs.  midazolam 
clinical  trial.  The  data  suggest  that  ketamine  promotes  the 
normalization of connectivity changes between brain regions 
observed  to  be  aberrant  in  PTSD.  The  regions  identified 
were the cortical areas of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex 
(vmPFC)  and  dorsal/rostral  anterior  cingulate  cortex 
(d/rACC),  and  the  emotion-processing  areas  of  the  anterior 
section of the insula and the amygdala (Fig. 8). The strongest 
predictor  of  reduced  PTSD  symptoms  was  an  increase  in 
connectivity between the vmPFC and amygdala while view-
ing emotional imagery. These findings align with prior imag-
ing  data  on  neural  regions  associated  with  PTSD  [15],  in-
cluding  that  individuals  with  PTSD  may  demonstrate  re-
duced  activity  in  the  prefrontal  cortex  (PFC)  and  increased 
activity  in  the  amygdala  in  response  to  trauma-related  and 
other  emotional  stimuli.  Differences  in  prefrontal-amygdala 
function  are  connected  with  and  can  predict  resilience  fol-
lowing  exposure  to  trauma,  and  an  increase  in  resting  func-
tional  connectivity  between  the  vmPFC  and  amygdala  has 
been  identified  in  trials  of  prolonged  Exposure  Therapy 
(ET), a common treatment for PTSD [698]. 

  Ketamine may reduce PTSD symptoms via its effects on 
glutamatergic  signaling  (Fig.  7).  Some  evidence  suggests 

 
 
 
688    Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4 

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

that  glutamatergic  signaling  plays  a  key  role  in  important 
aspects of memory processing, including extinction learning 
and  fear  memory  reconsolidation  [263].  This  is  relevant  to 
ketamine’s  potential  therapeutic  benefit,  as  common  symp-
toms of PTSD, such as flashbacks, memory loss, and night-
mares, are all related to memory processing [702]. Data sug-
gest that individuals with PTSD have excessive conditioned 
fear  compared  with  healthy  subjects  when  reacting  to  trau-
matic or aversive stimuli [392]. By modulating the transmis-
sion of glutamate, ketamine might support the processing of 
traumatic memories by diminishing reconsolidation or accel-
erating  fear  extinction  of  emotionally  arousing  events  [240, 
702, 703]. If this is true, then employing psychotherapy with 
ketamine  might  produce  superior  results  when  compared 
with each of these modalities used alone. Ketamine may also 
act  as  a  prophylactic  agent.  Researchers  have  found  that  a 
single  dose  of  ketamine  prior  to  or  following  a  trauma-
simulated  event  (Forced  Swim  Test,  Chronic  Social  Defeat, 
etc.)  in  rats  has  a  protective  effect  against  depressive-like 
behaviors  [704-706].  Animal  studies  have  found  that  keta-
mine  may  reduce  fear  generalization,  depressive  behaviors, 
anxiety,  and  learned  helplessness,  as  well  as  facilitate  fear 
extinction  via  glutamatergic  signaling  and  glutamatergic 
inhibition [652, 705, 707-709]. Ketamine administered up to 
72  hours  prior  to,  or  up  to  6  hours  after,  footshock-stressed 
rats  blocked  the  stress-induced  release  of  glutamate.  When 
ketamine  was  administered  6  hours  after  footshock,  there 
was also a decrease of stress-dependent spontaneous excita-
tory  postsynaptic  current  (sEPSC)  amplitude  in  prelimbic-
PFC. Ketamine administered 6 hours after shock also helped 
apical  dendritic  retraction  of  pyramidal  neurons  caused  by 
stress  in  the  PL-PFC  and  enabled  contextual  fear  extinction 
[708]. Animal studies have found that ketamine may reduce 
fear generalization via glutamatergic signaling [710]. 

  Ketamine  administration  may  also  trigger  a  time  period 
of  improved  neuroplasticity,  thus  increasing  an  individual’s 
responsiveness to psychotherapy and creating the opportuni-
ty  to  strategically  revise  learned  maladaptive  associations 
characteristic of PTSD over an extended period of time, e.g., 
contributing  to  fear  extinction  [698,  711,  712].  This  idea  is 
currently  being  tested  in  an  ongoing  trial  that  includes  a 
trauma therapy intervention following the acute effects of IV 
ketamine  [713].  Stein  and  Simon  postulate  that  coupling 
ketamine administration and deliberate recall of trauma may 
result in stronger and long-lasting effects [643]. 

It  remains  to  be  seen  whether  ketamine’s  psychoactive 
effects  play  a  role  in  its  therapeutic  benefit.  Sensory  distor-
tions,  dissociation,  and  ego  dissolution  produced  by  keta-
mine  administration  have  been  demonstrated  to  impact  pa-
tients’ thoughts, emotions, and perceptions of self and others 
[714,  715].  Accordingly,  these  effects  may  enhance  the  pa-
tient's capacity to process difficult emotions and recall trau-
matic  experiences  [392].  Some  research  has  aimed  to  test 
this  hypothesis  and  has  found  that  ketamine’s  ability  to  in-
duce  “mystical-type”  effects  mediates  its  therapeutic  value 
[644]  in  persons  with  dependence  on  cocaine  and  alcohol 
[716-718].  However,  this  hypothesis  has  not  been  verified. 
The extent to which the subjective effects of the compound, 
rather  than  the  pharmacologic  effects,  constitute  the  active 
component of healing remains an open question in the field 
of psychedelic therapy. Nonetheless, if true, ketamine could 

serve  as  an  adjunct  tool  to  enhance  psychotherapy  [719]. 
Further  research  is  required  to  better  understand  the  role  of 
subjective  psychoactive  effects  induced  by  ketamine  and 
other  psychedelics,  and  in  particular  their  unique  ability  to 
engender  mystical-type  experiences,  as  they  relate  to  their 
therapeutic efficacy [644, 720]. 

3.4.7. Evidence Involving Ketamine for PTSD Treatment 

3.4.7.1. Evidence Supporting Ketamine in the Treatment of 
PTSD and PTSD-Related Disorders 

In  recent  years,  the  study  of  ketamine  as  a  therapeutic 
treatment  for  psychiatric  indications  has  expanded  into 
PTSD (Table 7). This line of research is still relatively new. 
Current evidence suggests that ketamine can lead to a rapid 
reduction in PTSD symptoms, either alone or in combination 
with other treatments such as trauma-focused psychotherapy 
[240,  645,  642,  721-723].  However,  it  is  important  to  note 
that  some  studies  have  produced  contradictory  findings 
[724].  Ketamine  may  also  be  effective  in  treating  disorders 
that  are  commonly  comorbid  with  PTSD.  Esketamine  has 
been  approved  by  the  FDA  for  the  treatment  of  treatment-
resistant depression (TRD) [725]. 

It  is  not  yet  clear  to  what  extent  the  treatment  gains  in-
duced by ketamine can be sustained over time. Clinical trials 
suggest that ketamine’s therapeutic effects are transient, last-
ing from a few days to 14 days following a single dose in the 
treatment  of  depression  [637].  It  is  possible  that  repeat  ad-
ministration  may  extend  ketamine’s  therapeutic  effects:  one 
study evaluating patients with chronic PTSD reported that 6 
ketamine  infusions  over  2  weeks  can  lead  to  a  reduction  in 
PTSD  symptoms,  with  a  median  loss  of  response  at  27.5 
days [711]. Given the evidence of transient treatment gains, 
repeat  ketamine  administration  is  typically  necessary  to  ex-
tend  therapeutic  benefits  [637].  For  example,  the  current 
FDA-approved  esketamine  dosing  framework  for  the  treat-
ment of depression begins with administration twice weekly 
before  tapering  to  weekly  or  biweekly  maintenance  doses; 
there is presently no maximum length of treatment duration 
specified [637, 726]. The limited duration of ketamine's ther-
apeutic effects is a potential area of concern and one way in 
which  MDMA  may  have  an  advantage  in  treating  PTSD. 
Studies  suggest  that  the  effects  of  MDMA-assisted  therapy 
are  typically  longer-lasting  [28]  compared  with  ketamine, 
although  the  two  treatments  have  not  been  compared  in 
head-to-head trials at the time of publication. 

3.4.7.2. Treatment of PTSD using Ketamine 

In a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial (RCT), 
patients with chronic PTSD received a single IV infusion of 
ketamine  hydrochloride  (0.5  mg/kg)  or  midazolam  (0.045 
mg/kg).  Midazolam  is  often  used  as  a  control  condition  in 
ketamine studies because it is an anesthetic agent that has sim-
ilar pharmacokinetic properties [727, 728]. Though an inactive 
placebo could decrease the likelihood of neurological activity 
that  impacts  the  comparison  between  conditions,  the  use  of 
midazolam allows for similar behavioral effects to those of the 
ketamine  condition,  improving  blinding  procedures  and 
comparative analyses. Ketamine was well tolerated by PTSD 
patients  and  was  associated  with  a  rapid  and  significant  re-
duction  in  core  PTSD  symptoms,  with  benefits  lasting

beyond 24 hours [642]  (Table 7). Following this trial, Feder 
et  al.  [723]    explored  the  efficacy  of  a  repeat  IV  ketamine 
infusion  model;  participants  [723]  with  chronic  PTSD  re-
ceived  6  infusions  of  either  ketamine  or  midazolam  over  2 
consecutive  weeks  (Table  7).  The  ketamine  group  demon-
strated  rapid  and  significant  clinical  improvement  in  PTSD 
symptoms,  including  improvements  in  3  out  of  the  4  PTSD 
clusters: intrusions, avoidance, and negative changes in cog-
nition and mood. These results were assessed 24 hours after 
the  first  infusion  and  persisted  for  a  median  of  27.5  days. 
The effect size at week 1 was d=0.85, with a 95% confidence 
interval  (CI)  ranging  from  0.10  to  1.59.  The  effect  size  at 
week 2 was d=1.13, with a 95% CI ranging from 0.36 to 1.91 
[723] (Table 7). 

  The  largest  study  to  examine  PTSD  symptoms  in  veter-
ans and active-duty personnel is a 4-week double-blind, ran-
domized controlled trial (RCT) with three study arms: place-
bo  (normal  saline),  low-dose  ketamine  infusion  (0.2mg/kg), 
and standard-dose ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg)  (Table 7). 
158 participants with PTSD symptoms were randomized to a 
treatment group [27, 724]. In contrast to the aforementioned 
findings  by  Feder  et  al.  [723],  this  study  did  not  identify  a 
dose-related  effect  of  ketamine  treatment  on  PTSD  symp-
toms [723, 724]. Abdallah et al. hypothesize that the differ-
ing effect on PTSD symptoms may be related to population 
(veterans  vs.  civilians),  sex  differences  (the  current  study 
was  primarily  male),  or  sample  size  (previous  studies  had 
smaller N) [724]. Notably, on secondary analyses, the stand-
ard ketamine dose cohort saw antidepressant effects after the 
first dose, whereas the low-dose ketamine group experienced 
reduced depressive symptoms by the end of the 4-week fol-
low-up. These findings suggest a possible progressive effect 
of repeated low-dose ketamine infusions in depression [724].  

toms,  while  substance  abuse  did  not  significantly  decrease 
[729]  (Table  7).  Similarly,  Albott  et  al.  [730]  reported  in  a 
smaller, open-label study that 6 IV ketamine infusions of 0.5 
mg/kg ketamine administered over a 12-day period in veter-
ans with comorbid treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and 
PTSD (N=15) significantly reduced symptoms of both disor-
ders  24  hours  after  the  final  infusion  [730].  The  remission 
rate of PTSD was 80%, with a median time to relapse of 41 
days [730]. 

  While most preliminary investigations on the efficacy of 
ketamine in treating PTSD have produced encouraging find-
ings, further research is essential to confirm these effects and 
identify underlying mechanisms and the most effective ther-
apeutic  approach  for  this  patient  population  [643,  702].  In 
their  review,  Liriano  and  colleagues  found  evidence  that 
ketamine  may  achieve  complete  resolution  of  symptoms  in 
PTSD,  similar  to  its  therapeutic  benefit  and  resolution  of 
symptoms  found  in  MDD  [702].  Stein  and  Simon  also  pro-
pose  the  need  for  more  research  with  deliberate  recall  of 
traumatic  events  paired  with  ketamine  administration  in  or-
der  to  study  the  lasting  effects  of  these  treatments  [643]. 
Overall, evidence suggests that ketamine may be an effective 
treatment  for  PTSD,  but  these  studies  have  not  been  con-
ducted  in  the  context  of  the  traditional  set  and  setting  for 
psychedelic-assisted therapies. There have been contradicto-
ry  results  in  its  effectiveness  for  PTSD,  namely  within  the 
veteran population, as found in the largest trial to date, which 
failed to identify significant dose-related effects of ketamine 
on PTSD  [27, 724, 729]. It remains to be determined wheth-
er  ketamine  can  produce  consistent  therapeutic  effects,  and 
more research is needed to confirm the efficacy, dosage, and 
maintenance  schedule  of  ketamine  in  individuals  with  vary-
ing types of PTSD. 

In  an  observational  study  of  30  U.S.  military  veterans 
with  combat-related  PTSD,  a  series  of  six  1-hour  ketamine 
infusions  began  at  1  mg/kg  with  the  goal  of  achieving  a 
transpersonal dissociative experience. The study found clini-
cally  significant  reductions  in  PTSD  and  depression  symp-

Studies [731-733] suggest that augmenting ketamine ad-
ministration  with  psychotherapy  or  other  trauma-informed 
interventions could prolong its therapeutic benefit in treating 
PTSD. The treatment models investigated in these trials have 
been  highly  variable,  ranging  from  Exposure  Therapy  (ET)

[731]  to  Mindfulness-Based  Extinction  and  Reconsolidation 
Therapy  [733].  All  noted  studies  reported  significant  de-
creases  in  PTSD  symptoms  on  both  the  CAPS  and  PCL 
measures  [731,  733].  Pradhan  et  al.  found  that  ketamine 
combined with a mindfulness-based trauma intervention im-
proved symptoms and duration of response [733]. It is worth 
noting that a significant proportion of clinical trials currently 
listed on ClinicalTrials.gov are exploring the use of ketamine 
in  conjunction  with  psychotherapy  or  other  interventions, 
signifying  a  possible  shift  in  the  direction  of  research  to-
wards  extending  the  duration  of  sustained  response  [713, 
734, 735]. 

4. PSYCHEDELICS FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIS-
ORDERS THAT CO-OCCUR WITH PTSD 

  The  development  of  abnormal  psychological  issues  is 
often precipitated by stress or traumatic experiences. There-
fore, pinpointing distinct causality behind diagnoses can be-
come difficult since PTSD may develop in conjunction with 
other conditions such as anxiety or major depressive disorder 
(MDD). It is thus suggestive of the possibility that the same 
antecedent  brought  about  the  entirety  of  the  distressful  psy-
chological reaction. The presence of more than one diagnosis 
may  not  reflect  comorbidity  in  the  same  sense  that  it  has 
been  defined  historically.  Rather,  the  multiple  diagnosable 
entities that result may be an occurrence of symptom overlap 
or could, in fact, be illustrative of not only the complexity of 
symptoms associated with PTSD but also the inadequacy in 
being  able  to  fully  encompass  a  regulated  understanding  of 
one’s  psychological  reaction  to  the  event.  Current  research 
and studies explored in this paper seek to uncover treatments 
for  PTSD  and  its  “comorbidities”  by  means  of  addressing 
symptom overlap. However, additional and future investiga-
tions  should  consider  cases  in  which  mental  illness  specifi-
cally preceded trauma exposure. This would present a situa-
tion where different conditions have developed out of differ-
ent etiologies, and thus, PAP’s true transdiagnostic capabili-
ties could be elucidated.  

  The nature of psychedelic mechanisms of action has giv-
en  rise  to  theories  regarding  the  treatments  as  broadly  im-
pactful for psychological suffering rather than as specific to a 
particular diagnosis.  However, to the extent that psychedelic 
medicines are effective because they allow the processing of 
traumatic  antecedents  of  mental  health  symptoms,  this  dis-
tinction would be rather trivial. In determining the possibility 
of  a  transdiagnostic  application  of  psychedelic  therapy,  the 
question  arises  as  to  whether  the  treatment  acts  on  shared 
factors in the development and maintenance of various diag-
noses.  Indeed,  inflexibility  in  cognitive,  behavioral,  and 
emotional processing has been associated with a broad range 
of psychopathology and diagnostic presentations. More spe-
cifically, psychological inflexibility is associated with rumi-
nation  and  negative  self-focus,  canalization  or  resistance  to 
change, and fear or avoidance of new experiences, which are 
in  turn  associated  with  broad  psychological  distress  as  well 
as  mood,  anxiety,  addiction,  obsessive-compulsive  disorder, 
and  personality  disorders  [273,  736].  Psychedelic  medica-
tions  have  been  demonstrated  to  increase  neurological  plas-
ticity and psychological flexibility, providing potential path-
ways for mitigating this pathological inflexibility and result-
ant maladaptive processes.    

  To date, MDMA is the only psychedelic drug with a ro-
bust  research  base  on  the  treatment  of  PTSD.  However,  the 
other  psychedelics  covered  in  this  review  paper,  including 
MDMA,  have  been  utilized  in  research  trials  for  the  treat-
ment of diagnoses that commonly co-occur with PTSD (Ta-
ble 8). Given the frequency with which PTSD appears to co-
occur with other psychological difficulties, it is important to 
consider how the co-occurring disorders may influence each 
other, as well as how treatment of PTSD with a psychedelic 
substance might impact, or be impacted by, a secondary di-
agnosis. 

4.1. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)   

  MDD  and  PTSD  are  closely  related  disorders  that  share 
many  clinical  and  neurobiological  features  [137].  The  con-
nection  between  trauma  and  MDD  has  been  well  debated 
with  respect  to  whether  their  co-occurrence  really  reflects 
two  distinct  conditions.  However,  there  is  no  question  that 
associations  between  childhood  trauma  and  MDD,  anxiety, 
and  PTSD  have  been  demonstrated  [737-740].  MDD  is  the 
most common comorbidity of PTSD [741] because so many 
of  the  symptoms  of  PTSD  and  MDD  overlap.  Furthermore, 
PTSD and MDD share associated risk factors and treatments  
[742-746]. Studies have been conducted for the treatment of 
depression using psilocybin, ayahuasca, and ketamine (Table 
8),  with  studies  of  LSD  employing  secondary  measures  of 
depressive  symptoms.  In  most  of  these  studies,  secondary 
PTSD was not examined or discussed. To date, MDMA has 
not been sufficiently explored for the treatment of MDD. 

  The  neurobiological  effects  of  psychedelics  have  been 
hypothesized to support the treatment of MDD. For example, 
the  Default  Mode  Network  (DMN)  is  associated  with  com-
mon  symptoms  of  depression,  such  as  maladaptive  rumina-
tion  and  negative  thoughts  and  emotions.  LSD,  psilocybin, 
and  ayahuasca  have  all  been  correlated  with  changes  in 
DMN  activity  associated  with  reductions  in  negative  cogni-
tive and emotional biases [747]. In addition, decreased blood 
levels of BDNF have been found in individuals with MDD; 
thus, the increase of this factor following the use of psyche-
delics  may  play  a  role  in  ameliorating  the  symptoms  of 
MDD  and  increasing  neuroplasticity  [747].  The  increased 
proinflammatory signaling that is characteristic of depression 
may  be  mitigated  by  the  anti-inflammatory  effects  of  psy-
chedelics [512]. Aligned with those changes, increased psy-
chological  flexibility  is  likely  to  attenuate  the  cognitive  and 
behavioral  rigidity  that  can  be  associated  with  depression 
[273]. Additionally, reduced functional connectivity between 
the  right  amygdala  and  the  vmPFC  as  well  as  the  vmPFC 
and the occipital and parietal lobes; changes in the functional 
connectivity  of  the  vmPFC  and  mPFC;  and  decreased  brain 
modularity have all been associated with treatment response 
in  psychedelic-assisted  psychotherapy  for  depression  [748]. 
The use of serotonergic psychedelics is also associated with 
prosocial  behavior;  the  ego-dissolution  effect  is  a  potential 
mitigator of common difficulties in social functioning expe-
rienced by individuals with depressive disorders [747]. 

Initial, non-randomized clinical trials found psilocybin to 
be  effective  in  the  treatment  of  MDD  [749,  750]  (Table  8), 
and  RCTs  followed  that  demonstrated  significantly  lower 
scores on depression measures for individuals who received

psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, both immediately follow-
ing  treatment  and  at  1-year  follow-up  [500,  551]  (Table  8). 
Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy was demonstrated to be as 
efficacious  for  MDD  as  escitalopram,  an  FDA-approved 
first-line  treatment  for  depression  [499].  Though  no  studies 
directly  examining  the  effects  of  LSD  on  MDD  have  been 
conducted,  secondary  measures  in  studies  on  LSD-assisted 
psychotherapy  have  found  significant  decreases  in  depres-
sion  [455].  Recent  research  on  ayahuasca,  in  turn,  has  indi-
cated  rapid  and  long-acting  antidepressant  and  anxiolytic 
effects  [453,  555,  625,  626].  Open-label  trials  have  demon-
strated significant decreases in depression, sustained up to 21 
days following one oral dose of ayahuasca [555, 626]. These 

findings were replicated in a parallel-arm, double-blind, ran-
domized,  placebo-controlled  trial  of  29  patients  with  treat-
ment-resistant depression (TRD) [453]. While trauma history 
may affect outcomes in MDD treatments, unfortunately, the 
trauma  status  of  participants  in  these  studies  is  unknown. 
Ketamine  also  modifies  glutamatergic  neurotransmission 
(Fig.  7),  as  well  as  modulates  dopaminergic  neurotransmis-
sion, serotonergic neurotransmission, and hippocampal plas-
ticity. These mechanisms are all thought to mediate its anti-
depressant  properties  [751-754],  as  depression  is  hypothe-
sized to be caused in part by increased subcortical and limbic 
activity,  changes  in  glutamatergic  neurotransmission,  and 
resting state network dysfunction activity [751].

  A  growing  body  of  literature  has  reported  ketamine’s 
antidepressant  properties  (Table  8).  One  study  investigated 
the  remedial  effects  of  very  low-dose  sublingual  (VLDS) 
ketamine  given  every  2-3  days  or  weekly  in  patients  with 
persistent depression and found that therapeutic effects were 
reported, improving mood levels with only mild side effects 
[755, 756]. Another study found that low doses of ketamine 
(0.5  mg/kg)  were  more  effective  in  reducing  depression 
symptoms than very low doses (0.1-0.4 mg/kg) [757]. 

4.2. Addiction  

Substance use disorder (SUD) is a common comorbidity 
of  PTSD,  with  alcohol  use  disorder  (AUD)  being  the  most 
common comorbid SUD in people with PTSD [185]. In addi-
tion, studies have confirmed that patients with substance use 
disorders also often report a prior history of trauma; in par-
ticular,  traumatization  that  occurs  in  childhood  has  been 
found  to  significantly  correlate  with  the  development  of 
SUDs among civilian populations [758, 759]. This phenom-
enon suggests that the use of substances is often viewed as a 
means of self-medication as a potential escape or remedy to 
the  trauma  [760].  As  an  early  area  of  study  for  psychedelic 
intervention,  there  has  been  significant  exploration  of  the 
effects  of  psychedelics  on  substance  use  and  addiction  (Ta-
ble  8).  This  has  primarily  utilized  classic  psychedelics,  but 
with  initial  studies  for  MDMA-assisted  therapy  (MDMA-
AT)  and  ketamine  treatment  for  alcohol  and  substance  use 
disorders, the field is continuing to expand.   

In  particular,  the  mesolimbic  dopaminergic  system  has 
been hypothesized as a key factor in addictive behavior; past 
research  has  established  that  5-HT2A  receptors  are  found  on 
multiple  structures  in  this  system  and  that  the  activation  of 
these  receptors  (as  through  the  use  of  classic  psychedelics) 
can significantly impact dopaminergic activity, as can direct 
activation of the D1 and D2 receptors (as seen in the use of 
LSD)  [761].  The  activation  of  5-HT2A  receptors  also  modu-
lates activity in the DMN, a system hypothesized to mediate 
internal processes associated with cravings, rumination, neg-
ative emotions, and self-awareness and appraisal [761]. This 
allows  for  both  greater  insight  into  self  and  addiction  and 
increased  bottom-up  processing  [736,  761].  It  appears  that 
this increased cognitive flexibility, particularly compounded 
with  the  mystical-type  experiences  common  in  psychedelic 
use, correlates with decreased cravings for and use of addic-
tive substances [736, 761]. In addition to the involvement of 
the DMN, decreased connectivity in the prefrontal/executive 
network has been reported in chronic users of cocaine, hero-
in,  and  nicotine.  Normalization  of  these  pathogenic  connec-
tivity patterns is hypothesized to be a mechanism for reduc-
ing craving and withdrawal symptoms [762].  

Preliminary research has supported the possibility of such 
efficacy  of  classic  psychedelics  in  the  treatment  of  AUD 
(Table  8).  An  open-label  trial  of  psilocybin  administered  in 
the  context  of  motivational  enhancement  therapy  demon-
strated a significant reduction in self-reported drinking days 
and heavy drinking days [763]. A double-blind RCT expand-
ed  on  this  finding,  demonstrating  that  the  percentage  of 
heavy drinking days was significantly less for the psilocybin 
group  compared  with  a  diphenhydramine  group  [498].  A 
systematic  review  of  randomized  controlled  clinical  trials 

(RCTs)  for  the  use  of  LSD,  in  turn,  examined  seven  trials 
utilizing LSD for the treatment of AUD [423]. Though these 
studies  were  conducted  in  the  1960s  and  ‘70s,  they  were 
reportedly  of  high  quality  as  assessed  by  the  reviewers;  of 
the  7  studies,  all  showed  significant  improvements,  though 
only  4  found  statistically  significant  differences  between 
LSD and placebo groups. Preclinical and observational trials 
of ayahuasca and its alkaloids have also demonstrated poten-
tial therapeutic effects in SUDs [764]. Trials have found sus-
tained and significant reductions in alcohol use and psychiat-
ric  disorder  severity  at  12-month  follow-up  compared  with 
controls  [765],  and  improvements  in  self-reported  alcohol, 
tobacco,  and  cocaine  use  up  to  6  months  post-retreat,  with 
statistically  significant  improvements  in  hopefulness,  em-
powerment,  mindfulness,  and  quality  of  life  meaning  and 
outlook subscales [766]. A retrospective study of adolescents 
in  the  União  do  Vegetal  (UDV)  religious  community  also 
found  decreased  past-year  alcohol  use  in  adolescent  aya-
huasca  users  compared  with  non-users,  though  results  were 
not statistically significant, and religious affiliation may have 
played a protective role in observed decreased pattern of use 
[767].  These  findings  have  been  supported  by  qualitative 
analyses  in  which  users  have  reported  that  ayahuasca  helps 
reduce  harmful  patterns  of  drug  use,  promotes  abstinence, 
and supports the identification of the causes and psychologi-
cal  consequences  of  their  addiction  [425,  767-769].  While 
these trials are limited by their small sample sizes, and some 
lack  control  groups,  they  indicate  that  ayahuasca  may  im-
prove  psychological,  cognitive,  and  behavioral  measures 
related to SUDs and warrant further investigation. 

  While  MDMA-assisted  therapy  (MDMA-AT)  has  been 
primarily studied in the context of PTSD, early research into 
the  effects  of  this  treatment  on  AUD  has  been  promising 
(Table  8),  with  initial  participants  in  an  open-label  study 
reporting  abstinence  or  single  episodes  of  low  alcohol  use, 
and no serious adverse psychological events [770]. Ketamine 
has  also  shown  promising  results  in  AUD  and  other  sub-
stance  abuse  disorders  and  may  address  gaps  in  addiction 
treatment [751]. It is thought that ketamine may affect down-
stream  effects  on  connectivity  and  plasticity  through  neu-
rotrophic  factors  to  increase  dopamine  (DA)  signaling,  thus 
improving  drug-related  synaptic  deficiencies  [751].  Keta-
mine has been demonstrated to increase the number of absti-
nent days more than placebo, with ketamine combined with 
therapy showing the greatest efficacy [771]. Effects may be 
long-lasting,  with  three  infusions  of  ketamine  associated 
with  fewer  days  of  alcohol  use  at  the  6-month  follow-up  of 
this  study,  while  a  second  study  demonstrated  that  after  a 
year, relapse rates were much lower in patients who received 
intramuscular  (IM)  ketamine  treatments  [715].  Ketamine 
may  also  improve  short-term  withdrawal  symptoms  in  opi-
oid-dependent patients [772], and prevent relapse in cocaine-
dependent  patients  [773].  Additionally,  ketamine  has  been 
found to increase abstinence rates in heroin users at 2 years, 
suggesting a dose-dependent model for treatment [774]. 

4.3.  Anxiety  Associated  with  Life-Threatening  Illness/ 
End-of-Life Anxiety   

  Anxiety related to a life-threatening illness or end-of-life 
is a construct distinct from PTSD, but it may be reflective of 
trauma-related  distress;  it  is  common  for  people  with  such 

 
 
 
The Psychedelic Future of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    695 

experiences  to  have  intrusive  thoughts,  anxious  reactions, 
depression,  and  other  PTSD-like  symptoms  [190].  Initial 
studies have been conducted assessing the effects of psilocy-
bin, LSD, and MDMA on state and trait anxiety in individu-
als with anxiety related to life-threatening illnesses. To date, 
ketamine has not been well studied to treat anxiety. 

Psychedelic  mechanisms  of  action  have  been  hypothe-
sized  to  address  the  most  commonly  identified  preferences 
related  to  end-of-life  care:  pain  management,  connection  to 
others, and finding a sense of meaning [775]. The analgesic 
effects  of  psychedelics  [776]  may  help  to  alleviate  physical 
pain  with  fewer  negative  side  effects  than  traditional  pallia-
tive pharmacotherapies [775]. The “mystical-type experienc-
es'' common in psychedelic use [266, 273, 736] can enhance 
the well-being of patients with life-threatening diagnoses and 
specifically  help  to  address  religious,  spiritual,  and  existen-
tial  concerns  [775].  Similarly, 
the  concepts  of  ego-
dissolution and interconnectedness with the environment and 
other people [266] could theoretically help to ease the isola-
tion  experienced  by  many  in  palliative  care;  such  concepts 
are also related to changes in cognitive flexibility and social 
processing systems that may enhance coping skills and feel-
ings of connectedness while decreasing rumination and isola-
tion [736], which in turn can mitigate symptoms of anxiety, 
depression,  and  demoralization  related  to  death  and  dying 
[775].  

  A meta-analysis examined changes in trait and state anxi-
ety  following  psilocybin  administration  in  individuals  diag-
nosed with life-threatening illnesses. This analysis found that 
psilocybin  therapy  was  associated  with  significant  and  sus-
tained  improvement  in  trait  anxiety  and  significant,  though 
time-limited, improvement in state anxiety [777]. The use of 
LSD  for  individuals  experiencing  anxiety  related  to  a  life-
threatening illness was proposed due to the enhancing effects 
on  affect,  meaning-making,  and  ego  dissolution  that  occurs 
[778].  A  pilot  study  found  that  while  trait  anxiety  did  not 
significantly decrease following LSD use, the placebo group 
had increased levels of trait anxiety; at 12-month follow-up, 
there were sustained trait and state anxiety changes in those 
who  received  LSD.  A  qualitative  analysis  of  this  study  re-
ported that all participants endorsed benefits from the use of 
LSD,  and  participants  reported  perceptions  of  changes  in 
themselves such as increased openness, deepened awareness, 
as  well  as  increased  relaxation  and  patience  with  self  and 
others.  Reports  from  participants  illustrate  experiences  of 
intense, cathartic emotional expressions, shifts in perception 
of self and others, changes in emotional state from negative 
to  deeply  positive,  and  reported  sustained  shifts  in  perspec-
tives, attitudes, and values. While participants did not report 
enduring negative effects from the treatment, there was some 
acknowledgment  of  difficulties  with  the  process  and  the  in-
tensity of emotions, though these intensely emotional experi-
ences  were  also  reported  to  be  the  most  moving  subjective 
experiences of the treatment [778]. 

Finally,  a  placebo-controlled  study  of  MDMA-assisted 
therapy (MDMA-AT) found that there was a non-significant 
decrease in trait anxiety among those who received MDMA, 
but  the  researchers  note  that  if  one  extreme  outlier  in  the 
placebo group were removed, these results would be signifi-
cant. This study employed a crossover design and found sig-

nificant reductions in trait and state anxiety, depression, and 
fear  of  death,  with  improvements  in  sleep  quality,  global 
functioning,  physical  and  emotional  well-being,  and  daily 
coping mechanisms [190]. 

4.4. Chronic Pain 

PTSD and chronic pain have high comorbidity rates, with 
multiple  theories  proposed  as  potentially  underlying  this 
relationship. Such theories relate to the interactions between 
trauma  and  pain  cues,  and  ways  in  which  responses  to  one 
might  exacerbate  the  other;  examples  include  avoidance  of 
physically  painful  activities  potentially  preventing  fear  ex-
tinction,  pain  acting  as  a  trauma  reminder,  and  increased 
perception  of  physical  or  emotional  pain  reciprocally  in-
creasing the other [779, 780]. In particular, anxiety sensitivi-
ty  has  been  highlighted  as  a  potential  connection  between 
these diagnoses due to the predisposition to a disproportion-
ate  level  of  alertness  and  alarm  [191,  780].    Medicinal  pain 
management  strategies  are  often  focused  on  alleviating  the 
symptom rather than the underlying cause of pain [781], lim-
iting  their  efficacy  in  the  long  term,  while  psychotherapies 
and techniques such as deep brain stimulation are aimed to-
ward  higher-level  systems  involved  in  the  processing  and 
perception of pain [781]. 

  Though no studies on MDMA for chronic pain have been 
conducted, a secondary analysis of participants in a Phase II 
trial  of  MDMA  for  PTSD  found  statistically  significant  re-
ductions in pain following MDMA-AT, including the inten-
sity and severity of pain as well as disability score. However, 
these reductions were only significant for participants in the 
highest  of  3  pain  clusters;  the  medium  cluster  only  demon-
strated significant decreases in pain intensity, and there were 
no  significant  results  for  the  low  cluster.  Researchers  hy-
pothesized that this discrepancy may be due to more oppor-
tunities  for  improvement  for  individuals  with  higher  pain 
scores [782].  

5-HT  pathways  are  involved  in  the  transmission  of  pain 
signals,  and  given  the  activity  of  classic  psychedelics  on 
5HT2A  receptors,  they  have  been  hypothesized  as  potential 
interventions for chronic pain [783].  The altered functional 
connectivity  (FC)  in  the  brain  following  the  use  of  classic 
psychedelics may impact pain responses as well as the over-
all  perception  of  pain  [783],  and  this  process  may  help  to 
address the changes in FC found in individuals with chronic 
pain as a result of the duration and intensity of the sustained 
pain [776]. Additionally, the mediation of descending inhibi-
tory  5-HT  pathways  potentially  influences  the  transmission 
of pain signals, and the activation of 5-HT2A neurons in the 
dorsal  root  ganglia  potentially  reduces  inflammation-based 
pain responses [776]. 

  While  healthy  volunteers  have  demonstrated  decreased 
pain  perception  and  increased  pain  tolerance  following  the 
use  of  LSD  [784],  fewer  studies  have  specifically  looked  at 
the impact of classic psychedelics on chronic pain. However, 
a survey of 250 individuals living with chronic pain indicat-
ed that both macro- and microdoses of psychedelic substanc-
es led to greater perceived pain relief than conventional med-
ications, and macrodoses were significantly more effective at 
relieving pain than microdoses and had a significantly long-
er-lasting  effect.  These  effects  were  still  apparent  when  re-

 
 
 
 
696    Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4 

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

searchers limited their analyses to only the use of psilocybin 
and  LSD.  Notably,  for  those  who  used  macrodoses,  the  in-
tention  of  the  user  did  not  have  an  impact  on  the  level  of 
perceived  pain  relief;  however,  for  those  who  microdosed, 
only those who intentionally used the substance for pain re-
lief  experienced  efficacy  greater  than  conventional  medica-
tions [785]. 

In a meta-analysis of 40 papers, it was found that IV ket-
amine  significantly  reduced  chronic  pain  occurrence  after 
certain  surgeries  [786].  It  is  thought  that  when  given  in-
traoperatively, ketamine reduces primary and secondary hy-
peralgesia  postoperatively,  which  decreases  the  chance  of 
chronic pain developing [787]. There is also evidence show-
ing  ketamine’s  effectiveness  in  reducing  chronic  noncancer 
pain  [788].  Orhurhu  et  al.  [789]  conducted  a  systematic  re-
view and found that IV ketamine’s short-term analgesic ben-
efits in chronic pain patients tend to occur in a dose-response 
relationship.  High  doses  over  a  shorter  period  of  time  seem 
to be more effective in reducing pain versus lower doses for 
longer durations [788]. Oral ketamine has also been found to 
be  safe  and  has  been  used  as  a  replacement  for  opioids  in 
patients with chronic pain [790]. One study found that 44% 
of patients had a resolution of pain after oral ketamine treat-
ment  [791].  Ketamine’s  effectiveness  in  reducing  chronic 
pain  is  very  promising  because,  of  the  currently  available 
treatments, only ~30-40% of patients achieve relief [792]. 

5. FUTURE DIRECTIONS 

5.1.  Considerations  for  Psychedelic-Assisted  Psychother-
apy Adoption: Cost Analysis  

  A growing base of evidence is intended to determine the 
safety and potential efficacy of MDMA-AT for the treatment 
of PTSD. However, as the typical treatment protocol is cur-
rently  designed,  MDMA-AT  requires  a  cumulative  ~42 
hours of psychotherapy with two trained therapists [40, 282, 
793]. Thus, considering cost-effectiveness and overall poten-
tial accessibility is crucial to understanding its utility in men-
tal health care systems as this treatment paradigm approach-
es  FDA  approval.  Cost-effectiveness  analysis  has  been  per-
formed  on  the  six  MAPS  Phase  II  clinical  trials  [794],  and, 
more  recently,  on  the  two  MAPS  Phase  III  clinical  trials 
[795],  each  of  which  involved  two  experimental  sessions. 
Such  analyses  have  determined  the  intervention  to  be  cost-
effective if one considers the cost of treating chronic PTSD, 
potentially  saving  third-party  healthcare  payers  $103.2  mil-
lion  in  combined  mental  health  and  general  medical  care 
costs over 30 years per 1,000 patients. Furthermore, the costs 
of  a  single  trial  (~3  months  of  concentrated  therapy)  would 
be equivalent to 3.1 years of traditional reimbursable health 
care.  The  analysis  also  estimated  that  42.9  undiscounted 
deaths  would  be  averted,  and  5,553  discounted  quality-
adjusted  life  years  (QALYs)  would  be  generated  [794]. 
Analyses  of  the  Phase  III  clinical  trial  data,  which  adds  a 
third experimental session with MDMA, similarly found that 
MDMA-AT  is  cost-effective  and  cost-saving  from  a  payer 
perspective [795]. The authors found that over 30 years, sav-
ings  would  approximate  a  discounted  $132.9  million  while 
averting  61.4  premature  deaths  and  generating  4,856  dis-
counted  QALYs.  MDMA-AT  would  break  even  on  costs  at 
3.8 years based on this analysis [795]. These numbers sound 

compelling  for  payers  and  the  healthcare  system;  however, 
they  are  based  on  data  from  patients  who  have  access  to  or 
receive  chronic  care.  In  contrast,  many  patients  with  PTSD 
do  not  seek  care  and/or  have  difficulty  accessing  mental 
health  treatment  [796,  797].  The  analysis  does  not  explore 
the effect that such a labor-intensive therapy would have on 
access to mental health care at large within the context of the 
current  labor  pool.  Furthermore,  the  results  assume  that  pa-
tients being treated with psychedelics will not show a recru-
descence of symptoms and will remain without mental health 
needs. Long-term studies have not been conducted to justify 
this assumption, though as more long-term follow-up studies 
are reported, the accuracy of this potentiality should be test-
ed. 

  As discussed, research evaluating the use of classic psy-
chedelics  such  as  psilocybin,  LSD,  and  ayahuasca  in  the 
treatment  of  PTSD  remains  nascent.  Should  classic  psyche-
delic-assisted  psychotherapy  prove  to  be  comparable  to 
MDMA-AT in treating PTSD, perhaps its cost-effectiveness 
could  be  extrapolated  from  the  analyses  performed  on 
MDMA-AT  above,  as  the  general  treatment  model  and  re-
quired  therapist  hours  would  be  similar,  except  for  LSD, 
which  has  a  duration  of  action  approximately  twice  that 
[510]  of  MDMA  [333].  One  of  the  important  unanswered 
questions  about  psychedelic-assisted  psychotherapy  is  the 
durability of its effects, and until this is known for each sub-
stance,  it  is  difficult  to  perform  cost-benefit  analyses.  The 
up-front costs of these concentrated therapies are high, which 
may pose a barrier for many and might also affect equitable 
access. 

  The  cost  consideration  of  Spravato,  the  FDA-approved 
esketamine nasal spray,  has been evaluated in the treatment 
of major depressive disorder (MDD), with costs estimated to 
be as high as $4,720 to $6,785 in the initial month of therapy 
and a range of $2,360 to $3,540 for subsequent maintenance 
monthly therapy [798]. These costs have led the Institute for 
Clinical  and  Economic  Review  (ICER)  to  determine  that 
Spravato delivers a low value for its cost.  Consequently, the 
United Kingdom (UK) National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) has refused to endorse Spravato as a re-
imbursable  drug  [798].  However,  the  numbers  are  based  on 
the  administration  of  ketamine  as  a  pharmacotherapeutic  in 
the  absence  of  psychotherapy.  It  has  been  suggested  that 
ketamine may open a temporary window of increased neuro-
plasticity  during  which  the  efficacy  of  psychotherapeutic 
interventions may be enhanced [711, 712, 799]. Thus, it will 
be important to perform studies of ketamine-assisted psycho-
therapy to determine whether treatment gains with ketamine 
are more enduring when psychotherapy is added. Initial data 
from  analyses  of  KAP  in  clinical  settings  suggest  that  psy-
chotherapy  provided  before,  during,  and  after  ketamine  ses-
sions  could  maximize  and  prolong  benefits  [645].  As  keta-
mine’s duration of action is short in comparison with that of 
psychedelics  [800],  this  may  reduce  the  therapist  hours  re-
quired for KAP, potentially serving as a more cost-effective 
treatment    [798].  However,  these  conclusions  are  entirely 
speculative,  and  further  investigations  involving  RCTs  are 
required to better characterize this possibility. 

  With currently available drug therapies for PTSD, ~50% 
of PTSD patients do not respond meaningfully [230]. Many 

 
The Psychedelic Future of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4    697 

patients  similarly  fail  to  respond,  remain  symptomatic,  or 
demonstrate  high  rates  of  dropout  following  engagement  in 
current  gold-standard  psychological  treatments  for  PTSD, 
such  as  prolonged  exposure  and  CPT  [40,  801,  802]. 
MDMA-AT  has  thus  far  been  evaluated  for  severe  and  ex-
treme  PTSD  [333],  but  future  research  should  also  assess 
whether  this  treatment  is  effective  for  PTSD  with  moderate 
severity in comparison with other treatment modalities. 

5.2.  Increasing  Generalizability  of  Psychedelic  Research 
Treatment Access 

  The  scalability  of  psychedelic-assisted  psychotherapy 
(PAP) will be an important area of exploration for any treat-
ments found efficacious in the initial research context in or-
der  to  understand  what  the  future  of  psychedelic  treatment 
could look like. PAP, as it is currently conducted, is typically 
time-intensive,  posing  barriers  for  individuals  who  do  not 
have  adequate  flexibility  in  their  daily  schedules.  This  has 
been identified as a barrier to treatment for individuals with 
PTSD  in  qualitative  studies  of  treatment  non-engagement 
[803, 804]. Future research would benefit from an examina-
tion  of  treatment  protocols  that  may  adjust  the  timeline  re-
quirements in order to assess which adaptations can be made 
while still maintaining the same level of efficacy.  For exam-
ple,  determining  the  necessary  number  of  dosing  sessions 
that can still achieve comparable change may help to ascer-
tain whether patients need to be able to commit to a full three 
dosing  sessions  or  if  they  could  achieve  the  same  outcome 
with only two dosing sessions; one RCT is currently recruit-
ing for a study of this question. In sum, while the immediate 
future  of  PAP  requires  further  research  into  the  efficacy  of 
these  treatments  in  their  current  incarnations,  the  broader-
reaching  future  will  necessarily  explore  adjustments  and 
adaptations that can, or should, be considered in the context 
of scalability. 

  Another  benefit  of  such  research  would  be  the  diversifi-
cation of participant samples.  Current RCTs for PAP require 
intensive time commitments; both of the Phase III protocols 
for MDMA-AT state that 19 weeks is the minimum amount 
of time to complete the study, and the time of completion for 
the average participant is expected to be 27 weeks [40, 282]. 
It is likely that many of these sessions have to occur during 
the  work  week  within  standard  working  hours,  indicating 
that  people  with  less  flexible  jobs  or  financial  barriers  to 
taking leave from their jobs, or those for whom travel to re-
search locations may be difficult, may not be able to engage. 
This  could  exclude  a  number  of  people  who  may  not  have 
the resources to accommodate a rigorous treatment schedule. 
This  is  notable  given  that  individuals  with  lower  household 
incomes  have  higher  rates  of  PTSD  [805].  Thus,  expanding 
inclusion  of  individuals  of  broader-ranging  socioeconomic 
classes  and  assessing  the  efficacy  of  these  treatments  for 
these individuals will be vital in the future, in order to better 
understand  the  generalizability  of  findings  to  communities 
that may be more likely to be impacted by trauma and PTSD. 

Few psychedelic-assisted therapy studies have been able 
to  recruit    sample  populations  representative  of  the  public’s 
diversity,  which  limits  the  validity  of  the  results.  Because 
representative  samples  are  required  to  have  strong  external 
validity  within  a  study,  when  studies  lack  diverse  samples, 

the  generalizability  of  the  study’s  results  is  compromised. 
Given that many published psychedelic studies have majority 
White/Caucasian  sample  populations  [806],  which  is  not 
representative of the overall prevalence rates of PTSD [807], 
it is important for the field to increase the ethnoracial diver-
sity  of  participants  in  order  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  these 
treatments  for  the  broader  population  of  individuals  who 
suffer from PTSD. 

  One way in which the expansion of participant diversity 
may  be  promoted  is  by  broadening  recruitment  methods, 
which has been identified as a possible barrier for the partic-
ipation of people of color (POC) in psychedelic trials [808]. 
Current and past recruitment methods have relied significant-
ly  on  “outpatient  providers”  [806];  future  studies  and  the 
field  as  a  whole  could  benefit  from  expanding  recruitment 
methods to account for the limitations of outpatient treatment 
settings. Due to factors like stigma, many POC are less likely 
to  seek  psychological  treatment  [809],  and  therefore,  addi-
tional referral sources for future studies, such as physicians, 
community members, and culturally appropriate advertising, 
could help increase the diversity of participants [806, 810]. 

  Another  direction  that  may  enhance  participant  recruit-
ment is the expansion of training and inclusion of providers 
who  are  of  ethnic  or  racial  minority  identities.    Researchers 
have  found  that  ethnic  minorities  value  provider  knowledge 
of  prejudices/discrimination  and  racial  match  more  than 
White people [811], and thus, having more POC researchers 
in the psychedelic community may boost POC participation. 
This may also impact the efficacy of treatment, the nature of 
the  therapeutic  alliance,  and  the  trust  in  the  providers  and 
process  that  POC  participants  experience.  Future  research 
may benefit from exploring the nature of the personal identi-
ties  of  both  participant  and  provider  in  the  context  of  the 
therapeutic alliance that is so central to PAP.  

  Lastly,  it  would  be  interesting  for  future  studies  of  PAP 
to  treat  PTSD  to  utilize  alternative  measures  for  assessing 
PTSD  symptoms.  MDMA-AT  utilizes 
the  Clinician-
Administered  PTSD  Scale  for  DSM-5  (CAPS-5)  as  the  pri-
mary  assessment,  but  additional  or  alternative  use  of 
measures that have been validated with more ethnically and 
racially diverse populations could be beneficial in addressing 
the cultural differences in expression and assessment of psy-
chopathology. Additionally, given initial research indicating 
the  potential  efficacy  of  psychedelic  use  in  alleviating  psy-
chological  distress  following  racial  trauma  [458],  future 
studies may also find utility in measures such as the UConn 
Racial/Ethnic  Stress  &  Trauma  Survey  (UnRESTS),  which 
measures  PTSD  specifically  within  the  context  of  racial 
trauma [810]. 

5.3. Expanding Research on Set & Setting 

  The  characteristics  of  psychedelic  experiences  reported 
by  patients  undergoing  psychedelic-assisted  therapy  have 
been widely variable. Optimizing the internal mindset (“set”) 
of a patient as well as the therapeutic environment (“setting”) 
in which psychedelic therapy occurs [812] has been suggest-
ed  as  a  way  of  increasing  the  likelihood  that  patients  will 
have  a  positive  experience.  That  human  environments  have 
effects  on  the  way  people  behave  is  a  principle  of  architec-
ture  and  interior  design,  and  these  concepts  have  been  ex-

 
698    Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4 

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

plored  in  healthcare  settings  and  psychiatry  [813-816].  The 
concept  of  set  and  setting  can  be  conceptualized  to  be  an 
application  of  this  principle  in  the  context  of  psychedelic 
therapy.  A  qualitative  assessment  of  veterans  who  declined 
to  engage  in  PTSD  treatment  identified  that  25%  stated  the 
physical  environment,  including  sterility,  cleanliness,  win-
dowless offices, and overcrowding, impacted their ability to 
feel  safe,  particularly  given  symptoms  of  hypervigilance 
[803].   

  A recent study identified three external factors—being in 
nature,  preparation  of  a  safe  environment  for  psychedelic 
use, and music with positive lyrics, as well as three internal 
factors—understanding  of  the  psychedelic  effects  the  sub-
stance  would  have,  the  mindset  of  trust  and  acceptance  to-
wards  the  psychedelic  treatment  experience,  and  motivation 
of  escapism  and  self-exploration—that  were  important  in 
ensuring a positive psychedelic experience [817].  

  The  synchronicity  and  influence  that  music  has  within 
the context of PAP have been discussed throughout this pa-
per. Patients have reported both positive and negative effects 
of  the  musical  styles  and  playlist  design.  This,  in  combina-
tion  with  sometimes  conflicting  results,  suggests  a  high  de-
gree  of  variability  between  patients  with  regard  to  music 
choice  during  psychedelic  therapy  [295].  While  music  is 
currently standardized in some clinical trials, in a post-FDA-
approval future, personalized choices will be possible. With 
commercial  involvement  from  the  private  sector,  the  future 
of  optimal  music  selection  for  PAP  may  include  real-time 
curation  and  generative  artificial  intelligence.  Safety  guide-
lines  for  psychedelic  therapy  recommend  making  the  room 
in which therapy occurs resemble a living room while trying 
to avoid items and behaviors, such as white lab coats, medi-
cal  supplies,  and  medical  testing,  that  may  increase  anxiety 
[417].  Research  remains  to  be  conducted  to  determine  the 
optimal set and setting factors to promote positive and bene-
ficial experiences during psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy 
sessions. 

5.4. Clinical Trial Design 

  As  we  consider  the  future  of  psychedelics  in  the  post-
FDA-approval world, some are concerned that the very large 
effect sizes of the clinical trials will not translate to clinical 
care.  This  is  due  in  part  to  the  expectancy  effect  combined 
with the placebo and nocebo effects of the trials. Psychedel-
ic-assisted therapy is a consciousness-altering therapy that is 
difficult,  if  not  impossible,  to  blind  with  a  placebo.  While 
minimally  psychoactive  compounds  (niacin,  diphenhydra-
mine,  midazolam,  or  very  low-dose  psychedelic)  have  been 
used  as  placebos,  they  have  demonstrated  mixed  success 
with blinding. For example, the Phase III study of MDMA-
AT  (vs.  inactive  placebo)  for  PTSD  showed  that  ~90%  of 
participants  correctly  guessed  which  intervention  they  had 
been administered [40]. This suboptimal blinding result in an 
otherwise highly successful trial is no outlier [498], and this 
pattern  yields  thorny  questions  for  the  field,  and  include 
most notably: Can the trend of remarkable trial outcomes be 
attributed to psychedelic therapy, to the placebo effect, or to 
some  combination  of  the  two?  How  should  clinicians,  re-
searchers, and regulators proceed [818]? 

  While  these  are  important  unanswered  questions,  the 
territory  is  not  uncharted.  Many  “gold-standard”  medical 
treatments are also an imperfect fit for blinded RCTs: a non-
exhaustive  list  includes  surgery,  psychoactive  medications 
(benzodiazepines,  methylphenidate,  opioids,  ketamine),  and 
cognitive  behavioral  therapy.  While  these  therapies  are  not 
equivalent to psychedelic-assisted therapy, they demonstrate 
that  challenges  with  blinding  design  can  be  adequately  ad-
dressed to secure regulatory approval. Also, changes to clini-
cal  trial  design  may  be  warranted:  for  example,  Phase  III 
MDMA  studies  used  a  crossover  design  to  help  address  the 
challenges of blinding.  

  The  appropriate  interpretation  of  these  trials  is  further 
complicated by expectancy effects and the mechanism of the 
placebo effect. The placebo effect is a confounder in that it is 
grounded in changes to neurobiology and signaling that have 
meaningful  implications  for  psychiatric  conditions  [819]. 
Furthermore, novel therapies tend to have larger effect sizes, 
but these tend to regress to the mean over longer periods of 
assessment  [820].  Psychedelic-assisted  therapy  is  also  par-
ticularly  vulnerable  to  expectancy  effects  due  to  broad  ex-
citement and public awareness, which can yield larger place-
bo  effects  from  a  participant  population  that  has  favorable 
expectations  [821].  A  reasonable  counterpoint  might  argue 
that  if  patients  can  safely  get  better,  it  is  less  important  to 
distinguish between the neurobiology of psychedelic-assisted 
therapy  and  that  of  placebo-assisted  psychotherapy.  While 
there  is  merit  to  this  rebuttal,  others  [822]  have  correctly 
noted  that  this  represents  a  fundamental  change  in  the  way 
psychiatry is studied, with an increased emphasis on absolute 
benefit  over  placebo  comparisons.  In  the  future,  thoughtful 
study  design  will  be  necessary  to  convincingly  demonstrate 
the potential benefits of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. 

5.5.  The  Effects  of  Recent,  Chronic,  or  Current  Psycho-
tropic Use 

  Considering the complexity of trauma sequelae that typi-
cally manifests clinically in patients struggling with multiple 
comorbidities  and  concurrent  medication  regimens,  being 
included in psychedelic studies can present as a troublesome 
task  for  many  individuals  desperate  for  treatment  due  to 
sometimes strict exclusion criteria specified for these studies. 
Stringent  inclusion  criteria  and  extensive  exclusionary  fac-
tors  may  make  sense  given  the  novelty  of  the  research,  the 
class of substances being examined, and the need to establish 
clear  safety  profiles,  particularly  with  our  understanding  of 
the  neuropsychiatric  elements  associated  with  psychedelics 
still  in  its  formative  years.  However,  as  described  below, 
certain  developments  and  intriguing  findings  have  surfaced 
in  recent  studies  presenting  the  case  for  restructuring  these 
criteria.  

For example, the need to taper off psychotropic medica-
tion becomes restrictive for many patients, but this notion is 
beginning to be questioned. An open-label pilot study of 19 
patients demonstrated the safety and efficacy of 25 mg psilo-
cybin  in  participants  who  did  not  discontinue  SSRI  usage 
[823]. Results included a rapid reduction in depressive symp-
toms following the day of administration and continuing into 
the primary efficacy endpoint of 3 weeks [823], with no re-
ported serious adverse effects.

5.6.  Novel  Combinations  of  Psychosocial  Interventions 
with Psychedelics 

psychedelic  context  may  reinforce  the  positive  effects  of 
these substances. 

  At present, psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies are most 
commonly conducted with manuals emphasizing preparation 
and  integration  but  with  a  non-directive  approach  in  regard 
to  the  content  and  facilitation  of  dosing  sessions  (e.g.,  
[422]).  However,  questions  remain  about  the  use  of  evi-
dence-based, manualized treatments for PTSD as adjuncts to 
the  psychedelic  experience.  This  combination  could  poten-
tially  enhance  the  effects  of  both  types  of  treatment  [824] 
and mitigate the time-intensive nature of a non-directive ap-
proach [825]. Certain therapies, in particular, have been the-
orized to be promising adjuncts, including Prolonged Expo-
sure  (PE)  [825]  and  Third  Wave  Behavioral  Therapies 
(TWBT)  [824],  including  Mindfulness-Based  Cognitive 
Therapy  (MBCT),  Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy 
(ACT),  and  Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy  (DBT).    Further-
more,  alternative  modalities  that  utilize  the  interpersonal 
effects  of  psychedelic  substances  have  been  proposed  and 
preliminarily  examined;  these  include  Cognitive  Behavioral 
Conjoint Therapy (CBCT), a protocol that incorporates par-
ticipants’  significant  others  into  the  treatment,  and  various 
forms of group therapy.   

  Numerous aspects of the rationale for PE indicate that it 
may be a helpful adjunct to psychedelic-assisted psychother-
apies. In particular, PE utilizes exposures to confront trauma-
related  stimuli  and  decreases  conditioned  fear  responses; 
given  the  effects  of  MDMA  in  facilitating  fear  extinction 
[296], combining these treatments may lead to an intensified 
extinction  effect  and  enhanced  mechanism  of  change  [825]. 
However, it is necessary to explore the ways in which these 
treatments  could  most  efficaciously  be  combined,  including 
the  order  of  exposure-based  sessions  and  MDMA  dosing 
sessions,  or  the  utilization  of  exposure  within  dosing  ses-
sions,  as  well  as  the  most  appropriate  dose  of  MDMA  or 
other psychedelic medication when used in conjunction with 
an exposure-based therapy.   

  While TWBTs do not have a comparable base of research 
to PE demonstrating their efficacy for treating PTSD, prelim-
inary research and theories exist regarding why they may be 
beneficial  for  the  treatment  of  trauma-related  disorders. 
Walsh and Thiessen [824] proposed a reciprocal relationship 
in which the use of psychedelics would enhance the efficacy 
of  these  TWBTs,  and  the  TWBTs,  in  turn,  would  enhance 
the psychedelic experience. In particular, they identified the 
mindfulness component, a core skill taught in many TWBTs 
and a practice known to reduce rumination and increase cog-
nitive flexibility, as a possible mirror of the mystical experi-
ences  induced  by  psychedelics.  As  mindfulness  practices 
have  been  found  to  activate  brain  regions  integral  to  PTSD 
responses, such as the prefrontal cortex, and decrease activi-
ty in relevant neurological structures, such as the amygdala, 
these  practices  appear  particularly  suitable  for  the  treatment 
of  trauma-related  disorders  [826].  They  may  also  influence 
the  functioning  and  connectivity  of  the  Default  Mode  Net-
work (DMN), Salience Network (SN), and Central Executive 
Network (CEN) [826], brain regions hypothesized to under-
lie  some  of  the  effects  of  psychedelic  substances,  as  well 
[280].  Thus,  the  facilitation  of  mindfulness  strategies  in  a 

  Additional therapeutic mechanisms of TWBTs were sim-
ilarly  hypothesized  to  complement  the  effects  of  psychedel-
ics [824]. The emotion regulation module of Dialectical Be-
havior  Therapy  (DBT)  may  be  enhanced  by  the  emotional 
integration  facilitated  by  psychedelic  experiences,  while 
DBT’s distress tolerance module may be made more effica-
cious in conjunction with the decreased threat sensitivity and 
increased  tolerance  for  exploring  distressing  experiences 
found  in  psychedelic  psychotherapy  sessions.  The  decenter-
ing feature of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) 
and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has also 
been  observed  among  users  of  ayahuasca,  and  could  poten-
tially mimic or boost such effects [824].  

  The first evidence-based protocol to be used formally in 
conjunction  with  PAP  was  Cognitive  Behavioral  Conjoint 
Therapy (CBCT), a treatment for PTSD that involves active 
participation by both members of a couple within which one 
partner  has  PTSD  [827].  CBCT  was  proposed  for  MDMA-
facilitated use due to the seemingly complementary nature of 
outcomes  for  both  types  of  treatment.  Specifically,  the  im-
provements  observed  after  CBCT  in  not  just  PTSD  symp-
toms  but  relationship  functioning  and  intimate  partner  well-
being, and the focus of the treatment on developing skills as 
a  dyad  to  improve  the  relationship,  were  hypothesized  to 
complement the empathogenic and neurocognitive effects of 
MDMA  [399].  Researchers  proposed  that  MDMA  would 
increase  the  feelings  of  interpersonal  connection,  enhancing 
the ability of a couple to communicate and support the over-
all dyadic process of CBCT. In an uncontrolled pilot study of 
6  couples,  all  12  partners  engaged  in  2  MDMA  dosing  ses-
sions during the course of their CBCT treatment. Significant 
improvements in clinician-assessed as well as self- and part-
ner-reported  PTSD  symptoms  were  measured,  as  were  sig-
nificant  improvements  in  relationship  satisfaction  for  both 
patient and partner. Secondary measures indicated improve-
ments in the patient’s depression, sleep, emotion regulation, 
and  trauma-related  beliefs.  Effects  were  generally  largest  at 
6-month follow-up, indicating that MDMA-facilitated CBCT 
may have continuing benefits [399]. However, given the lack 
of control conditions and small sample size, further research 
is  needed  to  assess  the  relative  efficacy  of  this  combined 
treatment compared with CBCT or MDMA-AT individually. 

Finally, there are some indications that alternative modal-
ities,  such  as  group  psychotherapy,  may  build  upon  the  ef-
fects  of  psychedelics.  Non-clinical  use  of  psychedelics  in 
group settings has been recorded throughout history, includ-
ing  psilocybin-  or  ayahuasca-based  religious  ceremonies. 
Social  connectedness  appears  to  be  a  vital  mechanism  of 
change following psilocybin use [468, 750], with higher lev-
els  of  interpersonal  support  correlating  with  increased  posi-
tive  experiences  [828].  A  review  of  early  psychedelic-
assisted therapy studies from the 1960s and ‘70s that includ-
ed  a  group  component  found  that  individuals  identified  as 
“neurotics” reported clinical improvements following uncon-
trolled studies of psychedelic-assisted group therapy, with a 
single  controlled  study  indicating  that  those  in  a  high-dose 
LSD arm had better outcomes than those in a low-dose LSD 
arm.  In  contrast,  this  same  review  noted  that  group  therapy 

 
700    Current Neuropharmacology, 2024, Vol. 22, No. 4 

Glatman Zaretsky et al. 

for  alcoholism  only  demonstrated  significant  improvements 
for  those  in  groups  that  had  been  specifically  adapted  for 
psychedelic  use  or  modeled  after  Alcoholics  Anonymous 
[829]. The limitations of these early studies necessitate cau-
tious interpretation but suggest that further research into psy-
chedelic-assisted group therapy models may be able to eluci-
date the possible strengths of this combination of modalities. 

  More  recently,  a  psychedelic-assisted  group  therapy 
model  was  utilized  in  Switzerland,  with  participants  taking 
either LSD or MDMA in a group setting over the course of 
1-12 sessions; the type of substance and number of uses was 
determined  individually  with  each  participant.  Notably, 
bonds formed between participants of these group sessions to 
the extent that they began meeting outside of the therapeutic 
context,  suggesting  a  positive  interaction  with  the  prosocial 
effects  of  psychedelics  [623].  Another  group  therapy  model 
was  used  by  researchers  exploring  the  use  of  psilocybin  for 
demoralization  in  long-term  Acquired  Immune  Deficiency 
Syndrome (AIDS) survivors [621]. In this model, the medi-
cation  was  not  taken  in  a  group  context,  but  group  therapy 
was utilized in preparing for, processing, and integrating the 
experience.  Researchers  measured  robust  decreases  in  de-
moralization  and  comparable  results  to  those  in  individual 
psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy trials. They suggested that 
this  pilot  study  indicated  the  safety  and  feasibility  of  the 
group therapy model as an intervention. Although the acces-
sibility of this model may be limited due to less flexibility in 
scheduling,  it  would  allow  for  more  patients  to  be  treated 
within  fewer  therapist  hours.  The  group  model  may  also 
more  effectively  address  social  isolation  and  could  provide 
an avenue to decrease feelings of shame or stigma for partic-
ipants  and  increase  validation.  Notably,  while  some  partici-
pants reported a slower rapport-building with the clinicians, 
several  reported  feeling  connected  quickly  with  other  group 
members, improving their tolerance of the intervention. 

  Given the initial potential shown by psychedelic-assisted 
CBCT and group therapies, along with the proposed benefits 
of TWBTs and PE, further research into the combination of 
psychedelics  with  pre-established,  evidence-based  protocols 
is warranted.   

5.7.  Alternative  Metrics  to  Capture  the  Effects  of  Psy-
chedelics 

In  PTSD  clinical  trials,  the  gold-standard  primary  out-
come  determining  the  efficacy  of  treatment  and  whether  it 
will  receive  FDA  approval  is  the  comparison  of  one  treat-
ment  against  another  using  the  Clinician-Administered 
PTSD  Scale  (CAPS)  [830],  with  the  most  current  iteration 
being  the  CAPS-5  [831].  This  is  a  structured  interview  that 
determines whether a person meets DSM-5 criteria for PTSD 
for  a  given  index  trauma.  However,  using  a  set  of  rules 
(DSM  criteria)  to  define  an  illness  has  many  limitations. 
When they were designed, DSM diagnoses were not intend-
ed  for  research  into  basic  science  hypotheses  [832,  833]. 
Furthermore,  meeting  the  criteria  for  a  diagnosis  does  not 
necessarily  predict  a  trajectory;  for  example,  subsyndromal 
PTSD  can  be  associated  with  a  similar  level  of  impairment 
as  PTSD  itself  [834].  Therefore,  some  individuals  suffering 
from the psychological sequelae of trauma are left out of the 
population  and  not  studied  or  treated  because,  based  on  a 

professional  evaluation  on  a  specific  day,  they  do  not  have 
the  correct  combination  of  symptoms  to  warrant  a  PTSD 
diagnosis. The criteria, and therefore, who receives a diagno-
sis  and  who  does  not,  have  also  changed  with  each  DSM 
edition. 

  Additionally, 
tremendous  heterogeneity  characterizes 
those  who  do  meet  these  criteria,  with  636,120  different 
combinations of symptoms that all would meet DSM criteria 
for PTSD, so that two people with a diagnosis of PTSD may 
not share a single overlapping symptom [832]. There is also 
significant  overlap  in  symptoms  between  different  DSM 
diagnoses, so PTSD is very likely to be diagnosed with mul-
tiple  possible  other  conditions,  both  of  which  partially  de-
scribe  an  individual’s  phenomenological  experience.  Sub-
classes, endophenotypes, and trajectories of PTSD have been 
characterized  that  may  reflect  different  underlying  biology 
[835]  or  treatment  responses  [836,  837].  Furthermore,  the 
CAPS  assessment  does  not  take  into  account  the  staging  of 
PTSD, which may have distinct associated biological charac-
teristics and differing treatment approaches and expectations 
at different time points [834]. 

  Many  sectors  of  psychiatry,  from  psychoanalysis  to  bio-
logical  psychiatry,  use  other  approaches  to  categorize  psy-
chological  suffering  based  on  various  frameworks,  ranging 
from  the  Research  Domain  Criteria  (RDoC)  [838],  which 
classifies  disease  trans-diagnostically  based  on  dimensional 
conceptualizations  of  biology-based  psychological  con-
structs,  to  the  Hierarchical  Taxonomy  of  Psychopathology 
(HiTop) [839, 840], which rates symptoms based on severi-
ty; to the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual, which focuses 
more  on  the  individual  rather  than  a  specific  illness  (“what 
one is rather than what one has”) [841]. In modern research, 
real-time biological markers are starting to be used to meas-
ure  functional  impairments  as  well  as  treatment  responses. 
For example, studies have used visual and auditory markers 
of  arousal  and  mood,  as  well  as  passively  collected  digital 
data  such  as  that  available  via  a  smartwatch  or  smartphone, 
to  gather  moment-by-moment  data  involving  behavioral 
changes in everyday tasks and activities [842-848]. 

Finally,  because  psychedelics  seem  to  have  applications 
trans-diagnostically that may address root causes when treat-
ing trauma, regardless of DSM diagnosis [273, 736], perhaps 
an  opportunity  exists  to  conduct  clinical  trials  in  which  the 
primary outcome measure is not a reduction in a set of symp-
toms,  but  something  more  personal.  More  personalized 
measures may be indicated so that treatments can be tailored 
to individuals rather than to a DSM diagnosis. To date, clini-
cal trials in psychiatry and the FDA regulatory process have 
not  been  updated  to  reflect  these  different  approaches;  at 
present,  we  are  constrained  to  designing  treatment  trials  to 
comply with the existing system.  

  A clinical understanding exists that just because someone 
is no longer symptomatic of the index trauma does not mean 
that they are not still impaired by suffering related to psycho-
logical  distress.  Secondary  measures,  such  as  well-being,  
and  scales  that  measure  various  domains  of  functioning, 
acknowledge  this.  But  these  measurements  are  still  con-
strained  by  our  a  priori  notions  of  suffering  and  healing.  A 
more insightful future would allow the patient to tell us what 
matters most to them and to weigh outcomes based on their

own,  and  perhaps  their  loved  ones’,  assessments  of  im-
provement. We now have the resources of Big Data and Ma-
chine  Learning  (ML)  that  facilitate  the  effective  analysis  of 
such  multidimensional  and  non-standardized  data  [849].  A 
promising  strategy  is  to  use  speech  and  video  in  a  data-
driven  way  to  enable  understanding  of  informative  assess-
ment  criteria  when  developing  and  implementing  novel 
treatments such as psychedelic-assisted therapies (PAT). 

5.8.  Predicting  the  Outcomes  of  Psychedelic-Assisted 
Therapies 

In pursuit of personalized medical treatments that capital-
ize on the large datasets and advanced computational strate-
gies  now  available,  recent  developments  in  Machine  Learn-
ing (ML) analysis have started to facilitate the prediction of 
treatment outcomes for a variety of diseases, including can-
cer  [850-852],  metabolic  disorders  [853],  and  psychiatric 
conditions [854-856]. This vein of research involves a para-
digm shift from experimental studies conducted to test indi-
vidual hypotheses toward the development of broad, predic-
tive models [854, 857]. 

Factors influencing the outcomes of psychedelic-assisted 
therapeutic  experiences  have  been  described  in  this  paper’s 
previous  sections.  Aspects  including  the  drug  used,  drug 
dosage,  set,  and  setting  influence  the  patient’s  experience 
[456].  Pre-dosing  states  and  traits  determined  to  influence 
acute  responses  to  psychedelics  are  reviewed  in  [858]. 
Known  factors  that  promote  a  positive  experience  can  be 
integrated with information about an individual’s physiolog-
ical  and  psychological  characteristics  [859,  860]  to  predict 
whether  a  particular  treatment  is  likely  to  benefit  them  or 
even  to  recommend  treatment  parameters  to  optimize  the 
individual’s  experience.  Using  these  computational  strate-
gies, contraindications could be identified that would prevent 
inappropriate treatments from being administered [263]. Re-
lated to this, “paradoxical responses” to psychedelic-assisted 
therapies,  describing  the  development  of  harmful  effects 
despite  the  experience  of  other  benefits,  have  been  reported 
[360]; computational strategies could be employed to under-
stand which individuals are likely to experience purely bene-
ficial effects, vs. which are at risk of additionally experienc-
ing harms. 

  Challenges  to  implementing  ML  strategies  to  predict 
treatment  outcomes  include  the  requirement  for  large  da-
tasets  to  achieve  accurate  predictions.  Patient  protections 
often  prohibit  such  large  datasets  from  being  created  or  ac-
cessed by researchers. To date, when ML has been applied to 
assess  psychiatric  disorders,  few  retrospective  studies  have 
included  sufficient  external  validation  analyses,  and  even 
fewer prospective studies have tested the accuracy and clini-
cal  relevance  of  predictive  models  [854].  Much  work  re-
mains  to  be  conducted  to  realize  the  promise  of  applying 
advanced  computational  strategies  on  large  datasets  to  in-
form  effective  psychedelic-assisted  psychotherapy  treat-
ments. 

  Additional  factors  related  to  the  individuals  receiving 
treatment  can  be  utilized  in  predicting  outcomes.  A  pilot 
epigenetic  study  has  begun  the  process  of  identifying  DNA 
methylation  changes  on  genes  correlated  with  symptom  re-

duction  after  MDMA-AT  treatment  [386],  and  this  reflects 
research that has been conducted for other psychotherapeutic 
treatments. Further research into the epigenetic factors, with 
a  greater  understanding  of  biological  and  environmental  in-
fluences,  will  allow  for  better  prediction  of  treatment  re-
sponses. 

5.9. Psychedelics to Promote Psychological Wellness 

  A main focus of the current psychedelic renaissance has 
been the targeting of psychedelic-assisted therapy to specific 
psychiatric  indications  for  FDA  approval,  with  symptom 
scales  as  the  primary  endpoint.  However,  research  interest 
exists  in  the  influence  of  psychedelic  compounds  on  resili-
ence  and  well-being  as  separate  from  psychiatric  illness 
[861,  862].  Additionally,  others  have  supported  the  use  of 
these compounds for artistic or creative purposes [863].  

  Resilience is defined as an individual’s ability to adapt to 
novel  stressors  or  challenges  and  has  some  known  genetic, 
epigenetic, neurological, and psychiatric contributory factors 
[864]. Impairment in resilience can lead to the development 
of  psychiatric  conditions  [864].  A  growing  body  of  work 
suggests that psychedelic use has a positive association with 
resilience. For example, a recent study surveyed individuals 
regarding  their  lifetime  psychedelic  use  and  found  that  past 
usage  was  associated  with  higher  scores  of  positive  affect 
and  increased  openness  [861].  The  same  study  found  links 
between  psychedelic  use  and  personality  traits  associated 
with  resilience.  An  additional  study  found  that  quantitative 
positive effects associated with acute psilocybin use can out-
last  the  acute  period,  which  may  help  to  explain  the  pattern 
of positive associations associated with lifetime psychedelic 
use [865].  

Further  work  has  demonstrated  that  this  phenomenon  is 
robust  across  multiple  cultures.  For  example,  one  study 
demonstrated an adaptive pattern of coping behaviors across 
hallucinogen users from multiple cultural backgrounds [866]. 
This  has  favorable  implications  for  the  generalizability  of 
psychedelic-assisted  therapy,  which  is  currently  limited  by 
research  that  has  drawn  largely  from  an  ethnically  and  cul-
turally homogeneous participant population. 

  While  psychedelic  experiences  are  usually  considered 
from the perspective of the individual, they can also be stud-
ied  from  vantage  points  of  intersubjective  and  intercultural 
relational processes [867]. Roseman et al. studied a group of 
Palestinians  and  Israelis  [867],  involving  two  cultures  in 
conflict  with  each  other,  who  consumed  ayahuasca  together 
in  a  ceremonial  context  and  then  reported  their  experiences 
during  in-depth  interviews.  The  researchers  identified  three 
relational  themes  present  in  the  individuals’  experiences:  a 
unity-based  connection  that  produced  a  feeling  of  ‘oneness’ 
across cultures; recognition and difference-based connection, 
which facilitated a strong sense of connection with the other 
culture; and conflict-related revelations in which participants 
revisited  past  historical  conflicts  from  another  perspective. 
While the group of 31 subjects was small, this work suggests 
that, beyond applications of psychedelics for individual heal-
ing and personal growth, these compounds may be applied to 
facilitate  inter-group  understanding  and  conflict  resolution, 
thus promoting societal wellness.

5.10. Concluding Statement for Future Directions  

  The  future  directions  described  above  are  certainly  de-
serving  of  additional  attention;  many  of  these  themes  are 
nascent topics in psychedelic research, and further investiga-
tion  is  necessary.  It  is  important  for  clinicians,  regulators, 
scientists,  lawmakers,  and  those  who  seek  to  advance  psy-
chedelic-assisted therapy to proceed with cautious optimism 
and tempered enthusiasm, acknowledging and advancing the 
potential  for  psychedelics  to  improve  well-being  among 
those  impacted  by  trauma-related  disorders  and,  potentially, 
broader segments of the population. 

CONCLUSION 

  This review intends to serve as a comprehensive resource 
for understanding the current state of research into the use of 
psychedelic-assisted  psychotherapies  for  PTSD.  We  first 
examined issues relevant to the etiology and pathophysiology 
of PTSD and trauma-related conditions. Next, we provided an 
overview of the history and therapeutic use of each psychedel-
ic  compound,  and  a  description  of  its  psychological  and  so-
matic  effects.  In  addition,  the  pharmacology  of  these  drugs 
was described in detail. We conclude that when administered 
with  proper  supervision,  these  drugs  have  an  excellent  safety 
record  [43,  868].  The  rationale  and  mechanisms  for  PTSD 
treatment  were  provided  for  each  drug,  and  the  evidence  to 
date  for  their  use  in  the  treatment  of  PTSD  was  described, 
with  a  focus  on  randomized,  controlled  clinical  trials  (Tables 
3-7). A thorough review of the use of these five compounds to 
treat  common  disorders  co-occurring  with  PTSD  (Table  8), 
including  major  depressive  disorder  (MDD),  substance  use 
disorder (SUD), and anxiety, was also provided. 

  The most advanced research on the use of psychedelics to 
treat  PTSD  and  trauma-related  disorders  employs  MDMA-
assisted therapy (Table 3), with Phase II and III trials report-
ing  statistically  significant  reductions  in  PTSD  symptoms 
when  compared  with  placebo-psychotherapy  (placebo-PT) 
[40,  282].  Head-to-head  trials  are  needed  to  enable  more 
direct  comparisons  of  psychedelics  and  other  treatments  for 
PTSD.  Numerous  clinical  trials  and  survey  studies  show 
associations  between  classic  psychedelic  use  and  reduced 
PTSD  symptoms  (Tables  2-7)  [458,  619,  869,  870],  which 
future research will ideally explore in a more clinically struc-
tured  manner.  Clinical  trials  involving  psilocybin-assisted 
psychotherapy  for  PTSD  are  currently  recruiting,  and  the 
outcomes  of  these  studies  will  expand  knowledge  about  the 
efficacy of this psychedelic as an adjunct to psychotherapy. 

  Given the preliminary state of research into psychedelic-
assisted  psychotherapy,  many  important  paths  remain  to  be 
explored in future research. In the Future Directions section, 
we  described  important  considerations  for  advancing  the 
study of psychedelics for the treatment of PTSD. Numerous 
factors are considered, including cost analysis scalability and 
the  generalizability  of  research  to  the  broader  public.  Addi-
tional  research  is  needed  to  address  the  important  methodo-
logic challenges that have arisen in evaluating the efficacy of 
psychedelic therapies, including study design, control condi-
tion  selection,  and  set  and  setting  considerations.  Standard-
ized  protocols  should  be  developed  to  protect  patients  and 
subjects engaged in these therapies. Much potential exists for 
combining  psychedelics  with  other  therapy  modalities  for 

enhancing  treatments  and  for  expanding  to  different  treat-
ment settings, including couples and group therapy. We de-
scribe  opportunities  to  develop  alternative  metrics  to  effec-
tively  capture  the  effects  of  psychedelics.  It  is  important  to 
develop  strategies  for  predicting  effective  treatments  for  in-
dividual  patients,  and  strategies  using  machine  learning 
(ML)  analysis  towards  this  end  are  discussed.  Finally,  we 
consider  psychedelics  as  a  potential  resource  for  enhancing 
well-being and resilience. 

  As described in this review paper, research studying psy-
chedelics  for  psychiatric  applications  is  nascent,  and  much 
remains  to  be  learned.  Nevertheless,  current  evidence  sug-
gests that, in the context of psychotherapy, psychedelics rep-
resent  a  promising  treatment  strategy  for  PTSD,  trauma-
related  disorders,  their  comorbidities,  and  for  the  general 
enhancement  of  well-being,  warranting  thoughtful  and  sub-
stantial future research.
