Abstract

Background:  Sexual minority (SM) individuals (e.g., those with same-sex attractions/partners or 
who identify as lesbian/gay/bisexual) experience a host of physical and mental health disparities. 
However, little is known about sexual orientation-related disparities in gestational diabetes 
mellitus (GDM) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP; gestational hypertension [gHTN] 
and preeclampsia).

Objective:  To estimate disparities in GDM, gHTN, and preeclampsia by sexual orientation.

Methods:  We used data from the Nurses’ Health Study II—a cohort of nurses across the US 
enrolled in 1989 at 25–42 years of age—restricted to those with pregnancies ≥20 weeks gestation 
and non-missing sexual orientation data (63,518 participants; 146,079 pregnancies). Our primary 
outcomes were GDM, gHTN, and preeclampsia, which participants reported for each of their 
pregnancies. Participants also reported their sexual orientation identity and same-sex attractions/
partners. We compared the risk of each outcome in pregnancies among heterosexual participants 
with no same-sex experience (reference) to those among SM participants overall and within 
subgroups: (1) heterosexual with same-sex experience, (2) mostly heterosexual, (3) bisexual, and 
(4) lesbian/gay participants. We used modified Poisson models to estimate risk ratios (RR) and 
95% confidence intervals (CI), fit via weighted generalized estimating equations, to account for 
multiple pregnancies per person over time and informative cluster sizes.

Results:  The overall prevalence of each outcome was ≤5%. Mostly heterosexual participants had 
a 31% higher risk of gHTN (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03, 1.66), and heterosexual participants with 
same-sex experience had a 31% higher risk of GDM (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13, 1.50), compared 
to heterosexual participants with no same-sex experience. The magnitudes of the risk ratios were 
high among bisexual participants for gHTN and preeclampsia and among lesbian/gay participants 
for gHTN.

Conclusions:  Some SM groups may be disparately burdened by GDM and HDP. Elucidating 
modifiable mechanisms (e.g., structural barriers, discrimination) for reducing adverse pregnancy 
outcomes among SM populations is critical.

1.  Background

Sexual minority (SM; e.g., those who have same-sex/gender attractions or partners, or 
identify as lesbian/gay/bisexual) individuals experience various inequities that stem from 
structural, interpersonal, and individual stigma (eFigure 1).1–4 This stigma leads to minority 
stress, a type of chronic stress implicated in poor preconception health, including adverse 
chronic health conditions,1,2,5 which can be triggered or exacerbated by pregnancy and 
lead to adverse perinatal outcomes.2,6,7 While a large body of research documents that 
SM individuals have health profiles that may place them at risk for gestational diabetes 
mellitus (GDM) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP; gestational hypertension 
[gHTN] and preeclampsia),8 little research has examined disparities in these outcomes 
themselves. For example, SM populations have a higher burden of cardiovascular disease, 
diabetes, and adverse mental health (such as depression and anxiety, which are also 
risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes).2,9–15 Minority stress causes adverse 
health and unhealthy coping behaviours, such as smoking and substance use, which are 
linked to GDM and HDP. Minority stress may also cause more systemic inflammation 
(or accumulated allostatic load) resulting in poor blood sugar regulation and higher blood 
pressure, resulting in GDM and HDP.16 Additionally, SM individuals have less access to 
health care and experience stigma in healthcare settings—especially within perinatal care 
settings—as many healthcare providers are not equipped to care for SM patients, or make

the invisibilizing/stigmatizing assumption that pregnancy patients are always heterosexual 
cisgender women, which may further contribute to adverse perinatal outcomes.17,18 Despite 
the mechanistic understanding that these pathways could lead to elevated risk in adverse 
pregnancy outcomes, it remains unclear whether sexual orientation disparities exist in GDM, 
gHTN, and preeclampsia.

Only two prior studies have assessed sexual orientation related disparities in GDM and 
HDP.19,20 Both studies found that HDP was non-significantly elevated among pregnancies 
to SMs. Sexual orientation is comprised of three dimensions: identity (e.g., heterosexual, 
bisexual, lesbian, gay), attractions, and behaviours.21 Both studies examining GDM and 
HDP focused on select subgroups of SM individuals (i.e., same-sex couples only19 or using 
identity only),20 due to limited measures of sexual orientation in population-based datasets. 
However, SM populations are much broader and more diverse than individuals in same-
sex relationships or whom identify as a SM person. In addition, different SM subgroups, 
including those who are heterosexual with same-sex partners, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, 
and lesbian/gay, have unique experiences (e.g., stress from concealment of sexual identity, 
discrimination, barriers accessing healthcare, and unique reproductive health needs) that 
may contribute to varied risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Understanding and 
addressing the specific challenges faced by each subgroup using a multidimensional 
measurement of sexual orientation are crucial for reducing health disparities and improving 
pregnancy health outcomes within SM populations.

We used identity-, attractions-, and behaviour-based measures of sexual orientation to 
elucidate sexual orientation-related disparities in GDM, gHTN, and preeclampsia. Guided 
by the intersectionality framework,22,23 SM people of colour and White SM people 
have qualitatively different experiences related to minority identities, some of which may 
exacerbate—or be protective against—the effects of minority stress;24 thus, we examined 
stratified estimates by race/ethnicity. We hypothesized that SM people will have a higher 
risk of GDM and HDP, with heterogenous outcomes by SM subgroup and that participants 
multiply minoritized by sexual orientation and race/ethnicity will experience the highest 
burden of these outcomes.

2.  Methods

2.1  Cohort selection

We analysed data from pregnancies reported in the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), a 
national cohort study in the United States (US) that began in 1989 among 116,429 female 
nurses. Specific data on gender identity were not collected; thus, we refer to participants 
using gender-neutral language. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire and biennial 
follow-up questionnaires thereafter (cumulative follow-up >88%). In the questionnaire sent 
in 2009, participants were asked questions about lifetime pregnancies, including birth 
year, gestation length, birthweight, pregnancy outcome, and pregnancy complications. We 
restricted the analysis to respondents who reported at least one pregnancy lasting ≥20 weeks. 
We excluded participants who never reported a sexual orientation identity. We analysed two 
samples: all pregnancies, then restricted to first pregnancies.

2.2  Outcomes

Page 4

All pregnancies occurred from 1959–2010. Our primary outcomes were self-reported GDM, 
gHTN, and preeclampsia. A validation study conducted in the Nurses’ Health studies 
showed that 89% of preeclampsia and 94% of GDM self-reports were confirmed by 
medical records.25–27 Furthermore, another study conducted in the general population 
showed that individuals can accurately self-report hypertension during pregnancy and 
GDM.28 If participants reported both gHTN and preeclampsia in a pregnancy, we assigned 
preeclampsia (the more severe condition).

2.3  Exposure

We used participants’ reported sexual orientation as our exposure. The effect of one’s sexual 
orientation on pregnancy outcomes likely operates both through experiences of stigma and 
discrimination (i.e., worsening health) and experiences of social support (i.e., improving 
health).

In 1995 and 2009, participants reported their sexual orientation identity using response 
options: heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian/gay. In 2017, participants reported more nuanced 
identities using an item adapted from the Minnesota Adolescent Health Survey29 response 
options: completely heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly homosexual, 
completely homosexual, in addition to lifetime identity and same-sex attractions/partners 
(see eTable 1 for detailed questions).

2.3.1  Primary classification of sexual orientation—For the primary classification, 
we combined measures from the 1995, 2009, and 2017 surveys to create a multidimensional 
measure of sexual orientation (Figure 1). Overall, we combined participants’ most recent 
identity measure with information about past attractions, partners, and identity to obtain the 
following groups:

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

‘Completely heterosexual or heterosexual’ AND never had past same-sex 
attractions nor partners nor previously identified as SM (shortened name: 
heterosexual with no same-sex experience [reference group])

‘Completely heterosexual or heterosexual’ AND had same-sex attractions or 
partners or previously identified as SM (shortened name: heterosexual with 
same-sex experience)

Mostly heterosexual

Bisexual

Mostly or completely homosexual (shortened name: lesbian/gay)

We analyze groups 2 and 3 separately because these two subgroups are hypothesized 
to experience unique forms of minority stress.30 For example, people who experience 
dissonance between different dimensions of their sexual orientation (e.g., self-identified 
heterosexual people with same-sex partners) experience different forms of minority stress 
from other SM groups with concordant sexuality (e.g., self-identified mostly heterosexual 
people with same-sex partners). Furthermore, the 2017 measure captured participants’

sexual orientation after several significant legal protections (e.g., Obergefell v. Hodges, 
2015); studies have shown that people are more likely to disclose a SM identity if the 
structural environment is accepting.31 Therefore, the 2017 measure may be better than the 
1995/2009 measures at capturing the health effects of minority stress due to increased SM 
disclosure. Second, because these outcomes are associated with mortality, we included in 
the reference group those who identified as completely heterosexual or heterosexual AND 
were missing data on past same-sex attractions, same-sex partners, and previous SM identity. 
This was to avoid differentially removing people who did not survive until 2017 from the 
reference group. See the Discussion for more details about the advantages/disadvantages of 
this measure.

2.3.2  Secondary classification of sexual orientation—Sexual orientation can 
change over time; thus, we performed separate analyses using a derived variable that 
measures sexual orientation closest to the pregnancy (e.g., if the pregnancy occurred in 
1997, we used data from the 1995 measure). If participants were missing data on both 
measures, they were excluded from analyses using the secondary classification. We used the 
following categories for sexual orientation closest to pregnancy:

1.

2.

3.

Heterosexual (reference group)

Bisexual

Lesbian

2.4  Stratification variables

Participants self-reported their race and ethnicity at baseline (1989). We categorized race 
using the following groups: White, Black, Asian, Native American, and multiple/another. 
We categorized ethnicity as: Latine and non-Latine. Because of small cell sizes, we 
dichotomized race/ethnicity for the stratified estimates (racial/ethnic minority participants 
vs. non-Latine White participants).

2.5  Covariates

Sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person’s identity, and thus, many factors 
that are commonly adjusted for in pregnancy studies (e.g., smoking status, BMI, and 
conception method) are downstream from sexual orientation (e.g., SM stigma increases 
stress which increases the likelihood of smoking as a coping behaviour) and thus may 
be mediators in the present analysis (eFigure 1). Adjustment for mediators can introduce 
bias, and in this analysis, adjustment of mediators would remove the effect of heterosexism 
and discrimination that likely contribute to adverse outcomes.32 While we explored models 
adjusted for age at pregnancy, we note that some of the effects of age could be mediating 
(SM people are more likely to have teen pregnancies and pregnancies at later ages).19,33–35

2.6  Statistical analysis

The unit of analysis was pregnancy. We presented individual- and pregnancy-level 
descriptive statistics for variables used in the analyses. We used modified Poisson models to 
estimate risk ratios (RRs) of each adverse outcome separately, by sexual orientation among

all pregnancies ≥20 weeks. Because participants could report more than one pregnancy, 
we accounted for clustering at the person level. The cluster size may be informative
—people who experience adverse pregnancy outcomes may have more pregnancies to 
reach their desired family size or fewer pregnancies to avoid cumulative adverse risks. 
Therefore, we used a variation of generalized estimating equations (GEE)—weighted GEE 
(using weights equal to the inverse of the cluster size)—to account for pregnancies from 
the same individual.36 We also used modified Poisson models (without GEE since each 
person contributed one pregnancy in this analysis) to estimate unadjusted and age-adjusted 
RRs of each adverse outcome separately by sexual orientation category only among first 
pregnancies because preeclampsia predominately impacts first pregnancies.

We fit separate models with an interaction term between race/ethnicity and sexual 
orientation and reported RRs for each combination of race/ethnicity and sexual orientation 
groups.

2.7  Sensitivity analyses

We conducted sensitivity analyses restricting to singleton live births to account for the 
known effects of multifetal gestations and adjusting for parity (results from these analyses 
did not differ meaningfully from the main analyses [eTables 2–5]). We also performed 
misclassification correction analyses to show self-report bias for the outcomes is low in this 
study (eTable 6).

2.8  Missing data

We included those with any data on sexual orientation identity. Only 66 participants who 
had 153 pregnancies (0.1% of the sample) were excluded from analyses for this reason. 
Given the small amount of missingness, this is unlikely to bias the results. For analyses 
adjusting for age at pregnancy, we performed a complete case analysis, where people with 
non-missing data on age were included. Only 91 (0.1%) of pregnancies were missing data on 
age at pregnancy.

2.9  Ethics approval

The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Brigham and Women’s 
Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

3.  Results

3.1  Participant characteristics

Of the 116,429 participants in NHSII, 76,840 participants completed the 2009 lifetime 
pregnancy questions. Of these, 63,584 participants had pregnancies ≥20 weeks, among 
which 66 participants were missing data on sexual orientation. Among 63,518 participants 
in the analytic sample, 92% (n=58,406) were heterosexual with no same-sex experience, 
5.5% (n=3,496) were heterosexual with same-sex experience, 1.9% (n=1,235) were mostly 
heterosexual, 0.2% (n=150) were bisexual, and 0.4% (n=231) were lesbian/gay (Table 
1). The percentage distribution of pregnancies by sexual orientation was similar. Over 
90% of participants were White and over 97% were non-Latine. The prevalence of each

outcome was ≤5% (GDM: 3.2–4.2%, gHTN: 2.7–4.3%, and preeclampsia: 3.4–5.4%). The 
66 participants missing data on sexual orientation had slightly higher prevalences of GDM 
and HDP.

3.2  Gestational diabetes

SM participants (with subgroups combined) had a higher risk of GDM (unadjusted RR 
[uRR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07, 1.36; adjusted RR [aRR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.02, 
1.31) compared to heterosexual participants with no same-sex experience (Table 2). When 
looking at SM groups disaggregated, this association was primarily driven by heterosexual 
participants with same-sex experience. Estimated RRs in other SM subgroups were close to 
1. In the analysis of sexual orientation closest to the pregnancy, RRs were particularly high 
for bisexual participants (uRR 1.32, 95% CI 0.66, 2.65; aRR 1.37, 95% CI 0.68, 2.76).

3.3  Gestational hypertension

SM participants (subgroups combined) had a moderately higher risk of gHTN compared to 
heterosexual participants with no same-sex experience (Table 3). In the subgroup analysis, 
the RRs ranged from 31% to 42% for mostly heterosexual, bisexual, and lesbian/gay 
participants. In the analysis of sexual orientation closest to pregnancy, RRs were high in 
magnitude for bisexual (27% higher) and lesbian/gay (twice as high) participants compared 
to heterosexual participants.

3.4  Preeclampsia

We did not observe differences in risk of preeclampsia by sexual orientation (Table 4). 
Notably, in the subgroup analysis, RRs were high for the bisexual group in the analysis 
with all pregnancies. We observed RRs >1 in the analysis with sexual orientation closest to 
pregnancy in the bisexual group.

3.5  Stratified RRs by race and ethnicity

Compared to doubly-privileged White non-Latine heterosexual participants with no same-
sex experience, we observed a 46% higher risk of GDM among participants minoritized by 
race/ethnicity only (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.28, 1.67), 20% higher risk among those minoritized 
by sexual orientation only (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06, 1.37), and 59% higher risk among those 
who were doubly minoritized by race/ethnicity and sexual orientation (RR 1.59, 95% CI 
1.12, 2.24) (Table 5). Furthermore, racial/ethnic minority heterosexual participants with no 
same-sex experience had a moderately higher risk of preeclampsia and non-Latine White 
SM participants had an moderately higher risk of gHTN compared to non-Latine White 
heterosexual participants with no same-sex experience. Other RRs were close to the null 
value of 1.

sexual orientation disparities in GDM and HDP. We observed a 31% higher risk of

gHTN among mostly heterosexual participants and 31% higher risk of GDM among 
heterosexual participants with same-sex experience compared to heterosexual participants 
with no same-sex experience. Using the classification closest to pregnancy, lesbian/gay 
participants had twice the risk of gHTN compared to heterosexual participants with no 
same-sex experience. We also observed elevated risk in other SM subgroups. Our findings 
highlight the importance of measuring all three dimensions of sexual orientation as different 
dimensions may lead to varied outcomes.

4.2  Strengths of the study

This is one of the few studies to examine disparities in GDM/HDP and one of the first 
studies using all three dimensions of sexual orientation to examine these outcomes. Another 
major strength is that we had complete ascertainment of pregnancies across the reproductive 
years in a non-clinical sample of participants living across the U.S.

4.3  Limitations of the data

The sample was relatively homogenous in race/ethnicity, and has higher levels of health 
literacy compared to the general population, consisting of mostly non-Latine White nurses. 
Despite the nuanced measures of sexual orientation included in the study, we did not have 
data on some SM groups, such as people with an asexual or Two-Spirit identity; thus, 
future studies should include a more expansive set of identity options.37 Additionally, pre-
pregnancy history of hypertension and diabetes were not assessed in the same questionnaire 
as the pregnancies, and thus, we could not accurately exclude those with a history of 
these conditions. Therefore, the outcomes may include not only new-onset GDM/HDP, 
but also chronic hypertension/diabetes or superimposed preeclampsia (preeclampsia with 
pre-existing high blood pressure/chronic hypertension).

4.4 

Interpretation

Previous research on sexual orientation disparities in GDM and HDP is limited. The few 
existing studies have shown results suggestive of disparities.19,20 One study using delivery 
hospitalization discharge data linked to birth certificate data from California revealed a 
significantly higher risk of HDP in mother-mother partnerships compared to mother-father 
partnerships: 90% higher risk of preeclampsia with severe features or eclampsia, and 80% 
higher risk of gHTN or preeclampsia without severe features.19 These associations were 
attenuated to 10% higher for both outcomes after adjustment of covariates, many of which 
the authors identified as mediators in the relationship between sexual orientation and adverse 
obstetrical outcomes. The study found no differences in risk of GDM. Our study improves 
on this study by including multidimensional measures of sexual orientation.

Another study used the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health to 
examine the impact of sexual orientation-related non-discrimination laws on gHTN by 
sexual orientation and race/ethnicity; the results demonstrated that the risk of gHTN 
among SM was primarily a function of the structural stigma environment.20 Thus, future 
research should examine variation in disparities in pregnancy morbidities by state policy 
contexts. Some studies have found that in states with low sexual orientation-based structural 
stigma exposure, SM individuals actually report better birth outcomes than heterosexual

environment.

Depending on the measure of sexual orientation we used—sexual orientation identity closest 
to pregnancy that uses a three-category identity measure, versus the more recent measures 
with increased identity options and measures of same-sex attractions and partners—the 
results changed. We were limited in how sexual orientation could be analysed because 
the 1995 and 2009 measures—which were closer to when the pregnancies occurred—were 
not detailed. The detailed 2017 measures were asked of participants several years after 
the participants’ pregnancies. Each classification method we presented in this analysis has 
advantages and disadvantages. In our primary classification method, which used the more 
detailed recent measures of sexual orientation, participants would have had to survive to 
answer these more detailed questions. We know that outcomes such as GDM, gHTN, and 
preeclampsia are associated with pregnancy-related mortality. To account for this, we (1) 
supplemented the 2017 identity measures with the 1995/2009 identity measures if the 2017 
measure was missing and (2) included the heterosexual group with missing information 
about attractions and partners in the reference group (though we note that this induces 
some misclassification of SM participants in the reference group, which would lead to an 
underestimation of the disparity).

In our analysis using sexual identity closest to the pregnancy, we lost information about 
several participants who would have endorsed a SM identity due to the limited response 
options (heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian/gay) or reduced comfort disclosing a SM identity 
in the 1990s and 2000s. For example, research shows that “mostly heterosexual” is a 
separate and distinct sexual orientation identity.30 Additionally, many heterosexual people 
report same-sex partners or attractions.21 Thus, the secondary classification method of 
sexual orientation underestimates disparities in pregnancy outcomes among some SM 
populations due to inclusion of mostly heterosexual people and heterosexual people with 
same-sex partners or attractions in the reference group. Despite the limitations in how 
sexual orientation was measured, the NHSII is one of the few large national cohorts with 
identity-, attraction-, and behaviour-based measures of sexual orientation, providing novel 
contributions to the pregnancy literature.

Sexual orientation measures should not only be detailed and multidimensional, but also 
collected at multiple time points. Sexual orientation is fluid—that is, people may experience 
changes in how they identify, who they are attracted to, and who they have sex with over 
time.39 Changes in societal acceptance of and social policies affecting SM can also affect 
how people disclose their sexual orientation. For example, in the NHSII cohort, people 
living in states that recognized same-sex relationships were more likely to change their 
reported sexual orientation from heterosexual in 1995 to a SM identity in 2009, compared 
to people living in states without recognition of same-sex relationships.31 Participants 
increasingly endorsed SM identities in the 2017 questionnaire, as more identity options 
were included. The 2017 questionnaire also occurred after major policy shifts, including 
the 2015 Obergefell vs. Hodges decision by the US Supreme Court expanding marriage 
rights for same-sex couples nationwide and the 2017 Pavan vs. Smith decision allowing 
both members of a same-sex couple to be listed as the parent on a child’s birth certificate.

Thus, even though the 2017 sexual orientation measure occurred after the pregnancies, 
if more SM participants felt more comfortable disclosing a SM identity in the 2017 
measure, our primary classification using the 2017 questions (which incorporated lifetime 
identities) may have better accounted for some of the chronic health effects stemming from 
minority stress, though this is imperfect. Thus, given the aforementioned challenges, and 
given the heterogeneity of SM populations in their experiences and health outcomes, we 
urge researchers to include multiple, multidimensional measures of sexual orientation in 
longitudinal datasets to capture pregnancy-related disparities accurately and precisely in 
specific SM subgroups.

Furthermore, there is a great need for more research on the disparities experienced by 
populations that are multiply minoritized by sexual orientation and race/ethnicity—in 
addition to other axes of minoritization such as ability status, gender, nativity status, etc.
—using an intersectionality framework. In the present study, we did not have the statistical 
power to examine effect modification of sexual orientation by race/ethnicity on GDM, 
gHTN, or preeclampsia; thus, we only presented stratified RRs by sexual orientation 
and race/ethnicity as a preliminary exploration into varied pregnancy outcomes among 
White SM people compared to SM people of colour. Intersectionality is a framework for 
understanding how social identities (e.g., race/ethnicity and sexual orientation) interact to 
create different levels of oppression and privilege based on interlocking systems of power 
(e.g., racism and heterosexism).22 With the exception of a few studies,40–43 most research 
has not examined reproductive health experiences among those who are multiply minoritized 
by sexual orientation and race/ethnicity. Because the NHSII cohort is racially homogenous 
and due to small cell sizes in sexual orientation subgroups, we had to dichotomize race/
ethnicity and sexual orientation. However, given that the sexual orientation and racial/ethnic 
groups are heterogeneous, the combined estimates are hard to interpret. Furthermore, even 
though the NHSII cohort is a uniquely large cohort, we would practically need an even 
larger sample size to have adequate power to assess effect modification. For example, 
based on our stratified RR estimates for GDM, we would have needed a sample size of 
over 27.4 million pregnancies to detect an additive interaction. In the general population 
today, assuming 20% of the population is SM44 and 41% is non-Latine White,45 one would 
need a sample size of more than 2.2 million pregnancies. In addition, to look at nuanced 
sexual orientation and race/ethnicity groups, one would need much larger sample sizes. 
Future research is needed to examine intersectional disparities in more diverse samples, 
and with alternative methods that do not rely on specifying a reference group consisting of 
the most privileged participants. Specification of such reference groups, which is common 
in traditional epidemiologic approaches to present effect modification or interactions by 
different social positions, inadvertently centres the experiences of the most privileged 
individuals (in the case of this study, non-Latine White heterosexual participants), and thus 
obscures the compounding ways that multiple oppressions cause disparities in GDM and 
HDP, as underscored by the intersectionality framework.22,23

5.  Conclusions

Using pregnancy-level data from a large national cohort, we found that many SM subgroups 
have a higher risk of GDM and HDP. Estimated risks were heterogeneous across SM

subgroups. Notably, compared to heterosexual individuals with no same-sex experience, 
mostly heterosexual individuals had a higher risk of gHTN while heterosexual with same-
sex experience had a higher risk of GDM. Our findings also show that the measurement 
of sexual orientation matters, and the use of more detailed questions changed estimated 
disparities, though both classifications demonstrated disparities among SM. Given the high 
burden of GDM and HDP (due to increased risk of future cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
and mortality), and their hypothesized connection to minority stress, future research 
using large geographically representative datasets—e.g., pooling various data sources—
with multiple and comprehensive measures of sexual orientation are needed. In addition, 
elucidating the modifiable mechanisms (e.g., structural barriers, discrimination) for reducing 
pregnancy morbidities among SM people is critical.

Study question.

Synopsis

Are sexual minority individuals at greater risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) 
and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP; gestational hypertension [gHTN] and 
preeclampsia), compared to heterosexual individuals?

What’s already known.

Sexual minority individuals experience physical and mental health disparities generally 
due to minority stress caused by individual, interpersonal, and structural stigma, but little 
is known about whether disparities exist in GDM and HDP.

What this study adds.

This is one of the few studies to quantify sexual orientation disparities in GDM and HDP.

Compared to heterosexual participants with no same-sex experience, mostly heterosexual 
participants had a 31% higher risk of gHTN. Heterosexual participants with same-sex 
experience had a 31% higher risk of GDM. Risk was elevated for gHTN among bisexual 
and lesbian/gay participants and for preeclampsia among lesbian/gay participants.
