Abstract

There is a high degree of comorbidity between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and alcohol
use disorders (AUDs) including alcohol abuse (AA) and dependence (AD). There is some
evidence that this pattern of comorbidity may be associated with poorer prognosis. Although there
are many different psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments for BPD and AUDs when
they occur alone, there are very few treatment options when they occur together. The objective of
this paper was to review the existing treatment options—both psychotherapeutic and
pharmacological—for patients with dual diagnoses of BPD and AUDs and to explore alternative
treatment options that warrant further study. There have been a number of studies that have
examined the efficacy of specific psychotherapies targeting drinking among patients with
comorbid BPD; however, their efficacy in reducing BPD symptoms is unknown. There are also
three psychotherapies that were specifically developed for patients with BPD and SUDs, but only
one of these (Dynamic Deconstructive Psychotherapy) has been tested among patients with dual
diagnoses of BPD and AUDs. Research on pharmacotherapy for dual diagnoses of BPD and AUD
is scarce, and no study has yet explored medication options that can concurrently manage
symptoms of BPD and decrease alcohol consumption. Interestingly, there is growing evidence that
anticonvulsants and second generation antipsychotics, the recent medications of choice for the
management of anger in BPD, may also reduce alcohol craving and consumption. Although
premature, these findings are encouraging especially for this population of patients for whom
treatment options are very limited.

There is substantial literature documenting the high co-occurrence of borderline personality
disorder (BPD) and substance use disorders (SUDs) (e.g., Trull, Sher, Minks-Brown, Durbin
& Burr, 2000; Links, Helsegrave, Mitton, van Reekum & Patrick, 1995; Zanarini et al.,
1998). Evidence for this comes from a variety of sources including data from clinical
samples and the general population. Of the SUDs, alcohol use disorders (AUDs) including
both alcohol abuse (AA) and alcohol dependence (AD) are the most common among
individuals with BPD (Trull et al., 2000; Verheul et al., 2000). Despite high comorbidity
rates, little attention has been paid to treatments for these dually diagnosed patients. The
objective of this paper is to review the existing treatment options for patients diagnosed with
BPD and AUDs – both psychotherapeutic and pharmacological – and discuss alternative
treatment options that warrant further study for this population.

Epidemiology and course

BPD is present in approximately 1% to 1.6% of the general population (Torgersen, 2009)
and in about 20% of psychiatric patients (Gunderson & Links, 2008). According to the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR; APA, 2000), BPD is
thought to be about three times more common among females than males. While this may be
true in clinical settings, community-based studies have failed to find such gender differences
(Grant et al., 2008; Lenzenweger, 2007; Torgersen, Kringlen & Cramer, 2001; Zimmerman
& Coryell, 1990).

Both epidemiological and clinical studies have reported high comorbidity rates between
BPD and AUDs. For example, data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and
Related Conditions (NESARC) suggest that among individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of
BPD, 58.3% also had lifetime diagnoses of AUDs. In this same study, rates of co-occurrence
of lifetime BPD among patients with AUDs ranged from 9.8% to 14.7%. Similarly high
rates of comorbidity have been found in clinical samples. For example, in a review paper of
BPD and AUD comorbidity in clinical samples, Trull et al. (2000) found that among
individuals with BPD, the prevalence rate of AUDs was 48.8%, and among patients with
AUDs, the prevalence rate of BPD was 14.3%. Comorbidity rates are even higher among
female psychiatric patients, with 59% of women with BPD also carrying a lifetime diagnosis
of either alcohol abuse or dependence (Zanarini et al., 1998).

Although it has been well-established that there is a high degree of comorbidity between
BPD and AUDs, the nature of this relationship is poorly understood. Three etiological
mechanisms have been proposed to explain this relationship. The first model infers a direct
causal relationship in which the existence of one disorder leads to the development of the
other. The second model infers an indirect causal relationship in which the existence of one
disorder affects a third variable that in turn leads to the development of the second
condition. The third model infers no causal relationship but rather postulates that common
risk factors may lead to the development of both conditions. The research is limited, but
there is some evidence in support of the causal link model (Siever & Davis, 1991; Zanarini,
1993; van Reekum, Links, & Fedorov, 1994; Links, Heslegrave & van Reekum, 1999) and
the common factors model (Verheul, Ball & van den Brink, 1997).

This pattern of comorbidity of BPD and AUDs is also associated with poorer prognosis.
Individuals diagnosed with BPD and AUDs have worse outcomes compared to those with
either BPD or AUD alone (Links, Helsegrave, Mitton, Van Reekum & Patrick, 1995; Shea,
Widiger & Klein, 1992; Morgenstern, Langenbucher, Labouvie & Miller, 1997; Miller,
Abrams, Dulit & Fyer, 1993). Furthermore, BPD traits are significantly predictive of future
problems associated with alcohol use, even after controlling for other Axis I disorders
(including other current SUDs) and non-borderline personality disorders (Stepp, Trull, &

Sher, 2005). Additionally, the rate of new onset AUDs is at least twice as high among
patients with BPD (13%) compared to those with other personality disorders (6%) (Walter et
al., 2009).

Treatment

As with other psychiatric disorders, treatment options for individuals with BPD and AUDs
can be broadly divided into psychotherapeutic or pharmacological interventions. There are
many different psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions for the treatment of
BPD and AUDs when the conditions present alone (e.g., Linehan et al., 1999; Paris, 2005;
Mann, 2004; Garbutt, West, Carey, Lohr & Crews, 1999; Garbutt, 2009). In contrast, there
are surprisingly few treatments that have been developed or tested for concurrently treating
BPD and AUDs. Below, we present a review of treatments aimed to concurrently treat BPD
and alcohol use disorders/problems. Table 1 provides a summary of the studies reviewed;
only major findings relevant to alcohol use and/or BPD traits are included in this table.

Psychotherapy

A number of studies have examined the efficacy of AUD psychotherapies among patients
with comorbid personality disorders. Although these psychotherapies have been tested in
samples of patients with comorbid BPD or BPD-traits, the interventions were not designed
specifically for patients with comorbid BPD and thus, do not generally examine their
efficacy on reducing BPD symptoms (Nordholm & Nielsen, 2007; Conrod et al., 2000,
2006, 2010; Watt, Stewart, Birch & Bernier, 2006; Nielsen, Røjskjær & Hesse, 2007). For
example, Nordholm and Nielsen (2007) conducted a study in which patients with personality
disorders (PDs) were divided into three groups and compared to a group without personality
disorders. Of the 363 patients, 124 had a PD diagnosis using ICD-10-R criteria (3 cluster A,
77 cluster B, 35 cluster C, 9 ‘other personality disorder’). Two hundred seventy-six (76%)
participated in follow-up interviews; 253 of 276 had been assigned to one of three treatment
conditions at the discretion of the treatment team: 1) cognitive behavioral therapy, 2)
consultation/supportive therapy, or 3) family therapy. Analyses, conducted on a modified
treated sample of 266 including 81 with either cluster B or C PDs and 185 without, revealed
that all treatments were equally effective in reducing alcohol and drug use for patients with
and without PDs.

Other studies have explored modified versions of established AUD treatments for patients
with specific personality traits. For example, several randomized trials have found that
targeting personality traits in brief coping skills interventions is effective in reducing alcohol
and illicit substance use (Conrod et al., 2000, 2006, 2010). In their seminal study, Conrod
and colleagues (2000) administered a 1-session coping skills intervention to female
participants with AUDs and/or SUDs who were categorized into four groups depending on
their personality and motivation profile: anxiety-sensitivity, introversion-helplessness,
impulsivity, and sensation-seeking. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three
conditions: motivation-matched intervention (MM) where motivational and coping skills
training was designed based on the subject personality profile (e.g., a patient with impulsive
personality/motivation profile receiving a treatment designed for impulsive personality/
motivation profile); motivation-mismatched intervention (MMM) where motivational and
coping skills training was designed based on a mismatched personality profile (e.g., a patient
with impulsive personality/motivation profile receiving a treatment designed for anxiety-
sensitivity personality/motivation profile); or motivational control intervention (MC) where
subjects were shown a motivational film and engaged in supportive discussion with the
therapist. Of the 243 participants, 198 women who had received one of three brief
interventions completed the 6-month follow-up assessment and were included for analyses.

Six months after the brief intervention, patients who had received the MM intervention had
moderately higher rates of alcohol abstinence (23%) compared to those in the MMM
condition (11.4%) and significantly higher rates of alcohol abstinence compared to those in
the MC group (6.4%). Similar results have been reported in subsequent studies by Conrod
and colleagues (2006, 2010).

Others, like Watt and colleagues (2006), have found modest but not statistically significant
effects when treatments were tailored for specific personality traits. In a sample of female
students (n=221) selected on scores on the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI; Peterson &
Reiss, 1992) and treated with CBT or nonspecific treatment those that completed the study
(n=148), had high AS scores and received CBT were less likely to report negative
consequences from drinking than the other three groups.

Nielsen and colleagues (2007) developed the Personality-guided Treatment for Alcohol
Dependence (PETAD), an approach that integrates cognitive therapy for addictive behaviors
with strategic interventions for maladaptive personality features. PETAD’s efficacy was
compared against standard cognitive therapy among 108 inpatients with AD over a 12-week
treatment period. Treatment in the PETAD group was individualized based on the Millon
Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI-II; Millon, 1987) categorization of PDs among
subjects who had at least one “serious personality disorder” of paranoid, schizotypal or
borderline PD. Fifty-nine patients (29 PETAD, 30 control) completed the follow-up
assessment and were included for analyses. Compared to those receiving standard cognitive
therapy, those in the PETAD condition were more likely to stay in treatment, and had
significantly more days of alcohol abstinence at their six-month follow up visit.

Others have developed psychotherapies specifically for the concurrent treatment of BPD and
SUDs. To date, there are three such psychotherapies: Dialectical Behavior Therapy-S (DBT-
S), Dual Focus Schema Therapy (DFST), and Dynamic Deconstructive Psychotherapy
(DDP). While all three psychotherapies have been tested in samples of patients with BPD
and SUDs, these trials have been conducted with very small samples, with an average of 7–
15 completers per treatment condition. Furthermore, only DDP has been tested, again in a
small sample of patients with comorbid BPD and AUDs.

Linehan and Dimeff (1997) developed a version of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)
tailored for the treatment of patients with comorbid BPD and SUDs. This modified version
of DBT, DBT-S, includes additional strategies for applying dialectics to abstinence issues
and modified attachment strategies to keep difficult-to-engage or easily lost patients. While
the efficacy of DBT-S for specifically treating comorbid BPD and AUDs is unknown, there
are some promising findings regarding its efficacy for the concurrent treatment of BPD and
SUDs.

Linehan et al. (1999) examined the efficacy of DBT-S in a sample of 28 female patients with
BPD and SUDs, approximately half (52%) of whom also met diagnostic criteria for alcohol
dependence. Patients were randomized to one year of either DBT-S (n=12) or treatment as
usual (TAU; n=16). In addition, patients with stimulant or opiate dependence who were
assigned to DBT-S were given replacement medications. Illicit stimulants were replaced
with methylphenidate (maximum dose of 20mg daily) and opiates were replaced with
methadone (maximum dose of 70mg daily). Of the original sample, 18 (7 DBT-S, 11 TAU)
completed trial. Analyses conducted with the completer sample (those who had completed
6+ sessions of DBT-S or TAU) found that DBT-S patients reported a higher proportion of
drug and alcohol abstinence days compared to those in TAU at 4 and 8 months, overall year
total, and also at a 4-month post-treatment follow-up. There were no significant group
differences on any of the psychopathology outcome measures during or at the end of

treatment. However, at their 16-month follow-up, DBT-S patients reported better social and
global adjustment compared to the TAU group.

Another psychotherapy that has been developed for the concurrent treatment of PDs and
SUDs is Dual Focus Schema Therapy (DFST; Ball, 1998; Ball & Young, 2000). Unlike
DBT-S, DFST was developed for the treatment of a broader range of personality disorders
that are often comorbid with SUDs and AUDs. This 24-week manual-guided individual
cognitive behavioral therapy integrates relapse prevention techniques while addressing
chronic, maladaptive personality functioning and coping styles. The efficacy of DFST for
specifically treating patients with BPD and AUD is unknown, however, there are some
encouraging findings regarding its efficacy among patients with dual diagnoses of
personality disorders and SUDs.

Both DBT-S and DFST appear to be promising approaches for the concurrent treatment of
BPD and SUDs. However, neither has been tested in the treatment of patients with comorbid
BPD and AUDs. To date, the only form of psychotherapy that has been specifically tested
for the concurrent treatment of BPD and AUDs is Dynamic Deconstructive Psychotherapy
(DDP; Gregory & Remen, 2008), a time-limited, manual-based treatment based on object
relations theory, deconstructive philosophy and neurocognitive research. Gregory et al.
(2008) conducted the original trial of DDP with outpatients with BPD and AUDs (intent-to-
treat (ITT) sample n=30: 15 DDP, 15 TAU). Analyses conducted with the ITT sample found
no significant differences between groups during the course of the study. However, there
were statistically significant improvements over time on measures of parasuicide behavior,
alcohol misuse, and proportion of patients needing institutional care for those receiving DDP
but not for those receiving TAU.

Gregory, DeLucia-Deranja and Mogle (2010) conducted a naturalistic follow-up of the
patients involved in their seminal study above. The follow-up assessment occurred 18
months after the completion of the original study, and analyses were carried out using a
modified ITT sample including those who had been in DDP or OCC (called TAU in
previous study—Gregory et al., 2008) for at least 6 months (n=24: 12 DDP, 12 OCC). DDP
group reported significant reductions in the severity of core BPD symptoms, depression and
frequency of recreational drug use. There was, however, only a trend for between-group
differences in their drinking behavior with the DDP group tending to report fewer heavy
drinking days compared to those in OCC. Interestingly, when the 12-month data on the
frequency of heavy drinking was re-analyzed, there were significant differences between the
DDP and OCC groups, such that the DDP group was drinking less compared to the OCC
group.

Summary and future directions for psychotherapy of comorbid BPD and AUDs

Several studies have been published on the efficacy of modified AUD psychotherapies for
treating patients with comorbid BPD traits or diagnosis, including coping skills training and
cognitive therapy. There are some encouraging findings regarding the efficacy of these
modified psychotherapies in reducing alcohol use and increasing treatment compliance.
However, as none reported changes in personality problems or BPD symptomatology, their
efficacy in the treatment of BPD symptoms/traits remains untested.

There are three different psychotherapeutic interventions that have been developed for the
concurrent treatment of BPD and SUDs. All three, however, have only been tested in small
samples (completer sample sizes ranging from 7 to 15 participants). None of the three
psychotherapies have they been extensively studied in patients with dual diagnoses of BPD
and AUDs. Furthermore, of the three therapies, only Dynamic Deconstructive
Psychotherapy (DDP) has actually been tested among patients with dual diagnoses of BPD

and AUDs. However, with only two studies, one of which was a follow-up of the first study,
it is premature to draw conclusions on its efficacy. The other two psychotherapies, DBT-S
and DFST have not been specifically tested among patients with dual diagnoses of BPD and
AUDs. It is possible that they are effective treatment options for this patient population
given the encouraging findings regarding their efficacy in patients with comorbid BPD and
SUDs. Even amidst these studies, however, DBT-S and DFST appear to have only modest
effects on drinking behavior. Further research is clearly indicated for all three
psychotherapies. It will be important for future studies to explore the utility of these
psychotherapies not only in bigger samples, but in samples of patients with dual diagnoses
specifically of BPD and AUDs.

Pharmacotherapy

Pharmacotherapy is a common form of treatment for both BPD and AUDs when they occur
alone. However, since the aims of pharmacotherapy in BPD versus AUDs are different,
there has been little overlap in the use of specific medications when these two disorders co-
occur. In treating patients with AUDs, for example, the main objective is relapse prevention.
Thus, pharmacological strategies generally involve medications that deter alcohol use by
moderating craving and/or producing adverse reactions when alcohol is consumed. The
FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved medications for alcohol relapse prevention
are disulfiram [acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH-1 and -2 inhibitor)], oral and injectable
naltrexone (mu-opioid antagonist), and acamprosate (NMDA receptor modulator).

On the other hand, there are no FDA approved medications for the treatment of BPD.
Nevertheless, psychotropic medications, namely antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and
antipsychotics, are often used to manage the anger, impulsivity and mood lability that are
characteristic of BPD. Of these medications, anticonvulsants, namely topiramate and
lamotrigine, and second generation antipsychotics, specifically aripiprazole and olanzapine,
appear to be the most helpful. Antidepressants, although most commonly prescribed for
patients with BPD, are only modestly effective in managing symptoms of BPD (Lieb,
Vollm, Rucker, Timmer & Stoffers, 2010; Mercer, Douglas & Links, 2009).

Pharmacotherapy for concurrent treatment of BPD and AUDs

Research on pharmacotherapy for dual diagnoses of BPD and AUDs is scarce. In addition,
no study has yet explored medication options that can concurrently manage symptoms of
BPD and decrease alcohol consumption. To date, only two studies have explored
pharmacotherapy options for these dually diagnosed patients, and both examined the
efficacy of alcohol relapse prevention medications among patients with BPD.

The first and only randomized control study was conducted by Ralevski and colleagues
(2007), which examined the efficacy of naltrexone and/or disulfiram for the treatment of AD
in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders. In this 12-week trial, 254 participants with
diagnoses of AD and another Axis I disorder were randomized into four treatment groups:
placebo, naltrexone only, disulfiram only, and disulfiram+naltrexone. Personality
information was available for 225 participants, of whom 68 met current DSM-IV criteria for
BPD. When participants with BPD were compared to those without BPD on various
measures of alcohol use outcomes and psychiatric symptoms, there were no differences
between the groups, thus suggesting that the presence of comorbid BPD did not affect
alcohol treatment outcomes.

Most recently, Mutschler et al. (2010) presented a case history series of eight outpatients
(two male, six female) with BPD and AD that had been provided supervised disulfiram
treatment. Despite concerns that patients with BPD may use disulfiram to self-harm due to

their impulsive nature, no serious adverse events were reported and the overall tolerability
and safety of disulfiram was considered to be good. Furthermore, two of eight patients
remained completely abstinent under supervised disulfiram therapy over their respective
treatment periods (4.5 and 14 months).

These studies provide evidence that relapse prevention medications may be similarly
effective in reducing alcohol consumption for individuals with comorbid BPD. However,
neither study reported on changes in BPD symptoms. Therefore, while relapse prevention
medications may help to curb alcohol use, there is no evidence that they effectively manage
BPD symptoms.

Future Considerations for Pharmacotherapy of BPD and AUDs

There is growing evidence that anticonvulsants and second-generation antipsychotics are
most effective in the management of BPD symptoms (Lieb et al., 2010; Mercer et al., 2009).
Interestingly, the very same medications may be helpful in the treatment of AUDs (Johnson,
2004). Of these classes of medications, most support has been found for topiramate and
aripiprazole; however, encouraging findings have also been reported for lamotrigine and
olanzapine. Brief reviews of studies that have tested these medications in patients with BPD/
BPD-traits or alcohol use disorders/problems are provided below, organized by type of
medication. Major findings relevant to alcohol use and/or BPD symptoms/traits are
summarized in Table 2. Case reports, laboratory-based studies and those conducted with
animals have been omitted from this table. It is important to note that a key limitation of the
pharmacotherapy studies that have been conducted with BPD patients is that the majority
excluded patients with active AUDs. Furthermore, the few that included patients with AUDs
did not report subgroup results on patients with dual diagnoses of BPD and AUDs. As such,
the generalizability of the findings to patients with dual diagnoses of BPD and AUDs is
limited.

Anticonvulsants

Topiramate

Several studies have found that topiramate may be effective in reducing anger, one of the
core symptoms of BPD. Nickel et al. (2004) evaluated the effects of topiramate on
aggression in an 8-week randomized trial among females diagnosed with BPD (ITT sample
n=31: 21 topiramate, 10 placebo; completer sample n=29: 19 topiramate, 10 placebo). Anger
was measured using the State Trait Anger Experience Inventory (STAXI; Spielberger, 1988)
- a self-report measure. Analyses conducted with the completer sample showed that
participants receiving topiramate, when compared to those receiving placebo, reported
greater reductions on four of the five STAXI subscales suggesting that topiramate may be
useful in reducing the intensity of anger, and readiness to react with anger. These findings
have been replicated among a sample of 42 male patients with BPD (Nickel et al., 2005).
Topiramate was well-tolerated; however, particular caution may be warranted in patients
with comorbid BPD and AUD. This includes dosing schedule and medication compliance,
the potential for increased suicidality, fetal malformations, interactions with birth control
medications, and for potential misuse, especially as weight loss agents.

Johnson et al. (2003) first demonstrated the utility of topiramate in reducing alcohol
consumption among 158 adults seeking treatment for alcohol dependence. Analyses
conducted with a modified ITT sample (n=150: 75 topiramate, 75 placebo) found that
topiramate was more effective than placebo in increasing % abstinence days, and reducing
drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, % heavy drinking days, and log plasma gamma-
glutamyl transferase ratio (an objective index of alcohol consumption). In a separate 14-

week double-blind randomized clinical trial with 371 treatment-seeking adults with AD,
analyses conducted with the ITT sample revealed that topiramate (n=183) was significantly
more effective than placebo (n=188) in reducing % of heavy drinking days, drinks per
drinking day, and plasma levels of the liver enzyme gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) - a
biomarker of drinking reduction (Johnson et al., 2007). Most recently, results from an open-
label trial suggest that low-dose topiramate used in conjunction with psychotherapy may be
more effective than psychotherapy alone in reducing alcohol cravings, and in decreasing
anxiety and improving mood (Paparrigopoulos, Tzavellas, Karaiskos, Kourlaba & Liappas,
2011).

The mechanism by which topiramate reduces alcohol consumption is not yet clear. One
hypothesis is that topiramate decreases mesocorticolimbic dopamine activity, and thus
reduces the rewarding or reinforcing properties of alcohol (Johnson et al., 2003; 2007). This
hypothesis was based largely on topiramate’s neuropharmacological actions which include
facilitation of GABA-mediated neurotransmission and blockade of AMP/kainate glutamate
receptors. Both studies by Johnson and colleagues (2003, 2007) provided support for this
hypothesis. It was, however, not supported by Miranda and colleagues (2008), a study
conducted with non-treatment seeking heavy drinkers. Results, which were based on those
who completed the study (n=61; 20 topiramate 200mg, 21 topiramate 300mg, and 20
placebo), demonstrated that topiramate reduced proportion of heavy drinking days but not
self-reported craving scores or the frequency of alcohol consumption.

Based on the use of topiramate in the treatment of disorders characterized by impulsivity,
another possibility is that topiramate reduces alcohol consumption by enhancing inhibitory
control and attention (Rubio et al., 2009). This hypothesis was tested in a 12-week double-
blind randomized clinical trial in a sample of 76 treatment-seeking men with alcohol
dependence. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either topiramate (250mg/day)
or placebo, and were asked to perform two laboratory paradigms that measured behavioral
impulsivity. Analyses conducted with the completer sample (n=63; 31 topiramate, 32
placebo) found that compared to the placebo group, topiramate-treated subjects reported
drinking less per drinking day, had fewer heavy drinking days, had greater number of
abstinent days, and had a significant reduction in self-reported craving and plasma CDT (an
indirect measure of alcohol consumption). These reductions in alcohol consumption were
correlated moderately with improvement on behavioral inhibition tasks, thus suggesting that
the reduced alcohol use was most likely due to the topiramate’s ability to improve inhibitory
control.

The use of lamotrigine in patients with BPD was first reported by Pinto and Akiskal (1998)
in a case history series of eight patients with BPD who had failed to respond to other
pharmacological treatments. Over the course of a year, lamotrigine decreased sexual
impulsiveness, substance abuse, and suicidal behaviors. Other studies have also found
lamotrigine to reduce impulsivity, mood lability and anger associated with BPD. For
example, Preston and colleagues (2004) found that among female patients with comorbid
bipolar disorder and BPD (n=35), lamotrigine decreased impulsivity and mood instability.
Additionally, in a double-blind trial of lamotrigine among female patients with BPD (n=27;
18 lamotrigine, 9 placebo), Tritt et al. (2005) using the ITT sample found significant
improvements in anger (as measured by the STAXI) after 8 weeks of treatment. In these
studies, lamotrigine has been well-tolerated; however, similar to topiramate, particular
caution may be warranted in patients with comorbid BPD and AUD. This includes dosing
schedule and medication compliance, the potential for increased suicidality, fetal
malformations, and for potential misuse, especially as weight loss agents.

The utility of lamotrigine in reducing alcohol craving was first documented in a series of
case reports of three patients with resistant schizophrenia and comorbid AD (Kalyoncu et
al., 2005). All were given lamotrigine to augment clozapine, a second-generation
antipsychotic medication that has been used in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia
and comorbid AD (Albanese, Khantzian, Murphy & Green, 1994; Buckley, Thomson, Way
& Meltzer, 1994; Zimmet, Strous, Burgess, Kohnstamm & Green, 2000). All three patients
reduced their alcohol consumption when they began taking lamotrigine in combination with
clozapine. Rubio, Lopez-Munoz and Alamo (2006) were the first to systematically study the
utility of lamotrigine in treating AD. In this 12-week open-label study, 28 outpatients with
dual diagnoses of bipolar disorder and AD reported that lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy
improved mood symptoms, and decreased both alcohol craving and consumption. Despite
these encouraging results, very little research has been conducted with lamotrigine. The only
other study that has examined the effects of lamotrigine on drinking behavior was conducted
with animals (rats) – the study found that lamotrigine reduced alcohol seeking and relapse-
like drinking behaviors (Vengeliene, Heidbreder & Spanagel, 2007).

Second-generation Antipsychotics

Aripiprazole

There is some evidence suggesting that aripiprazole can reduce anger in patients with BPD.
For example, Nickel and colleagues (2006, 2007) evaluated the efficacy of aripiprazole
among patients with BPD (n=52: 26 aripiprazole, 26 placebo). Analyses conducted with the
ITT sample revealed that aripiprazole resulted in a significantly greater rate of change than
did placebo on the aggressive symptoms of borderline psychopathology after 8 weeks. More
specifically, aripiprazole decreased the intensity of anger, and readiness to react with anger
while improving their self-reported ability to control anger. These improvements were
sustained over an 18-month follow-up period, thus suggesting that aripiprazole may be an
effective long-term treatment option for BPD.

The efficacy of aripiprazole in treating alcohol use disorders has been supported through
several alcohol-cue-based clinical laboratory studies. Kranzler et al. (2008) found that a
single dose of aripiprazole given prior to alcohol exposure produced significant dose-
dependent effects of increasing the sedative and decreasing the euphoric effects of alcohol.
It was also well-tolerated and reduced drinking in a sample of non-treatment seeking
alcoholics, especially among those with lower impulse control in a 6-day laboratory study
(Voronin, Randall, Myrick & Anton, 2008). It has been speculated that the utility of
aripiprazole in reducing alcohol consumption may be due to its ability to break the link
between alcohol-induced stimulation and subsequent alcohol consumption.

The clinical application and utility of aripiprazole in reducing alcohol use and craving was
first reported in a case study of a middle-aged male patient who had been diagnosed with
schizophrenia and alcohol dependence (Warsi, Sattar, Bhatia & Petty, 2005). Since then,
there has been growing interest in studying the utility of aripiprazole in treating AD. In one
of the first randomized clinical trials aripiprazole for the treatment of AD, 295 adult
outpatients with AD were provided weekly psychotherapy, and were randomized to receive
aripiprazole (n=149) or placebo (n=146) (Anton et al., 2008). Analyses conducted with the
ITT sample revealed that while there were no differences between aripiprazole and placebo
in the proportion of abstinent days, the aripiprazole group had fewer drinks per drinking day,
greater reduction in overall severity of AD, and a larger decrease in carbohydrate-deficient
transferrin-a biomarker of heavy alcohol consumption. In a separate randomized clinical
trial, the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole (n=29) was compared against naltrexone (n=28)
among alcoholics (Martinotti, Di Nicola, Di Giannantonio & Janiri, 2009). Analyses
conducted with the ITT sample found that while relapse and treatment-retention rates were

comparable between aripiprazole and naltrexone, patients treated with aripiprazole remained
abstinent from alcohol use for a longer period of time compared to those in the naltrexone
group.

Olanzapine

Several studies have found olanzapine to reduce anger among patients with BPD. For
example, Zanarini and Frankenberg (2001) conducted a 6-month study with 28 female
patients with BPD in which participants were randomly assigned to olanzapine (n=19) or
placebo (n=9), Analyses conducted with the ITT sample found that olanzapine effectively
reduced impulsive aggression, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, and paranoia. Similarly
encouraging findings were reported by Bogenschutz and Nurnberg (2004) in which 40
patients with BPD were randomly assigned to olanzapine (n=20), or placebo (n=20).
Analyses conducted with 35 patients who had completed at least one post-baseline
assessment revealed treatment with olanzapine was associated with significant
improvements in all BPD symptoms, especially anger, after four weeks of treatment.

Other studies have explored the efficacy of combining olanzapine with another medication
or psychotherapy. Zanarini, Frankenburg and Parachini (2004) compared the efficacy of
fluoxetine, olanzapine and the combination of the two (olanzapine+fluoxetine) in the
treatment of 45 female outpatients with BPD in an 8-week trial. Patients were randomly
assigned to olanzapine (n=16), fluoxetine (n=14) or olanzapine-fluoxetine combination
(OFC; n=15). Analyses conducted with the completer sample (16 olanzapine, 13 fluoxetine,
13 OFC) showed that while all three treatment options decreased impulsive aggression, the
two olanzapine groups (olanzapine alone, and olanzapine+fluoxetine) produced significantly
more improvements in impulsive aggression compared to those treated with fluoxetine
alone. Most recently, Soler et al. (2005) compared the efficacy of olanzapine versus placebo
in a combined treatment with dialectical behavior therapy. In this 12-week trial, all patients
received dialectical behavior therapy and were randomly assigned to receive either
olanzapine (n=30) or placebo (n=30). Analyses conducted with the ITT sample revealed that
combined treatment (DBT+Olanzapine) was associated with significant improvement over
DBT alone (DBT+placebo) in impulsivity/aggressive behavior.

Olanzapine’s ability to alter the relationship between alcohol consumption and craving was
first reported by Hutchinson et al. (2001). In a sample of heavy social drinkers, olanzapine
attenuated the effects of alcohol cues on urge to drink in an alcohol challenge paradigm. A
recent study, however, suggests that the effects of olanzapine may be dependent on genetics.
Hutchinson and colleagues (2003) found that olanzapine was differentially effective at
reducing cue-elicited cravings based on individual differences in the variable number of
tandem repeats (VNTR) in the D4 dopamine receptor gene (DRD4). Olanzapine reduced
cravings for all individuals, but only reduced cravings after exposure to alcohol cues and
after a priming dose of alcohol for individuals who were homozygous or heterozygous for
the 7 (or longer) repeat allele of the DRD4 VNTR.

Conclusions and future recommendations

BPD and AUDs are highly comorbid, and this pattern of comorbidity has been associated
with particularly negative prognosis. Yet, there are very few treatments that concurrently
treat symptoms of both BPD and AUDs. To date, psychotherapies used for the treatment of
AUDs have been modified to better serve patients with comorbid BPD and AUDs. Although
these modified psychotherapies have been associated with less alcohol use and increased
treatment compliance, their effects on personality problems or BPD symptomatology is
unknown. There are three psychotherapies that have been designed to concurrently treat
BPD and SUDs. However, only one of these psychotherapies (Dynamic Deconstructive

Psychotherapy) has been specifically evaluated for the concurrent treatment of BPD and
AUDs, and although it may be effective in reducing symptoms of BPD, its efficacy in
reducing alcohol consumption may not be sustained over a longer period of time. In
addition, despite some encouraging findings regarding the efficacy of the other two
psychotherapies (Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Dual Focus Schema Therapy) in
simultaneously reducing substance use and managing symptoms of BPD, their efficacies in
specifically reducing alcohol use have not been established. Thus, it is premature to
conclude whether or not they may be helpful for this population.

Pharmacotherapeutic interventions that target symptoms of BPD and AUDs would be
valuable. There is evidence that some anticonvulsants and antipsychotics may significantly
reduce anger (one core symptom of BPD), and some like lamotrigine have been shown to
reduce other core symptoms of BPD including impulsivity and mood lability. Other studies
suggest that the same medications may also reduce alcohol craving and consumption in
patients with alcohol use disorders/problems alone. Although premature, these findings are
encouraging, especially for this population of patients for whom treatment options are very
limited. Considering the evidence, further study of the role of anticonvulsants and second-
generation antipsychotics is warranted, and future studies aimed at exploring other
treatments that simultaneously treat both symptoms of BPD and AD are recommended.
