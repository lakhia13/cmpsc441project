Abstract

Aim/background: Even though dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has received substantial empirical support in
treating patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), fewer studies have evaluated whether a brief DBT skills
group may be effective in improving clinical outcomes in this population. Further, less is known regarding the
feasibility and outcomes of DBT beyond Euro-American contexts. This paper describes outcomes from a pilot study
examining the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes following completion of a shortened, 14-week DBT
skills group in a sample of Muslim-majority BPD patients in Malaysia.
Methods: Twenty patients were recruited from a public hospital and attended DBT skills groups in an outpatient
clinic. Participants completed measures assessing psychological symptoms, self-harm behaviors, suicidal ideation,
emotion regulation difficulties, self-compassion, and well-being pre- and post-intervention.
Results: There were significant reductions in depressive symptoms, stress, and emotion regulation difficulties, as
well as increases in self-compassion and well-being from pre- to post-intervention. A trend was found for decreases
in frequency and types of non-suicidal self-harm behaviors, suicidal ideation, and anxiety symptoms. Qualitative
content analyses of participants’ feedback indicated that the vast majority of participants perceived a positive
impact from the skills group, with mindfulness and distress tolerance being rated frequently as skills that were
beneficial.
Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that DBT skills training is feasible and acceptable in a Muslim-
majority, low resource clinical setting, and holds promise in improving clinical outcomes among BPD patients in
Malaysia.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental
health condition characterized by dysregulated affect, be-
haviors, cognition, and interpersonal relationships [1]. It
is a challenging to treat condition given its association
with an increased risk for suicide as well as a high rate
of self-harm behaviors [2, 3]. BPD is also highly co-
morbid with other psychological disorders, such as
major depression and anxiety disorders [4], and is asso-
ciated with frequent utilization of healthcare services
and high costs to the society [5]. Among various treat-
ment approaches, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has
demonstrated efficacy in improving clinical outcomes
among BPD patients [6]. Given that the majority of stud-
ies evaluating the effects of DBT were conducted in
North American or European contexts, less is known re-
garding the extent to which the efficacy of DBT (and its
components) generalizes cross culturally. Further, little
work has explored the potential effects of brief DBT
skills training for patients diagnosed with BPD. In this
study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes
of a 14-week DBT skills group in the Malaysian context.
To date, there is a scarcity of research examining the
prevalence of BPD and other personality disorders in
Malaysia. Located in Southeast Asia, Malaysia is a multi-
cultural country (formerly a British colony) made up of
32.7 million people, with approximately 70% being
Malay Muslims, and 22.6 and 6.8% being Chinese and
Indians respectively [7]. In a study involving convenience
sampling [8], 14% of patients hospitalized for deliberate
self-harm in a tertiary general hospital in Malaysia were
found to meet criteria for BPD. In another study, BPD
was
identified as common psychiatric comorbidity
(2.9%) among female inmates in a drug rehabilitation
center [9].

hospitals. Often,

Within clinical settings in Malaysia, BPD is still largely
under-diagnosed, under-treated and stigmatized, even
though anecdotal observations indicated a consistent rise
of individuals seeking treatment for BPD-related presen-
tations
psychiatric
hospitalization is the first treatment option for high risk
patients presenting with self-harm or suicidal behav-
iours. This poses a major challenge simultaneously as
Malaysian psychiatric wards are generally understaffed,
with nurses with a lack of training to handle the com-
plex behaviors of patients with BPD. From DBT’s per-
spective, hospitalizations and use of crisis services may
reinforce self-harm and suicidal behaviors iatrogenically
[10, 11], though there has not been systematic research
tracking longitudinal outcomes following hospitaliza-
tions among BPD patients in Malaysia.

While some mental health clinicians are more open to
providing a BPD diagnosis relative to others, many
struggle with providing sustained and effective treatment
for these patients. There is therefore a critical need for

Malaysian clinicians be trained to provide evidence-
based treatments for patients with BPD, and for research
to evaluate the feasibility and effects of these treatments
within the local cultural context.

Efficacy of DBT skills training
Among several evidence-based approaches, DBT has re-
ceived empirical support in its efficacy in treating pa-
tients with BPD and other conditions, such as binge
eating disorder and treatment-resistant depression [6,
12, 13]. As a multimodal treatment package, standard
four components, namely individual
DBT consists of
sessions, DBT skills group, phone coaching, and consult-
ation team [14]. Despite DBT’s established efficacy in
treating symptoms of BPD and other disorders, imple-
mentation of the full treatment package takes up signifi-
cant resources, due to the multi-component nature of
the treatment. In low resource settings where man-
power, training, and financial resources are limited, im-
plementation of a full, standard DBT protocol may not
be feasible. Therefore, there is emerging research evalu-
ating various adaptations of DBT, including delivery of
components of the treatment in a shorter duration. Of
the four modes of DBT, the skills group has received the
most research attention, given the relative ease of trans-
ferability of the skills, and also the fact that DBT skills
have been found to be key processes underlying clinical
outcomes resulting from DBT [15, 16]. For example, im-
provements in mindfulness and distress tolerance skills
have been found to predict improvements in general
psychopathological symptoms resulting from DBT skills
training [16].

Several studies have examined the effects of DBT skills
training alone on BPD patients [17]. A naturalistic study
found that patients completing one DBT skills group
cycle (lasting 24 weeks) showed significant
improve-
ments in BPD symptoms, depression, and suicidal idea-
tion [18].
In another study, a 13-week DBT skills
training program was found to be more effective than
standard group therapy (led by psychodynamic-oriented
therapists) in reducing dropout rates and improving de-
irritability, and
pressive and anxiety symptoms, anger,
affect instability among BPD patients [19]. No between-
group differences on self-harm or suicidal behaviors
were observed in this study. Another study found that
one-year of DBT skills training was more effective in re-
ducing self-harm behaviors and depressive symptoms
among suicidal BPD patients compared to DBT individ-
ual therapy alone [20]. Both treatment conditions were
ideation and at-
equally effective in reducing suicidal
tempts. Compared to those receiving skills training
alone, patients receiving individual therapy in conjunc-
tion with skills training were less likely to drop out [20].

demonstrated that a 20-week DBT skills group resulted
in significant reductions in suicidal and self-harm behav-
iors and anger, as well as improvements in distress toler-
ance and emotion regulation compared to a waitlist
control condition [21].

While the findings suggest that DBT skills training
alone is effective in improving selected clinical outcomes
among BPD patients, fewer studies have examined the
extent to which briefer forms of DBT skills training (e.g.,
less than 20 weeks in duration) may bring about clinical
benefits [19]. In one study, a 16-week DBT skills group
was found to be effective in reducing emotional dysregu-
lation and anxiety in a sample of individuals with mixed
depressive or/or anxiety disorders [22]. Two studies fo-
cusing on college students with BPD or cluster B per-
sonality traits found evidence for the effects of shortened
(i.e., between eight and eleven weeks) DBT skills training
in reducing depression and BPD traits [23], and in in-
creasing skills use and decreasing maladaptive coping
[24]. Despite the promising findings,
is unclear
whether these benefits would generalize for BPD pa-
tients in a clinical setting.

it

Beyond a focus on psychopathological symptoms, the
field could benefit from examining well-being related
outcomes resulting from skills training. For example,
given the emphasis on mindfulness (and associated skills
such as letting go of judgments of oneself) as a core
skillset in DBT, participation in a DBT skills group may
be associated with improvements in well-being and self-
compassion, outcomes that have been reported across
multiple studies examining the effects of mindfulness-
based interventions [25–27].

Implementation of DBT skills training in diverse
cultural and low resource contexts
Further, as most studies on DBT skills training published
to date were conducted in North American or European
contexts, little is known regarding the extent to which
the effects of DBT skills training (or for that matter,
DBT as a comprehensive treatment package) would
generalize across cultural contexts,
including contexts
with low trained manpower and mental health resources.
Within Asia, DBT skills training has been adapted for
suicidal women in rural Nepal, with preliminary evi-
dence supporting its effects in improving emotion regu-
ideation [28]. In Taiwan,
lation and reducing suicidal
DBT has been adapted for Chinese-speaking patients
with BPD, and results from an open-label trial showed
that participation in DBT was associated with reductions
in suicidal behaviors and ideations, depressive symp-
toms, and BPD symptoms [29].

Several aspects of DBT, such as its reliance on princi-
ples (rather than fixed or rigid protocols), flexibility, and
collaborative nature make the treatment easily adaptable

for different groups and populations [30]. For example,
as opposed to imposing a set of pre-established goals
and values, the treatment involves a careful assessment
and identification of clients’ individual, behavioral goals,
along with consideration of ways in which DBT skills
can be applied towards achieving these goals. While sev-
eral DBT skills such as mindfulness and radical accept-
ance are drawn from Zen philosophy and Buddhism,
there exists parallels between these practices and prac-
tices in other spiritual traditions (e.g., prayer in Chris-
tianity and Islam) that can be drawn upon to increase
the acceptability of these skills to clients of diverse back-
grounds [31]. In one study, ethnicity, education, age, and
marital status did not predict outcomes in self-harm be-
haviors, suicide attempts, remission, or dropouts follow-
ing participation in DBT [32], suggesting that
the
treatment’s efficacy does not vary as a function of these
demographic factors.

Considering the fact that elements of DBT make it a
treatment easily adaptable for different cultural contexts,
we were interested in examining the feasibility and ef-
fects of a pilot, 14-week DBT skills group on clinical
outcomes in a sample of Muslim majority patients with
BPD in Malaysia. Instead of introducing systematic ad-
aptations to the content or format of the skills group a
priori (with the exception of shortening the duration of
the treatment), we intended to evaluate whether DBT
skills, delivered largely as prescribed by the treatment
manual [33], would hold promise in improving clinical
outcomes among BPD patients in Malaysia. Given re-
source limitations (the lack of DBT-trained manpower
resources in the country) and the fact that DBT is still a
relatively new treatment modality in Malaysia, we devel-
oped and tested the acceptability and feasibility of a
shortened, 14-week DBT skills group adapted from Soler
and colleagues [19]. To date, no research has evaluated
the effects of DBT or its components in the Malaysian
context, though elements of DBT have reportedly been
incorporated in an eclectic manner alongside other
treatment approaches based on anecdotal case reports
[34].

Specific aims and hypotheses
The present study aimed to 1) evaluate the potential of a
14-week DBT skills group in improving clinical out-
comes and well-being among patients diagnosed with
BPD, and 2) assess the acceptability and feasibility of the
skills group in a sample of Muslim-majority patients in
Malaysia. We hypothesized that participation in the
DBT skills group would be associated with significant re-
ductions in self-harm behaviors, suicidal ideation, BPD
symptoms, depression, anxiety, and difficulties with
emotion regulation, as well as increases in subjective
to post-
well-being and self-compassion from pre-

treatment. Feasibility of DBT skills training would be
assessed through ability to recruit targeted sample size
within the recruitment time frame (2 months) and rate
of attrition from the skills group. Additionally, we exam-
ined qualitative feedback from patients in terms of satis-
faction and perceived helpfulness of
the DBT skills
group (as an indicator of acceptability), skills that pa-
tients found more or less helpful, as well as suggestions
for future implementation of the skills group in the Ma-
laysian context.

Methods
Participants
A total of 20 psychiatric patients from a public hospital
were recruited for the study. The study’s inclusion cri-
teria included: 1) age between18–60, 2) meeting diag-
nostic criteria for BPD according to the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders- BPD Module
(SCID-BPD), 3) able to read and understand English, 4)
able to commit to attending 14 weeks of DBT skills
group in the hospital’s outpatient clinic, and 5) having
an attending clinician who agreed to assume primary re-
sponsibility for attending to elevated suicidal or self-
harm risks throughout the study. The study’s exclusion
criteria were: 1) experiencing persistent, active psychotic
or manic symptoms, 2) having an organic brain disorder
or intellectual disability, and 3) assessed to be experien-
cing imminent suicide risk (defined by expression of in-
in the past 24 h) during intake
tent
assessment. Sample size calculation indicated that a
sample size of 19 would be required to achieve .80 of
power, assuming a moderate-to-large effect size (d = .60)
and an alpha level of .05.

Procedure
This study was approved by the research ethics commit-
tee of the National University of Malaysia. Eligible par-
ticipants who consented to participate in the study were
enrolled into a 14-week DBT skills training course. Pa-
tients were assigned to one of two concurrently running
DBT skills groups, and each group consisted of 10 pa-
tients. All patients attended an intake session consisting
of
screener
(Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale), and a battery
of self-report questionnaires assessing self-harm behav-
iors, BPD symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety,
stress, difficulties with emotion regulation, impulsivity,
compassion, and well-being (see Measures
section
below). All measures were administered in English, and
language proficiency was assessed by patients’ self-
reported proficiency and observations by assessors dur-
ing the intake session. Following the intake assessment,
participants who did not meet eligibility criteria (e.g.,
BPD,

from the study. The same battery of self-report question-
naires was administered to the patients again within 2
weeks after the end of the DBT skills groups. Following
the intake assessment, one participant dropped out of
the study as the participant relocated out of town. At
the post-intervention assessment, participants
also
responded to several open-ended questions assessing
their feedback (e.g., perceived helpfulness and level of
satisfaction) regarding skills groups. These questions
were administered using an anonymous online feedback
form. Each participant was paid 50 Ringgit Malaysia
(equivalent to approximately US$11) for attending an as-
sessment session.

The sessions were delivered in English by several of the
study investigators (three psychiatrists and two Masters-
level therapists in training), who attended two in-person
DBT training workshops, lasting for 5 days in total. The
study therapists received weekly online supervision follow-
ing a DBT consultation team format led by the first au-
a doctorally-trained clinical psychologist who

received her DBT training in the United States and
Canada. The skills taught in the skills groups included
four core modules of DBT, namely mindfulness (3 ses-
sions), emotion regulation (4 sessions), distress tolerance
(3 sessions), and interpersonal effectiveness (4 sessions).
Each session was led by two co-leaders and lasted for 2
hours. Delivered based on protocols outlined in Linehan
(2014), each session would begin with a brief mindfulness
practice, followed by homework review and teaching of
new skills as per standard DBT protocol (see Table 1 for
an outline of the 14-week curriculum). The skills groups
were provided at no financial cost to the research partici-
pants, and research participants continued to receive other
forms of routine care available from the hospital (e.g., ad
hoc or regular consultations with their psychiatrists)
throughout their participation in the skills group.

Personality assessment inventory - borderline features scale
(PAI-BOR) [37]
The PAI-BOR is a 24-item questionnaire developed to
measure symptoms of BPD. The scale consists of four
subscales: affective instability, identity problems, nega-
tive relationships, and self-harm. All
items are rated
on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (“false, not
true at all”) to 3 (“very true”). Examples of items in-
clude: “I’m careful about how I spend my money”
and “Sometimes I feel terribly empty inside”. Higher
scores indicate higher severity of BPD symptoms. The

Deliberate self-harm inventory (DSHI) [38]
The DSHI is a 17-item self-report questionnaire to as-
sess the presence and frequency of various types of non-
suicidal self-harm behaviors, ranging from cutting, burn-
ing, scratching, to hitting oneself, within the past 4
months. The inventory has been shown to have high in-
ternal consistency and adequate test-retest reliability in
an undergraduate sample [38]. In this study, two vari-
ables were derived from the DSHI: overall frequency of

Patient health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [39]
The PHQ-9 is a nine-item measure administered to as-

ipants in the last 2 weeks. Items are rated on a 4-point
Likert-type scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly
every day). Higher scores indicate greater severity of

Depression anxiety and stress scales (DASS-21) [40]
The DASS-21 is a well-validated measure to assess
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. In this
study, the Anxiety and Stress subscales from the DASS-
21 were administered to assess for current symptoms of
anxiety and stress. Items are rated on a 4-point scale,
from 0 ( did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me
very much, or most of the time). The DASS-21 and its
subscales have demonstrated good to excellent internal
consistencies in a Malaysian student sample [41]. In the
present study, the internal consistencies for the anxiety
subscale and the stress subscale were .86 and .83
respectively.

Difficulties with emotion regulation scale- short form
(DERS-SF) [42]
The DERS-SF is a self-report multidimensional tool de-
veloped to assess emotional dysregulation. It consists of
18 items rated on a Likert-type scale, ranging from 1
(Almost Never) to 5 (Almost Always). Examples of the
scale’s items include: “I pay attention to how I feel” and
“When I’m upset, I become out of control.” The correla-
tions between the original, 36-item DERS [38] and the
DERS-SF ranged between 0.91 and 0.98 [42]. In the
present study,
the scale demonstrated high internal
consistency (Cronbach’s α = .90).

Self-compassion scale (SCS) [43]
The SCS assesses the tendency to be kind toward oneself
in times of difficulty or pain, to be nonjudgmental about
one’s thoughts and feelings, and to see one’s experience
as a part of the larger human experience. This 26-item
questionnaire is composed of 6 subscales: self-kindness,
self-judgment, common humanity,
isolation, mindful-
ness, and over-identification. The items are rated on a 5-
point Likert-type scale (1 = almost never; 5 = almost al-
ways), with higher scores indicating greater levels of self-
compassion. In this study, the internal consistency of the
SCS was excellent (Cronbach’s α = .91).

Personal well-being index (PWI) [44]
The PWI measures the degree of satisfaction experi-
enced by individuals in multiple dimensions of their life.
Participants rate their subjective satisfaction of their life
as a whole and of eight specific domains (e.g., health,
personal relationships, and spirituality) on a 10-point
scale (0 = completely dissatisfied; 10 = completely satis-
fied). The scores on these items were added to form an
overall score. In this sample, the internal consistency of
the scale was good (Cronbach’s α = .84).

BPD module of the structured clinical interview for Axis II
personality disorders (SCID-II) [45]
The SCID-II is a semi-structured interview for the diag-
nosis of personality disorders. During the intake assess-
ment, the BPD module of the SCID-II was administered
to assess the diagnosis of BPD among patients. The
SCID-II demonstrated good test-retest and inter-rater
reliability for the DSM-IV BPD section (Lobbestael et al.,
2011; Maffei et al., 1997). To determine the interrater re-
liability of scores on the SCID-II in this study, two re-
search assistants completed separate ratings for 10% of
the participants. The intraclass correlation coefficient for
two-way mixed model (using absolute agreement defin-
ition; ICCs) was .97 (excellent) for all individual SCID-II
item scores.

Columbia suicide severity rating scale (C-SSRS) [46]
The C-SSRS (Screen Version-Recent) was administered
as a screening tool to assess participants’ eligibility to
participate in the study. It is an interviewer-rated scale
to assess the presence of suicidal ideation in the past 1
in terms of severity (i.e., a specific plan or
month,
method) and intensity (i.e., frequency and duration). The
C-SSRS screener is a 6-item abbreviated version of the
C-SSRS full Columbia Protocol, which has well-
established psychometric properties in terms of good
convergent and divergent validity for suicidal ideation,
and moderate to strong internal consistency for intensity
of ideation subscale [46]. The cross-cultural validity of
the C-SSRS full protocol is well-established [47] and has

study, participants assessed to be at
imminent suicidal risk (i.e., having intent and plan to en-
gage in suicidal behavior within the past 24 h) were ex-
cluded from the study.

Post-DBT skills group feedback questions
At Time 2 assessment, all participants responded to sev-
eral questions (administered online) assessing their feed-
back regarding the DBT skills group (see Supplementary
Information for the list of questions). The first two ques-
tions assessed participants’ levels of satisfaction and per-
ceived helpfulness of the skills group in addressing their
problems, on a scale of 1 to 7 (1 = Not satisfied/helpful
at all; 7 = Very satisfied/helpful). The remaining ques-
tions were open-ended questions assessing the impact of
the skills group in their daily life. These questions in-
cluded: 1) Please describe, in your own words, ways in
which learning the DBT skills has impacted or benefitted
you in your daily life? 2) What are the aspects of the
DBT skills group you find the most helpful, or like the
most? 3) What are the aspects of the DBT skills group
you find less helpful? 4) Are there ways in which the
skills group can be improved in the future? and 5) Is
there anything else you would like to add?

Data analytic plan
Data analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS. Boxplot
analyses were run to check for outliers, and extreme out-
liers were replaced with the next highest score plus one
unit above the score (Field, 2009). Descriptive statistics
were reported for all variables. As one participant with-
drew from the study immediately after Time 1 assess-
ment, data analyses were carried out on the remaining
participants who provided complete data (n = 19). A
complete case analysis approach was adopted as there
was no evidence of attrition bias (see section below).
Given the small sample, nonparametric tests were used.
Spearman’s rank order correlation analysis was con-
ducted to examine the association among outcome vari-
ables at baseline. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were run
to examine changes in each outcome variable from pre-
to post-intervention. To control for inflated Type I error
due to multiple tested DVs, we applied Bonferroni cor-
rection (.05/10 tests) and set the significance threshold
at α = .005.

Next, we carried out qualitative content analyses using
guidelines established by Elo and Kyngäs (2008)
to
analyze participants’ open-ended feedback for the DBT
skills group. We adopted an inductive content analysis
approach, involving open coding, creation of categories,
and abstraction to summarize participants’
feedback.
Two coders independently coded the data prior to
reviewing the codes to discuss any disagreements. Using

Keng et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2021) 21:486 

Page 7 of 12

procedures established by Hayes and Krippendorff [49],
we calculated the inter-coder reliability based on 25% of
all data units and derived a kappa value of .96, which re-
flects excellent reliability. The analyses also quantified
participants’
feedback based on the frequencies with
which each code was endorsed by the participants [50].
Following recommendations by MacDougall and Baum
[51], the first author served as the devil’s advocate to
challenge assumptions made and present alternative in-
terpretations or coding of the data.

Results
Sample characteristics
We successfully recruited 20 patients within the stipu-
lated time frame of recruitment for the study (2 months;
between August and October of 2019).1 The mean age
of the participants was 27.25 years (range = 19–45; SD =
7.67). Of
the twenty participants, most were female
(95%; n = 19). Close to half were single (45%; n = 9),
whereas the remaining were married or in an intimate
relationship (40%; n = 8), or divorced or separated (15%;
n = 3). The majority of the participants were Malays
(80%; n = 16), followed by Chinese (10%, n = 2), Indians
(5%, n = 1), and others (5%; n = 1). With regard to educa-
tion, 35 % (n = 7) completed a minimum of a Bachelor’s
degree, whereas the remaining (65%; n = 13) did not
complete, or have not completed university. Sixty-
percent (n = 12) of the overall sample were university
students. Thirty percent
the sample were
working part time or full time, with the remaining not
employed (70%; n = 14). Further, 70 % (n = 14) of the
participants had previously been hospitalized for suicidal
or self-harm behaviors. All participants were on psycho-
tropic medications at the time of enrolment. Based on
information acquired from medical records, four partici-
pants (20%) had a comorbid diagnosis of bipolar I or II
disorder, and another four (20%) had a comorbid diag-
nosis of major depressive disorder. One participant was
additionally diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder
and social anxiety disorder, whereas another participant
had a comorbid diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactiv-
ity disorder. Mann-Whitney U tests indicated no signifi-
cant differences between participants who completed the
study versus the participant who dropped out on any of
the outcome variables at baseline, ps > .30, indicating no
differential attrition bias.

participate (reflecting an initial refusal rate of 13%). The remaining 39
participants attended the intake interview, out of whom 27 were found
to meet study criteria. Seven eligible participants chose not to enrol in
the study, leaving the final sample size to be 20.

Preliminary analyses
Table 2 presents Spearman’s rank order correlations
among all outcome variables at baseline. As expected,
there were significant associations among several vari-
ables. For example, severity of BPD symptoms was posi-
tively
associated with depressive
symptoms, anxiety symptoms, stress symptoms, impul-
sivity, difficulties with emotion regulation, and negatively
associated with self-compassion and personal well-being.
Frequency of deliberate self-harm behaviors was signifi-
cantly and positively associated with number of types of
self-harm behaviors, and marginally associated with sui-
cidal ideation and difficulties with emotion regulation.

Of nineteen participants who completed the study,
seventeen (89.47%) completed a minimum of ten (ap-
proximately 70%) out of
fourteen sessions. The
remaining participants completed eight and nine ses-
sions respectively. None of the patients dropped out
from the skills group (defined as missing three consecu-
tive sessions in the row).

Pre- to post-intervention change on all outcome variables
Results from Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicated that
there were significant decreases in borderline personality
disorder symptoms, depressive symptoms, stress, and
difficulties with emotion regulation, as well as increases
in self-compassion and personal well-being from Time 1
to Time 2 (see Table 3), all ps < .005. There was a trend
for reductions in frequency and types of non-suicidal
self-harm behaviors, suicidal ideation, and anxiety symp-
toms from pre- to post-intervention, ps ranging from
.019 to .088. Effect sizes were largely in the moderate-to-
large range.

Summary of participants’ feedback for the DBT skills
group
On average, participants’ level of satisfaction toward the
skills group was 5.47 (SD = 1.54), on a 1 to 7 scale. The
mean score of perceived helpfulness of the skills group
was 5.58 (SD = 1.50). With regard to the perceived im-
pact of
the skills group, eighteen participants (95%)
expressed that the DBT skills group had a positive im-
pact on them. Six participants (31.6%) reported that the
skills group has helped them in improving regulation of
their emotions. Three participants (15.8%) highlighted
that DBT skills group had increased their self-awareness
in general. Several participants (n = 6; 31.6%) reported
that the skills helped increase their confidence or sense
of efficacy in handling problems in daily life. Two
(10.5%) participants highlighted that the skills group
helped increase their awareness of BPD symptoms or ac-
ceptance of the diagnosis of BPD. Three (15.8%) partici-
pants expressed appreciation towards the structured
delivery and teaching of DBT skills (e.g., provision of a

handbook and weekly homework). Other aspects that
participants described as helpful included a positive and
non-judgmental group environment, professional guid-
ance and teaching from the facilitators, and peer support
from other group members.

Of all the DBT skills modules, distress tolerance and
mindfulness were frequently rated as skills that partici-
pants found beneficial. Eight participants (42.1%) indi-
cated that distress tolerance skills helped them with
enduring their pain while coping and surviving a crisis.
Seven participants (36.8%) noted that mindfulness prac-
tices helped them to be more grounded in the present
moment. Five participants (26.3%) reported that Inter-
personal Effectiveness skills helped them in building and
maintaining healthy interpersonal relationships, while
three participants (15.8%) specified that emotion regula-
tion skills were helpful.

Meanwhile, participants described challenges in learn-
ing some of the skills,
including mindfulness, distress
tolerance (i.e., radical acceptance), and interpersonal

effectiveness (e.g., DEAR MAN). Six participants (31.6%)
reported that the duration of the skills group was too
compact for them to learn all the DBT skills thoroughly.
There was therefore an expressed desire for longer ses-
sions, or for the skills modules to be repeated to facili-
tate more
in-depth learning of DBT skills. Five
participants (26.3%) highlighted the need for greater
availability of DBT services in Malaysia, including a sug-
gestion for DBT to be a part of government-sponsored
healthcare.

Discussion
This study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and
outcomes of a 14-week DBT skills group in a sample of
20 Malaysian patients diagnosed with BPD. Results
showed that there were significant decreases in the BPD
symptoms, depressive symptoms, stress, and difficulties
with emotion regulation, as well as increases in well-
being
post-
intervention, with effect sizes mostly in the moderate-to-

self-compassion

large range. There was a trend for reductions in number
and types of nonsuicidal self-harm behaviors, suicidal
ideation, and anxiety symptoms. Overall, participants re-
ported a high level of satisfaction with the skills group,
with a majority indicating that the skills group had a
positive impact on them. The skills group also demon-
strated feasibility, as reflected by the study’s success in
recruiting the target sample within the recruitment time
frame and a zero dropout rate. Further, the skills group
leaders were able to administer the skills groups under
regular supervision by a trained DBT therapist.

The present study demonstrated promising clinical
outcomes following implementation of a shortened (i.e.,
14-week) DBT skills group among diagnosed BPD pa-
tients. The findings suggest that DBT skills could yield
positive outcomes, including reductions in several psy-
chopathological symptoms such as BPD symptoms, de-
pressive symptoms, and stress, even if taught within a
short time window. Reductions in difficulties with emo-
tion regulation corresponds with the primary aim of the
treatment, which targets emotion dysregulation as a core
feature of BPD [14, 52]. Specifically, a number of DBT
skills such as mindfulness “how” and “what” skills and
emotion regulation skills could enable patients to learn
to be more aware of their thoughts and emotions non-
judgmentally, and to develop more adaptive strategies to
regulate their emotions.

Importantly, the skills group was also associated with
increases in self-compassion and personal
significant
well-being, suggesting that the intervention might have
an impact above and beyond reducing psychopatho-
logical symptoms. The finding suggests that selected
DBT skills learned by patients (e.g., dropping self-
judgments, increasing engagement in pleasant activities,
and reducing vulnerability to negative emotions) might
enable them to relate to themselves and more compas-
sionately, and thereby experience a greater sense of well-
being. There was a nonsignificant trend in the reduction
of non-suicidal self-harm behaviors, suicidal
ideation,
and anxiety from pre- to post-intervention, suggesting
that a longer duration of skills training may be required
for participants to learn adequate skills to decrease self-
harm behaviors and suicidality, and to modulate anxiety
effectively. Incorporation of individual therapy consistent
with the DBT model (e.g., regular use of commitment
strategies and individualized coaching from therapists)
may also yield better effects with regards to reducing
self-harm behaviors and suicidality. Specific adaptations
(e.g., formal
incorporation of exposure protocol) may
also be required for DBT skills training to exert a larger
effect on anxiety-specific outcomes, as demonstrated by
a study by Harned and colleagues [35].

Notably, nearly 90% of participants completed 70%
(ten out of 14 sessions) of the DBT skills group. With

the exception of one patient who relocated to a different
city prior to the initiation of the skills group, no partici-
pant dropped out of the study or the DBT skills group
(as defined by missing three consecutive sessions in a
row) upon its commencement. The zero dropout rate is
highly encouraging, especially given that past research
on DBT skills groups have demonstrated higher dropout
rates (e.g., 32% for Neacsiu and colleagues [22]). One
reason underlying the high completion rate could be due
to nature of the current sample, in which a number of
patients were highly motivated to receive DBT given that
this was the first ever DBT skills group implemented for
patients in Malaysia. Further, the treatment was offered
at no cost to the patients. Notably as well, the treating
clinicians received ongoing supervision support through-
out the implementation of skills group, and ad hoc ef-
forts were made to reach out to patients and their
individual primary treating clinicians (with the goal of
re-engaging patients in treatment) if patients were found
to be at risk of dropping out of the skills group. In other
words, the DBT skills group examined in this study
might be better considered as a “DBT skills+ group”
given the additional efforts put forth in engaging pa-
tients in the study, despite the absence of formal individ-
ual DBT sessions or phone coaching that accompany a
standard treatment. It is worth noting that the present
sample represents a relatively high risk sample, given
that we did not exclude patients who had engaged in re-
cent suicidal behaviors, and 70% of the sample had a his-
tory of hospitalizations due to suicidal or self-harm
behaviors.

A large majority of participants (95%) reported that
DBT skills group has made a positive impact on them,
with distress tolerance and mindfulness cited most fre-
quently as skills that many patients found beneficial. In
line with findings acquired from quantitative analyses,
some participants reported improved awareness of, as
well as ability to regulate emotions following attendance
of the skills group. Some participants reported that the
DBT skills group sessions were too compact and sug-
gested for longer sessions. Therefore, even though a
shortened adaptation (14 weeks) of DBT skills training
demonstrated positive outcomes, participants indicated a
preference for more or longer sessions. The feedback
suggests that offering booster sessions or repeating the
skills modules might lead to better and more sustained
clinical outcomes, as they offer participants an oppor-
tunity to consolidate their learning and practice of DBT
skills. Also, while carrying out a comprehensive DBT
program may not be feasible given a lack of trained DBT
therapists in the country, institutions interested in offer-
ing DBT skills training could consider engaging non-
DBT trained therapists (as what was done in this study)
to serve as case managers or primary attending clinicians

Keng et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2021) 21:486

for BPD patients as they attend the skills group. This
treatment approach has received some empirical support
in a study involving dismantling of components of DBT
[20]. It was encouraging that patients in this study ob-
served the need for greater availability of DBT services
in Malaysia, and this may encourage further efforts
within the hospital and the Malaysian government to de-
vote resources to support dissemination of evidence-
based interventions.

Anecdotally, the skills group leaders observed chal-
lenges described by patients in learning selected DBT
skills. For example, many patients were living with their
family and found it challenging to practice DEAR MAN
in their home environment due to existing family dy-
namics, such as an expectation for children to be defer-
ential towards their parents. Further, several participants
expressed concern regarding stigma associated with be-
ing diagnosed with BPD. For example, one patient
resorted to hiding under a table when she became con-
cerned whether someone she knew might be outside of
the clinic room when she was participating in the skills
group. While BPD is a condition that is also often stig-
matized in other contexts [53], there may be added value
to address the experience of stigmatization in the Malay-
sian context. Future research should explore whether
other more systematic cultural adaptations (e.g., navigat-
ing the dialectic between respecting parents’ wishes ver-
sus expressing one’s needs when they are in conflict
with parents’ expectations) of the protocol would in-
crease participants’ engagement in DBT skills training
and the treatment’s efficacy.

The present study is the first study demonstrating the
feasibility and potential benefits of a DBT skills group in
Malaysia. Despite preliminary in nature, the findings
lend support to the cross-cultural generalizability of the
effects of DBT skills training, in a context in which the
majority of patients are Malay Muslims, which repre-
sents the largest ethnic group in Malaysia. The findings
also indicate that it is feasible to conduct a DBT skills
group in a resource-scarce setting. The translation of
such encouraging findings beyond research settings into
sustainable models of routine clinical practice would re-
quire judicious resource allocation and investments in
terms of manpower, training and ongoing supervision of
treatment providers. Future cost-benefit analysis re-
search would further build the evidence-base for suc-
cessful implementation of DBT skills group in routine
care. Use of a semi-structured interview increases the re-
liability of the diagnosis of BPD in this sample. Further,
provision of the skills group within the setup of routine
mental health services in a public hospital setting en-
hances the external validity of the findings.

The findings should be interpreted in light of several
limitations. Importantly, a small sample size and the lack

of a control group preclude causal conclusions with re-
gard to the efficacy of DBT skills group. As patients in
the study were receiving other concurrent treatments
(e.g., medications and varying number and frequency of
individual consultation sessions with their psychiatrists)
while in the study, the effects observed cannot be fully
attributable to the DBT skills group. Future research
would also need to rule out the effects of other con-
founding factors, such as expectancy effect and group
support, which may influence treatment outcomes. Fur-
ther, use of self-report measures to assess outcomes is
susceptible to biases such as social desirability and de-
mand characteristics. Therefore, the findings should be
interpreted as preliminary, and future research is needed
to evaluate the efficacy of DBT with a larger sample and
using a more rigorous design, such as a randomized con-
trolled trial and inclusion of objective measures (e.g., as-
sessment of diagnoses
and functioning by blind
interviewers) to assess clinical outcomes. Inclusion of
follow-up assessments would also enable evaluation of
longer-term outcomes following from attendance of the
skills group. Due to a lack of sufficient research man-
power, post-intervention qualitative feedback assess-
ments were carried out by two of the study therapists,
which might lead to expectancy bias among the partici-
pants. However, the bias could be mitigated to some ex-
tent through the use of a self-report form administered
online (as opposed to a verbal interview) to collect anon-
the findings have limited
ymized feedback. Lastly,
generalizability given the nature of the sample as a self-
selected sample of majority Muslim participants from a
large urban city who were proficient in English. In con-
trast to the sample of this study, approximately 50% of
Malaysians are literate in English [54]. Meanwhile, the
National language of Malaysia is Malay, with other lan-
guages such as Chinese and Tamil being routinely
spoken by ethnic minority groups of Chinese and In-
dians respectively. Future research could translate DBT’s
treatment materials into other languages commonly
spoken in Malaysia (and other parts of Asia), such as
Malay, Mandarin Chinese, and Tamil,
to enable a
broader dissemination and evaluation of the treatment
in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. Lastly, even
though a number of outcomes were associated with
moderate-to-large effect sizes, participants’ mean post-
intervention scores on several outcomes (e.g., PAI-BOR
and PHQ-9) remained in the clinical range, indicating
limited clinical significance of the findings. Future work
should examine whether more intensive or longer treat-
ments may yield better outcomes that translate into im-
proved functioning.

To summarize, this study demonstrated that a 14-
week DBT skills training group was feasible and accept-
able in a Malaysian outpatient mental health facility, in

Keng et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2021) 21:486

the presence of strong institutional support and a highly
motivated treating team. The results were encouraging,
as reflected by significant reductions in selected psycho-
logical symptoms and difficulties with emotion regula-
tion, as well as improvements in self-compassion and
subjective well-being from pre- to post-intervention. Fu-
ture research should validate these findings using a lar-
ger sample and a controlled group design, as well as
examine the generalizability of the effects among pa-
tients from other cultural and linguistic backgrounds in
Malaysia. It would also be a worthwhile effort to exam-
ine whether systematic, cultural adaptations of the treat-
ment may improve the efficacy of DBT in this context
[55, 56]. While full mode DBT, when available, will likely
provide even greater benefits to patients with BPD, the
findings suggest that DBT skills training groups are a
feasible and promising first step to address the clinical
needs of complex patients in a low resource public hos-
pital setting in Malaysia.
