Abstract
Purpose  The prevalence of mental disorders amongst children and adolescents is an increasing global problem. Schools have 
been positioned at the forefront of promoting positive mental health and well-being through implementing evidence-based 
interventions. The aim of this paper is to review current evidence-based research of mental health promotion interventions 
in schools and examine the reported effectiveness to identify those interventions that can support current policy and ensure 
that limited resources are appropriately used.
Methods  The authors reviewed the current state of knowledge on school mental health promotion interventions globally. 
Two major databases, SCOPUS and ERIC were utilised to capture the social science, health, arts and humanities, and edu-
cation literature.
Results  Initial searches identified 25 articles reporting on mental health promotion interventions in schools. When mapped 
against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10 studies were included and explored. Three of these were qualitative and seven 
were quantitative.
Conclusions  A range of interventions have been tested for mental health promotion in schools in the last decade with vari-
able degrees of success. Our review demonstrates that there is still a need for a stronger and broader evidence base in the 
field of mental health promotion, which should focus on both universal work and targeted approaches to fully address mental 
health in our young populations.

Introduction

Globally 10–20% of children and young people experience 
a mental disorder [28]; and this is increasing [26]. Addi-
tionally, it is estimated that 50% of adults with disorders

experienced them prior to age 15 [25]. To address this, it 
is important to pay attention to promotion and prevention 
practice, with schools being well-placed to deliver. This is 
because of the amount of time young people spend in this 
environment [49]. The focus of this review is therefore, on 
universal mental health promotion interventions in schools 
rather than those that target high-risk individuals or where 
health education is part of the treatment of a mental health 
disorder.

Mental health promotion and prevention: 
operational definitions

The World Health Organisation [58] defines mental health 
promotion as actions to create living conditions and envi-
ronments that support mental health and allow people to 
adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles. These include actions 
to optimise people’s chances of experiencing better mental 
health. The WHO noted that fundamental to mental health 
promotion are actions that facilitate an environment that

respects and protects basic civil, political, socio-economic 
and cultural rights. Without the security and freedom pro-
vided by these rights, arguably it is difficult to maintain high 
levels of mental health. The WHO argued that mental health 
policies should include mental health promotion and not 
be limited to the health sector, but also involve education, 
labour, justice, transport, environment, housing, and welfare.
The WHO defines mental illness prevention as encom-
passing the reduction of incidence, prevalence, and recur-
rence of illness. Prevention strategies tend to be useful in 
targeting groups ‘at-risk’ to prevent them from developing 
disorders. However, although differentiated, it is important 
to note that the distinction is less rigid for young popula-
tions, because children develop skills as they mature [3] and 
skill development aimed at promoting well-being can have 
preventative effects [46].

Mental health promotion in schools

Schools are pervasive environments in young peoples’ lives 
and can positively impact on their mental health, mitigat-
ing some negative impacts of other social factors. However, 
for some, schools can present as considerable sources of 
stress, worry, and unhappiness [12], which can hinder aca-
demic attainment. In focusing on promotion, therefore, it is 
important to consider the educational context as a natural 
environment in which it is possible to build rights of agency, 
security, and personal freedom in young people, whilst rec-
ognising any limitations this may have.

Schools are positioned at the forefront of promoting posi-
tive mental health. This is an important way of tackling the 
growing prevalence of mental disorders worldwide. This has 
prompted the publication of numerous guidelines and poli-
cies in how this could be achieved in the UK and internation-
ally. Recently, in England the government pledged that all 
secondary (high) schools will receive mental health training 
by 2020 and each school should have a mental health cham-
pion [38]. Similarly, governments in Wales and Scotland 
have produced policies and statements to advocate the pro-
motion of positive mental health in school-aged children [43, 
57]. Furthermore, such thinking is reflected internationally 
as several countries have been exploring ways of integrating 
health and education [2].

Evidently, mental health promotion in schools needs to be 
achieved through the provision of a continuum of interven-
tion programmes. Weist and Murray [55] argued that these 
should focus on social and emotional learning, competence 
for all students, and actively involve young people, schools 
and communities. The authors further argued that quality is 
central, and many factors need to be accounted for:

•  Build programmes responsive to student, school and 
community  needs,  building  connections  between 
resources.

•  Focus on reducing barriers to student learning through 

programmes, based on evidence.

•  Emphasise and provide support for systematic quality 

assessment and improvement.

•  Ensure staff are engaged and supported.
•  Ensure efforts are sensitive to developmental and diver-

sity factors of students.

•  Build interdisciplinary relationships in schools, strong 

teams and coordinating mechanisms.

Weist and Murray [55] observed that for change to hap-
pen, training and involvement from a range of people is 
needed to create a cultural shift in the educational context. 
This is mirrored in other western countries, where involve-
ment of several people is considered necessary for success-
ful mental health promotion programmes in schools (e.g. 
[32, 42]). Furthermore, developing partnerships between 
the health and educational sectors can support meaningful 
engagement and lasting change [50].

Whole‑school approaches

A ‘whole school approach’ for promoting positive mental 
health, recognises the importance of working collaboratively 
with all parts of the school community; students, families 
and staff, whilst acknowledging the impact of local and gov-
ernment policies [18]. Adopting this approach advocates 
that schools should tackle mental health and well-being 
through  their  behaviour  policy,  curriculum  design,  care 
and support for young people, as well as staff, and engage-
ment of parents. Internationally, this has been implemented 
through schools adopting social and emotional programmes; 
for example, in the USA, the Collaborative for Academic, 
Social, Emotional Learning [8], in Australia, KidsMatter 
[10] and the UK, Social and Emotional Aspects of Learn-
ing (SEAL, DCSF, [9]). Where implemented, it has been 
found to not only support positive mental health, but also 
raise academic attainment [37].

Despite the outlined benefits of this approach, it is not 
without challenges. The whole-school approach advocated 
by many authors (e.g. [42, 48, 55]), may be undermined by:

• 

lack of adequate support (in terms of staff willingness 
and/or funding)

•  clarity operationalisation, and consistency in terminology 
used (this would also need to consider how mental health 
and illness are conceptualised)

•  having appropriately trained staff to provide support and 

•  Inclusive approach.

tion of positive mental health.

including social and emotional well-being, to capture an 
inclusive overview of the work that has been done.

Furthermore, recognition of the need to have sustainable 
multi-sector partnership in mental health promotion offers 
little guidance about who the partnerships should involve 
or specific roles of stakeholders. However, it would seem 
appropriate to engage the wider community and include 
families, as well as young people and their teachers.

Focus and aims of the review

Research has indicated that many young people worldwide 
are not well informed about mental health [13, 39, 40, 44, 
47], and there is a clear need to raise awareness, educate, 
and provide interventions that facilitate the maintenance 
of mental well-being in young populations. Mental health 
promotions are potentially central to the solution, and there-
fore, it is unsurprising that many interventions that take this 
approach have been developed.

The focus of our review is on universal interventions of 
mental health promotion in schools, recognising that uni-
versal and target types require different approaches as the 
aim of the interventions are different. This review aims to 
examine advancements in mental health promotion in con-
temporary education, in the context of global austerity in 
the last 10 years. In presenting this review, it is necessary to 
be aware that terminology across the educational and health 
sectors differs [42] and sometimes mental health promotion 
is described as positive psychology (e.g. Terjesen et al. [51]) 
or emotional health (e.g. Kidger et al. [27]). This lack of 
universal terminology makes reviews complex and compari-
sons challenging. Therefore, for clarity our searches focused 
on studies that described interventions as promoting mental 
health and/or well-being.

Methods

As noted, the challenge in reviewing mental health promo-
tion is the lack of universality in language and operational 
definitions of key terms. It is not always clear whether when 
the term mental health promotion is used, it is consistent 
with the WHO definition. Additionally, in education, several 
programmes go under a different title. For example, social 
and emotional learning (SEAL) is often used and interven-
tions designed to promote effective mastery of social–emo-
tional competencies aim to achieve greater well-being and 
better school performance by reducing risk factors and pro-
moting protective mechanisms for positive adjustments [20]. 
For our review, we focused on searching for positive men-
tal health promotion interventions as defined by the WHO, 

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

To ensure included studies focused on mental health pro-
motion interventions in schools we utilised the literature 
to facilitate our identification of appropriate inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Studies eligible were:

(a)  Written in English.
(b)  Published between 1 January 2007 and 30 November 
2017 for three reasons; (1) because there were reviews 
conducted in the early millennium that captured earlier 
work (e.g. Wells et al. [56]); (2) a decade is a sufficient 
time-frame to examine impact and change; and (3) cap-
tures recent policy changes that may impact on design 
and delivery of interventions.

(c)  Universal  mental  health  promotion  (or  equivalent) 
(these should be different from targeted approaches as 
the interventions for universal and targeted interven-
tions have different aims, objectives, intervention type 
and audience).

(d)  Whole-school interventions, programmes, frameworks, 
models, and tools, involving many levels of school per-
sonnel.

(e)  Target population was school age (that is, children of 
any age who are attending school. This spectrum var-
ies internationally, but is generally from 3 to 18 years), 
and included any type of school (e.g. public, private, 
special, residential).

(f)  Original research.

We also provided parameters by identifying exclusion 

criteria:

(a)  Not published in English.
(b)  Not book chapters, editorials or guidance documents.
(c)  Not focused on risk factors or related to these.
(d)  Not reporting planning and development, and not pilots 
of interventions (as these would only present feasibility 
and would not be conclusive).

(e)  Not those interventions targeting children with pre-

existing mental health problems.

Search strategy

Two large database systems were utilised for the search 
which captured the multidisciplinary nature of mental health 
promotion. First, was SCOPUS, a database that captures sci-
ence, medicine, social science, arts and humanities research. 
Second, was ERIC, a database of the literature in the field 
of education. A range of search terms were utilised by two 

1 3650

of the authors to ensure the searches were consistent. There 
were three independent searches across the two databases 
and these were:

to the whole-school framework, but did include school per-
sonnel in the implementation.

Support, training, and supervision of staff

(a)  Mental health AND promotion AND schools
(b)  Positive AND mental AND health AND promotion 

AND schools AND NOT illness

(c)  Mental health promotion AND well-being AND inter-

vention AND schools

The  top  100  results  for  each  key-word  combination 
based on relevance were searched as relevance dropped 
significantly after this point. This produced 25 articles that 
appeared to be appropriate. These were mapped against cri-
teria and narrowed to 10 intervention studies.

Results

When matched against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
a total of ten papers were returned. Three of these utilised 
a qualitative design and seven quantitative design. The lit-
erature was well spread globally (e.g. UK, Australia, USA, 
Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Ireland) and included differ-
ent interventions, all of which were targeted at the general 
population of young people in schools. We organised our 
findings around four main issues: (1) the theoretical frame-
work underpinning the intervention; (2) support, training 
and supervision for staff implementing the intervention; (3) 
outcomes of the interventions and (4) long-term impact. The 
findings were subsequently summarised and an overview of 
the articles is presented in Table 1.

Theoretical frameworks

Most interventions were reported to be underpinned by a 
theoretical framework, but these were variable. Six stud-
ies reported a clear theory underpinning the intervention, 
and two described the theoretical position of the methodol-
ogy; two of the studies made no explicit reference to theory. 
Mostly, studies were underpinned by the framework of a 
whole-school approach and/or a child-centred approach to 
mental health promotion [1, 11, 16, 21, 32], although the 
underpinning theoretical framework was not always clear in 
the way it was described. Neilsen et al. [32] integrated this 
whole–school approach framework in the intervention evalu-
ation with an Action Competence focus, linking democracy, 
participation and empowerment [7]. Franz and Paulus [17] 
utilised the theoretical position of a resource-based con-
ceptual theory, which balances internal and external needs 
and resources (see Becker, [4] [non-English publication] in 
Franze and Paulus, [17]) and did not make explicit reference 

A challenge for any intervention is, in part, dependent upon 
those who deliver it. Notably, seven of the interventions 
were delivered by teachers, although in one case this was 
implied rather than stated. Two of the interventions were 
delivered  by  specialists  including  physiotherapists  [22] 
and educational psychologists [21]. For one intervention, 
the authors did not provide clear details [11]. The support, 
training, and supervision of teachers during the intervention 
was described in five of the seven papers that reported staff 
involvement. For some, training was provided via a work-
shop [32] and for others, through training sessions. Some 
staff had continued support and supervision [29], but many 
did not. Interventions delivered by school staff were also 
reported to be supported by instruction manuals. Most of 
these interventions were described as structured [1, 16, 17].

Mental health outcomes

In reviewing the interventions, all but two clearly reported 
a positive impact. Eight of the ten interventions highlighted 
some degree of impact and argued that the intervention 
was a successful mental health promotion tool. Notably, 
two interventions did not produce such positive results. 
Lendrum et al. [31] reported that the national SEAL pro-
gramme had no significant impact, and this was the case 
in all schools. They noted that there were several barriers 
to  success,  including,  challenges  and  confusion  regard-
ing implementation, staff skills and training needs, lack of 
awareness, reluctance of staff, poor communication and lim-
ited coordination of the whole-school approach. Similarly, 
Fitzpatrick et al. [16] found few differences following the 
comparison of a standard versus an enhanced intervention 
programme for mental health promotion. They argued that 
the difference between the enhanced and the standard pro-
gramme may be too small to have a statistically significant 
effect on outcomes.

Long‑term impact

Although most of the interventions demonstrated degrees 
of success in promoting mental health and well-being, the 
papers were less clear about the sustainability and main-
tenance of this success. The eight interventions reporting 
a positive impact highlighted variability in the long-term 
outcomes, mostly projecting the potential of the interven-
tion and arguing that long-term evaluations are necessary 
[1, 17, 32]. Two of the interventions were tested over longer

periods of 3- and 2-years [11, 29] respectively, which sug-
gested some sustainability. However, some caution must be 
exercised as most of the long-term outcomes in terms of 
mental health promotion were not known and authors argued 
that commitment from the schools and further evaluations 
are required in future. Indeed, interventions that showed no 
change demonstrated that flexibility of the intervention can 
cause confusion for implementation suggesting the need to 
balance prescriptive guidelines and flexible adaptations with 
school culture and ethos [31].

Overall results

This review has contextualised the broader literature on men-
tal health promotion and specifically explored advancements 
of universal interventions in the last decade. The results 
demonstrated that there has been limited advancement of 
this field. Specifically, we have shown that terminology 
remains variable, there is still limited evaluation of long-
term impacts, and there remains inconsistency regarding the 
people chosen to run the interventions, with their qualifica-
tions and training being varied. Like previous reviews in this 
area, we demonstrated that methods used were of variable 
quality, some authors were vague in their descriptions of 
the intervention, and there was not always clarity regard-
ing sources of funding. Somewhat surprisingly, there was a 
lack of digital interventions, using AI, informatics, robotics, 
social media, or internet-based approaches.

Discussion

Globally, there is continued development and implementa-
tion of various interventions in schools designed to promote 
positive mental health, and yet the effectiveness of most of 
these is not well evaluated [1]. If we are to move forward and 
make advances in mental health promotion and help young 
people cope with daily stresses, we need a better under-
standing of the outcomes and possible ways of sustaining 
them. Over the last decade, several mental health promotion 
interventions have been evaluated and were included in this 
review.

Universal school-based interventions have great poten-
tial to target large populations of young people to promote 
well-being  at  a  general  level.  Indeed,  this  is  a  common 
approach taken by schools. Over time, several interventions 
has emerged based on different theoretical frameworks ([11, 
17, 21, 29, 32], to name a few). A unifying factor that often 
underpins or is central to these universal approaches is the 
whole-school approach, or at least an approach that requires 
the cooperation of different levels of school personnel, wider 
communities, and other agencies. Previous reviews over the 
last couple of decades on the beneficial effects of mental 

health, social, emotional and educational outcomes have 
shown that a whole-school approach sustained for more than 
a year is positive for health promotion and prevention. These 
conclusions  were  supported  by  Weare  and  Murray  [53] 
who found that a multi-dimensional and integrated whole-
school approach is needed for mental health promotion to 
be effective and to create positive change in the well-being 
of young people. A more recent review highlighted that for 
positive outcomes to be achieved, any intervention must be 
sequenced in the sense that the activities need to be coor-
dinated, incorporating an active form of learning, focused 
on personal or social skills and explicitly targeting specific 
skills rather than positive development [15].

However, these interventions also showcase variability in 
outcomes, challenges of concepts and ideas, difficulties in 
implementation and attitudes, and issues of sustainability. 
Early reviews by Wells and colleagues [56] showed a large 
variation in type and quality of publications and our review 
demonstrates that the situation has barely changed since. The 
quality of evidence has been appraised as generally low-to-
moderate, with many studies relying on students’ accounts of 
their own behaviour, with some studies suffering from high 
attrition rates [30]. Therefore, while popularity of the uni-
versal whole-school approach is undeniable, shortcomings 
of these interventions need to be addressed. Green et al. [19] 
stated that “while the limited information from the reviews 
makes it difficult to comment on universal approaches to 
mental health promotion, whole-school approaches to the 
promotion of social and emotional health implemented over 
years appear to be more effective than brief class-based 
programmes aimed at preventing mental health problems”. 
However, like previous reviews, our findings demonstrated 
that considerable methodological issues remain.

Challenges of using interventions

The core challenge for successful mental health promotion is 
that most of the school-based interventions reported tended 
to be short-term with little long-term follow-up. Further-
more, they were also often evaluated immediately or shortly 
after the intervention. However, there is increasing evidence 
that some long-term effects are emerging and that although 
effects gradually decrease over time they can remain sub-
stantial [54].

Although some whole-school approaches related to men-
tal health promotion have found fewer advantages than oth-
ers, sometimes this is attributed to a lack of consistent, rigor-
ous and faithful implementation of the overall programme 
and/or lack of support for teachers administering it [29]. 
For example, in a survey of 599 primary and 137 secondary 
schools in the UK, two-thirds of schools adopted universal 
approaches, but gaps in teacher training and support were 
identified as problematic [52]. For schools with limited 

1 3Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology (2018) 53:647–662 

659

resources or those that place high demands on teachers’ 
time, it may be more beneficial that the universal whole-
school approach in the mental health promotion is set aside 
in favour of a smaller scale targeted intervention that is more 
manageable and sustainable. The crucial challenge of either 
model of intervention would be to effectively and consist-
ently engage the learners (that is the young people them-
selves) in development and delivery.

In attempts to bolster schools’ responsibilities for cater-
ing for young peoples’ mental health, funding for schools 
in England has been provided to ensure all schools have a 
trained ‘mental health champion’ by 2020 [38]. By having 
an identified and trained responsible member of staff, this 
may alleviate some of the challenges faced in implement-
ing a whole-school approach. The ‘mental health champion’ 
will be able to act as a strategic lead in implementing inter-
ventions designed to promote positive mental health, whilst 
also monitoring the impact and cost effectiveness. However, 
this raises issues for schools, as training will be central to 
successful implementation, but training for teachers cannot 
tackle mental health promotion in isolation from the practi-
cal difficulties of supporting children who have diagnosed 
conditions [41]. Additionally, while training teachers is a 
positive move to address the large-scale issues, in isolation 
it will not form the solution as it needs to be part of a con-
tinued process supported by greater funding for child men-
tal health [24] otherwise it risks being a “sticking plaster 
solution” to the challenge [45, n.p]. Currently, the Welsh 
government is piloting specialist CAHMS workers to act as 
a link between schools and CAHMS whereby school staff 
are supported to cater for the mental health of their pupils 
whilst also having support in place when more specialist 
interventions are needed [57].

Achieving the goals of mental health promotion, and 
implementing interventions, relies heavily on good quality 
evidence, and yet much work in this area is not sufficiently 
evidence-based [52]. Vostanis et al. argued that there is a 
clear need to improve this situation. These improvements 
could include more effective evaluation methodologies (e.g. 
rationalisation and operationalisation of selected theoretical 
frameworks and models, methods and instruments used), 
explicit application procedure of interventions, and details 
of teacher training and support packages [36]. Evidently, the 
popularity of a ‘one approach fits all’ needs to be matched 
with rigorous systematic development, recognising contrib-
uting/challenging factors as well as application and measure-
ment across different populations, school systems, and wider 
cultural contexts. Additionally, more work needs to include 
the ‘child’s voice’, to be child-centred and respect children’s 
rights, and therefore, there is a need for more qualitative 
work in this area.

Strengths and limitations

This review is not without its limitations. First, to provide a 
targeted and focused message about mental health promotion 
in schools, we have been prescriptive in the search terms 
used to identify the scope of the literature. Given a broader 
search, we might have included papers that have not utilised 
specific terminology in their interventions. Additionally, 
research conducted prior to 2007 was not included, and this 
work may not have been replicated or evaluated since. These 
studies were excluded from the review as arguably they 
may not account for contemporary policy and older reviews 
may exist which evaluate that work. Second, we have only 
included results published in English, and therefore, rely on 
research that has been promoted through English publication 
streams. While included papers did offer an international 
perspective in terms of interventions across different edu-
cational systems in different countries, the sample remained 
focused on the developed world. No papers looked at mental 
health promotion efforts in schools in developing countries, 
which is an area of great significance in terms of mental 
health outcomes for young people. This is probably missing 
from the review due to publishing language barriers and/or 
research not being undertaken in this area as resources are 
often even more limited in the developing world. Therefore, 
the current review and discussion is limited in its applica-
bility to countries with similar development profiles to the 
ones included. However, arguably, factors of effective and 
sustainable mental health promotion interventions outlined 
here could be applicable across variety of cultural contexts, 
albeit untested.

Directions for future research

In their review, Weare and Nind [53] identified that the char-
acteristics of high-quality programmes that were success-
fully implemented include:

•  A sound theoretical base with specific, well-defined goals 

that were communicated effectively.

•  Focus on the desired outcomes.
•  Explicit guidelines and through training, which is quality 

assured.

•  Complete and accurate implementation.

This list of recommendations is consistent with the need 
for  high-quality  training  interventions  in  any  field  [14]. 
Weare  and  Nind  [54]  argued  that  much  of  the  evidence 
related to mental health work in schools would support that 
these characteristics will be beneficial in implementation, 
although the benefits may be small and not sustained, as 
supported by our review findings. The authors, however, 
argued that even change that is small in statistical terms may 

1 3660

translate into a significant impact on well-being and this is 
something that should be explored.

Nonetheless, it is evident from our review, that there 
is still a need for a stronger and broader evidence base 
in  the  field  of  mental  health  promotion,  which  should 
focus on both universal work and targeted approaches to 
fully address mental health in our young populations. In 
terms of intervention development, research has demon-
strated that it is essential to include young peoples’ views 
when developing interventions to ensure a child-centred 
approach and support at a whole-school level [21, 35] and 
thus the co-development of programmes could be help-
ful. Further to this is the need to develop teachers’ under-
standing, competence and confidence in delivering and 
sustaining mental health promotion with their pupils [31], 
as research shows that teachers are resistant to holding too 
much responsibility in terms of mental health and lack 
confidence [34]. Methodologically, interventions need to 
be able to adapt to school culture and available resources 
while  still  offering  measurable  set  of  outcomes.  More 
attention needs to be paid to the culture of schools as part 
of any intervention, as there may be little value in imple-
menting programmes when it is already known that the 
factors needed for their success are not in place at the time 
or are not sustainable in long-term (e.g. if funding/support 
expires with termination of the research project). Further-
more, rigour and quality in the evaluation of interventions 
also needs attention. Programme effectiveness, safety, and 
cost is not always as rigorous and robust as it could be 
[30, 33] and therefore, attention to the quality of studies is 
essential for future examinations of interventions. Valida-
tion tools can go some way to addressing these issues [5].

Conclusion

Our review has demonstrated that there is some success 
for interventions, many of which were underpinned by the 
whole-school approach or similar frameworks. This was 
also the case for other intervention types that were not so 
broad in scope. However, training teachers in delivery was 
important and long-term outcomes unclear. Thus, building 
on previous work, we have demonstrated that there remain 
gaps in knowledge, that there are issues with sustaina-
bility of universal approaches, and that success, to some 
extent, relies on cooperation, training and involvement of 
the schools and the young people themselves. Further-
more, modes of delivery and the nature of the interven-
tions are important and need to appeal to young people. 
This could be facilitated by more scoping work in terms 
of digital health promotion. In a digital age, with digital 
tools, mobile apps, robotics, social media and the internet 

all forming a central part in daily life, there is potential 
to integrate a whole-school approach with digital inter-
ventions, and there is room to be creative with universal 
mental health promotion.
