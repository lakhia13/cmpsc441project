Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the very few mental disorders that requires by definition an
environmental context*a traumatic event or events*as a precondition for diagnosis. Both trauma sequelae
and recovery always occur in the context of social(cid:2)interpersonal contexts, for example, in interaction with
a partner, family, the community, and the society. The present paper elaborates and extends the social(cid:2)
interpersonal framework model of PTSD. This was developed to complement other intrapersonally focused
models of PTSD, which emphasize alterations in an individual’s memory, cognitions, or neurobiology. Four
primary reasons for broadening the perspective from the individual to the interpersonal(cid:2)societal contexts are
discussed. The three layers of the model (social affects, close relationships, and culture and society) are outlined.
We further discuss additional insights and benefits of the social(cid:2)interpersonal perspective for the growing
field of research regarding resilience after traumatic experiences. The paper closes with an outlook on therapy
approaches and interventions considering this broader social(cid:2)interpersonal perspective on PTSD.

Within the traditional professional perspective of

clinical psychology and psychiatry, posttrau-
matic stress disorder (PTSD) is usually con-
sidered solely in terms of the individual. Approaches that
aim to describe, explain, or treat PTSD or other stress-
and trauma-related disorders center on the patient and do
not consider the social context in which they are situated
(e.g., families, partners, close friends, communities, or even
societies). This focus on the individual perspective has
its value and benefits. This is particularly evident when we
consider the progress in evidence-based treatments for
PTSD over the last 20 years. However, this individual-
centered perspective also leaves out a host of potential
influential factors external to the individual. The influence
of family members, peers, and the society at large all have
an impact on the development and maintenance of the
individual’s PTSD symptoms. Thus, focusing only on the
individual when treating PTSD may not be enough to

ensure an optimal chance of recovery. In reaction to this,
some prominent researchers have sought to question
or broaden the individual-centered approach to explain
and treat PTSD (Ajdukovic´ & Ajdukovic´, 2003;
Somasundaram, 2014; Summerfield, 1999). In a previous
theoretical and review paper, our group (Maercker &
Horn, 2013) developed a framework model on social(cid:2)
interpersonal processes in PTSD to complement the other
existing models of memory or neurobiological dysfunc-
tions in PTSD. The present paper will further elaborate the
theory of our social(cid:2)interpersonal model, with the addition
of new findings, and present some applications for both
clinical and psychosocial work with survivors of trauma.

Broadening the focus on trauma survivors
There are several reasons to expand the study of trauma*
both theoretical and clinical: 1) the philosophical view
that humans are social beings; 2) the well-articulated

view that often entire societies rather than individuals are
traumatized; 3) the occurrence of traumatic stress on a
global scale; and 4) the improved but still limited effec-
tiveness of individualized psychotherapies for PTSD.

Many diverse philosophical theories converge upon the
same fundamental insight that the social, or interpersonal
realm, is a central element of human nature (Aristotle,
1999; Ricoeur, 2005). This is implicit in any considera-
tion of mental disorders, mental health, and psychologi-
cal well-being. As human beings, we can be individual
agents, acting independently as well as group members
(e.g., family, neighborhood, society), acting interdepen-
dently. Whether we act independently or interdepen-
dently varies depending on different factors, for example,
historical era, culture, and individual
life-span phase.
Interdependent psychological
functioning, defined as
the degree to which members of the group are mutually
dependent on the others, has recently gained increased
attention in social psychology and psychiatry, indicating
a broad range of neurobiological and psychological
covariation of this distinction (Han & Ma, 2014). Even
in individualistic European or Westernized societies,
the degree of sociality or interdependence should not
be neglected*and this is particularly true for PTSD.
A landmark meta-analysis demonstrated this finding
that ‘‘(perceived) social support’’ as the most important
variable was negatively related to PTSD symptom severity
(Brewin et al., 2000). This relation was replicated for both
perceived and received social support in another meta-
analysis (Prati & Pietrantoni, 2010).

The term ‘‘traumatized societies’’ has received more
attention in recent research. It is defined as a large social
group sharing the same geographical territory and do-
minant cultural values that have experienced genocide,
war, or other extensive violence, so that the majority of
the society’s members experienced exposure to extremely
threatening or horrific events. An incomplete list of such
societies includes the territory or at least larger parts
of Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Chechnya, Demo-
cratic Republic of Congo, Eastern Ukraine, Eritrea, etc.
This term has also been used for populations that have
either survived historical trauma, or are descended from
those who have, for example, Jewish Holocaust survivors,
Native Americans, and Apartheid witnesses. Several
authors, however, questioned the usefulness of the term
‘‘traumatized societies’’, for example, because it is often
used too unspecifically, without giving detailed descrip-
tions of its characteristics (Bruner, 2014). Large-scale
trauma may also lead to disruption of the very fabric of
a society (e.g., dismantling of institutions, displacement
of potential support networks). Therefore, a cautious
consideration of broad- or long-lasting effects of trauma
should include the societal context as well.

Data from international aid organizations [related to
United Nations (UN) or non-governmental organizations]
indicate that traumatic events are ubiquitous. Every
minute approximately 10 children die due to hunger
and malnutrition, which sums up to 6 million deceased
children per year (UNICEF, 2012); the daily death toll due
to violent conflict around the world sums up to around 500
persons (www.crisisgroup.org); and in the first 6 months
of 2015, around 2,500 individuals died by drowning in the
Mediterranean Sea while trying to reach Europe from
the North African coast (Amnesty International, 2015).
All these deceased have close family and friends who most
probably mourn their deaths and may have simultaneously
experienced what the trauma criterion in DSM-5 and
ICD-10 define as traumatization by witnessing. Altogether,
this would entail there being millions of traumatized
individuals, particularly in war-torn countries and regions.
A growing amount of research has highlighted a sub-
stantial gap, particularly in resource-poor countries,
between the burden caused by mental disorders and
the resources devoted to prevent and treat them (Collins,
Insel, Chockalingam, Daar, & Maddox, 2013). The con-
sequence is that more than 75% of people with trauma-
related and other mental health disorders do not receive
any official mental health care at all in these countries. It
is unlikely that individual trauma-focused therapy could
be mobilized to deal with this great number of trauma
survivors for a number of reasons, for example, lack of
trained therapists, lack of resources, and lack of a mental
health care infrastructure. Therefore, the World Health
Organization (WHO) increasingly advocates for larger
scale programs in post-conflict regions, targeting whole
communities or whole societies (Epping-Jordan et al.,
2015; Tol et al., 2014).

In the developed countries, with their contemporary
standards of mental health sciences and service oppor-
tunities, PTSD and related disorders can be treated in
the majority of patients suffering from these conditions.
An enthusiastic and tremendously inventive community
of scientists and practitioners has developed effective
treatment approaches for PTSD, as indicated, for exam-
ple, by prominent publications by the International and
the European Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (Foa,
Keane, Friedman, & Cohen, 2008; Olff et al., 2015;
Schnyder et al., 2015). However, we also know that up to
40% of our traumatized patients nevertheless do not reap
all the benefits from our individualized PTSD therapies
(Bradley, Greene, Russ, Dutra, & Westen, 2014). Current
treatment guidelines only adhere to treatments targeted
to modify individual dysfunctions in memory, cognition,
or affect. However, there are few new approaches aimed
at facilitating social support or restructuring commu-
nities or societies (see closing section of this article for
more detail).

The social(cid:2)interpersonal framework model

of PTSD
It is vital to understand how all the various interpersonal
and social factors relevant for the development and main-
tenance of PTSD fit together. To achieve this, Maercker
and Horn (2013) developed a model as an explanatory
framework. It consists of factors that determine how
traumatic stress is mitigated or intensified by different
layers of person(cid:2)environment interactions. The simplified
structure is shown in Fig. 1 (a more detailed version of
this figure is given in Maercker & Horn, 2013). The model
describes three layers: 1) social affects comprising shame,
guilt, anger, revenge, etc.; 2) close relationships including
trauma disclosure, social support or negative exchange,
empathy, etc.; and 3) culture and society, comprising
aspects like the collective experience of trauma, social
acknowledgment as victim or survivor, cultural value
orientation, etc.

Social affects
The first level of social affects comprises well-described
modes of action tendencies and interactive styles of
traumatized persons. Affective reactions that relate to
other persons, groups, or communities are termed ‘‘social
affects’’ (Hareli & Parkinson, 2008). For example, guilt is
generally considered to function for its own immediate
relief. However, chronic guilty feelings contribute to
the maintenance of psychopathology in the long run
(Rachman, 1993). The functionality of shame in the
context of PTSD is still unclear. Shame has been demon-
strated to be strongly related to intrapersonal avoidance
(Street, Gibson, & Holohan, 2005). Furthermore, it is
plausible that shame is related to social withdrawal (for
more details, see Maercker & Horn, 2013). Whereas
posttraumatic shame and guilt have been investigated
frequently, other social affects, such as anger or aggres-

Social(cid:2)interpersonal perspective on PTSD

sion, have received little attention despite their common
manifestation in trauma survivors. In continuation of
Maercker and Horn’s (2013) descriptions, we focus here
on recent findings on anger and aggression in trauma
survivors. The association between PTSD and interperso-
nal aggression is a robust finding in the literature. When
a person experiences repeated and constant threats to
their life, this person may develop cognitive networks
that guide cognitions, emotions, and actions in order to
increase chances of survival (Elbert & Schauer, 2002).
Although being highly alert and aroused in dangerous
situations has survival advantages, in situations where
threat to life is low, it can produce inappropriate and
aggressive behavior. High PTSD symptom severity was,
for example, associated with reactive aggression*an
aggressive reaction to some perceived provocation or
threat*in survivors of hurricane Katrina (Marsee, 2008)
or in veterans (Byrne & Riggs, 1996). A meta-analysis of
31 studies on the association between PTSD and intimate
relationship discord found medium-size associations
between PTSD and interpersonal physical and psycholo-
gical aggression, with trait anger mediating this relation-
ship (Taft, Watkins, Stafford, Street, & Monson, 2011).

Furthermore,

it has been repeatedly shown that a
person’s own experiences of childhood maltreatment and
their own victimization through intimate partner violence
predict aggressive parenting behavior (Saile, Ertl, Neuner,
& Catani, 2014). These findings provide further evidence
that exposure to trauma and violence in the past is
associated with the display of aggressive behavior and
former child soldiers who
violence. Correspondingly,
have been frequently exposed to severe violence also
perpetrated more types of violence (Weierstall, Schalinski,
Crombach, Hecker, & Elbert, 2012). These findings,
however, were not limited simply to reactively aggressive
acts that grew out of trauma-related suffering. Instead,

they reported that exposure to violence fostered appeti-
the
tive aggression. For this subtype of aggression,
infliction of harm upon an individual is itself reward-
ing, fascinating, and a source of enjoyment *above and
beyond secondary rewards like status or material benefits
(Hecker, Hermenau, Maedl, Elbert, & Schauer, 2012). In
environments dominated by violence, exposure to violence
and other traumatic stressors have been linked to appeti-
tive aggression and encouraged violent behavior, thereby
creating a cycle of violence (Hecker, Fetz, Ainamani, &
Elbert, 2015). Developing appetitive aggression seems to
be an adaptive survival strategy for children growing up
in such violent environments (Hermenau, Hecker, Maedl,
Schauer, & Elbert, 2013). Appetitive aggression has
been shown to be a major risk factor for future violent
behavior. Therefore, both reactive and appetitive aggres-
sion may hinder successful treatment and integration into
civil society (Annan, Brier, & Aryemo, 2009). Thus, social
affects such as anger, aggression, and revenge need to be
addressed to enable trauma survivors to fully reintegrate
into their society.

Close relationships
The second layer comprises trauma-relevant processes in
close relationships of the survivors. Disclosure of trau-
matic experiences is a phenomenon that deserves parti-
cular attention. If a trauma survivor is able to share
parts or even central elements of his or her horrible
experience with family and friends, he or she reports better
psychological well-being. This basic relationship has been
described by clinicians (Briere & Scott, 2013; Gray et al.,
2012) as well as in so-called analog research designs,
that is, with non-traumatized students who were studied
after experimental manipulation as if they were trauma-
tized (Pennebaker, 1995). Disclosure prevents ‘‘oppressive
silence’’, which may extend from close relationships
into broader societal contexts*as already described by
several pioneering traumatic stress studies (e.g., Boston
Women’s Health Book Collective, 2011; Shay, 1994).
Recent research on disclosure in PTSD incorporated
methodological advancements of longitudinal as well as
dyadic assessments. Pielmaier, Milek, Nussbeck, Walder,
and Maercker (2013) studied patients and their significant
others after severe traumatic brain injury at 3, 6, and 12
months post-injury. They measured three aspects of
dysfunctional disclosure tendencies (reluctance to talk,
urge to talk, emotional overreactions) based on previous
research (Mueller, Mo¨ rgeli, & Maercker, 2008). As hy-
pothesized, the extent of PTSD symptom severity in
patients was related both with their own dysfunctional
disclosure, that of their significant other, and additionally
with the interaction between the two disclosure styles.
If both were frank to each other (low dysfunctional
disclosure), they reported low PTSD symptom severity
and vice versa with high dysfunctional disclosure and high

PTSD symptom severity. If the significant others showed
highly dysfunctional disclosure while the patient showed
low levels of dysfunctional disclosure, medium levels
of PTSD were reported, indicating the crucial role of
the significant others in fostering healing through verbal
exchange.

Regarding social support or negative social exchange,
important lines of research originate from PTSD research
on the consequences of natural disaster. Kaniasty and
Norris (2004) describe how initial positively received
social support shortly after the traumatic event*in a
phase they call ‘‘honeymoon stage’’*often transfers into
a negative state of social support deterioration for various
reasons, for example, interpersonal weariness (‘‘pressure
cooker effect’’), need for actual support surpasses the
availability, potential for interpersonal conflicts,
lack
of consensus in appraisal of the event, etc. In a 2-year
longitudinal study on severe flood victims, they showed
by means of elaborated cross-lagged analysis that social
support is the most prominent cause of a decrease in symp-
toms during the earlier phase after a trauma (Kaniasty
& Norris, 2008). However, the causal relationship appears
to switch directions 18 months after the trauma, when an
increase in trauma-related symptoms leads to less reported
social support. This finding strongly indicates the need
for sequentially ordered social interactions and avoids
regarding social support as a self-revolving inexhaustible
positive resource.

Culture and society
The third level of the social(cid:2)interpersonal model repre-
sents the societal and cultural sphere. Thus far, trau-
matic stress responses have predominantly been studied
in individualistic contexts. Yet, whether collectivistic or in-
terdependent orientations may lead to different symptom-
society dynamics remains unclear. In addition to the
clinical and research specifications in the Maercker and
Horn (2013) article, we focus subsequently on new results
on the issues of social acknowledgment as a victim or
survivor as well as on human value orientation changes.
Social or societal acknowledgment as a victim is assumed
to be particularly relevant for survivors of man-made
trauma; it is close to the restorative justice perception of
persons trying to overcome the traumatic disruption
of their lives (Sullivan & Tifft, 2007). Maercker and
Mu¨ ller (2004) have developed a 16-item questionnaire
measuring the three independent subscales of recognition,
family disapproval, and general disapproval. Studies
with this questionnaire were conducted, for example, with
war victims in Poland, Germany, Indonesia, and the
USA (e.g., Lis-Turlejska, Szumial, & Okuniewska, 2012;
Schumm, Koucky, & Bartel, 2014), refugees (Maercker,
Povilonyte, Lianova, & Po¨ hlmann, 2009); former political
prisoners from East Germany or Lithuania (e.g., Kazlauskas
& Zˇ elviene˙, 2015); and traumatized street gang members

in South Africa (Sommer et al., submitted). Across the
various cross-sectional studies, the correlation between the
total score of self-perceived social acknowledgment and
PTSD ranged between r (cid:3)(cid:4)0.25 and (cid:4)0.45. In long-
itudinal studies, the score predicted a regression Beta
coefficient of up to (cid:4)0.33, indicating a large effect of
social acknowledgment*or its lack, that is, disapproval*
on trauma sequelae (e.g., Mueller et al., 2008).

Human value orientations are rarely considered in
clinical psychology or psychiatry as a relevant phenomen-
on, probably because they are regarded as impersonal
and abstract dimensions. This disregard is unfortunate,
because value orientations span a variety of important
social and psychological phenomena, from intrapersonal
concerns to regulatory matters of the whole society and
culture (Boer & Fischer, 2013). Intrapersonally, values
guide individual motivation by setting goals or proscrip-
tions for managing one’s life. Regarding societies or
cultures, value orientations regulate, for example, morality,
ideas of progress or endeavor, and social order (Schwartz,
1994). Very few studies have been conducted on value
orientations in trauma- and stress-disorder victims. Those
that have been carried out indicate that modern (e.g.,
self-direction, stimulation, hedonism) and traditional
values (e.g., power, achievement, conformity) differentially
mediate the relationship between trauma exposure,
social support process, and the extent of PTSD symptom
severity, with*non-trivially*stronger traditional values
worsening, and higher modern values ameliorating the
health outcomes (Maercker, Forstmeier, Wagner, Glaesmer,
& Bra¨hler, 2008; Mueller, Orth, Wang, & Maercker,
2009). Zimmermann et al. (2014) confirmed this pattern
for German soldiers after recent NATO deployment in
Afghanistan. This is in contrast to conventionally held beliefs
that personal orientations towards traditional values have
in general a positive impact on health (cf. Kleinman &
Kleinman, 1985).

A systematic survey of European studies on mental
health and PTSD (Wittchen et al., 2011) together with
the data from the European Social Survey (www.
europeansocialsurvey.org, round 1, 2002) allowed an
exciting exploratory data analysis on probable value change
after war exposure. In this study, Burri and Maercker
(2014) analyzed national PTSD prevalence rates in
European countries and examined the complex interrela-
tions between this and countries’ pattern of value orienta-
tions, rates of war death (in WWII and the Yugoslavian
wars), and the interaction between values and war death
rates. The results indicate a strong interaction between
these variables and the temporal sequence of association
between war deaths and subsequent value orientations
(measured around the year 2000). The findings suggest
a value change from modern to traditional values in
countries with higher war death tolls (Burri & Maercker,
2014). If this result can be confirmed by other data,

Social(cid:2)interpersonal perspective on PTSD

it would explain the decrease of societal support for indi-
vidual rights observed by various scholars for post-conflict
regions (Ajdukovic´ & Ajdukovic´, 2003; Somasundaram,
2014). This would be one of the most far-reaching con-
sequences of traumatization.

Resilience as application of the

social(cid:2)interpersonal model

Yet, many survivors of traumatic experiences do not
develop PTSD or other trauma-related disorders. Further-
more, the spontaneous remission rate in this group is high.
Therefore, many clinicians and researchers in the field of
traumatic stress studies are fascinated by recent deve-
lopments concerning human resilience. Resilience as the
capacity to bounce back from a negative experience can
be formulated on both an individual (biological, psycho-
logical, etc.) and social(cid:2)interpersonal
level. In recent
research, the former has been more popular, whereas the
latter is often disregarded. However, at least one promi-
nent paper on resilience, written for a broader audience,
the American Psychological Association’s ‘‘10 ways to
build resilience’’ lists a social(cid:2)interpersonal feature as no.
1 in its outline: ‘‘Make connections. Good relationships
with close family members, friends or others are impor-
tant. Accepting help and support from those who care
about you and will listen to you strengthens resilience.
Some people find that being active in civic groups, faith-
based organizations, or other local groups provides social
support and can help with reclaiming hope. Assisting
others in their time of need also can benefit the helper’’
(American Psychological Association, 2012). Yet, face
validity is not always supported by empirical evidence.
Therefore, further research is highly required to gain a
better understanding of resilience factors on a social(cid:2)
interpersonal level.

In resilience research, a leading author in particular
promotes what he calls the ‘‘socio-ecological model of
resilience’’ (Ungar, 2011). This model highlights crucial
aspects of resilience, like facilitative environments, which
enable the individual access to resources, the interaction
of protective mechanisms with exterior risk factors, and a
longitudinal period of record as well as cultural relativity.
Ungar’s research is primarily concerned with resilience
in children confronted with challenging environments. He
argues, for example, that for children from conflict areas,
exposure to violence during war was less debilitating for
their well-being than the separation from their caregivers
(e.g., Solomon & Laufer, 2005). Research on community-
level resilience factors in adults, however, is still sparse.
Maercker, Hilpert, and Burri (2015) applied the socio-
ecological resilience model to a group of Swiss elderly
people with a long-term history of childhood trauma and
adversity. They confirmed the potential of these extended
approaches by showing, for example, social(cid:2)interpersonal

factors outperforming the well-established individual re-
source of high self-esteem in predicting resilience.

Outlook for therapy and interventions
The present paper should not end without a short over-
view on the efforts to overcome trauma sequelae on an
interpersonal and societal level. In brief, the main goals of
such interventions, apart from the reduction of PTSD
symptoms, are improvements of relationship and commu-
nity functioning. In the logic of the presented social(cid:2)
interpersonal model (see Fig. 1), social affect focused
therapies are necessary for its first layer, couple and family
therapies, for its second layer, and community interven-
tions for the third layer.

Social affects
Trauma-related guilt and shame is thoroughly addressed
in evidenced-based individual-level PTSD interventions
(Schnyder et al., 2015). Anger and aggression, however,
have been a particular focus in traumatized soldiers and
veterans, although other populations also deserve atten-
tion. Yet, research on aggression and anger even within
military populations is sparse. For example, in their review
of treatment approaches in military populations focusing
on anger and aggression, Morland, Love, Mackintosh,
Greene, and Rosen, (2012) identified only two formal
anger treatment protocols that have been studied in
military samples, both of which used multicomponent
cognitive behavioral therapy(cid:2)based protocols to address
anger. One study found significant decreases in anger
symptoms; whereas the other found significant decreases
in both state and trait anger symptoms, as well as reports
of physical aggression (see Morland et al., 2012).

for aggressive behavior

Furthermore, Narrative Exposure Therapy for Forensic
Offender Rehabilitation (FORNET) aims at reducing
both symptoms of traumatic stress and controlling read-
iness
(Hecker, Hermenau,
Crombach, & Elbert, 2015). FORNET follows the logic of
the evidence-based trauma-focused Narrative Exposure
Therapy (Schauer, Neuner, & Elbert, 2011) with special
emphasis on aggressive behavior and violent acts in the
past and future. The first randomized-controlled trials
with veterans and violence-affected youths have proven
the feasibility of FORNET and found first evidence of a
positive outcome, for example, recovered mental health
(PTSD, depression),
less
drug intake, and improved integration into civil society
(Crombach & Elbert, 2015; Hermenau, Hecker, Schaal,
Maedl, & Elbert, 2013; Ko¨ bach, Schaal, Hecker, & Elbert,
in press).

fewer offenses committed,

Close relationships
Monson, Wagner, Macdonald, and Brown-Bowers (2015)
give an overview on evidence-based couple and family
interventions for traumatized family members. In ascend-

ing order of focusing trauma or PTSD, they distinguish
four classes of interventions: programs on education and
family-facilitated engagement, generic couple therapy,
partner-assisted intervention, and disorder-specific cou-
ple therapy. The class of disorder-specific couple therapy
for PTSD has the strongest empirical support in terms
of achieving multiple outcomes (i.e., reductions in PTSD,
improvements in relational functioning, improvements in
partners’ psychological functioning). If both the client
and the partner are willing to participate in a dyadic
intervention for PTSD, disorder-specific couple therapy
is recommended, regardless of level of relationship distress,
because these interventions have been tested with couples
across the spectrum of relationship satisfaction. The
authors acknowledge that these interventions are in their
infancy, and additional research is warranted to further
establish the effectiveness of the interventions, as the vast
majority of the work thus far has been done within the
veteran populations (Monson et al., 2015).

Culture and society
it is more
For community-level trauma interventions,
difficult to get a comprehensive overview of available
services and programs that are developed around the
globe. Many of these programs have been developed
by local or regional stakeholders that are not as well
connected as the communities of clinicians or researchers
working on individual trauma sequelae. The WHO more
recently tried to integrate and evaluate such posttrauma
or post-disasters services to avoid uncoordinated and
disproportional aid activities that sometimes sponta-
neously develop after international emergency situations
and to collect systematic knowledge on previous missions
(Epping-Jordan et al., 2015; Tol et al., 2014).

Interventions that aim at improving the community
situation after traumatic events*and that not only apply
large-scale individual
treatment*give people a voice
(e.g., against local officials, their government); encourage
action against deterioration of social support over time;
fight embitterment or defeatism; and facilitate identity,
value, and meaning reconstruction (Linden & Maercker,
2011; Somasundaram, 2014). The following five classes of
programs or services have been developed and applied:

. Post-disaster mental health programs: Developed
primarily after natural catastrophes, for example,
floods, hurricanes, and volcanic eruptions (Norris,
Friedman, & Watson, 2002)

. Community training in critical contexts: Developed
for communities with ongoing high levels of vio-
lence, for example, in US Black local communities
(Laborde, Magruder, Caye, & Parrish, 2013)
. Reconciliation and trauma-healing approaches

in
post-war settings: For example, applied in post-war
Burundi and Rwanda after the genocide (Staub,

. Post-war community-based rehabilitation programs:
Developed in various regions of the world, for example,
in the Balkans (Ajdukovic´ & Ajdukovic´, 2003) and
in Sri Lanka (Somasundaram & Sivayokan, 2013)
. Mental health reforms advocated by international
agencies like the UN and WHO to raise the
awareness of psychosocial needs and improve sus-
tainable services for community members in need
(Epping-Jordan et al., 2015)

So far little is yet known about the effectiveness of
these community-based approaches. Though they are
frequently implemented in war and crisis regions, they
still lack support from studies using scientifically rigorous
methods (Tol et al., 2011). Future research is needed to
empirically test their effectiveness.

It is our conviction that the best care for traumatized
human beings combines services for the individual, his or
her core social group, and the society. The field of trau-
matic stress studies has been very successful in assisting
the individual*but needs to be broadened to encompass
family, community, or societal means and measures for
recovery or restoration. The individual-centered focus on
the individual survivor may not be enough, particularly
in regions of war and conflict or after mass disasters.
